1. Background  
A clinical need has been identified of improved treatment for those suffering with primary idiopathic 
restless legs syndrome (RLS). Patients with RLS have a strong urge with sensations of tingling/pain, 
usually in their legs, and often present with a primary complaint of not being able to fall asleep 
regularly.  This leads to significant quality of life degradation, depression, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], lack of 
productivity and a host of downstream effects associated with lack of quality sleep. 
1.1. Restless leg syndrome: Background 
Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder that is characterized by a distressing urge to 
move the legs and in some cases, other parts of the body such as arms [1].  The diagnosis is made by 
a response to five hallmark identifying criteria instituted by [CONTACT_701107] (IRLSS) [2], as quoted below: 
“1. An urge to move the legs usually but not always accompanied by [CONTACT_588306]. 
2. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations begin or worsen 
during periods of rest or inactivity such as lying down or sitting. 
3. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations are partially or totally 
relieved by [CONTACT_206697], such as walking or stretching, at least as long as the activity continues.  
4. The urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant sensations during rest or 
inactivity only occur or are worse in the evening or night than during the day. 
5. The occurrence of the above features are not solely accounted for as symptoms primary to 
another medical or a behavioral condition (e.g., myalgia, venous stasis, leg edema, arthritis, leg 
cramps, positional discomfort, habitual foot tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]).” 
Diagnostically, RLS is considered either primary, often occurring within families, or secondary, 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_588284] (such as iron deficiency anemia, pregnancy or end-
stage renal disease).

Page [ADDRESS_951605] more than 10 million adults and an estimated 1.5 million 
children and adolescents [3].  About one-third of those with RLS symptoms are bothered sufficiently 
enough to seek medical attention. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_588286] 50% more susceptible to RLS than men and RLS is more common in older adults, although it can occur in some 
as early as the pre-school years.  
1.3. Clinical treatments available  
The current standard of care involves initial prescription of dopaminergic medications – such as 
Requip, Mirapex, and Neupro – which initially provide symptomatic relief but often become ineffective over continued usage [4].  Tolerance to these medications is rapid and well-documented 
[5]; approximately 10% of patients per year become refractory to these medications, and fewer than 20% patients have sustained benefits lasting 10 year s or longer [6]. It is also now understood that 
dopaminergic medications cause what is known as “augmentation”, or paradoxical progressive worsening of RLS symptoms that is much faster than the natural progression of the condition.  Due to 
augmentation, patients on dopaminergic medications require increasingly higher doses [7]. Maximal 
dosage is limited by [CONTACT_701108]-effects at higher doses, which include compulsive 
behaviors including substance abuse, hypersexuality, and gambling [8].  As a result of these downsides 
of dopaminergic agents, a minority of clinicians are starting to prescribe gabapentinioids (e.g. 
Horizant) as an alternative first-line of treatment; these medications do not typi[INVESTIGATOR_701057] [9], dizziness, and somnolence during 
the day. For the large subpopulation of patients who become refractory to dopaminergic medications – 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_588288] – there are no FDA approved treatment options and no safe treatment 
options.  As a result of tolerance, augmentation, and dosage limitations, RLS patients often continue 
to suffer from moderate-severe RLS symptoms while continuing to be reliant on high doses of 
dopaminergic medications to provide a small degree of relief.  To address the massive unmet need, 
the leading clinicians involved with RLS advocate prescribing off-label opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] [10].  The leading 
options – oxycodone and methadone, have well documented risks, which include addiction,

primary RLS typi[INVESTIGATOR_701058], thus patients may end 
up reliant on opi[INVESTIGATOR_588290].   
 
1.4. Investigational Procedure  
The investigational device – the NTX Neuromodulation System – is a non-invasive nerve peripheral 
stimulation (NPNS) device developed by [CONTACT_1034], Noctrix Health, Inc. and designed to stimulate 
the common peroneal nerve. Stimulation electrodes are positioned superficially and bilaterally on the lower legs over the head of the fibula bone, a position where the peroneal nerve is closest to the skin.  
This nerve target innervates regions of the lower extremities commonly associated with RLS 
symptoms. If successful, the trial will pave the way for a device-based therapeutic alternative that 
may be used to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_375324] .  
1.[ADDRESS_951607] that patients report short-lived symptomatic relief 
during voluntary movement of their legs and feet [2].  This is conceptually similar to the gate-control 
theory mechanism of pain relief, wherein activation of large sensory fibers suppresses pain signals.  However, for RLS, it appears that muscle activation is especially effective – activating sensory fibers of the affected region of the body (e.g. via rubbing or touching) does not typi[INVESTIGATOR_588291].  
Non-invasive electrical stimulation is known to elicit muscle activation – this feature is used by [CONTACT_588308] – powered muscle stimulators (21 CFR 890.5850) and external 
functional neuromuscular stimulators (21 CFR 882.5810).  However, these devices tend to have 
distracting side-effects including paresthesias and phasic muscle twitches, and thus are incompatible 
with sleep and inappropriate for use in treating a sleep condition such as RLS.  In contrast, the NPNS 
investigational device tested here produces waveforms that are engineered to generate muscle

Page [ADDRESS_951609] superficial position over 
to the head of the fibula bone to activate muscles of the lower leg including the tibialis anterior at intensity levels that are comfortable and non-distracting.  Such comfortable tonic muscle activation is 
designed to suppress RLS symptoms in a manner similar to voluntary movement – but unlike voluntary movement, may be compatible with sleep.  Moreover, the output waveforms and intensities of the 
NTX Neuromodulation System are similar to Functional Electrical Neuromuscular Stimulators and 
Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) Devices for treatment of pain, two classes of devices 
designated nonsignificant risk per 21 CFR 812.3.  Therefore, there is a reasonable expectation that the 
NTX Neuromodulation System will lack significant risks. This study evaluates the effects of NPNS  on the symptoms of RLS during in-home participant-
administered stimulation.  This approach is useful for evaluating safety, usability, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy in a realistic environment - thus identifying any and all barriers to effective and 
tolerable use. 
2. Regulatory Status  
Noctrix Health has determined that the investigational device in this study – the NTX 
Neuromodulation System – is a non-significant risk device under 21 CFR §812.2(b); this assessment was confirmed by [CONTACT_244734] (WIRB) in a prior investigational protocol 
(20170487).  Therefore, an approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from FDA is not required 
to legally perform the study described herein in the US. 
3. Objective  
The study objective is to assess the response of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients to NPNS  during 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_701047].  Specifically, we are investigating whether the magnitude of patient 
response to NPNS is sufficient to enable a clinically significant reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_701059].

b. Protocol range: up to 60 minutes per session, up to 120 minutes per day 
5.2.  Instructions for Use and Administration 
5.2.1.  Route of administration 
The NTX Neuromodulation System is designed to stimulate the common peroneal nerve; 
stimulation electrodes within the device are positioned superficially and bilaterally on the lower 
legs over the head of the fibula bone, a position where the peroneal nerve is closest to the skin.  
This nerve target innervates regions of the lower extremities commonly associated with RLS symptoms. 
5.2.2.  Dosage and dosage regimen  
The dosage depends on the intensity and duration of stimulation: 1. Setpoint stimulation intensity.  The setpoint stimulation intensity will be the lesser of (a) the 
maximal intensity that the subject  reports is non-distracting and comfortable, as determined in 
the calibration session described in the instructions for device use and (b) the maximal intensity 
for each set of stimulation parameters, as determined based on device output capabilities. 
2. Participants will be allowed to adjust stimulation intensity from the setpoint, but only within a 
limited pre-programmed range.  For example, participant may increase intensity if symptoms are 
severe or reduce intensity if symptoms are mild. 
3. Participants may be instructed to administer stimulation each night or only administer 
stimulation when RLS symptoms are present. 
4. Stimulation may be activated for up to [ADDRESS_951622].   
5.3.  Contraindications  
The following are contraindications to device usage: 
• Diagnosis of epi[INVESTIGATOR_105520],  
• Active medical device implant anywhere in the body, including but not limited to pacemakers, 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_54210], deep brain stimulators

bandages) 
• Cellulitis, open sores, or acute injury at or near the location of device electrode application 
6. Risks 
6.1. Investigational device risks 
NPNS devices such as NTX Neuromodulation System result in a known potential for the following anticipated observations, which are typi[INVESTIGATOR_260339], transient in nature, and resolve over 
time. 
o Mild skin irritation from use of adhesive electrodes and/or secondary attachment mechanism. 
o Discomfort, paresthesia, or otherwise irritating or uncomfortable sensations during active electrical stimulation.   
§ This risk is reduced by [CONTACT_588311]. 
o Temporary interference with sleep while wearing the device: 
§ For some individuals, device may be uncomfortable, thus interfering with sleep while wearing the device. 
§ For some individuals, this device may interfere with preferred sleep positions, 
thus interfering with sleep during usage. 
o Temporary increase in RLS symptoms while wearing the de vice: 
§ For some individuals, this device may interfere with voluntary leg movements 
used to relieve RLS symptoms, thus leading to a temporary increase in RLS 
symptoms. 
§ In some cases, this device may otherwise lead to a temporary increase in RLS symptoms during active stimulation for other reasons. 
• This risk may be reduced by [CONTACT_701109]/or 
adjusting the schedule of stimulation.

Page [ADDRESS_951625], the protocol here involves gradual 
dosage reduction (approximately 25% per week) of primarily long-acting (e.g. methadone, 
oxycodone), and exclusively low-dose (below 60 MME) opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  Therefore, we expect a low risk 
of opi[INVESTIGATOR_9801].  However, it is possible that one or more symptoms that are 
associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351] [11] may occur, such as the following: agitation, restlessness, 
and anxiety, depression, insomnia, yawning, increased tearing or watery eyes, runny nose, 
sweating, shivering, trembling, or goosebumps, muscle aches or joint pain, nausea or vomiting, 
abdominal cramps, diarrhea.  Subjects will undergo a weekly investigator assessment and subjects 
with clinically significant withdrawal symptoms will be excluded from further participation.  Moreover, subjects with intolerable withdrawal symptoms will have the option to discontinue 
participation at any time and revert to their original opi[INVESTIGATOR_375324]. 
7. Adverse Events 
Anticipated observations (e.g. common treatment effects) and adverse events occurring during the study will be recorded. Descriptions of anticipated observations and AEs will include the date of onset, 
the date it ended, the severity, the relationship to study device, and the outcome.  All reported AEs 
will be summarized by [CONTACT_28240], system organ class (where applicable), 
severity, seriousness, and relationship to study device.  
The study Investigator and Coordinator will evaluate, characterize and record in the Case Report Form 
(CRF) all adverse events (AEs) occurring in all subjects from the time of enrollment to study exit (or 
premature withdrawal).  Adverse events unresolved at study exit will be followed by [CONTACT_701110] [ADDRESS_951626]’s participation in the study is complete. 
AEs may be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_701111].  
AEs should be evaluated for diagnoses not just symptoms (i.e., “angina”, not “chest pain”).

In addition to verbatim terms, the Sponsor may categorize all AEs using MedDRA preferred terms (PT) 
and system organ classes (SOC).  Analysis may report both verbatim and MedDRA terms. 
7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence, independent of its association with the 
investigational device.  AEs also include any adverse laboratory signs or physical exam findings.   
A serious adverse event  (SAE1) is any AE that: 
• led to a death, 
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that: 
• resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, 
• resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, 
• required in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or a body function 
• or led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. 
A device-related SAE is an event meeting the SAE definition above that is also rated as probably or 
definitely related the investigational device. No device-related SAEs have been reported in prior studies. 
Note that an elective or pre-planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a condition that did not worsen during the 
study is not an AE. 
An unanticipated serious adverse device effect  ([LOCATION_003]DE) is any SAE that is caused by, or associated 
with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application).

8.  Device Tracking 
The Sponsor will send the Investigator investigational devices. The Investigator must house study 
devices in a secure location.   
The Investigator must carefully and completely track receipt, use and disposition of all investigational 
devices. The Sponsor will track sending and receiving of devices.  The Sponsor will monitor site device 
accountability periodically. 
If a Sponsor representative or designee is present at the time of use, he/she may directly take 
possession of used device(s). All devices will b e returned to the Sponsor after the study is complete. 
9.  Device Deficiencies and Malfunctions Throughout the study, the Investigator and study staff will report and document all device deficiencies 
and malfunctions related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance of the 
device.  This includes reporting of device deficiencies/malfunctions that did not lead to an AE but 
could have if: 1) suitable action had not been taken, 2) intervention had not been made, or 3) 
circumstances had been less fortunate.  If possible, the Investigator should return devices suspected of deficiency or malfunction to the Sponsor for analysis. 
10.  Ethical and Regulatory Considerations

10.7. Safety Reporting 
The Sponsor is responsible for ongoing safety evaluation in this study protocol.  Sponsor activities regarding safety include: 
• classification of all AEs 
• review of all AEs reported in the study 
• confirm site’s classification of AEs in terms of severity and relatedness to the study device 
• review of severity and relatedness with the study Investigator, especially when there is disagreement between the Investigator and the sponsor 
• review of device deficiencies and malfunctions, including determination and documentation of whether deficiencies/malfunctions could have led to an SAE 
• ensuring the reporting of all SAEs and device deficiencies/malfunctions that could have led to an SAE to the IRB and, if required, regulatory authorities in a timely fashion 
• informing all site Investigators in writing of all SAEs at all sites in a timely fashion 
• updating the risk analysis and assessment of corrective or preventive actions potentially required as a result of new information obtained in the investigation 
 
The Sponsor will evaluate all serious adverse events against US reporting requirements (Medical 
Device Reporting, 21 CFR 812) and Medical Device Directive (vigilance incident reporting) as per 
its standard operating procedures.  The Sponsor will investigate each SAE to determine whether the event represents an unanticipated serious adverse device effect ([LOCATION_003]DE, see Section 7).  The 
Sponsor will report any event to regulatory authorities, Investigators and reviewing IRBs/ECs as 
necessary. If an investigation shows that a [LOCATION_003]DE presents an unreasonable risk to subjects, the 
Sponsor will terminate all investigations or parts of investigations presenting that risk as soon as 
possible. The Sponsor will only resume a terminated investigation after corrective actions have

For example, in the case of methadone, the minimal quantal dose reduction is 2.5mg.  Therefore, for 
methadone (Table 4 ): 
• a subject on a 10mg starting dose would reduce to 7.5mg (25% reduction) in Phase 1 and 5.0mg 
(50% total reduction) in Phase 2.  The endpoints related to >=20% reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1 and the endpoints related to >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 2. 
• a subject on a 7.5mg starting dose would reduce to 5.0mg (1/3 reduction) in Phase 1 and 2.5mg (2/3 total reduction) in Phase 2.    The endpoints related to both >=20% reduction and >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1. 
• a subject on a 5.0mg starting dose would reduce to 2.5mg (50% reduction) in Phase 1 and 0mg (100% total reduction) in Phase 2.    The endpoints related to both >=20% reduction and >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1. 
• a subject on a 2.5mg starting dose would reduce to 0mg (100% reduction) in Phase 1 and complete the study at the end of Phase 1.  The endpoints related to both >=20% reduction and >=1/3 reduction would be evaluated in Phase 1.

13.2 Run-in and Assessment periods 
 Each Phase involves a 1-2 week run-in period followed by a 1-week assessment period.  Assessment 
periods are primarily designed for endpoint  evaluation.  Run-in periods are designed for two reasons: (i) 
to provide a run-in phase to optimize instructions for NPNS dev ice self-administration (e.g. timing and 
intensity) and (ii) so that any opi[INVESTIGATOR_701070].  Each run-in period will last a minimum of 1-week and a maximum of 2-weeks.   
The investigator is permitted to adjust the instructed schedule of opi[INVESTIGATOR_701071]/or NPNS usage 
during a Step-Down based on clinical evaluation of response to opi[INVESTIGATOR_701072].

[CONTACT_588304], on the study device prior to study initiation. 
16. Study Procedures  
16.1. Recruitment 
Recruitment will initially focus on patients whose opi[INVESTIGATOR_701077] a Study 
Investigator at the time of study entry.  Recruitment may be expanded if additional subjects are 
needed to meet the enrollment target.  Subject eligibility will be determined based on the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria detailed above.  Eligible applicants who chose to participate and sign the informed consent form will be enrolled in the study.  A pre-screening call may be completed prior to 
the first in-person visit (and thus prior to consent) to exclude ineligible applicants prior to the in-
person visit.  Patients not referred by [CONTACT_701117]; applicants who do not meet clinical criteria for a 
diagnosis will be excluded from remaining parts of the study.  Eligibility is contingent on scheduling 
constraints, such as research facility and research staff availability. 16.2. Informed consent  Process  
All participants must be provided a consent form describing the study with sufficient information for participants to make an informed decision regarding their participation. Participants must sign the IRB 
approved informed consent prior to participation in any study specific procedure, with the exception 
of pre -screening . The participant must receive a paper or electronic copy of the signed and dated 
consent document. The signed copy of the consent document must be retained in the study binder in paper or electronic format. The schedule of visits and procedures is provided in Table 2.   
16.3. Screening  
Potential participants will be screened for eligibility based on the criteria in Section [ADDRESS_951658], and will be assigned a

RLS symptoms and medication(s).   
16.6. Device calibration and t raining 
During the baseline (Eval #1) visit, the devices are calibrated for the subject  and the thresholds are 
programmed into the devices.  The calibration process is designed to identify the maximally effective 
settings that are comfortable for each subject.  The calibration process is also used to evaluate 
Exclusion Criterion #10.  Therefore, subjects may be excluded immediately following calibration and 
prior to training and study enrollme nt.  The sponsor may administer the calibration and/or assist in 
administering the calibration. 
Following calibration, subjects are trained on proper usage of the device, including positioning of the 
electrodes on their legs.  Instrument(s) designed for marking the human skin (body-marking pen or 
temporary tattoo) may be employed to mark the locations of electrode placement. 
16.7. Study Treatment Description  
Study subjects are instructed to self-administer treatment for at least 30 minutes on each night that 
they experience RLS symptoms.  Study subjects may self-administer up to four 30-min sessions  per 
day, as needed based on RLS symptoms.  The instructions for timing of these “as needed” doses will be determined at the discretion of the investigator and research staff, based on the RLS symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_423].

• Poor site compliance with the study protocol 
• Inadequate site enrollment 
• Obtaining new scientific knowledge that shows that the study is no longer valid or necessary 
• Persistent non-compliance with IRB or regulatory requirements 
• Persistent failure to comply with obligations arising from the clinical trial agreement 
• Other business reasons (e.g., insolvencies or business entity liquidation) 
The sponsor will document reasons for study suspension and notify relevant site Investigators and 
governing  IRBs.  If suspension occurred because of a safety issue, all Investigators will be notified. 
When terminating the study, the sponsor and Investigator will assure that adequate consideration is 
given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.   
17.  Study Endpoints  
17.1.  Efficacy  
In the absence of an adjunctive treatment, a reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_701088].  The efficacy of NPNS will be assessed by [CONTACT_701119].  Subjects who discontinue due to nonspecific opi[INVESTIGATOR_701089].  Efficacy endpoints will be calculated during the Assessment period except in cases of dropout during the run-in period(s); 
Section 13.2 describes how efficacy endpoints will be calculated in cases of dropout during the run-in 
period(s). 
17.1.1.  Efficacy Endpoints  
Endpoint 1 (Primary Endpoint): Percentage of subjects without a clinically significant increase in 
RLS symptoms (i.e. CGI-I score of 5 or less relative to baseline) during the first Phase involving an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_701053] >= 20% relative to baseline. 
Endpoint 2: Percentage of subjects without a clinically significant increase in RLS symptoms (i.e. 
CGI-I score of 5 or less relative to baseline) during the first Phase involving an opi[INVESTIGATOR_701090] >= 1/3 relative to baseline. Endpoint 3: IRLS during the first Phase with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_701053] >= 20% relative to baseline. 
Endpoint 4: IRLS during the first Phase with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_701053] >=1/3 relative to baseline.

Endpoint 5: Maximal percentage reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_701091] a 
CGI-I score of [ADDRESS_951671] reports taking 
during the week prior to study entry (7 days ending in EVAL 1).  This value will be used to calculate 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_701092].  If a subject reports taking a different opi[INVESTIGATOR_701093], the actual subject-reported opi[INVESTIGATOR_701094].  In cases where a subject is taking multiple opi[INVESTIGATOR_701095], the morphine 
milligram equivalent (MME) will be used to standardize the baseline opi[INVESTIGATOR_40533], to calculate the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_701096], and to calculate opi[INVESTIGATOR_701097].   
17.1.3.  Efficacy Analysis 
Endpoints 1 and 2 are calculated with the following formula, respectively for Phases 1 and 2:  
100%*( (X-Y)/(N -M)), where  
• N = Number of subjects who entered the Run-in period for the Phase. 
• M = Number of subjects excluded during Run-in period due to non-RLS opi[INVESTIGATOR_281556]. 
• Y = Number of subjects excluded during Run-in period primarily due to intolerable 
RLS symptoms. 
• X = Number of subjects who complete Assessment period with no clinically significant worsening in Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) relative to Baseline, where a clinically significant worsening is defined by a score 
of 6 (Much worse) or 7 (Very much worse). 
 17.1.4.  Planned subgroup analysis  
Subgroup analysis will be planned based on the location of RLS symptoms in the body, for the 
following subgroups:

o subjects who experience RLS symptoms that are most significant above the knees (upper legs) or equally significant above and below the knees 
17.1.5.  Criterion for Success  
If Endpoint 1 is greater than 50 percent, then the study will pass the Primary Efficacy endpoint. 
17.2.  Safety  
Safety will be assessed primarily based on response to NPNS.  However, the proportion of subjects excluded due to non-RLS opi[INVESTIGATOR_701098]. 
17.2.1.   Safety Endpoints 
Endpoint 1: Frequency of Grade 2 of higher NPNS -related adverse events, as indicated by a 
relatedness assessment of Probable or Definite. Endpoint 2: Frequency of Grade 3 or higher NPNS -related adverse events.  
Endpoint 3: Percentage of subjects who withdraw from study during Phase 1 or Phase 2 citing lack 
of tolerability of NPNS  as the primary reason for withdrawal. 
Endpoint 4: Percentage of subjects who are discontinued from study due to non-RLS opi[INVESTIGATOR_701099] 1 or 2. Endpoint 5: Percentage of subjects who withdraw from study citing lack of tolerability of NPNS as 
the primary reason for withdrawal during Phase 1 
Endpoint 6: Percentage of subjects who withdraw from study citing lack of tolerability of NPNS as 
the primary reason for withdrawal during Phase 2. 
Endpoint 7: Percentage of subjects who are discontinued from study due to non-RLS opi[INVESTIGATOR_701100] 1. Endpoint 8: Percentage of subjects who are discontinued from study due to non-RLS opi[INVESTIGATOR_701100] 2. Additional exploratory endpoints:

Endpoint 9: Reduction in severity of side-effects related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (not withdrawal) that were 
present at baseline during Phase 1 and Phase 2 assessment periods. 
* Note that data from the Extension Phase is included in analysis of Endpoints 1 and 2 but not 
analysis of Endpoints 3-9. 
17.2.2.   Safety Analysis 
AEs occurring at any time during the study will be described and the investigator or designee will grade its severity, its relationship to device usage, and its relationship to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351]. 
The frequency of the following categories of AEs will be determined: device-related AEs, AEs related to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351], AEs unrelated to opi[INVESTIGATOR_43351], SAEs.  Additionally, side-effects 
related to baseline opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444] , which were present at study entry, will be tracked weekly to 
detect potential improvement during opi[INVESTIGATOR_701101] 5. Device-related will be defined as a relatedness grade of 3, 4, or 5. 
17.2.3.   Criterion for Success  
No Grade 3 or higher device-related adverse events and fewer than 20% of subjects with Grade 2 
device-related adverse events. 
17.3.  NPNS Tolerability  
NPNS t olerability will be quantified based on the percentage of participants who voluntarily withdraw 
from the study prior to the Extension Phase citing lack of tolerability of NPNS treatment as the primary 
reason for withdrawal, as quantified by [CONTACT_701120] #3 on a questionnaire similar to the one 
below.  
Primary reason for withdrawal: 
• I want to return to my original opi[INVESTIGATOR_701102]: o (1) my RLS symptoms have gone up after I reduced my opi[INVESTIGATOR_375324] 
o (2) I experienced other opi[INVESTIGATOR_701103] I reduced my opi[INVESTIGATOR_375324] 
• (3) Use of the NPNS devices was uncomfortable or otherwise intolerable 
• (4) Other

The criterion for success will be fewer than 20% of subjec ts who begin NPNS treatment withdrawing 
for this reason.  
17.4.  Compliance  
Compliance will be measured based on digital tracking of the timing and duration of each NPNS device 
usage during the Assessment weeks of Phase 1 and Phase 2.  A “ night of compliant use” will be defined 
as a minimum of 25 minutes of active NPNS stimulation between 5pm and 8am during an Assessment 
week.  “Total assessment nights” will be defined as the total nights spent by [CONTACT_701121].  “Total assessment nights with RLS symptoms” will be defined as the total nights spent by [CONTACT_701122] .  If 
a subject is removed from the study before the end of an Assessment week, such as due to an adverse event or for personal reasons, data from that Assessment week will not be included in the compliance 
analysis.  In cases where digital tracking logs are incomplete or unavailable, the data will not be included in the compliance analysis. 
• For participants who are instructed to administer stimulation each night, percentage compliance 
will be calculated using the following formula:  
o 100%*(nights of compliant use)/(total assessment nights) 
• For participants who are instructed to administer stimulation only on nights with RLS symptoms, 
percentage compliance will be calculated using the following formula:  
o 100%*(nights of compliant use)/(total assessment nights with RLS symptoms) 
The global criterion for success will be percentage compliance of ≥ 70%, based on the weighted 
average of individual compliances (i.e. weighting nights equally instead of weighting participants 
equally). 
 17.5. Exploratory Analysis 
Additional statistical analysis that is exploratory in nature may be performed , which may include but 
is not limited to analysis of data from the Extension Phase.

During and after the COVID-19 pandemic, replacing some in-person visits with remote interactions may 
be necessary, for example to reduce risk to subjects and/or to comply with local, state, or federal 
regulations.  In such cases, the study records will indicate which in-person visits were replaced with 
remote interactions.   The allowable study duration may be expanded as needed to allow delay intervals 
for mailing and receiving programmed devices. 
In such cases, one of more of the following approaches may be taken: 
1. Remote calibration and training.  Remote calibration and training, where possible, will be coordinated by [CONTACT_478306] a calibration/training device to the subject, conducting calibration and training via a video call using the calibration/training device, and then mailing programmed 
devices to the subject using the settings determined during the calibration.  Alternatively, the 
same devices used in the study may be used for calibration/training. 
2. Remote follow-up visits.  Remote follow-up visits, where possible, will be completed via call or video call, during which the required study assessments will be administered.   
3. Devices may be returned using a pre-paid mailing label, as needed. 
4. Remote consent.  Remote consent procedures will follow the recommendations set forth in the 
“FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products during COVID-19 Public Health 
Emergency” [12].   For example, or more of the following procedures listed in the guidance will be used to confirm consent: 
a. eConsent via a compliant digital platform; 
b. confirmation of consent by [CONTACT_588331]-way call or video conference; 
c. remote explanation of consent followed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-person signature [CONTACT_701124] (to minimize duration of in-person interaction).

Page 6 Study Objectives:  Primary Objective:  
The primary objective is to demonstrate the non -inferiority of 
edoxaban to standard of care (SOC; including low molecular 
weight heparin ( LMWH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA), or 
synthetic pentasaccharide (SP) Xa inhibitors) in the treatment 
and secondary pre vention of VTE in pediatric  subjects with 
regard to the composite efficacy endpoint ( ie, symptomatic 
recurrent VTE, death as result of VTE, and no change or 
extension of thrombotic burden) during the f irst 3 -month 
treatment period  (for Cohort 5, the intended duration of 
treatment is 6 -12 weeks).  
Secondary Objectives:  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to the 
combination of ma jor and clinically relevant non -
major (CRNM) bleedings occurring during treatment 
or within 3 days of completing or int errupting or 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_849609] t 3-month 
treatment period  (for Cohort 5, the intended duration 
of treatment is 6 -12 weeks ). 
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to a 
combination of major and CRNM bleedings and 
symptomatic  recur rent VTE, and death as result of 
VTE  which occur from first to the last dose + 30 
days.  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to all 
bleedings which occur from first to the last dose + 30 
days.  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to the 
compo site efficacy endpoint as  described in the 
primary objective from randomization to the last 
dose + 30 days.  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to 
all-cause mortality from randomization  to the last 
dose + 30 days.  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to the 
individual components of the composite efficacy 
endpoints as  described in the primary objective 
during the first 3 -month treatment period  (for 
Cohort  5, the intended duration of treatment is at 
least 6 to 12 weeks ).

Page 7  To compare edoxaban a gainst SOC with regard to 
occurrence of DVT, catheter -related thrombosis, PE, 
sinovenous thrombosis within and after the first 3 -
month treatment period  (for Cohort 5, the intended 
duration of treatment is at least 6-12 weeks ). 
 To compare edoxaban against S OC with regard to a 
composite combination of major and CRNM 
bleedings from first to the last dose + 30  days.  
 To characterize the multiple dose pharmacokinetics 
of edoxaban in pediatric subjects at Day 5 using 
population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis (appar ent 
systemic clearance [CL/F] and apparent volume of 
distribution [V/F]) and to assess the effect of 
covariates such as age, body weight, and renal 
function on the PK of edoxaban.  
 To evaluate the relationship between edoxaban 
exposure and safety (such as bleeding) and efficacy 
(thromboembolic events).  
 To characterize the effect of edoxaban on biomarkers 
of coagulation ( ie, prothrombin time [PT], activated 
partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], and anti -
activated factor X [anti -FXa]).  
Study Design:  This is a n event driven  Phase 3, prospective, randomized, open -
label, blinded endpoint  evaluation  (PROBE) parallel group study 
in subjects with confirmed VTE .  This study is designed to 
evaluate the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of edoxaban and 
to compare the efficacy and safety of edoxaban after at least 5 
days of heparin (LMWH or SP Xa inhibitors  or unfractionated 
heparin (UFH); with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_849610]) against SOC 
(LMWH, VKA, or SP Xa inhibitors) in pediatric subjects with 
confirmed VTE.  
The adjudication of the efficacy and safety endpoints will be 
conducted by a blinded adjudication committee.  
The study includes two periods:  
 The Main Treatment Period  is defined as the time 
from randomization, until the end of Month [ADDRESS_1181295] s 
less than 6 months (Cohort 5)  old is defined as the 
time from randomization until the end of 
anticoagulant therapy for at least 6 to12 weeks

Treatment Period will be monthly followed 
according to the Schedule of Events ( Table  17.1) 
through Month 3 visit (Visit 5) and 30 day 
Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9).   
 Subjects who complete the Main Treatment 
Period but do not continue into the Extension  
Period will be followed for [ADDRESS_1181296] dose 
of study drug (Visit  9). 
 If a subject discon tinues study medication before 
Month 2, the follow up visit may be combined 
with the Month 3 Visit.  
 The Extension Period  is discretionary for the 
Investigator  and will include treatment from the end 
of the Main Treatment Period (Month 3, Visit 5) up 
through the end of Month 12 (Visit  8).  
 Subjects who discontinue the treatment at any 
time after Month [ADDRESS_1181297] a

treatme nt at Month 12 (Visit 8) will be followed 
for [ADDRESS_1181298] dose of study drug (Visit 9).  
 Subjects who require anticoagulant treatment after 
discontinuation of the study treatment at any time 
will be transitioned to a therapy as determined by [CONTACT_3786] . 
The study will attempt to recruit at least 10% of the subjects 
diagnosed with pulmonary embolism.  
About 274 subjects will be included in this randomized study 
(137 subjects in each treatment arm) which will be conducted at 
clinical sites located  worldwide.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_849632] 
(US/Canada, Europe, Asia/Pacific, and Rest of the World ).  
After subjects are assessed for eligibility based on a newly 
diagnosed index VTE by [CONTACT_849633]/exclusion  criteria, and have undergone bridging 
treatment of at least 5 days of hep arin (LMWH or SP Xa 
inhibitors or UFH; with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_849610]) prior to

Page 9 randomization, the subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio 
into one of the two study arms:  
 Edoxab an treatment arm: subjects will receive 
selected dose of Edoxaban  
or  
 SOC treatment arm: subjects will receive SOC 
anticoagulant according to study site’s SOC 
treatment, as follows (alone or combination):  
 LMWH (alone or followed with VKA)  
 SP Xa i nhibitors (alone or followed with VKA)  
 Vitamin K antagonist (VKA)  
In the case of central ly sourced SOC treatment, Sponsor 
will only provide enoxaparin as LMWH, fondaparinux as 
SP Xa inhibitor, or warfarin as VKA.  
The subjects will be recruited into 5 age cohorts:  
 Ages 12 to <18 years   
 Ages 6 to <12 years   
 Ages 2 to <6 years   
 Ages 6 m onths  to <2 years   
 Ages birth  to <[ADDRESS_1181299] age cohort to be 
randomized will be from ages 12 to <18 years.  Doses for all 
subsequent age cohorts will be made by [CONTACT_849634] s, outside the content of this protocol , and 
after the Independent Data Monitoring Committee  (IDMC ) has 
approved the proposed edoxaban doses.   
Subjects in edoxaban treatment arm (137 subjects):  
Starting doses for each age cohort in the U312 study will be 
selected based on edoxaban exposure for age matched subjects 
and safety data from  a supporting Phase 1 Study  DU176b -A-
U157  study (Single -dose PK/PD study in pediatric subjects at 
risk of VTE), and on population -based PK.   
Edoxaban treatment will be dispensed to the subject on a 
monthly visit schedule.  After Month 3, on a case -by-case basis , 
confirmed by [CONTACT_1034], a [ADDRESS_1181300] cohort (12 to

(<12 years) will receive edoxaban granule s for oral suspension 
and will be dosed on an mg/kg basis (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
The enrollment int o the first a ge cohort (12 to < 18 years) of 
U312 study will begin when the edoxaban dose for this age 
cohort is selected from the supporting Phase 1 Study U157 (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  Approximately the  first 12 subjects of each age 
cohort (total of 53 to 60 subjects) randomized to the edoxaban 
treatment arm (subject number is determined by [CONTACT_849635]) will participate in 
the multiple -dose PK/PD assessment on Day 5 (+3 days, Visit 
2a) as follows:  
 Ages 12 to <18 years (N≈12) 
 Ages 6 to <12 years (N≈12) 
 Ages 2 to <6 years (N≈12) 
 Ages 6 m onths  to <2 years (N≈12) 
 Ages birth  to <6 months (N ≈5-12) 
Two blood sa mples will be collected on the day of the fifth dose 
of edoxaban (Day 5+3 days, Visit 2a) for all age cohorts, 
participating in the edoxaban PK/PD analysis, including:  
 PK Pre-dose sample for all participating  subjects.   
 PK Post-dose sample can be taken at  either:  
 any time between 1.[ADDRESS_1181301] -dose 
or 
 any time between [ADDRESS_1181302] -dose 
 The PD sampling times on Day 5 for measurement of 
PT, aPTT and anti -FXa, will be taken at the same 
time as the PK samples.  
 A PK analysis will be performed .  If the analysis of 
the subjects confirms the edoxaban exposure 
predictions and based on emerging safety, the 
expanded enrollment in the same age cohort will be 
allowed to start .  A no tification will be sent to all 
Investigator s that expansion of the age co hort is 
permitted after the PK analysis.   In addition, a 
notification to the Investigator  will indicate that Day 
5 PK/PD edoxaban exposure evaluation will no

edoxaban in the corresponding age cohort.  
Enrollment in the next younger age cohorts in U312 study will 
begin upon the availability of:  
 PK analysis performed on participating subjects in 
the prior older age cohort in U312 . 
 Safety data analysis on the subjects in the prior older 
age cohort in U312 . 
 PK analysis of the subjects in the next younger age 
cohort in U157.

evaluation.   
Dosage Form, Dose and  Route 
of Administration:  Pre-Randomization Treatment (Screening)  
Pre-randomization treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_849639].  Initial 
treatment using LMWH or SP  Xa inhibitor  or UFH for index 
VTE prior to randomi zation must be within the range of 5 to 15  
days and up to 20 days with Sponsor approval .  If VKA are 
administrated prior randomization, INR prior to randomization 
is recommended to be ≤2.5. 
After pre -randomization, study  treatment should be 
administered on the same day of randomization (Day 1) .

LMWH/U FH/SP Xa inhibitors (with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_849611]), post diagnosis of VTE.  
Edoxaban treatment will be dispensed to the subject on a 
monthly visit schedule.  Af ter Month 3, on a case -by-case 
basis , confirmed by [CONTACT_1034], a [ADDRESS_1181311] was 
on a VKA and randomized with INR ≥2.5, edoxaban treatment 
may be delayed until the INR is ≤2.5 . The Day 5 PK/PD 
assessment will be adjusted to  accommodate the delay in  
edoxaban dosing.  For subjects partici pating in PK/PD 
assessment and receiving LMWH twice a day and who already 
received a morning dose on Day 1 prior to randomization, 
edoxaban can be start ed on the morning of Day 2 (12 hours ± [ADDRESS_1181312] evening dose of LMWH).   
Edoxaban will be started orally at the age/weight/renal function 
appropriate dose ( see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ) for the Treatment Period 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  The following dosage forms will be 
provided for this study:

from adult doses of 60 mg if no dose adjustment needed.  
Dosing regimen for each age cohort will be determined from 
Phase 1 single dose Study U157 and population based PK . 
The dose for the  12 to <[ADDRESS_1181314] designed  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].1 ).  
Based on subsequent IDMC review of Cohort 1 ( 12 to <18 years 
of age ) data from this Study U312  and corresponding cohort 
data from Study U157 , the proposed dose for 6 to <12  years  and 
2 to < 6 years cohort is proposed; for subjects <  2 years, the 
final dose for the cohort  is based upon IDMC recommendation  
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS].2 ). 
Subjects will be instructed to take edoxaban (tablets or granules) 
orally once a day, at the same time every day, with or without 
food.  Tablets should be swallowed with a glass of water .  
Edoxaban dosage regimen will be reduced  (see Table  5.1 the 
following  reasons : 
Body  Weight (BW) < 5th percentile of subject’s age (see 
Appendix  17.9)  
 The edoxaban dosage regimen will be reduced 
permanently for subjects with mo derate renal 
impairment ( eGFR ) ≥30% to ≤ 50% of normal for the 
subject’s age and size at randomization as 
determined by [CONTACT_479264]-appropriate formula: 
Cockcroft -Gault equation for pediatric subjects 
≥12 years of age and modified Schwartz equation for 
pediatric subjects <12 years of age (Appendix  17.7).  
If a subject experiences a change in rena l function 
from normal to eGFR  ≥30% to ≤ 50% after 
randomization, the measurement will be repeated 
within 1 week  to 10 days after correction of the 
underlying factor’s causing pre -azotemia .  If the 
repeat measurement confirms the reduced eGFR , the 
edoxaban dose will be reduced permanently.

Page 17  Additionally, if a subject requires concomitant 
administration of a certain P -glycoprotein (P -gp) 
inhibitor ( Appendix  17.4.6 ), the edoxaban dose will 
be reduced during P -gp administration and re -
established to the original dose once P -gp inhibitor 
administration had  concluded.  
 Subject is ≤28 days old (corrected for gestation age 
of 38 weeks).  This may change based on the IDMC 
recommendation . 
Randomization to Standard of Care Treatment Arm

Local SOC sourcing : 
The SOC will be provided by [CONTACT_737] .  Subject will be 
treated with LMWH, VKA,  or SP Xa inhibitors according to the 
site SOC treatment  regimen  (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Central/Sponsor Sourcing : 
However, if there are regulatory or  site hurdles providing the 
SOC, the Sponsor will provide SOC as enoxaparin or 
fondaparinux or warfarin as follows:   
 Enoxaparin  – Subjects will be treated with 
enoxaparin  alone or can be switched to warfarin 
anytime during the study treatment period.  
 Enoxaparin (LMWH) will be provided  to the 
subject s as solution for subcutaneous ( SC) 
injection in pre -filled syringes with 60  mg/0.6 
mL, 80  mg/0.8  mL, and 100  mg/1. 0 mL 
concentration for injection , or as multiple dose 
vials (for subjects <10 kg) for inject ion where 
allowed per standard clinical practice.  
 Fondaparinux – Subjects will be treated with 
fondaparinux alone or can be switched to warfarin 
anytime during  the study treatment period.  
 Fondaparinux will be supplied as solution for SC 
injection in pre -filled syringes (2.5  mg/0.5  mL, 
5.0 mg/0.4 mL, 7.5  mg/0.6  mL, 10.0 mg/0.8 mL ,

6 to 12 weeks + [ADDRESS_1181319] event of the composite 
primary efficacy outcome will be analyzed using a Cox’s 
proportional hazard regression model including treatment and 
age groups as covariates.   
The edoxaban -to-comparator hazard ratio will be computed with 
95% confidence interval [CI] (two-sided)  based on this model.  
Edoxaban will be considered non -inferior to comparator if the  
upper limit of the 95% CI is < 1.5. 
If non -inferiority of edoxaban is established, edoxaban will be 
tested for superior ity to comparator .  Edoxaban will be 
considered superior to comparator if the upper limit of the 95 % 
CI from above analysis is < 1.0. 
The same proportional hazard model used for primary efficacy 
analysis will be performed for PP Analysis Set and Randomized

Analysis of Safety Endpoint  
An analysis will be performed for the composite of safety 
endpoint s of major and CRNM bleeding events which occurred 
on-treatment from the first dose of study treatment to 3 month + 
[ADDRESS_1181322] dose of the study treatment + [ADDRESS_1181323] .  An event will be considered an “On -
Treatment” event if it occurred while on randomized treatment 
or within 3 days of randomized study drug interruption or 
discontinuation.  
The time to “On -Treatment” major or CRNM bleeding will  be 
compared between treatment groups for subjects in the Safety 
Analysis Set, using a similar Cox’s proportional hazard 
regression model as described in the primary efficacy analysis.  
Analyses will be based on the randomized treatment, unless a 
subject i nadvertently receives the incorrect drug during the 
entire study, in which case, the subject will be grouped 
according the treatment actually received.  
The incidence of bleeding events will also be summarized by

period.  
Interim Analysis:  
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_1181324] 140 subjects (about 50% of subjects) complete the first 3 
months of treatment.  This will allow for adjustment of number 
of subjects in the study if necessary.  
Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses:  
Pharmacokinetic and PD data collected on Day 5 (5th edoxaban 
dose) from a subgroup of subjects dosed with edoxaban  will b e 
analyzed to confirm that the dose used in Ph ase 3 (based on 
single dose PK/ PD pediatric data) is indeed providing the 
expected exposure.  
Plasma concentration and biomarker data will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_654], dose, and time point using descriptive statistics and will be 
included in the clinical study report for this study .  The plasma 
concentration data will be pooled with data from other studies 
for a population PK analysis using nonlinear mixed effects 
modeling; the results will be provided in a separate report from 
the clinical study report for this study.  
Exposure respon se relationships will be evaluated using 
Bayesian estimates of edoxaban exposure metrics (such as Cav, 
Cmax, Ctrough, and AUC ) to explore relationships with safety and 
efficacy endpoints through a model based approach; the results 
will be provided in a sep arate report from the clinical study 
report for this study.

1.1. Background  
The clinical presentation of pediatric venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease includes many 
manifestations, such as catheter -related thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT), and sinovenous thrombosis .  The majority of pediatric subjects  (>95%) with 
VTE have at least [ADDRESS_1181341] important acquired trigger for the 
development of venous thromboembolic disease in pediatric subjects , contributing to > 90% of all 
neonatal thrombi and more than half of all thrombi in the ol der children1, 2 3, 4.  Several 
mechanisms play a role in the development of cathet er related thrombosis, including vessel wall 
injury by [CONTACT_849647] (especially parenteral nutrition), compromised blood 
flow, and thrombogenic effects of the catheter material5.  Catheter -related thrombi develop in 
children with long -term venous access devices for diseases such as malignancy, intestinal failure, 
renal insufficiency, and cystic fibrosis and in children with short -term catheters on the intensive 
care unit or for cardiac catheterization6, 7, 8.  Other important risk factors for pediatric thrombosis 
are congenital heart disease, surgery, immobiliza tion, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome, sepsis, 
and estrogen treatment .  The presence of congenital prothrombotic disorders contribute to the 
development of pediatric venous thrombosis, as well9.   
Increasing numbers of pediatric subjects  with chronic diseases will require anticoagulation as the 
incidence of VTE events rises due to hypercoagulability and the use of central venous 
catheters10.  
Currently, the majority of pediatric thrombi are treated with low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) followed by [CONTACT_849648]  K antagonists 
(VKAs) for a total of [ADDRESS_1181342] treatment day 
because of slow onset of action .  LMWH, UFH, or fondaparinux may be discontinued when the 
VKA has reached its therapeutic level, as indicated by [CONTACT_849649] (INR) 
≥2.[ADDRESS_1181343] mortality rate of 0% in both groups after 3 months14.  In the Canadian outcome 
study mortality as result of thrombosis was 2.2%15.  In the REVIVE trial, recurrent thrombosis 
occurred in 12.5% of the subjects  in the UFH/VKA group and 5.6% in the LMWH group after 3 
months of treatment.14 The recurrence -free survival after 6 months was 93% in pediatric subjects  
of one center in the Netherlands4.  Most subjects  were treated with LMWH or UFH followed by 
[CONTACT_849650] .  Merkel et al followed 27  subjects  treated with LMWH .  After a mean time of 2.3 years 
(range: 0.5 to 6.25 years), 55.6% of the subjects  showed complete resolution with radiographic 
tests, 29.6% partial resolution, and 14.8% no resolution16.  Newall et al studied radiogra phic 
outcome of 22 infants (<6 months old) and 73 children ( ≥6 months old) after 5 days to 4.2 years .  
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, 08 JUN 2021  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 36 In infants and children, complete resolution occurred in 53% and 47%, partial resolut ion in 29% 
and 36%, and no resolution or extension in 18% and 17%, respectively17.   
Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a manifestation of chronic ven ous insufficiency following 
DVT .  Children with PTS must endure chronic sequelae for many decades18.  Gold enberg et al 
showed that PTS occurrence var ied widely (< 10% to 70%) depending on the scoring system; the 
calculated mean frequency of PTS was 26% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23% to 28%) among 
a total of nearly 1000 subjects  with upper extremity (UE)/lower extremity (LE) DVT .  In the 
cross -sectio nal study19, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that lack of thrombus 
resolution was associated with a statistical ly significant 4 fold increase in odds of PTS .  
Therefore we propose to evalu ate edoxaban on the reduction of thrombotic burden defined by 
“no change and extension” of the thrombus at the month  [ADDRESS_1181344] inhibitor of activated Factor X with predictable pharmacokinetics 
(PK) and pharmacodynamics  (PD) .  As a result, anticoagulant effects are more likely to remain 
within the therapeutic range, thereby [CONTACT_46860], and potentially 
removing the need for dose adjustment or frequent monitoring .  These advantages may result in 
increased patient satisfaction and adherence compared with existing anticoagulants    
Edoxaban has been approved for the following indications in the US:  
 To reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism (SE) in subjects  with nonvalvular 
atrial fibrillation (NVAF ) with limitation  of use in patients with CrCL > 95 mL/min .  
 Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) following 5 
to 10 days of initial therapy with a parenteral anticoagulant . 
In the EU and Japan, edoxaban has been approved for the  following indications:  
 Prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adult subjects  with nonvalvular atrial 
fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, such as congestive heart fail ure, 
hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke o r transient ischemic 
attack (TIA)  with no limitation of use . 
 Treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and 
prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults  
This study will evaluate the benefits and risks of edoxaban in pediatric subjects with 
thromboembolic disease.  
1.2. Study Rationale  
Currently available anticoagulants have significant limitations especially in the pediatric 
population .  At the moment, the commonly used agents for long -term anticoagulation in children 
are LMWHs and VKAs .  The important disadvantages of LMWH are subcutaneous (SC) 
administration and thrombocytopenia .  Vitamin K antagonists (such as the coumarins: warfarin, 
acenocoumarol, or phenprocoumon) are indirect coagulation inhibitors, which act by [CONTACT_849651] K dependent liver synthesis of the plasma coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X .  
These agents have been the only oral anticoagulants available for the last 50 years .  The use of 
VKAs is complicated by [CONTACT_46859] a delayed onse t of antithrombotic 
action; a narrow therapeutic index that requires close laboratory monitoring using the INR; an 
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, 08 JUN 2021  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 37 unpredictable and variable pharmacological response; and food and drug interactions requiring 
frequent dosage adjustment20.  Furthermore, as no liquid formulation is available, oral 
administration of VKAs in tablet form is difficult in young children .  Therefore, there exists a 
need for a safe, effective, and more easily managed oral antithrombotic agent for the treatment of 
pediatric subjects  with thromboembolic disease.  
1.3. Benefit/Risk  
In pediatric subjects, the incidence of children developi[INVESTIGATOR_849614] 3% in 
neonates to 8% in older children and as high as 21% in children reported with a first idiopathic 
VTE.  The results of meta -analyses indicate that 11% of children with non -idiopathic thrombosis 
overall develop a second VTE.  Hence, this study offers a platform by [CONTACT_447120] e identification of 
subjects with non -idiopathic thrombosis or those with potential recurrence may be identified for 
therapeutic care.   
In this U312 study, the risk is considered as minimal for subjects who already took 
anticoagulation therapy due to thei r health conditions.  U312 is a study with a sequential 
enrol lment (from older to younger) with tested doses from a Phase 1 study (U157).  The 
established doses were mirrored to achieve exposures comparable to a 60 mg adult dose in the 
Hokusai VTE adult study where proven efficacy and safety were shown to be non -inferior and 
superior, respectively, to well -controlled warfarin.  
In subjects with no history of thromboembolic events, the risk to receive anticoagulants is 
considered as a minor increase over minimal risk relative to the sequelae caused by a 
thromboembolic event.  Bleeding risk is monitored based on established doses for edoxaban that 
were shown to be safe, and constant therapeutic monitoring of SOC  is implemented for the 
alternative treatment in the study.  
In the U312 study, risk was estimated based on exp erience with similar treatments and 
procedures in the pediatric population and from the well -known edoxa ban effects in adults 
(Hokusai -VTE Study).  The benefit to participate in the U312 study can be considered as direct 
for subjects with health conditions  exposing them to occurrence and/or recurrence of a 
thromboembolic event.  Furthermore, the traditional anticoagulant drugs (warfarin, UFH, and 
LMWH) have a number of limitations including issues regarding laboratory monitoring, food 
and drug interactions (warfarin), and a narrow therapeutic window.  Most of the parenteral anti -
coagulants are used more for short -term use in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  VKAs such as warfarin have been 
used widely as oral anti -coagulants for long -term out -patient treatment.  Although warfa rin is 
widely used as an oral antithrombotic agent for prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolism, 
there are clinical limitations to using the drug .  Physicians need to prescribe warfarin very 
carefully in terms of interactions with food and other drugs.   Monitoring warfarin effects on 
coagulation time (PT and INR) is critical for minimizing the risk of bleeding complications.  
Furthermore, there is considerable person -to-person variation in lag time between starting 
warfarin and the onset of appropriate anti-coagulation activity.  
Safer and more effective oral antithrombotic agents are needed for prophylaxis and treatment of 
VTE.  Edoxaban, an oral selective inhibitor of FXa, and might be a candidate to meet this need 
because of more predictable PK without  the necessity for laboratory monitoring and dosage 
adjustments ; fewer drug/food interactions; and a favorable benefit to risk profile as demonstrated 
in prior Phase [ADDRESS_1181345] of care 
(SOC; including low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH), vitamin K antagonist (VKA), or 
synthetic pentasaccharide (SP) Xa inhibitors) in the treatment and secondary pre vention of VTE 
in pediatric subjects with regard to the composite efficacy endpoint ( ie, symptomatic recurrent 
VTE, death as result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden) during the first 
3-month treatment period  (for Cohort 5, the intend ed duration of treatment is 6  to12 weeks) .   
2.1.2.  Secondary Objectives  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to the combination of major and 
clinically relevant non -major (CRNM) bleedings occurring during treatment or within

6 to 12 weeks) .   
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to a combination of major and 
CRNM bleedings and  symptomatic recurrent VTE, and death as result of VTE which 
occur from first to the last dose + 30 days.

month treatment period  (for Cohort 5, the intended duration of treatment is at least  
6 to 12 weeks) . 
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to occurrence of DVT, catheter -
related thrombosis, PE, sinovenous thrombosis within and after the first 3 -month 
treatment period  (for Cohort 5, the intended duration of treatment is at least 6 to 12 
weeks) . 
 To compar e edoxaban against SOC with regard to a composite combination of major 
and CRNM bleedings from first to the last dose + 30 days.

at Day 5 using population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis (apparent systemic 
clearance [CL/F] and apparent volume of distribution [V/F]) and to assess the effect 
of covariates such as age, body weight, and renal function on the PK of edoxaban.

Not applicable.  
2.2. Study Hypothesis  
This study is designed to test the hypothesis that the administration of edoxaban  after at least 5 
days of heparin (LMWH or SP Xa inhibitors  or UFH ; with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_849610] ) is non -
inferior to SOC (SOC; including LMWH , SP Xa inhibitors  and/or VKA ) in treating and 
preventing the composite of symptomatic recurrent VTE, death as result of VTE, and no change 
or progression in thrombotic burden after 3 months of therapy.

3.2. Discussion of Study Design  
This study is designed to evaluate the PK and PD of edoxaban and to compare the efficacy and 
safety of edoxaban  with SOC in pediatric subjects  with confirmed VTE.  
The adjudication of the efficacy and safety endpoints will be conducted by a blinded adjudication 
committee.  
The study includes two periods:  
 The Main Treatment Period is defined as the time from randomi zation, until the end 
of Month [ADDRESS_1181347] s <6 months  old 
(Cohort 5) is defined as the time from randomization until the end of anticoagulant 
therapy for at least 6 to 12 weeks . 
 Subjects who early discontinue the Main Treatment Period will be monthly 
followed according to the Schedule of Events ( Table  17.1) through Month 3 visit 
(Visit 5) , or earlier ( unscheduled  interim visit at 6 weeks) for subjects in Cohort 5 , 
and 30 -day Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9).

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 42  Subjects who complete the Main Treatment Period but do not continue into the 
Extension Period will be followed for [ADDRESS_1181348] dose of study drug (Visit 
9). 
 The Extension Period is discretionary for the Investigator  and will include treatment 
from the end of the Main Treatment Period (Month 3, Visit 5) up through the end of 
Month 12 (Visit 8).  
 Subjects who discontinue the treatment at any time after Month [ADDRESS_1181349] a 
Month 12/Discontinuation Visit (Visit 8) performed with the subsequent 30 day 
follow -up (Visit 9).  
 Subjects who complete Extension Period treatment at Month 12 (Visit 8) will be 
followed for [ADDRESS_1181350] dose of study drug (Visit 9).  
 Subjects who require anticoagulant treatment after discontinuation of the study 
treatment at any time will be transitioned to a therapy as determined by [CONTACT_3786] . 
The study will attempt to recruit at least 10% of the subjects diagnosed with pulmonary 
embolism.  
About 274 subjects will be included in this randomized study (137 subjects in each treatment 
arm) which will be conducted at clinical sites located worldwide.  
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_849632] ( US/Canada, Europe, Asia/ Pacific, 
and Rest of the World ).  The total duration of the study is expected to be approximately 4.5 
years.  
After subjects are assessed for eligibility based on a newly diagnosed index VTE by [CONTACT_849652]/exclusion criteria, and have unde rgone bridging treatment for at least 5 days of 
heparin (LMWH or SP Xa inhibitors or  UFH; with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_849610]) prior to 
randomization, the subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of the two treatment  arms:  
 Edoxaban treatment arm: subjects will receive selected dose of edoxaban    
or  
 SOC treatment arm: subjects will receive SOC anticoagulant according to study site’s 
SOC treatment, as follows (alone or combination):  
 LMWH (alone or followed with VKA)  
 SP Xa i nhibitors (alone or followed with VKA)  
 Vitamin K antagonist (VKA)  
In the case of central ly sourc ed SOC treatment, the Sponsor will only provide enoxaparin as 
LMWH, fondaparinux as SP Xa inhibitor, or warfarin as VKA  as mentioned previously .

Page 43 The subjects wi ll be recruited into 5 age cohorts:  
 Ages 12 to <18 years   
 Ages 6 to <12 years   
 Ages 2 to <6 years   
 Ages 6 m onths  to <2 years   
 Ages birth  to <[ADDRESS_1181351] age cohort to be 
randomized will be from ages 12 to <18 years.  Doses for all subsequent age cohorts will be 
made by [CONTACT_849653] s, outside the content o f this protocol , and 
after the IDMC has approved the proposed edoxaban doses .  In addition , a notification will 
indicate that Day 5 PK/PD edoxaban exposure evaluation will no longer be necessary for future 
subjects randomized to edoxaban in the correspondi ng age cohort.  
Subjects in edoxaban treatment arm (137 subjects):  
Starting doses for each age cohort in U312 study will be selected bas ed on edoxaban exposure 
for age -matched subjects and safety data from U157 study (Single -dose PK/PD study in pediatric 
subjects at risk of VTE), and on population based PK.   
Edoxaban treatment will be dispensed to the subject on a monthly visit schedule.   After Month 3 , 
a 3-month dispen se may be provided based on the Sponsor’s approval to match the study visit 
schedule.  The olde st cohort (12 to < 18 years of age) will receive tablets .  All younger age 
cohorts ( <12 years) will receive edoxaban granule s for oral suspension (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ) and 
will be dosed on an mg/kg basis . 
The enrollment int o the first age cohort (12 to < 18 years) of U312 study will begin when 
edoxaban dose fo r this age cohort is selected from a supporting Phase 1 Study  U157 (see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  The first 12 subjects of each age cohort (total of 53 to 60 subjects) randomized 
to the edoxaban treatment arm will participate in the multiple -dose PK/PD assessment on Day 5 
(+3 days, Vis it 2a) as follows:  
 Ages 12 to <18 years (N≈12) 
 Ages 6 to <12 years (N≈12) 
 Ages 2 to <6 years (N≈12) 
 Ages 6 m onths  to <2 years (N≈12) 
 Ages birth to <6 months (N ≈5-12) 
Two blood samples will be collected on the day of the fifth dose of edoxaban (Day  5+3 days, 
Visit 2a) for all age cohorts, including:  
 Pre-dose sample for all approximately 12 subjects.   
 Post-dose sample can be taken at either:

Page 44 or 
 any time between [ADDRESS_1181353] -dose 
 The PD sampling times on Day 5 for measurement of PT, aPTT and anti -FXa, will be 
taken at the same time as the PK samples.  
 A PK analysis will be performed on the subset of  subjects in U312 study.   If the 
analysis confirms the exposure predictions and base d on emerging safety, the 
expanded enrollment in the same age cohort will be allowed to start.  A notifica tion 
will be sent to all Investigator s that Day 5 visit is no longer necessary and expansion 
of the age cohort is permitted after the PK analysis.  
Enrollment in the next younger age cohorts in U312 study will begin upon the availability of:  
 PK analysis performed on subjects in the prior older age cohort in U312.  
 Safety data analysis on subjects in the prior older age cohort in U312.  
 PK analysis of the s ubjects in the next younger age cohort in U157.  
 Safety data analysis on the subjects of the next younger age cohort in U157.  
PK and safety data will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_849654]  (IDMC ) 
(Section  15.9) who will approve the start of the next younger age cohort.   
In each age cohort , if the estimated median AUC based on the observed PK data in a subset of  
subjects on Day [ADDRESS_1181354]  population profiles  (over -exposure and under -exposure) , the enrollment of subjects in the 
corresponding age cohort will continue and enrollment in the next younger age cohort can begin.    
3.3. End of Study  
This event driven study will continue until approximately [ADDRESS_1181355] 3 -month treatment period.  Events occur across both treatment groups 
for the mITT analysis set (the mITT analysis set includes all symptom atic recurrent VTE, death 
as result of VTE, and no change or extension of thrombotic burden) during the first 3 -month 
treatment period anytime from randomization through the final Month 3 visit (for Cohort 5, the 
intended duration of treatment is 6 -12 week s) in all randomized subjects who receive at least one

and further randomization of subjects will be stopped when the required number of events is 
projected to be re ached (End of Randomization date).  Based on the End of Randomization date 
a global End of Treatment (EOT) date will be established that ensures a minimum of [ADDRESS_1181356](s) randomized to study.  All subjects must permanently discontinue 
study treatment on or before the EOT date.  A final Follow -Up Visit  date will be set one month 
following the EOT date.  All subjects must complete their follow -up safety visit and permanently 
discontinue study on or before the Follow -Up Visit  date.  All subjects that discontinue treatment 
at Month 3 or earlier (for Cohort 5, the intended duration of treatment is 6  to12 weeks)  based on 
EOT will be placed on SOC at Investigator discretion.  All suspected recurrent events will be 
evaluated by [CONTACT_941] C EC.  Adjudicated results will be the basis for the final analyses.

5.1. Assigning Subjects to Treatments and Blinding  
5.1.1.  Treatment Group (s) 
All subjects will be assessed for eli gibility in the study in accordance with the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria after VTE diagnosis.  Eligible subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_849657] (ie, US/Canada, Europe, Asia/Pacific, and Rest of the World ), and then randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to the e doxaban  treatment arm or the SOC treatment arm, respectively.  
Study treatment should be administered on the same day as randomization (Day 1) .  Subjects 
randomized to edoxaban and previously treated with VKA , can initiate edoxaban treatment only 
after the INR is ≤2.5; or [ADDRESS_1181360] dose of LMWH.   
The Day 5 PK/PD assessment will be adjusted accordingly to have 5 doses of edoxaban prior to 
assessment.  For subjects partici pating in PK/PD assessment and receiving LMWH twice a day 
and who already received a morning dose on Day 1 prior to randomization, edoxaban can be 
started on the morning of Day 2 (12 hours ± [ADDRESS_1181361] evening dose of LMWH).  
Initial treatment with heparin (with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_849610]) for index VTE prior to 
randomiza tion must be  within the range of at least [ADDRESS_1181362] an INR ≤2.5. 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Edoxaban Treatment Arm  
Edoxaban treatment will be dispensed to the subject on a monthly visit schedule.  After Month 3 
the distribution of edoxaban may be for a 3 -month period to align with the visit schedule, with 
the Sponsor’s approval.  Edoxaban will be started orally at the age/weight/renal function 
appropriate dose (depending on the results of the ongoing U157 study) for the Treatment Period.    
[IP_ADDRESS].1.  Edoxaban dose recommended for 12 to <[ADDRESS_1181363] on a month ly visit schedule  (see caveat 
above).  The oldest  cohort (12 to < 18 years  old) will receive tablets (15 and /or 30 mg strength, 
see Table  5.1).  (Doses for all subsequent age cohorts will be by [CONTACT_849658].)   Subjects will be instructed to take edoxaban (tablets) orally once a day, at the same time 
every day, with or without food .  Tablets should be swallowed with a gl ass of water.  
Only on Day 5 (+3), the approximately first 12 subjects participating in PK/ PD assessment 
should be fasting  one hour prior to intake of edoxaban dose and a maximum of 2 hours after 
taking edoxaban dose.

a Conditions for dose reduction:  
If a subject requires concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitor ( Appendix  17.4.6 ), the edoxaban dose will be 
reduced during P -gp administration and re -established to the original dose once P -gp inhibitor administration 
had concluded.   
Edoxaban dosage regimen will be reduced permanently for subjects with moderate renal impairment for the 
subject’s age and size at randomization as determined by [CONTACT_849659]: Cockcroft -Gault 
equation for pediatric subjects ≥12 years of age and modified Schwartz equation fo r pediatric subjects 
<12 years of age).  Refer to Appendix  17.[ADDRESS_1181364] expe riences a change in renal function from normal to eGFR ≥30% to ≤50% after 
randomization, the measurement will be repeated within 1  week  to 10 days after correction of the 
underlying factor’s causing pre -azotemia .  If the repeat measurement confirms the reduced eGFR , the 
edoxaban dose reduction will be permanent  even if the subject experiences an improvement in the eGFR 
during the course of the study.  
b Dose reduction due to body weight applies only for fixed doses in subjects 12  to <18  years of age:  
If body weight increases or decreases from the categories of weight defined at consent, the subject will be 
dose adjusted.  Subjects who are ≥60  kg of body weight at consent and drop below that body weight will 
receive 45  mg dose at any subsequent visit.  Subj ects who are  ≥30 and <60 kg at consent and increas e 
their weight to ≥[ADDRESS_1181365] with body weight <5th percentile for age.  
Refer to Appendix  17.9. 
d Edoxaban granulation will be diluted with 8  mL water to provide a concentration of 6  mg/mL dosing suspension . 
 If body weight increases or decreases from the categories of weight defined at consent, the subject will be dose 
adjusted.  Subjects  who are  ≥60 kg of body weight at consent and drop  below that body weight will receive 45 
mg dose at any subsequent visit.  Subjects ≥30 and <60 kg at c onsent increasing their weight to ≥60 kg will 
increase their dose to 60 mg . 
Note: Dose is based upon weight at corresponding visit . 
e Edoxa ban granules are for subjects < 12 years  of age only.  Subjects 12 to <18  years of age should use crushed 
edoxaban tablets.  For those subjects cannot swallow whole tablets, edoxaban tablets may be crushed and mixed 
with 2 to 3 ounces of water and immediately administered by [CONTACT_46847] a gastric tube.  The crushed tablets 
may also be mixed into applesauce and imme diately administered. . 
f The IDMC may meet and conclude that subjects ≤28 days old no longer require a dose reduction  and may 
recommend a revised dose based on the availability and re -review of PK data.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2.  Edoxaban dose recommended for <12 years  old pediatric  subjects  
Subjects of age <[ADDRESS_1181366] dose recommendations based on  the PK and safety data from 
same age cohort in U157 study and subjects evaluated for edoxaban exposure  in the previous 
older cohort  in U312 study .  The PK and safety data will be reviewed by  [CONTACT_31849] ( Section 
15.9) who will approve the start of the next younger age cohort.  Based on the IDMC review of 
Cohort 1 data from DU176 b-D-U312  and corresponding cohort data from study DU176b -A-
U157 , the proposed dose that was safe and effective for VTE treatment was 1.2  mg/kg body 
weight for Cohort 2 (6 to <12 years) (Table  5.1), 1.4 mg/kg body weight  for Cohort 3 (2 to <6 
years) , 1.5 mg/kg, for Cohort 4 (6 months to <2 years) , 0.8mg/kg for Cohort 5 ( >28 days to <6 
months ), and will be determined by [CONTACT_849660] 5 ( 38 weeks gestation to  ≤28 days ).   
Doses for all subsequent age cohorts will be made by [CONTACT_849661], outside the content of this protocol, and after the IDMC has approved the proposed 
edoxaban doses .  An offici al notification will be sent when select age cohorts can begin 
randomization to either SOC or edoxaban treatment.   In addition, a notification will indicate that 
Day 5 PK/PD edoxaban exposure evaluation will no longer be necessary for future subjects 
randomized to edoxaban in the corresponding age cohort.  
Subjects of age <12 years will receive edoxaban granule s for oral suspension  (60 mg)  and will be 
dosed on an mg/kg basis . Check the  body weight prior to dosing and adjust dosage accordingly.  
Frequency of dosage changing is up to the Investigator’s discretion , but the maximum dose 
would  not exceed 45  mg once a day (QD).

Subjects randomized to SOC treatment arm will receive SOC anticoagulant according to the 
study site’s SOC treatment  as follows (alone or combination):  
 LMWH (alone or followed with VKA)  
 SP Xa i nhibitors (alone or followed with VKA)  
 Vitamin K antagonist (VKA)  
If Investigator s choose to use centrally sourced SOC treatment  from Sponsor, the subject will be 
treated as follows:  
 For subjects randomized to eno xaparin: for neonates or children receiving either 
once - or twice -daily therapeutic enoxaparin the drug should be monitored to a target 
anti-FXa level of 0.5 to 1.0 units/mL in  a sample taken at [ADDRESS_1181376] -dose for 
therapeutic levels.  Monthly monitoring  of anti-FXa levels is recommended .  More 
frequent anti -FXa levels can be recommended as per Investigator ’s decision.  
 For subjects randomized to fondaparinux: dosing of 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.05 mg/kg/day 
for subjects with renal disease) .  Monitoring fondaparinux levels (0.5 - 1 mg/L) can be 
recommended as per Investigator ’s decision.  
 For subjects randomized to warfarin: the dose should be titrated to achieve a target 
INR of 2.5 ( ≥2.0 and ≤3.0).  Visits will be at the discretion of the Inves tigator  and 
captured as unscheduled visits for data collection .  Adjustment of the maintenance 
dose of VKA will be dependent on INR monitoring as follows:  
 INR = 2.0 to 3.0, no change in dose  
 INR = 1.1 to 1.4, increase dose by 20%

 INR = 3.1 to 3.5, decrease dose by 10%  
 INR >3.5, hold VKA until INR is <3.5, then decrease dose by 20% when 
restarted.  
To initiate SOC post screening, it is recommended to test infants and children every 4 
weeks once a stable dose of VKA has  been achieved.  However, depending on the 
site’s clinical practice and PI’s discretion, the subjects can be tested at the physician’s 
discretion and/or according to local practice .  More frequent INR testing is 
recommended in infants and children receivin g VKA with any change in diet or 
medication or when an illness occurs.  An unscheduled visit will need to be 
performed to document the discretionary INR measurement and potential VKA 
dosage change as an unscheduled visit day.  
If a therapeutic INR (≥ 2.[ADDRESS_1181377] 24 -48 hours  apart or a

Edoxaban tablets and granule s for oral suspension must be stored at 20° to 2 5°C (68° to  77°F) 
with excursions permitted  to 15° to 30°C (59° to 86°F) .   
SOC treatments must be stored as per labeled storage conditions.  
All d rug supplies must be stored in a secure, limited access storage area under the recommended 
storage conditions .  If storage conditions go outside of allowable excursions , Sponsor /Contract 
Research Organization (CRO ) must be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] .  The excursions will be discussed with the 
Sponsor and CRO to determine what action is necessary.  
Recordings of storage temperature (eg, via the uses of a maximum/minimum thermometer ) must 
be made .  Temperature measurements will be recorded on a temperature log excluding weekends 
and holidays.  
5.2.6.  Drug Accountability  
For Sponsor provided edoxaban or SOC  upon receipt, the Investigator /designee will confirm the 
amount and condition of the drug, confirm the appropriate local language in the label, drug 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], confirm Temperature monitor readings and sign the Receipt of Shipment Form 
provided.   The Re ceipt of Shipment Form should be returned as instructed on the form.  The 
original will be retained at the study center .  In addition, the Investigator /designee shall contact 
[CONTACT_849667] a problem with the shipment and quarantin e the shipment 
until resolution is obtained from the Sponsor.  
For both locally sourced SOC and Sponsor provided study therapy  a Drug Accountability Record 
will be used for the products.  It may be provided by [CONTACT_1034]/Sponsor representative, or the 
site may use a Sponsor Approved Form .  The record must be kept current and must contain the

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 56 dates and quantities of drug received  from central supply (for Sponsor provided therapy) , 
subjects  for whom the products was dispensed (identification number and/or ini tials or supply 
number as applicable), the date and quantity of IMP dispensed and remaining, if from individual 
subject  drug units, as well as the initials of the dispenser.   Edoxaban and centrally sourced SOC 
must additionally be accounted for and reconci led in IXRS.  All unused drug and containers 
whether provided by [CONTACT_849668].  
At the end of the study, or as directed,  all products, including unused, partially used, or empty 
containers, will be destroyed , after full accountability .  If drug destruction occurs  at the study 
center , this  must be approved in writing by [CONTACT_849669][INVESTIGATOR_849616]’s  drug handling and disposition standard operating procedures (SOPs) .  Locally 
sourced SOC should be destroyed locally .  (Local destruction is preferred method of destruction, 
compared to return for depot destruction.)  
For Sponsor provided and  locally supplied drug, d osage form ( ie, tablet , granule bottles , and 
syringes ) site level accountability documentation is required as part of the disposition records of 
IP.  The dosage form site level accountability documentation should be appended to the  
Certificate of Destruction , if available . 
The IMP will only be returned to a designee as instructed by [CONTACT_849670].  Investigational product will be returned only after 
the study monitor ha s completed a final inventory to verify the quantity to be returned .  The 
return/destruction of products must be documented .  At the end of the study, a final product 
reconciliation statement must be completed by [CONTACT_737] /designee and provided to t he 
Sponsor.  
Dosage form ( ie, tablet , granule bottles , and syringes ) site level accountability documentation is 
to be included with each drug supply return shipment (or other returning facility, such as another 
depot) .  This is required as part of the rece iving records for return shipments.  
All inventory forms must be made available for inspection by a Sponsor -authorized 
representative or designee and regulatory agency inspectors.  The Investigator  is responsible for 
the accountability of all used and unused study supplies at the study center . 
5.3. Dose Interruptions and Reductions  
If a subject’s treatment with study drug must be interrupted for medical or surgical reasons ( eg, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46810], a major medical condition, surgery, 
thrombocytopenia  due to cytotoxic medication, or dental work); use of a prohibited concomitant 
medication; or other reasons ( eg, temporary situation that prevents subject adherence with the 
study drug  administration schedule, etc.), the subject’s study drug should be resumed as early as 
the situation allows .  Edoxaban should be discontinued for 24 hours prior to the initiation of the 
procedures (depending on PK/PD data in children) .  Subjects should be  encouraged to restart 
study drug after an interruption except when absolutely contraindicated .  The duration of study 
drug interruption can vary depending upon the individual circumstances, and study drug may be 
resumed regardless of the duration of time that it had been interrupted .  Any subject who 
temporarily interrupts study drug  for more than [ADDRESS_1181378] the reason recorded in the 
electronic case report f orm (eCRF ). 
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_1181379] may reduce  the dos e of edoxaban  for any of the following 
reasons  (Table  5.1): 
 eGFR  is 30 -50% of normal for age and size (Appendix  17.7). 
 Subject is receiving co ncomitant treatment with P -gp inhibitors . 
 Body weight <5th percentile of subject’s age (see Appendix  17.9). 
 Subject is ≤28 days old (corrected for gestation age of 38 weeks) . This may change 
based on the IDMC recommendation . 
For s ubjects receiving P -gp inhibitors , the dose of edoxaban  will only be reduced during the 
administration of the concomitant P-gp inhibitor .  Subjects experiencing eGFR  or body weight  
reduction will maintain their reduced edoxaban dose for the duration of the study.   Once the 
subject turns >28 days old, the dose may be increased to 0.8  mg/kg.  
5.4. Method of Assessing Treatment Compliance  
Dosing compliance for subjects in  the edoxaban  treatment arm  will be assessed by [CONTACT_46888] /bottle  counts  remaining or bottle s returned .  All drug packaging will b e returned at ea ch 
subject visit and will be accountable including bottles with dilutions made for dosing .  
Administration of the IMP will be recorded in the case report form ( CRF )/eCRF/Drug 
Accountability Record.  As necessary, include method of compliance calculation ba sed on the 
returned number of tablets/bottles.  If zero tablets/bottles returned, ask subject whether any were 
disposed/thrown away, rather than taken orally.  
Subjects in the SOC (VKA) treatment arm will be monitored for compliance by [CONTACT_46889] .  Subjects in the SOC ( enoxaparin ) treatment arm will be monitored  for compliance by 
[CONTACT_46890]-FXa levels .  Subjects in the SOC (fondaparinux) treatment arm will be monitored 
for compliance by [CONTACT_849671].  These results will be ent ered in to electronic 
data capture (EDC) system . 
5.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications that the subject has taken within 30 days before randomization will be recorded.  
There are no concomitant medications required as part of the study design .  The f ollowing drugs 
and devices (see Appendix  17.4 ) CANNOT be used during the  entire study treatment period and 
their unavoidable use would require study drug therapy interruption unless specifically indicated 
for study drug discontinuation : 
 Anticoagulants, other than the assigned study drugs, by [CONTACT_28414]  – study drug 
discontinuation  
 Fibrinolyt ic agents, if required to treat thromboembolism events, require study drug 
discontinuation  and consideration of a transfusion of fresh frozen plasma;  
 Single or dual antiplatelet therapy with any antiplatelet agent is prohibited  except for 
low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_46801] 1 -5 mg/k g/day with maximum of 100 mg/day .  If a 
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, 08 JUN 2021  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 58 clinical indication for antiplatelet therapy (other than low dose aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]) arises after 
randomization, study drug should be discontinued .  
 Chronic use of oral or parenteral NSAIDs including both cy clooxygenase -1 (COX -1) 
and cyclooxygenase -2 (COX -2) inhi bitors other than aspi[INVESTIGATOR_87458] ≥ 4 days/week .  Use 
of NSAIDs via other routes ( eg, topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhaled, intranasal, intraocular, etc.) are not 
restricted (see Appendix 17.4.5 ). 
All P -gp inhibitors (please refer to Appendix  17.4.[ADDRESS_1181380] commonly used 
P-gp inhibitors) excluding amiodarone will require dose reduction of edoxaban.  
The Investigator  is encouraged to contact a study physician (telephone number will be provided 
per country, per region; please refer to Study Manual for an appropriate phone number)  if further 
guidance is needed . 
Information regarding concomitant medications will be collected with start date, stop date, drug 
name, dose and dosing regimen for population PK analyses.  
5.6. Subject Withdrawal  or Discontinuation  
Any subject who discontinues from the study treatment for any reason will have their study 
treatment discontinuation recorded .  A subject may discontinue study treatment during the Main 
Treatment Period, however the subject should still re main as a study participant for scheduled 
visits through Month 3 (Visit 5) and the subsequent 30 -day safety Follow -Up Visit .  
Follow -Up Visit  (visit 9) regardless if they stop all anticoagulant therapy or are placed on a 
treatment they have not been assigned at randomization .  If a subject discontinues from treatment 
after Month [ADDRESS_1181381] a subs equent 30-day 
Follow -Up Visit . 
5.6.1.  Discontinuation from Treatment within  the Main Treatment  Period  (Month 3)  
Early discontinuation of study drug is discouraged .  However if, in the Investigator ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], 
continuation of study drug would be detrimental to the subject’s well -being or in specific clinical 
situations ( eg, liver function test disturbances, severe renal insufficiency, recurrent VTE, 
bleeding), the study drug can be stopped permanently.  Subjects who discontinue treatment  
during the Main T reatment Period  should return to the clinical site per the study procedure 
schedule (Table  17.1) for all remaining  safety and efficacy assessments through the sc heduled 
Month 3 visit  (Visit 5)  regardless of what treatment, if any, they may subsequently be taking .  A 
30-day Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9) will be required for all subjects  completing Month [ADDRESS_1181382] 
treatment and the reason for discontinuation of study treatment through 3 months of observation.

Page 59 5.6.2.  Discontinuation from Treatment and Study beyond Month 3  up to 12 Month  
During the extension period (beyond 3 months  of treatment) , all subjects who discontinue from 
the study treatment  and the  study  during the extension period will return to the study center  for a 
discontinuation visit  (Visit 8)  and 30 day Follow -Up Visit  (Visit 9)  after the discontinuation 
visit.  
Note: t hose subjects in the extension do not need to be followed through 12 months of study 
procedures and can be discontinued from treatment and study per Investigator  discretion at a ny 
time with a discontinuation visit  after Month 3 .   
5.6.3.  Reasons for Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Subjects may discontinue the treatment  for any of the following reasons  
1. End of requirement for anticoagulant therapy  
2. Reasons related to adverse events (AEs):  
 Initiating or continuing study drug places the subject at undue hazard as determined 
by [CONTACT_737] ; 
 Serious adverse event (SAE)  or other safety concern that is related to study drug 
treatment as determined by [CONTACT_737] ; 
 Major bleeding e vent as determined by [CONTACT_737] ; 
 Aggravation or new occurrence of renal insufficiency with eGFR  ≤30% of normal for 
age and size ; 
 Hepatic test abnormalities as follows:  
 Elevation of ALT and/or AST ≥ 3 × ULN and TBL ≥ 2 × ULN  simultaneously .  
 ALT and/or  AST ≥ 8 × ULN requires an immediate interruption of study drug 
treatment and prompt repeat testing to confirm abnormality.  
 Clinical jaundice requires an immediate interruption of study drug treatment and 
prompt repeat testing to confirm abnormality ; 
 Any e levation of transaminases combined with clinical symptoms of liver injury ;   
 If a subject discontinues study drug due to confirmed liver enzyme abnormalities or 
jaundice, the subject will have additional evaluations at the discretion of the 
Investigator  as follows:  
 Hepatitis A, B, C, and E screening (anti -HAV IgM, HBsAg, anti -HCV plus viral 
titer, and evaluation for Hepatitis  E); 
 Abdominal ultrasound;  
 Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti -SmAb;  
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV);  
 Epstein -Barr virus (EBV);

Version 4.0, 08 JUN 2021  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 60  Additional evalu ations as deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_849672].  
Subject’s follow -up will be required on a weekly basis until the values (transaminases and 
total bilirubin) return to baseline  or clinically acceptable levels in the judgment of the 
Investigator .  For the above laboratory blood tests, using the central laboratory is 
recommended .  However, if circumstances warrant the use of a local laboratory, copi[INVESTIGATOR_849617] .  All clinically significant hepatic enzyme 
abnormalities and/or hepatic events are to be documented in the eCRF and prompt 
submission of the adjudication dossier should also occur for events that led to study drug 
discontinuation  or we re reported as SAEs . 
3. Unplanned cardiac surgery due to aggravation of cardiac conditions;  
4. Pregnancy;  
5. Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728] ; 
6. Protocol violation ; 
7. Lack of efficacy . 
Those subjects extended beyond Month 3 (Visit 5)  will have study procedures terminated at the 
time of discontinuation from study with a  discontinuation visit  with a subsequent 30 -day safety 
Follow -Up Visit  (Section  6.4.3 ).  
If the subject discontinued study treatment due to an AE, the Investigator  will follow the subject 
until the AE has resolved or stabilized.  
5.6.4.  Reasons for Withdrawal  at any Time During the Study  
Withdrawal of a subject will only occur by [CONTACT_849673] -Up Visit  is possible .  The withdrawal definition is mostly appropriate for those cases that 
occur in the Main Treatment Period because of the require ment to continue subjects on 
scheduled visit s even if they discontinue treatment  prior to Month 3 (Visit 5) .  If a subject  
withdraw s after Month 3 this would be classified as a discontinuation from treatment and study .  
The cases appropriate for withdrawal  during the Main Treatment Period are: 
 Withdrawal of subject consent  by [CONTACT_46894] (s) 
 Death  
 Lost to follow -up (attempts should be made to not have any subject lost to follow -up) 
 AE that occurs during the Main Treatment  Period that requires withdrawal.  
5.6.5.  Discontinuation  Procedures  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other applicable regulations, a subject has the 
right to discontinue  study treatment  or withdraw consent for participation in the study at any t ime 
and for any reason without prejudice to his or her future medical care by [CONTACT_30363].  
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_1181383] be made to det ermine the reason(s) why a subject 
fails to return for the necessary visits .  If the subject is unreachable by [CONTACT_756], a registered 
letter, at the minimum, should be sent to the subject requesting him/her to contact [CONTACT_188528] . 
If a subject is wit hdrawn  or discontinued from study treatment , the IXRS will be called by [CONTACT_849674] .   
Please see suggested classification of discontinuation and withdrawal status in  Table  5.2.

5.6.6.  Follow -up Procedures  
A 30 -day follow -up for safety assessment will be scheduled after the Month 3 visit for all 
subjects participating in the 3 -month Main Treatment  Period  (for Cohort 5, the intended duration 
of treatment is 6 -12 weeks ). 
Subjects who extend toward [ADDRESS_1181384]

 An SAE was not experienced by [CONTACT_849676] -Up Visit , 
 An event (recurrent VTE, or bleeds) was not experienced by [CONTACT_849677] m the last visit to the Follow -Up Visit . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Temporary Interruption of Study Drug  
If a subject’s treatment with study drug must be interrupted for medical or surgical reasons ( eg, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46810], a major medica l condition, surgery, 
thrombocytopenia due to cytotoxic medication, or dental work); use of a prohibited concomitant 
medication; or other reasons ( eg, temporary situation that prevents subject adherence with the 
study drug administration schedule, etc.), t he subject’s study drug should be resumed as early as 
the situation allows.  Edoxaban should be discontinued for 24 hours prior to the initiation of the 
procedures (depending on PK/PD data in children).  Subjects should be encouraged to restart 
study drug after an interruption except when absolutely contraindicated.  The duration of study 
drug interruption can vary depending upon the individual circumstances, and study drug may be 
resumed regardless of the  duration of time that it had been interrupted.  Any subject who 
temporarily interrupts study drug for more than [ADDRESS_1181385] the reason recorded in the 
eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Subject Re -Screening Procedures  
Re-screening (retesting of lab oratory test result s) is permit ted only once for any subject with 
Sponsor approval who failed to meet eligibility criteria upon initial screening related to a specific 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  If a subject needs to be re -screened for any time dependent module 
(ie, laboratory, vita l signs, etc.) , the Investigator will perform an unscheduled visit within [ADDRESS_1181386] the study risks and possible benefits explained to them, the ICF 
reviewed with them, and all qu estions answered for them .  Subjects will undergo procedures 
specific to study qualification (Section  6.1) only after the ICF is signed by [CONTACT_423]/or the 
subject’s legal representative , and age appropriate assent obtained from subjects capable of doing 
so.  Subjects who complete the screening period and are determined to be eligible for study 
participation per the inclusion and exclusion crit eria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either 
the edoxaban -treatment arm or the SOC -treatment arm.   
All subjects will undergo safety objectives evaluations at the EOT  at Month 3 and at 30 -days 
thereafter .  Subjects who participate in the Extension Period will undergo safety objectives 
evaluations (recurrent VTE events, bleeding events, or any other AEs) at Months 6, 9, and 12, 
and 30 -days after cessation of treatment  if treatment up to 12 months is required .  
The Schedule of Events for this study is  provided in Appendix  17.1.  
6.1. Screening: Study Qualification  (At least Day -5 to -1, Visit 1 ) 
Any protocol -specified study qualification procedures/tests not already done as part of routine 
care will be conducted only after the subject signs the ICF and before randomization.    
Note : A newly diagnosed VTE or diagnostic workup may have been performed  prior to 
identifying the subject for the study and signing the consent.  
Prior to signing the ICF, potential subjects and their parent(s)/guardian(s) will have the study 
risks and benefits explained to them, the associated ICF and assent form if applicable  will be 
reviewed, and all questions answered for them .  Written informed consent must be signed by [CONTACT_31588](s)/guardian(s) of all subjects, and assent obtained from the child, when and where 
applicable, prior to entry into the study.  
 It is anticipated that some subjects will have had some of the study qualification 
procedures done as part of routine care outside the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_9049] (for 
example, diagnostic work -up and associated care for index V TE).  As long as these 
procedures were done for the newly diagnosed index VTE before randomization, they 
may be used to complete the Screening eCRF.  
 A Screening eCRF must be completed for every subject with a signed ICF .  Any 
protocol -specified study qualification procedures/tests not already done as part of 
routine care  will need to be conducted after the parent(s)/guardian(s) signs the ICF 
and before randomization.  
 Register the subject for screening within IXRS Screening Visit and subject number 
will be provided.  
 For subjects who did not have any protoco l-specified screening procedures done as 
part of routine care for the newly diagnosed index VTE before randomization, the 
following study qualification procedures must be completed to ensure that the subject 
is eligible for the study.

 Record medical/surgical history,  
 Record p rior medication (up to 30 days prior to screening)   
 Perform physical examination including:  
▪ Vital signs (BP, heart rate, and body temperature after resting in a sitting 
or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547] [Note: the appropriate cuff size base on arm 
circumference will be used.]  see Section  9.9)  
▪ Height and body weight (may be performed by [CONTACT_46898] ).  
 Assess the subject for active bleeding, high risk for bleeding  and any other 
contraindications for treatment with LMWH, or UFH, SP anti -FXa, VKAs  or 
NOACs . 
 INR assessment and aPTT measurement to monitor coagulation  for all subjects  
 Ensure that the subject qualifies with regard to the following laboratory tests for 
exclusion criteria:  
 Liver function assessments (ALT, AST, TBL, ALP)  
 Serum chemistry panel , Serum creatinine , and eGFR  
 Hematology  
 Urinalysis  
 Urine pregnancy test (for post -menarchal females)  
 Samples taken as part of routine care outside study auspi[INVESTIGATOR_849618] (INR, aPTT, 
ALT, TBL, eGFR and platelets) were performed for the newly diagnosed index VTE 
before randomization .  Alternatively , the central laboratory may be used for the above 
study qualification laboratory tests.   If central laboratory is also used at the same visit 
with a resulting discrepancy for exclusion criteria, the local laboratory result  will still 
be used to qualify the subject.  
 Review concomitant medications for assessment of exclusion criteria.  
 Assess for and record AEs and concomitant medications.  
Full documentation for the above qualifying procedures and related results are required even if 
local laboratory results were used to qualify the subject.

If all procedures and tests done before randomization confirm the subject’s eligibility 
(Section  4.1) for the study, then the IXRS will be contact[CONTACT_849678] .  
Randomization may occur in IXRS the day prior to dosing for clinical logistics.   The following 
activities should be done at the time of randomization:  
 Record any prior medications used since the last visit.  
 Record any AEs since  screening visit.  
 Urine pregnancy test (for post -menarchal females)  
 Dispense study drug and record amount (number of tablets/bottles) dispensed .  
Locally sourced SOC study therapy will need to be supported by a prescription 
identifying the type of SOC to b e provided ; 
 Explain the study medications and the proper daily dosing to the parent/guardian and 
subject (if applicable) using the study medication dosing calendar, and confirm that 
the subject understands the proper daily dosing of study medication . 
 Instruct subject to bring all medications including study drug packaging and bottles  to 
each visit.  
Provide parent(s)/legal guardian (s) or legally acceptable representative parent(s)/guardian(s) and 
subject (if applicable) information with detailing sympto ms suggestive of recurrent VTE and

levels or aPTT measurements or fondaparinux levels .  These measurements will be taken in the 
clinic, or alternatively, optional site -specific local laboratory ( Appendix  17.2). 
All suspected VTE and bleeding endpoints as well as hepatic abnormalities identified by [CONTACT_849679] .  Adjudication packages will contain copi[INVESTIGATOR_727864]  (or films) of appropriate diagnostic tests, clinic notes, laboratory tests, discharge 
summaries, autopsy reports, etc. used in the subject work -up following a suspected event .   
Investigator s will maintain a confidential subject identification code list o f names of all subjects 
randomized to study to allow the Investigator  to reveal the identity of any subject when 
necessary.  
6.3. Main Treatment Period  
The Main Treatment P eriod is defined as the time from randomization until the end of Month [ADDRESS_1181388] s <6 months old (Cohort 5) is defined as the 
time from randomization until the end of anticoagulant therapy for  at least  6 to 12 weeks . 
6.3.1.  Subjects randomized to the edoxaban  treatment arm :  
For the approximately first [ADDRESS_1181389] s of each age cohort randomize d in edoxaban -treatment 
arm, two blood samples will be collected on Day 5 +3 days.  Dosing on Day 5 will be done in the 
study center .  Note: I f the subject did not initiate dosing of edoxaban on the randomization day 
(Day 1), the Day 5 PK/PD assessment should be scheduled when the actual Day 5 dose is taken.  
Edoxaban  will be started orally at the age/weight/renal function appropriate dose (depe nding on 
the results of the ongoing U157 study) for the treatment period.  The study will start enrollment 
from older to younger children as data from the single dose PK, PD study become available for 
each age cohort  (Study U157) . After Month 3, dispense may be provided for a 3 -month period to 
align with the visit schedule based on approval of the Sponsor.  
For subjects in Cohort 5, the Principal Investigator ( PI) may use medical discretion and clinical 
judgment to determine the duration of anticoagulation t reatment.  For these subjects, the intended  
duration of treatment should be at least 6 to 12 weeks.   If 6 weeks ’ duration is chosen, a 
radiologic VTE image will be taken and will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_849619] [ADDRESS_1181390] should continue on treatment into the extension.  
Approximately 12  subjects from  each age cohort (total of approximately 53 to 60 subjects) wi ll 
participate in the multiple -dose PK/PD assessment  (subject number is determined by [CONTACT_849680]) .  For the youngest Cohort 5 (birth to <6 
months), 5 to 12 subjects on edoxaban will be enrolled.  
 Ages 12 to <18 years  (N≈12)

treatment (wallet card or bottle of granules) to the clinic for dosing that day.  A witness should 
observe the edoxaban dose taken on Day [ADDRESS_1181391]  included in the multiple -dose PK/PD assessment will have a laboratory developed 
test (LDT) PK assay performed for edoxaban exposure verification .  The first approximately 12 
subjects participating in PK/PD assessment should be fa sted one hour prior to the uptake of 
edoxaban dose and a maximum of [ADDRESS_1181392]’s age or other needs, milk, or an equivalent substitute liquid (but not fruit 
juices or caffeinated drinks), will be allowed until  [ADDRESS_1181393] -dose. 
In preparation for the Study Day 5 visit, subjects will be instructed to do the following:  
 Record date/time of the last 2 study drug doses taken before the Day 5 visit  
 Record date/time of the last meal taken  before the Day 5 visit  
 Record time of study drug dose taken on visit day  
The PK sampling windows (hours) on the day of the fifth dose of edoxaban (Day 5 +3 days) is 
planned to occur as follows:  
 PK Pre-dose sample for all participating subjects.   
 PK Post-dose sample can be taken at either:  
 any time between 1.[ADDRESS_1181394] -dose 
or 
 any time between [ADDRESS_1181395] -dose 
 The PD sampling times on Day 5 for measurement of PT, aPTT and anti -FXa, will be 
the same time as  the PK samples.  
 An edoxaban  PK analys is will be performed on Day 5  subjects in U 312 study.  If the 
analysis of the  subjects confirms the edoxaban exposure predictions and based on 
emerging safety, the expanded enrollment in the same age cohort will be allowed to 
start.   A notification will be  sent to all Investigator s that expansion of the age cohort 
is permitted after the PK analysis.   In addition, a notification to the investigator will 
indicate that Day 5 PK/PD edoxaban exposure evaluation will no longer be necessary 
for future subjects ran domized to edoxaban in the corresponding age cohort.  
 For subjects in Cohort 5, specifically those ≤[ADDRESS_1181396] (RFT) 
will be performed  on or around Day 5  (at the same time of PK sampling) . 
Enrollment in the next younger age cohorts i n U312 study will begin upon the availability of:  
 PK analysis performed on Day 5  participant subjects in the prior older age cohort in 
U312  
 Safety data analysis on Day 5  subjects in the prior older age cohort in U312  
 PK analysis of the subjects in the next  younger age cohort in U157.

The following will be performed at this visit:  
 Review dosing instructions  
 Safety review for AEs/SAEs  
 Review for endpoint events (VTE, bleeding)  
The Investigator  will use discretion to decide when and how often to repeat INR or anti -FXa 
levels or aPTT measurements or fondaparinux levels .  These measurem ents will be taken in the 
clinic, or alternatively, optional site -specific local laboratory ( Appendix  17.2). 
6.3.2.  Subjects randomized to the SOC  treatment arm:  
Standard of Care treatment will be dispensed to the subject on a monthly visit schedule .  After 
Month [ADDRESS_1181398] will be treated 
with LMWH, VKA, or SP Xa inhibitors according to the site SOC treatment (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
However, i f there are regulatory or site hurdles providing the SOC, the Sponsor will provide 
SOC as enoxaparin or fondaparinux or warfarin (see below).  
If Investigator s choose to use the SOC suppl ied by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor, the subject will be treated as 
follows:  
 Enoxapari n – Subjects will be treated with enoxaparin alone or can be switched to 
warfarin anytime during  the study treatment period.  
 Fondaparinux – Subjects will be treated with fondaparinux alone or can be switched 
to warfarin anytime during the study treatment p eriod.  
 For subjects in whom clinicians prescribe warfarin, this will be started on Day  1.  
Heparin (enoxaparin or fondaparinux or UFH depending on the therapy received 
during pre -randomization period) will be discontinued when INR ≥ 2.0 and ≤ 3.[ADDRESS_1181399] will 
continue warfarin for the remainder of the study treatment period.  
The Investigator  will use discretion to decide when and how often to repeat INR  or anti-FXa 
levels or aPT T measurements  or fondaparinux levels .  These measurements will be taken in the 
clinic, or alternatively, optional site -specific local laboratory  (Appendix  17.2).

 Objective diagnostic testing   
 Autopsy  
 Death which cannot be attributed to a documented cause and for which VTE cannot 
be ruled out.  
Thrombotic burden  will be assessed by [CONTACT_849685] 3 ± 5 days (for Cohort 5 , at 6 to 12 weeks ± 5 days ) in the absence of symptomatic 
recurrent VTE .  Hence, the same imaging technique that is used at the enrollment of the subject  
into the study will be required to be used at the end of the observational period  ± 3 days .  A 
thrombotic burden endpoint will be regi stered if there is no regression of the thrombus size or 
extension of the thrombus at Month 3 visit ± 3 days (for Cohort 5 , at 6 to 12 weeks ± 3 days)

 The individual components of the primary efficacy endpoint during the first 3 -month 
period : 
 Symptomatic  recurrent VTE  
 Death as a result of VTE  
 No change or extension of thrombotic burden.  
 All-cause mortality from randomization to last dose + 30 days.  
 The DVT, Catheter -related thrombosis, PE,  and sinovenous thrombosis events within 
and after the first 3 -month treatment period  (for Cohort 5, the intended duration of 
treatment is 6 -12 weeks ). 
7.3. Exploratory Efficacy Endpoint(s)  
Not applicable . 
7.4. Clinical Outcome Endpoint  
The clinical outcome endpoint is:   
 A composite combination of major and CRNM bleedings and symptomatic recurrent 
VTE, and death as result of VTE which occur from first to the last dose + 30 days . 
7.5. Appropriateness of Selected Efficacy Endpoint (s) 
Definitions of outcomes in U312 are based on presentations/discussions at the Perinatal and 
Paediatric Haemostasis Subcommittee meetings during the 56th –58th Scientific and 
Standardization Committee (SSC) Meetings of the International Society on Thrombosis and 
Haemostasis (ISTH )21. 
The proposed primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 3 VTE study (U312) is a composite 
endpoint consisting of the incidence of symptomatic recurr ent venous thromboembolic disease, 
death as a result of VTE, or no change or extension of thrombotic burden within the 3 -month +3 
days study period.  
In children with VTE disease, the incidence of “no change in thrombotic burden” has been 
reported in severa l clinical pediatric studies as 14.8%16, 17% and 18%17.  Lack of thrombus 
resolution has been reported as a prognostic factor for the development of post -thrombotic 
syndrome (PTS )18.  PTS is a known complication of VTE that children must endure as chronic 
sequelae that adversely impacts quality of life (QOL) for many decades .  Goldenberg et al.  
conducted a systematic rev iew of PTS in children in [ADDRESS_1181406] DVT (Upper Extremity/Lower Extremity)  
was reported as high as 26% .  In Goldenberg’s review, the lack of thrombus resolution was 
menti oned as a prognostic factor for the development of PTS.  
The clinical significance of “no change in thrombotic burden” in the incidence of PTS is 
therefore clearly documented .  In order to ensure adequate adjudication of this endpoint, the 
Sponsor will be i mplementing several steps:  
1. The same imaging technique that is used at the enrollment of the subject  into the study 
will be required to be used at the end of the observational period  
2. Detailed instructions ensuring consistency in obtaining images for each of  the techniques 
will be provided to the study sites  
3. Both initial and follow -up imaging will be independently and blindly assessed by [CONTACT_849686].

The medical call center will contact [CONTACT_849688].  
All AEs (see Section 9.4.1  for definitions) occurring after the subject signs the Informed Consent 
Form and up to [ADDRESS_1181415] dose of study drug (ie, the Follow -Up Visit ), whether 
observed by [CONTACT_849689], will be recorded on the Adverse Event 
CRF page.  Medical conditions (including laboratory values/vital signs that are out of range) that 
were diagnosed or known to exist prior to Informed Consent will be recorded as part of medical 
history.   
All AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs) , bleeding , and events of special interest  are to be 
reported according to the procedures in Section 9.5.   
All laboratory  results  and vital signs  should be appraised by [CONTACT_46921] .  Isolated abnormal laboratory results  or vital sign findings should  be 
reported as AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation,  dose reduction,  
require corrective treatment, or constitute an AE in the Investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
At each visit, the Investigator  will determine whether any AEs have occurred by [CONTACT_46922].  Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_46923].  Subjects should be questioned in a general way, 
without asking about the occurrence of a ny specific symptom s.  Parents will be guided  to look 
out for signs and symptoms related to bleeding risks.  The Investigator  must assess all AEs t o 
determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in Section  9.4.  
The Investigator ’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentation 
with the Investigator ’s signature.  In this pediatr ic population , specifically in the youngest cohort 
(Cohort 5)  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] (subjects who are  ≤28 days old ), site staff will contact [CONTACT_849690] 2 , Day 7 , and every week thereafter until Month 1 (Visit 3) post  
discharge to inq uire about AEs, SAEs , and bleeding events . 
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term.  When a diagnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available.  If the signs and symptoms are distinct and  do not suggest 
a common diagnosis, report them as individual entries of AE or SAE.   
For events that are serious due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31558] (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18543]).  A procedure is

For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of deat h should always be reported as an SAE.   
Any serious, untoward event that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the 
Investigator  assesses as related to study drug should also be reported and managed as an SAE.  
The Investigator  should follow sub jects with adverse events until the event has resolved or the 
condition has stabilized.  In case of unresolved adverse events, including significant abnormal 
laboratory values at the end of study assessment, these events will be followed until resolution o r 
until they become clinically not relevant.  
9.2. Safety Endpoint  Event (s) 
All potential safety endpoints will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_15731] .  Study endpoints and 
safety data will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_849691]. 
The safety related secondary objectives are:  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to the combination of ma jor and 
CRNM bleedings occurring during treatment or within [ADDRESS_1181416] 3-month treatment period  (for Cohort 5, 
the intended duration of treatment is at least 6 to 12 weeks) .  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with regard to all bleedings which occur from 
first to the last dose + 30 days.  
 To compare edoxaban against SOC with reg ard to a composite combination of major 
and CRNM bleedings from first to the last dose + 30 days.  
The corresponding safety endpoints are:  
 A combination of ma jor and CRNM bleedings occurring during  treatment or within [ADDRESS_1181417] 3 -month 
treatment period.   For subjects in C ohort  5, ie, <6 months  old, the primary safety 
endpoint,  is a combination of major and CRNM bleedings occurring during treatment 
or within 3 days of completing or interrupting or s toppi[INVESTIGATOR_849612] 6  to 12 weeks 
period + 3 days .  
 All bleedings from first to the last dose + 30 days . 
 A combination of major and CRNM bleedings from first to the last dose + 30  days 
9.2.1.  Bleeding  
Bleeding is a protocol -specified endpoint and a known concern  associated with anticoagulant 
therapy including edoxaban and VKAs (including warfarin) .  All bleeding events will be 
reported in the eCRF as either an AE or SAE depending upon the seriousness criteria along with 
completion of the bleeding event form.  All bleeding events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_15741].

Page 84 Bleeding definitions  are based on presentations/discussions at the Perinatal and Paediatric 
Haemostasis Subcommittee meetings during the 56th -58th Scientific and Standardization 
Committee (SSC) Meeting of th e ISTH .21 
Major bleeding is defined as a composite ( ie, any) of the following:  
 Fatal bleeding ; and/or   
 Symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or or gan, such as intracranial, intra -spi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], 
intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra -articular, pulmonary, or pericardial, or intramuscular 
with compartment syndrome; and/or  
 Bleeding causing a decrease in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more, or 
leadi ng to transfusion of the equivalent of two or more units of whole blood or red 
blood cells (RBCs) . 
Clinically relevant non -major bleeding is defined as either of the following:  
 Acute or sub -acute clinically overt bleed that does not meet the criteria for a major 
bleed but prompts a clinical response, in that it leads to at least one of the following:  
 A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_46817] ; 
 A physician -guided medical or surgical treat ment for bleeding or  
 A change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation of 
study drug).  
Minor bleeding is defined as follow s:  
 Any overt or macroscopic evidence of bleeding that does not fulfill the above criteria 
for either ma jor bleeding or clinically relevant, non -major bleeding  
Minimal criteria defining a significant bleeding per ISTH27 are as follows : 
For each specific bleeding symptom, the ISTH/ Scientific and Standardization Committee ( SSC) 
joint working group proposed minimal criteria in order to classify a symptom as significant:  
1. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940]:  
 Any nosebleed, especially occurring after puberty that causes subject  concern (eg, 
interference or distress with daily or social activities) is considered significant.  
 In general, epi[INVESTIGATOR_849620] 10 
minutes, has a frequency of <5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]/year, has a seasonal occurrence, or is  
associated with infections of the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_46819] 
(e.g., dusty dry air).  
2. Cutaneous bleeding:  
 Bruises are considered significant when 5 or more (>1  cm) in exposed areas;  
 Petechiae are considered significant when adequat ely described by [CONTACT_46915];  
 Hematomas are considered significant when occurring without trauma.

Page 85 3. Minor cutaneous wound:  
 Any bleeding epi[INVESTIGATOR_46820] (eg , by [CONTACT_46916], knife, or 
scissors) or that requires frequent ban dage changes is considered significant.  
 Insignificant bleeding from wounds includes those of duration <10 minutes and 
lesions that usually require s titches in normal subjects (eg , under the chin).  
 Symptoms should also be manifest on more than 1 occasion to be considered 
significant.  
4. Oral cavity bleeding:  
 Gum bleeding should be considered significant when it causes frankly bloody sputum 
and lasts for 10 minutes or longer on more than one occasion.  
 Tooth eruption or spontaneous tooth loss bleeding should be considered significant 
when it requires assistance or supervision by a physician, or lasts at least 10 minutes 
(bleeding associated with tooth extraction is considered separately).  
 Bleeding occurring after bites to lips, cheek, and tongue should be con sidered 
significant when it lasts at least 10 minutes or causes a swollen tongue or mouth.  
5. Hematemesis, melena, and hematochezia:  
 Any gastrointestinal bleeding that is not explained by [CONTACT_46917] a specific 
disease should be considered significant.  
6. Hematuria:  
 Only macroscopic hematuria (from red to pale -pi[INVESTIGATOR_46821]) that is not explained by [CONTACT_46918] a specific urologic disease should be considered significant.  
7. Tooth extraction:  
 Any bleeding occurring after leaving the dentist’s office and req uiring a new, 
unscheduled visit or prolonged bleeding at the dentist’s office causing a delay in the 
procedure or discharge should be considered significant.  
8. Surgical bleeding:  
 Any bleeding judged by [CONTACT_46919], that causes a de lay 
in discharge, or requires some supportive treatment is considered significant.  
9. Menorrhagia:  
 Any bleeding that interferes with daily activities such as work, housework, exercise 
or social activities during most menstrual periods should be considered si gnificant.  
 Criteria for significant bleeding may include any of the following: changing pads 
more frequently than every 2 hours; menstrual bleeding lasting 7 or more days; and 
the presence of clots >1 cm combined with a history of flooding.

 Any subdural or intra -cerebral hemorrhage is considered significant  
All safety and efficacy endpoin ts described will be adjudicated in a blinded manner by [CONTACT_15741] .   
The CEC will require all available details about the bleeding event and related information to 
allow successful objective adjudication of the event .  Details may include, but are not limite d to, 
information such as the following:  
 Location of the bleeding;  
 Duration of the bleeding;  
 Fatality  
 Treatment for bleeding event, including notes or summary of the recommendations 
from a healthcare professional from whom medical treatment was obtained;  
 Magnitude of the bleeding (including size if skin or subcutaneous hematoma);  
 Hemoglobin levels at randomization and at the time of the bleeding event, lowest 
value, pre - and post -transfusion values, and after resolution of the bleeding event;  
 Diagnostic tes ts done to evaluate the bleeding such as endoscopy (GI bleed), ENT 
consult (ear, nose, throat bleed), urology consult (hematuria or urogenital bleeding), 
surgical consult (skin and soft tissue, including intra -abdominal bleeding), 
gynecological consult (ut erine or vaginal bleeding), neurological consult (intracranial 
bleed), or ophthalmology consult (intraocular bleed);  
 Diagnostic scans (CT scans or MRIs), ultrasounds or x -rays performed to evaluate the 
bleeding (intracranial bleed)  
 Any other information that can be of help to the CEC to allow successful objective 
adjudication of the bleeding event.  
9.3. Events of Special Interest  
9.3.1.  Liver Enzyme Abnormalities/Liver Dysfunction  
Liver function is an area of special interest .  Critical liver laboratory assessments i nclude ALT, 
AST, TBL, and ALP .  Particular attention will be pai d to subjects with ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN 
and TBL ≥ 2 × ULN simultaneously without  evidence of cholestasis (ALP  ≥2 × ULN is 
considered evidence of possible cholestasis) and without alternative eti ology for hepatocellular 
damage.  
Liver enzyme abnormalities that lead to study drug interruption/discontinuation as well will be 
adjudicated in a blinded manner by [CONTACT_15741] .  The CEC charter includes a process by [CONTACT_46925]  a liver disease specialist.  
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_1181418] 
additional evaluations in order to determine the nature and severity of the liver injury .  The 
documents to be sent for adjudication:  
 Results of confirmatory tests an d diagnostic evaluation  
 The hepatic event adjudication worksheets.  
If a subject temporarily interrupts (or discontinues) study drug due to confirmed liver enzyme 
abnormalities or jaundice, the subject will have additional evaluations  as described in 
Section  5.6.3  at the discretion of the Investigator .  
Combined elevations of aminotransferases and bilirubin, either serious or non -serious and 
whether o r not causally related, meeting the laboratory criteria of a potent ial Hy’s Law case 
[ALT or AST ≥3 ×  ULN with simultaneous TBL ≥ 2 × ULN] should always be reported to the 
Sponsor using a SAVER form , in addition to reporting it in eCRF, with the Investigato r’s 
assessment of seriousness, causality, and a detailed narrative.  These events should be reported 
within 24 hours of Investigator ’s awareness of the event.  
If the subject discontinues study drug due to liver enzyme abnormalities, the subject will have 
additional clinical and laboratory evaluations  until clinically acceptable resolution  in order to 
determine the nature and severity of the potential liver injury.  
9.4. Adverse Event  
9.4.1.  Definition of Adverse Event  
An adverse event is a ny untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product  and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal labor atory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product (ICH E2A Guideline.  
Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Exped ited Reporting, Oct 
1994).  
It is the responsibility of Investigator s, based on their knowledge and experience, to determine 
those circumstances or abnormal lab oratory  findings which should be considered adverse events . 
9.4.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adver se event is a ny untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 Results in death,  
 Is life -threatening,  
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, 08 JUN 2021  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 88  Is a congenital  anomaly/birth defect, or  
 Is an important medical event.  
Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (ICH E2A Guideline.  Clinical 
Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Oct 1994).  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedi ted reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_849621].  Examples 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Note:   
 Procedure s are not AE s or SAE s, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or 
SAE.    
 Pre-planned (prior to signing the Informed Consent Form) procedures or treatment s 
requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31643] -existing conditions that do not worsen in severity 
are not SAEs.  
9.4.3.  Severity Assessment  
The following definitions should be used to assess in tensity of adverse events:  
 Mild: Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated, ie, does not interfere with 
subject’s usual function.  
 Moderate: Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity.  
 Severe: Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity, ie, interferes 
significantly with subject’s usual function.  
Severity vs. Seriousness:  Severity is used to describe the intensity of a specific event while the 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (suc h as severe headache).  
This is not the same as "seriousness," which is based on patient/event outcome at the time of the 
event.  
9.4.4.  Causality Assessment  
The Investigator  should assess causal relationship between an adverse event and the study drug 
on the basi s of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions.  The causality assessment 
must  be made based on the available information and can be updated as new information 
becomes available.

Reporting –Procedure For Investigator s 
All AEs, SAEs, including efficacy and safety endpoint s that will be adjudicated  will be reported 
in the CRF.  
In the event of a Medical Emergency, the Investigator  at the study site will institute any medical 
procedures deemed appropriate.  A [ADDRESS_1181419] where the following numbers ([ADDRESS_1181420]) 
are provided:  
 (primary number)  
 (alternati ve number)  
The medical call center will contact [CONTACT_849688].  
Serious events that are also efficacy endpoints ( such as VTE and PE ) and/or safety endpoints 
(such as bleeding events  that are not life -threatening or fatal ) will be e xempted from SAE 
processing and expedited reporting.  All efficacy and safety endpoints will be captured on 
specifically designed eCRFs .  These events are clinically anticipated events in the target 
treatment population, and will be periodically reviewed by [CONTACT_46927].  
The following types of events should be reported by  [CONTACT_46928] a Serious Adverse 
Event s Reporting ( SAVER ) form within 24 hours of awareness:  
 SAEs (see Section 9.4.2  for definition) , includin g life -threatening or fatal bleeds.  
 All SAEs resulting in death, regardless of whether they are waived endpoints for 
processing and expedited reporting, will be processed by [CONTACT_46929]'s global safety database.  
 Hepatic events meetin g combinat ion abnormalities [ALT or AST ≥ 3 × ULN with

Page 91 All events (serious and non -serious , including efficacy and safety endpoint events ) must be 
reported with Investigator ’s assessment of the event’s seriousness, severi ty, and causality to the 
study drug.  A detailed narrative summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, 
treatment, and outcome should be provided  where indicated .  Specific or estimated dates of event 
onset, treatment, and resolution shou ld be included when available.  Medical history, 
concomitant medications, and laboratory data that are relevant to the event should also be 
summarized in the narrative.  For fatal events, the narrative should state whether an autopsy was 
or will be perform ed, and include the results if available.  Source documents  (including medical 
reports ) will be retained at the  study center and should not be submitted to the Sponsor for SAE 
reporting purposes.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed prom ptly.  Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible within each follow -up.  
See Section  15.[ADDRESS_1181421]/Ethics Committee  
Daiichi Sankyo and/or CRO will inform Investigator s, Institutional Review Boards /Ethics 
Committees ( IRBs/ ECs), and regulatory authorities of any Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) occurring in other study centers or other studies of the 
investigational drug, as appropriate per local reporting requirements.   Daiichi Sankyo and/or 
CRO  will comply with any additional local safety reporting requirements.  
In the US, upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of S[LOCATION_003]Rs that  occurred with the study 
drug, unless delegated to the Sponsor, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility to inform the IRB per 
Sponsor’s instruction.  
In the European Economic Area (EEA) states, it is the Sponsor’s responsibility to report 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs to all ECs.  
9.7. Exposure In Utero During Clinical Studies  
Daiichi Sankyo must be notified of any subject who becomes pregnant while receiving  edoxaban  
and within [ADDRESS_1181422] using th e Exposure In Utero (EIU) Reporting form.  Please contact 
[CONTACT_148745] a pregnancy.  The 
Investigator  should make every effort to follow the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and 
complete the  EIU Reporting Form with complete pregnancy outcome information, including 
normal delivery and induced abortion.  The adverse pregnancy outcome, either serious or non -
serious, should be reported in accordance with study procedures.   If the outcome of the 
pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE ( ie, post -partum

anomaly, including that in an aborted fetus), the Investigator  should follow the pr ocedures for 
reporting SAEs outlined in Section 9.5.  
9.8. Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory evaluations will be shipped to a central 
laboratory for analysis.  Results of all clinical  laboratory tests will be reported in the subject’s 
eCRF or merged electronically with the clinical database.   
For the  Screening Visit (Visit 1)  samples taken as part of routine care outside study auspi[INVESTIGATOR_849623].   Only local 
laboratory results for qualification purpose will be entered in the EDC ( liver function test ( LFT), 
serum creatinine, platelets, aPTT and INR).  
9.8.1.  Hematology  
The e thylenediamine traacetic acid (EDTA) tube of blood will be drawn for th e hematology 
assessments listed in  Table  9.1.  These will be measured from samples obtained at the Screening

11.4.1.  Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on mITT Analysis Set .  Analyses will be based on 
the randomized treatment arm even if a subject inadvertently receives the incorrect study drug .  
The primary efficacy endpoint is an event driven and a composite endpoint including 
symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, death as result of VTE, and no change or 
extension of thrombotic burden from randomization to up to 3 months + [ADDRESS_1181426] event of the composite primary efficacy 
outcome will be analyzed using a Cox’s proportional hazard regression model including 
treatment arm and age groups as covariates.  Although this study is also stratified by [CONTACT_11338], 
region is not included in th e model as a covariate because some age groups within region s may 
be very small due to the small overall sample size .  The time to first event is defined as the time 
(days) from the day of randomization to the first event experienced by a subject during th e 3 
months + [ADDRESS_1181427] a primary efficacy outcome during the 3 
months + 3 days period will be censored at 3 months + [ADDRESS_1181428] ratio will be computed with 95% confidence interval (CI) (two -sided) based on this 
model.  Edoxaban will be considered non -inferior to comparator if the upper limit of the 95% CI 
is ≤1.5. 
If non -inferiority of edoxaban is es tablished, edoxaban will be tested for superiority to 
comparator.  Edoxaban will be considered superior to comparator if the upper limit of the 95% 
CI from above analysis is ≤1.0.  
To control study -wise type I error, the testing for non -inferiority and sup eriority will follow the 
plan as described below.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Analysis  of blee ding events  
An  analysis will be performed for the composite safety endpoint of  major and CRNM bleeding 
events which occur on -treatment from the first dose of study drug to 3 month s + [ADDRESS_1181434] dose of the study drug + [ADDRESS_1181435] permanently discontinued study drug prior to 
Month 3.   The analysis of this endpoint is based on an “on treatment” approach.  An event will 
be considered as an “on-treatment” event if  it occurred while on study drug or within 3 days of 
randomized study drug interruption or discontinuation.  
The time to “on -treatment” major and CRNM bleeding will be compared between treatment 
arms for subjects in the Safety Analysis Set, using  the same Cox proportional hazard s regression  
model as used for  the primary efficacy analysis.  Subjects who did not have an event will be 
censored at 3 days after the day of permanent study treatment discontinuation, or at 3 month + [ADDRESS_1181436] dose of study drug + [ADDRESS_1181437] corresponding event will be censored 30 days af ter the 
day of permanent study drug  discontinuation.  
Bleeding events will be summarized and analyzed for the following categories:  
 Major and CRNM bleeding  combined  
 Any bleeding (major, CRNM, and nuisance, combined)  
A sensitivity analysis will be conducted for major and CRNM bleeding, occurring while on -
treatment, from the date of the first dose of study drug to the date of the last dose of study drug + 
[ADDRESS_1181438] corresponding event will be 
censored 3 days after the day of permanent study drug discontinuation.  
The incidence of bleeding events will also be summarized by [CONTACT_849700] -treatment

Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_1181441] 140 subjects (about 50% of subjects) comp lete the 
first 3 months  of treatment.  This will allow for adjustment of number of subjects  in the study if 
necessary.  Because the sample size re -estimation will be based on overall event rate acrossing 
two treatment arms, no type I error adjustment is needed for this interim analysis. The detailed 
interim analysis will be specified in interim SAP (IASAP).  
11.5.1.  Independent Data Monitoring Committee  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee will monitor the safety  data throughout the study 
and inform the Study Steering Committee on fixed intervals and will be detailed in DMC charter.  
11.6. Sample Size Determination  
This is an event driven trial and the total number of subjects randomized to treatment may be 
adjusted to ensure accumulation of 68 events in the mITT Analysis Set during the Main 
Treatment Period.  
The sample size calculation is based on statistical approach and results of Hokusai  VTE study 
(DU176b -D-U305), a study of LMWH/edoxaban versus LMWH/warfarin in the treatment of 
acute VTE in adults .  An NI marg in of 1.5 (in hazar d ratio) is used in the Hokusai VTE study and 
was aimed at preserving 70% of warfarin effect in adult population .  A hazard ratio of 0.[ADDRESS_1181442] 3 mon ths is also observed in Hokusai 
VTE study.  
This pediatric study is designed to accumulate, approximately 68 overall primary efficacy events 
in the mITT Analysis Set during the Main Treatment Period .  Assuming that edoxaban group 
will observe a 24% relative reduction to SOC arm, a total of  68 events will give approximately a 
power of 80% to demonstrate that LMWH/edoxaban is non -inferior to the comparator, 
considering a relative non -inferiority margin for the hazard ratio of 1.5 (two -sided α=0.05).  
Based on the completed clinical trials  and literature review4, 14, 15, 16, 19, 22, 23, 24, 25, we expect an 
incidence of composite primary efficacy endpoint of 28% in the control arm during the Main 
Treatm ent Period.  Based on these estimates , 274 subjects (137 each arm) are expected to be 
randomized to study drug in order to accrue [ADDRESS_1181443] disposition, demographic and baseline characteristics, study drug 
exposure, and prior and concomitant medications.  The SAP will also include a description of 
how missing, unused, and spurious data will be addressed.  
To preserve the integrity of the statistical analysis and clinical study conclusions, the SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock.  
All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® Version 9.2 or higher.

investigations under a particular protocol, or for each child, as the  IRB deems appropriate. ”  In 
21 CF R 50.55 subpart g it states, “When the IRB determines that assent is required, it must also 
determine whether and how assent must be documented. ”  For this study, the IRB will determine 
the age that is appropriate for the assent .  Generally, this age averages at 7 years of age .  The IRB 
will also determine the verbiage that may be added, as well as ensure the document is written at a 
level understandab le to the population who will be signing the assent .  The IRB may also require 
separate assent forms based on the age groups ( ie, separate assent forms for subjects  7 to 12 
years and for subjects  13 to 17 years) to ensure the assents maintain their “maturity levels and 
understandability”.  
15.4. Regulatory Compliance  
The study protocol, subject information and consent form, the Investigator  Brochure, any subject 
written  instructions to be given to the su bject, available safety information, subject recruitment 
procedures ( eg, advertisements), information about payments and compensation available to the 
subjects , and documentation evidencing the Investigator ’s qualifications should be submitted to 
the EC or  IRB for ethical review and approval according to local regulations, prior to the study 
start.  The written approval should identify all documents reviewed by [CONTACT_152872].  
Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analysis will be documented in a  protocol 
amendment and/or the SAP.  
The Investigator  must submit and, where necessary, obtain approval from the EC or IRB for all 
subsequent protocol amendments and changes to the ICF.  The Investigator  should notify the EC 
or IRB of deviations from the pr otocol or SAEs occurring at the study center  and other AE 
reports received from the Sponsor/CRO, in accordance with local procedures.

Version 4.0, 08 JUN 2021  
 
Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 110 As required by [CONTACT_427], the Sponsor’s local Regulatory Affairs group or representative 
to whom this responsibili ty has been delegated will ensure all legal aspects are covered, and 
approval from  the appropriate regulatory bodies obtained, prior to study initiation, and that 
implementation of changes to the initial protocol and other relevant study documents happen 
only after approval by [CONTACT_184773].  
In the event of any prohib ition or restriction imposed ( eg, clinical hold) by [CONTACT_849708], or if the Investigator  is aware of any new  
information which might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the  investigational 
drug, the Sponsor  should be informed immediately.    
In addition, the Investigator  will inform the Sponsor  immediately of any urgent safety measures  
taken by [CONTACT_46960], and of  any 
suspected/actual serious  GCP  non-compliance  that the Investigator  becomes aware of.  
15.5. Protocol Deviations  
The Investigator  should conduct the study in compliance with the protocol agreed to by [CONTACT_46961], if required, by [CONTACT_46962] ( is), and which was given approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_849625]/ECs.  
A deviation to any protocol procedure or waiver to any stated  criteria will not be allowed in this 
study except where necessary to eliminate immediate hazard(s) to the subject.  Sponsor must be 
notified of all intended or unintended deviations to the protocol ( eg, inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
dosing, missed study v isits) on an expedited basis.  
The Investigator , or person designated by [CONTACT_737] , should document and explain any 
deviation from the approved protocol.  
If a subject was ineligible or received the incorrect dose or study  treatment, and had at least 1 
administration of study drug , data should be collected for safety purposes.  
If applicable, t he Investigator  should notify the IRB/IEC of deviations from the protocol in 
accordance with local procedures.  
15.6. Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Stud y 
When new information becomes available that may adversely affect the safety of subjects or the 
conduct of the study, the Sponsor will inform all Investigator s involved in the clinical study, 
ECs/IRBs, and regulatory authorities of such informatio n, and when needed, will amend the 
protocol and/or subject information.  
The Investigator  should immediately inform the subject whenever new information becomes 
available that may be relevant to the subject’s consent or may influence the subject’s willingne ss 
to continue participation in the study.  The communication should be documented on medical 
records, for example, and it should be confirmed whether the subject is willing to remain in the 
study.  
If the subject information is revised, it must be re -approved by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB.  The Investigator  
should obtain written informed consent to continue participation with the revised written 
information even if subjects were already informed of the relevant information.  The Investigator  
Protoco l DU176b -D-U312  
Version 4.0, [ADDRESS_1181448] at a particular study center (s) and/or in a 
particular region/country.  Sponsor approval of local amendments will be clearly documented.  
A protocol amendment may be imple mented after it has been approved by [CONTACT_1201]/EC and by 
[CONTACT_46965], unless immediate implementation of the change is 
necessary for subject safety.  
15.8. Study Termination  
The IDMC may recommend termination of the study.  Termination may be made for any of the 
following reasons:  
 Concern about significantly higher bleeding risk relative to one of the study arms,  
 Concern about drug -induced liver injury,  
 Any other safety concern based on benefit/risk evaluation.  
The IDMC will alert the Investigator /designee if there are any of the above concerns requiring 
protocol modifications or any other changes in the study.  
The details about the roles and responsibilities of the IDMC and guidelines and rules for 
monitoring the study safety data will b e described further in the IDMC charter.  
15.9. Independent Data Monitoring Committee  (IDMC)  
An IDMC  will be created to further protect the rights, safety, and well -being of subjects who will 
be participating in this study by [CONTACT_849709] .  The IDMC will comprise 
of qualified scientists, who are not Investigator s in the study and not otherwise directly 
associated with the Sponsor.  The IDMC will be described in detail in the IDMC Charter .  The 
IDMC will monitor data during the study.  All activities of the IDMC will be documented.  This 
documentation will include data summaries and analyses provided to the committee as well as 
minutes of the meeting.  The IDMC can recommend study or treatment regimen/group 
termination to a study oversight committee based on pre -specified concerns described in the 
IDMC Charter.

subjects permanently discontinued from study drug due to AEs, and subjects with efficacy 
endpoints such as VTE  and CV mortality, and all -cause mortality  etc.  The PK and safety data 
will be reviewed by [CONTACT_849710].  
An interim assessment of incidence rate of the composite efficacy endpoint in both arms of the 
study will take place after first 140 subjects (about 50% of subjects) complete the first 3 mont hs 
of treatment.  This will allow for adjustment of number of subjects  in the study if necessary.  
15.10.  Clinical Events Committee  
A blinded  independent study specific CEC will review and adjudicate key endpoint events : all 
deaths, VTEs , thrombotic burden , and o ther su spected efficacy endpoints, overt bleeding events 
that require medical attention, and liver enzyme abnormalities meeting predefined criteria 
(including all suspected clinical endpoint events from subjects who permanently discontinued 
study drug).  E ndpoints reported during telephone con tacts will also be adjudicated.   
An additional independent member s of the CEC will be a radiologist who will assess the baseline 
index VTE image and follow -up image at Month 3 and Month 12/  Discontinuation visit (if 
applicable).   Quantitative assessment of the change in thrombotic burden of the index VTE  will 
be made . 
The CEC will comprise qualified judges, who are not Investigator s in the study and not 
otherwise directly associated with the Sponsor.  The CEC judges wi ll remain blinded to 
treatment throughout the adjudication process and the study.  The CEC -adjudicated data will be 
used in the final efficacy and safety analyses.  The CEC and the events and radiologic images it 
will adjudicate will be detailed in the CEC  Charter . 
15.11.  Steering Committee /Executive Committee  
A Study Steering Committee will be created to provide clinical guidance on study 
implementation and conduct of the study, and interpretation of results as specified in the 
Committee Charter.  It will consist  of Principal Investigator (s), and key opi[INVESTIGATOR_849626] (as requested) , as well as designated Sponsor and CRO members.  
15.12.  Address List  
A list of key study personnel (including personnel at the sponsor, CRO, laboratories, and other 
vendors) and their contact [CONTACT_3031] (address, telephone, fax, email) will be kept on file and 
updated in the Study Reference Manual.

17.3. Effective Methods of Birth Control  
Women of childbearing age are defined as those women capable of conceiving, being pregnant 
with, and giving birth to children, and are eligible for the study based on the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria . 
Female subjects of childbearing poten tial must test negative for pregnancy at Screening with a 
highly sensitive test and must consent to avoid becoming pregnant by [CONTACT_46969].  
The following use of reliable method(s) of contraception, and/or ab stinence, for the duration of 
therapeutic product exposure is recommended:  
Highly effective methods of contraception, when used consistently and correctly, result in 
low failure rates.  These may include:  
 Combined (estrogen and progesterone -containing) hormonal contraception associated 
with inhibition of ovulation  
 Oral 
 Intravaginal  
 Transdermal  
 Progresterone -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
 Oral 
 Injectable  
 Implantable  
 Intrauterine Device (IUD)  
 Intrauterine Hormonal -Releasing System

Page 125  Bilateral Tubal Occlusion  
 Vasectomized partner  
 Sexual Abstinence  
Effective methods may include:  
 Barrier methods of contraception (eg, male condom, female condom, cervical cap, 
diaphragm, contraceptive sponge).   
Note: When used consistently a nd correctly, “double barrier ” methods of 
contraception (eg, male condom with diaphragm, male condom with cervical cap) 
can be used as an effective alternative to the highly effective contraception 
methods described above.  
Oral contraception is not contra indicated with edoxaban but maybe not recommended in patients 
with high risk of thromboembolic events .  The use of oral contraception is per investigator’s 
discretion . 
17.4. Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
The list here (in the protocol) is static and reflects the list at the time of the current version of the 
protocol .  If there are changes to this list during the study, the changes will not be considered a 
protocol amendment and the list in this appendix will not be updated unless the protocol is bein g 
amended for other reasons as well .   
Subjects on these drugs at the time of planned randomization will be excluded from the study .  
After randomization, use of these drugs will require a study drug permanent discontinuation 
unless advised otherwise in th e sections below .  The Investigator  is encouraged to contac t the 
Medical Monitor for further guidance.

17.4.6.  P-gp Inhibito rs List (Not Prohibited Medication but Requir es Dose Adjustment)  
Use of P-gp inhibitors during the treatment with edoxaban will require dose reduction either at 
randomization or during the course of the study . The only exemption from this rule is the use of 
amiodarone which will not require dose reduct ion. 
Below are examples (but not limited to)  the most commonly used P-gp inhibitors:

 Rifampin  
 Carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Tegretol®)  
17.5. Transition from Edoxaban to Other Anticoagulants  
Subjects who require anti coagulation at the end of study participation will be transitioned to 
standard -of-care treatment  as directed by [CONTACT_849714] . 
At the end of edoxaban treatment, the subject will receive the last dose of edoxaban and all 
remaining e doxaban tablets /bottles  will be collected from the subject by [CONTACT_6624].  
When transitioning from  edoxaban to VKA:  
Subjects transitioning to any VKA from edoxaban will have their INR recorded  at last study 
visit.  Bridging with heparin may occur during VKA titration until the INR  is at therapeutic level 
of between 2.0 and 3.0. 
INR will need to be measured as frequently as necessary until the INR target of ≥2 .0. Once the 
INR is ≥2.[ADDRESS_1181472] oral anticoagulant ( eg rivaroxaban, 
api[INVESTIGATOR_3822], dabigatran):  
 The first dose of the direct oral anticoagulant of choice will be given [ADDRESS_1181473] dose of edoxaban and will then be continued as per the novel anticoagulan t’s 
label.  
For subjects who do not complete the Main Treatment Period, they will be followed with 
monthly visits until the end of Month 3  plus a Follow -Up Visit  according to the Schedule of 
Events ( Table  17.1).  
For subjects who completed the Main Treatment Period but do not continue into the Extension 
Treatment Period, a Follow -Up Visit  (9) will occur 30 days after the Month 3 visit.  
For subjects who continue into the Extension Period, the Follow -Up Visit  will occur 30 days 
after the Discontinuation V isit.   
17.6. Management of Serious/Life -Threatening Bleeding  
The following steps are currently r ecommended26 for subjects with ongoing major bleeding (see 
Section  9.2.1 ): 
 Withhold study drug a nd all antiplatelets / anticoagulants  
 Institute SOC  for major bleeding (large bore IV or central venous line, type and 
crossmatch blood, admit to the intensive care unit, provide hemodynamic and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413])  
 Administer packed red blood cells (or w hole blood) as needed

Proprietary and Confidential  
Page 129  Administer antidotes if applicable  
For LMWH:    
The antidote for LMWH is protamine sulphate.  
The dose of protamine sulphate given is dependent upon the dose of LMWH administered and 
the time of administration.  
Suggestions from the S ponsor : 
If protamine is given within 8 hours of the LMWH then a maximum neutralizing dose is 1 mg 
protamine/100 units (or 1  mg) of LMWH given in the last dose.  
If more than [ADDRESS_1181474] passed since the dose of LMWH was given, administer 0.5 mg 
protamine per 1  mg (100 units) of LMWH given.  
Protamine is administered by [CONTACT_25726] (over 10 minutes ) to avoid a hypotensive 
reaction.   
Protamine is a medication that requires a high level of caution when being prescribed and 
administered.  Outside cardiac  surgery and ICU, consultant or fellow approval is required for the 
use of protamine - do not allow this to lead to delayed administration in the case of bleeding.  
Contact [CONTACT_46972].  
For Warfarin : 
Significant but not life -threatening bleeding: Administer Vitamin K 0.5 mg to 2 mg SC (NOT 
intramuscularly) plus FFP (20 mL/kg IV) to a maximum of 4 units.   
Major bleeding (any INR) or requiring emergency surgery doses if INR >8  
 Stop w arfarin  
 Vitamin K (30 µg/kg) IV, consider high er doses if INR >8  
 Prothrombin complex concentra te (PCC) replacement therapy (NB FFP gives inferior 
correction and is not recommended):  
 Beriplex® [4 -factor Prothrombin Complex Concentrate approved in several EU 
countries] (and Kcentra® approved in the US) (Discuss with on call 
haematologist)  
 Beriplex dosage is calculated based on the current INR and subject’s weight (see 
table below)  
 Repe at the INR following PCC  
 Further doses of Beriplex or Vitamin K may be required  
INR Approximate Dose  
2.0-3.9 1 mL/kg = 25 IU/kg  
4.0-6.0 1.4 mL/kg = 35 IU/kg  
>6.0 2 mL/kg = 50 IU/kg

Page 130 For Edoxaban :  
Although not evaluated in clinical trials, PCC, activated prothrombin complex concentrates 
(aPCCs), or recombinant Factor VIIa could be considered for the reversal of the anticoagulant 
effect of edoxaban.  In healthy volunteers, a 3 -factor PCC restored thrombin generation (AUC 
for thrombin generation cu rve) but did not normalize PT.  Thus, a 3 -factor PCC may be of some 
value in reversing anticoagulant effects of edoxaban (Study A -U150 ). 
A specific reversal agent for edoxaban is not available.  Although not evaluated in subjects , PCC  
(Beriplex® or Kcentra ®), aPCCs, or recombinant Factor VIIa could be considered for the 
reversal of the anticoagulant effect of edoxaban.  
The following are not expected to reverse the anticoagulant effects of edoxaban:  
 protamine sulfate,  
 vitamin K,   
 tranexamic acid.  
Hemodia lysis does not significantly contribute to edoxaban clearance.  
In the event of a Medical Emergency, the Investigator  at the study site will institute any medical 
procedures deemed appropriate.  A [ADDRESS_1181475] where the following numbers ([ADDRESS_1181476])

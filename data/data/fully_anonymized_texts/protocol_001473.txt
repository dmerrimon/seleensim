1.0 HYPOTHES IS AND O BJECTIV ES 
1.1 Hypothesis 
Due to the exquisite radios ensitivity of hum an papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509] (HPV)-a ssociat ed squam ous cell 
carcinoma ( HNS CC) of the head  and neck, patients who pres ent with this dis ease m ay be 
currently "over-treate d" using tradition al chemor adiotherapy regim ens and c an effectively b e 
treated with de-int ensified str ategies which result i n improved tolerabi lity and e nhan ced quality of 
life wi thout compromisi ng disease contr ol or overall survival.

cance rs, accounti ng for approxim ately 6% of all ma lignanci es. Each year, more than 500,000 
new cas es are di agnosed worldwid e. For the 60% of patients pres enting with locally adv anced 
(stages  III and IV) HNSCC, c he moradiotherapy has be en established as a definitive tre atment 
option throu gh the publication of notable p hase I II trials (B rizel 199 8; Adels tein 2003; D ennis 
2004; B ourhis 2012). Ho wever, opi[INVESTIGATOR_284810] c hemotherapy 
remain divid ed, particularly wi th regard to which chemo therapy dr ugs to use a nd how to optimall y 
integrate them wi th radiation ther apy. Moreover, attention has focus ed on ide ntifying the 
appropriate radiati on dose giv en that the a ccepted sta nda rds have remai ned at the same level for 
more than [ADDRESS_347738] clinical a nd molecul ar charac teristics (Braak huis 2005, 
Licitra 2006; Gil lison 2008; Weinberger 2006). Wh ile HPV-neg ative HNSCC i s charac terized by a 
multi tude of genetic al terations invol ving del etions or methylation of tumor-s uppre ssor genes 
and/or activation of tumor-prom oting oncogenes, HPV- positive HNS CC is largely devoid of man y 
of these ge netic abe rrations. This may be linked to the tr ansformi ng potential of high-risk H PV 
(e.g. HPV-16), which throu gh two viral oncopr oteins, E6 a nd E7, inactivate two hum an tumor- 
suppre ssor proteins, p53 and pR b, respectively. Research is now showi ng that the distinct 
genetic profil es between H PV-posit ive and H PV-negative HNS CC underli ne not only di fferences 
related to the pathogenesis of this dis ease, but also di fferences with respect to prognosis and 
treatment response ( Slebos 2006; Schlec ht 2007; Klussm an 2009). For instance, data has 
emer ged that patients with HPV-positive HNS CC have a signific antly improv ed prognosis, with at 
least half the risk of death fr om cancer, com pared to their HPV-negative cou nterparts (Fakhry 
2008; K ong 2008; Kum ar 2008;  Settle 20 09; Rischin 2 010; Hon g 2010). Additi onally, evid ence is 
accumul ating that HPV-rela ted HNS CC is exquisitely more s ensit ive to the effects of radiation 
therapy (Lind el 2001; Lassen 2009; Ang 2 010; Fischer 2010). Indeed, pre- clinical and clinical 
studies have dem onstrat ed di fferential rates of res ponse to irradiation betwe en HNS CC fr om 
HPV-positive a nd HPV-negative settin gs (Spanos 200 9; Gupta 2009; W illiams 2009 ). 
 
This rec ogniti on that HPV-positive HNSCC respo nds favorably to radiation therapy has prom pted 
investigators to s uggest t hat patien ts with these c ancers mi ght be “over-treate d” and 
unnece ssaril y s ubjected to the toxicity of intensi ve chemor adiotherapy wi th excessively hi gh 
radiation doses. Wh ile it h as been pro posed that tr eatment should be individual ized for patients 
with HPV-related HNSCC, the specific recomm endat ions on how to do so are non-existent. T he 
proposed clinical t rial, which will treat patients with HPV- positive HNS CC using radiation doses 
approxim ately 10- 15% less than historically used, would be the fi rst to indivi dualize radiation for 
HNS CC based on the biologic al characteristics of the tumor.

Single-insti tution phase II trials (Adels tein  2006; Brocks tein 2004) of aggressiv e 
chemor adiotherapy protocols have re ported th at distant metastasis has emer ged as the mos t 
comm on cause of tr eatment failure, even among patients w ho have HPV- positive HNSCC 
(Maxwell 2010). T hese data have rekindled interest in the p otential use of in duction 
chemotherapy in conj unction with definitive c oncurrent treatment in an e ffort to further improv e 
surviv al by [CONTACT_284852] m etastases. 
 
Prospective trials ( Mach tay 2002; Kies 2010; Posner 2007; Vermork en 2007)  have demonstrated 
encouraging o utcomes using in ducti on chem otherapy followed by c oncu rrent chemor adiotherap y 
for locally adv anced HNSC C. In previ ously untreated patients, overall res ponse rates of 70% to 
90% and compl ete response rates of 30% to 60% have be en repr oduci bly re ported after 
combi nation chemotherapy r egim ens (Salama 2008). T he impress ive sensit ivity to c hemotherapy 
has suggested t he poss ibility that this tre atment modality mi ght decrease dista nt metastasis and 
improve local-region al control, org an preservatio n, and overall su rvival. Notably, induction 
chemotherapy i s includ ed in National Comprehensi ve Canc er Network guideli nes for the 
treatment  of loca lly advanc ed HNS CC and i ts administr ation before concurrent 
chemor adiotherapy has become in creasingly a ccepted as a means  for effective eradication of 
systemic mi crometastases. Although many of the earli er tested regimens included 5-fl ourouraci l 
as a com ponent  of the i nduction regim en, in recent yea rs, taxane-bas ed chem otherapy has 
emer ged as a prefe rred str ategy in t he induction s etting f or HNS CC due to its activity and 
improv ed tolerabi lity. 
 
Investig ators fro m Vande rbilt Unive rsity (Cmel ak 2007)  reported on 44 patien ts with locall y 
advanced HNS CC treated by 3 cy cles of pacli taxel (175 mg/m 2) and car boplatin (A UC, 6-7.5) 
every three weeks fo llowed by [CONTACT_284853]. T he clinical response rate to 
induction c hemotherapy was 89%, includi ng a 51% compl ete response ra te. The most comm on 
grade 3+ comp lication du ring inducti on chemotherapy was ne utropenia which develop ed in 68% 
of the patie nts. The 2-year loc al control, progre ssion-free su rvival, and overall survival were 82%, 
77%, a nd 71%, res pectively. As im portantly, no signific ant difference in progressi on-free surviva l 
or organ-preservation w as noted between c oncu rrent regim ens using cispl atin/pac litaxel or 
carbopl atin/paclitaxel. Ho wever, due to the improv ed toxicity profile wi th the latter regim en, this 
was adopted as more “practic al for use in t he comm unity setting.” Investi gators fro m the 
University of Chic ago (Vok es 2003) also r eported on 69 patie nts treated by [CONTACT_284854] 6 cycles of w eekly carboplatin (AU C, 2) and pacli taxel (135 m g/m2) followed 
by [CONTACT_284855] c hemor adiotherapy. T he overall resp onse rate to inducti on chemotherapy was 
92%, wi th 35% of pati ents having a compl ete clinical res ponse. The most common grade 3+ 
toxicity during the i nducti on phase was ne utropenia which develo ped in 18% of the po pulation. 
 
Based on enc ouragi ng single-insti tutional data, t he Eas tern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) conducted a prospective p hase II trial (23 99) in which 111 p atients wi th stage III/IV 
HNS CC
 receiv ed [ADDRESS_347740] atin (AUC, 6) 
and paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2) followed by [CONTACT_284856] (30 mg/m 2) weekly wi th radiation 
therapy to 70 Gy (Cmel ak 2007). Wi th a median foll ow-up of 37 m onths, the 2-year r ates of 
organ prese rvation and overall survival were 81% and 76%, respectively, which com pared 
favor ably to his torical c ontrols am ong patie nts treated by [CONTACT_284857] c hemor adiotherapy . 
The clinical response rate was 65% after induction chem otherapy (includi ng 82% for HPV- 
positive tumors). Fur thermor e, no patie nt progre ssed  du ring the inducti on phase of tr eatment, 
and i ts use did not preclude s ubsequent delivery of concu rrent c hemor adiotherapy. T hese 
studies have sho wn inducti on chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_284855] c hemor adiotherapy is a 
promisi ng approach which m ay enhance distant co ntrol and improve treatm ent tolerability whil e 
maintaining hi gh rat es of loc al-regional control. Conse quently, it is now comm only a ccepted that 
a
 course of in ducti on chem otherapy with carbopl atin and pac litaxel is active and well-tolerated

without compromisi ng the ability to adminis ter subsequent intensive chemoradiotherapy. As a 
result of the published data in support of this str ategy, the ECOG regim en is increasingly us ed 
both as protoc ol and non-protocol treatm ent for patients with stage III/IV he ad and nec k cancer. 
 
Another in creasingly rec ognized benefit of this appr oach is the ability of in ducti on chemotherapy 
to help stratify p atients to a dditional therapy. Since the tumor can be assessed in vivo, various 
investigators have sho wn that induction c hemotherapy c an serve as a predictive tool, allowing 
appropriate selection of the definitive m anagem ent strategy. F or instance, investigators from the 
University of Michig an rece ntly reported a p hase II trial of 66 patie nts with stage III/IV HNS CC in 
which one cycle of platinum- based induction c hemotherapy was us ed to stratify subs equent local 
therapy. Responders to induction c hemotherapy were subseq uently selec ted for concurrent 
chemor adiotherapy and non-responders proc eeded to surgery (Wor den 2008). Al though the 
limited size of the st udy made it di fficult to draw definitive conclu sions, the f easibi lity of thi s 
approac h, particularly f or patients with HPV- positive HNS CC (in which t he ra te of response to 
induction c hemotherapy was 93%) w as dem onstr ated.  
 
2.2 Toxicity of Concu rrent Chemor adiotherapy 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] t rials docum enting a be nefit to concurrent chemoradiotherapy in both the definitive a nd 
postoperative setti ngs, it is im portant to note that this str ategy (particularly wi th high dose 
cisplati n) significantly in creases toxicity com pared wi th radiation therapy alo ne (Trotti 2003; 
Berni er 2005; Garden 2008). In particular, acute mucositis and dysph agia are e nhanced with the 
additi on of concu rrent chem otherapy. High dose cisplatin also c auses constit utional and 
systemic toxicities that are well recogniz ed and i ndependent of the concomi tant administr ation of 
radiation therapy. It is th eoreti cally po ssible th at these systemic tox icities might interfere wi th the 
ability of pati ents to tolerate and receive maximally e ffective dose int ensity of r adiation therapy in 
an unin terrupted fashion. F or instanc e, the gra de 3+ acute toxicity r ate on RTOG 99-14, which a ll 
patients receiv ed radiation therapy wi th concu rrent cisplatin was 79%, the most co mmon of whic h 
were rel ated to mucositis a nd eso phagitis (Ang 2 005). Similarly, in an analysis of l ate toxicity of 
patients tre ated on [ADDRESS_347741] atin for HNS CC by [CONTACT_111557], Machtay et a l 
reported that 43% ex perienc ed grade 3+ l ate toxicity rel ated to laryn geal and/or es ophageal 
dysfunction ( Mach tay 2008). T he toxicity of radiation therapy, in a ggregate, has been s hown to 
contribute to signific ant quality of life burden with respect to physical a nd psyc hosocial functioni ng 
(Lang endijk 2008 ). These data sugges ts that concu rrent chemoradiotherapy has eclips ed the 
limits of acceptab l e s hort- a nd long-term toxicity, a nd that attem pts to reduce r adiation dose i n 
appropriately selected patients are wa rranted. 
 
Although taxane-bas ed chemoradiotherapy regim ens appear  to improve toxicity, the rates of 
comp lications are no netheless high. S untharalingam et al report ed that the rates of ac ute grade 
3 mucositis and dysp hagia were 70% and 33%, respectively, am ong patients treat ed by 
[CONTACT_284858] (Suntharalin gam 2000) . 
Similarly, Cmel ak et al reported grade 3+ acute mucositis in 47% of patients compl eting 
concu rrent radiation wi th carboplatin and pacli taxel at Van derbilt University (Cmel ak 2007). For 
patients tre ated by [CONTACT_284859] 2399, 49% develop ed 
grade 3+ acute mucositis and 4 0% were G-tube de pendent at end of treatment (Cmelak 2007).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_347742] im portant predic tor of radiati on response that HPV 
staining is now r outinely perform ed for prognostic purpos es both in the comm unity and in 
academic s ettings. Notably, when patie nts from the ECOG 2399 trial were exami ned by [CONTACT_25553] V 
status  (Fakhry 200 07), patients with HPV-positive tumors had signific antly higher response rates 
after induction c hemotherapy (8 2% versus 55%) and af ter chemor adiotherapy (8 4% vs. 57%). 
With a median follow- up of 39 m onths, patie nts with HPV-posit ive tumors had signific antly 
improv ed 2-year overall survival (95% vs. 62%), progression-free survival ( 86% vs. 53%) , and a 
64% lower risk of death com pared to patien ts with HPV- negative tumors. Similarly, recent da ta

published from the Radi ation T herapy Oncol ogy Group (RTOG) c onfirm ed a dram atic difference 
in 3-year rates of local-regi onal c ontrol (86% vs. 65%) and overall su rvival (82% vs. 57%) 
be
tween 433 patie nts with HPV-positive a nd H PV-negative phenotypes treated pros pectively b y 
chemor adiotherapy (Ang 2 010). Interestingly, the risk of dis tant metastasis for HPV-posit ive and 
HPV-neg ative tumors in patients recei ving upfr ont concurrent c hemor adiot herapy was observ ed 
to be similar, a ffecti ng 10% and 13% of patients, res pectively. This observati on further suggests 
that a sequential treatm ent strategy uti lizing inducti on chemotherapy p rior to chemor adiotherap y 
for patients with H PV-positive HNSCC may be particula rly applic able. Table [ADDRESS_347743] dem onstrated, qui te 
paradoxica lly, that transfer of the E 6/E7 genes or gene produc ts into cells tends to increase 
radiation resistanc e, not decrease it as might be expec ted (Hampson 20 01). Similarly, 
experim ents designed to abrogate p [ADDRESS_347744] ics, rather 
than the virus itself, m ediates radios ensitivity (DeW eese 1997). In deed, several rec ent studies 
have sug gested that radiati on therapy e nhances the host imm une response to viral antigens 
which are expre ssed  on tum or (Rajjoub 2007; Wansom 2010). 
 
Regardless of the underlying mec hanisms res ponsible f or HPV-m ediated radiores ponse, 
preclinical work have c onfirmed the exquisi te radiosensiti vity of HPV- positive HNS CC. Gup ta et 
al perform ed clonogenic surviv al assays of HPV-positive and HPV-ne ga tive cell- lines after 
exposure to vario us doses of radiati on and showed that the form er are c harac terized by [CONTACT_284860] (G upta 2009). Prelimi nary data from the Unive rsity of Ca lifornia, Davi s 
(Chen 2011), using a m odel sys tem from axi al imaging studies obtained serially duri ng the course 
of radiati on therapy to observe i n vivo patter ns of tum or response sim ilarly showed that HPV- 
positive HNS CC tends to regress early during treatm ent, reachi ng a plateau by [CONTACT_284861] 5-6, 
sugge sting that r adiation doses can possible be reduc ed (Figure 1).

esophageal, re ducing the radiation dose in selected p atients with more favorable biology (e.g. 
HPV-positive tumors) is an attractive option. Numerous pros pective and r etrospective da ta have 
demonstr ated consistent dose-response relati onshi ps predicti ng toxicity for organs involved i n 
salivary productio n, swallowing, and mucos al integrity (Eisbruch 1999; Chao 2001, Feng 20 07; 
Narayan 2008). F or xerostomi a, it has been long known th at the abi lity to k eep m ean parotid 
dose below 26 Gy will signific antly reduce the incidence of hyposa livation and preserve qua lity of 
life (Deasy 2010). Normal tissue  comp lication pr obability m odels have observed th at for every 1 
Gy in m ean dose, the likelihood of xeros tomia in creases by [CONTACT_79938] 5% at 1 ye ar after 
radiation therapy (Dijkema 2008 ). An in creasing am ount of data i s similarly showi ng that dose to 
anatomic al struc tures thought to be responsible f or swallowing is of critical importance in 
predicting acute and l ate toxicity from chemor adiotherapy ( Eisbruch 20 04). For instance, 
published d ata from the University of Ca lifornia Davis showed th at minimizing dose to the 
constric tor muscles, cer vical esop hagus, and cricopharyngeal inlet may decrease the incid ence of 
dysphagi a, esophageal stric ture, and gastrostomy- tube de pendence (Chen 2009; Li 2009) . 
Between [ADDRESS_347749] or muscles/cricopharynge al inlet and the probability of late gra de 3+ dysph agia 
as defined as gastros tomy-tube dependence (Fi gure 2). T hese data are c onsiste nt with published 
literature demonstr ating that the threshold f or radiation-induced long- term dysp hagia likely exists 
at approxim ately 55 to 60 Gy, a nd dependent on dose-volume e ffects (Table 3). With res pect to 
clinical mucositis, pros pective data from t he University of Ca lifornia Davis showed th at limiting the 
maximum dose to the oral cavity to less than 40 Gy significantly reduc ed the 
incidence of acute mucositis during chemoradiot herapy ( Narayan 20 08). Notably none  of the 
patients who receiv ed an oral cavity dose of less than 40 Gy develop ed grade 2+ mucositi s 
compared to 50% of pati ents who receiv ed a dose of gr eater  than 40 Gy (Figure 3). Additio nally, 
it is in creasingly recogniz ed the limiting radiati on dose to ti ssues  such as the parotid gl and, 
swallowi ng struc tures, and or al cavity translates into improv ed quality of life ( Nguyen 2005; 
Lang endijk 2008; Lin 2003). 
 
The recogniti on that pati ents wi th HPV-relat ed HNSCC fare e xceptionally well have led som e

is exquisitely s ensitive to the e ffects of radiation therapy. We hy pothesize that by e ffectively

reduction in side effects—particularly acute mucositis and es ophagitis side effects—resulti ng in 
improv ed quality of life wh ile mai ntaining hi gh rates of disease co ntrol and overall survival. B y 
potentially decreasing toxicity without lo wering cure rates, de-intensific ation of radi ation dose for

benefit from si gnific ant radiation dose de-int ensification in the c oncurrent chemor adiotherap y 
phase of tr eatment. The rationale f or this risk-adapted approach to local t herapy based on HPV 
status  is to adminis ter effective compr ehensi ve tre atment individ ualized at dia gnosis and after 
assessm ent of response to induction c hemotherapy (f or patients with HPV- positive tumors), thus 
avoidi ng unnece ssary and potenti ally toxic tre atment, and hence optimizing the ther apeutic rati o. 
 
2.6.1  Selecti on of the treat ment  arm f or HPV- positive HNS CC 
The induction chemotherapy regim en was c hosen based on s tudies from ECOG and Van derbilt 
University, showing high rat es of res ponse to carboplatin a nd paclitaxel (Hainsworth 2002; 
Cmelak 2007). T he radiati on regim en has not been rigorously tes ted in a multi-insti tutional 
setting. However, investiga tors from the University of Chicago treated 64 patien ts with locall y 
advanced HNS CC (HPV-status undetermi ned) to a reduced dose of 54 Gy to are as considered 
“high-risk” f or microscop i c dis ease af ter induction c hemotherapy and report ed that the reductio n 
in radiation dose did n ot compromise surviv al or disease c ontrol com pared to historic al controls 
treated using hig her radiati on dos es (Haraf 2003). More recently, r etrospective d ata from the 
University of Ca liforni a, Davis, has sho wn that HPV-positive tumors have regre ssed in entirety as 
determined by [CONTACT_284863] 50 Gy of r adiation. As suc h, for this trial, 
patients wi th and witho ut a response to inducti on chem otherapy will receive doses of 54 and 60 
Gy, res pectively, which represents a 23% and 14% reduction in radiation dose, res pectively , 
compared to the st andard of 70 Gy ( Chen, in pre ss). Since weekly administr ation of carboplati n 
and paclitaxel has his torically been giv en concu rrently wi th radiation after inductio n 
chemotherapy, we chose to adminis ter these ag ents in the same fashi on for this Phase I/II trial. 
The regim en us ed by [CONTACT_1345] [ADDRESS_347752] inducti on chem otherapy strateg y 
and will serve as the basis for explor atory com paris on analys es (Cmel ak 2007). Since HPV has 
been  increasingly sho wn to aff ect ce llular resp onse to radiatio n, this phase I/ II trial tests the 
hy
pothesis that radiati on dose de-in tensification for HPV- positive p atients wi th locally adv anced 
(stage III and IV) HNSCC will decrease toxicity wh ile maintaining progre ssion-free survival.

• Region-of-i nterest (RO I) or “clip box” f or fusion should be set to encom pass the PTV HD an d 
adjacent spi[INVESTIGATOR_34407] d; if the supracla vicular region is a part of the target volum e, the ROI shoul d 
extend to the C6 level; 
• If the fusion software allows t he user to create an irr egular ROI (e. g. ExacTra c), treatment room 
objec ts seen on in-room X-rays s hould be e xcluded from the r egistr ation; 
• Both m anual  (e.g. based on bony anatomy) and automatic (e.g. based on m utual inform ation) 
types of registrati on can be us ed; the result of the fusi on must be visually c heck ed for the 
alignment of the bony a natomy, such as vertebr al bodi es and applicable surgic al clips and sof t 
tissue  struc tures (e.g. optic nerves and/ or optic chiasm). 
• Followi ng the r egistratio n, the translational and (if the appropriate technology is availabl e) 
rotational corrections s hould be appli ed to the tre atment couch. If all the variances are less th an 
2.5 mm ( this typi[INVESTIGATOR_284815]), the 
treatment can proce ed without correcti on (however, the physi cian/team may elect to perfor m 
adjustm ents even for a vari ance < 2.5 mm). If one or more co rrections are 2.5-5 mm, adjustm ent 
is nece ssary pri or to treatm ent; however, reim aging is not mandato ry. If one or more of the 
correcti ons are larg er than [ADDRESS_347770] be repeat ed in additi on to performi ng

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Radiation Dose to the Patient fr om IG RT 
Available peer reviewed literature estim ates the patie nt dose within and outside of the target 
region wh en IGRT is us ed to co rrect positioning to vary c onsiderably. This i s the case when th e 
same im aging hardware is us ed wi th x-ray techniq ue and wi th different data g athering 
procedures. T he dose va riation is even gre ater when differ ent imaging equipm ent is us ed. The 
estim ated doses are in the range of 1 mGy f or 2D systems such as the BrainLab’s ExacTrac 
system or either the Va rian or Elek ta kV sys tems us ed for orthogo nal imaging. These doses are 
small com pared with doses from MV portal im aging and kV or MV conebeam CT. T he doses from 
helical MVCT scanni ng with a tom otherapy unit are estim ated to be in ran ge from [ADDRESS_347771] were r eported to be in range from 10 cGy f or a pelvi s

(PRV) spi[INVESTIGATOR_181589]. T he PRVcord = cord + 5 mm in each dim ension. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Brainstem: The in ferior most portion of the brains tem is at the cranial-cerv ical juncti on 
where it m eets the spi[INVESTIGATOR_34407] d. For the pur poses of this s tudy, the superior most portion of the 
brains tem is approxim ately at the lev el of the top of the posterior clinoid. The brains tem shall be 
defined based on the tr eatment planning CT scan.  In addition, t he PRVbrains tem = brainstem + 3 
mm in each dim ension. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lips and Oral Cavity: These should be co ntoured as 2 separate struc tures as the goal is 
to keep the lip dose much low er than the or al cavity dos e. The definition of li ps is self- 
explanatory. T he oral ca vity will be defi ned as a com posite struc ture consisting of t he anterior ½ 
to 2/3 of the or al tongue/flo or of mouth,  buccal mucos a, and pala te. The oral cavity OAR s hould 
not overl ap any PTV. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Parotid Glands: Parotid glands will be defi ned based on the treatment planning CT scan.  
The objective i s to limit the mean dose to at l east one gland to less than 24 Gy; al ternatively at 
least 20 cc of the combined volume of both par otid glands to <[ADDRESS_347776] 50% of one gl and 
to <30 Gy. Both de ep and s uperfici al lobes of the parotid gla nds are contour ed as one struc ture. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharynx: This will be defin ed as the “uninvolve d” posterior pharynge al wall plus adjace nt 
constric tor muscles. This ex tends  from the superi or constric tor region (the inferi or pterygoid 
plates level) to the cricopharyngeal inlet (posterior cricoid cartil age level). This sh ould not ove rlap 
the PTVs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Cervical Esophagus: This will be defin ed as a tubular struc ture that starts at the bo ttom of 
OARpharynx and ex tends to the thoracic inlet. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Glottic/Supragl ottic Larynx (GSL): This will be defi ned as a “triangul ar prism s haped”  
volume that begi ns just in ferior to the hyoid bo ne and extends  to the cricoid cartila ge inferiorl y 
and extends from the anterior commi ssure to in clude the aryt enoids. This includes the infrahyoi d 
but not suprahyoid epi[INVESTIGATOR_284817]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Mandible: This in cludes the entire bony struc ture of the m andible from T MJ through th e 
symphysis. It i s recognized that in many cases, this m ay overlap with CTVs and PTVs.

[IP_ADDRESS]  Brain: Contour the brain f or all cases. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Eyes: Contour the globes and l ens for all cases. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Optic Ne rves and Chiasm: Contour for all cases. Care should be giv en to contour optic 
nerves throu gh the optic canal in co ntinuity with the chiasm. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Unspecified Ti ssue O utside the Targ ets: This will be defi ned as tissue loc ated betwe en 
the skull base and thoracic inl et that is not includ ed in eith er the target volum es or the normal 
tissues  described abov e. 
6.5.2  Dose C onstraints to Norm al Struc tures 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_35406]: The PRVcord ( as defined i n Secti on 6. 5) should not e xceed 45 Gy to an y 
volume in e xcess of 0.03 cc ( approxim ately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm). The spi[INVESTIGATOR_284818] s hould 
not exceed [ADDRESS_347778] prio rity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Brainstem: The PRVcord ( as defined i n Section 6.5) should n ot exceed 48 Gy to any 
volume in e xcess of 0.03 cc ( approxim ately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm) unless the skull base i s 
included in CTV HD. When the skull base is tre ated, the PRVbrains tem (as defined i n Secti on 6.5) 
should not e xceed 52 Gy to any volume in e xcess of 0.03 cc ( appr oxim ately 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 
mm). In treatment planni ng, the PRVbrains tem should be giv en the same prio rity as the PRVcor d. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Lips: Reduce the dose as much as possibl e. The mean dose should be < 20 Gy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Oral Cavity: Reduce the dose as much as poss ible. T he mean dose should be < 30 Gy if 
feasibl e. Efforts should be made to avoid hot spots (> 60 Gy) within the oral cavity. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Parotid Glands: The goal i s keep t he m ean dose to at l east o ne parotid gla nd to < 24 G y. 
Addition al planni ng goals may in clude: 1) At least 50% of one par otid will receive < 30 Gy; and/or

7.2 Adve rse Eve nt Definitio ns 
7.2.1  Adve rse Even ts (AEs) 
Definition of an AE: Any unfavorable a nd unintended sign (including an ab norm al laborator y 
finding), sym ptom, or disease temporally a ssociat ed with the use of a m edical treatm ent or 
procedure r egardless of whether  it is consider ed related to the medical treatm ent or proc edure 
(attribution of unrelat ed, unlikely, po ssible, pr obable, or defini te). 
 
7.2.2  Serio us Adve rse Eve nts (SAEs)  
Definition of an SAE: Any adve rse experience occurring during any part of pr otocol treatm ent 
and 30 days after that resul ts in any of the followi ng outcomes: 
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threateni ng (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of death at the time o f 
the event. It does not refer to an event which hy pothetically mi ght have c aused death if it 
were more severe). 
• Requir es inpatie nt hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284819] 
• Results in pe rsistent or signific ant disability or incapacity. (Disabi lity is defined as a 
substanti al disruption of a pe rson’s abi lity to c onduct norm al life functi ons). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defec t. 
• Is a medically im portant event. This refers to an AE th at may not result in deat h, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be consider ed serious 
when, based on appropriate m edical judgm ent, may jeopardize the p atient, requir e 
medical or surgical i nterventi on to prev ent one of the o utcomes listed abov e, or involves 
suspected transmi ssion via a m edicinal pro duct of an infecti ous agent. 
 
7.2.3  Intensity (Severity) of the Adve rse Eve nt 
The intensity or severity of adve rse even ts should be graded a ccording to the NCI-CTC AE

7.3 Study Tr eatment Adverse Events 
 
Grade 3-4 therapy-induc ed mucositis an d/or dysphagia, which are enh anced by [CONTACT_284870], ar e 
expected to devel op in abo ut one-half of patie nts. Nutriti onal evaluati on pri or to the initiati on of 
therapy f or a prophylactic gastros tomy (PEG) tube placem ent is highly recommended. Placem ent 
of a f eeding tu be should b e recor ded, as should use of a f eeding tube during and af ter treatment 
(e.g., greater than or less than 50% of nutriti on by [CONTACT_181616]). Other comm on radiation adve rse events 
include: fatigu e, weig ht loss, regional alo pecia, xerostomi a, hoars eness, tr ansient ear discomfor t, 
d
ysgeusi a, and skin eryt hema and desquam ation within the treatm ent fields. A pr oportion of 
patients may r equire i ntravenous  fluid su pport secondary to deh ydration, and this s hould be 
docum ented.  
 
Less co mmon long-term tre atment adverse events in clude: hypo thyroidism, loss of hearing, 
chronic swa llowing dysf unction requiring perm anent  feeding tube, and ce rvical fibrosis. Much les s 
comm on radiati on adve rse eve nts includ e: mandibul ar osteoradio necrosis (< 5% incidence), and 
cervical myelop athy (< 1% wi th restriction of spi[INVESTIGATOR_181586] ≤ 45 Gy).

8.2 Pre-F DG Injection: Patient Preparati on 
Height and weight will be recorded before each PET scan. Patien ts will obse rve a four to six- 
hour fasti ng period prior to FDG injectio n. Patients with a his tory of m edically controll ed dia betes 
will be counseled to check seri al blood sugars p rior to each scan to ensure th at valu es averag e 
below 2 00 mg/dL.  For these patients, a blo od sugar measurem ent will be perform ed after a six- 
hour fast to gauge fasting toleranc e. Serum glucose c oncentration will be m easur ed for all 
patients pri or to scanni ng and must be less th an 200 m g/dL to proceed to imaging.

8.7 Functional Im aging Adve rse Events 
There is a negligible risk of ex posure to radiati on from PET im aging. Less likely adve rse events

a cytologic samp ling of the node is negative. Po st-treatment “planned” neck di ssecti on  will be 
defined as being perform ed for residual disease and wi thin 20 w eeks ( 140 days) of compl etion of 
radiotherapy. Po sitive neck s pecim ens remov ed within 140 days will be c onsidered part of t he

after compl etion of therapy. T he nature of the surgic al resecti on will be dic tated by [CONTACT_284875]. The operation will be con ducted using a ccep ted criter ia for primar y 
surgic al treatm ent of the cancer. 
 
Tissues  for pathologic eval uation of margi ns should be taken from the patient (rather th an the 
surgic al specim en itself). However, the s pecim en itself s hould be mark ed at sites correspondi ng 
to the eval uated margi ns in or der to assess samp ling e rror in obtaini ng clear margins. If gros s

lesion is pres ent at baseline all lesio ns up to a maxim um of five lesions t otal representative of al l 
involved organs should be identifi ed as target lesions and will be recorded and m easured at 
basline. Tar get lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with t he longes t 
diam eter), be repres entative of all involv ed organs, but i n addition, should be those that lend 
themselves to reproducible repeat ed measurem ents. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete Response ( CR): Complete disappear ance of all m easur able disease and 
target le sions In the absence of any new lesi ons. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Partial Response (PR ): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diam eters of tar get 
lesions, taking as refer ence the baseline sum diam eters. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Stable Dis ease: Neith er sufficient shrink age to quality f or PR n or sufficient increase to 
quality for progressi on, taking as refer ence t he sma llest sum diam eters while on study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression: At l east a 2 0% increase in the sum of diam eters of tar get lesions, taking as 
reference the sma llest s um on st udy (this inclu des the baseli ne sum if that is the sma llest on 
study). In additi on to the relative in crease of 20%, the sum must also demonstr ate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: t he appearance of one or more new le sion is a lso considered

12.3.
5 Determination of Response af ter Induction Che motherapy 
Evalu ation of response to i nducti on chem otherapy will be perform ed via physical exami nation 
(including direct endo scopic evaluation). R epeat biopsi es are n ot recomm ended.  Palpation of 
the neck to determine resp onse of lym phadenopath y is also require d. In cas es where the tre ating 
physici an is uncer tain whet her clinical compl ete response has occurred, a CT scan  may be use d, 
but this n ot require d. A pati ent will be c onsidered to have compl ete response to induction 
chemotherapy if there is no visible or palpable tumor.

tumor either on clinical or radiographic (CT scan  or MRI) exami nation. The PET portion of a 
PET/CT scan i s i nvesti gational and therefore s hould not be us ed in determining a patient’s 
response to treatment for purposes of eval uating efficacy en dpoints, such as progression-free 
survival. If the CT porti on of a PET/CT is done wi th contrast and a radiologist formally review s 
and reports the findi ngs on head and neck and t horacic regions, then there is no need to order 
additi onal diagnostic CT/MRI of the head and neck or chest x-rays or CT scan of the c he st. The 
primary tumor and regi onal nodes  will be evaluated and report ed separ ately.

12.4 Quality of Lif e As sessments 
12.4.1 Functional Assessment of Canc er Therapy- Head & Neck (FACT-H& N) is a 
multidim ensional, QOL instrum ent specifically desig ned and valid f or use wi th HNS CC patients 
that the patient c an comple te in 5- 10 minutes. The si te research nurse or clinical res earch 
associate (CRA) is encouraged to be s ensitive to each patient's dem eanor. If patie nts appear 
particularly unco mfortable answering a questio n, they will be inform ed that they c an skip that 
questi on. Similarly, in terviewers will give p atients a short break if the patient appe ars fatigued or 
otherwise in n eed of a f ew minutes  break.

13.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a one-arm phase II trial designed to assess treatm ent efficacy in terms of 2-year 
progression free surviva l. A two-sta ge Simon design (Simon, 1989) was adopted, which wil l 
permit early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284826] s tudy regim en is inactive or is 
effective enough to wa rrant further investi gation in a phase III trial.

accruing approximately 20 eligible p atients per ye ar (about 2 patients p er month). We will follow 
up all patients closely and do not ex pect any patients to drop out of the tri al except for deat h, so 
censori ng due to other reas ons would be unlikely. We ex pect to complete the a ccrual in

13.3 Primary Objective and S tudy De sign 
13.3.1 Study Design 
The primary objective of the s tudy is to determi ne the treatment efficacy evaluated using the 2- 
year progression-fr ee  survival rate and to deci de whet her inducti on chem otherapy followed b y 
dose de-int ensified c hemor adiotherapy is worth further investi gation in a p hase III trial. A t wo- 
stage Simon design (Sim on 1989) was a dopted to s tudy the 2-y ear progression-fr ee su rvival rate 
in patients wi th HPV- positive HNS CC who receive thi s regim en. We will consid er a 2-year 
progression- fr ee surviv al rate of 72% or lower as ineffective for the proposed dose de-intensified 
therapy in this p opulatio n, and a 2-ye ar progre ssion- fr ee survival rate of 86% or higher woul d 
warrant fur ther subsequent s tudies. T he fo llowing two-s tage Simon design (Sim on 1989) was 
employ ed using [ADDRESS_347814] 72%. 
 
Stage 1: Consider t he first [ADDRESS_347815] 25 
evalu able p atients enrolled are pr ogression-free at 2 y ears, then the t rial will be stopped a nd 
accept  the al ternative hypot hesis th at the tr ue 2-ye ar progression-free survival rate is 86% or 
higher. Otherwis e, the trial would c ontinue to the seco nd stage. 
 
Stage 2: Consider t he addition al [ADDRESS_347816] 50 evaluabl e 
patients enrolled are pr ogression-free at 2 yea rs, then we accept that the dose de-i ntensified 
therapy i s ineffective in this population a nd not worth further investig ation. If 41 or more patients 
are pr ogression-free at 2 years, then we will further study the r egimen in a phase III t rial. 
 
13.3.2 Power Consideration 
With 50 patie nts, giv en the true 2-year pr ogression-fr ee survival rate is 72%, the probability of 
ending the trial during s tage 1 is 79.3%; giv en the tr ue 2-ye ar progressi on-free surviv al rate is 
86%, t he probabi lity of e nding the t rial in Stage 1 i s 66%. The overall signific ance lev el is about 
9% and the power is 81%. A ssumi ng  the significance level is at most 10%, if the tr ue 2-year 
progression- fr ee surviv al rates are78%, 81%, 8 5% and 87%, t he pr obabi lities of decla ring that 
this regim en warrants furth er studi es (i.e. s tatistical power) are 32%, 52%, 78%, [ADDRESS_347817] had dis ease pr ogressi on unless documented 
evidence clearly i ndicates no pr ogressi on has occurred. In the eve nt that such evid ence is 
obtained, or in the case of maj or treatment violatio n, the patients’ response data will b e 
considered c ensored at the date the patient is withdra wn from tr eatment. However, based on our 
previous ex perienc e, we expect such cas es are un likely a nd we will be able to eval uate all 
patients f or their 2-year progre ssion- fr ee survival. T he true 2-year pr ogression-fr ee survival rat e 
will be estim ated by [CONTACT_284876] e fficacy-evalu able patie nts on study wi thout documentat ion

of dis ease pr ogression or death 2 years fro m registr ation. A 95% confid ence i nterval (CI) f or the 
true progre ssion-free survival rate w ill be constructed usi ng the Duffy-Santner approach (Duffy 
1987 ). Ho wever, Kapl an-Meier method ology (Kaplan 1 958) will be us ed to estim ate the fi nal 2- 
year progression-fr ee  survival rate and i ts 95% CI in case there are censor ed patients. 
 
13.4.2 Secon dary En dpoints 
• Overall survival 
• Local-regional control 
• Mucos al and esop hageal toxicity (R ates of ≥ grade 3, clinical exam) 
• Other toxicity (Rates of ≥ grade 3) 
• Protocol treatm ent delivery 
• Death during or within 30 days of di scontin uation of pr otocol treatm ent 
• Quality of life as assessed  by [CONTACT_53926]-H&N and UWQ ol 
 
Overall survival w ill be defi ned as the time fro m registr ation to death. Time to event distri butions 
will be estim ated using the Kaplan-Mei er method  (Kaplan 1958). T he 2-ye ar rates of loc al- 
regional control will be calculat ed along wi th 95% CI for HPV-positive patients recei ving the dos e 
de-int ensified therapy. We will also com pare it wi th the r ate from his torical controls (93%, Risch in 
2010)  using a one- sided Z-tes t. Rates and 95% CIs of grade 3+ mucos al and eso phageal toxicity , 
late toxicity, other toxicities, protocol treatm ent delivery (PT D) and de ath during or within [ADDRESS_347818]-H&N a nd UWQ ol will be 
obtained. Continuous variabl es will be summarized u sing the m ean (s.d.) or median (range) . 
Frequency tabl es will be us ed to summa rize categoric al variables. T he distri bution of time- to- 
event endpoints will be estimated using the method  of Kaplan and Mei er (Kaplan 1958 ). 
 
We will also o btain descr iptive s tatistics f or quality of life m easurem ents, usi ng mean and 
standard devi ation for continuous  measur es and fr equency tabl es for categoric al measures. 
 
13.4.3 Over Accrual 
If more than the target num ber of patients are a ccrued, the additi onal p atients will not be used to 
evaluate t he stoppi [INVESTIGATOR_284827]; however, they will be includ ed 
in final poi nt estim ates and confidence intervals as they were accrued in t he final stage.  
 
13.4.4 Monitoring 
The princip al investi gator and the s tudy statistici an will review t he study periodica lly (at l east 
semi- annually) to i dentify a ccrual, adve rse events, and any en dpoint problems that might be 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. This st udy will also be m onitored by [CONTACT_284877] M onitoring B oard 
(DSMB) at l east annually, or more frequently as warranted. 
 
This pr otocol is also s ubject to the UC Da vis Cancer Center’s (UCDCC) Da ta and Safet y 
Monitoring Plan. The UCD CC is commi tted to pursuing hi gh-quality patient-o riented clinical 
research and has estab lished mec hanisms to ensure both sci entific ri gor and patient safety in the 
condu ct of clinical res earch studies. T he UCDCC  relies on a mul ti-tiered committ ee system that 
reviews and m onitors all canc er clinical trials and ensur es the safety of i ts particip ants, in 
comp liance wi th instit utional and f ederal requirem ents on adve rse event (AE) reporti ng, 
verificati on of data a ccuracy, a nd  adherence to protoc ol eligibi lity requirements, treatment 
guidelines, and rel ated matte rs. The Scientific Review Committee (SRC) assum es overal l 
oversight of c ancer studies, wi th assistance and in put from two in dependent, but interacting, 
commi ttees: the Quality Assur ance Committee and the Data and Safety Moni toring Committee. A

INTRODUCTION  
 
This is a research study.  Research studies only include subjects who choose to participate.  Your study doctor will 
explain the clinical trial  to you .  As a study participant you have the right to know about the procedures that will be used in 
this research study so that you can make the decision whether or not to participate.  The information presented here is to make you better informed so that you may give or withhold your consent to participate in this research study.  Please take your time to make your decision and discuss it with your family, friends , or with your personal physician .  If you have any 
questions, you can ask your study doctor for more explanation.   
 You are being asked to take part in this study because you have advanced head and neck cancer . We hope to learn more 
about a less aggressive regimen of radiation therapy for your type of cancer.  You must be 18 years of age or older.  In 
order to participate in this study, it will be necessary to give your written consent.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 The purpose of this study is to determine whether your human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] ( HPV)-positive head and neck cancer can 
be treated with a less aggressive regimen of radiation therapy and chemotherapy (paclitaxel) after initially receiving two cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel). If you agree to enroll on this study, you will be receiving a lower dose radiation therapy in the chemoradiotherapy phase of treatment than is typi[INVESTIGATOR_284845]. The purpose of this study is to see if using this less aggressive regimen improves the tolerability of treatment and results in cure rates as high as standard treatment.  
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  
 
We pla n to enroll up to 50 people at UC Davis Cancer Center . 
 
BEFORE YOU BEGIN THE STUDY  
 
If you choose to take part in this study and sign this informed consent form, you will complete “pre- study screening tests” 
to determine if you meet the study requirements.   Some of these exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer 
care and may be done even if you do not join the study.    The pre- study screening tests are listed below  and on the next 
page . 
 
Pre-study Screening Tests: 
• Physical examination by [CONTACT_284890]  (including a radiation oncologist  and a medical oncologist (a 
chemotherapy doctor) ) 
• Evaluation of your weight and ability to carry out daily activities  
• Chest x -ray or CT (Computed Tomography) scan of your chest. A CT scan uses special x -ray equipm ent to make 
detailed pi[INVESTIGATOR_284846].  
• CT scan or an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) of your head and neck. MRI uses  a strong magnetic field to 
look at one part of your body)

BEFORE YOU BEGIN THE STUDY (continued) 
Pre-study Screening  Tests: (continued) 
• Combination of PET (Positron Emission Tomography)/CT scan of your body. A PET scan is a computerized 
image that looks at the activity of tumor cells in your entire body and that requires injection of a special marker 
into your vein, such as sugar (glucose) combined with a low -dose radioactive substance (a tracer). A camera 
records the tracer’s signal as it travels through your body.  
• Routine blood tests  (about 2- 3 teaspoons of blood will be taken from your vein)  
• Quality of Life questionnaire  
• For women able to have children, a pregnancy blood test (about 1- 2 teaspoons of blood will be required)  
• If your study doctor recommends:  
o Dental evaluation before receiving radiation  
o Hearing test  
o Evaluation of your diet and ability to chew and swallow to see if a feeding tube is needed  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
 If you decide to participate in this study, you will receive 2 cycles of chemotherapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin) given three 
weeks apart. Before each dose of chemotherapy, you will be given some medicine through your vein to prevent an allergic 
reaction. Then you will be given chemotherapy through your vein for approximately two hours. You will not receive radiation therapy on the day you receive the initial chemotherapy.  
 Your blood pressure and overall physical condition will be closely monitored while you receive chemotherapy and for at least one hour afterwards. If you have a severe allergic reaction to the initial chemotherapy or any later doses, the study 
doctor will treat you for the reaction, and you may not receive further chemotherapy on this study. You and the study 
doctor can discuss other treatments that you can receive off study.  
 If you tolerate the initial dose of chemotherapy well, approximately t wo weeks later, you will begin receiving radiation 
therapy combined with chemotherapy. All patients will receive daily radiation therapy, Monday through Friday. Each radiation treatment will take about 20 minutes. Your study doctor will discuss with you how exactly your radiation therapy 
will be given. After completing the initial chemotherapy and prior to the beginning of radiation therapy, a physical 
examination (including endoscopy  which is an examination of the throat and voice box with a mirror and/or flexible lighted 
tube inserted through your mouth) will be performed.  This information will be used to determine how long you will receive radiation therapy.  
 
• If the tumor was felt to have shrunk significantly after initial chemotherapy, you will receive radiation therapy once a day, Monday through Friday, for about 5 weeks.  
• If the tumor response was felt to be less significant after initial chemotherapy, you will receive radiation therapy 
once a day, Monday through Friday, for about 6 weeks.  
 
All patients  also will receive chemotherapy (paclitaxel), through the vein, weekly during treatment . This will take [ADDRESS_347854] body fluids.

HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?  
 
You will be asked to participate for as long as your cancer is not growing and you are not having any unmanageable side 
effects. After you are finished with treatment, the study doctor will ask you to visit the office for routine follow -up exams, 
beginning 4 weeks after completion of treatment and then at 8-12 weeks after completion of treatment . As part of long -
term follow -up, y ou will be seen at 6, 9, and 12 months from the start of  treatment. For year  2, you will be seen every 3 
months  then every 6 months for years 3- 5.  
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?  
 
Yes.  You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell your study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_59917].  Your doctor will tell you how to stop safely.  It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_284847].  Another reason to tell your doctor that you are thinking about 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_60769] -up care and testing could be most helpful for you.   
 Your study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he or she believes it is in your best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.  
 
WHAT SIDE EFFECTS OR RISKS CAN I EXPECT FROM BEING IN THE STUDY?  
 You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study wi ll be watched carefully for any side 
effects. However, researchers don’t know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or  very serious. 
Your health care team may give you medicines to help lessen side effects. Many side effects go away soon after you stop 
radiation and chemotherapy, if you receive chemotherapy. In some cases, side effects  can be serious, long lasting, or 
may never go away. As in any treatment with side effects, there also is a risk of  death.  You should talk to your study 
doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in the study.  
 Combining chemotherapy with radiation to the head and neck can increase the effectiveness of radiation therapy on your cancer, but also can increase the side effects of radiation on normal tissue in treatment area. In addition, receiving a combination of chemotherapy with radiation can result in the side effects described below being more likely or more severe.

Radiological  Risks:   This study involves  a radiation exposure that is higher than most other diagnostic tests using 
ionizing radiation. The exposure to radiation from this procedure might result in a slight increase in cancer risk in normal 
healthy individuals.  However, since you already have cancer, a risk estimate cannot be accurately determined.  The 
amount of radiation for this research study is low compared to the radiation dose from the treatment of your cancer.  
 
Privacy Risks: There may also be risks to your privacy.  The researchers will store study records and other information 
about you in a secure location and will grant access only to those with a need to know.  However, just like with other personal information kept by [CONTACT_284895], your banks, and others, even these safeguards cannot guarantee 
absolute protection of the data.  If private information gets into the wrong hands, it can cause harm.  Although rare, there 
are reported cases of breaches that have resulted in discrimination in insurance or employment.

ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE STUDY?  
 
You may not benefit from taking part in this research.  The information we get from this study may help us to learn more 
about this study treatment, and this may help future cancer patients.  
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE IF I DO NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 Your alternative is not to take part in this study.  If you choose not to take part in this study, your future care will not be 
affected.  Your other choices may include:  
 
 Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study  
 Participating in a different study, if available  
 Getting no treatment  
 Getting comfort care, also called palliative care.  This type of care helps reduce pain, tiredness, appetite problems, and other problems caused by [CONTACT_62565].  It does not treat the cancer directly, but instead tries to improve how you feel.  Comfort care tries to keep you as active and comfortable as possible.

WILL SPECIMENS (tissue, blood, urine or other body materials) TAKEN FROM ME BE USED FOR FUTURE 
RESEARCH PURPOSES?  (continued) 
Your name, address, phone number and any other identifying information will be taken off anything associated with your 
specimen before it is given to the researcher.  This would make it very difficult for any research results to be linked to 
you or your fa mily.  To help protect your privacy, people outside the research process will not have access to results 
about any one person.  
 
The benefits of research using specimens include learning more about what causes diseases, how to prevent them, how 
to treat them, and how to cure them.  There are very few risks to you.  The greatest risk is the release of information from your health records which may be necessary for us to obtain along with your specimens.  We will protect your records so that your name, address, and phone number will be kept private.   
 
Please read each question below and think about your choice.  After reading each question, initial next to “YES” or “NO”.  
If you have any questions, please discuss this with the researcher.  
 
1. My tissue /blood  may be kept for use in future research:     YES______  NO______  
 2. Someone may contact [CONTACT_284899]:    YES_____ NO______

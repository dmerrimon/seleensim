participating in  the research?  ( In collaborative  projects, data/specimens/results are often shared  
between researchers at the participating institutions, and they will publish  together.)
☐ No  ☒ Yes
If yes, please explain.
We are collaborating with the University of Southern [LOCATION_004], where the intervention is being administered as a part  of a social service  program for caregivers (USC Family 
Caregiver Support Program).  USC  may participate in the publication of findings but is 
not involved in data collection procedures, other than registration data used as a part of regular programming.  We are also working with Amicus Brain Innovations as a study 
partner. Amicus  Brain  Innovations is responsible for building  out technology components 
of the CONFIDENCE program. They will store data  such as utilization data (e.g.,  receipt 
of text messages) from caregivers in the NeuViCare app that  we are integrating into the 
intervention.

2.0 Objectives
Directions: Describe the purpose, specific  aims or objectives. Be sure to also include the 
hypothesis being tested. The overall objective of this project  is to test the feasibility, acceptability,  and preliminary 
efficacy on an AI-enhanced psychoeducational intervention to reduce financial strain among Latino/Hispanic family 
caregivers to people living with dementia (PLWD)   by [CONTACT_441397]  2. The central  
hypothesis is that caregivers who participate in the CONFIDENCE intervention will report higher levels  of 
resourcefulness and self-efficacy following participation in the CONFIDENCE intervention that will reduce financial strain 
among caregivers of PLWD.   
3.0 Background
Directions: Describe the relevant prior experience and gaps  in current  knowledge 
describing how this  study will add  to existing knowledge.  Include any relevant preliminary 
data. Family  caregivers to people living with dementia encounter financial  strain,  including material, 
psychological, and behavioral components. Caregivers to PLWD also spend an average of $8,978 per year out-of-pocket on caregiving expenses,  which is around  $1000 more  than caregivers  to persons 
without dementia. Research findings support that caregiving places individuals at increased  risk of 
poverty, due to factors such  as reduced ability to engage in employment  and spending down one's own 
savings to cover costs. Financial  strain  is also a risk factor for caregiver  depression  and burden  which  
affects 1 in 5 family caregivers to PLWD.  Financial strain disproportionately affects Latino/Hispanic 
family caregivers  to PLWD. They spend 47%of their  annual household income  on out-of-pocket  costs of 
caregiving, compared to 18% among non-Hispanic white,  34% among African American, and  22% 
among Asian  American caregivers. These differences  in out-of-pocket  expenses are partially due to 
cultural preferences to provide care at home,  such  that Latino/Hispanic families  provide  more intensive 
care that is more  likely  to disrupt employment and increases out-of-pocket costs. Further, U.S. 
Latino/Hispanic households have a median net worth of  $52,190 (four  times lower than U.S non-

Additional information can be provided  in section 29, or  added  as a comment. Page 3 of 27Latino/Hispanic households), which makes  it more difficult  to absorb  out-of-pocket costs when they  
occur. The impact of financial strain on Latino/Hispanic  families is likely to grow substantially,  given an 
anticipated 832% increase in the number of Latinos/Hispanics LWD in 2060. However  in 2022 only two 
studies were found to examine intervention  effects on financial strain  of Latino/Hispanic caregivers.   
To address the  need for programs to reduce financial strain among Latino  caregivers, we developed the  
Confidently Navigating  Financial Decisions and Enhancing Financial  Wellbeing in Dementia Caregiving  
(CONFIDENCE) program with  support from AARP Foundation  from [ADDRESS_560195] been  collected. Initial  findings 
indicate high satisfaction  with  the program among participants (100% “Agree”  or “Strongly Agree” they  
would recommend the program to other caregivers), but also lower-than-anticipated uptake  and 
adherence. For example,  only  51% of caregivers registering for CONFIDENCE at  the USC Family 
Caregiver Support Center attended at  least one session.  Of those  who attended at least one  session,  
average attendance was  3.[ADDRESS_560196] high acceptability  but limited 
feasibility. The second version of CONFIDENCE aims to build on lessons  learned from the original  CONFIDENCE 
program with the goal  of improving program feasibility prior to testing the program’s efficacy. To  
improve uptake  and adherence, we  have shortened  the number of group-based Zoom discussion sessions  
from [ADDRESS_560197] access to a  conversational AI 
assistant (“Keiko”) that  will draw  from hand-pi[INVESTIGATOR_441384]-cost home modifications,  how to prepare 
for retirement,  and how to prevent financial scams. To support learning between discussion  sessions, 
NeuViCare also will host  a moderated community forum where caregivers  can connect with other 
participating caregivers  .

5.0 Number of  Research Participants
Directions: Indicate  the target number of research participants to be accrued locally, and, 
if this is a multi-site study,  indicate the total number  of research participants to be accrued 
across all sites. 
Example language that  can be used: We will enroll 25 subjects  at CWRU and plan to enroll  
150 subjects study wide. We  will recruit 42 family  caregivers to  account for the anticipated 20% 
attrition before and after participation in CONFIDENCE 2. Moreover, at least 12 participants will complete  qualitative  interviews.
6.0 Special/Vulnerable  Populations
Indicate specifically if you will include each  of the following special populations by  [CONTACT_441398]: 
☐  Adults unable to consent
☐  Minors (infants, children, teenagers) 
☐  Wards of the state (e.g.  Foster Children)
☐  Pregnant  Women  (only  if targeted)
☐  Neonates
☐  Neonates  of Uncertain Viability
☐  Employees
☐  Prisoners
☐  Illiterate  Individuals
☒  Non-English Speaking
☐  Students
☐  None
1.If the research involves students or employees,  describe how  you will recruit  so that: 
a) Employers  or educators do not know if someone  participated (until after grades have 
been assigned in the case of educators) 
b) Employers or educators do not directly recruit their own  students or employees,  and 
anything else to prevent feelings of coercion  to those subordinate  to their employer or 
educator.

Approved: 09/2021 Prior Version: 05/[ADDRESS_560200] access  to? 
The anticipated recruitment period  will begin in March [ADDRESS_560201]. USC  FCSC serves over 500 caregivers 
yearly, among whom 60% are Latino/Hispanic and  38% care for someone living  with  
AD/ADRD. Although recruitment  into the  initial study was  far lower than anticipated, 
multiple factors are expected to contribute  to higher enrollment in  this study, including 1) 
reduced burden of participation in the intervention  (e.g., reduction  of synchronous  
sessions from 5 to 4), 2)  reduced burden of study participation (e.g.,  removal  of daily  
spending diary component), and 3)  expansion of age  eligibility  criteria from caregivers 
ages 50+ to 18+ in the  current study.  Further,  we have expanded our recruitment  
approach during the initial CONFIDENCE study. 
9.0 Setting
Directions: Describe the sites and  locations where your research team will conduct the 
research.
 All research will be conducted at Case Western Reserve University where  the study team 
has lab space to collect  data by [CONTACT_756],  REDCap, and Zoom  in a private  space.  Some data 
on app utilization will be collected  by [CONTACT_441402]. 
10.0 Consent Process
Indicate whether you will be obtaining consent:
☒  Yes ☐  No
If yes, answer the following questions:
1.Describe who  will consent the subjects and where the consent process  will take  
place: The consent process will be completed using an online consent  
form completed in REDCap,  wherein participants will be asked to 
review a written consent  form and answer [ADDRESS_560202] the 
participant to clarify information and resend  the consent  form. If 
HRP-
503SBERTEMPLATE: CWRU SBER Protocol
Approved: 09/2021 Prior Version: 05/[ADDRESS_560203],  the participant will be deemed ineligible  
to participate and notified of their removal from the study.
  
2.The time  that will  be devoted  to the consent discussion: The  time  to complete  
the online consent form will vary among  participants, though  we 
anticipate it will take  no more than  [ADDRESS_560204]  and 
obtaining the  consent: There is no required waiting period between 
informing the participant of their  eligibility and the consenting 
process. However,  participants may choose  to delay consent  
following notification  of eligibility, such as by [CONTACT_441403].
4.Steps  that will be  taken to ensure the  research  participants’ understanding:  
Participants will be asked to complete  [ADDRESS_560205].
5.Any process to ensure ongoing consent: We will assume ongoing consent if 
the participant chooses to complete surveys. At the top of each 
survey, participants  will be reminded that participation is voluntary
6.Steps  that will be  taken to minimize the possibility  of coercion  or undue influence 
to the subjects: While consenting participants, we will remind  them  
that participation is voluntary  and that they  are welcome to 
participate in CONFIDENCE regardless of their choice  to participate 
in the research  study
For Adult Participants
Indicate if you will be asking for  a waiver  or alteration of consent process or  
documentation (consent will not be obtained,  or written consent  will not be documented)
☒  Yes ☐  No
If yes, explain  how the research involves no more than minimal risk.  We are  requesting a  
waiver of  consent related  to provision of a signature [INVESTIGATOR_8178] a sub-study,  wherein  we will ask 
caregivers who  are not in the parent  study to participate in a qualitative interview.  The 
interview content focuses on their experience in the CONFIDENCE  program  and is aligned  
with the goals of program evaluation/quality  improvement. It is  unlikely  private or 
embarrassing information  would be shared.

the rationale for requesting the waiver or alteration:
☒  I will  obtain  consent, but not participant’s signature.
1.Give the rationale for  the request of a waiver of signed consent. Those  
individuals who did not enroll in the  study  are likely busier than those  who 
are enrolled in  the parent research study. Asking for a consent signature 
[CONTACT_441428] a minimal-risk component of the study.
2.Please describe  how you will be documenting that a  participant  has 
consented. The  interviewer  will ask the participant if  they consent to  
participate at the beginning of the  interview. They  interview will not  
proceed unless consent is  given  
3.Indicate if the  subjects will be provided with written information about the 
study, and provide justification if you will not be providing a written  
explanation of the research. Caregivers will be sent a copy  of the 
information sheet prior to the scheduled interview,  if they agree to be  
interviewed. This  will be  reviewed  at the beginning of the  interview.
☐   I will obtain consent, but request  a waiver  of some  of the elements of consent 
                      (e.g. use of deception).
☐   I will not obtain any  consent, and I am requesting a  full waiver  of consent.
If you are requesting  an alteration  of consent, or a waiver  of consent,  please answer  
the following:
1.Give the rationale for  the request of a waiver or alteration of the consent  
process. See above
2.Explain why  the waiver or alteration  of consent  will not  adversely affect 
the rights and  welfare of the participants. The  questions asked  in the 
qualitative interview are unlikely to result in disclosure of sensitive information, and  are more aligned with the goals  of program  evaluation or 
quality improvement than research. 
3.Explain why  the research could  not practicably be carried  out without the 
waiver or  alteration of  consent. Requiring a signature [CONTACT_441429].

Overall design. A single-arm pre-  and post-test clinical trial of the  CONFIDENCE  
intervention will be conducted. This study  builds on the original CONFIDENCE  study 
(STUDY20221010), but with a modified  version of the intervention and minor updates in 
data collection protocols  to reduce  participant burden. Participation will be offered  to any 
caregiver of persons living with dementia nationally  who register for the program via  the 
USC Family Caregiver Support Center  (USC FCSC) Eventbrite.  Study  participation is 
optional. CONFIDENCE will be delivered  in English and  Spanish, and participants may 
participate in the study  in either language.
Intervention The intervention includes participation  in four,  1.[ADDRESS_560207] a dedicated  “NeuViCare champi[INVESTIGATOR_2394]” at the USC FCSC

learning about the study will receive up to four calls and emails by a study  team  member 
to learn more about the  study. If  interested  in participating, eligibility screening and a  
review of  the study consent  information  will be conducted by [CONTACT_441405] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a 
trained study team member. (Participants  may complete the screening process  online,  but 
are asked to complete a telephone follow up where they will be asked  the screening item  
about the Global  Deterioration Scale and other questions they did  not respond to.) 
Participants will then  be sent an email  with a REDCap consent form to review  and 
signature. Total enrollment and  consenting time is estimated to take up to  [ADDRESS_560209]-intervention (i.e., within 1 week). A  second  
follow-up survey will be sent two months following intervention completion to understand the maintenance  of outcomes. We  estimate follow  up surveys take  about  [ADDRESS_560210] 12  participants  by [CONTACT_32356]/or  Zoom,  both  in Spanish  and 
English. Questions will be based  on caregiver’s  experiences  and opi[INVESTIGATOR_441386]  2. The  interview guide will be based on the seven  
components of the  Theoretical Framework  of Acceptability. This guide will be previously 
reviewed by [CONTACT_441406].  Questions about  the theory of resourcefulness will be 
also included to better understand its application.  Depending on how much participants

17.0 Data Analysis  Plan
Directions: Describe the data analysis  plan,  including any statistical  procedures.  If 
applicable, provide  a power analysis,  and study/safety  endpoints. 
Outcome measures. Resourcefulness  (primary outcome). Resourcefulness skills help family 
caregivers lower material  out-of-pocket costs through identification of community resources and 
alternative ways of  managing  costs. This will be  measured using Resourcefulness  Scale, a 28-
item scale  used to measure potential and social resourcefulness (alpha=0.83;  range: 0 to  140). 
Self-efficacy (second  primary outcome) is measured using  the Caregiver  Self-Efficacy Scale. 
This 8-item  scale combines domains of  self-efficacy (e.g., managing behavioral symptoms,  
accessing respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], and controlling upsetting thoughts. It demonstrates high reliability  
(alpha=0.89) and  good test-retest reliability (0.73). Scores range from 8 (lowest) to 80 (highest). 
Financial strain (secondary outcome) . Interventions to reduce  caregiver financial strain are 
needed across multiple levels, individual-level behavioral interventions are needed  given the 
slow pace  of policy change to promote caregiver’s financial security. This will be primarily 
measured using the  11-item Comprehensive  Score  for Financial  Toxicity (COST) Scale, which 
has been  modified from  the cancer  field,  which demonstrates validity  and reliability (a=0.91;  
range: 0 to 44). We will  also use  a secondary measure of psychological financial  strain that was 
used in the initial CONFIDENCE study. (See  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] for details on this  measure.) 
Community Resource Access  (ancillary  outcome). This  author made item asks  about caregivers’ 
HRP-
503SBERTEMPLATE: CWRU SBER Protocol
Approved: 09/2021 Prior Version: 05/[ADDRESS_560216]  analyses, where we will compare baseline scores to  scores from each 
follow-up survey. If there is a  p-value  <0.05,  this indicates  that there was a  statistically 
significant difference between scores.  Mean scores  and standard deviation for all scores on each 
scale will be also examined. (We  will use descriptive statistics alone to assess whether  or not a 
caregiver accessed  new  resources following program  participation.) 
Satisfaction surveys. To analyze  Likert  responses to satisfaction surveys,  a percentage for each 
response will be  provided. Each item will be compared to  items  collected for  the initial 
CONFIDENCE study, as well as scores  for items of CONFIDENCE between Spanish and 
English intervention.Attendance. We will report the  average  number  of sessions attended (range 0 to 4) and the 
standard deviation. Comparison on the number  of sessions attended will be compared  between  
the English and the  Spanish  sessions  as well  as between the earlier and current version of 
CONFIDENCE in the form of  percentages  to allow  us to  draw preliminary comparisons, given  
the different  number of possible sessions to attend (3 vs.  5). The average number of sessions will 
be calculated both with and without accounting for make-up sessions. (i.e., giving credit for attendance in Session  1 if the caregiver attended  the makeup session for  this lesson.)
App Utilization . Usage data from NeuViCareTM Care and Resources Advisors will be  reported 
in aggregate  Individual-level data  will be collected on the average number of text received, 
average interactions on the Community  Hub, and  average number of practice activities 
completed on  NeuViCare.
Fidelity. Fidelity reports will  be evaluated using total scores averaged across all CONFIDENCE   
sessions observed.  Sub scores will be  reported for adherence to  the facilitator guide, participant 
experience, and quality  of delivery. These  will be reported separately for English and Spanish 
participants by  [CONTACT_2329] a percentage, as well as means  and standards of deviation,  to examine 
variability. Qualitative interviews . Qualitative interviews will be transcribed  verbatim, and for the ones 
conducted in Spanish,  they will be previously translated.  Transcription  and translation of 
interviews conducted  in Spanish will be by [CONTACT_441407]-[LOCATION_003].  English Transcriptions will be  done by 
[CONTACT_429452]. A preliminary code book will be developed by [CONTACT_441408]. At least  two coders will analyze each  
transcript independently  and will meet  to compare  the codes. The second  round of  coding will be  
conducted to integrate new codes  if needed.

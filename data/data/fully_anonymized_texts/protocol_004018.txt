2.0 Introduction 
2.1 Background and Rationale  
Lipedema is a connective tissue  disorder that affects up to 10%  of women. It is 
characterized by [CONTACT_37322], swollen s ubcutaneous tissue and dispr oportionate fat 
accumulation (primarily in the lower limbs, however it can spre ad to the abdomen 
and arms). Patients are often no t aware they are affected by [CONTACT_37323]; rather, they 
think they are just ov erweight or obese.    
Patients with lipedema often feel  frustrated and uncomfortable as symptoms such as 
heaviness, pain, and easy bruising impact quality of life. Affe cted limbs can 
become so large and heavy that  daily tasks such as walking, cle aning, or shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_37311].  
Lipedema is a progressive diseas e. There are currently 3 primar y stages that 
describe disease severity: stag e 1 involves thickening of subcu taneous tissue and 
disproportion accumulation of subcutaneous tissue in the extrem ities (tissue 
remains smooth and is generall y not heavy or swollen), stage [ADDRESS_37426] secondary 
swelling on physical exam. This swelling results from the fat o n the legs, thighs, 
and ankles blocking transport of  lymphatic fluid; which ultimat ely may lead to 
infection. This lipo-lymphedema ( or lipedema with swelling) is a secondary 
lymphedema, much like veno-lymp hedema, and can be easily distin guished from 
primary lymphedema as it sp ares the hands and feet.  
There is currently no cure for li pedema, thus treatment focuses  on symptom 
management and improved patient- reported outcomes. At present, the two main 
courses of treatment include non- surgical conservative treatmen t (e.g., 
Comprehensive Decongestive Th erapy (CDT), diet, exercise, 
emotional/psychological/social s upport) and lymph-sparing lipos uction performed 
by a surgeon trained in lipedema  treatment. The primary goals f or treatment 
include: reduction/elimination of inflammation, swelling, and p ain; increase in 
lymphatic flow, which reduces/eli minates excessive fluid and sw elling; overall 
management of the physical impac t of lipedema; and quality of l ife improvements

CONFIDENTIAL       Page 5 of 38   
which can include emotional, psyc hological/mental , spi[INVESTIGATOR_37312], a nd social 
enhancement in addition to physical management. 
Intermittent Pneumatic Compre ssion (IPC) devices are often used  as home-therapy 
to treat secondary lymphedema or  lipo-lymphedema (lipedema with  swelling) and 
may be helpful in preventing the  progression of lipedema. IPC u se moves lymphatic 
fluid and supports the elimination of proteinaceous fluids, thu s leading to improved 
patient-reported symptoms, decr eased limb girth and volume, inc reased elasticity of 
tissues, and fewer epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] i nfection (1-3). Szolnoky report ed daily treatment 
with CDT, IPC, and multilayered s hort-stretch bandaging perform ed for 5 days led 
to significant improvements in l eg volume, capi[INVESTIGATOR_37313],  and pain in women 
with lipedema (4). 
The purpose of this study is to a ssess whether 3-4 weeks of IPC  usage is associated 
with alleviation of symptoms a nd improvement in quality of life  in women with 
lipo-lymphedema (lipedema with swelling).

regarding participation i n the research study. 
2.3 Device Description  
2.3.1 Flexitouch Plus 
The Flexitouch Plus (Tactile Medical™, Minneapolis, MN, [LOCATION_003]) is a 
segmental, programmable, gradie nt advanced pneumatic compressio n 
device cleared for market i n the [LOCATION_003] (K170216, HCPCS code E0652 ). The 
device stimulates the lympha tic system by [CONTACT_37324] d can be 
absorbed and processe d naturally by [CONTACT_10489].  
The system consists of two prima ry components: a controller uni t and 
garments. The controller unit ha s connector outle ts for garment  hoses to 
plug into such that air can pa ss through the hoses and deliver treatment 
through sequential inflation and de flation of air chambers with in the 
garments. The garments are cons tructed of nylon and have 27-32 chambers, 
depending upon garment size. The pre ssure setting is variable b etween 
“decreased,” “normal,” and “increased.”  
The device is intended to provide  in-home Manual Lymphatic Drai nage 
(MLD) therapy for approximate ly [ADDRESS_37428] care for patients under the Principal Investigator’s c are includes 
30-[ADDRESS_37429], dietary counselin g, 
exercise, and a referral for Co mplete Decongestive Therapy (CDT ). Based 
on each patient’s situation (e.g., i nsurance coverage, willingn ess/ability to 
independently comply with care, t ime constraints, etc.), some o r all of these 
recommendations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] f ollowed. In this “r eal-world” st udy, no 
attempt is being made to contro l what will or won’t be used in terms of 
conservative care since it varies  in clinic practice for each p atient.  
3.[ADDRESS_37430] udy is to assess the effectivene ss of bilateral Flexitouch Plus 
use with conservative care based upon:                                                                                                            
 Circumferential measurements at ankle, mid-calf, lower thigh, u pper thigh, hip, 
and waist,  
 Quality of life (RAND 36-It em Health Survey 1.0), and  
 Patient-reported symptoms and pain  intensity (PROMIS Pain Inter ference – 
Short Form 6b, Wong-Baker Faces Scale, and the NIH Toolbox nume rical 
rating scale (NRS)). 
Exploratory endpoi nts include:                                                                                                                        
 Mobility (PROMIS Mobility v2.0), and 
 Bioimpedance measurements (Whol e Body and Segmenta l Extracellul ar 
Water/Total Body Water (ECW/ TBW) ratios using InBody 770). 
 Comparing all objectives and e ndpoints between treatment groups . 
4.0 Study Design 
This is a prospective, randomi zed, two-arm study comparing Flex itouch Plus with 
conservative care to conservative  care alone (Figure 1). This p ost-market study involves on 
label use of the Flexitouch Plu s device given eligible patients  must have concurrent 
diagnosis with lymphedema (as no ted by [CONTACT_37325] 2/3 lipedema with presence of secondary 
swelling upon physical exam) and obt ain the device through norm al commercial means 
(self-pay, patient a ssistance, or insur ance programs).

[ADDRESS_37436] meets all of the  inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, 
they will be randomly assigned t o Flexitouch Plus with conserva tive care or 
conservative care alone. Randomiz ation codes will be generated in a permuted 
block design. The block size will be balanced within each block , and will maintain 
a 1:[ADDRESS_37437]’s binder. 
6.6 InBody 770 Bioimpedance Measurements 
The InBody is a medical-grade bi oimpedance device that measures  body water and 
composition, providing objective measures of fluid and muscle-f at balance. The 
unit is non-invasive and generate s a comprehensive results shee t that provides 
accurate, objective, and easily understandable measurements in less than 60 seconds 
to evaluate a patient’s current  health status and track efficac y of treatments and 
interventions. Clinicians ca n use the InBody t o: monitor body w ater and 
composition for early detection a nd treatment of lymphedema, id entify fluid 
imbalances through tracking segme ntal body water values and ede ma index 
variables, and evaluate additional health risks related to musc le-fat balance. 
  Version  2 . 0 
CONFIDENTIAL       Page 12 of 38   
For the purposes of this study, bioimpedance measurements will be collected at the 
beginning of the Baseline and Fo llow-up visit (immediately befo re and after 
removal of graduated compression) . Subjects will be asked to: 
 Stand on the InBody 770 with gradua tion compression on (coverin g the 
foot and heel pads while holding t he hand pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]). The arms wil l then be 
raised up and away from the tr unk for [ADDRESS_37438] ing begins. 
 Remove shoes and socks, clean hand s and feet with a wipe, and s tand on 
the InBody 770 (covering the foo t and heel pads while holding t he hand 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_6928]). The arms will then be raised up and away from the trun k for [ADDRESS_37439] ’s medical record (Figure 2 and 3).

Figure 3. Body Composition Analysis  
At the Follow-up visit, additional bioimpedance measurements (i ncluding whole 
body ECW/TBW ratio, as well as segmental ratios for the Right/L eft Arm, 
Right/Left Leg, and Trunk) may be collected immediately after a n approximately 
60-minute in-clinic treatment wi th FT Plus. The measurements wi ll be collected and 
recorded in the same fashion outlined above.   
Generally speaking, if there is  any type of inflammation or wat er retention 
occurring in the body, body water w ill accumulate in the extrac ellular space. Thus, 
injuries, disease, aging, high sodi um diets, as well as low mus cle mass, will cause 
the ECW/TBW to increase. The unit renders a whole body ECW/TBW ratio, as 
well as segmental ratios for the Right/Left Arm, Right/Left Leg , and Trunk. A 
whole body or segmental ECW/TBW r atio of >0.39 is considered ab normal. The 
segmental ratios are used to ide ntify problem areas for fluid r etention and 
inflammation. A 0.005 difference in  ECW/TBW between right and l eft limbs may 
be indicative of inflammation or  water retention. Larger discre pancies are required 
between upper and lower body given the legs have a slightly hig her ECW/TBW 
ratio due to gravity and i ncreased blood volume.  
6.[ADDRESS_37440] care at the beginning of the visit at 4 sites on each leg (immediately after 
biocompression measurements and t he removal of graduated compre ssion), 1 site at 
the hips, and 1 site at the wais t (for a total of 10 measuremen ts) using a Gulick II 
tape measure. Sites include:

 Site 1=narrowest part  of the ankle (ri ght and left leg),  
 Site 2=largest part of the calf (right and left leg),  
 Site 3=top of knee cap for lower  thigh (right and left leg),  
 Site 4=thickest part of the upper thigh (right a nd left leg),  
 Site 5=widest part of the hips, and  
 Site 6=narrowest part  of the waist. 
Results will be recorded in cent imeters on the respective data collection form.  
At the Follow-up visit, additional circumferential measurements  (including [ADDRESS_37441] using a Gulick II tape measure) 
may be collected immediately afte r an approximate ly 60-minute i n-clinic treatment 
with FT Plus. The measurements w ill be collect ed and recorded i n the same fashion 
outlined above. . 
6.8 Physical Exam 
The investigator (or designee) w ill perform a physical exam at Baseline and 
Follow-up to assess stage of liped ema and lymphedema, presence of edema at Sites 
1-6 (where circumferential meas urements were taken), and presen ce/absence of 
clinical symptoms. It is impor tant to note that progression to lipo-lymphedema 
(lipedema with swelling), a r equirement of this study, typi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y develops during 
Stage 2/3 of lipedema. 
 Lipedema Stage: 
o Stage 1 = Smooth/normal s kin surface with enlarged 
hypodermis/homogenous thicken ing of the subcutis.  
o Stage 2 = Bumpy, wave-like skin s urface with indentations/nodul ar 
structures (masses, lipomas, ang iolipomas) in the thickened 
subcutis.  
o Stage 3 = An increase in nodular  changes/deformations and 
overhanging masses of tissue (e specially on the thighs and arou nd 
the knees).  
 Lymphedema Stage: 
o Stage 0 = Latent or subclinical condition where swelling is not  yet 
evident despi[INVESTIGATOR_37315] t ransport, subtle alterations in  tissue 
fluid/composition, and changes in subjective symptoms. 
o Stage 1 = Early accumulation o f fluid relatively high in protei n 
content which subsides with lim b elevation. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_37316].

6.9 QOL, Symptoms, Mobility & Pain Assessments 
The following assessments will be  completed by [CONTACT_37326] t he Baseline and 
Follow-up visits. Subjects will be instructed to answer all of the items (i.e., 
questions or statemen ts) presented. Prior to departure, study p ersonnel will review 
each assessment for missing data  to ensure the subject addresse d each item. 
6.9.1 QOL 
The RAND 36-Item Health Surve y (Version 1.0) taps eight health concepts: 
physical functioning, bodily pai n, role limitations due to phys ical health problems, 
role limitations due to p ersonal or emotional problems, emotion al well-being, 
social functioning, energy/fatigue , and general he alth percepti ons. It also includes a 
single item that provides an i ndication of perceived change in health. ( Appendix A ) 
6.9.2 Mobility  
The PROMIS Mobility v2.0 (29 Nove mber 2016) is a 15-item questi onnaire 
completed by [CONTACT_37327] s on activities of physical mo bility such as getting 
out of bed/chairs to activities  such as running. The adult Mobi lity measures include 
selected items fro m the full Physical  Function item bank. (Appendix B)   
6.9.3 Pain Interference & Symptoms 
To assess pain and symptoms relate d to lipo-lymphedema (lipedem a with 
swelling), subjects will complete: 
 The PROMIS Pain Interference - Short Form 6b v1.0 (2 May 2016) 
measures self-reported conseque nces of pain on relevant aspects  of a 
person’s life and may include the  extent to which pain hinders engagement 
with social, cognitive, emotiona l, physical, and recreational a ctivities. 
(Appendix C )   
 The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale is a pain scale that sho ws a series 
of faces ranging from a happy face at 0, or "no hurt," to a cry ing face at 10, 
which represents "hurts like the worst pain imaginable." Based on the faces 
and written descriptions, the patient chooses the face that bes t describes 
  Version  2 . 0 
CONFIDENTIAL       Page 16 of 38   
their level of pain associated w ith lipo-lymphedema (lipedema w ith 
swelling). (Appendix D)    
 Subjects will be asked to rate  their perceptions of swelling, h eaviness, pain, 
fatigue, tenderness, and tightness independently for each leg u sing a 10-
point numerical rating scale where  0 represents none/not presen t and [ADDRESS_37442] imaginable.3 (Appendix E) 
6.10 Treatment 
Following randomization, collectio n of measurements, and the co mpletion of 
questionnaires, patients will be trained on the conservative ca re prescribed by [CONTACT_1275] (or designee).  
Patients randomized to the Flexitouch Plus will obtain a device  through standard 
commercial means (via  self-pay, patient assis tance, or insuranc e programs). The 
standard prescripti on of ‘Full Leg and Cor e (L1)’ with daily si multaneous bilateral 
lower extremity treatment (~60 m inutes) at normal pressure leve ls will be used 
unless alternate prog ramming is selected by t he investigator. A lternate 
programming (e.g., twice daily, high pressure, additional suppl emental lower leg 
program, etc.) may be used at the investigators discretion if a  subject reports 
inadequate control of lymphedema  symptoms prior to the next stu dy visit. While 
alternate programming is not e xpected to be necessary, it is im portant subjects have 
access to the best care possible at  all times in a “real world”  study. 
Once the prescription is submitted/processed at the Baseline vi sit, device shipment 
and training on device use must take place within [ADDRESS_37443] will not be 
enrolled in the study. 
At the Follow-up visit, some or a ll subjects may receive an in- clinic treatment with 
Flexitouch Plus after the Follo w-up data collec tion is complete . Additional 
circumferential (including [ADDRESS_37444] using a Gulick II tape mea sure) and bioimpedance (includi ng whole body 
ECW/TBW ratio, as well as segmen tal ratios for the Right/Left A rm, Right/Left 
Leg, and Trunk) measurements may b e collected and recorded imme diately after 
completion of the in-clinic Flexitouch Plus treatment. 
6.11 Adverse Events, Device Obs ervations, & Complications  
Reportable events and device obser vations, as defined below, wi ll be recorded in 
the subject’s medical recor d and on the appropriate forms.  
6.11.1  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event is an unt oward medical occurrence where  the 
outcome is:  
 Death;

CONFIDENTIAL       Page 17 of 38   
 Life-threatening event (places the  subject at immediate risk of  death 
from the experience as it occurred);  
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (initial or prol onged) if admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37320] a result of an adverse event; 
 Disability or perman ent damage (substantial disruption of one’s  
ability to carry out norma l life functions);  
 Congenital anomal y or birth defect; 
 Required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage ; 
or 
 Important medical event that requi red medical or interventional  
treatment to prevent one of the previous outcomes. 
Investigators will record SAEs on the AE log and report to Tact ile 
Medical and IRB (as required) within 10 working days of becomin g aware 
of the event. 
6.11.2  Device-Related Adverse Event (AE) 
A device-related AE is defined a s any untoward medical occurren ce in a 
subject that is associated wit h the use of the Flexitouch Plus device.  
All device-related AEs will be  recorded on the AE log. Complain t 
reporting will be reported through s tandard commercial means. 
6.11.3  Adverse Event Severity 
Severity will be assess by [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator using the following  definitions: 
 Mild: Subject awareness of si gn or symptom, but easily tolerate d. 
 Moderate: Interferes w ith normal activities. 
 Severe: Incapacitating, with i nability to perform normal activi ties. 
6.11.4  Venous-, Lymphedema-, and Liped ema-Related Complications 
Information about venous-, lymph edema-, and lip edema-related 
complications, including cellu litis, lymphangitis, deep vein th rombosis, 
skin breakdown, lymphorrhea, and lymphangiosarcoma, will be rec orded 
on the Complication & H ealthcare Utilization log. 
6.11.5  Device Observations 
Device observations regarding the Flexitouch Plus will be recor ded on a 
Device Observation log and repor ted to Tactile Medical to asses s the need 
for complaint reporti ng. Device observations  include device fai lures, 
device malfunctions, use errors, a nd user preferences, as defin ed below: 
 Device Failure  
A device failure has oc curred when the device is 
used in accordance with the IFU  but does not perform as describ ed 
in the IFU and also negatively imp acts treatment of the study 
subject. 
  Version  2 . 0 
CONFIDENTIAL       Page 18 of 38   
 Device Malfunction  
A device malfuncti on occurs when an 
unexpected change to the device th at is contradictory to the IF U is 
observed, which may or may not a ffect device performance. 
 Use Error  
A device use error is an act or omission of an act that 
results in a different medical d evice response than intended by  [CONTACT_37328]. Use error includes slips,  
lapses, and mistakes. An unexpected physiological response of t he 
subject does not itself constitute a use error. 
 Device Issue  
Any other issue with the d evice that does not fall 
into one of the above categories. 
 User Preference  
Information on user expectations, likes, dislikes, motivations, and inclinations tha t drive subject satisfaction w ith 
the device. 
Any unexpected side effects, pr oduct quality problems, use erro rs, or 
therapeutic failures related to graduated compression will be r eported 
through the standard commercial m eans, including: direct commun ication 
with manufacturer personnel  or online filing by t he investigato r at 
MedWatch ( https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/ scripts/medwatch/index.cfm ). 
 
7.[ADDRESS_37446] participation may be disc ontinued prior to study comple tion for any of the 
following reasons:  
 Withdrawal of Consent    
Subjects may withdraw their consen t to participate at any time.  If a subject 
withdraws consent, previous inf ormation that has already been o btained 
will be available for analysis. 
 Adverse Event  
 Subject experiences an adverse ev ent that in the investigator’ s clinical 
judgement necessitates disconti nuation of their participation i n this study.  
 Discretion of the Investigator 
Subjects may be withdrawn at the  investigator’s discretion in t he event of 
subject noncompliance, changes in  the subject’s health, or othe r reasons 
based on the investigator’s  clinical judgment. 
Subjects withdrawn prior to compl eting the study will be asked to return to clinic to 
complete Study Exit procedures.  
  
  Version  [ADDRESS_37447] is treat ed identically. Should a subjec t choose to terminate his or 
her participation in the study, he  or she will be treated accor ding to the standar d of care that 
applies at the point of withdrawal. 
8.1 Treatment Risks  
Participants enrolled in this  study are not expected to be at a ny higher or additional 
risk than those who use conserva tive care (compression garments ), since IPC 
pressures do not exceed the pressures of static compression gar ments. IPC and static 
compression are minimal risk t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_37321].  
Likely: 
 Local skin irritation 
 Pain or discomfort 
 Increased swelling 
Less Likely: 
 Cellulitis  
 New or increased edema in the  trunk and/or genital region 
Highly Unlikely: 
 Electric shock (if Flexitouch Plu s device is not maintained or used properly) 
8.[ADDRESS_37448] the Privac y of Study Participants/Informa tion Security Plan 
The most likely risk posed to par ticipants would b e a breach of  confidentiality if someone 
other than the research team obtained access to the data.  
There are security measures i n place to prevent a breach of con fidentiality from happening 
including password protected elect ronic database and the use of  subject codes to de-
identify data). 
Precautions will be taken to make sure that only authorized ind ividuals will be accessing 
subject research records. The c ollection of sensitive informati on about subjects is limited 
to the amount necessary to achieve the aims of the research, so  that no unneeded sensitive 
information is be ing collected.   
10.0 Deviation from Study Plan  
All deviations will be documen ted on the Deviation Log and repo rted to the IRB as 
required by [CONTACT_11222].    
11.0 Quality Assurance Procedures  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical P ractice (GCP), Code of 
Federal Regulations (CFR), insti tutional research policies and procedures, and other 
appropriate regulatory requireme nts to ensure subject safety an d quality of clinical 
procedures related to the conduct  of the clinical trial. As req uired by [CONTACT_37329] (FDA)  21 CFR 56 and the Declaration of Helsinki, the protocol, 
amendments, and Informed Consent form will be reviewed and appr oved, according to 21

13.0 Statistical Methods   
13.1 Sample Size Determination 
The study is not formally powered f or a specific primary hypoth esis, thus no formal 
power/sample size estimation was  performed. The study sample si ze was 
determined based upon a desire to b e able to estimate the means  of the primary 
within group endpoints, using 95% c onfidence intervals, with th e estimation of the 
endpoint means to have a precision (half width of the confidenc e intervals) of 
approximately 40% of the observe d standard deviation. To achiev e these 
parameters, we have determined a t arget analyzable sample size of 15 subjects (30 
total legs as the observational units) per group. To accommodat e an expected 
attrition rate of up to 20 %, a total of 3 subj ects per arm will  be replaced, if they fail 
to fully complete the study.  
13.2 Statistical Analysis 
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include t he number of subjects 
(n), mean, standard deviation, me dian, inter-qua rtile range, mi nimum, and 
maximum, based upon subjects with r eported data for the variabl e being analyzed. 
Frequencies (numerator and denom inator), percentages, and 95% c onfidence 
intervals will be displayed for c ategorical data. Percentages b y categories will be 
based on the number of subjects w ith no missing (unreported) da ta for the specific 
variable being analyzed and the count of the patients for each individual level of the 
categorical variable (the level  specific numerat ors). Percentag es will add up to 
100%, unless otherwise indicated. 
There are no plans to impute missing data and there are no plan s to explicitly report 
missing data (counts and/or percen tages) in the tables for all variables as part of the 
planned study report content. V ariations in the reported sample  sizes within and/or 
between relevant tables can be us ed to ascertain insights into unreported data. In 
some cases, unreported data ma y be due to it not being clinical ly relevant to a 
particular patient or may represe nt expected data that was not collected. Selected 
analyses pertaining to unreporte d and/or missing data may be di scussed and 
considered as future findings warrant. 
The exploratory nature of the study suggests that the statistic al focus will be on 
estimation and hypothesis generati on and not hypothesis testing . Though p-values 
will be reported as apropos, poi nt estimates, and 95% confidenc e intervals will be 
used to guide exploratory analyse s for potentiall y clinically m eaningful differences 
or changes to be discussed and evaluated.

Primary within treatment group ana lyses of change from baseline  will utilize paired 
tests (e.g. paired t-tests, McNema r chi-square) or similar non- parametric tests as 
appropriate, to compare the 30- day measurement to baseline. 
Secondary between treatment group comparative analyses of chang e from baseline 
will utilize ANCOVA or similar m ethods as appropriate. These me thods will 
include the 30-day measurement a s the dependent (response) vari able, while the 
baseline measurement and treatment group will be the independen t variables. 
Assessments of any interactions be tween the baseline measuremen t and treatment 
group will be performed. 
Other exploratory comparisons, w hen performed, will utilize chi -square, ANOVA, 
t-test, and appropriate non-para metric tests, unless otherwise specified. 
In the case of multiple compari sons, when performed, the Hochbe rg adjustment 
method (1988) will be used to contro l the family-wise error rat e.  
Multivariable models (e.g., linear regression or logistic regre ssion) may be used to 
assess the predictive relations hips and control for possible co nfounding imbalances 
of selected multiple variables  to specific outcome measures of interest. 
Any formal null hypothesis-based s tatistical comparisons will b e made using two 
sided tests at the α=0.[ADDRESS_37453] for

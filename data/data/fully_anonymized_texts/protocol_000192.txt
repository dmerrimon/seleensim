1.2 Synopsis
[COMPANY_013] Inc. Protocol Number:   M14-115
Name [CONTACT_26323]:   Adalimumab Phase of Development:   3
Name [CONTACT_3261]:   Adalimumab Date of Protocol Synopsis:   27 November 2018
Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate Higher Versus Standard 
Adalimumab Dosing Regimens for Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Crohn's Disease and Evidence of Mucosal Ulceration
Objectives:
The objective of Study M14-115 is to evaluate efficacy and safety of higher induction and maintenance 
dosing regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Study Population:   Males and females ≥ 18 and ≤  75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately to 
severely active Crohn's disease, CDAI ≥ 220 and ≤  450, and evidence of mucosal ulceration by [CONTACT_396044] (SES-CD) ≥ 6, excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum, on screening endoscopy (or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline), confirmed by a central reader.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500 ([ADDRESS_497953] induction regimen group) subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease, CDAI of ≥ 220 and ≤  450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration, confirmed by [CONTACT_396045].
Methodology:
This Phase 3 study design includes the Screening Period followed by a 12-Week double-blind Induction 
Study and 44-Week double-blind Maintenance Study.  The Induction Study will assess the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission, defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 at Week 4, and endoscopic response, defined as a decrease in Simplified 
Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), as scored by [CONTACT_27709], at Week 12; in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
The Maintenance Study will assess the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in 
maintaining clinical and endoscopic improvements at Week 56.  Analyses of the outcomes from the maintenance regimens are considered exploratory.
During both the Induction Study and the Maintenance Study, visit week designations will represent 
weeks since first dose in the Induction Study.  Week 0 (Baseline) will reflect the date of first adalimumab dosing in the Induction Study.  Week 12 will represent the final assessment in the Induction Study.  Week 56 w ill represent the final assessment in the Maintenance Study (representing 44 weeks of 
maintenance treatment in the Maintenance Study).

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_497955] induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Up to 25% of subjects with previous infliximab exposure may be enrolled.  All subjects who complete the Induction Study (regardless of achievement of response at Week 12) will continue into the Maintenance Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the standard dose regimen, a sample size of 500 ([ADDRESS_497956] dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of endoscopic response in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved dosing regimen.  Thus, by [CONTACT_5259], the expected rate for endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects ([ADDRESS_497957] induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least a 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Since clinical remission at the Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at the Week 12 endpoint are 
not likely to be independent of each other, the power for the co- primary endpoints for the Induction Study 
is expected to be > 98% (see protocol for detailed assumptions of the sample size calculation).
The randomization of subjects for the Induction Study will be stratified by [CONTACT_5019] -sensitivity C-Reactive 
Protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab 
use, and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  Subjects with prior infliximab 
experience will be limited to 25% of the study population.  Subjects assigned to the higher induction 
regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, adalimumab 80 mg at Week 2 and matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
Maintenance Study:
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-blinded exploratory 
treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by [CONTACT_396046], clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_45520]-CD ≤ [ADDRESS_497958] 2013-001746-33

Methodology (Continued):
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week 
beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week (ew) as early as Week [ADDRESS_497959]'s CDAI ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or current visit) as shown by 
[CONTACT_396047].  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will be determined 
by [CONTACT_396048].  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above a reasonably high 
concentration levels in subjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure-endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission was used for selection of concentration threshold to be used in TDM arm.  Based on the PK analyses of concentrations in Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as significant and reliable predictor of remission in adult CD.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects who were in remission at Week 56 in Study M02-433 had serum concentration above 5 μg/mL.  Therefore, the 
lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 5 μg/mL and any subject below 
5μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing.  The second threshold was selected as 10 μg/mL, 
which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) observed in subjects who were in 
remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on 
clinical response as outlined in the table below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL 
will not be dose escalated.

The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period (1 – 4 weeks), a 
12-week double-blind Induction Study and a 44-week M aintenance Study.  The Screening Period may be 
extended as necessary after consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_51040] (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
Clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 20, 26, 28, 34, 40, 42, 48, and 
56/Premature Discontinuation (PD) visits.  An electronic diary will be dispensed at the Screening visit.  In addition to routine physical examination, CDAI calculation, diary review, laboratory, adverse event, concomitant medication and vital sign assessments, the following will be collected:
!Results of study questionnaires (IBDQ, EQ-5D, WPAI) at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 
Week 26, Week 40 and Week 56/PD.
!Calculation of the SFPS at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 14, 
Week 20, Week 26, Week 28, Week 34, Week 40, Week 42, Week 48 and Week 56/PD.  The 
Screening visit results will serve as the Baseline value.
!Results of daily Bristol Stool Form Scale beginning at Baseline through Week 56/PD.
!Results of 11-point Abdominal Pain Rating Scale beginning at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, 
Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.
!Serum for measurement of adalimumab concentrations just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/PD.

!Stool samples for microbiota metagenomic analyses during Screening, at Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, and Week 56/PD.
!Endoscopic evaluations, confirmed by [CONTACT_39582], will be done at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD.
!An optional pharmacogenetic sample should be drawn at Baseline and Week 12.
Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific concomitant 
medications as specified below:
!At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
!Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per 
the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints 
and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from 
that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
!Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
All endpoints for the Exploratory Maintenance Study will be non-ranked. 
Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum adalimumab concentration just prior to dosing 
at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/Premature Discontinuation and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56PD.

Safety:
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Incidence 
of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The co-primary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are proportion of subjects with moderately to 
severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI < 150, at Week [ADDRESS_497988] achieved a decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), at Week 12. The co mparison between treatment groups for the two co-primary efficacy variables will be 
performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by [CONTACT_244105]-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L) (the Screening hs-CRP will serve as the Baseline value), prior infliximab use, and 
Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at baseline.  For the evaluation of co-primary endpoints, missing data of CDAI at Week 4 or missing SES-CD at Week 12 will be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) 
approach.  For Week 4 clinical remission, LOCF, OC and multiple imputation methods will be used as sensitivity analyses.  For Week 12 endoscopic response (decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline [or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]), OC will be used as sensitivity analysis.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Secondary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are divided into two groups.  The first group 
includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by [CONTACT_396052].  Statistical significance is assessed at significance level of 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significance level exceeds 0.05.  No additional statistically significant treatment differences may be declared after the first ranked endpoint fails to achieve statistical significance at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.  The second group includes all other secondary variables.
In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables, including all ef ficacy variables for Maintenance 
Study, will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including factor for treatment 
group, stratification factors and Baseline values, whereas CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_396053].  NRI for missing data will be used for categorical endpoints.  Both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed case (OC) analyses will be performed for continuous endpoints.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic:
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_396054].  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
Immunogenicity:AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each regimen, and rates of AAA positive will be calculated.  
As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Safety:
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study.  All 
safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set.  Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within [ADDRESS_497990] is a study completer and is enrolled in the OLE.  Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of 
treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs of special interest, adverse events leading to death and adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by [CONTACT_240105] (MedDRA version 20.1 or later) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by [CONTACT_396055], and AEs by [CONTACT_396056].  
Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared 
between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby [CONTACT_396057].  Vital signs will be analyzed similarly.

3.0 Introduction
Crohn's disease encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested 
by [CONTACT_396058], transmural, and occas ionally granulomatous inflammation that can 
affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract.[ADDRESS_498008] decades.  Females are affected slightly more than males, and the risk for disease is higher in some ethnic groups.
2,3  In 
North America, the incidence of CD is estimated to be 3.1 to 14.6 cases per 100,000 persons.
2  Prevalence rates range from 26 to 99 cases per 100,000 persons.  In Europe, CD 
has an incidence of 0.7 to 9.8 cases per 100,000 persons and a prevalence of 8.3 to 214 cases per 100,000 persons.
2
Traditionally, therapy for CD has been focused on symptomatic improvement and achievement of clinical remission as measured using the CDAI.  In addition to improving symptoms, an emerging goal of therapy is to improve the condition of the intestinal mucosa.  It has been shown that patients with endoscopic evidence of ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosa are at increased risk of experiencing a complicated disease 
course.
4  Therefore, it is reasonable that another goal of therapy be improvement of the 
intestinal mucosal as visualized on endoscopy; as this has been found to be associated with positive clinical benefits, including higher rates of clinical remission, fewer hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and fewer abdominal surgeries.
5,6  In addition, at the 2012 [LOCATION_002] 
(US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -sponsored Gastroenterology Regulatory 
Endpoints and the Advancement of Therapeutics (GREAT) Workshop, there was significant discussion on the use of endoscopy to support determination of disease activity, as oppos ed to using symptomatic improvements alone.  However, improvement 
of the appearance of the intestinal mucosa may be more difficult to achieve than symptomatic improvement alone as it requires reducing the extent of mucosal ulceration.  A new endpoint for efficacy of therapy was discussed at the Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IOIBD); the achievement of mucosal remission measured as SES-CD of ≤ 2.0.
[ADDRESS_498009] 2013-001746-33
29
Comparison of various efficacy endpoints assessed in the EXTEND study 
(Study M05-769) suggests that when raising the efficacy standard from one that is driven by [CONTACT_396059] (i.e., assessment of improvement in the condition of the intestinal mucosa), there is an overall decrease in both efficacy rate and effect size for adalimumab.

a. Defined as CDAI < 150.
b. Defined as absence of mucosal ulceration as confirmed by [CONTACT_39582]'s visual assessment of the 
ileocolonoscopy.
Note: Four patients randomized to placebo and 2 patients randomized to ADA were excluded from the mucosal 
healing analysis as they had absence of mucosal ulceration at screening (as judged by [CONTACT_396060]).
Exposure-response analyses based on adalimumab trough serum concentration and 
Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI)-based efficacy (remission, CR-70 and CR-100) at Week 4 conducted with data from previous adalimumab induction studies (CLASSIC [Study M02-403] and GAIN [Study M04-691]) have shown that higher Week 4 efficacy 
rates corresponded to higher adalimumab trough serum concentrations in both anti-TNF naïve and anti-TNF experienced subjects.  Therefore, to improve the likelihood of achieving more stringent efficacy endpoints, such as endoscopic improvement of the intestinal mucosa, more intensive treatment with adalimumab may be required.
For the reasons described above, this study is designed to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens (higher and standard) in adult subjects with moderately to severely active CD and evidence of mucosal ulceration.  Additionally, the study will evaluate the sustained efficacy of the standard maintenance therapy of 40 mg adalimumab dosing every other week with subjects whose dosing is either guided by [CONTACT_396061] (Therapeutic Drug Monitoring regimen) or by [CONTACT_396062] (Clinically Adjusted regimen).

3.1 Differences Statement
The primary difference between Study M14-115 and the other CD studies, are the 
inclusion of subjects with evidence of mucosal ulceration defined as SES-CD ≥ 6, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥4, excluding the presence 
of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum on screening endoscopy or endoscopy performed within [ADDRESS_498012] marketing experience exists with adalimumab in a wide range 
of disease states including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (UC).  The safety profile of adalimumab in those indications is well-established with more than 50,[ADDRESS_498013] not altered this safety profile and demonstrated a positive benefit/risk balance.  Conditions which may present a risk specifically  for patients with CD are exclusion 
criteria in this study (e.g., evidence of current colonic dysplasia or active infections).
3.3 Adalimumab Overview
Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody 
containing only human peptide sequences.  Adalimumab is produced by [CONTACT_16238] (DNA) technology in a mammalian cell expression system.  It consists of 1,330 amino acids and has a molecular weight of approximately 148 kilodaltons.  Adalimumab is composed of fully human heavy and light chain variable regions, which confer specificity to human tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and human IgG1 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498014] 2013-001746-33
31
heavy chain and kappa light chain sequences.  Adalimumab binds with high affinity and 
specificity to soluble TNF- α but not to lymphotoxin- α (TNF-β).
TNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and 
immune responses.  Elevated levels of TNF play an important role in pathologic inflammation.  Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by [CONTACT_51003] p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors.  Adalimumab also modulates biological responses that are induced or regulated by [CONTACT_51004].  After treatment with adalimumab, levels of acute phase reactants of inflammation (C-Reactive Protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and serum cytokines rapi[INVESTIGATOR_50948].

4.0 Study Objective
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission (CDAI < 150) at Week 4 and endoscopic response defined as decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline) at Week 12, in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
Additional objectives include:
●Assessing the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in 
reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease at Week 12.
●Assessing the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in reducing signs and symptoms of Crohn's disease at Week 56.
●Assessing pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of two adalimumab 
induction regimens following subcutaneous (SC) administration.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a randomized, double-blind multicenter  study of two adalimumab induction and 
maintenance regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active CD with evidence of 
mucosal ulceration confirmed by [CONTACT_18014].  No placebo arm is planned since there is well-documented efficacy of adalimumab in CD and because the purpose of this study is to achieve better efficacy than the standard induction and maintenance regimens in 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498018] evidence of endoscopic damage confirmed by a central reader, it would be not medically acceptable to deny those subjects effective treatment or feasible to enroll subjects in the trial when adalimumab is available to be prescribed for CD.
Approximately 500 adult subjects with active Crohn 's disease, defined as having a CDAI 
of ≥ 220 and ≤ 450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration defined as SES-CD ≥ 6, excluding 
the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, excluding the presence of 
narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum on screening 
endoscopy or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline, confirmed by a centrally read endoscopy, will be e nrolled at approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_498019] induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be 
approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the 
standard dose regimen, a sample size of 500 ([ADDRESS_498020] dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, 
clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of endoscopic response (decrease > 50% SES-CD from Baseline [or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]) in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved 
dosing regimen.  Thus, by [CONTACT_5259], the expected rate for endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects ([ADDRESS_498021] induction regimen) will be adequate to 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498022] a 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response (decrease >50% SES-
CD from Baseline [or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]) rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 tw o-sided significance level.
Since the clinical remission at Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at Week 12 endpoint are likely not independent of each other, the power for the co-primary endpoints for the study is expected to be > 98% (see Section 8.2for detailed assumptions of the 
sample size calculation).
The randomization of sub jects for the Induction Study will be stratified by [CONTACT_244105]-CRP at 
Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab use, 
and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300), at Baseline.  Enrollment of subjects 
with prior infliximab use will be limit ed to 25% of the to tal study population.
Subjects assigned to the higher induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 
160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard adalimumab induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1.  Subjects will receive 80 mg and matching placebo at Week 2, and then matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-
blinded exploratory treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by [CONTACT_396046], clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator 
reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomization will be further strati fied by [CONTACT_396063]-CD ≤ [ADDRESS_498023] 2013-001746-33

individual variable using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by [CONTACT_779].  No study drug 
will be administered or injected at the final visit.
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive [ADDRESS_498024]'s CDAI is ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥10 mg/L 
(using results from the prior or current visit ).  These subjects will also be allowed to 
escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the CA regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will 
be determined by [CONTACT_396051] ( Table 2 ).  Doses will be determined 
using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, [ADDRESS_498025] 2013-001746-33

Week 12, Week 26, and Week 56/PD.
●Stool samples for microbiota metagenomic analyses during Screening, at Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, and Week 56/PD.  The stool samples should be 
taken before starting bowel preparations for endoscopy.
●Endoscopic evaluations, eligibility confir med by [CONTACT_39582], will be done at 
Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD.
●An optional pharmacogenetic sample should be drawn at Baseline and Week 12.
Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific 
concomitant medications as specified below:
●At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will 
have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid 
taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated 
Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
●Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has 
been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the 
Investigator's discretion during the study .  Subjects in whom the maximum 
steroid dose equivalent exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for 
efficacy assessments (i.e., will be considered non-responders for categorical 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498030] for non-
categorical assessments) from that point forward.  These subjects will continue 
to be evaluated in the safety  population.
●Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.

[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Therapy
Doses of immunosuppressants (including but not limited to) azathioprine, 6-MP, and 
methotrexate and aminosalicylates taken at Baseline will be continued.  Doses must remain stable throughout the duration of the st udy.  Doses may be decreased or terminated 
in the event of treatment-related toxicities (e.g., leukopenia or elevated liver enzymes) considered moderate to severe in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871].
Doses of Crohn's disease related antibiotics taken at Baseline will be continued.  Change 
in dose of Crohn's disease related antibiotics during the study will not be allowed except for treatment related toxicities or concerns about development of antibiotic resistance.  
Newly prescribed CD related antibiotics is not allowed during the study.
Doses of corticosteroids taken at Baseline, as outlined in inclusion criterion [ADDRESS_498063] their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified below and in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the SDP should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
A proposed regimen to taper prednisone dose starts with a weekly decrease by 5 mg/day 
prednisone (or equivalent) for doses > 10 mg/day of prednisone (or equivalent) until a 10 mg/day (or equivalent) dose is reached, then a weekly decrease by 2.5 mg/day (or equivalent) until discontinuation.  A proposed regimen to taper budesonide dose starts with a weekly decrease by 3 mg/day budesonide until discontinuation.
Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical 
response per the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper ha s been initiated may 
have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.  In addition, sub jects in whom the CD-related 
corticosteroids that were not being taken at Baseline and are initiated during the study will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., th ey will be considered non-responders for 
categorical endpoints and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
Subjects may not be on both budesonide and prednisone (or equivalent) simultaneously.
Subjects who enter the study on probiotics ma y continue this therapy provided doses 
remain stable from Baseline throughout the duration of the study.

At the Screening visit, the subject will sign and date a study specific, Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) approved, informed consent form before any study procedures are performed or any medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study.  Details regarding how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.  Consent will be required for any 
optional testing.
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Subjects will be evaluated to ensure they meet all inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at both the Screening and Baseline Visits.Medical, Surgical, and Medication History
A complete medical and surgical history, as well as  a history of tobacco and alcohol use, 
will be obtained from each subject during the Screening Period.  An updated medical 
history will be obtained at the Baseline Visit to ensure that the subject still qualifies.
The location of the subject's Crohn's disease should be recorded in the source documents 
and on the appropriate eCRFs (anal, perianal, rectum, gastroduodenal, ileum, colon,

If it is the site's policy that the radiologist does not sign the final report, the report must include the date of the procedure, the name [CONTACT_396125] a minimum must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_079].
TB Screening
A [COMPANY_003] skin test (alternatively, also known as tuberculin skin test) must be placed or a 
Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or T-SPOT TB test) must be performed during the Screening Period for all subjects including those with a prior history of BCG administration.  If a subject had a negative [COMPANY_003] or IGRA test within [ADDRESS_498083]'s medical history to warrant a repeat test.  These cases must be discussed with the [COMPANY_013] SDP.
For the [COMPANY_003] test:
The subject will be required to have the [COMPANY_003] test read by a licensed healthcare 
professional 48 to 72 hours (or according to manufacturer's guide) after placement when 
the induration is maximal.  An induration (not erythema) of [ADDRESS_498084] be recorded in mm not as positive or negative.  The absence of induration should be recorded as "0 mm," not "negative."  (If required by [CONTACT_396075] a 
two-step test may be performed per local guidelines.  The result of the second test should be recorded.  An induration of 5 mm or greater will be considered as [COMPANY_003] positive.)

that are clinically significant, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_396028].
If the [COMPANY_003] or the IGRA test is positive or the subject has a CXR i ndicative of latent TB, 
the subject will be required to initiate and have taken at least 2 weeks (or per local 
guidelines, whichever is longer) of an ongoing course of Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommended prophylaxis or prophylaxis per local guidelines prior to starting study therapy.
Subjects with a prior history of latent TB that have a documented completion of the CDC 
recommended or local guideline recommended prophylaxis may be permitted to enroll.  If the subject has a prior history of latent TB but has not completed or received prophylaxis, prophylaxis must be initiated for at least 2 weeks (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer) before enrolling into the study.
If the subject has a prior history of active TB they must have documentation of 
completion of CDC recommended or local guideline recommended treatment and documentation of resolution of the infection.
Subjects should be screened for TB using either [COMPANY_003] or IGRA.  In the event both a [COMPANY_003] 
test and an IGRA test are performed, if either one is positive, the subject will be

Anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) assessments will be performed if ANA is 
positive.
In the event that subject develops lupus-like symptoms, ANA sample will be obtained.
hs-CRP
Blood samples for high-sensi tivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) will be obtained per 
Table [ADDRESS_498092].
Blood draws should be performed after all e fficacy assessments, questionnaires (CDAI, 
IBDQ, etc.), and vital sign determinatio ns are obtained and before study drug 
administration during a visit.
Stool Samples Collected
Fecal Calprotectin
Fecal calprotectin will be performed for all subjects as indicated in Table [ADDRESS_498093] be shipped to the central laboratory using dry ice.  Additional information is available in the Investigator Manual provided by [CONTACT_2237].
Subjects who are positive for C. difficile toxin may be treated appropriately and 
re-screened.
Microbiota Metagenomic Analysis
An additional stool microbiota metagenomic an alyses will be performed as indicated in 
Table 3 .  Subjects will be asked to provide a stool sample at the visit, if possible.  Or, 
subjects will be sent home with stool sample supplies and the site will give instructions 
with collection procedures.  At Screenin g, Week 12, and Week 56/PD, the stool sample 
should be collected prior to the bowel preparation for endoscopy has started (if possible) and returned to the site within 3 days of co llection.  A central la boratory(s) will be utilized 
to process these laboratory tests.
Where allowed by [CONTACT_396080], any 
remaining stool could be used for future exploratory analysis of non-genetic biomarkers 
related to the subject's disease and/or response to study drug or additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or development of adverse events.  These samples may also be used for the development of 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498094] confidentiality.  The samples will be retained for no longer than 
20 years after completion of the study (where allowed by [CONTACT_5277]) for possible future research.
Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI)
A CDAI score will be calculated from a subject diary, physical exam, and appropriate 
laboratory values at all study visits beginning at Screening.  The Screening period will be 
a minimum of [ADDRESS_498095] Value Utilized
Week 2 Baseline
Week 4 Week 2
Week 6 Week 4
Week 8 Week 4
Week 12 Week 8
Week 26 Week 12
Week 40 Week 26
Week 56 Week 40
For calculating CDAI at Screening through Week 56/Premature Discontinuation, to answer questions one (1) through three (3), entries from the [ADDRESS_498096] from the diary.
Diary entries should not be included in the 7 days evaluated prior to the visit if:  (1) the 
day the subject received medication for bowel preparation prior to endoscopy, (2) the day 
the subject underwent an endoscopy, and (3) [ADDRESS_498097] recent data for 7 days 
prior to the respective study visit.
For the CDAI questions regarding presence of anal fistulas and other fistulas, all fistulas 
detectable on physical examination (draining and non-draining) should be captured on the CDAI and calculated into the CDAI score.
When completing question five (5) ("Tak ing Lomotil/Imodium/Loperamide/opi[INVESTIGATOR_396031], 0 = no, 1 = yes") on the CDAI, "no" should be answered if a subject is taking an 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573](s) solely for pain.
For question seven (7), hematocrit results from central laboratory will be used for the 
CDAI calculation.  If the hematocrit value contains more than one decimal point, the 
rounding will be allowed to the tenths decimal (e.g., Hct value 33.[ADDRESS_498098] value of 33.45 will be captured as 33.5).  The Hct values either prior to completing the calculation or at the subtotal box [ADDRESS_498099] height is calculated by [CONTACT_396081] (without shoes) 
plus one inch. 
If the body weight obtained at the time of assessment is not captured in kilograms (kg), 
then when converting into kg, rounding should occur using the second digit after the decimal (also known as the hundredth place) where if the number is 0 – 4, then keep the first digit after the decimal (also known as the tenth place) unchanged.  If the second digit after the decimal is 5 – 9, then round up the first digit after the decimal (e.g., 90.246 would be captured as 90.2 and 97.687 would be captured as 97.7).

Corticosteroid Taper
At Week 4, subjects who are on prednisone (or equivalent) or budesonide will taper their 
dose according to the following regimen or a regimen at the investigator's discretion.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the SDP should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
Dose Rate
Prednisone (or equivalent) > 10 mg/day 5 mg/day/week
≤ 10 mg/day 2.5 mg/day/week
Budesonide ≤ 9 mg/day 3 mg/day/week
If the subject should experience a loss of satisfactory clinical response in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject may have his/her corticosteroid dose increased per the investigator's discretion up to and beyond the dose used at Baseline.  Subjects may not be on both oral budesonide and oral prednisone (or equivalent) simultaneously.
Adalimumab

The dosing records will be reviewed and verified for compliance at each visit by [CONTACT_396083].  All relevant dosing information will be retained by [CONTACT_396084].  Additionally, any discernible departure from the protocol regarding study drug administration will be recorded on the source documents and in the appropriate drug accountability form.
Study Drug Dispensing/Administration
Study drug will be administered to all subjects onsite by [CONTACT_396085] (friend, family member or health care professional) during the first visit.  The subject or a designated family member or friend will be trained to administer the SC injections of adalimumab.  Detailed instructions and training for the administration of adalimumab are provided in Appendix G .
Adalimumab injections occurring during study visits  will be performed at the visit by [CONTACT_396086], friend or Healthcare Professional under the supervision of trained medical personnel to reinforce proper aseptic SC injection technique.  Subjects or a trained designated family member, friend or Healthcare Professional will perform the injections of adalimumab in the subject's home during the weeks they are not in for scheduled clinic visits.
Study drug kits are assigned by [CONTACT_21926] /IWRS following the subjects randomized 
treatment schedule.
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498103] study drug kit(s).  The first syringe will be admin istered at the site and the remaining kits 
containing syringes will be sent home with the subject.  Subjects must be reminded to take the syringes in the assigned kits in the order dispensed by [CONTACT_396087].
Subjects should administer study drug on the same day of the week.  The dosing dates for 
all doses of study drug should be calculated from the Baseline Visit date.  A ± 3-day window is allowable for scheduled study dosing dates.  For subjects that deviate from this dosing window, every effort should be made to bring the subject back to the original dosing schedule as soon as possible.  For situations where bringing the subject back on the original dosing schedule will cause the dose to be out of the ± 3-day window, please contact [CONTACT_396088].
At all office visits, subjects should be observed after study drug administration until 
judged clinically stable by [CONTACT_44518].  If an anaphylactic reaction or other serious allergic reaction occurs, administrati on of study drug should be discontinued 
immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.  Wh en dosing at home subjects should be 
instructed to contact [CONTACT_396089] a reaction.  If subjects are unable to reach their study site or experience life-threatening symptoms, they will be instructed to call an emergency number or proceed to the nearest emergency room and then inform the site as soon as possible.
Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused syringes, sharp containers and 
empty boxes at each visit for accountability.

Endoscopy
An endoscopy will be performed on the following visits:
●During Screening*
●Week 12
●Week 56/Premature Discontinuation if PD occurs after Week [ADDRESS_498105] a Week 12 and 56/PD Endoscopy.  Site staff should schedule the Week 12 Endoscopy during the Baseline visit, if possible.  For subjects that PD, the site should attempt to reschedule the Endoscopy prior to the discontinuation visit.
*An endoscopy performed before the Screening visit, may be used as the Screening endoscopy, with the approval of the [COMPANY_013] Study Designated Physician, if the following 
conditions are met:
1. biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis is available according to section "Biopsy 
During Endoscopy" below.
2. the endoscopy took place within  [ADDRESS_498106] 2013-001746-33

on the provided SES-CD score sheet, refer to Appendix M .  The findings should be 
entered in the appropriate eCRF.  Videos from Screening endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_396032] (i.e., subjects with an SES-CD ≥ 6, excluding 
the presence of narrowing component, (or SES-CD ≥ 4, excluding the presence of 
narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum), and all Week 12 and Week 56/PD endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_396033].  Two primary central reviewers will evaluate the data and provide their score.  If the SES-CD scores are discrepant between the two readers, a third central reviewer will review the video and choose between the first and second reviewers' scores.  The third reviewer's cho ice 
between the reviewers' scores will be considered final.  This process will apply to all video endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_396034].  The adjudicator's assessment will be considered final.  If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the Screening endoscopy does not indicate the SES-CD criter ia confirming study eligibility, the subject 
should be screen-failed and the video should not be sent for central review.  Endoscopic eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_396090].  The same endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_541], where possible, should perform all endoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
The endoscopy during the Screening Period or endoscopy performed within 45 days 
before Baseline and Week 56/PD will be used to provide the endoscopy subscores for calculating the Simplified Endoscopic Score (SES-CD) at Screening, Week 12, and Week 56/PD, refer to Appendix M .  The SES-CD values provided by [CONTACT_396091].
Biopsy During Endoscopy
Appropriate documentation of biopsy results consistent with the diagnosis of CD, in the 
assessment of the Investigator, must be available in order to confirm the subject's eligibility for the study.  If this documen tation is not  available, a diagnostic biopsy from 
the most affected area of the ileum/colon must be performed during Screening and read by a qualified local pathologist and the results reviewed by [CONTACT_737].  Biopsies to evaluate suspi[INVESTIGATOR_396035]'s

The signed pathology reports confirming diagnosis and when appropriate, ruling out 
current dysplasia/malignancy will be monitored by [CONTACT_396092] (CRA) and kept with the subject's source documents onsite.  Subjects should not be enrolled if colon dysplasia or malignancy is discovered at Screening endoscopy or endoscopy performed within [ADDRESS_498108] should be discontinued from the study.

5.3.6 Pharmacogenetic and Serologic Variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacogenetic Variables
Samples may be sequenced and data analy zed for DNA sequences contributing to the 
disease or to subject's response to adalimumab, in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, 
tolerability and safety.  Such DNA sequences may include those related to drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, the ta rget pathway, or others related to the 
disease or to drug response.  Some DNA sequences that are currently insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis.  The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests.  The results of pharmacogenetic analyses may not be reported with the study summary.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serologic Variables
Samples may be analyzed for plasma and serum proteins, peptides, and non-protein 
soluble factors such as lipi[INVESTIGATOR_396037]. 
Where allowed by [CONTACT_396096], serum 
may be stored for possible future research.  Samples will be stored frozen for future exploratory analysis of non-genetic biomarkers related to the subject's disease and/or response to study drug or additional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or development of adverse events.  These samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests.  Results of exploratory analyses, if any, will not be reported with  the study summary.  [COMPANY_013] will store the 
samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  As allowed by [CONTACT_5277], the samples will be retained for up to [ADDRESS_498136] exploratory investigations 
into known and novel biomarkers.  The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to:  nucleic acids, proteins, lipi[INVESTIGATOR_94421]. 
Biomarker assessments may be used to assess and generate prognostic, predictive, 
pharmacodynamic, or surrogate biomarker signatures.  These assessments may be explored in the context of Inflammatory Bowe l Disease or related conditions and/or 
adalimumab or drugs of similar class.  The results from these analyses are exploratory in nature and may not be included with the study report.
The samples may also be used to develop new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], research methods or 
technologies.  In addition, samples from this study may be banked for future use.  Samples may then be used to validate putative biomarker signatures obtained from a prospective study, leading to the development of diagnostic tests.

●Inclusion and exclusion criteria violation was noted after the subject started 
study drug, when continuation of the study would place the subject at risk as 
determined by [CONTACT_396098] (see Section 5.2and Section 7.0).
●Introduction of prohibited medications or dosages when continuation of the study drug would place the subject at risk as determined by [CONTACT_396098].
●Subject is non-compliant with TB prophylaxis.
●The subject becomes pregnant while on study drug.
●Subject has dysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract or a malignancy, except for localized non-melanoma skin cancer.  Discontinuation for carcinoma in-situ of the cervix is at the discre tion of the Investigator.  
●Subject is diagnosed with lupus-like syndrome, multiple sclerosis or demyelinating disease.
●Subject is significantly non -compliant with study procedures which would put 
the subject at risk for continued participation in the trial, as determined by [CONTACT_737], in consultation with the [COMPANY_013] SDP.
If, during the course of study drug administration, the subject prematurely discontinues 
study drug use, the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation Visit must be completed within [ADDRESS_498139]'s condition.  Following discontinuation of the study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment.
A final phone call will be made to the subject approximately [ADDRESS_498140] dose of 
study drug to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/SAEs or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs.  The 70-day follow-up phone call will not be required for any subject that initiates commercial adalimumab.
All attempts must be made to determine the date of the last dose of study drug and the 
primary reason for premature discontinuation.  The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.

5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, ei ther in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to [COMPANY_013] in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by [CONTACT_176432] y if the study is stopped due to safety 
concerns.  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will immediately notify the investigator by [CONTACT_396099].
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
During the randomized double-blind Induction Study, subjects assigned to the higher 
induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg (4 syringes) at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg (1 syringe) eow through Week 12.
Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 
160 mg (4 syringes) at Baseline and matching placebo (4 syringes) at Week 1.  Subjects will receive 80 mg (2 syringes) and placebo (2 syringes) at Week 2 and matching placebo (4 syringes) at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive 40 mg (1 syringe) eow through Week 12.
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-
blinded exploratory treatment regimens (a dalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen 
and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by [CONTACT_396046], clinical response (CR-70)

status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator 
reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline atWeek 12, the randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_396063]-CD ≤ [ADDRESS_498143] a 2 point reduction versus baseline and no subscore greater than 1 in any individual variable using the Week 12 SES-CD value provided by [CONTACT_779].
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive [ADDRESS_498144]'s CDAI is ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L 
(using results from the prior or current visi t).  These subjects will also be allowed to 
escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the CA regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will 
be determined by [CONTACT_396051] ( Table 2 ).  Doses will be determined 
using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period of 
1 to 4 weeks, ± 3 days which is granted around all study visits, a 12-week double-blind 
period Induction Study, and a 44-week Maintena nce Study.  The Screening period may be 
extended as necessary after consul tation and a pproval with the [COMPANY_013] Study Designated 
Physician (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498145] results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for 
subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
No dose will be given at the final visit.

5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by [CONTACT_396100].  Subjects who meet the entry criteria in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 will 
proceed to be enrolled into the study.  Subjects who enter the study will be rando mized at 
Baseline in a 3:[ADDRESS_498149] 2013-001746-33
99
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-
blinded exploratory treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically ad justed [CA] regimen 
and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).
The sites will be provided with appropriate kit number(s) for drug-dispensing purpose for 
each subject by [CONTACT_6606].  Before the study is initiated, the directions for the IVRS will be provided to each site.  Study drug will be administered at the study visits summarized in Table [ADDRESS_498150] Diary.
Doses not administered (e.g., not taken before ne xt dose is scheduled), should be recorded 
as not taken in the source.  The extra dose should be returned to the study site full.  The 
subject should resume their regular dosing schedule based on the first dosing date at Baseline.
5.5.5 Blinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding of Investigational Product
All [COMPANY_013] personally with direct oversi ght of the conduct and management of the trial 
(with the exception of [COMPANY_013]'s Drug Suppl y Management Team) the Investigator, study 
site personnel and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout

the blinded period of the study.  The IVRS/IWRS will provide access to blinded subject 
treatment information in the case of medical emergency.
In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator believes that knowledge of 
study drug treatment is required, every effort  must be made to contact [CONTACT_396098] 
(see Section 7.0) prior to breaking the blind, as long as it does not compromise subject 
safety.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be conveyed to [COMPANY_013] and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated representatives will dispense study drug only for 
use by [CONTACT_51046]. 
The subject or their qualified designee will administer all dos es of study drug.  
Appropriate site staff will supervise the subject's administration of the study drug at 
required in-office study visits to ensure proper injection technique.  In order to document 
compliance with the treatment regimen, the s ubject will be given a diary to record all 
injection dates and times.  Compliance information will be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Subjects will be counseled on missed doses of medication.  If the subject does not return the diary, IP boxes and sharp containers (when applicable), the site should question the subject and obtain as much information as possible as to the dosing of the study drug.
The information should be documented on the source documents as per "best recollection" 
and when possible, re-verified when the diary is returned before completing on the applicable eCRF page.

In addition, an accurate running inventory of study drug will be kept by [CONTACT_51049] a Site 
Drug Accountability log including date received, the lot number, kit number(s), date 
dispensed, subject number, and the identification with date of the person dispensing the 
drug.  For this study, unless otherwise prohibited locally, these records will be maintained electronically as part of the IVRS/IWRS system.
All empty IP boxes and used pre-filled syringes will be inventoried by [CONTACT_396101]-filled syringes.  Empty IP boxes and Sharps containers should be returned by [CONTACT_355294].  Empty boxes and returned Sharps containers will be retained (unless prohibited by [CONTACT_396102]/procedure) until the CRA is on site to confirm the returned medication.  CRAs and site staff will complete study drug accoun tability via study drug logs, source 
documents, subject dosing diary sheets, empty IP boxes and by [CONTACT_396103].  Used Sharps containers should never be opened.  Once the CRA has verified drug accountability at the site, the site staff and CRA will document that the used pre-filled syringes have been destroyed, using appropriate biohazard precautions, when appropriate.  A copy of the destruction methodology should be  maintained at the site's facility.  Unused medication will be 
returned by [CONTACT_396104].

5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The use of an induction dose higher than the approved dose of 160/80 mg (Week 0/2) is 
supported by [CONTACT_80063]-efficacy modeling analyses from the pi[INVESTIGATOR_396038] M02-403 (anti-TNF naïve subjects) and Study M04-691 (anti-TNF experienced subjects).

M14-[ADDRESS_498156] 2013-001746-33

The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above 
reasonably high concentration levels in s ubjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure and 
endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission was used for the selection of concentration thresholds to be used in the TDM regimen.  Based on the PK analyses of adalimumab concentrations in the adult Crohn's disease studies, Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as a significant and reliable predictor of remission.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in the clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects, who were in remission at Week [ADDRESS_498157] udy M02-433, had serum concentration levels 
above 5 μ g/mL.  The lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 
5 μg/mL; thus, any subject below 5 μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing 
regardless of their CDAI or hs-CRP level.  The second threshold was selected as 10μg/mL, which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) 
observed in subjects who were in remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on clin ical response as outlined in the table 
below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL will not be dose 
escalated.

For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the us e of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498161] 2013-001746-33
105
event.  Laboratory abnormalities  and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention (see Section 6.2regarding toxicity management) and/or if the 
investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing c ondition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned pri or to study entry.  However, if the 
pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
SAE within [ADDRESS_498162]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).

outcomes listed above (i.e., d eath of subject, life-threatening, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital 
anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or 
stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not repor ted a causality or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_396039], another cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_147575].

8.1.4 Statistical Analyses of Efficacy
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Variable for Induction Study
The co-primary efficacy variables for Induction Study are proportion of subjects with 
moderately to severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI 
< 150, at Week [ADDRESS_498176] achieved endoscopic response, defined as a decrease > 50% SES-CD from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline) at Week 12.
The comparisons between treatment group difference on the two co-primary efficacy 
variables for Induction Study will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by [CONTACT_244105]-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), prior 
infliximab use, and Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A CMH 
based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at Baseline.  Missing CDAI at Week 4 or SES-CD at Week 12 will be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) approach.
For Week 4 clinical remission, LOCF, OC and multiple imputation methods will be used 
as sensitivity analyses.  For Week 12 endoscopic response, OC will be used as sensitivity analysis.
In addition, as sensitivity analyses, th e logistic regression including treatment, the 
randomizatio n stratification factors and additional clinically important factors such as 
corticosteroid use at Baseline, IMM use at Baseline, Baseline fecal calprotectin, Baseline 
SES-CD, and Region (US versus ex-US), will also be performed for the co-primary endpoints.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Variables for Induction Study
Secondary efficacy variables are divided into two groups.  The first group includes ranked 
secondary endpoints, which are ranked by [CONTACT_396105].  Statistical significance is 
assessed at 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significant level exceeds 
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498177] adjusted forstratification variables.  Additionally, the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions will be provided.  The non-responder imputation will be used for subjects with missing data at the endpoint evalu ated.  The last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) method will also be used as the sensitivity analyses for the primary and ranked secondary endpoints.
Change from Baseline in continuous ranked and non-ranked secondary endpoints will be 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model including factors of treatment and adjusting for the baseline values and the stratification variables.  For analyses of changes from Baseline variables, both LOCF and OC analyses will be performed.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Variables for Maintenance Study
For categorical endpoints, the difference in proportions of subjects between treatment 
groups will be analyzed using the CMH test adjusted for stratification variables.  Additionally, the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference in proportions will be provided.  The non-responder imputation will be used for subjects with missing data at the endpoint evaluated.  The last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will also be used as the sensitivity analyses for th e primary and ranked secondary endpoints.
Change from Baseline in continuous ranked and non-ranked secondary endpoints will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model including factors of treatment and adjusting for the baseline values and the stratification variables.  For analyses of changes from Baseline

M14-[ADDRESS_498178] Model Repeated 
Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
8.1.5 Statistical Analyses of Safety
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in 
this study.  All safety comparisons will be performed for both induction and maintenance periods between treatment groups using the safety analysis set.
Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the 
first dose of the study drug and within [ADDRESS_498179] is a completer and is enrolled in the OLE.
Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; 
b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs of special interest such as adverse events leading 
to death and adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by [CONTACT_240105] (M edDRA version 20.1 or 
later) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by [CONTACT_396055], 
and AEs by [CONTACT_396106].  
Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared 
between treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  In addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby [CONTACT_396107].  Vital signs will be

8.1.8 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_396108].  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.  The relationship between adalimumab concentrations and clinical response will be determined as appropriate.
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each dose, and rates of AAA positive will be 
calculated.  As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment-emergent adverse events may be evaluated.  HACA w ill be 
evaluated for each subject and each dose, and rates of HACA positive will be calculated.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
The calculated Week 4 remission rate for higher dose regimen are based on the average of 
the PK-PD Linear model and E
maxmodel and is 56% [(70% [Linear] + 42% [E max]) / 2] 
for infliximab naïve subjects and 45% [(60% [Linear] + 30% [E max]) / 2] for infliximab 
experienced subjects.  Assuming the ratio in the proposed study of infliximab naïve subjects versus infliximab experienced is 75% versus 25%, respectively, the weighted Week 4 remission rate will be approximately 50% for higher induction dose regimen.  For the standard dose regimen, the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 30%.  Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_498182] induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind period.  A sample size of 500 ([ADDRESS_498183] dose) will 
be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, 
clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts a ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response is expected.  The observed rate of
Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498184] 2013-001746-33
120
endoscopic response in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved 
dosing regimen.  Thus, by [CONTACT_5259], the expected rate endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects ([ADDRESS_498185] induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least an 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificance level.
Since the clinical remission at Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at Week 12 endpoint are likely not independent of each other, the power for the co-primary endpoints for the study is expected to be > 98%.
8.3 Randomization Methods
At Baseline, subjects will be randomized 3:2 to one of two double-blinded adalimumab 
Induction Study regimens (higher induction regimen or standard induction regimen).  The randomizatio n will be stratified by [CONTACT_244105]-CRP at Bas eline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using 
Screening hs-CRP values, prior infliximab use, Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, 
> 300) at Baseline.  
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in  a 1:1 ratio to one  of two doubl e-blinded 
exploratory tr eatment re gimens (clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab 
therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-ra ndomization at Week 12 will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_396046], clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12, 
and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline p er the site investigator reading at Week 
12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomizatio n will be further stratified by [CONTACT_396109]-CD ≤ [ADDRESS_498186] 2013-001746-33

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) GCP.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by [CONTACT_13125], will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by [CONTACT_427].  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by [CONTACT_427]) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].
9.[ADDRESS_498187] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Any optional testing will only be performed if the subject has voluntarily signed and dated 
a separate informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The separate 
informed consent must be signed before the optional testing is performed.  If the subject 
does not consent to the optional testing, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, stored biomarker 
and optional samples will continue to be used for research and analysis.  In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request that their samples not be analyzed.  Once [COMPANY_013] receives the request, remaining biomarker and/or optional samples will be destroyed.  However, if the subject changes his/her consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will remain as part of the overall research data.

Injection Procedures (PFS)
1. Setting up for an injection
●Find a clean flat surface.
●Do not use if the seals on the carton are broken or missing.  Contact [CONTACT_51081]'s office if the seals are broken.
●Take one kit with the prefilled syringe(s) of adalimumab from the refrigerator.  
Do not use a prefilled syringe that has been frozen or if it has been left in direct 
sunlight.
●Return any unused syringe(s) to the refrigerator.
You will need the follo wing items for each dose:
●study medication in pre-filled syringe(s)
●alcohol prep(s)
●cotton ball or gauze pad(s)

Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498215] all of the items you need to give y ourself an injecti on, call your study 
physician.  Use only the items provided in the box your adalimumab comes in.
●Make sure the liquid in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless.  Do not use 
a prefilled syringe if the liquid is cloudy or discolored or has flakes or particles 
in it.
●Have a special sharps (puncture proof) container nearby [CONTACT_396116].
For your protection, it is  important that y ou follow these instructions.
2. Choosing and preparing an injection site
●Wash your hands well.
●Choose a site on the front of your thighs  or your stomach area (abdomen).  If 
you choose your abdomen, you should avoid the area 2 inches around your 
belly button (navel).
●Choose a different site each t ime you give y ourself an injection.  Each new 
injection should be  given at least one inch from a site you used before.  Never 
inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red or hard or where you have scars or stretch marks.
●If you have psoriasis, you should try not  to inject directly into any raised, 
thick, red or scaly skin patches or lesions.

Adalimumab
M14-[ADDRESS_498216] 2013-001746-33
154
●You may find it helpful to keep notes on the location of your injection sites.
●Wipe the site where adalimumab is to be injected with an alcohol prep (swab), 
using a circular motion.  Do not touch this area again until you are ready to 
inject.
3. How to prepare your adalimumab dose for injection with a Prefilled Syringe
●Hold the syringe upright with the needle facing down.  Check to make sure that the amount of liquid in the syringe is the same or close to the 0.[ADDRESS_498217] amount of liquid, do not use that syringe.  
Call your study doctor.
●Remove the needle cover taking care not to touch the needle with your fingers or allow it to touch any surface.
●Turn the syringe so the needle is facing up and slowly push the plunger in to push the air in the syringe out through the needle.  If a small drop of liquid 
comes out of the needle that is okay.
●Do not shake the syringe.

4. Injecting Adalimumab
●With your other hand, gently squeeze an area of the cleaned area of skin and 
hold it firmly.
●You will inject into this raised area of skin.  Hold the syringe like a pencil at about a 45° angle (see pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103]) to the skin.
●With a quick, short, "dart-like" motion, push the needle into the skin.
●After the needle is in, let go of the skin.  Pull back slightly on the plunger.  If blood appears in the syringe it means that you have entered a blood vessel.  Do 
not inject adalimumab.  Pull the needle out of the skin and repeat the steps to 
choose and clean a new injection site.  Do not use the same syringe.  Dispose of it in your special sharps containe r.  If no blood appears, slowly push the 
plunger all the way in until all of the adalimumab is injected.
●When the syringe is empty, remove the needle from the skin keepi[INVESTIGATOR_50979].
●Press a cotton ball or gauze pad over the injection site and hold it for 
[ADDRESS_498219] slight bleeding.  This is normal.
●Dispose of the syringe right away into your special sharps container.

Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate Higher Versus Standard 
Adalimumab Dosing Regimens for Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Crohn's Disease and Evidence of Mucosal Ulceration
Objectives:
The objective of Study M14-115 is to evaluate efficacy and safety of higher induction and maintenance 
dosing regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Study Population:   Males and females ≥ 18 and ≤  75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately to 
severely active Crohn's disease, CDAI ≥ 220 and ≤  450, and evidence of mucosal ulceration by [CONTACT_396044] (SES-CD) ≥ 6, excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum, on screening endoscopy (or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline), confirmed by a central reader.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 600 ([ADDRESS_498229] induction regimen group) subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease, CDAI of ≥ 220 and ≤  450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration, confirmed by [CONTACT_396045].
Methodology:
This Phase 3 study design includes the Screening Period followed by a 12-Week double-blind Induction 
Study and 44-Week double-blind Maintenance Study.  The Induction Study will assess the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission, defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 at Week 4, and endoscopic improvement, defined as Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) ≤ [ADDRESS_498230] a 2 point reduction versus baseline and no subscore 
greater than 1 in any individual variable at Week 12, in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
The Maintenance Study will assess the efficacy and safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in 
maintaining clinical and endoscopic improvements at Week 56.  Analyses of the outcomes from the maintenance regimens are considered exploratory.
During both the Induction Study and the Maintenance Study, visit week designations will represent 
weeks since first dose in the Induction Study.  Week 0 (Baseline) will reflect the date of first adalimumab dosing in the Induction Study.  Week 12 will represent the final assessment in the Induction Study. Week 56 w ill represent the final assessment in the Maintenance Study (representing 44 weeks of 
maintenance treatment in the Maintenance Study).

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_498232] induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Up to 25% of subjects with previous infliximab exposure may be enrolled.  All subjects who complete the Induction Study (regardless of achievement of response at Week 12) will continue into the Maintenance Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the standard dose regimen, a sample size of 600 ([ADDRESS_498233] dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic improvement compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of SES-CD ≤ 4 in Study M05-769 was 37% at Week 12 with the currently approved dosing 
regimen.  Thus, by [CONTACT_5259], the expected rate for SES-CD ≤ 4 at Week 12 using the higher 
induction regimen is 55%.  A sample size of 600 subjects ([ADDRESS_498234] induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least an 18% treatment difference in endoscopic improvement rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 98% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Since clinical remission at the Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic improvement at the Week 12 
endpoint are not likely to be independent of each other, the power for the co-primary endpoints for the Induction Study is expected to be > 97% (see protocol for detailed assumptions of the sample size calculation).
The randomization of subjects for the Induction Study w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_396118]-sensitivity C-Reactive 
Protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab 
use, and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  Subjects with prior infliximab 
experience will be limited to 25% of the study population.  Subjects assigned to the higher induction 
regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, adalimumab 80 mg at Week 2 and matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
Maintenance Study:
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-blinded exploratory 
treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by [CONTACT_396046], clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and endoscopic response status (decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline) per the site investigator reading at Week 12.  Among Week 12 endoscopic responders, the randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_396119], defined as achievement of an SES-CD ≤ [ADDRESS_498235] 2013-001746-33
167
Methodology (Continued):
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week 
beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week (ew) as early as Week [ADDRESS_498236]'s CDAI ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or current visit) as shown by 
[CONTACT_396047].  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will be determined 
by [CONTACT_396048].  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above a reasonably high 
concentration levels in subjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure-endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission wa s used for selection of concentration threshold 
to be used in TDM arm.  Based on the PK analyses of concentrations in Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as significant and reliable predictor of remission in adult CD.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects who were in remission at Week 56 in Study M02-433 had serum concentration above 5 μg/mL.  Therefore, the 
lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 5 μg/mL and any subject below 
5μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing.  The second threshold was selected as 10 μg/mL, 
which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) observed in subjects who were in 
remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on 
clinical response as outlined in the table below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL 
will not be dose escalated.

The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period (1 – 4 weeks), a 
12-week double-bli nd Induction Study and a 44-week Maintenance Study.  The Screening Period may be 
extended as necessary after consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_51040] (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
Clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 20, 26, 28, 34, 40, 42, 48, and 
56/Premature Discontinuation (PD) visits.  An electronic diary will be dispensed at the Screening visit.  In addition to routine physical examination, CDAI calculation, diary review, laboratory, adverse event, concomitant medication and vital sign assessments, the following will be collected:

Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific concomitant 
medications as specified below:
!At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
!Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per 
the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints 
and will have Baseline values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from that point 
forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
!Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum adalimumab concentration just prior to dosing 
at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/Premature Discontinuation and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56PD.
Blood samples will also be collected for measurement of infliximab serum levels and Human 
Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) just prior to dosing at Baseline.
Exploratory Research Using Intestinal Mucosal Biopsy Samples (Optional):
Optional intestinal biopsies will be collected with consent at Screening, Week 12, and Week [ADDRESS_498266] potential biomarker signatures and new drug targets for IBD.  Assessments will include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites or lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].
Safety:
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Incidence 
of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The co-primary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are proportion of subjects with moderately to 
severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI < 150, at Week [ADDRESS_498267] achieved endoscopic improvement defined as an SES-CD ≤ [ADDRESS_498268] a 2 point reduction versus baseline and no subscore 
greater than 1 in any individual variable at Week 12. The comparison between treatment groups for the two co-primary efficacy va riables will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_244105]-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L) (the Screening hs-CRP will serve as the 
Baseline value), prior infliximab use, and Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A 
CMH based two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at baseline.  Missing CDAI at Week 4 or missing SES-CD at Week 12 w ill be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) 
approach.  For Week [ADDRESS_498269] group 
includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by [CONTACT_396052].  Statistical significance is assessed at 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significance level exceeds 0.05.  No additional statistically significant treatment differences may be declared after the first ranked endpoint fails to achieve 0.05.  The second group includes all other additional secondary variables.

Efficacy (Continued):
In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables, including all efficacy variables for Maintenance 
Study, will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including factor for treatment group, stratification factors and Baseline values, whereas CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_396120].  NRI for missing data will be used for categorical endpoints.  Both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed case (OC) analyses will be performed for continuous endpoint.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic:Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_396054].  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
Immunogenicity:
AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each regimen, and rates of AAA positive will be calculated.  
As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Safety:
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study.  All 
safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set.  Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within [ADDRESS_498271] is a study completer and is enrolled in the OLE.  Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of

Name [CONTACT_26323]:   Adalimumab Phase of Development:   3
Name [CONTACT_3261]:   Adalimumab Date of Protocol Synopsis:   27 November 2018
Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind Study to Evaluate Higher Versus Standard 
Adalimumab Dosing Regimens for Induction and Maintenance Therapy in Subjects with Moderately to 
Severely Active Crohn's Disease and Evidence of Mucosal Ulceration
Objectives:
The objective of Study M14-115 is to evaluate efficacy and safety of higher induction and maintenance 
dosing regimens in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 150 sites worldwide.
Study Population:   Males and females ≥ 18 and ≤  75 years of age with a diagnosis of moderately to 
severely active Crohn's disease, CDAI ≥ 220 and ≤  450, and evidence of mucosal ulceration by [CONTACT_396044] (SES-CD) ≥ 6, excluding the presence of narrowing component, or SES-CD ≥ 4, 
excluding the presence of narrowing component, for patients with disease limited to the ileum, on screening endoscopy (or endoscopy performed within 45 days before Baseline), confirmed by a central reader.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500 ([ADDRESS_498273] induction regimen group) subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's Disease, CDAI of ≥ 220 and ≤  450 and evidence of mucosal ulceration, confirmed by [CONTACT_396121].
Methodology:
This Phase 3 study design includes the Screening Period followed by a 12-Week double-blind Induction 
Study and 44-Week double-blind Maintenance Study.  The Induction Study will assess the efficacy and 
safety of two adalimumab induction regimens in achieving clinical remission, defined as Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) < 150 at Week 4, and endoscopic response, defined as a decrease in Simplified Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), as scored by [CONTACT_27709], at Week 12; in subjects with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and evidence of mucosal ulceration at Baseline.
The Maintenance Study will assess the efficacy a nd safety of two adalimumab maintenance regimens in 
maintaining clinical and endoscopic improvements at Week 56.  Analyses of the outcomes from the 
maintenance regimens are considered exploratory.
During both the Induction Study and the Maintenance Study, visit week designations will represent 
weeks since first dose in the Induction Study.  Week 0 (Baseline) will reflect the date of first adalimumab dosing in the Induction Study.  Week 12 will represent the final assessment in the Induction Study.  Week 56 w ill represent the final assessment in the Maintenance Study (representing 44 weeks of 
maintenance treatment in the Maintenance Study).

Methodology (Continued):
Subjects who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the 
study and randomized in a 3:[ADDRESS_498275] induction adalimumab regimen during the double-blind Induction Study.  Up to 25% of subjects with previous infliximab exposure may be enrolled.  All subjects who complete the Induction Study (regardless of achievement of response at Week 12) will continue into the Maintenance Study.  Assuming the Week 4 clinical remission rate will be approximately 50% for the higher induction dose regimen and approximately 30% for the standard dose regimen, a sample size of 500 ([ADDRESS_498276] dose) will be adequate to detect at least a 20% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 4 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided si gnificant level.
Since exposure/endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission will be based on PK/PD modeling which predicts an expected ~50% increase in the proportion of subjects with endoscopic response compared to the standard adalimumab induction regimen.  The observed rate of endoscopic response in Study M05-769 was 44% at Week 12 with the currently approved dosing regimen.  Thus, by [CONTACT_5259], the expected rate for endoscopic response at Week 12 using the higher induction regimen is 66%.  A sample size of 500 subjects ([ADDRESS_498277] induction regimen) will be adequate to detect at least a 22% treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the dosing regimens using Fisher's exact test with approximately 99% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level.
Since clinical remission at the Week 4 endpoint and the endoscopic response at the Week 12 endpoint are 
not likely to be independent of each other, the power for the co- primary endpoints for the Induction Study 
is expected to be > 98% (see protocol for detailed assumptions of the sample size calculation).
The randomization of subjects for the Induction Study will be stratified by [CONTACT_5019]-sensitivity C-Reactive 
Protein (hs-CRP) at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L), using the Screening hs-CRP value, prior infliximab 
use, and Crohn's disease activity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  Subjects with pri or infliximab 
experience will be limited to 25% of the study population.  Subjects assigned to the higher induction 
regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline, Week 1, Week 2, and Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week (eow) through Week 12.  Subjects assigned to the standard induction regimen will receive blinded adalimumab 160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, adalimumab 80 mg at Week 2 and matching placebo at Week 3.  At Week 4, subjects will receive adalimumab 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
Maintenance Study:
At Week 12, subjects will be re-randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two double-blinded exploratory 
treatment regimens (adalimumab clinically adjusted [CA] regimen and adalimumab therapeutic drug monitoring [TDM] regimen).  The re-randomization at Week 12 will be stratified by [CONTACT_396046], clinical response (CR-70) status at Week 12 and decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline per the site investigator reading at Week 12.  Among subjects achieving SES-CD > 50% from Baseline at Week 12, the randomization will be further stratified by [CONTACT_45520]-CD ≤ [ADDRESS_498278] 2013-001746-33
181
Methodology (Continued):
Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week 
beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week (ew) as early as Week [ADDRESS_498279]'s CDAI ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or current visit) as shown by 
[CONTACT_396047].  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized to the TDM will be determined 
by [CONTACT_396048].  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.
The goal of the TDM regimen is to attain and maintain serum adalimumab levels above a reasonably high 
concentration levels in subjects for mucosal healing.  Since exposure-endoscopic relationships are not currently available for adalimumab, clinical remission was used for selection of concentration threshold to be used in TDM arm.  Based on the PK analyses of concentrations in Studies M02-403, M04-691 and M02-433, no concentration level could be identified as significant and reliable predictor of remission in adult CD.  Therefore, the TDM regimen will be based on two concentration thresholds in conjunction with clinical response criteria as expected to occur in clinical setting.  About 75% of the subjects who were in remission at Week 56 in Study M02-433 had serum concentration above 5 μ g/mL.  Therefore, the 
lower concentration threshold for the TDM regimen was selected as 5 μ g/mL and any subject below 
5μg/mL concentration will be escalated to ew dosing.  The second threshold was selected as 10 μg/mL, 
which is similar to the median concentrations (9.4 μg/mL at Week 56) observed in subjects who were in 
remission.  The subjects with concentration above 5 and below 10 μg/mL may be dose escalated based on 
clinical response as outlined in the table below.  The subjects with serum concentration above 10 μg/mL 
will not be dose escalated.

The duration of the study could be up to 60 weeks which includes a Screening Period (1 – 4 weeks), a 
12-week double-blind Induction Study and a 44-week Maintenance Study.  The Screening Period may be extended as necessary after consultation with and approval by [CONTACT_51040] (SDP) for subjects who require initiation of prophylactic anti-tuberculosis (TB) therapy, or in case of external, not subject-related circumstances (e.g., due to delay of availability of screening test results).  There will also be a 70-day follow-up phone call for subjects who complete Week 56 or discontinue from the study prematurely.
Clinical evaluation will occur at Baseline, Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 14, 20, 26, 28, 34, 40, 42, 48, and 
56/Premature Discontinuation (PD) visits.  An electronic diary will be dispensed at the Screening visit.  In addition to routine physical examination, CDAI calculation, diary review, laboratory, adverse event, concomitant medication and vital sign assessments, the following will be collected:
!Results of study questionnaires (IBDQ, EQ-5D, WPAI) at Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, 
Week 26, Week 40 and Week 56/PD.

!An optional pharmacogenetic sample should be drawn at Baseline and Week 12.
Throughout the study, subjects will only be allowed to change the dosage of CD-specific concomitant 
medications as specified below:
!At Week 4, subjects who are taking corticosteroid therapy at Baseline will have their corticosteroid therapy tapered according to a tapering schedule specified in the clinical study protocol.  If the Investigator feels that the steroid taper is not advisable for a particular subject at Week 4, the Study Designated Physician (SDP) should be consulted for evaluation and approval.
!Subjects taking corticosteroids at Baseline who have a loss of satisfactory clinical response per 
the Investigator's judgment after the steroid taper has been initiated may have their corticosteroid dose increased per the Investigator's discretion during the study.  Subjects in whom the maximum equivalent steroid dose exceeds the dose used at Baseline will be censored for efficacy assessments (i.e., they will be considered non-responders for categorical endpoints 
and will have the last non-missing values carried forward for non-categorical assessments) from 
that point forward.  These subjects will continue to be evaluated in the safety population.
!Immunosuppressant doses may be decreased or terminated in the event of moderate-to-severe treatment-related toxicities.

Investigational Products: Adalimumab (40 mg/0.8 mL)
Double-Blind Induction Subjects will be randomized to receive one of 2 double-blind 
adalimumab Induction Study regimens.
Doses: (Higher Induction Regimen)
160 mg at Baseline, Weeks 1, 2, and 3, and 40 mg at Week 4, continuing 
at 40 mg every other week through Week 12.
(Standard Induction Regimen)160 mg at Baseline and matching placebo at Week 1, 80 mg at Week 2 
and matching placebo at Week 3 and 40 mg every other week beginning at Week 4 through Week 12.
Double-Blind Maintenance Subjects will receive one of two double-blind adalimumab Maintenance Study regimens.
Doses:
NOTE:   In order to retain 
blinding across regimens, all 
subjects who do not meet the criteria for dose escalation in either maintenance regimen will receive matching placebo injections in addition to the adalimumab injection.Clinically Adjusted (CA) Regimen:
Subjects randomized to the clinically adjusted regimen will receive 40 mg adalimumab every other week beginning at Week 12.  The adalimumab dose will be escalated to every week starting at Week 14 if CDAI is ≥ 220 or hs-CRP ≥ 10 mg/L (using results from the prior or 
current visit) as shown by [CONTACT_396051].  These subjects will also be allowed to escalate at unscheduled visits that may occur only on Weeks 16, 18, 22, 24, 30, 32, 36, 38, 44, 46, 50, 52 and 54.  Once subjects in the clinically adjusted regimen are escalated, they will remain on 40 mg ew dosing.
Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) Regimen:
At Weeks 14, 28 and 42, the adalimumab dose for subjects randomized 
to the TDM regimen will be determined by [CONTACT_396051].  Doses will be determined using blinded serum concentrations at the prior visit (Weeks 12, 26 and 40, respectively) as well as the CDAI or hs-CRP values from the current or prior visit.  For subjects who meet criteria for dose escalation at Weeks 14, 28 or 42, subjects will receive 40 mg weekly.

Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
All endpoints for the Exploratory Maintenance Study will be non-ranked.
Pharmacokinetic:
Blood samples will be collected for measurement of serum adalimumab concentration just prior to dosing 
at Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 8, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56/Premature Discontinuation and anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) just prior to dosing at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, Week 26, Week 40, and Week 56PD.

Safety:
Safety analyses will be performed on all subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug.  Incidence 
of adverse events, changes in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The co-primary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are proportion of subjects with moderately to 
severely active CD that have achieved clinical remission, defined as CDAI < 150, at Week [ADDRESS_498308] achieved a decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline (or for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline), at Week 12. The co mparison between treatment groups for the two co-primary efficacy variables will be 
performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by [CONTACT_244105]-CRP at Baseline (< 10 and ≥ 10 mg/L) (the Screening hs-CRP will serve as the Baseline value), prior infliximab use, and 
Crohn's disease severity (CDAI ≤ 300, > 300) at Baseline.  A CMH based two-sided 95% confidence 
interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calculated.  The ITT set includes all subjects who were randomized at baseline.  For the evaluation of co-primary endpoints, missing data of CDAI at Week 4 or missing SES-CD at Week 12 will be imputed using the non-responder imputation (NRI) 
approach.  For Week 4 clinical remission, LOCF, OC and multiple imputation methods will be used as sensitivity analyses.  For Week 12 endoscopic res ponse (decrease in SES-CD > 50% from Baseline [or 
for a Baseline SES-CD of 4, at least a 2 point reduction from Baseline]), OC will be used as sensitivity analysis.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Efficacy (Continued):
Secondary efficacy variables for the Induction Study are divided into two groups.  The first group 
includes ranked secondary endpoints, which are ranked by [CONTACT_396052].  Statistical significance is assessed at significance level of 0.050 (2-sided) in ranked endpoint order until the significance level exceeds 0.05.  No additional statistically significant treatment differences may be declared after the first ranked endpoint fails to achieve statistical significance at a two-sided significance level of 0.05.  The second group includes all other secondary variables.
In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables, including all efficacy variables for Maintenance 
Study, will be analyzed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model including factor for treatment group, stratification factors and Baseline values, whereas CMH test stratified by [CONTACT_396053].  NRI for missing data will be used for categorical endpoints.  Both last observation carried forward (LOCF) and observed case (OC) analyses will be performed for continuous endpoints.  The LOCF analysis is considered primary for inferential purposes.  In addition, Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) will be applied, wherever appropriate, as a sensitivity analysis for the longitudinal continuous endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic:
Adalimumab trough serum concentrations will be summarized by [CONTACT_396054].  In addition, pharmacokinetic model based analyses will be performed with the focus on apparent clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of adalimumab.
Immunogenicity:AAA will be evaluated for each subject and each regimen, and rates of AAA positive will be calculated.  
As appropriate, the effect of AAA on adalimumab pharmacokinetics, efficacy variable(s), and treatment emergent adverse events may be evaluated.
Safety:
Adverse events (AEs), laboratory data and vital signs are the primary safety parameters in this study.  All 
safety comparisons will be performed between treatment groups using the safety set.  Treatment-emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dose of the study drug and within [ADDRESS_498310] is a study completer and is enrolled in the OLE.  Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized separately for:  a) Baseline to Week 12; b) Week 12 to Week 56; c) Baseline to Week 56 (overall study duration).  An overview of 
treatment-emergent AEs, including AEs of special interest, adverse events leading to death and adverse events leading to premature discontinuation (see details in the SAP), AEs by [CONTACT_240105] (MedDRA version 20.1 or later) preferred term and system organ class, AEs by [CONTACT_396055], and AEs by [CONTACT_396056].  
Changes in laboratory data will be described using statistical characteristics and compared 
between-treatment groups will be performed using a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).  In 
addition, shift tables and listings will be provided for abnormal values, whereby [CONTACT_396057].  Vital signs will be analyzed similarly.

Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS-[ADDRESS_587153] 95% or greater chance of observing adverse events that occur at a true incident rate of 
3.0% or higher. Therefore, with 100 subjects completing 52 weeks  of treatment, 
if an adverse event of a specific type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the true 
incidence rate of the adverse event is less than 3.0%.  
Primary Safety Analyses: 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. An AE is treatment 
emergent if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of trial treatment.  
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), 
serious TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided. 
Furthermore, frequencies will be given of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], by 
[CONTACT_6657], by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximal 
severity, by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and strongest relationship, and by [CONTACT_29974], preferred term, maximal severity, and strongest relationship. Separate 
summaries will be performed for ocular and non-ocular AEs.  
Secondary Safety Analyses: 
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, dilated fundoscopy, 
and intraocular pressure will be summarized by [CONTACT_16750].  
Assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately. 
Changes or shifts from baseline (as defined in clinical trial CYS-004) will also be 
summarized where appropriate.  
Exploratory Analyses:  
Quantitative prespecified efficacy variables will be summarized descriptively (n, mean, 
standard deviation, median, min, and max) and analyzed at each measured visit and with 
change from baseline (as defined in clinical trial CYS-004). Assessments performed by [CONTACT_72067], 
study eye and fellow eye will be summarized separately 
Dichotomous secondary efficacy variables will be summarized descriptively (frequency and 
percentage).

2.1 Dry Eye Disease (DED) 
Dry Eye Disease (DED) is defined by [CONTACT_72068] (DEWS) as a 
multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film, 
and accompanied by [CONTACT_72069], in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular 
surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles ( Craig et 
al. 2017 ). Symptoms of DED such as feeling of dryness, burning, a sandy/gritty sensation, foreign 
body sensation, pain or itchiness are quite debilitating. In addition, visual function related 
symptoms such as fluctuating vision with blinking, blurred vision, and difficulty with reading 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_459718]. In 
consequence, DED negatively impacts quality of life comparably to other severe diseases 
(Schiffman et al. 2003 ), and adverse effects on mental health, such as depression and anxiety, have 
been observed  (Le et al. 2012 ).  DED is a serious disorder that, if left untreated or undertreated, 
progressively damages the ocular surface and may lead to vision loss due to corneal complications 
(Lemp et al. 1995 ). 
As many as 5 - 35% of subjects visiting ophthalmic clinics report dry eye symptoms, making it 
one of the most common conditions seen by [CONTACT_72070] ( McCarty et al. 1998; Lin et 
al. 2003 ). Estimates of the prevalence of dry eye vary considerably, depending on the criteria used 
to define the disease, but in the [LOCATION_002] (US), it has been estimated that as many as 3.[ADDRESS_587164] DED, with a projected 40% increase 
in the number of patients affected by 2030 ( Schaumberg et al. 2002; Schaumberg et al. 2003; 
Schaumberg et al. 2009 ) With the aging population in the US and other countries of the developed 
world, and with increasing use of visual displays / computers, DED is expected to continue to 
become more prevalent and finding a treatment is becoming more important ( Benitez-del-Castillo 
et al. 2017 ).  
 
2.[ADDRESS_587165] Rational 
Cyclosporine A (CsA), a potent and selective immunosuppressive drug, acts as a regulator of T-
cells via inhibition of calcineurin. Due to this mode of action it has been widely studied as topi[INVESTIGATOR_459719] T-cell mediated diseases of the ocular surface such as DED. In the US, CsA eye 
drops formulated as an emulsion have been approved and marketed as Restasis 0.05%  for this 
indication since 2002. In Europe - Ikervis TM , a 0.1% CsA emulsion formulation, received a 
marketing authorization by [CONTACT_459733] 
2015. A second CsA containing product, Cequa TM , a nano-emulsion was approved in the US in 
2018. 
CyclASol, in contrast, is a clear ophthalmic solution of CsA developed with the goal of avoiding 
the use of oils, surfactants and preservatives. Potential benefits from this CyclASol formulation 
include improved tolerability and efficacy, early onset of efficacy and decreased visual 
disturbances associated with oily eye drops, emulsions or ointments. Moreover, the multiple dose 
containers allow for a convenient handling. 
CyclASol ® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS-005  Version 3.0 10 th December 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 14 of 67 For the solubilization of CsA in CyclASol the semifluorinated alkane (SFA)  
 F4H5  
 is used as the vehicle.  
 F4H5 is colourless, has a high 
vapor pressure, and is immiscible with water while having nearly the same refractory index. 
F4H5’s physical properties make it an optimal vehicle for topi[INVESTIGATOR_459720]. As a result of it s high 
vapor pressure ( Krafft et al. 2009 ), F4H5 dissipates quickly from the ocular surface and 
consequently does not interact physically with the tear film, as shown in rabbits, where F4H5 had 
no effect on tear film break-up time (TFBUT) (Agarwal et al. 2019) . Due to the low surface tension 
of F4H5, CyclASol eye drops are of small size,  
potentially reducing pre-corneal clearance. Importantly, the low surface tension of the CyclASol 
formulation facilitates dissemination of the applied eye drop on the conjunctiva. The dissemination 
and spreading properties are further thought to improve the local bioavailability. 
 
2.3 Trial Rational 
After successful preclinical testing and early clinical testing, a Phase 2b/3 clinical trial (CYS-003, 
ESSENCE) confirmed the effects and good tolerability seen in the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinica l 
trials.  
CyclASol 0.1% met the primary endpoint showing superiority compared to vehicle in change from 
baseline in total corneal fluorescein staining (tCFS) at Day 29 with high statistical significance 
(p=0.0002). Additionally, the CyclASol 0.1% group consistently showed statistically significant 
improvements over time in total and central corneal and conjunctival staining compared to vehicle. 
The therapeutic effects observed had an early onset after 14 days of treatment that continued over 
the 84-day treatment period. CyclASol 0.1% also showed trends of more improvement in the 
second primary endpoint of change from baseline in total Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI ©) 
at Day 29. Additionally, statistically significant and greater improvements in dryness-related 
symptoms as measured by [CONTACT_8298] (Dryness Score) at Day 29 were demonstrated in the CyclASol 
0.1% treatment group compared to the vehicle group. 
CyclASol 0.1% was safe and comfortable, and showed an excellent tolerability in all clinical tria ls 
conducted to date with instillation site reactions as low as 2.5% and a very low drop-out rate due 
to treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) of 3 subjects in each CYS-002 in CYS-003. 
This phase 3 open label safety extension trial is designed to investigate the long-term safety and 
tolerability of CyclASol 0.1% BID dosing of subjects completing the 4-weeks treatment trial CYS-
004, .  
 
2.[ADDRESS_587166] (IMP) CyclASol 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution contains CsA 
as active ingredient and its vehicle, which consists of F4H5. CsA is a potent and selective 
immunosuppressive drug, used routinely for decades as an oral immunomodulator in various 
indications. CsA containing eye drops have been proven safe over the last 15 years. The excipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]

this visit under staff supervision for instruction purposes. 
Visits 2-6
Subjects will return to the clinic on week 4 ± 2 days (Visit 2), week 12 ± 7 days (Visit 3), week 26
± 7 days (Visit 4), week 40 ± 7 days (Visit 5) and week 52 ± 7 days (Visit 6) to investigate ocular 
and non-ocular safety and tolerability of IMP and assess signs and symptoms of dry eye disease. 
At those visits all used and unused trial medication should be returned to the clinic. 
The dosing diary will be collected 
during each visit and checked for compliance. Subjects will be discharged from the trial after a ll 
Visit [ADDRESS_587170] ’s well-being with non-leading AE questioning, BID 
dosing, issues with IMP and any changes in medical history or concomitant treatments. 
Early Termination (ET)
Subjects who terminate early during the treatment period will be asked to complete all assessments 
as indicated at Visit 6 on the schedule of assessments prior to commencement of any alternative 
dry eye therapy (if considered possible). Dosing diary and trial medication will be collected. 
Subjects who are terminated early from the trial will not be replaced. 
4.4 Trial Flow 

CyclASol ® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS-[ADDRESS_587171] will spend approximately 52 weeks in the trial. The total duration of the trial from 
“first subject in ” to “last subject out ” is expected to be approximately 16 months. 
 
4.6 Justification of Trial Design 
This trial is designed as an open-label, single-arm extension trial to clinical trial CYS-004 to 
investigate long-term safety and tolerability of 52 weeks treatment with CyclASol 0.1% BID in at 
least 100 subjects.  
 
An open-label design is deemed adequate as there are no eye-drops available acting purely a s 
placebo in DED, thus influencing the background incidence of AEs in this indication. In addition, 
the vehicle F4H5 previously used as control in clinical trials with CyclASol 0.1% is as well part 
of the CyclASol formulation. 
 
4.7 Justification for Dose 
The CyclASol 0.1% BID dosing regimen was selected for the first pi[INVESTIGATOR_459722]-003 based on 
results of CYS-002. The trial CYS-004 is designed to replicate the efficacy and safety results of 
CYS-003 with the same dosing regimen, consequently the open label extension trial CYS-005 will 
use the same dose and schedule of application.

9.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
a drug in humans, whether or not the event is considered IMP-related. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medical (investigational) product, whether or not related 
to the medical (investigational) product. 
Resolved AEs and AE that are ongoing after Visit 3 (Day 29) in the CYS-[ADDRESS_587191] and the 
investigator.  
A clinically relevant worsening of visual acuity from Visit 0 of CYS-004,  
 will be considered an AE. 
IMP includes the investigational drug under evaluation and any other medications required by [CONTACT_459739]. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, severity, 
relationship to IMP, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign or 
symptom observed by [CONTACT_459740]-leading questioning.  
AEs (both elicited and observed) will be monitored from the time of Informed Consent and 
throughout the trial. All AEs will be promptly reviewed by [CONTACT_459741]. All AEs will be documented on the appropriate source document and eCRF. 
 
9.1.1 Severity 
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE as 
determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_423].  The assessment of severity 
is made irrespective of relationship to investigational product or seriousness of the event and 
should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate :  Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may 
interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe :  Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
CyclASol ® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH 
Clinical Trial Protocol: CYS-005  Version 3.0 10 th December 2020 
 
Confidential  Page 35 of 67 Severity is not the same as “seriousness”, which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually 
associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning (see Section 9.2). Seriousness (not 
severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_587192] 
The relationship of each AE to the IMP should be determined by [CONTACT_459742]: 
• Suspected :  A reasonable possibility exists that the investigational product caused the 
AE. 
• Not Suspected : A reasonable possibility does not exist that the investigational product 
caused the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
investigational product caused the AE .  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to 
suggest a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest 
a causal relationship between the IMP and the AE include: a single occurrence of an event that is 
uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IMP exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
associated with IMP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IMP 
(e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the trial population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those 
events occur more frequently in the IMP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control 
group. 
 
9.1.[ADDRESS_587193] been listed in the Investigator’s Brochure . 
Therefore, the following definition will be used: 
• Unexpected : An AE that is not listed in the investigator’s brochure (IB) in the Adverse 
Reaction Section at the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
• Expected : An AE that is listed in the invest igator’s brochure (IB) in the Adverse 
Reaction Section at the specificity and severity that has been observed. 
• Not Applicable : Any AE that is unrelated to the IMP. 
The Investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE, but the final classification is 
subject to the sponsor’s  determination. 
 
9.1.4 Outcome 
The outcome of any AE will be determined and recorded using the following categories: 
• Recovered/Resolved 
• Recovering/Resolving 
CyclASol ® 0.1% Ophthalmic Solution  Novaliq GmbH

• Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae 
• Lost to Follow-up 
• Fatal 
• Unknown 
 
9.1.5 Period of Observation 
For the purpose of this study, the period of observation for collection of adverse events extends 
from the time the patient gives informed consent until the end of the Visit 6 at (Week 52 ± 1) or 
Early Termination. 
If the investigator detects a Serious Adverse Event (Section 9.2) in a study patient after the end of 
the period of observation this should be reported to the Sponsor only if the investigator considers 
the event related to prior study treatment or procedures. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_459743]. 
 
9.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening AE; 
o Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject or subject at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
o Note: The term “ inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission 
(even if less than 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient 
admission includes transfer within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care 
inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80676]: emergency room 
visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; observation/short stay 
units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or clinical 
research/phase 1 units. 
o Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any 
extension of an inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_459725]. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
o Note: A serious adverse event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would 
be interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes (e.g., 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer or damage to the optic

10.1 Analysis Populations 
The following analysis population will be considered: 
• Safety Set (SAF) – The SAF includes all enrolled subjects who received at least one 
dose of the IMP. The SAF will be analyzed for all assessments.   
The statistical analysis of baseline, primary and secondary endpoint data will be performed for the 
SAF.  
10.[ADDRESS_587198] 100 evaluable participants 
complete  
the 52 weeks (12-month) treatment period.  
With [ADDRESS_587199] 
95% or greater chance of observing adverse events that occur at a true incident rate of 3.0 % or 
higher.  Therefore, with 100 subjects completing 52 weeks  of treatment, if an adverse 
event of a specific type is not observed, then with 95% confidence, the true incidence rate of the 
adverse event is less than 3.0%.  
10.4 Statistical Analysis 
10.4.1  General Considerations 
Quantitative variables will be summarized using number of subjects (n), mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum. The dichotomous variables will be summarized using counts 
and percentages.  
Summaries will be provided for demographics, baseline medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
subject disposition. 
For the purpose of summarization, medical history, concurrent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and AEs will be coded 
to MedDRA and WHO Drug dictionaries, as appropriate. 
Baseline measures are defined as the measure prior to the administration of IMP as defined in 
clinical trial CYS-004. CFB will be calculated as Visit CYS-005 – Baseline CYS-004.  
Summaries will be presented separately for subjects treated with CyclASol in CYS-004 and 
subjects treated with vehicle in CYS-004 as well as overall.

Confidential  Page 41 of 67 10.4.2  Unit of Analysis 
For efficacy endpoints, the unit of analysis will be the “ study eye” which was determined during 
CYS-004. This information is transferred to the CYS-[ADDRESS_587200] from the Safety Set (SAF).  
 
 
10.4.[ADDRESS_587201] will be listed. 
Discontinuation of treatment will be summarized by [CONTACT_82153]. The primary reason for 
trial drug discontinuation will also be summarized by [CONTACT_82153]. 
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary. An AE is treatment emergent 
if it occurs or worsens after the first dose of trial treatment in clinical trial CYS-005. 
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious 
TEAEs, and TEAEs causing premature discontinuation will be provided. Furthermore, frequencies 
will be given of subjects with TEAEs by [CONTACT_9313], by [CONTACT_72065], by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximal severity, by [CONTACT_9313], preferred 
term and strongest relationship, and by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, maximal severity, and 
strongest relationship. Separate summaries will be performed for ocular and non-ocular AEs. 
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most recent version of WHO-Drug Dictionary 
and summarized by [CONTACT_1570]. 
 
10.4.5  Secondary Safety Analyses 
Other safety endpoints including visual acuity, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, intraocular pressure (IOP) 
and dilated fundoscopy will be summarized by [CONTACT_16750]. Changes or shifts 
from baseline (as defined in clinical trial CYS-004) will also be summarized where appropriate.

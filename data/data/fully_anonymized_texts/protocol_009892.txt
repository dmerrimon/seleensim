 Protocol Synopsis 
 
Summary of planned clinical study  
Protocol Number 
(study identifier)  LAL-CL03  
Title An Open Label, Multicenter, Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of 
SBC-102 in Children with Growth Failure Due to Lysosomal Acid Lipase 
Deficiency  
Study design features  This is an open -label, repeat -dose, dose escalation study of SBC -102 
([LOCATION_003]N: sebelipase alfa) in children with g rowth failure due to LAL 
Deficiency. Eligible subjects will receive once -weekly (qw) infusions of 
sebelipase alfa for up to [ADDRESS_15448] 24 weeks may be considered 
to tra nsition to an every other week dosing schedule. All subjects will initiate 
treatment at a dose of 0.35 mg/kg- qw. Dose escalation to 1  mg/kg qw will 
occur in all subjects, contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability, and 
a further dose escalation to  3 mg/kg qw may be permitted in subjects who 
meet defined criteria . All subjects will be evaluated for safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy. Where feasible, given blood volume thresholds based on subject 
weight, blood samples will also be collected for analy ses of the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of sebelipase alfa and 
for an exploratory analysis of potential disease -related biomarkers in this 
patient population.  
Background (rationale)  Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lipid 
storage disorder that is caused by a marked decrease or almost complete 
absence of LAL, leading to the accumulation of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], predominately 
cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, in  various tissues and cell types. In the 
liver, accumulation of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_16174], liver dysfunction, and 
hepatic failure. In the small intestine, lipid -laden macrophage accumulation 
in the lamina propria leads to profound malabsorption.  
LAL Def iciency presenting in infancy is an extremely rare form of LAL 
Deficiency that is usually fatal within the first 6 months of life ( Assmann, 
2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease ). It is 
characterized by [CONTACT_16224], growth  failure, and hepatic failure. 
There is currently no safe or effective therapy for the treatment of LAL 
Deficiency.  
Main objective(s)  The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of sebelipase alfa 
therapy on survival at 12 months of age in children with growth failure due to 
LAL Deficiency.  
The secondary objectives  are (1) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
sebelipase alfa in children with growth failure due to LAL Deficiency; (2) to 
evaluate the effect of sebelipase alfa therapy on survival beyond 12 months 
of age in children with growth failure due to LAL Deficiency; (3) to evaluate 
the effects of sebelipase alfa on growth parameters in children with growth 
failure due to LAL Deficiency; (4) to evaluate the effects of sebelipase alfa 
on hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and liver function in children with growth 
failure due to LAL  Deficiency; (5) to determine the effects of sebelipase alfa 
on hematological parameters in children with growth failure due to LAL 
Deficiency; and (6) to characterize the PK of sebelipase alfa delivered by 
[CONTACT_16225]-CL03 Protocol Amendment 1 2.0  05 January 2016

 intravenous (IV) infusion.  
The exploratory objectives are (1) to determine the effects of sebelipase alfa  
on lipid parameters in children with growth failure due to LAL Deficiency;  (2) 
to assess the effects of sebelipase alfa on achievement of developmental 
milestones in children with g rowth failure due to LAL Deficiency; (3) t o 
assess the effects of sebelipase alfa  on the ability of children with LAL 
Deficiency to tolerate an unrestricted diet ; and (4) to evaluate potential 
disease -related biomarkers.  
Study population and 
subset definition  The study population is children with growth failure due to LAL Deficiency.

participants (e.g. age, 
sex, severity)  Approximately [ADDRESS_15449] meet all of the following criteria to be eligible to participate in 
this study : 
1. Subject’s par ent or legal guardian understands the full nature and 
purpose of the study, including possible risks and side effects, and 
provides written informed consent/permission prior to any study 
procedures being performed.  
2. Male or female child with a documented decreased LAL activity relative 
to the normal range of the lab performing the assay or documented 
result of molecular genetic testing (2 mutations) confirming a diagnosis 
of LAL Deficiency.  
3. Growth failure* with onset before 6 months of age, as defined by:  
[CONTACT_16226] [ADDRESS_15450] World Health Organization  (WHO) weight -for-age (WFA) 
chart (1st, 3rd, 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 97th, 99th); 
OR 
body weight in kg below the 10th centile on a standard WHO WFA 
chart AND  no weight gain for the 2 weeks prior to screening;  
OR 
loss of >5% of birth weight in a child who is older than 2 weeks of 
age. 
 
*NOTE regarding Inclusion Criterion # 3: In the unusual circumstance 
where a child has  a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16175], the child may be 
included in the study if the Investigator has substantial clinical concerns 
based on evidence of the rapid disease progression requ iring urgent 
medical intervention.  Inclusion under these exceptional circumstances 
requires submission of a written summary of the infant’s medical status 
for review by [CONTACT_16227] a written 
confirmation from the Sponsor after cons ultation with the Safety 
Committee  (SC).  The subject must meet all other entry criteria as 
stated.  
Main exclusion criteria  A subject who meets any of the following criteria will be ineligible to 
participate in this study:  
1. Clinically important concurrent disease or co -morbidities which, in the 
LAL-CL03 Protocol Amendment 1 2.0  05 January 2016

 opi[INVESTIGATOR_16176], would interfere with study 
participation, including, but not restricted to, congestive heart failure, 
ongoing circulatory collapse requiring in otropic support, acute or chronic 
renal failure, additional severe congenital abnormality, or other 
extenuating circumstances such as life -threatening under nutrition or 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16177].  
2. Subject is >24 months of age. (Note: Subjects >[ADDRESS_15451] infusion will not be eligible for the primary efficacy analysis.)  
3. Has received an investigational medicinal product other than 
sebelipase alfa  within [ADDRESS_15452] dose of sebelipase alfa

4. Myeloa blative preparation, or other systemic pre -transplant conditioning, 
for hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplantation.  
5. Previous hematopoietic stem cell or liver transplant.  
6. Known hypersensitivity to eggs.  
Randomization 
strategy  This study is open label  and is not randomized.  
Location (e.g. regions)  Multi -center  (approximately 10 primary study centers globally).   
Subjects who are medically stable, as determined by [CONTACT_737], may 
transfer to a local medical center for long -term treatment, conting ent upon 
the local medical center being appropriately qualified and securing the 
required regulatory and Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) approvals.  Scheduled study assessments may also be 
performed at a local medical c enter with access to the appropriate facilities 
and expertise.  
Study duration for 
participants  The duration of each subject’s treatment in the study is expected to be at 
least 18 months, and subjects may continue to receive treatment in the study 
for up t o 5 years.   
Dosage, treatment 
regimen, route of 
administration and 
dose escalation 
strategy  Sebelipase alfa , a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (rhLAL) 
produced in transgenic Gallus , will be administered by [CONTACT_16228].   
All subjects will initiate treatment with sebelipase alfa  at a dose 0.35 mg/kg 
qw. After receiving [ADDRESS_15453] will receive a 
dose increase to 1 mg/kg qw, contingent upon acceptable safety and 
tolerability of preceding infu sions. A further dose escalation to 3  mg/kg qw 
may be considered for a subject who has received at least 4 infusions at a 
dose of 1  mg/kg qw and meets dose escalation criteria, as defined below, 
contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability of precedi ng infusions.  
An independent Safety Committee will oversee safety in this study. The SC 
will review available safety data for each subject (1) following the first 
2 infusions at a dose of 0.35 mg/kg qw to determine the acceptability of 
escalating the dose to 1 mg/kg qw and (2) following the first 2  infusions at a 
dose of 1  mg/kg qw to determine the acceptability of continuing treatment at 
this dose level. In addition, for subjects who exhibit either an early or late 
suboptimal clinical response at a dose of  1 mg/kg qw and are escalated to a 
dose of 3  mg/kg qw, the SC will review their safety data following the first 
2 infusions at a dose of 3  mg/kg qw to determine the acceptability of 
continuing treatment at this dose level. The remainder of the safety data for 
all subjects will be reviewed during at least semi -annual periodic meetings of 
the SC and on an ad -hoc basis as needed in the event of unanticipated 
safety findings.  
If the SC does not approve a subject’s dose escalation from 0.35 mg/kg qw

 to 1 mg/kg q w, but deems it safe for the subject to continue treatment at the 
starting dose of 0.35 mg/kg qw, the subject may continue to receive this 
starting dose.  Re -evaluation of dose escalation will be considered after 
subsequent SC review and discussion with Sp onsor.  
Subjects who do not tolerate a dose of 3  mg/kg qw or 1  mg/kg qw may 
receive a dose reduction to 1 mg/kg qw or 0.35 mg/kg qw, respectively, at 
the discretion of the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor and, where 
appropriate, the SC. I f a su bject cannot tolerate a dose of 0.35  mg/kg qw, 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_16178] -associated reactions 
(IARs), the subject will be discontinued from the study.  
Subjects who are on treatment for at least [ADDRESS_15454] meets dose escalation criteria while on the every 
other week dosing schedule they will either revert bac k to weekly dosing or if 
on 1 mg/kg qow can increase to 3 mg/kg qow dosing.  
Dose Escalation Criteria  
During the first [ADDRESS_15455] may be considered to meet 
dose escalation criteria if he/she meets [ADDRESS_15456] 4 infusions at a dose of 1 mg /kg qw:  
 Failure to gain an average of 5 g /kg body weight per day AND the 
presence of either of the following:  
o weight -for-length (WFL) or weight -for-height (WFH) z -score 
<-2 based on WHO child growth standards; a nd/or  
o length -for-age (LFA) or height -for-age (HFA) z -score < -2 based 
on WHO child growth standards.  
 Albumin <3.5 g /dL; 
 Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >2x upper limit of normal (ULN);  
 Ongoing  requirement for blood and/or platelet transfusion.  
 
A subject may  also be considered for dose escalation after at least 3 months 
of treatment if they meet the below criteria:  
 Any other clinically important manifestation of LAL Deficiency on either 
clinical  examination , laboratory assessment, or imaging which has either  
o not improved from baseline  
o improved and plateaued but has not normalized  
(Note:  The definition of a plateauing of effect requires 
consideration of a minimal of 3 assessments.)  
o failed to normalize within 12 months of initiation of treatment  
o  
Manifestations include but are not restricted to the following: A decrease in 
weight for age defined as crossing >[ADDRESS_15457] weight 
for age curves, serum transaminases, albumin <3.5 g /dL, hepatomegaly, 
splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy . 
If the subject continues to meet the above defined dose escalation criteria 
after at least 4 infusions at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw, the Investigator may 
request of the Sponsor (in consultation with the SC) to increase the dose up 
to a maximum of 5 mg/kg qw . Requests will be reviewed  on a case -by-case 
basis.

 Controls  There is no placebo or comparator in this study.  
Rescue treatment  No approved therapy has been shown to be effective for the treatment of 
LAL Deficiency.  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantati on has been used 
experimentally but has a high morbidity and mortality in this patient 
population.  
Criteria for evaluation  Efficacy  
The primary efficacy  endpoint will be the proportion of subjects surviving to 
12 months of age.  Secondary survival endpoints will include proportion of 
subjects surviving to 18 and 24  months of age, and other timepoints, as data 
permit, and estimated median age at death.  Su rvival rates and median age 
at death derived from this study will be compared to rates/times reported in 
the literature and information  derived from a natural history study in a similar 
patient population (study LAL -1-NH01).  
Other secondary efficacy endpoints will include (1) changes from baseline in 
percentiles and/or z -scores for WFA, WFL/WFH, and LFA/HFA and the 
corresponding growth status indicators of underweight, wasting, and 
stunting, as well as changes from baseline in  z-scores for head 
circumference -for-age (HCFA) and mid -upper arm circumference -for-age 
(MUACFA); (2) changes from baseline in aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) 
and ALT; (3) normalization of hemoglobin levels without requirement for 
blood transfusion; and ( 4) change from baseline in serum ferritin.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints will include changes and/or percent changes 
from baseline (or first available measurement if baseline data are 
unavailable) in (1) alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase (GG T), 
albumin, and direct (conjugated), indirect (unconjugated), and total bilirubin 
levels; (2) liver and spleen size/volume, as measured by [CONTACT_16229] (MRI); (3) hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly 
(abdominal girth, liver size, a nd spleen size) by [CONTACT_5292];  
(4) platelet levels; and (5) serum lipid levels (total cholesterol, triglycerides, 
high density lipoprotein [HDL], low density lipoprotein [LDL]). Dietary 
changes, including discontinuation of a low -fat/low -choleste rol diet and/or 
introduction of an unrestricted age -appropriate diet, will be evaluated on an 
exploratory basis. Development will also be assessed using  Denver II 
developmental screening test .   
The impact of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) on efficacy endpoin ts will also be 
explored . 
Safety  
Safety endpoints will include the incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious 
adverse events (SAEs), and IARs; changes from baseline clinical laboratory 
tests; changes in vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and 
temperature) during and post -infusion relative to pre -infusion values;  
physical examination findings; use of concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
and Characterization of ADAs, including ADA positivity rate, time to ADA 
positivity, median and peak A DA titer and time to peak ADA titer . The impact 
of ADAs on safety endpoints will also be explored. Further characterization 
of ADAs, including inhibitory and/or neutralizing ADAs and measurement of 
specific ADA subtypes (e.g., IgE), may be performed, if ap propriate.  
Pharmacokinetics  
PK endpoints will include maximum observed serum concentration (C max)

ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:  
DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION  
 and apparent serum clearance  (CL), as data permit.  The impact of ADAs on 
sebelipase alfa PK will also be explored.  
Pharmacodynamics  
Exploratory disease -related  biomarkers, which may be identified based on  
emerging information from the sebelipase alfa development program and 
scientific literature, will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_16230].  
Sample size  Approximately 8 subjects who meet the requirements for inclusion in the 
Primary Efficacy Analysis Set (see definition below) will be enrolled in this 
study.  If [ADDRESS_15458] 95% c onfidence 
interval (CI) for 12 -month survival would be (34.91%, 96.81%), with the lower 
limit exceeding the upper limit of the CI for a similar population of untreated 
patients in the natural history study LAL -1-NH01.  In study LAL -1-NH01, of 
the [ADDRESS_15459] 12 months of age (95% CI for 12 -month 
survival  = (0.14%, 27.29%)).  
Statistical plan 
(including study 
conduct and analysis)  Analysis Sets  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will include all subjects who received any 
amount of investigational medicinal product (IMP).  
The Primary Efficacy Analysis  Set will include subjects in the FAS who were 
no older than [ADDRESS_15460] one complete infusion 
of IMP in this study.  
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include subjects in the Primary Efficacy 
Analysis Set who,  in addition, receive at least 4 complete infusions of 
sebelipase alfa .  This set will be used for sensitivity analyses of efficacy 
endpoints.  
General Considerations  
All data will be presented in listings, and summary tables and/or graphs will 
be provided, as appropriate.  Unless otherwise noted, tabulations for efficacy 
endpoints will be presented  for subjects in the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set 
and tabulations for o ther endpoints will be presented for subjects in the FAS. 
Descriptive summary  statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum and maximum) will be calculated for the continuous variables. Shift 
tables and/or frequencies and percentages will be pro duced for the 
categorical variables. As noted, 95%  two-sided CIs will be calculated around 
the estimates based on the exact binomial distribution for binomial endpoints 
and the t -distribution for continuous endpoints.   
Baseline will be defined as the last  measurement prior to the first infusion of 
sebelipase alfa.  (Note: For exploratory analyses, the first available 
measurement after initiation of treatment  may be used as baseline if a 
pretreatment measurement is unavailable.)  Survival rates will be base d on 
the age of the subject.  Other endpoints, unless otherwise noted, will be 
based on exposure (i.e., duration of time since the first infusion of sebelipase 
alfa).  
A clinical study report  (CSR) will be produced following analysis of the 
LAL-CL03 Protocol Amendment 1 2.0  05 January 2016 
Page 10 of 76  
 
ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:

 primary endpoin t (12 -month  survival) and will include all subject data 
available through 12 months of age or the date of death or early withdrawal.  
A final CSR will be generated  after study completion.  
 
Efficacy  
Efficacy will be analyzed  for the Primary Efficacy Analys is Set.  If the PPS is 
not identical to the Primary  Efficacy Analysis Set (i.e., if at least one patient 
in the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set is excluded from the PPS), efficacy 
analyses will be repeated for the PPS.  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the pr oportion of subjects surviving to 
[ADDRESS_15461] dose of 
IMP will be computed.  Estimated survival rates and median age at death 
derived from this study will be compared to rates/times reported in the 
literatur e, and will be discussed in conjunction with information derived from 
a natural history study in a similar patient population (study LAL -1-NH01).  
Anthropometric indicators of growth, standardized by [CONTACT_16231], will be listed by [CONTACT_16232] .  Change from baseline in anthropometric data will be 
tabulated as continuous data.  In addition, the percentages of subjects who 
meet criteria for underweight, stunting, and wasting will be tabulated for each 
timepoint.  For anthropometric indicators of growth, age will be adjusted for 
prematurity if gestational age is <[ADDRESS_15462] ment will be made such that corrected 
age equals the  chronological age minus the number of months premature.  
Change and/or percent  changes from baseline in AST, ALT, and serum 
ferritin will be tabulated for each evaluation timepoint.  The proportion of 
subjects with abnormal hemoglobin at baseline who achieve transfusion -free 
hemoglobin normalization  (TFHN)  will be summarized, as will the proportion 
of subjects who maintain transfusion -free normal hemoglobin.  
The Denver II total score and functional area sc ores will be derived from the 
questionnaire in accordance with the Technical Manual and compared to 
appropriate demographic  norms.  The total score and functional area scores 
will be summarized as continuous data and according to the classification as 
to whether the subject displays abnormal/normal development.  
Shift tables will be used to tabulate dietary changes, including 
discontinuation of low -fat/low -cholesterol diet and/or introduction of an 
unrestricted age -appropriate  diet.  Observed values and changes and/or 
percent changes from baseline in other exploratory efficacy endpoints will be 
tabulated for each evaluation timepoint.   
Safety  
Safety will be analyzed  for the FAS.  
All reported AEs will be listed from the date o f written informed consent until

 the end of participation  in this study.  Separate listings of SAEs and IARs will 
also be provided . The numbers and percentages of subjects experiencing 
any AE, any SAE, any IAR, any related AE, any related SAE, and 
discont inuations due to an AE will be tabulated.  The frequency of treatment -
emergent AEs, SAEs, and IARs by [CONTACT_9315]  (coded using 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA®] version 14 or higher) 
will be tabulated.  Frequencies will also  be presented by [CONTACT_16233].  In addition, frequency of AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be 
presented for time periods spanning the entire course of treatment with 
sebelipase alfa: from the start of dosing with sebelipase alfa in  this study to 
[ADDRESS_15463] dose, >3 to 6 months, >6 to 12 months, >12  to 18 
months, >18  to 24 months and >24 months.  As appropriate, additional 
listings, summary tables and graphics will be generated to evaluate IAR 
frequency and severity ove r time.  A listing of subjects who withdraw from 
the study due to AEs will be presented, and the incidence of AEs leading to

 1 Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to [LOCATION_002] and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) (FDA 
Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonisation [ICH] guidelines), applicable 
government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.1 Background 
1.1.1 Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency 
Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) Deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive lipid storage disorder 
that is caused by a marked decrease or almost complete absence of the lysosomal enzyme, 
LAL.  
The marked reduction or almost complete absence of LAL in patients with LAL Deficiency leads 
to the accumulation of lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], predominately cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, in various 
tissues and cell types, particularly the liver leading to hepatomegaly, liver dysfunction, and 
hepatic failure, and in the small intestinal macrophages leading to profound malabsorption. LAL 
Deficiency presenting in infancy is characterized by [CONTACT_16224], growth failure, and 
hepatic failure and is usually fatal within the 6 months of life. In children and adults with LAL 
Deficiency, liver involvement and type II hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_16180]. All 
presentations of LAL Deficiency are due to mutations in the LIPA gene located on chromosome 
10q23.2-q23.3. In LAL Deficiency presenting in children and adults, many cases are associated 
with a common mutated allele resulting in some residual enzyme activity, whereas in LAL 
Deficiency presenting in infants there are a variety of private mutations with complete loss of 
enzyme function ( Assmann, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease ). It 
has been hypothesized that there may be a correlation between enzyme activity and the 
severity of the disease.  
1.1.2 LAL Deficiency Presenting in Infancy 
LAL Deficiency presenting in infants, historically called Wolman disease or LAL 
Deficiency/Wolman phenotype is a very rare form of LAL Deficiency that is usually fatal within 
the first 6 months of life ( Assmann, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited 
Disease ). This form of the disease, named after the physician who first described it ( Abramov, 
1956, AMA J Dis Child ), is the most rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16181], as evidenced by [CONTACT_16237], elevation of 
transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy and hypoalbuminemia, as the predominant 
clinical features and key contributors to the early mortality ( Anderson, 1999, Mol Genet Metab ; 
Mayatepek, 1999, J Inherit Metab Dis ).  Fibrosis and cirrhosis develop rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16182] 6 months of life ( Marshall, 1969, Arch Dis Child ; 
Konno, 1966, Tohoku J Exp Med; Crocker, 1965, Pediatrics ). 
Diagnosis of LAL Deficiency is established through both physical findings and laboratory 
analyses.  Infants are typi[INVESTIGATOR_16183] 2 months of life due to diarrhea, 
persistent vomiting, feeding difficulty and growth failure ( Wolman, 1995, Clin Pediatr ).  Physical

 findings include abdominal distention with hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.  Radiographic 
examination often reveals calcification of the adrenal glands.  Laboratory evaluations typi[INVESTIGATOR_16184] ( Assmann, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease ; Mayatepek, 
1999, J Inherited Metab Dis ; Surve, 2005, Indian J Pediatr ).  
At present, there are no safe or effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16185].  A variety of supportive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_16186].  Antibiotics may be prescribed to address pyrexia or 
documented infections.  In an attempt to mitigate the complications due to lipid accumulation 
within the target cells and vital organs, dietary restriction of either breast milk or formulas 
containing triglycerides and cholesteryl esters and the use of a fatty ester free diet is 
recommended ( Wolman, 1995, Clin Pediatr ).  Although some stabilization of the clinical 
condition has been described with nutritional support, these interventions do not substantially 
modify the outcome in affected patients (LAL-1-NH01;  Hoeg, 1984, Am J Hum Genet; Meyers, 
1985, Nutr Res ).   
Outcomes with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in affected infants have recently been 
reviewed in the literature, and while there are reports that [ADDRESS_15471] survived 
beyond 3 years, the majority of transplant attempts resulted in early death due to liver failure 
from progressive disease, or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (veno-occlusive disease) or other 
transplant-related complications ( Gramatges, 2009, Bone Marrow Transplant ; Krivit 1992, Bone 
Marrow Transplant ; Krivit, 2000, Bone Marrow Transplant; Tolar, 2009, Bone Marrow 
Transplant ; Yanir, 2013, Mol Gen Metab ).  The toxicity of conditioning regimens and time 
required for engraftment create substantial risks in the setting of such a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16187]. 
1.1.3 Medical Plausibility of Enzyme Replacement Therapy for LAL Deficiency 
LAL Deficiency resembles other lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) with the accumulation of 
substrate in a number of tissues and cell types.  The successful treatment of Gaucher disease 
with placental glucocerebrosidase in the 1990s and, with the follow- on enzyme produced by 
[CONTACT_16238] ( DNA ) technology, established the medical value and 
long-term safety of enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT) for LSDs ( Barton, 1990, Proc Natl Acad 
Sci; Barton, 1991, N Engl J Med ).  The scientific concepts established by [CONTACT_16239] a broader range of disorders, including Pompe disease ( Kishnani, 
2007, Neurology; van der Ploeg, 2010, N Engl J Med ), Fabry disease ( Wilcox, 2004, Am J Hum 
Genet ), Mucopolysaccharidosis I ( Wraith, 2004, J Pediatr ), and Mucopolysaccharidosis II 
(Muenzer, 2007, Mol Genet Metab ) and there is now extensive clinical experience of long-term 
ERT in patients with LSDs. 
In LAL Deficiency, substrate accumulation is most marked in cells of the reticuloendothelial 
system, including Kupffer cells in the liver, histiocytes in the spleen and macrophages in the 
lamina propria of the small intestine.  Reticuloendothelial cells express the macrophage 
mannose/N-acetylglucosamine receptor (also known as macrophage mannose receptor or 
LAL-CL03 Protocol Amendment 1 2.0  05 January 2016

 MMR, CD206), which mediates binding, cell uptake and lysosomal internalization of proteins 
with N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) or mannose terminated N-glycans, and provides a pathway 
for the potential correction of the enzyme deficiency in these key cell types ( Stahl, 1978, Proc 
Natl Acad Sci ).  This knowledge and the precedent established for other LSDs provides 
plausibility that ERT with sebelipase alfa, which has the appropriate glycan characteristics for 
targeting macrophages and other key cells, will benefit patients with LAL Deficiency. 
Biological activity of sebelipase alfa in patients with LAL Deficiency has been demonstrated in 
clinical study LAL-CL01 and LAL-CL04, including decreases in transaminases and evidence of 
early lipid mobilization and correction of dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_16188], This information 
and the encouraging initial response to sebelipase alfa in LAL-CL03, including improvements in 
weight gain, decrease in hepatic and splenic size, resolution of vomiting and diarrhea, and 
improvement in biochemical markers, provides the first human evidence in support of the 
potential for ERT for this disease). 
1.2 Investigational Agent 
Sebelipase alfa  is a recombinant human lysosomal acid lipase (rhLAL) with the same amino 
acid sequence as the native enzyme. Sebelipase alfa is a highly purified recombinant form of 
the naturally occurring human lysosomal acid lipase enzyme responsible for the metabolism and 
degradation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides that are delivered to lysosomes by a variety 
of routes including low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor mediated endocytosis.  Sebelipase 
alfa is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of approximately 55 kD with 5 N-linked 
glycosylation sites.  
Sebelipase alfa is produced by [CONTACT_16240] a transgenic 
Gallus  expression system and contains predominantly GlcNAc and mannose terminated N-
linked glycan structures, some of which contain mannose-6-phosphate (M6P).  GlcNAc and 
mannose terminated glycans are specifically recognized and internalized via the MMR present 
on the surface of macrophages.  These cells are one of the most important cell types that 
accumulate cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in patients with LAL Deficiency.  In addition, the 
presence of M6P allows delivery to cells that display the widely expressed M6P receptor.  
1.3 Preclinical Data 
In in vitro  studies, sebelipase alfa demonstrated uptake and localization to lysosomes, and 
produced a dose-dependent correction of LAL activity in human fibroblasts deficient in this 
enzyme.   
In homozygous LAL-deficient rats, a nonclinical disease model of LAL Deficiency, intravenous 
(IV) administration of sebelipase alfa restored enzyme activity in the liver and other key target 
tissues, and was associated with a marked reduction in substrate accumulation (cholesteryl 
esters and triglycerides) in the liver, spleen, gut, and lymph nodes relative to placebo-treated 
animals.  Homozygous LAL-deficient rats demonstrate liver and spleen abnormalities, which 
resemble the abnormalities seen in patients with LAL Deficiency including accumulation of 
cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, hepatosplenomegaly, transaminase elevation, Kupffer cell

 expansion with disruption of normal liver architecture and liver fibrosis ( Leavitt, 2011, J Hepatol ).  
In addition, the LAL-deficient rats show other abnormalities that are prominent in rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16189], including gastrointestinal  involvement with abnormal lipid 
accumulation in macrophages in the lamina propria of the small intestine, markedly impaired 
weight gain, and early mortality ( Leavitt, 2011, J Ped Gastroenterol Nutr ;  Sponsor data on file).  
Once weekly (qw) and every other week (qow) administration of sebelipase alfa by [CONTACT_16241] a 4-week period led to a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in 
weight gain and organ size compared to placebo-treated LAL-deficient rats.  Of note, the 
improvements in weight gain were statistically significant within [ADDRESS_15472] 
dose.  Liver abnormalities were all markedly improved within 4 weeks of treatment initiation.  In 
a subsequent study, sebelipase alfa was administered to LAL-deficient rats qw at a dose of 
3 mg/kg (given by [CONTACT_16242]) for 19 weeks, beginning at 8 weeks of age, to 
investigate the effectiveness of sebelipase alfa in the presence of more advanced disease and 
to determine whether restoration of growth and correction of other disease-related abnormalities 
with sebelipase alfa treatment was associated with extended survival.  In this study, sebelipase 
alfa treatment resulted in substantial improvements in the phenotypic abnormalities seen in this 
disease model.  Sebelipase alfa-treated LAL-deficient rats gained more weight than vehicle-
treated animals, and survived without exception to the scheduled sacrifice time (27 weeks of 
age); in a separate study, untreated animals did not survive beyond [ADDRESS_15473] to organomegaly, with reductions in the size of all affected organs examined, and a 
concomitant reduction in hepatic levels of LAL substrates, consistent with the expected 
mechanism of action of sebelipase alfa.  The reduction in hepatomegaly was also accompanied 
by a normalization of serum transaminases.  Histologically, the appearance of the liver in the 
sebelipase alfa -treated LAL-deficient rats resembled that of the wildtype rat.  These positive 
disease-modifying effects of sebelipase alfa were comparable to the effects observed following 
short-term (4 weeks) administration.  Additional discussions of the dose response of the effects 
seen in the nonclinical model are included in Section 1.5.1 .  
There were no meaningful toxicological findings in 4-week repeat dose toxicology studies in the 
Sprague-Dawley rat and Cynomolgus monkey administered IV infusions of sebelipase alfa at 
doses up to 50 mg/kg qw.  In a 6-month repeated dose toxicity study in juvenile Cynomolgus 
monkeys administered qw IV infusions of sebelipase alfa at doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, or 
30 mg/kg (5 males and 5 females per dose group), or placebo infusions (5 males, 5 females), 
sebelipase alfa was well tolerated up to the highest dose level of 30 mg/kg.  There were no 
sebelipase alfa related changes in any of the study parameters, although there was an apparent 
infusion reaction observed in one animal on Day 1 of dosing following administration of 
sebelipase alfa at a dose of 10 mg/kg.  With diphenhydramine pretreatment, no additional 
reactions were observed during the subsequent 25 infusions in this animal.  No infusion 
reactions were observed in a total of 754 infusions administered to the other 29 animals in this 
study.  These results support the long-term dosing with sebelipase alfa.

 Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in Sprague-Dawley rats administered IV bolus injections of 
sebelipase alfa at doses of 1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg demonstrate that sebelipase alfa is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16190].   
1.4 Clinical Data  
The clinical development program is investigating the safety and tolerability of sebelipase alfa 
and its clinically meaningful effects on the medical complications of LAL Deficiency.  LAL-CL01, 
a Phase 1/2 dose-finding study in adults with LAL Deficiency, has completed.  An extension 
study, LAL-CL04, is ongoing in subjects who completed LAL-CL01.  LAL-CL03 is an ongoing 
Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
sebelipase alfa in pediatric subjects with LAL Deficiency who developed growth failure or other 
clinical evidence of rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16191] [ADDRESS_15474] 
population of subjects ≥ [ADDRESS_15475] been eligible for other 
studies.  LAL-CL08 is a Phase 2 study in infant subjects with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16192].  Please refer to the IB for further information on the clinical experience with 
sebelipase alfa. 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
1.5.1 Dose Rationale 
In this study, sebelipase alfa will be administered at a starting dose of 0.35 mg/kg qw and all 
subjects will receive a dose increase to 1 mg/kg (contingent on safety), with an option for a 
further dose increase to 3 mg/kg qw.  These doses of sebelipase alfa were selected based on 
the following: 
 As discussed in Section 1.4 , clinical data are available from a completed study in 
patients with LAL Deficiency (LAL-CL01) administered qw infusions of sebelipase alfa at 
doses of 0.35 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg as well as 1 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg qow 
(LAL-CL04).  These data show: 
o All 3 dose levels of sebelipase alfa were well tolerated. 
o Sebelipase alfa therapy produced rapid and comparable reductions in serum 
transaminases at all 3 dose levels.   
o Increases in serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_16193] 3 dose levels within 4 weeks of 
treatment initiation, consistent with the known mechanism of action of sebelipase 
alfa.  These effects were more marked with the 3 mg/kg qw dose and may 
therefore be dose related.  Compared to a dose of 3 mg/kg qw, doses of 0.35 
and 1 mg/kg qw may have less marked short-term effects on serum lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805], but a 
potentially comparable clinical benefit.

Page 23 of 76  
 
ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:  
DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION  
 o Maintenance of clinical response (reduction in ALT and AST and improvement of 
lipid levels) was observed in adult subjects treated with qow dosing in LAL-CL04.  
   There is an adequate safety margin for sebelipase alfa based on nonclinical toxicology 
studies. Refer to the IB for further information. 
o There were no meaningful toxicological findings in 4-week repeated dose 
toxicology studies in the Sprague-Dawley rat and Cynomolgus monkey at doses 
up to 50 mg/kg.  Based on the human equivalent doses in rats (8.1 mg/kg) and 
monkeys (16.1 mg/kg), this represents an approximately 23.0- to 46.1-fold safety 
margin relative to the planned starting dose of 0.35 mg/kg in the current study. 
o Sebelipase alfa was well tolerated in a 6-month repeated dose toxicity study in 
Cynomolgus monkeys given qw IV infusions at doses up to 30 mg/kg.  Based on 
the human equivalent dose (9.7 mg/kg), this provides an approximately 27.7-fold 
safety margin relative to the planned starting dose of 0.35 mg/kg in the current 
study.  The absence of any sebelipase alfa related changes in study parameters 
supports the long-term dosing with sebelipase alfa. 
 As expected, based on the number and composition of glycan structures, PK studies in 
Sprague-Dawley rats administered IV bolus injections of sebelipase alfa at doses of 
1 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg demonstrate that sebelipase alfa is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16194].   Consistent with these findings, 
sebelipase alfa has a short plasma half-life in adult patients with late onset LAL 
Deficiency.  Clinical PK data for sebelipase alfa are not yet available for children and 
adolescents, but plasma half-life is expected to be short in these patients. 
 A dose of 0.35 mg/kg dose qw was established as the minimally effective dose in a rat 
model of LAL Deficiency.  
 In general for LSDs, the enzymatic activities and mechanisms for lysosomal targeting 
are conserved across species. Toxicological studies of this class of therapy consistently 
demonstrate low systemic toxicity (Andrews and O’Callaghan, 2008). 
 The Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) has an amino acid sequence identical to the 
Genbank reference sequence for human LAL with no engineering of enhancements in 
biological activity. 
For ERTs, plasma PK data have limited utility for dose selection and escalation, as the proteins 
have a short plasma half-life and the main biological activity is in the target tissue.  
Given the extreme rarity and immediate life-threatening nature of growth failure due to 
LAL Deficiency, this study will allow within-subject dose escalation from the initial starting dose, 
as the pre-clinical model demonstrated dose dependent pharmacological effects. The proposed 
dose increment permitted in this study will be 3-fold, which will allow assessment of safety,

rat model, it was established that the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of 3 mg/kg qw and 5 mg/kg

 greater than 3 mg/kg qw in subjects with LAL Deficiency will be required unless there is 
evidence of a loss of efficacy due to the potential development of neutralizing antibodies. 
1.5.2 Risk/Benefit Assessment  
LAL Deficiency is a very rare disease with no safe or effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  LAL Deficiency 
presenting in infants results in significant morbidity and death typi[INVESTIGATOR_16195] 6 months of age 
(Assmann, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease ). 
No significant toxicities were identified in pre-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies at 
doses equivalent to and substantially greater than the planned doses for the current study (see 
Section 1.3  for details). 
Clinical experience with sebelipase alfa in adult patients with LAL Deficiency treated in study 
LAL-CL01 and LAL-CL04 indicates that sebelipase alfa is well tolerated at doses ranging from 
0.35 mg/kg qw to 3 mg/kg qw and produces rapid improvements in serum transaminases and 
other evidence of biological activity.  Sebelipase alfa has also demonstrated an acceptable 
safety profile and positive treatment effects in infants receiving doses up to 3 mg/kg qw on an 
expanded access basis and in the current study.  See Section 1.4  and the IB for further details 
on the clinical experience with sebelipase alfa.  Thus, there is a reasonable basis to conclude 
that sebelipase alfa therapy in this study will be well tolerated and associated with beneficial 
effects on disease activity.   
In addition to clinical experience with sebelipase alfa, extensive human experience exists for 
ERTs in the treatment of other LSDs including Gaucher, Pompe, and Fabry disease. The main 
unfavorable effects associated with administration of approved ERTs (including but not limited 
to Cerezyme®, VPRIV®, Myozyme®/Lumizyme®,  Fabrazyme®) are IARs, which typi[INVESTIGATOR_16196]/or the administration of antipyretics and 
antihistamines. Severe infusion reactions including anaphylaxis, and SAEs related to ERT 
administration occur rarely and can require intensive medical intervention. Given the propensity 
for infusion reactions with ERT administration, measures have been incorporated in this protocol 
to minimize risk and monitor subject safety. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) have been reported with approved ERTs and these may be 
associated with altered response to treatment and/or increased risk of infusion reactions.   
Given the relatively low level of subject risk relative to the terminal nature of untreated LAL 
Deficiency presenting in infancy, it is concluded that the risks to subjects in this study are 
reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits and/or knowledge that can be expected from 
the results.

 [ADDRESS_15477] weight, blood 
samples will also be collected for analyses of the PK and PD of sebelipase alfa and for an 
exploratory analysis of potential disease-related biomarkers in this patient population. 
All subjects will initiate treatment with sebelipase alfa at a dose of 0.35 mg/kg qw.  After 
receiving [ADDRESS_15478] will receive a dose increase to 1 mg/kg qw, 
contingent upon acceptable safety and tolerability of preceding infusions.  A further dose 
escalation to 3 mg/kg qw may be considered for a subject who has received at least 4 infusions 
at a dose of 1 mg/kg qw, and meets the criteria for dose escalation defined in Section 3.1.[ADDRESS_15479] (1) following the first 2 infusions at a dose of 0.35 mg/kg qw to 
determine the acceptability of escalating the dose to 1 mg/kg qw and (2) following the first 
2 infusions at a dose of 1 mg/kg qw to determine the acceptability of continuing treatment at this 
dose level.  In addition, for subjects who are escalated to a dose of 3 mg/kg qw, the SC will 
review their safety data following the first 2 infusions at a dose of 3 mg/kg qw to determine the 
acceptability of continuing treatment at this dose level.  The remainder of the safety data for all 
subjects will be reviewed during at least biannual periodic meetings of the SC and on an ad-hoc 
basis as needed in the event of unanticipated safety findings. 
If the SC does not approve a subject’s dose escalation from 0.35 mg/kg qw to 1 mg/kg qw, but 
deems it safe for the subject to continue treatment at the starting dose of 0.35 mg/kg qw, the 
subject may continue to receive this starting dose.  Re-evaluation of dose escalation will be 
considered after subsequent SC review and discussion with Sponsor. 
Subjects who do not tolerate a dose of 3 mg/kg qw or 1 mg/kg qw may receive a dose reduction 
to 1 mg/kg qw or 0.35 mg/kg qw, respectively, at the discretion of the Investigator in consultation 
with the Sponsor and, where appropriate, the SC. If a subject cannot tolerate a dose of 
0.35 mg/kg qw, despi[INVESTIGATOR_16197], the subject will be discontinued 
from the study. 
Subjects who are on treatment for at least [ADDRESS_15480] meets the criteria for dose escalation 
while on the every other week dosing schedule they will either revert back to weekly dosing or if 
on 1 mg/kg qow can increase to 3 mg/kg qow dosing.

can be found in Section 7.[ADDRESS_15482] an acute illness (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_16200]) 
should have their scheduled infusions postponed by [CONTACT_8622] 2 days ([ADDRESS_15483] is on a qow 
infusion schedule) to allow for resolution.  If the illness persists for longer than 2 days ([ADDRESS_15484] is on a qow infusion schedule), the infusion schedule should reset to the next scheduled 
infusion after the subject’s recovery. The Investigator may conduct an unscheduled visit at any 
time during the study at his/her discretion.  Assessments performed at this visit should be 
symptom directed. Safety laboratory testing may be performed if the Investigator considers it 
necessary. Repeat laboratory testing may be needed based on results from the unscheduled 
laboratory testing. If the subject is discontinued from study treatment at a scheduled visit or at 
an unscheduled visit, the subject should return no earlier than [ADDRESS_15485] dose of IMP 
for an End of Study assessment.  
3.1.1  Dose Escalation  
The Investigator, in consultation with the Sponsor and Safety Committee (SC), may consider 
increasing a subject's dose to 3 mg/kg qw by [CONTACT_16243] a need for a dose increase. These considerations should 
include evaluation of other potential causes of any clinical manifestations that are thought 
negatively impact these criteria. 
.  Other causes could include: 
 missed study infusions, 
 onset of acute cholecystitis or initiation of a potentially hepatotoxic concomitant 
medication in a subject with elevated ALT,  
 concomitant illness in a subject with reduced weight gain such as an upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_16201].

If
 the subject continues to have criteria for dose escalation after at least 4 infusions at a dose of 
3 mg/kg qw, the Investigator, may request of the Sponsor (in consultation with the SC) to 
increase the dose up to a maximum of 5 mg/kg qw on a case by [CONTACT_413].  
Prior to any dose change, serum lipid, serum liver, hematology, chemistry, ferritin and hs- CRP

 3.2 Rationale for Study Design 
3.2.1 Dose Selection 
Refer to Section 1.5.1  for the dose selection rationale.  
3.2.2 Outcome Variable Selection 
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy 
The study is designed primarily to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with sebelipase alfa.  The 
primary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of subjects surviving to 12 months of age.  
Secondary survival endpoints will include proportion of subjects surviving to 18 and 24 months 
of age, and other timepoints, as data permit, and estimated median age at death. Survival rates 
and median age at death derived from this study will be compared to rates/times reported in the 
literature and information derived from a natural history study in a similar patient populations 
(study LAL-1-NH01). 
Subjects with untreated early onset LAL Deficiency typi[INVESTIGATOR_16202], in addition to being the predominant clinical feature, is also one of the main contributors 
to mortality. Improvement in growth is anticipated to be a prerequisite for any beneficial effects 
of sebelipase alfa on survival. Therefore, secondary efficacy endpoints will include changes 
from baseline in the following growth parameters: 
 Percentiles and/or z-scores, based on WHO child growth standards 
(WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006 and 2007 ), for the following 
parameters: 
 Weight-for-age (WFA); 
 WFL or WFH; 
 LFA or HFA; 
 Head circumference-for-age (HCFA); 
 Mid-upper arm circumference-for-age (MUACFA).  
 Dichotomous growth status indicators for underweight, wasting, and stunting based 
on WFA, WFL/WFH, and LFA/HFA, respectively (UNICEF, 2009). 
Note: Given the switch at age 2 years from measurement of length to measurement of height, 
growth parameters include weight related to both length and height and age related to both 
length and height. 
A successful therapy for LAL Deficiency presenting in infancy should mitigate the liver and 
hematological changes associated with the disease.  Therefore, the following laboratory 
parameters will also be included as secondary efficacy endpoints:   
 Changes from baseline in aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and ALT levels;  
LAL-CL03 Protocol Amendment 1 2.0  05 January 2016 
Page 31 of 76  
 
ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:  
DO NOT COPY OR DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION  
  Normalization of hemoglobin levels without requirement for blood transfusion; 
 Changes from baseline in serum ferritin levels. 
Additional exploratory efficacy parameters will be investigated to provide supportive evidence of 
an improvement of LAL Deficiency with sebelipase alfa treatment, and will include changes or 
percent changes from baseline (or first available assessment if baseline data are unavailable) 
in:  
 Alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), albumin, and direct 
(conjugated), indirect (unconjugated), and total bilirubin levels;  
 Liver and spleen size/volume, as measured by [CONTACT_16244] (MRI); 
 Hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly (abdominal girth, liver size, and spleen size) by 
[CONTACT_5292]; 
 Platelet levels; 
 Serum lipid levels (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein [HDL], and 
LDL). 
Because LAL Deficiency presenting in infancy is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_16203] 6 months of age ( Assmann, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited 
Disease ), information on development is limited in this patient population. The potential 
extended life expectancy in subjects receiving long-term treatment with sebelipase alfa provides 
an opportunity to improve the medical community’s understanding of the developmental process 
in infants with LAL Deficiency treated with sebelipase alfa. To this end, the study will include an 
exploratory analysis of developmental outcomes, as assessed by [CONTACT_16245].  
Dietary changes, including discontinuation of a low-fat/low-cholesterol diet and/or introduction of 
an unrestricted age-appropriate diet, will also be evaluated on an exploratory basis.   
Given the potential for ADAs to alter the PD effect of sebelipase alfa, the impact of ADAs on 
efficacy endpoints will be explored. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety 
The safety and tolerability of treatment with sebelipase alfa, administered by [CONTACT_16228], will 
also be evaluated in this study.  Endpoints for safety of sebelipase alfa in infants with LAL 
Deficiency will include: 
 Incidence of AEs, SAEs, and IARs; 
 Changes from baseline clinical laboratory tests;  
 Changes in vital signs during and post-infusion, relative to pre-infusion values;  
 Physical examination findings;

ALEXION PHARMACEUTICALS, INC. PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL:

  Use of concomitant medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]; 
 Characterization of ADAs, including ADA positivity rate, time to ADA positivity, 
median and peak ADA titer and time to peak ADA titer.   
Given the potential for ADAs to alter the safety profile of sebelipase alfa, the impact of ADAs on 
safety endpoints will be explored.  Further characterization of ADAs, including inhibitory and/or 
neutralizing ADAs  and measurement of specific ADA subtypes (e.g., IgE), may be performed, if 
appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of sebelipase alfa in infants with LAL Deficiency will be characterized in this study, 
blood volume permitting.  PK endpoints will include the following sebelipase alfa PK parameters 
in serum, as data permit:  
 maximum observed serum concentration (C max) 
 apparent serum clearance (CL) 
The impact of ADAs on sebelipase alfa PK will also be explored, if data permit.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacodynamics 
Blood samples will also be collected to support exploratory analyses of changes or percent 
changes from baseline in potential disease-related biomarkers, which may be identified based 
on emerging information from the sebelipase alfa development program and scientific literature.  
3.2.[ADDRESS_15491]’s treatment in the study is expected to be at least [ADDRESS_15492]'s participation in the study, inclusive of a 3-week screening period

 The Investigator and Sponsor also have the right to withdraw subjects from the study at any 
time. Specific reasons for discontinuation may include but are not restricted to the following: 
 Intercurrent illness; 
 Medically significant AEs; 
 Protocol deviation or non-compliance; 
 Termination of the study by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Unnecessary withdrawals should be avoided as an excessive rate of withdrawal can render the 
study uninterpretable.  
4.6.[ADDRESS_15500]’s parent or legal guardian is free to withdraw consent and/or discontinue the subject’s 
participation in the study at any time, without prejudice to further treatment. A subject’s 
participation in the study may also be discontinued at any time at the discretion of the 
Investigator or Sponsor.  Should a subject’s parent or legal guardian decide to withdraw 
consent, all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as 
possible. The parent or legal guardian of subjects who are discontinued from the study should 
be asked about the reason(s) for their discontinuation and about the presence of AEs.  The date 
and the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF. Subjects who discontinue prior 
to IMP administration will be replaced. 
Subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the study will be asked to complete all 
discontinuation assessments prior to withdrawal (see Appendix A ), if possible.  Information on 
the survival of discontinued subjects will be collected until completion of the study.  Serious AEs 
will be followed according to Section 7.2.[ADDRESS_15501]’s participation in the 
study, the Investigator will document the reason(s) for study discontinuation in the eCRF. 
In the event that a subject dies, permission will be sought (through a separate informed consent 
form) from the subject’s parent or legal guardian for an autopsy.  Samples collected from these 
procedures will be used to further understand LAL Deficiency and the effect of sebelipase alfa. 
When a subject fails to return for scheduled assessments, the following efforts should be made 
to contact [CONTACT_5657]/her parent or legal guardian to determine a reason for the failure to return:

 5 Schedule of Assessments and Study Procedures 
The schedule of assessments is presented in Appendix A .  
Subjects who are clinically stable enough to tolerate general anesthesia may be considered for 
central line placement for long-term vascular access, in accordance with institutional guidelines.  
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be considered for subjects receiving general 
anesthesia and/or sedation for central line placement or for other procedures (see 
Section 5.1.8 ). 
European Medicines Agency  (EMA ) recommend ed blood volume limits should be used as a 
guidance  for blood sampling in  this study:  http://www.emea.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/ 
document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500003754.pdf.  Per individual, the study -
related blood loss should not exceed 3% of  the total blood volume during a 4 -week period or 1% 
of total blood volume at any single time.  The actual situation of the child (sleep/activity, severity 
of anemia, and hemodynamic state) must permit such blood sampling.  Table 11 summarizes 
mean blood volume per body weight based on an individual's age.  Assuming a total blood 
volume of 80 mL/kg body weight for an average patient in this study, 3% of total blood volume 
corresponds to 2.4 mL/kg body weight and 1% of total blood volume corresponds to about 0.8 
mL/kg body weight.

 5.1.3 Medical History 
Complete medical history, including prenatal, birth history, family history and disease history will 
be recorded at Screening. 
5.1.4 Demographic Information 
The following demographic information will be collected at Screening: date of birth, birth weight, 
gender, race and ethnicity. 
5.1.5 Anthropometrics 
Anthropometrics, including weight, recumbent length (subjects ≤2 years of age at the time of 
examination) or height (subjects >2 years of age at the time of examination), head 
circumference, mid-upper arm circumference, and abdominal circumference, will be measured 
at the timepoints specified in Appendix A . 
Refer to the SOM for a detailed description of the procedure for each anthropometric 
measurement. 
 
Percentiles or z-scores for WFA, WFL/WFH, LFA/HFA, HCFA, and MUACFA will be determined 
based on WHO child growth standards (WHO Multicentre Growth Reference Study Group, 2006 
and 2007).  Growth status will also be classified according to 3 dichotomous indicators: 
underweight (<-[ADDRESS_15507] deviations [SD] from the median for WFA), wasting (<-2 SD from the 
median for WFL/WFH), and stunting (<-2 SD from the median for LFA/HFA).

general appearance, skin, head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, 
extremities/joints, and neurological status. Whenever possible, the same person should perform 
the physical examination at each study visit. Abnormal findings will be captured in the eCRF. 
Every physical examination will also include the following: 
 Liver size: A clinical assessment of liver size (palpable/non palpable and centimeters 
below costal margin), regularity (smooth/nodular) and sensitivity (tender/non tender) will 
be made.  
 Spleen size: A clinical assessment of spleen size (palpable/non palpable and 
centimeters below costal margin), regularity (smooth/nodular) and sensitivity (tender/ 
non-tender) will be made.  
 Lymphadenopathy:  An assessment of the size, location, and character of any palpable 
lymph nodes will be made. Areas to be examined include: cephalic (occipi[INVESTIGATOR_307], 
preauricular, postauricular, submental, submandibular), cervical, clavicular, axillary, and 
inguinal. Any enlarged nodes will be characterized as tender or non-tender.

All imaging scans will be acquired and the results interpreted by a magnetic resonance 
technician or other qualified individual using standardized imaging protocols.   
Refer to the Imaging Manual for instructions on image acquisition and analysis. 
5.1.9 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], systolic and diastolic blood pressure and core 
body temperature (rectal or oral).  Assessment of pulse rate and blood pressure will be taken 
after the subject has been in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547]. 
Vital signs will be measured at the timepoints specified in Appendix A .  On dosing days, vital 
signs will initially be recorded pre-infusion, every 15 (±5) minutes during infusion and every 
30 (±10) minutes from [ADDRESS_15510] 2 months, with no moderate- to-severe IARs, vital signs will be 
recorded pre-infusion and every 30 (±10) minutes during infusion and from [ADDRESS_15511]-infusion period for vital sign 
monitoring may be shortened from 4 hours to 2 hours.

 Additional readings may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator and in the event of an IAR. 
5.1.10 Electrocardiogram 
An age-appropriate 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained at Screening and 
reviewed by a qualified clinician.  Additional age-appropriate 12-lead ECGs may be obtained at 
subsequent study visits, if clinically indicated.  Any abnormalities identified by [CONTACT_16250].   
5.1.11 Laboratory Assessments 
Blood and urine samples for laboratory tests will be collected at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix A .  
Prior to any dose change, serum lipid, serum liver, hematology, chemistry, ferritin and hs- CRP 
shall be obtained. Serum lipid and serum liver assessments should be taken 4, 8, and 12 weeks 
following any study drug or lipid drug dose change. 
Due to the limitations on the volume of blood collection that is considered to be acceptable in 
young children with very small total circulating blood volumes (see Section 5), the laboratory 
samples will be ranked in the order corresponding to the study objectives, as shown in Table 2.  
Only Tier [ADDRESS_15512]’s weight, as well as the subject’s clinical status, permit (see 
Section 5 for further details).

5.1.[ADDRESS_15514] 
The Denver II will be administered at the timepoints specified in Appendix A . 
The Denver II is a standardized measure to assess development in children from 1 month to 6 
years of age ( Frankenberg, 1992, Pediatr ). The Denver II includes performance-based and 
parent-reported items in 4 functional areas: fine motor-adaptive, gross motor, personal-social, 
and language skills. The test was normed on a diverse sample of children who were full term 
and had no obvious developmental disabilities; the norms indicate when 25%, 50%, 75%, and 
90% of children passed each item. The Denver II has good inter-rater and test-retest reliability 
(correlations ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_15515] tests). 
The Denver II must be administered by a trained clinician and takes an average of 10 to 
20 minutes to complete.  Administration and scoring of the Denver II is based upon the child's 
age.  (Note that for premature infants, the number of months premature is subtracted from the 
infant's chronological age.)  For each test item administered, the clinician determines if the 
child's response falls within or outside of the normal expected range of success on that item for 
the child's age. The interpretation of the individual test items is then used to classify the child's 
development in each functional area and for the overall test.

 5.1.[ADDRESS_15516]’s weight, a blood 
sample for serum isolation (2 aliquots) will be obtained at the timepoints specified in 
Appendix A . The serum sample will be used to identify baseline disease and dynamic markers 
that will help better understand the pathogenesis of LAL Deficiency, related comorbidities and 
response to treatment.  Given the rarity of LAL Deficiency and the paucity of information on 
disease characteristics, the definitive list of analytes remains to be determined.  
Refer to the laboratory manual for further details regarding the collection, processing, and 
storage of these samples. 
5.1.[ADDRESS_15517].  Sampling for measurement of sebelipase alfa serum levels will be performed during the 
study visits indicated in Appendix A .  These samples will be collected within designated time 
windows, rather than at discrete timepoints, to allow more flexibility in the management of PK 
sampling in these subjects and to provide opportunities for measurement of drug concentrations 
across a broader timeperiod with limited sampling.   
In all subjects: 
 0 to 1 hours after the start of the infusion; 
 Between 1 hour after the start of the infusion and the end of the infusion 
(i.e. when the infusion bag has been emptied, but prior to the sodium chloride 
flush). 
In those subjects for whom the thresholds for allowed blood collection volumes have not been 
exceeded:  
 0 to 0.5 hours after completion of the infusion; 
 0.5 to 1 hour after completion of the infusion; 
 [ADDRESS_15518] clinical parameters associated with sebelipase alfa 
use and acid lipase biology.  DNA sequences, including both the protein coding sequence and

 sequences that regulate gene transcription, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) stability and 
the efficiency of protein translation that may be investigated include: 
1. LAL (LIPA); 
2. Genes coding for other proteins involved in lipid biology that may contribute to and/or 
modify the disease phenotype of LAL Deficiency, e.g. ABCA1; 
3. Genes that may modify susceptibility to any sebelipase alfa related AEs. 
Where possible and in compliance with local regulations, a blood sample for DNA extraction will 
be collected from the subject at Screening or as soon as practically possible thereafter based on 
blood volume collection threshold, unless a stored DNA sample is already available for the 
subject.  The DNA will be stored and used as part of a later pooled analysis.  This will include 
determining the spectrum of LAL mutations in subjects with growth failure due to LAL Deficiency 
and the relationship between gene mutation, safety, efficacy and susceptibility to anti- 
sebelipase alfa antibody development.  
If feasible, a blood sample for DNA extraction and testing of the LAL gene mutations will be 
collected from the subjects’ biological parents after a separate consent has been obtained. 
The Sponsor will only analyze DNA sequences within genes relevant to the mode of action and 
response to sebelipase alfa, including variants important in understanding AEs, and candidate 
genes with a potential role in the etiology, pathogenesis, and progression of LAL Deficiency.  
Samples will be stored by [CONTACT_1034], or designee, in a secure, monitored, and controlled 
environment.   No additional testing will be performed on the samples collected in the study. 
Refer to the laboratory manual for further details regarding the collection, processing, and 
storage of these samples. 
5.1.16 LAL Enzyme Activity 
Study inclusion will be contingent on documented decreased LAL activity relative to the normal 
range of the lab performing the assay or a documented result of molecular genetic testing 
confirming a diagnosis of LAL Deficiency.  
Blood samples will also be collected at Screening to measure LAL activity in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in a dried blood spot (DBS) collected on filter paper to ensure 
consistency of LAL activity measurement in all subjects. In the unlikely event of a discrepancy 
between the diagnosis of LAL Deficiency based on baseline LAL activity in PBMCs and/or DBS 
and the previously documented diagnosis, a subject may be discontinued from the study and 
may be replaced.

6.1  Description of IMP 
Details of the non-clinical experience to date with sebelipase alfa, as well as IMP stability 
information, can be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure (IB).  Sebelipase 
alfa must be administered under close supervision of the Investigator, or designee. 
Sebelipase alfa is provided in single dose 10 mL glass vials. The solution (total 10.5 mL 
including 5% overfill) has an approximate concentration of 2 mg/mL. Exact concentration will be 
on the individual vials.  
Sebelipase alfa contains no preservatives and vials are single use only. 
Sodium chloride (0.9%) for injection, for use in preparation of diluted solutions for infusion, will 
be sourced locally by [CONTACT_5243]. 
6.2 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
No randomization schemes will be employed; all subjects will receive the same starting dose of 
sebelipase alfa in this study.   
Each subject will be assigned an enrollment number after informed consent has been obtained 
from the subject's parent or legal guardian.  This enrollment number will be used to identify the 
subject throughout his/her participation in the study. 
A subject who does not meet all study eligibility criteria due to a potentially transient condition 
observed at screening (e.g., discontinuation of another investigational medicinal product within 
[ADDRESS_15521] <6 months of 
age), will be allowed to return for re-screening.

(36ºF to 46ºF).  (Note: temperature excursions up to 25ºC for up to [ADDRESS_15524] not been 
shown to be associated with loss of enzyme activity.)  Vials should not be frozen and should be 
protected from light during storage.

 The infusion bag or syringe containing sebelipase alfa diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride should 
be prepared just prior to the start of infusion administration.  For study sites where there is a 
requirement for dilution at a separate location this needs to be done in a place with controlled 
and aseptic conditions.  Although the infusion bag or syringe is stable at room temperature 
(23ºC to 26ºC) for 12 hours, it should be used as soon as possible after preparation. 
6.3.3 Disposition 
The Investigator or designated person (e.g. a licensed pharmacist) will be responsible for 
maintaining accurate records for all IMP used.  Opened sebelipase alfa vials still containing any 
residual volume may be stored at room temperature for IMP accountability.  Following IMP 
accountability, the Sponsor or designee will give written authorization to the Investigator to 
return or destroy any remaining IMP as instructed. 
6.4 Preparation and Administration of IMP 
Under no circumstances will the IMP be used other than as directed in the protocol. 
6.4.1 Preparation of IMP 
 The infusion bag (or syringe) containing sebelipase alfa will be prepared just prior to the start of 
infusion administration. Prior to preparation of the infusion, the vials of study drug will be visually 
inspected.  The solution should not be used if it contains foreign particulate matter or is 
discolored.  The solution may be used if a small number of visible translucent to opalescent or 
white amorphous or threadlike particles are present in the vial. The contents should NOT be 
warmed using a microwave or other heat source. Sebelipase alfa is a protein and will be 
handled and mixed gently to prevent foaming.  
If subject’s weight cannot reliably be obtained on the morning of the infusion then the subject’s 
most recent weight measurement within [ADDRESS_15525] 0.1 kg, will be used for 
calculating the volume of study drug to be withdrawn from the vial(s) to prepare the infusion.  
Sebelipase alfa should be diluted to a concentration of 0.1 to 1.5 mg/ml for infusion. Refer to the 
IMP manual for detailed instructions regarding preparation.  
6.4.[ADDRESS_15526]’s weight, and must be administered 
under close supervision of the Investigator, or designee. Sebelipase alfa should not be 
administered at an infusion rate exceeding 4 ml/kg/hr.  For detailed administration instructions 
please refer to the IMP manual. 
Subjects who are medically stable, as determined by [CONTACT_737], may transfer to a local 
medical center for long-term treatment, contingent upon the local medical center being 
appropriately qualified and securing the required regulatory and IRB/IEC approvals.  Schedul ed

 study assessments may also be performed at a local medical center with access to the 
appropriate facilities and expertise. 
6.[ADDRESS_15527] possibly related to IMP will be designated as an IAR. In addition, if, at 
any time during the study, the Investigator observes symptoms that he/she considers to be 
consistent with an IAR or hypersensitivity reaction related to administration of study drug, the 
symptoms should be recorded as an AE(s) and designated as an IAR(s). Individual adverse 
event terms should be recorded rather than the terms, IAR or Infusion Associated Reaction. 
As with any ERT, medications and equipment for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions 
must be available for immediate use in case of unexpected, severe hypersensitivity reactions.  
These supplies include, but are not limited to, oxygen, acetaminophen, antihistamines 
(e.g., diphenhydramine, parenteral and oral [PO]), corticosteroids, epi[INVESTIGATOR_16207]. 
General guidelines for classifying the severity of a reaction are provided in Section 7.1.[ADDRESS_15528] acute IARs occur within 2 hours of the infusion. Signs of a 
possible acute IAR may include: 
 Hyperemia (flushing),  fever and/or chills, nausea, pruritus, urticaria, gastro-intestinal 
symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) cardiopulmonary reactions, 
including chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing, stridor, hypotension or hypertension. 
If any of the above signs and symptoms are observed during the infusion and the subject 
remains hemodynamically stable: 
 The infusion rate must be slowed by 50% (reduced to half the rate being given at the 
onset of the event, e.g. from 10 mL/hr to 5 mL/hr) and the infusion time extended in 
accordance with the institutional standard of care. The infusion rate may be decreased 
further by 25% if symptoms persist. If the event resolves, the infusion should continue 
for a minimum of 30 minutes at the reduced rate before the rate is increased to 75% of 
the original rate on the infusion schedule.  If the subject tolerates infusion at 75% of the 
original rate for at least 30 minutes the original rate may be restored for the remainder 
of the infusion. 
 In accordance with institutional standard of care for subject’s age, treatment with oral 
anti-pyretic and/or antihistamine should be considered. 
In subjects who experience severe IAR with clinically significant cardiovascular effects (e.g., 
hypertension or hypotension defined as a decline approaching 20-30% of their preinfusion value 
without alternative etiology, agitation, pain, fluid overload, dehydration), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856] 
(significant shortness of breath, stridor, wheezing, laryngeal edema or swelling of tongue),

 cardiac arrhythmias,  or anaphylactic/anaphylicatoid shock with hypotension and circulatory 
collapse: 
 The infusion should be stopped. 
 The subject should be treated  with oxygen if available, IV antihistamines, 
corticosteroids, and IM epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], if necessary, in accordance with institutional 
standard of care for the subject's age.  
 Dosing of the subject will be suspended until the Safety Review Committee has 
completed review of the IAR, and any other relevant safety data.  
 Subjects who experience a moderate or severe IAR should have a serum sample 
collected for tryptase 1-3 hours after the IAR onset and another serum sample for 
tryptase and ADA during the next study visit (>4 days after the IAR) prior to the 
infusion. Skin testing may be considered. 
Additional details on the management of subjects with infusion reactions are outlined in the 
table in Appendix B .

 [ADDRESS_15530].  Pre-existing conditions 
that worsen in severity during the course of the study are to be reported as AEs. 
All AEs occurring during the clinical study will be reported on the AE page of the eCRF as 
described in  Section 7.3. 
The Investigator will assess the severity, causality (relationship to IMP), and seriousness of 
each AE. 
Severity: The severity of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 or higher.  The CTCAE displays 
Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on the 
general guideline below.  Detailed instructions on grading of events by [CONTACT_16252] (MedDRA) system organ class and lower level term are available online.  
 Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily life (e.g., preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16208], using the telephone, managing money). 
 Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self-care 
activities of daily life (e.g., bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden). 
 Grade 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE. 
Causality: AEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_16253], unlikely related, possibly 
related, or related to IMP.  Table 3  provides general guidance on the assessment of causality.  
Assessment of causality should be based on the Investigator’s medical judgment and the 
observed symptoms associated with the event.  For data reporting purposes, related AEs will be

Table 3 Assessment of Causality 
Relationship  to IMP  Criteria for Judgment  
Related  Reasonable temporal relationship of the clinical event 
to IMP administration AND cannot be reasonably 
explained by [CONTACT_1604] (such as the subject’s 
clinical state, concomitant therapy, and / or other 
interventions).  
Possibly Related  The temporal rel ationship of the clinical event to IMP 
administration makes causal relationship possible but 
not unlikely AND other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Unlikely Related  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to IMP 
administration makes causal relationship unlikely but 
not impossible AND other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions provide a 
plausible explanation for the observed event.  
Not Related  Data are available to clearly identify an alternative 
cause for the reaction.  
 
Seriousness: AEs will be classified as serious or non-serious according to the definitions 
provided below.  
Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event  is any AE that results in any of the following outcomes:  
 Death 
 Immediately life threatening 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed. 
All AEs that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events .  Given the severity and life threatening nature of LAL Deficiency in infants, it is 
likely that these subjects will be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16199].

 Continuation of this initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16209].  
Also, a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16210] a study procedure is not considered an SAE.  However, 
during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], AEs will be collected and assessed for seriousness & reported 
appropriately (e.g., important medical event or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). 
All SAEs and IARs must be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section 7.4.

be recorded under one diagnosis.  
 
AEs will be recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent until completion of the last 
scheduled visit, i.e., the follow-up visit.  AEs occurring after signing the informed consent but 
prior to the first dose of study medication will only be recorded if assessed as related to protocol

  Follow-up information must be reported within 15 calendar days 
The Sponsor will comply with all additional local safety requirements, as applicable.  Periodic safety 
reporting to competent authorities will be done by [CONTACT_16260]. 
7.4.4 Sponsor Reporting: Notifying Participating Investigators 
It is the responsibility of the study Sponsor to immediately notify all participating Investigators, in 
of any suspected AE associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected, 
as well as any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggest a significant risk for human 
subjects.   
7.5 Dose Modification and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16212] a recommendation from the independent SC (see Section 7.6.1 ), the Sponsor may 
suspend dosing for an individual subject or all subjects enrolled in the study, at any time, due to 
poor tolerance or potential safety risks. 
Specific rules for suspending dosing in an individual subject are provided in Appendix C .   
7.6 Medical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site. This 
safety monitoring will include a thorough assessment and appropriate reporting of AEs as noted 
above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring plan 
(see Section 10).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type 
of SAEs. 
7.6.[ADDRESS_15537] safety in the study will be provided by [CONTACT_16261].  The activities and composition of the SC will be outlined in the SC Charter which 
will be ratified during the initial meeting, prior to commencement of dosing of the study subjects.  
The SC will be tasked with ongoing review of safety and efficacy data in order to advise the 
study Investigators regarding dose continuation and dose escalation decisions for the study 
(see Section 3.1 for details).  The SC will be comprised of a group of individuals with pertinent 
medical expert[INVESTIGATOR_16275], on a regular basis, the conduct of this study and the emergent 
safety data.  This SC will provide oversight and monitoring of the clinical study in compliance 
with GCP and associated guidance materials.  These safety monitoring functions and the 
oversight of such activities are distinct from the requirement for study review and approval by [CONTACT_16262].  
The SC is an independent body of experts that serves in an advisory capacity to the Sponsor to 
ensure that clinical trial participants are not exposed to unreasonable or unnecessary risks.  
Collectively, the SC will have methodological and clinical expertise relevant to the study design 
and population.  SC membership will begin before the start of the clinical trial and last for its 
duration.

 Core members of the SC will not participate in the trial as Investigators or sub-investigators, as 
members of any team otherwise participating in the trial, or in any other capacity that may 
compromise their privileged activities on the SC.  Neither members of the SC nor their 
immediate families will have a direct financial interest in the Sponsor or an interest that is 
dependent on the outcome of the trial.  To be considered for SC membership, all candidates 
must disclose all actual or potential conflicts of interest, including any financial interests in, or 
research activity on a competing product.  SC members will be compensated at an appropriate 
market rate for time spent reviewing, discussing, and attending the meetings.  The Sponsor will 
also reimburse SC members for any out- of-pocket travel expenses required for attendance at 
the meetings.  Aside from the above, SC members will receive no additional compensation for 
their membership on the committee.

 [ADDRESS_15538] completed treatment in the study 
(up to 5 years) or have died or withdrawn from the study.  These analyses will be considered 
supportive rather than confirmatory. 
Prior to locking the database for each of the above-mentioned analyses, all data editing will be 
complete and decisions regarding the evaluability of all subject data for inclusion in the 
statistical analysis will be made.  The rationale for excluding any data from the statistical 
analyses will be prospectively defined, and classification of all or part of a subject’s data as 
non-evaluable will be completed and documented before the entire database is locked.  
8.1 General Considerations 
All data will be presented in listings, and summary tables and/or graphs will be provided, as 
appropriate.  Unless otherwise noted, all tabulations for efficacy endpoints will be presented for 
subjects in the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set and tabulations for other endpoints will be 
presented for subjects in the Full Analysis Set (FAS).  Descriptive summary statistics (n, mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) will be calculated for the continuous 
variables.  Shift tables and/or frequencies and percentages will be produced for the categorical 
variables.  When percentages are reported, the number of treated subjects will be used as the 
denominator.  As noted, 95% two-sided confidence intervals (CIs) will be calculated around the 
estimates based on the exact binomial distribution for binomial endpoints and the t-distribution 
for continuous endpoints.   
Baseline will be defined as the last measurement prior to the first infusion of sebelipase alfa.  
(Note: For exploratory analyses, the first available measurement after initiation of treatment may 
be used as baseline if a pretreatment measurement is unavailable.)  Survival rates will be based 
on the age of the subject.  Other endpoints, unless otherwise noted, will be based on exposure 
(i.e., duration of time since the first infusion of sebelipase alfa).  
Details of the planned analyses and statistical methodologies will be provided in a separate 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 
8.2 Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 8 subjects who meet the requirements for inclusion in the Primary Efficacy 
Analysis Set (i.e., subjects whose first dose is on or before the age of 8 months) will be enrolled 
in this study.  Additional subjects who meet the same entry criteria, but are between [ADDRESS_15539] dose, may be enrolled and followed for safety information.

 This sample size was selected to facilitate comparison with natural history study (LAL-1-NH01) 
in patients with early onset LAL Deficiency.  An analysis of preliminary data from study 
LAL-1-NH01 shows that, of the [ADDRESS_15540] 12 months of age.  (Note: Of these 18 patients, 5 had 
received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant and one had received a liver transplant.)  An 
exact 95% CI for survival past 12 months of age in these patients is (0.14%, 27.29%).  An 
analysis of survival, beginning on the date that growth failure criteria were met, indicated no 
relationship between age at onset of growth failure and survival past onset of growth failure.  
Thus, if the lower limit of an exact 95% CI for the 12-month survival rate in the current study is 
greater than 27.29%, there would be statistical evidence that the rate of 12-month survival in the 
current study is superior to that in study LAL-1-NH01 for a similar patient population.  For the 
current study, if [ADDRESS_15541] 95% CI for 12-month survival would be 
(34.91%, 96.81%), with the lower limit exceeding the upper limit of the CI for study LAL-1-NH01.  
8.3 Analysis Sets 
The following analysis sets will be defined:  
Full Analysis Set 
The FAS will include all subjects who received any amount of IMP. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis Set 
The Efficacy Analysis Set will include subjects in the FAS who were no older than [ADDRESS_15542] one complete infusion of IMP in this study.   
Per Protocol Analysis Set 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) will include subjects in the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set who, in 
addition, receive at least [ADDRESS_15543] and tabulated.  
Chronological age will be reported in months to one decimal (xx.x months).   
8.[ADDRESS_15544] Accountability 
Data from all subjects who are enrolled (i.e., treated) in the study will be included in the 
summary of subject accountability.  The frequency and percentage of subjects who are enrolled 
in the study, discontinued from the study, and completed the study, along with reasons for 
discontinuation, will be summarized.

 8.6 Study Treatment Usage and Compliance 
Number of weeks in the study and number of study infusions received by [CONTACT_16263]. The number (percent) of subjects who receive all study infusions 'per protocol' 
(i.e., subjects without missed infusions or infusion interruptions or rate changes) will be 
provided.  A listing will be provided that summarizes sebelipase alfa exposure by [CONTACT_1130], and 
date of first dose and total number of doses (by [CONTACT_15994]) of sebelipase alfa under study 
LAL-CL03.   
8.7 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy will be analyzed for the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set.  If the PPS is not identical to the 
Primary Efficacy Analysis Set (i.e., if at least one patient in the Primary Efficacy Analysis Set is 
excluded from the PPS), efficacy analyses will be repeated for the PPS. 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects surviving to [ADDRESS_15545] dose of IMP will be computed. 
Estimated survival rates and median age at death derived from this study will be compared to 
rates/times reported in the literature , and will be discussed in conjunction with information 
derived from a natural history study in a similar patient population (study LAL-1-NH01). 
Anthropometric indicators of growth, standardized by [CONTACT_16264].  Change from baseline in 
anthropometric data will be tabulated as continuous data.  In addition, the percentages of 
subjects who meet criteria for underweight, stunting, and wasting will be tabulated for each 
timepoint.  For anthropometric indicators of growth, age will be adjusted for prematurity if 
gestational age is <[ADDRESS_15546] is under 12 months of age.  The adjustment will 
be made such that corrected age = chronological age minus the number of months premature. 
Change and/or percent changes from baseline in AST, ALT, and serum ferritin will be tabulated 
for each evaluation timepoint. 
A subject will be considered to have achieved transfusion-free hemoglobin normalization 
(TFHN) if the subject meets all of the following criteria: 
1. Has two post-baseline measurements of hemoglobin at least 4 weeks apart that are both 
above the age-adjusted lower limit of normal (LLN); 
2. Has no known additional measurements of hemoglobin that are below the age-adjusted 
LLN during the (minimum) 4-week period; and

 3. Had no transfusions during the (minimum) 4-week period, and also no transfusions for 
[ADDRESS_15547] hemoglobin measurement in the (minimum) 4-week period. 
If all [ADDRESS_15548] 13 weeks (3 months).  The proportion of subjects who have maintained transfusion-free 
normal hemoglobin will be summarized. 
The Denver II total score and functional area scores will be derived from the questionnaire in 
accordance with the Technical Manual and compared to appropriate demographic norms.  The 
total score and functional area scores will be summarized as continuous data and according to 
the classification as to whether the subject displays abnormal/normal development ( Polat, 2010, 
Pediatr Int ). 
Shift tables will be used to tabulate dietary changes, including discontinuation of a low-fat/low-
cholesterol diet and/or introduction of an unrestricted age-appropriate diet.  Observed values 
and changes and/or percent changes from baseline in other exploratory efficacy endpoints will 
be tabulated for each evaluation timepoint.   
8.8 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be analyzed for the FAS.   
8.8.1 Adverse Events 
All reported AEs will be listed from the start of dosing with sebelipase alfa to the end of 
participation in this study.  Separate listings of SAEs and IARs will also be provided.  The 
numbers and percentages of subjects experiencing any AE, any SAE, any IAR, any related AE, 
any related SAE, and discontinuations due to an AE will be tabulated. 
The frequency of treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, and IARs by [CONTACT_16265] (coded using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [MedDRA®] version 14 
or higher) will be tabulated.  Frequencies will also be presented by [CONTACT_16266].  In addition, frequency of AEs, SAEs, and IARs will be presented for time periods 
spanning the entire course of treatment with sebelipase alfa: from the start of dosing with 
sebelipase alfa in this study to [ADDRESS_15549] dose, >3 to 6 months, >6 to 12 months, 
>12 to 18 months, >18 to 24 months and >24 months.  As appropriate, additional listings, 
summary tables and graphics will be generated to evaluate IAR frequency and severity over 
time.  A listing of subjects who withdraw from the study due to AEs will be presented, and the 
incidence of AEs leading to study discontinuation will be summarized.

 Appendix B: Diagnosis and Recommendations for Management of Infusion Associated 
Reactions 
Symptoms may include but  are not 
limited to:  Actions  in accordance with institutional 
standard of care   
Mild  
Common  
 Hyperemia (Flushing)  
 Lightheadedness  
 Nausea  
 Mild chest discomfort (tightness)  
 
Less Common  
 Fever and/or shivering  
 Palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]  
 Headache  
 Irritability (especially in young children)  
  Slow infusion rate by 50%  
 Administer oral anti -pyretic and/or anti -
histamine  
 Decrease infusion rate by a further 25% if 
symptoms persist  
 Increase infusion time  
 If the event resolves, the infusion should 
continue at reduced rate for a minimum of 
30 minutes before infusion is increased to 
75% of original rate.  If subject tolerates 
infusion at 75% of the original rate for at 
least 30 minutes the original rate may be 
restored for the remainder of the infusion.  
 If symptoms continue despi[INVESTIGATOR_16220]  
 Pre-treat with oral antihistamine and 
antipyretic prior (approximately  1.5h) to 
next infusion  
o e.g., diphenhydramine (1 mg/kg po) and 
acetaminophen (15 mg/kg po)  
Moderate Reaction  
 Hyperemia (flushing)  
 Chest dis comfort  
 Itching and/or raised urticarial rash  
 Severe headache  
 Gastro intestinal symptoms, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, abdominal crampi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
  Stop infusion  
 Give antihistamine IV and consider IV 
steroids  
 Give any prescribed inhaler treatment 
if appropriate  
 If the event has resolves, the infusion 
may continue at reduced rate of 50% 
of the original for a minimum of 30 
minutes before infusion is increased to 
75% of original rate.  If patient 
tolerates infusion at 75% of the original 
rate for at least 30 minutes  the original 
rate may be restored for the remainder 
of the infusion.  
 Pre-treat with oral antihistamine and 
antipyretic prior to next infusion  
 Collect serum sample for tryptase 1 -3 
hours after the IAR onset and another 
serum sample for tryptase and ADA 
during the next study visit ( > 4 days 
after the IAR) prior to the infusion.  
 Skin testing may be  considered.

Severe  Reaction  
 
 Clinically significant cardiovascular 
effects: e.g., hypertension or hypotension 
defined as a decline approaching 20 -30% 
of their preinfusion value without 
alternative etiology, agitation, pain, fluid 
overload, dehydration  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]: Significant 
shortness of breath, stridor, wheezing, 
laryngeal oedema, swelling of tongue.  
 Cardiac Arrhythmias  
 Anaphylactic/Anaphylactoi d shock with 
hypotension and circulatory collapse.   Stop Infusion  
 Give oxygen, if available  
 Give epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (adrenaline) IM or 
inhaled  
 Give antihistamines IV and steroids IV  
 Collect serum sample for tryptase 1 -3 
hours after the IAR onset and another 
serum  sample for tryptase and ADA during 
the next study visit ( > 4 days after the IAR) 
prior to the infusion.  
 Skin testing may be considered  
 Dosing of the subject will be suspended 
until the Safety Committee has completed 
the review of the IAR and any other 
relevant safety data (Section 6.5)

Appendix C: Dose Modification and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16221]-CL03 Study 
In the absence of an approved grading scale that can be applied to specific patient populations, this 
protocol will apply the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Classification of Adverse Events (NCI 
CTCAE), version 4.0 or higher.  (http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010- 06-
14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf).   
 
The following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16222]: 
 
For IARs (refer to the definition in Section 6.5), the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_16223]:  
 Subjects who develop a Grade 3 (severe) or higher IAR must stop treatment until their information 
is reviewed by [CONTACT_16274]. Dosing with alterations to the infusion regimen (e.g., pretreatment and/or 
slowing the rate of infusion) may resume once the SC and the Sponsor approve. Confirmation may 
also be sought from regulatory authorities prior to resuming dosing.

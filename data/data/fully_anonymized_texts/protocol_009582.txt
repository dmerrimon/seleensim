In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580116] 2.[ADDRESS_762820] method by [CONTACT_580123]  (ED) has yet to be established. The key objective of the process of 
triage is to determine which patient is at the highest risk because that patient 
will require the greatest amount of resources and attention to determine the most appropriate treatment.  Risk stratification is a necessar y method for 
triaging patients, particularly in the ED, as the number of patients presenting to the ED and the availability of staff is never equally matched requiring a method to determine the order and urgency in which patients are treated.  
 Recent scori ng systems to determine risk of significant clinical deterioration in 
patient health, such as the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) , utilize vital 
signs (i.e., heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], blood pressure, temperature, pulse oximetry) and a subjective measure of the patient’s mental status (i.e., AVPU score: alert, reacts to voice, reacts to pain, or unconscious). Elevated MEWS values has been shown to be related to mortality .
1 In the [LOCATION_008], a 
national early warning score (NEWS) has been implemented nationwide and been shown to discriminate patients at risk of the combined outcome of cardiac arrest, unanticipated intensive care unit ( ICU) admission , or death within [ADDRESS_762821], for patients presenting to the ED has recently been reported. Unlike prior risk stratification tools that relied on basic vital sign data,  this 
algorit hm utilizes multiple metrics of heart rate variability (HRV) as well as a 
machine learning approach to solve the risk classification problem.  The 
algorithm requires the collection of vital sign data, patient mental status, and at 
least  5 minutes of continuous electrocardiography (to calculate HRV  metrics ). 
It was shown to be more accurate than MEWS in predicting cardiac arrest within [ADDRESS_762822] serious complications (mortality, car diac arrest, ventricular 
tachycardia, hypotension requiring inotropes or intra- aortic balloon pump  
(IABP)  insertion, intubation or mechanical ventilation, complete heart block, 
bradycardia requiring pacing, and recurrent ischemia requiring revascularization) within [ADDRESS_762823] 
elevation/depression and troponin in predicting complications within 72 hours.
4 
The primary limitation of the algorithm is that it has been developed and tested 
in Singaporean patients . Verification of the results of the studies using this 
algorithm in other  patient cohorts  is required. As such, the proposed study will 
investigate the sensitivity and specificity of th e algorithm.

waveform and heart rate, and to alarm when heart rate is above or below limits 
set by [CONTACT_73693].  
Each site will receive 3 X -series monitors to be used on subjects enrolled in the 
study .  These devices will be on loan and will be returned to the sponsor at the 
completion of the study.  
The patient’s ECG is monitored by [CONTACT_580127] a 3- , 5-, 
or 12- lead patient cable or hands -free therapy electrodes. The ECG waveform is 
presented on the display along with the following information:    
• averaged heart rate, derived by [CONTACT_35755] R to R intervals  
• lead selection - I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 (with ECG 
cable),  PADDLES, or PADS.  
• ECG  size - 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 cm/mV, AUTO  
• status messages  
The ECG bandwidth is user selectable.  
IMPORTANT:  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WE ARE REQUIRING THE RECORDING OF A 3-LEAD, CONTINUOUS ECG  OF AT LEAST [ADDRESS_762836] continuous waveforms to a 
full disclosure case log for the patient being monitored. This feature needs to be enabled by a supervisor. The supervisor can access this feature by [CONTACT_580128] ( ), and then selecting Supervisor>Log>Waveform Recording. In this menu, the following settings can be customized:  
• Record Displayed Waveforms – Record only the top waveform that is 
displayed or record all     waveforms that are displayed.  
• Record Additional Waveforms – Always record the CO2 waveform or 
always record the IBP and the CO2 waveforms.  
Note: When Continuous waveform recording is disabled, no waveforms (except 
snapshots) are recorded.  
The full disclosure case can, at a minimum, concurrently store the following information:

In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580116] 2.0 Page 25 of 32 
 • 32 monitor snapshots  
• 500 non- ECG events  
• 24 hours of continuous ECG (4 waveforms), Capnography, IBP (3 
channels), and Pads Impedance  
The actual information that is stored depends on usage. Also, the specific 
combination of stored continuous waveform data depends on how the waveform recording settings are configured in the Supervisor menu.  
ECG Monitoring Setup 
The proper application and placement of electrodes is essential for high quality 
ECG monitoring. Good contact [CONTACT_580129].  
The following procedure describes how to monitor a patient’s ECG using 3- and 
5-Lead ECG cables.  
To monitor a patient’s ECG using 3- and 5- Lead ECG cables, perform t he 
following steps:  
1. Prepare the patient's skin for electrode application:  
2. Apply the electrode pads to the patient.  
3. Connect each lead of the ECG cable to the appropriate electrode.  
4. Insert the patient cable plug into the ECG input connector on the X Series unit.  
5. Select the ECG waveforms to be displayed on the waveform trace display screen.  
6. Observe the patient‘s electrocardiogram on the display, and adjust size of the ECG waveform trace, as necessary.  
Preparing the Patient for Electrode Appli cation  
The proper application of electrodes is essential for high quality ECG monitoring. 
Good contact [CONTACT_580130].  
Before applying electrodes, prepare the patient’s skin, as necessary:  
• Shave or clip excess hair at electrode site.  
• Clean oily skin with an alcohol pad.  
• Rub site briskly to dry.

In-Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_580116] 2.[ADDRESS_762837] electrodes when using 3 - and 5- Lead 
cables to perform ECG monitoring. For 3- Lead ECG cables, apply electrodes as 
in Figure 4- 1, 3-Lead Electrode Placement. For 5- Lead ECG cables, apply 
electrodes as in Figure 4- 2, 5-Lead Electrode Placement.  
Avoid placing electrodes over tendons and major muscle masses.  
Make sure that the ECG electrodes are placed to allow defibrillation, if 
necessary.  
3-Lead Electrode Placement  
Depending upon local usage, the ECG leads are marked either RA, LA, and LL 
(or R, L, and F). The following table shows the markings and color codes for the 
differ ent lead sets.

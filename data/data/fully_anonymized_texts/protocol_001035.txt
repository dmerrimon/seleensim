 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)  
 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer -related death, with an estimated 1.6 
million deaths per year 1. In the U nited States, the American Cancer Society estimates that 
there will be approximately 250,000 new cases of lung cancer and 158,000 deaths in 2018 
2. Approximately 85% of patients with lung cancer have a group of histological subtypes, 
collectively known as non- small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) 3. The majority of patients with 
NSCLC present with stage IV  disease due to distant metastases or malignant pleural 
effusion and are treated with palliative intent 4. Even among patients undergoing surgery 
with curative intent, a high percentage of tumors recur, with 5- year overall survival (OS) 
ranging from 83% in stage IA to 36% in stage IIIA 5. Patients with metastatic NSCLC and 
no targetable oncogenic alterations usually have a poor prognosis, with low responses to 
the initial platinum -based chemotherapy and virtually universal relapse 6.  Immune 
checkpoint blockers (ICBs) have revolutionized the treatment of NSCLC, with the three 
approved drugs (nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab) being more  effective than 
docetaxel in randomized clinical trials 7-10.  Nevertheless, the benefit is restricted to a small 
percentage of patients, with objective response rates of less than 20% and median 
progression- free survival (PFS) ranging from 2.3 to 3.9 months.  
 
1.2 Atezoliz umab  
 
Under normal physiologic conditions, the immune checkpoint molecules maintain self -
tolerance preventing autoimmunity and limiting collateral damage to the normal tissues 
during response to infections 11,12. Cancer cells however, may co -opt these molecules to 
evade immune destruction. Programmed death 1 (PD -1), one of the key checkpoint 
molecules, may bind to two ligands, PD -L1/PD -L2. PD -L1 is an extracellular protein that 
downregulates immune responses primarily in peripheral tissues through binding to its two 
receptors PD -1 and B7.1. PD -1 is an inhibitory rec eptor expressed on T cells following T -
cell activation, which is sustained in states of chronic stimulation such as in chronic 
infection or cancer 13,14. Binding of PD -L1 with PD -1 inhibits T -cell proliferation, cytokine 
production, and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T 
cells. B7.1 is a molecule expressed on antigen -presenting cells and activated T cells. PD -
L1 binding to B7.1 on T cells and antigen- presenting cells can mediate downregulation of 
immune responses, including inhibition of T -cell activation and cytokine production 15,16. 
Overexpression of PD -L1 on tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment has been 
reported to prevent anti -tumor immunity, resulting in immune evasion 17. Therefore, 
interruption of the PD -L1/PD -[ADDRESS_982031], 
potentially avoiding effects on immune homoeostasis. Atezolizumab is approved in the 
[LOCATION_002] metastatic NSCLC that has progressed during or following treatment with a 
platinum -containing regimen.  
 
1.3 Ramucirumab

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  and VEGF receptor -2 (VEGFR- 2)-mediated 
signaling and angiogenesis contribute to the pathogenesis of lung cancer. In patients with 
lung cancer, circulating VEGF levels are associated with increased tumor aggr essiveness 
and r educed survival 19. Furthermore, high levels of VEGF in preclinical models reduced 
the T cell progenitors in the thymus 20, and exposur e to VEGF led to decreased number, 
activity and cytotoxic activity of T cells ex vivo in a VEGFR -2 dependent mechanism 21. 
Blocking VEGF receptor -mediated signaling abrogated VEGF’s suppressive effects on T -
cells in preclinical models and VEGFR -[ADDRESS_982032] changed advanced NSCLC treatment, only a small percentage achieve 
a sustained benefit. Furthermore, efficacy from additional therapy is limited 27. While the 
lack of response to ICBs is likely multifactorial, an important factor in achieving a response 
with anti -PD-1/PD -L1 blockade is the presence of T cells entering the tumor to kill the 
tumo r cells once their defense is removed. Unfortunately, tumors often inhibit T -cell 
trafficking to the tumor via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -mediated down-
regulation of important adhesion molecules on tumor -associated blood vessels and failure 
to respond to ICBs has been associated with decreased tumor -infiltrating immune cells [ADDRESS_982033] may enhance T -cell function in the tumor 
microenvironment 34. Indeed, use of immunotherapy and anti -angiogenesis therapy in 
melanoma also increased CD8+ T -cell infiltration in tumors 31. Together, this data suggests 
that combining ramucirumab with immunotherapy in NSCLC patients who have 
previously received ICBs may be more effective than traditional therapy. We propose a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_719617] -stage NSCLC patients previously treated with ICB. 
 
1.5 Correlative Studies Background  
 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_719618] -1/PD -L1 antagonists for patients with NSCLC, the exact 
molecular mechanisms that mediate disease response remai n poorly understood 35.  It is 
clear that PD -1-directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_719619] 8 of 41 
 of CD8+ T -cells in the periphery of patients  36-38, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the majority of patients 
will not derive meaningful benefit from this class of agents, and responses are often not 
durable.  Blunting tumor angiogenesis in order to remodel the tumor microenvironment is 
an attractive combinatorial approa ch to synergize with standard immunoncology agents 39.  
Increased VEGF expression is known to suppress the maturation of antigen -presenting 
dendritic cells and inhibit lymphocyte tracking into tumor tissues, which can limit the 
effectiveness of an antitumor adaptive immune response 40.  We hypothesize that the 
addition of ramucirumab will augment the clinical activity of atezolizumab, and in order 
to evaluate the exact mechanism of action of the combination, we propose a comprehensive 
analysis of paired peripheral blood samples collected longi tudinally during this study.  We 
will evaluate whether the combination of atezolizumab and ramucirumab (a) alters 
populations of circulating monocytes and myeloid derived suppressor cells, (b) increases 
the number and affects the phenotype of circulating N K cells, effector CD8+ and effector 
CD4+ T -cell subsets, (c) results in the generation of durable populations of memory CD8+ 
and CD4+ T -cells and (d) alters the ratio of circulating regulatory T -cells to effector CD8+ 
cells.  We will utilize mass cytometry  (CyTOF) for these analyses, a high dimensional 
technique that allows the assessment of ~[ADDRESS_982034] and cryopreserve 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to combination atezolizumab/ramucirumab 
therapy and again at the time of first radiographic a ssessment. Analyses will be completed 
in a batched fashion using an established mass cytometry panel at the The Andrew M. and 
Jane M. Bursky Center for Human Immunology & Immunotherapy Programs (CHiiPs)  at 
Washington University School of Medicine at the conclusion of study procedures to 
correlate immune profiles with clinical response.  Patients will also undergo repeated 
biopsy to evaluate the differences in immune cell infiltrates between baseline and after two 
cycles of treatment.    
 
1.6 Amendment #[ADDRESS_982035]- line setting.  
  
The study design uses a Simon’s two -stager MiniMax desi gn where 12 patients are 
enrolled into the stage I. In case of one or more responses, the study will accrue 9 
more patients, with a total of 4 responders indicating the preliminary evidence of 
efficacy.  
  
Page 9 of 41 
 Although there were no responses among the initial  12 patients, 8 patients had 
tumor reduction from baseline, including patient reaching 27% reduction, only 3% 
below the threshold for the RECIST criteria for response. Furthermore, the 
treatment has been well tolerated and 3 out of the 12 patients (25%) ar e still on 
treatment with progression -free survival higher than 6 months.  
  
Therefore, we believe that the study should continue with the accrual of the 
additional 9 patients with the primary endpoint remaining the overall response rate.  
In this case, the Minimax design will be replaced by a simple enrollment of 21 
patients.

infusion may be delivered over 30 minutes (+/ - 10 minutes). 
 
Ramucirumab and atezolizumab may be given in any order on treatment days. 
 
5.[ADDRESS_982052] not had any disease assessment.  
 
5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.3.1 Ramucirumab  
 
Patients may not be receiving chronic antiplatelet therapy, including aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], 
nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, including ibuprofen, naproxen, 
and others), dipyridamole or clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745], or similar agents.  Once- daily aspi[INVESTIGATOR_34308] 
(maximum dose 325 mg/day) is permitted. 
 
Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated 
symptomatically with diphenhydramine, and/or cimetidine or another  H2 receptor 
antagonist, as per  standard practice ( for sites outside the [LOCATION_002], equivalent 
medications may be substituted per local practice).  
Page [ADDRESS_982053]  will be  administered daily for 7 days , starting 6 days prior to treatment  
with the final dose on Day 7, per the treating physician’s discretion.  
 
5.3.2 Atezolizumab  
 
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medications or over the counter 
preparat ions used by a patient between the 7 days preceding the screening 
evaluation and the treatment discontinuation visit.  
 
Patients who experience infusion -associated symptoms may be treated 
symptomatically with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, diphenhydramine, and/or 
cimetidine or another  H2 receptor antagonist, as per  standard practice (for sites 
outside the [LOCATION_002], equivalent medications may be substituted per local 
practice). Serious infusion associated events manifested by [CONTACT_27926], hypotension, 
wheezi ng, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_719620] ( e.g., 
supplemental oxygen and β 2-adrenergic agonists ). 
 
Systemic corticosteroids and TNF α inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab but may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating physician. If feasible, alternatives to corticosteroids should 
be considered. Premedication may be administered for Cycles ≥2 at the discretion 
of the treating physician. The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids 
(e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency is allowed. Megestrol administered as appetit e stimulant is acceptable 
while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
 
Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone -replacement therapy, prophylactic 
or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low -molecular -weight heparin or 
warfarin  at a stable  dose level), or other allowed maintenance therapy should 
continue their use. Females of reproductive potential should use highly effective 
means of contraception.  
 
It is strongly recommended that:  
• Traditional herbal medicines not be administered because the ingredients of 
many herbal medicines are not fully studied and their use may result in 
unanticipated drug- drug interactions that may cause, or confound 
assessment  of, toxicity.  
• The use of a RANKL inhibitor (denosumab) be discontinued during the 
study; this  agent could potentially alter the activity and the safety of 
atezolizumab.  
 
Page 16 of 41 
 Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimulatory agents, including, but not 
limited to, IFN -α, IFN -γ, or IL -2, during the entire study. These agents, in 
combination with atez olizumab, could potentially increase  the risk for autoimmune 
conditions.  
 
Patients should also not be receiving immunosuppressive medications, including, 
but not limited to, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide. 
These agents could potentially  alter the activity and the safety of atezolizumab. 
Systemic co rticosteroids and anti -TNFα agents may attenuate potential beneficial 
immunologic effects of treatment with atezolizumab but may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating phy sician. If feasible, alternatives to these agents should 
be considered. 
 
In addition, all patients (including those who discontinue the study early) should 
not receive other immunostimulatory agents for [ADDRESS_982054] dose of 
atezolizumab . 
 
5.4 Women of Childbearing Potential  
 
Women of childbearing potential (defined as women with regular menses, women  with 
amenorrhea, women with irregular cycles, women using a contraceptive method that 
precludes withdrawal bleeding , and w omen who have had a tubal ligation ) are required to 
have a negative serum pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_982055] day of study treatment .   
 
Female and male patients (along with their female partners) are required to use two forms 
of acceptable contraception, including one barrier method, during participation in the study 
and for [ADDRESS_982056] be notified in 
order to facilitate outcome follow -up. 
 
5.5 Duration of Therapy  
 
If at any time the constraints of this protocol are considered to be detrimental to the 
patient’s health and/or the patient no longer wishes to c ontinue protocol therapy, the 
protocol therapy should be discontinued and the reason(s) for discontinuation documented 
in the case report forms.  
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies:  
 
Page 17 of 41 
 • Documented and confirmed disease progression  
• Death  
• Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment  of the investigator, may cause severe or 
permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug 
• General or specific changes in the  patient’s condition render the patient unable to 
receive further treatment in the judgment  of the investigator  
• Suspected pregnancy  
• Serious non- compliance with the study protocol  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Patient withdraws consent  
• Investigator removes the patient from study  
• The Siteman Cancer Center decides to close the study  
 
Patients who prematurely discontinue treatment for any reason will be followed as 
indicated in the study calendar .

8.0 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
8.1 Ramucirumab (Cyramza)  
 
8.1.[ADDRESS_982069] that 
specifically binds VEGF Receptor 2 and blocks binding of VEGFR ligands, VEGF -
Page 22 of 41 
 A, VEGF -C, and VEGF -D. As a res ult, ramucirumab inhibits ligand -stimulated 
activation of VEGF Receptor 2, thereby [CONTACT_328797]- induced proliferation, 
and migration of human endothelial cells. Ramucirumab inhibited angiogenesis in 
an in vivo animal model. 
 
8.1.3 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of ramucirumab are similar for patients 
with gastric cancer, NSCLC, and mCRC based on a population PK analysis. The 
mean (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) clearance for ramucirumab was 0.015 
L/hour (30% ) and the mean terminal half -life was 14 days (20%).  
 
8.1.4 Supplier  
  
Ramucirumab is an investigational agent for this trial and will be supplied by 
[CONTACT_719627], free of charge to the patient.  
 
8.1.5 Dosage Form and Preparation  
 
Ramucirumab is available in two dose strengths:  
• 100 mg/10 mL (10 mg per mL) solution, single dose vial  
• 500 mg/50 mL (10 mg per mL) solution, single dose vial  
 
8.1.6 Storage and Stability  
 
Store vials in a refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) until time of use. Keep the 
vial in the outer c arton in order to protect from light.  
 
8.1.7 Administration  
 
Calculate the dose and the required volume of ramucirumab needed to prepare the 
infusion solution. Vials contain either 100 mg/10 mL or 500 mg/50 mL at a 
concentration of 10 mg/mL solution of ramucirumab.  
 
Withdraw the required volume of ramucirumab and f urther dilute with only 0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection in an intravenous infusion container to a final volume 
of 250 mL. Do not use dextrose containing solutions.  
 
Gently invert the container to ensure adequate mixing.  
 
DO NOT FREEZE OR SHAKE the infusion solution. DO NOT dilute with other 
solutions or co- infuse with other electrolytes or medications.  
 
Store diluted infusion for no more than 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) or 4 
hours at room temperature (below 25°C [77°F]).

solution.  
 
Administer diluted ramucirumab infusion via infusion pump over 60 minutes 
through a separate infusion line. Use of a protein sparing 0.22 micron filter is 
recommended. Flush the line with sterile sodium chloride (0.9%) solution for 
injection at the end of the infusion.  
 
8.2 Atezolizumab (Tecentriq ) 
 
8.2.1 Description  
 
Atezolizumab is a human monoclonal antibody based on a human IgG1 framework 
containing heavy chain VHIII and light chain V κI subgroup sequences. The 
recombinant antibody consists of two heavy chains (448 amino acid residues each) 
and two light chains (214 amino acid residues each) with inter-  and intra -chain 
disulfide bonds that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_401342]1 antibodies. Atezolizumab incorporates an 
amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 in the CH2 domain 
of each heavy chain resulting in a non- glycosylated antibody that has minimal 
binding to Fcγ receptors and, consequently, prevents Fc -effector function and 
depletion of cells expressing PD -L1 at expected concentrations in humans. 
Therefore, atezolizumab lacks the N -linked oli gosaccharides typi[INVESTIGATOR_719622]- derived monoclonal antibodies.  
 
8.2.2 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism  
 
On the basis of available preliminary PK data (0.03− 20 mg/kg), atezolizumab 
appeared to show linear pharmacokinetics at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg. For  the 1- mg/kg and 
20-mg/kg dose groups, the mean apparent CL and the mean Vss had a range of 3.20 
to 4.44 mL/day/kg and 48.1 to 65.7 mL/kg, respectively, which is consistent with 
the expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in humans. 
 
8.2.3 Supplier(s)

11.1 Adverse Event Collection in the Case Report Forms  
 
All adverse events that occur beginning with start of treatment (minus exceptions defined 
in Section 1.0) must be captured in the Toxicity Form.  Baseline AEs should be captured 
on the Medical History Form.  
 
Participant death due to disease progression should be reported on the Toxicity Form as 
grade 5 disease progress ion.  If death is due to an AE (e.g. cardiac disorders: cardiac arrest), 
report as a grade [ADDRESS_982079] – Solid Tumors  
 
For the purposes of this study, patients should be re -evaluated for response every 6  weeks.  
In addition to a baseline scan, confirmatory scans should also be obtained not less than 4 
weeks following initial documentation of objective response.  
 
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIST) 
guideline (version 1.1) [Eur J Ca 45:228- 247, 2009].  Changes in the largest diameter 
(unidim ensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case 
of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
 
12.2 Disease Parameters  
 
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately 
measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_982080] 
x-ray, as >[ADDRESS_982081] scan, or >[ADDRESS_982082] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Page 27 of 41 
  
Malignant l ymph nodes :  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_982083] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis wi ll be measured and followed.  
 
Non-measurable disease:   All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), 
are considered non -measurable disease.  Bone lesion s, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, 
and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria  for radiographically defined simple cysts should 
not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) since 
they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.  
 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-
cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.  
 
Target lesions:  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions 
and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of 
their size (lesions with the longest diameter ), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  
It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible 
measurement in which cir cumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured 
reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, 
short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum diamet ers.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short 
axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further 
characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
 
Non-target lesions :  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions 
over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not requi red, but the 
presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted 
throughout follow -up.  
 
12.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or caliper s.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of 
treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
 
Page 28 of 41 
 The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being 
followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ 10 mm diameter as assessed 
using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3977], including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
Chest x -ray:  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are 
clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT  and MRI:   This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT 
scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_982084] 
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be 
twice the sli ce thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).   
 
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
greatly impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the 
availability of MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical 
specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the 
type and site of disease.  Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the 
same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific 
MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed 
as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body sc ans should be performed with breath -hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  
 
PET- CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined 
PET- CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST 
measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -
CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then 
the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used 
interchangeably w ith conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  
Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias 
an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable 
disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may 
be a side effect of t he treatment) and progressive disease.  
 
FDG -PET:   While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
Page [ADDRESS_982085] scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis 
of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
 
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion.  
• No FDG- PET at baseline and a po sitive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT  scans are n eeded to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the 
initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of disease on CT that is not pro gressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent 
fibrosis or scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623] -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both 
approaches may lead to false positive CR due to limitations of FDG- PET and 
biopsy resolution/sensitivity.  
  
Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG -PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake 
greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.  
 
12.4 Response Criteria  
 
12.4.1 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 
mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of  
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the 
baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 
20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  
the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).   
 
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither suf ficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on 
study.  
 
Page 30 of 41 
 12.4.2 Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
 
Complete Response (CR):   Disappearance of all non -target lesions and 
normalizat ion of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological 
in size (<10 mm short axis).  
 
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
 
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits. 
 
Progressive Disease (PD):   Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non- target lesions.  Un equivocal progression 
should not normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall 
disease status change, not a single lesion increase.     
 
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1101] t he treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the 
progression status should be confirmed in 4-[ADDRESS_982086] response recorded from the start of the 
treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The 
patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measure ment and confirmation criteria.

 ***        If the patient is clinically stable, treatment may continue with repeated scans in 4 weeks to 
rule out ps eudoprogression 
****  In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be 
accepted as disease progression.  
Note:  Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring disc ontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic 
deterioration.”  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment.

*  ‘Non -CR/non -PD’ is preferred over ‘stable disease’ for non -target disease since SD is 
increasingly used as an endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this 
category when no lesions can be measured is not advised  
  
12.4.4 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:   The duration of overall response is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented 
(taking as reference for progressive d isease the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first 
met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.   
 
Duration of s table disease:   Stable disease is measured from the start of the 
treatment until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline 
measurements.

12.4.6 Response Review  
 
It is strongly recommended that all responses be reviewed by [CONTACT_13461](s) 
independent of the study at the study’s completion.  Simultaneous review of the 
patients’ files and radiological images is the best approach.

14.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATI ONS  
 
14.1 Objective s and Endpoints  
 
The primary objective of this study is to determine the overall response rate (ORR) for the 
combination of ramucirumab and atezol izumab in patients with NSCLC who have 
previously received an ICB.   
 
The secondary objectives  include  
Page 33 of 41 
 • To determine the overall survival (OS) for the combination of ramucirumab and 
atezol izumab in patients with NSCLC who have previously received an ICB . 
• To determine the progression- free survival (PFS) for the combination of ramucirumab 
and atezol izumab in patients with NSCLC who have previously received an ICB .  
• To determine clinical benefit rate (CBR) for the combination of ramucirumab and 
atezol izumab in patients with NSCLC who have previously received an ICB .  CBR is 
defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved responses or stable disease.  
• To evaluate toxicity and tolerability of this combination as measured by [CONTACT_12134] -CTCAE 
version 5.0.  
 
The exploratory objectives include  
• To explore the relationship of the immunophenotype of peripheral bl ood immune 
cells and response to combined therapy. 
• To explore the changes in tumor immune cell infiltrate after treatment and 
relationship with response.   
 
14.2 Study Design 
 
This single institution study will be designed using Simon’s two- stage MiniMax design.  
We plan to enroll twenty -one (21) a dvanced -stage NSCLC patients.  
 
Assuming a null hypothesis of ORR less than 5% in this setting, we hypothesize that ORR 
of 20% or higher warrants further investigation. A total number of 21 patients allows an 
80% power at  1-sided alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_982088] the expected difference. If 4 or more responders 
are observed at the end of the trial, we would conclude that there is preliminary evidence 
for efficacy warranting further investigation.  
 
14.3 Data Analysis  
 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the sample, as well as toxicity by [CONTACT_719628]. Overall response rate 
(ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) will be evaluated using the RECIST 1.1 c riteria 
according to investigator’s assessment, and their 1 -side 90% confidence intervals will also 
be calculated. Kaplan -Meier product limit estimator will be used to describe the 
distribution of overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS). The association 
between response and the immunophenotype of peripheral blood immune cells will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Although data analysis will be primarily 
descriptive, permutation test will be used to rank the strength of associati on.   Specifically,  
we first compute the observed test statistics for the differences between responders and 
non-responders. Then the null distribution of the test statistics will be generated by 
[CONTACT_719629] g 10,[ADDRESS_982089] statistics.  Similar analysis will be performed for the association 
between response and the changes in tumor immune ce ll infiltrate after treatment.

 APPENDIX B: Definitions for Adverse Event Reporting  
 
A. Adverse Events (AEs)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition: any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in human s, 
whether or not considered drug- related . 
 
Grading:  the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 .0 will be utilized for all toxicity reporting .  A 
copy of the CTCAE version 5.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website.  
 
Attribution (relatedness), Expectedness, and Seriousness:  the definitions for the terms 
listed that should be used are those provided by [CONTACT_9092]’ 
Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP).  A copy of this guidance can be found on 
OHRP’s website:  
http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html  
 
B. Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR)  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition: any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused 
the adverse event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  “Suspected adverse reaction” implies a 
lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adve rse event 
caused by a drug. 
 
C. Life-Threatening Adverse Event / Life Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  any adverse drug event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life-
threatening” if, in the view of t he investigator , its occurrence places the patient  at immediate 
risk of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction  that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
D.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction  
 
As defined in 21 CFR 312.32:  
 
Definition:  an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the 
view of the investigator, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
o Death  
o A life -threatening adverse event  
Page [ADDRESS_982096] 
normal life functions  
o A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
o Any ot her important medical event that does not fit the criteria above but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above  
 
For the purposes of this  protocol , the following events are also defined as a SAE : 
o Any venous or arterial event leading to discontinuation of ramucirumab therapy  
o Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome of any grade  
 
E. Protocol Exceptions  
 
Definition: A planned change in the conduct of the research for one participant.  
 
F. Deviation  
 
Definition: Any alteration or modification to the IRB -approved research without prospective 
IRB approval.  The term “research” encompasses all IRB -approved materials and documents 
including the detailed protocol, IRB application, consent form, recruitment materials, 
questionnaires/data collection forms, and any other information relating to the research study.  
 
A minor or administrative deviation is one that does not have the potential to negatively impact 
the rights, safety, or welfare of participants or others or th e scientific validity of the study.  
 
A major deviation is one that does have the potential to negatively impact the rights, safety, or 
welfare of participants or others or the scientific validity of the study.

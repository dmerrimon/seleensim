Title : The efficacy of ultrasound guided glenohumeral joint injections of platelet rich plasma 
(PRP) versus hyaluronic acid (HA) in the treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis: A 
randomized, double -blind control trial  
Principal Investigat or: Jonathan Kirschner, MD  
Condition or Intervention to be studied : Treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) with a 
single injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) or platelet -rich plasma (PRP).  
Research questions/specific aims : This study aimed to determine  whether HA or PRP can 
decrease  pain, restore function, and improve disability  in patients suffering from chronic 
glenohumeral OA (both primary and secondary) that is refractory to conservative management 
(including corticosteroid injections).   
Hypothesis : PRP injections are more efficacious than HA injections in patients with chronic 
glenohumeral OA.  
Primary outcome : Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) score, assessed  at baseline and 
up to [ADDRESS_976899] -injection  
Secondary outcomes :  
1. American Shoul der and Elbow Surgeons Society Standardized Shoulder Assessment 
Form (ASES ; assessed at baseline and up to [ADDRESS_976900] -injection ) 
2. Current numerical rating scale pain score  (assessed at baseline and up to [ADDRESS_976901] -
injection)  
3. Average numerical rating scale pain score  (assessed at baseline and up to [ADDRESS_976902] -
injection)  
4. Patient satisfaction (assessed up to [ADDRESS_976903] -injection)  
5. Side effects (assessed up to [ADDRESS_976904] -injection)  
Background :  
Shoulder pain is common, making up 16% of all musculoskeletal complaints,1,2,3 with a lifetime 
prevalence as high as 50%.4,5,[ADDRESS_976905] costs of 7 billion US dollars reported 
in the year 2000.3 The management and course of patients who present with shoulder pain to a 
primary care physician is concerning, with only 50% reporting full re solution in 6 months, 
increasing to only 60% after 1 year.11-14 Causes of shoulder pain include glenohumeral 
osteoarthritis, subacromial bursitis, trauma, rotator cuff tear, instability, adhesive capsulitis, or 
labral pathology. Risk factors include advanc ed age, history of trauma or instability, rheumatoid 
arthritis, female sex, and occupations or sports involving repetitive movements of the upper 
extremity.  
Glenohumeral OA involves degeneration of the glenoid and humeral articular surfaces, 
associated wi th osteophyte formation, subchondral bony changes, and synovitis.15 It accounts for 
approximately 2 -5% of all chronic shoulder pain and has an increased risk among the elderly, 
patients with a history of glenohumeral subluxation, and those who participate in sports such as 
swimming, tennis, baseball, or volleyball.3 It may be classified into primary and secondary 
forms. Primary glenohumeral OA causes include degenerative joint disease, inflammatory 
arthropathies such as rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthriti s, rotator cuff tear arthropathy (CTA), 
and neuropathic arthropathy secondary to syringomyelia or diabetes.16-18 Secondary causes 
include trauma, postoperative changes  after arthroscopy or capsulog raphy, and osteonecrosis due 
to underlying systemic problem s such as chronic steroid or alcohol exposure.16  
Hyaluronic acid (HA), or hyaluronate, is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan, found in 
synovial joint fluid, with viscoelastic, chondroprotective, and possible anti -inflammatory 
properties.[ADDRESS_976906] a total of 3 weekly HA injections to either the subacromial space or glenohumeral 
joint, when compared to no control group or placebo improved pain and range of motion for 3 to 
6 months.20-25  However, there continues to be inconsistency i n the literature in terms of 
recruitment, sample size, injection technique, whether or not image guidance was used, and what 
type of hyaluronate was used.  
Platelet rich plasma (PRP) injections involve the use of a patient’s own platelets to take 
advantage of autologous blood growth factors present to promote tissue regeneration. It is more 
widely used for the treatment of tendinopathies and popular among injured athletes,[ADDRESS_976907] on chronic glenohumeral osteoarthritis (both primary and secondary).29-32 
To our knowledge, no study in the literature has  been conducted that compares the efficacy of 
ultrasound guided PRP and HA injections with ultrasound guidance  in the treatment of chronic 
glenohumeral arthroses.

Study procedures : 
1. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to  the ultrasound -guided glenohumeral HA 
alone or PRP injection treatment group. Prior to injection, patie nts will be asked to 
discontinue any anti -inflammatory medications for 5 days prior to treatment.  
a. HA group will receive one 6 mL injection of low molecular weight (average 
500,000 -730,000 dalton) HA preparation, Hyalgan (Fidia Farmaceutici S.p.A., 
Abano T erme, Italy). Needle guidance and injection will be performed under 
ultrasound to the affected glenohumeral joint, post erior approach, by a fellowship -
trained physician. The syringe will be covered with an opaque shield to blind both 
the patient and treati ng physician.  
b. PRP group will undergo the same above procedure as the HA group in respect to 
ultrasound guidance, anatomic approach, and double blinding. The Harvest 
Technologies Corporation (Plymouth, MA) SmartPReP Clear PRP preparation kit 
and machine wil l be used to prepare the samples in accordance with manufacturer 
instructions. Venipuncture and blood collection, PRP centrifuge, final PRP 
preparation, and covering of the syringe with an opaque shield will be performed 
in a sterile manner by a trained st udy team member not involved in the direct care 
and management of the study subjects. Final PRP samples will aim to be 
leukocyte reduced.  Prior to injection, each sample in the PRP group will be sent to 
the laboratory for hemoglobin / hematocrit, WBC, and platelet counts.  [ADDRESS_976913] procedure:  
a. Patients will be instructed to take acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours 
(maximum of 3 gms) for pain relief as needed.  
b. Ice applied over the affected joint will not be allowed for [ADDRESS_976914] -
injection.  
Sample size analysis and sta tistical analysis plan : 
Proposed analysis: Two -way repeated measures ANOVA  
Alpha level: 0.05  
Beta or power level: 0.861  
Primary outcome variable estimate: SPADI  
Number of groups being compared: [ADDRESS_976915] size or change expected between groups: 10 -point chan ge (±15)  
Resulting number per group: 30  
Total sample size required: 70  
 
Descriptive analyses of the patient population will include reporting means (with standard 
deviations) for continuous variables and frequencies (with percentages) for discrete variable s.  
Prior to initiation of inferential analyses, data will be evaluated for completeness and, for 
continuous measures, normality. Comparative differences between the study groups will be 
evaluated using independent samples t -test for continuous variables a nd chi -square/Fisher’s exact 
test for categorical variables. This will include comparisons of patient characteristics as well as 
baseline patient reported outcomes and all range of motion measures. Factors that do not meet 
the assumption of normality will be analyzed using the non -parametric equivalents.  
The primary outcome in this study is the total SPADI score and the longitudinal assessment of 
that score over four follow -up time points after baseline. A systematic review by [CONTACT_716811] 
(Arthritis Rheum, 20 09) found that the minimal clinical important difference (MCID) for 
patients with general shoulder pain ranged between 8 and 13 points. Williams et al. (J 
Rheumatol, 1995) found that changes in the SPADI score between +[ADDRESS_976916] of intra -articular corticosteroids and 
supervised physiotherapy, Carette et al. (Arthriti s & Rheumatism, 2003)  used a [ADDRESS_976917] a similar 10 -point change between treatment groups in the total SPADI scores.  
Group sample sizes of 25 patients in each treatment group of the study will achieve 86% power 
to detect an MCID of [ADDRESS_976918] deviation of ±[ADDRESS_976919] for any loss  of patients  due to early withdrawal, 
we will increase our sample size by 20% for group sample sizes of [ADDRESS_976920] for any effects of potential confounding from age, sex, and other factors. 
Longitudinal assessment of the other patient reported outcomes wi ll also be evaluated using 
similar statistical models.

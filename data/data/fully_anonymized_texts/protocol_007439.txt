Summary:  
Up to 77% of young people with severe mental illnesses smoke [1-4], a rate that is up to five times 
higher  than the rate of daily smoking in other young adults [5, 6] .  Contrary to popular belief, 
smoking toba cco does not  provide any benefit for mental illness symptom control [7]. People with 
severe mental illnesses (SMI: schizophrenia and severe mood disorders) are dying, on average, 25 
years earlier  than those without SMI [8, 9] .  Much of this early mortality is  due to higher rates of 
heart and lung diseases, cancers, strokes, and diabetes [8-14].  
Cessation of smok ing in these transition -age young adults can prevent cancer and increase life 
expectancy to that of non -smokers [15] .  Combination treatments are effective in this group [16-21] 
and therefore key to improving outcomes, but few SMI smokers use them [22-25] despi[INVESTIGATOR_332042] [26] .  Motivational interventions for cessation increase interest in quitting [24, 
27, 28] , but pub lic mental health clinicians do not deliver them  [23, 29, 30] , in part due to economic 
reasons  [31, 32] .  Thus cost effective methods to deliver motivational interventions to e ngage 
young smokers with SMI into treatment are needed.  
To address this gap, we have developed an electronic decision support system  (EDSS) for smoking 
cessation that is specifically tailored for smokers with SMI, who tend to have cognitive deficits and 
limited computer experience [34].  Similar to  
EDSSs developed for other health problems [3 9], this EDSS provides information and moti vational 
exercises within an easy -to-use, web -based computer program that can be used with minimal or no 
staff assistance .  Initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_332043] -aged  SMI smokers showed excellent usability 
and promising efficacy [33] .  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -testing among young patients suggested that the EDSS increased 
motivation to quit smoking and  provided direction to adapt the format and content of the EDSS for 
young SMI smokers . 
The purpose of this proposal is to further develop the motivational decision support system and to 
test its ability to motivate young smokers with SMI to quit smoking wi th cessation treatment .   
 
The study aims are:  
Aim 1. To identify beliefs related to: cessation treatment, social norms for cessation treatment, and 
perceptions of behavioral control regarding cessation treatment, among young smokers with SMI.  
Aim 2.  To adapt and complete the development of an EDSS for young smokers with SMI by [CONTACT_332056] 1.  
Aim 3.   To conduct usability testing of the new EDSS in young smokers with SMI.  
Aim 4. To pi[INVESTIGATOR_21087], us ing a small randomized, controlled trial, the ability of the new EDSS to change 
treatment beliefs and to engage young smokers with SMI into cessation treatment. We will also 
recruit a minimal assessment control group.

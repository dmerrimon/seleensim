It is anticipated that this study will involve up to 4 scheduled visits:

•Visit 1:   Dispensing of Pair 1 (Day 0)
•Visit 2:  One -week follow -up of Pair 1 (-1/+4 days) and Dispensing of Pair 2

4 Ethics Review / Statement of Compliance  
4.1 Relevant Standards / Guidelines 
This implementation document  has been developed in accordance with the following:  
•ISO [ZIP_CODE] Clinical Investigation of Medical Devices for Human Subjects
•ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice
•Declaration of Helsinki
4.[ADDRESS_615833] regulations (U.S. 
21CFR Part 56.103) or applicable IEC regulations. Copi[INVESTIGATOR_28078]/IEC correspondence with the investigator/sponsor will be kept on file.

ersion 1.1: CV -17-29 v 3.1: 27-Mar -[ADDRESS_615835] lenses and/or different lens care products at no cost to them.  
This study is considered to be a non- significant risk study based on United State Food and Drug 
admini stration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines due to the daily 
wear nature of the study.  The risks to the subjects are also reduced based on the results of previous cytoxicity testing.  
Complicati
ons that may occur during the wearing of contact [CONTACT_479600], dryness, 
aching or itching eyes, excessive tearing, discharge, hyperemia and variable or blurred vision. More serious risks may include photophobia, iritis, corneal edema or eye infection. Although contact [CONTACT_13293]- related infections are very infrequent, the possibility does exist.  The incidence of 
infection due to day -wear soft lenses is 0.035%. Almost always an infection will occur only in one 
eye.  This risk is assumed by 35- million Americans who currently wear  contact [CONTACT_13276].  
Routine clini
cal procedures including auto -refraction, auto -keratometry, visual acuity, anterior 
ocular health assessment, and contact [CONTACT_479601]. In addition, high magnification imaging of the lens fit may be made using 35 mm or digital  cameras, in vivo confocal microscopy, 
and/or specular microscopy.

9 Device Malfunctions  
A device malfunction means the failure of the device to meet its performance specification or 
otherwise perform as intended. Any defective lens  that is likely to cause or contribute to a Serious 
Adverse Event should be reported to the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_223988] 24 hours

comfort, vision, or lens handling. Responses to these subjective questionnaires will not be 
considered as complaints or Device Malfunctions.  
10 Statistical Analysis 
10.1 Statistical analysis 
Summary statistics will be produced (e.g. mean, standard deviation). Paired t -test or two sample t -
test w ill be used to compare slit lamp biomicroscopy, lens fit and subjective scores between study 
lens types.  Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or paired analysis will be used to compare the variables between study timepoints . The critical alpha level for statistical significance 
will be set at p ≤ 0.05, with adjustment for multiple comparisons.  
An early r
ead  of performance variables (interim data) will be taken prior and a report produced 
prior to completion of the study.     
All partic
ipants who were evaluated will be used in the analysis. In the event of missing data, 
individual data points will be excluded in the analysis and not extrapolated from the collected data.

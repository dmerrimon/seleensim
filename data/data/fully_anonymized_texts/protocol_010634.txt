Page 5 of 321. Objectives
The long-term goal of the study is to mitigate the spread of the pandemic in miners, a 
population of high-risk, rural essential workers who are susceptible and vulnerable to COVID-
19, partly based on exposure to particulate air pollution, and who are predominantly 
racial/ethnic minorities in New Mexico (NM) (3, 11). The study objective is to provide proof-
of-principle for frequent point-of-care molecular testing as a workplace surveillance tool to 
monitor and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_334799] risk factors for the virus. The site of 
molecular surveillance (intervention site) will be a surface coal mine in McKinley County, 
NM, located just outside the Eastern Agency of the Navajo Nation, comprised of 66% minority 
miners. This site offers a unique opportunity for a community-based study of SARS–CoV-2 
infection in this population. Miners at the intervention site will provide nasal swabs before 
beginning their work shift on alternate days that will be analyzed with a ‘screening’ molecular 
test (12). This test is ideal because it is low cost, simple, portable, point-of-care, rapid, and can 
be performed by [CONTACT_273947]-infrastructure settings. The control 
site is a similar coal mine in Campbell County, Wyoming (WY). Both mines, operated by [CONTACT_273948], have similar engineering, administrative, and personal protective measures in 
place. The rationale for this study is to establish the suitability of longitudinal molecular 
surveillance to prevent and control SARS–CoV-2 infection in this unique population by 
[CONTACT_273949].
Specific Aim 1: To determine the acceptance rate to frequent point-of-care molecular 
workplace surveillance among miners. Hypothesis 1: Miners will have a cumulative 
acceptance rate of frequent testing at ≥85%, with the added objective of exploring difference 
in acceptance by [CONTACT_273950]. 
Specific Aim 2: To determine the ability to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_334800] surveillance in a real-world setting of miners. 
Hypothesis 2: The sensitivity of the screening test in a real-world study setting is a) 
comparable to that described by [CONTACT_273951], and b) positively associated 
with viral load in upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_153194] (latter measured in nose and nasopharynx 
using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR). 
Specific Aim 3: To determine the effectiveness and implementation costs of frequent point-
of-care molecular workplace surveillance on reducing incident infection rates of SARS-CoV-
2.
Hypothesis 3A: Frequent point-of-care molecular testing over up to twelve months in the 
intervention mine will result in lower incident seropositivity rates compared to the control 
mine. Hypothesis 3B: Frequent point-of-care molecular surveillance in the intervention mine 
is cost-effective compared to the control mine.
Specific Aim 4: To determine novel predictive factors associated with incident 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, tests, and vaccination in miners. Hypothesis 4A: Miners with 
incident infection demonstrate less frequent use of cloth face-coverings outside the 
workplace, greater mine dust exposure intensity, presence of dust-related lung

and vaccine uptake by [CONTACT_273952].
Hypothesis 4B involves a separate but related study, titled “Facilitators and barriers for 
COVID-[ADDRESS_334801] (Assaf/Sood, Co-PIs; NIH 1U23MD016258-[ADDRESS_334802])”. The objective is to determine facilitators 
and barriers to COVID-[ADDRESS_334803] of the latter on vaccine uptake, at a 
surface coal mine. This study involves the administration of a questionnaire once between 6 
and 12 months time point.  
2. Background
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by [CONTACT_144878][INVESTIGATOR_7686]-
related coronavirus-2 (SARS–CoV-2) infection, is a novel disease, frequently transmitted at 
the workplace. Rural workers are increasingly affected, particularly racial/ethnic minorities (1-
3). In New Mexico (NM), a rural, minority-majority, and medically underserved state, the 
greatest impact from COVID-19 is seen in McKinley County, in and around the Navajo Nation. 
The high risk of infection in minority communities could be due to genetic factors, 
immunological differences, social determinants of health (4), comorbidities, and/or high 
prevalence of concomitant co-exposures (1, 5, 6), in alignment with COVID-19 known risk 
factors (7-10). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_273933], meatpackers, and cruise ship 
workers, there are limited studies on the spread of SARS–CoV-[ADDRESS_334804] be addressed to develop 
and implement novel pandemic strategies to keep rural minority essential workplaces open, 
particularly in environments such as coal mines, which are unable to use physical distancing, 
flexible schedules, or telecommuting interventions (3).
Scientific Premise
Essential workers: An 
estimated 15 million US 
workers provide essential 
services during the pandemic. 
‘Essential’ services are 
deemed critical to societal 
infrastructure and are crucial 
for rural economies. Initial 
reports have highlighted the 
risk imposed on health care 
workers during the pandemic. 
However, essential work 
extends beyond health care. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_273934], many rural workers 
have not been adequately 
tested and studied for SARS-
CoV-2 infection (13). Miners 
are rural essential workers with Table 1: SARS-CoV-2 infection vulnerability and susceptibility 
factors in miners
Vulnerable workers: Workers at 
higher risk due to the greater 
likelihood of increased exposureSusceptible workers: Workers at 
higher risk (or worse outcomes) at any 
level of exposure
Hazardous work characteristics: 
Exposure to infected aerosols 
amongst essential workers 
unable to work from home
Enclosed, or poorly ventilated 
workplaces; difficulty 
distancing from virus-laden 
aerosols
Prolonged and close face-to-
face or physical contact 
Lack of access to flexible work 
scheduleDemographic characteristics:
Male sex
Rural residence
American Indian & Hispanics 
(particularly in intervention mine)
Co-morbidities: 
Obesity, hypertension, diabetes 
mellitus, cardiovascular disease
Co-exposures: 
Smoking/environmental tobacco 
smoke 
Work in high particulate air pollutant 
environments
Cross-cutting factors for vulnerable and susceptible workers
Enhanced Exposure to SARS-CoV-2:
Residence in homes that are overcrowded or multigenerational or without 
access to running water use (particularly in intervention mine)
Predisposition to Poorer Health Outcomes:
Low socioeconomic status

Community partners: Our engagement with key mining community 
stakeholders provides the foundation for the proposed project as well as 
sustainability for future partnerships. Our mobile screening program for 
NM and WY miners (14) was recognized as an innovation at the HRSA 
Rural Health Information Hub (Fig. 1). We have co-authored multiple 
research manuscripts with our partners (3, 15-20). Our Mining 
Advisory Council (MAC), chaired 
by a partner (Gore, LOS) allows 
stakeholders to review research 
materials and protocols. Our 
Miners’ Wellness TeleECHO 
Program helps telementor rural 
professionals caring for miners 
(21), details for which are 
available at 
http://echo.unm.edu/miners-
wellness/. The Advisory Council 
and the TeleECHO Program, 
recognized as rural COVID-19 
innovations by [CONTACT_273953]'s Rural Health Information Hub, exemplify our 
partnerships that will be leveraged for future pandemic mitigation 
efforts. 
Based upon data shown in 
Table 2, we serve 37% 
Hispanic, and 33% 
American Indian miners 
in NM, indicating robust 
participation from 
populations historically 
underrepresented in 
health research. NM data 
(19) indicate that minority 
miners are at greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_273935]-Hispanic white miners (18, 22). 
The sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking distribution, and prevalence of lung and cardiovascular 
diseases, diabetes, and hypertension support our position that miners are a unique population for 
studying SARS-CoV-2. 
The literature indicates that American Indians are reticent towards participating in research due to 
historic mistrust, resulting in some of the poorest health outcomes of any racial/ethnic group (21). 
However, our data from town hall meetings (Table 3) indicate that American Indian miners 
welcome participation in research to the same degree as those of non-American Indian descent, 
but maybe less comfortable with sharing biological specimens. To address this challenge, we will 
not store biological specimens for future research without consent for the same. Table 2. Characteristics

Page 8 of 32In a 2016 study at the intervention mine, we determined that 58% of miners used social media, 
91% reported Internet access over their telephone, and 92% used the phone for texting. Miners 
reported using social media for 51 (mean) ± 142 (SD) minutes daily for 6±5 years, indicating adept 
and frequent usage. 52% of those surveyed indicated an interest in using social media to receive 
information about miners’ projects from our group. The social media-savvy nature of rural NM 
miners, initially surprising to our group, is a novel way to reach out to the study population using 
phone/web apps, which will be developed by [CONTACT_273954], Albuquerque, New 
Mexico. Our mine safety officer partner, JC Williams, CMSP, helped establish our social media 
engagement and education plan, including a video tutorial. 
Our capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing: Molecular tests 
help establish a diagnosis by [CONTACT_273955]–CoV-2 
nucleic acids using RT-PCR or nucleic acid amplification 
assays (23). Laboratory-based RT-PCR assays performed 
on nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs collected by [CONTACT_273956] (i.e., diagnostic test) are the cornerstone of 
diagnostic testing. A recent study showed that 
unsupervised, self-collected, midnasal swabs for the 
detection of SARS-CoV-2 are comparable to clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (Cohen K 
statistic = 0.81), offering a unique opportunity to scale-up workplace testing (24). The commercial 
choice of screening test for our study will be finalized, based on test availability, in collaboration 
with the NIH RADx-UP initiative, but will have the following characteristics (Regulatory status: 
All; Diagnostic target: Viral antigen; Analysis location: Self or Lab CLIA Waived; Platform: 
Lateral flow; Specimen collected: Nasal swab; Company: Any; Minutes to result: 30 minutes or 
less; Sensitivity and specificity: At least 80%)..
We have performed over 600 RT-qPCR measurements of patient samples for our ongoing projects 
using the CDC N1 and N2 assays and a published “Wuhan” spi[INVESTIGATOR_144870] (S) gene assay. The 
results showed that the CDC N1 assay is the most robust. As such, we present viral load dynamics 
(log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) for the N1 assay in non-severe (n=13) and severe (n=19) patients with COVID-
19. As shown in Fig. 2, patients with severe disease have a higher and more protracted viral load 
in the upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] (NP, P<0.001, panel A) and peripheral whole blood (P<0.01, panel 
B) compared to non-severe patients. Also, to capture viral load during the time-course 
measurements, area-under-curve (AUC) was calculated for the two groups. Patients with severe 
disease had a higher AUC than those with non-severe disease for both NP and peripheral blood 
(Fig. 3C). There was a significant positive relationship between severe disease and viral loads 
measured from the NP swabs (P=1.2x10-4) and whole blood (P=4.9x10-3), and between the NP and 
peripheral blood viral loads (P=2.5x10-6). Table 4: List of study SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_334807] (molecular) Yes

Page 9 of 323. Study Design
3.1. Specific Aim 1:
Frequent testing (i.e. alternate work shifts) using less sensitive molecular tests is proposed 
to keep workplaces open safely during the pandemic (26, 27), but its feasibility has not 
been studied. Our objective is to perform an experimental feasibility study to determine the 
acceptance of frequent point-of-care screening testing in our unique population. Our 
working hypothesis is miners will have a cumulative acceptance rate of frequent screening 
testing at ≥85%, with the added objective of exploring difference in acceptance by [CONTACT_273957]. The rationale for the proposed work is to establish worker acceptability for 
the proposed workplace surveillance. We expect that our findings will help design novel 
primary SARS-CoV-2 prevention strategies at rural workplaces, including future 
vaccination studies of essential workers.
Research design: This is a longitudinal surveillance study over up to twelve months, 
starting January 2021. We will utilize a fixed cohort of less than 250 at-risk miners at the 
intervention site, a surface coal mine in McKinley County, NM, with a population 
comprised of 66% minorities (American Indian and Hispanic), in partnership with the 
mine leadership.
3.2. Specific Aim 2:
Effective molecular surveillance may be only marginally affected by a test’s lower 
analytical limits of detection (26). Although molecular tests may show false negatives (FN) 
early on or late in the infection cycle when viral load is increasing and decreasing, 
respectively, the viral burden corresponding to a positive screening test is not established 
(29). Interim results demonstrate that when compared to the diagnostic (laboratory-based 
qualitative RT-PCR), screening test in controlled settings (in urgent care clinic, 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_273936]) is ≥95% sensitive and ≥99% specific (30). In our 
study, the screening test utilizes samples collected: a) at the workplace, b) by [CONTACT_2416], c) using nasal swabs followed by [CONTACT_2929]-of-care testing, d) in a low 
infrastructure community setting, e) by [CONTACT_273958]. The screening test 
was granted emergency use authorization without a detailed study on end-user needs in the 
real-world, but each of the above variables introduces a potential source of error in results.

Page [ADDRESS_334808] by [CONTACT_273959]-collected nasal swab and health personnel-collected nasopharyngeal 
(NP) swab specimens, using quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). Our working hypothesis is 
that the sensitivity of the screening test in a real-world study setting is a) comparable to 
that described by [CONTACT_273951], and b) positively associated with viral load 
in upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_153194]. Successful completion of this study will help determine 
the real-world performance of less sensitive screening tests in disease settings of mild 
severity.
Research design: In this cross-sectional study, sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic 
accuracy (31) of the screening test on a self-collected nasal swab will be established by 
[CONTACT_273960] (qualitative RT-PCR), the latter conducted on an NP swab 
collected on the same day by [CONTACT_273961], in a CLIA certified clinical 
laboratory (TriCore; Table 5). Also, since the diagnostic test is qualitative, we will also 
quantify viral load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from repeat nasal (self-collected) and NP (collected 
by [CONTACT_273962]) swab specimens using RT-qPCR established in the Perkins 
research laboratory (32). Viral load will be determined with primers and probes (N1 and 
RP) using the CDC 2019-nCoVEUA-01 diagnostic panel (33). Miners with any positive 
screening test (plus a sample of ~[ADDRESS_334809]) will undergo the above 
testing procedures. Database management and timelines will be similar to those described 
in Aim 1.

resulting in a novel primary prevention strategy targeted at rural essential workers.
Research design: We will conduct a up to twelve-month longitudinal surveillance study 
of miners at the intervention site (n=less than 250) in McKinley County, NM, and control 
site (n=less than 350) in Campbell County, WY. Both surface coal mines, operated by [CONTACT_273948], have similar engineering, administrative, and personal protective measures 
in place, including SARS-CoV-2 symptom & fever screening. While there will be frequent 
point-of-care molecular testing at the intervention site, seropositivity (baseline, 3, 6, and 
approximately12 m) will be measured at both sites.
3.4. Specific Aim 4:
Factors impacting SARS-CoV-2 spread is not well studied in rural essential workers 
outside healthcare. Our objective is to examine novel factors affecting the spread of 
infection in miners. A recent epi[INVESTIGATOR_273937]-19 mortality in 
communities exposed to ambient particulate air pollution (11). This novel risk factor is 
relevant for miners who are exposed to high levels of particulate air pollution at the 
workplace. Further, although the CDC encourages the public use of a cloth face-covering, 
its use by [CONTACT_273963], based upon individual and community factors (38), and has not 
been adequately studied. Our working hypothesis 4A is that miners with incident infection 
demonstrate less frequent use of cloth face-coverings outside the workplace, greater mine 
dust exposure intensity, presence of dust-related lung disease, and racial/ethnic minority 
status than those not infected. Hypothesis 4B: Test and vaccine uptake in miners is 
predicted by [CONTACT_273964]. The rationale for the proposed work is to 
prevent the spread of COVID-[ADDRESS_334813] that our findings will result in novel 
primary prevention strategies for workers in dusty trades.
Research design: This is a up to twelve-month longitudinal surveillance study at the 
intervention (n=less than 250) and control (n=less than 350) mines.

the intervention site, seroprevalence (baseline, 3, 6, and 12 m) will be measured as an outcome 
at both sites.
6. Study Timelines
The duration of individual subject’s participation in this research is estimated to be 
approximately [ADDRESS_334814] month of the recruitment and enrollment. 
Below are milestones with estimated dates of completion. The dates may be adjusted as 
necessary depending on the completion of previous milestones. 
Milestone 1: Completion of planning, contracts, purchase of tests and supplies, protocols and 
IRB approval: by [CONTACT_36466] 2021. 
Milestone 2: Recruitment and collection of data: January 2021 through March 2022 
(anticipated). 
Milestone 3: Data analysis and dissemination: July 2021 through November 2022 
(anticipated).
7. Study Endpoints:
7.1. Specific Aim 1:
Predictor and Outcome variables: Screening test acceptance by [CONTACT_273965] (i.e., outcome) is calculated over 
the study timeframe (frequency of tests /number of eligible shifts worked, max=less than 
60). Characteristics predicting acceptance include self-reported educational and 
racial/ethnic minority status (from baseline questionnaire), self-reported prior SARS-CoV-
2 infection or vaccination (from app), evidence of prior infection (from a prior positive 
screening test), and daily county incidence and prevalence infection rates (from publicly 
available data). Focus group discussions and/or individual interviews will be performed in 
a sample of subjects at the intervention mine (in NM) to better understand ‘testing 
hesitancy’ towards the end of the study, using an interview script and trained interviewers. 
Only approved study members will be performing interviews. 
Expected outcomes: We anticipate a higher testing acceptance rate among non-Hispanic 
whites and those with higher self-reported educational status. Conversely, we expect lower 
acceptance rates among those with prior infection (or vaccination), and during time 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_273931] ‘essential’ workplaces open safely during the 
COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for 
miners
Page 13 of 32intervals in which incidence of infection in the County is either trending down or at a low 
level.
7.2. Specific Aim 2:
Predictor and Outcome variables: Predictor variable is the sensitivity of the screening test 
in our study conditions. Outcomes are a) the sensitivity of the screening test reported by 
[CONTACT_273951], and b) viral load measurements in upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_153194] 
(i.e., repeat nasal and NP swab). 
Expected outcomes: We anticipate that the screening test results can be confirmed by 
[CONTACT_273966]-CoV-2 load, within the limit of RT-qPCR detection. Based on our 
preliminary data (Fig. 2), our detection limit is ≥100 viral copi[INVESTIGATOR_269487] (32). This level 
of detection is contingent on obtaining enough sample material. It remains unclear if a self-
collected nasal swab collected in a real-world setting will consistently yield enough sample 
material to detect SARS-CoV-2. Since we will incorporate a primer and probe for the 
detection of the human ribonuclease P gene in our assay, we can directly determine if there 
is sufficient sample material on the screening test for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The 
study design will also allow us to determine if the level of the virus on the nasal swab, self-
collected in a real-world setting, is comparable in its ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 as that 
of a health personnel-collected NP swab.
7.3. Specific Aim 3:
Predictor and Outcome variables: The predictor variable is the mine status (intervention 
vs. control). The primary outcome is any new seropositivity for SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_334815] (depending 
upon availability, finalized using NIH recommendation) allows for the qualitative 
detection of IgG or IgM antibodies (separately) against SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent 
(IgM: 3-5 days) or prior infection (currently unknown). We will also study the presence 
of symptoms or fever, irrespective of infection status, as an alternative study outcome for 
hypothesis 3A. Costs of the test-based surveillance program, employee absenteeism 
patterns, and mine coal production will contribute towards defining the outcome variables 
for hypothesis 3B. At a minimum, a valuable outcome is to determine surveillance 
program costs, which have not been previously established for this rural industry setting, 
organization size, or proposed surveillance frequency. Additionally, variance in outcome 
measures—defined as employee days lost due to incident infection, mine productivity, and 
reduction in worksite infection rate—across the two sites will be used to estimate the cost-
effectiveness of the intervention. Database management and timeline are similar to that 
for Aim 1.
Expected outcomes: We anticipate that as compared to the control mine, the intervention 
mine demonstrates lower incident seropositivity, and that workplace surveillance is cost-
effective over twelve months.
7.4. Specific Aim 4:
Predictor, and outcome variables: The outcome variable for hypothesis 4A of incident 
seropositivity, is defined as in Aim 3. Predictor variables include frequency of cloth face-
covering use outside the mine, occupational dust exposure intensity, presence of lung

COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for 
miners
Page 14 of 32disease (historically or measured by [CONTACT_273967]), and race/ethnicity status. 
Additional predictor variables for hypothesis 4B are specific barriers and facilitators. 
Additional outcomes for hypothesis 4B are test and vaccine uptake.
Expected outcomes: We anticipate that low levels of use of cloth face-coverings in public 
settings outside the mine, high levels of occupational dust exposure intensity, baseline 
dust-related lung disease, and racial/ethnic minorities are each associated with a greater 
relative risk for incident seropositivity than those without these characteristics. We 
anticipate that additional predictor variables, as outlined in the previous paragraph, affect 
test and vaccine uptake.
8. Research Setting
Recruitment, enrollment, and data collection will be conducted at the Peabody El Segundo 
mine in McKinley County, NM (i.e., intervention mine) and the Peabody Caballo and Rawhide 
mines at Campbell County, WY (i.e., control mine). Both surface coal mines, operated by [CONTACT_273948], have similar engineering, administrative and personal protective measures in 
place, including SARS-CoV-2 symptom & fever screening.
Baseline survey will be collected from both intervention and control mine sites but the 
additional questionnaire (and sputum collection) will be limited to the NM mine site only.
Confirmatory diagnostic tests, which are standard of care RT-PCR tests, will be conducted at 
TriCore Reference Laboratories from samples collected at the Peabody El Segundo mine or at 
the Cibola General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (where TriCore Reference Laboratories currently provide reference 
laboratory services). The results from the standard of care test will be provided by [CONTACT_273968]. This does not require a data user agreement.
Since the confirmatory diagnostic standard of care test is qualitative, we will also quantify viral 
load (log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from nasal (self-collected) and NP (collected by [CONTACT_273962]) 
swab specimens using research diagnostic RT-qPCR tests established in the research 
laboratory of [CONTACT_15300] J. Perkins at the Center of Global Health in the University of New 
Mexico’s Department of Internal Medicine. The specimens for the research diagnostic tests 
will be collected at the Peabody El Segundo mine or at the Cibola General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Any 
specimens collected will be transferred to the Perkins laboratory using a Materials Transfer Agreement 
(MTA) 
Statistical analysis will be completed at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. 
We will engage and work with the Mining Advisory Council, chaired by a partner, Bobbi Gore. 
This council allows stakeholders to review research materials and protocols. 
9. Resources Available
This study is based on the collective experience, expertise and infrastructure put together by a 
respected team of researchers, and community and clinical experts from the University of New 
Mexico and the Peabody mine sites in the states of New Mexico and Wyoming. This 
collaborative team, from the University of New Mexico (UNM) Health Sciences Center 
(HSC), Miners Colfax Medical Center, the Peabody El Segundo Mine, and the Peabody

10.Prior Approvals
UNM HSC IRB approval will be obtained before beginning any study activities.
11.Multi-Site Research
This is a single site study (i.e., at UNM HSC), with recruitment at two mine sites. This does 
not qualify as multi-site search. This study will take place and recruit participants at the (1) 
Peabody El Segundo Mine in McKinley County, NM at the edge of Navajo Nation (i.e., 
intervention mine), and the (2) Peabody Caballo and Rawhide mines at Campbell County, WY 
(i.e., control  mine). Laboratory diagnostic testing will be conducted at TriCore Reference 
Laboratories. Since the diagnostic test is qualitative, we will also quantify viral load (log 10 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) from nasal (self-collected) and NP (collected by [CONTACT_273962]) swab 
specimens using RT-qPCR established in the research laboratory of [CONTACT_15300] J. Perkins at 
the Center of Global Health in the University of New Mexico’s Department of Internal 
Medicine. Data storage and analysis will be conducted at the University of New Mexico Health 
Sciences Center. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_273938], properly trained; they will have the most current version of the 
protocol, consent documents, and HIPAA authorization; any modifications will be 
communicated to sites and implemented only after IRB approval; they will safeguard all 
research data; any non-compliance with the study protocol or applicable requirements will be 
reported immediately to the PI; all adverse events, interim results and study closure 
determinations will be communicated via email and/or teleconference between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_242328].

Page 16 of 3212.1. Specific Aim 1:
Miners work one of two twelve-hour shifts daily, in repeated patterns of [ADDRESS_334816], and will be: 1) referred to their healthcare 
provider; 2) offered telemedicine evaluation at UNM, for those interested, and 3) 
removed from the workplace per CDC guidance (28). The final assay for the screening 
test will be decided based on advice from the NIH RADx-UP Coordinating and Data 
Collection Center. Acceptance data will be entered at the mine site by [CONTACT_273969] a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database. Focus group 
discussions and/or individual interviews will be performed in a sample of subjects at the 
intervention mine in NM to better understand ‘testing hesitancy’ towards the end of the 
study. 
12.2. Specific Aim 2:
Miners with any positive screening test (plus a sample of ~[ADDRESS_334817]) will undergo trained professional collected NP swab (for RT-PCR diagnostic 
testing), self-collected nasal swab (for RT-qPCR) and trained professional collected NP 
swab (for RT-qPCR). Database management and timelines will be similar to those 
described in Aim 1.

COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for 
miners
Page 17 of 32In brief, at the beginning of each work shift, trained mine safety personnel will obtain the 
following: 1) 24-hour history of SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_334819] with any infected, vaccination, and use of cloth face-covering in 
public settings outside the mine, using a web-based phone app, also available using a 
computer connected to the Internet; and 2) body temperature measurement using a no-
touch forehead infrared thermometer. The web-based phone app, created by [CONTACT_273971]., will be accessed by [CONTACT_273972]. The information 
will be encrypted during data transfer to a secure server that resides at the UNM HSC 
and will auto-populate the REDCap database.  The phone app has been approved by 
[CONTACT_273973].
At the beginning of each alternate shift, the mine safety team will collect a supervised 
self-collected nasal swab from each worker for point-of-care screening testing, as 
described in Aim 1. Fingerstick or venipuncture blood samples will be obtained at the 
mine site from all study participants at the time of enrollment, and at 3, 6, and 
approximately 12 months (no more than 24 ml or 4.9 teaspoons each visit) to determine 
seropositivity, using the COVID-19 IgG/IgM antibody test. Employee absenteeism (both 
general and screen test results-driven) and coal production records will be analyzed.
12.4. Specific Aim 4:
Predictor variables are listed in Table titled Overview of Study Procedures. Database 
management and timeline will be similar to that for Aim 1.
13.Data Analysis
13.1. Specific Aim 1:
Predictor and Outcome variables: Test acceptance by [CONTACT_273965] (i.e., outcome) is 
calculated over the study timeframe (frequency of tests /number of eligible 
shifts worked, max number estimated at less than 120). Characteristics 
predicting acceptance include self-reported educational and racial/ethnic 
minority status (from baseline questionnaire), self-reported prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection or vaccination (from app), evidence of prior infection (from a prior 
positive screening test), and daily county incidence and prevalence infection 
rates (from publicly available data). 
Statistical approach: Cumulative acceptance rate will be compared between 
groups, defined by [CONTACT_273974]. Poisson regression with indicator 
variables will be used to assess the effects of miner characteristics on 
cumulative acceptance rates. Analyses will use the number of shifts in which 
tests were available to miners for the rate denominator (offset) to account for 
absenteeism. Longitudinal analysis of shift-level acceptance by [CONTACT_273975]. Within-miner factors will include time-varying SARS-2-
COV-2 exposure (personal and community) and vaccination status, and linear 
and nonlinear time trends. 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_273931] ‘essential’ workplaces open safely during the 
COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for 
miners
Page 18 of 32Power calculations: If we recruit less than [ADDRESS_334820] the power to estimate 
85% acceptance rate ± 4.6%. For a comparison of acceptance rates between predictor 
groups, we assume, for example, non-Hispanic white and minority miners (1/3 and 2/3 
of the study population respectively) have 85% and 80% acceptance respectively. We 
used simulation to assess power for Poisson regression analyses where the rate 
denominator (offset) is the number of miner workdays, assumed to be 95% of possible 
days. For these conditions, power is 94% for a 5% lower acceptance rate for minority 
miners. We also used simulation to assess the planned longitudinal analysis of miner 
acceptance by [CONTACT_273976] 95% of the shifts, that initial 
acceptance is 85% and that there is a linear decline in acceptance over the study to a 
final acceptance rate of 80%. For repeated measures on about [ADDRESS_334821] a linear decrease to 80% is 95%.
13.2. Specific Aim 2:
Statistical analysis: We will compare screening test performance measures 
between our real-world study setting and controlled settings (as published by 
[CONTACT_2312]). We will use a one-sample Exact test for a binomial proportion to test 
whether sensitivity for the screening test is the same as that published. We will 
correlate screening test results with quantitative viral loads, and perform Bland-
Altman plots to reveal systematic differences between viral loads collected by 
[CONTACT_273977].
Power Calculations: If we conservatively estimate identifying [ADDRESS_334822] the power (>90%) to detect a difference between the screening and the 
comparison test if the screening test sensitivity is 90% or lower.
13.3.Specific Aim 3:
Predictor and Outcome variables: The predictor variable is the mine status. The 
primary outcome is any new seropositivity for SARS-CoV-[ADDRESS_334823] allows for the qualitative detection of 
IgG and/or IgM antibodies (separately) against SARS-CoV-2, indicating recent 
(IgM: 3-5 days) or prior infection (currently unknown). The tests have positive 
percent agreements of 97% and 87% and negative percent agreements of 98% 
and 99% for IgG and IgM, respectively, compared to oropharyngeal swab RT-
PCR. We will also study the presence of symptoms or fever, irrespective of 
infection status, as an alternative study outcome for hypothesis 3A. Costs of the 
test-based surveillance program, employee absenteeism patterns, and mine coal 
production will contribute towards defining the outcome variables for 
hypothesis 3B. At a minimum, a valuable outcome is to determine surveillance 
program costs, which have not been previously established for this rural 
industry setting, organization size, or proposed surveillance frequency. 
Additionally, variance in outcome measures—defined as employee days lost 
due to incident infection, mine productivity, and reduction in worksite infection 
rate—across the two sites will be used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the 
intervention. Database management and timeline are similar to that for Aim 1.
PROTOCOL TITLE: Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_273931] ‘essential’ workplaces open safely during the 
COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for 
miners
Page 19 of 32Covariates: Baseline seropositivity, vaccination status, other host susceptibility 
and vulnerability factors outlined in Table 1, and daily community prevalence 
and incidence, will be studied as covariates in multivariable models (35). 
Statistical analysis: Chi-square tests will examine whether relative frequencies 
of incident seropositive miners are the same at 3-months, 6-months, and 12-
months for the two mine types, using α=0.025 to account for the two tests. 
Generalized linear models for repeated binary outcomes will be used to assess 
how covariates are associated with seropositive status over time. 
Power calculation: Based on representative seroprevalence/molecular prevalence rates 
for similar communities (36), we anticipate a 10% baseline seropositivity with incident 
seropositivity at 6 months at 5% for the intervention mine and a baseline seropositivity 
of 5% in the control mine. We anticipate similar power calculations to apply up to [ADDRESS_334824] 80% power when comparing frequencies at the two mines using chi-square 
tests. We expect 80% power if incident seropositivity at the control mine is ≥9% (α
=0.025).
13.4. Specific Aim 4:
Statistical analysis: Chi-square and logistic regression analyses will be used to 
explore how miner characteristics are associated with baseline seropositivity. 
Generalized linear models for repeated binary outcomes will be used to assess 
how predictor variables (noted in Table 7) and covariates (as noted in Aim 3) 
are associated with incident seropositivity at 3, 6, & approximately 12 months. 
Both analysis strategies will include mine type as a covariate and will add 
predictor and outcome variables noted in Table 7. 
Power calculation: We assessed power, using simulation for incident seropositivity at [ADDRESS_334825] 
exposure. We anticipate similar power calculations up to 12 months. We assumed the 
miner variable, present in 1/3 sample, will increase the probability of incident 
seropositivity by 0.10. For a logistic regression analysis and this setup, power is >96%.

When using the data from this second database, researchers will only have access to 
subject non-identifiable data and cannot link the data back to the subject.  
For all data sets, preliminary analyses will include checking for missing values, range 
checking, and outlier checking. 
Only IRB approved study team members will be able to view and have access to research 
related data.
Please note that a DUA will be put into effect with Duke Clinical Research Institute (please 
see sections 47 and 48) and the SPO will be utilized for the same. Please note that a MTA

sections 47 and 48).
DUA and MTA are part of the contract with Peabody mines. DUA is part of the contract with 
Ingenuity Software (for phone app creation).
17.Data and Specimen Banking
We will utilize the approved data and biological specimen repository study (HRRC ID 14-
058). Blood and respi[INVESTIGATOR_273942], if allowed by [CONTACT_1177]. The specimens 
will be stored in the IRB and HTOC-approved MEL Repository with HRRC ID 17-422. The 
existing study 14-058, will be amended to account for samples from this study being added to 
it. 
18.Risks to Subjects
Potential Risks: The proposed protocol involves minimal risk only. However, we will 
continuously monitor the study related procedures and data collections. We have established 
mechanism to protect the confidentiality of participant information. Nevertheless, accidental 
disclosure of study data may occur.  There are no alternative treatments appropriate for this 
protocol and no circumstances for terminating the study other than declining to participate in 
the study. Only trained and certified staff will perform and administer the procedures to 
minimize the risk of following:
Loss of privacy: Participation in a research study may result in some loss of privacy. The risk 
of loss of privacy and confidentiality will be minimized. Information about a subject will be 
handled as confidentially as possible. Representatives from the University of New Mexico 
Health Sciences Center Human Research Review Committee that oversees human subject 
research and the National Institutes of Health will be permitted access to a subject’s records. 
Also, a subject’s participation in the study and information in a subject’s study records may be 
disclosed to a subject’s doctors and nurses, and may be disclosed as otherwise provided by 
[CONTACT_2371]. However, a subject’s name [CONTACT_193694]. 
Please also see the section on data management.
Injury from fingerstick or venous blood draws: Temporary local discomfort accompanies 
virtually all needle sticks. Potential injury from venous blood draws includes occasional 
(<10%) bruising, sweating, dizziness and rarely (<1%) fainting and infection.
Nasopharyngeal (NP) and Nasal Swabs: Occasional and temporary mild discomfort and 
bleeding from repeated efforts of obtaining NP swabs.  Nasal swabs can be performed without 
discomfort or risk.
Precautions will be exercised in order to maintain the highest standard of anonymity. Each 
patient data/blood samples will be given a unique study number that will not be linked in any 
way to standard HIPAA identifiers, and importantly, the datasets we will work with are 
Limited Data Sets in accordance with HIPAA guidelines (stripped of standard identifiers). The 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_273931] ‘essential’ workplaces open safely during the 
COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for 
miners
Page [ADDRESS_334831] name [CONTACT_273998], blood samples, in abstracts, scientific 
papers or other documents that emanate from this study. Importantly, random anonymous 
identifiers will be used to label blood samples.
Survey and Questionnaires: Answering some questions may cause stress and/or emotional 
discomfort.
Spontaneous home collected sputum: The risks related to spontaneous sputum 
expectoration are minimal and include cough, chest discomfort or shortness of breath but this 
is anticipated to be short lasting. At home, taking a shower before collecting the sample may 
help.
There may also be side effects or risks to study participation that are unforeseen and not 
known at this time.
19.Potential Benefits to Subjects
There will be no direct benefit to participants of this study. The risks involved do not pose a 
significant threat to the health of the participants. However, the prevalence of COVID-19 in 
rural essential workers and minorities can be very high. Thus, participants in the proposed 
study may benefit from early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19.
20.Recruitment Methods
Less than 600 subjects will be recruited at all mine sites in this longitudinal study. Of 
these, less than 250 miners will be recruited from the Peabody El Segundo mine in 
McKinley County, NM at the edge of Navajo Nation (i.e., intervention mine). The 
remaining less than 350 miners will be recruited from the Peabody Caballo and 
Rawhide mines at Campbell County, WY (i.e., control mine). Both surface coal mines, 
operated by [CONTACT_81363], have similar engineering, administrative and personal 
protective measures in place, including SARS-CoV-2 symptom & fever screening. 
While there will be frequent point-of-care molecular testing at the intervention site, 
seroprevalence (baseline 3, 6 and approximately 12 m) will be measured as an outcome 
at both sites.
All miners will be recruited at the mine site with the support of mine leadership (see attached 
letters). Recruitment methods include 1) flyers and emails (attached) and 2) miner videos, 
placed on ‘theamericanminer.org’ website and played on mine TV monitors.
21.Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects
The research study will require IRB approval. 
The risk of loss of privacy and confidentiality will be minimized. Information about a 
subject will be handled as confidentially as possible. Representatives from the 
University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center Human Research Review 
Committee that oversees human subject research and the National Institutes of Health 
will be permitted access to a subject’s records. Also, a subject’s participation in the 
PROTOCOL TITLE: Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_273931] ‘essential’ workplaces open safely during the 
COVID-19 pandemic: The role of frequent point-of-care molecular workplace surveillance for 
miners
Page [ADDRESS_334832]’s study records may be disclosed to a subject’s 
doctors and nurses, and may be disclosed as otherwise provided by [CONTACT_2371]. However, a 
subject’s name [CONTACT_193694]. Please also 
see the section on data management.
The mines have walled-off sections that give privacy to study participants and for 
making them feel at ease and in control of with whom they interact and prevents 
‘eavesdroppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ or observation by [CONTACT_105]-study team members.  Privacy will be protected 
during recruitment, consent, and data collection.
Additionally, all tests will be similarly performed by [CONTACT_273984].
22.Economic Burden to Subjects
Subjects are not responsible for their participation in the research.  There are no costs to 
participants. If there are any adverse events or complications, the cost of treating those adverse 
events or complications will be borne by [CONTACT_273985].

to follow-up with their primary care physicians, as necessary.
We do not expect any incidental findings, as we are specifically testing for COVID-19 and 
IgG/IgM antibodies to COVID-[ADDRESS_334840] will be shared with 
public health authorities, as necessary. 
29.Inclusion of Vulnerable Populations
N/A – No vulnerable populations will be recruited for this study.
30.Community-Based Participatory Research
Community partners: Our engagement with key mining community stakeholders provides the 
foundation for the proposed project as well as sustainability for future partnerships. Our 
Mining Advisory Council (MAC), chaired by a partner (Gore, LOS) allows stakeholders to 
review research materials and protocols. Our Miners’ Wellness TeleECHO Program helps 
telementor rural professionals caring for miners (21), details for which are available at 
http://echo.unm.edu/miners-wellness/. The Advisory Council and the TeleECHO Program, 
recognized as rural COVID-19 innovations by [CONTACT_273953]'s Rural Health Information Hub, 
exemplify our partnerships that will be leveraged for future pandemic mitigation efforts. 
Based upon data shown in

Page 28 of 32miners are at greater risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_273935]-Hispanic white miners (18, 22). 
The sex, race/ethnicity, and smoking distribution, and prevalence of lung and cardiovascular 
diseases, diabetes, and hypertension support our position that miners are a unique population 
for studying SARS-CoV-2. 
The literature indicates that American Indians are reticent towards participating in research due 
to historic mistrust, resulting in some of the poorest health outcomes of any racial/ethnic group 
(21). However, our data from town hall meetings (Table 3) indicate that American Indian 
miners welcome participation in research to the same degree as those of non-American Indian 
descent, but maybe less comfortable with sharing biological specimens. To address this 
challenge, we will not store biological specimens for future research for participants who do 
not provide consent for the same.
31.Research Involving American Indian/Native Populations
We anticipate enrolling approximately 66% racial/ethnic minorities, including approximately 
33% American Indians, at the NM-based intervention mine. Since we will not collect tribe-
specific data on American Indian subjects and since the intervention mine is located outside 
the Navajo nation and University IRB rules apply, we do not need tribal IRB permissions. We 
anticipate enrolling 5% racial/ethnic minorities in the WY-based control mine, reflecting the 
demographic population of that mining community.

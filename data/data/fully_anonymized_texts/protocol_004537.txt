 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
 
1.1 Background  
 
 
The HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_287568] (YMSM).  YMSM  aged 13-[ADDRESS_350732]  increase  (26%)  in diagnosed  HIV infections  from [ADDRESS_350733]  
remained high through  2014.  YMSM accounted for 28% of new HIV infections  among MSM and 82% 
of new HIV diagnoses  among youth aged  13-[ADDRESS_350734] increase in new infections  during  this period. In 2014,  
Black  and Latino MSM accounted for 55% and 23% of infections  among  YMSM  respectively .[ADDRESS_350735] yearly  HIV testing for MSM,  in a recent  national  online survey,  
only 53% of YMSM reported testing  in the past year,  and 33% had never tested in their lifetime.3 Only 
41% of US  HIV-infected youth are aware of their diagnosis,  of which only  62% eng aged in care within  a 
year.4 Reasons  for not testing include low perceived risk (42%), fear of testing  positive  (20%),  and not 
having  time to test (11%).[ADDRESS_350736] been identified  as barriers  to HIV/STI  
testing.26,27 
 
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis  (PrEP)  has demons trated high efficacy,  but uptake  has been low among 
YMSM.  The iPrEx  trial, in which  half the particip ants were  under  25, demonstrated  an estimated  >90%  
PrEP efficacy  among  MSM with detectable drug levels  in blood.28,[ADDRESS_350737]  likely  to initiate PrEP,  with only 9% of PrEP  initiations  in [ADDRESS_350738] of PrEP,  and 1.7%  
had ever used PrEP.[ADDRESS_350739]  of 550 MSM,  only 20% were  age 25 or under,  and PrEP  uptake  was lower  among  
younger,  non-white,  and less educat ed persons.  Self-perceived risk was low among  those  declining  
PrEP,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_287569].36 In the ATN 110 study  of YMSM  
aged  18-22, PrEP  uptake  was only 16%,  and PrEP adherence  was lower among  Black  YMSM and 
declined overall  during  follow-up, particularly  with less frequent  visits .[ADDRESS_350740] to reach through  clinical services. Smart  phone  
adoption is particularly  high among  young  adults, with approximately  86% of those under  age 30 owning  
a smart  phone.  Youth are more  likely  to use their mobile  devices  for more  activities,  such  as  
downloading  mobile  apps,  Internet  access,  social  netw orking,  and  accessing  health

 information.43,44 The expansion of smart  phones  has increased  the possibilitie s of dynamic,  mobile  
phone- based HIV prevention  interventions.  
 
Using the  Information -Motivation- Behavior Skills  (IMB)  model, we have developed a highly interactive  
mobile  app to promote  accurate  risk perception and increase HIV/STI testing  and linkage to care among 
YMSM.  Sex Pro (Sexual  Health  Promotion)  is an innovative web-based tool that provides  a personalized  
HIV risk score, based  on data from several  large  MSM  cohort  studies.12,16,45,46 This score  is displayed 
on a “speed ometer”  (1-20 scale),  with a higher  score  representing a higher level of protection,  and was 
highly  predictive of HIV risk among  Black  MSM in HPTN 061, with all HIV infections  occu rring in 
individuals with  a score below  16.47 YMSM found it partic ularly useful  and informative,  but prefe rred a 
mobile  app. Sex Pro has been  developed into a mobile  app, with additional  features incor porated,  
including  a sex diary  to facilitate  accurate  data collection;  HIV/STI  testing information  and reminders;  
and access to home HIV/STI testing options  and geospatial -based testing site and linkage to HIV care 
information.  
 
This study is part of the iTech  NIH U19,  which  has the overall goal to develop innovative  technology - 
focused  interventions  addressing the HIV prevent ion and care continuum  for youth.  
 
In this pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080],  we propose to develop a new app, LYNX, by [CONTACT_287598].  We will then evaluate the acceptability  and feasibi lity of this 
integrated  app in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT)  among  YMSM at risk for HIV acquisitio n in 
the US. If found to be feasible  and acceptable,  LYNX will be tested for efficacy in increasing  HIV testing  
and PrEP linkage  in a separate  efficacy RCT study  as part of the iTech.  
 
1.2 Rationale  
 
 
A mobile  app that promotes  HIV/STI testing  and increases  PrEP  uptake will likely have the largest  
impact  in YMSM.  While  HIV/STI  testing  are important  first steps  in the prevention cascade in YMSM, 
access to highly  effective  interventions  (e.g.,  PrEP)  are critical for this vulnerable population.  Therefore,  
in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799],  we propose to expand  our current  mobile  app to include components  to increase  
uptake and linkage  to PrEP for YMSM.  Key components  of this new integrated app, LYNX  will address  
information,  motivation,  and behavioral  skills  (IMB)  needs  for both incre asing HIV/STI testing frequency  
and PrEP uptake  (Figu re 1).

2.0 STUDY  OBJECTIVES  
 
 
2.1 Primary  Objectives:  
 
 
Aim 1: To conduct  qualitative,  formative  work  to refine  a mobile phone app, LYNX, to promote  
HIV/STI  testing  and PrEP  uptake  among YMSM  
 
Aim 2: To conduct  a technical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_287570],  technical  performance,  
and user satisfaction  
 
Aim 3: To conduct  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_287571]/STI  testing  and PrEP  uptake  among YMSM  
 
2.2 Secondary  Objectives  (Aim 3):  
 
 
• To compare  the rate of HIV/STI  testing  in the LYNX  intervention vs. control  arms  
• To compare  the rate of PrEP  uptake in the LYNX  intervention vs. control  arms  
• To compare  changes  in sexual  risk behaviors  among  YMSM in the LYNX  intervention vs. 
control  arms  
 
2.3 Study Hypotheses/Research  Ques tions  
 
 
Aim 1: Is the LYNX  app appealing to YMSM?  What  chan ges shou ld be made to make  it more 
acceptable to YMSM?  
 
Aim 2: Are the LYNX  app and study  procedures  and documents primed to be tested  in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2284]?  
 
Aim 3: Is the LYNX  app a feasible  and accept able method  to incre ase HIV testing  and PrEP  
uptake  among YMSM?  Are there  differences  in HIV/STI  testing and PrEP uptake  among 
participant s who receive LYNX  vs. the standard of care?

 3.0      STUD Y DESIGN  
 
 
Using  an iterative  process  of app development,  this study  will be conduc ted in 3 phases:  1) formative 
research to refine LYNX  with input  from YMSM;  2) a technical  open pi[INVESTIGATOR_287572];  and 3) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_287573],  acceptability,  and preliminary  efficacy  
of LYNX. 
 
● Formative Phase 
Guided by [CONTACT_287599], the LYNX  app will be refined  through an iterative  design process  informed 
by a series  of focus  groups and in-depth interviews  in up to 40 YMSM to elicit feedback  on content, 
usability,  layout,  and functionality  of the LYNX  app. 
 
● Technical  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_287574] a [ADDRESS_350743]. 
 
● Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265] 
60 HIV-uninfected  YMSM will be enrolled  into a 6 month pi[INVESTIGATOR_287575]. Participants  will be randomized 2:[ADDRESS_350744]  of care control  condition.  Feasibi lity and acceptabi lity will be assessed through app analytics  
of usage patterns  (logins,  use of app components)  and acceptability  scales administered  via computer- 
assisted  self interview.  We will also evaluate preliminary  efficacy  by [CONTACT_287600] [ADDRESS_350745] very different  needs and characteristics.

for Aim 1 and/or the technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_287579] [ADDRESS_350749].  
4.3 Recruitment  
 
 
Participants  will be recruited through  a variety  of strategies,  including online and social  media strategies  
(e.g.,  Craigslist  and Faceboo k ads);  distributing  posters, flyers,  and palm  cards about  the study;  and direct  
outreach at local venues  frequented by [CONTACT_146327],  including  communi ty-based organizations,  schools,  
bars, social clubs, beauty  parlors,  barber shops,  sports venues,  churches,  health fairs,  balls,  and 
other community events. Clinic -based  recruitment m ay include reviewing m edical charts of existing  
patients  for potential  eligibility,  or referrals  from other  providers  in the clinic.  In addition,  former  
participant s who have  previously  given  consent  to be contac ted for future research may also be directly  
contact[CONTACT_287601] (describe d in Section  4.5).  For Aim 3 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_4265]), we will follow 
respondent -driven sampling (RDS) methods and use a long- chain referral method to supplement 
recruitment, especially with the adolescents (15 -17) who may be harder to reach than young adults  (18-
24).  
 
4.4 Informed Consent  
 
 
Informed consent/assent. The informed consent process will occur on the day the enrollment visit  is 
held. Interested persons will be guided through the informed consent process by [CONTACT_464] , who will 
explain all study procedures , answer questions concerning the study and consent process , and offer a 
copy of the informed consent/assent form . The research staff member will give the participant as 
much time as needed and will address any questions or concerns they may have.  The participant will 
be allowed to take the consent/assent form home and review it before enrolling in the study if the participant needs more time to review the form.  The research staff member will ask the participant 
questions to gauge comprehension. The consent/assent form describes all study procedures, 
including confidentiality and privacy, information about potential risks, discomforts, benefits of 
participation, and information regarding who they can contact [CONTACT_112488]. It also states that 
participation is voluntary, that participants may decide not to take part or to withdraw from the study at 
any time without penalty or loss of any benefit to which they might otherwise be entitled, and that 
study participation is in no way related to being able to access or continue getting care or services at 
any participating study site. Participants can refuse to answer any question, and can withdraw from 
the study at any time. The PIs, Co- PIs, or designee at each site will review all informed consents and 
assents.   
 
Assessing for decisional capacity. For all participants, the research assistant (RA) reviews the 
informed consent/assent to make an  assessment of the youth’s decisional capacity and ability to 
provide consent/assent prior to signing, us ing a [ADDRESS_350750], the RA determines if the person 
understands the study goals by [CONTACT_7939] “Can you tell me what this study is about?” In step 2, potential 
participants will be asked questions designed to assess their capacity to understand, apprec iate, 
reason with, and express a choice about participation in our specific protocol. Participants will be 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018  
 
Page 18 of 46 
 
 asked to: name [CONTACT_112539]; explain what they would do if they 
no longer wished to participate in the study ; explain what they would do if they experienced distress 
during the study; and identify potential risks for participating in the study. For youth who cannot 
answer these questions, the RA will go back and review the relevant elements of consent with the 
participant again and repeat the process. Youth who appear not to understand after repeated review 
will not be enrolled in the study.  
 
Waiver of parental consent. We will request that the UNC- CH IRB as the single  IRB (IRB of Record) 
grant a waiver of parental  consent  to participate in this research study for youth participants who are 
15 to 17 years of age. The research team has been granted waivers of parental permission for prior 
studies with sexual minority youth. Under 45 CFR 46.408 (c), an IRB has the aut hority to waive 
parental permission if it determines that “a research protocol is designed for conditions or a subject 
population for which parental or guardian permission is not a reasonable requirement to protect the 
subjects” and “an appropriate mechani sm for protecting the children who will participate as research 
subjects is substituted” and “that the waiver is not inconsistent with Federal, State, or local law.” A waiver of signed consent and parental/legal guardian permission will be sought given tha t minor 
individuals can often seek sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV testing without parental/legal guardian permission, depending on each site’s state laws, and given that many of the youth in our 
study are likely to be gender and/or sexually f luid or have an attraction to persons of the same gender, 
but may not be out to their parents; requiring parental permission may place participants at risk for outing themselves as part of the LGBT community or being at risk for HIV infection.  A waiver of 
parental permission for studies with LGBT youth that do not involve greater than minimal risk is a 
common practice among researchers working in the area of gay and lesbian health/mental health. 
This is done to avoid the selection biases operating in only r ecruiting youth whose parents are both 
aware of and comfortable with their sexual orientation. Commonly, these youth have explored their sexual orientation without their parents’ knowledge as the youth struggle with issues of disclosure and 
its consequence s within the social, religious, and economic context of their families. A requirement for 
parental permission in this type of study could not only affect a person’s willingness to participate, but 
could also potentially impact the ability of researchers to engage in this type of research with sexual 
minority youth.  
 
 
If the purpose of requiring parental permission as stated in CFR is to protect the minor subject, then 
requiring parental permission for youth in these circumstances is not a reasonable require ment.  
Additional privacy protections are provided in that all assessments, notes, reports, and other records will be identified by [INVESTIGATOR_13701] a coded number to maintain participant confidentiality. These records and 
any forms that do contain identifying information (e.g., consent/assent forms, contact [CONTACT_3031]) will 
be kept in a locked, limited access area (such as a locked file cabinet) at the participating site.  
 
4.5 Screening  
 
All potential participants (whether recruited online or in- person) will complete an online screening survey 
to obtain consent/assent to be screened and verify all inclusion criteria. Screening may occur on the 
same day as enrollment or beforehand. The onli ne screening survey will begin with a script that will be 
read by [CONTACT_287602], they will be invited to participate in the study. The script will also provide general information about the research 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018  
 
Page 19 of 46 
 
 study, the nature of the screening questions and related potential risks, the approximate length of the  
screening (~5 minutes), the confidentiality of the screening information, the use of any screening 
information obtained, the ability to skip any questions or withdraw at any time, and contact [CONTACT_287603]. After reading this screening script, participants will be asked if they are 
interested in participating and agree to voluntarily complete the screening procedure. Participants will 
electronically indicate their agreement and then take the survey. The study will use SSL encryption for 
transfers of information online and data will be stored in the secure, HIPAA -compliant servers of 
SurveyGizmo. The Emory AC team maint ains a business partner HIPAA agreement with SurveyGizmo.  
 
For potential participants who are at least [ADDRESS_350751] information of eligible participants with SRV sites via 
a secure iTech Box account. SRV staff will enter the eligible participant into SMART  (described in more 
detail later in the protocol)  for scheduling and contact [CONTACT_287604]- person visit at the 
SRV.  SRVs will also have the option to have the participant complete the online screener the day of the 
in-person visit ; study staff can view eligibility on the browser window once the screener is complete or 
review the automatic eligibility email sent after survey completion.  
 
 
 
5.0 STUD Y PROCEDURE S 
 
 
5.1 Enrollment  procedures  
 
Individuals who screen eligible  will be contact[CONTACT_287605]- person visit to the SRV at the 
participant’s earliest convenience. SRVs will also have the option to have the participant complete the 
online screener the day of the visit . During the visit, the eligibility of the participant will be confirmed, 
details of the study will be explained and informed consent/assent obtained.   
 
Individuals who do not consent or assent to participate will be asked if they are willing to provide their 
reason for declining participation; responses will be recorded on a CRF. Individuals assessed as 
ineligible for enrollment will have the reason(s) for ineligibility recorded.  
 
The study team may request tabulated information on individuals who participated in the enrollment 
process, but did not provide informed consent/assent and the reasons these individuals refused to 
participate. These data will provide general information on the population that is recruited at the SRVs 
into the study  
 After informed consent/assent is obtained, the participant will complete a CASI baseline assessment.  
For Aim 3, randomization wil l only occur AFTER a baseline assessment is completed.  
 In Aim 3, participants assigned to the intervention group will be considered enrolled in the study after 
they have completed the baseline assessment, been randomized, and completed app onboarding (for 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018

 the intervention arm). Participants assigned to the control arm will be considered enrolled in the study 
after they have completed the baseline assessment, been randomized, and been given standard of 
care materials.  
 
CRFs will be completed by [CONTACT_205909] f to capture the participant’s eligibility and enrollment.  
 
5.2 Locator/C ontact  Information 
 
 
Once  the participant is  cons ented,  designated  site study staff will complete a Contact  [CONTACT_287606]/or enter the participant’s contact [CONTACT_287607] . Participants will also be asked to provide social media contact [CONTACT_3031], 
if the participant is willing. Participants  will be asked to provi de a work ing phone number or valid email 
address  through which  they can be reached.  Participants  will also be asked  to provide valid contact  
[CONTACT_287608] a family  member  and/or friend who can be called  in the event  the participant  cannot be 
reached by [CONTACT_61529].  Particip ants will be asked  if messages  can be left at the numbers  provided.  
Study  staff will not leave messages  unless  expressly  permitted  to do so by [CONTACT_287609].  If permission  is given  to leave messages,  site study staff will assure  
participant s that messa ges left with a family  member  or friend will only ask the participant  to contact

LYNX  Intervention Condition:  Individua ls who receive LYNX  will be given  brief instructio ns on the 
purpose of the app, how to access it, and an overview  of how to use it. Participant s will be encouraged 
to explore all components  of the app and use it routinely.  Standard of Care  Condition:  Following  
screening,  participants  in both condit ions will receive standard of care prevention material  consisting 
of provision of information  regarding  recommen dations  for HIV testing  and referrals  to local HIV testing 
sites and prevention services.  
 
5.4 Intervention/Investigation Procedures  
 
 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018  
 
Page 21 of 46 
 
 5.4.1 Formative phase (Aim 1) 
 
 
To refine  the LYNX  app, we will use an iterative  developmen t design with focus  groups  (FG) and/or  in- 
depth interviews  (IDIs)  with 8-10 YMSM at each of two study  sites,  followed over 3-6 months  (up to 3 
iterations).  Using  a discussion  guide, we will demonstrate  the app and wireframes  (screenshots)  of new 
components  and elicit perspectives  in content,  layout,  usability,  and functionality.  The IMB domains  
described above will guide the development  process.  New content  to promote PrEP  uptake  may include  
PrEP educational  and testimonial  videos,  curated information  and links to PrEP websites  and discussion  
forums  (PrEP  information);  information  about  how one’s  Sex Pro score  could improve on PrEP (PrEP  
motivation);  a map with PrEP- friendly  youth providers,  and an online navigator  to assist  with trouble-  
shooting  PrEP access  issues  (PrEP behavioral  skills ). We will also elicit feedback  on the HIV/STI  testing  
kit and instructions.  We will also investigate preferences  for documentation of clinic or home -based  
HIV/STI testing (release of medical  records,  taking  pi[INVESTIGATOR_287580]).  Particip ants will 
be asked to download and test iterative versions  of the app for two weeks  prior to the next FG or IDI 
where we will gather  feedback  on the usability,  design,  and potential  impact  of the app. Study  staff will 
use an onbo arding document to walk participant s through  the download procedures  and use of the app. 
FGs and IDIs may be conducted in person,  or via video- conferencing.  Participants  will be reimbursed  
for completion of each FG or IDI according to local site guidelines.  
 
All FGs and IDIs will be conduct ed by [CONTACT_287612]/stu dy site members  and video- recorded  for 
transcription and analysis using Transana  software  by [CONTACT_25999]/SFDPH  study  staff.  The goal of the 
analysis  is to identify  barriers  and facilitators  to app usability.  If available,  members  of the app 
developmen t team  from Apt Mobility  will observe the focus  groups  via video -confer ence in case they 
need more  clarifica tion of specific  suggestions  for improving the app. Analysis  of the FG will comm ence 
immediately  after participants  leave in the form of a discussion  of salient  themes  and suggestions  
among  UCSF/SFDPH study  staff and the Apt Mobility  team.  The team  will then priori tize chang es to the 
app for the next iteration  to be tested and discussed in the next round  of focus  group discussions.  
Recordings  will be stored on a secure hard drive  in a locked cabinet.  Analysis  of the focus  groups in 
Transana does not require a transcript  since  the codes  are applied to the timeline  of the video rather  
than line numbers  in the transcript.  If further  transcription  is necessary,  selected segments of the video  
and audio interview  data from the FGs and IDIs will be transcribed by [INVESTIGATOR_8318] M Garton,  Inc., a transcription  
company  with whom  we have worked with for the past ten years.  
 
The LYNX  app will be refined by [CONTACT_287613]  (www.aptmobility.com ), the development  team  who 
created  the original  version of the Sex Pro app and has extensive experience creating health -related  
apps  with the UCSF  mHealth  group.  The LYNX  app will be developed for both iOS and Android  
platforms  simultaneously,  the two mobile  phone platforms  that make up more  than 90% of smart  phones  
in the U.S. 
 
5.4.2 Technical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (Aim 2) 
 
 
After  revisions  to the LYNX  app are completed  based on the formative  phase, we will conduct  a 2 mont h, 
single -arm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_239238] 12-15 YMSM across  two iTech  sites to optimize  the technic al 
performance  and functionality  of LYNX. YMSM who partici pated in the formative phase  may participate  
in the techni cal pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. At  an in- person  enrollment  visit, YMSM will download  the LYNX  app and answer  
an online computer assisted self -interview  (CASI ) questionnaire on sociodemographics , use of 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018

 technology, and risk behaviors.  Study  staff will walk participants  through the download proced ures and 
use of the app. Participan ts will then be encouraged  to use all app components  over the next two 
months,  including  ordering  and using  the HIV/STI  testing CareKit   at least once during the technical  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. The study will follow the STI and HIV CareKit, Condom, and Lubricant Ordering Standard 
Operating Procedures developed by [CONTACT_287614].  Additionally, the study  will also request 
participants to sign medical release forms for the release of their official testing results from the 
respective testing site so that study staff can collec t official results . Upon  completion of the technical  
pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268],  all participant s will complete  an online exit interview  with qualitative -trained study  staff to provide 
feedback  on functionality,  technical  performance,  errors  and bugs encount ered, overall  experiences  
using the app, feasibility  and acceptability  of methods  to confirm  HIV testing  results,  and feedback  for 
further  refinement.  Online  interviews  will be cond ucted using  a HIPAA- compliant,  video- chat applicati on 
that provides  strong  security components  and is easy  to use across multiple  devices.  We will also 
assess preliminary usability and acceptability of  the app using  the System Usability Scale , a validated  
assessment  tool assessing  various  domains  of the app with demonstrated high internal  consistency 
across a number  of studies . Participants  will also complete  a computer  assisted  self-interview  (CASI)  to 
assess these  measures , along with changes in risk behaviors during the study . Participants will be given  
the option to return to the SRV to complete the online exit interview and CASI or complete them online.  
Participants  will be reimbursed for the enrollment  visit and exit interview /CASI  according  to local study  
site guidelines.  All exit interv iews will be recorded  and transc ribed for analysis. 
 
Participants who seroconvert during Aim 2 (two month technical pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268])  will be offered a referral for HIV 
care, including confirmatory HIV testing  and linked to HIV care if confirmatory testing is positive; 
continue to have access to the app, and be invited to complete the follow -up CASI assessment and the 
exit interview.  A referral for l inkage to care will be offered by  [CONTACT_287615] A set of questions will be 
asked regarding the participant’s experience, particular ly as it pertains to app use and linkage to care.  
 
5.4.[ADDRESS_350754] (Aim 3) 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening and Enrollment  
 
Potentially  eligible  participants  will attend an enrollment  visit where eligibili ty is confirmed,  the details  
of the study  will be explai ned, and informed  consent obtained. Participants who  partici pated in formative  
and/or  technical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_287581].  Eligib le 
participant s will complet e a basel ine computer  assisted self-interview  (CASI)  of HIV risk behavior,  
HIV/STI  knowledge,  utiliza tion of STI/HIV  prevention services,  PrEP  knowledge and attitudes,  
psychosoci al measures  (including depression,  substance  use, stigma,  social  suppor t), and HIV risk 
perception and will be enrolled  in the study  on the same day if possible.  Participants  will be randomized  
to receive LYNX (intervention)  vs. the standard  of care (control)  in a 2:1 ratio (see randomization  
procedures  in section  5.2). This design was chosen to maximize  collectio n of accept ability data among 
app users.  Participants  who have completed the baseline assessment, have been 
randomized, and complete app onboarding (intervention arm) or receive the standard of care 
information about HIV/STI testing and PrEP (control arm)  will be cons idered enrol led in the study.  All 
enroll ed participant s will receive counseling  on the importance of HIV testing  per local testing guidelines.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] LYNX  Intervention Arm 
 
Study  staff will assist  participants  in downloadi ng the mobile  app, provide  instruction on its use, and 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350755] visit, and can subseque ntly be upda ted by 
[CONTACT_3445] s if desired.  Participants  will be encour aged to explore  and use other  components  of the app, 
the Sex Pro score,  PrEP videos,  sexual history diary, chat feature, and geo-location featur es. 
Users  receive  quarterly  HIV/STI testing reminders  using  the mobile  device notification  feature.  For 
confi dentiality  purposes,  reminder  notifications  are nonspecific,  but inside  the app the partici pant is 
linked to their customizable  testing reminder.   Reminders  include two options  for testing:  (1) the 
ability  to order a home  HIV/STI  testing kit to be mailed  free of charge, or (2) a geo-located  map of the 
closest  HIV/STI testing sites. PrEP uptake  components  will be finalized in the formative  phase of this 
study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Control  Arm 
 
Participants  randomized to the contr ol condi tion will be instruc ted to access HIV/STI testing at existing 
sites in the community.  They  will be provided with a list of these testing sites, along with an 
informational  brochure about  PrEP.  All particip ants will be provided access to Sex Pro (risk assessment  
tool that is part of LYNX  and will be made available online)  after complet ion of the study. 
 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Follow-up 
 
 
All enrolled participant s will be followed for 24 weeks.  After enrollment,  all follow-up visits  will occur  
online,  with SMS  reminders , email,  and phone follow -up conducted as needed to ensure completion  of 
study  procedures.  Participants  will complete  an online  CASI  at 12 and 24 weeks and receive a stipend 
for completion of procedu res at each  study  visit. Visit windows will b e approximately 14 days before/afte r 
the targe t date.  Participants  will also be able to obtain additional  home HIV self-test kits during  the study  
follow -up, if neede d. At the [ADDRESS_350756] plus up  to 20 
participants  randomized to the LYNX  arm will participate  in an in-depth interview conducted  by 
[CONTACT_25999] /SFDPH  study  staff via video- confer encing.  The purpose of this interview  is to elicit feedback  
on their experiences  using  the app, any technical  difficultie s encountered,  and how the app could  be 
further  improve d. Participant s will be selected for interviews  using purposive samplin g base d on 
level of enga gement  with the app, whether partici pants compl eted HIV/STI  testing  and/or  initiated PrEP  
during the study,  and to achieve diversity  based on sociodemographics  (e.g. age, race/ethnici ty). 
Additionally, we will offer interviews  to all participants who have a confirmed HIV diagnosis . In addition 
to asking about their experiences using the app, these participants will also be asked about additional 
information or support that would have been helpful at the time of receiving a posi tive HIV test result, 
and their experiences in getting linked to HIV care. By [CONTACT_287616],  the goal is to select  “information -rich cases from which  one can learn  a great  deal about  
issues of central  importance  to the purpose of the researc h.”[ADDRESS_350757] more objective measures of HIV and STI 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350758] release is not a requirement of enrollment —participants may refuse without being withdrawn 
from the study.  SRV staff will not review the medical records of participants w ho do not sign a medical 
record release  form. For participants who do sign medical record release form(s), o nly records verifying 
HIV and STI testing information, and records related to PrEP initiation  will be requested. The period of 
abstraction will beg in at the baseline visit and end up to [ADDRESS_350759] study CRFs with study ID will be completed us ing the medical records,  and al l medical 
records will be immediately de- identified (black out any identifiers) and labeled with study ID.

that involve human subjects,  and an y future study staff will do so upon hiring. Traini ng for all r esearch 
staff includes (but is not limited  to) an overview  of the study, study  procedures  and human subjects 
issues  (informed  consent  process,  confidentialit y), a demonstration of all technology  compo nents,  
methods  for establishi ng comfort  with the sensi tive issues,  including  discussion  of sexual  behaviors,  
that will likely arise  in the course  of the focus  groups  or assessments,  review  of the study  instruments,  
their requir ed elements  and the inherent  flexibility  built into them,  Hum an Subjects  Protection,  Good  
Clinical Practice,  informed consent,  quality  manageme nt, confidentiality,  and reporting of adverse  
events.  As appropriate,  site research staff will conduct  mock  visits of study  procedures  prior to 
enrollment  of study  participants.  
 
5.6 Intervention Monitori ng/Quality  Control  
 
 
A study  checkl ist will be used to ensure that the resea rch staff member  assists participants in 
downloading  the app, provides  instruction on its use, and explains  the relevant  app features  and sets 
up customizable featur es (e.g.,  reminders  for HIV testing).  
 
App analytics,  including  logins  to the app and use of different  app components,  will be monitored  for 
the technic al pi[INVESTIGATOR_287582] t his project. Any issues that  are detected will be  discussed  
with the protocol  team and site research  staff, and a remediation plan will be developed and 
implement ed at the sites.

6.3.4 Premature  Discontinuation/Off -Study evaluat ions/measures  
 
 
Participants  enrolled in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_287583], but 
prior to the completion  of the final study  visit, will complete a Premature  Study  Discontinuat ion visit 
within  four weeks  after the decision to prematurely  discontinue from the study is made and will include 
all week  24 visit procedur es as approp riate.  
 
The princip al investigat or has the authority  to withdraw  any participant  at any time if it his/her  opi[INVESTIGATOR_287584]. The participant  will be informed of this withdrawal  
and explained the rationale. Withdr awal will be documented in the study  tracking  system. 
 
Participants  will be prematurely  discontinued from the study  if any of the following  occurs:  
 
• The participant  withdraws  consent/assen t; 
• The participant is unwilling or unable to comply with study procedures ; 
• The investigator  believes  that ongoing participation  may cause harm  to the participant  or study  
staff;  
• The investigator believes that ongoing participation may impact the integrity of the study data;  
• The study  is cancelled by [CONTACT_18121] (or iTech,  or other  administrative  entity); 
• The study is cancelled for other  administrative  reasons;  or 
• Death of the subject  
 
Subjects  who are prematurely  disco ntinued from the study  may be allowed to re-enroll  into the study on 
a caseby[CONTACT_413] . The Protoc ol Team  will review  the number  of slots opened for replac ements on 
a monthly  basis,  or more  frequently,  as needed.  
 
Participants who seroconvert during the study enrollment will not be discontinued from the study and

6.4             Clinical and Laboratory  Evaluati ons 
 
Home HIV/STI  testing  will be offered  as part of the technical  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_287585].  This 
will include the Oraquick  HIV in-home test kit and an STI self-collec tion kit for urine,  pharyngeal,  and 
rectal  swabs for gonorrhea and chlamydia  testing and a microtube  for blood collection  for syphilis  
testing.  All specimens  will be sent via a mailer  with pre-paid postage to the Kraft  Laboratory  at Emory  
University,  a CLIA -certified  laboratory  with extensive experi ence testing home -collected  specimens  and 
high sensiti vity and specificity  (>95%)  for home -collected STI testing.  Any participant  who tests  positive  
on a test from a home specimen  collec tion will be contact[CONTACT_287621].  Positive STI results, including 
confirmatory HIV, are reported to the local health department , and participants are  notified of this in the 
assent/ consent form.  
 
7.0  DATA COL LECTION  AND SITE  MONI TORING 
 
 
7.1 Development  of Protocol and Case  Report  Forms  
 
 
The Management  Core,  in collabor ation with the Protocol  Team, is respo nsible  for the development  of 
this protocol as well as the Case  Report  Forms  (CRFs)  needed  to collect  the information  required  to 
implement  this protocol  
 
7.2 Data  Records  
 
 
Participant -related study  information  will be ident ified through a study  ID number  (SID) and participant 
code comprised o f the first letter of the participant’s first name [CONTACT_287639]- digit day of birth  on all participant  
CRFs,  audio files, and Computer  Assisted  Self Interview (CASI)  files. All study -related  information will 
be kept in double- locked,  limited  access areas  at each  study  site. Participant names and their SID 
and participant codewill be stored separate from other study information in SMART, accessible 
only to designated study staff, iTech site monitors, and representatives from the NICHD.  SIDs will 
not be entered int o the mobile app and instead a unique app ID will be assigned to each participant and 
used when logging into the app. These unique App IDs will be provided by [CONTACT_125471]. Original  
source  documents  for individual  participant s will be maintained at the respective SRV and will be 
accessi ble only to the study staff. Data  from original  source  documents  will be transcribed  on CRFs as 
applicable.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_350764]  copi[INVESTIGATOR_287586] 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350765] will be complet ed by

windows  (including survey  completi on) will be approximately  14 days  before and after the target  date,  
however  surveys  may be completed  out of window  up until the next visit window  opens.  We use SSL 
encryption for transfers  of information online and data will be stored  in the secure,  HIPAA- compliant  
servers  of SurveyGizmo.  The Emory  AC team  maintains  a business  partner  HIPAA agreement  with 
SurveyGizmo.  The partici pant’s  unique  SID#  will be used  in order  to link the interview  responses  to the 
partic ipant’s  CRF data.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_350766] participant  locat ion in order  to identify  nearby [CONTACT_287622],  but will 
not access  other private  information  on the user’s  mobile  phone.  We will maintain electronic  information  
on a secu re Amazon Web Service  Cloud  (AWS),  a secured  environment  that supports  HIPAA  
compliance (as well as Business  Associate  Agreement)  and has been approved for US gover nment 
projects  that include highly sensitive  personally  identifiable information.  Information  collected  through  
the app will be encrypted  while  on the mobile  phone and during transit  to our secure servers;  users  will 
access the mobile  app through  a secure pass word-protect ed log-in. 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_350767] the option to use VSee in several formats:  face- to-face video  
chat,  video chat in which  they can see the interviewer  but the interviewer  cannot  see them,  audio chat 
only,  or a text-based  conversation.  VSee  is compatible on PCs,  tablets,  and smartphones.  Unlike  
other  video- chat platforms  (e.g.,  Skype),  VSee is HIPAA- compliant.  VSee  includes  the following  
functions  to protect  users:  
 
End-to-end encryption without  a man-in-the-middle listene r. In WebEx,  Vidyo,  Tand berg,  and Polycom  
architectur es, media is sent to a server  (also  called  a video relay  or MCU).  Although  encryption is 
applied from the user’s  computer  to these serve rs, the servers  still have full access to the user’s  medi a. 
In contrast,  VSee  uses  end-to-end encryption where no server,  including VSee  servers,  has the 
decryption key. VSee  uses public/pr ivate RSA keys to exchange  a 256-bit AES session  key with the 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350768] the AES session  key. VSee  uses  FIPS  140-2 certified  256-bit 
AES encrypt ion. 
 
One port. VSee  uses  a single  port for call signaling and media.  The VSee  protocol  is structured  so that 
only the outgoing  port needs  to be open becau se return traffic is always  structured  as respon ses to 
outgoing traffic. This allo ws administrators  to set  a policy where if users i nside their ne twork are using  
VSee,  then their firewall  lets VSee  traffic  secur ely cross  the firewall;  however,  if users  inside  their firewall  
stop using  VSee, then the firewall will block  external port scans. 
 
Automatic HTTP/SSL  tunneling.  VSee  prefers  to use UDP  since  it allows higher  performance  video.  
However,  if the firewall  does not allow UDP,  VSee will automatically  switch  to HTTP/SSL  tunneling . 
 
Cloud  Control . VSee's  cloud solution allows  enterprises  to maintain central control  of their security  
policie s to a large  number  of end points  even though  the service  is hosted by [CONTACT_112504].  It does  this by 
[CONTACT_287623],  where the policies  are controlled.  
The cloud servers  determine  whether  any of these security  policies  should be applied and enforces  
them  at the VSee  client.  This allows  us to set our own securi ty settings  and to record  the sessio ns. 
 
No-install client . Video conferencing  software  clients tend to be large  and to leave a big footprint  on the 
user’s  system. Almost  all of them  require  administrator  permissio ns to install.  Once  the client  software  
gains  administrator  permissions,  they  can  sever ely  compro mise  computer  securit y.  VSee  is  a 
lightweight  client  that does not requi re administrator  permissions  or installation.  
 
VSee  offers  the HIPAA- required Business  Associate  Agreement  (BAA)  where VSee  agrees  to be 
responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_287587] t information  secure and to immediately  report  any breach of personal  
health information.  In this study,  the iTech  Technology  Core  will enter  into a BAA with VSee,  and this 
will be extended to cover  the proposed  activities.  The VSee  sessions  will include ident ifying  information  
(e.g.,  images  of the participant,  voice  recordin gs). All identi fying information  will be stripped from the 
recorded VSee  sessions  before they are sent to the analysis  team for content  analysis.  
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_350769] face -to-face video chat, video chat in 
which they can see the interviewer, but the interviewer cannot see them, or audio chat only. Zoom is compatible on PCs, tablets, and smartphones; as well as maintains the option to conduct an audio 
conference without the video component. University of [LOCATION_004], San Francisco has entered into a 
BAA with Zoom, where Zoom agrees to be responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_287588] (PHI).  
 End-to-end encryption . Zoom encrypts all presentation content at the application layer using the 
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 -bit algorithm. Zoom end- to-end (E2E) chat encryption 
allows for a secured communication where only the intended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_112465]. 
Zoom uses public and private keys to encrypt the  chat session with Advance Encryption Standard 
(AES256), and session keys are generated with device unique hardware ID to avoid data being read 
from other devices. This ensures that the session cannot be eavesdropped or tampered with.

 Cloud Control Infras tructure . A distributed network of low -latency multimedia routers (software) 
resides on Zoom’s communications infrastructure. With these low -latency multimedia routers, all 
session data originating from the host’s device and arriving at the participants’ devices is dynamically 
switched — never stored persistently through the Zoom communications infrastructure. Zoom’s 
communications infrastructure for real -time video, audio, and data communications resides on Zoom 
dedicated servers, which are housed in SSAE 16 SOC2 compliant datacenters on opposite sides of the US. Zoom sessions are completely temporary and operate analogously to the popular mobile 
conversation over the public mobile network. In addition to unique security beneﬁts, Zoom’s 
communications infrastructure also enables an extremely scalable and highly available meeting 
infrastructure unrestricted by [CONTACT_112506].  
 
The Zoom client communicates with the multimedia router to establish a reliable and secure 
connection. At the time of instantiation, the Zoom client will determine the best method for 
communication, attempting to connect automatically using udp and tcp port 8801, 8802 and 8804 or 
HTTPS (port 443/TLS).  
 The Zoom sessions will contain identifying information, as in VSee above, but this information will be 
be stripped form the recorded Zoom sessions before they are sent to the analysis team for content analysis.

such  as completion or discontinua tion, HIV/STI testing history and results  from medi cal 
records,  study  laboratory  results,  and adverse  events  (AE).  AC staff will work  with study  investigato rs 
and the MC to devel op and design the CRFs.  During study  conduct,  the SRVs will main tain the CRFs  in 
secured locatio ns, and transmit  CRF data to the AC using  DataFax,  a leading  multi- site database  
environm ent for HIV RCT.  DataFa x can receive and transcribe  CRF data via fax and scan,  or allow for 
direct  data entry. It provides  for monitoring  form comp letion and data- quality,  and a system  for data 
querying  and resolution  with SRVs,  while  maintaining an audit  trail. The AC uses  DataFax  for MSM  
studies  and RCT and maintains  a DataFax  Linux  server  at Emory.  
 
7.4.2 Audio/Video Data  
 
 
We will conduct  focus  groups  (FGs)  (in Aim 1) and  in-depth interviews (IDIs)  (in Aims 1, 2, and 3)  to 
evaluate the overall  relevan ce of the app to YMSM and identify  ways  to adapt specific  features  of the app 
to promote  STI testin g, PrEP uptake and PrEP  adherence  among YMSM.  FGs and IDIs will be 
conduct ed in person or using  VSee  or other HIPAA compliant,  IRB approved method  for video-  
conferenci ng. Video  will enable us to better  interpret comments  about  specific  features of the interface  
and to be able to determine who said what  over the course of the iterative  FGs. All  participant s will be 
provided with a pseudo nym on a name [CONTACT_287640].  Audio and v ideo data will be recor ded in person using  a digital video recorder  or using  the 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350771]  that will be kept in a locked office 
by [CONTACT_25999]/SFDPH study  staff. If necessary,  portions  of the videos  and/or audio that requi re transcript ion 
will be sent to our transcription service,  PaulMGarton.c om using  a secure,  encrypted filebox  provid ed 
by [CONTACT_287624] .com embedded on the PaulMGarton.c om site. Transcripts  of the FGs and IDIs will not 
use the names  of the particip ants, only their pseudonyms  for FGs or study  ID for the IDIs. 
 
7.4.3  Retention Data  
 
 
The study will use a HIPAA -compliant web- based platform entitled Study Management and Retention 
Toolkit (SMART), which is a SaaS (Software as a Service) based mobile application aiding studies with 
various aspects of participant recruitment, study implementation, and retention. The application has the 
ability to securely manage participant information across multiple studies and customers 
simultaneously, stratifying participant information by [CONTACT_112512]. SMART includes an admin web 
portal and a participant facing mobile app (optional), which allows for secure messaging, study calendar 
management, self -scheduling by [CONTACT_4317], secure photo uploads, and longitudinal tracking of 
participants from screening to study completion. The ability to designate specific roles to all SMART 
users allows for greater control around permissions and accessibility to participant information. Users 
can even be limited to a reporting only role, which allows for study oversight through real time aggregate 
reporting, but no access to PHI. SMART is a licensed service of the Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) 
at Emory University, Prevention Science Core. Utilization of the mobile app is optional and the admin 
web portal will fully function without it.  
 
The following information outlines the security of the three SMART components: (1) the admin web 
portal, (2) the participant app, and (3) a web service that acts as a liaison between the mobile app and 
the study database.  
 
Admin Web Portal.  The admin web portal is a web- based appli cation developed using Microsoft .NET 
technologies. It uses SQL server as backend database. The application requires two servers to host: 
(1) Web server [Windows server with IIS] and (2) SQL server [Standard or Enterprise version]. Both 
these servers are t o be placed behind a firewall. Web server will have a public IP to access the server 
using VPN. SSL certificate is to be installed on the web server. The admin website will be rendered over SSL (https).  
 
The application uses form authentication (no integrated authentication such as AD). All passwords are 
stored encrypted within the database. System will also be using database level encryption, which will 
prevent any copying of information from one database to another. Web application also uses an 
automatic logout feature after a certain period of inactivity. By [CONTACT_15094], the inactivity duration is set to 
three minutes.  
 
Study staff can only first gain access to the admin web portal if granted by a study or site administrator. 
Their assigned user role will det ermine their permissions to perform different actions and even view 
PHI. Email notifications are sent from the system (without the need to login) when: (1) a staff member 
requests to reset their password, (2) role assignments to a study are made, (3) an ev ent/visit staff are 
scheduled to work is nearing, (4) a new task is assigned to a staff member, or (5) they are designated 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350772] results. All participant communications are performed 
using secure messaging thr ough the message center (inbox) implementation within the mobile app. If 
the mobile app is not utilized by a study, communications are sent as standard email or text messages to participants.  
 
Mobile App.  The mobile app, developed natively for iOS and Andr oid platforms and available for free 
in the App Store and Google Play Store, is an optional feature the study can utilize for self -scheduling, 
communication, photo uploads, and updating contact [CONTACT_3031]. The study will indicate during the  
initial setup  within the admin web portal whether the participant mobile app is utilized or not. If the app 
is utilized, participants will receive download instructions after their information is entered into the admin 
web portal. Only participants listed in an active study who validate their email or phone number against 
the contact [CONTACT_112513]. For validation, 
the app uses both traditional form authentication as well as social login (Facebook and Goog le). The 
social login feature will only work if the email associated with either social account matches the contact 
[CONTACT_112514]. The app does not request anything other than basic information 
from these authentication services. Participants cannot “remember” their password on the mobile device 
for automatic logins to ensure privacy. All participant data and activity status is maintained within a secure and encrypted SQL Server database. To create the connection between the admin web portal and the mobile app, each participant is assigned a unique ID within the application, which is associated 
with their login credentials. When a participant has been successfully authenticated through the mobile 
app, the admin web portal will send their specific information to their phone through the established 
secure session (web APIs using SSL). The app will not store the information presented locally on the phone. Local data storage is used only for storing some minimal non -PHI information, such as app 
settings. The mobile app implements an automatic logout when there is inactivity for more than three 
minutes. If a participant should need to re -download the app on a new device, login and password 
authentication will be required again.  
 
The mobile app has push notifications that are primarily used for reminders and notifications of new 
messages. Push notifications displayed on the participant’s phone will be generic in nature and not contain any PHI. Reminders and notifications within the mobile app inbox will also be generic in nature, 
with any message containing sensitive information requiring a pin, established during registration as a 
secondary authentication, to open within the mobile app. Firebase cloud messaging service is used as 
a communication channel for these notifications. No PHI is passed through Firebase. Push notifications 
are customizable in the study setup, and samples of system notifications include: “You have a new 
message in your inbox,” “You have an upcoming event for March 7, 2018,” and “You have a pending 
task.”  
 
Web Service.  A web service will also be hosted on the web server. This service is used by [CONTACT_146353]. The service will utilize secure socket layer (SSL) for 
communication.

Site monitors  from the MC will visit participating  study  sites to review  a selected portion of the individual  
participant  records,  including  asse nt/consent  forms, CRFs,  and suppor ting source  documentation to 
ensure the protection of study  subjects,  complia nce with the protocol,  and accur acy and complet eness  
of records.  Regulatory  files, as required, will also be inspec ted to ensure  that regulatory  requirements  
are being followed.  
 
The site investigator  will make  study  documents  (e.g., cons ent forms,  case  report  forms)  and pertinent

8.0 PARTICIPAN T MANAGEMENT  
 
 
8.1 Tracking  Participants/Foll ow-up 
 
 
All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_1006] 2 weeks prior to their target  date for a follow -up visit to 
complete  study visit procedures;  additional  reminders  will be provided on/after  the target  date as 
needed to ensure  completion of study  visit proce dures.  Multi ple contact [CONTACT_287625] (e.g.,  mail,  alternate  phone numbers,  e-mail,  text message,  social media 
contact [CONTACT_3031]).  Subjects  will be asked whether  or not messages  can be left for each  of the 
phone numbers  that they provide.  They  will be informed  that messages  will not contain any information 
regard ing the nature of the project. 
 
8.2 Compensation  
 
 
The decisi ons around  compensation  will be determined separately  by [CONTACT_112497], listed in the SRV’s 
informed consent/assent form,  and approved by [CONTACT_287626], the IRB of Record (the UNC- CH IRB).  
 
The web-based CASI  survey and online exit /in-depth interview  will be conducted online, however 
participants will be able to come into the SRV  to complete these procedures if preferred on SRV 
computers or tablets .   Site study staff will be notified  when a subject  has completed  a CASI  survey  and 
online exit /in-depth interview  on his own and the compensation will be provided to the participant.  
Compensation can be provided in person, or  sent to participants  electronic ally or via mail,  if allowed at 
the SRV.

 8.3 Intervening  on “Social  Harms"  
 
 
Focus  groups, intervi ews, and surveys will contain quest ions regard ing stigma  and other  personal  
experiences,  and some participant s may be uncomfortable  answeri ng certain questions.  Social,  
psychological,  and interpersonal  harms  may include being discriminated,  feeling  stigmatized,  emotional  
distress,  as well as feelings  of discomfort  and embarrassm ent. Additionally,  this study  involves provision  
of home HIV/STI  testing which  may cause participants  to worry  or become anxious.  If the HIV/STI  test 
results  are reactive (e.g.,  a “preliminary  positive”  on the HIV rapid  antibody  test), participan ts may 
become  depressed or feel anxious.  
 
All study  sites have specific  policies  governing the treatment  of human  subjects.  These policies  specify 
that medical and psycho logical assistance will be available in the immediate environ ment in the event  
a participant  should experience any adverse  reactions  resulting  from study  procedures.  
 
While  participants  will be informed  that they may refuse  to answer  any question at any time,  responses  
or reactions  to certain questions  may indicate  distress  on the part of the particip ants. Partici pants 
experiencing  mild distress  during  a study  visit will be offered  a small  break  or to resch edule the interview  
at later date. In the unlikely  event  that a participant experiences  considerable distress they will be 
offered a voluntary  clinical assessment  and/or  counseling  on site. Study  staff will be trained to make  
appropriate referrals  for clinical care in cons ultation  with the PIs or designee to help participant s cope  
with any feelings  and/or  questions  they have which may arise.  
 
If at any time during  the study,  a participant  divulges  that he is at risk for harm,  including but not limited  
to being abused or experiencing  violence, if harm  is suspect ed or likely,  or if the participant  states  he is 
suicid al/homicidal,  measures  will be taken to ensure his safety . Reporti ng will be done as appropriate  
to the situation and the legal  statutes,  including reporti ng to child protection  agencies  or other  
appropriate  agencies  and referrals  will be provided to appropriate support, counseling,  or treatment  
resources.  
 
 
 
9.[ADDRESS_350775] follow  their own IRB’s  procedu re for reporting and managing untoward  
effects.  
 
There  are two types  of untoward effects  to be identified:  (1) those related to the participant,  and (2) 
those related to the study staff.  
 
First,  the study will catalogue any untoward effect  related to the participant  as a result  of study  
participation , including  use of the LYNX  app and home  HIV/STI  testing. Reporting is requi red for 
occurrences  including  social harms,  psychological  distress,  and serious  life threateni ng events  such  as 
suicide  attempts.  These  may be immediately  apparent  to the study  staff,  such  as the participant’s  
emotional  upset  requiri ng referral  for counseling ; or they may be delay ed and reported later to study  
staff, such  as physical  harm to an individual  for having participated in the study.  Study  staff will notify  
the protocol  team  of these untoward effects  using the iTech QNS  accessible  through the iTech website  
(www.itechnetwork.org).  Study  staff will be briefed  during the training  on the scope of possible  untoward  
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350776]  include cataloguing these events  as well. The protocol  chairs  should  be 
notified of these events  so that they may be immediately  addressed,  evaluated,  and guidance modified  
or expanded to minimize  similar  risk to other  study staff.

10.1.1 Formative Phase (Aim 1) 
 
 
FGs and IDIs will be conducted  in person or remotely  using  VSee  app or Zoom  (or other  HIPAA -
compliant, IRB approved video- conferenci ng app).  The initial FGs will be facilitated by [CONTACT_287627] F/SFDPH  
study staff in person at the iTech  sites in Tampa and Chicago.  In person IDIs by [CONTACT_25999]/SFDPH  study  
staff may also be conducted during  the site visit, schedules  and time permitting.  Subsequent  FGs and 
IDIs will be conducted  using the VSee app to maximize  the flexibility  of the data collec tion in the context  
of iterative  app development.  If possibl e, members  of the LYNX  design  and development  team  may 
also participat e in the follow-up FGs and IDIs to probe about specific  features  and app preferences.  
The FGs and IDIs will be video-  recorded to capture  YMSM feedback  and allow  ability  to distinguish  
different  spea kers.  Video also provides  important  contextual  information  on participant  reactions  when  
viewing  and commenting  on specif ic features of the app interface.  After  each  interview,  a short  debrief ing 
form will be completed by [CONTACT_287628],  
requested  features  from the interview,  and the overall  usefulne ss of the information  obtained for iterative 
design of the app. These  debrief  forms  will serve  as a summ ary of the interviews  and will guide the 
researche rs on what  videos  or parts  of the videos  to transcribe  and/or  review  for the app developers.  
The goal of the analysis  will be to evalua te the overal l relevance of the app to YMSM and identify  ways  
to adapt  specific  features of the app to promote  STI testing,  PrEP  uptake,  and PrEP adherence  among  
YMSM.  The team  will meet  weekly  to discuss emerging  findin gs and whether  changes  to the interview  
guide  are necessary.  Data  from these focus  groups  and IDIs will be used to iteratively  refine  the app, 
intervention protocol,  and assessment  tools  prior to the technical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_287579] 2. 
 
10.1.2 Technical  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (Aim 2)  
 
 
All exit interviews from the technical  pi[INVESTIGATOR_287590]. Quali tative  data will be analyz ed by 
[CONTACT_287629] [ADDRESS_350777] (Aim 3)  
 
 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018

 Response rates to follow-up surveys  will be tabulated  by [CONTACT_287630]. We  will characterize the study  popul ation  
using descriptive statistics  and compare  the intervention and control  groups  at baseline using t-, 
Wilcoxon,  and chi-squa re tests.  Point estimates  for mean  SUS score  ≥ 50 and for proportion accessing  
the app >0.[ADDRESS_350778] ent with 
industry  standards .49,50 A secondary  feasibility  outcome  will be achieved if ≥50% of participants  who 
open the app comple te their personalized risk score  at least  once.  
 
The secondary outcomes of preliminary efficacy of the LYNX app to increase HIV/STI testing (any 
testing over follow -up) and PrEP uptake (as described above) will be evaluated using unadjusted risk 
ratios for each outcome. If there is evidence of divergence from balance in measured baseline 
covariates (i.e., failure of randomization), post -hoc analyses using Poisson regression with robust 
standard errors will be used to estimate adjusted risk ratios. Outcome variables will represent any HIV 
testing and any P rEP uptake over the follow -up period. Separate models will be estimated for each 
outcome.52 
 
With 60 participants  randomized 2:1 to intervention:  control,  and 10-20% attrition,  we will have  80% 
power  to detect  37-42 percentage point  incre ases in HIV testing  and PrEP  uptake,  depending  on 
rates  in controls.  The lack of precision  and large  minimum  detectable  effec ts, typi[INVESTIGATOR_287591], 
will entail  careful interp retation  of study  results  in the light of overall  patterns,  plausibility,  and findings  
from other  mHealth  studi es. 
 
Qualitative  data from exit interviews  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_287631] 1 and will inform  efforts  to finalize app revisions  and prepare for efficacy  evaluation of the app. 
 
Note:  Any deviations  from the analysis  plans outlined above or in the sectio ns that follow  will be 
documented  and justified in the Statistical  Analysis  Plan developed for this protocol.  
 
 
10.[ADDRESS_350779] ep will be to  assess  the extent and pattern of  missing data. If data are missing  
for only a few cases,  then data analysis will be conducted only on study  participants  with complete data.  
However,  when such  a strategy  would result  in loss of data from a substantial  proportion of participants,  
or if this approach would lead to biased or inaccurate  results,  then some  form of imputation will be 
performed.  The form of imputation used  will depend on the nature  of the data that are missi ng. For 
example,  data that are collected repeatedly  might be imputed using the “last value carried  forward”  
method;  and in some  instances,  interpolation between neighboring point s might  also be used.  
 
When  the primary  endpo int is missi ng, one data analysis  will be conduc ted using  only cases  with the 
endpoint.  Subsequent  analysis  will be done  where missing  endpoints  are imputed.  Hot-deck  imputation  
or regressi on imputation may also be used in this context.  
 
11.0 HUMAN SUBJECTS  
 
 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018  
 
Page 38 of 46 
 
 This study  will be conducted  in compliance with the protocol,  ICH Good Clinical Practice  guidelines,  
and 45 CFR Part 46. 
 
11.1 Participants’ Confidentiality  
 
 
 
All records with personally identifying information will be kept  in a locked, limited access area (such as 
a locked file cabinet)  or in a secure limited access database (such as SMART) . All computer entry and 
networking programs will be done with coded numbers only. Clinical information will not be released 
without wri tten permission of the participant, except as necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_112528].  
 
Every effort  will be made to ensure that study  participants  are protected from risks.  
 
Breach of Confidential ity: A potential  risk to participants  is violation  of confidentiality.  We will take the 
utmost  caution to protect  the confid entiality  of all responses.  We will minimize  this risk by [CONTACT_287632].  
 
We will inform  participants  to only use first names  or nickn ames during  the focus  groups  and that all 
information  discussed  during  the focus  groups  will be used to develop general  themes  and will not be 
linked  to any specific  person.  The focus  group s will be conducted by [CONTACT_287633]. We also ask particip ants not 
to discuss any information  from the focus  group s once they leave.  Participants  also have the right at 
any time to decide not to participate or answer  questions.  
 
All audio/video files will be kept confidential  and stored in a limited access folder on Box, accessible  only 
to study  staff. All members  of the research  team  will be trained in confidenti ality and have signed  
confidentiality  agreements.  A profess ional transcription service,  experienced in the handl ing of 
confidential data,  will be used to fully transcribe  verbatim  all audio/video files. 
 
Study  staff at all sites are trained  in confidentiality  and have signed  confidentiality  agreements.  Study  
staff have  been  trained  in ethical  human subjec ts research  techniques  in order to  minimize  participant  
risk as much  as possible.  
 
Participants  may be concerned  about  the security  of their data,  particularly  since  it is collected and 
stored  electronically.  The Analytic  Core  has significant  experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_287592] -based studi es, and we will take a varie ty of steps  to ensure participant  secu rity, including  using  
a dedicated server  behind a firewall,  encryption of data,  separation of identifiers  from responses,  and 
password- protected access to data.  Therefore,  we believe that this risk will be minimal. 
 
All data collected  by [CONTACT_287634]:  All data 
stored on a user’s  device will be encrypted,  as will all data stored in the research database.  The 
encrypted  MySQL  database will be stored  in the Amazon  Web Service  Cloud  (AWS),  a secured  
environment  that supports  HIPAA compliance (as well as Business  Associate  Agreements)  and has 
been approved for US governm ent projec ts that include highly  sensitive  personally identi fiable  
information.  All data transfers  between a user’s  mobile  device and the research  database  will be 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018  
 
Page 39 of 46 
 
 encrypted and transmitted  via Secure Socket  Layer  (SSL ); and external  systems will only have access  
to speci fic fields  (or objects) nec essary  to accomplish  the research objectives.  Data  download access 
will be on an as-needed  basis  to designated  individuals  within the resear ch organizat ion which  may be 
limited  by [CONTACT_132379],  further  ensuring  data is not downloaded by [CONTACT_130572].  All 
administrative  interfaces  are accessed  through SSL ensuring that data are safe,  secure,  and available  
only to registered users.  
 
Participants interested in ordering home STI testing kits (i.e. CareKits) or condoms/lubricants will be 
directed to a separate data collection instrument on SurveyGizmo. After selecting the items they would 
like to order, participants will be asked to prov ide names, mailing addresses, and preferred contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (email or cell phone number for SMS). This personal information will be used only for the 
purposes of fulfilling the order, confirming participation in the study and returning lab testing results, 
and will be kept in a password- protected file on a secure drive.  STI testing lab results will be posted to 
HIPAA- compliant web- based platform SMART in Aim 3 for participants to access (see Section 7.4.  3 
for more information on SMART).  
 
 
11.2 Certific ate of Confidentiality  
 
 
This research specif ically targets  a vulnerable population,  children (YMSM  ages  15-17). We will take 
every  available step to minimize  the risk of identifying/lin king data being subpoenaed,  stolen,  or 
inadvertently  released.  First,  the iTech will reque st a Certific ate of Confidentiality  from the NIH. Second,  
all resear ch staff members  are required to complete ethic al clearance certification  regarding protection  
of human’s  subjects  through  their relevant  IRBs.  Third,  all studies  will have documented procedures  to 
safeguard  against  the risk of the linking  information  being  stolen by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_287593] a locked  
spaces  to which  only essential  study personnel  who have complet ed CITI certification  for human 
subjects  research ethics  training  (http://citiprogr am.org) will have  access.  
 
A Certificate  of Confidentiality  for the iTech  will be sought  prior to enrolling  participant s. As noted  on the 
NIH website (http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/COC/faqs.htm#187),  a Certificate  of Confidentiality  will 
help the research team  “...avoid compelled ‘involuntary  disclosure’  (e.g., subpoenas)  of names  and 
other  identi fying information  about  any individual  who participates  as a research  subject (i.e., about 
whom  the investigator  maintains  identifying information)  during  any time the Certific ate is in effec t.” We 
have applied for and received  Certificates  of Confidentiality  for other  NIH-funded research  projects,  and 
given  the sensitive  nature of the data collected  for this projec t, do not foresee difficulty securing  one for 
this study.  
 
11.3 Risks and  Benefits  
 
 
11.3.1 Risks  
 
 
Risks  to participants  in this research  study  may include:  
 
The measurements  that are involved in this study require  fingerstick  to collect blood samples.  This 
procedure  may cause  local discom fort, bleeding , or bruising;  rarely small clot or infection  can occur  at 
the fingerstick  site. This measurement  should not be cons idered great er than minimal risk in and of 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/2018  
 
Page 40 of 46 
 
 itself given  its routine use in general  health care delivery.  
 
Participants  may also feel discomfort  or pain with collection  of pharyngeal  or rectal  STI specimens.  This 
risk will be minimized  through  providing  written  and video instructions  to participant s. 
 
To minimize  the risk of participants  feeling  uncomfortable about  answering personal  questions,  we will 
use Compu ter Assisted  Self Interview  (CASI)  methods  for the study's  surveys.  In CASI,  participants  
read survey  questions  on a laptop computer  or mobile  phone and use a combination of mouse click and 
keyboard/touchscreen entry to input  the answer s themselves.  Study  staff may be available to assist 
participant s with  questi ons or  techni cal difficultie s on the CASI.  Particip ants will also be able to refuse  
to answer  any question that makes  them  uncomfortable.  In-depth  interviews  will be conducted face-to- 
face or online depending on the research project.  
 
To minimize  risks to confidentiality,  we will secure study  data with all appropriate physical,  elect ronic,  
and operat ional protect ions. Data will be stored in a physically  secure environment.  All data files will 
have encry ption and strong  password protecti on. Any identifiable data will either  be stored  on Emory  
University's  secure servers ,  on fully encrypted computers, or on paper forms securely stored at the 
study sites . CASI  surveys  and online eligibility screening  will take place  on an encrypted  commercial  
survey  website,  SurveyGizmo  (http://www .surveygizmo.com/survey -software - features/secure -link/).  
This site has been  used  by [CONTACT_287635].  Access  to data will be on a role-based  standard;  only those study staff who require  
access to each type of data to complete their study -related roles  will be allow ed access.  All study  staff 
will be trained in securi ty and confidenti ality procedures,  and will sign a confidentiality  agreement  
before  receivi ng access to any participant  data. 
 
We will also develop procedures  to minimize  indirect discl osure that a participant  is participat ing in an  
HIV-related  research  study, or a study  that enrolls  MSM.  For each mode of contact  [CONTACT_3031],  we will 
ask specifically  whether  anyone else potentially  has access  to that mode of comm unication,  and if it is 
acceptable to leave a non-specific  message  about  participation in a health study.  No study -related  
messages  will ever mention HIV prevention or the nature  of the research study.  Additionally,  all scripts 
for email,  text message,  and telepho ne contact  [CONTACT_287636]- CH IRB before  being  used  for contact  [CONTACT_20688].  
 
We use SSL encryption for transfer s of information online,  and SurveyGizmo  has a business  partner  
HIPAA agreement  with Emory. SurveyGizmo’s  servers  are HIPAA  compliant.  
 
The Analytic  Core  will use Dedoose  software  to perform  all qualita tive analyses.  Dedoose  is a web-
based application for organizing  and analyzing  textual,  audio,  and video data (qualitative)  along with 
outstanding  functionality  for their integration  with survey,  test score,  ratings,  and demographic  data 
(quantitative).  Dedoose  employs  the highest  levels  of data encryption available for a web applicat ion in 
all data storage, back  up, and transmission.  Dedoose allows for project  specific  encryption  feature.  
When  using  this feature,  only [CONTACT_112543] or her designee will hold the additional  encryption key needed  
to be entered  in order  to view the project. This  gives [CONTACT_287641]  exclusive control  over who can view 
the project  under any circumstances.  
 
In addition to a Certific ate of Confidentiality,  we will protect  participants  in the follow ing ways:  
 
 ATN 140 - LYNX Protocol v3.1   11/28/[ADDRESS_350780] completed  training and received certification  in Human Subjects  Research  
Protection (CITI Program) and HIPAA regulations.  They  will continue to renew  this training  in 
compliance with institutional  policies.  
 
11.3.[ADDRESS_350781]  benefits  to participating  in this study. Participants  who receive the LYNX  app 
may receive assista nce in accessing  HIV/STI  testing  and PrEP,  which  has been  shown to be effective  
in reducing  HIV acquisition.  All participants  will receive information on how to access  PrEP in their local 
community.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_350782] (IRB)  Review and Informed Consent  
 
 
This protocol, the informed  consent  documents  and any subsequent  modification s will be reviewed and 
approved by [CONTACT_287637],  the UNC- CH IRB 
who is acting as the single  IRB (IRB of Record)  for this study. The informed consen t will describe the 
purpose of the study,  the procedur es to be followed,  and the risks and benefits  of participatio n. 
 
 
Written  informed consen t will be obtained from the partic ipant. The participant’s  consent/assent  must  
also be obtained if he is able to understand the nature,  signif icance,  and risks of the study. The signed  
original  consent/assent  form will be kept on file at the site and a copy  of the consent /assent  form will be 
given  to the participant.

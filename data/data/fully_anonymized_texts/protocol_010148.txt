CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGN AND DURATION:  
ADX -629-COVID -19-001 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, clinical 
trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PD of ADX -629, administered orally, in adult 
subjects with COVID -19 of moderate severity  prior to the requirement for mechanical ventilation. 
Approximately 30 s ubjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (ADX -629 to placebo)  to receive 
either ADX -629 300 mg bi s in die  or twice daily  (BID) or placebo BID for up to 28 days. 
The reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]  (for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_26328] ), the standard of care followed for 
each subject and site, and whether any care decisions were based on resource limitations will be 
clearly documented for all subjects.  
Treatment will begin on Day  [ADDRESS_891339] is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660925] . During the Treatment 
Period (Days  1 to 28/ End of Treatment [ EOT ]), all s ubjects will receive study drug ( either 
ADX -629 or placebo) BID . The study drug will continue to be taken on an outpatient basis if a 
subject is discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660926] t o Day  [ADDRESS_891340] is 
placed on mechanical ventilation and/or is otherwise unable to ingest  an oral tablet, dosing will 
be stopped. However, the subject will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety. Dosing of 
the study drug may resume once the subject is able to safely ingest an oral tablet.  
All subjects will also have an assessment using the  NIAID ordinal scale score (see Appendix C ) 
daily  on Days 1 to 28/EOT. The NIAID score will be evaluated directly for inpatient subjects and 
assessed via a subject diary for outpatient subjects  through Day 28.  
After treatment is completed , subjects will undergo a follow -up visit on Day 35 ( ±3 days) and a 
telephone follow -up on Day 60 ( ±3 days). The purpose of the telephone follow -up is to assess 
survival status  and evaluate for COVID -[ADDRESS_891341] is unable to attend in  person.

An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board  (DSMB) with multidisciplinary representation 
will be established to evaluate accumulating clinical trial data and to assess the ongoing safety of 
the clinical trial for the subjects enrolled. Interim safety assessments will be scheduled after the 
first group of 10  subjects has been enrolled and subsequently, as needed, to provide safety 
oversight for subjects in the clinical trial . Additional details will be provided in the DSMB charter.

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
ADX-629, a small molecule therapy  formulated for oral administration, is being developed for the 
treatment of chronic diseases with inflammatory and immune -mediated components. The target 
population in this clinical trial is non- ventilated adult subjects with coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID -19) of moderate severity . It is postulated that ADX -629 may mitigate the inflammatory 
response sufficiently in these subjects  to lower levels of inflammatory mediators and potentially 
improve clinical outcome s. 
1.1 Background 
Coronaviruses (CoV)  are common causes of respi[INVESTIGATOR_660930] a variety 
of animal species, including humans.[ADDRESS_891356] of these strains cause mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_660931]; however, 3 strains, including the novel severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_244089] (SARS) -CoV- 2 (SARS -CoV-2), cause severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_660932]. T he 
SARS -CoV-1, Middle East respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] s yndrome (MERS) -CoV , and SARS -CoV-2 can all result 
in severe pneumonia and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS), a frequently fatal 
condition.1,2 Although fatality rates from SARS -CoV- 1 and MERS -CoV, 9.5% and 
34.4% respectively2, are higher than r eported rates  for SARS -CoV-2 (ranging from  <1.0% to over 
6% [as of 31 May 2020]3,4), SARS -CoV-2 is more easily transmitted.2  
SARS -CoV-2 originated in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Secondary  to its high reproductive 
number,2 SARS -CoV-2 quickly spread across China and the world despi[INVESTIGATOR_660933], social distancing, and using personal protective measures. The World Health 
Organization declared the SARS -CoV- 2 and resulting COVID-19 as a pandemic and public health 
emergency of international concern on 30 January  2020.5 As of 31 May  2020, the [LOCATION_002] 
has reported 1,737,950 total cases of COVID -19 with 102,785 deaths from the disease.6 
The COVID -19 pandemic has led to an urgent need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Many  patients diagnosed 
with COVID -19 will develop ARDS and require ventilatory support. In general, ARDS is 
associated with mortality rates up to 4 0%;7 however,  mortality from COVID -19-induced ARDS  
is even higher, with reported death rates over 50%.8,9,10,[ADDRESS_891357] outcomes are observed in 
older patients and those with chronic diseases.8 A treatment that could prevent the progression to 
severe COVID -19 could potentially reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease.

1.1.2 Clinical Trial  of ADX-629 
In addition to nonclinical safety studies, a Phase 1 safety clinical trial was conducted in 85 healthy 
human volunteers in a single ascending dose (SAD) clinical trial and a multiple ascending dose 
(MAD)  clinical trial. In the SAD clinical trial, [ADDRESS_891358] ored, including the maximum dose of 600 mg bis in die  or twice daily 
(BID). The adverse event  (AE) profile of ADX -629 was favorable compared to placebo. A total 
of 6 (9.4%) subjects who received  ADX- 629 had a treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) compared to 
4 (19.1%) subjects who received placebo. None of the subjects required  an interruption or 
discontinuation of the study drug. 
No clinically meaningful changes were observed in the hepatic and renal analytes, including 
transaminases ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] and aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ]), alkaline 
phosphatase, amylase, gamma -glutamyl transferase , bilirubin, creatinine kinase, and  creatinine. 
No changes in serum glucose were observed. Throughout the clinical trial  period, there were no 
clinically meaningful changes observed in heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic , and 
orthostatic changes), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], pulse oximetry, or temperature. No clinically significant hematology changes were observed. ADX -629 did not lead to a prolongation of heart 
rate-corrected QT interval using Fridericia’s formula  (QTcF ). There were no subjects who had a 
QTcF >500 ms or a change of >60 ms from baseline. Five subjects had a change of >30 ms from baseline; however, no intervention or study drug interruption or discontinuation was required, and 
all subjects remained asymptomatic. Three of the 5 subjects were in the SAD portion of the  clinical  
trial (1 each in of the 100 mg, 200 mg, and 700 mg dose cohorts) and the remaining 2 subjects 
were in  the MAD portion of the clinical trial (1 in each of the 150 mg BID and 300 mg BID dose 
cohorts). 
Although PK variability was observed, a linear correlation was evident in C
max and AUC as dose 
increased. The half -life was consistent across cohorts and days, with mean values in multiple day 
exposures ranging from  3.[ADDRESS_891359] dose (600 mg BID), C max was 1700 ng/mL 
(approximately 8.5 µ M) and AUC from time 0 to 12 hours  (AUC 0-12) was 7220 h*ng/mL. At the 
closest dose to the clinical dose (350 mg BID), a C max of 1180 ng/mL (approximately 5.8 µ M) and 
an AUC 0-12 of 4110 h*ng/mL were consistent with an adequate molar ratio to achieve 
stoichiometric efficacy against elevated RASP. A decrease in free MDA levels was observed in 
the plasma of healthy volunteers  over 10 days of oral dosing with ADX -629 600 mg  BID that was 
statistically  significantly  greater than that of subjects treated with placebo. Following ingestion of 
a high- fat meal on Day 10 of dosing with ADX -629 600 mg BID or placebo, levels of free fatty 
acids were statistically significantly lower, and levels of HDL were statistically s ignificantly 
higher, in ADX-629- treated subjects compared with  placebo -treated subjects, potentially 
representing additional anti- inflammatory activity of ADX -629.

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 1.2 Rationale  
This Phase 2 a, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, clinical trial will assess the safety, 
tolerability,  efficacy,  and pharmacodynamics (PD)  of up to [ADDRESS_891360] s with COVID- 19 of moderate severity  may mitigate the inflammatory 
response sufficiently to lower levels of inflammatory mediators and potentially improve clinical 
outcome s. Consistent with nonclinical safety results, ADX -629 was deemed to be safe and well 
tolerated in Phase 1 clinical testing, with few and no greater than mild to moderate  TEAEs  at any 
dose tested . 
1.3 Risk/Benefit  
The ADX -629-COVID -19-[ADDRESS_891361] from 
participating in th e clinical trial.  
The protocol design, dose selection, and safety monitoring are developed following the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA)  Guidance for Industry for Estimating Maximum Safe Starting Dose 
in Initial Clinical Trials, 2005; the FDA Guidance for Industry for Toxicity Grading Scale for 
Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials, 2007;  
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance on first -in-human and early clinical trials 
(EMA,  2017) ; and the Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0.  
Safety of the clinical dosing regimen in this clinical trial is supported by a P hase 1 clinical trial in 
healthy volunteers and a number of preclinical toxicology and PK studies during which no serious 
safety concerns were noted at the projected therapeutic doses in humans .

3.1 Summary of Clinical Trial  Design  
ADX- 629-COVID -19-001 is a Phase 2a, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, clinical 
trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PD of ADX -629, administered orally, in adult 
subjects  with COVID- 19 of moderate severity  prior to the requirement for mechanical ventilation. 
Approximately 30 s ubjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio (ADX -629 to placebo) to receive  
either  ADX -629 300 mg BID or placebo BID for up to 28 days. 
The reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660934] ), the standard of care  
(see Section  5.6.3)  followed for each subject and site, and whether any care decisions were based 
on resource limitations will be clearly documented for all subjects.  
Treatment will begin on Day  [ADDRESS_891362] is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_660925] . During the Treatment Period 
(Days  1 to 28/E nd of Treatment [E OT]), all s ubjects will receive study drug ( either ADX- 629 or 
placebo) BID . The study drug will continue to be taken on an outpatient basis if a subject is 
discharged from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41337] [ADDRESS_891363] is placed on 
mechanical ventilation and/or is otherwise unable to ingest  an oral tablet, dosing will be stopped. 
However, the subject will continue to be monitored for efficacy and safety. Dosing of the study 
drug may resume once the subject is able to safely ingest an oral tablet.  
All subjects will also have an assessment using the  NIAID  ordinal scale score (see Appendix C ) 
daily  on Days 1 to 28/EOT. The NIAID score will be evaluated directly for inpatient subjects and 
assessed via a subject diary for outpatient subjects  through Day 28.  
After treatment is completed , subjects will undergo a follow -up visit on Day 35 ( ±3 days) and a 
telephone follow -up on Day 60 ( ±3 days). The purpose of the telephone follow -up is to assess 
survival status  and evaluate for COVID -[ADDRESS_891364]  (DSMB) with multidisciplinary representation 
will be established to evaluate accumulating clinical trial data and to assess the ongoing safety of 
the clinical  trial for the subjects enrolled. Interim safety assessments will be scheduled after the

5.3 Randomization and Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive an oral tablet of either ADX-629 300 mg BID 
or placebo BID for up to 28 days. Subjects, Investigators, and clinical trial personnel (including 
the Sponsor/designee)  involved in the administration and assessment of the study drug will be 
blinded to the subject treatment assignments throughout the clinical trial.  
5.[ADDRESS_891373]’s treatment assignment is essential for the clinical 
management or welfare of the subject, the Investigator can unblind the treatment assignment. It is encouraged that the Investigator contact [CONTACT_1689] (or designee) before proceeding with the unblinding process. Unblinding should only occur for the subject in question if it is critical for treatment decision making by [CONTACT_445235]-being of the subject. 
Prior to unblinding the subject’s treatment assignment, the Investigator should assess the 
relationship of an AE to study drug (yes or no). If unblinding is warranted, the Investigator must then follow the appropriate procedures to unblind an individual subject’s treatment assignment.  
Generally, the blind should only be broken for events that are considered to be serious, unexpected, 
and causally related to the clinical trial treatments, or as requested by [CONTACT_31665].  
If the clinical trial blind is broken, the Investigator must detail the date and reason for unblinding 
in the subject’s records. The Investigator must also notify the Sponsor (and Institutional Review 
Board [ IRB] if applicable), if this has not already been done, that the clinical trial blind has been 
broken. If the blind is broken due to an AE, the AE form must be completed and reported to the 
Sponsor (see Section  8.6).

Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
The safety of ADX -629 will be determined by [CONTACT_18985]:  
• AEs;  
• Safety laboratory tests (including chemistry, hematology, coagulation parameters,  and 
urinalysis) ;  
• Vital signs (including heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], temperature, and oxygen 
saturation);  
• Physical examinations;  and 
• 12-lead ECG s. 
8.[ADDRESS_891386] a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE  can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product, whether or not related to the investigational medicinal pro duct. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF . 
AEs, which include clinical laboratory test variables, will be monitored and documented from the 
time of informed consent until the last clinical trial visit, including the telephone follow -up. 
Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator , whether or 
not they think the event is due to clinical trial treatment.  Beginning at Screening, Investigators 
should make an assessment for AEs  at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE  eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_239636]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737] , it should be recorded as a separate AE  on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure ( e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be recorded a s an AE, not the procedure  itself .  
Any medical condition already present at S creening  should be recorded as medical history and 
should not be reported as an AE  unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at 
baseline changes in severity , frequency, or seriousness at any time during the clinical trial. In this 
case, it should be reported as an A E. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination ( e.g., ECG ) findings that are 
detected during the clinical trial or are present at  Screening  and significantly worsen during the 
clinical trial should be reported as AEs , as described below . The Investigator  will exercise his or 
her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is clinically significant. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical trial will be followed until repeat tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically significant. Abnormal test results that are determined to be an error should 
not be report ed as an AE . Laboratory test results  that are abnormal, but not clinically significant

Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001 
Confidential & Proprietary  Page 43 of 67 
Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 as determined by [CONTACT_737], should not be reported as  an AE. Laboratory abnormalities or 
other abnormal clinical findings (e .g., ECG  abnormalities) should be reported as an AE  if any of 
the following are applicable:  
• If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality;  
• If action taken with the study drug is required as a result of the abnormality; or  
• Based on the clinical judgment of the Investigator . 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction  
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug reaction. “Responses” to a medicinal product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility  (i.e., the 
relationship cannot be ruled out ). 
8.1.[ADDRESS_891387] information.  
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_349988] (intensity) of each AE  using the CTCAE version 5.0 and 
will also categorize each AE  as to its potential relationship to study drug using the categories of 
“no” or “yes.”  
Severity assessment  
The severity of all AEs  should be graded according to the CTCAE version 5.0. For those AE  terms  
not listed in the CTCAE, the following grading system should be used:  
• CTCAE Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild  symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated;  
• CTCAE Grade 2: Moderate; minimal local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living ; 
• CTCAE Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care 
activities of daily living ; 
• CTCAE Grade 4: Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; and  
• CTCAE Grade 5:  Death related to the AE . 
Causality a ssessment  
The relationship of an AE  to the administration of the study drug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions:  
• No (unrelated, not related, or unlikely to be relate d) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  rules out a causal 
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001 
Confidential & Proprietary  Page 44 of 67 
Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 relationship and another cause ( e.g., concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complication) is suspected; 
or 
• Yes ( possibly related, probably related , or definitely related ) – The time course between the 
administration of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE  is consistent with a 
causal relationship and no other cause ( e.g., concomitant drugs, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications) can 
be identified. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between 
the event and the study drug. This means that there are facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest 
a causal relationship.  
The following factors should also be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the 
study drug:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration;  
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases ; 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant drugs;  
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question. 
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug;  
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses ; and  
The exposure to stress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and 
better explanation for the event.  
• The pharmacology and PK  of the study drug.  
The known pharmacologic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Event s 
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator  or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death ; 
• A life -threatening AE ; 
Note: An AE  or adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in view of either the 
Investigator  or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk  of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

Note : Important medical events that do not meet any of the above criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependen cy. 
Note: Events related to  progression of the subjec t’s underlying COVID -19 diagnosis will be 
captured as endpoints; therefore, events clearly related to progression of the subject ’s underlying 
COVID- 19 (signs  or symptoms of progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless 
considered related to study drug or if the outcome is fatal  during the  clinical  trial or within the 
safety reporting period. If the event has a fatal outcome during that timeframe, the event of “Progression of COVID-19” must be recorded as an SAE with a fatal outcome . 
8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators  
Initial reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent  must be reported to Clinical 
Safety within [ADDRESS_891388] be reported to the  
Clinical Safety or the Sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the  clinical  trial. When the form is completed, Safety personnel will be 
notified electronically  by [CONTACT_239638]. If the event meets serious 
criteria and it is not possible to access the EDC system ,

Within [ADDRESS_891391] update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system for the clinical trial and submit any supporting documentation 
(e.g., subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Clinical Safety via fax or email. 
If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to the procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs. 
8.[ADDRESS_891392] becomes pregnant during the clinical trial or within the safety follow -up period defined 
in the protocol, the Investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately and the subject 
should be withdrawn from the  clinical  trial. Early termination procedures should be implemented 
at that time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE  or SAE; however, it must be reported to  
Clinical Safety within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  Clinical Safety will then 
provide the Investigator/site the Exposure In Utero  (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete the EIU form and fax/email it back to  Clinical Safety.  
If the female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while the subject is receiving study drug or within the safety follow -up period defined in the protocol, the Investigator should notify 
 Clinical Safety as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy, whenever possible. Once the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be complete d and faxed/emailed to 
 Clinical Safety. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (i .e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
8.5 Expedited Reporting  
The Sponsor/designee will report all relevant information about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]R s) that are fatal or life -threatening as soon as possible to the FDA, but 
no later than 7 days after knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee of such a case. Relevant  follow-up 
information will subsequently be communicated within an additional [ADDRESS_891393] knowledge by [CONTACT_1034]/designee.  The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines outlined in country- specific legislation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inform  all Investigators as required per local regulations.

Good Clinical Practice (GCP) is an international ethical and scientific quality standard for 
designing, conducting, recording, and reporting clinical trials  that involve human subjects. 
Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety, and well -being of 
clinical trial subjects are protected, consistent with the principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, and that the clinical trial data are credible.  
11.[ADDRESS_891406] s. The clinical trial will only be conducted at sites where IRB 
approval has been obtained. The protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, ICF, advertisements (if 
applicable), written information given to the subject s, safety updates, annual progress reports, and 
any revisions to these documents will be provided to the IRB by [CONTACT_737]. 
Federal regulations and International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guidelines require that 
approval be obtained from an IRB prior to participation of subject s in clinical  trials . Prior to clinical 
trial onset, the protocol, any protocol amendments, ICF s, advertisements to be used for subject  
recruitment, and any other written information regarding this clinical trial to be provided to a 
subject  or subject ’s legal guardian must be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
No drug will be released to the site for dosing until written IRB authorization has been received 
by [CONTACT_1034]. 
11.3 Informed Consent  
A written (or electronic) ICF, or equivalent consent per FDA guidelines on COVID -[ADDRESS_891407] has been informed of his/her rights to privacy. The Investigator  will obtain written  (or 
electronic) informed consent from each subject  or legally authorized representative  before any 
protocol -specific procedure is performed and should document in the source documentation that 
consent was obtained prior to enrollment in the clinical trial. The original signed copy of the ICF  
must be maintained by [CONTACT_522719] a representative of the 
Sponsor , their representatives, auditors, the IRB and/or regulatory agencies. A copy of the signed 
ICF will be given to the  subject.  
11.4 Clinical Trial  Monitoring Requirements  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the clinical trial is conducted in accordance 
with the protocol, Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements , and 
that valid data are entered into the eCRFs.  
Aldeyra Therapeutics, Inc.  
Clinical Trial Protocol ADX -629-COVID- 19-001 
Confidential & Proprietary  Page 54 of 67 
Version 3.0, 11 December 2020 To achieve this objective, the monitor’s duties are to aid the Investigator and, at the same time, the 
Sponsor  in the maintenance of complete, legible, well organized and easily retrievable data. Before 
the enrollment of any subject in this clinical trial, the Sponsor  or their designee will review with 
the Investigator  and site personnel the following documents: protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, 
eCRFs and procedures for their completion, informed consent process, and the procedure for 
reporting SAEs. 
The Investigator will permit the Sponsor  or their designee to monitor the clinical trial as frequently 
as deemed necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are satisfactory. 
During the monitoring visits, information recorded on the eCRFs will be verified against source 
documents , and requests for clarification or correction may be made. After the eCRF data are  
entered by [CONTACT_779], the CRA will review the data for safety information, completeness, accuracy, 
and logical consistency. Com puter programs that identify data inconsistencies may be used to help 
monitor the clinical trial . If necessary, requests for clarification or correction will be sent to 
Investigators. The Investigator and his/her staff will be expected to cooperate with the monitor and 
provide any missing information, whenever possible. 
All monitoring activities will be reported and archived. In addition, monitoring visits will be 
documented at the investigational site by [CONTACT_660955]-specific monitoring 
log. 
11.[ADDRESS_891408] parties other than those noted above is prohibited. 
11.6 Retention of Records  
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or the Sponsor , the I nvestigator 
will keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link 
records, [e.g., eCRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097] ]), all original signed ICFs , copi[INVESTIGATOR_3951] e CRFs, SAE 
forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition. The records should be 
retained by [CONTACT_97962], local regulations, or 
as specified in the Clinical Trial  Agreement, whichever is longer. The Investigator  must obtain 
written permission from the Sponsor  before disposing of any records, even if retention 
requirements have been met.  
If the Investigator  relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the clinical trial, the Sponsor  
should be prospectively notified. The clinical trial records must be transferred to an acceptable 
designee, such as another Investigator , another institution, or to the Sponsor .

Patient Movement during Postoperativ e Recovery: Part [ADDRESS_599310] Real -time 
Location System (RTLS) in monitoring patient movement during their in -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467618] .  The study will involve patients who have  undergo ne surgery 
requiring inpatient admission to the 9CC surgical ward.   Actual patient movement will be 
monitored during their postoperative recovery and compared with data recorded by [CONTACT_467625].  
1.0 Introduction and Background  
 
Early mobiliza tion after surgery can decrease  postoperative complications and 
length of stay. Recognizing  these  improved outcomes, c urrent enhanced -
recovery after surgery (ERAS) programs emphasize rapid mobilizatio n during the 
postoperative period even on the day of surgery. (1–3)  Unfortunately, patients 
face numerous real and perceived barriers to early mobilization including 
postoperative pain;  multiple intravenous catheters; drains; lines, and staff 
resource limitations.  Monitoring c ompliance with early mobilization programs r ely 
on patient self -report, progress notes, and nursing documentation,  all of which 
are unreliable.  Our team has used accelerometers  (Fitbit Zip and Kenz 
Lifecorder)  to monitor postoperative movement after major gastrointestinal 
oncology surgery (CCCWFU 0 2114).  Preliminary data from this study, 
demonstrates little to no movement by [CONTACT_467626][INVESTIGATOR_059].  
However, this may be an artifact of current accelerometer devices rather than 
lack of movement by [CONTACT_1962].     
 
In an era of the Internet of T hings (IoT) and emerging  technologies , we 
recognized a unique opportunity to use the existing real -time location system  
(RTLS)  at Wake Forest Baptist Health to monitor patient movement during 
postoperative recovery. (4)  The Wake Forest Office of Enterprise Visibility  
developed at program  for the implementation of processes, supporting 
technologies, driving Service Excellence, Patient Safety and Satisfaction, 
Operational Excellence and Efficiency, and the Transformation of Healthcare 
Delivery (SPOT) .  The SPOT program installed the current  real-time location 
system through out Wake Forest Baptist Health initially to track high valued 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467619].  RTLS is a complex system of various tags and badges, 
platforms (Wi -Fi, Inf rared, Ultrasound, and others), hardware 
infrastructure  (readers  & exciters) and other components (servers, middleware 
& end-user software). (5)  The Wake Forest RTLS solution consists of specialized 
fixed location sensors receiving wireless signals from small ID badges or tags 
attach ed to equipment or persons. Tags transmit a unique identifier in real -time 
that enable tracking.  The granularity of the RTLS program varies throughout the 
health system with room -level tracking capabilities in the wards of the Wake 
Forest Comprehensive Ca ncer Center.

Patient Movement during Postoperativ e Recovery: Part [ADDRESS_599313] Health (9cc).  All patients will have undergone elective surgical 
intervention with anticipated minimum of 24 hours hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  We plan to 
enroll 40 patients.   
 
All eligible subjects will be asked to participate in the study regardless of race, 
gender, age, or other characteristic except those outlined in the excl usion criteria 
below .   Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be asked to participate in the 
study by [CONTACT_467627].  I f 
they agree, informed consent will be obtained by a study team member.  
 
An add itional cohort of providers care for patients on 9cc including nurses, 
nursing assistants, physicians, advanced practice providers, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], 
occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], students and residents will be asked to participate in the 
study.  If they agr ee, informed consent will be obtained by a study team member.  
A maximum of 50 providers were be included in provider cohort.  
 
Given feedback from providers and findings through analysis of RTLS, the study 
recognizes the need to confirm the validity of RTL S during various ambulatory 
patterns.  This requires enrollment of an additional 2 2 patients.  This additional 
cohort --High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) Cohort) --will be randomly 
divided into two cohorts: Group 1, Continuous Ambulation (n = 1 2), and Group 2, 
Interval Ambulation (n =10).

approval from the treating physician.   Recruitment, consent, and data collection 
will be completed in the privacy of the patient’s room.  
 
The nature, purpose, and risks of all procedures and protocols will be explained to 
each participant prior to obtaining written consent.  All examiners are trained in the 
standardized conduction of all assessments before data collection.  Standardized 
written instructions will be provided.   
 
Subjects  will not be recruited for the observational study cohort  as this cohort is 
closed to enrollment .   
Enrollment will be limited to the additional the expanded HIIT Cohort  (n= 2 2).  Using 
random number generator,  eligible patients will be randomized into two groups: Group 
1, Continuous Ambulation (n = 1 2), and Group 2, Interval Ambulation (n =10).

 5.3 Pedometer and Step Data  
 
The Fitbit ZipTM (Fitbit Inc., San Francisco, CA; www.fitbit.com) is a lightweight, 
portable pedometer device that contains a tri -axial accelerometer.  The device is 
commercially available to consumers and is considered a recreational device.  It is 
capable of tracking multiple measures of physical activity including steps and 
distance traveled.  Tracking data is stored on the device for several weeks and is 
capable of  being downloaded to a computer for analysis using USB or wireless 
connection.  The accuracy of the Fitbit OneTM and Fitbit UltraTM have been 
independently validated.15,16  The Fitbit device can be worn on various body 
locations (hip vs. pocket) and maintains a high level of accuracy.16   
 
The Kenz Lifecorder EX Accelerometer is an accurate and reliable research  grade 
activity monitor that, in addition to counting steps, calculates calories expended, 
monitors the intensity and duration of physical activity, computes basal metabolic 
rate (BMR) and stores 200 days of data.  Each participant’s height, weight, age, 
gender, as well as the time of day will be programmed into the device before given 
to the participant.  
 
Each participant will wear the pedometer devices during their daily walk with 
research staff .  Programming of the Fitbit ZipTM and Kenz Lifecorder EX 
Accelerometer will be  performed by [CONTACT_3647] .  
 
The pedometer data will be stored in a secure, password -protected file behind 
the WFBH firewall.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_599318] medical records reviewed to d etermine specific details 
regarding their medical condition, diagnosis, co -morbidities, laboratory data 
(nutritional status), medications, social history, past operations, and operation. If 
barriers to successfully completing the study are identified, the participant may 
be dismissed from the study.  Relevant clinical data will be collected and stored 
in RedCap.   
 
5.5 SPOT /RTLS  Badges and Data  
 
All participants will wear a SPOT badge provided by [CONTACT_467628].  Research staff will stress that participants should wear the pedometer 
during the study period.  Participants will be asked to wear the activity monitors at all 
times except while bathing or showering. SPOT badge data is collected continuously 
by [CONTACT_467629].  This is standard procedures for 
Wake Forest Baptist Health.  The study team will coordinate with the SPOT team to 
extract data specific for this study. The extracted data will be stored in secure, 
password -protect files  behind the WFBH firewall using excel files.

will be provided if subject declines ambulatio n or unable to ambulate out of 
their room.  Demonstration of the hand bike will be provided by [CONTACT_467630].  For subjects unable to perform the ambulatory session, 
a study team member will return on a subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467622].  If patient unable to perform the ambulatory 
session during their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_467623], the reason 
will be documented.

distance of [ADDRESS_599325] as they can.   
3. Hand Bike Continuous T raining  (Group 1, alternative option until 
able to participate in ambulatory session) : The subject will be asked 
to bike for 5 minutes continuously with coaching “go as slow as you 
want.”  
4. Hand Bike Interval Training (Group 2, alternative option until able to 
participate in ambulatory session) : The subject will be asked to bike 
in 10 second intervals (“as fast as they want to go”) and rest for 50 
seconds for five rounds (i.e. every minute on the minute (EMOM).

 6.0 Outcome Measures  
 
6.1 Primary Outcome: Determine if the SPOT system can detect movement in 
and out of a patient’s room.   
 
6.2       Secondary Outcomes:  
6.2.[ADDRESS_599328] movement when a 
patient varies their ambulatory behavior.  
6.2.7  Characterize patient’s ability to tolerate various ambulatory 
intensities after surgery.   
6.2.8  Describe patient readiness for discharge.  
7.0 Analytic Plan  
 
7.1 Sample size 
 
40 subjects will be included in initial observational  study.  Preliminary tests 
of SPOT badges indicate sensitivity and specificity nearly 100% using 
controlled movements on 9cc. Assuming type I error of 0.05, a two -sided 
test, [ADDRESS_599329] more than 90% power to detect the sensitivity 
of specificity under the alternative hypothesis equal to 0.9. If we use a 
range of prevalence from 0.[ADDRESS_599330] more than 90% power.  
However, th e positioning of  SPOT badge may decrease the sensitivity and 
specificity of the movement readings. Review of preliminary survey data 
indicates significant variability in response indicating need for expansion of 
sample size for secondary study objectives.  With [ADDRESS_599331] Real -time Tracking System for Monitoring 
Patient Movement during Postoperativ e Recovery: Part [ADDRESS_599332] sufficient power  to demonstrate the feasibility of  
this study  and provide appropriate confidence intervals for future studies .    
 
In total, targeted study enrollment will be 6 2 patients and 50 providers.  
 
7.2 Feasibility analysis  and statistics.  
 
The study team will also capture information from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_467624]. We will evaluate the 
capabilities of the SPOT system to monitor patient movement.  Feasible 
study will be defined as more than  80% of badges assigned to the 
observational study participants  will detect movement in and out a room.  
All data will be descriptive in nature and will focus on patterns of 
movement and presence or absence of data.  Summary statistics such as 
means and sta ndard deviations will be calculated for continuous measures 
and counts and percentages  will be calculated for discrete measures. 
Agreement statistics, including kappa statistics, sensitivity,  and specify , 
will be calculated. Changes of pre - and post - vital signs wil l be calculated 
and graphical display will be performed to show the changes over time.  
The correlation between walking distance as well as pain and fatigue will 
be calculated each day. Mixed effects models will be used to study the 
association  over time.  Since the sample size is small, we are aware that 
the models may not be stable.  Thus, descriptive analysis will be our 
primary analysis.    
 
The additional HITT  study cohort will enable validation of SPOT system to 
capture out of room events  unde r various ambulatory patterns. This will 
build on the current cohort that validate d simple in and out of room events.  
Feasible study will be defined as more than 80% of badges assigned to 
participants detect movement in and out a room  during continuous an d 
interval movement patterns.

Patient Movement during Postoperativ e Recovery: Part [ADDRESS_599334] pain, heart palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], shortness of breath.  In 
very rare situations exercise can result in heart attack or sudden death. 
We will minimize this risk by: (1) safely escorting participants to chairs 
located a long the walking course should they become unsteady; (2) 
following them at a close distance; and, (3) being at their side should they 
need assistance. There is a risk that participants may experience muscle 
soreness or discomfort as a result of physical ac tivity.  However, walking 
is regarded as an important component of postoperative recovery.

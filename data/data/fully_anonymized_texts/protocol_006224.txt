This is a multiple site prospective  assessment of the stud y product in the ICU setting.   
 
Study Period:  
The study is comprised of each subject wearing one study  product until the study product  either 
needs to be changed or is no longer required by [CONTACT_423] . 
 
Target Number of Subjects :   
The sample size for this study is at least thirty (30) subjects.  
 
Eligibility Criteria : 
Study subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria are recruited by [CONTACT_191879].  
Subjects or their authorized representative must be willing to sign an informed consent document 
and comply with study parameters.  
 
Study Product:  
The  is designed  to hold a standard or subglottic ET tube and 
help reduce the potential for occlusion (blockage) of the tube .  In this study, the study product 
holds  only ET tubes with subglottic suctioning capability  sizes 6.0 -8.0mm . 
 
Statistics Methods:  
Study data will be presented in their entirety or summarized using descriptive statistics. No 
hypothesis tests or other statistical analyses are planned.

10.0 STUDY PROCEDURES  
10.1 RECRUITMENT /SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION PROCEDURE  
Subjects who meet the stated inclusion and exclusion criteria are recruited by [CONTACT_25309] .  At least thirty (30) subjects are enrolled.  
 
Subjects are assigned an identification code by [CONTACT_3462].  
  All data forms identify the subject by [CONTACT_191886].  All study 
data is confiden tial and kept in a secure location.   The Subject ID is documented o n 
 
 
10.2 ENROLLMENT  
Enrollment follows Informed Consent (see Section 10.3) but both may occur during 
the same visit.  The Investigator , or designee confirms Inclusion and Exclusion 
Criteria (listed in Sections 9.1 and 9.2) prior to enrolling the subject.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_227967]’s 
LAR  prior to enrolling in the study. Subjects or the subject’s LAR  have the study 
explained to them by [CONTACT_18370] , read the Informed Consent form, 
have the opportunity to ask questions, and sign the approved Informed Consent form 
prior to any protocol procedures. The subject (or their LAR) is given a signed copy 
of the Informed Consent form. Written consent to use Personal Health Information

Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_227969] / CAREGIVER INSTRUCTIONS  
All subject care is consistent with standard health care practices.  No treatment is 
withheld or altered during the course of the study.  The Investigator or designee  uses 
the study product’s instructions for use

training may be necessary.  

 
 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_227971] discontinuation include , 
but are not limited to,  the occurrence of an adverse event (see Section 11). If the 
subject withdraws  from the study  or is discontinued by [CONTACT_737] ,

While being orally intubated, there is a possibility that the tongue could become  
swollen and/or displaced from its normal resting place  and result in  contact [CONTACT_191887]/shuttling properly .  If in the 
clinician’s assessment  of the subject,  the study product should be removed, complete

verify study procedures are adhered to by [CONTACT_737].  Hollister may transfer 
any or all trial -related duties and functions to a CRO, but the ultimate responsibility 
for the quality and integri ty of the study data resides with the sponsor. (ICH GCP 
5.2.1)

occur with the repeated application and removal of any adhesive  material currently available 
on the market and while noted in the study file is not considered an adverse event.   
 

 
 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_227974]  by [CONTACT_112536] “possibly”, “probably”, or “definitely” on 
the Adverse Event F orm.   
 
All Adverse Events are followed to determine resolution  as prescribed by  [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s 
standard of care  and the Adverse Event form is updated to indicate date of resolution.  If at 
any point, the Investigator  or designee  determines the subject should no  longer use the study 
product , the subject should be discontinued from the study . 
 
Reporting of Adverse Events  
Unanticipated and serious adverse events  related to the study product  must be reported by 
[CONTACT_191888] [ADDRESS_227975] provided 

 
 
Clinical Protocol: [ADDRESS_227976], which are provided by [CONTACT_16015]. Investigators 
and their personnel are trained, by [CONTACT_166327]/or a designated CRO , in the use of eCRFs 
and application of electronic signatures before the start of the study.  
 
Because it is extremely important to have proper data collection in a timely manner, the 
Investigator or designee and subjects complete the eCRFs on an ongoing basis.   It is 
expected that the eCRFs for a particular subject are reviewed and completed by [CONTACT_191889].    
 
The Investigator or designee enters the data into the EDC system and retains the original 
source documents in the study binder for the monitor to perform source document 
verification  as needed . The Investigator agrees to maintain all study files in a secure location 
for a minimum of two years.  
13.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
13.1 DATA ANALYSIS OF OBJECTIVE  
Study data will be pres ented in their entirety or summarized using simple descriptive 
statistics; any open comments obtained will be provided without analysis or 
interpretation.   No hypothesis tests, inferences to any population or any other statistical 
analyses are planned.  
 
 
The objective will be assessed via questionnaire items relating to product application, 
 and product removal. 
Overall acceptability relating to general experience with the study product will also be 
ascertained.

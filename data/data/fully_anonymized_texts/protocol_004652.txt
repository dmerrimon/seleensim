2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
BOTOX Cosmetic (onabotulinumtoxinA/Botulinum Toxin Type A) is an acetylcholine release inhibitor and 
a neuromuscular blocking agent indicated in adults for the temporary improvement in the appearance 
of moderate to severe glabellar lines (GL) as sociated with corrugator and/or procerus muscle activity, 
moderate to severe lateral canthal lines (LCL) associated with orbicularis oculi activity, and moderate to 
severe forehead lines (FHL) associated with frontalis muscle activity .1,[ADDRESS_561887] satisfaction with facial 
appearances , which is often described as achieving a "natural and relaxed "look . It is typi[INVESTIGATOR_442246] a "frozen " look. Asmore 
experience has been gained, botu linum toxin dosing, precise placement, and injection techniques have 
become more fine-tuned. As a result of these advances, healthc are professionals have learned that 
proper botulinum toxin procedures can yield a natural look that drives subject satisfaction.[ADDRESS_561888] o f fillers and onabotulinumtoxinA in a 
pan-facial approach and demonstrated that minimally invasive, multimodal treatment resulted in 
improvements in FACE -Q scores and perceived age, indicating a high degree of patient satisfaction and a 
younger facial appe arance .6  In addition, when independent observers were provided with enrolled 
subjects 'paired before and after treatment images , the independent observers reported that subjects 
appeared to have a higher social status, look nearly 5 years younger, more healthy, a pproachable, more 
attractive, and more successful at attracting others after treatment.7
Significant improvements in patient -reported outcomes (PROs) have also been reported in a P hase [ADDRESS_561889] satisfaction and natural outcome sfollowing BOTOX 
Cosmetic treatment of upper facial areas ( GL, LCL, and FHL ).

STUDY M 22-974  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_561890] a duration of several months or, in rare cases, longer.
While Allergan (an [COMPANY_013] company) does not consider Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID -19)to be a 
safety concern for BOTOX Cosmetic due to its mechanism of action and route of administration, the 
sponsor is monitoring COVID -19 events during the pandemic closely . A review of COVID -19 events for 
the pe riod of 01 January 2019 through 31 December 2021 did not identify any new or significant safety 
findings for the subjects receiving BOTOX Cosmetic treatment . Overall, the clinical course and 
presentation of patients with COVID -19 infection coincident with BOTOX Cosmetic is consistent with 
what has been described for the general population . Considering the COVID -19 pandemic and based on 
the limited information to date, no additional risk to study participants is anticipated with the use of 
BOTOX Cosmetic.
For further details, please see findings from completed studies, including safety data in the current
BOTOX Cosmetic investigator's brochure.

approximately 20% of the study population will have Fitzpatrick skin phototypes of IV, V, or VI.
A review of individual site data will be conducted once a sufficient number of subjects has been
enrolled. The site will be permitted to enroll additional subjects upon sponsor approval. This process 
may be repeated as needed.
On Day 1, after subject sare verified to meet all eligibility criteria and have completed all baseline study 
procedures , they will receive [ADDRESS_561894] will receive a total of 16injections 
(0.1 mL or 4 U of BOTOX Cosmetic per injection), with 5 injections in the glabellar complex, 3 injections 
in each of the lateral canthal area (6 total injections), and 5 injections in the frontalis muscle.
There are seven in-clinic visits: screening/b aseline /treatment (Day 1), post -treatment follow -up visits 
(Day s30, 60, 90, 120 , 150) ,and study exit (Day 180 or Early Exit ). The study schema of the study is 
shown in Figure 1.
Further details on study procedures are located in the Operations Manual ( Appendix E).

4.2 Discussion of Study Design
Choice of Control Group
This is an open -label study. There is no separate control gr oup. 
Appropriateness of Measurements
The primary efficacy measure used in this study (FLSQ) is a validated measure . Allergan has also 
developed and validated upper facial line severity scales (AGLSS, LCLSS, and FHLSS) in accordance with 
the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration requirement. All efficacy -related measurements in this 
study are standard for assessin gfacial aesthetics correction (for GL, LCL, and FHL). All clinical procedures 
in this study are standard and generally accepted.
Suitability of Subject Population
The study population will include male and female adults with moderate to severe GL, LCL, an d FHL at 
maximum contraction as assessed by [CONTACT_442247], LCLSS, and FHLSS, respectively. To 
avoid confounding the study results, washout from prior facial aesthetic treatments is required as 
described in the eligibility criteria.

5.4 Prior and Concomitant Procedures
Any medication or vacci ne (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or 
herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives d uring the study 
must be recorded from 30 days prior to the study drug administration through the study exit . See below 
for details on special handling for the COVID -19 vaccine.
The use of any medication during the study (including prescription or over -the-counter medication, 
vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) is to be recorded on the subject's electronic case report form 
(eCRF) at each visit along with the reason the medication is taken, dates of use, and dosing regimen. 
Concomitant medications and concurrent procedures will also be collected at each visit. 
Study site personnel should notify th e sponsor immediately if a subject uses a concomitant medication 
or has a concurrent procedure that is prohibited per protocol (see Section 5.3). Subjects who use 
prohibited concomitant medications or have a prohibited concurrent procedure may be discontinued at 
the discretion of the investigator or sponsor. Concomitant medications and concurrent procedures will 
be tabulated and listed. 
Non -live vaccines may be used during the study, if not contraindicated or medically inappropriate. When 
possible, study drug should be given at least ± 7 days from vaccine administration.
Co-administration of aminoglycosides or agents that could interfere with neuromuscular transmiss ion 
(e.g., curare -like agents) or muscle relaxants are to be used with caution as the effects of the toxin,

documented in sourc e as required by [CONTACT_456]. Product complaints associated with AEswill be 
reported in the study summary . All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis . Product 
complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conc lusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, regardless of whether the e vent is considered causally related to the use of 
the product.
Page 20 of 59 
STUDY M 22-974  |  Version 3.0
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations "such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occup ational or 
accidental exposure, off -label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether associated with an AEor not . Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AEshould be reported as a new AE. Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them 
to be AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throughout the study. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/proced ure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and/or the surgery/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre -existing condition deter iorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or n ot, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance as a SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of 
the SAE (refer to Section 4.[ADDRESS_561918] information ):
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been 
taken . This does not include an event t hat would have been fatal if it 
had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66748]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] . This does not include 
an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condit ion that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject . Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental tra uma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Page 21 of 59 
STUDY M 22-974  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_561919] and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above ( e.g., death of subject, life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or
significant disability/incapacity) . Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event along with any suspected transmission of an 
infectious agent via a medicinal product if no other serious criterio n
is applicable . Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.
All adverse events from the time of study drug administration will be collected for at least [ADDRESS_561920] follow -up visit, whichever is longer, 
only spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will not be collected) . In addition, 
study procedure -related serious and nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the 
subject signs the study -specific informed consent.
The following definitions will be used for Serious Adverse Reactions (SAR) and Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R):
SAR Defined as all noxious and unintended responses to an Investigational medicinal 
product (IMP) related to any dose administered that result in an SAE as defined 
above.
S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a causal 
relation ship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Safety 
Information) and meets one of the above serious criteria .
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reportin g for the IMP in accordance with global and local 
requirements.
Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may 
indicate a trend or risk to subjects.
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AEas mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Page 22 of 59 
STUDY M 22-974  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_561921]'s 
usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual 
activities and may be incapacitating or life threatening.
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the AE to the use of study 
drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, t here is 
sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic 
plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative causes, there is 
insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship.
Pregnancy
While not an AE, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_561922] be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the 
event.
Possible Distant Spread of Toxin
Possible distant spread of toxin (PDSOT) is defined as a possible pharmacologic effect of botulinum toxin 
at sites noncontiguous and distant from the site of injection . Utilizing a standardized methodology to 
assess for PD SOT, MedDRA preferred terms (PTs) that may be associated with botulinum toxin effects 
have been prospectively identified (see the statistical analysis plan [SAP] for a complete list of these 
PTs). Adverse events reporting any of these terms will be medical ly reviewed on a regular basis 
throughout the study and will be summarized in the clinical study report.
7STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
The statistical methods provided in this protocol will be focused on primary and secondary efficacy
endpoints. Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described in the SAP. 
Page 23 of 59 
STUDY M 22-974  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_561923] an intercurrent event resulting in 
not having a Day 30 assessment for any reason will not be included. Intercurrent events include :
Subjects who are enrolled but do not receive the total do se of 64 U of BOTOX Cosmetic, as 
described in this study protocol
Subjects who are enrolled but prematurely discontinue the study before the Day 30 assessment 
Subjects who die before the Day 30 assessment
Subjects who are lost to follow -up and are missing Day 30 data for the endpoint
Subjects who continue in the study beyond Day 30, but are missing the Day [ADDRESS_561924] non- missing safety assessment before study drug administration will be 
used as the baseline for all analyses of that endpoint.

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
No use or disclosure outside [COMPANY_013] is permitted without prior written authorization from [COMPANY_013].Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as any AE with the onset that is after the first dose of 
study drug . Events in which the onset date is the same as the study drug start date are assumed to be 
treatment -emergent, unless known to have started prior to study drug administration.
An overview of AEs will be presented consisting of the number and percentage of subjects experiencing 
at least one event for each of the following AE categories:
Any TEAE
Any TEAE related to study treatment according to the i nvestigator
Any TEAE related to study drug according to the investigator
Any TEAE related to study procedure according to the investigator
Any mild TEAE
Any mild TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
Any moderate TEAE
Any moderate TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
Any severe TEAE
Any severe TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
Any serious TEAE
Any serious TEAE related to study treatment according to the investigator
Any TEAE leadi ng to death
Any PDSOT TEAE
All deaths
Treatment -emergent adverse events will be summarized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and PT; for TEAEs 
related with reasonable possibility to study treatment (including study drug related and study procedure 
related) as assessed by [CONTACT_442251]; formaximum severity by[CONTACT_3592]; and for
subject number sby[CONTACT_3592] . Specific TEAEs will be counted once for each subject for calculating 
percentages, unless stated otherwise . In addition, if the same AEoccurs multiple times within a subject, 
the highest severity and level of relationship to study treatment will be reported.
Treatment -emergent SAEs (including deaths) will be summarized by [CONTACT_3592]. All SAEs will be 
provided in listing format.
Possible dist ant spread of toxin TEAEs will be identified in the SAP and summarized by [CONTACT_6214].

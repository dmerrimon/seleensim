  Version Date: 6/18/2019  Phase 1b : To determine the safety of single dose (unfractionated 
CAR -T cell infusion  at 2.5 x 106 cells/kg   
Primary Objectives  1. Determine the safety (dose level) of CAR -20/19 -T cell 
administration in relapsed refractory CLL/SLL and B -cell NHL  
2. Determine the feasibility to manufacture CAR- 20/19- T cells 
locally from patient apheresis products using the CliniMACS 
Prodigy Cell processing device  
Secondary Objectives 1. Determine the anti -tumor responses as measured by [CONTACT_732450].  
2. Describe the duration of response for responding patients  
3. Determine persistence of CAR- 20/19 -T cells 
4. Determine the effects of CAR -20/19- T infusion on non- neoplastic 
CD19 & CD20 B cells in vivo  
5. Determine if cellular or  humoral host immunity develops against 
CAR- 20/19- T cells  
6. Evaluate MRD using molecular technolog ies 
Endpoints  1. Ability to manufacture CAR -20/19 -T cells from patient apheresis

Study Design This is a phase 1 /1b, interventional , single arm, open label, treatment 
study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of CAR- 20/19-T in patients with B cell malignancies that have relapsed 
after prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732385] .  
 The study is divided into two phases. Phase 1 and Phase 1b .   
 Phase 1:   consists of 2 cohorts ; dose escalation and dose 
expansion. The CAR -T cells were given over 2 days.  
In the phase 1 portion, there will be a dose escalation cohort to 
determine the safe CAR- 20/19- T cell dose in patients with CLL/SLL 
and NHL. Once the desired dose has been identified there will be a 
6 patient  dose expansion phase at the specified dose level . 
Phase 1b:  CAR- T infusion given as a single dose.  
In the Phase 1b portion of the study, we will test the safety of 
unfractionated CAR -T cell s utilizing the safe dose identified in the 
phase 1 portion  (2.5 x 106 cells/kg) .  
Study Agent 
Description  CAR -20/19 -T cell s will be administered  either fresh or thawed  after 
cryopreservation by [CONTACT_51215].  Patients will receive one of four 
dose levels of CAR -20/19- T cells based on our dose escalation 
design (Section 6 ). Cells will be given over 2 days, 30% on Day 0 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  7 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  and 70% on Day 1  in the Phase 1 portion and in Phase 1 b as a 
single infusion on Day 0. Cell dose will be maxed at 80 kg.  
 
Phase 1 
Dose Level -1: 1 x 105 CAR- 20/19- T cells/kg   
Dose Level 0:  2.5 x105 CAR- 20/19- T cell s/kg (starting dose level)  
Dose Level 1: 7.5 x105 CAR- 20/19- T cell s/kg 
Dose Level 2: 2.5 x 106 CAR- 20/19- T cell s/kg (goal cell dose)  
 
Phase 1b 
Expansion Dose Level: 2.5 x 106 cells/kg  (single infusion)  
 
Number of Subjects  A maximum of 24 patients will be enrolled on this Phase 1/1b  study.  
Subject Participation 
Duration  Subjects will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_1000616] infusion of the CAR-
20/19- T cell s  
Duration of Follow up  Patients will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_1000617] infusion of CAR- 20/19-
T cell s infusion  as part of this protocol and then placed on a l ong-
term follow -up protocol that will follow patients for up to a total of [ADDRESS_1000618] CAR -T cell infusion   
Estimated Time to Complete Enrollment:  18-24 months  
Statistical Methodology:  
 This is a phase 1 /1b, interventional single arm, open label, 
treatment study designed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusion of CAR- 20/19 -T cells. In the phase 1 portion the study will 
utilize a 3+3 dose escalation design in NHL & CLL/SLL followed by 
a 6 patient  expansion cohort.  
In the Phase 1b portion, 9 patients will be treated at the safe dose 
from the Phase 1 portion (2.5 x 10
6 cells/kg). and will receive a 
single infusion rather than fractionated dose.  
Safety Assessments Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_732451] (CRS) using the Lee et al. grading scale [1] and adverse 
events via NCI CTCAE version 5.0. Dose limiting toxicities (DLT) will 
be monitored for the first 28 days after CAR -20/19 -T cell infusion as 
per Table 1. DLT will be defined a grade 3- 4 non -hematologic toxicity 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to the infusion of CAR -20/19 -
T cells. All deaths (grade 5 toxicity) in the first 28 days felt to be either 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to CAR -20/19- T cell therapy 
will be considered a DLT. CRS related DLTs and hematologic DLT 
are defined in the protocol (section 3.4)

  Version Date: 6/18/2019  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background  
CD19 and CD20 are antigens expressed on both healthy B  cells and a multitude of  B cell- 
derived hematological malignancies including non- Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) . An estimated 162,000 
new cases of  hematological malignancies were  expected to be diagnosed in 2015. [2]  
 CD19 and CD20 are both highly attractive targets for B cell neoplasm immunotherapy. CD19 is 
expressed by [CONTACT_304900] B cell malignancies including NHL, ALL, CLL, hairy cell leukemia, and a subset of acute myelogenous leukemia.[ 3] CD19 is a 95kD a glycoprotein present on the B cell 
surface from early development until differentiation into plasma cells. It is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and a component of a cell surface signal transduction complex that 
regulates signal transduction through the B cell  receptor. CD19 expression is res tricted to B 
lineage cells and is not expressed by [CONTACT_732454].[ 4, 5] Several clinical trials demonstr ated effectiveness of CD19 chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR) modified T cells in patients with B-cell ALL, CLL/SLL, or B-cell NHL. [6-10]  
 
CD20 is a non -glycosylated [ADDRESS_1000638] following plasma cell differentiation. [11, 12] Monoclonal 
antibodies against CD20 are effective in treating B cell malignancies. Unlike CD19 CAR, CD20 
CAR-T t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_732393]. [13, 14]  
 
The primary advantage of adoptive immunotherapy using CAR-T cells compared to alternative 
modalities lies in the ability of T cells  to expand and persist upon antigen binding of the target. 
[15] Persistence of CAR- T cells  in patients with refractory NHL and ALL has correlated with 
sustained progression free survival likely due to the long- term surveillance these cells provide 
against recurrent malignancy. [6] However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_732394], not all patients respond 
to this treatment and even those who have achieved remission may relapse. An important mechanism of relapse to both targeted monoclonal antibody treatment and CAR-T therapy was 
shown to be downregulation of the targeted receptor allowing tumor cells to escape 
destruction. [7, 16] Given the overlap of CD19 and CD20 expression on B cell s (Figure 2)  we 
speculate that simultaneous targeting of these two separate B cell  receptors may result in a 
more complete B cell  ablation and a reduced risk of tumor cell escape.  
 
In this Phase 1/1b  study we first hope to demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing CAR- T 
cells expressing scF v specific for CD20 -CD19  (CAR -20/19-T) in a completely closed system 
using the CliniMACS  Prodigy device and then determine the safety of this dual targeted CAR in 
a first -in-human study of patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies. Secondary 
outcome s will include response rates, and observed toxicities of the treatment, specifically the 
development of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) [7], an inflammatory storm that has been seen 
with previous CAR-T t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].

1.2 Investigational Agent(s)  
The investigational agent in this protocol is the CAR -20/19- T cells. The CAR -T cells will be 
produced in the Lymphocyte Propagation Laboratory (LPL) under an IND to be submitted to 
FDA prior to trial initiation. The Cell lines will be produced as follows: A non- mobilized 
mononuclear cell (MNC) apheresis product (MNC, Apheresis) will be obtained from the patient approximately [ADDRESS_1000639] been conjugated to paramagnetic particles and enriched for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.  
Minimally 1.[ADDRESS_1000640] reagent, which 
consists of nanoparticles conjugated to CD3 and CD28. The cells wil l be incubated for 24 hours 
at 37oC and 5% CO2 prior to transduction.  The activated cells will then be incubated with a 
lenti-virus vector that will introduce a chimeric antigen receptor that will externally express 
antibody binding regions to CD19 and CD20, with transmembrane signaling domains from 4-
1BB and CD3ζ  (Figure 3) .  The cells will be further cultured in medium containing interleukin -2, 
fed, and expanded within the Prodigy culture chamber to numbers suitable for clinical use. After 
13-14 days of expansion in culture the cells will be washed and tested for expression of the 
CD20/CD19 antibody and for funct ion using cytotoxicity and IFN-ϒ production assays in 
response to B cells prior to infusion. The lines will undergo further testing for sterility, vi ability, 
average copy number/cell, VSVg qPCR,  and for relative subsets include central memory, 
effector memory, and regulatory T cells. Processing prior to the final preparation for either 
immediateadministration or cryopreservation will be performed in a closed and sterile system 
using GMP grade reagents and materials obtained from Miltenyi Biotec within the ISO [ADDRESS_1000641] 
involved complex manual processing procedures that include: enrichment and/or depletion of 
cellular subsets  from starting cells, activation and exposure to viral vectors to introduce the 
chimeric antigen receptors, and cell expansion steps that may require weeks in culture.  There have been attempts to automate individual steps, or to close the system.[ 17] However, the 
CliniMACS Prodigy device (M iltenyi Biotec) is the first computer -controlled unit that automates 
each of the required processing steps while in a completely closed system. [17, 18] The Prodigy 
device has been approved for use in cell separation procedures and for the selection and 
culture of antigen reactive T cells. [19, 20]  We will use the CliniMACS Prodigy for the 
automated, closed system processing of the CAR- 20/19 -T cell line to be used in this study.

CD19 and CD20 positive malignancies.  While the construction and the vector (gammaretroviral 
vectors vs lentiviral vectors) used to create CAR T cells has varied, t he incorporation of a co-
stimulatory signaling domain in 2nd generation CARs with either CD28 or 4- 1BB (CD137)  
increases  the potency of these cells.[21, 22] Lentiviral vectors have been favored due to their 
ability to transduce non -dividing and dividing cells, insert a large genetic segment and allow for 
long-term transgene expression. [23-25] The pre -clinical data supporting the efficacy of CAR 
cells in xenograft models is published [26-28] and more recently the feasibility of the production 
of a dual antigen CAR- 20/19-T cell was presented. [29] This preclinical model established the  in 
vitro effectiveness of cytotoxic tumor cell killing by [CONTACT_732455] a decreased level  of antigen escape by [CONTACT_100276]- regulation when compared t o single 
antigen targeted CAR- T cells .[30]

The CliniMACS Prodigy device was recently introduced to the North American market as a follow -up to the CliniMACS Cell Separation System.  The MCW Cell Processing laboratory has 
an extensive experience with the CliniMACS Cell Separation systems , having employed them  
since 2005 for clinical protocols involving graft engineering to deplete and/or enrich specific 
cellular subsets as detailed below:  
 
 
MCW’s experience with the CliniMACS Cell Separation system indicates that the device 
produces reproducible and highly purified target populations, rigorous depletions of unwanted 
populations, and consistent recoveries of >50% of desired cell subsets. The MCW Cell 
Therapy Lab has additional experience with use of this device in a multi -center trial 
conducted by [CONTACT_732456] (CTN), CTN0303 that 
resulted in the FDA approval of the device for clinical use. [CONTACT_29898]  (previous Lab Dierctor)  
had primary responsibility for preparing the Standard Operating Procedures for the devic e’s 
use and analyzing the device’s performance in that trial [31] as well as her current 
participation on the steering committee of the ongoing CTN1301 multi -center trial. The 
Prodigy device incorporates the same technology as the Cell Separation System but with 
additional functionalities that include pre -separation steps and post -separation culture steps.  
 
Preclinical Experience using CliniMACS Prodigy Device to produce CAR -T cells  
In September 2015,  [CONTACT_732504], Assistant Lab Director,  underwent 2 ½ days of intensive 
training to learn the steps  of CAR- T cell production via the Prodigy device at Lentigen 
Technology, Inc.  Eight preclinical experiments using the CliniMACS Prodigy  were conducted . 
Three experiments were performed using a CD19 vector with a design similar to the CD20/CD19 vector to be used clinically, 4 were using a research grade production of the vector 

 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  26 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  to be used clinically, and the 5th experiment used the GMP grade vector that will be used for the 
clinical protocol . For all 8 experiments cells were processed  through the CD4/CD8 positive cell 
enrichment phase. There were two failed experiments of these first [ADDRESS_1000643] caused by  a failure of aseptic technique during 
an open processing step ; a step  that would not be a factor for the clinical study. The second 
failure was device- related secondary to a software update that was not properly verified by [CONTACT_732457] . The error  prevented us from moving forward af ter the cell 
enrichment phase. The first line that was generated was compromised by [CONTACT_732458] [ADDRESS_1000644] processing will begin no longer than 48 hours after 
collection. The results  obtained are summarized below.

The enriched cells were highly purified for CD4+ and CD8+ cells.  While CD4 is limited to T 
cells, CD8 is also expressed on a subset of NK cells that may or may not be CD3+.  An average 
of 90±1 0% of the enriched cells were CD3+ and 6±9% were CD3 -CD56+ NK c ells that express 
a form of CD8 that has a lower antigen density than CD3+CD8+ T cells.  >50% of the starting 
target population of CD4+ plus CD8+ cells were  recovered.  Importantly monocytes, which are 
known to suppress T cell proliferation of patient -derived material, were  absent. [32, 33]  
 Cell Expansion:   Cell lines were started using 1.0 x 10
8 starting CD4/CD8 enriched cells and 
were harvested on day 13.  The first experiment using a buffy coat product as the starting material expanded only 5.4-fold from the start, likely due to the age of the cells at the start of 
processing.  One line using the CD19 vector expanded 25.7 -fold and the 4 lines using the 
CD20/CD19 vector expanded 414.5, 33. 8, 24.5  and 24.8 -fold.  Therefore, expansion exceeded 
the expected results from the Lentigen training experience of approximately 20- fold 
 Transduction efficiency:  The percentage of  viable  transduced cells was measured by [CONTACT_732459] L 
expression, a protein unique to immunoglobulin kappa light chains. [34]  Expression is shown in 
the table below and flow data from  one representative line is shown in Figure 4.

IIT-CAR -T-Shah  28 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/[ADDRESS_1000646] Expansion Phenotype:  The phenotype of the expanded population changed from the 
starting CD4/CD8 enriched cells in that fewer CD3- CD56+ NK cells expanded, as shown most 
clearly for line # 3. The percentage of CD8+ cells increased from the starting cells expect for 
Line #1 where the line was greatly  enriched for CD4+ cells, possibly due to the age of the cells 
at the start of the culture. The goal is to have both CD4+ and CD8+ cells in the cultures, though 
cytotoxicity is expected to be mediated predominately by [CONTACT_8671]8+ T cells.  CD4+ CAR cells are expected to provide a helper function to the CD8+ cells secondarily to activation after exposure 
to the ligand bearing B cell.  CAR- T cell line viability at the time of harvest was 90.1± 6.5%.

It is important that any method of CAR -T cell production should preserve a population of central 
memory T cells to ensure longevity in circulation.  An advantage of immunotherapy using CAR -
T cells is that during transduction the cells are not being expanded through antigen stimulation  
and thus should not become enriched for T cells with an exhausted phenotype (Terminal 
Memory T cells).  As shown in figure 5 below for  Line#5, a population of Central Memory CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells are maintained using the CAR- 20/19- T cell vector manufactured both in the 
CliniMACS Prodigy and using plates  followed by [CONTACT_732460] G -Rex Device (Wilson -Wolf, 
Inc).

Figure 5 : T cell subsets were identified by [CONTACT_732461]4 or CD8 positive cells and then assessing the percentage of 
cells expressing CD45RA and CD62Ligand.  Naïve T cells are CD45RA+/CD62L+. Central Memory (CM) T cells are 
CD45RA -/CD62L+, Effector Memory (EM) T cel ls are CD45RA -/CD62L -, and Terminal (exhausted) CD8+ T cell 
effectors are CD45RA+/CD62L-.  Data shown are from Line #5.  
 
Lines #1, #2, and #3 were tested for the presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs) before and after 
line generation.  Low numbers of Tregs were present in the starting fractions, but were 
undetectable in the lines post expansion, indicating that our approach does not enrich for 
populations that might suppress tumor killing.   
 
Effector cell function:  Effector cell function was measured both in 51Cr release cytotoxicity 
assays and by [CONTACT_732462]-
culture.  All the lines, except  the Line #1 experiment , mediated lytic activity to B cell lines 
expressing both CD19 and CD2 ( Raji or EBV transformed B cells ). This was likely due to the 
failure of the CD8+ transduced cells to expand in this line.  However , both the few CD8+ cells 
and the CD4+ cells produced IFN -γ after co -culture with B cell targets  We obtained K562 cells 
that were separately transduced with CD19 and CD20 after production of Line #4 the second CD20/CD19 transduced line and could demonstra te preferable killing of both transduced targets 
in addition to Raji cell killing, though this line did contain a higher percentage of CD3+CD56+ 
cells tha n the other lines after expansion that resulted in detectable lysis of the parental K562 
line.  However, an I FN-ϒ intracellular cytokine assay showed cell activation only after co -culture 
with the transduced lines, Raji cells, but not parental K562 as shown in Figure 6.

was greatly reduced by [CONTACT_465962]56+ cells, but failed to stimulate IFN-ϒ production even 
without CD56+ cell reduction.  For both Line #4 and Line #5 depletion of CD56+ cells had little 
effect on the killing of CD19 or CD20 expressing target cells.

  Version Date: 6/18/[ADDRESS_1000647] impressive outcomes with combination chemotherapy, those with high- risk 
cytogenetics or a Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome do not fare as well despi[INVESTIGATOR_732395]. Adults have significantly worse prognosis than children. [35] 
Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732396], and many patients are unable to tolerate 
the successive lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy necessary to achieve disease control. [36]  
 CD19 positivity is  almost ubiquitous in ALL and is a marker used in diagnosis of the disease. 
Consequently, many of the first CD19 CAR-T cell studies involved patients with either relapsed 
or refractory ALL with remarkable outcomes. In a combined pediatric/adult ALL study, a 
complete remission (CR) was achieved in 90% of patients with relapsed ALL with sustained remissions in two -thirds of those patients. [6]  
 
B-cell Lymphomas  
There are several subtypes of B cell NHL, including Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B cell  
lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), CLL/SLL (small lymphocytic lymphom a), mantle 
cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) , and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma 
(LPL)/Waldenstroms Macroglobulinemia (WM). As these are mature B cell  malignancies, CD20 
expression is almost universal, and treatment with rituximab is standard of care in all 
subtypes. [37] Standard first line therapy includes the CD20 antibody rituximab in combination 
with cytotoxic chemotherapy. After relapse, salvage chemotherapy +/ - autologous transplant are 
considerations and can cure a proportion of patients. However, treatment options for those 
failing second line treatment or refractory to first or second line treatment are quite limited.[ 38]  
 Similar to CD20, CD19 expression is also seen in most B cell  lymphomas although the level of 
expression varies with histologic subtype.[ 39]  CD19 CAR-T t herapy resulted in dramatic 
responses in a heavily pretreated population of patients with multiple histologic subtypes of 
lymphoma.  The initial publication for CAR -T cell therapy against CD19 demonstrated significant 
efficacy in 3 patients with relapsed, refractory CLL[ 40]. In a single arm study utilizing a C D28, 
CD3ζ co -stimulatory domain CAR-T cells, 8/15 patients treated with anti -CD19 CARs achieved 
a CR. Four of seven patients with chemo refractory DLBCL achieved CR; these were durable in 
3 patients. [9] In another study, presented at ASH  2015, patients with relapsed, refractory 
DLBCL, MCL, and FL treated with  CD19 CAR-T cells had an overall response rate of 68% with 
minimal toxicity. [10] More recent data from ASH 2016 from KITE, a large pharmaceutical

patients with relapsed, refractory NHL with 39% of patients having an ongoing response at 3 months. [41] Additionally, from ASH 2016, ibrutinib refractory patients receiving CAR -T cells 
against CD19 were found to have an overall response rate of 76% with CRs achieved in 5 patients. [42] These above data support the effic acy of CAR -T cells in both NHL and CLL.   
CAR-T Therapy  
The CAR approach uses genetically programmed, patient -derived lymphocytes transfected with 
chimeric receptor genes to combine the effector functions of T lymphocytes with the ability of 
antibodies to recognize predefined surface antigens with high specificity in a non -major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted manner. [43] Consequently, CAR -T cells  have the 
ability to recognize intact membrane proteins independent of antigen processing or presentation 
by [CONTACT_40689]’s immune cells. CARs typi[INVESTIGATOR_732397] a single chain variable fragment (scFv) 
extracellular domain to bind tumor or virus linked to an intracellular s ignaling domain that 
mediates T cell activation. In principle, universal targeting vectors can be constructed because the scFv binds to native cell surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_732398] 
(interaction with recipi[INVESTIGATOR_732399]). The scFv antibody, contains 
the V
H and V L chains joined by a peptide linker of about 15 residues in length.[ 44]  We intend to 
use a second generation CAR approach which provides costimulatory signaling domains 4- 1BB 
and CD3ζ together with two scFv  chains recognizing both CD19 and CD20. [15, 45] (Figure 3) 
There are several potential limitations to activity of CAR-T cells: 1) the tumor must express the 
target antigen on the cell surface; 2) large amounts of shed or soluble antigen could inhibit the 
CAR-T cells; 3) the chimeric receptor may be immunogenic, resulting in the elimination of the 
redirected T cells by [CONTACT_732464].  
 
1.6 Rationale for Lymphodepletion and CAR -T cell  dosing  
Lymphodepletion  
It is increasingly clear that adoptive immunotherapy strategies are more effective in the context of homeostatic T cell proliferation – the proliferation of naive T cells  and their differentiation into 
memory -like T cells when total numbers of naive T cells are reduced by [CONTACT_732465]. Lymphodepletion also eliminates regulatory T cells and other competing elements of the immune system that act as “cytokine sinks”, enhancing the availability of 
cytokines such as IL- 7 and IL- 15.[46, 47] In this protocol we propose to transfer CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000648] utilized a 
combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, pentostatin, or disease specific 
chemotherapeutic agents. [7, 9, 10, 40, 48, 49] Given the heterogeneity  of previous CAR trials  
and using the previously published literature, we will, like most other institutions, utilize a 
combination of a purine analog (fludarabine)  with cyclophosphamide, which is the most common 
lymphodepletion regimen used.[ 48, 49] The regimens for this trial is listed in section 6.1.  
 Dose Rationale  
Previous literature has d emonstrated a response to CAR -T cells  at a variety of dose levels from 
1.0-5.0 x10
6 cells/kg to 1 .0-5.0x109 CAR-T cells as a flat , weight independent  dose .[9, 10, 40] 
Although an optimal dose has not been determined, based on prior studies, our goal dose level is 2.5 x 10
6 cells/kg. However, due to concern for increased toxicity with a dual targeted CAR -T 
cell, we will start at a dose level of 2.5 x 105 cells/kg and dose escalate per our study design 
(Section 6.4)  to our target dose . Based on FDA recommendations we w ill dose per kg for 
uniformity and the dose will be maxed at a weight of 80 kilograms. Recent data regarding cell 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  33 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  dose optimization presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in 2016 
demonstrated that administration in split -dose fashion may improve safety without altering 
efficacy and that a flat cell dose of 108 was the optimal dose level.  Higher doses led to more 
CRS related deaths. [50, 51] Based on that data we will split our infusion  during the phase 1 
portion over 2 days, 30% on Day 0 and 70% on Day 1. If there is no significant toxicity during 
the phase [ADDRESS_1000649] ed CAR -T cells with similar 4 -1BB and CD3ζ co -stimulatory domains. [48, 49] Given 
that CAR -T cell expansion occurs in vivo post infusion, there has not been clear evidence of 
dose response related to efficacy or toxicity.   
 
1.7 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits  
Potential Risks  
Patients enrolled on this study will be exposed to a genetically engineered autologous T cell. 
Potential risks  of the CAR -20/19- T cell s include the following:  
 
• B cell ablation and consequent increased risk of infection: As both healthy and malignant 
B cells express CD19 and CD20 antigens, B cell  ablation with consequent elimination of 
immunoglobulin production is an expected side effect of administration of the CAR-
20/19- T cell s. This may be transient or permanent depending  on the longevity of the 
CAR-T cells; it generally resolves when the CAR- 20/19- T cells are cleared. Patients with 
persistent low levels of immunoglobulins can be given intravenous immune globulin if felt 
to be indic ated by [CONTACT_24018].  
 
• Immune Reaction: Although we are utilizing autologous T cells, it is possible that the 
processing will make these cells immunogenic and that patient s will have an immune 
response directed against the scFv . If such a response occurs, it is possible that the 
cells will be rejected or a serious allergic reaction will occur. Thus  far, such allergic  
reactions have not been reported in clinical studies of CAR-T cells. [6, 8, 9, 40] 
Additionally patients can get exacerbation of pre -existing auto -immune conditions or 
development of new auto- immune or neurologic conditions.  
 
• Transformation:  Gene  transfer may result in  new tumors derived from genetically 
modified cells , due to incorporation of viral DNA, which may dysregulate genes 
controlling cell apoptosis and proliferation leading to an uncontroll ed malignant clone or 
new hematologic malignancy . Again , this is not yet  report ed in clinical studies of CAR-T 
cells in human patients , which now number greater than 100 . [6, 8, 9, 40] 
 
• Graft -Versus -Host Disease  (GVHD) : In patients who have underwent previous 
allogeneic transplant and then relapse with disease and receive CAR -T therapy with 
allogeneic cells, one potential risk is re -activation of GVHD. This was not seen in one 
recent prospective study of patients receiving allogeneic CAR- T cells from their donor. 
[52] 
 
• Risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) related to lymphodepleting chemotherapy or CAR-T 
cells:  The risk of TLS  is dependent on the burden of disease and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_732400]. 
There are reports of patients treated with CD19 CAR- T cells  developi[INVESTIGATOR_732401]. Therefore, all patients will be closely monitored both before and after 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  34 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  chemotherapy and CAR- 20/19- T cell  infusions including blood tests for potassium, uric 
acid, and calcium . All subjects will receive allopurinol prophylactically. TLS resulting in 
renal insufficiency, or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_732402], or evidence of organ dysfunction will be 
managed with intravenous fluids and rasburicase as needed and determined by [CONTACT_732466]. Appropriate clinical therapy will be administered should any 
significant TLS  occur.  
 
• Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) : CRS is an  inflammatory syndrome that occurs as a 
result of T cell activation and proliferation associated with engagement of the targeted 
antigen. It manifests when large number of lymphocytes become activated and release 
inflammatory cytokines. Its symptoms  (Figure 8) can vary from mild flu- like complaints 
with fevers, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, headache,  and rash to a severe inf lammatory 
storm that can result  in hypotension, multi -system organ failure, shock, and even death 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_40792] -cytokine therapy and steroids . [1, 53, 54]  It is associated with 
markedly increased production of acute phase reactants such as C -reactive protein 
(CRP) and ferritin  as well as increases in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).  The 
presentation of CRS is most similar with MAS (macrophage activation syndrome) or HLH (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis)  and is felt to be a reaction to the immune 
activation that occurs with antigen binding by [CONTACT_419530]-T cells. Diagnosis of MAS or HLH 
is based on the 2004 HLH criteria (Appendix C). [55]                      
 
It is unclear if the development of CRS predicts clinical response.  Initial reports of CRS 
in CAR- T cell  clinical trials revealed dramatically increased levels of IL -6 that peak 
during maximal T  cell proliferation. Inhibition of IL-6 binding with the IL -6 receptor 
antibody, tocilizumab  results in a rapid and dramatic improvement in the life-threatening  
sympt oms associated with CAR-T t herapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. It is unclear if this inhibition dampens the 
efficacy of the modified T cells. [53, 56]  Given the unique presentation of C RS 
associated with CAR- T cell  therapy , a revised grading system has been recommended 
for appropriate classification of degree of  toxicity. We will employ  this revised grading 
system when evaluating patients with CRS in this study. [1]  
  
 
Figure 8  
Clinical Symptoms associated with CRS [1] 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
• CRS related Neurological Toxicity:  Neurological toxicity is a  specific risk that has been 
observed with anti- CD19 CAR- T cell therapy. This has manifested with symptoms  such 
as hallucinations, delirium, aphasia, and confusion. These toxicities range from mild to 
severe (requiring ventilator support for airway protection). [1, 53, 57, 58] Neurological 
toxicity generally emerges within the first week after anti- CD19 CAR-T cell infusion, and 

 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  35 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/[ADDRESS_1000650] toxicity mediated by T cells on CNS tissue. [56] The neurological toxicities 
reported with anti -CD19 CAR- T cell therapy to date have generally been medically 
manageable and reversible.  However, recently Juno Therapeutics reported 3 deaths due 
to CNS toxicity as a result of their anti -CD19 CAR- T cell  trial.[ 59] Their CAR utilizes a 
different signaling domain than the one proposed in this study. In addition, we will 
require prophylactic levetiracetam  in all patients at the time of lymphodepletion 
chemotherapy to prevent potential  neuro toxicity.  
 
• Infection: Patients who receive fresh CAR- T cells are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_732403]. To 
decrease this risk, in process test ing (Appendix D) will be performed prior to start of 
lymphodepletion chemotherapy. Should the cultures return positive post -infusion 
appropriate antibiotics and infectious disease work -up will be performed.  
 
Potential risks associated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy  
A combination of fludarabine with cyclophosphamide will be utilized for lymphodepletion in all 
patients underg oing treatment with CAR- 20/19- T cell s. Potential risks associated with this 
combination chemotherapy include the following  
 
• Cytopenias : Cytotoxic chemotherapy can result  in drug- induced pancytopenia placing 
the patient at risks of several complications including bleeding related to 
thrombocytopenia, infection related to neutropenia, or fatigue/hypotension associated 
with anemia. Patients will be allowed to receive prophylactic transfusions as indicated in 
Appendix E . In the event of neutropenic fever, patients will be appropriately managed 
with broad spectrum antibiotics.  
 
• Tumor Lysis Syndrome: As defined above, patients will be monitored for TLS post 
treatment with both lymphodepleting and CAR- 20/19- T cell  treatment.  
 
• Organ Toxicity: Any cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen can result in organ damage as 
defined as hypoxia (requiring O2), an elevated creatinine, neurological toxicity, or 
elevations in liver function tests. These parameters will be monitored per our follow -up 
schedule in Table 1.  
 Unknown Risks  
In the setting of genetic therapy and a first -in-human study there are potential unknown risks. 
The degr ee of CRS with dual antigen binding has not been previously tested; it is possible that 
this will lead to a more robust immune response, and therefore more severe CRS, than 
previously seen. Additionally,  as there is limited long- term data in patients treated with CAR- T 
cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], it is unknown if there will be treatment -related secondary malignancies  or other 
unexpected toxicities  in the future.  
 
Potential Benefits  
Patients with relapsed leukemia or lymphoma as based on the inclusion criteria have very poor 
outcome s with standard treatments options. Allogeneic transplant can be offered to those

[ADDRESS_1000651] significant efficacy in 
the treatment of patients with lymphoma and leukemia. However, not all patients respond , and 
those that do respond can still experience progressive disease. In the setting of monoclonal 
antibodies  such as rituximab (CD20 targeted  antibody) , one method of resistance has been the 
downregulation of the CD20 receptor leading to tumor cell escape. [16] Similarly, the proposed 
mechanism of relapse in CD19 positive ALL treated with CD19 CAR- T cells  has been 
downregulation of the CD19 receptor and development of a clonal CD19 negative population. [7] 
Preclinical studies have demonstrated the decreased downregulation of tumor cell antigens 
when treated with combined CD20/CD19 CAR- T cells .[29]  We hypothesize that a dual targeted 
CD20/CD19  CAR- T cell  treatment will be more efficacious than single antigen targeting and will 
decreased the risk of progression or relaps e after treatment.

  Version Date: 6/18/2019  3 STUDY DESIGN  
3.1 General Description 
This is a phase 1 /1b, interventional single arm, open label, treatment study designed to evaluate 
the safety and feasibility of infusion of CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000654] failed prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The primary objective is safety  of infusion  and 
feasibi lity of manufacturing CAR- 20/19 -T cells at MCW -FH. We will monitor and describe safety, 
tolerability and engraftment potential of CAR- 20/19- T cells in these patients. The general 
protocol schema is shown i n Figure [ADDRESS_1000655]  for CAR- 20/19-T manufacturing. The apheresis product will be washed 
free of platelets and plasma and the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be purified from the MNC , 
activated through the CD3 and CD28 antigens, then transduced with the CD19 and CD20 scFv 
regions coupled to CD3ζ/ 4-1BB signaling domains using a lentiviral vector. T he cells will be 
expanded in vitro washed from culture, removed from the device,  and either administered to the 
patient within 48 hours of production or cryopreserved for later administration. In process and 
end of production release testing will be performed ( Appendix D for schema)  The entire 
manufacturing process up until removal from culture will be performed using a computer 
controlled program within the closed system of the CliniMACS Prodigy device.  
  
Patients will receive CAR- 20/19- T cell s through a central venous catheter and then  will be 
monitored closely with physical examinations and blood tests to assess safety, engraftment , and 
persistence of the CAR- 20/19- T cells at regular intervals as outlined (Table 1). Response 
assessments will also be performed for secondary  endpoint analysis as described in Section 
3.5. Patients will be followed daily from Day 0 to Day +7. Then seen on Day  +10 (+/ - 1 day), 
Day +14 (+/ - 2 days), Day +21 (+/ - 2 days) and then on Day 28 (+/ - 3 days). After Day +28 
patients will be seen monthly up to 6 months, every 3 months up to year 1, and every 6 months 
up to year 2. Details of further follow -up are in listed in the study calendar. Following  completion 
of this study, subjects will be enrolled onto a r oll-over long-term follow -up protocol for up to an 
additional thirteen  years to assess the diagnosis of long -term health problems, such as 
development of new malignanc ies and persistent of CAR -T cells . 
3.2 Number of S ubjects  
A maximum of 24 patients will be treated with CAR -20/19- T cells . In the phase 1 portion an 
initial dose escalation cohort using 3+[ADDRESS_1000656] has enrolled on the Phase 1 portion of the study,  the Phase 
1b portion of the study will be open to accrual of 9 patients) .  
3.3 Primary Endpoint(s)  
Primary feasibility endpoints assessed include:  
Ability to manufacture CAR -20/19- T cells from patient apheresis products using the CliniMACS 
Prodigy processing device (Milteny i Biotec). The number of T cell lines that do not meet criter ia 
for T cell purity, total transduced T cell content, viability, and sterility will be determined.  
 
 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  38 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  Primary safety endpoints assessed include:  
 Occurrence of adverse events, defined as either CRS related Grade 3/4 toxicity or other NCI 
CTCAE version 5.0  non-hematologic ≥ grade 3 signs/symptoms, laboratory toxicities and clinical 
events that are possibly, probably or definitely  related to study treatment at any time from the 
infusion until week 4. The revised CRS grading system will be used for patients who develop 
CRS  (Appendix G).[1] This will in clude infusion toxicity and any toxicity possibly related to the 
CAR- 20/19- T cells including but not limited to:  
 
a. Fevers  
b. Rash  
c. Hepatic dysfunction  
d. Pulmonary infiltrates or other pulmonary toxicity (unrelated to concomitant infections)  
e. CRS/MAS  
f. Neurologic toxicity  
 
3.4 Dose Limiting Toxicity  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as a grade 3- 4 non- hematologic toxicity possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to the infusion of CAR -20/19- T cells. All deaths (grade 5 toxicity) 
in the first 28 days felt to be either possibly, probably, or definitely related to CAR -20/19 -T cell 
therapy will be considered a DLT. All Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity felt to be either possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to CAR- 20/19- T cell infusion will be considered a DLT. If multiple 
toxicities are seen, the presence of a DLT will be based on the most severe toxicity 
experienced. The DLT will be based on the tolerability observed during the first 28 days of 
treatm ent/observation.  
 CRS and neurotoxicity are possible DLTs that can occur as a result of administration of CAR -T 
cells. For this protocol, any grade 4 CRS related toxicity per revised CRS grading system 
(Appendix G) will be considered a DLT. In addition, patients with Grade 3 CRS toxicity that 
does not improve to grade 1 or 2 despi[INVESTIGATOR_732405]/or 
immunosuppression within 7 days will also be considered a DLT. All Grade 4 neurotoxicity will 
also be considered a DLT and similarly any Grade 3 neurotoxicity which does not improve to 
grade 1 or 2 despi[INVESTIGATOR_732406] 7 days will also be considered a DLT. All infusional 
reactions ≥grade [ADDRESS_1000657] of lymphodepletion, persistent Grade≥3 
neutropenia that does not resolve to Grade≤2 neutropenia by [CONTACT_2006] +28 will be considered a DLT. Refractory thrombocytopenia and anemia are known potential complications among 
heavily pre- treated patients with hematological malignancies and lymphodepletion 
chemotherapy and will be managed per supportive care guidelines. While grade and toxicity will 
be recorded for this clinical trial the degree of thrombocytopenia/anemia will not count towards 
our DLT evaluation.  
 
The first 28 days were chosen for the DLT monitoring period given the variability in the 
presentation of CRS , which can occur within hours to weeks after infusion [1]. Additionally, as 
more severe CRS tends to occur earlier after infusion compar ed to non -severe CRS , 28 days 
was felt to be an appropriate monitoring period.[ 6] The attribution of adverse events with respect 
to their relationship to the infusion of CAR- 20/19- T cells will be th e responsibility of the site PI.

  Version Date: 6/18/2019  3.5 Secondary Endpoint(s)   
Secondary endpoints include assessment of the following:  
 
1. The number of patients who have CAR- 20/19- T cells manufactured but not infused due 
to failure to meet release criteria.  
2. Disease  assessment will include the following:

Since patients with a variety of histologies will be treated – response will be 
assessed using disease appropriate imaging/marrow and international consensus criteria most applicable to the disease (Section 10). 
o Repeat bone marrow biopsy and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_732407] (i.e., patients with baseline disease on bone marrow 
biopsy) . These will be analyzed by [CONTACT_83549] (MFC) and/or 
molecular analysis of immunoglobulin rearrangements, as available.  
o Duration of response in responders  
o Relapse rates and time to  relapse  
o Cause of death in treated patients  
o Overall survival and progression free survival of individual patients  
 
   Exploratory Endpoints 
1. Characterize CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000658] the CAR- 20/19- T cell  construct or other 
elements of the transgene or vector and  assess correlation with loss of detectable CAR-
20/19- T cell s (loss of engraftment).  
3. Evaluate the effect of CAR -20/19- T cells on B cell and plasma cell compartments 
assessed by [CONTACT_732470] B cell populations and plasma 
cell populations.  
4. Describe the incidence of new -onset secondary malignancies if any.  
5. Determine the utility  of a T -cell diversity assay in predicting outcomes with CAR -T cell 
therapy

 T- cell repertoire diversity testing from CAR -T sample 
 
A chemotherapy cycle ([ADDRESS_1000671])  is planned for all patients  
to start within approximately one week of CAR- 20/19- T cell infusion . Patients will receive  a 
combination of fludarabine/cyclophosphamide lymphodepletion. These chemotherapy 
agents are all commercially available and will be infused per institutional standards. 
Antimicrobial prophylaxis and TLS prophylaxis is outlined in Appendix E . 
 
The chemotherapy will be planned so that it completes BEFORE the infusion of the first dose of CAR -20/19 -T cells. The purpose of the chemotherapy is to induce lymphopenia to 
facilitate expansion of  infused T cells. Although  the chemotherapy is not investigational , 
patients  will be required to receive it at Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (FH)  and/or  the Medical College of 
Wisconsin Cancer Center. Patients will be started on allopurinol for tumor lysis prevention.

5.5 Study Withdraw al Proc edures 
Patient -Initiated Withdrawal :  A patient may decide to withdraw from the study at any time.  
 
Investigator -Initiated Withdrawal:   The Investigator will withdraw a patient whenever 
continued participation is no longer in the patient’s best interests. Reasons for withdrawing a 
patient include, but are  not limited to, disease progression, the occurrence of an adverse event 
or a concurrent illness  that prevents further administration of treatment, a patient’s request to 
end participation, a patient’s noncompliance or simply significant uncertainty on the  part of the 
Investigator that continued participation is prudent. There may also be administrative reasons to 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  50 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  terminate participation, such as concern about a patient’s compliance with the prescribed 
treatment regimen.  
 
Withdrawal Documentation Procedure :  The reason for study withdrawal and the date the 
patient was removed from the study must be documented in the case report form.  
6 TREATMENT PLAN 
6.1 Lymphodepletion  (within  1 week prior to CAR -20/19- T cell infusion)  
Patients will receive lymphodepleting conditioning regimen prior to CAR -20/19- T cells  starting 
on Day -4. Lymphodepletion will start based on the planned date of infusion of CAR -20/19 -T 
cells. Tumor lysis prevention with allopurinol  daily (dose per institutional standards)  will be 
initiated the day of chemotherapy.  Levetiracetam  (Keppra) prophylaxis dosed per institutional 
standards will be initiated in all patients to prevent possible neurologic toxicity.  Anti-emetics and 
steroids can be provided pre -treatment as per standard of care protocols for these treatment 
regimens. Please see Appendix E for guidelines for CAR -T cell infusion. The lymphodepletion 
regimens is as follows:  
 
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 on Day -4, -3, -2 and Cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 on Day -2[41] 
 
This regimen is based on published lymphodepletion protocols for adult patients receiving CD19 
CAR- T cells. Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide combination is the most utilized 
lymphodepletion regimen prior to CAR- T cell therapy  and the above regimen was presented  at 
ASH 2016 and used in a large cohort of >100 patients with published safety and toxicity data. 
[41, 48] Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide dosing will be based on actual body weight.  For 
patients who are neutropenic (ANC<1000 k/µL) at the start of lymphodepletion due to underlying 
hematologic disease or as a result of prior chemotherapy related toxicity, cyclophosphamide will 
be omitted from the lymphodepletion regimen.  
 
Phase 1 Dose Escalation /Expansion: CAR- 20/19 -T cells will be administered per actual body 
weight  in the lymphopenic phase on Day 0 & Day 1. Dose will be maxed at a weight of 80 
kilograms.  
 
Phase 1b Cohort : CAR- 20/19- T cells will be administered as a single dose on Day 0.  Dose will 
be maxed at a weight of 80 kilograms  
 6.2 Preparation of CAR -20/[ADDRESS_1000675] obtained from the patient on Day -15 will be washed free of 
platelets and plasma and the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells will be purified from the MNC, activated 
through the CD3 and CD28 antigens, then transduced with the CD20/CD19 CD3ζ/41BB 
lentiviral vector. The cells will be expanded in vitro, harvested from culture, and then 
administered within 48 hours of production in an isotonic electrolyte solution (Plasma -Lyte® A or 
Normo sol® R) containing 2.5% HSA or cryopreserved for administration in a freezing solution of 
Plasmalyte A or Normosol R containing 10% DMSO and 4% HSA.  
 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  51 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  Testing will be performed at two mandatory  time points (in process  day-[ADDRESS_1000676]) and

performed by a computer - controlled program using the CliniMACS Prodigy device.  
  
Cell thawing  (if indicated)   
For patients who require cryopreservation the following will be performed : The frozen cells will 
be thawed in the cell  processing lab and transported by [CONTACT_732477]’s bedside 
either at the inpatient oncology unit of FH  or the outpatient day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732414] a 
Hematology/Oncology  attendi ng. If the CAR- 20/19- T cell  product appears to have a damaged or 
leaking bag, or otherwise appears to be compromised, it should not be infused, and should be 
returned to production laboratory.  
 
Positive Sterility Test (after infusion)  
In the scenario that CAR- T cells are administered prior to completion of the [ADDRESS_1000678] operating procedure for positive cultures after infusion of cell therapy products. In general, this involves the following: 
 
1. Cell processing lab will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_732415].  
2. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_732416]-CAR -T-Shah  52 Version No.: 5

indicated based on the results of the sterility tests.  
4. Reporting —the PI [INVESTIGATOR_732418], IRB, and the FDA  
 
6.3 Administration of CAR -20/19- T cell  infusion on Day 0 and Day +1 (Phase 1) or Day 0 
(Phase 1b)  
Patients will receive the infusion of the CAR- 20/19 -T cells as an inpatient on the oncology unit 
or in the outpatient Day Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732419]/oncology attending. Patients will receive institutional standard for infusion reaction prophylaxis (e.g. , Acetaminophen 
and diphenhydramine hydrochloride, or other acceptable alternatives,  as pre -treatment). 
Patients will be on allopurinol for tumor lysis prevention and l evetiracetam  (Keppra) with 
initiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy  (See Appendix E for details) . Pretreatment with 
steroids is contraindicated.  Patients will receive CAR -20/19- T cells by [CONTACT_732478] a total viable, transduced, cell dose ranging from 1.0 x 10
5 cells/kg to 2.5 x 106 cells/kg 
based on phase of study.  The dose of cells may be limited if calculations performed at the time 
of administration or cryopreservation indicates that the patient would receive > 1.8 x 108 non-
viable cells/kg. Patients who fail to meet the target cell dose will be allowed infusion and will be followed for toxicity and adverse events as all other patients. The infusion s will occur 
approximately 1- 7 days following chemotherapy.  
Premedication  
Potential side effects following T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea.  The 
subject will be  pre-medicated with acetaminophen  and/or  diphenhydramine hydrochloride as per 
institutional standards  prior to the infusion of CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000679] fever not relieved by [CONTACT_58086]. It is recommended that patients not receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone 
(Solu -Medrol) or dexamethasone (Decadron) at any time, except in the case of a life -threatening 
emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on T cells. If corticosteroids are required for 
an acute infusional reaction, an initial dose of hydrocortisone 100 mg is recommended.  
 
Prophylaxis Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732420] -T cell therapy as recommended in 
Appendix E. Briefly levetiracetam  will be given for seizure prophylaxis, institutional standards 
will be applied for  pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) , viral, and neutropenic prophylaxis.  
 
Infusion  
On the day  of the first infusion (Day 0),  patients will have a CBC with differential, and 
assessment of T-cell subsets  prior to administration of CAR -20/19 -T cells since chemotherapy 
is given in part to induce lymphopenia.   
 
The CAR- 20/19 -T cell dose will be administered by [CONTACT_16228]. Dosing will be split during the 
phase 1 portion of the trial, with 30% given on day 0, and 70% given on day 1.  If there is no 
significant infusional toxicity, in the phase 1b portion of the trial cells will be  administered as a 
single dose on Day 0. As detailed above, the cells will be administered fresh or  thawed if 
indicated in the LPL and placed in a validated transport container at 1 -10oC and brought directly 
to the patient’s bedside.  If the CA R-20/19- T cell product appears  damaged or leaking , or 
otherwise appears to be compromised, it should not be infused, and should be returned to production laboratory.  The infusion will take place in the patient room on the oncology inpatient

  Version Date: 6/18/[ADDRESS_1000680] affixed to it a label containing 
the following: “FOR AUTOLOGOUS USE ONLY”. In addition, the label will have at least two 
unique patient identifiers such as the subject’s initials, birth date, and study number. Prior to the 
infusion, two individuals will independently verify all this information in the presence of the 
subject and so confirm that the information is correctly matched to the participant. Subjects will 
be infused and premedicated as described.  
 
Subjects’ vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], pulse, and blood pressure, pulse oximetry) will  
be done prior to dosing, at the end of the infusion and every 15 minutes thereafter for a minimum 
of 1 hour. A blood sample for determination of a baseline CAR- 20/19- T cell  level is obtained any 
time prior to the infusion and Day+1 (and sent to the LPL Labs)  and then will be completed  as per 
the study calendar. Emergency medical equipment (i.e., emergency trolley) will be available 
during the infusion in case the subject has an allergic response, or severe hypotensive crisis, or 
any other reaction to the infusion.  
 
Patients experiencing toxicities from their preceding cytoreductive chemotherapy will have their 
infusion schedule delayed until these toxicities have resolved. The specific toxicities warranting 
delay of T cell infusions include:  
 
1) Pulmonary : Requirement for supplemental oxygen >2L by [CONTACT_732479] 95% or presence of radiographic abnormalities on chest x -ray that are progressive; 
2) Cardiac:  New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management  
3) Hypotension:  requiring pressor support  
4) Active Infection : Fever>101 F and/or  positive cultures for bacteria, fungus, or virus. Patients 
who are unable to receive the CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000681] develops sepsis or systemic bacteremia following CAR-T- 
cell infusion, appropriate cultures and medical management should be initiated.

6.4 Dose Escalation Schedule  
For this phase 1/1b study we plan to include multiple histologies including CLL/SLL and B -cell 
NHL.  Based on previous CAR -T studies (as outlined in Section 1. 6) our goal treatment dose is  
2.5 x 106 cells/kg. Due to concern that a dual CAR -T cell may increase risk of CRS our starting 
dose for this study will be 2.5 x 105 cells/kg (1 log reduction) and we will escalate based on 
DLTs to our goal dose. We will utilize a 3+[ADDRESS_1000683] udy (Figure 9) . At each 
dose level, the first two patients will be monitored for a full 28 days after CAR -T infusion prior to 
subsequent patient’s treatment with CAR -T cells to allow monitoring of acute and sub- acute 
toxicities. After that patients will be  infused no sooner than at [ADDRESS_1000684] three patients wi th NHL or CLL/SLL 
will be treated with 2.5 x 105 cells/kg. If 0/3 patients experience a DLT, the dose will increase to 
7.5 x 105 cells/kg. If 1/3 patients at the 2.5 x 105 cells/kg experiences a toxicity,  then an 
additional three patients will be treated at this dose level. If ≤1/[ADDRESS_1000685]  a DLT at this 
level, the dose will increase to 7.5 x 105 cells/kg. If  ≥2/[ADDRESS_1000686] a DLT at 2.5 x 105 
cells/kg , the dose will de- escalate to 1.0 x 105 cells/kg. If 2/[ADDRESS_1000687] 
DLTs, the dose will also de- escalate to 1.0 x 105 cells/kg. If at the 1.0 x 105 cells/kg there are ≥2 
DLTs out of a maximum of 6 patients, the study will close due to excessive toxicity. If there is 0-
1 DLTs in 3 -6 patients, the 1.0 x 105 cells/kg dose will b e selected for expansion cohort ( Figure 
10).  
We will utilize a similar dosing schema should we escalate to the 7. 5 x 105 cells/kg dose. If there 
are 0- 1 toxicities out of 3 -6 patients, the dose will escalate to our goal dose of 2.5 x 106 cells/kg. 
If there are ≥2 toxicities in 3 -6 patients  at 7.5 x 105 dose, then the 2.5 x 105 cells/kg dose will be 
selected for our expansion cohort. At our goal dose level  (2.5 x 106 cells/kg) if there is 0- 1 DLTs 
out of 3 -6 patients, this dose will be selected for expansion. If there are ≥2 toxicities in 3- 6 
patients  at the 2.5 x 106 cells/kg dose, then the 7.5 x 105 cells/kg dose will be selected.  
Once a dose has been selected within the NHL and CLL/SLL cohort, this dose will be utilized for 
the Dose Expansion phase of the study  (Section 6.5) . The dose expansion cohort will proceed 
only after approval from the local IRB/DSMC and the FDA .

Patients who Fail to Produce Target Cell Dose  
 
It is possible that some patients fail to make the targeted  cell dose as required per our dose 
escalation/expansion schema ( Figures 9 & 10 ). For those patients, we will allow administration 
of CAR -20/19- T cells but these  patient s must be replaced on the study for the purposes of our 
Phase 1/1b  study.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_732421] -20/19- T cell administration and so these patients will undergo identical  
study procedures and will be followed for DLTs, AEs, and survival as all other patients. For this 
cohort of patients who receive a non- specified dose, if there is ≥33% rate of DLT as defined in 
section 3.4, then future pat ients who fail to make the desired dose level will no longer be 
allowed to be treated in this manner. Standard operating procedures for patients treated at a non-specified cell dose are listed in Appendix H.

Once a dose has been identified in our Dose Esca lation phase we will perform a Dose 
Expansion at that dose level (termed Dose Level X). We will evaluate an additional 6 patients i n 
NHL/CLL at this Dose Level X (Figure 10).  In this dose expansion phase is there are ≥2 
patients with DLTs, no further patients will be allowed enrollment.  
The dose expansion phase will commence after identification of a dose level in the dose 
escalation cohort and after approval from both internal and external monitoring agencies 
(DSMB/ IRB/FDA).  
6.6 Phase 1b (Single Dose of CAR -T cell)  
Once the final patient on the Phase [ADDRESS_1000688] the safety of single dose administr ation compared to 
fractionated dosing.  This phase will include a 9 patient expansion at 2.5 x 10
6 cells/kg CAR- T 
cells administered in a single dose (rather than split dose). The first two patients at this dose 
level will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732422] [ADDRESS_1000689] two patients, then additional patients  can receive cells either outpatient or inpatient 
and be treated as indicated.  This cohort will close if there is ≥3 DLTs among the nine treated 
patients.  
6.7 Treatment/Dose  Limiting Toxicity  
Management and dose modifications associated with the AEs are outlined in Section 7: Dosing 
Delays/Dose Modifications .  
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as a  grade 3 or 4 non- hematologic toxicity possibly, 
probably , or definitely  related to the infusion of CAR -20/19- T cell s. See section 3.[ADDRESS_1000690] 28 days of treatment/observation. If multiple toxicities are seen, the presence of dose 
limiting toxicity should be based on the most severe toxicity experienced.   
 Grade 3 or 4 CRS will be treated  initially with IL -6 inhibition with tocilizumab and/or 
corticosteroids  (Appendix F). Additional agents that can be used for refractory CRS include 
siltuximab or other immunosuppression a t the discretion of the PI. A detailed algorithm for the 
management of CRS  and neurotoxicity related to CAR -T cells for this study  is provided in 
Appendix F. Supportive care measures to consider for patients receiving CAR -T cells are 
provided in Appendix G. 
 
As cytokine release syndrome is a new entity observed with novel cellular therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], a modified 
grading system has been proposed for more appropriate assessment of dose  limiting toxicities. Figure 10 : Dose Expansion Phase

IIT-CAR -T-Shah  58 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  [1, 60] We will employ this grading system to accurately grade toxicity of our CAR- 20/19- T cell s 
and a copy of the grading system can be found in Appendix F.  
 
6.8 Usage of Concurrent/Concomitant Medications  
The investigational agent in this protocol is autologous CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000691] will not undergo metabolism as would a pharmaceutical therapy. As such, 
concurrent/concomitant medications can be prescribed at the discretion of the treating physician 
for treatment of symptomatic conditions such as fever, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, anxiety, etc. 
Antimicrobial prophylaxis can be started as per treating physician. This can include ciprofloxacin 
or cefepi[INVESTIGATOR_048] (or other appropriate antibiotic if allergic) for antibacterial prophylaxis, acyclovir  or 
alternative agent  for antiviral prophylaxis, fluconazole (or alternative agent as indicated ) for 
fungal prophylaxis, bactrim (or other PCP prophylaxis if sulfa allergic). Prohibited and limited therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732423] 6.9.   
 6.9 Dietary Restrictions  
On the inpatient service, patients will follow the FDA’s Food Safety for Cancer Patient 
Guidelines.  Otherwise no specific dietary recommendations are indicated for this study.  
 
6.10 Prohibited Medications  
Patients should be off all systemic steroids, oral or IV, (not including inhaled or intranasal 
steroids) at the time of apheresis  (for at least 7 days prior)  and again starting Day [ADDRESS_1000692] ration of the CAR -20/19- T cell s. Exception to this will be steroids  for replacement 
dosing for adrenally insufficient patients or steroids  for the purposes of the treatment of CRS  at 
the discretion of the investigators listed on this protocol.  
With regards to growth factors, long- acting products such as Neulasta (pegfilg rastrim) will not be 
permitted startin g Day -7 to Day +28. Given the potential risk of exacerbation of CRS or 
triggering of CRS, short -acting growth factors such as filgr astrim (neupogen) or sargramostim 
(leukine) will be limited to patients with persistent neutropenia  starting Day+[ADDRESS_1000693] Compliance  
CAR- 20/19- T cell s will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the 
investigator or identified sub-investigator (s). The appropriate study personnel will maintain 
records of study drug receipt and dispensing.  The study agent will be given on the inpatient 
oncology units. There will be no self -administered agents as part of the investigational portion of 
this protocol.  
6.[ADDRESS_1000694] received treatment on the CAR -20/19 -T cell protocol may be retreated if they 
meet the same inclusion/exclusion criteria as listed in the clinical protocol  and meet the 
following require ments:  
1. Patient must be ≥[ADDRESS_1000695] dose of CAR -20/19 -T cells but ≤24 months from 
initial treatment.

  Version Date: 6/18/[ADDRESS_1000696] <1% detectable CAR- T cells by [CONTACT_732480] 
3. Had demonstrated clinical benefit from the first dose (either PR or CR  at Day 28 
evaluation).  
4. Have a repeat biopsy that confirms either CD19 or CD20 positive disease post -CAR- T 
cell relapse.  
5. Have not received another genetically modified CAR -T cell product either commercially 
or as part of a separate clinical trial.  
 
Patients who are re -treated will not count towards our primary safety endpoint  but AEs and 
testing will be monitored/performed  in an identical fashion as their first infusion (see schedule of 
events). Research studies including t -cell repertoire studies, Paxgene RNA analysis, tryptophan 
metabolites , and QOL studies will not be repeated. Cells will be given as a single infusion on 
Day 0 and the  lymphodepletion regimen outlined in this protocol  will be utilized . Patients will not 
undergo repeat apheresis and CAR- T cell production, rather, they will receive remainder CAR -T 
cells that are cryopreserved from their initial production ( see section 9.1.[ADDRESS_1000697] cryopreservation) . Patients will receive no more than the goal dose of 2.5 x 
10^6 cells/kg  (max 80 kg) . If the patient does not have that dose, they will receive the remainder 
of the CAR -T cells left.  
To ensure safety of re- treatment, DLTs through Day [ADDRESS_1000698], a maximum of 3 patients will be allowed to be treated in this manner  with concurrent 
enrollment allowed. If there is ≤[ADDRESS_1000699] three patients, further patients will be 
allowed re- treatment w ith CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000700] met above 
criteria.  After enrollment of the 4th patient or beyond in this cohort, if the DLT rate exceeds 
≥33%, no further patients will be allowed retreatment.  
All patients will be followed for AEs, survival, response rates as per Table 1.  
7 D OSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
7.1 Dosing Administration/Delays  
Patients will r eceive the modified CAR- 20/19- T cell s in one fixed dose on Day 0 or two doses 
given 24 hours apart on Day 0 and Day +1 of this protocol. Patients will be either admitted to the 
oncology unit for this infusion or seen daily in the outpatient BMT Day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_732424] a hematology/oncology  attending. Criteria for infusion of cellular therapy 
include the following:  
1) No new medical complication that would unduly increase risk of infusion 
2) No requirement of supplemental oxygen >2L by [CONTACT_732481] >95%  
3) No active cardiac arrhythmias  not controlled with medical management  
4) No hypotension requiring pressor support 
5) Study treatment administration will not be delayed as a result of neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, or anemia, which are all potential risk s of lymphodepleting  
chemotherapy  
6) No uncontrolled active infectious complications  
7) No fever >101o F in last 24 hours prior to infusion

maximum of 7 days beyond their goal treatment date (Day 0). If there is not resolution of those 
issues, the patients will be taken off protocol.  
 For patie nts who received split dose cells, the  second dose of cells given on Day 1, patients 
must meet the above same criteria. In addition, patients who develop clinically significant 
toxicities within [ADDRESS_1000702] their subse quent infusion given. 
These include grade 2 or higher infusion reactions, allergic responses, cytokine release 
syndrome, cardiac or pulmonary toxicities, or others deemed clinically significant by [CONTACT_47203]. Transient grade 1  chills, nausea, vomiting and other mild expected infusion-
related toxicities that respond to usual supportive care measures will not require holding 
subsequent doses. Patients with fever ≥[ADDRESS_1000703] the second dose held for up to 7 days until there is resolution. Any questions about 
subsequent dosing should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. The second dose can be 
delayed up to maximum of 7 days after the initial dose as per the discretion of the  PI.

7.2 Monitoring and Toxicity Management  
Each patient receiving CAR- 20/19- T cells will be evaluable for safety. The safety  parameters 
include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical findings, and spontaneous 
reports of adverse events reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_1962].  Each patient will be assessed 
periodically for any  toxicity development as per the schedule of procedures ( Table 1). Toxicity 
will be assessed per the NCI CTCAE v 5.0 except for CRS which will be graded as previously  
defined.  
For expected cytopenias patients will be transfused platelets and red blood cells as per 
Appendix G.  
We will monitor specifically for the development of CRS , a known complication that can occur 
with the treatment of CAR modified T cells. Signs/symptoms related to CRS were listed in 
section 1.7 ( Figure 8). Grading of CRS will be by [CONTACT_732482] F. Any patient who develops fever as an outpatient will be admitted for 
work -up and evaluation o f CRS.  Detailed algorithm for CAR -T cell associated CRS or 
neurotoxicity based on current recommendations can be found in Appendix F. The current 
recommendations for CRS management include Tocilizumab and/or steroids as first -line 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Tocilizumab is a humanized, IgG1к antihuman IL- 6R monoclonal antibody approved 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  61 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  for the treatment of several rheumatological conditions. Tocilizumab prevents IL- 6 binding to 
both cell associated and soluble IL- 6Rs inhibiting signaling and has led to clinical improvement 
in patients with life- threatening CRS within 24 hours of administration. [1, 53] For patients failing 
to res pond after two doses of  tocilizumab, steroids will be second line for CRS. Further 
management beyond second line therapy wil l depend upon the judgment of the clinician and 
may i nclude additional immunosuppression such as Siltuximab or other agents that can  inhibit T  
cell proliferation/function.  
7.3 Other Toxicities  
Other toxicities include those associated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen which includes  fludarabine with cyclophosphamide.  
 
Hematologic Toxicities  Grade 3 or 4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are 
potential toxicities associated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy.  
Infection  Neutropenic  fever is a potential toxicity associated cytotoxic 
chemotherapy.  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  Can occur as a result of tumor cell death with treatment with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
Organ toxicity  Can be pulmonary, renal, liver, or cardiac toxicity related to 
chemotherapy administration 
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  62 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  8 A DVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS  AND REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS  
8.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
The investigator and his or her team will follow the Medical College of Wisconsin policies related to adverse event reporting. This information may be found on the 
Human Research Protection 
Program website . (http://www.mcw.edu/hrpp/InvestigatorsandStudyStaff.htm) 
Serious AE (SAE) means any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Death.  Results in death.  
• Life threatening . Is life threatening (refers to an AE in which the patient was at risk of 
death at the time of the event . It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] . Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_109577] (see clarification in the paragraph below on planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]).  
• Disability/incapacity . Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
(Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Medically important event . This refers to an AE that may not result in death, be 
immediately life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may be considered serious 
when, based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the patient, require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent [ADDRESS_1000704] of an infectious agent.  Examples of 
such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein 
transmitting Transm issible Spongiform Encephalopathy), pathogenic or nonpathogenic, 
is considered an infectious agent .  
Clarification should be made between a serious AE (SAE) and an AE that is considered severe in intensity (Grade 3 or 4), because the terms serious and severe are NOT synonymous . The 
general term severe is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a Grade 3 
headache) . This is NOT the same as serious,  which is based on patient/event outcome or action 
criteria described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a patient’s 
life or ability to function . A severe AE (Grade 3 or 4) does not necessarily need to be considered 
serious . Seriousness (not intensity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting 
obligations . Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (e.g. admission for CAR -T infusion) will not be considered 
an adverse event.

on the Human Research Protection Program website
 
(http://www.mcw.edu/hrpp/InvestigatorsandStudyStaff.htm) 
8.3 AE Attribution and Grading  
Adverse Event Grading   
Will be performed using the NCI CTCAE Version 5.0 except for CRS which will b e graded as 
described in Appendix F per clinical guidelines.  
Adverse Event Attribution 
Attribution is an assessment of the relationship between the AE and the medical intervention.  
Relationship Assessment:  In- Depth Definitions 
For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the subject will determine the 
adverse event’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below:  
Definitely Related: There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test 
result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to CAR -20/19- T cell administration and cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal of the 
drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacologically or 
phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  
Probably Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of 
other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, oc curs 
within  a reasonable time sequence to CAR- 20/19- T cell administration, is unlikely to be 
attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this 
definition.  
Possibly Related: There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., the event 
occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (e.g., the subject’s clinical condition, 
other concomitant events). Although an adverse event  from CAR -20/19- T cell infusion  may rate 
only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more infor mation 
and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropriate.  
Unlikely : A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal 
relationship to CAR- 20/19- T cell  administration makes a causal relationship improbable (e.g., 
the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication) and 
in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provides plausible explanations (e.g., 
the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  64 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  Unrelated : The AE is completely independent o f CAR- 20/19- T cell administration, and/or 
evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by [CONTACT_15370].  
Known AEs List 
Potential risks associated with this treatment include symptoms/complications associated with 
CRS and neurotoxicity. Section 1.7  lists the known symptoms/com plications associated with 
CRS and other known risks of CAR -T cell administr ation.  
Time Period for AE Capture  
AE collection schedule detailed in Table 1: Schedule of Events  
8.4 Monitoring and Recording an Adverse Event  
Definition . Any clinically relevant deterioration in laboratory assessments or other clinical 
finding is considered an AE.  
Reporting source . AEs may be spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_5363]/or in response to an 
open question from study personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination or other 
diagnostic procedures .  
Prior to the trial . Planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_463059] (e.g., surgery was perfor med 
earlier or later than planned) .  
Pretreatment events following signed informed consent.  For serious pretreatment events, 
the investigator must determine both the intensity of the event and the relationship of the event 
to study procedures.  
Treatment events.  For serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
Not serious AEs . For non- serious AEs, the investigator must determine both the intensity of the 
event and the relationship of the event to study drug administration.  
Follow -up of Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management [ADDRESS_1000706] be followed for the final pregnancy outcome.  As this study utilizes 
an investigational agent under IND with the FDA , this will be reported to the FDA .

8.7 Routine Reporting Procedures for AEs  
Expe dited Reporting Procedures for SAEs , UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961] s and DLTs . 
 
Since this is an investigator -initiated study, the principal investigator, also referred to as the 
sponsor -investigator, is responsible for reporting serious adverse events (SAEs) to any 
regulatory agency and to the sponsor - investigator’s IRB. Regardless of expectedness or 
causality, all SAEs (including serious pretreatment events) must also be reported to the DSMC as soon as possible, but no later than five calendar days of the sponsor -investigator’s 
observation or awareness of the event.  
 Signs or sympt oms reported as adverse events will be graded and recorded by [CONTACT_093], 
according to the CTCAE. When possible, signs and symptoms indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event .  
 The i nvestigator will assess al l adverse events and determine reporting requirements to the 
MCWCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and MCW’s Institutional Review Board, and, when the study is conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), if it meets the FDA reporting criteria. The investigator will report SAEs to any regulatory agency and to the sponsor - investigator’s IRB. 
 
All adverse events, whether or not unexpected, and whether or not considered to be associated with the use of the study drug, will be entered into OnCore®.  
 Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
Regardless of expectedness or causality, all SAEs (including serious pretreatment events) must also be reported to the DSMC as soon as possible, but no later than five calendar days of the 
sponsor -investigator’s observation or awareness of the event .  
 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  66 Version No.: 5 
  Version Date: 6/18/2019  Report Method:  The investigator will use email to report SAEs to the DSMC. The SAE report 
must include event term(s), serious criteria, and the sponsor- investigator’s or sub- investigator’s 
determination of both the intensity of the event(s) and the relationship of the event(s) to study drug administration. Intensity for each SAE, including any lab abnormalities, will be determined 
by [CONTACT_10540] N CI CTCAE as a guideline  whenever possible.  
The criteria are available online at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html
. 
Reporting to MCW Committee Institutional Review Board  
The principal i nvest igator must report unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or 
others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_20865])  to the MCW IRB within five business days of his/her awareness of the event.   
[Guidance on Adverse Event Reporting to the IRB  is available online at MCW IRB Policies and 
Procedures. ] (http://www.mcw.edu/hrpp/policiesprocedures.htm) 
Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration  
As this  study is being conducted under an IND, the spons or-investigator is responsible for 
determining whether the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21  CFR §312.32).  
The i nvestigator will report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected. In addition, per FDA recommendations, the sponsor -investigator  will 
report all CRS  ≥Grade 3 and Neurotoxicity  ≥Grade 3 that occurs as a result of CAR -20/19 -T cell 
infusion. For other events, the sponsor -investigator  needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions:  suspected adverse reaction, unexpected, and serious  
 If the adverse event does not meet one of the above definitions, it should not be submitted as an expedited IND safety report.  The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no 
later than 15 calendar days after the investigator determines that the suspected adverse 
reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)).  
 
Any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than seven calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)).   
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will be submitted to FDA as a Follow -up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).

  Version Date: 06/18/2019  9 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORM ATION  
 
9.1.1  CAR -20/19- T cell s 
 
Product Description  
Each CAR -20/[ADDRESS_1000709] prepared from patient peripheral blood CD4+ 
and CD8+ T cells. The cells have been engineered to express two different extracellular single 
chain antibodies (scFv) recognizing CD20 and CD19. The antibodies are linked to tandem  
signaling domains comprised of the CD3ζ signaling module linked to the 4 -1BB costimulatory 
domain ( Figure 3 ). The CAR- 20/19- T cell s if given  fresh without cryopreservation will be in an 
infusion medium of an isotonic electrolyte solution (Plasma -Lyte® A or Normosol® R) containing 
2.5% HSA. If needed, the CAR -T cells  will be  cryopreserved in infusible grade cryomedium at 
two different cell numbers.  For cryopreserved cells the infusion medium will consist of 10% di -
methylsulfoxide, 4% human serum albumin, in 85% Normosol R.  
Mechanism of Action:  
When the antibody chains on the CAR- 20/19- T cell s bind to their ligands on the surface of B 
cells the T cells are triggered to kill the cells to which they bind.  A given T cell can bind and kill multiple target cells. 
Metabolism:  
The CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000710] for a period of months  to years . 
Contraindications:  
Please see section 7.1 for contraindications to infusion  
Side Effects:    
Side effects are th oroughly detailed in section 1.7. Briefly major toxicities include:  
• B cell ablation- Since CD19 and CD20 are also expressed on healthy B cells, the CAR-
20/19- T cells are expected to eliminate these cells from the circulation as long as the 
cells persist.  The loss of B cells could result in an increased risk of infection.  
• Allergic Reaction - The scFv on the T cell surface may invoke an immune reaction that 
might eliminate the CAR- 20/19- T cells and secondarily cause an autoimmune response, 
though such responses have not been reported in clinical trials to date.  
• Transformation - The genetic modification of the CAR -20/19- T cells could result in 
transformation. To date transformations of CAR-T cells have not been reported  
• Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)  - Patients with a high tumor burden may experience a 
reaction due to lysis of the tumor cells either from the lymphodepleting preparative regimen or from the CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000711] been reported and can be

9.2.[ADDRESS_1000717] Description  
Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody and immunosuppressant; specifically, tocilizumab is an 
interleukin -6 (IL-6) receptor antagonist. IL -[ADDRESS_1000718] line treatment for patients with CRS requiring more than 
supportive measures for medical management ( Appendix F for CRS management 
guidelines).  
 
Mechanism of Action  
Tocilizumab binds IL -6 receptors (sIL -6R and mIL- 6R) and inhibits IL-6- mediated signaling 
through these receptors. IL- 6 has been shown to be involved in T cell activation, induction of 
immunoglobulin secretion, initiation of hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, and stimulation of 
hematopoietic precursor c ell proliferation and differentiation.

11 CORRELATIVE STUDIES/SPECIAL STUDIES  
11.1 T Cel l Diversity Analysis During CAR -T Cell Therapy  
Diversity of the T cell repertoire (as measured by T cell receptor sequencing) has been 
associated with effective T cell immunity. Conversely, low levels of T cell diversity have been 
correlated with aging, infection, and the development of cancer. The relation between the diversity of the T cells used for CAR -T therapy and outcomes are not understood. Neither is the 
effect of generating CAR -T on repertoire diversity understood. Both could be important 
parameters in therapy outcomes.  
 
We will measure the diversity of the circulating T cell repertoire at three time points during the 
study to examine: 1) the effect of generating the CAR -T cells and 2) any possible effect of 
infusion of the CAR -T product on the overall circulating repertoire of subject. The initial sample 
of [ADDRESS_1000730] of 10ml of blood and will be obtained as part of the 28-day disease 
assessment.  
 
• Sample 1: Will be obtained from the apheresis product collected at Day -15 
• Sample 2: From final CAR -T cell product prior to patient infusion 
• Sample 3: Peripheral blood sample (10 ml)  on Day +7  
• Sample 4: Peripheral blood sample (10 ml) on Day +28 (+/ - 3 days)  
 
The samples will be labeled with a unique patient identifier and sent to BloodCenter of Wisconsin (BCW) for T cell repertoire analysis. At BCW the de -identified samples will be subject 
to cell separation into CD4 and CD8 T cells, cDNA tagged with unique barcodes will be prepared and subject to BV gene -specific amplification and single cell RNA sequencing 
(scRNA -Seq). The amplicons will be pooled and subject to NGS sequencing on the Illumina 
platform. The seq uence data will be clustered on the basis of unique CDR3 sequence 
(clonotype), whole transcriptome and the number of unique cDNA -defining barcodes counted to 
quantify the clonotype. Diversity and complexity measures will be derived, the latter involving not just the number of unique species but their frequency distribution. A similar analysis will be 
performed on the basis of the amino acids encoded by [CONTACT_717215]3 sequence (motif analysis). As 
needed the depth of sequencing can be modulated to bring up the resolution level.  
 
The repertoire diversity analyses and scRNA- Seq will describe the initial diversity of the 
repertoire and show whether the CliniMACS Prodigy -derived CAR -T cells have undergone 
major shifts in the T cell population being infused into the patient. Both results will be most informative when compared to other clinical parameters and outcomes. Comparison of the initial circulating repertoire diversity with that of the circulating repertoire after infusion of the CAR -T 
product will show if there have been significant changes in the repertoire and differentiation 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  77 Version 5  
  Version Date: 06/18/2019  states due to the functioning of the CAR- T cells, and comparison of the data with clinical 
outcomes should be informative. The risk associated with these analyses is minimal. The lab at 
BCW  will be working with de -identified samples. The investigators at BCW are experts in this 
area of analysis. The information gained will be useful for the overall interpretation of outcomes.       
 
11.2: Circulating Tryptophan Metabolites and Gene Expression  Patterns and risk  for CNS 
toxicity during CAR -T cell Therapy  
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) is a systemic inflammatory reaction that is observed in a high 
proportion of patients receiving CAR -T-based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  CRS is driven by [CONTACT_732487] e of proinflammatory cytokines that are released after the activation of monocytes, 
macrophages and some lymphocyte populations.  In addition to CRS, and perhaps as a consequence, patients receiving CAR -T therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732426], including 
tremor, seizures and life- threatening cerebral edema.  Although the pathophysiology of these 
neurological effects is not clear, inflammatory cytokines are thought to be involved.  
 Human studies, primarily carried out in patients with major depressive illness, indicate that the 
kynurenine pathway is a critical link between inflammation and damage to the brain.  The 
kynurenine pathway is activated by [CONTACT_15457] (predominantly interferon gamma) released in the brain by [CONTACT_93247] T cells and leads to  the production of kynurenine from 
tryptophan as a result of up- regulation of the enzyme indoleamine 2,3- dioxygenase (IDO) by 
[CONTACT_732488] -resident macrophages.  Kynurenine is further metabolized to neurotoxic 
metabolites 3- hydroxykynurenine (3 -HK) a nd quinolinic acid (QA) and to the neuroprotective 
metabolite, kynurenic acid (KA).  The ratios of serum KA/3 -HK and/or KA/QA have been used 
previously as indices of the role of this inflammatory pathway on brain function.  Low ratios are 
seen in patients with mood disorders, for example, compared to controls. Further, we have 
identified a gene expression profile of 53 -genes termed the “conserved transcriptional response 
to adversity” (CTRA), a gene expression pattern associated with exposure to chronic str essors 
and whose largest gene subset is comprised of proinflammatory genes. This CTRA gene expression has been associated with worse outcomes following HCT.  
 We hypothesize that neuroinflammation is responsible for the adverse effect of CAR -T cell 
therapy on the brain and that the serum KA/3- HK and KA/QA ratios as well as CTRA profiles will 
serve as biomarkers for neuroinflammation, and thus, as biomarkers for the risk of CNS toxicity.  
 
We will measure the serum concentrations of tryptophan, kynurenine, 3 -HK, QA, KA, and gene 
expression patterns (CTRA) at 4 time points during the study to examine: (1) the trajectory in the concentration of each metabolite and gene expression in the month following CAR -T cell 
therapy; and (2) the correlation between the KA/3 -HK and KA/QA ratios as well as gene 
expression and the occurrence of CNS toxicity. A baseline sample will be assessed on the day 
of apheresis and will serve as a benchmark for the trajectory study.  Two additional blood 
samples will be analyzed during the first month after treatment (14 and 28 days) and one sample will be analyzed after three months (day 90) to assess recovery.  The samples will be 
collected along with other blood samples at these time points in the study.  
 
The samples will be collected via standard venipuncture in serum separating tubes 
(metabolites) and PaxGene RNA tubes (gene expression) and will be collected using standard protocols and stored at -[ADDRESS_1000731] in the Neuroscience Research Center. The serum metabolite tubes will be processed for the concentrations of 5 
analytes: tryptophan, kynurenine, 3 -HK, QA and KA using high performance liquid 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  78 Version 5  
  Version Date: 06/18/[ADDRESS_1000732] laboratory and the mass spectroscopy will be 
performed in the Department of Pharmacology at the Medical College of Wisconsin.  The 
PaxG ene RNA tubes will be stored until they can be shipped in batch to the UCLA Social 
Genomics Core (Directed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Steve Cole, Professor, Hematology/Oncology, UCLA), who will conduct all gene expression profiling on obtained blood samples by [CONTACT_381299]-[ADDRESS_1000733] suitable mass (by [CONTACT_90332]) and 
integrity (by [CONTACT_381300]) for analysis, and subjected to microarray 
target synthesis and hybridization in collaboration with the UCLA Neuroscience Genomics Core 
Laboratory using standard Illumina assay equipment and protocols. The output of these analyses is quantification of whole genome RNA production. The laboratory staff will work with 
de-identified samples and the data will be provided to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_732427].  
 
The information gathered from this study will provide important mechanistic information 
regarding the relationships among the tryptophan -kynurenine pathway, proinflammatory gene 
expression, and the occurrence of CNS toxicity, and could elucidate these metabolites and gene expression clusters as potential biomarkers for the occurrence of CNS toxicity in patients 
undergoing CAR- T therapy.  
 
11.3: Patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures following CAR -T cell therapy  
Related to or as a consequence of CNS and its neurotoxicities, including neuroinflammation, patients receiving CAR -T therapi[INVESTIGATOR_732428] -
reported outcomes (PROs), including the development of depression, anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and pain. There are several mechanistic modalities by [CONTACT_732489] C AR-T cells may influence and/or be affected by [CONTACT_732490].  
 
First, immune activation, inflammation, and cytokine activation - as occurs with CRS - are 
known to affect cognitive and/or emotional functioning, [63] including among cancer patients.  
[64] Second, while patient -reported symptomatology may be less salient during the initial acute 
period of potentially serious  illness, as can occur with CRS [1, 53, 54], the acute and likely 
subsequent inflammation may play a key role in the development of depression and other psychopathologic symptoms; it is unknown what longer -term QOL sequelae may be present 
after an initial severe (and potentiall y ongoing) inflammatory insult. Prior research indicates that 
inflammation itself is involve d in both the genesis
 and foreshadowing of future depressive or 
psychotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. [65] 
 Third, altered central nervous system (CNS) functioning and subsequent emotional/cognitive 
responses influence immunity and T cell function among cancer patients. [66]Further, these 
adverse responses are predictive of compromised immune reconstitution[ 67] and adverse 
outcomes following HCT. [68-70]Therefore, it is critical to assess whether or how CNS and 
psychological functioning will impact the efficacy of this new and likely increasingly used cancer treatment modality. As infection remains a significant risk of this therapy, it will be important to 
understand and optimize any factors that could contribute to increased infectious susceptibility, including neuroimmunologic influence.  
 
Finally, it is unknown what longer -term (1 -2 years and beyond) effects such enhanced immune 
activation will have. Given the aforementioned immune/CNS effects and increasing emphasis 
 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  79 Version 5  
  Version Date: 06/18/2019  on QOL and PROs as mainstay parameters in assessing cancer treatment efficacy, [71, 72] it is 
important to ascertain late effect PROs.    
 
We will measure the following PROs  (see Appendix I for questionnaires)  during the ancillary 
study at the same time points as the biomarkers described in section 11.2 (at apheresis , D+14, 
D+28, D+90), as well as at the additional time points of 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years: 
 
Depression:  Depression will be assessed through the General Depression subscale of 
the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) and includes 20 questions 
with a scoring range of 20 -100 (mean in community dwelling adult of 44.[ADDRESS_1000734] 
deviation of 14.75). [73] 
 
Anxiety:  Anxiety will be assessed using two subscale items of the IDAS including panic 
(health population mean = 12.58, SD = 5.26) and traumatic intrusions (healthy population mean = 7.60, SD = 4.20) [
73] 
 
Fatigue:  The Fatigue Severity Index (FSI) will be utilized to assess fatigue; a score of [ADDRESS_1000735] week (average of items 1-3 ; FSI 
Composite) indicates clinically meaningful fatigue. [74] The FSI can also be evaluated 
using the average rating of the degree to which fatigue interfered with some general 
activities (0 -10; FSI Interference); participants’ ratings of the number of days in the past 
week they felt fatigued (0 -7; FSI Days); and participants’ rating of what percent of each 
day in the past week, on average, t hey felt fatigued (0 -100; FSI Percent). [75] Individuals 
scoring at or above the cutoff also report significantly greater scores on these other subscales.  
 
Sleep:  Sleep will be assessed using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI), with a 
score of >5 considered disturbed sleep as adjusted for cancer populations. [76, 77] 
 
Pain:  The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) assesses pain intensity as well as pain- related 
interference in function. [78] BPI [INVESTIGATOR_381276] 0 -40 (first four items), 
and the BPI [INVESTIGATOR_381277] a mean of the last 7 items (5a- 5g) with a range of 
0-10. 
 The i nformation gathered from this study will provide important data regarding the impact of 
CAR- T therapy on patient QOL outcomes.  
Guidelines for reporting of Depression and/or Suicidal Ideation:  
Should the patient endorse any thoughts of suicidality or self harm per the IDAS, the study co-investigator for this portion of the ancillary testing ([CONTACT_381308]) will contact [CONTACT_732491]. Should completion of the study surveys 
prompt participants to want treatment  for any of the other symptoms, participants will be offered 
a referral for appropriate care through the Quality of Life Center at the Froedtert Cancer Center.

  Version Date: 06/18/2019  12 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
12.1 Study Endpoints  
There are two primary endpoints in this study —feasibility and safety.  
 
Feasibility of CAR- 20/19- T cell production by [CONTACT_732492] (Miltenyi 
Biotec) will be measured. At minimum, we expect to reach our target CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000736]  75% of patients with an adequate T cell starting dose. Feasibility will be measured at the 
end of the study after completion of accrual. If > 25% of patients with an adequate T cell starting 
dose were unable to achieve goal CAR- 20/19 -T cell dose,  we would deem that this technique is 
not a feasible method for production. 
Safety of administration of CAR- 20/19- T cells in patients will be assessed as outlined in Section 
6 Treatment plan.  
12.2 Accrual Estimates  
 
This is a Phase 1/1b  study evaluating the safety and efficacy CAR- 20/19- T cell s as p art of a 
first-in-human study. We will utilize a 3+3 escalation design to identify the target dose level 
followed by a dose expansion at the selected dose level.  The min imum number of patients 
enrolled will be 4 patients (2 at dose level 0 and 2 at dose level -1). The maximum number of 
patients enrolled would be 24, which is dependent on the number of DLTs experienced on trial.   
 
Should this treatment be safe and feasible, we would use the identified dose to open a larger 
phase II study to demonstrate the efficacy of our treatments.  
 
12.3 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732429] 1 /1b Study.   
 
Toxicity will be consider ed unacceptable and lead to clinical hold of the study if any of the 
following occur in the first 5 patients: one treatment related mortality (TRM) or three grade 4 non-hematological  toxicity events as assessed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_423958]. This ensures that there is onl y a 
5% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732430] <1%. For Grade 4 non- hematological events not 
resulting in death, this rule ensures a 5% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732431] <20% and an 68% probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_732432] 60% or  more. Additionally, if there are ≥ [ADDRESS_1000737] 8 patients with an adequate starting T -cell dose ≥3 
patients fail to meet the  targeted CAR- 20/[ADDRESS_1000738] 3 patients with NHL or CLL/SLL  will be 
treated consecutively at Dose Level [ADDRESS_1000739] two patients treated 

 
 
IIT-CAR -T-Shah  81 Version 5  
  Version Date: 06/18/2019  will be treated no sooner than 28 days  apart to allow monitoring of  acute and sub- acute toxicities. 
After that patients will be infused no sooner than at 14 day intervals among the specified dose 
level or in -between two dose levels.  
 
Dose escalation will proceed within each cohort per the following scheme: A cohort of three 
patients with NHL or CLL /SLL will receive 2.5 x 105 cells/kg (Dose Level 0) . If there are no DLTs  
in the first three patients , the dose will be escalated to 7.5 x 105 cells/kg (Dose Level 1) . If 1/[ADDRESS_1000740] a DLT at Dose Level 0, an additional three patients will be enrolled at this dose 
level.  If there is ≤1/6 patients with a DLT, the dose will increase to Dose Level 1. A similar dose 
escalation schema will be used to escalate from Dose Level 1 to Dose Level 2 (2.5 x 106 
cells/kg) which is our goal dose. Dose escalations will NOT occur until all patients at the current 
level are monitored for 28 days after CAR -20/[ADDRESS_1000741] three or six patients  with NHL or CLL /SLL develop DLT a t Dose Level 0, the 
dose will de- escalate to 1.0  x 10
5 cells/kg and accrual will proceed per the same schema as 
above.  If two of the first three or six patients  with NHL or CLL have a DLT at the lower dose, the 
study will be stopped for failure to achieve the desired safety endpoint. The minimum  number of  
patients enrolled will be 4 patients (2 at dose level 0 and 2 at dose level -1) if the first four 
patients all experience a DLT. The maximum number of patients enrolled in our D ose Escalation  
phase would be 18.  
Once a safe dose has been identified, the Dose Expansion phase of the study will be open to 
accrual  once approval is obtained from local and federal regulatory bodies. In this Phase, t here 
will be a 6 -12 patient expansion cohort in NHL and CLL/SLL. DLT monitoring will continue in the 
Dose Expansion phase. If ≥[ADDRESS_1000742] the safety of single day CAR -T infusion.  
Expansion Single Infusion  
9 patients will be enrolled at the goal dose of 2.5 x 106 cells/kg. The first two patients at this 
dose level will be observed for 14 days prior to additional enrollment. Among this cohort if there 
are ≥[ADDRESS_1000743] 28 days of treatment/observation. If multiple toxicities are seen, the presence of dose limiting toxicity will be 
based on the most severe toxicity experienced. If a patient dies from a cause felt to be unrelated  
to CAR- T cells (e.g. , progressive disease) before completion of the 28 day DLT monitoring 
period, that patient will be replaced. Patients who experience toxicity from lymphodepletion 
chemotherapy that prevents administration of CAR- 20/19- T cells will also  be replaced.  All 
patients who fail to produce the desired dose level will be followed for DLTs, AEs, and survival but will be replaced for this dose- finding and dose -expansion study.   
The definition of DLT for this study is de tailed in Section 3.4

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT SUMMARY
Amendment: 4
Date: 01 February 2019
RATIONALE AND SUMMARY OF MAJOR CHANGESThis protocol is being revised to make the following changes:
1. The following exploratory objectives have been moved to secondary 
xEvaluation of change from baseline in bod y proportion ratios of the extremities [§8.0, 
Synopsis, and additional a ppropriate sections]. 
xEvaluation of the effect of BMN 111 on bone morphology/quality by X-ray and dual 
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [§8.0 and additional appropria te sections]. 
xEvaluate potential changes in health-rela ted quality of life (H RQoL) and functional 
independence as measured by [CONTACT_342087] [§8.0 and additional 
appropriate sections]. 
Rationale: Due to the importance of clinical, morbidity, and HRQoL outcomes in 
achondroplasia, all clinical outcome e ndpoints (with the exception of optional 
assessments) have been moved from exploratory to secondary. 
2. Description of contraception in the st udy inclusion criteria (§9.3.1 and additional 
appropriate sections) and birth control during and after the study (§9.3.3) have 
been updated. 
Rationale: To provide clarity on requirements for the use of highly effective methods 
used in female participants and acceptable methods in male participants, and to define true abstinence to clarify when it is  considered an acceptable method of 
contraception. This is in line with  the Clinical Tr ial Facilitation Group 
“Recommendations related to contraception a nd pregnancy testing in clinical trials.”
3. Duration of Subject Participation updated (§9.3.6 and add itional appropriate 
sections) to 4-week safety follow-up after Week 52.  
Rationale: Follow-up after the study has been extended to ensure adequate passage of 
time before the final safety follow-up so that potentially drug-related AEs should 
have already occurred- protocol.pdf Page 3
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 3
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
4. Primary and secondary efficacy variab les separated so that new secondary 
variables are incorporated (§9.12.2 a nd additional appropr iate sections).
Rationale: This change ma de to support Rationale 1. 
5. Move selected exploratory objectives to  be new secondary objectives (Synopsis, 
§9.12.3, and additional appr opriate sections). 
Rationale: This change ma de to support Rationale 1. 
6. Exploratory efficacy variables dele ted from §9.12.4 and moved to secondary 
efficacy variables (§9.12.3). 
Rationale: This change ma de to support Rationale 1.
7. Change medical monitor from   MD, PhD to , MD. 
8. Replace “18 years of age” with “age  of majority” (§5.3, §12 and additional 
appropriate sections).
Rationale: The age of majority varies by [CONTACT_1606].
9. Inserted “In Japan, subject enrollment will be staggered initially, with a 
minimum of a 2-week window between the first 4 subjects enrolled” in Study 
Design and Plan in Synopsis and §9.1. 
Rationale: This measure was taken in Japan and implemented in a country-specific 
protocol given the limited exposure experien ce of Japanese subjects to BMN 111 at 
the time of the 111-301 study. The sponsor has now consolidated into one global 
protocol. 
10. Removed “plasma DNA” in §[IP_ADDRESS]. 
Rationale: DNA is not obtained from plasma

TITLE OF STUDY: 
A Phase 3 Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Cont rolled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of BMN 111 in Children with Achondroplasia 
PROTOCOL NUMBER:
111-301
STUDY SITES:Approximately 33 clinical centers worldwide
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:
Phase 3
STUDY RATIONALE:Achondroplasia (ACH), the most common form of disp roportionate short stature or dwarfism, is an 
autosomal dominant genetic skeletal disorder caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 gene (FGFR3), a negative regulator of endochondral bone 
formation. Due to this FGFR3 mutation, there is exaggerated negative regulation on endochondral ossification, which results in ACH ( Laederich, 2010 ).
The use of modified recombinant C-type natriureti c peptide (rhCNP) as a potential therapy for the 
treatment of ACH is based on the mechanism of ac tion of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). CNP 
and its receptor, NPR-B, are key regulators of skeletal growth. CNP binding to its receptor, 
natriuretic peptide receptor-B (NPR-B), acts as a key regulator of longitudinal bone growth by 
[CONTACT_100276]-regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. CNP-mediated activation 
of NPR-B results in the rescue of the dwarfism  phenotype of mice with a FGFR3 gain-of-function 
mutation ( Yasoda, 2004; Yasoda 2009 ). The pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was explored 
in two mouse models of ACH, a severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model ( Lorget, 2012, ), and a mild [Ach] /+ 
model. Partial or complete reversion of the ACH phenotype was observed in these mouse models 
after BMN 111 administration. Additionally, in wild-type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 administration resulted in growth plate e xpansion and dose-dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically-tolerated dose levels ( Wendt, 2015, ). Therefore, administration of CNP has been 
proposed as a therapeutic approach for ACH.- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423674]:

BioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111)  that has a longer half-life than endogenous 
CNP, thereby [CONTACT_342088] (SC) administration. Similar to CNP, BMN 111 
activates NPR-B signaling with subsequent inhibi tion of FGFR3 downstream signaling, leading to 
the promotion of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and subsequent increased 
endochondral bone formation. BMN 111 administrati on has been shown to promote endochondral 
bone formation at hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in both normal animals and mouse 
models of ACH reported (refer to current Investigators Brochure for additional information).
Human studies to date have demonstrated that BM N 111 is safe and well-tolerated at doses that 
result in improvements in growth velocity approaching that of children of average stature.
Study 111-101 was a Phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and 
tolerability of BMN 111 in healthy adult male volunteers without ACH. Part 1 examined a series of 
single subcutaneous doses (5 μg/kg, 10 μg/kg and 15 μg/kg), and Part 2 included 10 days of either 
fixed dosing or dose escalation (0.5 μg/kg to 8 μg/kg). BMN 111 was generally well tolerated at all 
doses. As expected, mild, transient, self-limited hypotension was reported (refer to current 
Investigators Brochure for additional information). BMN 111 demonstrated dose-related linear 
increases in exposure by [CONTACT_342089] (C max) (from 2.5 μg/kg to 
15μg/kg) in healthy volunteers; plasma elimination half-life (t 1/2) ranged from 30.7 to 140 minutes.
Study 111-202 was a Phase 2, open-label, sequential cohort, dose escalation study that assesses 
daily SC BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH, starting with a dose of 2.5 μg/kg and escalating 
through additional dose cohorts up to 30 μg/kg. The primary objective of Study 111-202 was to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 administered for 6 months and up to 24 months; 
the secondary objectives were to determine chan ge from baseline in annualized growth velocity 
(AGV), growth parameters, body proportions, and evaluate the dose-exposure and pharmacokinetic 
(PK) profiles of BMN 111 in children with ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6-month initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that treatment 
with BMN 111 for 6 months at the doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg was generally well tolerated 
at all dose levels (refer to current Investigators Brochure for specific details).
Analysis of efficacy data from the 6-month initial phase of Study 111-202 demonstrated a positive 
dose-dependent response in mean change from baseline AGV at doses ranging from 2.5-15 μg/kg 
daily. Subjects treated with 30 μg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in AGV after 6 
months compared with subjects treated with 15 μg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30- μg/kg daily 
dose was also similar to the 15- μg/kg daily dose. Given that no clinically significant difference 
could be identified between the 15- μg/kg and 30- μg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6-month safety 
and efficacy data, the lower of the two doses has been chosen for this Phase [ADDRESS_423675]:

xEvaluate biomarkers of BMN 111 activity.
xEvaluate genomic biomarkers.
STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: 
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_423679] of BMN 111 on growth velocity in children with ACH. Subjects who are 5 to < [ADDRESS_423680] 110 eligible subjects will be stratified based on sex and Tanner stage (Stage 1, 
and > Stage 1, with no more than 20% of subjects > Tanner Stage 1) at Screening, and randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: placebo or BMN 111 at 15 μg/kg/day. To 
achieve gender balance, approximately 50% of each gender will be enrolled, with neither to exceed 55%. In Japan, subject enrollment will be staggered initially, with a minimum of a 2-week window 
between the first [ADDRESS_423681] 3 days of dosing (and 30 minutes for all 
other days of dose administration) in conjunction with caregiver training for BMN 111 or placebo 
administration and adverse event (AE) documentation/reporting. It is generally expected that after subjects are tolerating BMN [ADDRESS_423682] been met (refer to
Study Reference Manual), caregivers will begin administering BMN [ADDRESS_423683] by a study staff member to the caregiver will be required every 4 weeks 
(± 10 days) to all study subjects after the Week [ADDRESS_423684] udy staff will ask about dose administration and 
seek information on AEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_179546]. Information on all AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) should be recorded in the subject’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423685]:

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION: 
Primary Efficacy: 
Primary efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_342095] (annualized to 
cm/yr).
Safety:
Safety will be evaluated by [CONTACT_342096], SAEs, laboratory test results (urinalysis, chemistry, 
hematology), changes in vital signs, physical examination, ECG, X-ray/DXA assessments of bone 
morphology and quality, clinical hip assessment , anti-BMN 111 immunogenicity assessments; 
salivary cortisol, serum prolactin, and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) levels (FSH/LH will be monitored for all subjects >8 years of age, and for subjects at Tanner 
stage 2, whichever is earlier); and cognitive assessment with the Childhood Behavioral Checklist 
(CBCL). Additional assessments will be conducted to evaluate changes from baseline in bone 
metabolism.
Pharmacokinetics:
PK sampling will be carried out over the 12-month study period in subjects randomized to 
BMN 111 or placebo. If supported by [CONTACT_26739], the PK variables to be calculated for subjects 
randomized to BMN 111 will include: 
xArea under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-).
xArea under the plasma concentration-time curve from time [ADDRESS_423700] measurable 
concentration (AUC 0-t).
xMaximum observed plasma concentration (C max).
xTime to reach C max(Tmax).
xElimination half-life (t 1/2).
xApparent clearance (CL/F).
xApparent volume of distribution (V z/F).
All PK variables will be estimated by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental analysis.
Secondary:
Secondary assessments will include change from baseline in growth parameters (height), body 
proportions of the upper and lower segments, and proportions of the extremities by [CONTACT_308454]. 
Growth parameters will be assessed by [CONTACT_201098] Z-scores. Body proportions will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_342097]. Anthropometric measurements may include 
but are not limited to standing height; sitting height; weight; head circumference; upper and lower 
arm length; leg length; and arm span. Measurement ratios may include, but are not limited to, 
upper:lower body segment ratio, upper arm:forearm length ratio, upper leg:lower leg length ratio, 
and arm span:standing height ratio. Further details are provided in the Study 111-301
Anthropometric Measurement Guidelines.
Health-related quality of life and functional independence will be assessed using the QoLISSY, 
PedsQL, and WeeFIM (reference Training Materials for specifics).
Exploratory:
Polysomnography will be conducted to evaluate sleep apnea in a subset of subjects. Additional - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423701]:

biomarkers and optional genomic biomarkers will be evaluated.
STATISTICAL METHODS: 
Sample Size Determination:
With 55 subjects planned in each of the two randomized groups (one BMN 111 group and one 
placebo group), the power to detect a difference of 1.75 cm/year between the BMN 111 group and 
the placebo group in change from baseline in AGV at 12 months is approximately 90%, assuming 
that the pooled standard deviation of the change from baseline in AGV is 2.80, using a two-sided two-sample t-test at a 0.05 significance level. The power calculation is based on data from Study 
111-202 (a phase 2, open-label, sequential cohort dose-escalation study) and Study 111-901 (a 
natural history study for pediatric subjects with achondroplasia). 
Efficacy Analysis: 
Efficacy analysis will be carried out for the 52-week (12-month) period. Efficacy analysis will be 
based on all randomized subjects who receive at least one dose of double-blinded BMN [ADDRESS_423702]-treatment visit will 
be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and 
maximum) per group. The primary estimand is the difference in mean change from baseline in

pattern-mixture models ( Little 1993 ;Molenberghs 2007, ) implemented in Proc MI of SAS where
the missing, unobserved observations of the standing height are assumed to follow missing not atrandom (MNAR) mechanism. For each imputation, the standing heights collected from thesubjects in the same randomization group who also discontinue treatment prematurely(but remain in the study), referred to as off-treatment data, will be used as the reference data forMI. Ten (10) sets of imputations of the missing standing heights will be constructed from MI andthe AGV at the 12-month time point will be calcul ated based on these [ADDRESS_423704] whose value is imputed, the 10 imputed values  will be provided in a data listing that will be
included in the appendix of the CSR. 
The primary null hypothesis of no difference be tween the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
in the mean change from baseline in AGV at the 12-month time point will be tested based on an 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, with fixed-effect terms including treatment group, sex, and Tanner stage, and age and the baseline AGV as covariates. The above-mentioned ANCOVA model will be applied to the 10 imputed data sets from MI. The analysis results based on the 10 imputed datasets will be summarized using Proc MIANALIZE in SAS.The key secondary efficacy endpoints are the change from baseline in height Z-score, and the change from baseline in upper:lower body segment ratio. The estimand of the key secondaryefficacy endpoints is the difference in mean change from baseline in the corresponding endpoint atthe 12-month time point between the BMN 111 group and the placebo group (all randomized 
subjects who received at least one dose of double-blinded BMN 111 or placebo). The measurement of standing height at each scheduled visit will be converted to age-and sex-appropriate standard 
score, also referred to as Z-score, by [CONTACT_342098] (not ACH). The 
height Z-score and its change from baseline will  be summarized using descriptive statistics. Any
missing observations will be imputed based on MI wi th pattern-mixture models described above.

The overall type I family-wise error rate for testing the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints 
will be controlled at the 0.05 significance level using the following 3-step serial gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_342077] (MCP). Following this MCP, advancement to the next step will only occur if the null hypotheses within a step and the previous step(s) are all rejected at the 
significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_423706] comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for the 
primary efficacy endpoint, the change from ba seline in AGV at 12-month time point. If the 
null hypothesis is not rejected (ie, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in favor of 
BMN 111, all subsequent statistical tests will not be considered statistically significant. The study is considered positive if the primary test is significant in favor of BMN 111. 
2. The second step will be the test comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for 
the secondary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in height Z-score at 12-month 
time point. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (ie, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in 
favor of BMN 111, the subsequent statistical test will not be considered statistically 
significant. 
3. The third step will be the test comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for the 
secondary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in upper:lower body segment ratio 
at 12-month time point at a significance level of 0.05. 
Additional secondary efficacy analyses will also include change from baseline in body proportions 
of extremities, and HRQoL and functional independence assessments. 
Change in body proportions of extremities will be assessed by [CONTACT_308454]. To assess the robustness of the primary analysis re sult, sensitivity analyses such as the following 
will be performed:- protocol.pdf Page 17

Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM)
The primary null hypothesis of no difference between the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
in the mean change from baseline in AGV at the 12-month time point will be tested based on all 
available AGV assessments from all scheduled visits using a mixed model with repeated measures 
(MMRM), with fixed-effect terms including treatment group, visit, sex, Tanner stage, and 
interaction of treatment group and visit, and age and the baseline AGV as covariates, repeated over 
visits. 
MI Based on Missing At Random (MAR) Assumption
The sensitivity analyses will be based on the MI technique as proposed by [CONTACT_342099] (1987)
implemented in PROC MI of SAS where the missing, unobserved observations of the response variable are assumed to follow MAR mechanism. The MI procedure will be directly applied to 
standing height and AGV w ill be calculated based on imputed height. The ANCOVA model 
described in the primary analysis will be performed separately for each imputation dataset and a 
summary overall imputed samples will be provided for each analysis.
Random Coefficients Model
The mean change from baseline in height at 12-month time point will be estimated for both the 
treatment group and the placebo group based on a MMRM, with fixed-effect terms including 
treatment group, visit, sex, Tanner stage, and age and the baseline height as covariates, and 
random-effect terms of the intercept and the subject ×visit interaction. For each randomized group, 
an AGV at 12-month time point will be defined as the mean change from baseline in height at 
12-month from the MMRM model above.  
ANCOVA on Completers
In this sensitivity analysis, the estimand will be the difference of the means of the change from 
baseline in AGV at 12-month observed from subjects who have non-missing observation at 
12-month between the two randomized groups. The LS means of the change from baseline in AGV 
at 12-month will be estimated for both the randomized groups based on the ANCOVA model 
described in the primary analysis. In this analysis, only subjects with observed AGV change from 
baseline at 12-month will be included. No extrapolation or imputation will be performed for 
missing 12-month or Day [ADDRESS_423707] listings will also be provided for efficacy endpoints. Detailed statistical methods will be 
provided in the SAP.

7 INTRODUCTION
BMN 111 is a proposed pharmacologic therapeutic option for achondroplasia (ACH), the 
most common form of dwarfism. 
ACH is a rare disease with a prevalence of 1/[ZIP_CODE] in the US ( Wynn, 2007 ). The average 
adult heights for men and women with ACH are 131 cm and 124 cm, respectively ( Genetics
Home Reference, 2012 ). Characteristic features include long and narrow trunk, a large head
with frontal bossing, hypoplasia of the mid-face,  bowed legs and stenosis of the foramen and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_308363]-threatening. Foramen magnum stenosis can lead to 
cervicomedullary compression in infants with  complications including hydrocephalus, 
hypotonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_5448], apnea, cyanotic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], feeding problems, 
quadriparesis, and sudden death.  
There is no approved pharmacological therapy for achondroplasia in the [LOCATION_002] of
America ([LOCATION_003]) or European Union (EU). Current treatments for achondroplasia are focusedon neurosurgical interventions for foramen  magnum stenosis or lumbar stenosis, 
thoracolumbar braces to help ameliorate the kyphosis, or limb lengthening requiring multipleoperations over 2 to 3 years ( Shirley, 2009 );Horton 2007).
ACH is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) R3, a 
negative regulator of chondrocyte prolifer ation and differentiation. The most common 
mutation (98%) in ACH patients is a G380R substitution in the transmembrane domain of 
FGFR3. The majority of new cases (80%) orig inate from parents of average stature.   
The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
pathway mediates part of FGFR3 inhibition of  chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation 
(Foldynova-Trantirkova, 2012, ). The ERK MAPK pathway is modulated by [CONTACT_308465], a positive 
regulator of chondrocyte prolifer ation and differentiation. Binding  of CNP to the Natriuretic 
Peptide-Receptor B (NPR-B) antagonizes FGFR3 downstream signaling by [CONTACT_15936] (ERK1/2) pathway at the level of RAF-1 ( Krejci, 2005, ); (Yasoda, 2004,); (Yasoda, 
2009,);(Pejchalova, 2007) . This crosstalk was demonstrated in a mouse model of FGFR3-
related chondrodysplasia ( Yasoda, 2004, );(Yasoda, 2009,) . The dwarfism phenotype of mice 
harboring the FGFR3G380R mu tation was rescued by [CONTACT_342102] C-type natriuretic 
peptide (CNP) in cartilage or by [CONTACT_342103] (infusion). 
CNP is a member of the natriuretic peptide (NP) family that includes Atrial Natriuretic 
Peptide (ANP) and B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP). These peptides are structurally related but are distinct paracrine/autocrine (CNP) or endocrine (ANP and BNP) factors that regulate the cardiovascular (CV), skeletal, nervous, reproductive and other systems.

of ANP (anaritide and carperitide) and BNP (nesiritide) have been investigated as potential 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_308365]-related diseases.
BMN 111 is a 39-amino acid CNP analogue ha rboring the 37 amino acids of the human 
CNP53 C-terminal sequence and modified by [CONTACT_308530] (Pro-Gly) on 
the N-terminus. It is a recombinant human pep tide fused to human transcription factor (TAF) 
and expressed as an inclusion body in E. coli . BMN 111 is liberated and solubilized from the 
TAF-fusion protein by [CONTACT_308531], and purified by [CONTACT_342104] ( Long, 
2012,). BMN 111 was designed to 1) mimic CNP activities in terms of re ceptor binding and 
pharmacological activity and 2) be resistant to neutral endopeptidase (NEP) digestion in 
order to have an extended half-life in comp arison to CNP that is presumed to increase 
exposure to the target growth plate ( Wendt, 2015,).  
A comprehensive review of BMN 111 is contained in the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447]. Investigators are required to review the Investigator’s 
Brochure prior to initiating this study.
7.1 Nonclinical StudiesThe pharmacological activity of BMN 111 was ex plored in two mouse models of ACH, a 
severe, Fgfr3Y367C/+ model (Lorget, 2012,) , and a mild [Ach] /+ model. Partial or complete 
reversion of the ACH phenotype was obs erved in these mouse models after 
BMN 111
administration. Additionally, in wild-type mice, and normal rats and monkeys, BMN 111 
administration resulted in growth plate expans ion and dose-dependent skeletal growth at 
hemodynamically tolerated dose levels (Wendt, 2015,) .
BMN 111-related adverse findings in nonclinical species (mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys) 
were limited to the known mechanism of action of  CNP on the growth plate and vasculature. 
Reversible subcutaneous injection site reactions were reported, incl uding injection site 
discoloration and microscopic findi ngs of perivascular mononuclear  cell infiltrates that were 
seen with slightly higher incidence and se verity in BMN 111-treated rats and monkeys 
compared to the vehicle control. Adverse skeletal changes associated with exaggerated 
growth were seen in normal nonclinical species  with open growth plates, and were dose-,
exposure- and time-dependent.

7.2 Previous Clinical Studies7.2.1 Study 111-101Study 111-101, “A Phase 1, Two Part, Double B lind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single and Multiple Doses of BMN 111 
Administered to Healthy Adult Volunteers,” was a first-in-human study conducted in 2 parts 
to allow for assessment of the safety, tolera bility, and PK of BMN 111 administered as a 
single dose and as a multiple dose to healthy adult male volunteers.
Doses ranging from 5.0 μg/kg to 15.0 μ g/kg were administered as a single SC dose; doses 
ranging from 0.5 μg/kg to 8.0 μ g/kg were administered daily in the multiple ascending dose 
segment of the study. As expected, mild, transient, self-limited hypotension occurred. The majority of these cases were asymptoma tic and observed upon assumption of an upright 
posture following recumbence. Hypotension even ts were reported in the BMN [ADDRESS_423727]
dose on Day 1 of the multiple dose study in Pa rt 2.

7.2.2 Study 111-202
Study 111-202 was a Phase 2, open-label, seque ntial cohort, dose escalation study that 
assesses daily SC admin istration of BMN 111 in pediatric subjects with ACH. The primary 
objective of Study 111-202 was to evaluate  the safety and tolerability of BMN 111 
administered for 6 months and up to 24 months; the secondary objectives were to determine 
change from baseline in annualized growth  velocity (AGV), growth parameters, body 
proportions, and evaluate the dose-exposure and PK profiles of BMN 111 in children with 
ACH. 
Analysis of safety data from the 6-mont h initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at dose cohorts of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg 
(Cohorts 1 to 4, respectively) was generally we ll tolerated. The most common AEs were mild 
injection site reactions, pyrexia, asymptom atic hypotension, headache, and nasopharyngitis. 
For a detailed summary of risks, please refer to  the current version of the Investigator’s 
Brochure supplied by [CONTACT_189447].  Analysis of efficacy data from the 6-month in itial phase of Study 111- 202 demonstrated that 
the mean (standard deviation) change from baseline AGV when BMN 111 is administered at 
2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg subcutaneously daily for 6 months is -0.37 (1.592), 1.28 (1.439), 
2.01 (1.999), and 2.08 (2.137) cm/year, respec tively. Thus, a positive dose-dependent 
response was observed in change from baseline AGV at doses ranging from 2.5-15 μg/kg 
daily.  In regards to 12-month data, subjects in Cohor t 3 completed 12 months on a stable daily dose 
of 15 μg/kg and positive change from baseline in  AGV was observed in subjects in Cohort 3. 
Subjects treated with 30 μg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 
6 months and their mean changes from baseline in AGV were similar to subjects treated with 
15 μg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30 μg/kg daily dose was also similar to the 15 μ g/kg daily 
dose. Thus, no clinically significant diff erence could be identified between the 15 μg/kg and 
30 μg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6-month safety and efficacy data.
Single-dose PK data from Day 1 showed BMN 111 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_24584] (median T
max
between 5.00 and 16.0 minutes) and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_342079] (mean t 1/2ranging from 
24.4 to 27.0 minutes).   - protocol.pdf Page 38
CBI
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 38
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
There was no evidence of accumulation with mu ltiple daily dosing, and all pre-dose PK 
samples were below the limit of quantitation, consistent with the short half-life relative to the 
daily dosing regimen. Overall, exposure following multiple dosing was similar to exposure following single doses, and remained consiste nt through 24 months, indicating no apparent 
time-dependence in PK through 24 months of treatment. 
Further details regarding results from the 111- 202 study can be found in the current version 
of the Investigator’s Brochure.
7.3 Ongoing Clinical Studies7.3.1 Study 111-205Study 111-205 is an ongoing open-label, Phase 2 extension study to assess long-term safety, 
tolerability, and efficacy of BMN 111 in childre n with ACH. Subjects continue receiving the 
same stable dose of BMN 111 received upon completion of the 111-202 study (up to 
30 μg/kg daily). This 5-year study allows for l ong-term assessment of the effect of daily 
BMN [ADDRESS_423728] completing 2 years of  BMN 111 treatment in Study 111-202 (7 years 
total BMN 111 treatment duration) . Additional exploratory endpoints are being examined to 
determine long-term effects of BMN 111 on bone physiology and the medical complications 
of ACH.
7.4 Study RationaleBioMarin has engineered a CNP analog (BMN 111) that has a longer half-life than 
endogenous CNP, thereby [CONTACT_342105] (SC) ad ministration. Similar to CNP, 
BMN 111 activates NPR-B signaling with s ubsequent inhibition of FGFR3 downstream 
signaling, leading to the promotion of c hondrocyte proliferation and differentiation and 
subsequent increased endochondral bone fo rmation. BMN 111 administration has been 
shown to promote endochondral bone formation at  hemodynamically tolerated dose levels in 
both normal animals and mouse models of AC H reported (refer to current Investigators 
Brochure for additional information).
Human studies to date have also demonstrated  that BMN 111 is safe and well tolerated at 
doses that result in improvements in growth velo city approaching that of children of average 
stature.
Analysis of safety data from the Study 111 -202 showed that treatment with BMN 111 was 
generally well tolerated at all dose levels (refer to current Investigators Brochure for specific details). - protocol.pdf Page 39
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 39
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
Analysis of efficacy data from Study 111- 202 demonstrated that that subjects given 
BMN 111 at the dose of 15 μg/kg daily had a clinically significant improvement in AGV, 
with approximately ~50% increa se over baseline seen with trea tment for 6 months which was 
sustained after continued tr eatment for 12 months.   
Subjects treated with 30 μg/kg daily also showed similar improvement in mean AGV after 
6 months and their mean changes from baseline in AVG were similar to subjects treated with 
15 μg/kg daily. Safety data for the 30- μg/kg daily dose was also similar to the 15- μg/kg daily 
dose. Given that no clinically significant difference could be identified between the 15 μg/kg 
and 30 μg/kg daily dose in the Phase 2, 6-month safety and efficacy data, the lower of the 
two doses has been chosen for this Phase 3 study. 
Study 111-301 is designed to further characte rize and confirm efficacy and safety of 
BMN 111 at a dose of 15 μg/kg for 52 weeks in a placebo-controlled study. This 60-week 
study (up to 4 weeks of screening, 52 weeks of treatment with an additi onal 4 weeks of safety 
follow up) will allow for assessment of the effect of daily BMN 111 administration on 
growth velocity, growth (height), and body pr oportions (lower:upper segments) in subjects 
treated with BMN 111 compared with the plac ebo group, as well as further characterize 
safety and tolerability of BMN 111 in children with ACH. Additional endpoints will also be 
examined. Secondary endpoints to determine the effects of BMN 111 include evaluation of 
change from baseline in body proportions of the extremities by [CONTACT_308454], bone 
physiology (including changes in bone morphology, quality, and growth via X-rays and dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the extre mities and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). Othe r secondary endpoints 
assessing quality of life and da ily function of study subjects include health-related quality of
life (HRQoL) and functional independence assessments.  These endpoints include 
administration of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), Quality of Life in Short 
Stature Youth (QoLISSY), and Functional I ndependence Measure (WeeFIM) assessments. 
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) will also be administered. Additional exploratory endpoints include polysomnography to evaluate  sleep apnea, BMN [ADDRESS_423729] completed the treatment period of the study.

7.5.2 Summary of Risks from Clinical Studies
[IP_ADDRESS] Study 111-101Based on review of the first-in-human Phase 1 study of BMN 111 in healthy adult volunteers, 
Study 111-101, BMN 111 administered SC daily was well tolerated with doses ranging from 
0.5 μ g/kg to 15 μg/kg. All AEs were of mild severity, and no SAEs were reported. The most 
common AE was mild, transient, self-limited orthostatic hypotension, of which the majority 
of cases were asymptomatic and observed only upon assumption of an upright posture 
following recumbence. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified outside of these CV 
findings.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study 111-202Analysis of safety data from the 6-mont h initial phase of Study 111-202 showed that 
treatment with BMN 111 for 6 months at doses of 2.5, 7.5, 15, and 30 μg/kg was generally 
well tolerated. In addition BMN 111 at 15 μg/kg was well tolerated for over [ADDRESS_423730] been identified as risks associated with BMN 111 injections. Hypersensitivity reactions including developm ent of BMN 111 antibodies are potential risks

The exploratory objectives of the study are to:
xEvaluate sleep study scores by [CONTACT_342108] a subset of subjects.
xEvaluate biomarkers of BMN [ADDRESS_423734] of BMN 111 on growth in children w ith ACH. Subjects who are 5 to < [ADDRESS_423735] 110 eligible subjects will be stratified based on sex and Tanner Stage (Stage 1, and > Stage 1) (w ith no greater than 20% of subjects > Tanner 
Stage 1), and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment  groups: placebo or 
BMN 111 at 15 μg/kg. To achieve gender balance, approximately 50% of each gender will 
be enrolled, with neither to exceed 55%. In Japan, subject enrollment will be staggered 
initially, with a minimum of a 2-week window between the first 4 subjects enrolled.
For placebo and BMN 111, the route of adminis tration is subcutaneous injection and the 
frequency is daily. Approximately 33 clinical centers worldwide will participate in the study.

9.2 Discussion of Study Design, In cluding Choice of Control Group
The intent and design of this Phase 3 study is to assess BMN 111 as a therapeutic option for 
the treatment of children with ACH. The age range of enrollment of children with ACH has been chosen to be 5 to < [ADDRESS_423760] chronological age at which growth plates completely fuse is variable but is thought to occur sometime in late adolescence, hence the upper limit of the age range for subjects to be enrolled in this study is < 18 years old.  
To achieve gender balance, a pproximately 50% of each gender will be enrolled, with neither 
to exceed 55%.
In terms of the study design, a randomized double-blind placebo control will be used to 
mitigate the risk of selection bi as and any potential bias in da ta collection and study conduct. 
Additionally, this design provides a framewor k for interpretation of any endpoints with a 
subjective component, eg, HRQoL and functi onal independence ques tionnaires and any 
subjective assessment of safety.

abstinence for the duration of period at risk, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. 
9.3.4 Removal of Subjects from Treatment or AssessmentSubjects (or their legally authorized representative) may withdraw their consent to participate 
in the study at any time without prejudice. Th e investigator must withdraw from the study 
any subject who requests to be withdrawn. A s ubject’s participation in the study may be 
discontinued at any time at the discretion of the investigator and in accordance with his/her clinical judgment. When possible, the tests and evaluations listed for the termination visit should be carried out. BioMarin must be notif ied of all subject withdrawals as soon as 
possible. 
Investigators may discontinue administratio n of BMN [ADDRESS_423772] from study treatment include, but are not limited to, the following: 
1. Evidence of both (1) growth plate fusion as assessed by [CONTACT_342114] (2) decreased AGV (AGV < 1.5 cm/yr) as 
assessed over a period of at least [ADDRESS_423773] becomes pregnant (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for details on the reporting 
procedures to follow in the event of pregnancy).
If a subject fails to return for scheduled visits , documented effort must be made to determine 
the reason. If the subject’s caregiver cannot be reached by [CONTACT_756], a certified letter should 
be sent to the subject (or the subject’s lega lly authorized represen tative, if appropriate) 
requesting that he or she contact [CONTACT_31691]. A copy of this letter and any response 
should be kept in the subject study records. If the subject cannot be contact[CONTACT_342115], the subject will be considered lost to follow-up.
The investigator (or designee) must explain to each subject before enrollment into the study 
that the subject’s protected health informati on obtained during the study may be shared with - protocol.pdf Page 58

BioMarin, regulatory agencies, and the IRB/IEC/RE B. It is the investigator’s (or designee’s) 
responsibility to obtain written permission to  use protected health information per 
country-specific regulations, such as the Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
of 1996 (HIPAA) in the [LOCATION_003], from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized representative). If permission to use protected he alth information is withdrawn by [CONTACT_423], 
it is the responsibility of the investigator to obt ain a written request from the subject to ensure 
that no further data will be collected from the subject. The subject will then be removed from the study. 
It is a priority of the study to maximize study subject retention and adherence to study-
specific procedures. The completeness of the study data may affect the integrity and accuracy of the study results. Therefore, subjects who discontinue study treatment should be 
encouraged to continue to undergo as many of the protocol-specified procedures and 
assessments as possible for the remainder of  the study, as long as such continued 
participation does not de trimentally affect the health, safe ty, or welfare of the subject and 
consent remains in place. It is important that following treatment discontinuation the original visit schedule is strictly adhered to.
For subjects who discontinue BMN [ADDRESS_423774] acebo but remain in the study, PK and 
BMN 111 activity assessments w ill be waived completely; vital signs and clinical 
labs/biomarkers will be obtained only once at each visit subsequent to BMN [ADDRESS_423775] has discontinued 
dosing and vital sign and clinical  lab/biomarkers assessments pr eviously designated as “post-
dose” will be waived. All other a ssessments at each visit should be completed if possible and 
the subject is willing. Data from the study proced ures and assessments may be used to further 
characterize the natural progression of ACH. 
BioMarin reserves the right to discontinue the study at any time. Premature termination of 
the study may occur because of regulatory aut hority decision, a change in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_216397]/IEC/REB, clinical or safety reasons, or at the discretion of the Sponsor. The Sponsor 
reserves the right to discontinue the developm ent of BMN 111 at any time, or to discontinue 
participation by [CONTACT_28045] i nvestigator or site for poor en rollment or noncompliance. Any 
decision to terminate the study will be promptly communicated to investigators, regulatory authorities, and IRB/IEC/REB. The investig ator is responsible for communicating any 
decision to terminate a study to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342081] (and their families).- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423776] occurred following completion of dosing.
Follow-up assessments and procedures should be  performed as outlined in the Study 111-301
Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 ). 
Subjects who discontinue from study treatment wi ll be asked to complete study assessments 
and procedures for the remainder of the study.  If subjects discontinue from study treatment
and decline to participate for the remainder of the study, they will be asked to return for a final follow-up visit [ADDRESS_423777]  study visit, and the agreement should be 
documented.
Subjects will participate in the study until completion or until one of the following occurs: 
the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued 
from the study at the discretion of the inves tigator or BioMarin ( upon consultation and in 
agreement with the investigator) or the study is terminated.
9.4 Treatments9.4.1 Treatments AdministeredBioMarin and/or its designee w ill provide the study site with a supply of IP sufficient for the

Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 61
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
The amino acid sequence is an analogue of the naturally occurring tissue-expressed form of 
C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP-53). BMN 111 is a recombinant 39 amino acid peptide that 
includes the 37 C-terminal amino acids of the human CNP-53 sequence, and is engineered to 
include two additional amino acids (Pro-Gly) on the N-terminus, which renders the peptide 
more resistant to degradation. It is a cyclic peptide formed by [CONTACT_308482]. The molecular weight of th e purified product is 4.1 kDa.

assessments will be implemented in those c ountries where country-s pecific versions are 
available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory The PedsQL measurement model was designed to measure health-related quality of life 
(QoL) in children and adolescents. It is a generic tool that includes measurement of physical, emotional, social, and school functioning, a nd has both child self-report and parent-report 
versions. 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Quality of Life in Short Stature YouthThe QoLISSY questionnaire is a disease-spec ific patient-reported outcome (PRO) tool 
consisting of questions across seven domains (P hysical QoL, Social QoL, Emotional QoL, 
Copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Beliefs about Height, Future and Effe cts on Parents) and has both child self-report 
and parent-report versions.
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Functional Inde pendence Measure
The WeeFIM instrument is an assessment t ool that measures func tional performance across
three domains (self-care, mobility and cognition) ( Ireland, 2011; Ireland, 2012 ).
The WeeFIM instrument has been used in prev ious research in children with ACH, and has 
identified ongoing limitations in functional performance across these domains extending beyond the age of 7 years ( Ireland, 2011 ). Because the WeeFIM considers the child’s 
performance from a caregiver’s perspective ( Ireland, 2012 ), this tool in turn gives an 
indication of “burden of care” for families and caregivers of children with ACH.
9.12.4 Exploratory Efficacy Variables9.12.4.1 Sleep Sub-StudyGiven that sleep apnea is a fi nding in children with ACH ( Waters, 1993, ) and has 
implications on functional and health outcomes, an optional sleep sub-study will be performed in a limited number of qualified sleep centers for a subset of subjects.

Biomarkers may include but are not limited to assessment of changes in bone and collagen 
metabolism and BMN 111 bioactivity. BioMarin or designee will perform analysis, and samples may also be used for assay development.   
Samples for blood and/or urine bi omarkers will be collected at the time points presented in 
the Schedule of Events ( Table 9.1.1 ). Refer to the Study Laboratory Manual for instructions 
regarding obtaining and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_128876]. The sample type will also be included in the Study Laboratory Manual.
[IP_ADDRESS] Biomarker Research Sample AnalysesAll samples collected in this study may be us ed for exploratory biom arker research once the 
primary use has been completed.
For each portion of the blood and urine samples reserved for protocol -specified analyses, 
there may be multiple sample a liquots. Once samples have been successfully analyzed during 
the study, unused sample portions may be used  during the study for assay development or 
other purposes stated in this section. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Genomic Biomarker AnalysisWhile the inherited FGFR3 muta tions associated with achondropl asia are well characterized, 
disease phenotype in monogeneic diseases is ofte n modified by [CONTACT_308539]. To 
identify and study genetic variants that ma y modify achondroplasia, a whole blood sample 
will be collected. Exploratory genomics will include, but are not limited to NPR-B, BRAF, and other genes associated with CNP signalin g. Exploratory genomic analysis may inform 
understanding of the BMN [ADDRESS_423795] and his/her legally 
authorized representative (parent or legal guardian).   
9.12.5 Pharmacokinetics VariablesFull PK samples are collected pre-dose and at 5 (± 2 min), 15 (± 2 min), 30 (± 5 min), 
45 (± 5 min), 60 (± 5 min), 90 (± 5 min), 120 (± 5 min) minutes post dose at Day 1, Week 26, and Week 52 visits. Partial PK samples are collected pre-dose and at 15 (± 2 min),

vital signs, physical examination, ECG, X-ray/DXA assessments of bone morphology, 
quality, and growth of the extremities and spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (X-rays only), laboratory test results (urinalysis, chemistry, hematology), and CBCL assessments. Imaging (X-ray/DXA assessments), hip monitoring, biomarker, immunog enicity, salivary cortisol, serum prolactin, 
follicle stimulating (FSH)/luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and physical measurement data will be utilized for safety-related reviews and analysis. FSH/LH will be monitored for all subjects > 8 years of age, and for subjects at Ta nner stage 2 (whichever is earlier). Additional 
assessments will be c onducted to evaluate changes fro m baseline in bone metabolism. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse EventsThe occurrence of AEs will be assessed continuou sly from the time the subject receives study 
drug. The determination, evalua tion and reporting of AEs will be  performed as outlined in 
Section 10. Assessments of AEs will occur at the time points shown in the Schedule of 
Events Table 9.1.1 ). Additionally, contact [CONTACT_3265] a study staff member to the caregiver will be 
required approximately every 4 weeks (+/- 10 days) after the Week [ADDRESS_423797]’s 
medical record and on the AE eCRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures During the StudyAll procedures/intervention/surgery will be recorded after informed consent is obtained and 
after the first administration of study drug, until [ADDRESS_423798] is discontinued from the study 
prematurely, all procedures/intervention/surgery will be recorded at the Early Termination visit.
[IP_ADDRESS] Bone Morphology, Bone Mineral Dens ity, Bone Mineral Content and Bone 
Age
The effect of BMN 111 on bone morphology and pathology will be assessed by X-ray and 
bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) by [CONTACT_11324]. Bone growth and 
age will be assessed by [CONTACT_199084] X-rays of wrist/hand. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging Assessment Procedu res (per Schedule of Events)
Imaging assessment procedures for all visits must be performed using the same instruments.
xLeft hand and wrist X-ray, posterior-ant erior (PA) view, to assess bone age ( Greulich, 
1971, ;Tanner, 1975, ).
xBilateral X-rays of lower extremity (anterior-posterior [AP] and lateral views) to 
assess growth plates. 
xHip imaging via pelvis X-ray to identify hip pathology if clinically indicated by 
[CONTACT_342118].
xLumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] X-rays to measure changes from baseline in bone morphology and 
pathology.  
xDXA scan (whole body less head, spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and 
bone mineral content (BMC). 
Additional imaging may be conduc ted should there be any issues or concerns with the 
subject’s imaging assessments; one example is a situation in which the lower extremity X-rays are not sufficient to determine whethe r the subject’s distal, femoral, and proximal 
tibia growth plates are closed. Imaging assessments will be collected and interpreted by a central reader. If clinically significant abnorma lities are noted, the investig ator or designee is 
required to assess whether it is a ppropriate to report an AE and if the subject should continue 
in the study. Refer to the vendor Imaging Guidelines for detailed imaging assessment 
requirements and procedures.

Samples for total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and drug-specific IgE testing will be drawn on 
Day 1 and in the event of a significant hypersensitivity AE, or at the discretion of the investigator and/or BioMarin. A significant hypersensitivity AE is defined as an event that is grade 3 or higher, requires temporary or perm anent cessation of BMN 111, or is determined 
to be significant at the discretion of investigat or and/or BioMarin (excluding reactions that 
are solely a localized injection site reaction). If a hypersensitivity AE occurs, an unscheduled safety visit should occur no later than 48 hour s of the start of the reaction, including 
inspection of the injection site and clinical laboratory tests. 
Blood (serum) samples should be collected and tested in one or more of the following 
assessments:
xDrug-specific IgE
xTotal IgE
xSerum tryptase
If feasible, a sample for drug-specific IgE s hould be drawn no sooner than 8 hours after the 
event start time or before the next dose. A sa mple for total IgE and serum tryptase should 
also be drawn within 1 hour of the start of th e event when possible or during the unscheduled 
safety visit. 
A localized injection site reaction is defined as skin signs or symptoms restricted to one 
affected primary location, ie, hives, wheals, or swelling or an area of erythema, redness, induration, pain, or itching at or near the site  of injection. Management of such localized 
reactions should be determined by [CONTACT_1188]’s clinical judgment in consultation with

[IP_ADDRESS] Medical PhotographyInjection site photos are optional, but sites ar e strongly encouraged to take photos on Day 1, 
Week 26, Week 52, and Early Termination visit. Du ring a scheduled visit, if photos are being 
planned, photos of the injection s ite will be taken in e ither of these two situations: 1) If an 
injection site reaction (ISR) occurs, photos will be taken for each ISR when it becomes 
apparent (or at onset), at most severe, and then post resolution. The time of the post-
resolution photo may not be the same as the time th e AE resolved, and this is expected. If the 
visit has ended and the ISR has not resolved, the subject is not  expected to remain on site 
until ISR resolves. If the ISR is ongoing at the end of the visit, record as an ongoing AE. 2) If the subject has not had an ISR by [CONTACT_342123] e study visit, a photo will still be taken of the 
injection site used on that day. The site is instructed to document the absence of an ISR on 
the injection administration eCRF. In between vis its, if an ISR worsens or changes in pattern, 
then the subject should have an unscheduled s ite visit. During the visit, photos of the 
injection site with the ISR may be taken. Also, injection sites may be photographed if there is 
a new ISR or at any other time at the discretion/medical judgment of the investigator or as recommended by [CONTACT_456]. - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423813] of monitoring  and recording protocol-defined AEs and SAEs;

measurement of protocol-specified vital signs; and other protocol-defin ed events of special 
interest that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study drug.
10.1.[ADDRESS_423814] medical occurrence (eg, sign, symptom, 
illness, disease or injury) in a subject administered the study-drug or other protocol-imposed intervention, regardless of attribution. This includes the following:
xAEs not previously observed in the subject  that emerge during the course of the 
study.
xPre-existing medical conditions judged by [CONTACT_216440].
xComplications that occur as a result of non-drug protocol-imposed interventions 
(eg, AEs related to screening procedur es, medication washout, or no-treatment 
run-in).
An adverse drug reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the study 
drug caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study-drug and the AE.
10.1.[ADDRESS_423815] medical occurrence that at any dose meets one or more of the 
following criteria:
xIs fatal.
xIs life threatening 
Note: Life-threatening refers to an event that places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. This definition does not include a r eaction that, had it occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death.
xRequires or prolongs in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
xResults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity.- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423816] exposed to IP

xIs an important medical event or reacti on – that, based on medical judgment, may 
jeopardize the subject or require inte rvention to prevent one of the above 
consequences (eg, anaphylaxis).
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for SAEs should be regarded as 
non-serious AEs.

10.2 Methods and Timing for Capturin g and Assessing Safety Parameters
10.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting PeriodThe study AE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported. After informed consent is obtained a nd the first administration of study drug, all 
non-serious AEs and SAEs reporting period begi ns and continues until [ADDRESS_423818] administration of study drug or the Early Termination visit, whichever is longer (refer to Section 12.4). The criteria for determining, and the reporting of, SAEs is 
provided in Section 10.1.[ADDRESS_423819]’s medical record and on the AE eCRF.
10.2.[ADDRESS_423820] or qualified medical designee will 
assess AEs for severity, relationship to stud y drug, and seriousness (refer to Section 10.1.2
for SAE definitions). These assessments must be made by a study clinician with the training and authority to make a diagnosis (eg, MD/DO, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, orDDS).- protocol.pdf Page 82
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 82

[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness
The investigator will assess if an AE shoul d be classified as “serious” based on the 
seriousness criteria enumerated in Section 10.1.2 . Seriousness serves as a guide for defining 
regulatory reporting obligations.
[IP_ADDRESS] SeveritySeverity (as in mild, mode rate, or severe headache) is not e quivalent to seriousness, which is 
based on subject/event outcome or  action criteria usually associat ed with events that pose a 
threat to a subject’s life or functioning. The severity of each will be assessed using the 
defined categories in Table [IP_ADDRESS].1.
The investigator will determine the severity of each AE and SAE [and EOSI, if applicable] 
using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CT CAE v4. Adverse events that do not have a 
corresponding CTCAE term will be  assessed according to the general guidelines for grading 
used in the CTCAE v4 as stated below.
Table [IP_ADDRESS].1: Adverse Event Gr ading (Severity) Scale
Grade Description
1Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated
2Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-
appropriate instrumental ADLa
3Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12342]; disabling; limiting self-care ADLb
4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Grade 4 and 5 AEs 
should always be 
reported as SAEs5Death related to AE
aInstrumental ADL refers to the following examples: preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the 
telephone, managing money.
bSelf-care ADL refer to the following examples: bathing, dr essing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet, 
taking medications, not bedridden.
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality 
The investigator will determine the relationship of an AE to the study drug and will record it 
on the source documents and AE CRF. To ensu re consistency of causality assessments, 
investigators should apply the guidance in Table [IP_ADDRESS].1 .- protocol.pdf Page 83
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 83
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
Table [IP_ADDRESS].1: Causality Attribution Guidance
Relationship Description
Not Related xExposure to the IP has not occurred
OR
xThe administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are not 
reasonably related in time
OR
xThe AE is considered likely to be re lated to an etiology other than the 
use of the IP; that is, there are no facts, evidence, or arguments to 
suggest a causal relationship to the IP.
Related xThe administration of the IP and the occurrence of the AE are 
reasonably related in time
AND
xThe AE could possibly be explained by [CONTACT_342124].
Factors suggestive of a causal relationship could include (but are not limited to):
xPlausible temporal relationship.
xAbsence of alternative explanations.
xRarity of event in a given subject or disease state.
xAbsence of event prior to study drug exposure.
xConsistency with study product pharmacology.
xKnown relationship to underlying mechanism of study drug action.
xSimilarity to adverse reactions seen with related drug products.
xAbatement of AE with discontinuation of st udy drug, and/or recurrence of AE with 
reintroduction of study drug.- protocol.pdf Page 84
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 84
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
The investigator’s assessment of causality for individual AE reports is part of the study 
documentation process. Regard less of the investigator’s  assessment of causality for 
individual AE reports, the Sponsor will prom ptly evaluate all re ported SAEs against 
cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new 
safety findings to investigators and applicable regulatory authorities. 
10.[ADDRESS_423821] only one diagnosis, sign, or symptom per event field on the AE eCRF (eg, nausea and 
vomiting should not be recorded in the same  entry, but as 2 separate entries).
In order to classify AEs and diseases, preferre d terms will be assigned by [CONTACT_342125], using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.
[IP_ADDRESS] Diagnosis versus Signs and SymptomsUsing accepted medical terminology, enter th e diagnosis (if known). If not known, enter the 
most medically significant sign(s) and/or symp tom(s). If a diagnosis subsequently becomes 
available, then this diagnosis should be entered on the AE form, replacing the original entries 
where appropriate.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Occurring Secondary to Other Events
In general, AEs occurring secondary to other ev ents (eg, cascade events) should be identified 
by [CONTACT_5252]. For example, if seve re diarrhea is known to have resulted in 
dehydration, it is sufficient to record only diarrhea as an AE or SAE on the eCRF. However, medically important events that may be linked an d/or separated in time should be recorded as 
independent events on the eCRF. For example, if severe hemorrhage leads to renal failure, 
both events should be recorded separately on the eCRF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Persistent or Recurrent Adverse EventsA persistent AE is one that extends con tinuously, without resolution, between subject 
evaluation time points. Such an event should be recorded only once on the eCRF unless its 
severity increases or decreases (in which case it should be recorded again on the AE eCRF).
A recurrent AE is one that occurs and resolves between subject evaluation time points, but 
then subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of  the AE should be recorded on the AE eCRF. - protocol.pdf Page 85
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 85
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypotension
If an asymptomatic drop in bl ood pressure meets the protocol definition of AE per clinical 
judgment of the reporter, report the event as “b lood pressure decreased.” If the drop in blood 
pressure is associated with signs or symptoms, complete the symptomatic hypotension eCRF and use the following guidance to report the corresponding AE eCRF: If a unifying diagnosis is available to explain the event of hypotensi on, report the diagnosis as an AE and capture 
signs and symptoms on the symptomatic hy potension eCRF page. If no other unifying 
diagnosis is available, report “hypotension” as  the event and capture signs and symptoms on 
the symptomatic hypotension eCRF page. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Injection Site ReactionsIf an injection site reaction is associated with a single sign or symptom, report the event on 
AE eCRF page (eg, redness at injection site, AE is injection site redness). If the injection site reaction is associated with multiple signs or sy mptoms, report injecti on site reaction as the
adverse event on the AE page, and individual signs and symptoms will be reported on the ISR eCRF page (eg, if the subject experience s redness and induration, report “Injection site 
reaction” on the AE page, and in the corres ponding Injection eCRF page, report erythema 
and induration).
[IP_ADDRESS] Abnormal Laboratory ValuesA data transfer file from the central laboratory will provide laboratory test results.Any laboratory result abnormality fulfilling the criteria for a SAE should be reported as such, 
in addition to being recorded as an AE in the eCRF.- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423822] to confirm the abnormality and any one or mo re of the following conditions 
are met:
xAccompanied by [CONTACT_4659].
xLeading to a change in study medication (eg, interruption or permanent 
discontinuation).  
xRequiring a change in concomitant therapy (eg, addition of, interruption of, 
discontinuation of, or any other change in a concomitant medication, therapy or 
treatment).
xThe abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity.
xThe abnormality is of a degree that require s active management (eg, discontinuation 
of study drug, more frequent follow-up asse ssments, further diagnostic investigation).
This applies to any protocol and non-protocol specif ied safety and efficacy laboratory result 
from tests performed after the first dose of stud y medication that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range and meets the clinical significance criteria.
This does not apply to any abnormal laborator y result that falls outside the laboratory 
reference range but that does not meet the clinical significance criteria (these will be analyzed and reported as laboratory abnormalities), those that are considered AEs of the type explicitly exempted by [CONTACT_760], or those which are a result of an AE that has already 
been reported.
[IP_ADDRESS] Pre-existing ConditionsA pre-existing condition is one that is present at the screening visit. Such conditions should 
be recorded as medical history on the appropriate eCRF. 
A pre-existing condition should be recorded as an AE or SAE during the study only if the 
frequency, intensity, or character of the c ondition worsens during the study period. It is 
important to convey the concept that a pre- existing condition has changed by [CONTACT_189692] (eg, more frequent headaches).
[IP_ADDRESS] General Physical Examination FindingsAt screening, any clinically significant abno rmality should be recorded as a pre-existing 
condition (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] ). During the study, any new clinically significant findings 
and/or abnormalities discovered on physical examination th at meet the definition of an AE 
(or an SAE) must be recorded and document as an AE or SAE on the AE eCRF. - protocol.pdf Page 87

[IP_ADDRESS] Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or Surgery 
Any AE that results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342083] (refer to 
Section 10.1.2 ).
There are some hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342084]. These scenarios include planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_342085]:
xPerform a protocol-mandated procedure.
xUndergo a diagnostic or elective surgical pr ocedure planned prior to study enrollment 
or for a pre-existing medical condition that has not changed.
xReceive scheduled therapy (study drug or otherwise) for the study indication. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Deaths
All deaths that occur during the AE  reporting period (refer to Section 10.2.1 ), regardless of 
attribution, will be recorded on the AE eCRF a nd expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an 
SAE.
When recording a death, the event or conditi on that caused or contributed to the fatal 
outcome should be recorded as the single medi cal concept on the eCRF. If the cause of death 
is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, record “Unexplained Death” 
or “Death of Unknown Cause” on the eCRF. If th e death is attributed to progression of the 
disease or condition being studied, record prog ression of achondroplasia as the SAE term on 
the eCRF.
[IP_ADDRESS] PregnancyAlthough not an AE per se, pregnancy in either a subject or the partne r of a subject taking 
trial medication should be re ported to facilitate outcome monitoring by [CONTACT_1034]. 
The reporting period for pregnancy in a subject or partner begins following the first dose of 
study drug and continues until [ADDRESS_423823] be reported within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy by [CONTACT_342126] (BPV). In addition, pregnancy in a subject is also reported on the End of Study eCRF. The investigator must make every effort to  follow the subject through resolution of the 
pregnancy (delivery or termin ation) and to report the reso lution on the Pregnancy Follow-up
in the eCRF. In the event of pregnancy in the partner of a study subject, the investigator - protocol.pdf Page 88
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 88

should make every reasonable attempt to obtain the woman’s consent for release of protected 
health information.
Abortion, whether therapeutic or spontaneous, shou ld always be classified as an SAE (as the 
Sponsor considers these to be medically significant), recorded on the eCRF, and 
expeditiously reported to the Sponsor as an SAE.
10.4 Reporting RequirementsThe Sponsor is responsible for identifying, pr eparing, and reporting all suspected unexpected
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees, and investigators in accordance with requirements identified in the Clinical Trials Regulations.
10.4.1 Expedited Reporting RequirementsAll SAEs that occur during the course of the AE Reporting Period (refer to Section 10.2.1 ), 
whether or not considered re lated to study drug, must be reported by [CONTACT_342127]-specific SAE Report Form to BPV within  [ADDRESS_423824] information that fully documents the event before notifying BPV of an SAE. BioMarin may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that investigators submit any information requested by [CONTACT_189610].
The study SAE reporting period is as follows: after informed consent but prior to initiation of 
study treatment, only SAEs associated with any protocol-imposed interventions will be reported. After informed consent is obtained a nd the first administration of study drug, all 
SAEs must be reported through [ADDRESS_423825] administration of study drug 
or the Early Termination vi sit, whichever is longer. 
10.4.2 IRB/EC Reporting RequirementsReporting of SAEs to the IRB/IEC/REB will be done in compliance with the standard 
operating procedures and policie s of the IRB/IEC/REB and with applicable regulatory 
requirements. Adequate documen tation must be obtained by [CONTACT_342128]/IEC/REB was properly and promptly notified as required.- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423826] to follow-up, or it has been determined that the study treatment 
or participation is not the cause of the AE /SAE. Outcome of AEs and resolution of SAEs 
(with dates) should be documented on the AE e CRF and in the subject’s medical record to 
facilitate source data verification.
For some SAEs, the Sponsor may follow up by  [CONTACT_756], fax, electronic mail, and/or a 
monitoring visit to obtain additional case details  (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_44458], consultant 
report, autopsy report) deemed necessary to appropriately evaluate the SAE report.
10.[ADDRESS_423827] to report, to the 
investigator and/or to BPV directly, any s ubsequent SAEs that the subject’s personal 
physician(s) believes might be related to prior study treatment.
The investigator should notify the study Sponsor  of any death or SAE occurring at any time 
after a subject has discontinued or  terminated study participati on, if the investigator believes 
that the death or SAE may have been relate d to prior study treatment. The Sponsor should 
also be notified if the investigator should beco me aware of the development of cancer or of a 
congenital anomaly in a subseque ntly conceived offspring of a subject that participated in 
this study. 
10.[ADDRESS_423828] s, and th at the appropriate regula tory bodies should be 
notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of th e circumstances, notab ly the occurrence of 
any new event relating to the conduct of the tria l or the development of  the investigational 
medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the 
sponsor and the investigator sh all take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect the 
subjects against any immediate hazard. The spons or shall forthwith inform the competent 
authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the IRB/IEC/REB is notified at the same time.” 
The Sponsor is responsible for identifying, pr eparing and reporting all suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the relevant competent authorities, ethics committees - protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423829] 
study visit or at the Early Termination visit. Investigators are required to report any events 
which may require the implementation of urge nt safety measures to BioMarin within 
24 hours. 
Examples of situations that may require urge nt safety measures include discovery of the 
following:
xImmediate need to revise the IP adminis tration (eg, modified dose amount, frequency 
not defined in protocol).
xLack of study scientific value, or detrimental study conduct or management.
xDiscovery that the quality or safety of the IP does not meet established safety 
requirements.

information available indicates that the AE is likely treatment emergent. 
Additional details regarding the handling of missing data will be provided in the SAP. 14.2 Efficacy AnalysisAll efficacy analysis will be done on th e efficacy population defined in Section 14.7.1
14.2.1 Primary Efficacy AnalysisThe primary efficacy endpoint is the cha nge from baseline in AGV at the 12–month time 
point. For a given interval [Date1, Da te2], the AGV is defined as follows:
where the interval length in days is calcul ated as Date2 – Date1. AGV will be calculated for 
the following visits/intervals:

The baseline of the AGV is established in th e natural history stud y of Study111-901, based 
on the standing height measurements in the last [ADDRESS_423841]-squares (LS) means of the change from baseline in AGV at 12-month will 
be used to estimate the primary estima nd for the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)  model, with fixed-effect terms including 
treatment group, sex, and Tanner stage, and age and the baseline AGV as covariates. The 
following primary hypothesis will be tested (two-tailed):

Subjects who discontinue from the study drug w ill be encouraged to remain in the study and
their non-missing height measurements will continue  to be used in calculating the AGV and
to be included in the analysis per intend to tr eat principle. In the event that missing data does
occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_321510], missing standing height will be imputed based on multipleimputation (MI) with pattern-mixture models ( Little 1993; Molenberghs 2007 ) implemented 
in Proc MI of SAS where the missing, unobserved observations of the standing height areassumed to follow missing not at random (MNAR) mechanism. Each imputation will requiresufficient standing height data collected from the subjects in the same randomization group who also discontinue treatment prematurely (but remain in the study), referred to as off-
treatment data, as these subjects will be us ed as the reference data for MI. Ten (10) sets of
imputations of the missing standing heights will be constructed from MI and the AGV at themissing time points will be calculated based on these [ADDRESS_423842]-trea tment visit will be 
summarized at Week 26 and Week 52 using desc riptive statistics (mea n, SD, median, Q1,Q3, 
minimum, and maximum) per group.  
14.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses The key secondary efficacy endpoints are the ch ange from baseline in height Z-score and the 
change from baseline in upper:lower body se gment ratio. The estimand of the secondary 
efficacy endpoints is the difference in mean change from baseline in the corresponding 
endpoint at 12-month time point between  the BMN 111 group and the placebo group 
(all randomized subjects).
The measurement of standing heig ht at each scheduled visit w ill be converted to age-and sex-
appropriate standard score, also referred to as Z-score, by [CONTACT_308548] (not ACH). The height Z-score and its change from baseline will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The null hypothe sis of no difference between the BMN [ADDRESS_423843] terms including treatment group, se x, and Tanner stage, and age and the baseline 
Z-score as covariates. The analysis results based on the 10 imputed datasets will be summarized using Proc MIANALIZE in SAS. The upper:lower body segment ratio and its 
change from baseline will be similarly summarized and tested.    
Additional secondary efficacy e ndpoints include change from base line in body proportions of 
the extremities, HRQoL (QoLISSY, PedsQL) scores, and functional independence (WeeFIM) scores. 
Details regarding the analysis methods fo r the additional secondary endpoints will be 
provided in the SAP. - protocol.pdf Page 106

14.2.3 Controlling for Multiplicity
The overall type I family-wise error rate for testing the primary and secondary efficacy 
endpoints will be controlled at the 0.05 significan ce level using the following 3-step serial 
gatekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_342086] (MCP). Following this MCP, advancement to the next step will only occur if the null hypotheses within a step and the previous step(s) are all rejected at the significance level of 0.[ADDRESS_423844] compar ing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group for 
the primary efficacy endpoint, the chan ge from baseline in AGV at 12-month time 
point. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (i e, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in 
favor of BMN 111, all subsequent  statistical tests will not be  considered statistically 
significant. The study is considered positive if the primary test is significant in favor of BMN 111. 
2. The second step will be the test comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group 
for the secondary efficacy endpoint, the chan ge from baseline in height Z-score at 
12-month time point. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (ie, p-value > 0.05) or is rejected but not in favor of BMN 111, the subsequent statistical test will not be
considered statistically significant. 
3. The third step will be the tests comparing the BMN 111 group to the placebo group 
for the secondary efficacy endpoint, the change from baseline in upper:lower body 
segment ratio at 12-month time point  at a significance level of 0.05. 
By-subject listings will also be provided for efficacy endpoints.  
14.2.4 Sensitivity AnalysesTo assess the robustness of the primary analys is result, sensitivity analyses such as the 
following will be performed: 
Mixed Model with Repeated Measures (MMRM)
The primary null hypothesis of no difference between the BMN 111 group and the placebo 
group in the mean change from baseline in A GV at the 12-month time point will be tested 
using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM), with fixed-effect terms including treatment group, visit, sex, Tanner stage, and interaction of trea tment group and visit, and age 
and the baseline AGV as covariates, repeated  over visits. All available AGV assessments 
from all scheduled visits up to 12-month will be used in the MMRM analysis.  - protocol.pdf Page 107
Study 111-301 Amendment 4 Page 107
Proprietary and Confidential 01 February 2019
MI Based on Missing At Random (MAR) Assumption
The sensitivity analyses will be based on the MI technique as proposed by [CONTACT_342099] 
(1987) implemented in PROC MI  of SAS where the missing, unobserved observations of the 
response variable are assumed to follow mi ssing at random (MAR) mechanism. The MI 
procedure will be directly applied to standing height and AGV will be calculated based on imputed height. The ANCOVA model described in  the primary analysis will be performed 
separately for each imputation dataset and a summary overall imputed samples will be provided for each analysis. 
Random Coefficients Model
The mean change from baseline (Day 1) in height at 12-month time point will be estimated 
for both the treatment group and the placebo group based on a MMRM, with fixed-effect
terms including treatment group, visit, sex, Tanne r stage, and age and the baseline height as 
covariates, and random-effect terms of the in tercept and the subject*visit interaction. For 
each randomized group, an AGV at 12-month time poi nt will be defined as the mean change 
from baseline in height at 12-m onth from the MMRM model above.  
ANCOVA on Completers
In this sensitivity analysis, the estimand will be the difference of the means of the change 
from baseline in AGV at 12-month observe d from subjects who have non-missing 
observation at 12-month between the two ra ndomized groups. No missing data will be 
imputed. The LS means of the change from baseline in AGV at 12-month will be estimated 
for both the randomized groups by [CONTACT_342130]. In this analysis, only subjects with  observed AGV change from baseline at 12-
month will be included. No extrapolation or imputation will be performed for missing 12-month standing height measurements.  
14.2.5 Exploratory AnalysesExploratory endpoints include sleep apnea assessment, BMN 111 activity biomarkers and 
genomic biomarkers. 
Details regarding the analysis methods for th e exploratory endpoints will be provided in the 
SAP.

including laboratory tests, vital signs, EC G, X-ray and DXA assessments, clinical hip 
assessment, and anti-BMN 111 immunogenicity (d iscussed in the next section) will be 
summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_19313], listings w ill be provided for these safety endpoints.

correlations with measures of safety, PK, and efficacy.
14.6 Determination of Sample SizeWith 55 subjects planned in each of the two randomized groups (one BMN 111 dose group 
and one placebo group), the power to detect  a difference of 1.75 cm/year between the 
BMN 111 group and the placebo group in change from baseline in AGV at 12 months is approximately 90%, assuming that the pooled stan dard deviation of the change from baseline 
in AGV is 2.80, using a two-sided two-sample t- test at a 0.05 significance level. The power 
calculation is based on data from Study 111- 202 (a phase 2, open-labe l, sequential cohort 
dose-escalation study) and Study 111-901 (a natu ral history study for pediatric subjects with 
achondroplasia).

16 COMPENSATION AND INSURANCE
There will be no charge to study subjects to be in this study. BioMarin will pay all costs of 
tests, procedures, and treatments that are part of this study. In addition, after IRB/EC/REB 
approval, BioMarin may reimburse the cost of travel for study-related visits. BioMarin will not pay for any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort, 
whether or not related to the study subject’s di sease that are not part of this study. Costs 
associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] , tests, and treatments should be  billed and collected in the 
way that such costs are usually billed and collected.
The investigator should contact [CONTACT_189471] a study subject 
has been injured by [CONTACT_189472]. Any subject who 
experiences a study-related injury should be inst ructed by [CONTACT_44529] a pre-specified medical institution if possible, or at the closest medical treatment facility if necessary. The subject should be give n the name [CONTACT_4007] a person to contact [CONTACT_44530], and assistance w ith, treatment for study-related injuries. 
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the investigator’s 
instructions, BioMarin will pay for reasonable  and necessary medical services to treat the 
injuries caused by [CONTACT_44531] , if these costs are not covered by [CONTACT_342132]. In some jurisdictions, BioMarin 
is obligated by [CONTACT_44533]-related in juries without prior recourse to third party 
payer billing. If this is the case, BioMarin will comply with the law.- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423849] reported data is transmitted directly to EDC, as referenced in the study sp ecific vendor management plan. 
Unless explicitly allowed in the CRF instructions, blank data fields are not acceptable. In the event of an entry error, or if new information becomes available, the value will be 
corrected by [CONTACT_216456]. In compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, th e system will require the personnel making 
the correction to enter a reason for changing the value. The documented audit trail will include the reason for the change, the original value, the new value, the time of the correction and the identity of the operator.
BioMarin’s policy is that study data on the e CRFs must be verifiable to the source data, 
which necessitates access to all original record ings, laboratory reports, and subject records. 
In addition, all source data shoul d be attributable (signed and dated). The investigator must 
therefore agree to allow direct access to all source data. Subjects (or their legally authorized representative) must also allow access to their medical records, and subjects will be informed of this and will confirm their agreement when giving informed consent. If an investigator or institution refuses to allow access to subject re cords because of confidentiality, arrangements 
must be made to allow an “inter view” style of data verification.
A CRA designated by [CONTACT_216458] “Source Data Verified” (SDV). Electronic subject-reported data transmitted directly into EDC will not be SDV’d or queried.
If an error is discovered at any time or a clarification is needed, the CRA, or designee, will 
create an electronic query on the associated field. Site personne l will then answer the query 
by [CONTACT_187701]. The CRA will then review the 
response and determine either to close the query  or re–query the site if the response does not 
fully address the question. This process is repeated until all open queries have been answered and closed. 
Before a subject’s eCRF casebook can be locked, da ta fields must be source data verified and 
all queries closed. Refer to the Clinical Monito ring Plan for details on which fields must be - protocol.pdf Page 114

a clinical site at any time before, during, or af ter completion of the study. The investigator 
will be informed if an audit is to take pl ace and advised as to the scope of the audit. 
Representatives of the FDA or other Regulatory  Agencies may also conduct an inspection of 
the study. If informed of such an inspection, the investigator should notify BioMarin immediately. The investigator will ensure that the auditors have access to the clinical supplies, study site facilitie s, original source docume ntation, and all study files.- protocol.pdf Page [ADDRESS_423851] udy files. The investigator /institution must 
take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of essential documents, that is, documents that individually and collectively pe rmit evaluation of the conduct of a study and 
the quality of the data produced, including paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_44460] (eg, subject charts)
as well as any original source documents that are electronic as required by [CONTACT_25435]. 
All study records must be retained for at least [ADDRESS_423852] approval of a marketing

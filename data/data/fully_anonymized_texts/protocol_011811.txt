1.  Purpose and objectives.           List the purpose and objectives:  
 
The purpose of this study is t o assess the diuretic efficiency of subcutaneous furosemide (Furoscix) compared to 
oral diuretic therapy for patients post heart failure (HF)  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731161] -ADHF  (Blood urea nitrogen, cre Atinine, N atriuretic  Peptide levels, Atrial fibrillation , 
Diastolic blood pressure, Hypertension and H ome diuretic dose, and H eart Failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] ) risk score.  
 
Key Outcomes:  
1. Post-treatment urine output over 8 hours. This will be assessed in mL per mg of treatment  (Furoscix vs. oral 
diuretic ). 
2. Post-treatment urine sodium. Urine sodium will be assessed hourly over [ADDRESS_998696] -treatment.  
Safety Outcome Measures : 
1. Number of participants with post -intervention need for emergency department visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
The count of participants with post -intervention need for emergency department visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731162].  
 
Goals: Successful completion of this project will establish proof of concept that Furoscix provides more effective 
post-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731163] a diuretic resistance patient population. This study will 
provide pi[INVESTIGATOR_731164] a diuretic -resistant heart failure population.

a. Background  
Form A  
IRB #  STU-[ADDRESS_998697] for 
HF was $11,552 in 2014, totaling an estimated $[ADDRESS_998698] -discharge environment predispose patients to frequent readmission 
and a worse prognosis.
3 Importantly, there is heterogeneity in patient response to intravenous diuresis, with an 
estimated 20- 50% of patients having poor response to initial IV diuretic therapy.[ADDRESS_998699] increased risk of re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47144]. Importantly, our group recently 
derived an integer -based risk score (BAN -ADHF score) to predict patients with low diuretic efficiency, with the 
research winning the NHLBI Heart Failure Data Challenge.4,5  
 
As part of patient’s standard of care, they receive oral diuretics, including furosemide or torsemide, which are 
FDA approved for treating congestion and volume overload from heart failure. However, some patients are 
“resistant” to oral diuretics and have higher risk of repeat hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Therefore, purpose of this study is to 
evaluate treatment with subcutaneous furosemide (Furoscix) compared with oral diuretic therapy for patients with 
recent heart failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731165].  
 
Furoscix  (Furosemide Injection) is FDA approved for subcutaneous administration for the treatment of congestion 
due to fluid overload in adult patients with [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) Class II and Class III chronic 
heart failure who display reduced responsiveness to oral diuretics and who do not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] .6 The 
research team is collecting safety and efficacy data on this drug.   
 
This drug is administered via a device called the Infusor  (Note: The research team is not studying the device 
component) . The Infusor delivers 80 mg of Furoscix.  Per Sponsor: “ The infusor is a compact, ethylene oxide 
(EtO) sterilized, single -use, electro- mechanical (battery powered, micro- processor controlled), on- body 
subcutaneous delivery system based on the SmartDose® Gen II 10 mL (West Pharmaceutical Services).  The 
Infusor is applied to the abdomen via a medical grade adhesive and delivers a subcutaneous infusion of Furoscix 
through a pre- programmed, biphasic delivery profile with 30 mg (3.75 mL) administered over the first hour, 
followed by 12.5 mg (1.56 mL) per hour for the subsequent 4 hours (Total dose is 80 mg (10 mL) over 5 hours). ”7

 Intervention, Setting, and Design : We are recruiting patients from UTSW and Parkland. All of the research 
procedures in this study will take place at the Clinical Research Unit in the Aston Building at UT Southwestern Medical Center. This will be a randomized, open- label pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] [ADDRESS_998701] -discharge outpatient diuresis than oral diuretics . Diuretic 
resistance will be identified using the BAN -ADHF ( Blood urea nitrogen, creA tinine, N atriuretic  Peptide levels, Atrial 
fibrillation, Diastolic blood pressure, H ypertension and H ome diuretic dose, and Heart Failure hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059])  score 
which has been integrated into the electronic health record. The score is integer -based with a score of 
≥ 12 
indicating diuretic resistance with high likelihood of poor outcomes.  
 
Screening : 
• We are requesting a partial HIPAA waiver to review electronic health records and confirm their eligibility in 
the study. Pre -screening will occur through the electronic health record to evaluate for inclusion and 
exclusion criteria and to assess if women of child- bearing potential have a pregnancy test to confirm they 
are not pregnant. Lab testing will be reviewed. These include review of urine drug screen, alcohol screen (if clinically indicated), NT -proBNP, creatinine clearance.  
• BAN-ADHF score will be calculated.

STU2022- 0768, Pandey, FormA -Protocol, Mod_6, 07 -22-24 5 
V2Mar2018 • After patients are screened , patients will be approached for potential participation. If patients are interested, 
they will be scheduled for an in- person randomization visit optimally within 1- 7 days  of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], 
although patients will be eligible up to 14 days after discharge.  
• At the research appointment, patients will be asked if they are interested in voluntarily participating in this 
study.  
 
Research Visit:  
 Pre-Randomization: 
• Confirm eligibility   
• Obtain informed consent   
• Physical exam including vital signs assessment.  
• Prior and concomitant medication assessment.  
 
Randomization:  If patients still meet all eligibility criteria  and sign informed consent , they will undergo stratified randomization based 
on BAN -ADHF score (
≥12 vs. <1 2). Within each stratum, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (intervention: 
control)  during the research visit. Patients will be informed via telephone prior to visit to not take home oral dose of 
diuretic on the day of the visit and will be instructed to hold any caffeine products such as coffee or any other drugs that could increase urine output on the day of the visit.   
• Intervention: Furoscix  – administration of subcutaneous furosemide (Furoscix) during study visit . It will be 
administered using the Furoscix I nfusor.  Per information from the Sponsor,  “The Infusor is placed on the 
patient’s abdomen for subcutaneous infusion. Furoscix is delivered subcutaneously through a small, 27-gauge, 6 mm needle. The Infusor is preprogramed to deliver 80 mg (10 mL) furosemide over 5 hours using 
a biphasic delivery profile of 30 mg furosemide (3.75 mL) over the first hour and 12.5 mg furosemide (1.56 
mL) per hour over the subsequent 4 hours .”
7 
• Control: Oral Diuretic  - administration of oral diuretic during study visit . Patients will bring their home 
prescription of oral diuretic and will take the oral formulation while in the visit. If the patient did not bring 
their home dose, an equivalent oral dose will be provided from the UT Southwestern Investigational Drug Service.  
 
The intervention arm (Furoscix over 5 hours at 8 mg/mL) will be compared to a usual care group (home oral diuretic 
dose prescribed by [CONTACT_731167]). Patients will be monitored for [ADDRESS_998702]-
drug administration for clinical safety and to measure clinical response.  
 Other research procedures:  
• Patients will be instructed to void immediately before dosing (pre- dose urine) and this sample will be 
discarded. After medication administration, urine from spontaneous voids during post -dose phases will be 
collected and recorded. Urine sodium measurements will be obtained at hourly intervals. Urine from each 
collection period must be refrigerated until the end of the collection period. Total volume of urine produced will be assessed over [ADDRESS_998703] i n a yellow round bottom tube.   
• Collect approximately [ADDRESS_998704] to check patient’s electrolytes. This will be done at  the 
end of the research visit.   
• Call participants in 7 days after their research visit to assess if patient has had a presentation to urgent care, 
emergency department, or is re- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_731166] e exacerbation in heart failure.  
 Compensation:  
To account for a full day of research monitoring, patients will be compensated $[ADDRESS_998705].  
 Data Safety and Monitoring:  
Patient safety will be tracked over the study. For any adverse events (AE) that occur during their participation in the 
study, medical care will be provided and patients will be followed until resolution. See Form D for more details.

V2Mar2018  
Furoscix is a specific subcutaneous formulation of furosemide. Patients are required to be taking home diuretics 
as eligibility criteria;  therefore we anticipate very few side effects associated with the medication. Skin reactions 
may occur with administration of Furoscix, although this is a rare side effect. Patients will be monitored for [ADDRESS_998716] medication administration, with a serum potassium check performed after the study visit to ensure 
stable serum electrolytes.  
 
b.  Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse 
events, or unanticipated problems involving subjects.  
A physician will be always available  during the study visits. A research nurse will be monitoring the patient 
throughout the research visit. We will also follow up with patients over the phone in a week after their study visit.  
 
Should any AE’s occur, it will be documented and medical care will be provided. The team will follow patient’s AE 
until resolution. See Form D for more information.

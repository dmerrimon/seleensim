Version 3.2, dated July7 , 2018 6 1.Introduction
1.1. Disease Background 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_574523] (SCI) cause costly and morbid chronic conditions such as lack o f voluntary 
movement, increased chan ce of pressur e sores, problemati c spasticity, lo ss of bowel, bladder, and 
sexual function, and mo re physical impairm ents which result in a lower quality of life and lack of 
independence. Approximately 285,000 people in th e U.S. hav e SCI with approximately 17,000 new 
subjects add ed each year [1]. It is recognized that 54 % of SCI’s are cervical injuries resulting in upper 
extremity neur omuscul ar motor impairmen t [2]. Through a published survey, 48.7% of quadriplegics 
indicated th at regaining arm and hand function would b e the preferred treatmen t to improv e quality of 
life [3,4]. 
While ther e are no treatmen ts that reverse all morbiditi es of SCI , cellular research, spi[INVESTIGATOR_287197], and advan ced high-intensity fitness regimens sho w promis e in treating the effects of SCI 
and improving independen ce and quality of life [5,6,7] . Remarkably, subjects with AIS A o r B injuries, 
defined as “complete” motor and sensory loss and “incomplete” with sensory but not motor function, 
respectively , have shown improvemen t in motor scores after 6 months with structured exercise (20). 
Moreover, advanc es in independ ence have been shown in subjects with complete injuri es after year-
long rehabilitation programs (22). Thes e, and studies on orthoti cs and exoskeletons used to improve 
strength and neur omuscular heal th have focused mainl y on the lower extremity (1-4) and restoration of 
lower extremity function on improving independenc e in activities of daily living (ADLs) in subjects with 
cervical SCI (6).  
Recent advanc es in upper extremity orthotics with devices such as a mobile arm suppo rt, WREX, Armeo 
Roboti c Arm Train er, MyoPro, and the Swedish arm support have led to strengthened upp er extremities 
and improved independen ce in activiti es of daily living (ADLs ) of those with cervical SCI [14,15,16]. They 
are limited by [CONTACT_225437], size, comfor t, weigh t, and functionality [14]. Another importan t limitation is that 
many o f these devices focus on in-clinic rehabilitation and limit the frequency of rehab opportunities 
and insuran ce coverage. Re cent studies hav e shown a significan t correlation between high frequ ency of 
rehab sessions and improved outcomes [7,17,18].  
1.2. AbiliTech Medical APEX Background 
The Active Powered Prosthosis (APEX) is a portabl e upper extremity prosthesis device that helps users 
with upp er extremity motor impairment move their upper extremities through active robotic assistance. 
The device is controlled through body motion activation (i.e.: a body mounted 9 d egree of freedom 
accelerometer sensor that is wirelessly connected to the device to interpret the user’s movement into 
upper extremity assisted movement).  The APEX device  body chassis is worn by [CONTACT_574546], power, motors, sensors, and cables attached to the motors . Cables attached to 
the motors will extend throughout the body chassis to enable actuation of the user’s upper extremities. 
The APEX is designed for optimal subject safety including mechanical, electrical and software stops to 
prevent uncontrolled device movement and injury to subjects. 
Arm movement i s activated and controlled by [CONTACT_574547] (ACS- III) consisting of body 
mounted movement control inputs and sensors, an on-board processor, sensors, motors, and firmware. 
While the APEX mechanical design is the initial concept model, the ACS III control system represents a 
third-generation control and data collection design. User directed control inputs will be 
Version 3.2, dated July7 , 2018 7 body motion activated, sensors will be placed on the head and/or combination of a head mounted 
joystick and buttons.  
This is a first of its kind proof- of-concept model using a mobile Bowden-Cable robotic system to mobilize 
the upper extremity. A similar published research device called the CAREX [19] has demonstrated proof-
of-concept but is stationary and has limited data on its use. 
AbiliTech Medical has experience in developi[INVESTIGATOR_574524]. The AbiliTech Assist and the Hand Grip 
glove , funded by [CONTACT_574548][INVESTIGATOR_574525], are devices currently in development by [CONTACT_574549]. The AbiliT ech Assist is a hybrid 
power device. Motors power (active) the compression or relaxation of multiple arm and shoulder 
springs (passive) to provide lift and assist for users with reduced upper extremity mobility . The AbiliTech 
Hand Grip System , uses motors and cables to help users grasp and hold different objects and is similar in 
cable driven architecture to the APEX device . The APEX device will be a third-generation device 
leveraging the design architecture eg. ACS-III and clinical learning experience.  
1.3. Other Similar Devices 
To date, there are no mobile devices available that provide shoulder-elbow active motion assistance 
to individuals with upper extremity motor impairment. There are similar devices, such as the Hocoma 
Armeo® Power which assists with shoulder elbow and wrist movement and diagnosis and the MyoPro, 
which is mobile but only provides elbow and gripi[INVESTIGATOR_574526]. 
1.4. Study Rationale 
Currently there are no effective mobile devices that enable people with limited upper extremity 
movement to move their upper extremities, especially for individuals with upper level SCI (C1-5). This 
Version 3.2, dated July7 , 2018 8 severely limits independence, reduces the ability for ind ividuals with this condition to complete ADL’s 
and makes them dependent on caregivers to complete all physical interactions with their environment. 
We hypothesize that the APEX device can safely enable and control shoulder-elbow movement to 
improve ADL performance and independence. Individuals with upper level cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_574527] a high potential to increase their quality of life by [CONTACT_574550].

2.0 Background * 
2.[ADDRESS_63699] several decades with notably high incidence of patellofemoral pain.1,2 A recent shift 
in the literature occurred regarding the treatment of persons with knee pain, particularly 
those diagnosed with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS), with focus being more on hip 
activation programs for treatment.[ADDRESS_63700] investigation on this topic by [CONTACT_58455]; however, two authors (DF and EM) have previously published arti cles utilizing the 
FSDT as a primary outcome measure, using the same methodology for assessment in this 
LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport  
Institutional Review Board      Protocol Template 503 (v.9-18-2023 ) 
[ADDRESS_63701] via force plates.16 Landing after jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_58448] a platform creat es a ground 
reaction force (GRF) that is equal to bodyweight times velocity, a force that is greater than 
is sustainable for the knee.17 On average, performing a drop landing task from a 0.3 -meter 
box produces a peak vertical GRF of 4.5 times the individual's body weight.[ADDRESS_63702] to determine a 
dose-response relationship.12 In this investigation, the authors aim to analyze the dose -
response predictive relationship between compliance of the intervention sessions and 
altered FSDT scores, as well as changes in transversus abdominus (TA), gluteus maximus 
(GMax) , and gluteus medius (GMed) activation via sEMG evaluation.   
Our aim is it determine if an eight -week hip musculature activation and core stabilization 
HEP influences FSDT scores, the knee abduction moment via the drop -landing task, and 
sEMG of the TA, GMax , and GMed, and to assess whether a dose -response relationship 
exists between HEP compliance and changes in these measures over time.   
As a result of the limited research, clinicians are continually challenged with best practices 
for assessing and training core stability and LE injuries.7 This study will help build on the 
limited evidence to see if a core stabilization program plus hip activation will lead to 
optimal outcomes when designing a treatment plan for LE impairments.   
3.0 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*

 3.1 Screening will be performed synchronously with the written informed consent process 
through a self -reported assessment.   
3.2 Inclusion: Participants will be current first - or second -year Doctor of Physical Therapy 
(DPT) students in the School of Allied Health Professions (SAHP) at LSU Health 
Shreveport over the age of 21.   
Exclusion: Current pain or pathology in either LE which currently limits their ability to 
perform the FSDT or drop landing task, a history of low back pain in the last three months, 
known pregnancy, as pregnancy is a risk factor for diastasis rectus abdomi nis (DRA)19 
which may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_58456] a confounding 
variable , and current participation in other clinical trials.    
3.3 Regarding the inclusion of persons at increased risk:   
• Adults unable to consent:  excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria .  
• Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers): excluded because 
this is not the target population .  
• Pregnant women: excluded due to the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_58449]19 that may be 
exacerbated by [CONTACT_25234], creating greater than minimal risk to this 
population.   
• Prisoners: excluded due to not meeting inclusion criteria .

9.0 Procedures Involved*  
9.[ADDRESS_63705] - HEP intervention. Concurrent to the functional movement 
assessment, sEMG data will be collected from the GMed, GMax, and TA, and 
kinetic/kinematic data will be collected via motion analysis. The investigator conducting 
the statistical analysis (DF) will not be involved in the randomization procedure and will be 
blinded to participant groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The participant key, which will denote group assignment 
will not be available to the PI, and group assignments will be provided to him to each 
participant number only for data analysis. Participants will be randomized into groups with 
opaque envelopes for allocation concealment as described by [CONTACT_58457].[ADDRESS_63706] an additional security method of the person who created the 
envelope signing the back so it is obvious if it has been tampered with.20 The person who 
creates the envelopes does not recruit any participants to prevent the ordering of 
participants into one treatment arm or another.20 The hip activation HEP group will receive 
a combination of hip musculature activation exercises used by [CONTACT_58458].5,21 The hip activation plus core stabilization 
HEP group will receive the same hip exercises, plus core stabilization exercises used by 
[CONTACT_58459] a reduction in the ex ternal knee adduction moment.10 In 
this design, the dependent variables are the scores on the FSDT , the peak external knee 
abduction moment  as assessed during the Drop Landing Task , and sEMG (GMax, GMed, 
and TA), all on the dominant LE, and compliance with the HEP. The independent variable 
is the performance of the eight -week HEP. Three physical therapy students will perform 
the FSDT assessments and sEMG data collection (CB, TM, RS) . Two faculty members will 
also assist with data collection (DF and EM). Pri or to data collection and assessments, the 
three students (CB, TM, RS) will be educated by [CONTACT_34351] (DF), who is a 
board -certified orthop aedic clinical specialist and licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_58450], on the FSDT protocol and on the Drop Landing Task protocol. The 
scoring guidelines of the FSDT will be reviewed and practiced prior to data collection.15 
The same methodology will be used from McCallister and Flowers11 for scoring and 
reporting of the FSDT scores. The  sEMG electrode placement will come from The ABC of 
EMG.22 The procedure for collection of the maximum volitional isometric contraction 
(MVIC) of the  GMed  will follow the protocol used in a study by [CONTACT_58460].23 The MVIC 
position of the  GMax  will follow the protocol used in a study by [CONTACT_58461], with the 
knee flexed to 90o in prone.24,25 The MVIC position of the TA will follow the protocol used 
in a study by [CONTACT_58462], at  the elbow -toe with contralateral arm and leg lift in the 
quadruped position.26 Once the participant has completed MVIC, reflected markers will be 
placed and they will perform a static then functional calibration on both LE. For the 
functional calibration, t he participant will  actively move their hip in space  (hip flexion, 45 -
degree angle anterolateral, hip abduction, 45 -degree angle posterolateral , and hip 
extension ), flex and extend the knee, and dorsifle x, plantarflex, and perform ankle circles  to 
calibrate appropriately for the dynamic task.

 9.2 Two investigators (CB, RS) will recruit the DPT class of [ADDRESS_63707] self -reported that they meet the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria. If the required number of participants is not met ( N = 34), the other investigator 
(TM) will recruit students from the DPT class of [ADDRESS_63708] -of-mouth about the 
investigation and obtain informed consent until the required number of participants are 
enrolled. After enrollment, each participant wil l sign up for a time to attend an initial da ta 
collection session in the Rehabilitation Faculty Clinic and the Motion Analysis Laboratory 
(Rm 2 -217), both located in the SAHP at LSUHS. A randomization sequence will be 
created using Microsoft Excel by [CONTACT_58463] 17 entries for each group and using the  
functions to sort by [CONTACT_58464]. The sequence will be printed on paper inserts. The 
inserts will be placed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes and sealed by [CONTACT_58465], who 
will then sign on the back of the envelope over the seam. Participants will meet i n the 
Rehabilitation Faculty Clinic and age, sex, height, weight, BMI, and dominant LE will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_58466]. The dominant LE is defined as the leg that they usually use to kick 
a soccer ball.11 Participants will take the elevator to the second floor and report to 2 -217 for 
sEMG, FSDT, and Drop Landing Task force plate data collection. Additional 
anthropometrics consisting of leg length, knee width, and ankle width will be obtained for 
accurate motion capture. Then , sEMG electrodes (“Self -adhesive Ag /AgCl Dual 
Electrodes” by [CONTACT_58467]) will be applied to the GMax, GMed, and TA of the side of the 
dominant leg, following the placement criteria from The ABC of EMG by [CONTACT_46107] (for female 
participants) or DF (for male participants) and an MVIC for each muscle wil l be performed 
and recorded, with resistance by [CONTACT_58468].22,24,25 Motion capture m arkers will be placed on 
participants by a single student investigator  at the following locations  bilaterally : ASIS, 
PSIS, lateral epi[INVESTIGATOR_58451] , lateral thigh, lateral sh ank, lateral malleolus, 
calcaneus, and head of the second metatarsal . Plug-in-Gait (PiG) static calibration and 
functional calibration for the knee joint will be performed before performing outcome 
measures.  Participants will be instructed on the procedure for the FSDT by [CONTACT_58469]. The FSDT consists of five consecutive repetitions of a forward step 
down from a 20 cm step, with one score given for the whole set of five repetitions.15 Two 
student investigators (TM, RS) will score via a score sheet and average the number 
between the scores.[ADDRESS_63709]      Protocol Template 503 (v.9-18-2023 )

An informed consent document with participant identification numbers will be used to 
obtain consent from the participants. A participant identification number key will be made 
to match the participant's name [CONTACT_58473]. A sign 
up for the anthropometric data collection and pre - and post -HEP sEMG and FSDT data 
collection will be created, allowing the participants to sign up with their identification 
number. A Microsoft Excel sheet (shared among the investigators on SharePoint and 
password protected) to collect data will be used by [CONTACT_473]. A compliance chart 
for the participants to track their exercise sessions will be created. A paper copy of the HEP 
will be given to the participants.  All har dcopy informed consents and grading sheets will be 
maintained in the PI’s office (SAHP Rm 2 -234) in a locked cabinet.

11.0 Data Management  and Confidentiality * 
11.1 Descriptive statistics will be provided for the demographic data to compare age, sex, 
height, weight, BMI, dominant LE, and MVIC of the TA, GMax, and GMed.   
FSDT    
The FSDT data will be analyzed using a 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA to evaluate for between - 
and within -group differences.  
sEMG    
Data processing: Raw sEMG signals will be bandpass filtered between 10 -500 Hz. The 
signal will be rectified, then smoothed using the Root Mean Square method with a 50ms 
window. The signal will be normalized to the MVIC obtained during the MVIC testing.    
Data analysis: Following MVIC normalization, the mean EMG activation and peak EMG 
activation for each trial will be recorded. Each step -down repetition will be analyzed as a 
separate trial, and an average taken of all [ADDRESS_63713] for all three Drop Landing Task trials. 
The mean data for each sEMG data point will be analyzed via a 2  x 2 mixed ANOVA for 
each outcome variable.   
Drop Landing Task force plate : Data processing:  Motion capture data will be processed in 
Vicon’s Nexus2 software using the PiG model. Gaps will be filled using the appr opriate 
gap fill strategy. External knee abduction moment will be extracted from the kinetic data.  
Data analysis: A 2 x 2 mixed ANOVA will be used to evaluate for between - and within -
group differences on the peak knee abduction moment during the Drop Landing Task.    
Regression analysis : Regression analyses will be performed to determine whether a dose -
response analysis exists between the HEP compliance and the dependent variables.  
11.2 G*power (Heinrich -Heine -University Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, [LOCATION_013]) software was used 
to perform an a priori power analysis to determine the required N for this investigation. 
Data was obtained from McCallister and Flowers (2020),[ADDRESS_63714] -exertion change on the FSDT 
(r = .27). Pearson’s coefficient was converted to Cohen's d (d = .56). An N of 28 was 
calculated to achieve significant results, with beta = .80 and alpha = .05 for  a two -tailed 
hypothesis from a 2  x 2 mixed ANOVA analysis. We assumed an attrition rate of 20% 
given the repeated -measures design of the investigation. Therefore, a final N of 34 will be 
recruited for the successful completion of this study.   
11.3 See 9.4.  
11.4 The student investigators (TM, RS, and CB) will be educated on the proper procedures of 
the FSDT, Drop Landing Task, sEMG data collection, force plate data collection, and the 
HEP by [CONTACT_34351] (DF) and co -investigator (EM). The FSDT will be 
analyzed and scored by [CONTACT_58470] (TM and  RS). TM and RS will record and 
average their scores following the completion of five repetitions to improve the quality of

 the data.11 The sEMG electrodes will be placed on the female participants by [CONTACT_58471]. RS will provide the pressure for the MVIC and explain the 
FSDT procedure to every participant. TM will explain the drop landing task procedure to 
every  participant. CB will draw the next sequentially numbered envelope and escort the 
participant to another room to open the envelope, explain the HEP, and explain the 
compliance chart to the participant. The primary investigator (DF) is a board -certified 
orthopedic physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_58452] [ADDRESS_63715].11 The co -investigator (EM) is also a board -certified orthopedic physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_58453] [ADDRESS_63716] with the primary 
investigator.11  
11.5 The data that will be collected during the entire study includes: participant number, age, 
height, weight, BMI, sex, MVIC of GMax, GMed, and TA, leg dominance, FSDT pre and 
post HEP, recorded FSDT video, sEMG from GMed, GMax, and TA on the side of the 
domi nant leg during FSDT pre and post HEP, peak external knee abduction moment during 
the Drop Landing Task pre and post HEP, recorded Drop Landing Task video, and 
compliance. Data storage will follow the guidelines in section 9.4. The data will be stored 
for the duration of the study and throughout the followin g semester while analyzing and 
finalizing data for presentation. The data will be kept up to one year after the completion of 
the data analysis in the event that the research wants to be continued. The only people to 
have access to this information will be  the primary investigator, the co -investigator, and 
student investigators (DF, EM, CB, TM, RS). All investigators are responsible for the 
receipt and transmission of the data. Data will be manually transported to DF office room 
2-234 in the SAHP at LSUHS. Electronic data will remain on SharePoint.

13.2 If the participant notifies any investigator that they do not wish to participate any longer or 
if they no longer meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the investigators will notify the 
participant that they have been withdrawn from the study and document the re ason for the 
withdrawal and date. The participant will provide the returned compliance sheet to the 
investigators.

14.0 Risks to Subjects*  
14.1 Risks associated with this study include:  
• Physical risks: muscle soreness is a potential side effect that may occur with exercise. 
This will be minimized via the progression principles previously outlined in section 
9.4. This is likely to happen but will be minimized via progression principles that will be 
taught to you at the first study visit. The magnitude of this risk is minor. Another risk is 
skin irritation and/or a rash from wearing or removing the electrode patches that stick to the 
skin for sEMG and for 3D Motion Capture markers. If participants  become pregnant during 
the study, they should tell the study investigators. They  may be removed from the study

12 
 due to risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_58454]. It is not 
expected that the baby’s health or mother’s health will need to be followed.  
• Privacy/confidentiality risks: participants’  personal information could be lost or exposed. 
This is very unlikely to happen, and all hardcopy data will be locked in the PI ’s office. 
Digital data is password protected. Given the nature of the personal information collected, 
the magnitude of this risk is minor.  
• Modesty: participants’  buttocks will be exposed for the placement of the electrode 
stickers. An investigator  of each participants’  same sex will drape them  to minimize 
exposure and will place the electrode stickers on their buttocks.

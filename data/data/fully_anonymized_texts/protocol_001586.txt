1. Introduction and Purpose:  
It is standard practice in the [LOCATION_002] and many parts of world to perform G astrointestina l (GI)  
endoscopy with the patient under deep sedation ( 1). Obesity is accepted as a patient specific risk factor 
for hypoxic events during procedural sedation for GI endoscopic procedures. The Obese population 
has a higher prevalence of obstructive sleep a pnea (OSA) which is characterized by [CONTACT_725464] , and leads to apnea and desaturation . This prospective, randomized 
study was designed to compare the effectiveness of the high flow nasal cannula and the standard nasal 
cannula i n morbidly obese (BMI > 40) patients receiving deep intravenous sedation during 
colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This study will assess whether use of the high flow nasal cannula  (HFNC) leads to less 
intraoperative desaturation events  compared to the current standard of car e. 
 
Hypothesis [ADDRESS_990248] significantly lower incidence of desaturation  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(SpO2 <90) than the standard nasal cannula group during procedural sedation for colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Primary objective: To compare the frequency of  desaturation ep isodes during procedural sedation in 
obese patients undergoing colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Hypothesis [ADDRESS_990249] nasal cannula group during procedural sedation for colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
Secon dary objective 1: To compare the number of interventions made by [CONTACT_725465][INVESTIGATOR_014].   
 
Hypothesis 3 - Use of HFNC would decrease s edation -related adver se events  in obese subjects  with 
OSA .  
 
Secondary objective 2:  To determine the frequency  of desaturation epi[INVESTIGATOR_725451] . 
  
2. Background:  
The prevalence of morbid obesity is increasing worldwide. As the severity of obesity increases, the 
incidence of diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea also rises.   Studies have shown an incidence of sleep 
apnea as high as 64% in patients with a body mass index ( BMI ) over 40 and 100% in patients with a 
BMI greater than 60 (2).  Patients with OSA have been shown to have significant desaturations under 
intravenous sedation due to airway narrowing and obstruction. Several studies have also shown that 
morbidly obese  subjects , independent of a diagnosis of OSA, run a higher p erioperative risk of adverse 
Page [ADDRESS_990250] events, including hypoxia . Quadeer et al found a 51% overall incidence of desaturation below 
90% i n a prospective observational study with 79 patients undergoing endoscopy under “conscious 
sedation .” They also found a si gnificant difference in the frequency of desaturation events between 
obese (BMI > 30) and non -obese patients (3). Many morbidly obese  subjects  present to our institution 
for GI procedures under deep sedation.  Providing anesthesia for this patient populati on is challenging 
and requires careful titration of drugs and superb  airway management skills.   
 
The current standard of care for oxygen delivery in this setting is a Salter nasal cannula.  There are no 
prospective, randomized studies that compare the use  of a high flow humidified nasal cannula system 
and standard nasal cannula  in morbidly obese patients presenting for colonoscopy under anesthesia.  
Patel et al have been working with a transnasal high flow device (THRIVE) and have shown it to 
increase apne a times in patients with difficult airways post induction of general anesthesia  (4). These 
patients received neuromuscular blockade and made no respi[INVESTIGATOR_21266], however, the patency of their 
airway was maintained with a manual jaw thrust by [CONTACT_16826]. They concluded that the 
device combines the benefits of apneic oxygenation with continuous positive airway pressure and 
gaseous exchange occurs through flow -dependent dead  space flushing ( 5). 
 
Humidified high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen ther apy utilizes an air oxygen blend allowing 
from 21% to 100% FiO2 delivery and generates up to 60  L/min flow rates ( 6,7). The gas is heated (35 
to 40 degree Celsius)  and humidified through an active heated humidifier and delivered via a single 
limb heated in spi[INVESTIGATOR_725452] (to avoid heat loss and condensation) to the subject through a large 
diameter nasal cannula ( 8, 9). Theoretically, HFNC offers significant advantages in oxygenation and 
ventilation over conventional methods ( 9). Constant high flow oxygen delivery provides steady 
inspi[INVESTIGATOR_725453] (FiO2 ) and decreases oxygen dilution ( 10). It also washes out physiologic 
dead space and generates positive end expi[INVESTIGATOR_725454] (PEEP) that augments ventilation (10, 11 ). 
In the current narrative review , Sotello et al. summarized factors explained the improvement in 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_725455]  (12).  (1) Washout of the nasopharyngeal dead space; (2) 
Reduction in inspi[INVESTIGATOR_725456]; (3) 
Improve ment in respi[INVESTIGATOR_725457]; (4) Reduction in metabolic work associated with gas conditioning; (5) Provision of 
mild distending pressure.  
 
Some studies have demonstrated a positive e ffect of HFNC on the apnea -hypopnea index  (AHI)  
showing  that use of HFNC could decrease hypoxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_725458].  The STOP -BANG questionnaire (SB) has been used 
successfully to s creen patients undergoing therapeutic endoscopic procedures at higher risk for 
sedation -related adverse events  (14). Mehta et al (1 5) evaluated the prevalence of undiagnosed OSA at 
their endoscopy center and the relationship between a positive SB result an d sedation -related adverse 
events. They found that  48.5% (118/243) of patients were SB+ and exhibited a higher level of 
potentially adverse medical conditions, with 66.3% (161/243) being classified with an SB score of 3.   
 
We are hypothesizing that the  HFN C will help maintain a patent airway and improve gaseous 
exchange in the morbidly obese patients undergoing deep sedation for colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_725459] 
a significant decrease in intraoperative desaturation events, thus improving morbidity and overal l 
safety for this subgroup.  
 
3. Concise Summary of Project:  The study population for this randomized prospective clinical trial 
will consist of male and female subjects , between the ages of 18 -80, with a BMI over 40 undergoing 
colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_725466] 4 of 8 
 the study. OSA screening questionnaire (Stop Bang ) will be completed during review of the patient’s 
history and physical exam  and subjects will be stratified based on STOPBANG score of  ≥5 versus ≤4. 
Subjects will then be randomized  in a stratified fashion  to either the HFNC ( Comfort Flo  System ) 
group or the Salter cannula group.  Then subjects  will be brought into the procedure room and placed 
on all standard ASA monitors (BP cuff, EKG, pulse oximetry ).  In the  HFNC group, the nasal cannula 
will be placed on the patient at a setting of FiO 2 36% and up to 60L/min depending  on patient 
tolerance .  60 L /min is the max flow rate and will be used as tolerated for maximum benefit. The 
HFNC setti ng will start  at 40 L/min and will be titrated up to the max flow rate of 60 L /min depending  
on subjects’  tolerance .  
 
Research intervention:  The Comfort Flo system ( Teleflex Medical, Research Triangle Park, NC, 
[LOCATION_003]) will be used for high flow nasal cannul a during colonoscopy.  The Comfort Flo System  has an 
air-O2 blender setting and a FiO 2 analyzer to confirm FiO 2 delivered to the patient.  This FiO2 has 
been shown to be equal to the FiO2 measured using the Salter cannula at 4L/min  (13).    
 
Control group : A Salter nasal cannula will be used at 4L/ minute  during the colonoscopy .   
 
The cannulas will be placed on the patients 5 minutes prior to the start of the anesthetic.  
 
All patients will receive a similar intravenous anesthetic with a propofol infusion t itrated to a 
Richmond Agitation -Sedation Scale ( RASS ) score of [ADDRESS_990251] and is available for 
review. The duration and frequency of all measurements at or below 90% will be recorded by [CONTACT_725467] (E MR). The anesthesia providers will be instructed to intervene only when 
the patient’s saturation falls below 90%, by [CONTACT_725468] a jaw thrust, placing a nasal or 
oral airway, bag mask ventilation, increasing the patients FiO2 or decreasing the rate/ pausing the 
propofol infusion or endotracheal intubation.  They w ill be instructed to write a quick note at the time 
of intervention in the EMR describing their maneuver.  Duration of the study will be the length of the 
procedure through discharge from the Postoperative Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).  
 
Our hypothesis is tha t the patients in the high flow nasal cannula group will experience a marked 
reduction in intraoperative desaturation events as compared to the Salter cannula group.

9. Recruitment Methods and Consenting Process:  
All patient recruitment will take place in the GI endoscopy suite. Subject will be identified by 
[CONTACT_725470] e. A designated team of anesthesiologists and nurse anesthetists 
involved in the study will be responsible for screening, consenting and enrolling potential subjects. The 
patient’s chart will be reviewed to determine eligibility with the use of a HIPAA wai ver form. 
Information about the study will be given in a pressure -free, confidential private area in a face -to-face 
meeting  and the voluntary nature of the research will be emphasized to the subjects.  
 
The purpose of the study and risks and potential compl ications of the study will be explained. 
Adequate time will be given to read consent form to consider whether or not participate in the study. 
All questions will be answered before the patient is asked to sign the consent form. If the patient agrees 
to participate, then he or she will sign the consent form and HIPAA Authorization Form prior to any 
study procedures.  
 
10. Potential Risks:  
This study has minimal risk.  The anesthetic management in either group will not differ from the 
current standard of care.   
 
Risk for HFNC : 
There may be minimal risk for mucosal injury with HFNC. This risk  is not higher than standard nasal 
cannula because HFNC systems deliver heated, humidified gas.  
  
HFNC may produce distending pressure in the lung, similar to CPAP pressures . There may be 
potentially unpredict able pressures generated by [CONTACT_725471] . Mild distending pressure may provide better patent airway in obese subjects. 
Flow rate of HFNC will be adjusted for m aximum benefit to the subject  (40-60 L/minutes) . 
 
Psychological Stress:  Some of the questions related to the study may make the subject feel 
uncomfortable.  Subjects may refuse to answer any of the questions, or take a break or stop 
participation in the st udy at any time.  
 
Loss of Confidentiality : Any time information is collected; there is a potential risk of loss of 
confidentiality.  Every effort will be made to keep your information confidential.  
 
11. Subject Safety and Data Monitoring:  
Investigators wil l ensure patient safety throughout the procedure. This will include following all 
standards of care with regard to conducting a safe anesthetic in the endoscopy suite.  All standard ASA 
monitors will be used, adequate O2 delivery will be ensured and the pr oper interventions by [CONTACT_725472][INVESTIGATOR_1841].  Subjects will recover from the 
anesthetic in the endoscopy suite recovery room.  All data will be collected by [CONTACT_725473] 
(EPIC).  
 
12. Procedures t o Maintain Confidentiality:  
All participants will be given an identification number such that identifiable, personal information will 
not be used.  Every effort will be made to keep all data collection sheets confidential and any 
electronic data sets will be password protected and secure. Electronic documents will be de -identified 
according to information security policies. Paper documents will be shredded.

13. Potential Benefits:  
There is no benefit to subjects.  Use of the Comfort Flo high flow nasal cann ula may lead to a 
significant decrease in hypoxic events in morbidly obese, likely sleep apneic, patients undergoing deep 
sedation for colonoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Information gained from this study will increase patient safety and 
decrease the morbidity and possibly, m ortality, in this challenging patient population.  
 
 14. Biostatistics:  
The study is powered to detect a 50% reduction in the frequency of desaturation epi[INVESTIGATOR_725462] a standard nasal cannula.  Quadeer et al . (3) reported a 51% 
incidence rate for desaturation epi[INVESTIGATOR_27973] 90% in patients with standard nasal cannula.  Thus to 
detect a difference of 25% with 80% power and a type 1 error rate of 0.05, the study would need a 
sample of 59 per group (total n = 118).  Assuming a 10% lo ss of subjects, the total sample size to be 
enrolled is 130 . An interim analysis will be performed at 50% of the enrolment.  Based on the interim 
analysis results, study may be stopped  for futility  if there is no difference in interim analy sis or for 
early termination for effectiveness if the observed difference at the time is large enough . Obrien -
Flemming α -spending function approach would be used to develop acceptance or rejection boundaries.   
Continuous data will be summarized using mean s and standard deviations and categorical data will be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages.  The proportions of desaturation epi[INVESTIGATOR_27973] 90% 
in the two groups will be compared using a Z test or Fisher’s exact test.  Mean durations of 
desaturati on epi[INVESTIGATOR_725463]’s t -tests or Wilcoxon -Mann -Whitney tests.  Frequencies of sedation -related 
adverse events will be compared using chi -square tests or Fish er’s exact tests.  Normality of the sample 
data will be assed using normal quantile plots. Level of significance will be set at 0.05 and Bonferroni 
corrections will be made for all primary hypotheses tests.

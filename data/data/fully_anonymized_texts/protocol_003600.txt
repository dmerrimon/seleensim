Study Design This is a companion imaging trial for patients who are eligible for 
the treatment trial entitled “A randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo 
controlled, multi-center study to assess the effect of ranolazine on 
outcomes in subjects with pul monary hypertension and right 
ventricular dysfunction accompan ied by a comparative study of 
cellular metabolism in subjects with pulmonary hypertension with 
and without right ventricular dysfunction”.  
 
Patients will be identified and scr eened to participate in the 
treatment tr ial entitled “A randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled, multi-center study to assess the effect of ranolazine on 
outcomes in subjects with pul monary hypertension and right 
ventricular dysfunction accompan ied by a comparative study of 
cellular metabolism in subjects with pulmonary hypertension with 
and without right ventricular dysfunction” . Subjects that meet 
eligibility will be asked to cons ent separately for this imaging 
companion trial involving PET/CT imaging with the investigational 
radiotracers [11C]Acetate and [18F]FDG and Cardiovascular MRI 
(CMR). 
All patients will undergo a baseline cardiac PET/CT scan. The 
PET/CT imaging session will inclu de injection of 15-25 mCi of 
11C-acetate followed by a 30 minute dynamic scan. After 
administration of oral gluc ose patients will undergo subsequent 
injection of 10 mCi of 18F-FDG with one hour wait followed by a 
15 minute scan. Some patient s will undergo a baseline CMR 
scan if they haven’t clinically. Some patients will undergo a second cardiac PET/CT scan and CMR scan at 26±2 weeks after the start of their treatment, dependi ng on the treatment group to 
which they are assigned.  
11C-acetate may not be available fo r some subjects due to tracer 
production associated techni cal difficulties. If 11C-acetate is 
unavailable it will be at the discretion of an investigator to omit the 
11C-acetate portion of the PET/CT scanning procedure and 
proceed with the FDG portion of the imaging only.  Although 11C-
acetate use is preferred, the inve stigator decision to omit it will be 
documented and any PET/CT scan done without it will not be considered a protocol deviation. 
Study Duration 2.5 years  
Study Center(s) This imaging trial will be conduc ted at the University of 
Pennsylvania.  The companion treatment trial will  be completed at 3 sites:

1 Introduction 
This document is a protocol for a human res earch study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US and international standards of  Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 
312 and International Confer ence on Harmonization guide lines), applicable government 
regulations and Institutional re search policies and procedures.  
1.[ADDRESS_93045] transition 
from compensated hypertrophy to dilatation and failure in the RV remain enigmatic. 
Much of our understanding is based on cell cult ure and animal models or is extrapolated 
from data of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.  Reflected by [INVESTIGATOR_1312]-expression of fetal-type 
contractile proteins, angiogenic rarefacti on, and alterations in calcium handling, 
numerous molecular signaling pathways are t hought to be activated in RV dysfunction, 
leading to increased levels of reactive  oxygen (ROS) or nitrogen (RNS) species, 
inflammation, RV ischemia, cardiomyocyt e apoptosis, and decreased contractility, as 
recently reviewed1. However, further mechanistic insi ght into the progression of RV 
dysfunction has been hampered by [CONTACT_85377] y to obtain RV specimens in sufficient 
quantity for molecular analysis from subjects  with progressive PAH and RV failure. 
Moreover, substantial differences exis t among animal models of PAH and human PAH2, 
making animal-derived insights suboptimal  and sometimes misleading regarding PAH 
and RV dysfunction in human subject populati ons. Thus, the development of targeted 
therapeutics in RV failure has been slow.  More recently, animal modeling of RVH and RV failure in PAH has revealed a 
substantial down-regulation of mitochondrial ox idative metabolism in favor of glycolysis 
(GL). The molecular mechanisms controlling th is metabolic shift in the RV are unclear
3, 
but, in part, may involve alterations of potassium channel function4-6. Importantly, in 
rodents with experimental PAH7, 8 or chronic RV overload9, RVH, RV electrical 
remodeling, and RV dysfunction can be normalized with dichloroacetate (DCA), an 
inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (P DK) which in turn activates pyruvate 
dehydrogenase (PDH) to favor oxidative me tabolism. These findings suggest that 
alterations in mitochondrial function, met abolism, and energy subs trate utilization are 
keys to understanding the progression to RV failure. Observational human data through 
PET corroborate these findings by [CONTACT_85378]-
dependent RV dysfunction10, 11. Yet, a true causative mechanism of metabolic 
dysregulation for RV dysfunc tion in human PAH has not been established. Furthermore, 
data are sparse regarding the efficacy and safety profile of DCA in humans, and it is 
currently not an FDA-approved m edication. Alternatively, ranolazine, which is currently 
used for refractory myocardial ischemia12, 13, also activates PDH14-[ADDRESS_93046] substantia l therapeutic potential in RV 
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH

dysfunction and PAH, and coul d be readily “re-purposed” as  an already FDA-approved 
medication.  
 Historically, RV failure had been described as  a stereotyped response to hemodynamic 
overload. More recent large patient cohort data suggests t hat RV, independently from 
PAP, predicts mortality
18. Thus, a recent hypothesis sugges ts that individual genetic 
differences dysregulate cardiomyocyte func tion and, in doing so, predispose to RV 
failure in humans, control patient-specific manifestations of di sease, and thus would 
represent key diagnostic marker s and therapeutic targets. In fact, multiple key metabolic 
regulatory factors have been fou nd to be altered in RV fail ure, any one of which could 
contribute to individual predisposition to RV  failure. Based on their established functions 
in left ventricular injury and metabolism19 and known alterations in right ventricular 
failure20, we propose to evaluate metabolic d ysfunction of the RV using positron 
emission topography (PET) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).  
 
1.2 Investigational Agent 
1.2.1 11C-acetate 
[IP_ADDRESS] Description 
11C-acetate is prepared by [CONTACT_85379] a Grignard reagent, CH 3MgBr or CH 3MgCl, 
with cyclotron-produced 11C-carbon dioxide, followed by [CONTACT_85380] ﬁcation. This 
method produces 11C-acetate in a radiochemic al yield of 72 ± 12% in  20 min and in high 
specific activity (>18.5 GBq/µmol, 0.5 Ci/µmol). The radiochemical purity of  11C-acetate 
was found to be > 95%21. 11C-acetate has a molecular we ight of 59.05 g/mol and a 
molecular formula of C2H4O2. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action 
11C-acetate is used as a positron emissi on tomography (PET) tracer for studying 
myocardial oxidative metabolism and regional myocardial blood flow22. Upon delivery 
and uptake to myocardium cells, 11C-acetate is activated to 11C-Acetyl-CoA in the 
mitochondria where it enters the Krebs cycle and is converted into 11CO 2 and water via 
oxidative phosphorylation. Serial imagi ng following the IV administration of 11C-acetate 
demonstrates the passage of the radioacti ve bolus through the cardiac chambers, 
followed by [CONTACT_85381], and finally clearance of radiotracer from myocardial 
tissue reflecting the rate of oxidative metabolism (K mono) 23,24. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
11C-acetate  is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_85352] 2 and water after 
intravenous injection. The uptake is indirectly dependent on blood flow25. Human

dosimetry was estimated in six healthy vo lunteers by [CONTACT_85382] 525 MBq 
(14.2 mCi) of 11C-acetate26. The organs receiving the highest absorbed doses were the 
pancreas (0.017 mGy/MBq or 62.9 mrad/m Ci), bowel (0.011 mGy/MBq or 40.7 
mrad/mCi), kidneys (0.0092 mGy/MBq or 34.0 mrad/mCi), and spleen (0.0092 
mGy/MBq or 34.0 mrad/mCi). No urinary excretion of tracer was detected. The effective 
dose equivalent was 0.0062 mS v/MBq (22.9 mrem/mCi).

[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism and Excretion 
Upon delivery and uptake to myocardium cells, 11C-acetate is activated to 11C-Acetyl-
CoA in the mitochondria wh ere it enters the Krebs cycle and is converted into 11CO [ADDRESS_93048] oxidative 
metabolism27.  
1.2.2 18F-FDG 
[IP_ADDRESS] Description 
 [18F]Fluoro-2-deoxy-2-D-glucose has a mole cular weight of 181.15 g/mol and a 
molecular formula of C6H11FO 5 and the following structural formula:   
 
18F-FDG is used for diagnostic purposes in  conjunction with Positron Emission 
Tomography (PET).  It  is administered by [CONTACT_439]. 
 

11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH

Version4  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Mechanism of Action 
FDG is moved into cells by [CONTACT_85383]-6- phosphate. The 2' hydroxyl grou p (—OH) in normal glucose is needed for 
further glycolysis (metabolism of glucose by [CONTACT_85384]), but 18F-FDG is missing this 2' 
hydroxyl. Thus, FDG-6- phos phate cannot be metabolized further in the glycolytic 
pathway and stays intracellularly in the cells. The elevated rates of glycolysis and 
glucose transport in many types of tumor cells and activated cells enhance the uptake 
of FDG in these cells relative to other no rmal cells. Positron emission tomography (PET) 
with 18F-FDG has been used to assess alternations in glucose metabolism in brain, 
cancer, cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer’ s disease and other ce ntral nervous system 
disorders, and infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases28-30.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pharmacokinetics 
18F-FDG, as a glucose analog, is taken up by [CONTACT_5019]-glucose-using cells such as brain, 
kidney, and cancer cells, where phosphoryla tion prevents the glucose from being 
released again from the cell, once it has been absorbed. About 75% of the fluorine-18 
activity remains in tissues and is elimi nated with a half-life of 110 minutes.  Another 
fraction of 18F-FDG, representing about 20%  of the total fluorine- 18 activity of an 
injection, is eliminated rena lly by [CONTACT_85385] a dose of 18F-FDG, with a rapid half-life 
of about 16 minutes. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Absorption and Distribution 
18F-FDG, as a glucose analog, is taken up by [CONTACT_5019]-glucose-using cells such as brain, 
kidney, and cancer cells, where phosphoryla tion prevents the glucose from being 
released again from the cell, once it has  been absorbed. The 2' hydroxyl group (—OH) 
in normal glucose is needed for further glycolysi s (metabolism of glucose by [CONTACT_85384]), 
but 18F-FDG is missing this 2' hydroxyl. Thus , in common with its sister molecule 2-
deoxy-D-glucose, FDG cannot be further metabolized in cells. The 18F-FDG-6-
phosphate formed when 18F-FDG enters the cell thus cannot  move out of the cell before 
radioactive decay. As a result, the distribution of18F-FDG is a good reflection of the 
distribution of glucose uptake and phos phorylation by [CONTACT_85386]. 
 
After 18F-FDG decays radioactively, however, its 2'-fluorine is converted to 18O–, and 
after pi[INVESTIGATOR_85354] a proton H+ from a hydronium ion in its aqueous environment, the 
molecule becomes glucose-6-phosphate la beled with harmless nonradioactive "heavy 
oxygen" in the hydroxyl at t he 2' position. The new presence of a 2' hydroxyl now allows 
it to be metabolized normally  in the same way as ordi nary glucose, producing non-
radioactive end-products.  Although in theory all 18F-FDG is metabolized as above with a 
radioactivity elimination half-lif e of 110 minutes (the same as t hat of fluorine-18), clinical 
studies have shown that the radioactivity of 18F-FDG partitions into two major fractions. 
About 75% of the fluorine-[ADDRESS_93049] to O-18 to form 18O-glucose-6-

Version4  
 
phosphate, which is non-radioactive (this mole cule can soon be metabolized to carbon 
dioxide and water, after nucl ear transmutation of the fluor ine to oxygen ceases to 
prevent metabolism). Another fraction of 18F-FDG, representing about 20% of the total 
fluorine-18 activity of an injection, is elim inated renally by [CONTACT_85385] a dose of 18F-
FDG, with a rapid half-life of about 16 minute s (this portion makes the renal-collecting 
system and bladder prominent in  a normal PET scan). This short biological half-life 
indicates that this 20% portion of the tota l fluorine-18 tracer ac tivity is eliminated 
pharmacokinetically (through the renal syste m) much more quickly than the isotope 
itself can decay. The rapi[INVESTIGATOR_85355] 18F is no longer attached to 
glucose, since low concentra tions of glucose in the blood are retained by [CONTACT_85387] t he urine. Because of this  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_85356] 18F, the 
urine of a patient undergoing a PET scan may therefor e be especially radioactive for 
several hours after adminis tration of the isotope. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Metabolism and Excretion 
All radioactivity of 18F-FDG, both the 20% which is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_2478] y excreted in the first several 
hours of urine which is made after the exam, and the 80% which remains in the patient, 
decays with a half-life of 110 minutes (just under 2 hours). Thus, within 24 hours (13 
half-lives after the injection), the radioactivity in the patient  and in any initially voided 
urine which may have contaminated bedding or  objects after the PET exam, will have 
decayed to 2−13 = 1/[ADDRESS_93050] 
12 hours (7 half-lives, or decay to 1/128th the initial radioactive dose). 
 
1.3 Preclinical Data 
1.3.1 11C-acetate 
 
11C-acetate has been used to study myocar dial oxygen consumption rate (MVO 2) with 
the metabolic fate of the tracer in normoxic, hypoxic, and ischemic conditions in isolated 
perfused rat hearts. Model-estimated MVO [ADDRESS_93051] rongly with the myocardial clearance 
rate determined from the tissue kinetics31. 
 
In a rat model of an occluded, acute left anterior descending (LAD) coronary 
artery, 60Cu-ATSM was used to visualize hypoxic rat heart tissue using an ex vivo  tissue 
slice imaging technique31. In addition, 11C-acetate was used to monitor myocardial 
blood flow. Low 11C-acetate uptake (low blood flow) and high 60Cu-ATSM uptake 
(hypoxia) were observed in mildly ischemic r egions. In the center of severely ischemic 
regions with no blood flow, little accumulation of 11C or 60Cu radioactivity was observed. 
 
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH      
 Page 13  
Version4  
 
The use of 11C-acetate for determinati on of myocardial oxidat ive consumption has been 
well validated in a number of animal studies32. Acetate clearance showed a close 
correlation with myocardial oxygen consumpt ion when measured in dogs under different 
disease states (normal, ischem ia, and increased workload).   
11C-acetate PET was used to study cardiac output in a pig model33. The tracer uptake in 
the right and left heart cavities was measured as  well as in the lung.  Myocardial output 
measured by 11C-acetate PET was linearly related to cardiac output by [CONTACT_70964]. 
Lung uptake of 11C-acetate was also linearly related to stroke volume. 
1.3.2 18F-FDG 
18F-FDG was accumulated rapi[INVESTIGATOR_85357],  liver, lung, and small intestine of normal 
mice, followed by a rapid clearance34. On the other hand, the accu mulation of the tracer 
in the brain and heart remained relatively co nstant during the 2 h of the experiment. 18F-
FDG was tested as a tumor diagnostic ag ent in a transplantable rat tumor35. Tissue 
distribution studies in rats  showed high uptakes of 18F-FDG in the tumor, heart, 
intestine, and brain. Tumor uptake reached 2.65% dose 18F-FDG/g at 60 min and 
remained relatively constant until 120 min. Blood clearance 18F-FDG was very rapid, 
and tumor/blood ratios reached 22.1 at 60 min. Tumor/tissue ratios were very high in 
most organs, especially in the liver, kidneys, and pancreas.  
 
1.4 Clinical Data to Date 
1.4.1 11C–acetate 
Myocardial oxygen consumpt ion can be estimated with PE T from analysis of the 
myocardial turnover rate constant ( k) after administration of 11C-acetate. 11C-acetate 
was administered to five norma l volunteers and six patients wi th myocardial infarction. 
Uptake of 11C-acetate by [CONTACT_85388], and its clearance from the blood 
pool was rapid, yielding myocardial images of excellent  quality. Regional k was 
homogeneous in the myocardiums of h ealthy volunteers. In patients, k in regions 
remote from the area of infarction was not di fferent from values in the myocardiums of 
healthy human volunteers. In contrast, k in the center of the in farct region of necrotic 
myocardium was significantly reduced36. 
 
In humans, 11C-acetate has been used in coronary disease to determine metabolic 
reserve and in cardiomyopathy to study ch anges in oxygen cons umption with cardiac 
resynchronization therapy37.11C-acetate has also been used in heart failure patients to 
determine the effects of sleep apnea, sele ctive beta1-blockade, or exercise on 
myocardial oxygen consum ption and energy efficiency38-44. There have been no noted 
pharmacologic or hemodynamic side effects of 11C-acetate in multiple studies32, 37-40, 42, 
44-52.   11C-acetate has also been used in a few studies on RV metabolism53, 54 in the 
research setting, but not in subjects  with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
  
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH      
 Page [ADDRESS_93052] een, heart, and brain. Mejia et al.58 estimated the 
effective dose equivalent to be 0.024 mSv/MBq (81 mrem/mCi). 18F-FDG PET imaging 
techniques are widely used in clinical applicat ions. In central nervous system disorders, 
the clinical applicatio ns are in Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], brain trauma, 
Huntington disease, cerebrovascular disord ers, brain tumors, schizophrenia, and mood 
disorders. In oncology, the clinical applicat ions are in diagnosis, treatment monitoring, 
and tumor staging and have been used in non- small cell lung cancer, colorectal 
carcinoma, malignant melanoma, Hodgk in and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, esophageal 
carcinoma, head and neck cancer, breas t cancer, and thyroid carcinoma. In 
cardiovascular disorders, t he clinical applications are in myocardial viability and 
atherosclerosis59. In infectious and inflammatory dise ases, the clinical applications are 
in orthopedic infections, ost eomyelitis, ileitis, sarcoidosi s, rheumatologic disease, and 
vasculitis.  
 FDG has been studied in PAH and was found to be increased in PAH
60, 61, but the 
studies did not differentiate between near no rmal RV and failing RV  patients. Rather, 
Oikawa et al60demonstrated that treating PAH patie nts with epoprostenol decreased RV 
FDG uptake. Bokhari et al61 demonstrated that RV uptake co rrelated with PA pressures. 
 
1.5 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
1.5.[ADDRESS_93053]. The 
radiation exposure from a single injection of 11C-acetate is equival ent to the amount 
received from background radiation in the US . There are no reported adverse reactions 
from the administration of  radiolabeled acetate. 
 
1.5.2 18F-FDG 
18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is FDA appr oved for cardiac PET imaging and well 
tolerated by [CONTACT_1962]. We will use standar d dosage. The health risks associated with 
chronic radiation exposure are believed to in volve levels of radiation exposure which are 
much higher than those permitted occupa tionally. There are no reported adverse 
reactions from the ad ministration of FDG.

Version4  
 
PET/CT scanning uses short-lived radiopharmaceuticals, 11C-acetate (Physical half life: 
20 minutes) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; Physic al half life: 110 minutes).  The 
study requires an IV line for administration of radiopharmaceuticals.  The PET exams will 
expose subjects to radiation. The total r adiation dose to the subj ects per exam will be 
approximately 12 mSv (a mSv is a unit of radiation dose).   
This is equivalent to approximately [ADDRESS_93054] CTs62, and 25% of the 50 mSv 
annual limit for a person who works with radiation.  
 The risk of exposure is reasonable given th e potential benefit that we might derive from 
the potential mechanistic insight of RV d ysfunction on PAH therap y and whether or not 
ranolazine can partially reverse the RV dysf unction in PAH patients who are already on 
background  PAH specific therapy.   
2 Study Objectives 
 Primary objectives:  
1. To demonstrate that t here are differences in metabolism and function between 
subjects with near normal RV function and  persistent RV dysfunction as defined 
by [CONTACT_85376] <= 40%.   
 
2. To measure changes in RV energy and contractility in subj ects with persistent 
RV dysfunction using serial 
11C-acetate and 18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR. 
 Secondary objective:  To characterize the metabolic and structural stability of the RV over  6 month in subjects 
with near normal RV function.  
3 Study Design 
3.1 General Design 
This is a companion imaging trial for patients who are eligible for the treatment trial 
entitled “A randomized, double-blind,  placebo controlled, mult i-center study to assess 
the effect of ranolazine on outcomes in s ubjects with pulmonary hypertension and right 
ventricular dysfunction accompanied by a co mparative study of cellular metabolism in 
subjects with pulmonary hypertension with a nd without right ventricular dysfunction”.  
 
Patients will be identified and screened to participate in th e treatment trial entitled “A 
randomized, double-bli nd, placebo controlled, multi-center study to assess the effect of 
ranolazine on outcomes in subj ects with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular 
dysfunction accompanied by a co mparative study of cellular metabolism in subjects with 
pulmonary hypertension wit h and without right ventricular dysfunction” . Subjects that 
meet eligibility will be aske d to consent separately for this imaging companion trial 
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH      
 Page 16  
Version4  
 
involving PET/CT imaging with the investigational radiotracers [11C]Acetate and 
[18F]FDG and Cardiovascular MR (CMR). 
All patients will undergo a baseline cardiac PET/CT scan and CMR scan(if they haven’t 
clinically). The PET/CT imaging session will include injecti on of 15-25 mCi of 11C-
acetate followed by a 30 minute dynamic scan.   After administration of oral glucose 
patients will undergo s ubsequent injection of  10 mCi (± 20%) of 18F-FDG with one hour 
wait followed by a 15 minute scan. So me patients will undergo a second cardiac 
PET/CT scan and CMR following the same imagi ng protocol at 26±2 weeks after the 
start of their treatment, dependi ng on the treatment group to which they are assigned. 
Please see the companion treatment trial fo r description of the randomization process 
and treatment groups.  
3.2 
11C-acetate may not be available for some  subjects due to tracer production 
associated technical difficulties. If 11C-acetate is unavailable it will be at the 
discretion of an investigator to omit the 11C-acetate portion of the PET/CT 
scanning procedure and proceed with the FDG portion of the imaging only. 
 Although 11C-acetate use is preferred, the in vestigator decisi on to omit it 
will be documented and any PET/C T scan done without it will not be 
considered a protocol deviat ion. Primary Study Endpoints 
 
1. Compare Myocardial oxyg en consumption/FDG uptake ratio at baseline for 
subjects with near normal RV function and those with persistent RV dysfunction 
 
2. Assess change from baseline in Myocardi al oxygen consumption/FDG ratio and 
perfusion rate in subjects with persistent RV dysfunction 
 
3.3 Exploratory Endpoints 
3.3.1 PET 
In patients with near normal RV function, charac terize the stability of metabolism over 6 
month follow up period.  
3.3.2 Additional imaging parameters by [CONTACT_85389]  
 
1. Assess RVEF, RV size and RV mass using CMR for subjects with pulmonary 
hypertension  
2. Compare extracellular volume in RV and fibrosis of the RV at baseline for 
subjects with near normal RV function and those with persistent RV dysfunction 
 
3. Assess change from baseline in extracellula r volume in RV and fibrosis of the RV 
over 6 months.

7 Methods 
7.1 PET Imaging  
7.1.1 PET Imaging Protocol 
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging will be used to evaluate regional 
myocardial perfusion, glucose utilization, and oxidative metabolism at rest using 11C-
acetate and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).  Imagi ng will be performed using a whole-
body PET/CTscanner (Germini TF or Gemini TF BigBore Philips Medical Systems, 
Netherland or Siemens MCT, Siemens A G, [LOCATION_013]) (Penn). The protocol will be 
performed under the regulat ory approval of the local IRB and FDA IND. 
Following a scout transmission scan to confirm proper position of the subject in the field 
of view, a CT attenuation scan will be ac quired for subsequent correction of photon 
attenuation. Beginning with the intr avenous bolus administration of 11C-acetate (15-25 
mCi), list mode images will be acquired over 30 min. After which 10 mCi (± 20%) of 18F-
FDG will be administered intravenously. Pati ents will then rest for approximately [ADDRESS_93071] mode images, multi-frame imaging data will be generated for 11C-acetate. 
All the reconstructed dynamic imaging dat a will be anonymized and will be transferred 
to the PET core laboratory at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_85360]. Absolute 
quantification of regional my ocardial blood flow (in mL/min/g) will be performed using 
the dynamic data acquired bet ween 0-5 minutes following 11C-acetate injection 25, 63, 64. 
We will use 2-compartment (blood pool com partment and tissue compartment) kinetic 
model of 11C-acetate to determine regional bl ood flow in the RV free wall 63, 65. The 
extraction fraction determined by  [CONTACT_85393] 65. RV free wall glycolytic 
rate will be quantified as th e SUV of the static FDG im ages. Myocardial oxidative 
metabolism and glucose uptake estimates will be corrected for partial volume effect 
based on measures of RV free wall thickne ss obtained from the cardiac MRI studies.

7.3 Laboratory Determinations 
 A urine dipstick pregnancy test must be done on the day of CMR/PET in child 
bearing age women.   
 To account for possible differences in substrate levels, two separate blood samples 
will be taken prior to 18F-FDG injection and after 18F-FDG scan to measure plasma 
concentrations of insulin, glucose, and free fatty acids. 
 Peripheral blood at the baseline and end of treatment visit will be obtained from 
subjects to send for me tabolic profiling.   
 
7.3.1 Metabolic profiling  
Analytical platform uses gas chromat ography-mass spectrometry method (Metabolon 
Inc) to provide increased overall covera ge of small molecules and allows high-
throughput data analysis to id entify biomarkers and mechanistic underpi[INVESTIGATOR_85363]. Following peak  identification and quality control filtering, int egrated peak ion 
counts for each compound in each sample  are used for statistical analysis.

 Page [ADDRESS_93075] imaging parameters as necessary.  
Image quality will be assessed fo r combined analysis.  We allow a withdraw rate of 
15%.  We will compare imaging  parameters with a sample si ze of [ADDRESS_93076] size is 50% with  a standard deviation of 50%, we will have 
100% power to detect the difference between groups with a sample size of 25.  
Assuming the effect size is 25% with a stan dard deviation of 50%, we will have 78% 
power to detect the difference between groups with a sample size of 30 (at baseline).  
8.2 Statistical Methods 
8.2.1 General Considerations 
Continuous data  (e.g., age) will be summarized using the following descriptive 
summary statistics: the number of subjects  (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value 
(min), and maximum value (max). For each  continuous variable, the corresponding 
mean, median, minimum and maximum will be presented to [ADDRESS_93077] and the SD 
to 2 decimal places, unless otherwise specified.  
Categorical variables  (e.g., presence of an AE) will be summarized using counts and 
percentages. Percentages will  be presented to [ADDRESS_93078] udy drug (screening or Day 1), unless otherwise 
specified.  
Incomplete/Missing data : Missing data (e.g., dates, post-baseline values) will not be 
imputed, unless otherwise specif ied; i.e., all missing val ues and missing post-baseline 
values will remain as missing in all stat istical analyses and listings, unless otherwise 
specified. 
Outliers:  No formal statistical analyses will be performed to detect and/or remedy the 
presence of statistical outliers.

or not.  
8.2.3  Efficacy Analysis 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Pr imary Efficacy Endpoint 
All variables including myocardial oxygen consumption/FDG ratio, perfusion absolute 
change, perfusion relative change) from metabolic imaging will be summarized and 
listed. Treatment effect will be tested using Analysis of covariance (ANOVA), with 
treatment in the model. If the normality a ssumption fails, non-parametric method will be 
employed. Difference between Arm [ADDRESS_93079]. Signific ance will be established at alpha level of 
0.05. The efficacy analysis will be conduc ted on the all-treated population. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
All variables (RVEF, RV size and RV mass, etc) from CMR imaging will be summarized 
and listed. Treatment effect  will be tested using Analysis of covariance (ANOVA), with

employed. Difference between Arm [ADDRESS_93080] (paired for 
pre and post data on the same patient, unpair ed for Arm 1 and Arm 2 patients). If the 
normality assumption fails, non-para metric method will be employed. 
8.2.4 Safety Analysis 
All analyses/summaries will be based on the all-treated population 
The overall safety profile will be assessed in  terms of the following secondary (safety) 
endpoints:

9 Safety and Adverse Events 
9.1 Definitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involvi ng Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that  meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequen cy  (i.e. not described in study-related 
documents such as the IRB-approved protocol  or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc) 
 Related or possibly related to participatio n in the research (i.e. possibly related 
means there is a reasonable pos sibility that the incident  experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]) 
 Suggests that the research places subj ects or others at greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychologic al, economic, or social harm). 
 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illne ss or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of t he study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnorma l results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event 
 is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or  to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_85394] (see below), the term 
“condition” may include abnormal physical examination findings, symptoms, or 
diseases. 
 Conditions that start ed before signing of informed consent and for which no 
symptoms or treatment ar e present until signing of  informed consent are 
recorded as medical history (e.g. seasona l allergy without acute complaints). 
 Conditions that start ed before signing of informed consent and for which 
symptoms or treatment ar e present after signing of informed consent, at 
unchanged intensity , are recorded as medical history. 
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH      
 Page 28  
Version4  
 
 Conditions that pertain to  primary or secondary effica cy variables of this study, 
i.e. findings in CMR and PET and which are considered pre-existing medical 
conditions, are not considered AEs unless there is worsening. This also implies 
that the indication for the imaging pr ocedure and the confirmation of a diagnosis 
will not be considered as an AE. 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  is 
any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] 
 results in persistent or signifi cant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
 
 
All adverse events that  do not meet any of the criteria  for serious should be regarded as 
non-serious adverse events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The study period during which adverse ev ents will be reported is defined as [ADDRESS_93082] injection of the radiotracers.   
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condit ion is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting 
condition should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the 
character of the condition wors ens during the study period. 
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnorma lity should be recor ded as a preexisting 
condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically si gnificant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definit ion of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as 
an adverse event.   
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be follo wed by [CONTACT_85395], the subject is lost to fo llow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise 
explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the in vestigator should instruct each subject to 
report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, or the s ubject’s personal physician, 
believes might reasonably be related to partic ipation in this study.  The investigator 
should notify the study sponsor of any death  or adverse event occurring at any time

events by [CONTACT_85396], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_85397].  Information on all 
adverse events should be recorded immediatel y in the source document, and also in the 
appropriate adverse event modul e of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal di agnostic procedures results should recorded in the 
source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  All adverse events occurring during the imagi ng AE reporting period mu st be recorded.  
The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or 
until it has been determined that t he study treatment or partici pation is not the cause.  
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the st udy period must be

If the report is supplied as a narrative, th e minimum necessary information to be 
provided at the time of the initial report includes: 
 Study identifier 
 Subject number 
 A description of the event 
 Date of onset  Current status 
 Whether study was discontinued 
 The reason why the event is classified as 
serious 
 Investigator assessment of the 
association between the event and study drug  
 
9.3.1 Investigator reporting: notifying the study sponsor 
Any study-related unanticipated problem posing risk of harm to  subjects or others, and 
any type of serious adverse event, must be r eported to the study investigators. Imaging 
related unanticipated problems posing risk of harm to subjec ts or others, and any type 
of serious adverse event, must be report ed to the imaging study sponsor (The 
Department of Radiology) by [CONTACT_49907] 24 hours of the even t.  To report such events, 
a Serious Adverse Event (S AE) form must be completed by [CONTACT_85398] [ADDRESS_93085] anding of the event.  Significant new 
information on ongoing serious adverse events should be provided promptly to the 
study sponsor. 
 
9.3.2 Investigator reporting: notifying the Penn IRB 
This section describes the requirements for safety reporting by [CONTACT_85399], affiliated with a Penn research site, or otherwise responsible for safety 
reporting to the Penn IRB. The University  of Pennsylvania IRB (Penn IRB) requires 
expedited reporting of those events related to  study participation that are unforeseen 
and indicate that participants or  others are at increased risk of harm.  The Penn IRB will 
not acknowledge safety reports  or bulk adverse event submi ssions that do not meet the 
criteria outlined below.  The Penn IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the 
following problems within 10 working days fr om the time the in vestigator becomes 
aware of the event: 
 Any adverse event (regardless of whether th e event is serious or non-serious, on-
site or off-site) that occurs any time dur ing or after the research study, which in 
the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85368]: 
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH      
 Page 31  
Version4  
 
Unexpected (An event is “unexpected” wh en its specificity and  severity are not 
accurately reflected in the protocol-relat ed documents, such as the IRB-approved 
research protocol, any applicable invest igator brochure, and  the current IRB-
approved informed consent docum ent and other relevant s ources of information, 
such as product labeling and package inserts.) 
AND 
Related to the research procedures (A n event is “related to the research 
procedures” if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85369], the event was 
more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_28821].) 
 
Reporting Process 
Unanticipated problems posing risks to subjec ts or others as noted above will be 
reported to the Penn IRB using the form : “Unanticipated Problem s Posing Risks to 
Subjects or Others Including Re portable Adverse Events” or as a written report of the 
event (including a description of  the event with information regar ding its fulfillment of the 
above criteria, follow-up/resolu tion and need for revision to  consent form and/or other 
study documentation).  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_85370] d receipt will be kept in 
the Clinical Investigator’s study file.  
Other Reportable events: 
For clinical drug trials, the following ev ents are also reportable to the Penn IRB: 
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, r epresents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that  is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosi s, Stevens-Johnson syndrome). 
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the protocol or 
informed consent form, or would prompt  other action by [CONTACT_85400]. 
 Information that indicates a change to  the risks or potent ial benefits of the 
research, in terms of severity  or frequency. Fo r example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that partici pants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected. 
– Safety monitoring indicates that a parti cular side effect is more severe, or 
more frequent than initially expected. 
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your 
research study is of no therapeutic value. 
 Change in FDA safety labelin g or withdrawal from market ing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol. 
 Breach of confidentiality 
 Change to the protocol ta ken without prior IRB review  to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazard to a research participant. 
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH      
 Page 32  
Version4  
 
 Incarceration of a partici pant when the research was not previously approved 
under Subpart C and the invest igator believes it  is in the best interest of the 
subject to remain on the study. 
 Complaint of a participant when the comp laint indicates unexpected risks or the 
complaint cannot be resolved by [CONTACT_5051]. 
 Protocol violation (meaning an accidental or uni ntentional deviation from the IRB 
approved protocol) that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_85371], or affect s the rights or welf are of subjects. 
9.3.3 Investigator reporting: Notifying a non-Penn IRB 
Investigators who are not Penn faculty or affiliated with a Penn research site are 
responsible for safety reporting to their loca l IRB.  Investigators are responsible for 
complying with their local IRB’s reporting  requirements, though must submit the 
required reports to their IRB no later than 10 working days.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_85372]’s study file. 
 
9.3.4 Sponsor reporting: Notifying the FDA 
The study sponsor is required to report cert ain study events in an expedited fashion to 
the FDA.  These writt en notifications of adverse events are referred to as IND safety 
reports. The following describes the safe ty reporting requirements by [CONTACT_85401]:  
 Within 7 calendar days 
Any study event that is: 
– associated with the us e of the study drug 
– unexpected,  – fatal or life-threatening, and  
 
 Within 15 calendar days 
Any study event that is: 
– associated with the us e of the study drug, 
– unexpected, and – serious, but not fata l or life-threatening 
-or- 
– a previous adverse event that was not initially deem ed reportable but is later 
found to fit the criteria for reporting (reporting within 15 calendar days from 
when event was deemed reportable). 
Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that:  
– suggest a significant risk for human subjec ts including reports of mutagenicity, 
teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity. 
 
Additional reporting requirements 
11C-acetate/18F-FDG PET/CT and CMR in PAH      
 Page 33  
Version4  
 
Sponsors are also required to identify in IND safety reports a ll previous reports 
concerning similar adverse events and to anal yze the significance of the current event 
in light of the previous reports.  
9.3.5 Sponsor reporting: Notifying participating investigators 
It is the responsibility of the study sponsor to  notify all participating investigators, in a 
written IND safety report, of any adverse ev ent associated with the us e of the drug that 
is both serious and unexpected, as well as any  finding from tests in laboratory animals 
that suggest a significant risk for human subjects.  Addi tionally, sponsors are also 
required to identify in IND safe ty reports all previous repor ts concerning similar adverse 
events and to analyze the significance of t he current event in lig ht of the previous 
reports.

(HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject 
of the following:  
 What protected health information (PHI) wil l be collected from subjects in this 
study 
 Who will have access to t hat information and why 
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization fo r use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorizat ion to collect or use PHI, the investigator, 
by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all in formation collected prior to  the revocation of 
subject authorization.  For s ubjects that have revoked aut horization to collect or use

10.[ADDRESS_93088] s of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for t he reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  
Source data are contained in  source documents.  Exam ples of these original 
documents, and data records include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097], clinical and office charts, 
laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ di aries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy 
dispensing records, recorded data from automat ed instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_85373], microfiches, photographic 
negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x-rays, subject file s, and records kept at the 
pharmacy, at the laboratories,  and at medico-technical departments involved in the 
clinical trial.  Source documents for the imaging protocol will be kept in a secure location by [CONTACT_85402] [INVESTIGATOR_85374].  Source documents for the treatment protocol will 
be kept in a secure location at the site where the subject participates. 
10.3 Data Management Plan 
We will create a shared database with common dat a definitions.  This database will be 
programmed in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture).  REDCap is a secure, 
web-based application with th e capacity for direct expo rt to Excel and common 
statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Strata, R).  REDCap has electronic CRF (eCRF)s, 
real-time data entry va lidation, audit trails, user au thentication, data logging and 
encryption.  It is HIPAA compliant with mech anisms in place to ensure confidentiality. 
 Specific forms will be used for each component of the subject’s pr ogress.  The forms 
and data dictionary will be available online for all individuals who perform data entry.  
Research personnel, trained on data definit ions, will enter data via web-based data 
forms after abstraction from the primary medical record and source documents.  The 
multisite feature of REDCap will be used to restrict data viewing by [CONTACT_431]. 
 REDCap allows double-data entry  on some or all of the dat a elements. We will apply 
this feature to predefined “key” variables.  In  addition, logical data checks will be used to 
assess data quality for mis-entry.  Suspect dat a entries will be flagged for re-review and 
confirmation by [CONTACT_85403].  When data are complete and all 
suspect entries addressed for a time period,  the database will be “locked” for analysis. 
 Analysis will use only this final locked version.  
10.4 Data Sharing Plan 
Clinical data will be exported fr om REDCap into proper statis tical software format for 
analysis.   The final dataset will be provid ed in proper format to investigators 
participating in data analysis from each site .  The mode of data sharing will be by 
[CONTACT_85404] s.  Data will be secured by [CONTACT_85405]

10.5 Records Retention 
It is the investigator’s respons ibility to retain study ess ential documents for at least [ADDRESS_93090].  These documents s hould be retained for a longer period if 
required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance,  it is the responsibility 
of the sponsor to inform the investigator/i nstitution as to when these documents no 
longer need to be retained.  
 
[ADDRESS_93091] 1 to review the study flow and to  discuss any issues that occurred.  This 
meeting will be document ed.   The Sponsor will also su pply a monitor for the below 
plan. The investigator will allocate adequate time  for such monitoring activities.  The 
Investigator will also ensure t hat the monitor or other co mpliance or quality assurance 
reviewer is given access to all requested study-related documents and facilities if 
necessary.

 A second monitoring session will be conducted when approximately 25% of 
the subjects have been enrolled. 
 
 A third monitoring session  will be conducted when ap proximately 50% of 
the subjects have been enrolled..  
 
 A fourth monitoring session  will be conducted when approximately 75% of 
the subjects have been enrolled.  
 
 A fifth monitoring session  will be conducted after 10 0% of the subjects 
have been enrolled.  This visit may be conducted after the subjects have 
completed the study and can also serv e as the close-out monitoring visit. 
Data Review 
Enrollment will be complete when up to 54 subj ects are enrolled in to the trial.   
Approximately 4 subjects will be enrolled pe r month.  Monitoring will be conducted 
periodically throughout the study as described below.   
 
 Electronic CRFs for the first 2 subjects will be 100% source data verified.  In 
addition, the eCRF for at least an additional 4 randomly selected subjects will 
be 100% source data verified at eac h additional monitoring session.   
 
 If a greater than 10% error rate is  noted during the data review, this 
monitoring plan may be revised and more subject files may be 100% source 
data verified.   
Additional subjects/events to be reviewed: 
All subjects who discontinued due to serious  adverse events will be reviewed for key 
safety and efficacy data.   
11.2 Regulatory Docu ments Reviewed 
The Regulatory Documents wi ll be maintained in the Regulatory Binder.  The 
Regulatory Binder may be reviewed by [CONTACT_941] m onitor during any visit.  The monitor will 
review the regulatory binder fo r completeness and will assure  that the eCRFs are being 
completed.      
11.3  Documentation of  the Monitoring Visit

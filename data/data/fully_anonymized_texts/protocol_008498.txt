Statistical Analysis Plan [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
Based on Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) standards, baseline demographic 
variables were summarized for morphine and clonidine treatment. Frequencies (%) are presented for 
categorical variables and either mean (SD) or median (min, max) for continuous variables. For outcome 
results, we present 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
A log-rank test was used to compare treatment arms regarding LOT and LOS. To use data from infants 
withdrawn from the study, the time of withdrawal was specified as the censoring time. Cox proportional 
hazards regression modeling was used in a follow-up analysis using treatment and selected risk factors 
associated with NOWS severity (birth weight, gestational age, gender, cesarean delivery, maternal 
psychiatric disorder, inborn status, MOUD, other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480], and non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_200580]). Because 
smoking was highly prevalent and alcohol use was infrequent, they were not included in the model. In 
post hoc analyses, a negative binomial regression was used to model LOT for [ADDRESS_918332] medication using frequencies (%) and x2 
tests. Of [ADDRESS_918333] medication; the other 4 were observed for <[ADDRESS_918334] 
treatment. We also removed these 4 infants in a follow-up analysis. The remaining 116 infants were 
used to fit a logistic regression model, from which adjusted odds ratios were derived.  
 
Wilcoxon rank tests were used to compare treatment groups regarding the timing between initial and 
final NNNS assessments and the NNNS scores (initial, final, and change). P values were adjusted using 
the false discovery rate method because of multiple comparisons across 13 summary scores. Intention-
to-treat analyses used all available data based on treatment assignment. All tests were 2-sided, with a 
statistical significance of P <.05. Analyses were conducted in SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute Inc 2013. 
SAS/ACCESSVR 9.4 Interface to ADABAS: Reference. Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc.).

WHY ARE YOU BEING INVITED TO TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH? 
You are being invited to have your baby [CONTACT_678718] a research study about drug withdrawal in newborns.  Your 
baby [CONTACT_678719].  If you volunteer for your baby [CONTACT_678720], your child 
will be one of about 250 babies at the Kentucky Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678710]. 
 
WHO IS DOING THE STUDY? 
The person in charge of this study at the Kentucky Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678711]. Henrietta S. Bada (Principal 
Investigator), Department of Pediatrics. [CONTACT_678766] is a Neonatologist specializing in newborns withdrawing from 
medications or drugs they may have received before they were born. There may be other people on the 
research team assisting at different times during the study. 
 
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY? 
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) is a group of withdrawal symptoms that can occur in babies when their 
mothers have taken pain medications or substances such as recreational or medical narcotics or drug 
treatments of methadone or subutex or suboxone during pregnancy; because medicines the mother takes while 
pregnant, the baby [CONTACT_678721]. Babies usually develop symptoms of withdrawal within a few days of birth; your 
baby [CONTACT_678722], and may need treatment.  There are different ways to treat 
babies with NAS - about 50% of doctors use morphine, which is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573], to treat these babies, the rest use 
other drugs, such as clonidine or phenobarbital. 
 
The purpose of this study is to compare two different medicines to treat babies with withdrawal.  The 
treatment medicines in this study are morphine and clonidine.  Morphine is a narcotic medicine, which is 
included in most pain killers.  Clonidine is not a narcotic and has been used to treat other conditions as well as to 
help manage symptoms in babies with NAS.    Both drugs are effective, but the purpose of this study is to see if 
one may be better than the other at reducing babies’ symptoms and reducing how long they need to stay in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  We will also be looking to see if there is a difference in how the babies grow and develop later in early 
childhood. 
 
ARE THERE REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
From the information we have about your baby, he or she qualifies to participate in the study. However, if your 
baby [CONTACT_678723] a seizure, or has been exposed to cocaine, your baby [CONTACT_678724].  If your baby [CONTACT_678725], he or she will still be treated for NAS with one of the standard medicines prescribed by 
[CONTACT_371721]’s doctor.

Informed Consent 4/5/[ADDRESS_918335]?
The research will be conducted at Kentucky Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_567538] (NICU) and the 
NICU Graduate Clinic.  The study will start when your baby [CONTACT_678726].  The treatment part of the study will end when your baby [CONTACT_678727][INVESTIGATOR_307].  You and your baby [CONTACT_678728], one year and again at two years old. 
 
WHAT WILL YOU BE ASKED TO DO? 
Your baby [CONTACT_678729], using a scoring method called Finnegan 
Scoring system.  The baby’s scores for withdrawal will differ according to the number of symptoms and the 
severity of symptoms.  This system can be used for all babies with withdrawal whether they’re in the study or 
not.  If your baby’s withdrawal scores increase or stay high, this means he or she needs medicine in order feel 
better, eat, sleep, grow, and be less fussy.  If you agree for your baby [CONTACT_678730], the pharmacy 
will randomize, or choose by [CONTACT_3364] (like a coin toss) whether to treat your baby [CONTACT_678731]. 
There is a 50/50 chance of getting either drug.  The medicine will be started immediately, but the nurses, 
doctors and you will not know which drug is being used – only the pharmacist.  Both drugs will look alike and be 
given orally (by [CONTACT_1966]).  The medicine will be given every 3 or4 hours, depending on your baby’s feeding 
schedule.   
 
The Finnegan Scoring for withdrawal will be done routinely and based on your baby’s scores; he or she may 
need an increase or decrease in the treatment dose.  If your baby [CONTACT_678732], phenobarbital will be added.  This is also a normal (standard) procedure in the NICU.  
If adding phenobarbital doesn’t help your baby, another drug may be used at the doctor’s choice.   
 
The treatment medicine will be increased over time until your baby’s scores start to improve. When your baby’s 
Finnegan scores start improving (this may take days or weeks),this means that the amount of treatment 
medicine is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_678712]’s withdrawal symptoms; then the amount of medicine will be slowly 
decreased(weaned) as long as your baby’s symptoms remain controlled.  If your baby [CONTACT_678733], his or her medicine will be increased till controlled and then slowly weaned again.  Every baby [CONTACT_678734] - some babies may only need [ADDRESS_918336] 10 days of life.  During these blood tests an extra amount 
of blood, about 1/[ADDRESS_918337] may be done up to six times. The 
extra blood will be used to look at some DNA factors and to see how much of the treatment drug is in your 
baby’s body. Your baby [CONTACT_678735]. These blood draws will be done 
randomly and close to the time your baby [CONTACT_678736]. These tests are to look at how quickly your 
baby’s body has been processing the treatment medication (how much is still in their body). 
 
Your baby [CONTACT_678737] (called the NNNS), done in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_678713].  The NNNS stands for NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale and is used to see how your baby’s 
behavior differs from other babies.  The NNNS will be done twice – once in the beginning of withdrawal 
treatment, then when your baby [CONTACT_439509] a month old.  The assessment involves observing or handling your 
baby [CONTACT_678738] (like self-calms, watching objects with eyes, etc.). 
 
You will also be asked to return to the NICU Graduate Clinic when your baby [CONTACT_678739], one and two years of 
age. Your baby [CONTACT_678740] (6 mo), Bayley Assessments (6  mo, 1 and 2 years), 
and the Early Childhood Behavior Checklist (2 yr).  These assessments are used to see how a baby’s motor skills 
(physical abilities), cognitive skills (mental abilities) and behavior are developi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  This takes about an hour and is 
done by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_541].  While you are at you baby’s visit we would like to conduct a caretaker interview 
of continuing drug use, Parenting Stress Index, brief symptom inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory. We [ZIP_CODE]

WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS?  
Your baby [CONTACT_678741].  Both of the medicines 
may cause constipation, vomiting, sweating, drowsiness or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], low blood pressure and even decreased 
breathing.  None of these side effects happen very often in the NICU because the dose is usually not enough to 
cause the problems.   
 
There are risks with drawing blood in babies, but since the doctors order other tests, the baby [CONTACT_678742]. The extra blood taken for this study will not increase the risks that already exist (pain, bleeding, 
infection, bruising, and soreness). Two additional blood draws will be done for research only. These blood draws 
carry the same possible discomforts and risks as if they were done as standard of care. 
 
There is always a chance that any medical treatment can harm your baby, and the investigational treatment in 
this study is no different.  In addition to the risks above, your baby [CONTACT_678743] a previously unknown risk or

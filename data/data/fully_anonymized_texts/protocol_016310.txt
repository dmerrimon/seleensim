This document is a Phase III clinical research protocol and t he described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the IRB approved protocol, associated Federal regulations and all applicable IRB 
requirements.  
This study proposes that predictable health surveillance and unmet emotional needs of adult hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (HCT) survivors can be improved through a centralized, cost and resource -sparing,  
national program that optimizes health informatics and provides online expertise and stepped care 
telehealth assistance with using the program when necessary.  If successful, this project would provide 
long- term HCT survivors and their providers with a patient -centered program to facilitate managing their 
emotional and health care needs.  Long -term HCT survivors do not receive adequate care for their unique 
health and emotional needs due to lack of knowledge and resources to manage these needs in their home 
communities, although many of these needs have been well defined.  Lack of access to care increases 
prematur e morbidity and mortality in HCT survivors particularly for cardiovascular and metabolic disease 
(cardiometabolic) and subsequent malignancies . 
Among adult long- term cancer survivors, those who received HCT have a 9- fold increased risk of mortality 
related most commonly to cancer recurrence,  subsequent malignancy s and cardiovascular diseases .[2-5]  
They are also at risk for poorer psychosocial health including cancer -related distress, with depression at 
higher levels than age- matched norms. [6-8]  By [CONTACT_342310] H CT survivors who  are 2- 5 years after 
treatment, we target a high risk group and build upon our previous experience delivering tailored online  
content  with telehealth/phone based stepped care for those who do not improve at an interim  assessment 
point at 6-weeks  after randomization.   
The major goal of this protocol  is to test the efficacy of the  integrated , tailored online site, using a self-
management  model of care that distributes survivorship care plans, tools and resources for management of 
distress and health care adherence directly to cancer survivors as the coordinators of their own health.  Our 
previous research has demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and distress with survivors at a single 
site[9, 10], at six sites across the nation [11], and has tested the efficacy of providing a survivorship 
preventive care plan{485 5}[10] With this protocol we will retain the focus on depression, distress and health 
behaviors, while improving the methodology by [CONTACT_531051] (CIBMTR/NMDP) for post -study sustainable 
implementation of the program. The protocol also builds on increasing recognition that a si ngle online device 
or method will not meet the needs of all survivors.   
Although HCT is often considered distinct from other cancer treatments, the primary outcomes in the 
proposed research are also some of the most prevalent concerns and causes of mortal ity in other groups of 
survivors treated with standard therapy. [12, 13]  The me thods we propose are relevant for any survivors 
who would benefit from cost and resource conserving interventions provided by [CONTACT_531052].   With these improvements and the extension of the intervention to twelve  transplant centers we 
expect to strengthen both the reach and efficacy of the intervention tested in protocols [ADDRESS_689545] (N= 492), with Seattle as the prime site, partnering with transplant 
centers in Ohio, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, [LOCATION_005], Pennsylvania, [LOCATION_001], [LOCATION_012],  
Kansas, Illinois,  and [LOCATION_007] .  This provides age, region and rural/urban diversity.  Participants randomized to 
the intervention will receive immediate access to the tailored online program , with options for social -media,  
adding stepped care self -management calls  for those not improving by a [ADDRESS_689546] and cancer websites as well as  delayed internet  site access.  Outcomes will be 
assessed at 6 weeks , 3 months and 12 months .

Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689547] on quality of life (QOL.) [14].  
Survivors have more difficulty after transplant if they struggle with chronic GVHD, have pulmonary disease, 
infection or other p sychological or medical complications.  [15-17] 
 
Significance and Gaps This Project Will Fill  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_531019], survivors more than [ADDRESS_689548] on quality of life. [6, 18]   Distress is far more prevalent than clinical 
depression, with prevalence estimated at 43% in long- term HCT survivors and moderate to severe 
depressive symptoms in 13- 15%. [7, 19-21]  Distress can be due to many factors such as uncertainty, 
cGVHD, managing the side effects of transplant, and financial stress. [22-24]  Our preliminary research 
found that 41% of 2- [ADDRESS_689549] survivor study participants had elevated distress on the Cancer and 
Treatment Distress (CTXD) measure. [25]  In the cohort of 936 study participants, all but 1% of those with 
elevated depression scores also had elevated distress on the CTXD, suggesting that the CTXD captures a 
large proportion of depressive symptoms .[11]  Therefore, we believe our focus on CTXD distress as the 
primary outcome will also address depression needs for nearly all survivors, although we will still measure depressive symptoms as a secondary endpoint.  Risk factors for distress for allogeneic HCT include 
younger age, shorter time after HCT, and cGVHD.  For autologous HCT, comorbidities are a risk factor for 
distress. [26, 27]  Pre-HCT depression predicts later depression and other poorer outcomes [
6, 27] as well as 
survival. [6, 28, 29]  We have demonstrated that the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531020] (see 2.2  Preliminary Res earch ).  Others have demonstrated improved distress and post -traumatic 
stress in HCT survivors with telehealth cognitive behavioral treatment. [30] 
Cardiovascula r Disease (CVD) and Metabolic Syndrome.  With a risk of premature CVD related death 
increased 2.3-  4.0-fold compared to the general population, [31, 32] HCT survivors are more likely to 
develop adverse CVD risk factors leading to development of metabolic syndrome (constellation of high triglyceride levels, low HDL -cholesterol, hypertension, high fasting glucose and increased waist 
circumference) which predisposes individuals to early CVD -related death.  Insulin resistance is the primary 
pathophysiologic mechanism and HCT survivors are more likely to develop hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and diabetes. [33-36]  In the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivor Study we examined diabetes, h ypertension, 
and CVD events in 2+ year HCT survivors (n=1089) and found that allogeneic HCT survivors were 3.6 and 2.0 times more likely to report diabetes and hypertension compared to siblings.  In addition, exposure to TBI 
increased the risk of diabetes 3.4 times. [37]  In a case- control study of [ADDRESS_689550] survivors compared to 
509 randomly selected individuals from the general population, the 10 -year cumulative incidence of 
ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, s troke, and all -cause death from CVD ranged from 3.5 -6.0%. [38]  
Other mechanisms include cardiomyopathy and coronar y artery damage due to chemotherapy and chest 
irradiation. [38-43]  Most cardiometabolic abnormalities can be screened for and treated.  Screening and 
preventative recommendations for CVD in HCT survivors have been recently published by a combined US and European task force. [44]  
9819  
Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689551] significant long- term health risks.  Numerous studies report the risk of a 
subsequent malignancy  between 4 to 11- fold higher than in the general population. [45-51]  The types of 
subsequent malignancy s seen vary ov er time with earlier occurrence for myelodysplasia/acute myeloid 
leukemia and post -transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and longer latency for solid tumors. [52]  The 
cumulative incidenc e of subsequent malignancy s increases with longer length of follow -up, approaching 
8.8% at [ADDRESS_689552], and no evidence of a plateau. [49]  Risks of subsequent malignancy s after HCT 
are increased for skin, thyroid, oral cavity, esophagus, liver, breast, nervous system, bone and connective 
tissues, [46-48, 53] and risk factors include total body irradiation (TBI), young age at HCT, cGVHD and 
prolonged immunosuppression. [54]  HCT survivor specific guidelines have been published taking these into 
account, [54] and form the basis for the recommendations in the SCP that will be utilized for this study. [55-
58] 
Treatment Summary & Survivorship Care Plan (SCP) .  SCPs are recommended for all cancer survivors, 
and should include the following information: (1) cancer type, treatments and their potential long term 
effects, (2) information about screening and preventive evaluations and their timing, and (3) 
recommendat ions about lifestyle practices. [59, 60]  When used in shared decision making as a cornerstone 
of self -management, SCPs may increase communication between oncologists and primary care 
providers. [61]  A majority of cancer programs face barriers to implementing delivery of SCPs ( time and effort 
to create and disseminate) and thus are not providing them. [62-66]  Having a written plan may help 
survivo rs more than just talking with them about their SCPs. [67, 68]  Health informatics reduces  barriers  to 
generating SCPs. [69, 70]  We are designing this protocol  with dissemination in mind as has been 
recommended when using SCPs. [71]  To date, research testing delivery of a printed SCP, without follow -up 
to personalize the application of the information to the individual, has not found positive outcomes with 
regard to health care adherence ( HCA ) or distress, although survivors may report feeling positive about 
having received SCPs. [65, 72-84]  Personalizing an action plan for the individual through online interact ion, 
and follow -up to address barriers by [CONTACT_531053], are necessary to make SCPs more effective. [85, 
86] 
 
Preliminary Research  
Preliminary Studies that Provide a Foundation for the Planned Methodology  
The scientific premise of the study builds on our preliminary research and work done in other chronic 
conditions such as diabetes  that supports the value of online and telehealth self -management.  Online 
interventions for chronic diseases have proliferated, with mixed and at most modest success. [87-89]  Effect 
sizes are modest at best since those with greater problems are less likely to engage with the program. [90]  
Other than our INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_208847], only [ADDRESS_689553] reduced 
distress and depressive symptoms; those required cognitive behavioral treatment delivered over the phone 
or in person. [30, 91]  Online programs are an attractive option for HCT survivors as many live far from their 
transplant center, and many go online for information. [92-95]  Social media provides access to other 
survivors through private groups and has been used in interventions with non- HCT cancer survivors with 
some success. [96-98]  A major limitation of online interventions is that many who sign up are already doing 
quite well in their health behaviors. [99, 100]  Literature search indicates few published RCTs of online 
interventions in cancer survivors, with mixed findings. [88, 101]  While a few interventions have been found 
to be efficacious, [102-108] the effect sizes are sm all and published studies tend to focus on feasibility and 
acceptability and not outcomes or efficacy. [69, 109-117]  Studies  that provide options for participants to 
write content and complete action plans as part of the intervention have better outcomes than those where 
participants just read. [118]  This interactivity is an effective component of online interventions. [87, 119, 120]  
We propose to strengthen the proven online intervention from our INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531021] a 
responsive design for use on all platforms, including social media, which will allow increased interactive 
options and improved personalization of the content. [121] 
PCORI -SCP Study  
This study had two phases; the first involved focus groups of HCT patients/caregivers and providers 
involved in survivorship care to get feedback on a SCP template and its implementation using the 
9819  
Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689554] survivors (guideline effort led by [INVESTIGATOR_124] . Majhail). [122-124]  The final SCP is being tested in 
an ongoing RCT that compares usual care to the personaliz ed SCP in HCT survivors [ADDRESS_689555] with CIBMTR/NMDP, the investigators and the SCP.  To 
strengthen the potential effect siz e of the SCP intervention, we will directly send the SCP to providers 
because studies have shown that reliance on survivors alone to disseminate a copy of their SCP to their provider is problematic. [69, 125]  Overall, interventions that give materials to both patients and providers 
have been more effective in general population studies that seek to improve overall adherence to 
recommended preventive care. [126, 127]  
INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531022] c ompleted 2 INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531023]  (protocols 2258 and 2605) , improving feasibility and implementation 
of the program while refining procedures for study administration across multiple sites, personalizing approach to survivors through informatics programming, and with a change in primary outcomes to focus on 
adherence. In our first INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531024], distress and fatigue, without personalized content but with a 3- group randomiz ation including a 
‘standard care’ control arm, the online intervention, and the online intervention plus a Problem Solving 
Treatment (PST) administered with 8 phone calls. [10, 128-130] Fred Hutch HCT survivors [ADDRESS_689556] were eligible. Participation rate was 58% for those eligible and approached, with those age <40 years, 
non-white races, and >[ADDRESS_689557] less likely to enroll. [128] Once randomized to intervention, 77% 
logged in at least once and pages viewed did not differ by [CONTACT_545], ethnicity, education, income, computer experience, donor type, healthcare adherence, distress or depression, but those likely to view 3+ pages of 
the sit e were more likely to be over 40 years and female. We found no efficacy for fatigue but  did find 
important outcomes for distress and depression. For those who were impaired we found twice the rate of 
improved distress in those randomized to the intervention. Distress was more likely to improve in those age 
40+ and in those <[ADDRESS_689558][ 10]. From these results, we designed the next multicenter INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531025]. Given the incremental i mprovement relative to large resource requirements to 
administer the 8- session PST with masters or doctoral level trained clinicians, and lack of interest in the 
number of sessions by [CONTACT_531054], we did not retain PST in the next study.  
Our most rec ent multicenter INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531026] 
(CA160684) provides a platform and infrastructure for this study. The project approached N= [ADDRESS_689559] at 6 national transplant 
centers, and enrolled 1064 survivors using the eligibility criteria  as planned for this protocol . Of these, 
470 had impairments on one or more primary 
endpoints of depression, distress or overall HCA. Final 
12-month outcomes were completed in December 
2016, and analyses are in process.  In examining 
reach of the entirely online INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531027], participation did not differ by [CONTACT_124940], 
urban/rural residence, transplant intensity, or diagnosis, but was more likely for women, allogeneic 
HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , and age 40- 60[11]. We conclude that 
strategies are needed to improve reach to men, 
younger and older adults . We designed this  
intervention to better target engagement and meet the personal needs of these subgroups. Preliminary analyses of 3- month outcomes indicate efficacy of the 
intervention for distress in those who access the online intervention. We see no interaction of intervention arm FIGURE 1. Survivorship self -management model

Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689560]. However, viewing the online site interacts significantly 
with randomized intervention,  indicating significantly higher  rate of improvement for intervention recipi[INVESTIGATOR_531028] . 
Self-Management  Theory  
Self-Management has been used to help patients cope with their chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes) and has 
been influencing cancer survivorship. [1, 90, 95, 131]  Foster and colleagues developed an online 
intervention to assist survivors in self -managing fatigue. [132]  Self-management has been used in cancer 
survivors to increase physical activity and improve diet, [133] and to reduce distress. [134]  In a meta -
analysis of online self -management studies, small to moderate effect sizes were found for anxiety, 
depression and quality of life. [89]  Younger survivors expect that at least some of their self -management will 
occur online. [135]  Self -management is a central premise of online interventi ons that attempt behavior 
change (see Figure 1.2 for our planned model of self -management). [136] 
Stepped Care Using Telehealth.  HCT survivors are amenable to using telehealth calls.[30, 137]  One 
stepped care intervention was found to be comparable to usual care, but the study was done in the pre -
transplant setting and enrolled patients with low distress. [138]  Telehealth has been as effective as face- to-
face interventions for cancer survivors. [139]  Our first INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531029] 8 phone calls 
in addition to the online intervention, compared with the online program alone or delayed access control, 
was more effective than online alone for distress. [10]  However, we found great variety in the chosen targets 
for PST, such that it was difficult to measure outcomes, and many survivors did not feel a need for the 
extended telehealth call s.  For the stepped care methodology, we are using a self -management model we 
have tested with young adult cancer survivors, with 3 phone calls and content focused on achieving goals 
specific to the study endpoints of distress, cardiac and/or subsequent malignancy HCA, and retaining an 
emphasis on specifying personal goals and anticipating barriers and facilitators to reaching goals.  
This protocol  tests an intervention to reduce common problems after HCT  that have not resolved by [CONTACT_531055], while extending our knowledge of risks for long- term or late effects in these survivors.  
It build s on prior online intervention research , with b road reach and high utilization.  If efficac ious in this 
multi- center RCT , it can be disseminated nationwide with limited maintenance costs.

2. Determine  characteristics of intervention participants who require telehealth stepped care at 6 -weeks  
because they 1) do not meet criteria for adequate knowledge of subsequent malignancy  and 
cardiometabolic risks, or 2) do not report improved distress, or 3) have not logged in to the online 
program.   
3. Determine resources  that would be needed to sustain the intervention as a national HCT 
survivorship program if implemented through the CIBMTR//NMDP.

with the Fred Hutch Data Management Office ( [PHONE_3937]).  Since consent occurs only through the study 
website, which is managed by [CONTACT_941] C oordinating Center , the participating consortium centers will not be 
involved in subject registration.  After the eligible subjects have been registered, subjects will be randomi zed 
by [CONTACT_531064] (DMO), Monday through Friday between 8:[ADDRESS_689566]/PDT.   The DMO will email  the randomization assignment back to the Project Manager  at the 
Coordinating Center .  The DMO can be paged, if necessary, at [ADDRESS_689567] Manager  will 
receive the randomization assignment . She will input the randomization arm into the databases to  trigger 
the programmed website access (intervention or control) for the participant , and will email participants their 
link to the study site.  
 
7.0 PLAN OF TREATMENT  
 
Intervention Selection and Approach  
The CIBMTR data registry contains 3765 potentially eligible 2- 5 year  survivors including 14% minorities 
from the 13 participating centers. The study Biostatistician will develop a Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) 
program for random selection of potentially eligible participants with oversampling of minorities (initially  all 
eligible minority cases will be approached) until a minimum of 15% of those randomized are minority race or 
9819  
Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689568] s in blocks of 25 cases. Based on our previous INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531030], we found that 26% of cases were not eligible after further screening. We 
project that we will enroll and randomize 51% of eligible non- minority survivors and 40% of minority 
survivors. Thus we expect we will approach approximately 1358  (36%) of potentially eligible cases, with 
26% not eligible after approach, to achieve our total projected enrollment N= [ADDRESS_689569] information to NMDP/Fred Hutch .  The letter will 
include a response form, stam ped return envelope, study email address, internet URL for the study , 
temporary participant study ID code and toll-free phone number for survivors to contact [CONTACT_510276]/Fred Hutch  
to discuss the study  or to contact [CONTACT_531065] .  NMDP will be the default 
contact [CONTACT_531066] -free line, but contacts may be escalated to Fred Hutch as needed 
based on survivors’ questions or concerns about study part icipation.  Initial letter contact [CONTACT_531067] a total of  up to six phone 
calls until the participant is reached and indicates interest or declines to participate .  Up to  three voice 
messages will be left.   After participants return the response form to the consortium sites  agreeing that their 
contact [CONTACT_531068]/Fred Hutch study staff, or participant s log onto the study internet 
site and consent , or they contact  [CONTACT_408] s directly  by [CONTACT_61529] , all further study 
activities will be handled by [CONTACT_531069] .  The exception is if  survivors  from the 
consortium  sites have medical questions .  As agreed by [CONTACT_531070],  such questions will be directed 
by a study investigator at Fred Hutch  to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_531031] ’s transplant center.    
Enrollment will continue until targeted goals are met , as defined for each targeted outcome in Table 3.  We 
expect thi s to require  [ADDRESS_689570] be agreed to and submitted.  Consent will be indicated to include: 1) communicat ion by [CONTACT_531071] (required) , access to the secured online internet site (required), and social media ( optional ), 2) 
response  to self -report assessments, and 3) allow ing study  access to medical records.  After consenting, 
survivors will be registered for the study with the Fred Hutch study registration office.   
Consent, with HIPAA content, will be electronically signed online.  Survivors will be able to review and print 
the consent document before consenting via the online site, as they desire.  If survivors have questions or 
concerns before signing the consent, we encourage them to contact [CONTACT_531072] ([EMAIL_10127]
). Consent will be obtained using forms approved by [CONTACT_531073].  
Consenting Information about Treatment  Conditions .  Survivors will be told that the research focus is on 
decreasing distress  and increasing health care understanding and actions for people 2 to 5  years after 
transplant.  They will be told that there are two possible groups: 1) full INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531032] , with mailed treatment summary  and survivorship care plan (TS-SCP) for the survivor and, 
if they choose to provide names, for their health care providers, with  an optional orientation call at 2 weeks 
and optional self-management calls at 6 weeks ; or 2) access to a study website with links to other online 
resources for survivors , with delayed INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531033] 12- month  
assessment.  They will be advised that they will be contact[CONTACT_531074].  
The first 100  participants who are approached, with an expected N=20 enrolled for the randomized study , 
will be treated as “r un in” participant s to test the website programming and study intervention procedures . 
9819  
Protocol, version 6/06/ 2022  
Page 13 of 34 They will be approached and treated as regular participants from survey to data management randomization 
and intervention. These participants will receive the same access and study experience as later participants, 
but they will not be included in the outcome analyses  or the N= 492 sample size .  Thus the total enrollment is 
projected to be N= 512. 
Response to Elevated Depression Scores at Baseline or Later Assessments  
After baseline assessment, responses on the primary outcomes will be scored to determine whether the 
participant meets eligibility criteria for randomization and whether a suicide and depression screening 
trained study investigator  needs to contact [CONTACT_531075].  At least 
weekly, the Project Manager  will review baseline assessments.  She will bring any severe depression or 
other concerns to the attention of Drs. Yi , Syrjala , Baker or Majhail .  Of note, the depression measure, PHQ -
8, does not include a question about suicidal thoughts.  
If possible major depression or risk to the survivors’ health in other ways is detected, we have planned 
standard, IRB approved procedures    With a score of [ADDRESS_689571] the study investigator . The study investigator  may also send an email message, w ithout 
PHI or indication of the reason for the call .  All email or voice mail will indicate only that the study 
investigator  is contact[CONTACT_531076]/her participation in the study, and will ask the participant 
to contact [CONTACT_1704] .  If there is no contact [CONTACT_531077] [ADDRESS_689572] the participant, and providing the study toll-free phone number and email address, 
after which no further attempts to reach the person will be made.  Once a participant is reached, the study 
investigator  `will complete the safety evaluation which will include: 1) the nature of the suicidal thoughts or 
severe depression, 2) any suicide plan, 3) risk factors for suicide, 4) family, close friends or health care 
providers  who are aware of or treating the participant’s depression and/or suicidal thoughts or plans, and 5) 
overall risk for suicide and safety of the participant.  If safety concerns remain, the study investigator  may 
contact 911 or a family member to take the participant to an emergency room for evaluation, or follow other 
requirements indicated by [CONTACT_76522] (e.g., calling the county designated mental health professional 
[CDMHP] to evaluate the participant for potential involuntary psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).   If safety is not 
judged to be an immediate risk, the study investigator  and participant will review available local resources 
and make a plan for addressing severe depression or suicidal thoughts.  The study investigator  will 
encourage the participant to discuss thoughts and symptoms with his/her health care provider as 
appropriate.  If needed, the study investigator  may follow- up with an additional call to assure participant 
safety and use of available resources.  A call record, with written risk assessme nt information, will be stored 
in a locked file separate from other study data.  The form used for this depression and suicide screening is 
in the attachments .  The study investigator  will inform a study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_531034] [ADDRESS_689573] will also occur if any participant receives a score of 20 or greater on the depression measure 
(indicating severe depression) at 3 or 12 month outcomes.  These  survivors will remain eligible for study 
randomization.  In our previous int ernet studies, < 1% indicated  severe depression requiring a phone call.  
Stratification and Randomization  
Those who complete the baseline assessment but are determined to be ineligible after baseline assessment 
will be given access to the online INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531035] a courtesy.  Those who meet all eligibility criteria will be 
randomized based on the stratification criteria described below.  If any one of the following scores on 
baseline patient reported outcomes (PRO) is impaired, the participant will be randomized within ‘Group 1,’ if 
no scores are impaired the participant will be randomized within ‘Group 0’ for the  primary and secondary 
endpoints: a) Cancer and Treatment Distress ( CTXD score <0.9 vs. ≥0.9), b) cardiometabolic health care 
adherence (<80% vs.≥80%) and c) cancer health care adherence (<80% vs.≥80%).  Note that each of these  
endpoints of the study has a measure cut -point for  eligibility for Group 1 randomization required  at baseline, 
and these are  the threestratification parameters below.  However, all eligible participants will be randomized 
9819  
Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689574] Manager  will fax the registration office with stratification data 
for randomization.   Stratification factors are based on whether the participant exceeded or fell below  the cut -
offs for  these endpoints , as determined by [CONTACT_531078] , prior to randomization.  We will not 
stratify on  age, sex, cGVHD treatment, or race/ethnicity because we believe these will be balanced 
adequat ely between study arms through random selection, and we will adjust, or stratify on these factors as 
needed in analyses.  Participants in both groups will then be randomly assigned to either the “Control” or 
“Intervention” arms.  The PIs and Biostatistician will review participation rates within each stratum annually 
and adjust the algorithm if needed.  Once enrollment is complete, the sampling probability relevant to each 
participant will be stored in the database for use in analyses.   Randomization assignment of the participant 
will be communicated to the participant through email.   A diagram of study randomization is shown in Figure

Treatment Internet  Site and Related Materials .  The INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531038].  It will consist of the following six levels:  1) A greeting 
home page, with links to each target area.  2) Lift Mood, emphasizing managing stress and 
emotions.  3) Boost Heart Health pages focusing on implementation of the SCP addressing overall 
health behavior recommendations with a focus on cardiometabolic health.  4) Prevent Cancer pages 
focus ing on implementation of the SCP for cance r screening tests and behaviors that prevent 
cancer .  5) Getting Connected, focusing on social activation and using resources to improve mood.  
6) Tips and Tools, with downloadable content and tracking worksheets for monitoring progress on 
goals. There wil l also b e options for participants to send secure messages with questions or 
comments  on any topic to the study  and links to the study Facebook page maintained and monitored 
by [CONTACT_5984] .  The secure Facebook page will offer notices and encourage return to the site.   
Twitter and Instagram will have the same messages.  We will increase motivation by [CONTACT_6968] ‘pushes’ , 
and mobile application notifications  to cue survivors to links that match needs, and encourage use 
and tracking of the SCP .  After completing the 12- month assessment, participants will receive a $[ADDRESS_689578] from Amazon, to be mailed to them as study payment.  
Tailoring will include: 1) use of the participant’s first name [CONTACT_531097] s, 2) recommended links to site 
landing pages specific to the participants’ baseline elevated scores, 3) p articipants will receive 
tailored ‘push’ email links at 8 times after randomization, and 4) participants will receive mailed 
individualized TS -SCP wit h information about their cancer treatment and current recommended 
preventative health care guidelines.   Health care providers listed on the baseline assessment will be 
sent as TS -SCP with an abbreviated listing of the recommended SCP screening and a focus  on 
cardiometabolic health and cancer screening.   
Stepped Care Self -Management Telehealth Contacts .  Group 1 intervention participants who at the 
T2 (6 week s) indicate no use of the online program , or lack knowledge of their cardiometabolic or 
subsequent malignancy risks,  or do not indicate improvement in distress , will receive telehealth 
contacts.  These will be three to four calls via phone.  Calls will last  20-[ADDRESS_689579] call 
and 10- 20 min utes for the ‘booster’ calls .  They will be led by a ‘coach’ trained by [CONTACT_531079] -management  skills, using a manual to deliver call content focused on 
assisting survivors with using the self -management skills in the online program .  This is a brief, 
manualized intervention is designed to be sustainable without extensive clinical training and has 
been tested.  The first session will focus on impairments indicated by [CONTACT_941] T2 6-week  screening  PRO .  
The coach and participant will mak e shared decisions, led by [CONTACT_2299], on goals and an action 
plan for addressing deficits, and elicit potential barriers and their solutions based on chronic disease self-management models (Figure  1).[
1, 84, 133, 140-143]  The second and third ‘booster’ calls will 
review progress on the action plan, address barriers and agree on a revised plan if needed.  
Participants and coaches will decide whether a fou rth call would be helpful based on the complexity 
and difficulty of the goals and action plans.  The contacts will be audiotaped for process evaluation

Participants  randomized to receive the website providing links to existing transplant and cancer 
survivor sites and delayed access  to the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_531039]  (control) arm will be notified that 
they will be able to access the secured internet  content after one year, and in the meantime wil l be 
provided with links to existing online resources and survivor sites.  They can access the study 
content after they have completed their 12- month  outcome assessments.  At that time, the Project 
Manager  will have their web permissions modified so that all internet  study content can be accessed 
until the study closes.   Internet site  access will be as described above in 7.5 .1. Control participants 
will also receive mailed individualized TS -SCP at randomization.  After completing the 12- month

Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689581] are standardized measures with population 
norms.  Measures were selected to target outcomes or as descriptive variables or m ediators or moderators 
of outcomes as defined by [CONTACT_531080] . 
 
Measurement Time Points  
The measures and their administration time points for three of the four assessments are listed in Table 1: 
baseline, 3 and 12 months.  For group 1 intervention participants only, t here will also be a brief orientation 
call for the study at 2 weeks , and an assessment at 6 weeks , that determines  distress and knowledge of 
survivor health risks. Distress is measured on a 0-10 distress thermometer rating scale (0=no distress, 
10=extreme distress) is >5, along with the first 2 items on the PHQ scored <=2 indicating low distress and 
depression symptoms . The distress thermometer is a widely used, validated and reliable meas ure of 
distress in cancer survivors .[144-147]  Knowledge of HCT Survivor  Health Risks  is an 11- item screening for 
cardiometabolic and subsequent malignancy  risks. Items are scored 0 (‘my risk is higher’) or 1 (‘my risk is 
not different’ or ‘not sure’) with a score >[ADDRESS_689582] the participant by [CONTACT_531081], if not, whether the assessment can be completed by [CONTACT_2319].  
 
 
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)  
Primary Outcomes  
Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD ).  The CTXD is a 22 -item inventory of distress or worry 
related to stressful events for cancer survivors. [25]  The measure was developed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_531040], nurses and physicians and has been tested with long- term 
survivors (N= 1978).  Testing supports its value as a predictor of health outcomes  and it has been 
used in several RCTs. [6, 148-150]  Internal reliability for HCT survivors is α = .93. There are 6 
reliable subscales: uncertainty, health burden, family strain, finances, medical demands, 
identity. [151] 
 Health Care Adherence (H CA).  The HCA is derived from the Cornell Service Index. [152
]  We have 
tested the format with several thousand HCT survivors. [153]  Scores are transformed to proportion 
of HCA recommendations met.  For a primary outcome, we use HCA items reflecting adherence  to 
cardiometabolic surveillance (HCA -cardio; 5 items) .   Additional items measure adherence to 
subsequent malignancy surveillance (HCA -cancer; 7 items)  and will be a secondary endpoint (see 
below) .  Items are adjusted for sex and age at which tests are recommended.  An item is scored as 
‘adhered to’ if the participant is under the age of recommended test onset.  Cut point for determining 
adherence for each item is based on the frequency of testing rec ommended in guidelines (annual, 
every 3 or 5 years).  Score is calculated as percentage of tests completed.  Since adherence is 
important to reduce mortality risk, we set the cutoff for not meeting adherence criteria at <80%.   In 
our previous 6 -site INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_208847], we found 34% not adherent to HCA -cardio surveillance using the 
above criteria.  Validity for HCA -cardio is supported by [CONTACT_531082] (p<.01 for all): 
9819  
Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689583] survivors. [154]  With 6 subscales, the overall and subscale reliabilities are all α > 0.80.  Mean 
score with cut point >0.45 will be used as an Aim 2 predictor. with subscales: Cost, Avoidance, Time, 
Knowledge, Provider Access,  . 
 
 
Secondary Outcomes   
Patient Health Questionnaire (P HQ-8).  The 8 item PHQ8 scale is highly reliable, valid and widely 
utilized in medical and psychiatric studies. [155-157]  We have extensive data documenting reliability 
and uti lity in survivors.  
 
Health Care Adherence for subsequent malignancies. As described above , our assessment of HCA 
includes 7 items measuring adherence to surveillance for subsequent malignancies.   Scoring will be 
carried out as described for the primary HCA -cardio outcome and will use a cutoff for not meeting 
adherence criteria at <80%. In our previous 6- site INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_208847], we found 45% not adherent to 
HCA -cancer surveillance using the above criteri a.  Validity for HCA -cancer is supported by a 
marginal association with history of second cancer, with a 17% cumulative incidence rate in study 
participants (62% adherent vs. 54% occurrence rate for second cancers in the early post -HCT 
period; p =.074).   
  
Moderators for Primary Outcomes and Risk Factors for Secondary Analyses  
Background.   Standard questions will define demographic characteristics including age, income, 
rural/urban by [CONTACT_121810], gender, ethnicity, education, work status, current medications,  and cancer 
history . 
Comorbidity Index and General Health.  The self -report comorbidity index has strong kappa 
agreement with the Charlson comorbidity index, which is scored from medical records.  S tudies 
document the accuracy of HCT  survivor self -report of medical diseases and problems when 
compared with medical records .[165][166]  Medications will also be reported.   It has documented 
validity and test -retest reliability, and used in our previous studies. [165-167] 
GVHD Symptom Scale .  For allogeneic HCT recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], a reliable, validated measure based on 
cGVHD severity; type and duration of medications for cGVHD. [168]   
 
 
Mediators for Primary Outcomes  
Knowledge of Health Care Needs .  This 15-item measure addresses 2 factors: 1) knowledge of 
treatment and related risks, including cardiometabolic and second cancer risks, and 2) 
understanding of health care recommendations and emotional health resources after HCT as 
included in our intervention.  With N=936 participants in our previous INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_208847], alpha is strong 
for the overall score (α = .92) and factors (α = .82, (α = .93).  The measure is derived from a similar 
measure developed in our SCOEN collaborations. [82] 
Health Related Self -Efficacy.   This measure reflects beliefs about health -related self -efficacy. [169, 
170]  In testing with N=[ADDRESS_689584] survivors, the measure has reliability of α = 0.86.  
 
Process measures   
These measures will provide intervention engagement, fidelity, and descriptive data.  After intent to treat 
analyses, they will provide covariates for analyzing differential efficacy of the intervention.

Cost and Resource Tracking 
We will track the costs of maintaining the program if disseminated (not including elements required for resear ch implementation) as indicated by 1) materials, 2) programming for site maintenance, technical 
problem solving, and updating content and maintaining social networking, 3) multi -center staff time for 
identifying, approaching and tracking participants, and responding to participant comments 4) coordinating 
center and CIBMTR/NMDP staff time for tracking participants, responding to participant comments and 
requests, and responding to technical problems.  We will track costs separately for the self -management 
call component.  Site staff will report cost summaries quarterly.  These will be standardized to report the 
cost per participant who reaches at least one of the primary endpoints for the study, specified for each type 
of cost (materials, staff time) as well  as total costs.  Because we will track the costs of preparing SCPs and 
internet links provided to the control group and will know their outcomes, we will also be able to calculate an 
incremental cost -effectiveness ratio for the internet intervention progr am compared to the control cost -
effectiveness, similar to the method described by [CONTACT_531083]. [171, 172]

10.0 GUIDELINES FOR ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
Adverse Event Reporting/Institutional Policy  
 
The following guidelines are the minimum Cancer Consortium IRB adverse event (AE) reporting guidelines.  
Protocol -specific additional reporting requirements for adverse events are addressed in Section 10.2.  In 
9819  
Protocol, version 6/06/ [ADDRESS_689586] that the research places 
research participants or others at greater risk of physical or psychological harm than was previously known or recognized be reported to the IRB within 10 calendar days of learning of the  problem.  
Institutional support of trial monitoring will be in accordance with the Fred Hutch/University of Washington Cancer Consortium Institutional Data and Safety Monitoring Plan.  Under the provisions of this plan, Fred 
Hutch Clinical Research Support  coordinates data and compliance monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_51760], 
contract research organizations, or Fred Hutch employees unaffiliated with the conduct of the study.  
Independent monitoring visits occur at specified intervals determined by [CONTACT_531085].  Independent monitoring meetings occur 
annually or more often as determined by [CONTACT_531086] (see DSMB charter.)  
 
 
Definitions:  
Adverse Event  - Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered 
a pharmaceutical product, medical treatment or procedure and which does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment.   An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal product, medical treatment or procedure whether or not considered related to the 
medicinal product.  
 Life- threatening Adverse Event  – Any adverse event that places the patient or subject, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.   
 Unexpected Adverse Event  – An adverse event is “unexpected” when its nature (specificity), severity, or 
frequency are not consistent with (a) the known or foreseeable risk of adverse events associated with the research procedures described in the Protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol, informed consent document and other relevant sources of information such as product labeling 
and package inserts; and are also not consistent with (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied including the expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder or condition any 
predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  – Any adverse event occurring that results in any of the following outcomes:

 Attribution - The following are definitions for determining whether an adverse event is related to a medical 
product, treatment or procedure:  
• An adverse event is “ related or possibly related to the research procedures “if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_104271], it was more likel y than not caused by [CONTACT_28821].  
• Adverse events that are solely caused by [CONTACT_113363], disorder or condition of the subject 
or by [CONTACT_113364], disorder or 
condition of the subject are not “related or possibly related.”   
• If there is any question whether or not  an adverse event is related or possibly related, the adverse 
event should be reported.  
 
The Cancer Consortium Expedited Reporting Form should be completed for all adverse events that meet 
the expedited reporting requirements.  The AE form should be faxed t o the IRO at (206) 667- 6831.  All 
available information should be submitted.

Serious Adverse Events (SAE).  We will contact [CONTACT_531087], [ADDRESS_689588] Fred Hutch DSMP .  As Coordinating Center , Fred Hutch will complete the 
Fred Hutch/UW Cancer Consortium Expedited Reporting Form for all adverse events, including those associated with participants enrolled from the participating consortium centers.   Ad hoc meetings will be 
called by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_531042], for two similar Adverse Events, or at any time by [CONTACT_531088] a data or participant safety concern.  A physician member of the research project will provide 
the medical monitoring for all adverse events.  Adver se events and SAE will be reviewed annually by [CONTACT_531089].  
 
The Study Coordinator continually monitors patient report data and prepares weekly updates of project 
activity for the investigators.  R isks related to the study that are expected or seen previously in similar 
studies include i ncreased distress, complaints that the study material makes the participant feel worse by 
[CONTACT_531090], or complaints that assessments are too long.  Immediate contact [CONTACT_531091] a participant and psychological support is available if  any complaints are received.  Historically, with the

discussion or withdrawing the participant from the study. Serious adverse events which could possibly be 
related to the study include: a) complaints of intrusiveness or violation of privacy from the study (not just 
choosing to drop out of the study), b) anger, threats of harm or legal action against the study or a person, c) 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_531043], or d) physical harm as a result of a participant’s health care 
provider following the screening guidelines and ordering a test that causes  the participant harm.  
 
The following steps will occur in documenting adverse events for this study:  
1. For any adverse event that is Serious,  Unexpected, and Possibly Related to the study, the Investigator, 
or other study personnel who first becomes aware  of the event will complete the Adverse Event form 
and will fax it to the PI, [CONTACT_83677]  within 48 hours.  FAX:  206- 667-4356 (confidential secure fax).  If [CONTACT_531098]  is unavailable, [CONTACT_531099], as Project Director, will perform her activities.  
2. The PI t ogether with the investigator(s) who observed or reported the adverse event will assess causal 
relationship between the study procedures and the adverse event.  They will also assess severity at this 
time.  This will be done within 48 hours after notificat ion of Serious Adverse Events, and within 7 days 
for all other adverse events.   
At this time, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_531044] a Response  Plan  for follow -up of the adverse event, determining:  
0 = No further response to the participant is needed.  
1 = Investigator told of event should follow -up to assure event has been adequately treated.  
2 = Further recommendations need to be offered to the participant and who will follow -up to provide 
these recommendations.  
3 = Additional treatment is needed, treatment recommendations a re defined and an Investigator is 
designated to facilitate finding treatment if the participant is willing.  
4 = If participant or other person’s safety is in question, the PI/Project Director will determine whether 
a treating physician needs to be contact[CONTACT_531092].  If so, an Investigator will be 
designated to make that contact [CONTACT_531093] -up to determine the outcome.  
A notation will be made as to whether the adverse event resulted in the patient terminating the study.

50 participants will consent but will not be eligible for randomization due to incomplete baseline assessment.   
Randomization.  Those with one or more targeted complications will be randomized to one of 2 arms  (Group 
1).  Those without targeted complications will be separately  randomized to one of 2 arms  (Group 0) .  We 
expect approximately  [ADDRESS_689595] sufficient power for each of t he two primary endpoints, we will 
need to enroll 197 participants for the elevated distress  outcome  and 239 for the cardiometabolic non-
adherence. Participants who do not qualify for analysis of either  primary endpoint (Group 0) will be 
important for inclusion in secondary analyses and will also be randomized to intervention vs. control arms.  
Based on our experience in the previous internet grant, we project a loss of about 28% in the course of the 
study implementation from consent to 12- month assessment, 8% from mortality or severe medical 
problems.  With [ADDRESS_689596] established a minimum, abbreviated set of forms that provide primary and 
secondary outcomes (CTXD, H CA, PHQ -8).  Assessment programming will set parameters for allowable 
responses and will r eturn responders to items either missed or outside range, with an option to click a ‘choose 
not to respond’ box.  Validity checks will also be programmed to flag responses that are markedly inconsistent 
and may be invalid.  Outliers will be identified and sent to the [CONTACT_103529] and the mPIs to determine whether clinical 
response is needed.  The mPIs  will be notified and will contact a participant if validity seems questionable.  
They  will assure that the participant personally completed the items and is cogniti vely capable of responding.  
In the past this has occurred only rarely, less than 1% of the time.  A second level of flagging will occur when 
depression responses indicate severe depression, as we expect 2% of assessments.  In these cases,  the 
Project Manager  will notify [CONTACT_103529].  The Project Manager’s  data will be coded without names and [CONTACT_103529] will 
decode these.  
Programming will provide for calculation of summary scores and data will be routinely downloaded to a project 
database.  The Statistician will ex amine distributions for normality (e.g., outliers, skewness) and conduct 
appropriate transformations or category coding if distributions are non- normal.  When data cleanup is 
complete, all files will be merged into a project database.  The project database and all data collection, 
analysis, and storage will be maintained at the Coordinating Center .  No study data will be maintained at the 
consortium sites.

Protocol, version 6/06/ 2022  
Page 24 of 34 The primary endpoints to be evaluated for the above hypotheses are CTXD (distress) and HCA -cardio .  The 
primary and secondary endpoints for the study will be defined as binary outcomes.  Participants will qualify 
for analysis of a particular endpoint if they meet eligibility at their baseline response for that endpoint (CTXD 
≥0.9 or HCA -cardio<80%  [primary endpoints] , or HCA -cancer <80%  [secondary endpoint] , PHQ -8 score 
>10).  Some partici pants will contribute to both primary endpoint analyses, and others to none  or one .   
Similar conditional analyses will be carried out for the secondary endpoints. Stepped- care telehealth will be 
introduced based on PRO assessed at 6 -weeks , then s hort term outcomes will be assessed after 3 months  
and delayed or sustained effects will be assessed at 1 year.   
 
Primary Hypothesis  
Aim 1 : Among HCT survivors with poor health care adherence to cardiometabolic or subsequent 
malignancy surveillance and/or elevated cancer -related distress, determine the impact of a patient -centered, 
self-management stepped care program compared to an active control group provided access to HCT 
survivorship best practices.  
Hypothesis 1 : Participants with elevated canc er-related distress or poor health care adherence who receive 
the stepped care program will report reduced distress, and improved health care adherence for 
cardiometabolic or subsequent malignancy surveillance  at 12 months when compared to controls.  
 
Secondary Hypotheses  
Aim 2 : Determine characteristics of intervention participants who require telehealth stepped care at 6 -
weeks . 
Hypothesis 2 : Characteristics of intervention arm participants at the 6 -week  interim assessment who 
require telehealth stepped care because they 1) do not meet criteria for adequate knowledge of 
cardiometabolic risks, or 2) do not report improved distress, or 3) have not logged in to the online program 
will include those with higher depression or distress scores at baseline, more health care barriers at 
baseline, age 70+ years, male sex, people of color, lower income and education.  
Aim 3 : Determine resources  that would be needed to sustain the intervention as a national HCT 
survivo rship program if implemented through the CIBMTR//NMDP.  
 
Primary Endpoint Tests of the Specific Aim s  
Hypothesis [ADDRESS_689597] to enroll a total of 492  subjects in order to attain the 197 and 239 
participants needed to meet eligibility criteria for Group 1 randomization and inclusion in the intervention 
vs. control arm analyses of the 2 primary outcomes: dichotomous CTXD and cardiac HCA outcomes, 
respectively (some will be eligible for more than o ne).  Among these, we estimate that [ADDRESS_689598] a minimum relative risk of success for the intervention arm vs. the control arm of 1.9for the CTXD  and for the HCA -cardio endpoints, with 8 0% 
power and two- sided α=0.025 for each comparison (α=0.05/ 2 = 0.025 to conserve overall α=0.05).  For 
evaluation of the continuous versions of the outcomes, we will have at least 80% power to detect a minimum effect size of 0.52 , and 0.47  for the CTXD  andHCA -cardio outcomes, respectively (α=0.025 for 
each).

Analysis P lan for Hypothesi s 1  
The primary endpoints to 
be evaluated for 
hypothesis 1 are distress 
score (CTXD) and the 
proportion of HCA -cardio 
within the past 12 months 
as reported on the HCA 
and will be defined as 
binary outcomes.  
Participants will meet the 
primary endpoint for lack  of 
distress if they score <0.[ADDRESS_689599] 12 
months is ≥80% .  The number and pattern of missing variables will be summarized and assessed to 
understand potential biases.  If attrition is greater than 10% before the [ADDRESS_689600] of 
missing data on the comparisons between study ar ms.[173] 
For Hypothesis 1, the two primary endpoints, evaluated at the 12- month time point among the subjects 
identified at baseline as impaired for that particular endpoint criteria will each be compared between 
study arms as intent to treat analyses using standard logistic regression anal yses, adjusted for cancer 
center and utilizing a two -sided α=0.[ADDRESS_689601] 
analyses for those  factors.  Secondary analyses will evaluate depression alone, a PHQ -8 score > 10 
(essentially a subset of those with distress) and HCA -cancer in a similar manner as carried out for the 
primary endpoints.  Continuous versions of the tests comprising the prim ary and secondary endpoints 
using linear regression models as well as adjusting or stratifying on engagement with the intervention 
(viewing at least 3 pages of the online program or completing telehealth calls)  will also be carried out .  
Assumptions regarding normality of the outcomes  will be assessed, although examination of outcomes 
in preliminary data suggests this is a reasonable assumption, with no significant skew in the 
distributions.   If assumptions are not met, appropriate transformations will be i mplemented or alternative 
methods explored (e.g. non- parametric methods ). 
 
Hypothesis 2  
Characteristics of intervention arm participants at the 6-week interim assessment who require telehealth 
stepped care because they 1) do not meet criteria for adequate knowledge of subsequent malignancy  
and cardiometabolic risks, or 2) do not report improved distress, or 3) have not logged in to the online 
program wi ll include those with higher depression or distress scores at baseline, more health care 
barriers at baseline, age 70+ years, male sex, people of color, lower income and education.  
 
Analysis Plan for Hypothes is 2 
Among subjects in Group 0 and Group 1 inter vention arms, we will define the endpoint as a binary 
indicator of whether the individual required telehealth stepped care at the 6-week  time point.  We plan to 
use generalized linear models to evaluate associations between patient characteristic variables  and 
likelihood of stepped care.  Variables to be examined include age (<70 vs. 70+ years) , sex, 
race/ethnicity (White non -Hispanic vs. Non -White or Hispanic, income (<$40,000 vs. $40,000 per year) 
and education (college graduate yes/no), PHQ8 depression > 16, and Barriers to HCA > 0.45. The need 
for telehealth stepped care is not likely to be a rare event (rare being <10%) and thus odds ratios from a logistic regression model would not be good approximations of the relative risk (RR).  Therefore, rather  CTXD  HCA -

variance estimates to directly estimate the more interpretable RR. [173]  A multivariable model will be 
established using single- variable and step- up and step -down procedures with a liberal p- value for 
inclusion in the model (p<0.2).  Factors identified as significantly ( p<0.05) associated with the need for 
telehealth stepped care will be examined and based on the magnitude of the RR estimate and the 
prevalence of the particular patient characteristic, we will similarly examine indicators of response to the 
telehealth care based on continuous primary endpoints in that subgroup.  This will establish a profile of 
types of survivors for whom modified approaches to care may be beneficial.  
 
Aim [ADDRESS_689603] survivorship 
program if implemented through the CIBMTR/ NMDP.  
This is a descriptive aim defining costs and resource requirements .  Data relevant to resource utilization 
(costs) and methods of collection are described in section 8.[ADDRESS_689604], similar to the method described by [CONTACT_531094].[171, 172]  The costs of maintaining the various components of the program, relative to their use, will 
be calculated separately for those in the Group 0 and 1 intervention arms, specific to maintaining the 
social media site, the internet program, and the telehealth calls (Group 1 only) relative to the number of 
participants using those components among intervention participants.  
 
Secondary Analyses   
Secondary endpoints will include depression, process measures describing internet  study reach and 
utilization, as well as outcomes of knowledge of survivorship needs.  We will compare secondary outcomes 
knowledge of health care needs  between study arms using similar analytic methods as for the primary 
outcomes (both binary and continuous outcomes).   We will also carry out subset analyses within stratum 
defined by [CONTACT_531095] (i.e. more than one page viewed of internet site – see 
below for alternate definiti ons), and receipt of the phone calls if designated, to evaluate whether, among 
“users”, the tailored intervention has stronger effects.  
Further analyses will identify risk factors for disparities in survivorship H CA in HCT  survivors. Study reach, 
adoption and attrition process measures will be reported descriptively.  
Primary analyses will be based on 12 month outcome measurements, but we will utilize the 3 month time 
point in secondary longitudinal analyses modeled after those carried out in DuHamel et al. [30]  Additional 
secondary analyses will include evaluation of the impact of the internet  intervention on continuous versions 
of the primary endpoints, but among all participants randomized, including those not meeting criteria for 
inclusion in primary analyses.  This will provide estimates of the impact of study intervention on an 
unscreened population which would be a likely dissemination methodology.  
 
12.9 Process Descriptive Analyses  
Evaluation of the telehealth self -management calls will be based on 1) fidelity scored from audiotape 
reviews, 2) coach ratings, 3) completion rates of scheduled calls and 4) completion of action plans, and 5) 
barriers identified during calls.  Additional descriptive analyses will be conducted on the process elements 
defined in section 8.4 Process Measures.

Survivors in the intervention group will complete the intervention approximately 12 months after beginning 
(i.e., the date the patient received notification of randomization and website access).  After completing the 
12-month  assessment, they will receive notification that they have completed participation in the study.  
Survivors will continue to have full access to the website after their official study participation has ended 
until the end of the study.  
Survivors in the control (delayed internet site access) group will have full internet program  access from the 
time they complete the 12-month  assessment until the end of the study.  
Survivors may withdraw from the study whenever they request to do so.

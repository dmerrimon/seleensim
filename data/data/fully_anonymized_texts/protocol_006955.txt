2PRECIS
Background:
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is an angiocentric destructive proliferation of 
lymphoid cells predominantly involving the lungs, skin, kidneys, and central nervous 
system.  
It is divided into three grades, depending on the degree of necrosis and cellular atypia.  
The grades of disease are histologically-based and do not necessarily correlate with 
clinical outcome.  However, like other EBV related LPD’s, LYG can transform into an 
aggressive large B-cell lymphoma, which would be included within the grade 3 category.  
It is important to note that not all grade 3 lesions are a large B-cell lymphoma.  
Current evidence shows that LYG is a disease of B cells. 
Objectives:
To determine the response and long-term efficacy of alpha-Interferon in patients with 
lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG).
To determine the response and long-term efficacy of dose-adjusted (DA)-EPOCH-R 
chemotherapy in patients with grade [ADDRESS_980198] failed interferon
Eligibility:
Patients must have a tissue diagnosis of grade 1, 2 and/or 3 LYG (or a diagnosis 
consistent with LYG) confirmed by [CONTACT_22662], NCI. 
Patients with any stage of disease will be eligible.
Previously untreated and treated patients are eligible.       
Patients age 12 or older will be eligible.
Design:
Interferon is used as initial treatment in patients with grades [ADDRESS_980199] CR.  
Patients who progress after or during interferon, and patients with grade 3 LYG will 
receive aggressive combination chemotherapy with DA-EPOCH-R (rituximab, etoposide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and prednisone).  
Patients who fail one treatment approach may be crossed over to the other.  
A total of 105 patients will be enrolled at this single institution.

To assess overall survival (OS)
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) is an angiocentric destructive proliferation of lymphoid 
cells predominantly involving the lungs, skin, kidneys, and central nervous system (1).  Although 
the disease has been considered to be a reactive or vasculitic disease and not a neoplastic 
process, the 5-year survival of the initial series of patients was less than 50% with the use of 
corticosteroids and other conservative treatment approaches. Lethal midline granuloma (LMG) 
or midline malignant reticulosis is another angiocentric destructive lymphoproliferative process 
usually involving the sinuses or upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] (2).  Some 10 years ago DeRemee, et al. 
noted similarities between LYG and LMG and hypothesized that they were the same disease 
(3).  Jaffe proposed a common pathological description for both lesions, and called them 
angiocentric immunoproliferative lesions (AIL) (4).
Clinical experience with AIL has identified a spectrum of natural histories for the disease and 
recently, histopathological correlations have emerged (5,6).  Cytologic and architectural features, 
based on the degree of cell atypia, extent of the inflammatory background and cellular necrosis, 
Abbreviated Title:  Treatment and Nat. Hx. LYG
Version Date:  01/27/[ADDRESS_980204] been used to divide AIL into three histological grades (6).  Grade I lesions are composed of 
angiocentric infiltrates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes with or without 
eosinophils.  Large lymphoid cells are rare and when present show no cellular atypia.  Necrosis 
is uncommon and the lymphocytes are nearly normal in appearance.  In grade II lesions, 
cytologic atypia of the small infiltrating lymphocytes is more prominent, large lymphoid cells 
without atypia are common, and necrosis is frequently present.  Grade III lesions are actual 
angiocentric lymphomas based on the monomorphism of the infiltrate, cytologic atypia in both 
the small and large lymphocytes, appreciable necrosis, and significantly less apparent 
background polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate.
Immunophenotypic examination of AIL shows the predominant cell to be a mature, post-thymic 
T cell with CD4 expressed on the cell surface.  In grade I and II lesions, clonal rearrangement of 
the T-cell receptor gene is essentially never seen, and has only rarely been reported in grade III 
lesions (6,7).  The lack of clonal T-cell gene rearrangements in grade III lesions is paradoxical 
because cytologically, they are malignant T-cell lymphomas.  A number of explanations have 
been proposed for this, including hypotheses that the malignant T-cells may have rearrangements 
of some other, as yet unidentified, T-cell receptor, or that the truly malignant cells comprise a 
small percentage of the total cellular infiltrate.  However, analyses of EBV in biopsies suggest 
that it may play a role in the progression of grade I and II to grade III AIL (malignant 
lymphoma) (8).  In biopsies from 7 patients with grade I and II AIL, EBV-positive cells were 
rare or absent, while all 5 patients with grade III AIL had large numbers of cells containing EBV 
RNA.  Furthermore, EBV was clonally integrated in two patients in whom it was checked (7).   
More recently, there is evidence that LMG and LYG are patho-physiologically distinct diseases 
which involve different cell types.  In LMG, immunohistochemical analysis shows expression of 
peripheral T cell antigens with occasionally coexpression of the natural killer (NK) cell marker, 
CD56 in the malignant cells (9).  This disease is now felt to be a T-cell lymphoma derived from 
peripheral T cells expressing gamma-delta chains or from NK cells.  In contrast, there is 
evidence that LYG is a disease of B cells.  Immunohistochemical and PCR analysis of biopsies 
from 3 patients with LYG demonstrated that EBV was integrated into B-cells but not the T-cells, 
suggesting that LYG is an EBV-positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorder (Jaffe, unpublished 
observation).  
Jaffe, et al. examined the clinical course of patients presenting to the National Institutes of 
Health with AIL of various histologic grades (6).  Patients with grade I/II lesions were usually 
managed with cyclophosphamide/ prednisone, and patients with grade III lesions were treated 
with aggressive combination chemotherapy.  Twenty-three patients were included in this report, 
nine with grade I, six with grade II, and eight with grade III lesions.  The eight patients with 
grade III lesions were further categorized according to the Working Formulation for lymphomas: 
six diffuse mixed (DML), one diffuse large cell (DL), and one diffuse large cell immunoblastic 
(IBL).  Lung was the most common site of involvement (13 of 23 patients) and there were no 
differences in anatomical distribution among the three histologic grades. Seven of nine grade I 
patients achieved CR with cyclophosphamide/ prednisone and 5/7 required no further 
therapy.  The two patients who failed to achieve CR rapi[INVESTIGATOR_718458], 
while 2/7 responders progressed to lymphoma from 2-4 years after diagnosis and died.  Thus, 
cyclophosphamide/prednisone was curative in only 55% of patients with grade I AIL.  Of the six 
patients with grade II AIL, 3 achieved an initial CR with cyclophosphamide/prednisone, but 4 of 
the 6 developed malignant lymphoma within a median of 12 months from diagnosis; only one of 
Abbreviated Title:  Treatment and Nat. Hx. LYG
Version Date:  01/27/[ADDRESS_980205], 7 of 8 patients with 
grade III patients are in CR after combination chemotherapy + radiation therapy at a median of 7 
years.  Thus, this study suggests that patients with grade III AIL (lymphoma) benefit from 
aggressive combination chemotherapy, while patients with grade I or II do not benefit from less 
aggressive chemotherapy.  
Because the treatment of grade I/II AIL with cyclophosphamide/ prednisone has been 
disappointing, some investigators have advocated the use of aggressive combination 
chemotherapy.  However, there are several concerns with this approach.  First, there are no 
controlled studies of the use of aggressive combination chemotherapy in grade I/II AIL.  
Furthermore, patients with grade II AIL who progressed to grade III disease had a poor response 
to aggressive chemotherapy.  Second, grade I/II AIL is not a clonal disease and is associated with 
immuno-suppression (low CD-4 counts), which may be exacerbated by [CONTACT_718472].  
A major shortcoming of these studies is that they did not distinguish LMG from LYG.  
Pathologically, LMG is a malignant lymphoma of T cell or NK cell origin and should be treated 
with combination chemotherapy.  In contrast, preliminary evidence suggests that LYG is an EBV 
positive B cell lymphoproliferative disorder which occurs in a partially immunocompromised 
host. Interferon offers a rational treatment approach for LYG because it has both anti-
proliferative and anti-viral activity.  Recently, we have had anecdotal experience with the 
treatment of grades I/II LYG with alpha-interferon.  Eighteen months ago, a 21-year-old man 
with grade II LYG developed progressive pulmonary nodules 2 months after completing CHOP 
(cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) chemotherapy.   The patient 
entered a complete remission after 6 months of interferon therapy (10 x 106 units 3 x week) and 
continues in remission on interferon.  Three additional patients with grade II LYG are receiving 
interferon for 7, [ADDRESS_980206] CR.  Patients who progress after or during interferon, 
and patients with grade 3 LYG will receive aggressive combination chemotherapy with DA-
EPOCH-R (rituximab, etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and prednisone).  
Extensive experience with EPOCH in relapsed and refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma has 
shown it to be very well tolerated and effective (10).  Patients who relapse after DA-EPOCH-R 
may be treated with interferon providing they do not relapse with an aggressive large B-cell 
lymphoma.  
The recent approval of rituximab (humanized monoclonal antibody for treatment of CD20 
positive B-cell malignancies) provides a potential new treatment for LYG.  Early experience 
with this agent in post-transplant LPD has shown anecdotal responses (11-13).  For patients who 
fail interferon, rituximab may provide an important new treatment. Furthermore, it has been 
shown in vitro, that rituximab may increase the efficacy of chemotherapy, and clinical data 
suggests high activity and reversal of clinical drug resistance with the addition of rituximab to 
EPOCH (14-15).  We currently have a protocol of DA-EPOCH, as administered in the present 
trial, with rituximab administered on the first day of each cycle, prior to beginning the infusions.  
Preliminary data in relapsed patients has shown this to be an effective regimen (14-15).  For 
patients who fail to achieve a durable remission with interferon and chemotherapy, there are no 
clearly effective treatments. Thus, we wish to be able to treat such patients with rituximab alone 
or with interferon, as clinically appropriate.  In some of these cases, the patients will have

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
Please note that this protocol was on Administrative Hold from October 17, 2016 through 
February 8, 2017. Amendment AA serves as the formal notification to the IRB of the 
Administrative Hold. During the time the protocol was on Administrative Hold, no new patients 
were enrolled; however, patients who were on-study were followed per protocol. 
3.1 TREATMENT WITH A LPHA I NTERFERON 
Grade 1 and 2 LYG will be initially treated with interferon-2b.  However, in rare 
circumstances, patients with advanced and symptomatic grade 2 LYG may be treated with DA-
EPOCH-R, at the discretion of the PI, if they require a rapid clinical response.   Interferon will be 
started at 7.5 x 106 Units subcutaneously (sc) three times per week (TIW).  Interferon dose can 
be escalated every 1-2 weeks, if no grade 3 or 4 toxicity (excluding fever) is observed and it is 
clinically tolerated (i.e. fatigue), on the following schedule: 10 x 106 U; 15 x 106 U; 20 x 106 U; 
25 x 106; and increased in 5 x 106 U increments as clinically indicated, thereafter.  If a patient 
develops grade 3 toxicity (except hematological and fever) or has intolerable fatigue, the dose 
will be reduced one to two dose levels.  If a patient develops grade 4 toxicity (except 
hematological), interferon will be stopped until toxicity recovers to < grade 2 and then interferon 
may be restarted at 50% of the last dose.  If patient develops grade [ADDRESS_980213] 
treatment with filgrastim (e.g. 300 ug TIW) may be used to increase neutrophil count.  Patients 
with thrombocytopenia or anemia may be supported as clinically indicated with transfusions. If 
the toxicity does not resolve to < grade 2 (except hematological) within 4 weeks, interferon will 
be permanently discontinued.  
Interferon treatment duration: Patients who enter a complete remission/stable residual 
abnormalities will receive interferon for 12 months beyond reaching this state.  Patients with 
progressive disease will cross-over to receive DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy as outlined in 
Section 3.2. 
3.2 TREATMENT WITH DA-EPOCH-R  
Patients with grade 3 LYG and patients who progress on interferon will be treated with: DA-
EPOCH-R chemotherapy.  However, in rare circumstances, patients with advanced and 
symptomatic grade 2 LYG may be treated with DA-EPOCH-R at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_718460] a rapid clinical response. Patients who achieve a CR/stable residual 
abnormalities will be followed.  However, patients who achieve a PR (clear disease present) with 
DA-EPOCH-R will receive interferon beginning [ADDRESS_980214] dose of chemotherapy 
according to the algorithm in Section 3.1.   
3.2.1 DA-EPOCH-R treatment duration

Administer cyclophosphamide immediately after infusion is completed on day 5. 
Repeat cycles every 3 weeks (21 days). 
NOTE:  DA-EPOCH-R infusional drugs should be administered through a central venous 
access device.
3.3 PROGRESSION WHILE ON TREATMENT
Patients who progress on the protocol treatment with interferon and/or DA-EPOCH-R or another 
doxorubicin-based regimen may be treated with standard therapy to include rituximab.  Patients 
who receive rituximab will be treated with a standard dose of 375 mg/m2 IV.  When given

on this study as the vehicle for this treatment so that we can obtain pi[INVESTIGATOR_718461].
3.4 DOSE ADJUSTMENTS
Goals and General Strategy:  The aim is to maximize DA-EPOCH-R dose-intensity while 
minimizing toxicity. Drug doses may be modified for severe toxicity either manifests on day 1 or 
occurring during the previous cycle and resolved by [CONTACT_4475] 1 of the next cycle. The rules for either 
eventuality are described separately below. When two different rules give different answers for a 
particular dose decision, use the lower of the two dose options. The rules are for events that 
occur during the preceding cycle.
3.5 HEMATOLOGIC DOSE-ADJUSTMENT PARADIGM
Dose adjustments above starting dose level (level 1) apply to etoposide, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide
Dose adjustments below starting dose level (level 1) apply to cyclophosphamide only.  
Drug Doses based on previous cycle ANC nadir:
If Nadir ANC  500/l on all measurements:           [ADDRESS_980216] cycle 
If Nadir ANC  500/l on 1 or 2 measurements:        Same dose level as last cycle  
If Nadir ANC  500/l  3 measurements:               [ADDRESS_980217] cycle
Or

If ANC  1000/l and platelets  100,000/ l on day 21, begin treatment.
If ANC < 1000/l or platelets ≤  100,000/l on day 21, delay up to 1 week.  G-CSF may 
be started for ANC < 1000/l and stopped 24 hours before treatment.  If counts still low

3.6 NEUROLOGIC AND HEPATIC DOSE ADJUSTMENT PARADIGM
3.6.1 Ileus
Constipation commonly occurs in patients receiving vincristine, so patients should receive stool 
softeners as indicated.  Occasionally, symptomatic ileus may occur, and this should be treated 
with a vincristine dose reduction.  Because the severity of ileus is dose related, it is usually not 
necessary to stop the vincristine altogether.  Furthermore, because the therapy administered in 
this study is potentially curative, every effort should be made to avoid unnecessarily reducing 
vincristine doses.  The following guidelines for symptomatic ileus on a previous cycle should be 
followed:
Clinical ileus < 8 days with abdominal pain requiring narcotics and/or persistent nausea/vomiting 
>2 days: Reduce vincristine dose 25%.
Clinical ileus 8-12 days with abdominal pain requiring narcotics and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting > 2 days: Reduce vincristine dose 50%.
Clinical ileus > 12 days with abdominal pain requiring narcotics and/or persistent 
nausea/vomiting > 2 days: Hold vincristine on next cycle.  May restart at 50% reduction on 
subsequent cycle.

Side effects of rituximab may be infusion rate related and may be reduced by [CONTACT_151211]. Thus, dose reductions of rituximab will not be made for rate 
related reactions. Rituximab will be discontinued in patients with grade 4 allergic reactions.  
Patients who develop significant skin toxicity including mucositis and/or diffuse rash felt 
secondary to rituximab and at risk of toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_718462]. Patients will be given a

Death.
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
4.1 PROPHYLAXIS OF PNEUMOCYSTIS JIROVECI (FORMERLY PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII) 
Adult patients will receive prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Jiroveci during EPOCH 
chemotherapy. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 1 DS P.O. QD for three days each 
week. Monday, Wednesday, Friday is the preferred schedule. Children ages 12-17 
receive the same Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole dose as adults.
Patients allergic to either component may receive inhaled pentamidine [ADDRESS_980224] treatments.
4.2 CNS  TREATMENT GUIDELINES
Patients with Grade 1, 2 or 3 leptomeningeal LYG without transformation to a large B-cell 
lymphoma who are receiving interferon will be monitored every 2-4 weeks after the start of 
interferon by [CONTACT_718477]/or brain scan until evidence of resolving disease.  If there are no 
progressive neurological signs or symptoms and evidence of resolving CNS disease, patients 
may be followed without intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation as appropriate.  Intrathecal 
chemotherapy and/or radiation will be used in patients receiving interferon with evidence of 
disease progression in the CNS, patients receiving interferon who at the investigators discretion 
are felt to have neurological symptoms (based on severity and duration of symptoms) warranting 
cytotoxic/radiation treatment, patients with evidence of aggressive lymphoma in the CNS and 
Abbreviated Title:  Treatment and Nat. Hx. LYG
Version Date:  01/27/2021
18patients receiving DA-EPOCH-R chemotherapy.
4.2.1 Guidelines for intrathecal treatment: Patients will initially receive monotherapy with 
methotrexate and/or cytarabine.  
Doses for IT therapy are methotrexate 12 mg or cytarabine 70 mg. 
Doses for Ommaya therapy are methotrexate 6 mg or cytarabine 70 mg. 
4.2.2 Due to unforeseeable events, the above therapy may be modified as clinically indicated.  
All decisions should be discussed with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_718463]. 
4.2.3 Treatment Schedule: Induction: Twice weekly for 2 weeks beyond negative cytology or 
FACS, for a minimum of 4 weeks (obtain CSF for cytology and flow cytometry weekly); 
Consolidation- Weekly for 6 weeks (obtain CSF for cytology weekly); Maintenance- 
Monthly for 6 months (obtain CSF for cytology and flow cytometry monthly).
4.2.4 Radiation treatment: Patients who have progressive disease on intrathecal chemotherapy 
and/or have parenchymal lesions may receive radiation treatment.  
4.3 MONITORING AND TREATMENT TO PREVENTHEPATITIS B REACTIVATION
Patients who are positive for either Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) or Hepatitis B surface 
antigen (HBsAg) and not acutely infected are at varying risk for reactivation of Hepatitis B when 
treated with DA-EPOCH-R.  Patients with prior hepatitis B exposure may be included in the 
study provided that they have HBV DNA levels below the World Health Organization’s cutoff of 
100 IU/mL prior to starting therapy. These patients will be treated with entecavir (or equivalent) 
to prevent hepatitis B reactivation and should have HBV DNA levels obtained monthly for at 
least [ADDRESS_980225] 10 IU/mL.
If the HBV DNA assay becomes positive during DA-EPOCH-R, study treatment should be held, 
and the patient should be immediately referred to a gastroenterologist or hepatologist for 
management recommendations.
If a patient’s HBV DNA level exceeds 100 IU/mL while the patient is receiving antiviral

5.[ADDRESS_980227] patients may be created which will be 
used as antigen-presenting cells to be used for other studies in the future.   Additional studies 
may be done on these samples that are related to understanding the pathogenesis of LYG and its 
treatment providing those studies are of minimal risk to the patients.  If the studies are not of

Version Date:  01/27/[ADDRESS_980228] quality tissue for translational investigation.  Consideration 
of alternative biopsy methods (e.g., core needle biopsy) will only be made if follow-up 
excisional biopsy is not possible/safe or patient is unwilling to undergo repeat excisional biopsy. 
These biopi[INVESTIGATOR_718464].
In the event that a surgical biopsy procedure is performed, more than one lesion and at more than 
one anatomic site may be collected, provided the additional procedures are not unacceptable risk 
to the patient.  In the event of core needle biopsy, these are obtained typi[INVESTIGATOR_426394] a 16-18G 
needle at the discretion of the provider performing the procedure.  Conscious sedation may be 
used, if warranted, and the use and risks are acceptable to the patient.  
Potential site(s) of biopsy include, but are not limited to:  bone marrow lesions, bony lesions, 
extramedullary disease/masses, and lymph nodes.  The type of procedure to be done and manner 
in which it will proceed (e.g., excision/core, single vs. multiple sites of biopsy) will be discussed 
with the patient prior to the biopsy procedure.  The patient will be reminded that all sampling for 
research is voluntary.
If the patient agrees to the optional biopsy, he/she will sign a procedure consent at the time of the 
procedure.  If the patient refuses the optional biopsy, the refusal will be documented in the 
medical record and in the research record.
5.3.2 Processing and Handling
All samples will be handled/processed as per routine processes applicable to the type of sample 
(e.g., formalin fixation, snap frozen, and/or single-cell preparation).  It is anticipated that all 
samples will go through NCI Laboratory of Pathology for review/processing prior to release for 
research analyses.
5.3.3 Analysis 
Analysis of fresh tissue and/or paraffin blocks for in-situ hybridization for EBV; 
immunohistochemistry for B and T cell antigens; and isolate DNA for T-cell receptor and 
immunoglobulin gene rearrangements by [CONTACT_448621].

5.4 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system.  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed.  
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if 
required. 
All specimens obtained in the protocol are used as defined in the protocol.  Any specimens that 
are remaining at the completion of the protocol will be stored in the conditions described below 
for an indefinite amount of time. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_718465] a deviation. Reporting will be per the requirements of section 7.2.1. 
5.4.1 Procedures for stored blood specimens 
The Clinical Support Laboratory (CSL), Leidos Biomedical Research Inc.-Frederick, 
processes and cryopreserves samples in support of IRB-approved, NCI clinical trials.  All 
laboratory personnel with access to patient information annually complete the NIH online 
course in Protection of Human Subjects.  The laboratory is CLIA certified for CD4 
immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_718466] a Quality Assurance Plan 
with documented Standard Operating Procedures that are reviewed annually.  Laboratory 
personnel are assessed for competency prior to being permitted to work with patient 
samples.  Efforts to ensure protection of patient information include:
The laboratory is located in a controlled access building and laboratory doors are kept 
locked at all times. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by 
[CONTACT_79922].  
Hard copy records or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_138704].   
An electronic database is used to store information related to patient samples processed 
by [CONTACT_25699].  
The database resides on a dedicated program server that is kept in a central, locked 
computer facility.  
The facility is supported by [CONTACT_138761].  
Program access is limited to specified computers as designated by [CONTACT_151226].  Each of these computers has a password restricted login screen.  
The database sample entry program itself is accessed through a password protected entry 
screen.  
The database program has different levels of access approval to limit unauthorized 
changes to specimen records and the program maintains a sample history.  
Upon specimen receipt each sample is assigned a unique, sequential laboratory accession 
ID number.  All products generated by [CONTACT_138763] a central repository facility are identified by [CONTACT_138764].
Inventory information will be stored at the vial level and each vial will be labeled with 
Abbreviated Title:  Treatment and Nat. Hx. LYG
Version Date:  01/27/2021
22both a sample ID and a vial sequence number.  
Vial labels do not contain any personal identifier information.   
Samples are stored inventoried in locked laboratory freezers and are routinely transferred 
to the NCI-Frederick repository facilities for long term storage.    
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted.  Investigators establish sample collections 
under “Source Codes” and the investigator responsible for the collections, typi[INVESTIGATOR_151169], specifies who has access to the collection.  Specific 
permissions will be required to view, input or withdraw samples from a collection. 
Sample withdrawal requests submitted to approved laboratory staff by [CONTACT_138765].  
The repository facility will also notify the Source Code holder of any submitted requests 
for sample withdrawal.  
It is the responsibility of the Source Code holder (generally the NCI Principal 
Investigator) to ensure that samples requested and approved for withdrawal are being 
used in a manner consistent with IRB approval.  
The Clinical Support Laboratory does perform testing services that may be requested by 
[CONTACT_151227], but not limited to, immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_151170].  
When requests are submitted by [CONTACT_138766] a Material Transfer 
Agreement is in place that covers the specimen transfer.  The laboratory does not provide 
patient identifier information as part of the transfer process but may, at the discretion of 
the NCI investigator, group samples from individual patients when that is critical to the 
testing process.   
The NCI investigator responsible for the sample collection is responsible for ensuring 
appropriate IRB approvals are in place and that a Material Transfer Agreement has been 
executed prior to requesting the laboratory to ship samples outside of the NIH.

If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will 
provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about the patient’s 
outcome.
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable. 
Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breach in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, this will be reported expeditiously per 
requirements in section 7.2.1.
6.1.1 Special considerations for data collection/recording:
As the toxicity profile of EPOCH-R is well defined and published, grade 1 clinical 
adverse events will not be recorded in the database.  
All hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], regardless of reason, will be recorded in the database with the reason 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_718467]. 
Only the highest grade of each event during a cycle of treatment during EPOCH-R will 
be recorded in the database. 
All grade 2 events and above that occur while the patient is treated with interferon will be 
recorded. 
In certain circumstances, patients may stay on study and receive non-protocol therapy for 
a diagnosis other than LYG. In these cases, adverse events that are attributed to the non-
protocol therapy will not be collected.  
6.2 RESPONSE C RITERIA

8 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Initially, 15 patients each with Grade I/II and Grade III LYG may be enrolled in this study.  The 
first [ADDRESS_980236] their remission durations 
observed, and the proportions with durations exceeding 12 months will be noted.  If 9 patients in 
any group of 9 progress with the same disease grade (i.e. grades I/II or III) within 12 months, no 
additional patients beyond 15 will be entered into that group ([ADDRESS_980237] had a minimum of 12 months potential follow-up).  This will 
allow us to conclude with 95% confidence and power that the true proportion of patients with 
response durations exceeding 12 months is less than 30%.
If at least one of [ADDRESS_980238] remission duration > [ADDRESS_980239] 20%, with 95% power and confidence.
In order to have 60 evaluable patients enrolled on this protocol, the accrual ceiling will be 70 
patients to account for 10 non-evaluable patients.
All patients will be followed for survival and disease-free survival (among appropriately 
responding patients), with appropriate life-table analyses performed at the conclusion of the 
study.
Due to the rarity of this disease and its now recognized multiple subtypes (grade I, II and III), we 
wish to increase the number of patients overall in the series to a total of 85 patients.
Effective with Amendment Y (Version Date: 09/16/2014), the accrual ceiling is being increased 
by 5 to a total of 90 patients. This will allow for continuation of our ongoing work with the very 
complex LYG patients until we complete the development of the new protocol, which is in the 
early stages of development.
Effective with Amendment CC (Version Date: 06/10/2019), the accrual ceiling is being 
increased by [ADDRESS_980240] a new 
protocol testing novel agents that can be offered to these patients, but that protocol does not

period. Participants in both arms will undergo up to one (1) optional CT guided biopsy. The 
procedures for performing the CT and [18F]-FDG PET scans will follow clinical policies, no 
special procedures will apply to these assessments for research purposes.
The total radiation dose for research purposes will be approximately 12.4 rem for patient who 
receive Interferon. The total radiation dose for research purposes will be approximately 7.2 rem 
for patient who receive EPOCH-R. This amount is more than would be expected from everyday 
background radiation. Being exposed to excess radiation can increase the risk of cancer.
10.4.4 Risks of MRI:  
People are at risk for injury from the MRI magnet if they have some kinds of metal in their body. 
People with fear of confined spaces may become anxious during an MRI. Those with back 
problems may have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner.  The noise from the 
scanner is loud enough to damage hearing, especially in people who already have hearing loss. 
There are no known long-term risks of MRI scans.

(IV) catheter (small tube). It will be done for research purposes. 
The risks of an IV catheter include bleeding, infection, or inflammation of the skin and vein with 
pain and swelling.  There is also a risk of kidney damage from the use of gadolinium.

10.4.9 Bone Marrow Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]/ Biopsy
Bone marrow biopsy is minimally invasive and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] a very safe procedure. Usually the 
hipbone is numbed with anesthesia. Using a needle, the solid and liquid portion of bone marrow 
is taken out. This procedure causes some pain. Very rarely, infection or bleeding may occur at the 
needle site.
10.5 CONSENT AND ASSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided to the participant or consent designee(s) (e.g., 
the parent/guardian if participant is a minor, legally authorized representative [LAR] if 
participant is an adult unable to consent) for review prior to consenting.  A designated study 
investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time 
as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with 
friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study 
investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms) per discretion of the 
designated study investigator and with the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  
Whether in person or remote, the privacy of the subject will be maintained. Consenting 
investigators (and participant/consent designee, when in person) will be located in a private area 
(e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee 
will be informed of the private nature of the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a 
more private setting if needed.
With regard to the optional biopsy for research in the protocol, the patient will consent at the 
time of the procedure.  If the patient refuses the optional biopsy at that time, the refusal will be 
documented in the medical record and in the research record.
10.5.1 Consent Process for Adults Who Lack Capacity to Consent to Research Participation
For participants addressed in section 10.3, an LAR will be identified consistent with Policy 403 
and informed consent obtained from the LAR, as described in Section 10.5. 
10.5.2 Consent Process for Minors
Consent will be obtained from parent(s)/guardians of minor children as described in Section 
Where deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_83953]’s parent(s) or guardian, the child will 
also be included in all discussions about the trial and age-appropriate language will be used to 
describe the procedures and tests involved in this study, along with the risks, discomforts and 
benefits of participation. The assent process will take place in conjunction with consent; 
therefore, in person and remote assent are permitted under the same circumstances as in person 
and remote consent. Written assent will not be obtained from children as the study holds out the 
prospect of direct benefit that is important to the health and well-being of the child and is 
available only in the context of the research. Verbal assent will be obtained as appropriate for 
children ages 12-17. The consent/assent process will be documented in the child’s medical 
Abbreviated Title:  Treatment and Nat. Hx. LYG
Version Date:  01/27/[ADDRESS_980247], including the assessment of the child’s ability to provide assent (verbal versus written) as 
applicable.
All children will be contact[CONTACT_571181] [ADDRESS_980248] reaches age 18, continued participation (including ongoing interactions 
with the subject or continued analysis of identifiable data) will require that consent be obtained 
from of the now adult with the standard protocol consent document to ensure legally effective 
informed consent has been obtained. We request waiver of informed consent for those 
individuals who become lost to follow-up or who have been take off study prior to reaching the 
age of majority.
Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d):
(1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects.
a. Analysis of samples and data from this study involves no additional risks to 
subjects.
(2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects.
a. Retention of these samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects. 
(3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration.
a. Considering the length of time between the minor’s last contact [CONTACT_83954], it will likely be very difficult to locate them again. 
A significant reduction in the number of samples analyzed is likely to impact the 
quality of the research. 
(4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information 
after participation.
a. We only request a waiver of consent for those subjects who have been lost to 
follow-up or who have been taken off study prior to reaching the age of majority.

12.11.2   Storage
Rituximab for clinical use should be stored in a secure refrigerator at 2 to 8o C. 
12.11.3   Preparation
Rituximab will be diluted with 0.9% Sodium Chloride or 5% Dextrose Injection to prepare a 
standard product with concentration of 2 mg/ml.  Caution should be taken during the preparation 
of the drug, as shaking can cause aggregation and precipi[INVESTIGATOR_151176]. 
12.11.4   Stability
After dilution, rituximab is stable at 2-8 degrees C (36-46 degrees F) for 24 hours and at room 
temperature for an additional 24 hours. 
12.11.5   Administration
A peripheral or central intravenous line will be established. During rituximab infusion, a patient's 
vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature) should be monitored according to the 
standard of care. Medications readily available for the emergency management of anaphylactoid 
reactions should include: epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:1000, 1 mg/mL) for subcutaneous injection, 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride for intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment.
Prophylaxis against hypersensitivity and infusion-related reactions associated with rituximab will 
include acetaminophen [ADDRESS_980265] dose of 
prednisone 60 mg/m2 (or a glucocorticoid equivalent dose of an alternative steroid) at least 
60 minutes before rituximab treatment commences.
Rituximab will be administered as an intravenous infusion at 375 mg/m2 on day 1 of each cycle 
of EPOCH, immediately prior to starting etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine administration. 
Rituximab infusions will be administered to patients primarily in an outpatient clinic setting.  
First dose:
The initial dose rate at the time of the first rituximab infusion should be 50mg/hour (25 
mL/hr) for the first 30 minutes. If no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be escalated 
gradually in 50 mg/hour (25 mL/h) increments at 30 minute intervals) to a maximum of 400 
Abbreviated Title:  Treatment and Nat. Hx. LYG
Version Date:  01/27/2021
36mg/hour (maximum rate = 200 mL/h). 
Second and Subsequent Doses (select the appropriate administration timing):
90-minute Administration
If the first dose of rituximab was well tolerated, subsequent doses may be administered 
over 90 minutes with 20% of the total dose given in the first 30 minutes, and remaining 
80% of the total dose administered over the subsequent 60 minutes; e.g.:
Two-Step Rate Escalation Volume to administer (X mL)
1st portion (0 – 30 minutes)
2nd portion (30 – 90 minutes)
Special Note: The 90-minute infusion scheme is not recommended for patients with 
clinically significant cardiovascular disease or high circulating lymphocyte counts 
(≥5000/mcL).
Standard Administration for Second & Subsequent Infusions
Patients who tolerate initial treatment without experiencing infusion-related adverse 
effects but for whom the 90-minute infusion scheme during subsequent treatments is 
considered inappropriate, may receive subsequent rituximab doses at the Standard Rate 
for Subsequent Infusions, which is as follows:
Begin at an initial rate of 100 mg/hour (50 mL/h) for 30 minutes. If administration is well 
tolerated, the administration rate may be escalated gradually in 100-mg/hour (50-mL/h) at 
30-minute intervals to a maximum rate of 400 mg/hour (maximum rate = 200 mL/h).
CAUTION:  DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS.  
12.11.6   Toxicities
Common toxicities include fever, chills, nausea, asthenia, headache, angioedema, pruritis and 
rash.  Leukopenia occurs in approximately 10% but grade 3 or 4 neutropenia is uncommon. 
Hypotension occurred in 10% of patients during rituximab infusion, and serious bronchospasm 
and urticaria associated with rituximab infusion each occurred in fewer than 10% of patients. 
Less common toxicities include abdominal pain, vomiting, thrombocytopenia, anemia, myalgia, 
arthralgia, dizziness, and rhinitis. Bowel obstruction and perforation have been rarely reported. 
Skin reactions, some of them life threatening, have been noted in patients receiving rituximab.

3914 APPENDIX 1:  EPOCH ADMIXTURES: PREPARATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
Preparation: 
All 3-in-1 admixtures dispensed from the Pharmacy will contain a 24-hour supply of etoposide, 
doxorubicin, and vincristine, PLUS 40 mL overfill (excess) fluid and a proportional amount of 
drug to compensate for volume lost in parenteral product containers and administration set 
tubing.
Etoposide DoseVolume of Fluid 
Containing a Daily DoseVolume of Overfill
(fluid + drug)Total Volume in the Product
(including overfill)
< 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 568 mL
≥ 130 mg 1056 mL 40 mL 1096 mL
Before dispensing 3-in-1 admixtures, Pharmacy staff will:
[1] Purge all air from the drug product container,
[2] Attach an administration set appropriate for use with a portable pump,
[3] The set will be primed close to its distal tip, and
[4] The set will be capped with a Luer-locking cap.
Pre-printed product labeling will identify the ‘Total Volume To Infuse’ and the ‘Volume of 
Overfill (fluid + drug)’.
Bags will be exchanged daily for four consecutive days to complete a 96-hour drug infusion 
(unless treatment is interrupted or discontinued due to un-anticipated events).
Administration: 
Portable pumps used to administer etoposide + doxorubicin + vincristine admixtures will be 
programmed to deliver one of two fixed volumes at one of two corresponding fixed rates based 
on the amount of etoposide and fluid that is ordered (see the table, below).

< 130 mg 528 mL 40 mL 22 mL/hour
≥ 130 mg 1056 mL 40 mL 44 mL/hour
*DO NOT attempt to infuse the overfill
At the end of an infusion, some residual fluid is expected because overfill 
(excess fluid and drug) was added; however, nurses are asked to return to the 
Pharmacy for measurement any drug containers that appear to contain a 
greater amount of residual drug than expected.
Example at right:
The amount of fluid remaining in a bag after completing a 24-hour 
infusion (1056 mL delivered).

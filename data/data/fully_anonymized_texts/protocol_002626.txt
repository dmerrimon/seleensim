Trial Design  
This clinical trial titled “ Can Oral Caffeine Decrease Postoperative Opi[INVESTIGATOR_406004]? A Randomized Placebo- Controlled Trial” was 
registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, Protocol ID STUDY00000775, ClinicalTrials.gov ID [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  The full 
trial protocol can be accessed at https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this prospective, randomized, placebo -controlled, and double -blinded clinical trial.   
Participants 
All eligible adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients undergoing posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_406005] 2019 -December 2023 were approached, with an enrollment goal of 68 
total subjects.  Due to the extended time involved, the study was concluded with 51 completed subjects. 
Inclusion criteria were patients aged 12 through 17 years of age who presented for surgical treatment of AIS with either of the two treating surgeons.  Additional inclusion criteria were the ability to swall ow 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] (blinded clinical trial using a blank pi[INVESTIGATOR_67904]), English as the primary language, mental capacity 
sufficient to understand the purpose of the clinical trial, surgery performed via a posterior approach, 
patient assent and at least of one of their biological parents or guardian(s) consenting for the patient to participate  Exclusion criteria was a history of obesity (defined by a BMI at or above the 95th percentile), weight below 40 kg, any spi[INVESTIGATOR_406006], revision spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477], anterior or combined 
approach, admission to PI[INVESTIGATOR_6890] (Pediatric Intensive Care Unit), postoperative oxycodone use, specific 
medication allergies (ibuprofen, caffeine, codeine, and/or diazepam), history of renal disease, history of a coagulation disorder, histo ry of cardiac dysrhythmia or open heart surgery, history of chronic pain 
syndrome or Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, current use of oral central nervous system stimulant 
(e.g. methylphenidate), age greater than 18 years, children or parents unable to consent, individuals 
with cognitive delays, pregnant females, and prisoners. Caffeine is reported to be toxic when consumed in high doses when combined with other oral stimulants
1  Therefore, it was decided to exclude patients 
previously prescribed psychostimulants.  The clinical trial was discussed, and informed consent 
obtained, during the preoperative visit.     
Interventions  
The interventional drug (caffeine) used in this clinical trial was prescribed as approved by [CONTACT_406022] (Food and Drug Administration) for the treatment of postoperative pain in children. We 
extensively reviewed research focused on safe caffeine consumption in pediatrics and followed 
published guidelines in the administration of caffeine as an adjuvant to standard oral pain medications after surgery.  This literature review showed that caffeine being administered at the current doses in 
this clinical trial would not be harmful to children or adolescents. Data has been collected in children 
and adolescents using dose –response and placebo -controlled research methods regarding caffeine use. 
Outcomes, such as cardiovascular function, mood, and cogniti ve performance, have all been measured 
at caffeine doses ranging from 50 to 300 mg 
2-4. High caffeine intakes, defined as >5 mg/kg of body 
weight per day, correlated with risk of anxiety and withdrawal symptoms. Lower doses did not demonstrate these effects and had positive results with improved cognitive function, antidepressant action, an d sports performance 
5-7.  The goal caffeine consumption for children and adolescents should 
be less than 2.5 mg/kg of body weight per day 8.   
The hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406007] (IDS) pharmacy provided either a treatment dose or placebo 
dose of caffeine to be given to the patient and was also in charge of randomization for the study.  The experimental group received a 100 mg dose of caffeine (1/2 of a 200mg tablet) twice daily. The control 
group received a placebo dose that was compounded to look identical to the caffeine (capsule), also taken twice daily.  Both the active and placebo doses were given at the time of transition off the p atient -
controlled analgesia ( PCA) at 0900 on POD 1.   
Randomization  
The clinical trial subjects, clinician, and researcher were all blinded to the group assignments.  IDS 
pharmacy utilized an internet randomization generator to create the code. The code used numbers 1 -4 
to create groups, and odd numbers were assigned to the experimental/caffeine group. Subjects were randomized the day prior to dosing.  If a subject was  randomized but did not become a study participant 
(i.e. did not receive a dose of medication), IDS pharmacy did not reuse the randomization code; the next 
line on the randomization table was utilized.  The doses were concealed in teal, opaque capsules.  Empty 
capsules were used for placebo doses.  Capsules were sent to the inpatient floor in [ADDRESS_511936] postoperative spi[INVESTIGATOR_406008]'s initiation became the control pain pathway for the clinical trial with the addition of the placebo versus active 
caffeine dosages.  To reduce bias, the Anesthesia Pain Service standardized their intra- operative and 
post -operative analgesia.  During surgery, intrathecal (IT) preservative -free morphine was given after 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_138262].  After surgery, a PCA was then utilized until post -operative day (POD) 1.  The medication 
in the PCA was standardized to hydromorphone on demand only.  An oral dose of gabapentin was used pre-operatively and was continued three times daily until POD 3.  In the recovery room, a clonidine 
patch was placed and continued until discharge.    Intravenous (IV) ketorolac and acetaminophen 
scheduled was used until transition off the PCA on POD 1.  Patients were routinely transitioned off the 
PCA to oral pain medications the morning of POD 1 (defined as 0900 -2359).  IDS caffeine dosed at 100 
mg twice daily (at 0900 and 1700) was ordered and provided as either a treatment or placebo dose 
based on their randomization. The drug was cut to fit into empty capsules in a dark color to mask the contents by [CONTACT_406023].  The placebo capsules were e mpty.  
Post -operative oral transition medications were also standardized (Table 1). The POD 1 transition opi[INVESTIGATOR_406009]/acetaminophen offered at 2 dose ranges (lower and higher).  The lower dose was 0.15mg/kg (rounded down) to the nearest pi[INVESTIGATOR_406010] (5mg o r max of 7.5mg) given for moderate pain (VAS 
score of 0 -5). A higher dose measured at 0.2mg/kg (rounded down) to the nearest pi[INVESTIGATOR_406010] (7.5mg or 
max of 10mg) for severe pain was ordered for severe pain (VAS score of 6 -10).   
Data Collection  
Data from the EMR (electronic medical record) consisted of patient demographic variables as well as surgical variables (duration of operative time, estimate of intraoperative blood loss, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_406011]).  The primary outcome variable was postope rative oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], with secondary 
outcomes including postoperative pain scores, number of requests for diazepam, average heart rate, 
average systolic blood pressure, and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (LOS).  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_406012] (MME).  To control variability of MME, based on 
patient weight, a point system was derived and was measured daily until discharge. The lower dose of 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_406013], and the higher dose was counted as two points. Total MME/kg/day was also calculated and recorded daily.  Patients were on sche duled ibuprofen (~10mg/kg) from transition 
off PCA until discharge.  All patients had diazepam (equal to or less than 0.05mg/kg) ordered as needed for muscle spasms.  Standardization of post -operative analgesia also included oral gabapentin (5mg/kg) 
TID co ntinued through POD 3.  An outline of the anesthesia pain standardization pathway and 
postoperative pain medication pathway for this clinical trial are detailed in Table 1.  Pain scores were 
obtained per nursing standard using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) .  The primary outcomes were the 
number of demands (total points) for oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_406014]/kg/day.     
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Early study evaluation revealed multiple study participants being disqualified related to the research 
team missing details on inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Subsequently, a member of the research team was assigned solely to review each patient candidate’s chart to ensure study compatibility before  being 
approached for the study.  Clinician error in following the research protocol was also noted, therefore the caffeine study participant label was added to the operating room (OR) time out, and an email w as 
sent to OR scheduling, anesthesia staff, and inpatient floor charge nurses within [ADDRESS_511937] -surgical patients of the 2 senior surgeons that were managed from February 2018 -
January 2019 was conducted.   Similar inclusion/exclusion criteria recorded daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_406015] w as analyzed.  This data determined a sample 
size of 34 in each group, yielding 80% power to detect a difference in group means of 3.  This assumed a 
common standard deviation of 4.[ADDRESS_511938] with a significance level of 0.05.  

Because of the protracted study time and change in pain management practice to the benefit of the 
patients, we concluded this clinical trial at 51 patients (CONSORT Flow Diagram).      
 A biostatistician performed statistical analysis on this trial. Descriptive statistics were generated, 
including 95% confidence intervals (CI).   The caffeine/experimental and control groups were compared 
using independent samples t -tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s Exact tests for categorical 
variables.  Statistical analyses were performed using SAS v 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) with a 
significance level set at 0.05.  
Results 
There were 24 patients in the caffeine group (mean 14.3+/ -1.5 years, 91.7% female) and 27 in the 
control group (mean 14.8+/ - 1.4 years, 88.9% female).  Patient demographic variables are shown in 
Table 2.   There were no differences in patient demographic v ariables between groups.  The mean 
number of levels fused were similar between groups ( caffeine : 9.9 vs 10.5; P=0.28) with comparable 
operative times ( caffeine: 231 minutes vs 246 minutes; P=0.25). The total cohort had an average 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148801] 2.5 days.  There were no documented complications, adverse events, or adverse drug 
reactions related to caffeine usage in this study.  Only one patient developed a complication following surgery, a superficial wound dehiscence that was successfully treated without s urgical intervention. 
There were no unplanned reoperations in either study group.   
 
Comparison of Primary Outcome Measures  
The mean length of stay was comparable between study groups with 50% (N=12) of caffeine patients 
and 55.6% (N=15) being discharged home on postoperative day (POD) 2 (Table 3).  Mean daily VAS pain 
scores were statistically similar between study groups as well as the mean daily VAS score with slightly lower pain scores in the caffeine cohort.

MME) had lower usage in the caffeine cohort for POD1 but there were no significant differences 
between study groups (caffeine 18.6 vs control 21.6, P = 0.19).  After standardizing opi[INVESTIGATOR_406016] (MME/kg), there was decreased mean oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_406017]1 (caffeine 0.35 vs control 0.40, P = 0.19) and mean daily total oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_406018] (caffeine 0.32 vs control 0.37, P = 0.1), but these differences were not statistically significant (Figure 
1).  The mean total oral MME/kg for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208141] 0.83 for the caffeine group and 0.92 in the 
control group, P =0.40.  Utilizing the Mann -Whitney test, median oral MME/kg for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_208141] 
0.74 in the caffeine group and 0.90 in the control group (difference 0.16).  In assessing the mean total oral MME usage of the hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], the caffeine cohort had 5 MME less total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] 
(caffeine 45.0 vs control 50.6, P = 0.38, Table 3).

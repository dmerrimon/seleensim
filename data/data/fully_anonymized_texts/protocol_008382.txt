Summary/Purpose/Rationale 
Regional anesthesia procedures represent a common modality for postoperative analgesia after 
total hip arthroplasty surgeries (THA). The standard practice at our institution for many years has 
been the Lumbar Plexus block (LPB), which anesthetizes the L1-L5 lumbar nerve roots1. While 
the LPB offers analgesia from the associated sensory block, it also blocks motor fibers, leading 
to lower extremity weakness that could potentially delay the patient’s ability to participate in 
early physical therapy and may thereby [CONTACT_186371]. In the past several years, newer regional 
anesthesia block approaches have been described and investigated in an attempt to provide 
patients with postoperative analgesia while avoiding associated muscle weakness, facilitating 
earlier physical therapy participation and discharge. One such nerve block is the peri-capsular 
nerve group (PENG) block, which anesthetizes the articular branches of the femoral, obturator, 
and accessory obturator nerves providing sensory innervation to the hip joint capsule without 
consistently causing lower extremity weakness2. While we continue to perform LPB for 
postoperative analgesia after THA at our institution, some institutions are utilizing the PENG 
block to provide postoperative analgesia and facilitate early mobilization. There are currently no 
prospective studies that directly compare the efficacy of LPB to PENG block for providing 
postoperative analgesia after THA. 
 
Objectives  
The purpose of this randomized, double blinded, prospective study is to compare the 
postoperative analgesia provided by [CONTACT_186372]. We hypothesize that the PENG block will provide 
equivalent analgesia to LPB after THA. The primary outcome will be a comparison of patient-
reported numeric rating scale (NRS) pain scores with movement at six hours following block 
placement. Equivalency will be defined as a difference of less than one point in either direction 
on the eleven-point NRS pain scale (0-10). Secondary outcomes will include NRS pain scores 
with movement at 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_220267] 24 hours, motor strength at six hours after block placement as assessed by [CONTACT_186373] a six-point scale (0-5)3, and distance walked at first postoperative physical therapy session.  
The [ADDRESS_220268] reports asleep 
Ver 11/17/[ADDRESS_220269] reports no movement, this score 
will be a missing data point and not a deviation. 
 
 
Methods/Measurements 
 
Design 
This will be a randomized, double blinded, equivalency trial that will take place after approval 
from our Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent will be obtained from all study 
participants prior to randomization. The trial will be registered on clinicaltrials.gov before any 
enrollment begins. 
 
Selection Criteria 
Inclusion: Adults between [ADDRESS_220270] consented to and lack any contraindications to either LPB or 
PENG block for postoperative analgesia will be recruited for participation in the study. 
 
Exclusion: Patients with any contraindications to regional anesthesia, such as history of allergy 
to amide local anesthetics, pre-existing coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia (less than 100,000 per 
microliter), refusal to either analgesic block, presence of a progressive lower extremity 
neurological deficit, localized or systemic infection, chronic use of high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] 
(defined at daily use greater than 60mg oxycodone equivalents), as well as those who are 
pregnant, will be excluded from participation. A diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s 
disease will also exclude potential study subjects.  Any patients who refuse enrollment or 
withdraw their consent will be excluded and any of their information already collected will be 
destroyed. 
 
Setting 
Patients between [ADDRESS_220271] protocol prior to their 
surgery date, at which time the study will be discussed with all eligible patients, and they will be 
offered the ability to enroll in the study. Written informed consent will either be obtained during 
this visit, or the patient will be allowed to take the consent form home with them to discuss with 
their family and consider participation, and written informed consent can be finalized on the day 
of surgery. 
 
 
Study Protocol 
 
Baseline data collection 
Ver 11/17/[ADDRESS_220272] and with movement on the eleven-point NRS pain scale (0-10, where [ADDRESS_220273] imaginable pain). Patient characteristics will be 
recorded, including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, surgeon, and operative side, as well as 
preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_104917]. Baseline motor function will be assessed by [CONTACT_186374]-point Medical Research Council 
(MRC) scale (0-5, where [ADDRESS_220274] resistance)3. 
 
Two phone numbers will be obtained from the patient, if the patient consents, for contact [CONTACT_186375]. Each patient will also be provided with a pain journal with which to document pain 
scores for any remaining time points after discharge, in case they are not available by [CONTACT_186376]. All patients will still be admitted at the six hour mark, for collection 
of the primary endpoint of NRS pain with movement, as well as motor strength at six hours after 
block placement. 
 
Randomization 
Prior to beginning any regional anesthesia procedures, each patient will be randomized to one of 
the aforementioned treatment arms consisting of LPB or PENG block by [CONTACT_186377]/or the attending anesthesiologist in charge of the patient’s care. Randomization will occur in 
blocks of sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. Patients will be blinded to their treatment 
arm assignment, as will all research personnel who collect outcome data. Patient blinding will 
occur through the use of a sham block procedure as detailed below. 
 
Interventions 
Once randomization occurs, standard American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) monitors and 
supplemental oxygen will be applied to the patient, and a timeout procedure will be conducted to 
verify all patient data and paperwork are correct. Unless the patient has a contraindication, each 
patient will also receive a weight-appropriate dose of acetaminophen and celecoxib, or 
meloxicam (if the patient has an allergy to sulfonamide medications or to celecoxib) at this time.  
 
All blocks will be performed by [CONTACT_186378], or by a regional anesthesia fellow directly supervised by 
a regional anesthesia specialized faculty anesthesiologist. Sedation for block placement will be 
administered using midazolam and fentanyl titrated to patient comfort, at the discretion of the 
attending anesthesiologist performing or supervising the regional anesthesia procedures. All 
subjects will start in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], and their relevant anatomy for PENG block will be 
imaged using an ultrasound as described previously2, after skin preparation with chlorhexidine 
solution. All subjects will then receive a skin wheal using 1mL of 1% lidocaine at the skin entry 
site for a typi[INVESTIGATOR_186359]. Those subjects assigned to the PENG treatment arm will 
subsequently receive a PENG block using 20mL of 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 1:400,000 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_186360] 5mL increments with negative aspi[INVESTIGATOR_186361]. All subjects will then be transitioned to lateral decubitus positioning with the surgical 
Ver 11/17/2023 
 pg. 4 side up (standard at our institution, as we use an isobaric spi[INVESTIGATOR_186362]). Using a skin marker, 
midline will be marked on their lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_186363], and a point two thirds 
the distance between midline and the posterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_186364]1. Following this, their lower back areas will be prepared with antiseptic solution and 
draped in sterile fashion. All subjects will then receive a skin wheal with 1cc of 1% lidocaine at 
the standard LPB block site just marked as described above. Those subjects assigned to the LPB 
treatment arm will subsequently receive a stimulation-based LPB dosed with 20cc of 0.2% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 1:400,[ADDRESS_220275] as a sham block for those enrolled in the PENG arm. 
 
All patients will then receive a spi[INVESTIGATOR_186365] 3.5mL of 0.5% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 10mcg fentanyl. Following placement of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_100122], the patients will be 
brought to the operating room and receive our standard intraoperative protocol of propofol 
infusion for sedation, along with dexamethasone 10mg IV, ondansetron 4mg IV, surgical 
antibiotic prophylaxis as appropriate, and IV tranexamic acid 1g at both capsule opening and 
capsule closure. Any patients whose spi[INVESTIGATOR_186366], as checked prior 
to initiation of propofol sedation and surgical skin preparation with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_186367], will be induced under general anesthesia using propofol with placement of a 
laryngeal mask airway or endotracheal tube at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist. 
 
Materials  
Ultrasound guidance for imaging the relevant anatomy for the PENG block will be obtained 
using curvilinear probe and a sterile probe cover. An insulated, stimulating block needle be used 
to perform the PENG blocks for subjects enrolled in the PENG treatment arm, as well as for the 
LPB for subjects enrolled in the LPB treatment arm. The entire lower back area will be prepped 
in sterile fashion prior to LPB and spi[INVESTIGATOR_186368]. All products and medications used are 
FDA approved for the abovementioned procedures. 
 
Measurements 
Following the completion of surgery, all subjects will be brought to the post-anesthesia care unit 
(PACU) for recovery, where they will recover until satisfactory resolution of spi[INVESTIGATOR_186369]. Subjects will then be transported to an 
inpatient room, where nurses will monitor their vital signs and pain scores regularly. Subjects 
will receive standard of care pain medications for postoperative pain management as indicated.  
Subjects will continue to receive scheduled acetaminophen 1000mg every six hours (or 15mg/kg 
if their weight is below 65kg), and the NSAID administered preoperatively (either celecoxib 
200mg twice daily or meloxicam 15mg once daily) barring any contraindication such as renal 
impairment or vascular disease.  Oxycodone every four hours may also be administered as 
needed with dose ranges determined by [CONTACT_186379], or another narcotic at equipotent dosages if 
they have a contraindication to oxycodone.  Alternatively, they may receive combination 
products such as Percocet (oxycodone/acetaminophen) or Vicodin/Norco 
(hydrocodone/acetaminophen) instead, with the acetaminophen dosage adjusted accordingly.  All

(EMR) as per our standard protocol. Research personnel will measure patient-reported NRS pain 
scores at rest and with movement for each time by [CONTACT_186380], either face to face, or by 
[CONTACT_186381]’s room or phone numbers. This will include the primary outcome of patient-
rated pain with movement of the surgical extremity on the NRS pain scale at six hours after 
block placement (roughly correlating to two hours after arrival to their room) as well as 
secondary outcomes that include but are not limited to pain at rest and with movement at 12, 18, 
and [ADDRESS_220277] deviation 
of 2.0. Using these values, and setting the significance level to 0.05 with a power of 80%, we 
calculated the minimum required sample size to be n=69 in the LPB group and n=69 in the 
PENG group to conclude equivalence of movement pain at six hours between the two groups. 
Power was calculated using the R package ‘TOSTER’5. We intend to recruit n=[ADDRESS_220278] of LPB versus PENG groups will be performed using two one-sided 
t-tests. We will also calculate a point and confidence interval estimate of the difference between 
LPB and PENG groups. Secondary outcomes will also be compared using t-tests and confidence 
intervals.  
 
Missing Data Points 
If we find that study participants are missing substantial parts of their sequence of longitudinal 
measurements (6, 12, 18, and 24 hours), we will employ a mixed effects modeling framework 
that allows us to use all available data to test hypotheses about differences between PENG and 
Ver 11/17/2023 
 pg. 6 LRB at each time point. Models will be implemented using the ‘lme4’ package6 in R statistical 
software7.  
 
 
Human Subjects Protection 
 
Subject Recruitment Methods  
Potential candidates for the study will be identified based on the posting for the surgical 
procedure of elective primary anterior approach total hip arthroplasty. Patients will be 
approached during their preoperative assessment clinic visit for eligibility and told about the 
study in detail, including any known or possible risks, benefits, and alternatives. They will be 
advised there will be no financial incentive to participate   Potential subjects will also be 
recruited over the phone if they are not scheduled for a preoperative evaluation by [CONTACT_77147].  
They will be identified by [CONTACT_186382].  Upon phone discussion they demonstrate 
interest a copy of the IRB approved informed consent form will be mailed to them to allow for 
adequate review of the study prior to the morning of surgery.  . Written informed consent will be 
obtained and scanned into the EMR during that visit, if they consent, or on the day of surgery, if 
they need more time to deliberate on enrolling. Ample opportunity to ask questions will be given 
both during this preoperative visit and on day of surgery. All patients meeting the 
aforementioned eligibility criteria, regardless of gender, age, race, and ASA physical status, will 
be offered to participate.  
 
Informed Consent  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject who agrees to enroll, scanned, and 
uploaded into the patient’s EMR for permanent storage. Each patient will have the opportunity at 
any time to decline enrollment, withdraw informed consent, and have their data removed from 
the dataset and destroyed at any point in time. 
 
Confidentiality and Privacy 
Confidentiality will be protected by [CONTACT_186383], minimizing the collection of any information that could directly identify 
subjects. Each patient will be assigned a unique study identifier that will appear on the data 
collection form, and any protected health information that may directly identify the patient 
corresponding to the unique study identifier will be kept secure with access limited to designated 
study personnel. Following collection of all data, subject identifying information will be 
destroyed at the earliest opportunity, consistent with data validation and study design, producing 
an anonymous data set for analysis. All patient information collected will be kept confidential 
during recruitment as well as the remainder of the study. All identifying protected health 
information will be de-identified in the electronic database during data collection, which will be 
encrypted and secured in the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist private servers and only 
accessible by [CONTACT_1192]-factor authenticated, password-protected computers. Only selected research 
personnel will have access to the dataset. No reference to any individual participant will appear 
in reports, presentations, or publications that may arise from the study. 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring 
Ver 11/17/[ADDRESS_220279] will report to the principal investigators about any 
protocol violations, unanticipated problems with the protocol, or adverse events, which will 
promptly be reported to the IRB and corresponding government agency, if appropriate.

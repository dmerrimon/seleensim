TITLE: An observer-blinded randomized study of propofol infusion vs bolus 
dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation for pediatric magnetic resonance imaging 
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR:  [INVESTIGATOR_97332] P. Taylor, MD, MPH 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 
This study is designed to compare the efficacy of low-dose dexmedetomidine and propofol with 
a continuous2infusion of propofol for outpatient magnetic resonance imaging scans performed 
on children ages [ADDRESS_482553]-procedural behavioral and sleep 
disturbances will be collected. 
HYPOTHESIS / SPECIFIC AIMS 
We hypothesize that low-dose dexmedetomidine and propofol in combination provide 
satisfactory conditions for diagnostic MRI imaging with reduced time to arousal and readiness 
for discharge when compared to continuous infusion of propofol. 
BACKGROUND, SIGNIFICANCE, AND RATIONALE 
Magnetic resonance imaging is utilized with increasing frequency in the diagnosis and 
management of pediatric disease. Unlike other imaging techniques, these studies require a 
significant amount of time for completion, ranging from thirty minutes to several hours. Most 
young children are incapable of remaining immobile for the duration of the scan and require 
sedation and/or anesthesia for a successful study. A number of sedation models have been 
described in the literature and are reviewed here. The use of barbiturates, chloral hydrate, 
propofol, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], opi[INVESTIGATOR_385731]. 
In December 2016, the FDA announced new warnings regarding the use of general anesthetics 
and sedation drugs in young children. ( https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/
ucm532356.htm)  which include all of the drugs listed with the exception of dexmedetomidine. 
Published studies in pregnant animals and young animals have shown the use of general 
anesthetic and sedation drugs for more than [ADDRESS_482554] these changes result in long- term effects on the animals’ 
behavior or learning (see Data Summary). 1-[ADDRESS_482555] also been conducted in children, 21-43 some 
of which support findings from previous animal studies, particularly after repeated or prolonged 
exposure to these drugs early in life. All the studies in children had limitations, and it is unclear 
whether any negative effects seen in children’s learning or behavior were due to the drugs or to 
other factors, such as the underlying medical condition that led to the need for the surgery or 
procedure.  
In response, Dean Andropoulos observed that “There are no alternatives to these general 
anesthetic drugs for children younger than 3 years of age. . . . The only other drugs in clinical 
use for sedation and anesthesia that do not cause neurodegeneration in animal models are 
dexmedetomidine and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], but these agents are not sufficient for general anesthesia and do 
not represent a feasible option by [CONTACT_1029].” [ADDRESS_482556] supervised nurses, necessitating general anesthesia to complete 
the studies at a later date. Prolonged sedation and behavioral issues following the scan maybe 
problematic.  
The safety of propofol administered by [CONTACT_385764]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385732]-standing imaging centers. 2,3 Total propofol doses published in the literature range from 
approximately 7 mg/kg to 12 mg/kg. Mallory et al [ADDRESS_482557] complications was not significantly different. Increased sedation 
failure, unplanned admission, prolonged recovery and vomiting were more common among 
patients receiving pentobarbital. 
Kiera Mason et al5 demonstrated the safety of high dose dexmedetomidine administered by [CONTACT_105]-
anesthesiologists despi[INVESTIGATOR_385733], hypotension and bradycardia. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_385734] 2-3 m cg/kg load followed by 1-2 mcg/kg/hour maintenance. Siddappa et 
al6 found that despi[INVESTIGATOR_385735], recovery is prolonged, and additional 
medications, are required to maintain immobility in a significant number of patients.  A recent 
article by [CONTACT_385765]7 suggests that a combination of propofol and dexmedetomidine results in a 
reduced number of adverse events, particularly upper airway obstruction and oxygen 
desaturations when compared to propofol alone. All patients in this cited study received a single 
dose of oral midazolam 0.3-0.5 mg/kg prior to PIV placement. In the prop-dex combination 
group the mean dose of propofol administered was 9 mg/kg compared to 12 mg/kg for propofol 
alone. Furthermore, animal studies suggest that dexmedetomidine may actually have 
neuroprotective effects  by [CONTACT_385766]-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis. 8 
With concern for delayed awakening following diagnostic imaging 
procedures, we began to 
evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose polypharmacy to reduce recovery time and adverse 
behavioral changes. In a QI study conducted in 2014, we observed that for procedures lasting 
less than one hour, 1 mcg/kg/hr dexmedetomidine in combination with 1-2 mg/kg propofol at 
the onset of sedation is effective for successful diagnostic imaging.  In addition to the rapid 
arousal and discharge, the total drug requirement with this strategy is markedly less than that 
published in the literature for propofol alone.  
We aim to conduct a randomized, observer-blinded study to compare the low-dose sedation 
strategy now commonly used by [CONTACT_385767]’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385736]. Outcome measures in 
addition to the improved efficiency and time to discharge will include total drug dose 
administered, frequency of airway obstruction and oxygen desaturation, and hemodynamic 
changes associated with initiation and maintenance of sedation. Any additional medications 
required for completion of the study will be compared between the groups. 
DESIGN AND METHODS 
Forty  outpatients scheduled for elective MRI evaluation will be randomized to receive either 
propofol (Group Prop) as a continuous infusion or a low -dose propofol and dexmedetomidi ne 
combination (Group PropDex) to establish adequate sedation. All out -patients ages [ADDRESS_482558] 
utilizing Research Randomizer  an online computer -based random number generator. An 
investigator will be blinded to the drugs selected. He/She will observe the airway manipulations 
and obtain hemodynamic data during the f irst ten minutes of the procedure. The observer will be 
blinded to the drugs administered.  
ASA guidelines regarding procedural sedation will be followed. All patients will be screened for 
MRI safety, and a focused history and physical examination including  neurological, airway, head 
and neck, respi[INVESTIGATOR_385737].  
All patients will receive an intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer’s or a dextrose containing 
solution for replacement and maintena nce fluids as determined by [CONTACT_42778]. 
Patients will be anesthetized with sevoflurane and nitrous oxide if necessary for intravenous 
access at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Otherwise, j -tip lidocaine will be utilized to 
anesthetize the insertion site. Parental presence will be permitted during induction if judged to be 
in the best interest of the patient. Midazolam syrup 0.3 mg/kg may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating anesthesiologist. This is not a part of the study protocol.  
MONITORING  
Monitoring includes videocamera, direct visual observation, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, 
heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_385738] -tidal CO [ADDRESS_482559] will monitor the patient during the initiation of sedation. O nce a 
stable depth of moderate sedation (Ramsey 3) is established the sedation nurse will monitor and 
record HR, O2 sat, end tidal CO2. Initial blood pressure measurements will be obtained at time 
0, 2, 4, [ADDRESS_482560] of care at 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385739].

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Sample size was esti mated using previously reported discharge times following propofol 
sedation for MRI procedures and a thirty percent reduction in discharge times when low -dose 
dexmedetomidine and propofol are administered. Wu 9 reported a recovery time of 35.7  10.8 
follow ing propofol infusion at 200 µkg-1min -1, resulting in a standardized difference of 0.97. 
Sample size is calculated to be [ADDRESS_482561], and 
identity or log -link functions to satisfy normality criteria. Scheffe’s adjustment for multiple 
contrasts are applied to tests of differences between groups across epochs and within groups 
from baseline. Significance for all tests w ill be   p<0.05. Analysis will be  perform ed with Stata

DRUGS OR PROCEDURES  
 
Medications to be used in this study:  
 
1. Propofol is approved for use as an anesthetic agent in patients 2 months of age and older.  
2. Glycopyrrolate is recommended by [CONTACT_385769].  (Propofol package insert)  
3. Lidocaine is approved for use in children. The FDA recommends administration of 
lidocaine immediately prior to propofol injection to reduce the pain associated with 
injection of the drug.  (Propofol package insert)  
4. Sevoflurane is approved for use in all pediatric patients.  
5. Nitrous oxide is approved for use in all pediatric patients.  
6. Dexmedetomidine is not approved for use in children.  However, the drug is used 
routinely for sedation and as an adjunct to general anesthesia at CHW and other 
institutions caring for children. A detailed review of safety data and the justification for 
Off-Label and Investigational Use Of Marketed Drugs, Biologics, and Medical Devices is 
presented in Appendix A

RISKS AND THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH WILL BE TAKEN TO MINIMIZE RISK 
EXPOSURE  
 
All anesthetic procedures involve risk to the patient. The goal of anesthesia is to produce a 
loss of consciousness and awareness of sensation. Changes in breathing, even apnea, and 
alterations in hemodynamics are expected consequences of anesthesia. The drugs and 
procedures in this study are known to be associated with the following risks:

Patients in the propofol group will be receiving routine care and the risk level is minimal as the 
study will only involve data collection. Patients in the prop/dex group will have the additional 
risks of receiving dexmedetomidine and glycopyrrolate. These risks are listed above and include 
hyper - and hy potension, bradycardia and sedation. Glycopyrrolate will be given with 
dexmedetomidine to attenuate the degree of bradycardia known to occur. The FDA recommends 
administration of an anticholinergic agent with the administration of propofol when it is used 
with other agents that may cause bradycardia. Dry mouth is associated with administration of 
glycopyrrolate but at the dose administered the symptoms should be minimal.  
Anesthetic risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_385771]. This will include  
• Administration of anesthesia by [CONTACT_385772]  
• Appropriate monitoring including videocamera, direct visual observation, 
electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_385738]-tidal CO [ADDRESS_482566] CHW safety protocols regarding MRI, that include  
• scanning patients for ferromagnetic materials  prior to entering the scanner  
• utilization of MRI compatible equipment and monitors  
• Videocamera  for continuous observation of patient to readily recognize movement  
• Noise – earplugs and headphones  
• Patients at risk for renal disease will have appropriate laboratory studies performed prior 
to administration of g adolinium whose major route of excretion is renal .

CONFIDENTIALITY PROVISIONS  
 
All paper records are kept in locked cabinets in the anesthesiology  department, with restricted 
access. Only de -identified information is stored. Each subject will be assigned a study 
identification  number. The legend associating the study number with the patient medical record 
number will be stored securely by [CONTACT_385773]. Data analysis will be performed on 
a MCW secure server.  
 
ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTOCOL TO HUMAN 
RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS AND SOCIETY  
For patients randomized to the prop/dex group we anticipate that significantly reduced do ses of 
anesthetic agents will be administered for MRI studies in small children. These subjects  may 
benefit from a more rapid recovery from the procedure . Significantly reduced dosing of both 
propofol and dexmedetomidine may reduce the adverse events and side effects that may be seen 
when either drug is used alone. Because of poorly understood but ongoing concerns for the 
potential adverse outcome on behavior and learning in children exposed to anesthetic agents, 
both the subjects recruited and future patie nts will benefit from the results of this study.  
Subjects in the propofol group will be treated with a medication that routinely provides 
conditions satisfactory for successful MRI imaging necessary for the  diagnosis and treatment of 
their diseases.  Ther e may be no additional benefit to the patients assigned to this group .  
 
STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_385747]:  
• Sinus or junctional bradycardia below 30% of preoperative heart rate or requiring rescue 
medications or treatments  
• Any cardiac arrhythmia (with the exclusion of sinus tachycardia or sinus bradycardia that 
resolves without intervention) before the initiation of dexmedetomidine infusion  
•  Junctional rhythm sustained for g reater than 15 minutes, or requiring rescue medications 
or treatments, or associated with greater than 30% decrease in mean arterial pressure 
(MAP) from preoperative baseline value  
• Onset of second or third degree heart block, regardless of necessitating an intervention  
• Hypotension defined ad 30% decrease in MAP from preoperative baseline value  
• Cardiac arrest or any other life -threatening event  
Events that would serve as criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357683]:  
• A single adverse event requirin g unanticipated admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_385748]  
• Greater than 20% of subjects experiencing hypotension as defined by 30% decrease from 
baseline  
• Greater than 10% of subjects experiencing severe hypotension as defined by 50% 
decrease fro m baseline and that requires treatment beyond fluid replacement with IV 
isotonic solution  
• Greater than 20 % of subjects experience bradycardia as defined as heart rate below 30% 
of pre -study heart rate that requires rescue medications.  
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_385749].  
We anticipate that the study will be completed after the successful recruitment of [ADDRESS_482567] patient enrollment and until s tudy completion.  Any serious adverse event 
will be reported to the IRB as required. In addition, if preliminary review of the data suggests 
that differences in the primary outcomes are significant prior to enrolling 70 subjects, the study 
will be terminat ed at that time.

M 2. Causality Definitions  
 
Causality term  Assessment criteria  
Certain  • Event with plausible time relationship to drug intake  
• Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_19699]  
• Response to withdrawal plausible  
• Event definitive pharmacologically or phenomenologically (i.e. an 
objective and specific medic al disorder or a recognised 
pharmacological phenomenon)  
• Rechallenge satisfactory, if necessary  
Probable/Likely  • Event, with reasonable time relationship to drug intake  
• Unlikely to be attributed to disease or other drugs  
• Response to withdrawal clinically reasonable  
• Rechallenge not required  
Possible  • Event with reasonable tim e relationship to drug intake  
• Could also be explai ned by [CONTACT_19699]  
• Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear  
Unlikely  • Event with a time to drug intake that makes a relationship 
improbable (but not impossible)   
• Disease or other drugs provide plausible explanations  
Conditional/  
Unclassified  • Adverse reaction  
• More data for proper assessment needed, or  
•  Additional data unde r examination  
Unassessable/  
Unclassifiable  • Report suggesting an adverse reaction  
• Cannot be judged because information is insufficient or 
contradictory  
• Data cannot be supplemented or verified

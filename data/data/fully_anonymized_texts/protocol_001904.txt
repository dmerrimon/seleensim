17. Project Description (Abstract)
Patients and caregivers often st ruggle to adjust to life after they leave the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666322] a stroke. 
Poor transitions in stroke patie nts can result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666323], slow recovery, poor quality of 
life, dissatisfaction w ith care, and caregi ver stress. Social w orkers play a vital role in healthcare by 
[CONTACT_666347], providi ng counseling, and coordinating services. The Michigan Stroke 
Transitions Trial (MISTT) will im plement a Social Work Case Man agement (SWCM) program, which 
through a combination of home vi sits and follow-up phone calls,  will result in a personalized case 
management program designed to a ddress unmet needs, increase pa tient engagement, decrease 
stress and improve quality of lif e. Access to accurate medical information during the transition period 
is also critical to patients and caregivers. The ideal informat ion resource needs to be reliable, 
accessible, and responsive to the patient’s changing needs. The refore a second component to the 
MISTT study is the development of a study website that will ser ve as an information and support 
resource for patients and caregi vers. The MISTT study will test  the efficacy of these two 
complementary interventions in 4 80 acute stroke patients discha rged from 4 Michigan hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. 
Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 1) usual  care, 2) the SWCM p rogram, or 3) the 
SWCM program plus the MISTT Study  website. The intervention per iod will last 2  months and 
outcomes data (including qualit y of life) will be measured afte r 90-days. 
18. Procedures
Baseline Clinical Data: For all subjects enrolled in the MISTT study, clinical data will be abstracted 
from the medical charts by [CONTACT_666348] [INVESTIGATOR_307]. Specific data elements are listed 
in Appendix 2a (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666324] e data) and will include demogr aphic variables (age, race, sex, 
insurance status, pre-stroke residence), past medical history, comorbidities, pre-stroke function 
(mRS), and clinical stroke data (stroke type, stroke severity, tPA treatment, in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77085], 
discharge mRS). All of these va riables are collected as part of  usual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422].
Baseline Patient-Reported data : Additional background data will  be collected from all trial subjects at 
the first follow-up phone intervi ew conducted at 7 days followi ng discharge back to home. These 
variables include education leve l, marital status, family struc ture, in-home versus outside caregiver, 
patient function (dependence in a ctivities of daily living [ADL ] and instrumental activ ities of daily living 
[IADL]), CTM-15 (Care transition measures), Morisky scale (medication adherence), and technology 
related measures (Computer Self- efficacy, Attitudes to Technolo gy, and Technology Utilization). 
These data elements are listed in Appendix 2b (Baseline Patient -reported data).Page 6 of 1 7 MSU IRB - Application - Initia l
9/25/2015 http://[IP_ADDRESS]:591/ucrihs /ucrihs_main/FMP ro?-db=ucrihsmain %5fv2.fp5 &-format= r...
Intervention-related Process data : Data relevant to the SW case  management intervention will be 
collected by [CONTACT_666349] t he home visits and telephone follo w-up calls. These data include the 
patient’s bio-psycho-social asse ssment, details of the personal ized case management treatment 
plan, progress toward goals, an d details of any referrals made.  These data elements are listed in 
Appendix 2c (Intervention-related process data). For those subj ects who are given access to the 
MISTT Study website, data will be collected through Google Anal ytics concerni ng patient and 
caregiver use of the  website. Data will in clude how often users  log in, what pages they go to, how 
long they spend on those pages , the type of technology they use  including type of browser, operating 
system, and use of m obile technology. 
Outcome data: Outcomes data will be collected on all enrolled t rial subjects (patients and caregivers) 
by [CONTACT_666350] 7-days and 90-days after t he patient returns home. Patient 
related data elements are liste d in Appendix 2d (Patient Outcomes), caregiver specific outcomes are 
listed in Appendix 2e (Caregiver Outcomes). The final choice of  outcome measures  will be decided 
upon by [CONTACT_666351][INVESTIGATOR_666325]. The following 
list includes the universe of can didate measures we are conside ring:
1)END Ou tcomes (Collected at 90- days): NIH PROMIS quality of l ife instruments in cluding PROM IS
Global QOL (Q10), and PROMIS self -efficacy (socia l interaction,  medications, emotions and daily 
activities). NeuroQOL quality of life instruments including dep ression, anxiety, and satisfaction with 
social roles and activities, pat ient activation measure (PAM), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666326], 
stroke recurrenc e, and 90-day home time (number of days at home  during 90-day period). 
2)Mediating Outcomes (Collected  at 90-days): NI H PROMIS suppor t measures including
informational, instrumental, and  emotional support. Dyad relati onship scale, stroke knowledge test, 
stroke action test.
3) Effect modifier variables (c ollected at base line, 7-days and /or 90-days): Demographics, stroke
severity/stroke type, disability measures ( mRS, Barthel Index ( BI), ADL, IADL, cognitive function, 
social and living arrangements. C TM-15, technology use (Compute r Self-efficacy, Attitudes to 
Technology, and Technology Utiliz ation), medicati on adherence m easures (Morisky scale), 
NeuroQOL quality of life instruments including communication, p ositive affect and well-being, 
emotional and behavioral dyscontrol.
4)Caregiver Specific Outcomes (c ollected at 7days and 90-days) : Caregiver Strain index,
Preparedness for Caregiving, mood, stroke knowledge, satisfacti on, and function/d isability (ADLs and 
IADLs). For enrolled patient-caregiver dya ds we will also colle ct information from both parties on the 
Dyadic Relationship Scale, patie nt ADLs/IADLs, patient quality of life, patient depressive symptoms, 
and patien t s
ocial support. 
All baseline, process , and outcomes data w ill be entered into the Study’s REDCap database. The 
management and protection of RED Cap data is descr ibed in sections 22B and 22D.

20e. Provide the rationale for your sample size.
Sample size estimates were based on 2 outcome measures: Stroke- specific QOL (SS-QOL), and the 
Patient Activation Measure (PAM) . Anticipated differences in th e summary SS-QOL measure were 
obtained from a previous registry  study of the PI (Reeves) (Ref : Gargano et al, 2007) which found 
significant differences of 0.[ADDRESS_899818] devia tion of 13 (Ref: Hibbard et al, 
2005), and that increases of 4.6  are clinically meaningful (Ref : Fowles et al, 2009). In all simulations, 
power was set to 80% with alpha= 0.05. All estimates were gener ated in SAS using the overall F test 
for a one-way ANOVA model based on the [ADDRESS_899819] size (through changes in detectable difference or the stan dard deviation) we 
obtained estimates between [ADDRESS_899820] clinica lly meaningful differences in these two outcomes.

(1). How will the subjects be identified, recruited and enrolled? In clude who will make initial 
contact [CONTACT_109116], who wi ll recruit the subjects, and who will enroll the subjects.
Potential study subjects are patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666328] t he 4 participating 
institutions. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11530] (clinical stroke nurses or site coordinators) who are employed by [CONTACT_666353][INVESTIGATOR_307] s tay and will be responsible for 
contact[CONTACT_30697], consenting and enrolling all eligible patients. Pro cedures for approaching and consenting 
stroke subjects into clinical studies are well established at t he participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], having been 
built on the experience of prior clinical research studies incl uding the MASCOTS stroke registry that 
was conducted by [CONTACT_976] ( Reeves). In brief, st udy personnel will in troduce the study to t he patient, assess 
the patient’s eligibility (including AMTS sc reening for cogniti ve function), seek their consent, and ask 
them to identify the primary car egiver who will also be invited  to participate. Str oke patients will be 
identified by [CONTACT_666354][INVESTIGATOR_307]’s daily cen sus logs. At a suitable time during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], 
preferably when family members are present, the study coordinat or will approach t he patient to 
introduce the study. If the pati ent and family express interest  and eligibility is confirmed, the 
coordinator will comple te the consent proces s. When the patient agrees to p articipate, he/she will 
read and sign the written consent and HIPPA approval forms. The  informed consent process will 
explain the potential risks and include appropriate HIPAA langu age that will not pr ohibit data from 
being shared with the research  team. A copy of the informed con sent instrument and HIPPA form will 
be provided to each participant. Study personnel will query the  patient for the name [CONTACT_666373] t o pr
ovide the major ity of care for them when they return home (i.e ., the primary 
caregiver). Study personnel will  then approach this identified caregiver to assess  eligibility, attempt 
recruitment, and obtain informed  consent from the caregiver. If  the primary caregiver declines to 
participate in the s tudy, this will not affect the inclusion of the patient. If a patient is unable to give 
consent because they fail the AM TS screening then a proxy respo ndent will be sought (e.g., see 
section 24B1 for further details). We believe that the use of p roxy respondents is critically important 
for stroke studies to avoid stud y bias from exclusion of the mo st severely affected patients. 
Enrollment of caregiver s will most likely oc cur in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339347] (when they vi sit the patient) but 
may occur by [CONTACT_648] (if study per sonnel are unable to meet with them in person).

risks.
This RCT study is designed to a meliorate stress and burden asso ciated with the tran sition back to the 
home that occurs under curren t usual care environments. The two  interventions used in this study 
include: 1) home based case management services provided by [CONTACT_47197] (SW), and 2) 
training and use of the MISTT st udy website (a purpose-built, patient-centered, online information and 
support resource). Both interventions have limited risk for par ticipants. The most substantial of these 
is loss of confidentiality. There is also a  possibility that id entifying and addressing unmet needs with 
the social worker may raise diff icult and emotional issues for both the patient and the caregiver that 
would have otherwise gone unaddre ssed. It is also possible that  medical emergencies or other 
adverse situations might arise when study personnel are interac ting with the subjects. Social workers 
are trained to identify such problems and provide crisis interv ention; the social work ers will be able to 
refer patients for additional s ervices if nee ded. They will have regular meetings with and receive 
ongoing supervision from Co-Investigator [CONTACT_455872] to address potential problems and a protocol 
will be in place for em ergencies (see  section 21B fo r further d etails).
21b. Describe procedures for protecting against or minimizing p otential risks and provide an 
assessment of their likely effectiveness.
There are two study related pote ntial risks to participants in this study: 1) loss of confidentiality, and 
2)increased stress as a result o f the social work intervention  addressing unmet needs and other bio-
psycho-social stressors. It is a lso possible that a medical eme rgency or other adver se situation might 
arise when study personnel are i nteracting with the subjects. S ection 22A and 22D provide a 
description of the extensive protections put in place to mitiga te the risk of loss of confidentiality. Here 
we address the protections put in place to protect subjects aga inst increased str ess or unexpected 
medical emergencies: 
If, during the trial, a serious non-medical situation arises th at suggests the patient is in crisis, the SW 
will refer the patient t o local crisis suppo rt services and ens ure that the pati ent is
 connected to the 
appropriate services. In thes e situations the  SW will contact C o-Investigator [CONTACT_455872] to develop 
an emergency care and f ollow-up plan to ens ure patient safety. [CONTACT_455872] has considerable prior 
experience in practical community-based social work including home visits. The SW  will also inform 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666329]. The SW s will have bi-week ly meetings with 
[CONTACT_455872] where  they will discuss stra tegies to manage high-ne eds cases. Also, thes e situations will 
be discussed at the bi-weekly research team meetings (including  the PI, Project Manager, Co-I 
Hughes and other team members) w here strategies can be discussed and refined to ensure that 
patients receive nec essary services. 
It is also possible that medical emergencies or a dverse conditi ons may be identified by [CONTACT_666355] 
(during their home visits or th e follow-up calls) or by [CONTACT_666356]- up data collection calls. All personnel will b e instructed on the appropriate use of 
9-1-1 services should any situation arise that could represent a medical emergency (examples could 
include recurrence of stroke symp toms, a serious fall, acute co gnitive change). If other serious but Page 10 of 1 7 MSU IRB - Application - Initia l
9/25/2015 http://[IP_ADDRESS]:591/ucrihs /ucrihs_main/FMP ro?-db=ucrihsmain %5fv2.fp5 &-format= r...
non-emergent medical problems ar ise (for example, ran out of me dications, symptom s suggestive of 
a new medical problem or condition ) the SW or research assistan ts will contact [CONTACT_102]’s primary 
care provider to set  up an appointment and will follow-up to in sure that treatment is received. 
21c. Assess the potential benefits (if any) to be gained by [CONTACT_375644], as well as 
benefits which may accrue to society in general as a result of the planned work.
Patients enrolled in the two int ervention groups  (the SW case management program, or the SW case 
management program plus access to  the study website) may direct ly benefit from the case 
management services delivered by [CONTACT_666357], and/or may benefit fr om the information and support 
services provided by [CONTACT_666358]. The risks associated wi th this study are reasonable 
considering that the study interv entions may improve the transi tion experience (by [CONTACT_666359]/anxiety and improving o verall quality of life). Other be nefits include the fact that the knowledge 
gained from this study may benefit future stroke patients and c aregivers. All stud y subjects will be 
given access to the study websi te after completing their final 90-day telephone interview.
22a. How will the subject's privac y be protected? Include a description of who will be interacting 
with the subjects or accessing a nd abstracting data from the su bject's records (academic, 
medical, etc.) and where the st udy will take place. For example , will individuals not associated 
with the research study be present during the consent process a nd the conduct of the study? 
All interviewers and  study staff will follow study specific pro cedures for maintaining respondent 
confidentiality. All of our stu dy staff will rece ive training i n the proper method of  conducting interviews 
that contain personal information, including mandatory HIPAA tr aining. Consent pr ocesses will occur 
within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_139265] s etting and will be  conducted by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_666330]. In the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885], study related bedside interactions and conver sation with patient s will be conducted 
by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_666331]. 
Procedures for approaching and consenting stroke subjects into clinical studies are  well established 
at the participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], having been built on the experience of prior clinical research studies. 
Study identification numbers, rat her than written names or othe r personal identifyi ng information, will 
be used to identify and track hard copy data forms containing p atient information. The Social Work 
Case Management interv ention will occur in t he privacy of the p atient’s home, and so threats to 
patient privacy are minimal. The MISTT w eb site will be structu red to require strong passwords for all 
subjects, and no identifiable data will be retain ed on the site .
22b. Where will the data b e stored and for how long?
All electronic data collected in REDCAP will  be stored o n th e secure BRIC server (hosted at the 
MSU-Health Information Technolog y computer data center). All ha rd copy files that pertain to patient 
or caregiver data (e.g., signed consent forms, patient contact [CONTACT_3031]) will be kep t in lockable file 
drawers within secure offices lo cated in either the Department of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_666332]. Study forms maintained by [CONTACT_666360][INVESTIGATOR_666333]. 
All study related data will be maintained fo r at least [ADDRESS_899821] access t o the research data?
Only members of the r esearch team will have access to the data.  No identifiable data will be shared 
outside the research team. 
22d. How will you ensure the confidentiality and/or anonymity of  the research data? Include a 
description of the procedures and safeguards you will use, including if identifyi ng information 
will be stored with the data.
Patient specific clinical data w ill be entered remotely by [CONTACT_666361] a REDCap 
database using secure web-based data entry screens. Similarly, remote data entry in REDCap will 
also be used by [CONTACT_666362] (SW) to recor d data collecte d during home visits and telephone 
follow-up calls. Contact [CONTACT_666363]’s home be stored on secure password 
protected study laptop computers  and cell phones – no hard copy  forms that contain patient 
information will be maintain by [CONTACT_666357]. The outcomes data for this trial will be collected by [CONTACT_666364] 11 of 1 7 MSU IRB - Application - Initia l

trained research assistants wo rking under the supervision of the PI (Reeves) and Project Manager 
(Fritz). Data will be c ollected at two time  points: [ADDRESS_899822] Manager, social workers, and 
research assistants conducting th e telephone follow-up calls wi ll all use secure (pa ssword protected) 
study-specific laptop and desktop computers.  Laptop computer ba gs will be locked during transport 
and will be stored in locked offices . Desktop machines will be kept in a locked designated interview 
room in the Department of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_666334]. 
During this rese arch project, MSU-BRIC personnel will have no c ontact with human subjects and will 
play no role in the collection of patient data. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_666335] (both located at MSU) 
will have global privileges that p ermit viewing an d editing of the total databa se. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_666336]. Study field personnel  (i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666337]) will be allowed to view 
only the patient data from their study site. Audit logs, create d automatically within REDCap, will 
capture the complete user histor y of database activity. REDCap variables designated as ‘personally 
identifying’ will be excluded from export by [CONTACT_57971] g REDCap user- defined permissions. In addition, 
BRIC tracks the certification of  IRB training for all REDCap us ers and will susp end access to 
REDCap in the unlikely event that  current IRB training certific ation lapses for any of the study 
personnel. 
Study data will be stored and managed usin g the REDCap applicat ion hosted on se rvers at the MSU-
Health Information Technology c omputer data center in a HIPPA-c lass compliant server room with 
climate-control and swipe-card entry. Daily and monthly backups  of the database will be made and 
retained on the s erver and backups will be moved to a  separate site on a monthly basis. 
All subjects using the MISTT study website will be required to use strong passwords, and no 
identifiable data will be retained  on the site. MI STT website u tilization data collected through Google 
Analytics (e.g., how often users  log in, what pages they go to,  how long they spend on those pages) 
will be stored on  Google servers. Google will not hav e access t o any data that identifies an individual 
user (such as name, E mail or address). The utilization data wil l be linked to the project-specific 
subject ID numbers and not s ubject n
ames or other identifiers. The key to link the utilization data to a 
specific individual will be stor ed in a Dru pal database  on secu re MSU servers, and are not publicly 
available We believe that the combination of high level training of all s tudy personnel with respect to 
confidentiality and data security , in combination with state-of -the art security features implemented by 
[CONTACT_94081]-BRIC on its REDCAP databased minimize any risk of a breach in subject confidentiality. 
22e. Is it appropriate for your r esearch to have a monitoring plan to periodically 
assess the data to ensure the saf ety of subjects or to ensure n egative 
outcomes do not occur (e.g., ongoing study of domestic abuse, c linical 
trial, full board projects)?
Describe the steps that you wi ll be taking to assure that 
subjects are protected. If appropriate, attach a copy of the 
plan.
The safety of the subjects par ticipating in this study is of 
paramount concern to the invest igators. The PI (Reeves) is 
ultimately responsible for the o verall safety mon itoring of the  study. 
Because there is no drug or inve stigational device being tested  in 
this trial, participation has no m ore than minimal risk to the 
subjects. Commensurate with the very low risk associated with 
study participation and the lack  of any tangible Adverse Events  to 
monitor, the study team (PI, Co-I’ s, Project Manager, SWs) plan s 
to directly oversee all safety monitoring. Thus no formal data 
safety monitoring board is plan ned. All patient safety concerns  
identified by [CONTACT_666365] s will be discussed at t heir weekly meeting s, 
and at the bi-weekly r esearch team meetings . Summaries of these  
issues and the approaches used by [CONTACT_666366] a Patient-Profess ional Advisory Panel 
who will meet eve ry 6 months during Yea rs 2 and 3 to provide 
oversight on the trial’s imple mentation. These data will also b e YESPage 1 2of 17 MSU IRB - Application - Initia l

shared with the funding agency (PCORI) as part of the regular 
biannual reports submitted to them.
With respect to monitoring the in tegrity of the REDCap database , 
[CONTACT_666376] will wo rk closely with the BRIC Unit Informati on 
Systems Manager to oversee and ensure implementation and 
monitoring of the data management plan. She will ensure that th e 
informatics configuration, test ing, and production processes ar e 
conducted appropriately to ensur e security and confidentiality of 
data in the Study’s REDCap database.
Is there a data safet y monitoring committee or data safety 
monitoring board?NO
23. Does this project involve pr otected health information as de fined by
[CONTACT_2373]?YES
24. (a) Select appropriate consent option. Approval of a 
consent form and 
process
(b) Consent Procedures:
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11530] (clinical stroke nurses or study site coordi nators) who are 
employed by [CONTACT_666367]. Procedures for approac hing and consenting stroke subj ects into clinical 
studies are well established at t he participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]; al l study personnel 
have experience in enrolling patients into clinical research st udies. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666338]’s  eligibility and  will screen each 
patient using the Abbreviated Me ntal Test Score (AMTS) to deter mine if a proxy 
consent is required (see below for further details). If a patie nt is deemed 
potentially eligible at a suitable time stu dy personnel will approach the patient to 
introduce the study (preferably when other family members are p resent). If the 
patient and family exp ress interest and eligibility is confirme d, the coordinator 
will provide further details of the study. This discussion will follow the information 
on the consent form including a d escription of the study’s purp ose, the use of 
randomization, the study procedures involved (including the use  of home visits), 
the expectations of participating subjects with respect to providing information 
via follow-up telephone calls. Ri sks and potential benefits as well as 
compensation will also be discus sed. If the patient agrees to p articipate, he/she 
will read and sign the written c onsent and HIPPA forms. A copy of these forms 
will be provided to  each participant.
Study personnel will query enrolled patients for the name [CONTACT_666374] o f care for them when they retur n home (i.e., the 
primary caregiver). Study personnel will th en approach this ide ntified caregiver 
to assess eligibility, attempt recruitment, and obtain informed  conse
nt from the 
caregiver. Enrollment of caregivers will most often occur eithe r in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_111483] (if they visit the patie nt) or may occur  by [CONTACT_648] (if s tudy personnel are 
unable to meet with them in person). Whether the caregiver choo ses to 
participate in the s tudy or not, will not a ffect the inclusion of the patient.
We will seek to enroll any patient who fa ils the Abbreviated Me ntal Test Score 
(AMTS) screening – a 10-item scr eening tool that identified sub jects with 
confusion or disorientation. If a  patient scores &#8804;[ADDRESS_899823] th en a proxy respondent will be s ought. We will 
follow the rules as outlined in  the MSU HRPP manual (Section 6- 8-D) for 
determining the most appropriate person to act as a surrogate d ecision maker.

2. Briefly describe the proposed revision(s) and rationale:
We request the following revisions:
1) OTHER - Add Dr.  as study personnel. 
 is the study Investigator at
Sparrow and  is a social worker who will be providing our Stroke Case Management intervention.
 The following approved personnel only need to be listed as "additional personnel" and not identified as "investigators
and key personnel"
2) CONSENT - Approval for a waiver of documentation to obtain Caregiver Consent verbally over the phone. This will
occur if the Caregiver is unavailable at the time of patient consent. A script is included in the supporting documentation.
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_666340], Social Work Stroke Case Managers (SWSCMs), and student research assistants will all be
trained to conduct informed consent for both in-person and over-the-phone processes. 
3) INSTRUMENTS - The finalized Patient and Caregiver [ADDRESS_899830] been submitted for
approval. The Caregiver Instrument contains two scales that were not previously approved: the Oberst Caregiving
Burden Scale and the Bakas Caregiving Outcomes Scale.
4) OTHER - Approval for University of Michigan as a study site. The U-M IRB approval letter has been included with our
supporting documentation which includes the executed Data Use Agreement (DUA) and their approved consent forms.
5) OTHER - The ClinicalTrials.gov ID is: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]
6) OTHER - We have included letters and educational materials for the first and second mailings. For the first mailing,
enrolled patients will receive a letter and, depending on their randomized group assignment, two National Stroke
Association (NSA) brochures and an interview response option sheet (attached). The second mailing is sent only to the
usual care group and includes two American Stroke Association (ASA) brochures (previously approved). The second
letter has been attached. The "Mailing Supply List" document summarizes the timeline and specifics for each mailing.
3. Does the proposed revision(s) add or increase the level of risk for subjects (including any additional
adverse effects)?NO
4. Does the proposed revision(s) require changes in the consent process and/or forms (e.g., parental
permission, child assent, diminished cognitive capacity)?

Title  An Observational Study to Characterize Patient Global 
Impression Question s for Activity-induced Symptoms in 
Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 
Study Phase 2 
Indication Pro Re Nata (PRN) “as needed” prevention and/or 
treatment of epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]/activity-induced symptoms in patients 
with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  
Primary Objective  To characterize the psychometric properties and 
performance of Patient Global Impression of Severity 
(PGI- S) questions, designed to measure severity, 
character, and duration of patients’ self -reported 
symptoms of PAH following effort.  
Secondary Objectives  To characterize the relationship of PGI-S questions 
with: 
o Borg dyspnea score 
o Oxygen saturation 
o Heart rate (HR) 
o HR recovery at 1 minute after the ISWT 
 To characterize the recovery profile for activity-induced 
symptoms 
Safety Objectives  To evaluate safety based on: 
o Adverse events (AEs) 
o Vital sign measurements 
Study Design This is an observational, multicenter, single-day, Phase 2 
study.  This study will include a 14-day Screening Period 
and Study Day 1 clinic visit.  Subjects will be required to 
perform an activity to induce symptoms of PAH, and 
subjects’  severity of self-reported symptoms of PAH will be 
measured from pre-activity, immediately after the activity, 
and through the 30-minute recovery.  Subjects will be asked 
about their PAH symptoms using [ADDRESS_1155079] (ISWT). 
 
The total number of shuttles completed by a subject during 
the Screening ISWT will be the maximum targeted for that 
subject during the remaining ISWTs in the study.     
 
United Therapeutics Corp. RIN-PRN-201 Original Protocol 
Lung Biotechnology PBC Treprostinil for PRN Inhalation Spray 
Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 5  After Screening, subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts 
based on PAH medications as prescribed by [CONTACT_9682] : 
Cohort A will include subjects who are currently prescribed 
and using inhaled treprostinil for the treatment of PAH and 
Cohort B will include subjects who are taking other PAH 
medications (instead of inhaled treprostinil).  
Subjects in Cohort A will be assigned to 1 of 2 sequences: 
Sequence 1: 
 Period 1: The ISWT will be initiated [ADDRESS_1155080]’s previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (expected 
trough level).  Activity will be timed to allow all 
procedures, including recovery, to be completed prior to 
Period 2. 
 Period 2: The ISWT will be initiated within 
approximately 30 minutes of the previous inhaled 
treprostinil dose (expected peak level).  Following 
recovery and the Investigator’s confirmation of return to 
baseline status, the subjects will be discharged from the 
study.  
Sequence 2: 
 Period 1: The ISWT will be initiated within 
approximately 30 minutes of the previous inhaled 
treprostinil dose (expected peak level).  Activity will be 
timed to allow all procedures, including recovery, to be 
completed prior to Period 2.  
 Period 2 : The ISWT will be initiated [ADDRESS_1155081]’s previous dose of inhaled treprostinil (expected 
trough leve l). Following recovery and Investigator’s 
confirmation of return to baseline status, the subjects 
will be discharged from the study. 
 
Subjects in Cohort B will also undergo 2 activity periods: 
 Period 1: The ISWT will be initiated approximately 
4 hours after the morning dose of PAH medication.  
 Period 2: The ISWT will be initiated at least 1 hour 
following completion of the previous ISWT.  Following 
recovery and the Investigator’s confirmation of return to 
United Therapeutics Corp. RIN-PRN-201 Original Protocol 
Lung Biotechnology PBC Treprostinil for PRN Inhalation Spray 
Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 6  baseline status, the subjects will be discharged from the 
study. 
 
The baseline PGI-S and Borg dyspnea score assessment s 
will be conducted prior to (-15 and 0 minutes; pre-ISWT) 
activity that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_832092].  The subject will initiate activity (ISWT), and these 
same assessments will be performed immediately at the end 
of the ISWT (within 1 minute of completing the activity).  
The PGI-S assessments will also be performed throughout 
recovery following completion of the ISWT.  Continuous 
pulse oximetry will be performed at each clinic visit 
starting at each pre-ISWT and through recovery.  Vital sign 
assessments will be performed at the beginning and at the 
end of each clinic visit. 
 
On Day 1, subjects will be provided rest between the 
2 ISWTs (at least 1 hour).  
 
The total study duration for a subject, including the 
Screening Period, will be up to [ADDRESS_1155082]

Route of  
Administration Not applicable. 
Procedures The procedures are as follows: 
 PGI-S question assessments performed at each clinic 
visit at Pre-ISWT (-15 and at 0 minutes prior to 
inducement of symptoms), at the end of the ISWTs 
(within 1 minute of completing the activity), every 
minute for the first 5 minutes of recovery followed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_135] 5 minutes for the remainder of the 30-minute 
recovery. 
 Pulse oximetry to be performed continuously.  Pulse 
oximetry will include the collection of SpO 2 and HR.  
Pulse oximetry will start at the beginning of pre ISWT 
(15 minutes prior to the ISWT) and will be continuous 
through the end of recovery of each individual period.  
The SpO 2 and HR measures obtained at -15 and at 
0 minutes (prior to activity), every minute during the 
ISWT, every minute for the first [ADDRESS_1155086]’s source documents and eCRF.      
 Borg dyspnea score performed at each clinic visit at 
pre-ISWT (-15 and at 0 minutes prior to inducement of 
symptoms) and immediately at the end of the ISWTs 
(within 1 minute of completing the activity). 
 Vital signs (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood 
pressure) will be assessed at Screening (prior to any 
activity and after recovery) and on Day 1 (prior to 
initiating Period 1 assessments and prior to discharge). 
 Following completion of all study procedures, and the 
Investigator deems that the subject has returned to 
baseline status, per pulse oximetry readings, the subject 
will be discontinued from the clinic. 
Statistical Considerations Sample size:  Approximately [ADDRESS_1155087] 36 evaluable 
subjects complete the study.

Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 14  1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 DEFINITION OF CLINICAL PROBLEM 
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), defined as an elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure 
and pulmonary vascular resistance, is a severe hemodynamic abnormality common to a 
variety of diseases and syndromes.  Elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure causes an 
increase in right ventricular afterload, impairing right ventricular function and ultimately 
leading to heart failure and death (McLaughlin 2009, Rubin 1997).  PAH can present with 
shortness of breath, chest tightness, exercise intolerance, dizziness, syncope, elevated 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_69908]/or heart rate, decreased appetite, fatigue, chest and abdominal pain, lower 
extremity edema, and cyanosis. 
In a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-supported forum of PAH patients (summarized in 
The Voice of the Patient-PAH meeting summary report, December 2014) participants 
reported that despi[INVESTIGATOR_832094], therapi[INVESTIGATOR_832095].  Patients reported shortness of breath and fatigue, 
followed by [CONTACT_832109], as having the greatest adverse 
impact on their daily life.  Due to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_832096], 
patients avoid physical activities that trigger these symptoms, such as household chores, 
playing with children, or simply walking around.  Therefore, a therapeutic option that 
provides patients with greater control over treatme nt of their disease symptoms on an “as 
needed” ba sis would be beneficial. 
Pro Re Nata (PRN) use of pharmacological agents has a long history in the treatment of 
various conditions.  Examples where PRN treatment options have empowered patients to 
proactively effect a positive change in their medical condition and daily activity include 
symptomatic treatment of several pulmonary diseases, eg, asthma (Ventolin® HFA [albuterol 
sulfate; GlaxoSmithKline], Proventil® HFA [albuterol sulfate; [COMPANY_006] & Co. Inc.]) and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (Proair® HFA [albuterol sulfate; Teva Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], LLC]), as 
well as nonpulmonary diseases, such as patient-controlled pain management (Actiq® [fentanyl 
citrate; Cephalon, Inc. ). 
United Therapeutics Corp. RIN-PRN-201 Original Protocol 
Lung Biotechnology PBC Treprostinil for PRN Inhalation Spray 
Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 15  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_832097] (PGI) 
questions.  A published review of US package inserts for drug approvals occurring between 
2006 to 2010 identified 20 approvals based on symptom-related primary endpoints 
(Gnanasakthy 2012).  Specifically, the drugs Savella® (approved 2009 [milnacipran HCl; 
Allergan Pharmaceuticals International Limited) and Simponi® (approved 2009 [golimumab; 
Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies]) were approved based on PGI measures.  Measurement 
of symptoms associated with PAH (eg shortness of breath and fatigue) should be shown as 
feasible. 
1.2 CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS 
PGI questions can be used as endpoints in clinical studies to evaluate epi[INVESTIGATOR_832098].  Subjects will be asked about their PAH symptoms using 3 Patient Global Impression of 
Severity (PGI-S) questions that address their overall PAH symptoms, shortness of breath, and 
physical fatigue (Appendix 15.1).  The hypothesis is that the PGI-S questions will be sensitive 
to detect changes in activity-induced symptoms of PAH.  The Incremental Shuttle Walk Test 
(ISWT; Singh 1992) will be the activity used to induce symptoms in patients.  This ISWT 
requires the subject to walk back and forth on a 10-meter course (Appendix 15.2).  The speed 
at which the subject walks is dictated by [CONTACT_832110]. 
2 OBJECTIVES 
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVES 
The primary objective of this study is to characterize the psychometric properties and 
performance of PGI- S questions, designed to measure the severity, character, and duration of 
patients’ self -reported symptoms of PAH following effort. 
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 
The secondary objectives of this study are the following:  
 To characterize the relationship of PGI-S questions with: 
 Borg dyspnea score 
 Oxygen saturation  
 Heart rate (HR) 
 HR recovery at 1 minute after the ISWT 
United Therapeutics Corp. RIN-PRN-201 Original Protocol 
Lung Biotechnology PBC Treprostinil for PRN Inhalation Spray 
Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 16   To characterize the recovery profile for activity-induced symptoms. 
2.3 SAFETY OBJECTIVES 
Safety will be evaluated based on: 
1. Adverse events (AEs) 
2. Vital sign measurements 
3 EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 
3.1 STUDY DESIGN 
This is an observational, multicenter, single-day, Phase 2 study.  This study will include a 
14-day Screening Period and a Study Day 1 clinic visit.  The ISWT (Appendix 15.2) will be 
conducted to induce PAH symptoms and to measure PGI-S (Appendi x 15.1).  Subjects will be 
asked about their PAH symptoms using [ADDRESS_1155096] during the remaining ISWTs in the study. 
After Screening, subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts based on PAH medications as 
prescribed by [CONTACT_9682] ; Cohort A will include subjects who are currently prescribed and 
using inhaled treprostinil for the treatment of PAH and Cohort B will include subjects who are 
taking other PAH medication s (instead of inhaled treprostinil).  
Subjects in Cohort A will be assigned to 1 of 2 sequences: 
Sequence 1: 
 Period 1: The ISWT will be initiated [ADDRESS_1155097]’s previous dose of 
inhaled treprostinil (expected trough level).  Activity will be timed to allow all 
procedures, including recovery, to be completed prior to Period 2. 
 Period 2: The ISWT will be initiated within approximately 30 minutes of the previous 
inhaled treprostinil dose (expected peak level).  Following recovery and the 
Investigator’s confirmation of return to baseline status, the subjects will be discharged 
from the study.  
United Therapeutics Corp. RIN-PRN-201 Original Protocol 
Lung Biotechnology PBC Treprostinil for PRN Inhalation Spray 
Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 17  Sequence 2: 
 Period 1: The ISWT will be initiated within approximately 30 minutes of the previous 
inhaled treprostinil dose (expected peak level).  Activity will be timed to allow all 
procedures, including recovery, to be completed prior to Period 2.  
 Period 2 : The ISWT will be initiated [ADDRESS_1155098]’s previous dose of 
inhaled treprostinil (expected trough level).  Following recovery and the Investigator’s 
confirmation of return to baseline status, the subjects will be discharged from the 
study. 
Subjects in Cohort B will also undergo 2 activity periods: 
 Period 1: The ISWT will be initiated approximately [ADDRESS_1155099] ’s 
morning dose of PAH medication. 
 Period 2: The ISWT will be initiated at least 1 hour following the completion of the 
previous ISWT.  Following recovery and the Investigator’s confirmation of return to 
baseline status, the subjects will be discharged from the study. 
The baseline PGI-S and Borg dyspnea score assessments will be conducted prior to (-15 and 
0 minutes; pre-ISWT ) an activity that is typi[INVESTIGATOR_832099].  The 
subject will initiate activity (ISWT; Appendix 15.2), and these same assessments will be 
performed immediately at the end of the ISWT (within 1 minute of completing the activity).  
The PGI-S assessments will also be performed throughout recovery following completion of 
the ISWT.  Continuous pulse oximetry will be performed at each clinic visit starting at each 
Baseline and through recovery.  
Vital sign assessments will be performed at the beginning and at the end of each clinic visit.  
On Day 1, subjects will be provided rest (at least 1 hour) between the [ADDRESS_1155100] of the following periods: 
Screening:  During the Screening Period, subjects who sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF) 
will first undergo all Screening assessments to evaluate eligibility as listed in the

Rescreening will be allowed with the S ponsor’s Medical Monitor approval. 
During Screening, the ISWT will be performed to determine eligibility and the ability to 
induce symptoms.  Completion of a minimum of 3 shuttles (30 meters) of the test will be 
required for study eligibility.  Pre-ISWT, ISWT conduct, and ISWT recovery will be 
performed and specific assessments will be conducted as outlined below.  
Pre-ISWT: Baseline PGI-S (Appendix 15.1) and Borg dyspnea score (Appendix 15.3) 
assessments completed at -15 and 0 minutes prior to activity inducement of PAH symptoms 
will be performed.  Continuous pulse oximetry, for the assessment of oxygen saturation and 
HR, will be initiated at the beginning of pre-ISWT and performed until the end of recovery 
from the ISWT.  Vital signs (systolic blood pressure [SBP], diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) 
will be assessed at the beginning of pre-ISWT.  
ISWT: PGI-S and Borg dyspnea scores will be assessed immediately upon completion of the 
ISWT.  Continuous pulse oximetry, for the assessment of oxygen saturation and HR, will be 
assessed continuously during the activ ity. 
ISWT Recovery: After completion of the ISWT, PGI- S assessments will be performed every 
minute during the first 5 minutes followed by [INVESTIGATOR_135] 5 minutes for the remainder of the 
30-minute recovery.  Continuous pulse oximetry, for the assessment of oxygen saturation and 
HR, will be assessed during recovery. 
Vital sign assessments will be performed at the end of this clinic visit. 
Day 1 : The same assessments mentioned above will be performed during [ADDRESS_1155102] of the 2 ISWTs will be required.

may also include worsening of pre-existing symptoms or conditions that occur as a result of 
protocol-mandated procedures. 
9.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death 
 A life-threatening AE 
 Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
In addition, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they jeopardize the subject and require medical/surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above.   
Life-threatening means that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred.  It does not mean that the event, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have 
caused death.

Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 42  percentages for categorical variables.  Confidence intervals may be included for informal 
purposes.  
Medical history and prior/concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health 
Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODrug), and AEs will be coded using the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA).  Coding dictionary versions will be specified in 
the SAP. 
All statistical analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_941] S ponsor’s biostatistics department personnel 
(or appropriate designees) using SAS®, Version 9.3 or higher, or other validated software. 
10.3.1  Efficacy Endpoint(s) 
There are no efficacy measures since this is an observational study. 
10.3.2  PGI- S Questions Assessment  
The primary objective is to characterize the psychometric properties and performance of 
3 PGI- S question s (Appendix 15.1) in PAH subjects during pre-ISWT, at the end of activity, 
and through recovery.  
The focus of the analyses will be to describe PGI-S measurement sensitivity of the subjects’  
self-reported symptoms of PAH at the end of the activity and during recovery from activity.  
The Sponsor will tabulate symptom scores and compute changes from baseline (pre-activity) 
scores for each question.  Data may be displayed graphically and will be summarized overall 
and by [CONTACT_832113]/period (as appropriate). 
Additionally, for Cohort A, the sensitivity to a known inhaled treprostinil drug effect will be 
assessed tabulating, across time, the PGI-S measurements with inhaled treprostinil to PGI- S 
measurements without inhaled treprostinil.  Test-retest assessments for PGI-S measurements 
will be conducted for Cohort B.  
Correlations between the 3 PGI- S questions and with Borg dyspnea scores, oxygen saturation, 
and HR will be assessed.   Data for HR recovery at 1 minute after the ISWT will be examined 
in an exploratory fashion overall and as related to PGI-S measurement s.  
United Therapeutics Corp. RIN-PRN-201 Original Protocol 
Lung Biotechnology PBC Treprostinil for PRN Inhalation Spray 
Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 43  The onset and recovery profile for activity-induced symptoms will also be characterized. 
10.3.3  Safety Analyses 
Safety will be evaluated on AEs, vital signs, and oxygenation.  All AEs as recorded by [CONTACT_832114] a MedDRA Preferred Term and System Organ Class by [CONTACT_832115].  The summary of AEs will include the number and percentage 
of subjects, as well as the number of events reported for each Preferred Term.  No inferential 
analyses are planned for the AEs. 
Data collected at pre-ISWT will serve as baseline values for the evaluation of data collected 
during ISWT and recovery.  Summary statistics will be calculated for measured values and 
changes from baseline values.  No inferential analyses are planned on these safety endpoints. 
10.4 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
There is no planned interim analysis for the study.  However, given the open-label nature of 
the study, results may be tabulated by [CONTACT_422219].  
10.5 OTHER ANALYSES 
Other analyses may be conducted based on available study data.  Details for any other 
planned statistical analyses will be specified in the SAP.

Standardization 
Standardization of the ISWT is very important for obtaining meaningful outcomes.  It is 
advisable to time the performance as an additional measure, to confirm manual recording of 
the number of shuttles completed. 
Please note that: 
 If a repeat test is performed on the same day, at least a 1-hour rest should be allowed 
between tests. 
 Only standardized instructions from the provided media should be used. 
 No encouragement should be given throughout the ISWT.   
 A comfortable ambient temperature and humidity should be maintained for all tests. 
 The walking track must be the same for all tests for a patient: 
 Cones are placed 9 met ers apart. 
 The distance walked around the cones is [ADDRESS_1155162] during the remaining ISWTs in the study. 
Before the ISWT  
 Instruct the patient to dress comfortably and to wear appropriate footwear. 
During the ISWT  
Follow the instructions: 
The objective of the ISWT is to walk as long as possible, there and back, along the 10-met er 
course (identified for the patient by 2 cones with an insert of 0.5 meters from either end), 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_832104].  
Instructions for the subject: You will hear these beeps at regular intervals.  You should walk 
at a steady pace, aiming to turn around the cone at [ADDRESS_1155163], your walking speed will be very 
slow, but you will need to speed up at the end of each minute.  Your aim should be to follow

Version Date – [ADDRESS_1155164] 20 seconds to complete 
each 10-met er shuttle, so don’t go too fast.   The test will start in 15 seconds, so get ready at 
the start now.  Level 1 starts with a triple beep after the 4-second countdown. 
Ending the ISWT  
The ISWT ends if any 1 of the following occur: 
 The patient is more than  0.[ADDRESS_1155165] from the cone when the beep sounds (allow 
1 lap to catch up to the pace of the audio recording ). 
 The patient reports that they are too breathless to continue. 
At the End of the ISWT  
 Seat the patient or, if the patient prefers, allow the patient to stand. 
 Record [ADDRESS_1155166] (the patient can be asked, 
“What do you think stopped you from keepi[INVESTIGATOR_832105]?” ): 
 Shortness of breath 
 Physical fatigue 
 Chest pain

Version Date – 31 January 2019 Confidential Page 53  15.4 GUIDELINES AND DEFINITIONS FOR RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Investigator or a designated member of his/her staff will probe each subject for any AEs 
that may have occurred.  The Investigator should always ask the same question when 
conducting the verbal probe in order to ensure uniformity between subjects.  The Investigator 
should ask: 
 “How are you doing (feeling)?”  
Based on the subject’s response to this question, t he Investigator should ask additional 
questions relevant to the specific complaint such as: 
 “How severe is/was the symptom?”  
 “How often did the symptom occur?”  
 “How long did the symptom last?”  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to review t he results of all diagnostic and laboratory tests 
as they become available and ascertain if there is a clinically significant change from baseline.  
If the results are determined to be a clinically significant change from baseline, this should be 
reported as an AE.  The Investigator may repeat the diagnostic procedure or laboratory test or 
request additional tests to verify the results of the original tests.  When possible, a diagnosis 
associated with the abnormality should be used as the reported AE. 
Using provided definitions, the Investigator will then: 
(1) rate the intensity and seriousness of the AE and (2) note actions taken to counteract the 
AE. 
Definitions of Intensity, Seriousness, and Outcome 
INTENSITY 
An assessment of the relative intensity (severity) of an AE is based on the Investigator’s 
clinical judgment.  The maximum intensity encountered during the evaluation period should 
be checked.  The assessment of intensity should be independent of the assessment of the 
seriousness of the AE.

not limited to, an event that is fatal, life-threatening, permanently or severely disabling, 
requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_832106], is a congenital abnormality (offspring of 
subject) or is medically significant (important medical events that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition). 
a Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3768]: 
 Routine treatment or monitoring of the study indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition (eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a routine right heart catheterization ). 
 Treatment which was elective or pre-planned, for a pre-existing condition not 
associated with any deterioration in condition (eg, pre-planned operation which does 
not lead to further complications etc). 
 Treatment of an emergency, in an outpatient setting for an event not fulfilling any of 
the definitions of serious as given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. 
OUTCOME 
 Fatal – The study subject died. 
 Not Recovered/Not Resolved – The AE was ongoing at the time of death or at the time 
the subject was lost to follow up. 
 Recovered/Resolved – The AE resolved. 
 Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae – The AE is considered resolved; however, there 
is residual sequelae.  Some events do not return to baseline, such as metastasis or 
progression of disease; however, once these events are determined by [CONTACT_832116], the Investigator may consider the event to be resolved or 
resolved with sequelae. 
 Recovering/Resolving – The AE is improving but is not yet completely 
recovered/resolved. 
 Unknown – The outcome of the AE cannot be determined.

 Title: Does a soft drink mixture improve tolerance of activated charcoal in an adult without affecting efficacy: A randomized controlled crossover study  Clinical Trials Number: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  Document Date: 11/28/[ADDRESS_246782] methods vary by [CONTACT_4657], the basic production process involves pyrolysis of organic material followed by [CONTACT_206904].2 This results in a compound with a very large surface area – 800-1200 m2/g.[ADDRESS_246783]-ingestion, but not 4 hours.6 A study by [CONTACT_206905].7 They found that charcoal those that received charcoal were less likely to experience a prolonged QT on EKG. Finally, a study by [CONTACT_206906]: gastric lavage, activated charcoal, ipecacuanha, or no decontamination. They found that activated charcoal was the most eLective decontamination method.[ADDRESS_246784] looked at diLerent mixtures to try to improve the taste/appearance of the charcoal.12-[ADDRESS_246785] the eLicacy of the charcoal, allowing us to continue on to the randomized controlled trial.

Protocol:   Recruitment: [ADDRESS_246786] of mouth.   Inclusion: Healthy non-pregnant adults ages 18-40  Exclusion: • Self-reported history of any hepatic, gastrointestinal, or renal disease. 
• Self-reported history of alcohol or drug abuse (deﬁned as any use of illicit drugs, alcohol use greater than the CDC standard recommended amount of 2 drinks per day in men). • Any current daily prescription medication use • Any allergy to Tylenol • Pregnant women • Age <18 or >40 • Any gluten allergy or intolerance  • Weight <60 kg or >93 kg • Prisoners • Adults unable to consent  Participants will be provided the inclusion and exclusion criteria when they contact [CONTACT_206908].  Inclusion/exclusion criteria are conﬁrmed and documented at each protocol visit. We will use a screening questionnaire to access potential subjects based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria  Settings The Clinical Research Unit in the Institute for Human Performance will be used to conduct the study. For screening, discussion of private information will be performed over the phone from a private office in the Poison Control Center.   Study Day Method/Procedure:  Visit 1  a. This will be done over the phone from a private office in the Poison Control Center b. Will review inclusion/exclusion criteria to look at eligibility c. If done in person, will obtain signed consent   The following will be collected at the start of visit [ADDRESS_246787] and 200 mL of water h. A peripheral IV will be placed in the antecubital fossa for blood draws i. Area will be cleaned with an alcohol wipe ii. Tourniquet will be placed on the arm proximal to planned IV insertion site iii. IV tubing will be prepped with a saline flush iv. Vein will be accessed with an angiocath IV catheter (needle size determined by [CONTACT_46566]) v. Prepped IV tubing will be connected to the catheter and the line will be secured to the skin with a tegaderm.  i. Acetaminophen ingestion will occur [ADDRESS_246788] i. 45 mg/kg acetaminophen will be administered with [ADDRESS_246789] experimental day. 
i. For the control day, 50 g activated charcoal will be administered by [CONTACT_5071]. Actidose-aqua, a pre-mixed charcoal-water slurry, will be used ii. For the study day, 50 g activated charcoal (Actidose-aqua) will be administered as a mixture with 240 cc soft drink (1:1 charcoal to soft drink). Actidose-aqua will be used  k. Subjects will rate the appearance, smell, flavor, texture, and overall appeal of the charcoal mixture on a 1-[ADDRESS_246790]. l. Blood for acetaminophen assay will be drawn in a Gold or Mint tube (approximately 5 mL per tube) at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 180, 240, minutes i. Samples will be taken to the lab for processing ii. Samples will be run using Abbott’s Acetaminophen L3K assays (enzymatic colometric assay) m. Subjects will receive a light snack of crackers and water no sooner than 3 hours after the charcoal is consumed (4 hours after acetaminophen was ingested).  n. Participants will be reminded to refrain from using acetaminophen for [ADDRESS_246791] with 95% conﬁdence intervals.    To analyze diLerences in the pharmacokinetics between the study arms, the area under the curve, time of maximum concentration, and maximum concentration will be obtained. Area under the curve is used as a marker of drug absorption and will be calculated utilizing the trapezoidal rule. A paired t-test will be performed for comparison with 95% conﬁdence intervals.    To compare the mg/kg dosing of acetaminophen for each arm of the study, a paired sample t-test will be performed.  All analysis will be conducted using  IBM SPSS Version 26. The level of signiﬁcance was set at a p-value <0.05.

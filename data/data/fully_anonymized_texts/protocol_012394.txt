(PACU) when neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) have been used in the operating room.  
The only method of reliably detecting residual neuromuscular blockade is through the use of quantitative neuromuscular monitors.   Unfortunately, several barriers exist that have prevented the widespread application  of these devices.  For instance, there is a paucity of quantitative 
neuromuscular monitors commercially available.  Also, two modalities of quantitative monitoring, kinemyography and acceleromyography, rely on movement of the muscles of interest, a characteristic frequently compromised during patient positioning for surgical procedures or in uncooperative awake patients in the PACU.  Additionally, many clinicians are unfamiliar with these quantitative monitors, and incorporating them into their practice ca n 
represent an undesirable educational burden.  The aim of this investigation is to compare the performance of two quantitative monitors utilized on post- anesthesia recovering patients.  The 
ToFscan (Draeger Medical Inc., Telford, PA) represents one of the few standalone acceleromyography (AMG) -based quantitative monitors available for routine clinical use in the 
[LOCATION_002].  The TetraGraph (Senzime AB, Uppsala, Sweden) is a standalone electromyography (EMG) -based quantitative monitor that recently received Conformité 
Européene (CE) approval.  While both of these quantitative monitors can be utilized to guide intraoperative NMBA re-dosing and confirm recovery, they provide their objective data via drastically different techniques.  AMG, based on Newton’s Second law which describes force being proportional to acceleration, measures acceleration of the thumb and requires its unobstructed movement.  As such, performing AMG in awake, uncooperative patients can yield inaccurate results because of unwanted patient movement.  Alternatively, EMG measures electrical activity within the muscle following peripheral nerve stimulation, and is unaffected by [CONTACT_370243].  We plan to compare measurements with these two devices throughout various stages of neuromuscular recovery in the PACU end compare the usefulness of these devices in this vulnerable patient population.

significant number of patients  continue to  arrive  in the PACU with  objective evidence of residual  
neuromuscular blockade (Naguib, Kopman, and Ensor 2007; Cammu  et al. 2006).  While  not 
every  patient  with  residual  weakness  develops a postoperative complication,  many  can develop

J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  avoidable critical respi[INVESTIGATOR_50127]  (Murphy  et al. 2008; Berg  et al. 1997).  Furthermore,  special  
populations such  as the elderly,  are at particular  risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_370230]  (Murphy  et al. 2015).  The  use of quantitative  monitoring has  
been  demonstrated  to reliably  reduce the incidence  of postoperative residual  weakness  and the 
ensuing complicatio ns (Todd, Hindman, and  King  2014; Todd and  Hindman 2015; Murphy et  al. 
2011).  With  an abundance of literature  supporting the use of objective neuromuscular monitors, 
a panel  of experts  recently  recommended  the universal adoption of such  devices  whenever  
NMBA  are utilized  (Naguib et  al. 2018).   
Quantitative neuromuscular monitoring devices objectively measure residual weakness and 
display the results numerically.  This is  traditionally accomplished by [CONTACT_746] a train -of-four 
(TOF) stimulation at the ulnar nerve and measuring the response of the adductor pollicis muscle.  The degree of muscle weakness is determined by [CONTACT_370244], which consists of the ratio of the fourth muscle contraction to the first.  Adequate recovery that excludes clinically 
significant weakness from neuromuscular blockade is defined as a TOF ratio ≥ 0.9, a measurement that can be determined reliably only with a quantitative monitor (Sundman et al. 2000; Eriksson et al. 1997).  Although evidence strongly suggests objective monitors should be used perioperatively whenever NM BAs are administered, these devices can be expensive and 
require additional training.  Many clinicians default to the antiquated practice of utilizing qualitative (subjective) neuromuscular stimulating units such as a peripheral nerve stimulator (PNS) (Grayling and Sweeney 2007; Naguib et al. 2010). 
There are several  types  of quantitative  neuromuscular monitors.  These devices  can be 
incorporated into  the anesthesia workstation, allowing  data to  be seamles sly integrated  into the 
electronic medical  record.   Unfortunately, this  setup  can preclude using these monitors in  the 
PACU as  portability  is sacrificed.   In contrast,  other monitors exist  as standalone, portable (hand-
held) units.   
Aside  from  portability , objective  monitors can  further  be categorized  based  on the modality  
utilized  to measure responses.  Mechanomyography  (MMG)  measures  the force of contraction of 
the adductor pollicis  (thumb) muscle  following ulnar nerve stimulation  and has served  as the 
traditional “ gold-standard ”.  Mechanom
 yographic responses are  precise and reproducible, 
however the setup  is cumbersome and  the lack  of commercially  available devices  has relegated  
MMG  to strictly  research  purposes. Acceleromyography  (AMG) measures  accelerat ion of a 
muscle  group (typi[INVESTIGATOR_370231]) in  response to  stimulation  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_370232]).  This  
technique is  similar  to MMG,  but instead  of measuring  the force  of muscle  contraction, an  
accelerometer  fixed  to the thumb measures  the acceleration  of the thumb in  response to  ulnar 
nerve stimulation.   Based  on Newton’s  Second  law that states  force  is proportional to  
acceleration,  the measured  acceleration  is correlated  with  the force  of contraction  in the clinical  
setting.   There are  currently  two standalone AMG -based  monitors available for clinical use:  the 
STIMPOD  (Xavant  Technologies,  Pretoria,  South Africa) and  the ToFscan  (Draeger Medical  
Inc., Telford,  PA).   These devices  represent  improvements in  AMG technology over its  
predecessor,  the TOF -Watch  (Schering -Plough Corp., Kenilworth, NJ,  [LOCATION_003])  as they utilize  three

the thumb, as  well  instances  of awakening  patients  moving their  thumb during measurements.   
Kinemyography (KMG)  is based  on similar  principles to  AMG, and  relies  on the thumb being 
able to  move freely.   Upon  neurostimulation, KMG utilizes  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_370234].  The  degree  of this  
bending is  quantified and used  to determine  a TOF  ratio.   While  Datex -Ohmeda (Helsinki,  
Finland) manufactures  a KMG device that  can be incorporated into  the anesthesia work  station,  
there are  no currently  available  standalone KMG devices.   Electromyography (EMG) devices  
measure electrical  activity,  termed  compound muscle  action  potentials  (cMAPs)  following nerve 
stimulation  (typi[INVESTIGATOR_370235]).   As EMG  
measures  cMAPs  and does  not require  freely  moving thumbs for accurate measurements,  many  
experts  have referred  to this monitoring modality  as the “new  gold standard”.  TetraGraph  
(Senzime  AB,  Uppsala,  Sweden)  is a standalone EMG -based  device that  recently  received  
Conformité Européene (CE)  approval.    We  have  pre viously investigated  this device and  
presented  our findings at several  annual meetings  such as International  Anesthesia Research  
Society  (May  2018, May  2017, May  2013), the Society  for Technology in  Anesthesia (January  
2018), and  the American  Society  of Anesthesiologists (Octotober 2017, October  2012), 
European Society  of Anaesthesiology (June 2018, June 2015).  Furthermore, we  have recently  
submitted  abstracts  to the PostGraduate Assembly  in Anesthesiology in  December  2018 as  well  
as a manuscrip t describing  a multi- center,  volunteer study investigating  TetraGraph  versus 
AMG- based  monitors.  Our work  thus far has  found this  device to  be easy  to apply, reliable,  and 
able to  provide comparable measurements  to other quantitative  monitors.   
Utilizing  recommendations  from  the  Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines for monitoring of  
neuromuscular function (Fuchs-Buder et  al. 2007), we  will investigate  the performance of  the 
TetraGraph  in patients  recovering  from  anesthesia  in the PACU.   The  postoperative setting  is 
particularly  important,  as several  previous studies performed  in awakening  patients  have reported  
discordant TOF  ratios: accelerographic TOF  ratios  were not an  accurate representation  of the 
neuromuscular status  (recovery)  of the patients  (Baillard  et al. 2004). We  plan  to compare two  
portable quantitative  monitors,  the EMG -based  TetraGraph  and the AMG- based  ToFscan.   
ToFscan  has recently  been  described  as an acceptabl e surrogate  for research  purposes to  the 
frequently used  TOF -Watch  (Murphy  et al. 2018).  The  TOF -Watch  monitor, however, is  no 
longer manufactured, while  the ToFscan  is commercially  available and  approved by  [CONTACT_370245]  (FDA).   While  the ToFscan  has a three -dimensional sensor 
that can measure acceleration  in multiple  planes,  it still has  the same limitations  associated  with 
muscle  movement inherent to  AMG- based  quantitative monitors.  This  is of particular  
importance in  the recovery  room when  patients  may  not be  fully  cooperative when  quantitative  
monitoring is  warranted  to exclude postoperative residual  weakness  as a cause of patient  distr ess.

• Review of medical record  
• Informed Consent - Patients will be identified  during their preoperative appointment and 
introduced to a study; they will be provided with a copy of the consent document and 
information about the study. The consenting will take place after additional discussion on the day of surgery.   
9.2 Visit 2  (Random ization and Treatment  – day of surgery) 
 
• Elective surgical procedure as per standard of care  
• Intraoperative neuromuscular blockade, management, and neuromuscular antagonism 
will be at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist.  
• Upon arrival to the PACU, consenting patients will be randomized to have the 
TetraGraph placed on either their dominant or non-dominant arm TetraGraph uses proprietary, single- use surface electrodes (TetraSens
TM, Senzime AB, Uppsala, Sweden) 
with stimulating electrodes placed over the ulnar nerve, a reference electrode placed on the adductor pollicis  (1st digit) ( Figure 16.1
).  The skin will be prepped with careful 
abrasion and cleansing of the skin in the usual fashion prior to electrode placement.  
• ToFscan will be placed on the patient’s opposite arm.  Stimulating electrodes (Red Dot 
ECG electrodes, 3M, St. Paul, MN) will be placed over the ulnar nerve with the negative 
electrode near the wrist crease and positive electrode placed 3 -4 cm proximally.  The skin 
will be prepped with careful abrasion and cleansing of the skin in the usual fashion prior to electrode placement. The ToFscan utilizes a thumb splint with the encased transducer secured to the hand ( Figure 16.2
).  
• To obtain measurements with TetraGraph, TOF stimulation will be performed at 50mA 
and the measurement recorded. This measurement will be repeated twice, 20 seconds 
apart.  If the two measurements differ by >10%, a third measurement will be recorded, with the closest two readings kept and the outlier discarded.  If TetraGraph yields a train-of-four count but not a ratio with any measurement, this will be recorded.  
• To obtain ToFscan measurements, TOF stimulation will be performed and the 
measurement recorded.  According to the manufacturer, the ToFscan does not require 
calibration, and the default stimulating current is 50 mA.  The TOF measurement will be repeated twice, 20 seconds apart. If the measurements di ffer by >10%, a third 
measurement will be repeated, with the closest two readings kept and the outlier discarded.  If TetraGraph yields a train -of-four count but not a ratio with any 
measurement, this will be recorded.  
• Each  neurostimulation with the Tetra Graph  and ToF scan will be conducted 
simultaneously with two observers. Patients  will be queried as to the level of discomfort 
associated with obtaining measurements ( Figure 16.3
).  We have previously utilized this 
scoring system for a large, multi- center volunteer trial (manuscript submitted). If patients 
are unable to quantify their discomfort, this will be documented. 
• The above described  process will be repeated for both monitors upon arrival to PACU 
and after 5 minutes and 10 min utes into the PACU stay.

• Following measurements obtained with both devices at these specified time intervals and 
assuming TOF ratio is >0.9, the devices will be removed and the patient will proceed 
along the standard recovery pathway.  
• If at any point the patient describes the discomfort associated with neurostimulation as a 
verbal numeric score of 7 or higher, the patient will be given the option to discontinue the 
study.  
• Prior to discharge from PACU, patients will be asked to recall if they had a neurostimulation. If th ey do recall it, we will again query the level of discomfort 
associated with obtaining measurements ( Figure 16.3

10.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
 
Analysis  of agreement  between  the devices  will be assessed  using the method  described  by 
[CONTACT_370247]  (Olofsen  et al. 2015).  The  bias is defined  as the mean  difference of  repeated  
measurements  from  the ToFscan  and the TetraGraph  obtained at  the same time intervals.  The 
limits  of agreement  are defined  as bias ± [ADDRESS_463211]  deviations of the 
differences.   Limits  of agreement  are interpreted  as the reference range  within  which  95% of the 
differences  will lie.   The  bias and the limits  of agreements  surrounding the bias (± 2 SD)  will be 
calculated  with 95% confidence intervals.   Repeatability  between  the two  devices  at the various 
time intervals  will also  be assessed  with  significance defined  as a p-value <0.05.  
 
Handling of Missing Data 
 
This is a prospective study and therefore we do not anticipate any missing data.  In the event of 
any unexpected missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made; missing data 
will simply be treated as missing in the statistical analysis.  
 
10.[ADDRESS_463212] Population(s) for Analysis  
 
Each participant who goes through the recovery processes in the PACU and completes 
monitoring of residual neuromuscular blockade will be included in the primary analysis regardless of study withdrawal for any reason. In the event of any study withdrawals, in secondary analysis we will examine the sensitivity of our results to the exclusion of patients who 
withdrew.

11.1.3  Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well 
defined and include; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity  
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• birth defect/anomaly  
 and/or per protocol may be problems/events that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_37021]-investigator may have adversely affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.  
  All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious , should be regarded as non-
serious adverse events .

11.[ADDRESS_463215] seek information on adverse events by 
[CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section  of the electronic case report form (CRF). All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic , laboratory or procedure results should recorded in the source document. 
 All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the  probable cause.  Serious adverse

  11/Oct/[ADDRESS_463216] the study participant and then co mplete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet 
and log.  The sponsor- investigator will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up 
and reporting required.  
11.3.1 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB   
 
The sponsor-investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68258]- UPI[INVESTIGATOR_68259]. Each participating  site will report SAEs to 
their respective IRB or Ethics Committee with copy of submission and review provided to the leading site. Should there be any SAEs at any of the participating sites;  the study team at that site 
will notify the primary site (Mayo C linic in [LOCATION_012]) within 24 hours of learning of the event.  
 Any serious adverse event (SAE) which the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_205274] a 
UPI[INVESTIGATOR_370238] [ADDRESS_463217] learns of the problem/event.  The following i nformation will be collected on the adverse event worksheet (and entered in the 
research database):  
• Study ID  
• Disease  
• The date the adverse event occurred  
• Description of the adverse event  
• Relationship of the adverse event to the researc h device*  
• Determination if the adverse event was expected   
• The severity of the adverse event ( severity scale described below **) 
• If any intervention  was necessary  
• Resolution (was the incident resolved spontaneously, or after discontinuing treatment) 
• Date of Resolution 
 
The sponsor- investigator will review all adverse event reports to determine if specific reports 
need to be made to the IRB .  The sponsor- investigator will sign  and date the adverse event report 
when it is reviewed.  For this protocol, only directly related SAEs /UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] s will be reported to 
the IRB.

ToFscan vs TetraGraph   Version 3.0 
  11/Oct/19  
Page 20 of 30 
J. Ross Renew , MD   CONFIDENTIAL  The relationship of an AE to the Investigational  Device is a clinical decision by [CONTACT_456]-
investigator (PI) based on all available information at the time of the completion of the eCRF and 
is graded as follows:  
 1. Not related: a reaction for which sufficient information exists to indicate that the etiolog y is 
unrelated to the use and proper application of study d evice.  
 2. Unlikely : a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship 
to use of the study device which makes a causal relationship improbable and in which use o f 
other devices , chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations. 
 3. Possible: a clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to use of the study device but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_370248] . 
 4. Probable: a clinical event including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to use of the study device, unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or use of other devices  or chemicals . 
 5. Definite: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the use of the study device.  
  
** Severity Scale  
 
The maximum intensity of an AE during a day should be graded according to the definitions 
below and recorded in details as indicated on the CRF. If the intensity of an AE changes over a number of days, then separate entries should be made having distinct onset dates.  
 1. Mild: AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere with patient’s  daily activities.  
 2. Moderate: AEs typi[INVESTIGATOR_258812] a low level of inconvenience or concern to the patient and may interfere with dail y activities, but are usually ameliorated by [CONTACT_14212].  
 3. Severe: AEs interrupt a patient's usual daily activity and traditionally require  systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment.  
 
11.4 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (at each participating site) to oversee the 
safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and 
appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as well as the construction and impleme ntation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study Monitoring, 
Auditing, and Inspecting”).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
ToFscan vs TetraGraph   Version 3.0 
  11/Oct/[ADDRESS_463218] of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization infor ming the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to coll ect at least vital status (long term survival status that 
the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period. 
12.2 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other 
activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contai ned in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records 
include: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_370239].  
12.3 Case Report Forms  
 
All data necessary for this study will be obtained from EHR  or at the time d evices are being used

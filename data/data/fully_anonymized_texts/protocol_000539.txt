Detailed Consent Form: Why am I being invited to take part in a research study? We invite you to take part in a research study because you are scheduled for an induction of labor at GW, you are 18 years or older, and you speak English.

You may ask all the questions you want before you decide whether to participate. • Participation is voluntary; whether or not you take part is up to you. • You can agree to take part and later change your mind. • Your decision not to take part or to stop your participation will not be held against you. • Your decision will not affect the medical care you receive from GW. If you decide not to take part, you can still receive medical care from GW. • You may take this document home to read or to discuss with your family members or doctor before deciding to take part in this research study. Why is this research being done? Video-based educational tools have been shown to be an effective form of counseling, sometimes even more effective than traditional in-person counseling methods. We have created a brief, 3-minute video, that discusses the induction of labor process. Some of you will be shown this video. The aim of this study is to evaluate if the persons who were shown the video have a higher knowledge about the induction process and higher satisfaction with the overall induction. The benefits of this study are that you will help us evaluate if video-based educational tools would be helpful in spreading knowledge to our patients in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. If you decide to not participate in the research, your induction process will not be affected and you will receive the same care.  How long will I be in the study? We expect that you will be in this research study for total time of 2-7 days. However, there will be only two times that you are asked to fill out a survey, one at the induction of labor visit and one 24-28 hours after delivery. These surveys are not longer than 3 minutes each. If you are asked to watch a video, it is 3 minutes long. How many people will take part in this research study? We would like to recruit 106 people to take part in the entire study.

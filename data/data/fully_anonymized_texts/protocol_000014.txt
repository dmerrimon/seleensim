237I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE:
38The association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcomes in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] 
39patients with and without diabetes is well established 1-5. Extensive data from observational and 
40prospective randomized controlled trials (RCT) in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289679] a strong 
41association between hyperglycemia and poor clinical outcome, such as increased mortality, 
42morbidity, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7577] (LOS), infections and overall complications 1,4,6-8.  Clinical 
43trials in both critically ill and in non-ICU medicine and surgery patients have shown that 
44improvement of glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia reduces LOS, systemic 
45infections 9-[ADDRESS_783301] shown that basal bolus treatment with glargine U100 
47improve glycemic control and reduce the rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593670] 
48regular insulin (SSI)12-14. In general surgery patients, the basal bolus approach results in 
49significant reduction in a composite of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593671] 
50infection, pneumonia, bacteremia, and acute renal and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].15 The hypoglycemia 
51rate was reported in 3% in medicine 12 and 12% in surgery [ADDRESS_783302] recommended the use of basal 
53bolus approach as the preferred insulin regimen for the management of non-ICU patients with 
54diabetes 15-17. 
55
56The Food and Drug Administration and the European Commission recently approved 
57insulin degludec for the treatment of patients with diabetes. Insulin degludec, a long-acting basal 
58insulin analog with a half-life of >25 hours and activity of >40 hours 18,19, results in comparable 
59glycemic control to glargine 19-21, but with lower rates of hypoglycemia 19,20,22. The efficacy and 
60safety of degludec is well documented in ambulatory patients; however, no studies have assessed 
61the safety and efficacy of these new formulations in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Although we can 
62anticipate a reduced number of hypoglycemic events with insulin degludec, certain features 
63needs to be investigated in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_410090] 1) prolonged duration of action, which may 
64limit the ability to make day-to-day adjustments in insulin dosage; 2) a steady-state insulin 
65concentration achieved after second or third day of therapy 21,23; and limited safety data in 
66acutely ill patients with altered nutritional status. Accordingly, the present pi[INVESTIGATOR_37087] 
67will compare the efficacy and safety of a basal bolus regimen with degludec U100 and glargine 
68U100 in medicine and surgery patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
[ADDRESS_783303] reported that 
72treatment with degludec results in comparable improvement in HbA1c levels and in lower rates 
73of hypoglycemia compared to glargine U100 insulin. No previous studies; however, have 
74compared the safety and efficacy of the long-acting basal insulin degludec in the inpatient 
75management of patients with diabetes. It is expected that a large number of patients with diabetes 
76will be started or transitioned to this new insulin formulation; so acquiring knowledge on their 
77safety and efficacy is of great clinical interest. Accordingly, the proposed study will provide 
78novel and clinically useful information on the efficacy (BG control) and safety (hypoglycemia) 
79of degludec in the inpatient setting and after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593672] 
80patients with T2D.

382II. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
83Objective 1.  To determine differences in inpatient glycemic control, as measured by [CONTACT_8477] 
84daily blood glucose concentration and the frequency of hypoglycemia in general medicine 
85and surgery patients with T2D treated with basal bolus regimen with insulin degludec or 
86glargine once daily plus aspart insulin before meals.  We will analyze a total of 180 subjects 
87with T2D treated prior to admission with diet, oral hypoglycemic agents, short-acting GLP1-RA 
88(except long-acting exenatide, dulaglutide and albiglutide), or insulin therapy (except degludec 
89and glargine U300) will be included in this prospective, randomized, open label trial to compare 
90the safety and efficacy of a basal bolus regimen with degludec and glargine in patients with T2D 
91admitted to general medicine and surgery services. Secondary end points include length of stay, 
92hospi[INVESTIGATOR_77085], and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5394].
93
94Objective 2:  To determine differences in glycemic control after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593673] 
95treatment with degludec and glargine in medicine and surgery patients T2D.  Patients with 
96poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c ≥7.0%) enrolled in Aim 1 will be invited to participate in this 
97open label prospective outpatient study. At hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345], patients will be treated following 
98an HbA1c based algorithm24 for a total duration of the outpatient follow-up of 3 months (see 
99hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593674], page 7).  
100
101III. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
102III.A Study Hypothesis (hypotheses):
103Hypothesis #1: Treatment with degludec and glargine will result in equivalent glycemic control 
104in general medicine and surgery patients with T2D. Degludec will result in lower number of 
105hypoglycemia compared to glargine.
106
107Hypothesis: treatment with degludec and glargine will result in a similar improvement in HbA1c 
108levels after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Degludec will result in lower number of hypoglycemia compared 
109to glargine.
110
111III.B Endpoints:
112The primary endpoint of the trial is non-inferiority in mean differences between treatment groups 
113in their mean blood glucose concentrations during the first 10 days of therapy (non-inferiority 
114will be determined at a difference <18 mg/dl). All participants who receive ≥ 2 doses of study 
115drug will be included in the analysis.
116
117Secondary outcomes include differences between treatment groups in any of the following 
118measures: Endpoints 1-4 (glycemic control) will be analyzed during the first 10 days of therapy 
119and endpoints 5, 7, 8, and 9 (length of stay and complications) will be analyzed during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
120stay. Endpoint 6 (readmissions) will be evaluated up to 12 weeks after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].

135III.C Study type:
136This is a prospective, randomized, open label multicenter trial to compare the safety and efficacy 
137of a basal bolus regimen with degludec and glargine in patients with T2D admitted to general 
138medicine and surgery services.
139
140This study will include male or female subjects > 18 years. Due to the design of this hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
141study, there will be no run-in period.  Upon arrival to the emergency department or medical or 
142general surgical wards, subjects will be screened. A total of 180 subjects will be analyzed. A 
143maximum of 108 (60%) surgical or medical patients will be randomized in the study to ensure a 
144balanced proportion of each group is included. Patients with a known history of T2D treated with 
145diet alone, any combination of OADs, short acting GLP-1 RA (liraglutide or exenatide) and 
146insulin prior to admission will be considered potential candidates for this study. Patients treated 
147with degludec, glargine U300 or with long-acting GLP1-RA (dulaglutide, albiglutide and weekly 
148exenatide) prior to admission will be excluded. Patients admitted with acute or chronic medical 
149illnesses, emergency or elective surgical procedures and trauma would be included in the study. 
150
151Insulin therapy will be aimed to maintain fasting and pre-meal blood glucose levels between 100 
152mg/dl and 180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels between 70 and 100 
153mg/dL are still considered at goal, however BG values in this range will trigger insulin 
154adjustment to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia as recommended by [CONTACT_593687]. 
155Patients with T2D will be randomized to receive:
156Group 1.  Basal bolus with degludec once daily and aspart insulin before meals (n=90)
157Group 2.  Basal bolus with glargine U100 once daily and aspart insulin before meals (n=90)
158
159Aim 1.  Inpatient (Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) Arm: Patients will be treated with a basal bolus insulin regimen as 
160previously reported.12-14,16  In brief, subjects treated with insulin prior to admission will receive 
[ZIP_CODE]% of the total daily outpatient insulin dose given. Insulin naïve patients will discontinue oral 
162agents and will receive a starting total daily dose (TDD) of 0.4 U/kg/day for BG between 140 
163mg/dl and 400 mg/dL. The starting TDD will be reduced to 0.3 U/kg/day in patients ≥ 70 years 
164or with a GFR < 60 ml/min. Both groups will be treated with bolus regimen given half of TDD 
165as basal (degludec or glargine) once daily and half as aspart divided in three equal doses before 
166meals. Patients with poor oral intake or with medical instruction to withhold oral intake (NPO) 
Degludec Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593669] 17, 2020
5167will receive the basal dose, but prandial dose will be held.14 Insulin dose will be adjusted daily to 
168maintain a fasting and pre-dinner BG between 100 mg/dl and 180 mg/dl.
169
170Initiation and Dosing of Basal insulin
171Patients treated with insulin prior to admission will receive 80% of their total home daily insulin 
172dose.  Half of the total daily dose will be given as basal degludec/glargine) and half as prandial 
173(aspart) insulin.  The basal insulin will be given at the same time every day.  The prandial 
174(aspart) insulin will be held in patients with poor oral intake or NPO, but they will receive the 
175usual basal insulin dose.
176Insulin naïve patients will receive a starting insulin dose of 0.4 U/kg/day. Half of the total daily 
177dose will be given as basal degludec/glargine) and half as prandial (aspart) insulin.  The basal 
178insulin will be given at the same time every day.  The prandial (aspart) insulin will be held in 
179patients with poor oral intake or NPO, but they will receive the usual basal insulin dose.
180Adjustment/Titration of daily insulin dose:
181The basal insulin dose will be adjusted daily per fasting blood glucose concentration. The target 
182BG concentration during insulin treatment is 100-180 mg/dl.  The daily basal (degludec/glargine) 
183dose will be increased by 10% if the fasting BG is between 180 and 240 mg/dl or by 20% if 
184fasting BG concentration is >240 mg/dL  The total daily insulin dose (basal and prandial insulin) 
185will be increased by 20% in patients with mean BG > 240 mg/dl.  In addition, the basal insulin 
186dose will be reduced by 10% if any BG is between 70-100 mg/dl, and by 20% in patients with 
187any BG < 70 mg/dl.  The total daily dose will be reduced 30-40% in the event of severe 
188hypoglycemia (BG < 40 mg/dl).
189Several clamp studies in patients with type [ADDRESS_783304]. 
194 Treatment randomization.  Patients will be randomized using a computer-generated 
195randomization table. Treatment randomization/assignment will be coordinated by [CONTACT_53775] 
196pharmacy. A research pharmacist at each institution will follow a computer-generated block 
197randomization table based on glucose levels (BG≤200 or BG>200) at randomization.

201
202Patients Treated with Insulin Prior to Admission
203Discontinue oral antidiabetic drugs on admission.
204Subjects treated with insulin prior to admission will receive 80% or 100 % of the total daily 
205dose (TDD) given as basal bolus regimen.  
206
207Starting Insulin Doses:
208-BG < 200 mg/dl give 80% of TDD*
209-BG ≥ 200 mg/dl give 100% of TDD*
210
Degludec Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593669] 17, 2020
6211
212Half of TDD will be given as degludec or glargine and half as rapid-acting insulin.  
213Degludec and glargine will be given once daily at the same time of the day
214Patients will receive the full-dose of degludec or glargine (even if NPO) the day of 
215surgery or diagnostic procedure(s).    
216Aspart insulin will be given in three equally divided doses before each meal.  To prevent 
217hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, aspart insulin dose will be held.
218* If patient was on basal only therapy consider adding prandial dose as calculated above.
219
220Insulin Naïve Patients Treated with Oral Agents or GLP1-RAs
221Discontinue oral antidiabetic drugs on admission.
222Starting total daily insulin dose: 
2230.4 U/Kg/day when randomization BG between 140-400 mg/dL
224Reduce TDD to 0.3 units per kg in patients ≥ 70 years of age and/or with an eGFR < 
[ZIP_CODE] ml/min.
226Half of TDD will be given as glargine or degludec and half as aspart.  
227Degludec or glargine will be given once daily, at the same time of the day.  
228Patients will receive the full-dose of degludec or glargine insulin (even if NPO) the day 
229of surgery or diagnostic procedure(s).    
230Aspart insulin will be given in three equally divided doses before meals. To prevent 
231hypoglycemia, if a subject is not able to eat, the dose of aspart insulin will be held. 
232
233Supplemental insulin. Aspart insulin will be administered following the “supplemental or 
234correction insulin scale” protocol (Appendix 1, page 21). Supplemental doses will be given for 
235BG > 140 mg/dl before meals.  At bedtime, supplemental insulin will be reserved for patients 
236with BG > 250 mg/dl. 
237If a patient is able and expected to eat most of his/her meals, supplemental insulin will be 
238administered before meals and at bedtime following the “usual” dose of the insulin scale 
239protocol.
240If a patient is not able to eat, supplemental insulin will be administered every 6 hours 
241(Appendix 1) following the “sensitive” dose of the supplemental insulin scale protocol.
242
243Basal Insulin adjustment.  
244Daily basal insulin dose will be adjusted as follow: 
245If the fasting and/or pre-dinner BG is between 100 - 140 mg/dl in the absence of 
246hypoglycemia the previous day: no change 
247If the fasting and/or pre-dinner BG is between 141 - 180 mg/dl in the absence of 
248hypoglycemia: increase basal insulin by 10% every day*
249If the fasting and/or pre-dinner BG is 181 – 299 mg/dl in the absence of 
250hypoglycemia the previous day: increase basal insulin (degludec or glargine) dose by 
[ZIP_CODE]% every day* 
252If the fasting and/or pre-dinner BG is ≥ 300 mg/dl in the absence of hypoglycemia the 
253previous day: increase basal insulin (glargine) dose by 30% every day*
254If the fasting and pre-dinner BG is between 70 - 99 mg/dl in the absence of 
255hypoglycemia: decrease TDD (basal and prandial) insulin dose by 10% every day
Degludec Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593669] 17, 2020
7256If a patient develops hypoglycemia (BG <70 mg/dL), the insulin TDD (basal and 
257prandial) should be decreased by 20%.  
258If a patient develops severe hypoglycemia (BG <40 mg/dL), the insulin TDD (basal 
259and prandial) should be decreased by 30-40%.  
260*Consider adjusting prandial dose according to medical discretion
261
262Aim 2:  Outpatient (Post-Discharge) Arm: To determine differences in glycemic control 
263after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593675] 
264surgery patients T2D.  We will compare the efficacy and safety of degludec and glargine after 
265hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  Several outpatient insulin trials have shown that treatment with degludec 
266results in similar improvement in glycemic control 19,20,28, but in significant reduction in 
267hypoglycemia. We expect that degludec treatment will be a safer alternative to current use of 
268glargine U100 formulation.
269 
270 Insulin Discharge algorithm: 
271Patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c ≥7.0 %) enrolled in Aim 1 will be invited to 
272participate in this open label prospective outpatient study. The total duration of the study is 3 
273months. Patients with an HbA1c between 7.0% and 10% will be discharged on preadmission oral 
274antidiabetic agents plus degludec or glargine once daily. Patients with an admission A1C ≥ 10% 
275will be discharged on basal bolus regimen with degludec or glargine and aspart insulin before 
276meals.  Participants will be trained in using each devices including how to differentiate these 
277from each other (rapid acting from long acting insulin).
278                                                                         **

330Rationale for study Design
331
332Aim 1, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]:  Several studies have shown improved clinical outcome with improved 
333glycemic control in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9645] T2D 4,5,9,11,29-31. RCTs in medicine and surgical 
334patients with T2D have shown that basal bolus regimen with glargine results in a lower mean 
335daily BG concentration compared to the sole use of SSI and in lower rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] 
336complications (see preliminary results section). Insulin degludec results in similar improvement 
337but in lower rate of hypoglycemia than treatment with glargine 19,20,28. No previous studies; 
338however, have compared the efficacy and safety of degludec and glargine in the management of 
339hyperglycemia and diabetes in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885].  Determining the safety and efficacy of new 
340insulin formulations in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], an environment associated with reduced insulin sensitivity 
341and altered nutritional intake, is an exceedingly important clinical question. 
342
343Aim 2, Outpatient (post-discharge):  Few studies have addressed the efficacy of insulin alone 
344or in combination with oral agents after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. In a recent study (see preliminary 
345results section), patients were discharged on a combination of OADs and glargine U100 insulin 
346or on a basal bolus regimen according to HbA1c levels and achieved a marked reduction in 
347HbA1c from 8.75% on admission to 7.9% and 7.35% after 4 and 12 weeks of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. 
348However, the use of glargine U100 alone or in combination to oral agents or as basal bolus 
349insulin resulted in 30% and close to 40% incidence of hypoglycemia, respectively. In this study, 
350we will compare the efficacy and safety of degludec and glargine after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345].  
351Several outpatient insulin trials have shown that treatment with degludec results in similar 
352improvement in glycemic control 19,20,28, but in significant reduction in hypoglycemia. Thus we 
353expect that degludec treatment will be a safer alternative to current use of glargine U100 
354formulation.

423V. Visit Procedures
424Upon arrival to the emergency department or medical or general surgical wards, subjects will be 
425screened.  Patients with a known history of T2D treated with diet alone, any combination of 
426OADs, and insulin prior to admission will be considered potential candidates for this study. 
427Patients admitted with acute or chronic medical illnesses, emergency or elective surgical 
428procedures and trauma would be included in the study. 
429Patients will be treated with a basal bolus insulin regimen as previously reported.  In brief, 
430subjects treated with insulin prior to admission will receive 80% of the total daily outpatient 
431insulin dose given. Insulin naïve patients will discontinue oral agents and will receive a starting 
432total daily dose (TDD) of 0.4 U/kg/day for BG between 140 mg/dl and 400 mg/dL. The starting 
433TDD will be reduced to 0.3 U/kg/day in patients ≥ 70 years or with a GFR < 60 ml/min. Both 
434groups will be treated with bolus regimen given half of TDD as basal (degludec or glargine) once 
435daily and half as aspart divided in three equal doses before meals. Patients with poor oral intake 
436or to be kept NPO will receive the basal dose, but prandial dose will be held.14 Insulin dose will 
437be adjusted daily to maintain a fasting and pre-dinner BG between 80 mg/dl and 180 mg/dl.

[ADDRESS_783316] risks:
462We will follow safeguards to minimize the risk to our subjects: a) we will carefully monitor 
463capi[INVESTIGATOR_593677] a hand-held glucose meter, b) only experienced nurses/or 
464phlebotomist will draw blood samples, and c) women of reproductive age who are sexually 
465active will undergo a urine pregnancy tests prior to participation in the study.  To prevent 
466significant clinical events, no patients with history of significant liver (diagnosed liver cirrhosis 
467and portal hypertension), renal impairment (eGFR<30ml/min/1.73m2) or severe cardiac failure 
468will be recruited in this study.   
469Hypoglycemia:  It is possible that following the proposed protocol, patients receiving 
470insulin degludec or glargine may develop hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia (BG < 70 
471mg/dl) in non-ICU patients treated with subcutaneous insulin is between 5–30% 13,33-35. The 
472number of hypoglycemia (< 70, < 54 and < 40 mg/dl) will be analyzed statistically. For the 
473purpose of this analysis, hypoglycemia is defined as follows: 1) BG < 70mg/dL is a glucose alert 
474value, 2) BG < 54 mg/dL will be considered as clinically important hypoglycemia, and 3) Severe 
475hypoglycemia, will be defined as a BG < 40 mg/dl.16,[ADDRESS_783317] that approximately 10% in the 
476inpatient setting and ~20% in the outpatient (post-discharge) arm will experience one or more 
477epi[INVESTIGATOR_17221].  To minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, the starting dose will be 
478reduced in the basal bolus insulin regimen (TDD: 0.4 units per kg of body weight), in addition, in 
479patients ≥ 70 years of age and/or eGFR < 60 ml/min the TTD will be further reduce to 0.3 
480units/kg.  To avoid hypoglycemia, the total daily dose of insulin will be decreased by 10% for 
481BG between 70-99 mg/dl and by 20% after each epi[INVESTIGATOR_51943] (BG < 70 mg/dl).  In 
482addition, in patients treated with insulin at home, the TDD of insulin will be reduced by 20% on 
483admission and the attending physician may further reduce insulin dose in the presence of severe 
484hypoglycemia.
485
486Hypoglycemia will be treated with dextrose infusion.  Dextrose 50% solution will be given for 
487glucose values < 70 mg/dl.  If the patient is awake, 25 ml (1/2 amp) will be given IV or oral 
488juice/snack (crackers) as per protocol.  If the patient is not awake:  50ml (1 amp) will be given 
489STAT.  Blood glucose levels will be repeated in 15 minutes and dextrose administration will be 
490repeated as needed for values < 70 mg/dl.  
[ADDRESS_783318] Compliance
493Aim 1.  Inpatient (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) trial.  We will use electronic medical records and nursing records to 
494document day and time of insulin administration of study drug (degludec and glargine) given 
495once daily and prandial- rapid-acting insulin (aspart) given before meals. We will also record 
496dose and number of units given as supplement (correction) to correct hyperglycemia.
497
498Aim 2.  Patients will be contact[CONTACT_457] 2 weeks after discharge by a study coordinator to assess 
499insulin administration, glycemic control, hypoglycemia and medication adherence.  Patients are 
500to bring all used and unused insulin pens (study drug).  Patients will keep daily record of time 
501and dose of insulin administered every day during the study period.
502
503VI.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
Degludec Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593669] 17, 2020
14504VI.A Aim 1.  To determine differences in inpatient glycemic control in patients treated with 
505degludec or glargine in patients with T2D. 
506Sample Size and Power Calculations: 
507The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control measured by [CONTACT_593689] 
508concentration.  To show the non-inferiority of degludec and glargine in terms of glycemic 
509control, we set the equivalence margin as 18 mg/dl (1 mosm/l), from a view that a difference <18 
510mg/dl is usually not considered as clinically significant 12-14,37. Based on the results of the Rabbit 
511medicine and surgery trials, it is reasonable to assume the standard deviation of mean daily BG is 
512bounded above by 45 mg/dl. Assuming the true BG difference between the treatment groups is 
513zero, and using one-sided, two-sample t-tests, we require 78 subjects for each treatment group to 
514achieve 80% power with alpha=0.05. Accounting for 10-14% attrition rate, we would need 90 
515patients per treatment group, which means 180 subjects in total, to achieve >80% power in Aim 
5161. 
517
518Analysis of Primary Endpoint:
519The primary endpoint for Aim [ADDRESS_783319] 10 days of therapy (non-inferiority 
521will be determined at a difference <18 mg/dl). Blood glucose will be measured before each meal 
522and at bedtime. Average mean daily BG between the two study groups will also be compared 
523based on the nonparametric Wilcoxon tests. We will also perform cross-sectional analysis of 
524mean daily BG recorded on different days based on Wilcoxon tests or linear regression that 
525accounts for potential confounders. In addition, we will conduct repeated measures ANOVA or 
526repeated measures linear regression to estimate and test the difference in mean daily BG between 
527the two treatment groups while simultaneously examining mean daily BG across multiple days 
528during treatment. Transformations will be applied if normality violation is detected. Stepwise, 
529backward, or forward model selection strategy will be adopted to determine the variables to be 
530included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and model checking procedures will be applied 
531to examine the fit of the developed models.
532Analysis of Secondary Endpoints:
533Secondary endpoints for Aim 1 in this study include incidence of hypoglycemia, number of 
534hypoglycemic events, number of severe hyperglycemia, mean daily fasting BG, daily insulin 
535dose, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], acute renal failure and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_34380]. Blood glucose will be 
536measured before each meal and at bedtime.  For discrete outcomes (such as hypoglycemia 
537outcomes), we will first conduct nonparametric comparisons based on a two-sided Chi-square 
538test (or Fisher’s exact test), followed by [CONTACT_25549]-Mantel-Haenszel test, which adjusts for the 
539potential center effect. We will further conduct logistic regression (for binary outcomes) and 
540Poisson or Negative Binomial regression (for count outcomes) to assess and estimate the 
541treatment effect while adjusting for potential confounders. We will analyze continuous secondary 
542outcomes by [CONTACT_593690]. 
543
544
545VI.B Aim 2: Sample Size and Power Calculations:  The primary endpoint in Aim 2 is 
546difference in glycemic control (mean daily BG) after hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Under the same 
547assumptions for equivalence margin and BG variability as in Aim 1, we have the same sample 
548size requirement (i.e. 78 subjects per group after 10% attrition). Accounting for 10-14% attrition 
549rate, we would need 90 patients per treatment group, which means 180 subjects in total, to 
550achieve >80% power.

552Analysis of Primary Endpoint:  The primary endpoint in this study is glycemic control 
553measured by [CONTACT_593691][INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Secondary outcomes include 
554rate of hypoglycemia during follow-up, change in HbA1c, body weight, number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_4101] 
555severe hyperglycemia, complications and emergency room visits or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_449543] [ADDRESS_783320] compare the primary outcome 
558using two-sample t-tests (or Wilcoxon tests) or one-way ANOVA, followed by [CONTACT_593692] 
559linear regression to estimate and test the difference between the two treatment groups while 
560simultaneously accounting for other potential confounders. Transformations will be applied if 
561normality violation is detected. Stepwise, backward, or forward model selection strategy will be 
562adopted to determine the variables to be included in the final model. Standard diagnostic and 
563model checking procedures will be applied to examine the fit of the developed models.

646Definitions:
647During the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_289683] (Aim 1), all oral agents and insulin formulations will be discontinued at 
648randomization and patients will be treated as per study protocol with degludec/glargine as basal 
649bolus regimen with aspart as prandial insulin.  
650After discharge, patients will be treated with glargine or degludec insulin alone or in 
651combination with oral agents according to HbA1c levels. 
652
653XII. ADVERSE EVENTS:
654Definition:  An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject 
655administered a product, and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this 
656treatment. An AE is an unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory 
657findings), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not 
658considered related to the product.
659This includes events from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed 
660consent and until post treatment follow-up period (telephone contact [ADDRESS_783329] study 
661visit).
662AEs include a clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness and clinical laboratory 
663adverse event (CLAE).  An AE is either a serious AE (SAE) or a non-serious AE.
664
665The following AEs will be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no 
666other seriousness criteria are applicable:
667- Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_36225]
668- Risk of liver injury defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase 
669(AST) >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law)
670-Death
671-A life-threatening event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event
672-Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593679]
673-Persistent or significant disability or incapacity
674-Important medical events that may not result in death, or a life threatening event but may 
675require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
676-Epi[INVESTIGATOR_593680].
677- A planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912]-existing condition, or a procedure required by [CONTACT_760], 
678without a serious deterioration in health, is not considered to be an SAE.

[ZIP_CODE]
680Severity Assessment Definitions:
681• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities
682• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities
683• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable
[ADDRESS_783330] Assessment Definitions:
686• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship
687• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed
688• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an aetiology other than the trial product
[ADDRESS_783331] treatment follow-up period, as 
693defined in the protocol. 
694
695Outcome Categories and Definitions:
696• Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_57676] 
697the level observed at the first trial related activity after the subject signed the informed consent
698• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. 
699This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial
700• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and significant 
701disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered with sequelae 
702should be rated as an SAE
703• Not recovered
704• Fatal
705• Unknown
706
707Reporting of adverse events:  All events meeting the definition of an AE must be collected and 
708reported. The events must be recorded in the AE form in a timely manner.  During each contact 
709with the trial site staff (site visits and telephone contacts), the subject will be asked about AEs. 
710After the ICF is signed, all adverse events related to protocol procedures are to be reported. 
711Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R): An SAE which is unexpected and 
712regarded as possibly or probably related to the trial/study product by [CONTACT_093]. Serious 
713adverse reaction (SAR): An Adverse event that fulfils both the criteria for a Serious Adverse 
714Event and the criteria for an Adverse Reaction.An SAE report should be completed for any event 
715where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.
716If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to 
717the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study 
718procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative section of the SAE Report Form.
719SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to Emory 
720IRB and Novo Nordisk by [CONTACT_40743]. SAEs must be recorded on an SAE Report Form or 
721similar form (e.g. CIOMS, MedWatch). 
722Within 15 days of becoming aware, the PI/sponsor will notify the FDA and all participating 
723investigators via IND safety reports of events that are unexpected, caused by [CONTACT_1758] 
724drug, and meet the FDA definition of “serious.”

726Reporting of pregnancies:  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding will not be 
727recruited in the study.  Female subjects will be instructed to notify the investigator immediately 
728if they become pregnant during the trial. The investigator must report any pregnancy to the 
729Emory IRB and Novo Nordisk. The pregnant subject will be asked to provide information about 
730her pregnancy, delivery and the health of her infant until age one month. If the infant has a 
731congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious adverse event.
732 
733Adverse events with additional data collection: Adverse events with additional data collection 
734are those events thought to be [potentially] associated with the investigational compound or 
735disease under study. The investigators will collect information on medical events of special 
736interest including hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia (BG > 240 mg/dl), cardiovascular events (heart 
737failure, acute myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation), and medication errors (e.g., incorrect 
738dose of insulin). 
[ADDRESS_783332] INSURANCE:
741Financial Obligation.
742No additional cost to patients or to the institution will be incurred for research purposes. Patients 
743will not be billed for the laboratory work or any test that is being done only for study purposes.  
744Novo Nordisk will provide the study drugs (degludec, glargine and aspart insulin) at no cost to 
745participants.  Patients will be responsible for the cost of their usual ongoing medical care, 
746including procedures and/or non-study medications that their doctor requires as part of their 
747usual medical care.
748
749Payment for Participation.    
750Participation in this study is voluntary.  Patients will receive one hundred dollars ($100.00) 
751during the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_593681]- five dollars ($75.00) after each clinic visit at 1 and 3 
752months after discharge. Total compensation will be two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00).
[ADDRESS_783333]. Umpi[INVESTIGATOR_593682] 
757institution, along with the medical facilities will make medical care available.  Emory University, 
758however, has not set aside any money to pay participants or to pay for their medical treatment. 
759The only exception is if it is proved that the injury or illness is directly caused by [CONTACT_593696] 
760of an Emory/Grady employee.  “Negligence” is the failure to follow a standard duty of care. 
761Financial compensation for such things as lost wages, disability or discomfort due to an injury 
762related to the study is not available.  
763
764XIV. Publication Plan:
765We anticipate completion of Aim 1 in September or October 2020 and Aim 2 in November 2020.  
766Data will be analyzed in December 2020 (aim 1) and in March 2021(aim 2).  One abstract will 
767be submitted to the [ADDRESS_783334] six months of 2021.

[ADDRESS_1167206] from unimodal, symptom -
based care, to an individualized, whole person, behavioral targeted approach for BRLP. 
In response to current evidence gaps, we are conducting a pi[INVESTIGATOR_839716] a future phase II multi -site randomized clinical trial (RCT). Informed by [CONTACT_839804]20 the Integrated SUPPORT ed Biopsychosocial Self -
Management for Back Related Leg Pain  trial will assess the comparative effectiveness of 
a novel supported self -management (SSM) intervention delivered by [CONTACT_839805] (MC). Importantly, our team has a unique opportunity to leverage 
recruitment from our ongoing clinical trial (NCCIH UH3AT008769), which excludes a large 
number of chronic BRLP patients. The R34 aims are:  
 
1.1. Aim One  
To conduct a Planning Phase to develop detailed protocols, train personnel, and secure 
regulatory approvals. We will place special emphasis on working with DCs and PTs to 
provide competency -based training in the SSM intervention. SSM focuses on whole 
perso n care delivery, and integrates psychosocial strategies (e.g. progressive muscle 
relaxation, relaxed breathing, guided imagery, pacing, relaxation, problem solving, 
cognitive restructuring, interpersonal communication) with physically oriented ones (e.g. 
exercises, SMT) specifically for chronic BRLP .  
 
1.2. Aim Two  
To assess feasibility of the SUPPORT trial through achievement of pre -specified targets 
for:   
a. Recruiting and enrolling individuals with chronic BRLP by [CONTACT_839806] (screens/month; % women and minorities); enrollment rates 
(participants/month; % women and minorities); and screened participants’ views 
and perspectives (identification of barriers and facilitat ors for research 
participation)  
 
b. Delivering experimental and comparison interventions  by [CONTACT_839807] (% never receiving treatment; % receiving prohibited treatments 
during intervention phase); % attending required sessions; % participating in home 
practice and taking medications as directed; % satisfied with treat ment); provider 
intervention fidelity rates (% of required activities delivered) and participant and 
provider views (barriers and facilitators to engaging in/providing interventions; 
views regarding affor dability, practicality, effectiveness, acceptability, and equity)  
 
c. Data collection by [CONTACT_839808] (% of complete assessments at 12 weeks and six months, in addition to 
% of completed weekly pain surveys)  
 
[ADDRESS_1167207], with additional emphasis on engaging individuals often 
underrepresented in CIH back pain research.  
 
1. To develop procedures and processes that transparently define how researchers 
and community members will work together on the proposed research.  
APPROAC H: Based on the literature, preliminary work and collaboration with a 
Community Advisory Team, we will develop clearly articulated manuals of operations, 
including a collaborative team charter that describes how researchers, the Community 
Advisory Team, and community members will work together on the parent trial and 
beyond . 
 
2. To explore and describe the barriers and facilitators underrepresented populations 
encounter in relation to participating in CIH back pain research.  
APPROACH:  We will collect qualitative data from a n additional  sample of community 
members (n= 20-30) from traditionally underrepresented groups and use deductive 
analyses using est ablished models and frameworks.  
 
3. To develop community -informed study procedures and materials and assess 
community members’ and participants’ views of them.  
APPROACH: We will use an iterative design, development, implementation, and 
evaluation process successfully used by [CONTACT_2296], to create recruitment, screening, 
enrollment, intervention, monitoring, and dissemination processes and materials that are 
culturally sensiti ve and meet diverse participant needs in relation to engaging in CIH pain 
research.  
 
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1. Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
The [LOCATION_002] is in the midst of an unprecedented chronic pain crisis. Low back pain 
(LBP) is the most common and disabling chronic pain condition and affects 40 to 80% of 
adults at some point in their lives.1,2 
 
Back related leg pain (BRLP)  is one of the most burdensome and complex variations of 
the very prevalent and costly LBP conditions. It can be defined by a constellation of 
symptoms characterized by [CONTACT_839809][INVESTIGATOR_839717].20,22 Clinically, 
BRLP is classified in two ways: without  nerve root involvement (the majority of cases) 
which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_839718] a liga ment, joint, disc, or 
16 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  muscle;4,20,22,23 and with nerve root involvement (the most severe cases), often with a 
suspected pathoanatomic cause (e.g. spondylolisthesis, disc herniation, stenosis, 
etc.).4,22,[ADDRESS_1167208] relationship between pathoanatomical findings and 
BRLP can rarely be established with certainty, as pathoanatomic findings are very 
common in asymptomatic individuals.25 Further, like other chronic pain conditions, central 
sensitization likely plays a key role in BRLP as well.26,27 
 
BRLP affects 30 to 60% of those with LBP,4,[ADDRESS_1167209] on BRLP 
outcomes.8-10 Drawing from the larger pain field, poor quality relationships and social 
stressors (e.g. due to isolation, ostracism, injustice, invalidation, etc.) can play a role in 
impeding adaptive pain behaviors.38,[ADDRESS_1167210] limited scientific backing, and often fail to meet patient Table 1. Medical Treatments for BRLP

*Reserved for severe cases of BRLP unresponsive to conservative therapy and when 
neurologic signs and pain distribution are accompanied by [CONTACT_839810][INVESTIGATOR_16078], spi[INVESTIGATOR_839720]34-[ADDRESS_1167212] of these interventions are 
associated with significant risks including gastrointestinal complications with NSAIDs; 
hyperglycemia and infection with corticosteroids;  addiction, abuse, and overdose with 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199721]; hematoma, b leeding, and dural puncture with spi[INVESTIGATOR_839721]; and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired infection, sepsis, or other serious complications with 
surgery.11,13,42,43  
 
Conservative and Complementary Care Treatments for BRLP  
There has been very little research investigating conservative and complementary 
treatments for BRLP (see Table 2). Physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PTs) and chiropractors (DCs) are 
the most common 
providers of 
conservative and 
complementary 
treatments for BRLP 
in the U.S. 
Approximately 64% 
of patients seek 
care from physical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PT) and 
32% from doctors of 
chiropractic (DC) for 
BRLP16 to help manage symptoms and restore movement and functional ability. 
Historically, treatments by [CONTACT_839811], and include a mix of passive and active treatments (e.g. ergonomic advice, 
exercise, and manual treatments, like spi[INVESTIGATOR_839722]).46 A 
recent systematic review of non -invasive treatments for LBP conditions reported limited 
evidence to support the use of exercise and spi[INVESTIGATOR_839723],31 which was 
partially informed by a trial performed by [CONTACT_839812].20 Serious risks with these treatments are very rare and common side ef fects are 
usually self -limiting (e.g. soreness and increased pain).31 
 
Self-Management Behaviors and BRLP: Challenges and Solutions  
An important and relatively recent observation has been that chronic pain, including 
BRLP, is much like other chronic health conditions and requires ongoing 
management.47,48 Rather than rely on passive and provider -based therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839724]-term, a preferred solution is to engage pain sufferers in healthy self -management 
behaviors to successfully address pain themselves.40,48 While patients recognize the 
need to take responsibility for their care, they often require assistance from health care 
providers  to initiate and maintain self -management successfully.49,50 Self-management, 
like any human behavior, is complex and requires attentiveness to the patient’s 
biopsychosocial needs and risk factors. This includes assessing patients’ capabilities 
(e.g. Do they have the knowledge, skills, and physical capacity?), oppo rtunities (e.g. Do Table 2. Conservative & Complementary Treatments for BRLP  
Treatment  Evidence of effectiveness  
Exercise  Weak evidence for small improvements in pain and function compared 
to usual care or sham exercise30 
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_839725]; unclear evidence compared to other active 
treatment30,[ADDRESS_1167213] the resources?), and motivations (e.g. Do they have the beliefs and 
optimism?),51-[ADDRESS_1167214] provided theoretical and evidence -based 
framew orks and models that can be used to guide the process.47,51,54  One such model is 
the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) which represents a synthesis of 19 behavioral 
theoretical frameworks (and thus is more comprehensive in addressing the complexity of 
human beh avior versus a single theory driven model). We have used the BCW along with 
the biopsychosocial model, to develop our conceptual framework and model for the SSM 
intervention (see Figure 2). This has guided choices regarding: the modifiable factors that 
should be targeted (e.g self -efficacy beliefs, self -management skills, etc.); the evidence -
informed modalities to include (e.g. physical exercises, cognitive strategies, etc.); the 
most appropriate intervention elements for delivering (e.g. education, trainin g, etc.); and 
the most salient behavioral change techniques (e.g. instructions and demonstrations, 
practice and rehearsal, etc.).55,56 
 
Biopsychosocial Interventions for LBP and BRLP  
Treating pain as a primarily physical phenomenon is inadequate.40,48 While the 
biopsychosocial (BPS) model has been promoted for the past several decades,57,[ADDRESS_1167215] been attempts to apply the 
BPS model to pain management,57,59 there are still many gaps, particularly for BRLP.  
 
Multidisciplinary approaches: Team based approaches with multiple providers from 
complementary disciplines has been one way of integrating different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839726]’ BPS needs.40,[ADDRESS_1167216] significant 
challenges including patient inconvenience (multiple appointments with different 
providers), and the substantial system resources needed to coordinate care across 
provider types, which often re sults in disjointed and unsatisfactory care.40 Further, the 
research evidence suggests that the benefi ts of multi -disciplinary interventions may not 
outweigh the costs. A systematic review of 41 trials examining multi -disciplinary 
biopsychosocial rehabilitation (MBR) programs for chronic LBP59 found an advantage 
compared to usual care or physical treatments for reducing pain and disability and 
increasing the likelihood of return to work. The authors cautioned that the modest 
benefits, may not outweigh resources and costs required to deliver car e, and suggested 
MBR be reserved for the most severe cases. Sinc e that review we identified 6 additional 
trials which generally confirm these findings.60-65 
 
Mono -disciplinary approaches: There are pragmatic advantages to having the 
biopsychosocial elements of care delivered by a single practitioner, including improved 
accessibility, harmonized care, decreased patient burden, and potentially lower costs.66 
Physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PTs) and chiropractors (DCs) are the most common providers of 
non-pharmacologic treatment for back pain conditions in the U.S.17 This makes them 
optimally positioned for delivering integrated psychosocial strategies to complement 
19 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  biological/physical approaches,46,[ADDRESS_1167217] of the evidence to date regarding mono -disciplinary care for biopsychosocial (BPS) 
pain management, focuses on PT care for LBP. Two recent systematic reviews have 
assessed the effectiveness of PT -led BPS interventions compared to education/advice or 
physical focused care (e.g. exercise, manual treatment).70,71 Both reviews concluded that 
PT-led BPS interventions were superior to education/advice. The reviews reached 
different conclusions regarding effects compared to physical oriented treatment, with one 
review reporting similar outcomes71 and the other reporting a small advantage for BPS 
interventions.[ADDRESS_1167218] reported either similar effects72-74 or an 
advantage for biopsychosocial interventions.75,76  
 
Of note are two of the larger trials assessing PT -led biopsychosocial interventions, which 
included large subgroups of BRLP patients and reported more improvement in pain and 
physical  function compared to education77,78 and usual PT care.76 While these findings 
are promising, it is not possible to draw firm conclusions regarding the effectiveness of 
PT-led BPS interventions for BRLP from these two studies. The effectiveness of DC -led 
BPS interventions also remains unknown.  
 
Low back pain (LBP) and health inequity.  While there have been increased calls to 
improve the study of LBP  by [CONTACT_2329] a more whole person or holistic biopsychosocial 
approach, change has been slow and investigation of social aspects has been especially 
under -addressed. In particular, broader knowl edge about the social conditions that 
contribute to health inequity related to LBP, are relatively sparse.[ADDRESS_1167219] evidence for associations are between educati on 
and multidimensional aspects of socioeconomic status (e.g. income, employment status, 
home ownership).[ADDRESS_1167220] prevalent.161 While Black Americans 
are less likely to be prescribed opi[INVESTIGATOR_839727] (an advantage in this ca se),162,163 
they are also more likely to be under -assessed and under -treated in many areas including 
screening, diagnostic imaging, use of physical therapy, and surgery.164  
 
20 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  Health equity can be viewed as social justice in health and is related to the bioethical 
principle of justice; it is achieved when health inequities are eliminated creating equitable 
opportunities to attain optimal health regardless of social position or s ocially -determined 
circumstances.165 For research in Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) for LBP, 
health equity will mean gaining a better understanding about the barriers and facilitators 
underrepresented groups encounter and the actionable steps t hat can be taken to 
address them.  
 
Importantly, it is essential that the full range of biopsychosocial factors be considered. 
Indeed, understanding and assessing contextual multilevel determinants of health which 
contribute to health inequity is critical yet underdeveloped across all health  fields.165,166 
There is a great need to better understand the dynamic interactions between proximal 
and distal social contexts (e.g. family, work, community, culture, sociopolitical) that affect 
underrepresented populations participation in LBP and CIH re search.   
 
Research and health inequity. While efforts have been made to address inequity in 
health research, there is still much to be done. Inclusion of minorities in NIH -funded 
clinical trials has increased over the past 25 years (from 2.8% to 11.1%), but minorities 
are still widely underrepre sented. Non -Hispanic white Americans represent 60.7% of US 
population, but account for nearly 90% of clinical trial populations.[ADDRESS_1167221] been 2 to 3.5 times lower relative to census estimates.168 
Enrollment of minorities in rheumatoid arthritis trials is also significantly lower than their 
representation within the population (16% vs 40%).[ADDRESS_1167222] in regards to CIH use in the American population, with lower use 
among Hispanics (22%) and non -Hispanic Blacks (19.3%) relative to non -Hispanic whites 
(37.9%). Use of CIH is also lower for the less educated (15.6% in adults w/o high school 
degree compared to 42.6% in adults with college degree) and the poor (20.6% of poor 
report CIH use compared to 38.4% of non -poor.)170  
 
Systematic efforts to assess participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in CIH 
studies is also lacking.  In the PI’s own K01 CIH pain focused research (publication in 
preparation), participation rates of racial and ethnic groups and those with l ower income 
and education fall well short of representing national estimates of pain sufferers (see 
Preliminary Studies). Thus, we can surmise that overall, the CIH research for spi[INVESTIGATOR_839728] a limited segme nt of the population, 
which has important bioethical and translational implications for the field.   
 
Overcoming health inequity in CIH pain research . Enhancing stakeholder 
engagement has emerged as an important priority for increasing participation of 
underrepresented populations in research. Community based participatory research and 
community engaged research practices have become increasingly popul ar in many health 
fields171,[ADDRESS_1167223] also be paid to the specific challenges related to the 
condition and interventions under study.176  
 
Limitations & Gaps in Research of Biopsychosocial Self -Management 
Interventions  
Evidence to support mono -disciplinary BPS interventions for BRLP is encouraging. 
However, existing studies have significant limitations, leaving critical gaps in our scientific 
understanding.  
 
● Greater attention needs to be paid to intervention design so it aligns with BRLP -
specific risk factors, patient needs, and desired outcomes to fully realize the potential 
of BPS interventions for active self-management (an important goal for overcoming 
rising costs and disability).51 This includes approaching self -management as a set of 
behaviors, and intentionally choosing evidence and theory informed strategies that 
map to relevant behavioral outcomes, rather than clinical outcomes alone (e.g. pain 
and disability).  
● Methodologically rigorous research of conservative and complementary approaches 
for BRLP is lacking. Further, the existing literature on BPS and self -management 
interventions is very heterogenous, with a wide range of goals, rationale, content, 
training, frequency, intensity, mode of delivery, and attention to intervention fidelity, all 
which could have a substantial impact on study related outcomes. While better 
designed BPS studies t argeting self -management for LBP are emerging,54,79 none to  
our knowledge address the more complicated and burdensome BRLP conditions.   
● Engaging communities in CIH research for chronic pain is inherently complex and 
is more likely to succeed when grounded in established models and frameworks 
to guide the work. The proposed supplemental research brings together models 
used in the parent pil ot study to systematically study back -related leg pain for 
improving pain self -management behaviors with features from the ConNECT 
Framework to address health equity. We will focus on augmenting the parent study 
by [CONTACT_839813]:  
o Paying greater consideration to social contexts (e.g. the situational and 
interactive influences on health). For CIH and LBP this includes socioecological 
determinants, as well as biological/physical and psychological influences.  
o Fostering a norm of inclusion (e.g. consistently engaging diverse groups). This 
means systematically and consistently using community -based research 
strategies to intentionally reach underrepresented groups in CIH pain research, 
monitor progress, and makin g these efforts the norm, not the exception.  
o Doing more, earlier to ensure long -term equitable diffusion of study innovations 
to facilitate real world benefit for all. For CIH and LBP conditions this means 
bridging the gap between research and practice, which to date, has been a 
challenge. While the parent study addresses this in part by [CONTACT_839814] (who will be tasked with administering the CIH interventions 
should they prove effective), the administrative supplement proposes to extend 
22 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  stakeholder engagement to include community members’ from traditionally 
underrepresented populations in CIH 
and LBP research.  
 
2.2. Preliminary Studies   
Collectively, this investigative team has 
substantial experience conducting comparative 
effectiveness studies of conservative, 
complementary, and conventional approaches for 
LBP conditions.20,21,81 -91  
A Mixed Methods Study of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_839729] -drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839730], which 
was published in Annals of Internal Medicine.20 The study included BRLP participants 
with and without neurological signs (20% had neurological signs), but excluded 
individuals with potential indications for surgery (e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078], spi[INVESTIGATOR_158282], 
progressive neurological deficits). Spi[INVESTIGATOR_839731] (SMT) targ eted mobility 
and symptom relief, and was delivered by [CONTACT_608879] (up to 20 sessions). Home 
exercise (HE) was delivered over 4, 60 -minute sessions and focused on teaching patients 
exercises and postural strategies. Clinical outcomes (Table 3): SMT & HE resulted in 
significantly greater reduction in leg pain, at [ADDRESS_1167224] secondary outcomes, including medication use. Expected adverse 
events (e.g. increased pain severity) were mild to moderate, self-limiting, and reported 
less frequently in the SMT & HE group. Qualitative outcomes: The quality of patient -
provider interactions was the most frequently cited theme informing satisfaction.21 
Limitations: It remains unknown how these interventions compare to common types of 
medical care. Also, the primary focus of both interventions was on the physical aspects 
of BRLP and did not purposefully address psychological and social factors. This is 
reflected by [CONTACT_839815] ( e.g. SF -36 mental health 
domain) compared to those that are ‘physically oriented’ (e.g. pain, disability).  
This study demonstrated DCs could successfully and safely evaluate and treat patients 
with chronic BRLP. The findings are encouraging in light of the current, very limited BRLP 
treatment literature, and suggests a need to compare similar non -medical interv entions 
to conventional medical care. Further, in recognizing the complex nature of BRLP, there 
is an opportunity to better train DCs and PTs to capi[INVESTIGATOR_839732] -provider interactions 
and intentionally use behavior change techniques to integrate evide nce based 
psychosocial treatments with physically oriented modalities (SMT, HE).

SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  (n=1180, UH3). Drs. Greco and Evans (Co -Is), designed and developed a DC and PT 
delivered supported self -management (SSM) intervention (adapted from a Pain Copi[INVESTIGATOR_839734]).66,92,93 SSM was developed in collaboration with a multi -disciplinary group 
of researchers including DCs, PTs, and psychologists and consists of 4 -8, 60 -minute 
sessions, targeting the modifiable physical and psychological risk factors associated with 
acute LBP. In tervention elements include physical and postural exercises, integrat ed with 
cognitive strategies (e.g. relaxed breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, mental 
imagery), delivered with and without SMT. PTs and DCs are trained to use patient -
centered communication and whole person assessment tools to tailor care to meet pat ient 
needs.  
Select Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] & Feasibility Outcomes : A total of 5 DCs and 4 PTs were trained by [CONTACT_6283]. 
Greco and Evans (~20 hours). Prior to training, qualitative data suggested providers 
lacked the tools and training to support patients’ psychosocial needs; they also expressed 
feeling limited in their abili ty to motivate patients in self -care. Provider confidence in the 
SSM program improved from pre -training to post -training. Patient adherence to the SSM 
intervention was high with 41/46 individuals (89%) attending required sessions. Follow up 
rates were also high (94% for weekly pain severity, 98% for monthly surveys of disability 
and other outcomes). These findings, along with suggestions from providers, were used 
to refine the SSM intervention and supporting materials for the ongoing PACBACK trial.  
The investigators’ current and previous research20 has led to this R34 pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], which 
will address an important group of patients with chronic  BRLP, who are currently ineligible 
to participate in the PACBACK trial (BRLP is not the condition of interest, and the focus 
is on acute LBP  of <12 weeks duration). We will leverage recruitment from PACBACK to 
enroll patients in the R34. Similarities in study design will facilitate protocol development, 
increasing this R34’s efficiency, and likelihood of meeting feasibility targets (Table 5). The 
R34 will provide the opportunity to collaborate with a Clinical Advisory Team to refine and 
implement a new SS M intervention specific to BRLP, and to sufficiently train DCs and 
PTs in the additional psychosocial elements and behavior change techniques required to 
meet the more complicated needs of chronic  BRLP patients.[ADDRESS_1167225] disabling and costly of the LBP conditions. In light of 
increasing calls for safe and effective treatments that diminish unhealthy pain 
manage ment behaviors (e.g. inactivity, overuse of medications including opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]), the 
timing is imminent for PTs and DCs to play a larger role in initiating and guiding patients’ 
self-management using evidence -based behavioral strategies that educate, motivate, 
and support patients from a biopsychosocial perspective .  
 
In response to the current evidence gaps and limitations in the existing research, we 
propose a pi[INVESTIGATOR_839735], 
enrollment, intervention acceptability and credibility, participant adherence,  provider 
fidelity, and data collection in preparation for a multi -site randomized clinical study. The 
Integrated SUPPORT ed Biopsychosocial Self -Management for Back Related Leg Pain  
24 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  (SUPPORT) trial will assess the comparative effectiveness of a novel supported self -
management (SSM) intervention delivered by [CONTACT_839816], to Medical Care (MC).  
 
This research addresses NCCIH high priority areas of integrated mind body approaches 
for symptom management of BRLP, one of the most disabling, costly, and understudied 
LBP conditions , with enhanced efforts for engaging under -represented populations . The 
R34 pi[INVESTIGATOR_839736]. In doing so, DCs and PTs can 
play a more impactful role guiding BRLP patients’ healthy pain self -management 
behavior s, resulting in less BRLP disability, and better overall health and wellbeing.  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
3.1. Rationale for Study Design  
While this team has previously investigated conservative interventions for chronic BRLP, 
the focus has been on primarily biological/physical interventions. Given the complex web 
of interrelated physical, psychological, and social factors contributing to ch ronic BRLP, 
we have developed a comprehensive evidence and theory informed supported self -
management (SSM) intervention. Further, comparisons to medical care (MC) are much 
needed. Thus, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_839737] a solid foundation for  future 
research efforts, including a multi -site, phase II hybrid effectiveness - implementation 
randomized clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of 12 weeks of PT or DC delivered 
SSM compared to MC for chronic BRLP in terms of behavioral and clinical  outcomes (see 
section 6).  
 
For AIM 1, we will focus on critical Planning Phase activities based on the team’s previous 
experience.20,81 -88 This will include:  
● Preparation of detailed protocols, procedures and materials, as well as securing 
necessary regulatory approvals and training study personnel.  
● Also, we will work with a clinician advisory panel of PTs and DCs to further refine the 
SSM intervention and clinician training strategy.  
 
For AIM 2, we will conduct a randomized mixed methods pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (n=40 -50) using 
qualitative and quantitative data to assess the feasibility of recruitment, enrollment, 
intervention acceptability and credibility, participant adherence, provider fidelity, and data 
collection activities for the future multi -site, phase II randomi zed clinical trial. Table 5 
details feasibility targets and Table 6 describes protocol refinement measures. Figure 1 
provides an overview of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Section 6 provides addit ional information about 
evaluations and outcomes.  
Participant involvement will occur from the point of their initial online screening (which is 
followed by [CONTACT_28920] -person clinical screen) to the last follow up data collection endpoint (6 
months after randomization/enrollment). The total time for subject inv olvement is 
approximately 7 months.  
25 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022   
3.2. Rationale for Supplemental Aims  
The nature of the future hybrid effectiveness/implementation RCT design requires 
participation of multiple levels of stakeholders in addition to those taking part in the 
randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Through their participation, important partnerships will be fo rmed, 
and critical contextual information will be gathered which will inform the optimization of 
the future RCT, and adapt the experimental intervention (SBSM) so that it is suitable for 
implementation over the long term.   
For Supplemental AIM 1, we will assemble a Community Advisory Team (CAT) to develop 
a clearly articulated CAT manual of operations that includes a collaborative team charter 
that describes how researchers, the CAT, and community members will work together on 
the parent pi[INVESTIGATOR_839738].  
For Supplemental AIM 2, we will collect additional qualitative data from a sample of 
individuals (n=20 -30) from traditionally underrepresented groups. This is an extension of 
the mixed methods pi[INVESTIGATOR_839739] -site, phase II 
randomized clinical trial with an emphasis on exploring intervention acceptability and 
credibility.  
For Supplemental AIM 3, we will use information from Supplemental Aim 2, in consultation 
with the Community Advisory Team assembled as part of Supplemental Aim 1, to engage 
in an iterative design, development, implementation, and evaluation process success fully 
used by [CONTACT_2296], to create recruitment, screening, enrollment, intervention, monitoring, 
and dissemination processes and materials for the future full -scale trial, that are culturally 
sensitive and meet diverse participant needs in relation to engag ing in CIH pain research.  
 

26 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  3.2. Sampling, Target Population, & Location  
The University of Minnesota (UMN) will serve as the clinical site for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_839740]. Participants will be 
offered the option to attend videoconference appointments for visits where in -person 
activities aren’t necessary. Persons who are unable to use Zoom will be seen in -person, 
and thus will not be excluded if they do not have the means to  participate remotely.  Zoom 
is a University of Minnesota supported HIPAA compliant app that all ows videotelephony 
and online chat services through a cloud -based peer -to-peer software platform. This 
application has been used extensively in research by [CONTACT_251822] ( UH3AT008769 , 
R33AT009110).  
 
This pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (including the supplemental aims) is in anticipation of a larger scale clinical 
trial that will be performed at clinical research centers affiliated with the UMN in 
Minneapolis, MN and the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_839741], PA. The study will draw 
from the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropo litan area which has a total population of 3.03 
million, 25% of which are non -white.94 See Section 4 and the Study Accrual and Retention 
Plan (SARP) for additional information related to recruitment and en rollment of 
participants.

event that in -person activities are not possible due to the Covid -19 pandemic, trial 
procedures will be modified to ensure all visits can be conducted remotely. Our team has 
designed and implemented remote screening protocols (including assessm ent of 
neurological deficits associated with BRLP) for our ongoing NCCIH PACBACK trial. The 
SMT component of the SSM experimental intervention will be paused until in person visits 
can safely resume.  
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.1. Inclusion Criteria            
Participants must meet the following inclusion criteria to participate  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] : 
● Back -related leg pain (BRLP) consistent with the Quebec Task Force (QTF) 
classifications 2 -4 (radiating pain into proximal or distal extremity with or without 
neurological signs).22,95 
● 18 years of age or older .  
27 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  ● Back -related leg pain severity of 3 or higher at all screening assessments (0 to 10 
scale)  
● Epi[INVESTIGATOR_353948] 12 weeks or more  
● Ability to read English fluently   
 
4.2. Exclusion Criteria            
Participants meeting any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will not be allowed 
to participate  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] :  
● Spi[INVESTIGATOR_16078] (QTF 7)  
● Specific, non -mechanical causes of BRLP (QTF 11; e.g. infection, tumor)  
● Contraindications to study interventions (e.g. spi[INVESTIGATOR_131726] (QTF 5))  
● Inflammatory conditions of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (QTF 11)  
● Lumbar fusion  
● Progressive neurological deficits  
● Cauda equina syndrome  
● Pregnancy, nursing  
● Ongoing care from another healthcare provider for BRLP  
○ Individuals taking prescribed medications for BRLP with the potential for 
withdrawal symptoms (e.g. opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], antidepressants, corticosteroids) will be 
referred to their provider to ensure prescription medications are safely tapered  
● Severe unmanaged comorbid conditions (e.g. substance abuse, major depressive 
disorder, stage 3 hypertension).  
Also, as part of the supplemental aims to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], qualitative interviews will be 
performed with additional stakeholders to provide important contextual information 
required as part of the hybrid effectiveness/implementation design. These stakeholders 
are intended to provide perspectives from individuals with LBP who are often 
underrepresented in CIH LBP research.  Inclusion criteria will be 18 years of age and 
older, with an epi[INVESTIGATOR_651624] (with our without leg pain) and at least one of the following: 
non-white race; low health services access; lack of health insurance coverage; lower 
income; higher food insecurity; gender identity of LGBTQ+; an d willingness to participate 
in qualitative data collection.  
4.3. Study Enrollment Procedures            
Recruitment of Participants  
Participants are recruited to participate in this study using the following strategies:  
● Leveraging ongoing recruitment efforts of an NIH funded multi -year study 
(UH3AT008769) of acute and subacute LBP led by [CONTACT_15957] -PI [INVESTIGATOR_839742], and Co -I 
Schneider, which routinely excludes  chronic BRLP sufferers during screening 
(approximately 150 per month).  
● Using resources offered through the UMN Clinical and Translational Science Institute 
(CTSI, NIH UL1TR000114). This includes StudyFinder, which extracts data from UMN 
28 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  affiliated enrolling studies listed on ClinicalTrials.gov; and ResearchMatch, an 
electronic volunteer recruitment registry that also provides information about UMN 
studies.  
● Advertising through University affiliated newsletters, websites, Facebook and other 
social media, and clinics (e.g., Clinics and Surgery Center). Posters will also be 
distributed publicly throughout the UMN campus and surrounding communities.  
● Reaching under -represented populations through collaboration with the UMN Urban 
Research and Outreach -Engagement Center and the CTSI’s Community 
Engagement Studio. (e.g. through presentations, mentions in organizational 
newsletters, etc.).  
● The SARP details additional plans to recruit participants underrepresented in research 
(e.g. race, ethnicity, age, education, income, ability, gender and sexual orientation).  
● As part of supplemental aim 1, we will work with a Community Advisory Team (CAT) 
comprised of 6 -10 community leaders from organizations including the YMCA of the 
North’s Equity Innovation Center, Social Responsibility Team and ForeverWell 
Outreach Team; th e University of Minnesota’s Office of Public Engagement and the 
Robert J. Jones Urban Research and Outreach Engagement Center (UROC) and 
others. The Community Advisory Team will meet quarterly to connect researchers to 
community members; educate and coach researchers in historical issues related to 
health disparities, cultural agility and competence; review engagement reports; and 
make recommendations for prioritization of engagement strategies based on 
community member input.  
 
Participants' private medical and/or employment records will not be accessed for 
recruitment purposes. Participant’s electronic medical records (e.g., EPIC records) will 
not be accessed by [CONTACT_3647].  
 
Documentation of reasons for ineligibility and for non -participation of eligible candidates  
A comprehensive list of all candidates who were screened, whether or not they were 
enrolled, and the reasons for ineligibility or non -participation (if applicable) will be 
maintained electronically. A summary of the number of candidates screened and enroll ed 
with reasons for ineligibility or non -participation will be monitored by [CONTACT_839817].  
 
Consent Procedures  
A full description of the consent process is described in section 6, Study Procedures. All 
participants will provide written or electronic consent prior to enrollment.  
 
Randomization/Enrollment  
Enrolled subjects will be randomized using blocked randomization (with varying block 
sizes) following stratification for back -related leg pain classification (QTF classification 2, 
3, or 4).95 Computer generated random treatment assignments will be generated by [CONTACT_839818] (the 
electronic study database) at the time of enrollment to preserve allocation concealment. 
Screening clini cians and study staff will be blinded to upcoming treatment assignments.

Participating clinicians 
will be trained and certified in study protocols and intervention specific content (see below 
for additional details).  
The main intervention period is 12 weeks long. All patients will be asked to limit treatment 
to their assigned intervention for the main 12 -week intervention period. Participants in 
both groups will be monitored during the intervention phase for the develo pment of 
exclusion criteria impacting participant safety which will result in withdrawal from the study 
intervention along with a referral for appropriate care (e.g. development of progressive 
neurological deficits). All patients will receive basic standar dized information regarding 
the etiology, prognosis, and basic self -management of back -related leg pain.  
Patients in both groups can take over -the-counter medications, for any reason, as 
necessary during the entire trial period. Participants may also continue to engage in any 
self-management practices for BRLP that were used prior to trial enrollment (e.g. 
exercises, heat application). Following the main 12 -week intervention period, participants 
who experience a recurrence or worsening of back -related leg pain symptoms will be 
given the option to receive further care in their assigned treatment arm, as is typi [INVESTIGATOR_839743]-world settings. Additional care for back -related leg pain recurrences may occur until 
week 26. Intervention documentation will include data regarding training and resources 
required to deliver the interventions. Visit specific information inclu ding type or component 
of treatment, frequency and dose, side effects, etc. will also be measured. These are 
documented in standardized case report forms.  
 
5.1. Interventions, Administration and Duration            
5.1.1.  Supported Self -Management (SSM) - Experimental Intervention  
Rationale, theory, goals : The program is theory -informed and adapted from previous 
cognitive behavioral and self -management programs.20,66,92,93 The primary goal is to 
enhance patients’ ability to manage their BRLP symptoms in both the short and long -term 
by [CONTACT_839819], psychological, and social self -management behaviors 
(see Figure 2).40,51 Table 4. Common Intervention Elements (Experimental & Comparison Groups)  
Initial intervention period  12 weeks; # of visits determined collaboratively by 
[CONTACT_839820] (once minimum is reached)  
Restrictions  No outside care during main 12 -week intervention 
period  
Ongoing care  If recurrence or worsening of BRLP after 12 weeks, 
can receive care in assigned group  
Procedures  Appointment reminders, follow up for missed 
appointments provided  
Standardized information  Modified “Back in Action” book covering evidence 
based BRLP messages  
Over the counter medication  As necessary  
Location  UMN affiliated outpatient clinic in Minneapolis

SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022   
Description : The intervention is comprised of an integration of the following core 
intervention elements and 12 -15 behavioral change techniques (BCTs)55,56 targeting 
important modifiable biopsychosocial factors for BRLP and which can be successfully 
delivered by [CONTACT_839821]. These include:  
 
● Physical factors of strength, activity, mobility, posture, and pain symptoms;8,101 
● Psychological factors including beliefs (self -efficacy, fear -avoidance, catastrophizing), 
thoughts, emotions, and stress;8-10,41 and  
● Social factors including social support and interpersonal relationships.  
 
Providers will use standardized checklists for each session, to ensure they address the 
required elements (see 5.2.1 below).  
 
Dose/Schedule : 6-12 sessions, up to 60 minutes per session, over 12 weeks.  
 
Mode of delivery:  One to one, in person or via videoconference when applicable; 
supplemented with the use of phone, videoconference, and/or email check -ins.  
  
Location:  UMN outpatient research facility or via videoconference when applicable  
 
Tailoring and individualization:  At the first session, the PT or DC will work with the patient 
to assess their needs and collaboratively develop an individualized treatment plan. This 
will include review of BPS baseline measures (see Table 5); a brief physical examination 
that includes m anual palpation and brief postural, strength, and mobility assessments; 
completion of a Wellbeing Wheel (based on risk factors and the BPS model) and self -
evaluation of what it would take to engage in adaptive pain behaviors  (COM -B Self -
Evaluation Questionnaire V1).55 These will be re -assessed as needed. In addition, a “Self -
Reliance Check In” will be completed at 6 weeks to initiate a conversation regarding 
release to self -care.  
Side Effects/Risks: The risks associated with SSM are considered low for subjects who 
meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria; to further minimize risks licensed doctors of 
chiropractic (DC) and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PT) will be trained and certified by [CONTACT_431], 
and monito red for fidelity to ensure they are implementing SSM in a manner that optimizes 
patient safety. Experienced investigators and consultants will be readily available as 
needed to consult with DCs and PTs to clinically manage adverse event s as needed. The 
core elements of SSM include physical and psychosocial strategies.  
Physical:  Side effects associated with manual treatment and exercise are common and 
benign. Approximately 35% of participants in our previous BRLP trial reported expected 
self-limiting adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity (e.g. increased pain, 
soreness).[ADDRESS_1167228].31, 146  
Psychosocial. Subjects may experience some short -lasting emotional discomfort during 
and outside the sessions when practicing the psychosocial exercises and strategies 
31 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  (e.g. of relaxed breathing, guided imagery, pacing, relaxation, pacing, problem solving, 
cognitive restructuring, interpersonal communication, etc.).  
 
Providers:  Licensed PTs and DCs with a minimum of 3 years of clinical experience will 
be provided an estimated 30 hours of training.  
 
Training:  The goal of SSM training is to facilitate providers’ confidence and ability to act 
as an effective coach for patients’ in their self -management. We will use methods 
effectively implemented in the investigators’ previous and ongoing studies including video  
presentations, demonstrations, and simulated patient practice with feedback from 
investigators responsible for the SSM intervention (CG, RE).  
Training content will include the essential information related to the core intervention 
elements and BCTs, and will emphasize patient -centered communication as a key part 
of delivery.15 Clinicians will be assessed for key competencies prior to certification. 
Competencies will be adapted from ongoing and previous studies with input from The 
Clinician Advisory Panel comprised of PTs and DCs during the Aim 1  Planning Phase.  
 
5.1.2.  Medical Care (MC) - Comparison Intervention  
Rationale, theory, goals: The goal of medical care management for BRLP is to reduce 
pain and disability associated with the condition. This is achieved through the use of 
medications targeting pain and inflammation. Medical care is a commonly used standard 
approach for managing BRL P in the U.S., and thus is appropriate as an active comparison 
group.  
 
Description: Medical care will be comprised of primarily medication management, which 
is a standard first -line approach for back -related leg pain in primary care. Choice of 
medications is informed by [CONTACT_839822] 12,104 and the American College of 
Physicians guidelines on noninvasive treatment for LBP.11  
 

32 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  ● Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will be used as a first -line approach.  
● Second -line medications include systemic corticosteroids, skeletal muscle relaxants, 
acetaminophen, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], antiseizure medications, lidocaine patches, 
serotonin and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608], tricyclic antidepressants and weak 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (e.g. Tramadol, Tylenol with Codeine) for participants unable to tolerate or 
unresponsive to first -line medications.  
● Strong opi[INVESTIGATOR_839744], as the current 
CDC recommendations prefer non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_839745] a 
lack of evidence regarding their use for BRLP.12,105 
 
Medication Choice:  Decisions regarding medication selection will be made collaboratively 
between the provider and patient after a discussion of the potential risks, benefits, past 
experience, and preferences for different medications.  
 
Schedule:  Minimum of 2 visits (up to 30 minutes in length) to review clinical presentation, 
risk/benefit profile and participant preference for first and second -line medications, and 
response to previous care.  
 
Visit type:  The initial visit will be in -person or via videoconference; additional visits will 
occur in person, by [CONTACT_217334], or by [CONTACT_648].  
Medication Delivery:  Medications will be taken orally or applied topi[INVESTIGATOR_839746]. 
Injections will not be allowed. Medications will not be stored at or distributed to participants 
in the UMN clinic. Prescriptions for medications from the study provider will be sent to th e 
patient’s preferred pharmacy. Participants will pi[INVESTIGATOR_839747]. Over the counter (OTC) medications will be pi[INVESTIGATOR_839748].  
All medications are paid for by [CONTACT_1758]. Participants are not required to use their medical 
insurance benefits to participate, and there are no out of pocket costs for the participants.   
 
Location:  UMN outpatient research facility or videoconference  
 
Visit Frequency:  Decided collaboratively by [CONTACT_839823], as normally 
occurs in clinical practice.  
Side-Effects:  Pharmacological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839749].7  
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs) will be used as a first -line medication. 
Serious risks include cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, heart failure, high blood 
pressure), gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reaction (hives, skin irritation, respi[INVESTIGATOR_4783], edema), k idney failure, skin reactions, liver failure, and asthma attacks.  Other 
side effects include stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, gas, heartburn, nausea, 
vomiting and dizziness.  
33 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  Second -line medications include systemic corticosteroids, skeletal muscle relaxants, 
acetaminophen, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], antiseizure medications, lidocaine patches, serotonin 
and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608], and tricyclic antidepressants for participants 
unable to tolerate or unrespon sive to NSAIDs. Serious risks with these medications 
include allergic reaction, seizures, infection, hyperglycemia, bone fracture, liver or kidney 
damage, and addiction or abuse. Other risks include sedation, drowsiness, fatigue, sleep 
problems, headache, weight gain, muscle weakness, mental/physical impairment, dry 
mouth, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, occult bleeding, dizziness, 
vertigo, tremor, syncope, and leukopenia.  
Several protections are in place to minimize risks, including reminding participants to take 
their medication as prescribed and to contact [CONTACT_839824] -drug adverse interactions. Partic ipants will be 
asked about current medications at every treatment visit to assess potential drug -drug 
adverse interactions. Also, clinicians will assess the potential for risk factors based on the 
patient’s medical history prior to prescribing/recommending  (prescription and OTC) 
medications and will suggest the lowest effective dose(s) for the shortest time necessary.  
Study providers will discuss risk/benefit profiles for specific medications with participants 
before making a shared decision on what medication to prescribe.  
 
Providers:  Medical care will be provided by a licensed medical provider with a minimum 
of [ADDRESS_1167229] a DEA license.  
 
Training:  Providers will receive 4 hours of training in protocols for medical visit activities, 
common intervention elements, medication prescription (first vs second -line), 
documentation, and adverse events.  
5.2. Handling of Study Interventions  
5.2.1.  Supported Self -Management (SSM) - Experimental Intervention  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Required Interventions  
The following are considered standard elements of the SSM intervention:  
● Needs assessment and collaborative development of an individualized treatment plan. 
Includes review of BPS baseline measures, a brief physical examination that includes 
manual palpation and brief postural, strength, and mobility assessments; completion 
of a Wellbeing Wheel (based on risk factors and the BPS model) and self -evaluation 
of what it would take to engage in adaptive pain behaviors (COM -B Self -Evaluation 
Questionnaire V1). These will be re -assessed as needed. In addition, a “Self -Reliance 
Check In ” will be completed at 6 weeks to initiate a conversation regarding release to 
self-care.  
 
34 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  ● Education  will be provided through the communication of key evidence -based 
information  about chronic pain, BRLP, BPS factors, and self -management to enhance 
patients’ knowledge.48 
 
● Skill training  will be provided as indicated in strategies and exercises directed towards 
enhancing physical, psychological, and social self -management skills. This includes 
physical exercises (e.g. postural, strength, stabilization and mobility exercises);20,31 
psychological strategies (e.g. progressive muscle relaxation, relaxed breathing, 
guided imagery, pacing, relaxation, problem solving, and cognitive 
restructuring);66,92,93 and social strategies, including pleasant activity planning with a 
social focus, and communication techniques for navigating relationships (e.g. work, 
family, friends) to garner support for self -sufficiency. Specific BCTs used as part of 
skill training in clude instructions, demonstrations, practice and rehearsal, self -
monitoring and graded progressions.55,56 
 
● Spi[INVESTIGATOR_839750] (SMT) are manual procedures applied by a practitioner 
to the lumbar and sacroiliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_25368]. SMT has been shown to be effective in 
relieving symptoms and improving mobility.20,31,102,103 SMT will be applied as a “bridge 
therapy” as indicated, to support patients’ abilities to engage in the skill development 
described above.  
 
SMT will include soft -tissue work (e.g. cross -fiber stretch, light friction massage, etc.), 
mobilization (low velocity, low -high amplitude passive movements) and manipulation 
(high velocity, low amplitude thrust)  
 
● Enablement (by [CONTACT_839825]) will also be applied as indicated 
to improve patients’ unhelpful beliefs about their capabilities to self -manage BRLP and 
overall wellbeing. Specific BCTs used as part of enablement include emotional 
support provided by [CONTACT_13917], value -based goal setting, and problem solving.55,56 
 
● Persuasion  will be used as needed to influence patients BRLP beliefs, optimism, and 
motivation which are important for the adaptation of healthy pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_610]. 
The following BCTs will be integrated into the intervention: verbal persuasion, focus 
on past successes, and framing/reframing.55,56 
 
● Resources and materials  will be provided to support the patient and include a 
workbook and digital recordings (e.g. of the physical, psychological and social 
exercises and strategies described above).   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Allowed Interventions  
The following summarizes optional SSM elements (based on patient needs):  
● Soft tissue techniques which include cross -fiber stretch, longitudinal stretch, direct 
pressure, and deep friction applied to soft tissue from the lower ribs to the gluteal folds.  
● Lumbar neural mobilization  
● Heat may be used to facilitate the delivery of SMT (up to 10 minutes)  
35

intervention elements described in the SSM protocol  
● Lumbar belts, strappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], tapi[INVESTIGATOR_276541].  
● Recommending bed rest  
5.3. Concomitant Interventions   
5.3.1.  Required Interventions  
All participants will receive basic standardized information regarding the generally 
favorable prognosis of chronic BRLP. We will provide patients with an updated version of 
the Back in Action book20 in print and/or electronic formats. The Back in Action book:  
● Encourages patients to engage in their normal activities as soon as possible, even if 
it causes some pain.  
● Encourages general aerobic exercise like walking, swimming, bicycling.  
● Provides a brief summary of the general causes of chronic BRLP and reassurance 
that the majority of cases do not require specialty care.  
● Emphasizes the patient’s role in facilitating their own recovery by [CONTACT_839826] (e.g. changing positions 
frequently).  
5.3.2.  Allowed Interventions   
● Participants will be allowed to use OTC medications as needed during the course of 
the study.  
● Participants will be allowed to continue self -care practices (e.g., heat, ice, stretching) 
for chronic BRLP they used prior to the study.  
● Participants assigned to SSM who experience a significant worsening of chronic BRLP 
symptoms that cannot be managed by [CONTACT_839827]’s medical care provider for a short -course of ‘rescue 
medication s’, using a protocol successfully implemented, but rarely required, in 
previous studies by [CONTACT_473].20    
○ Allowable ‘rescue medications’ will be identical to first - and second -line 
medications detailed in the medical care protocol. In addition, weak opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (e.g. 
Tramadol) may be used in select cases. Decisions regarding ‘rescue medication’ 
selection will be made collaboratively between the provider and patient after a 
discussion of risk/benefit profiles and preferences.  
● Treating clinicians, in consultation with the PIs, may refer for specialty care in the case 
of AEs or chronic BRLP complications that cannot be adequately managed with the 
assigned intervention (e.g., progressive neurological deficits).  
● Participants will be encouraged to seek any required care for conditions unrelated to 
the study.  
37 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  5.3.3.  Prohibited Interventions    
Participants will be asked to limit treatment to their assigned intervention for the length of 
the initial 12 -week intervention period. However, participants retain the right to 
discontinue study treatment at any time. Providers will be taught to refrain f rom delivering 
interventions that fall outside the scope of the study protocols (see above).  
5.4. Adherence Assessment      
The total number of treatments will be decided by [CONTACT_839828]’s clinical presentation and response to care, as is done in clinical 
practice. We anticipate [ADDRESS_1167230] participants receiving medical care. Participant adherence to 
assigned interventions will be documented at each visit in the clinical notes.  
Treatment adherence is defined as:  
● Attending 2 or more Medical Care sessions or 6 or more SSM sessions  
And 
● Not droppi[INVESTIGATOR_839751]  
5.5. Intervention Fidelity        
We will apply robust fidelity activities based on our experience from previous studies to 
facilitate future intervention replication, internal validity, and accurate interpretation of 
outcomes.96-98 This includes training and certification (described in section 5.1); use of 
standardized intervention checklists to guide clinicians through each session; and 
monthly group meetings with key investigators to receive ongoing coaching in intervention 
protoc ols.99 
 
Fidelity assessments . All intervention visits will be video recorded with patient consent; 
a random selection of 10% will be reviewed for fidelity by [CONTACT_2792]. 
Standardized fidelity instruments will be used to document required, allowed, and 
prohibited intervention activities and elements. Individualized feedback will be provided 
to providers as needed based on fidelity assessments.99,[ADDRESS_1167231] approximately 7 months (from initial 
screening to month 6 follow up assessment). Participants will be sent their final evaluation 
(a self -report survey) six months after randomization.

SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  6.2. Description of Evaluations            
6.2.1.   Pi[INVESTIGATOR_839754] 4 different time points: a brief initial online screen, a 
phone screen with study staff, and at two baseline screening appointments.  
Initial screening (Online/Phone)  
● Interested individuals will be initially screened by a web -based screening portal. 
An overview of the study will be provided during the web -screen, and electronic 
consent secured prior to collecting preliminary information on eligibility (e.g. age, 
English  literacy, BRLP severity)  
● Following the web -based screening, potential participants will undergo a phone 
interview with study staff to confirm inclusion criteria (e.g. age, duration and 
severity of BRLP) and the lack of easily identifiable exclusion criteria (e.g. history 
of spi[INVESTIGATOR_839755]). Verbal consent to collect this information will be collected at the 
initiation of the phone interview.  
Baseline Screening Appointments  
● Potential participants will be given a hard or electronic consent form to review on 
their own that will describe the screening and study procedures at the first baseline 
screening appointment. See Section 11 for a full description of the consent form. 
They  will be given ample time to review the form on their own and ask questions.  
● The Principal Investigators, research coordinator, or designee (i.e., research staff, 
an investigator) will review the consent form, section by [CONTACT_68979], one -on-one with 
each potential participant during the consent interview; participants will be invited 
to ask questions as they proceed through each section.  
● Easy to understand, IRB pre -approved, electronic and print informational 
materials, including visual media, will be used to facilitate understanding.  
● A signed and dated consent form will be obtained from each study candidate. All 
participants will be given a copy of the signed consent form for their personal 
records.  
● Original signed paper consent forms will be secured in the respective participants 
research file at the UMN. Signed e -consent forms will be maintained in REDCap.  
● Only individuals who demonstrate comprehension will be considered eligible to 
participate. Persons who are not able to read and write in English or consent for 
themselves are ineligible.  
● At the second baseline appointment, participants will confirm continued consent 
for the study prior to randomization.  
Consent & Human Subjects Training  
All research staff obtaining informed consent are required to undergo project specific 
human subjects training that addresses the essential components to the informed consent 
process. See Section 11 for additional information about the consent form. In add ition, 
40 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  staff will complete human subjects training in accordance with the UMN’s human subjects 
and HIPAA training requirements.   
Changes to the Informed Consent Form  
In the event the informed consent form changes, following necessary IRB approvals, 
study staff will meet with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_839756] a potential participant. See the Participants Rights and 
Confid entiality section for additional information.    
If potential participants need to be informed of specific changes in the risks or benefits of 
study participation, an addendum consent will be used. This addendum will be used to 
inform enrolled participants about significant new findings that may have a b earing on 
their willingness to continue participation in the study. The addendum consent will be 
given to the participant at a study visit or mailed to the participant's home.  
Screening Procedures  
Initial Screening (Online/Phone)  
● Following consent, potential participants will be asked a series of self -report questions 
through an online portal to screen basic eligibility. Persons who meet basic inclusion 
criteria (e.g., age, BRLP intensity of 3 or higher, English literacy) and who o therwise 
have no obvious exclusions (e.g., pregnancy, history of surgical fusion of lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]) will be contact[CONTACT_66696], who will ask specific health -related, questions 
pertaining to inclusion (e.g., LBP epi[INVESTIGATOR_353954]).  
● Baseline screening visits (In -person) will occur as soon as possible, but the first 
baseline screening visit must occur within 30 days of completing the phone screen; 
otherwise, the phone screen will be redone.  
Baseline Screening Visit 1  
● Written or electronic consent will be collected from participants prior to any screening 
procedures at this visit.  
● Participants will complete study surveys to collect basic demographic information 
along with health history information to inform the detailed clinical evaluation and 
confirm eligibility. The surveys will include:  
○ Demographics  
○ Limited set of key patient -reported outcomes (see Table 5)  
○ Past and ongoing BRLP treatment      
○ Comorbid health conditions  
■ Participants reporting current or past history of mental health disorders and 
related treatment will undergo additional screening if unmanaged major 
depression is suspected or reported. Scores of 3 or higher on the Patient Health 
Questionnaire -2 (PHQ -2)147 will lead to additional screening for suicidality. A 
score of 2 or higher on question 12 from the Quick Inventory of Depressive 
Symptomatology -Self Report (QIDS -SR)148 for suicidal ideation will warrant 
41 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  exclusion and referral. Mental health resources will be provided to these 
participants (e.g. suicide hotlines, emergency services)     
■ Participants reporting potential substance abuse (having 6 or more drinks on a 
weekly basis, using illegal drugs, or prescription medication for non -medical 
reasons) will undergo additional screening for potential substance abuse. 
Scores ≥ [ADDRESS_1167232] (AUDIT) 
for alcohol149or ≥ [ADDRESS_1167233] (DAST)[ADDRESS_1167234] will be 
available to administer at any time if the clinician suspects a problem.  
● A licensed healthcare provider (e.g., DC, PT, advanced practice nurse) will conduct a 
clinical history and a focused low back and lower extremity physical exam that will 
include posture assessment, orthopaedic and neurological tests (e.g. straight leg 
raise, lower extremity muscle strength, sensation, and reflexes), palpation, and 
vascular assessments. Current medications and vitals will also be collected.   
● Women with reproductive potential will take a pregnancy test.  
● Suspi[INVESTIGATOR_839757]/clinical exam will lead 
to administration of the Mini -mental state examination. A score of 23 or below is 
exclusionary.153 
● Eligible participants will complete baseline measures of self -reported study outcomes 
(see Table 5).  
 
Baseline Screening Visit 2 (within 21 days of Baseline Screening Visit 1)  
 
● Prior to the second baseline screening visit, investigators and study clinicians will 
review each case at weekly case review meetings for clinical eligibility determination. 
A review of inclusion and exclusion criteria based on the medical history, physica l 
exam, and patient reported measures collected at the first baseline screening visit will 
be conducted for each participant. The review committee reaches consensus on every 
case and recommends exclusion, inclusion, or further evaluation to determine 
eligibility (e.g. diagnostic imaging).  
● Potential participants who present with signs and symptoms suggestive of a specific 
cause of BRLP (e.g., nephrolithiasis, cauda equina), contraindication to study 
treatments, (e.g., inflammatory arthropathies of the lower back), or other condition that 
warrants medical attention will be referred to their medical provider for follow -up and 
management.  
● Eligible participants will complete repeat assessments of key patient reported 
outcomes to confirm eligibility (i.e. BRLP intensity) and account for potential 
regression to the mean (See Table 5). Baseline measures of other self -reported study 
outcomes (cl inical, behavioral, and mediating outcomes) will also be completed.  
● In addition, participants will provide feedback on key study recruitment and screening 
procedures using open -ended survey questions.  
● Confirmation of consent and randomization of eligible participants will occur at the 
second baseline screening visit.  
 
42 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  6.2.2  Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization  
Enrollment  
Enrollment is defined as the date of randomization at which point all eligibility criteria are 
confirmed and the individual has agreed to participate; this is recorded on a case -report 
form. AEs will be collected after the participant is enrolled. Participants will be told to 
contact [CONTACT_85602]/or providers about any health -related changes they experience. 
40-50 participants will be enrolled.  
Baseline Assessments  
Baseline measures will include demographic, occupational, clinical and behavioral 
characteristics, and mediating outcomes including the NIH Research Task Force’s 
minimum dataset for chronic LBP.111 The following will be collected at baseline:  
● Demographics including PhenX ToolkKit’s core measures for Social Determinants of 
Health155 
● Quebec Task Force Classification for spi[INVESTIGATOR_195048]95 and Pain Detect 
Questionnaire to identify neuropathic presentations of BRLP156 
● STarT Back Screening tool112  
Clinical Outcome Measures  
● BRLP and LBP frequency over the past week (number of days with BRLP symptoms).  
● BRLP and LBP intensity (0 -10 pain scale) over the past week using the ordinal 11 -box 
NRS (0=no BRLP/LBP, 10=the worst BRLP/LBP possible).  
● Disability will be measured with the 23 -item Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire 
which was adapted and validated for BRLP.115 
● PROMIS -29 +2 includes measures of pain interference with normal activities, physical 
function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression, and participation in social 
roles and activities.116-118 The PROMIS -29+2 also provides a preference -based 
summary of health -related quality of life.119 Other PROMIS/NIH Toolbox instruments 
will include social emotional support;116,117 domain -specific life satisfaction (e.g. work, 
family, housing);120 and perceived stress.122 
● Productivity loss related to BRLP (e.g., missed work, reduced productivity while at 
work) will be assessed using questions from the Institute for Medical Technology 
Assessment’s productivity cost questionnaire.123 
Behavioral Outcomes  
The following behavioral outcomes are chosen because they’re most likely to affect the 
experimental intervention:  
● Chronic pain copi[INVESTIGATOR_839758] - 2-item version.128 
● Over -the-counter and prescription medication use20 for BRLP, including class of 
medication and frequency of use.  
43 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  ● Healthcare use for BRLP including MRIs, injections, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], surgeries, and 
provider -based visits.20 
● Physical activity levels (e.g. amount of sedentary activity) measured with the 
International Physical Activity Questionnaire.[ADDRESS_1167235] the clinical and 
behavioral outcomes will also be collected to inform protocol refinement. These include:  
● BRLP related capabilities (e.g. knowledge, skills, physical capacity), opportunities 
(e.g. available resources), motivations (e.g. optimism)  51-53 for participants enrolled into 
supported self -management.  
● Beliefs related to self -efficacy as measured by [CONTACT_839829], symptoms, emotions, and social interactions (PROMIS self -efficacy for 
managing chronic conditions);130 the chronic pain acceptance questionnaire will also 
be administered.157 
● Fear-avoidance beliefs using the Fear -avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire 131  
● Catastrophizing measured using the 13 -item Pain Catastrophizing Scale;132  it uses a 
5-item point scale (0=not at all, 4 all the time) and has internal consistency and validity.  
● Expectations about back pain treatments (HEAL items).135  
 
Qualitative measures  
Qualitative measures will be collected from enrolled subjects, as well as providers 
regarding their views of barriers, facilitators, affordability, practicality, effectiveness, 
acceptability, and equity.  
As part of the supplemental aims, qualitative information will be collected from other 
stakeholders with pain who are underrepresented in CIH LBP/BRLP research to explore 
their views of barriers and facilitators to care for LBP/BRLP.  
 
Randomization  
In the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], r andomization precedes intervention administration. Randomization will 
occur within [ADDRESS_1167236] baseline screening visit. Participants who are 
not randomized within this time frame will repeat the in -person screening. Interventions 
will be initiated within 14 days of randomization/enrollment.  
 6.2.3.  Blinding   
Blinding of treatment providers and participants is not feasible. However, the following 
steps will be taken to minimize potential bias and enhance study rigor:  
● Study personnel involved in screening and enrollment will be masked to upcoming 
randomization assignments  
● The statistician will be blinded to treatment group until the analysis is complete.  
44 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  ● Participants will be queried in self -report questionnaires as to whether or not anybody 
attempted to influence their responses.  
Blinded Personnel:  Select investigators and the study statistician will be blinded until the 
database is locked and the analysis is complete. The study’s statistician will assign a 
member of his staff to create the random allocation tables according to the allocation 
plan, which will be administered using the randomization module in REDCap.  
 
Unblinded Personnel : The study coordinator, clinicians, data manager, and 
investigators participating in fidelity assessment will not be blinded to study 
interventions.  
 
Individuals authorized to break the blind: The PIs and their investigator designees are 
authorized to break the blind.  
Circumstances for breaking the blind : This will occur when it is in the participants’ safety - 
related interest. The primary example is a reportable adverse event.  
 
6.2.4  Follow -up Visits  
Intervention Visits (M0 -M6) 
The following information will be collected at each intervention visit  in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] , 
which will occur as needed throughout the six months, as there is no set schedule of 
treatments:

person study visit or via mail following enrollment in the study.  
For the supplemental aims qualitative interviews, participants will be compensated $50.00 
per interview.  
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS   
7.1. AEs and SAEs, Expectedness, and Relatedness - Definitions  
The Co -PIs are responsible for adjudicating AEs/SAEs.  
Adverse Event  
AE is generally defined as any unfavorable and unintended diagnosis, symptom, sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), syndrome or disease which either occurs 
during the study, having been absent at baseline, or if present at baseline, appears to 
worsen. AEs are to be recorded regardless of their relationship to the study intervention.   
The following scale will be used to grade AEs:  
1.  Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL).  
2.  Moderate: minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on 
ADL.  
3.  Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical 
attention, needs major assistance with ADL.  
We will measure and compare rates of AEs across the two treatment arms. We will 
specifically look for common treatment -related AEs that include: LBP, soreness at the 
treatment site, gastrointestinal symptoms, emotional discomfort, and other events. We 
will capture AEs prospectively from study participants through monthly surveys and at 
intervention visits. Each unique occurrence will receive a separate ID in order to avoid 
duplication in documentation.  
Serious Adverse Event  
SAE is generally defined as any untoward medical occurrence that  
● results in death  
● is life threatening  
● requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
48 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  ● results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or is  
● a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
We will collect SAEs both passively through ad hoc reporting and through systematic 
evaluation at study visits. Given the nature of the interventions we do not anticipate any 
specific treatment -related SAEs and therefore focus on standard and BRLP -specific  
serious events: death; severe or permanent disabilities; life -threatening conditions; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]; other important medical events; progressive neurological deficits, or 
cauda equina syndrome.  
Expectedness :  
AEs and SAEs will be classified as expected if  
● They have been documented as a known adverse reaction (disclosed in the consent 
form) or are part of an existing comorbid disease process. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_839760].  
Relatedness to Research Participation :  
AEs and SAEs will be classified as either unrelated, unlikely related, possibly related, 
probably related, or definitely related to participation in the research project. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_839761]. To assess relationship of an  event 
to study intervention, the following guidelines are used:  
Related (Possible, Probable, Definite)  
● The event is known to occur with the study intervention.  
● There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
● The event abates when the intervention is discontinued.  
● The event reappears upon a re -challenge with the intervention.  
Not Related (Unlikely, Unrelated)  
● There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
● An alternate etiology has been established.  
 
7.2 Adverse Event Identification            
Adverse events will be identified in the following ways:  
● Following enrollment, participants will be asked about the occurrence of AE/SAEs by 
[CONTACT_839833].  
● Participants will be informed to report AE/SAEs directly to study staff throughout the 
study period  
● Participants will be asked if they experienced any AE/SAEs during their monthly self -
report questionnaires.  
[ADDRESS_1167238]; resolution 
and stabilization will be determined by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_839762].  
AEs During the Intervention Phase  
If an AE/SAE occurs during the intervention phase, the study clinician or designee will 
obtain information about the event, which will be used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_839763], 
expectedness and relatedness to the study. The study clinician will monitor the  AE/SAE 
while the participant is under their care; this will include a medical evaluation and 
treatment, or modifications to treatment as necessary to protect the participant and 
minimize harm. If warranted, referral to an outside provider will be made. Pa rticipants who 
cannot continue with the study intervention due to safety concerns will be removed from 
the intervention and/or study when warranted. See Study Discontinuation.  
The rescue medication protocol may apply. See Rescue Medication.  
AEs During the Monthly Follow -Up (M1 -M6) 
If an AE/SAE occurs during the follow -up phase, study staff (clinician, coordinator, PI [INVESTIGATOR_126985]) will contact [CONTACT_2299] (or their emergency contact [CONTACT_6635]’s 
permission), to obtain information about the event, including but not limit ed to what 
happened, when the event occurred, and treatment rendered. This information will be 
used by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_839763], expectedness and relatedness to the study.  
Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. Resolution 
and stabilization will be determined by a PI [INVESTIGATOR_839762].  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_839764] 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures            
AEs/SAEs/Unanticipated problems will be reported to NCCIH and the UMN IRB. 
“Awareness” or “Aware” is defined as the date on which the research team is able to 
discuss the event with the participant (or their designee) to gather additional information 
about  the event for adjudication. See AEs and SAEs, Expectedness, and Relatedness - 
Definitions for information related to how decisions will be made regarding determining 
relatedness and severity.  
NCCIH  
Unexpected fatal or life -threatening AEs related to the intervention will be reported to 
the NCCIH Program Officer within [ADDRESS_1167239] of inclusion in the annual report and in the annual 
AE summary which will be provided to NCCIH.  
 
UMN IRB  
The UMN IRB will be notified via a Report of New Information (RNI) of any harm (e.g. AE 
or SAE)  experienced by a participant or other individual that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_839765], is unexpected and at least probably related  to the research procedures within 
5 business days of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
Unexpected death: Unexpected death of a locally enrolled participant whether considered 
related to the research or not will be reported to the UMN IRB via a RNI within 5 business 
days of the study team being made aware of the event. Death is considered une xpected 
if the risk of death is not listed in the consent form.  
If new information becomes available to the research team that suggests a new or 
increased risk to study participants, a safety issue or a reduction in benefit, this 
information will be reported to the UMN IRB via a RNI within 5 business days of the study 
team being made aware of the new information.  
Effective March 27, 2017, submitting logs of events at continuing review is not required.  
See Protocol Deviations for reporting information related to deviations and participant 
harm.  
7.5. Known Expected Risks     
Supported Biopsychosocial Self-Management  
The risks associated with SSM are considered low for subjects who meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria. To further minimize risks, licensed doctors of chiropractic 
(DC) and physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (PT) will be trained and certified by [CONTACT_431], and 
monit ored for fidelity to ensure they are implementing SSM in a manner that optimizes 
patient safety. Experienced investigators and consultants will be available as needed to 
assist DCs and PTs in managing adverse events if needed. The core elements of SSM 
include physical, psychological and social strategies.  
 
Physical : Side effects associated with manual treatment and exercise are common and 
benign. Approximately 35% of participants in our previous BRLP trial reported expected 
self-limiting adverse events that were mild to moderate in severity (e.g. increased pain, 
soreness).20 
51 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  Serious adverse events following manual treatment to the lower back are rare and are 
estimated to occur once per million to several million visits.  
Psychological and social : Subjects may experience some short -lasting emotional 
discomfort during and outside the sessions when practicing the psychological and social 
exercises and strategies (e.g. of relaxed breathing, guided imagery, pacing, relaxation, 
pacing, problem solving,  cognitive restructuring, interpersonal communication, etc.).  
Expected risks include  
● Cauda equina syndrome  
● Disc herniation  
● Emotional discomfort  
● Exacerbation of low back pain/back related leg pain, soreness or stiffness in the region 
treated  
● Fracture  
● Hematomas or hemorrhagic cysts.31, [ADDRESS_1167240] and 
second -line medications for the study protocol was informed by [CONTACT_839834]. Licensed 
medical providers will care for participants randomized to medical care. Pharmacological 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_839766].31 Study 
providers will discuss risk/benefit profiles for specific medications with participants before 
making a shared decision on what medication to prescribe.  
Expected risks include:  
● Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs  (First -Line Medications)  
○ Serious risks include cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, heart failure, high 
blood pressure), gastrointestinal bleeding, allergic reaction (hives, skin irritation, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], edema), kidney failure, skin reactions, liver failure, and a sthma 
attacks.   
○ Other side effects include stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, gas, heartburn, 
nausea, vomiting and dizziness.   
● Second -line medications   
○ Serious risks with these medications include allergic reaction, seizures, infection, 
hyperglycemia, bone fracture, liver or kidney damage, and addiction or abuse.  
○ Other risks include sedation, drowsiness, fatigue, sleep problems, headache, 
weight gain, muscle weakness, mental/physical impairment, dry mouth, abdominal 
pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, gastritis, occult bleeding, dizziness, vertigo, 
tremor, syncope, a nd leukopenia.  
 
52 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_839767]: there are few risks 
associated with this data collection. Risks include feeling uncomfortable answering 
certain questions; to minimize this, participants can decline responding to questions  
 
7.6. Safety Monitoring            
The Independent Monitoring Committee (IMC) for this study will review accruing data on 
a semi -annual basis to ensure:  
1. The study is adequately enrolling to meet targeted goals  
2. Data collection and protocol adherence rates are acceptable  
3. There are no serious safety concerns  
7.7. Potential Benefits    
There may be no direct benefit to participants. Some participants may experience an 
improvement or resolution of their BRLP or associated signs and symptoms. Some 
participants may learn new ways to manage their BRLP on their own.  
8. INTERVENTION DISCONTINUATION  
Criteria for Discontinuation  
Participants will be discontinued from their assigned intervention if the study interventions 
become contraindicated, for example:  
● A serious adverse event related to treatment occurs and thus makes it unsafe to 
continue with the assigned intervention.  
● The participant has a specific cause of BRLP and was erroneously diagnosed during 
screening.  
● New evidence emerges and suggests it is unsafe for the participant to proceed with 
the intervention.  
  
Criteria for discontinuation are met when the event is classified as serious and it is 
determined by [CONTACT_720025]/or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_839768], or when a diagnosis for a specific cause of BRLP is made.  
  
Reasons for Discontinuation  
All efforts will be taken to facilitate participant’s completion of the study interventions. 
Potential reasons for early termination include:  
 
● Participant develops a competing comorbid health condition that precludes adherence 
or makes it unsafe for them to proceed with their assigned treatment.  
● A change in the participant’s life (e.g., participant moves, dies, has other personal 
matters to attend).  
● Participant chooses to discontinue on their own for any reason (e.g., participant is not 
responding to care or getting worse).  
● Study closure by [CONTACT_272968].  
[ADDRESS_1167241] discontinued treatment will be asked to complete 
weekly questionnaires and monthly questionnaires, if possible. Efforts will be made to 
accommodate participant compliance.  
   
Temporary Discontinuation of the Intervention  
Potential reasons for temporary intervention discontinuation include:  
● An acute health problem arises and prohibits their ability to attend the intervention 
(e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). The length of discontinuation will be addressed on a case -by-
case basis. All attempts will be made to minimize this discontinuation.  
● Participant has a scheduled vacation. Participants will be asked to limit their vacation 
time during the active intervention phase of the study.  
 
Withdrawal Procedures  
Participants will be asked to submit a letter or email in writing to the PI (signed and dated 
when possible) if they want to withdraw from the study. For reporting purposes, research 
staff will inquire about reasons for their withdrawal. Participants may a lso be asked if 
they’re willing to complete self -report questionnaires as a means of collecting primary and 
secondary outcomes. If they refuse, participants will not be contact[CONTACT_38435]. 
A formal letter will be sent by [CONTACT_978], or designee, indic ating receipt of their request for 
withdrawal and additional provisions around data collection, if applicable. The letter will 
reiterate our appreciation for their participation to date and remind participants that their 
withdrawal will not affect their re lationship with the university. Further, regulatory bodies 
will be provided summary information related to attrition (e.g., losses to follow -up, 
withdrawals etc.). Individual participants will not be named.  
 
Termination Procedures  
This research may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_839835], the NIH, OHRP, UMN, 
or other government agencies as part of their duties to ensure research participants are 
protected.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1. General Design Issues            
We will conduct a parallel, two -group randomized pi[INVESTIGATOR_839769] a future 
phase II multi -site randomized clinical trial. A total of 40 -50 participants with chronic back -
related leg pain (BRLP) will be randomly assigned to either 12 weeks of: 1) Supported 
Self-Management (SSM) or 2) Medical Care. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_839770]. The aims of the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_58780]:  
1. To conduct a Planning Phase to develop detailed protocols and procedures, train 
project personnel, and secure necessary oversight approvals.  
2. To assess future trial feasibility through achievement of pre -specified targets for:  
54 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  a. Recruiting and enrolling individuals with chronic BRLP by [CONTACT_839806]; enrollment rates; and screened participants’ views and perspectives  
b. Delivering experimental and comparison interventions by [CONTACT_839807]; provider intervention fidelity rates; and participant and provider 
views  
c. Data collection by [CONTACT_839808]  
9.2. Sample Size   
The sample size for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_839771], who have found approximately 15 -20 participants per group sufficient for 
informing the feasibility of larger, randomized clinical trials. The feasibility  of recruitment, 
enrollment, intervention acceptability and credibility, participant adherence, provider 
fidelity, and data collection activities will be assessed using designated feasibility 
measures and targets. Protocol refinement measures will be colle cted using qualitative 
and quantitative methods to identify areas for modification in the future trial. Because of 
the relatively small number of providers needed for a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], and budget restrictions, 
we will also engage our consultants and The Clini cian Advisory Panel to provide input to 
the development and subsequent revisions of the intervention and training protocols.  
9.3. Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Enrolled subjects will be randomized using blocked randomization (with varying block 
sizes) following stratification for back -related leg pain classification (QTF classification 2, 
3, or 4).95 Computer generated random treatment assignments will be generated by [CONTACT_839818] (the 
electronic study database) at the time of enrollment to preserve allocation concealment. 
Screening clini cians and study staff will be blinded to upcoming treatment assi gnments.  
 
9.4. Outcomes

9.5. Data Analyses            
Feasibility outcomes (Aims 2a -2c) will be assessed using a combination of descriptive 
statistics and qualitative analyses (described under Protocol refinement measures). For 
AIM 2a, we will determine the mean number of participants screened/month and 
enrol led/month in addition to the percentage of women and minorities screened and 
enrolled. For AIM 2b, we will report the percentage of enrolled participants compliant with 
treatment protocols by [CONTACT_19313] (visit attendance, home practice, contamination) and 
57 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  percentage of treatment visits delivered according to protocol (provider fidelity). For AIM 
2c, percentage of outcome assessments completed at 12 weeks and 6 months will be 
described, in addition to the percentage of weekly pain severity and frequency 
asse ssments completed.  
Protocol refinement measures will be analyzed and presented descriptively in a similar 
fashion as described above. Qualitative data (collected via open -ended questions in 
REDCap surveys, and transcribed interviews), will be analyzed using template style 
qualitative content analysis informed by [CONTACT_839839] (see 
Figure 2).89,106,137 -139  by [CONTACT_839840].21,89,90,136 Representative quotations will be identified during the coding 
process, and  coded themes will be quantified by [CONTACT_839841], and presented as frequencies.139   
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1.  Data Collection Forms          
Initial screening data will be directly entered by [CONTACT_839842] a web -
based survey. Phone -based screening data, in -person, and virtual video/teleconference 
screening data will be entered directly into the study REDCap database by [CONTACT_839843]. A procedure/visit case report form will be filled out by [CONTACT_839844] -related visit and electronically entered directly into the study REDCap 
database. Electronic web -based surveys will be sent to st udy participants as indicated in 
section 6, with computer -assisted telephone interviewing or mailed surveys used as a 
back -up in cases where follow -up may be challenging.  
10.2.  Data Management          
The Principal Investigators, Data Manager and Project Director are responsible for 
ensuring the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of study data. All source documents 
will be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate interpretation of data.   
10.2.1. Data security and storage   
CRFs for this study will be entered into a REDCap database, which uses a MySQL 
database via a secure web interface with data checks used during data entry to ensure 
data quality. REDCap includes a complete suite of features to support HIPAA compliance, 
including a full audit trail, user -based privileges, and integration with the institutional LDAP 
server. The MySQL database and the web server will both be housed on secure servers 
operated by [CONTACT_163673]’s Information S ystems 
group (AHC -IS). The servers are in a physically secure location on campus and are 
backed up nightly, with the backups stored in accordance with the AHC -IS retention 
schedule of daily, weekly, and monthly tapes retained for 1 month, 3 months, and 6 
months, respectively. Weekly backup tapes are stored offsite. The AHC -IS servers 
provide a stable, secure, well -maintained, and high -capacity data storage environment, 
and both REDCap and MySQL are widely -used, powerful, reliable, well -supported 
58 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  systems. Access to the study's data in REDCap will be restricted to the members of the 
study team by [CONTACT_125698]. Electronic communication with outside 
collaborators will involve only non -identifiable information and investigators will be blinded  
to group assignment until after the analysis by [CONTACT_839845].  
Electronic source documents will be stored on password protected computers issued by 
[CONTACT_137025]. University -issued computers are supported and maintained 
by [CONTACT_839846] -Information system. Participant ID numbers will be 
used to protect participants’ confidentiality. All paper source documents (e.g. combined 
signed consent forms & HIPAA forms) will be stored in a locked file cabinet, in a locked 
office at the University of Minnesota maintained by [CONTACT_839847] h er 
designees.  
10.3.  Quality Assurance and Control  
10.3.1.  Quality Assurance   
The primary method of data collection for participant self -reported outcomes will be direct 
electronic entry through a survey interface with REDCap. Logic rules specifying the type 
and range of acceptable responses will be programmed into REDCap. Participa nts will 
receive an error message if they enter an invalid response.  
10.3.2.  Training   
Training for study staff responsible for data collection will be conducted prior to study 
recruitment. Certification by [CONTACT_458] (or designee) requires adherence 
to standard operating procedures for data collection outlined in the study p rotocol. Staff 
will be required to demonstrate proficiency in key data management steps (screening, 
randomization, data entry, documentation of AEs, data management protocol 
compliance, etc.).  
10.3.3.  Quality Control Committee   
The Study Steering Committee will review reports on data capture and quality on a 
monthly basis. Missing data reporting and other customized reports will be developed in 
order to facilitate efficient workflow and high -quality data capture. CRF -specific fol low-up 
rates will be tabulated on a nightly basis and reviewed during the weekly check -in 
meetings between the PIs and study staff.   
10.3.4.  Metrics   
For each follow -up survey, we aim to achieve an 85% or higher follow -up rate. We will 
utilize a combination of web -based survey, telephone and text -based outreach, and 
mailed surveys to achieve maximal survey response. Survey completion rates will be 
prima rily based upon the completion of pain and functional outcome measures, but we 
will additionally tabulate follow -up by [CONTACT_839848]. Data on other key feasibility measures and targets will also be reviewed weekly 
59 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  by [CONTACT_839849] (e.g. recruitment rates, 
enrollment rates, intervention acceptability, credibility, and adherence, provider fidelity, 
adverse event reporting).  
Loss to Follow -Up: Participants are considered loss to follow -up if any of the criteria below 
are met:  
1. Participant dies  
2. Participant formally withdraws from the study  
3. Participant misses 3 consecutive monthly and 8 consecutive weekly surveys without 
responding to reminders by [CONTACT_6968] (at least 3) or phone (at least 3).  
Participant’s meeting criteria [ADDRESS_1167242] continuation of data collection activities.  
10.3.5.  Protocol Deviations   
A protocol deviation occurs when activities on this study diverge from the UMN IRB 
approved protocol. Examples include divergence(s), that  
● Reduce the quality or completeness of the data,  
● Make the Informed Consent Form inaccurate, or  
● Impacts a subject's safety, rights, or welfare.  
Protocol deviations include, but are not limited to the following:  
● Failure to keep IRB approval up to date  
● Outcome assessment and/or measurement not performed  
● Implementing protocol modifications without obtaining prospective IRB approval;  
● Conducting research during a lapse in IRB approval;  
● Enrolling more subjects than what’s approved in the protocol;  
● Performing research procedures outside the protocol specified window;  
● Failure on the part of any individual involved in research review or oversight to abide 
by [CONTACT_115155], or the University of Minnesota IRB policies.  
● Randomization of an ineligible participant; not -adhering to inclusion/exclusion criteria;  
● Failure to obtain Informed Consent or altering from the informed consent process as 
described in the IRB approved protocol;  
● Obtaining consent using an outdated consent form;  
● Performing non -exempt human subject research without obtaining prospective 
University IRB approval;  
● Failure to report an SAE  
● Wrong intervention administered to a participant  
Protocol deviations will be logged by [CONTACT_835684]. Details regarding the 
protocol deviation including whether it resulted in an adverse event will be included in the 
log. Reports on protocol deviations will be reviewed by [CONTACT_839850] m on a 
regular basis. Corrective action plans will be implemented when relevant. Study operating 
60 
SUPPORT Study Protocol V3 May 2022  procedures will be modified as necessary based on review of protocol deviation 
summaries.  
Protocol deviations that result in harm to a research participant will be reported to the 
UMN IRB via a RNI within 5 business days of the study team being made aware of the 
harm and/or deviation.  
 
10.3.6.  Monitoring   
Automated queries will be used to assess protocol deviations (e.g. missing evaluations 
or evaluations performed outside of allowed timeframe, non - compliance with assigned 
interventions). In addition, 100% of enrolled participants' records will be reviewed to 
ensure proper recording of screening data, informed consent documentation, and 
treatment fidelity. The PIs and the Study Steering Committee wil l review findings from the 
monitoring reports and other measures of trial progress and quality on a monthly basis.

1. Abstract
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the research hypothesis,
and the importance of the research.
This study will systematically evaluate whether cannabinoids can enhance the analgesic efficacy of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which
will advance the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of acute and/or chronic pain. Chronic pain affects over [ADDRESS_281783] of cannabidiol (CBD; Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]) on
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced analgesia. The study will aim to complete 40 healthy adults (20 men/women) through a within-
subject, dose-response evaluation of cannabinoids on the analgesic effect of hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Subjects will
complete [ADDRESS_281784] once weekly and will enable subjects to admit themselves
into a clinical research unit the night before the session to complete the study session as needed. Subjects will receive
a dose of hydromorphone (4mg, oral) and a double-blind oral dose of study drug or placebo the morning of each
experimental session, and will undergo quantitative sensory testing (QST; a comprehensive pain testing battery),
provide self-report ratings of drug effects, and complete a neurocognitive battery. QST testing will comprehensively
and systematically measure pain sensitivity, and provide information on the full range of analgesic effects possible
across a wide variety of pain measures, including threshold responses (thermal, pressure), temporal summation, cold
pressor, conditioned pain modulation, and capsaicin sensitization. Primary outcomes will be magnitude and duration
of pain as a function of study drug dose. Additional primary aims include proxy measures of abuse liability and
neurocognitive performance. All measures will be assessed as a function of sex, due to substantial evidence that
men/women differ with regard to pain perception, endogenous cannabinoid receptor density, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_233376].
We hypothesize that cannabinoids will shift the analgesic curve of hydromorphone and enhance analgesia effects.
Results from this study will help advance the acceptance of cannabinoids from use with only treatment-refractory
pain conditions to widespread societal use for clinical pain.
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)
1. Primary Aim 1: Evaluate the magnitude and duration of combined cannabidiol and hydromorphone
to reduce pain sensitivity in a validated model of pain . We hypothesize that the addition of a cannabidiol
to hydromorphone will result in a dose-dependent increase in the magnitude and duration of analgesia in
patients undergoing a validated laboratory model of pain.
2. Primary Aim 2: Evaluate the subjective responses to combinations of cannabidiol and hydromorphone
to determine the subjective, euphoric effects of the combination products . We hypothesize that
cannabidiol will not increase the subjective ratings of positive drug effects or other proxy measures of abuse
liability, relative to hydromorphone alone.

3. Primary Aim 3 : Evaluate the degree to which combining cannabidiol with hydromorphone impacts
neurocognitive performance . We hypothesize that cannabidiol may reduce neurocognitive performance at
high doses, relative to hydromorphone alone, though the degree to which this may occur is unknown. This
aim is critical for the advancement of potential opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]/cannabinoid combination products.
4. Secondary Aim 1: Evaluate whether there are sex differences on study outcomes. We hypothesize that
cannabidiol enhancement of hydromorphone-analgesia will be greater among female vs. male subjects.
3.  Background (briefly describe pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, drug or
device, and any other relevant information to justify the research).
This study will systematically evaluate whether cannabinoids can enhance the analgesic efficacy of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], which
will advance the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of acute and/or chronic pain.
Scope of the problem:  Chronic pain affects over 100 million Americans - more than diabetes, heart disease,
and cancer combined 1 . It exacts substantial suffering, physical disability, and is incredibly costly. Persistent pain
profoundly impairs quality of life 2;[ADDRESS_281785] an obligation to treat their patient ’s pain and opi[INVESTIGATOR_233377] [ADDRESS_281786] notably
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-related overdose deaths. Accidental poisonings are now the leading cause of accidental death in adults aged
25-64 7 , and 72% of overdose deaths involve opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467], 8  a higher prevalence than deaths from heroin and
cocaine combined 9-11 . Improper use of prescription painkillers results in an estimated $72.[ADDRESS_281787] productivity.
The phenomena associated with high dosing, abuse, and addiction continues to challenge the clinical community and
poses an important question to the scientific community – is there a method to enhance opi[INVESTIGATOR_233378]?
Potential to combine cannabinoids with opi[INVESTIGATOR_233379]:  Population based studies in fibromyalgia,
arthritis, muscular sclerosis and spi[INVESTIGATOR_233380] 13 . Currently, 12-15%
of the population uses medicinal cannabis and the most commonly cited reason is for chronic pain 14 . A systematic
review reported that >80% of trials demonstrated a significant analgesic effect of cannabinoid relative to placebo 15  and
the endocannabinoid system (ECS) offers a strong mechanistic rationale for the pain reducing actions of
cannabinoids 16 . Further, there is now substantial preclinical evidence in rodents 119-122  (C ic h e w icz , M a r ti n, Sm it h, &
Welc h, 1999 ;  F i nn et  al ., 2004 ;  Sm it h, C ic h e w icz , M a r ti n, & W elc h, 1998 ;  W elc h & S te v e ns, 1992 ;  W illia ms et  al ., 2006) and
primates 123-[ADDRESS_281788], PAG, thalamus, and cortical regions associated with central pain
processing, including the anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala and the prefrontal cortex 17 . CB2 receptor modulation
also decreases pro-inflammatory mediators in a manner that may contribute to antinociceptive effects and improve
endogenous neuroinflammatory properties that play an important role in pain perception 18 . However, the synergistic
combination of co-administering cannabinoids with opi[INVESTIGATOR_233381]-human animal results will generalize to human subjects is unknown. The only
Phase I study, of which we are aware, evaluating this concept reported that patients who received 10-20mg of
dronabinol with their stable and normally prescribed dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_233382] 19 . A Phase II study found that titrated dronabinol in chronic pain patients
receiving a stable dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_233383], reduced secondary problems associated with pain,
and increased ratings on a self-report satisfaction scale (0-10) compared to baseline [ADDRESS_281789] measurement of pain:  Chronic pain is conceptualized as a disease of the nervous system that involves
varying degrees of peripheral input and dysregulation of central nociceptive modulatory systems 20;21 , which are
frequently assessed with laboratory measures. Due to the potential confounding of disease-specific factors, such as
severity and duration, differences in pain management and systemic inequalities, as well as the potential issue of
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced hyperalgesia, systematic quantitative sensory testing (QST, in which the noxious stimuli are
rigorously calibrated and standardized) in healthy individuals is of great value to elucidate sensory characteristics 22-25 .
Human experimental pain models link animal and clinical pain studies, and has specifically been recommended for
testing analgesic compounds, and noted as “ideally suited ” in proof-of-concept and dose finding studies 26 . These

experimental designs allow for precise control over the nature of the noxious stimuli applied to the nervous system
and are crucial in examining and understanding the underlying mechanisms that account for physiological pain
sensitivity and pain perception in clinical pain reports. That is, physically identical stimuli can be applied to all
subjects, permitting the study of drug effects in the experience of pain and minimizing confounding by [CONTACT_233457]. Such variability in psychophysical pain responses
strongly parallels the variability in clinical pain in many samples 27-32  (i.e., subjects who are most pain-sensitive in the
laboratory also report the most intense or frequent clinical pain). The use of QST to evaluate drug effects on pain
responses is well-established, sensitive and frequently used in mechanistic studies 33-[ADDRESS_281790] and clinical pain responses in healthy 29;36-[ADDRESS_281791]-surgical pain 44-48  and
treatment outcomes 49;[ADDRESS_281792] measures in chronic pain patients 61;[ADDRESS_281793], is also observed in chronic pain patients at risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9724] 64 . Importantly, both static
(measures including threshold and tolerance) and dynamic (methods that probe central pain systems) QST are
responsive to the influences of analgesics 59;65;66  and are frequently used to determine analgesic efficacy 35;[ADDRESS_281794]
using these methods (see Figure 1). We do not know of any studies that have used QST to rigorously evaluate
cannabinoid-induced analgesia.
Conclusion : This study is a companion study to IRB protocol 00097937, which was the [ADDRESS_281795] drug development
(abuse liability, neurocognitive impairment) and the effect of participant sex on outcomes. The ultimate goal of this
research will be to determine which medication/dose combinations may exert strong analgesic effects, while
minimizing abuse liability and cognitive deficits, in order to advance these medications into clinical trials for the
treatment of chronic pain.
4. Study Procedures
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care).
Project Overview : This study will enroll 50 healthy adults, and will aim to complete 30 (15 men, 15 women)
participants. Participants will conduct a within-subject evaluation of the degree to which the FDA-approved
cannabinoid cannabidiol (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]) enhances the analgesic effect of the prototypic opi[INVESTIGATOR_233384]
(Dilaudid). Subjects will complete a Screening visit to establish study eligibility and 5 experimental sessions.
Experimental sessions will occur approximately once weekly and will permit subjects to admit themselves into the
clinical research unit the night before the session if interested. Subjects will be provided with taxi service to and from
the session. Subjects will receive a dose of hydromorphone (4mg, oral) and a double-blind oral dose of study drug or
placebo the morning of each experimental session, and will undergo QST measures of laboratory evoked pain,
provide self-report ratings of drug effects, and complete a neurocognitive battery. The order of sessions will be
randomized with the exception of Session 1, which will always be active hydromorphone + placebo to ensure the
participant has a safe response to hydromorphone before proceeding into the remaining sessions.
Subject Recruitment:  Subjects will be recruited from the greater Baltimore area using established recruiting resources
and media advertising, including newspaper, radio, and website listings. All interested individuals will first complete
a phone screen to establish initial study eligibility and individuals who pass will be invited for an in-person screening
during which final study eligibility will be determined.
Screening Visit:  Subjects will complete a brief phone screen to determine initial eligibility and will be invited to
complete an in-clinic or remote screen. Subjects will review and sign an informed consent document with a study
staff member to begin the Screening visit. Subjects will provide a urine sample that must test negative for illicit drugs
JHM I RB  e For m A  01
Vers i on  3  D ate d :  06 / 200 7
Page  4  of  21
and pregnancy (for females), and will then complete a battery of measures to establish study eligibility. Medical
eligibility will be determined by [CONTACT_233458], a blood sample to analyze hepatic,
hematologic, and chemistry functioning, and a medical history and physical, which will occur prior to any drug
administration. A sample will also be collected to determine P450 CYP 2D6 and 3A4 genotype, to help characterize
drug effects during the data analyses phase.
Experimental Sessions:  Upon final eligibility confirmation, subjects will complete [ADDRESS_281796] and self-report measures (from which
all subsequent ratings will be compared for data analysis purposes). An oral capsule containing either study drug or
placebo will then be administered and hydromorphone (4mg oral in four sessions and a placebo oral dose in one
session) will be administered. The time of drug administration will be selected to enable both cannabidiol and
hydromorphone to exert peak effects at the same time. Subjects will complete QST (see below) and self-report
measures at regular intervals following study drug administration. Self-report measures will include specific opi[INVESTIGATOR_233385], to assess whether cannabinoids are exerting an effect on a particular category of
opi[INVESTIGATOR_233386], and will capture whether any negative effects (e.g., nausea) occur as a function of the
cannabinoid dose. Frequent collection will enable evaluation of time to peak drug effects, duration of effects, and
general time course of effects and is a widely used and accepted approach in laboratory studies of drug effects.
During the final assessment each day, subjects will complete a Drug vs. Money Questionnaire to indicate the dollar
value they would place upon the drugs received [ADDRESS_281797] effects at the end
of the session will be provided overnight accommodation in the CRU; based on our experience we expect this to a
rare occurrence. Any participant who needs to reside in the CRU will be tested for Covid-[ADDRESS_281798] before they are
transitioned from BPRU to the CRU.
Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) Measures of Laboratory Evoked Pain:  Subjects will complete a state-of-the-art
quantitative sensory testing (QST) battery, which will comprehensively and systematically measure pain sensitivity.
This approach will provide information regarding the full range of analgesic effects possible, across a wide variety of
psycho-physiologically-mediated, experimentally-induced measures of pain perception. Subjects will complete a
baseline QST session prior to study drug administration on each experimental session day, and will complete the pain
testing battery at regular intervals during the experimental session day. Each administration of the QST battery will
take 20-[ADDRESS_281799] of threshold and tolerance, temporal summation, and conditioned
pain modulation (CPM) tests. The threshold responses will be conducted in randomized and counter-balanced order,
and conditioned pain modulation will always occur last.
Threshold Responses  will be assessed using thermal and pressure stimulation. Thermal threshold: All
contact [CONTACT_233459] a peltier-element-based stimulator (Medoc, Israel). Two trials of heat pain
threshold will be administered using an ascending method of limits paradigm. The thermode will gradually increase
in temperature (rate of rise = .5 o C/sec) from a pre-set baseline (31 o C), until the subject indicates when the stimulus
“first feels painful ” (threshold, HPTh) and presses a button (which terminates the procedure) indicating that the pain
is intolerable (tolerance, HPTo). Pressure threshold : A pressure algometer will be utilized to assess responses to
pressure stimulation at a variety of anatomical sites in a randomly determined order. The pressure algometer
(Somedic; Sweden) uses a rubber probe covered with 1mm polypropylene material; pressure at the site is gradually
JHM I RB  e For m A  01
Vers i on  3  D ate d :  06 / [ADDRESS_281800] perceived as painful, which terminates the
application. The algometer produces a sensation of localized pressure; technicians will place the probe of the
algometer in the center of each muscle group or anatomic site when delivering the mechanical stimuli. Thirty-second
inter-stimulus intervals will be maintained for all stimuli. Each trial will be averaged together to result in one HPTh,
HPTo, and PPTh measure.
Temporal Summation (TS) of Pain w ill be assessed in 2 ways, using repetitive thermal stimuli and repetitive
punctuate stimuli. Sequences of 10 heat pulses will be applied using the Medoc. (Note: within each 10-pulse
sequence, the temperature of each phasic stimulus is the same). Within each sequence, successive thermal pulses at a
given temperature will be delivered for a duration of approximately 0.[ADDRESS_281801]  thermal stimulus. 99
Mechanical Temporal Summation will be studied using punctate stimulators (a set of weighted pi[INVESTIGATOR_233387] (flat contact [CONTACT_233460] 0.2 mm diameter) that exert forces of 8- 512 mN). The
probes are applied perpendicular to the skin. We will apply both single stimuli and 10-stimulus trains at 1HZ, and
will record the subjects pain rating (0-100). Single pi[INVESTIGATOR_233388] 10 stimuli. The
mean pain rating of 10-stimulus trains divided by [CONTACT_233461] a
ratio. 100
Cold Pressor Testing and CPM:  A series of procedures designed to elicit and measure endogenous inhibition
of pain will be applied. In the present protocol, subjects will undergo a series of cold pressor tasks (i.e., the
conditioning stimuli) consisting of immersion of the hand for up to 1 minute in a circulating cold water bath. During
hand immersion, pressure responses or temporal summation will be re-assessed while subjects ’ hands remain in the
cold water. Subjects may remove their hand at any time. Two minutes after finishing the first immersion, subjects
will re-immerse their hand in the water, and one of these tests will be re-assessed, each separated by [ADDRESS_281802] 2 trials (the tests will be conducted in random order). A CPM Index  is quantified as the average
percent change (across trials) in PPTh or TS during the cold pressor tasks relative to baseline ratings [(PPTh or TS
during cold pressor/PPTh or TS prior to cold pressor)*100. [ADDRESS_281803] ’s tolerance is reached, with a 5-minute uninformed time limit.
Capsaicin :  Capsaicin sensitization procedures similar to well established protocols developed by [CONTACT_233462] 70 . Heat will be delivered using, a computer driven, peltier device, heating element
(Medoc TSA II). The procedure involves a 35 minute sensitization period (conducted during the baseline period)
with a 1.25inch 2  treatment site on the non-dominant, ventral forearm. The thermode will be heated to 45°C for 5
minutes and pain ratings will be collected every one minute on the 0-100 rating scale. An open square raised
adhesive frame (internal dimensions same as thermode, to reduce leakage beyond the site) will then be applied and
capsaicin cream (10%) 71  will be spread onto the skin and permitted to absorb for 30 minutes. This induces mild-
moderate (48.25+ 27.93), but well tolerated pain. Capsaicin is then removed and the heat pain threshold and
mechanical temporal summation (described above) will be conducted again in the area. The treated skin will be re-
kindled for each of the additional QST sessions each session by [CONTACT_233463] 40°C
for [ADDRESS_281804] stability in 2 o  hyperalgesia measurements over rekindlings 72;73;73  and the procedure
is ideal for including in paradigms with repeated testing as the rekindlings allow for rapid evaluation of capsaicin
sensitization (which typi[INVESTIGATOR_233389] 30min each).
Additional Study Measures:  Study measures comprise both pharmacologically and qualitatively nonspecific
measures (e.g., any drug effect) and qualitatively specific measures (e.g., liking, good effects, bad effects), that are
considered the gold standard method by [CONTACT_233464] (Com e r et  al ., 2012).
We will also conduct comprehensive neurocognitive testing, using a standard battery that is regularly used by [CONTACT_233465][INVESTIGATOR_233390].

6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.
Study Drugs : Hydromorphone and cannabidiol will be over-encapsulated by [CONTACT_233471].
Hydromorphone (Dialudid) is a potent mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_233395] b l e  [ADDRESS_281807] to differences in CYP                                                    ( o r a l )                       ( o r a l )
metabolic enzymes (in contrast to other opi[INVESTIGATOR_233396]) N on r a ndo m i z e d
and therefore will not require us to screen out individuals with
recent exposure to CYP inhibitors/inducers, or to
analyze/statistically control for CYP metabolic profiles. We have
selected a 4mg oral hydromorphone dose for this study because it is
the dose being administered in our companion studies
 5 0 m g  ( p l a c e bo ) 0 m g  ( p l a c e bo )
produces a mild-moderate effect (versus a ceiling or floor effect)           S e ss i on  [ADDRESS_281808] of hydromorphone.
Cannabidiol (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321]) has been strategically chosen for this study because it is a widely-used, commercially-
available Schedule V cannabinoid medication that is currently indicated for seizure control in persons with Lennox-
Gastaut syndrome and severe infantile myoclonic epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], but which could be prescribed off-label for the adjunctive
treatment of clinical pain. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233397]-approved formulation of cannabidiol and we are
proposing to administer it in doses of 50mg, 100mg, and 200mg . Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233398] 4500mg (133) . This dose range was selected to be consistent with those reported by a recent
review of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233399] (145)  and we prioritized doses on the lower end of the spectrum
to better visualize an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-enhancement effect (versus producing a strong cannabidiol-specific effect). Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233400], the BPRU pharmacy will prepare the dose and a flavor-matched
control for placebo dosing. A recent pharmacokinetic study reported that a 200mg dose of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_8321], administered
orally, reached peak concentrations in 2-[ADDRESS_281809]-pass metabolism via the CYP 1A1, 2D6, and 2C9 pathways, which yields an active metabolite (7-OH-
CBD). 7-OH-CBD is believed to contribute to cannabidiol ’s efficacy for seizure control and has a half-life of 13.3
hours, with no evidence of psychoactive effects (143) .

b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non-FDA approved
indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant populations are changed.
Hydromorphone: Hydromorphone hydrochloride is a pure mu opi[INVESTIGATOR_233401],
rectal, intramuscular (IM) or intravenous (IV) formulations for the indication of acute and/or chronic pain.
We have chosen to administer 4mg oral hydromorphone for the study sessions because we have ongoing
experience with this dose in another IRB approved study (PI [INVESTIGATOR_233402], IRB_00047423) and we have observed that it
produces the effect intended for investigation in this study; namely, that it produces a mild-moderate effect that will
better position this study to evaluate whether cannabidiol can increase or decrease drug effects.
Hydromorphone was strategically selected for this study as the exemplar opi[INVESTIGATOR_233403], or to analyze and statistically control for CYP metabolic
profiles in individual subjects. Further, in contrast to morphine, hydromorphone also does not produce a localized
adverse effect when administered IM. Both doses of hydromorphone are within the range that is commercially
available, which increases the clinical relevance and direct application of these study results into clinical practice,
and our data indicates 4mg oral hydromorphone will produce a moderate analgesic effect following pain testing. This
is an important feature because too strong a dose of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_233404]. By [CONTACT_20683] a dose of hydromorphone that produces a
moderate effect, we will be able to evaluate shifts in the analgesic curve that occur as a function of cannabidiol,
which will allow us to better determine the degree to which cannabidiol can augment the analgesic effect of
hydromorphone. There is also no apparent effect of gender on the pharmacokinetics of hydromorphone.
We have selected hydromorphone for this study because it is a prototypi[INVESTIGATOR_233405] a known safety
profile and because we have extensive experience administering this drug in oral preparations. We have selected a
mid-level dose because it is within the range of doses approved by [CONTACT_1622]. It is also sensitive to the QST tests we
have proposed, and we therefore believe it will provide an ideal opportunity to evaluate whether the curve of
hydromorphone is shifted as a function of cannabidiol administration.
Cannabidiol: Cannabidiol is a constituent of the cannabis plant that is being actively investigated for efficacy in a
wide range of potential indications (including anxiety and alcohol/substance use disorders, as evidenced by
[CONTACT_233472].gov entries) because of its unique pharmacological mechanisms of action. Specifically, it acts as an
inverse agonist on the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2, as a 5-HT1a agonist, as a positive modulator of the transient
receptor vallinoid-1 (TRPV1) receptor, and as an allosteric modulator of the mu and delta opi[INVESTIGATOR_8328] ( 137,  142 ).
We have proposed to examine cannabidiol in this study because of evidence from preclinical studies that it may
meaningfully shift the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-analgesic curve, and because it has good safety profile that suggests it may have real
potential for being widely used in real-world settings. Specifically, there is substantial preclinical evidence that
cannabidiol may interact meaningfully with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (134-136)  and the only empi[INVESTIGATOR_233406] 400 and 800mg can be safely coadministered with the highly potent opi[INVESTIGATOR_233407] (138)  and can reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_233408] (139) . Despi[INVESTIGATOR_233409] (140-141) , this outcome has not yet been
examined in humans. Finally, unlike some other cannabinoids, cannabidiol is believed to be relatively void of
euphoric and psychoactive effects, as evidenced by [CONTACT_233473] 750mg to 4500mg demonstrated little to no signal for abuse potential relative to alprazolam and
dronabinol comparators, and the 750mg dose (more than 3 times the upper dose proposed here) did not differ from
placebo on any measure (133) .
Capsaicin: 10% capsaicin topic cream will be applied as part of the standardized quantitative sensory testing battery.
This is a conventional pain testing technique. For application, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_233410], non-porous adhesive dressing with a
1.25inch 2  opening will be applied to the skin at the location of intended application. The area will be marked with a
pen or sharpie for later visualization. A 0.35g application of 10% capsaicin cream will be applied inside this opening
and evenly spread on the skin. The area will then covered by [CONTACT_233474] 30 minutes. Capsaicin will then be removed from the skin using alcohol
prep pads.

7. Study Statistics
a. Primary outcome variable:
·Primary Aim 1: The primary outcome will be the area under the curve of each QST procedure, which will
provide an assessment of the mean duration and magnitude of the drug effect. Primary outcomes will be tested with
repeated two-factor (Drug Condition x Time) models to examine main and interaction effects for all raw data as
designed. If there is large variation across subjects at the baseline timepoint, the raw data will be transformed as a
change from baseline and analyzed in drug condition by [CONTACT_164885]. Statistical analyses will be conducted using
multilevel analyses with an autoregressive covariance structure using SAS PROC MIXED Software [ADDRESS_281810] procedures will be as follows:
a. Heat Pain Threshold and Tolerance:  HPTh and HPTo in ºC (both in normal and capsaicin treated skin)
b. Pressure Pain Threshold:  PPTh in kilopascals
c. Thermal and Mechanical Temporal Summation : Verbal pain ratings (both in normal and capsaicin treated
skin for MTS)
d. Conditioned Pain Modulation:  The index score of CPM:PPTh and CPM:TS (compared to baseline) for each
dose
e. Cold Water Tolerance:  Time to tolerance (compared to baseline) for each dose.
· Primary Aim 2: The Drug vs. Money questionnaire will be compared across dose conditions, using peak
monetary rating for each dose as the primary outcome. Within-subject changes, as a function of dose, will be
analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).
· Primary Aim 3: Neurocognitive tests will be compared as a function of study drug dose, using study session
number (1-6) as a covariate to control for practice effects. Specific outcome measures will include:
a. Divided Attention Task (DAT):  Accuracy with which they perform the two tasks
b. Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST):  Accuracy, total number of patterns completed in allotted time
c. Computerized version of the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT) : Summed of correct trials
b. Secondary outcome variables.
Demographic and drug use characteristics, including a positive signal (defined as >[ADDRESS_281811] from Session 1), that are hypothesized a priori to be associated with outcomes (e.g., Body
Mass Index) will be compared across sex groups and significant differences will be included as covariates in the
subsequent analyses. All analyses will be repeated and sex (male/female) will be added as a factor to the analyses.
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and interim data analysis:
This power analysis is based upon a recently published paper that used methods similar to those proposed here and
is the only study published on the effect of combined cannabinoids (dronabinol) and opi[INVESTIGATOR_233411] (144) . Sample size estimates were premised with a power of 0.8, alpha =0.[ADDRESS_281812] sizes
(Cohen, 1988). Analyzing cold pressor outcomes of threshold and tolerance, those analyses suggested that a sample
size ranging from 10-[ADDRESS_281813] sizes for Aims 1-3 (Cohen ’s d = 1.1-1.4). Aim 4 is
a sex-comparison, for which we plan to double our enrollment levels to support. We are therefore proposing to
enroll 50 participants (25 men, 25 women) in order to achieve 40 study completers (20 men, 20 women). This
number is consistent with the number of participants enrolled in the aforementioned study (n=18), which did not
conduct a between-sex comparison (144) .

Not abiding by [CONTACT_233475], engaging in behaviors towards staff or other participants that are
abusive, or development of an intercurrent illness or condition (such as pregnancy) that changes the participants risk
may result in medical discharge from the study.
8. Risks
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major and minor risks and expected frequency.
a. Hydromorphone: Administration of any drug involves some risk because it is not always possible to predict
individual response to drugs. The most likely risk in this study is that subjects will experience side-effects of the
drugs that may be unpleasant. Common side effects of hydromorphone are light-headedness, dizziness, sedation,
nausea, vomiting, sweating, flushing, dysphoria, euphoria, dry mouth, and pruritus. Less frequently observed side
effects are weakness, headache, agitation, tremor, uncoordinated muscle movements, alterations of mood
(nervousness, apprehension, depression, floating feelings, dreams), muscle rigidity, paresthesia, muscle tremor,
blurred vision, nystagmus, diplopia and miosis, transient hallucinations and disorientation, visual disturbances,
insomnia, increased intracranial pressure, flushing of the face, chills, tachycardia, bradycardia, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], faintness,
syncope, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm and laryngospasm, constipation, biliary tract spasm, ileus,
anorexia, diarrhea, cramps, taste alteration, urinary retention or hesitancy, antidiuretic effects, urticaria, other skin
rashes and diaphoresis. Side effects of hydromorphone are generally temporary, dissipate within several hours, and
are dose-dependent. Thus, participants may only experience side-effects occasionally during the research study.
Serious potential adverse effects of hydromorphone administration that are possible but extremely unlikely to be
encountered in this study are respi[INVESTIGATOR_233412]. The FDA has identified the following
conditions as increasing the risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_233413]: patients with status asthmaticus; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; reduced respi[INVESTIGATOR_4806];
high blood pressure; impairment of hepatic, pulmonary or renal functions; myxedema or hyperthyroidism;
adrenocortical insufficiency; gall bladder disease; acute alcoholism; history of convulsive disorders; history of head
injury; currently taking sedatives, hypnotics or phenothiazines; and sulfite allergy. Mean exposure to hydromorphone
is also increased 4-fold among patients with hepatic impairment and 3-fold among patients with renal impairment.
Therefore, to further reduce the risk serious side effects, we will exclude any potential participant who exhibits one
or more of these conditions.
The most serious potential adverse event following hydromorphone administration is opi[INVESTIGATOR_233414], which is characterized by [CONTACT_15206][INVESTIGATOR_2341], somnolence progressing to stupor or coma, skeletal
muscle flaccidity, cold and clammy skin, constricted pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], and sometimes bradycardia and hypotension. In serious
overdosage, particularly following intravenous injection, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may
occur. We believe the risk of overdose in this study to be low for the following reasons: we have extensive
experience in the administration of hydromorphone, we have chosen doses that have been demonstrated to be safe
and tolerable in an identical participant population, we will exclude any individual who has a medical condition that
may increase the risk for respi[INVESTIGATOR_233415]/or other adverse events, all medication doses will be
administered by a trained research nurse, and participants will be monitored throughout the study session, up to [ADDRESS_281814] effects.
Hydromorphone has no known interactions with cannabidiol.
b. Cannabidiol: Cannabidiol has few contraindications. It should not be administered to persons with known
sensitivity to cannabidiol. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233416], therefore persons with moderate-severe
hepatic impairment (defined in the FDA product label as ALT or AST levels >3x ULN and/or Bilirubin levels >2x
ULN) who might have different plasma concentrations of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233417] a result of liver impairment will also be
excluded. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233418] 32% of patients (compared to 11%
of patients receiving placebo) and this may be further exacerbated in persons who are taking other CNS depressants.
The FDA also recommends that persons receiving any antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_32551], of which Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233419], be screened for
suicidal behaviors prior to beginning drug administration. Additional side effects reported in clinical trial
examinations of Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233420], diarrhea,
weight decrease, gastroenteritis, lethargy, fatigue/malaise, insomnia, irritability/agitation, drooling, gait disturbance,
rash, hypoxia, and infections. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233421]3A4 or CYP2C19
inhibitors or inducers, as these will change the plasma levels of cannabidiol. A determination of the safety of
cannabidiol during pregnancy has not yet been made.

c. Capsaicin : Capsaicin is the main ingredient in hot peppers, and is used as an over the counter drug for the
treatment of pain. The dose of capsaicin we are using is higher than what is available over the counter, although it is
less than half of the dose in a single habanera pepper. Capsaicin does cause pain, like a hot pepper may do when it is
eaten. Capsaicin may produce some local redness and swelling that will disappear within a day. The area of skin
where the capsaicin is applied could be sensitive for up to 48 hours. Capsaicin may cause a burning feeling in the
eyes or other areas of the body if accidentally rubbed onto other skin areas.
d. Chance That Participants May Begin Abusing Opi[INVESTIGATOR_233422]: There is a small but potential risk that exposing non-drug abusing individuals to doses of hydromorphone or
cannabinoids may elicit reinforcing effects that could precipi[INVESTIGATOR_233423]-use behavior. Enrolling non-drug
users into controlled laboratory studies is a conventional strategy that has been used extensively to evaluate the abuse
liability potential of numerous drugs of abuse both within our laboratory and by [CONTACT_164892].
e. Discomfort from Pain Testing: Participants will likely find the pain testing procedures uncomfortable for a brief
period of time. This effect is expected to be transient and to produce only mild levels of discomfort.
f. Breach of Confidentiality: Although staff members are highly trained to maintain participant confidentiality,
there is always a risk that some of the confidential information collected could be revealed to people who are not
involved in the research study. This could be embarrassing to the participant if the participant preferred to keep his or
her study participation secret, or if sensitive information became known to an individual outside the study. We have
an extensive history of conducting research among substance abusers and have instituted several practices to prevent
a breach from confidentiality from occurring (see below); thus, we believe this risk to be minimal.
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.
a. Protection Against Hydromorphone Risks: We have extensive experience in the administration of
hydromorphone and other opi[INVESTIGATOR_233424].
Any individual who may be prone to the risks associated with hydromorphone will be excluded from participating.
Although research staff and participants will be blinded to the exact medication provided, both groups will be
informed of the potential side effects and risks associated with the study drug administration. Participants will be free
to discontinue study participation at any time without consequence. The dose of hydromorphone that is being
administered is consistent with clinical care, and is a medium level dose for the treatment of pain. Further, The
Qualifying Session provides us a unique opportunity to assess for sensitivity to hydromorphone, and any participant
who shows intolerance to hydromorphone during the Qualifying Session will be excluded from the primary study.
Great care has been taken in selecting the appropriate drug doses to ensure hydromorphone is well-tolerated and safe
for our participants and participants will also be able to discontinue study participation at any time. The most serious
risk associated with hydromorphone administration is respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. We believe this risk is minimal in this
study for several reasons. First, we are administering a mid-level dose and have extensive experience administering
this dose at controlled levels in healthy controls. Second, we have developed several standard criteria that are
followed by [CONTACT_233476] a study
medication. All nursing and research staff are informed of these standards, and a list of these standards is posted in
each testing room. The standards are as follows: If respi[INVESTIGATOR_233425] 12 breaths/minute and is
accompanied by [CONTACT_164893], participants are prompted verbally to breath. In our experience, verbal and physical
stimulation is often sufficient to prompt breathing and restore a normal respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. If respi[INVESTIGATOR_233426]/or if oxygen saturation rates fall below 90% saturation, then patients are monitored carefully.
Specifically, they will be accompanied continuously by a medical and/or nursing staff member, evaluated by a staff
physician, and are given supplemental oxygen at 2L/min via a nasal cannula (available on site in the exam testing
room) if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_099]. If clinical evaluation determines that a participant ’s sedation level is
increasing, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_233427]. There have been very few incidents throughout our >[ADDRESS_281815] necessitated actual
intervention (oxygen and/or naloxone), however our equipment and medical/nursing staff is always prepared for this
possibility. We feel these procedures will sufficiently protect participants from possible adverse and serious adverse
events. In the unlikely event that a participant who is participating in a BPRU session or being housed at the CRU
requires medical assistance that is outside the scope of what can be provided by [CONTACT_233477], the study
team will contact [ADDRESS_281816] ambulance transport to the ER.
JHM I RB  e For m A  01
Vers i on  3  D ate d :  06 / [ADDRESS_281817] Cannabidiol Risks: The largest identified risk of cannabidiol is that chronic administration
can lead to elevated liver enzymes. This risk is recognized as being transient and readily reversible, and is unlikely to
happen in the current paradigm because only three acute doses will be administered. An additional risk is that
participants may experience a hypersensitivity to cannabidiol. To mitigate these risks, we will exclude participants
who endorse having previously experienced negative effects to cannabinoid products, or who have moderate-severe
hepatic impairment, as defined by [CONTACT_1622]-approved Epi[INVESTIGATOR_233428]. We will also conduct psychiatric screening
during the Screening session to ensure that patients with current or history of psychiatric events are excluded from
study participation. Further, all participants will be informed about the potential side effects of the study medications
and will be permitted to end study participation at any time if they experience negative events, with no consequences.
To protect against any persistent drug effects, we are providing participants with taxi service to and from the study
sessions and are budgeting for participants to stay the night at the CRU following study drug exposure if necessary.
Based on our previous experience, we expect this to be a rare occurrence but are prepared to make that option
available as needed.
c. Protection Against Risks That Participants May Begin Abusing Opi[INVESTIGATOR_233429] : Another concern is the possibility that exposure of participants with no histories of drug
abuse to drugs in our research setting might in some way increase the likelihood of these individuals to begin abusing
illicit drugs when they return to the community. The Johns Hopkins IRB closely monitors this issue, and has
repeatedly concluded that administering drugs that have reinforcing effects to individuals who do not abuse drugs is
not associated with an increased propensity to begin abusing drugs. Administering drugs that may have reinforcing
effects to non-dependent users has substantial precedent in laboratory examinations of drug effects, and we have a
rich and extensive history of utilizing this practice. Several research studies that have directly examined the
association between study-related drug administration and subsequent drug use behavior have failed to demonstrate
that controlled, laboratory drug exposure increases the risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_233430]. For example, authors
of a recent study that administered methamphetamine to a sample of non treatment-seeking drug abusers reported no
difference between-group differences in drug use behaviors, assessed via the Addiction Severity Index, at a 6-month
follow-up assessment [ADDRESS_281818], a recent study concluded that investigational administration of intravenous
cocaine to intravenous inexperienced cocaine users did not increase the risk of recreational intravenous use 128 .
Fourth, a study conducted by [CONTACT_233478]/or opi[INVESTIGATOR_233431], dollar amounts reported
spent for various drug classes, or any increases in Addiction Severity Index domain scores at a one month follow-
up129 . Finally, the College on the Problems of Drug Dependence, a prestigious international association of drug
dependence researchers, supports the practice of enrolling non treatment-seeking individuals into drug abuse liability
evaluation studies. Specifically, the College on Problems of Drug Dependence reported that exposure of drug abusers
to abused drugs in a controlled research setting does not enhance the desire of an individual to use drugs, worsen
addiction, or make addiction more difficult to treat [ADDRESS_281819] Risks of Discomfort from Pain Testing: It is likely that participants will experience some
acute and transient discomfort from the pain testing session, however we will work to mitigate that risk as much as
possible. First, participants will be informed of the pain testing procedure during the informed consent and will be
able to make an informed decision regarding their study participation. Second, we chose standardized pain tests that
are known to produce short-lived effects and thus are unlikely to produce any residual pain. Third, the measures rely
on the participant ending the pain testing procedure as an outcome measure, which means that all participants are
encouraged to remove themselves from the painful stimulus at any time and that they are in control of the magnitude
and duration of pain they experience. Fourth, we will enforce an upper limit on both pain measures to prevent any
tissue damage from occurring (e.g., hand cannot be in cold presser task for >150 seconds). Fifth, participants will be
informed that they can revoke their consent to participate in the pain testing at any time without penalty. Finally, the
JHM I RB  e For m A  01
Vers i on  3  D ate d :  06 / [ADDRESS_281820] Risks with Capsaicin: Capsaicin is being used to induce mild pain/discomfort and is
a primary outcome of the study. We will ensure that all participants are informed about the discomfort associated
with capsaicin so they may make an informed decision regarding their study participation. One of the primary risks
of capsaicin is that it could be accidentally transferred to another part of the body. To prevent this from happening,
we will make sure the exposure site is well-marked and that all residual topi[INVESTIGATOR_233432]. We will also be able to apply ice to the exposure site to reduce any
persistent discomfort associated with capsaicin.
f. Protection Against Risks Associated with Breach of Confidentiality: To protect confidentiality, all research
participants will be assigned unique participant identification codes that will be used on all study –related forms and
online websites. Documents that include the participants ’ full names (e.g., signed informed consent forms) will be
stored in an independent binder, consistent with FDA Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, and will be kept in a locked
room. Confidential information will never be shared with anyone outside of the research program without the explicit
written permission of the research participant. Only selected designated staff members will be approved to share
confidential information after explicit written permission is obtained from the participant and the participant will be
able to revoke written permission at any time. In accordance with IRB requirements, all research staff will be
formally trained in these procedures. No identifying participant information will be used in written reports,
manuscripts and/or conference presentations
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.
All adverse events will be reported to the IRB and other relevant agencies (e.g., FDA, NIDA) as required. The
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-investigators are responsible for reporting such events.
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.
Although there is always a small risk that confidentiality will be breached, we believe this risk to be very minimal
with the current study. It is possible that participants ’ urine samples may test positive for the study drugs for up to [ADDRESS_281821] on participants, we will inform
them of this potential risk in the ICF so they may make an informed decision regarding their participation despi[INVESTIGATOR_233433], and will provide any interested participants (who sign a release of information) with a letter
signed from the study investigator stating that their urine sample may be positive for drugs that can be considered
abusable for up to [ADDRESS_281822] empi[INVESTIGATOR_233434], using a
standardized quantitative sensory testing (comprehensive pain testing) battery. This information will advance the use
of cannabinoids from treatment-refractory conditions to more wide-spread use for pain treatment. A positive result
will provide new medication targets and will help lead efforts to reduce societal reliance upon opi[INVESTIGATOR_233435]. Reduced availability of opi[INVESTIGATOR_164843]/abuse and related problems (risky
injection behavior, opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211]).

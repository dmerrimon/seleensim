University of Louisville, Beth  Israel Deaconess Medical Center, University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_256598], and University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center  
 
Planned Number of Participants  
Approximately  258 participants  will be randomized  in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment  arms (129 
participants per arm): (1) Prednisone + Placebo for Anakinra/Zinc (2) Anakinra +  Zinc + Placebo 
for Prednisone .  
7  Objectives  
 
This multicenter, randomized, double blinded, placebo- controlled clinical trial is focused on novel 
treatments  for severe  alcoholic  hepatitis  (AH),  a life-threatening  stage  of alcoholic  liver injury  that has 
a short -term mortality rate much higher than that of other liver  diseases.  
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of Anakinra (plus 
zinc) compared to the current standard medical treatment consisting of prednisone in participants with clinical ly severe AH. Key secondary objectives broadly are as follows: (a) to evaluate the use of 
biomarkers to assess disease severity and treatment response; and (b) to develop novel endpoints to overcome the limitations of current assessment strategies for seve re AH.  
 
Overview of Study Design and Conduct  
 
The proposed study is a Phase 2b, multicenter, prospective, randomized, 2 -arm, double blinded, 
placebo -controlled clinical trial to assess the efficacy of Anakinra, an interleukin (IL) -[ADDRESS_311977] plus zinc compared to prednisone for the treatment of severe AH (Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score ≥ 20). All participants will receive standard care for treatment of severe AH as described in recent guidelines endorsed by [CONTACT_47315] (AASLD) and American Gastroenterological Association (AGA). The study will be conducted at 8 clinical sites across the United Stated selected by [CONTACT_256646] (NIAAA) and will be supported by a Data Coordinating Center at Indiana University (DCC -IU). The biorepository will be managed by [CONTACT_256647].  
 
The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in compliance with local, state,  and federal regulatory requirements. Adverse events during the course of the trial will 
be identified, recorded, assessed for causality , and reported  in accordance with FDA guidance. In 
addition to general  assessment,  we will specifically  focus on (1) rates and types  of infection  as well as 
their severity,  (2) potential  development  of drug-induced  liver injury,  (3) injection  site reactions,  and 
(4) hematological adverse  events.  
 
This study will be approved by [CONTACT_256648], Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB), and will be monitored by [CONTACT_256649] (DSMB).  We will conduct  this study  under  an Investigational  New Drug  (IND)  application  from  the 
[LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
[ADDRESS_311978] of 
care for severe AH includes attention to early 
diagnosis and treatment of bacterial and fungal infections, portal hypertension and its complications including acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid overload (ascites and edema) and hepatic 
encephalopathy.  
In addition, all participants will be offered as part of the standard of care, non-  pharmacologic 
intervention for treatment of alcohol use disorders, such as cognitive behavioral therapy and [ADDRESS_311979]  care. 
 
During the initial six months of trial, the investigators will develop a “manual of clinical operations” that will include best practices on the use of vasopressors, albumin, ICU care, mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy using Surviving Sepsis Campaign, International Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock. The investigators will also provide best practices for management of nutrition and alcoho l counseling and minimization of recidivism. Although the 
management of these complications will not be mandated by [CONTACT_990], the care provided will be recorded to develop novel designs for future trials and for practice guidance and quality improvement programs.  
 
After informed consent has been obtained and all of the inclusion are met and none of the exclusion,  participants  will be randomized  to receive  one of the following  interventions  in addition  to 
standard  care. 

9  Group 1 : Standard of care plus prednisone 40 mg orally once daily  on Days 1 -30 and matching 
placebos for Anakinra (1 syringe  s.c. once daily on Days 1 -14), and zinc (matched pi[INVESTIGATOR_256599] 1 -90). 
Group  2: Standard  of care plus Anakinra  (100 mg s.c.) once daily on Days 1 -14 zinc sulfate 220 mg once 
daily on Days 1 -90, and placebo for prednisone (matched pi[INVESTIGATOR_256600] 1 -30). 
Lille score will be calculated from day 7 labs, participants will stop prednisone or prednisone 
placebo if Lille score >0.45.  
 
Figure 1. Distribution of study drug and placebo  
 
 
Participants or guardian will be instructed in subcutaneous injection techni que to continue self - 
administration  of these  experimental  treatments  after discharge  from  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Study  personnel  will 
ensure participants and guardian are proficient in the technique before the end of study visit and an instructional document will be  provided.  

10  Primary and Important Secondary Endpoints  
 
Primary Endpoints  Survival at 90 days  
 
 
Secondary Endpoints 
• Changes in score(s): Changes in Lille score, change in MELD score, development of 
AKI, multi- organ failure, SIRS, transfer to ICU, changes in liver function will all be 
evaluated at 7, 30 and 90  days.  
• Organ dysfunction: Measure of changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment 
(SOFA) scores and proportions requiring hemodynamic support for MAP < 65 mm Hg and lactate >  2 mmol/l, renal replacement therapy or mechanical ventilation. The 
SOFA score will be modified and re -evaluated without platelet counts given that these 
are usually low in  AH. 
• Infections and Sepsis: The endpoints and case definitions related to sepsis may vary 
depending on what will be used (clinical care, research, surveillance or quality improvement). Given the central role of sepsis as a driver of outcomes, measuring the types  of infection  will occur  but also identify  the proportions of those with sepsis, septic 
shock or quick- SOFA (qSOFA) criteria based on SEPSIS -3 guidance
2,3. Key parameters 
will be captured and needed for various sepsis related endpoint construction aligned by [CONTACT_256650] (http://eddh-  
cro.wixsite.com/fdtsfv).  
• Renal dysfunction: In alignment with guidance from the acute disease quality initiative, the AKI development  will be quantified  and its progression through persistent AKI,  acute 
kidney disease to chronic kidney disease.  
• Need for care escalation: Proportion of participants requiring transfer to ICU for care, intubation for airway control, need for ventilator support or  RRT. 
• Indicators of gut permeability: (endotoxin and bacterial 18S DNA) and pro - 
inflammatory  cytokine/chemokines  (TNFa,  MCP1,  IL-6, IL-1ß) will be assessed in 
serum/plasma samples.  
• Survival at [ADDRESS_311980]  to disease severity,  end organ  involvement  and the care they receive.  Moreover,  as in sepsis and 
heart  failure,  death  involves  failure  of multiple  organs (liver, heart,  kidney,  lungs) making  it difficult  to 
ascertain which one is the primary cause of death. This has led to development and regulatory 
acceptance  of composite endpoints including mortality  and key parameters  driving  mortality  for acute 
heart failure trials. These guiding principles to construct a novel and innovative key secondary 
composite endpoint which  will include death  or worsening of the modified  SOFA  score4,5 by ≥2 points 
and worsening of MELD  score by ≥[ADDRESS_311981]  mortality  to further  optimize 
this endpoint and cross- validate it in the observation cohort will  occur.  
11   
Novel (experimental) endpoints to overcome limitations of conventional endpoints Efficacy  
endpoints must capture “clinically meaningfu l benefit”. While traditional endpoints such as mortality 
are meaningful, they also have multiple shortcomings in the context of AH as noted below.  
Innovation will be used to construct, measure , and validate novel additional endpoints to overcome 
the limit ations of currently used endpoints and cross- validate them in the observational cohort. The 
combined expertise in endpoint development and the use of harmonized measurements will make 
this feasible. These will provide novel assessments in AH and provide the scientific evidence -base to 
use these as primary endpoints in future trials.

This will be optimized by: (1) GCP training and certification of all study personnel, (2) investigator/coordinator training and certification prior to site activation, (3) monthly performance 
reports, (4) development of manual of operations that provide best practices, and (5) annual 
investigator meeting to review developments and clinical and trial practice patterns. (6) DSMB will convene every [ADDRESS_311986] cycle of funding. Eligible participants will be identified based 
on inclusion/exclusion criteria as defined above. 
 
 
 
Enrollment sites  
 
Enrollment sites will be limited to the 8 clinical sites selected during the competitive renewal of the 
U01 study for treatment of acute AH. These enrollment sites include: Indiana University School of 
Medicine affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256604], Indiana (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124].  Kavish Patidar ), University of 
Louisville affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256605], Kentucky (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Craig McClain) , Beth Israel Deaconess  
Medical Center in [LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_005]  (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Gyongyi Szabo), Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster, 
Minnesota (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Vijay Shah and Patrick Kamath), Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Cleveland, Ohio (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Srinivasan Dasarathy), University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_256596], Pennsylvania (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ramon Bataller), University of [LOCATION_007] Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, [LOCATION_007] (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Mack Mitchell), and Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Arun Sanyal). Each site will be permitted to use more than one hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256606]/exclusion criteria.  
 
Expected enrollment per site : 32-33 severe AH participants  
 
Central IRB : The DCC- IU with WIRB as the central I RB for this study. This will require that IRBs 
from all [ADDRESS_311987]. The experiment -wise significance leve l will be 5%. 
The most recent data from the AlcHepNet consortium suggest a 90- day mortality rate for 
prednisone is approximately  20%. We estimate that with a total of 258 participants (1 29 per 
treatment arm), we will be able to detect a clinically significant hazards ratio of 0.325, which 
translates to a 13% reduction in 90 -day mortality , i.e., 80 % survival in prednisone vs 93% in 
anakinra plus zinc groups with 8 5% power by [CONTACT_256653] -sided logrank tests.  We use O’Brien and 
Fleming α -spending function to determine the efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256607]. 
Specifically, if the test statistics of the log -rank test is greater than 2.[ADDRESS_311988]  an early stopp ing rule for futility based on 
conditional power. At the time of interim analysis, we will calculate the conditional power, i.e., the 
probability of claiming difference at the end of the trial given the data at the interim analysis. We will 
stop the trial for futility when the conditional power is less than 0.1. In other words, based on data that become available at the interim analysis, assuming that the current trend continues, we should 
17  early stop the trial if the probability of declaring anakinra + zinc  superior in the final analysis is low 
(e.g., less than 10%). We use this early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256608] a potentially 
inefficacious treatment.  
 
 
Group Assignment  
Participants will be randomized to the two  treatment groups with matching placebos for drugs in 
the other arm, in equal proportions. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_256654]. 
Random blocks of size 4 will be generated  to ensure treatment assignments are balanced between 
the two treatment arms within each block. Both participants , coordinators, and investigators will be 
blinded to the randomization plans. 
 
Statistical Analyses  
The primary analyses of 90 -day mortality wi ll be performed in an  Intention -to-Treat (ITT) 
framework  using survival analysis . Specifically,  
 
(1) we will use all -cause mortality in the first [ADDRESS_311989] an analysis of the restricted mean survival time (RMST) of the first 90 days.  
(2) as a secondary analysis, we will compare transplant -free survival in the first [ADDRESS_311990] analyses as appropriate. 
(3) we plan to conduct one interim analysis and one final analysis for this trial. The interim analysis 
will be conducted when 129 patients, half of  the enrollment number, complete the 90 -day 
follow-up. We use the group sequential method to control the type 1 error rate of the trial. 
(4)  as another secondary analysis, we will examine the treatment effects in patients with baseline 
MELD scores ≤ 25 and >[ADDRESS_311991] Participation Duration  
 
180 days  
Recruitment and Retention Plan  
 
Sources of participants: 
Identification of participants with severe AH requires collaboration with those physicians who manage these participants within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256609]. Almost 100% of participants are admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256610]. Occasionally participants are seen in free -standing urgent care centers, free -standing emergency rooms or in 
office/clinic practices. Since the standard of care is to admit these participants for further evaluation to exclude infections as a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_256611], most will ultimately be identified in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Letters will also be sent to referring MDs and referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
[ADDRESS_311992] in participating in a clinical trial as part of the treatment of the underlying AH. Once the participant expresses willingness to be contact[CONTACT_256655].  
 
Management of barriers for recruitment:  
Special conferences with medicine, ICU and ER staff will increase awareness of the trial , and  its 
significance . Contact [CONTACT_256656]. For those who live at a distance, travel costs will be budgeted in alignment with local practices  for other trials. 
 
Contingency plans: 
Recruitment will be tracked with monthly review of expected versus actual enrollment. Screen fail rates will also be assessed. There will be direct communication between DCC -IU, NIAAA and study 
leadership with site -PI [INVESTIGATOR_256612]/implement solutions. Best practices from high- performing sites will be shared with the 
under-performing sites. For continued failure, the site budgets will be cut,  and funds redirected 
towards supporting enrollment at high performing sites after discussion with NIAAA project officer.  
  
19   
Retention plan: 
It is anticipated that some participants will drop out after the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. This will be 
minimized by [CONTACT_256657], frequent communication by [CONTACT_256658]. Travel support will be provided when needed. 
 
Competition from other trials:  
The participating clinical centers will not engage in other trials for AH that have similar eligibility criteria for the duration of the trial . 
Safeguards : 
Each clinical center will establish safeguards for vulnerable population s, especially institutional 
employees,  and the ir familie s, in close collaboration with their institutional review boards.

indications. FDA-approved labeling is included in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1. Anakinra is indicated for reduction in signs and symptoms and slowing the progression of 
structural damage in moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. It has been previously 
studied in AH7. 
2. Zinc-sulfate  is a nutritional supplement. Zinc supplementation reverses the clinical signs of zinc 
deficiency in participants with alcoholic liver  disease.  
3. Prednisone is indicated  for numerous conditions including inflammatory  disease.  Corticosteroids, 
such as prednisolone, are considered standard of care in alcoholic liver  disease.  
 
2.1.[ADDRESS_311997] not 
been withdrawn.  
 
2.1.3 Pharmacology and Toxicology Information  
Drug Interactions : 
 
There are no drug interactions listed in MicroMedex or PubMed with the other agents given 
concurrently in the protocol –Anakinra + zinc sulfate (current as of 23 Jan 2019). Prednisone is given as the single study agent in arm 1. The investigator at each site will check for drug 
interactions between study drugs and other concurrent medications for each participant.  
23  2.2 Rationale for Trial Design and Dose for Study  Medication 
2.2.1 Study  Rationale:  
Severe AH continues to be associated with a high mortalit y and represents a significant public health 
burden8-13. Prednisone is the standard of care but is associated with a modest and transient survival 
benefit at best and increased risk of severe bacterial and fungal infections14-16. A recent large study 
indic ated that pentoxifylline is not significantly superior to placebo15. While several new targets are 
being evaluated, they are not sufficiently powered to provide definitive data. There is therefore a 
need for well -designed, appropriately powered efficacy (p hase 2B or 3) trials to define the utility of 
newer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256614].  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_311998] of care for severe Acute Alcoholic 
Hepatitis  (AAH):  
 
Corticosteroid therapy is recommended by [CONTACT_256663], defined by [CONTACT_256664] > 32 
based on Class I, level A evidence1. Participants with DF < [ADDRESS_311999] six -month survival of > 85% 
whereas those with DF > [ADDRESS_312000] a survival of only 60%. Almost all trials of corticosteroids have 
treated participants for [ADDRESS_312001] 30 days in some participants treated with steroids. Tapering the dose of steroids (median of 15 days) after 50% improvement in  total bilirubin and prothrombin time combined with enteral nutrition reduced the 
risk of late infections
17. The investigators postulated that the benefit of enteral nutrition was 
mediated through improvement in integrity of the gut mucosal barrier and red uced gut bacterial 
translocation and  endotoxemia.  
 
Early improvement in bilirubin within the first week is predictive of a good response to 
corticosteroids at 28 days18. Although corticosteroids improve survival in a subset of participants 
with severe AAH,  some participants do not respond, either because of steroid “resistance” or due to 
the underlying severity of the disease. Steroids are not well tolerated in participants with active GI 
bleeding or systemic  infections.  
 
Corticosteroids represent a clinically tested treatment for severe AH and will be offered to a third of 
the participants in this randomized clinical trial.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_312002] 
treatment (Prednisone in Arm 2): 
 
There are  currently no new drugs formally approved by [CONTACT_256665]. The rationale to 
repurpose already available agents for AH treatment is to generate evidence to support moving to pi[INVESTIGATOR_256615] -label use of t hese compounds and thus 
provide much needed benefit to those with severe AH.  
24  2.2.4 Clinical applications of anakinra:  
Preliminary data from the interim analysis of the ongoing clinical trial from the Defeat Alcoholic 
Steatohepatitis (DASH) UO1 consortium suggests that the treatment arm with anakinra plus 
pentoxiphylline plus zinc may provide better survival at day 90 and 180 compared to the steroid 
treated group. Side effects including infection rates were comparable between the anakinra and steroid arms.  
 
Anakinra blocks the effects of IL -1 by [CONTACT_256666] -1ß and IL -1α to the IL -1 
receptor. It is FDA -approved for treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) since 
2001, and is used also in patients with Still's disease, and in familial cold autoinflammatory and 
Muckle -Wells syndromes20-22. 
 
Anakinra has an excellent safety profile compared to ot her biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The rate of serious 
infections was 3.2 per 100 participant -years in participants exposed to Anakinra23. A meta -analysis of 
trials evaluating anakinra in RA reported a 1.4% incidence of serious infections with anakinra, 
compared wi th 0.5% with placebo, although this difference was not significant after adjustment for 
underlying comorbidities24. This is important given that participants with severe AH are prone to 
bacterial infections. No adverse reactions or microbial superinfections were attributable to anakinra 
treatment in participants with severe sepsis25. Other FDA approved drug candidates for inhibiting 
IL- 1 are canakinumab and rilonacept26,27, that are human monoclonal antibodies and both target IL - 
1ß (and not IL -1α). The advantage of anakinra is that it prevents both IL -1ß and IL -1α effects. An 
additional advantage of the anakinra is its short half -life for participants with alcoholic liver disease 
given the concern of susceptibility to infections in this parti cipant population.  
Anakinra, a human recombinant IL -[ADDRESS_312003] in concert to activate the 
multiprotein complex, NLRP3 inflammasome, that results in activation for IL -1ß secretion via 
caspase -1/pro- IL-1ß cleavage32,33. The biological signif icance of increased IL -1ß production extends 
beyond the direct pro -inflammatory effects of IL -1ß29. IL1ß, after engaging the IL- [ADDRESS_312004] (IL -1ra). Testing of the IL -[ADDRESS_312005], 
anakinra, in mice fed with the Lieber -DeCarli alcohol or control diet for 4 weeks revealed that 
alcohol -induced increase in serum ALT,  liver steatosis and upregulated inflammatory cytokine 
production (TNFα, pro -IL-1β, mature IL -1β) were all significantly reduced by [CONTACT_8668] -1ra administration . 
25  (Fig 1)30. 
 
 
 
2.2.5 Clinical applications of Zinc  supplementation: 
Zinc is an essential trace element required for normal cell growth, development, and 
differentiation36. It is a critical component of many proteins/enzymes, including zinc - dependent 
transcription factors. Importantly, oxidative stress (e.g., resulting from ethanol metabolism) may 
cause release of zinc from critical zinc -finger proteins and subsequent loss of DNA- binding activity 
and function36. Zinc deficiency/altered zinc metabolism is regularly observed in people with AH and 
may result from decreased dietary intake, increased urinary excretion, abnormal activation of certain 
zinc transporters, and induction of hepatic metallothionein37. Zinc deficiency has been shown to 
cause/exacerbate gut barrier dysfunction, endotoxemia, increased proinflammatory cytokine 
production, oxidative stress, decreased zinc finger function, and hepatocyte steatosis/injury/death in 
experimental ALD36,38- 51. Similarly, zinc supplementation improved experimental ALD, in part, by 
[CONTACT_256667], reducing endotoxemia, lowering levels of metabolic toxins such as 
ammonia, decreasing production of pro- inflammatory cytokines, reducing oxidative stress, and 
attenuating hepatocyte steatosis/injury/death . (Figure 2) 36,38-51. 

[ADDRESS_312006] generally shown similar mechanistic beneficial effects 
of zinc (Figure 2 -unpublished data). The dose of zinc used for treatment of ALD usually is [ADDRESS_312007] of nausea. This clinical trial will use zinc supplementation to inhibit multiple mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis/progression 
of AAH and possibly other organ failure, beginning with intestinal barrier dysfunction (Figure 2).  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_312008]  Statement:  
The proposed trial will provide definitive evidence of the safety and efficacy of Anakinra plus zinc vs prednisone in severe AH; if positive, it will change the standard of care for severe AH and, if 
negative, it will discourage their off label  use thereby [CONTACT_256668]. In either case, the proposed study will alter how participants with severe AH are managed.

[ADDRESS_312009] treatment with Prednisone in the treatment of severe AH.  
 
Primary Endpoint  
• Survival at 90 days.  
Secondary Endpoints  
• Change in Lille score,  change  in MELD  score,  development  of AKI,  multi -organ  failure,  SIRS, 
transfer  to ICU, changes  in liver function will all be evaluated  at 7, 30 and 90 days.  
• Organ dysfunction: Changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores and 
proportions requiring hemodynamic support for MAP < 65 mm Hg and lactate > 2  mmol/l, 
renal replacement therapy or mechanical ventilation. We will also modify and re -evaluate the 
SOFA score without platelet counts given that these are usually low in  AH. 
• Infections and Sepsis: It is now recognized that the endpoints and case definitions related to 
sepsis may vary depending on what these will be used for (clinical care, research, surveillance , or 
quality improvement). Given the central role of sepsis as a driver of outcomes, we will not only measure  the types  of infection  but also identify  the proportions of those with sepsis, septic  shock 
or quick- SOFA (qSOFA) criteria based on SEPSIS -3 guidance
2,3. Capturing the key parameters 
needed for various sepsis rel ated endpoint construction aligned by [CONTACT_256669] (http://eddh- cro.wixsite.com/fdtsfv).  
• Renal  dysfunction:  In alignment  with guidance from  the acute  disease quality initiative, we will 
quantify AKI development and its progression through persistent AKI, acute kidney disease to chronic kidney disease.  
• Need  for care escalation:  Proportion of participants  requiring transfer  to ICU for care. 
• Indicators of gut: Permeability (endotoxin and bacterial 18S DNA) and pro - inflammatory 
cytokine/chemokines (TNFa, MCP1, IL -6, IL-1ß) will be assessed in serum/plasma samples. 
• Survival at 30 and 180 days.  
 
Limitations of mortality as an endpoint in AH and plans to overcome these:  
All-cause mortality is most relevant when mortality is substantial and attributable to a single 
mechanism in a homogeneous population. Participants with severe AH are highly heterogeneous 
with respect to disease severity, end organ involvement and the care they receive. Moreover, as in 
sepsis and heart failure, death involves failure of multiple organs (liver, heart, kidney, lungs) making it difficult to ascertain which one is the primary cause of death. This has led to development and regulatory acceptance of composite endpoints including mortality and key parameters driving mortality for acute heart failure trials. We will leverage these guiding principles to construct a novel 
and innovative key secondary composite endpoint whi ch will include death or worsening of the 
SOFA score
4,5 by ≥2 points and worsening of MELD score by ≥[ADDRESS_312010] mortality to further optimize this endp oint and cross- validate it in the 
observation cohort.  
 
Novel (experimental) endpoints to overcome limitations of conventional endpoints Efficacy 
endpoints must capture “clinically meaningful benefit”. While traditional endpoints such as mortality are meani ngful, they also have multiple shortcomings in the context of AH as noted below. We will 
therefore innovate to construct, measure and validate novel additional endpoints to overcome the limitations of currently used endpoints and cross- validate them in the  observational cohort. Our 
combined expertise in endpoint development and the use of harmonized measurements will make this feasible. These will provide novel assessments in AH and provide the scientific evidence -base to 
use these as primary endpoints in f uture trials.  
4. INVESTIGATIONAL  PLAN  
4.[ADDRESS_312011] plus 
zinc compared  to prednisone  for the treatment  of severe  AH (Model  for End Stage  Liver Disease 
(MELD) score ≥ 20). All participants will receive standard care for treatment of severe AH as 
described in recent guidelines endorsed by [CONTACT_256670]1. The study will be conducted at 8 
clinical sites across the United Stated selected by [CONTACT_256671] a Data 
Coordinating Center (DCC- IU) at Indiana  University . 
 
The study will be conducted according to good clinical practice (GCP) and in compliance with local, 
state, and federal regulatory requirements. Adverse events during the course of the trial will be 
identified, recorded, assessed for causality , and reported in accordance with FDA guidance. In 
addition to general assessment, we will specifically focus on (1) rates and types of infection as well as their severity, (2) potential development of drug -induced liver injury, (3) injection site reactions , and  
(4) hematological adverse events. These are related to the mechanisms of action of the drugs to be tested.  
 
It is anticipated that this study will be approved by [CONTACT_256672]. We will conduct this study under an Investigational New Drug (IND) application from the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
It is anticipated that a centrally located investigational pharmacy locat ed at Indiana University will 
dispense the study medications to all participating sites under close coordination from the DCC-  IU. 
Anakinra plus zinc and prednisone and matching placebos will be provided by [CONTACT_256673].  
 
Interventions to be tested  
 
Concomitant treatments in this trial include standard care for severe AH for all participants as recommended in recent guidelines. The standard of care for severe AH includes attention to early diagnosis and treatment of bacterial and fungal inf ections, portal hypertension and its complications 
including acute kidney injury, gastrointestinal bleeding, fluid overload (ascites and edema) and hepatic encephalopathy. As part of the standard of care, all participants will be offered non - 
[ADDRESS_312012]  care. 
 
During the initial six months of trial, the investigators will develop a “manual of clinical operations” that will include best pract ices on the use of vasopressors, albumin, ICU care, mechanical ventilation 
and renal replacement therapy using Surviving Sepsis Campaign, International Guidelines for 
Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock. The investigators will also provide best pr actices for 
management of nutrition and alcohol counseling and minimization of recidivism. Although the management of these complications will not be mandated by [CONTACT_990], the care provided will be recorded to develop novel designs for future trials and for practice guidance and quality improvement 
programs.  
 
After  ensuring  that participants  meet  all of the inclusion criteria and none  of the exclusion criteria,  and 
after the informed consent has been obtained participants will be randomized to receive one of the 
following interventions in addition to standard care. 
 
Group 1 : Standard of care plus prednisone (40 mg orally) once daily on Days 1 -30 and matching 
placebos for Anakinra (1 syringe s.c. once daily on Days 1 -14) and zinc (matched pi[INVESTIGATOR_256616] 1 -90). 
Group  2: Standard  of care plus Anakinra  (100 mg s.c.) once daily  on Days  1-14, zinc sulfate 220 mg 
once daily on Days 1 -90, and placebo for prednisone (matched pi[INVESTIGATOR_256600] 1 -30).  
Lille score will be calculated from day 7 labs, participants will stop prednisone or prednisone 
placebo if Lille score >0.45.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_312013] and good clinical practice (GCP)  
 
Variations in protocol implementation and clinical care can have a major impact on trial outcomes. 
This will be optimized by: (1) GCP training and certification of all study personnel, (2) investigator/coordinator training and certification  prior to site activation, (3) monthly performance 
reports, (4) development of manual of operations that provide best practices and study procedures 
to follow, and (5) annual investigator meeting to review developments and clinical and trial practice 
patte rns.

38  5.2 Participant Compensation and  Recruitment  
5.3.1 Participant  Compensation  
Participant compensation is site  specific.  
 
5.3.2 Participant  Recruitment  
Sources of participants: 
Identification of participants with severe AH requires collaboration with those physicians who 
manage these participants within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256609]. Almost 100% of  
participants are admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256610]. Occasionally  
participants are seen in free -standing urgent care centers, free -standing emergency rooms or in  
office/clinic practices. Since the standard of care is to admit these participants for further evaluation  
to exclude infections as a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_256618], most will ultimately be  
identified in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]. Letters will also be sent to referring MDs and referring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
 
Some sites in the current U01 have found that screening laboratory results for elevated AST and  
total bilirubin is a useful way to identify potential participants. In accordance with Institutional  
Review Board Policies, once identified the primary team caring for these participants must be  
contact[CONTACT_256676]  
a clinical trial as part of the treatment of the underlying AH. Once the participant expresses  
willingness to be contact[CONTACT_256677].  
 
5.4.1 Individual Drug Discontinuation Criteria Reasons for Mandatory Trial Hold – Infection  
If one of the following criteria is met, the study drugs should be held for 3 days:  
1. Documented  Infection  
• Pneumonia defined as new infiltrate by [CONTACT_256678] 
• Positive cultures (blood, ascites) for bacteria or  fungus 
• Positive fungal cultures in urine (> 50,000 colonies/ml )  
• CNS infection defined as positive cultures or WBC > 5 in CSF 
• Severe soft tissue or bone infections including clinical diagnosis of  cellulitis  
 
2. SIRS (defined as two or more abnormalities in temperature, increased heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], or white blood cell count) with increase in SOFA score ≥[ADDRESS_312019] day of the study drugs hold: If infection clears and 
participant stabilizes, study drugs will be resumed. 
 
For participants with documented infection: If infection is responsive to antibiotics and participant is stabilized or improved, study drugs may be resumed at the discretion of the clinical care team. If there is no improvement after 3 days, study drugs will be stopped  
39  For participants meeting only SOFA+SIRS (#2 above)  criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: if cultures of urine, 
blood, ascites, stool (including C. diff) are negative and CXR is unchanged, study drugs may be 
resumed at the discretion of the clinical care team.   
If the participant has a second hold of study drugs due to infection/SIRS +SOFA  criteria, study 
drugs will be stopped. 
 
5.4.2 Reasons for Mandatory Trial  Discontinuation  
1. Persistent  infection:  a) Participants  with documented  infection  will be reassessed  on 3rd day of 
the study drugs hold. If infection is responsive to antibiotics and participant is stabilized or 
improved, study drugs may be resumed at the discretion of the clinical care team. If there is no 
improvement after 3 days, study drugs will be stopped. b) For participants meeting only SOFA +SIRS cr iteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: if cultures of urine, blood, ascites, stool (including C. diff) are 
negative and CXR is unchanged, study drugs may be resumed at the discretion of the clinical 
care team. c) If the participant has a 2
nd hold of study drugs due to infec tion/ SOFA +SIRS 
criteria, study drugs will be stopped.  
 
2. Pregnancy: If a female participant becomes pregnant, she must stop taking study 
medication and must be withdrawn from the trial. The participant must be followed by [CONTACT_256679]. The mother (and infant) will be followed as considered appropriate by [CONTACT_256680] ([CONTACT_256722] or 
his designee).  For reporting purposes, pregnancy  is not considered a serious adverse  event  (SAE).  
 
3. Clinical deterioration: During the trial, if Maddrey’s Discriminant Factor (DF) increases by 5 
points and also exceeds 32, or MELD scores increases by 5 points and also exceeds 20, the study 
medication should be stopped, however the participant will remain  in the trial, completing 
procedures as detailed in the Schedule of Procedures (Table 1). The study drugs will also be 
stopped if severe  leukocytosis  (≥100,000/mm3)  develops. Treating  physicians may offer any other 
treatment  that is considered as medically  indicated  and appropriate.  
 
4. Suspected drug induced liver injury (DILI): Hold the study drug if MELD increases by 5 from baseline or Child’s score increases by 3 points from baseline plus >3- fold increase in ALT 
from baseline on two consecutive occasions. These instances may represent either lack of 
therapeutic efficacy or DILI or some other etiology. If there is a competing etiology and DILI 
can be excluded, study drug can be resumed within 3 -4 days. However, if DILI cannot be 
excluded, then the s tudy drug will be permanently discontinued. Additional reasons for study 
drug discontinuation include unexplained elevation in ALT > 5 x baseline or > 500 U/L on two consecutive occasions or unexplained elevation in Alk P > 3 x baseline or >500 U/L on two 
consecutive occasions. It should be noted that cholestatic DILI may have a devastating impact on 
participant survival in individuals with advanced liver  disease.  
 
5. Lille score : Participants in either arm who have a Lille score of >0 .45 on day 7 will stop bottle 
1(prednisone/ placebo) and will continue with bottle 2 (zinc/zinc placebo.) 
 
40  a) Other Reasons for Trial or Treatment  Discontinuation  
The following events are considered appropriate reasons for a participant to discontinue from the 
trial: 
• The participant  withdraws  consent  or requests  to be withdrawn  from  the trial. It is fully 
understood that all participants volunteer for the trial and that they may withdraw their 
consent at any  time.  
• The participant experiences an adverse event that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_256619] (i.e., study designated physician, [CONTACT_256722]) is caused 
by [CONTACT_256681],  of sufficient  intensity  
to warrant discontinuation . 
• The participant refuses to comply with the requirements for  trial participation.  
• Termination of the trial due to DILI concerns: The Data Safety and Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) should carefully  monitor  the number  of discontinuations due to MELD/Child’s Score  
worsening  in three treatment groups. Since this trial is not powered for rare adverse events, 
one should not look for statistically significant imbalance among treatment groups, but the DSMB should consider numerical imbalances that its members deem clinically significant. While it may be straight forward in some instances (for example, 2 discontinuations in groups 
A but 5 discontinuations in group B) but in other instances it may not be as clear cut and one 
may continue the trial for a g rowing trend. In any case, the DSMB is advisory in nature,  and it 
makes a recommendation to the Sponsor, NIAAA. In addition to seeking the AlcHepNet Steering Committee input, the NIAAA may seek external input to assist in its deliberation if 
the DSMB recommends that the clinical trial must be terminated due to safety  concerns.  
 
When possible, the investigator should discuss the potential discontinuation of a participant with the 
study designated physician ([CONTACT_256722] or his designee) in advance.  
 
b) Participant Discontinuation  Notification  
 
The investigator must notify the study designated physician ([CONTACT_256722] or his designee) as soon as 
possible if any participant prematurely discontinues from the trial. The date when the participant is withdrawn and the pr imary reason for discontinuation must be recorded in the CRF; additional 
information may be requested to complete a discontinuation narrative. Participants will be considered “lost to follow up” only after reasonable, documented attempts to reach the parti cipant 
prove unsuccessful. In all cases, a reasonable effort must be made to determine the reason(s) that a 
participant fails to return for required trial visits or discontinues from the trial.  
 
If a participant stays in the study but discontinues study medication (either by [CONTACT_3445]’s choice, or by [CONTACT_093]’s decision), then study measurements should be performed according to the 
Schedule of Trial Procedures, Table 1 (rather than expediting study visits, or measurements).  
Patients will be followed until the final evolution (stability, worsening, or resolution) of the event 
that invoked drug discontinuation and followed until the end of the trial, if they are willing to do so.

44  6.4 Dose, Administration and  Blinding  
Two treatment groups will be evaluated in the trial: 1) Prednisone,  and 2) Anakinra plus zinc 
 
Participants  will be instructed  to begin  dosing on day 1.  Oral study medication should be taken with 
water  as instructed on study drug label. Patients will receive two oral medications. Bottle [ADDRESS_312021] be instructed to swallow the capsule whole; they must not open capsule. 
Subcutaneous study medication should also begin on Day 1 and be administered daily on Day s 1 to 
14. 
 
6.4.1 Dispensing  Procedures  
On Day 0, after confirmation of participant eligibility and randomization, the investigator or 
designee will dispense study medication to the participant. Before leaving the clinic/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the 
study staff will ensure that the participant fully understands the dosing instructions. We will dispense a sharps container for each subject discharged before day 14. The clinical trial site investigator may 
adjust the number of study medication dispensed to the participant based on clinical judgment and 
visit scheduling to ensure an adequate supply of study medication is available for dosing between clinic visits. An  unscheduled distribution of study medication Anakinra/ Placebo may occur on Day 
7 if needed to comply with medication changes necessitated by [CONTACT_256688].  
  
45  6.4.2 Blinding  
Study medication bottles will be labeled in a blinded manner to ensure that neither participant nor 
investigator is unblinded.  Examples of labels for the initial  dispense:

medication compliance log.  
 
6.4.4 Environmental  Assessment  
Is requested for categorical exclusion for this proposed clinical trial as provided for in 21 
CFR.25.31(e) in that the drug shipped under this notice is intended to be used in clinical trials in 
which the amount of waste expected to enter the environment may reasonably be expected to be 
non-toxic.  
 
6.5 Randomization 
6.5.1 Method of Assigning Participants to Treatment  Groups  
The trial will be conducted in a double -blind, placebo- controlled manner. Participants will be 
randomized to the two treatment groups in equal proportions. The randomization plan will be 
stratified by [CONTACT_256654]. Blocks of size 4  will be generated randomly based on a 
predefined randomization code generated by [CONTACT_256690] (DCC - IU). 
Both participants and investigators will be blinded to the randomization plans.  
 
The investigator or designee will be requi red to register the participant into the REDCap system 
(AlcHepNet’s data management system) and will provide participant data to properly randomize and 
allocate the participant to treatment. A randomization number will be assigned and study medication dispensing information ( e.g., arm assignmen t) will be provided.  
 
In the unlikely event of a system failure, the randomization will occur outside of REDCap according  
to the back -up emergency plan detailed in the Manual of Operations. IU DCC will maintain at all  
times a current, off -line randomization list and will be able to act as the Emergency Support team 
until the system is restored to its full capacity.  
 
6.5.[ADDRESS_312023] will be unblinded to randomization codes and corresponding treatment 
assignment . Additionally, the randomizat ion codes and corresponding treatment  assignment will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_256691] -IU. The biostatisticians performing the analyses will also be 
blinded. The study designated physician ([CONTACT_256722] or his designee), or the individual investigators wi ll not have access to this information. In the event that a medical emergency 
necessitates unblinding (i.e., in situations where knowledge of the blinded treatment is necessary for further medical management of the participant), the site investigator (or h is/her designee) will 
contact [CONTACT_256692]. If there is a difference of opi[INVESTIGATOR_256621], then the site investigator will defer to the sub -investigator who retains the final right to seek unblinding. The designated sub-
investigator will communicate with the DCC -IU about the decision to unblind the participant and 
then the DCC -IU will unblind the participant by [CONTACT_256693] - investigator.  
 
The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be able to unblind participants. Cases of premature unblinding (as noted above) will be reviewed by [CONTACT_4318].  
 
Access to randomization codes and corresponding treatment assignment will also be  made available 
to the designated study physician who is responsible for reporting SAEs and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) to the Regulatory Authorities and should be accessed only in the event that reporting necessitates unblinding. Aside from the IU IDS pharmacist who conducts the drug over labeling , site pharmacy staff will be unblinded to the subject’s treatment. Treatment  will be 
assigned through REDCap. Pharmacy staff will be responsible for blinding the subject’s treatment  before 
dispensing. Pharmacy will be trained to maintain the blind.  No other site personnel will have direct 
access to blinded participant treatment codes until all trial data have been entered onto the trial database and validated and the databas e locked.
 
6.6.1 Treatment and holding/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256622]. 
Such iatrogenic rise in leukocytosis may alarm participant care teams who are blinded to the 
treatment arm and may raise concern for development of infection or sepsis.  
 
While many AH participants may develop the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (defined as two or more abnormalities in temperature, increased heart rate , respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], or white 
blood cell count), SIRS may not always be indicative of infection in participants with AH and may 
be reflective of the dysregulated inflammatory state with AH.  
  
48  Drug Holding Rules (Day 0 -Day 30):  
If one of the following criteria met, the study drugs should be held for 3 days:  
1. Documented  Infection  
• Pneumonia defined as new infiltrate by [CONTACT_256694] 
• Positive cultures (blood, ascites) for bacteria or  fungus  
• Positive fungal cultures in urine (> 50,000 colonies/ml)   
• CNS infection defined as positive cultures or WBC > 5 in CSF 
• Severe soft tissue or bone infections including clinical diagnosis of  cellulitis  
2. SIRS (defined as two or more abnormalities in temperature, increased  heartrate,  
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], or whit e blood cell count) with increase in SOFA score ≥[ADDRESS_312024] day to determine if study drugs could be resumed or 
should be stopped.  
Drug Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004] (Day 0 -Day 30):  
 
Participants will be reassessed on third day of the study drugs hold: If infection clears and 
participant stabilizes, study drugs will be resumed.  
 
1. For participants with documented infection: If infection is responsive to antibiotics and 
participant  is stabilized  or improved,  study  drugs may be resumed  at the discretion  of the 
clinical care team. If there is no improvement after 3 days, study drugs will be  stopped.  
2. For participants meeting only SOFA +SIRS criteria for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]: if cultures of urine, 
blood, ascites, stool (including C. diff) are negative and CXR is unchanged, study drugs may be resumed at the discretion of the clinical care  team.  
3. If the participant has a second hold of study drugs due to infection/SOFA+SIRS criteria, study drugs will be  stopped.  
4. Participants in either arm who have a Lille score of > 0.45 on day 7 will stop bottle 1 
(prednisone/ placebo) and will continue with bottle 2 (zinc/zinc placebo.)  
 
Drug stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] (Day 0 -Day 30):  
• No improvement or stabilization after holding study drugs for 3  days 
• 2nd hold of study drugs due to infection/SOFA+SIRS criteria 
• Development of severe leukocytosis  (≥100,000/mm3). 
 
Treatment holding and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256623] (DILI)  
 
Identifying the instances of suspected drug induced liver injury (DILI) in individuals with underlying 
liver disease with abnormal liver biochemistries is difficult and this issue becomes far more 
challenging in individuals with severe alcoholic hepatitis because (a) aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase may not reliably inc rease due to burnt out hepatocytes in this population and (b) liver 
test worsening may be due to myriad of other reasons including worsening of underlying alcoholic hepatitis or sepsis.  
 
49  Therefore, we propose the following:  
 
1) When to hold or discontinue the study medicine in a participant? In individuals with 
severe alcoholic hepatitis participating in our RCT, we will hold the study medicine if 
MELD increases by 5 from baseline or Child’s score increases by 3 points from baseline 
plus >3-fold increase in AL T from baseline on two consecutive occasions. These 
instances may represent either lack of therapeutic efficacy or DILI or some other etiology. If there is a competing etiology and DILI can be excluded, study drug can be resumed within 3- 4 days. However, if DILI cannot be excluded, then the study drug will 
be permanently discontinued. Additional reasons for study drug discontinuation include unexplained elevation  in ALT > 5 x baseline  or > 500 
U/L on two consecutive occasions 
or unexplained elevation in Alk P > 3 x baseline or >500 U/L on two consecutive occasions. It should be noted that cholestatic DILI may have a devastating impact on participant survival in individuals with advanced liver  disease.  
2) When to terminate the trial due to DILI c oncerns? The Data  Safety  Monitoring 
Committee (DSMB) should carefully monitor the number of discontinuations due to MELD/Child’s Score worsening in the  three treatment groups. Since this trial is not 
powered for rare adverse events, one should not look for statistically significant imbalance among treatment groups, but the DSMB should consider numerical imbalances that its members deem clinically significant. While it may be straight forward 
in some instances (for example, 2 discontinuations in groups A but 5 discontinuations in 
group B) but in other instances it may not be as clear cut and one may continue the trial for a growing trend. In any case, the DSMB is advisory in nature and it makes a recommendation to the Sponsor which is the NIAAA for this trial. In addition to seeking the AlcHepNet Steering Committee input, the NIAAA may seek external input to assist 
in its deliberation if the DSMB recommends that the clinical trial must be terminated due 
to safety  concerns.
 
Treatment holding/stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256624]  
 
• If platelet counts drop to < 40,000 while on injectable study drugs, injectable study drugs 
will be held and resumed when platelet count is ≥ 40,000 . 
 
• Worsening renal function 
As all patients are randomized to treatment arms while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the site’s dispensing pharmacy  
will check the GFR before dispensing the study drugs for the day. Pharmacy will enter the daily lab 
values into a REDCap -based decision support form, which will aid  the pharmacy by [CONTACT_256695]. This REDCap form is in addition to the pharmacy manual of procedures, which also provides guidance on daily dispensation. For weekend coverage, the GFR and platelet values from the Friday l abs may be used to generate the dispensation schedule at some 
sites. If the subject’s GFR has dropped to <30 but ≥[ADDRESS_312025] is in the anakinra group, 
Redcap will provide instructions for pharmacy to  dose reduce to every other day by [CONTACT_256696], alternating with active anakinra the following day. If the GFR drops to < 20 mL/min, the instructions from REDCap  will hold active anakinra and substitute with anakinra 
placebo  
 
When the patient is discharge d and now outpatient, all injectable drugs will be dose reduced and 
administered every other day when the GFR drops to <30 but ≥ 20 mL/min. All injectable drugs 
50  will be stopped if GFR drops to <20 mL/min. 
 
6.6.2 Unscheduled, Emergency  Unblind ing 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Rules for unblinding participants  for leukocytosis  and concern  for infection/sepsis  (Day 0- 
Day 30): 
In this placebo- controlled , blinded and  randomized trial, Principal Investigators, enrolled 
participants, and any study team member who will/is interpreting data will remain blinded.  
1. If the participant develops leukocytosis >)  WBC > 30 x 109/L or WBC > 30,000/mm3, the clinical 
care team may request unblinding if the team believes that knowing the treatment would impact care 
decisions such as starting antibiotics.  
2. If the participant  develops  hypotension (systolic  BP < 90) and/or requires  transfer  to an ICU, the 
clinical care team may request unblinding if the team believes that knowing the treatment would 
impact  care decisions such as administration  of pressors, fluids or other  supportive therapy.  
3. If the participant develops any other serious adverse event that  is, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , 
probably related to one of the study drugs, the clinical care team may request unblinding if it would impact care  decisions. 
 
Who to unblind?  
• Only  sub- investigator  
• Clinical care  team  
• DCC contact 
[CONTACT_256697]:  
1. Each site will designate a sub -investigator who can be contact[CONTACT_256698]  
2. The contact[CONTACT_256699]- investigator will communicate with IU DCC to unblind the participant then 
inform participant care team of the study drug/s participant is  receiving  
3. IU DCC will build this into the database system and keep track of unblinded participants  
4. The decision to begin antibiotics for possible infection is left to the judgment of the clinical care 
team.  
 
6.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications or  Procedures  
Relevant information about all concomitant drugs (including prescribed, over the counter, or herbal 
preparations) taken prior to [ADDRESS_312026] with renal dysfunction. No interaction 
between zinc and anakinra is reported. Zinc may interfere with absorption of certain oral antibiotics such as quinolones and tetracyclines. To avoid potential interference with concomitant medications, we will admi nister the morning blinded capsules (zinc/zinc placebo or prednisone/prednisone 
placebo) at least 3 hours apart from other medications the participant will take.  
 
51  6.8 Treatment  Compliance  
The investigator  should assess the participant’s  compliance  with dosing  of study  medication  on an 
ongoing basis, at least at each visit, and confirm by [CONTACT_256700] (i.e., count of 
returned capsules , syringes).  
Participants should be instructed to retain all study medication, even if empty, and to return them to the investigator at the subsequent visit. The investigator or designee should perform drug 
accountability and, if applicable, follow up with the participant to retrieve any study medication that 
has not been returned.  
If the investigator has  concerns about a participant’s dosing compliance s/he should discuss this 
with the participant, assess the reasons for noncompliance and the likelihood that the participant 
will remain  noncompliant,  and notify  the designated  study  physician  accordingly.  Continued  trial 
eligibility should be assessed based on the participant’s compliance with study medication dosing 
and clinic visits.

completed the trial.  
 
It is the responsibility of the individual site’s PI [INVESTIGATOR_256625] 
(WIRB) of discontinuation of the trial and the reason for doing so in a timely fashion according to 
institutional policies.

61  8. EFFICACY EVALUATIONS  Primary Endpoint Survival at 90 days  Secondary  Endpoints 
• Change in Lille score,  change  in MELD  score,  development  of AKI,  multi -organ  failure,  SIRS, 
transfer to ICU, changes in liver function will all be evaluated at 7, 30 and 90  days.  
 
• Organ dysfunction: We will measure changes in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) 
scores and proportions requiring hemodynamic support for MAP < 65 mm Hg and lactate > 2 mmol/l,  renal  replacement  therapy  or mechanical  ventilation.  We will also modify and re-evaluate 
the SOFA  score without platelet  counts  given  that these are usually low in  AH. 
 
• Infections and Sepsis: It is now recognized that the endpoints and case definitions related to sepsis may vary depending on what these will be used for (clinical care, research, surveillance , or 
quality improvement). Given the central role of sepsis as a driver of outcomes, we will not only measure  the types  of infection  but also identify  the proportions of those with sepsis, septic  shock 
or quick- SOFA (qSOFA) criteria based on SEPSIS -3 guidance
2,39. We will also capture the key 
parameters needed for various sepsis related endpoint construction aligned by [CONTACT_256702] H ub (http://eddh- cro.wixsite.com/fdtsfv).  
 
• Renal  dysfunction: In alignment  with guidance from  the acute  disease quality  initiative56, we will 
quantify AKI development and its progression through persistent AKI, acute kidney disease to chronic kidney disease.  
• Need for care escalation: Proportion of participants requiring transfer to ICU for care 
• Indicators of gut permeability (endotoxin and bacterial 18S DNA) and pro - inflammatory 
cytokine/chemokines (TNFa, MCP1, IL -6, IL-1ß) will be assessed in serum/plasma samples. 
• Survival at day [ADDRESS_312032] to disease severity, end organ involvement and the care they receive. Moreover, as in 
sepsis and heart failure, death involves failure of multiple organs (liver, heart, kidney, lungs) making it hard to ascertain which one is the primary cause of death. This has led to development and regulatory acceptance of composite endpoints including mortality and key parameters driving mortality for acute heart failure trials. We will leverage these guiding principles to construct a novel 
and innovative key secondary composite endpoint which will include death or worsen ing of the 
SOFA score
4,5 by ≥ 2 points and worsening of modified MELD score by ≥ [ADDRESS_312033] mortality to further optimize this endpoint and cross- 
validate it in the  observation cohort.   
62  9. SAFETY  EVALUATIONS  
9.1 Adverse  Events  
Adverse event (AE) data will be collected from Day 0 through the double -blind phase, until the 
participant fully completes her/his trial participation at the Follow Up visit.  
 
9.2 Physical Examination and  Vital  Signs  
To assess for clinical findings, the investigator or designee will perform a physical examination at the 
time points specified in the Schedule of Trial Procedures (Table 1). All above physical exams may be extracted from medical records if patient is inpat ient. This includes height only at Screening. The 
physical examination must include the following:  
 
9.2.1 Physical  Examination  
• General  appearance  
• Weight  
• Eyes 
• Ears, nose, and throat  
• Neck  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517]  
• Cardiovascular  system  
• Abdominal  region  
• Mental  status  
• Neurological  system  
9.2.2 Vital  signs  
The following vital signs will be assessed at indicated visits: body temperature, sitting heart rate, sitting blood pressure (BP ), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], body weight in kilograms without shoes, and height in  
centimeters (screening only) . When taking heart rate and BP readings, participants should be seated 
quietly for a minimum of 3 minutes before the reading is taken.  
 
9.3 Clinical  Laboratory  
Blood samples for serum chemistry, hematology, and coagulation will be collected at every visit as detailed in the Schedule of Trial Procedures. The number and volume of samples to be collected at each visit will be detailed in a separate document. These tests will be conducted at local laboratories at 8 participating sites.  
 
All participants with laboratory tests containing clinically significant abnormal values should be followed regularly until the values return to normal ranges, until a valid reason for the AE (other than study medication related AE) is identified, or unti l further follow up is deemed medically 
unnecessary.   
63  9.4 Other Safety Related Clinical  Outcomes  
The following clinical outcomes will be assessed:  
 
• Death (from hepatic and non -hepatic related  causes)  
• Complications of portal hypertension including gastroesophageal bleeding, interventions to 
manage variceal bleeding (e.g., variceal banding/sclerotherapy or TIPS placement) and diuretic 
resistant  ascites  
• Complications of Cirrhosis: new -onset  ascites,  hepatic  encephalopathy,  hepatorenal 
syndrome (type I  or II), and spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Change to a higher level of care ( i.e., floor to ICU) is an SAE 
Each of these events including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256627], or unexpected  (e.g., suicide,  motor  vehicle 
accident, or myocardial  infarction).
64  10. ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Definition of Adverse Events & Reporting Period for Adverse  Events  
Safety will be assessed in terms of AEs. All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_093], reported by 
[CONTACT_2299], noted from laboratory findings, or identified by [CONTACT_11174], will be recorded from Day 0 until the participant completes trial participation (D- 180).  
 
AEs are defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of the study 
medication in humans, whether or not considered related to study medication. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal 
laboratory  findi ng), symptom,  or disease temporally  associated  with any use of the study medication, 
without any judgment about causality and irrespective of route of administration, formulation, or 
dose, including an overdose. For this trial, study medication refers to A nakinra, zinc,  Prednisone, or 
placebo in the double-blind phase. 
 
AEs include but  are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency of 
condition(s) present at the start of the trial;  (2) participant  deterioration  due to  primary  illness; (3) 
intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction.  
 
Participants  should  be questioned in a general  way, without leading  the participant  or asking about the 
occurrence of any specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. The diagnosis and not the individual signs/symptoms should be documented as the AE. For example, if the underlying disease process is a stroke, it would not be appropriate to record the AE by [CONTACT_141538] 
“sudden numbness, dizziness, and difficulty speaking.” The AE medical term of “stroke or 
cerebrovascular accident” should be recorded as it more accurately describes the AE. Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_256703] d 
to the study medication,  must be documented  in the participant’s  medical  records, in accordance  with 
the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE source Document . Each AE is to be 
evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and 
relationship to the study medication.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pretreatment Event(s)  
Untoward events that occur during screening phase (prior to randomization) should be recorded as 
medical history.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_312034] be graded  for severity  (i.e., intensity).  A severity  category  of mild, moderate,  or severe,  as 
defined  in Table 2, must be entered  on the AE source document. It should be noted  that the term 
“severe”  used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.” For example, severe 
headache is a  severe AE, but may not be a serious AE.  The assessment of severity is made 
regardless of study medication relationship or of the seriousness of the AE. 
  
65  Table 2: Clinical Description of Adverse Event Severity  
 
Grade  Clinical Description of Severity  
1 = Mild  Causing no limitation of usual activities; the participant may experience 
slight discomfort.  
2 = 
Moderate  Causing some limitation of usual activities; the participant may experience 
annoying discomfort. 
3 = 
Severe  Causing inability to carry out usual activities; the participant may 
experience intolerable discomfort or pain.  
 
10.1.3  Relationship of AEs to Study  Medication  
The investigator  will document  her/his opi[INVESTIGATOR_256628] 3 An AE for which there is a ‘reasonable possibility’ 
that the study medication caused the AE is otherwise referred to as suspected adverse reaction (SAR). ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. 
Table 3. Relationship of AEs to Study Medication  
 
Relationship  Description  
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug or in which the study medication level has been established in body fluids or 
tissue; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and 
that is confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_256629] e of the study 
medication, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposure.  
Probable  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
study medication; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
study medication; that is confirmed by [CONTACT_13635][INVESTIGATOR_256630]; and that could not be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604].  
Possible  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of t he 
study medication; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected 
study medication; but that could readily be produced by a number of other factors.  
Unlikely  A reaction that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the study medication; that does not follow a known or suspected response pattern 
to the suspected study medication; and that could reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_244458]’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
66  10.2 Serious Adverse  Events  
10.2.1  Definition of a Serious Adverse  Event 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘serious’ if, in the view of the 
investigator, it results in any of the following  outcomes:  
 
(a) Death;  
(b) Is life  threatening;  
(c) Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life  functions;  
(d) A congenital anomaly/birth  defect;  
(e) Requires in- participant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256631];  
(f) An important  medical  event  that may jeopardize  the participant  or participant  and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed  above.  
10.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAE ) Classifications  Common  in Severe AH 
Acute kidney  injury:  
• Increase in creatinine of 50% above baseline over a period of 7  days 
• Increase in creatinine of 0.3 mg/dl within a period of 48  hrs. 
• Onset of renal failure requiring  dialysis  
Sepsis:  
• Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response  to infection  
• An increase in SOFA score of 2 points of  more  
• Note: most participants with severe AH have 4 points based on bilirubin only 
Infection:  
• Pneumonia defined as new infiltrate by [CONTACT_256704] “fluid overload”  
• Positive blood cultures for bacteria or fungus, not suspected as contaminant  
• Positive urine fungal culture > 50,000  colonies/ml  
• Positive urine bacterial culture >  100,000 colonies/ml (mixed flora is  excluded)  
• Soft tissue or bone infections including cellulitis or abscess documented by [CONTACT_256705] 
• CNS infection defined as positive culture of CSF or > 5  WBC/ml  
• Ascitic fluid white cell count >500/ml or neutrophils>250/ml. with or without positive bacterial 
or fungal  cultures  
 
Decompensation of liver disease:  
• New onset of ascites if not present on admission to  study  
• New onset of variceal  hemorrhage  
• New onset of hepatic encephalopathy  (HE).  
67  Hepatic failure defined as increase in MELD score ≥ 5 on two consecutive occasions  
 
Cerebral failure defined as worsening HE ≥ Grade 3 if hepatic encephalopathy present  on admission  
 
Renal failure defined as serum creatinine ≥3 milligrams per liter or requirement for  renal replacement therapy 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_256632] ≥  
60 mm Hg despi[INVESTIGATOR_256633] ≥2 organs 
 
Note: Sepsis will often be an SAE that precedes documented infection by 1 -5 days. If sepsis is 
reported as an SAE and infection is never documented, then it  should be classified separately, 
i.e., sepsis with documented infection or sepsis without documented infection.  
 
Sepsis can be diagnosed by [CONTACT_256706] 
160,000 to 90,000 or increase in creatinine to 1.3 and drop in platelet count to 100 -150,000 from 
normal on admission. However, these changes may also occur due to worsening liver disease 
without infection as a cause.   
68  10.2.3  Reporting SAEs  
In agreeing  to the provisions of this protocol, the investigator  accepts  all legal responsibilities for 
immediate reporting of SAEs to the study designated physician ([CONTACT_256722] or his designee) as 
described  below.

information should be provided at the time of the initial report: 5-digit Study ID, a description of the event, at least one criterion classifying the event as Serious and the name [CONTACT_22168]. Additionally, judgment of causality by [CONTACT_256707].   
[ADDRESS_312037] be reported promptly to the  DCC -IU. 
The site investigator will assess whether the event is causally related to the study medication. The 
study designated physician ([CONTACT_256722]) will consider the investigator’s assessment, however, since [CONTACT_256722] holds the IND and is primarily res ponsible for the overall safety of the participants, his 
causality assessment will take precedence over that of the site investigator. The study designated physician will determine if an SAE meets the criteria for an IND safety report (suspected,  
unexpected serious adverse reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) in accordance with the FDA regulations, 312.32(c)(1)(i). 
 
We will monitor safety closely, including all SAEs, AKI, and infection. We will provide unblinded data on SAEs including infections and AKI to the DSMB on monthly basis and hold the first DSMB after 3 months from the start of enrollment. We also propose a risk -based monitoring 
(RBM) approach which will create a more efficient and timely monitoring of accumulating data on the adverse events of interest, namely AKI an d infections. The FDA has issued a final guidance in 
2013 (Guidance for Industry. Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk-Based Approach to Monitoring. August 2013) with a follow -up draft guidance in March  2019 (A Risk- Based Approach 
to Monitoring of Clinical Investigations. Questions and Answers. Guidance for Industry) that indicated the acceptability of RBM in studies with FDA oversight. While the details and implementation are left to the trial investigators, the overall concepts are included in th ese two 
documents – and in the Transcelerate RBM Position Paper (available at https://www.transceleratebiopharmainc.com/wp -content/uploads/2013/10/TransCelerate-RBM-
 
Position- Paper -FINAL -30MAY2013.pdf ). The essential elements of t he study- specific AE/SAE 
monitoring plan would be for the RBM tools to interface with the main REDCap database so that any new AEs or SAEs would be immediately passed to the data driven RBM tools to determine if a trigger threshold has been reached. This i nteraction between receipt of data by [CONTACT_256708] (and reporting of it on study dashboards) by [CONTACT_256709]. In addition, levels of thresholds can be set so that data trends of SAEs  accumulating within treatment groups can be identified before significance is reached. A 
complete monitoring plan, including RBM details, will be developed for review  by [CONTACT_256710]. We will also include St atistical Process 
Control (SPC) techniques in the monitoring plan to ensure that appropriate statistical controls are also utilized during the study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_256634]. The investigator should comply with requests by [CONTACT_256711]’s AE source document and, if necessary, provide a c opy of this 
source document to the DCC -IU. Other supporting documents such as radiology reports, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256635], when  appropriate,  in anonymized 
fashion. Additionally, upon request by [CONTACT_256712], the investigator  should provide 
input into the SAE narrative and provide timely information to ensure prompt follow up and closure of the SAE report. 
 
The investigator and supporting personnel responsible for participant care should discuss with the designated study physician any need for supplemental investigations of SAE(s). The results of these additional assessments must be reported to the designated study physician. 
 
10.3 SAEs that are Anticipated to Occur in the Study Population  (Expected  SAEs)  
Certain SAEs are anticipated to occur in this study population at some frequency independent of 
70  drug exposure. Examples of these expected SAEs include variceal bleeding, ascites, spontaneous 
bacterial peritonitis, jaundice, hepatorenal syndrome, or hepatic encephalopathy. These expected SAEs as well as any related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256636] (Table 4.). However, if an aggregate analysis indicates  that these events are occurring more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a 
concurrent or historical control group, the SAEs will be reported as an IND safety report (21 CRF 312.32(c)(1)(c) ). Follow  up of AEs 
All AEs, including clinically signif icant laboratory values or physical examination findings relative to 
pretreatment assessments, must be followed during the trial until the AE resolves, is no longer of 
clinical concern, has stabilized or is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost t o follow up. 
 
AEs ongoing at the final visit that are deemed to be ‘possibly, probably, or definitely” related or of other clinical significance must be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the safety of the participant or until the eve nt stabilizes, resolves, or is no longer of clinical concern. If 
resolved, a resolution date for the AE should be documented on the CRF. The investigator must ensure that follow up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the  nature 
and/or causality of the AE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, or consultation with other healthcare professionals, as considered clinically appropriate by [CONTACT_093].  
 
Note:  Some SAEs like AKI, GI bleeding, infections, etc . can be both expected and common
71  11. STATISTICAL  METHODS  
11.1 Analysis  Sets 
The primary analyses of 90 -day mortality will be performed in an Intention -to-Treat (ITT) 
framework using survival analysis. Specifically, 
 
(1) we will use all -cause mortality in the first [ADDRESS_312038] an analysis of the restricted mean survival time (RMST) of th e 
first 90 days.  
(2) as a secondary analysis, we will compare transplant -free survival in the first [ADDRESS_312039], Cox regression model, and RMS T analyses as appropriate.  
(3) we plan to conduct one interim analysis and one final analysis for this trial. The interim analysis 
will be conducted when 129 patients, half of the enrollment number, complete the 90 -day 
follow -up. We use the group sequential me thod to control the type 1 error rate of the trial.  
(4)  as another secondary analysis, we will examine the treatment effects in patients with baseline 
MELD scores ≤ 25 and >[ADDRESS_312040] the interaction between the int ervention indicator and 
baseline MELD score in the Cox regression model .  
 
Complete details of the proposed statistical analyses, including a single interim analysis, can be 
found in the Revised Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
 
11.[ADDRESS_312041]. The ex periment -wise significance level will be 5%. 
The most recent data from the AlcHepNet consortium suggest a 90 -day mortality rate for 
prednisone is approximately 20%. We estimate that with a total of 258 participants (1 29 per 
treatment arm), we will be able to detect a clinically significant hazards ratio of 0.325, which translates to a 13% reduction in 90 -day mortality, i.e., 80% survival in prednisone vs 93% in 
anakinra plus zinc groups with 85% power by [CONTACT_256653]- sided logrank tests. We use O’Brien and 
Fleming α -spending function to determine the efficacy stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256607]. 
Specifically, if the test statistics of the log -rank test is greater than 2.[ADDRESS_312042]  an early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256637]. At the time of interim analysis, we will calculate the conditional power, i.e., the 
probability of claiming difference at the end of the trial given the data at the interim analysis. We will stop the trial for futility when the conditional po wer is less than 0. 1. In other words, based on data 
that become available at the interim analysis, assuming that the current trend continues, we should 
early stop the trial if the probability of declaring anakinra + zinc superior in the final analysis is l ow 
72  (e.g., less than 1 0%). We use this early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256608] a potentially 
inefficacious treatment.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_312043] medical terminology using the case report forms provided. 
Summary tables of treatment -emergent AEs will be provided. A TEAE is any AE that newly 
appeared, increased in frequency, or worsened in severity following initiation of study medication.  
The incidence of TEAEs will be tabulated by [CONTACT_256713],  and by [CONTACT_256714].  Tables  of TEAEs  leading  to study 
medication discontinuation and SAEs will be  provided.  
 
11.3.2  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Descriptive statistics summarizing central laboratory data (hematology, chemistry, and coagulation) will be presented for all trial visits. Changes from pretreatment to each trial visit will also be 
summarized by [CONTACT_1570]/arm.  
 
a. The primary analyses of [ADDRESS_312044] survival. Tests will be performed at a two -sided nominal significance level 
of 5%.  If the proportional hazard assumption is not met, we will compare t he restricted mean 
survival time at [ADDRESS_312045] survival will be included  as 
covariates .  
b. We will also compare the transplant -free survival functions of the two treatment groups, at  30, 90 
and 180  days.  
c. We will also secondarily compare the occurrence of events such as s epsis and renal  dysfunction 
by [CONTACT_256715] (logrank test and Cox regression) . 
 
 
Before the groups are compared on these instruments, the baseline data will be examined to look for 
group imbalance  among  the survivors.  Comparisons will be  made  using  linear  regression  models  that 
include baseline MELD score and other relevant and/or unbalanced  covariates.  
 
11.3.3  Additional Safety and Clinical  Findings  
Additional safety assessments include vital signs, lab results, and physical examinations. Descriptive 
statistics of the vital sign and lab measures will be provided ; comparisons between the two treatment 
73  groups will be made using mixed effects models . Changes of these variables  from baseline at each 
visit will be analyzed similarly .  
   
74  11.3.4  Other Safety Related Clinical  Outcomes  
The following clinical outcomes will be assessed:  
 
• Death (from hepatic and non -hepatic related  causes)  
• Complications of portal hypertension including gastroesophageal bleeding, interventions to 
manage variceal bleeding (e.g., variceal banding/sclerotherapy or TIPS placement) and diuretic resistant  ascites  
• Complications  of Cirrhosis:  new-onset  ascites,  hepatic  encephalopathy,  hepat orenal  syndrome 
(type I or II), and spontaneous bacterial  peritonitis).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] 
• Liver transplantation  
11.[ADDRESS_312046] 50% of the participants have been in the study for 90 days. Formal efficacy analyses will be based on the Lan -Demets 
version of the O’Brien- Fleming boundary to provide an overall two- sided P = 0.[ADDRESS_312047]. Futility will 
be assessed based on conditional power
.57,58 . For example, termination due to futility may be 
considered if conditional power is very low (e.g. less than 0.10), under the assumption that the 
hypothesized treatment difference is correct.  In other words, based on data that become available at 
the interim analysis, assuming that the current trend continues, we should early stop the trial if the 
probability of declaring anakinra + zinc superior in the final analysis is low (e.g., less than 1 0%). We 
use this early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_256608] a potentially inefficacious treatment.  
The efficacy interim analyses will be performed on unblinded data. Additional data that will be 
included in the interim analyses are:  
 
• Tables of labora tory data by  [CONTACT_19313] 
• Tabulated safety  data by [CONTACT_19313]  
• Listings of adverse events and serious adverse events by  [CONTACT_19313] 
 
11.[ADDRESS_312048]  (DSMB)  
An independent DSMB will be formed to review safety data at periodic intervals from this and all other AlcHepNet studies. Members of the DSMB will not be allowed to participate as investigators in thi s trial.  
 
The DSMB will review blinded safety data and unblinded safety data (as necessary in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]) to ensure the safe and property treatment of participants. The frequency of their standard meetings 
will be according to the agreed upon DSMB chart er. In addition, Chair of the DSMB or the 
designated study physician may call for an ad -hoc DSMB if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_256716]. Based 
on review  of these  data, the DSMB  will send a written  report  to the designated  study  physician  and to 
the DCC -IU. It  is the responsibility of the designated study physician and the DCC- IU to distribute 
75  these  reports  to all other  stakeholders  (NIAAA, FDA,  and individual  sites)  
 
The DSMB will operate under an appropriate charter (in compliance with relevant regulatory 
guidance) that will define its organization and operation. The DSMB will prepare written minutes of 
both its open and closed sessions. The closed minutes will be made available to the investigators only 
after the database is locked and the blind  for the trial has been broken. All investigators and 
responsible  IRBs will be informed  of any decisions made  which  alter the conduct  of this trial based  on 
recommendations  from  the DSMB  relating  to participant  safety.  The investigators  will inform  the 
participants of such actions and the protocol and ICF will be revised, as appropriate.  
 
Changes to the protocol or to the ICS may be initiated by [CONTACT_148711], but it is the final 
responsibility of the designated study physician as the IND holder to approve/finalize any such 
changes and to communicate to other stakeholder.  
[ADDRESS_312049] of the Trial  
This trial will be conducted in accordance with 21CFR Part 312, Good Clinical Practice 
(CPMP/ICH/135/95), and with the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable re gulatory requirements.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_312050]  (IRB)  
Western Institutional Review Board (WIRB) will review and approve this study prior to its initiation. Amendments can be implemented only following the IRB approval unless the amendment is necessary t o reduce immediate risk to trial participants. The IRB will be informed of any new safety 
information that negatively affects the risk assessment of the trial as soon as it becomes available.  
Investigators will report various categories of the AEs to the IRB according to  the schedule 
described in Table 4.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_312051] to the participant will be  
regarded as confidential and confidentiality of all participants will be maintained. Clinical monitors (e.g., CRAs), auditors and inspectors will require access to a participant’s medical notes for the purpose  of source  document  verification,  but the participant’s  confidentiality  will be maintained  at all 
times. An agreement for disclosure of any such information will be obtained in writing and is included in the statement of informed consent. The trial data shall not be disclosed to a third party (with th e exception of auditors and/or regulatory authorities) without the written consent of the 
AlcHepNet consortium. All data shall be secured against unauthorized access.  
 
Apart from the site investigators, no one will have access to participant’s identity . Each site will  
securely  maintain  the code that links participants’  identity  to their study  numbers to prevent  access to 
unauthorized third parties. Participants will be i dentified according to  their study numbers in the 
data management system (REDCap) and by [CONTACT_256717].  
 
The written ICF will explain that, for data verification purposes, authorized representatives of the funding agency, IRB or drug companies which are supplying the study medicine may require direct access to parts of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256638], including participant’s medical history.

12.6 Data Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
Logic and consistency checks will be performed on all data entered into the source document to ensure accuracy and completeness.  
 
Training sessions, regular monitoring of the trial at the trial sites, instruction manuals, data verification, cross -checking and data audits will be performed to ensure quality of all trial data. 
Investigators’ meetings and/or on- site trial initiations will be performed to prepare investigators and 
other tri al site personnel for appropriate collection of trial data.  
12.7 Site monitoring & auditing  
12.7.1  Trial  Monitoring  
Trial records at each site will be monitored at regular intervals by a clinical research associate (CRA). The role of the CRA is to aid the investigator  in the maintenance and documentation of complete, 
accurate, legible, well organized,  and easily retrievable data. In addition, the CRA will ensure the 
investigator ’s understanding of all applicable regulations concerning the clinical evaluation of the 
study medication and will ensure an understanding of the protocol, reporting responsibilities and the 
validity of the data. This will include ensuring that full and appropriate essential documentation is available. Responsibility for properly implementing the  protocol and maintaining complete trial 
records remain with each investigator.  
 
In order to perform this role, the CRA must perform source data verification (SDV) and as such must be given access to the participant’s primary source documentation (e.g., paper or electronic medical records) that support data entries in the CRF. The investigator may exercise judgment in allowing the CRA access to particular sections of the participant ’s medical records if these are 
deemed irrelevant to the performance, observ ations or conduct of this trial.  
  
79   
12.7.2  Trial  Auditing  
The investigator should understand that it may be necessary for the IRB and / or a regulatory 
agency  to conduct  one or more  site audits  during  or after the trial and agrees  to allow  access  to all 
trial related  documentation  and information and be available  for discussion about  the trial. 
12.[ADDRESS_312055]  Retention  
The investigator should retain all correspondence relating to this trial in the Investigator Site File (ISF). Any trial documents stored elsewhere should have their location referenced in the ISF.  
 
All documents relating to the trial including the ISF itself, source documents and participant medical files), completed trial participant log and confidential participant identi fication list will be retained by

1.2 BACKGROUND INFORMAT ION 79 
1.2.1 Fiasp ®  80 
Faster -acting insulin aspart (faster aspart or Fiasp®) is insulin aspart in a new formulation 81 
that contains two well -known excipi[INVESTIGATOR_731169] (GRAS), niacinamide 82 
and L-arginine. These are both listed in the US Food and Drug Administration inactive 83 
ingredient database, in products for injection, at higher concentrations than used in Fiasp®.  84 
With Fiasp® , niacinamide is considered responsible for faster initial absorption after 85 
subcutaneous administration and L- arginine serves as a stabilizing agent. In subjects with 86 
type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM),  Fiasp® administered by [CONTACT_731178] [ADDRESS_998723] onset of appearance, a 2-fold higher early exposure, and >50% greater early [ADDRESS_998724] compared with insulin aspart 1,2. When Fiasp® is administered by 89 
subcutaneous insulin infusion pump therapy, the rapid onset of action is even more 90 
pronounc ed.  The time to half-maximal activity was reduced by 11.8 minutes, the time to 91 
peak activity was reduced by 25.7 minutes , and the duration of insulin activity was reduced 92 
by 35.4 minutes  when compared to insulin aspart 3 (see Figure 1 below). 93 
 94

Fiasp®  (blue) (n=44) was given subcutaneously by [CONTACT_731179] 96 
concentrations were measure. 97 
 98 
In a 6 week double-blind, randomized, crossover active-controlled trial comparing aspart to  99 

Fiasp®  using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump therapy, the  Fiasp®  [ADDRESS_998725] 4 (Figure 1-2)  102

grey) or  Fiasp®  (in blue) given as an insulin pump bolus at the onset of a standardized 105 
liquid meal (Boost) which h as 102 grams of CHO.  The bolus calculator in their pump was 106 
used for each meal dose. 107 
 108 
The more rapid onset of action and shorter duration could be very beneficial to full closed- 109 
loop control allowing an earlier onset of insulin action to cover the postprandial glucose rise, 110 
and decreasing the residual insulin after a meal to prevent late hypoglycemia.   Fiasp® has 111 
not been tested in a hybrid closed- loop system. 112 
Fiasp® was approved by [CONTACT_103620] 29, 2017 for people with type 1 and type 2 113 
diabetes in a pre-filled FlexTouch® pen and in 10 ml vials.  It was approved to be given by 114 
injection, but not for use in pumps.  In Europe it was approved for use by [CONTACT_731180] 115 
insulin infusion pumps.  In both the US and Europe it was approved for use in pregnancy.  116 
There has been one study published on pump compatibility of Fiasp® 5 which showed a 117 
premature end of infusion set wear in 10% of 210 Fiasp® infusions, and 4% of 98 aspart 118 
infusions (p=ns).   [ADDRESS_998726] patients using the 670G system.   131

The safety and effectiveness of the in-home use of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system was 137 
investigated in adolescents (n = 30, ages 14– 21 years) and adults (n = 94, ages 22– 75 138 
years) w ith type 1 diabetes in a multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_16076]  7. The 670G  system was used 139 
during a 2-week run-in phase without HCL control, or Auto Mode, enabled (Manual Mode) 140 
and then in Auto Mode during a 3- month study phase.  Data from the trial is seen below, in 141

The adolescents  used the system for a median 75.8%  of the time, and adults used the 146 
system for a median 88.0% of the time. From baseline run-in to the end of study phase the 147 
adolescent HbA1c decreased from 7.7% to 7.1% (P < 0.001) and adult HbA1c levels 148 
decreased from 7.3% to 6.8% (P < 0.001).  The proportion of overall in-target (71– 180 149 
mg/dL) sensor glucose (SG) values increased from 60.4% to 67.2% (P < 0.001) in 150 
adolescents  and from 68.8% to 73.8% (P < 0.001) in adults. Figure 1-4 provides a graph of 151 
the sensor values for both adolescent and adult subjects comparing their baseline data to 152 
their data using the 670G.  There were no severe hypoglycemic or  diabetic ketoacidosis 153 
events in either cohort.  154

analysis if: 1) the rate of change was greater than 0.5mg/d L/min in the [ADDRESS_998730], 2) subjects gave a subsequent bolus prior to [ADDRESS_998731] 180 
bolus, or 3) subjects deviated from their typi[INVESTIGATOR_619980].  181 
For the postprandial glucose analysis (Table 2)  there were limited observations available, [ADDRESS_998732] weeks on Day 1 of infusion set life (12- [ADDRESS_998733] hyaluronidase 184 
infusion) and Day 3 of infusion set life (immediately after second hyaluronidase infusion).  [ADDRESS_998734] on Day 2 of infusion set life (36-[ADDRESS_998735] hyaluronidase 186 
infusion) and Day 4 of infusion set life (24 hours after the second hyaluronidase infusion). 187 
The study was not powered to show a difference in glucodynamic parameters, but Cmax 188 
and tmax tended to be lower immediately after hyaluronidase infusions.  Postprandial 189 
profiles obtained from CGM glucose values are presented in mean ± standard error for 190 
meals analyzed on Days 1-4 of infusion set life in Fi gure 3.  There were too few meals 191 
available for analysis beyond Day 4 of infusion set life to allow postprandial analysis.  192

1.3 Study Overview  210 
 211 
Use of Fiasp®:  Fiasp® insulin has been approved for sale in the [LOCATION_003] , and has been 212 
available since February 7th 2018.  Although it is not approved for pumps, it will be used in 213 
pumps off-label because of it has a more rapid onset of action.  The 670G closed-loop 214 
system automati cally adjusts basal rates throughout the day and night to minimize hyper 215 
and hypoglycemia.  Use of the 670G provides a unique opportunity to assess how  Fiasp® 216 
works in a closed-loop system and to determine if any changes need to be made to the 217 
670G pump to optimize the use of Fiasp®.  218 
 219 
According to the FDA guidelines we do not think this study requires an IND since we meet 220 
all of the following six conditions:      221 
i. it is not intended to be reported to FDA in support of a new indication for use or to 222 
support any other significant change in the labeling for the drug; [ADDRESS_998738];  224 
iii. it does not involve a route of administration (it is still being given subcutaneously) or [ADDRESS_998739] population, or other factor that significantly increases 226 
the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the [ADDRESS_998740]; 228 
iv. it is conducted in compliance with the requirements for IRB review and informed 229 
consent [21 CFR parts 56 and 50, respectively]; 230 
v. it is conducted in compliance with the requirements concerning the promotion and 231 
sale of drugs [21 CFR 312.7]; and  232 
vi. it does not intend to invoke 21 CFR 50.24.”  233 
  234 
 235 
1.4 Protocol Synopsis:  [ADDRESS_998741] to obtain preliminary data on 238 
how Fiasp®  works in a closed- loop system. The plan will be to enroll up to 20  239 
subjects  for each part of the study .  Part 1 is a blinded cross -over study to assess 240 
how well Fiasp®  insulin works when used with the 670G pump compared to aspart [ADDRESS_998742] to complete.  Part 2 is a Fiasp® 242 
optimization phase to assess if making changes to meal coverage with the 243 
knowledge that Fiasp®  is being used can optimize the advantage s of the 670G 244 
pump with Fiasp® use , and to observe longer term use of Fiasp®  in the 670G 245 
pump. This will be a 6 week  study .    246 
 247 
Part 1:  Randomized cross -over, blinded study which includes  assessment of meal [ADDRESS_998743] to see how  250 
the 670G pump responds to the introduction of Fiasp®  insulin.  Subjects enrolled in [ADDRESS_998744] blinded insulin (aspart or Fiasp® ) which they will use for 2 weeks, 255 
before they cross -over to the other insulin.  During the second week of each arm we 256 
will: 257 
1)  Assess CGM measurements of:  258 
a) time in range (70- 180 mg/dl)  259 
b) percent time <70 mg/dl,  260 
c) mean glucose,  261 
d) glucose CV,  262 
2) Pump data for:   263 
a) CHO:I ratios at Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner,   264 
b) total daily insulin dose,  265 
c) total daily basal insulin,  266 
d) insulin delivery form MN to 6AM, and 6AM to MN  267 
3) We will test to see if there is any difference in pharmacodynamics  when 268 
using Fiasp®  in the home environment when they are eating their usual  [ADDRESS_998745] .   270 
4) We will also assess their glucose levels  following a high fat meal  at dinner of [ADDRESS_998746] 30 grams of fat.   272 
 273 
Part II:   Extended Use Observational Study.  [ADDRESS_998747] of  6 weeks  of closely monitored home use of the 670G pump 275 
with review of their pump and sensor downloads every 2 weeks by [CONTACT_731182] 276 
are experienced in using the 670G pump.  The goals of this phase of the study are 277 
to:     278 
1) Assess how Fiasp®  changes meal bolusing, i.e. do adjustments need to be 279 
made in their carbohydrate to insulin ratios or timing of their boluses when 280 
they are using Fiasp®   I 281 
2) Assess how Fiasp®  works with the higher fat meals that may occur with 282 
dinner, i.e. will the dinner d ose need to be divided into early and late boluses  283 
3) Assess how Fiasp®  affects infusion sites under usual care conditions, i.e are 284 
there any local reactions to Fiasp®  285 
4) Assess if  Fiasp®  becomes less effective  over the life an infusion set  (are sets 286 
changed more frequently)    287 
5) Assess how the 670G performs when Fiasp®  is used:   288 
a. Do insulin -to-carbohydrate ratios need to be modified  289 
b. Does duration of insulin action need to be modified  290 
c. Is more or less basal insulin delivered 291 
d. Does the total daily  dose change  292 
e. Does  the performance of the 670G change overnight (MN to 6AM) 293 
and during the day (6AM to MN) in terms of time in range, mean 294 
glucose and % of readings <70 mg/dL.  [ADDRESS_998748] 298 
0.3 units/kg/day and they should be eating at least [ADDRESS_998749] their origin in the Declaration 304 
of Helsinki, with the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good 305 
Clinical Practice.  306

glucose greater than 250 mg/dL.  455 
4. There is a pump occlusion alarm.  456 
 457 
Documentation of infusion site reactions:  At home they will exam the infusion set [ADDRESS_998768] 80% of the time and in automode at [ADDRESS_998769] 70% of the time.  There pump will be uploaded to a resear ch Carelink account [ADDRESS_998770] or for 469 
safety reasons such as an epi[INVESTIGATOR_731171] (unconscousnes s or 470 
seizure), >10% time <70 mg/dl, or >20% of the time over 250 mg/dl.   471 
 472 
Part 1:  Randomized,  cross- over, blinded study to assess any adaptations of 473 
the 670G pump to Fiasp® and to assess meal pharmacodynamics of Fiasp®  [ADDRESS_998771] a 2 week run- in on their usual home insulin (aspart of Fiasp® ).  477 
During the run- in, there pump will be downloaded weekly, reviewed by [CONTACT_46685] 478 
staff and adjustments will be made to their settings as needed to optimize their 479 
glycemic control.  P articipants will then be randomly assigned to 2 sequences of 480 
testing starting with either aspart or Fiasp® .  They will use each insulin for two [ADDRESS_998772] the meal 483 
pharmacodynamics testing.  They will then cross -over to the other insulin and 484 
during the second week they will repeat meal pharmacodynamics testing.  At the 485 
end of each week they will upload their 670G pump to a Carelink clinical (research) [ADDRESS_998773]  (3 days on each insulin) .  The breakfast  studies should ideally [ADDRESS_998774] work days (not holidays or weekends).  On these three days they [ADDRESS_998775] 30 grams of fat and no additional food in 493 
the evening (unless they are treating hypoglycemia).  They will  be asked to take a [ADDRESS_998776] a 495 
smart phone (Android or Apple),  they may download Calorie Mamma® or Calorie 496 
King® to help them in calculating carbohydrates, protein and fat from the meal.  [ADDRESS_998777], i.e., i f they work from 501 
Monday to Friday, this could be done on Sunday.  502 
 503 
They are blinded to the insulin and the insulin dose decisions for these meals is also 504 
not under their control since:  1)  The overnight insulin delivery is not under their 505 
control, 2) The timing of the meal bolus will be the same for all mornings, the dose 506 
will be given immediately before eating, 3) They dose of insulin will be determined 507 
by [CONTACT_731183]-to-carbohydrate ratio and they will be eating 508 
the same amount of carbohydrates each morning.  They also will not be getting a 509 
correction dose of insulin in the morning because they are using the closed- loop 510 
controller overnight.  If they required a correction dose of insulin, we will not use the 511 
data from that morning in our data analysis.   We will assess during each of these 512 
four weeks the time in- range (70- 180 mg/dl), mean glucose, CV, and time <70 513 
mg/dl.   [ADDRESS_998778] wanted to make 519 
any changes to their insulin delivery settings while using the insulin.  520 
 521 
 522 
Part 2: Extended Use O ptimization  Study   [ADDRESS_998779] is 525 
currently using Fiasp® i nsulin under their usual care.  Subjects for Part [ADDRESS_998780] after reviewing 531 
their pump/sensor data.  Recommendations for dosage changes will be recorded on [ADDRESS_998781] of using Fiasp ® on infusion sites and insulin action, 537 
they will be asked to use Fiasp®  as long as they see benefit in using it after the 538 
initial meal boluses testing is completed.  Each time they change their infusion set, 539 
we will ask them to examine the site for any bl eeding, redness or induration, and 540 
measure these changes and take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_731172].  (See 541 
Documentation of infusion site reactions).  We will have them download to a 542 
CareLink research data base every two weeks to look at their total dail y insulin 543 
requirements, glucose values, and basal insulin requirements with extended use of 544 
Fiasp® .  They will have an email sent to them every [ADDRESS_998782] observed while using Fiasp® .   546 
 547 
Documentation of infusion site reactions:  At home subjects will exam the ir infusion [ADDRESS_998783] the infusion set if:  557 
1. Their ketone level is greater than 0.6 mmol/L,  558 
2. There is evidence of infection at the infusion site 559 
3. Their blood glucose (meter) does not decrease by [CONTACT_2669] 50 mg/dL within 1 560 
hour of a correction bolus for  unexplained hyperglycemia with a blood 561 
glucose greater than 250 mg/dL.  562 
4. There is a pump occlusion alarm.  563

CHAPTER 4:  ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING AND PROTOCOL MONITORING  [ADDRESS_998784] 576 
was impaired cognitively to the point that he/she was unable to treat him or herself, 577 
was unable to verbalize his or her needs, was incoherent, disoriented, and/or 578 
combative, or experienced seizure or coma.  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_731173] 579 
with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure or coma.  If plasma glucose 580 
measurements are not available during such an event, neurological recovery 581 
attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient 582 
evidence that the event was induced by a low plasm a glucose concentration.   583 
 584 
Hyperglycemic events are recorded as Adverse Events if the event involved diabetic 585 
ketoacidosis ( DKA) , as defined by [CONTACT_333054], and had all of the following:  586 
1) Symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, nausea, or vomiting 587 
2) Serum ketones  greater than 1.6 mM,  or large/moderate urine ketones  588 
3) Either arterial blood pH <7.30 or venous pH <7.24 or serum bicarbonate <15 589 
4) Treatment provided in a health care facility  [ADDRESS_998785] been caused by [CONTACT_28033].    603 
 604 
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a three- point scale: (1) mild, (2) 605 
moderate, or (3) severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of 606 
intensity: thus a severe adverse event is not necessarily serious.  For example, 607 
itching for several days may be rated as severe, but may not be clinically serious.   608 
 609 
Adverse events that continue after the participant’s discontinuation or completion of [ADDRESS_998786]’s discontinuation or completion of the [ADDRESS_998787] occurrence that:   Results in death;  is life- 623 
threatening (a non life- threatening  event which, had it been more severe, might [ADDRESS_998788] become life- threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious adverse 625 
event) ; requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 626 
results in a disability or permanent damage w hich causes  a substantial disruption of 627 
a person's ability to conduct normal life functions ; results in  a congenital 628 
anomaly/birth defect ;  requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment or 629 
damage (Devices) ; or any other serious (Important Medical E vent) which may 630 
jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention (treatment) [ADDRESS_998789]. Buckingham will inform the IRB of serious study -related adverse events and 651 
abide by [CONTACT_28038].  652 
 653 
Potential Risks and Side Effects 654 
There may be a higher frequency of hypoglycemia immediately following a meal bolus.  655 
There may be prolonged hyperglycem ia following a high fat meal. There may be local tissue 656 
reactions at the FIASP®  infusion sites.  Infusion sites may need to be changed more 657 
frequently than usual when infusing FIASP® .  As with any insulin, there is a risk for both 658 
high and low blood glucos e levels occurring if there is a mismatch between your insulin 659 
needs and the insulin levels provided by [CONTACT_263222].  See hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia 660 
risks below.  It is very rare, but allergic reactions to insulin may occur.   661 
 662 
Risk of Hypoglycemia 663 
As with any person having insulin -dependent diabetes, there is always a risk of 664 
having a low blood sugar (hypoglycemia).  The frequency of nocturnal [ADDRESS_998790] as at home, there is the possibility of loss of consciousness or 668 
seizures (convulsions) and that for a few days you may not be as aware of [ADDRESS_998791] quickly with treatment to raise the blood sugar.  671 
 672 
Risk of Hyperglycemia 673 
As with any person having insulin -dependent diabetes, there is always a risk of 674 
having a high blood sugar ( hyperglycemia).  The frequency should be no more than [ADDRESS_998792] Risks and Treatment of Side Effects :  [ADDRESS_998793] the study staff if they see any signs of a skin 681 
reaction.  Based on the severity of local skin reaction, topi[INVESTIGATOR_900] -inflammatory 682 
medications can be used (suc h as topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826]).  683 
 684 
Other Risks 685 
Some subjects may develop skin irritation or allergic reactions to the adhesives 686 
used to secure the CGM  sensor , or to secure the insulin infusion sets for the 687 
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion ( CSII).  If these reactions occur, different 688 
adhesives or “under -tapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]” (such as with IV 3000, Tegaderm, etc.) will be tried, 689 
sites will be rotated frequently, and a mild topi[INVESTIGATOR_731174] 690 
may be required.  691 
 692 
Whenever the skin is broken there is the possibility of an infection.  The CGM 693 
sensor and insulin infusion set sites are inserted under the skin.  It is possible that 694 
any part that is inserted under the skin may cause an infection.  These occur very 695 
infrequently, but, if an infection was to occur,  oral and/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_731175] 696 
used.  The risk of skin problems could be greater if a sensor  or infusion set  is used 697 
for extended periods of time.  Therefore participants will be carefully instructed 698 
about daily inspection of their sensor and infusion set sites . 699 
 700 
Data downloaded from the CGM  sensor , insulin  pump, and the home glucose and 701 
ketone meter s will be collected for the study as measures of diabetes self - 702 
management  behaviors.  Some people may be uncomfortable with the researchers' 703 
having suc h detailed information about their daily diabetes habits .   704 
 705 
CHAPTER 5:  MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS  706 
 707 
Potential Benef its 708 
Fiasp®  may provide a more rapid onset of insulin action and improved post -prandial [ADDRESS_998794] Compensation 712 
For Part 1,  participants  will be compensated  $50 for each visit, $15 for completing 713 
weekly uploads to Carelink for a maximum payment of $245.  For part 2, subject will 714 
receive $50 for each visit , and $[ADDRESS_998795] with the 715 
investigators every two weeks they are in the extension phase.   Maximum payment 716 
of $160.   Compensation of partial participation will be prorated.   [ADDRESS_998796] will be considered for the following reasons:  1) Failure to 727 
monitor their sensor and infusion sites on a daily basis ; 2) developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] >1.0 mmol/L [ADDRESS_998797] information may also be 736 
provided to Medtronic Diabetes .   737 
 738 
Level of Risk 739 
This research proposal in children is consistent with [LOCATION_002] Department of 740 
Health and Human Services, Protection of Human Subjects, Subpart D, Section 741 
46.404  (Research not involving more  than minimal risk ).   742 
 743 
Planned Duration of the Entire Study 744 
Planned duration of the entire study will be 6  months.   745 
  746 
CHAPTER 6:  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  747 
 748 
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_731176]®  in 749 
the 670G hybrid closed -loop system.   These studies are not statistic ally powered.  750 
 751 
In the blinded cross -over studies (P art I) we will use data obtained during the 752 
second week of each arm to compare the following measurements  using a mixed- 753 
effects model accounting for crossover study design of the study with the sequence 754 
of trea tment nested within the patient : 755 
a) time in range (70- 180 mg/dl)  756 
b) percent time <70 mg/dl,  757 
c) mean glucose,  758 
d) glucose CV,  759 
e) total daily insulin dose,  760 
f) total daily basal insulin,  761 
g) insulin delivery form MN to 6AM, and 6AM to MN   [ADDRESS_998798] to see if there is any difference in pharmacodynamics when using 764 
Fiasp® in the home environment when they are eating their usual breakfast.   [ADDRESS_998799] will be assessed by 766 
measuring the peak gluc ose concentration (C max), time to C max (tmax), and estimated [ADDRESS_998800] bolus (Time 0) will be 771 
set to 0  mg/dL  for each meal, and the remaining CGM values were adjusted [ADDRESS_998801] meals are excluded 775 
from postprandial analysis if: 1) the rat e of change was greater than 0.3mg/dL/min [ADDRESS_998802], 2) subjects gave a subsequent bolus prior to [ADDRESS_998803] bolus, or 3) subjects deviated from their typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] [ADDRESS_998804] prandial glucose to reach 16 0 mg/dL 781 
beyond 1 hour of eating.  The peak glucose will also be recorded.  782 
 783 
During t he 6 week  optimization study (Part II)  we will use data obtained during the [ADDRESS_998805] two weeks of the study (before data was reviewed and changes made by [CONTACT_941] 785 
investigators) to data obtained during the last two weeks of the [ADDRESS_998806] for data that is not 788 
normally distributed:  789 
a) time in range (70- 180 mg/dl)  790 
b) percent time <70 mg/dl,  791 
c) mean glucose,  792 
d) glucose CV,  793 
e) total daily insulin dose,  794 
f) total daily basal insulin,  795 
g) insulin delivery form MN to 6AM, and 6AM to MN  796 
h) CHO:I ratios at breakfast, lunch and dinner  797 
i) Active insulin time  798 
j) Number of days between infusion set changes  799 
k) Erythema (mm) and induration (mm) at infusion sites  when they are changed  800 
l) Average daily insulin, and mean glucose for each day of infusion set wear  801 
m) Number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_731177] [ADDRESS_998807] month 803

1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND/OR  SCHEMA  
 
Peptide -receptor  radionuclide  therapy  (PRRT)  with radiolabeled  somatostatin  (sst) analogs  was 
developed  in the 1990s  (1), and is now frequently  used  in Europe  for the treatment  of metastatic  
neuroendocrine  tumors  (NETs)  (2-4). However,  not all patients  respond  well to PRRT.  In 
addition,  there  are serious  and potentially  irreversible  side effects,  most  notably  chronic  renal  
failure  due to renal  excretion  of the radiopeptides  (2, 5). Thus,  there  is a clear  need  to develop  
new ligands  with higher  tumor  uptake  and a more  favorable  tumor -to-kidney  dose  ratio.  
To address  this need,  members  of our group  have developed  radiolabeled  somatostatin  
receptor  type 2 (sstr2)  antagonists  (6-10). Preclinical  studies  have indicated  that these  
compounds  bind to significantly  more  receptor  sites than the sstr agonists  currently  used  for 
PRRT  (6). This finding  was confirmed  by [CONTACT_874670] -derived  tumor  
samples  (11), which  demonstrated  a more  than four-fold increase  in the ex vivo binding  of the 
somatostatin  receptor  antagonist  177Lu-DOTA -BASS  when  compared  to the somatostatin  
receptor  agonist  177Lu-DOTA -TATE.  In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_874653] 111In-labeled   DOTA -BASS,  
we have shown  that this ligand  detects  significantly  more  metastases  of NETs  in patients  than 
the current  standard  111In-DTPA -Octreotide  (9). We have also performed  a preliminary  clinical  
study  comparing  the dosimetry  of a 177Lu-labeled   therapeutic  sstr antagonist  177Lu-JR11  with 
177Lu-DOTA -TATE,  an sstr agonist  frequently  used  for PRRT.  In this study,  the antagonist  
demonstrated  on average  a three -fold higher  tumor  dose  and a two-fold higher  tumor -to-kidney  
ratio (10). 
The goal of this study  is to evaluate  the sstr antagonists,  68Ga-DOTA -JR11  and 177Lu-DOTA - 
JR11  as a pair of diagnostic/therapeutic  radiopharmaceuticals  (theranostics)  in patients  with 
NETs.  Specifically,  we will (i) assess  biodistribution  and tumor  uptake  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  and 
compare  the sensitivity  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  PET with 111In-DTPA -Octreotide  SPECT  (the 
current  clinical  standard);  (ii) determine  tumor  and normal  organ  doses  after administration  of 
177Lu-DOTA -JR11;  and (iii) obtain  preliminary  data on tumor  response  to 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  
 
We will include  [ADDRESS_1221349] undergo  a PET/CT  with 68Ga-DOTA -JR11.  Patients  with sufficient  tumor  uptake  
of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  will be offered  therapy  with 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  Patients  with no 68Ga- 
DOTA -JR11  positive  disease  will be replaced.  We expect  this to be the case  in 10% or less of 
the patients.  Therapy  will be preceded  by a dosimetric  study  to determine  the amount  of 
radioactivity  that can be safely  administered.  The study  will be performed  under  an MSKCC   
IND.

3.[ADDRESS_1221350]-in-class  radiolabeled  sstr antagonists.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_874654],  the risk of failure  for the clinical  trial is low, since  the 
effectiveness  of radiolabeled  sstr agonists  is well known.  The key difference  between  
antagonists  and agonists  is the higher  uptake  and retention  of antagonists  in NETs  , resulting  in a 
higher  radiation  dose  to the tumors  and a lower  radiation  dose  to the kidneys.  This is likely to 
translate  in a safer  and more  effective  therapy  of NETs  if our study  confirms  the higher  uptake  
and retention  of sstr antagonists  predicted  from preclinical  and pi[INVESTIGATOR_874655]  (6, 9, 10). 
NETs  are frequently  perceived  to represent  a rare group  of malignancies,  but this is not entirely  
correct.  There  are about  15,000  new cases in the U.S. per year—about  twice  the number  of 
Hodgkin’ s lymphomas  (12)—but the prevalence  of the disease  is much  higher.  More  than 
100,000  patients  are currently  living  with NETs  in the U.S. (14), a higher  number  of patients  
than those  with pancreatic  and stomach  cancer  combined  (12). Accordingly,  there  is a clear  
need  to improve  the diagnosis  and therapy  of NETs.  This is especially  true in the U.S.,  where  
PRRT  is not available  and sstr2 -based  imaging  is still performed  with a low-affinity  sstr ligand  
(111-In-DTPA -octreotide,   OctreoScan®) (15). 
3.2 Somatostatin  Receptor -based  Imaging  and Therapy  of NETs  
 
Tumor  cells originating  from neuroendocrine  tissues  generally  express  high levels  of G 
protein -coupled  receptors,  which  can be used  as targets  for therapeutic  interventions  
(16). The most  commonly  overexpressed  class  of receptors  are the somatostatin  
receptors  (sstrs),  specifically  the somatostatin  receptor  subtype  2 (sstr2)  (17). Using  
autoradiographic  studies  with radiolabeled  somatostatin -28 and Tyr3-octreotide  (an sstr 
ligand  with predominant  binding  to sstr2),  somatostatin  receptors  were  found  in more  
than 87% of patients  with carcinoids of the gut or lung (54 of 62 patients)  and in 100%  of 
the pancreatic  NETs  (15 of 15). Homogenous  expression  of sstr2  was found  throughout  
the tumor  tissue  and the level of expression  was high,  compared  to surrounding  normal  
tissues  (17). 
Binding  of somatostatin  to sstr2  leads  to internalization  of the receptor  (18) and inhibition  
of adenylate  cyclase  activity  (19). This inhibits  the secretion  of various  gastrointestinal  
hormones  including  gastrin,  serotonin,  and vasoactive  intestinal  polypeptide.  The 
somatostatin  analogs  octreotide  and lanreotide  are therefore  effective  for controlling  
symptoms  of hormone -producing  NETs  (16). In addition,  they have anti-angiogenic  
effects  and can inhibit  the proliferation  of NETs  (16, 19). Treatment  with octreotide  or

lanreotide  has been  shown  to improve  progression -free survival  in two randomized  trials 
(20, 21). Monthly  injections  of a long-acting  formulation  of octreotide  (octreotide  LAR)  
improved  progression -free survival  of well differentiated  NETs  to 14.3 months  compared  
to 6 months  for placebo  (20). Lanreotide  improved  progression -free survival  from 18 
months  to more  than 24 months  (21). 
The first clinically  used  radiolabeled  somatostatin  receptor  ligands  for imaging  of NETs  
were  123I-Tyr3-octreotide  and 111In-DTPA -octreotide  (OctreoScan®), which  is still in broad  
clinical  use in the U.S. (15) Studies  in the 1990s  have indicated  that planar  and single  
photon  computed  emission  tomography  (SPECT)  with 111In-DTPA -octreotide  improves  
the detection  of hormone  active  NETs  and the staging  of metastatic  NETs  compared  to 
CT and MRI (22). Due to the progress  of CT and MR technology,  the sensitivity  of both 
modalities  for detection  of NETs  has significantly  improved.  In a retrospective  review  of 
[ADDRESS_1221351]  pi[INVESTIGATOR_874656] 6% more  asymptomatic  bone  lesions  (23). The key limitations  of 111In-DTPA - 
octreotide  are the need  for delayed  imaging  [ADDRESS_1221352]-injection  because  
of slow blood  clearance;  the relatively  high radiation  dose  caused  by [CONTACT_874671]-life of 111In; and the low spatial  resolution  of SPECT.  
Because  of their high uptake  in NETs,  radiolabeled  sstr ligands  can be used  not only for 
imaging,  but also for treatment.  To this end, H.R. Mäcke  and his group  have  developed  
a variety  of octreotide  analogs  that can be labeled  with beta-emitting  radiometals  
(Table  1). Various  combinations  of peptides,  chelators,  and radionuclides  have been  
tested  in the last decade,  but by [CONTACT_874672] 90Y- 
DOTA -3Tyr-Octreotide  (90Y-DOTA -TOC)  and  177Lu-DOTA -3Tyr-Octretate  (177Lu-DOTA - 
TATE).  Table  [ADDRESS_1221353] been  made  between  the two peptides   
or between  PRRT  and other  forms  of targeted  therapy  of NETs.  Considering  the 
heterogeneity  of NETs  and the difficulties  in reproducibly  assessing  tumor  response  in 
patients  with extensive  metastatic  disease,  comparing  the response  rates  reported  by  
[CONTACT_874673].  Nevertheless,  the objective  response  rates  are 
markedly  higher  than reported  in clinical  trials with octreotide  LAR (7), everolimus  (21), 
and sunitinib  (22). This indicates  that PRRT  is more  likely to induce  significant  tumor  
shrinkage  than these  other  forms  of targeted  therapy.  Furthermore,  objective  responses  
to PRRT  were  not only observed  in pancreatic  NETs,  but also in midgut  and lung 
carcinoids  (19, 20). For these  tumors,  there  are currently  no FDA-approved  agents  that 
can induce  significant  tumor  shrinkage  (23, 24). Furthermore,  the duration  of response  to 
PRRT  can be remarkably  long. Kwekkeboom  et al. report  a median  progression -free 
survival  of 40 months  from the start of treatment  (19).

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1221355] shown  that sstr-expressing  tumors  demonstrate  higher  
uptake  of radiolabeled  sstr antagonists  than sstr agonists  (6). In mice  bearing  HEK-sstr2  
tumors,  tumor  uptake  of the antagonist  111In-DOTA -BASS  was twice  as high as the 
uptake  of the potent  agonist  111In-DTPA -TATE,  despi[INVESTIGATOR_874658] - 
BASS  for sstr2  is lower  than that of DTPA -TATE  (Table  1). Importantly,  antagonists  not 
only demonstrated  higher  peak uptake,  but were  also retained  longer  within  the tumors.  
This unexpected  finding  is probably  explained  by a markedly  higher  number  of binding  
sites for sstr antagonists  as compared  to agonists.  Scatchard  analysis  showed  more   
than ten times  the number  of binding  sites for 111In-DOTA -BASS  (Bmax  = 354±14  pM) 
than for 111In-DTPA -TATE  (Bmax  = 23±1.0  pM). Ex vivo studies  with human  tumors  (12) 
have also demonstrated  markedly  higher  binding  of sstr2 antagonists  than of sstr2  
agonists  (11). This suggests  that antagonists  bind to more  receptor  confirmations  
(activated  and inactive)  than agonists.  
Based  on these  encouraging  data,  the study  PI [INVESTIGATOR_13698]  a pi[INVESTIGATOR_874659]2 receptor

(OctreoScan®) (9). These  two ligands  have a similar  affinity  for sstr2  (Table  1). In this 
study,  111In-DOTA -BASS  detected  25/28  lesions  (89.3%),  whereas  111In-DTPA - 
Octreotide  detected  only 17/28  (60.7%)  lesions  (P = 0.013).  In pair-wise comparisons,  
111In-DOTA -BASS  showed  significantly  higher  tumor  and lower  renal  uptake  than 111In- 
DTPA -Octreotide  at [ADDRESS_1221356]-injection,  resulting  in up to 5.2 times  higher  tumor -to- 
kidney  uptake  ratios  (9). This study  demonstrated  for the first time the feasibility  of using  
sstr2  antagonists  for imaging  of NETs  and suggested  that sstr antagonists  may enable  
the delivery  of higher  radiation  doses  to NETs  than sstr2  agonists.  
The affinity  of 111In-DOTA -BASS  for sstr2  is lower  than for the therapeutically  used  
peptides  90Y-DOTA -TOC or 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  (Table  1). In our subsequent  studies,  we 
therefore  used  a new somatostatin  antagonist,  DOTA -JR11  (Table  1), which  
demonstrates  a subnanomolar  affinity  for sstr2  (Table  1). Labeling  with Lutetium  did not 
affect  the affinity  for sstr2.  In contrast,  labeling  with Gallium  unexpectedly  decreased  the 
affinity  (Table  1). Nevertheless,  PET and biodistribution  studies  in mice  bearing  sstr2 - 
expressing  xenografts  demonstrated  slightly  higher  tumor  uptake  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  
than the high-affinity  sstr2  agonist  68Ga-DOTA -TATE  (7). This indicates  that the lower  
affinity  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  for sstr2  is compensated  by [CONTACT_874675] 68Ga-DOTA -TATE.  Since  68Ga-DOTA -TATE  is clinically  clearly  
superior  to 111In-DTPA -Octreotide  (28-30), these  findings  are promising  for the clinical  
use of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  for NET imaging.

Table  3. Characteristics  of patients  treated  with 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  
 
 
 
177Lu-DOTA -JR11  was studied  in four patients  with progressive,  unresectable  NETs  at 
the University  of Freiburg  in [LOCATION_013].  Renal  function  was impaired  in all patients,  thus 
limiting  the amount  of 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  that could  be safely  administered.  These  
patients  were  offered  to undergo  a dosimetry  study  with 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  and 177Lu- 
DOTA -JR11.  If this study  indicated  a higher  tumor  radiation  dose  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  
and an acceptable  renal  radiation  dose,  patients  were  offered  treatment  with 177Lu- 
DOTA -JR11  (10). Table  3 summarizes  the clinical  characteristics  of the patients.  
After infusion  of an arginine/lysine  solution  (kidney  protection),  patients  were  injected  
with 1-2 GBq 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  and 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  (crossover  design  in an interval  
of three  weeks).  No acute  adverse  effects  of 200 μg 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  were  observed.

patients.  
 
 
 
In pair-wise comparisons,  177Lu-DOTA -JR11  showed  significantly  higher  tumor doses  
than 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  (10.1  ± 8.2 vs. 3.2 ± 3.4 Gy/GBq,  P < 0.001).  Importantly,  the 
mean tumor-to-kidney dose ratio was more than two-fold higher for 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 
than for 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  (6.0 ± 5.6 vs. 2.5 ± 2.3, P < 0.01).  As a result,  all four 
patients  were  treated  with 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  (up to 15.2 GBq in two-three  cycles  every  
three  months):  two patients  showed  a partial  response,  one patient  had stable  disease,  
and one patient  progressed  (Table  3). These  results  are remarkable  given  the low dose  
of 177Lu administered  and the advanced  stage  of these  tumors.  Follow -up laboratory  
evaluations  showed  only a mild increase  of serum  creatinine  and mild, temporary  
myelosuppression.

One patient  with a high-grade  NET of 
the bladder  died due to progressive  
disease,  whereas  the other  patients  are 
well, with no evidence  of progressive  
disease  (Table  3). 
One patient  experienced  a short  
epi[INVESTIGATOR_8738] ﬂush just after injection  of 
177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  Another  patient  
developed  grade  3 thrombocytopenia  
(41,000/mm3), which  completely  
recovered  within  eight weeks  after 
injection  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  (Table  3). 
There  was no relevant  decrease  of 
tubular  kidney  function  within  12 months  
of follow -up (mercaptoacetyltriglycine  
clearance,  136 mL/min/1.73  m2  vs. 127 
mL/min/1.73  m2). Also,  creatinine  levels  
did not change  significantly  before  and 
after treatment  (approximately  [ADDRESS_1221357]-treatment;  1.32 mg/dL  vs. 
1.39 mg/dL)  (10). 
 
The radiation  dosimetry  of 177Lu-DOTA - 
JR11  in comparison  to 177Lu-DOTA - 
TATE  for the four patients  studied  is

4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1221358] undergo  PET/CT  imaging  with 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  to determine  eligibility  
for treatment  with 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  (Figure  1). Only patients  that have 68Ga-DOTA - 
JR11  uptake  greater  than that in the liver in at least one metastasis of more  than [ADDRESS_1221359]  the 
kidney  and the bone  marrow  to be the two dose  limiting  organs.  The dose  limit for the 
kidney  will be 23 Gy as suggested  by [CONTACT_874676]    (https://www.astro.org/Clinical -Practice/Quantec/QUANTEC.aspx ). We

Approval date: [ADDRESS_1221360]  the therapeutic  activity  if necessary.  
The clinical  intention  is that the combined  dosimetry  and therapy  administrations  of 
177Lu-DOTA -JR11  will deliver  the lower  of the two dose  limits  (23 Gy to kidney,  1.5 Gy to 
red marrow).  The administered  activity  for the pre-therapy  dosimetry  study  will be fixed 
(1.85  GBq = 50 mCi).  Thereafter,  the balance  of activity  that is predicted  to deliver  the 
lower  of the two dose  limits  will be calculated.  This will be split into two equal  amounts  to 
be delivered  approximately  [ADDRESS_1221361] treatment  results  in 
estimated  doses  that differ  from the initial  predictions,  the second  treatment  will be 
adjusted  (either  decreased  or increased)  so that the intended  dose  limits  are achieved.  
Note that administered  activities  listed  will be +/- 10% as per institutional  practice.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
68Ga-DOTA-JR11 PET/CT Imaging 
 
Following  informed  consent,  eligible  patients  will first undergo  a PET/CT  study  with 
approximately  150-200 MBq of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  as described  in section  9.1. 
Normal  and altered  biodistribution  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  
 
68Ga-DOTA -JR11  is expected  to demonstrate  a similar  biodistribution  as other  
somatostatin  receptor  ligands,  such  as 111In-Octreotide,  68Ga-DOTA -TATE,  and 177Lu- 
DOTA -JR (10). Pi[INVESTIGATOR_111756],  adrenal  glands  and the pancreatic  head  are expected  to 
demonstrate  focal uptake  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11.  In addition,  we expect  diffuse  tracer  
uptake  by [CONTACT_4852], spleen  and kidneys  as well as excretion  of activity  to the bladder  with 
no or low hepatobiliary  excretion.  
Altered  biodistribution  is defined  as any deviation  from the expected  biodistribution,  
specifically  focal uptake  in lesions  or absence  of focal uptake  in organs  with known  
physiologic  expression  of somatostatin  receptors  (pi[INVESTIGATOR_111756],  adrenal  glands  and 
pancreatic  head).  Another  sign of an altered  biodistribution  is predominantly  
hepatobiliary  excretion  of the tracer.  
 
Image  Interpretation  
 
PET/CT  scans  will first be interpreted  without  information  on the results  of other  imaging  
modalities.  Any lesions  with focal radiotracer  uptake  not explained  by [CONTACT_874677]2  
expression  will be interpreted  as metastatic  disease.

Approval date: 09 -Sep-2020

The likelihood  of malignancy  will be described  by a 5-point  Likert  scale.  Following  the 
blinded  read of the 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  PET/CT  scan,  all recorded  findings  will be 
correlated  with the results  of 111In-Octreotide  SPECT,  and CT/MRI  performed  as part of 
standard  clinical  care.  The relative  sensitivity  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  will be determined  by 
a consensus  of the clinical  investigators  and systemic  analysis  of all available  imaging  
studies  and follow -up. We will consider  a score  of 3 or above  malignant  and a score  of 1 
or 2 as benign  for the purposes  of this protocol.  
177Lu-DOTA-JR11 Dosimetry 
 
If 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  uptake  by [CONTACT_874678] a diameter  of more  than 2 cm is less 
than the physiologic  radiotracer  uptake  by [CONTACT_4852], no further  imaging  and therapy  will 
be performed  as part of the study,  as it is unlikely  that patients  with this low radiotracer  
uptake  will benefit  from PRRT  (2). 
All other  patients  will undergo  a dosimetric  study  with 1850 MBq (less  than 100 μg 
peptide)  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  This amount  of radioactivity  is required  in order  to obtain  
images  with sufficient  count  statistics  to reliably  quantify  radiotracer  uptake  in tumor  
lesions  and organs  (the abundance  of imagable  gamma  emissions  for 177Lu is only 
11%).  Replacing  177Lu with another  radiometal  such  as 111In carries  the risk of a different  
tumor  uptake,  because  the radiometal  can have a significant  impact  on the affinity  of 
sstr2  antagonists  (Table  1). 
177Lu-DOTA-JR11 Therapy 
 
From  the results  of the dosimetry  study,  we will determine  the balance  of activity  of 
177Lu-DOTA -JR11  that can be administered  without  exceeding  the radiation  dose  limits.  
This activity  will be split into two equal  amounts  to be delivered  in two cycles,  
approximately  three  months  apart.  However  if the first treatment  cycle  results  in 
estimated  doses  that differ  from the predictions,  the activity  administered  for second  
treatment  cycle  will be adjusted  so that the dose  limits  are maintained.  Based  on the 
preliminary  clinical  data (table  5), we anticipate  that the typi[INVESTIGATOR_874660] 177Lu-DOTA - 
JR11  administered  over the full course  of dosimetry  and treatment  will be approximately  
1.85,  5.4, and 5.4 GBq (50, 147, and 147 mCi, respectively).  After each  therapy  cycle,  
patients  will be followed  clinically  for three  months.

vendors,  accompanied  by a certificate  of analysis.  The investigational  products  are delivered  to 
Nuclear  Pharmacy  and compounded/dispensed  by a pharmacist  per physician  order.  The 
Nuclear  Pharmacy  operates  in full compliance  with the applicable  FDA and local regulatory  
bodies.  
To ensure  administration  within  the expi[INVESTIGATOR_799466],  [68Ga]-DOTA -JR11  and [177Lu]-DOTA -JR11  
are delivered  to Nuclear  Pharmacy  labeled  with a [ADDRESS_1221362]  in accordance  with the physician  order.  
The chemical  structure  of 68Ga/177Lu-DOTA -JR11  is shown  in Figure  2. DOTA -JR11  is a high- 
 
 
affinity  antagonist  of somatostatin  at the somatostatin  type 2 receptor  (sstr2).  This is the subtype  
of somatostatin  receptors  most  commonly  overexpressed  in GEP-NET tumors.  DOTA -JR11  has 
low affinity  for other  somatostatin  receptors  (Table  1). 
This study  will be performed  under  an FDA approved  IND for 68Ga- DOTA -JR11  and 177Lu- 
DOTA -JR11.  The synthesis,  reagents,  testing  and composition  of the final product  68Ga/177Lu- 
DOTA -JR11  are described  in detail  in the chemistry,  manufacturing  and controls  (CMC)  section  
of the IND application.  The synthesis  method  is based  on the published  previous  human  
experience  at the University  of Freiburg  (10). 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  is administered  as an 
intravenous  microdose  (<100  µg peptide  mass)  and will contain  approximately  150-200 MBq 
radioactivity.  In the dosimetric  study,  177Lu-DOTA -JR11  is given  at a dose  of 1,850 -6,000  MBq 
(<100  µg peptide  mass).  The therapeutic  radioactive  dose  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  will be 
determined  by [CONTACT_874680].  Based  on the preliminary  clinical  data described  above,  we 
anticipate  that the typi[INVESTIGATOR_874661] 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  administered  over the full course  of 
dosimetry  and treatment  will be approximately  1.85,  5.4, and 5.4 GBq (50, 147, and 147 mCi, 
respectively).  A lower  mass dose  than 100 µg of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  is technically  feasible  for the 
imaging  studies,  but may lead to systematic  differences  in the biodistribution  of 68Ga-DOTA - 
JR11  and 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  Therefore,  we will use a similar  peptide  mass  for both 68Ga-DOTA - 
JR11  and 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.

9.0 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION PLAN 
Drug Accountability 
The investigator  is obliged  to keep sufficient  documentation  of the delivery  and use of the 
investigational  product.  These  records  will include  administration  date/time,  calibration   
date/time,  quantity,  patient  code,  lot number,  and date of destruction.  The investigator  should  
maintain  records  that adequately  document  that the patients  were  provided  the dose  specified  in 
the protocol  and reconcile  the medication  received  for the study.  The label of each  vial will 
contain  the patient  code  and lot number,  and patient  and radiopharmaceutical  information  will  
be entered  in the radiopharmacy  drug accountability  forms.  The investigator  may assign  some   
or all of his/her  duties  regarding  drug accountability  to an appropriate  individual  such  as a 
pharmacist  or nuclear  medicine  technician,  under  the supervision  of the investigator.  
9.1 PET/CT  Imaging  
 
No specific  patient  preparation  is required  before  68Ga-DOTA -JR11  injection.  One 
intravenous  catheter  (Hep-Lock)  will be placed  by [CONTACT_874684].  Vital signs  will be obtained  prior 
to 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  injection.  
Images  will be corrected  for attenuation  and scatter  and adjusted  for system  sensitivity,  
and will provide  parametric  data in terms  of standardized  uptake  values  (SUV)  (= MBq 
found/gm  tissue/  MBq injected/gm  body mass).  
In order  to provide  reproducible  clinical  data,  we will acquire  all 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  
PET/CT  scans  on GE PET/CT  690 and 710 scanners  (or a newer -generation  scanner),  
providing  reconstructed  images  with the same  spatial  resolution.  Intravenous  injection  of 
68Ga-DOTA -JR11  will be given  as a bolus.  In all patients  a PET-CT scan  extending  from 
top of skull to mid-thigh  will be performed  to determine  the biodistribution  60-[ADDRESS_1221373] scan  for attenuation  correction  and anatomical  
localization.  Total  acquisition  time for these  studies  will be less than 40 min. 
In 6 patients  (3 female  and 3 male  patients)  additional  imaging  studies  will be performed  
to obtain  data on the dosimetry  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11.  These  studies  will include  a 
dynamic  PET study  of the upper  abdomen  including  (parts  of) the left ventricle,  liver and 
kidneys  to study  the initial  distribution  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  for 25 minutes  after injection.

This will be followed  immediately  by a PET/CT  scan  extending  from the top of the skull 
to mid-thighs.  The total duration  for patients  undergoing  these  enhanced  studies  for 
radiation  dosimetry  is approximately  85 minutes.  Radiation  doses  will be calculated  
using  OLINDA/EXM  using  the same  principles  described  in section  9.2 for 177Lu-DOTA - 
JR11.  
9.2 Dosimetry  Study  
 
The dosimetry  study  will begin  within  5 weeks  of completion  of PET imaging.  An infusion  
of 2,000  mL renal  protectant  solution  will be initiated  approximately  30 minutes  before  
and continued  for 3.5 hours  after the 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  injection  to inhibit  tubular  
reabsorption  of the radiopeptide  (25). This solution  contains  21 g lysine  and 20 g 
arginine  and will be infused  at constant  rate of 500 ml/hr.  The same  amino  acid infusion  
schedule  will be used  during  treatment  with 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  Patients  may receive  [ADDRESS_1221374]  Ondansetron  I.V. and/or  other  antiemetics,  as clinically  
indicated,  prior to the start of the amino  acid infusion  in order  to prevent  nausea  and 
vomiting,  potentially  caused  by [CONTACT_874685].  In case  of persistent  
nausea/vomiting  despi[INVESTIGATOR_874663].  In such  situations,  the scan  at 1-[ADDRESS_1221375]/CT  study  of the abdomen,  including  kidneys  and sites of known  disease,  to be 
performed  at 18-[ADDRESS_1221376]  (ROI)  analysis  of conjugate  view whole  
body scans  supplemented  by [CONTACT_874686] -CT scan.  Activity -time curves  for heart  
contents  and red marrow  will be generated  from the measured  blood  values.  Activity - 
time curves  will be integrated  (either  analytically  or numerically  as appropriate)  to yield 
residence  times  used  as input to the FDA-approved  dosimetry  software  package  
OLINDA/EXM,   which  will then generate  absorbed  dose  estimates  to normal  tissues.  
Additional   dosimetry  analysis  will include:  (1) lesion  dose  estimates  based  on ROI data 
assuming  only self-dose;  and (2) if differential  retention  in cortical  and medullary  sub- 
regions  of the kidney  is observed,  the SPECT  images  will be used  to quantify  partitioning  
and enable  sub-regional  absorbed  dose  estimates.  
Blood  Samples  
 
Blood  samples  will be drawn  at approximately  5-[ADDRESS_1221377]-injection  and, subsequently,  at the times  of 
imaging.  These  data will be used  to determine  the clearance  of the radiotracer  from the 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -161 A(7)  
Approval date: 09 -Sep-2020  
Page  22 of 39  
  
 
blood  and calculate  the radiation  dose  to red marrow.  Specifically,  absorbed  dose  to red 
marrow  is calculated  as the sum of self-dose  from activity  in the marrow  itself (estimated  
from the activity  concentration  in blood)  and cross -dose  from activity  in other  organs  and 
from the generalized  remainder  of body.  The calculation  is performed  using  the 
OLINDA/EXM   dosimetry  software  package.  For red marrow  we make  the assumption,  
common  in radiation  dose  calculations  for radiolabeled  small  molecules,  that the activity  
concentration  in the marrow  is the same  as that measured  in blood.  A standard  value  
(taken  from OLINDA/EXM)   is used  for the total red marrow  mass  or, if the patient  is 
significantly  heavier  than “standard  human”,  a rescaled  value  is used,  based  on the ratio 
of patient  mass  to standard  mass.  The total activity  in the red marrow  is integrated  with 
respect  to time to derive  the AUC which  is then divided  by [CONTACT_874687].  This,  together  with all the other  residence  times  
is input into OLINDA/EXM  to generate  absorbed  radiation  doses.  
9.3 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  Therapy  
 
9.3.1  Treatment Cycle  1 
 
Cycle  1 will begin  within  6 weeks  of the completion  of dosimetry  study.  Patients  will be 
given  an intravenous  injection  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  over 5-10 minutes.  An infusion  of 
2,000  mL renal  protectant  solution  will be initiated  approximately  30 minutes  before  and 
continued  for 3.5 hours  after the 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  injection  to inhibit  tubular  
reabsorption  of the radiopeptide  (25). This solution  contains  21 g lysine  and 20 g 
arginine  and will be infused  at constant  rate of 500 ml/hr.  Imaging  and blood  sample  
collections  will be performed  at the same  times  as described  for the dosimetry  study  and 
radiation  doses  calculated.  
The activity  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  administered  per cycle  will not exceed  200 mCi (7.4 
GBq)  independent  from the radiation  dose  to the kidneys  and/or  red marrow.  
9.3.2  Treatment Cycle  2 
 
Cycle  2 will be performed  10-14 weeks  after cycle  1 if the following  criteria  are fulfilled:  
 
• No Grade  2 or higher  platelet  toxicity  
• No other  grade  3 or 4 hematologic  toxicity  
• < 40% increase  of serum  creatinine/decrease  of creatinine  clearance  
• Other  grade  [ADDRESS_1221378] not 
resolved  by [CONTACT_159753],  the patient  is considered  as having  excessive  toxicity  and will not 
receive  a second  cycle  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  therapy.  
Treatment  will be administered  as for cycle  1 with the possibility  of a revised  activity  of 
177Lu-DOTA -JR11,  depending  on the doses  calculated  for the previous  cycle.  Infusion  of 
renal  protectant  solution  will be administered  as described  for treatment  cycle  1. The 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -161 A(7)  
Approval date: 09 -Sep-2020  
Page  23 of 39  
  
 
same  set of imaging,  blood  sampling,  and radiation  dose  calculations  will be performed.  
Patients  will be monitored  for adverse  events.  Between  the two therapy  cycles,  bi-weekly  
tests  of CBC,  creatinine,  and liver enzymes  will be collected  for three  months.  Within  10 
(+/- 5) days before  administration  of the second  cycle,  patients  will be assessed  for 
progression  by [CONTACT_969],  clinical  examination  and repeat  imaging  studies  (using  the same  
imaging  modality  as for the pre-therapeutic  imaging  study).  Patients  with disease  
progression  according  to RECIST  1.1 will not receive  a second  cycle  of 177Lu-DOTA - 
JR11.  
Patients  with progression  of disease  between  cycle  1 and 2 will be replaced.  The activity  
of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  administered  per cycle  will not exceed  200 mCi (7.4 GBq)  
independent  from the radiation  dose  to the kidneys  and/or  red marrow.  
9.4 Follow -up 
 
For each  patient  the same  imaging  modality  (completed  after cycle  1) will then be used  
for all follow -up imaging  studies  every  [ADDRESS_1221379] scan  or MRI imaging  (as is routine  for metastatic  NET patients  at MSK).  Uniform  
assessment  of response  will be provided  for each  patient,  i.e. one patient  may be 
followed  by [CONTACT_874688], but not both.  NET patients  are infrequently  lost to 
follow -up. However,  should  there  be relocation,  or if a patient  chooses  to be followed  by 
[CONTACT_874689],  every  effort  will be made  to 
identify  the follow -up evaluation  and ensure  that all notes  are sent to MSK.  Patients  will 
be contact[CONTACT_874690] (every  three  months)  to determine  
disease -free survival  and overall  survival,  and the investigators  will obtain  appropriate  
source  documentation  from external  providers  to corroborate  these  assessments.  Every  
effort  will be made  to follow  all patients  for survival  every  three  months  until death,  or the 
cut-off date for the last protocol -mandated  analysis,  whichever  occurs  first. Any patients  
deemed  lost to follow  up, proceed  with another  treatment  or pass away  while  on-study,  
they will be taken  off-study  at that time.  
Patients  removed  from the study  for unacceptable  adverse  events  will be followed  until 
resolution  as well as for progression  of disease.  
Patients  receiving  any portion  of the therapeutic  dose  will be included  in the assessment  
of response.

9.5 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_14123]  
 
A 5% probability  of excessive  toxicities  is considered  acceptable  and a 20% probability   
as unacceptable.  Excessive  toxicities  are defined  as treatment  related  toxicities  leading  
to an unacceptable  delay  in completing  the [ADDRESS_1221380] 10 patients,  we will stop the study.  If not, we accrue  10 more  patients  for a total of  
20 patients.  If we see more  than 2 within  the 20 (cumulative,  including  the [ADDRESS_1221381] 10) we will also stop the study  for excessive  toxicity.  If the true 
probability  of toxicity  is 5% then the probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_874664] 12%.  If the true 
probability  of toxicity  is 20% then the probability  of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_874664] 83%.

11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Detection  and Treatment of Infusion  Reactions  
 
The following  measures  will be taken  to detect  and treat an infusion  reaction:  
 
Nurses  or physicians  will monitor  patients  for the duration  of the PET/CT,  dosimetry  and treatment  
periods.  EKG and pulse  oximetry  will be continually  monitored,  and blood  pressure  measurements  
will be performed  every  15-20 min.  For dosimetry  and treatment  monitoring  will start with the 
infusion  of the renal  protectant  solution  and will be continued  for total of approximately  4 h. Body  
temperature  and blood  glucose  levels  will be measured  before  the start of the infusion  and 
approximately  4 h later.  For the PET/CT  study  these  measurements  will be performed  before  
injection  and after completion  of the imaging  studies.  
To our knowledge,  hypersensitivity  reactions  to somatostatin  agonist  or antagonists  have not been  
reported  in the literature.  If the event  of symptoms  of a hypersensitivity  reaction  the patient  will be 
treated  the same  way as an acute  reaction  to radiologic  contrast  media  according  to the guidelines  
of the Department  of Radiology  
(https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/radiology/Documents/Contrast%20Reaction%20policy.pdf ).   Briefly,  
mild to moderate  reactions  will be treated  with diphenhydramine  25-50 mg PO or IV. Patients  with a 
severe  reaction  will receive  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]  0.3 mg IM or 0.1-0.3 mg slowly  IV. Patients  will also receive  
oxygen  via nasal  cannula  or face mask.  
In the unlikely  event  that the microdose  of [68Ga] or [177Lu]-DOTA -JR11  causes  a carcinoid  
syndrome,  patients  will be treated  with octreotide  and ranitidine.  In the case  of hypoglycemia  in 
patients  with an insulin  secreting  neuroendocrine  tumor,  glucose  will be administered  intravenously.  
All these  drugs  will be readily  available  at the time of radiopeptide  therapy.  
Toxicity  to Endocrine  Glands  
 
Although  somatostatin  receptors  are expressed  by [CONTACT_874691],  previous  studies  have 
not shown  clinically  significant  effects  after treatment  with a cumulative  dose  of up to 800 mCi 177Lu- 
DOTA -TATE  (31). In order  to detect  and monitor  endocrine  toxicities  by 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  the 
following  parameters  will be determined  before  the dosimetry  study,  before  the second  treatment  
cycle,  and 1 year after the dosimetry  study:  Serum  gonadotropi[INVESTIGATOR_2115]  (LH, FSH),  estradiol,  testosterone,  
free thyroxine  (FT4),  triiodothyronine  (T3), thyroid -stimulating  hormone  (TSH),  glycosylated  
hemoglobin  (HBA 1C) and ACTH  as previously  described  for 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  (31). HBA1 1C   will not 
be measured  in patients  who are diabetic  at the time of inclusion  into the study.  An endocrinologist  is 
an investigator  of this study  and any abnormalities  will be discussed  with the endocrinologist.  
Supplementation  and/or  management  of the endocrine  abnormalities  (if any) will be under  the 
discretion  of the study  endocrinologist.  Since  it is unlikely  that alterations  will be significant,  no dose  
reductions  are built into the protocol  at the present  time.  Should  we find consistent  and/or  significant  
abnormalities,  we will inform  our IRB, FDA and amend  the protocol  accordingly.

Assessment  for Delayed Toxicity 
 
Delayed  toxicity  assessment  at one year will be conducted.  Delayed  effects  on red bone  marrow,  
renal  and hepatic  functions  will be assessed  (11-13 months  after the dosimetry  study)  by [CONTACT_1962]’  
interim  history,  physical  examination,  complete  blood  counts  (white  blood  cell count  with differential,  
hemoglobin,  MCV,  hematocrit,  platelet  count),  serum  creatinine  and creatinine  clearance  with 
Cockcroft  Gault  formula,  BUN,  uric acid, albumin,  bilirubin,  AST,  ALT, GGT,  ALP, LDH,  sodium  
potassium,  calcium, glucose,  and urinalysis).  
Risks  
 
68Ga-DOTA-JR11 PET/CT Scans 
 
As part of this scan,  radiation  is delivered  both from the 68Ga and from the low-dose  CT scan,  which  
is performed  as part of the PET/CT  for attenuation  correction  and co-registration.  Although  any 
exposure  to ionizing  radiation  has the potential  to cause  some  harm  to tissue,  the radiation  
exposures  in this study  are comparable  to the low-level exposures  associated  with common  
diagnostic  procedures  such  as CT scanning.  There  remains  a low theoretical  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a 
cancer  at some  point later in life as a result  of the radiation  exposure  received  in this study.  This risk 
is much  smaller  than the clinical  risks posed  by [CONTACT_102]’s  current  cancer.  In general  the radiation  
doses  from the 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  PET/CT  scan  are much  less (typi[INVESTIGATOR_897]  < 1%) of those  from 177Lu- 
DOTA -JR11  therapy.  
177Lu-DOTA-JR11 Therapy 
 
Because  of the low injected  mass  of the peptide  (<= 100 µg), which  is 1,000  times  less than the 
therapeutic  dose  of somatostatin  analogs  (21), we do not expect  pharmacologic  effects  by [CONTACT_874692] -JR11.  However,  side effects  may occur  as a consequence  of the beta and 
gamma  radiation  emitted  by 177Lu. The toxicity  of 177Lu-labeled  DOTA -TATE,  which  has a similar  
biodistribution  to 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  (10), has been  studied  in 504 patients  with neuroendocrine  
tumors  (3). Patients  received  up to 27.8-29.6 GBq (750 to 800 mCi),  usually  in four treatment  cycles,  
with treatment  intervals  of 6 to 10 weeks.  Hematologic  toxicity  grade  3 or 4 occurred  after 3.6%  of 
administrations.  62% of patients  experienced  grade  1 (i.e. minimal,  per WHO criteria)  temporary  hair 
loss. Serious  adverse  events  that were  likely attributable  to the treatment  were  myelodysplastic  
syndrome  in three  patients  and temporary,  nonfatal  liver toxicity  in two patients.  There  were  two 
cases of renal  insufficiency,  but both were  considered  by [CONTACT_874693] 177Lu- 
DOTA -TATE  therapy.  One patient  with extensive  liver metastases  died of hepatic  failure  after five 
weeks  of therapy.  Because  this patient  experienced  a similar  deterioration  due to rapid  tumor  growth  
after his previous  course  of chemotherapy,  the liver failure  was considered  more  likely tumor  growth - 
related  rather  than radiation -induced.  Two other  patients,  both of whom  had multiple  liver 
metastases,  had temporary  rises  in serum  ALT, AST,  and bilirubin  concentrations.  In both patients,  
this condition  resolved  without  causative  treatment,  and both resumed  treatment  at half doses  
uneventfully.  Lastly,  myelodysplastic  syndrome  (MDS)  occurred  in four patients.  In one patient,  
previous  chemotherapy  with alkylating  agents  was the more  likely cause  of MDS.  In the other  three  
patients,  MDS  was diagnosed  two to three  years  after the last treatment  and was considered  as 
probably  treatment -related  (3).

A higher  rate of side effects  has been  observed  in patients  treated  with the somatostatin  analog  90Y- 
DOTA -TOC (2). A total of 1,109  patients  were  treated  with two to four cycles of 3.7 GBq/m2 of 90Y- 
DOTA -TOC.  Grade  3 or 4 hematologic  toxicity  was observed  in 12.8%  of the patients  (n = 142).  
Leucopenia  was observed  in 67 patients,  while  anemia  was observed  in 11 patients,  and 
thrombocytopenia  in 64 patients.  Of the total sample,  2 developed  myeloproliferative  syndromes,  
and 1 experienced  acute  myeloid  leukemia.  Another  2 patients  developed  tumor  lysis syndrome  
directly  after treatment  with reversible  kidney  failure,  and 102 patients  (9.2%)  experienced  
permanent  renal  toxicity  (67 patients  grade  4; 35 patients  grade  5). The higher  rate of renal  toxicity  
is probably  related  to the higher  energy  of beta radiation  emitted  by 90Y, which  leads  to a higher  
radiation  dose  to the glomeruli  (31). 
In the planned  study,  the risk of side effects  will be minimized  by [CONTACT_874694]-infusion  of amino  acids  to 
decrease  renal  uptake  of the JR11  (25). In a study  of 90 patients  treated  with 90Y-DOTA -TOC (co- 
infused  with Aminosyn  II amino  acid solution  containing  approximately  28 g of both lysine  and 
arginine),  temporary  grade  III/IV  renal  toxicity  was observed  in 3 patients.  No significant  change  in 
creatinine  levels  were  observed  at one year after the start of therapy  (27). The amino  acid infusion  
may cause  nausea  and vomiting.  Other  side effects  are unlikely  in the selected  patient  population  
with adequate  renal  and hepatic  function.

Reduction  of the risk of radiation  exposure  to patient’s  family  member,  the general  public  and 
health  care workers  
Radiation  dose  rates  measured  in previous  MSKCC  pi[INVESTIGATOR_874666]  177Lu 
labeled  compounds  have shown  average  dose  rates  within  an hour after administration  to be 0.23

m. Patient -specific  instructions  indicating  how many  days to implement  radioactive  precautions  will 
be determined  according  to the limits  of 10 CFR Part 35 (US Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission)  using  
the methodology  of NUREG -1556,  Vol. 9, Appendix  U (US Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission),  and 
guidance  in NCRP  Report  #155  (National  Council  on Radiation  Protection  and Measurements).

in written  and verbal  form to each  patient  and the healthcare  providers  associated  with the patient’s  
care.  Patients  will be required  to acknowledge  receipt  of these  instructions.  The instructions  will 
specify how long patients  should  sleep  in a separate  bed, when  they are able to return  work,  how 
long to maximize  distance  from other  adults,  pregnant  women  and children,  and how long to avoid  
extended  time in public  places.  While  in the medical  facility,  lead shielding  (either  permanent  or 
portable)  will be provided  as required  based  on dose  rate measurements  to maintain  dose  rates  at 1 
m from the patients  to < 2 mR/h.  
 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Tumor  response  will be monitored  by [CONTACT_874696].  Tumor  
response  will be classified  according  to RECIST  1.1. Confirmatory  scans  for partial  response  will not 
be performed.  Changes  in tumor  diameters  for all lesions  that can be well identified  on the 
SPECT/CT  images  of the dosimetry  study  will be recorded  and correlated  with the calculated  
radiation  doses.  
 
 
13.0 CRITERIAFOR REMOVAL FROM STUDY 
 
Patients  will go off-study  if any of the following  criteria  are met: 
 
• Any treatment  related  CTCAE  grade  4 toxicity  
• Unacceptable  treatment  delay  due to delayed  or irreversible  toxicity  
• Patient  request  
 
No replacement  of patients  discontinued  for excessive  toxicity  is allowed.  
 
Participation  in the study  is strictly  voluntary,  and patients  will have the right to withdraw  from the 
study  at any time.  If a patient  chooses  to withdraw,  he or she must  inform  the investigator  
immediately.  In addition,  the investigator  has the right to terminate  participation  of any patient  at any 
time if it is deemed  in the patient’s  best interest.  Patients  will be replaced  if they are removed  from 
the study  and data obtained  are inevaluable.   The reason  and circumstances  for premature  
discontinuation  will be documented  in the patient’s  medical  records.  Possible  examples  for reasons  
of premature  withdrawal  include  withdrawal  of consent,  SAE or intolerable  AE, progression  of 
disease,  or any other  medical  illness  at the investigator’s  discretion.  If a patient  progresses  between  
cycle  [ADDRESS_1221390]-in-man study  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11;  there  are only limited  human  data on the dosimetry  
of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11.  The main  goal is therefore  to ensure  safety  and tolerability,  and characterize  
the adverse  event  profile.  In addition  descriptive  data on the diagnostic  accuracy  of 68Ga-DOTA - 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -161 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1221391]  an accrual  rate of 1-2 patients  per month.  
The safety,  tolerability,  and AE will be summarized  using  descriptive  statistics.  With 20 patients  
treated  adverse  event  rates  can be estimated  to within  +/- 10%,  assuming  the true rate is 25%,  
although  estimation  based  on the observed  data will use exact  binomial  confidence  intervals  and the 
length  of confidence  intervals  will vary. All patients  receiving  a therapeutic  dose  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  
will be included  in the safety  data analysis.  We will also capture  those  patients  who do not receive  a 
second  therapeutic  dose  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  of and record  the reasons  for not proceeding  to cycle  
2. 
Assessment  of biodistribution  will be descriptive  by [CONTACT_874697].  
Sensitivity  of PET with 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  to stage  metastatic  NETs  in comparison  to the clinically  
used  sstr agonist  111In-DTPA -octreotide  will be assessed  on a lesion  basis.  Reference  standard  will 
be determined  by a consensus  of the clinical  investigators  and systemic  analysis  of all available  
imaging  studies  and follow -up. Sensitivity  will be estimated  using  the observed  proportion  of positive  
for a given  modality  using  a variance  inflation  factor  to adjust  for multiple  lesions  in the same  patient  
to compute  the confidence  intervals  With an anticipated  4 lesions  per patient  and a putative  
intrapatient  correlation  of 0.1 these  sensitivity  can be estimated  to within  +/- 10%.  
177Lu-DOTA -JR11  dosimetry  is described  in Section  9.2. 
 
Secondary  Objectives  
 
For estimation  of radiation  doses  after administration  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11,  we are assuming  a 
standard  deviation  of 8.2 Gy/GBq  for the tumor  dose  after the administration  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  
and a standard  deviation  of 0.8 Gy/GBq  for the kidney  dose  (as observed  in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]).  Under  
these  assumptions,  we should  be able to determine  the tumor  dose  with a standard  error of the 
mean  of 1.83 Gy/GBq  as well as the kidney  dose  with a standard  error of the mean  of 0.18 Gy/GBq.  
We consider  these  as sufficiently  accurate  for the planning  of larger  clinical  studies. 
The correlation  between  tumor  uptake  of 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  and tumor  dose  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  will 
be estimated  using  rank-based  methods  (e.g. Spearman  correlation)  and reported  in a descriptive  
way. 
Overall  response  rate (ORR)  according  to RECIST  1.1 and median  progression -free and overall  
survival  will be estimated  and reported  with 95% confidence  intervals.  As a measure  of tumor  
response  we will report  the ORR  at 6 months  after administration  of the second  treatment  cycle.  
We will generate  Kaplan -Meier  curves  to describe  and calculate  the progression -free survival  (PFS),  
which  is defined  as the period  elapsing  between  the date of initiation  of therapy  and the date of  
either  disease  progression  or date of death,  whichever  is earlier.  This applies  even if a given  patient  
is withdrawn  from treatment  due to toxicity  or discontinues  treatment  and is withdrawn  prior to 
documentation  of progression;  all patients  will be included  in this statistic. We will also perform  
Kaplan -Meier  curves  to describe  and calculate  the overall  survival  (OS),  defined  as the interval  
between  the time of initiation  of therapy  and the date of death  from any cause.  Patients  who are 
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -161 A(7)  
Approval date: [ADDRESS_1221392] known  to be 
alive.  
Duration  of stable  disease  (SD) will be summarized  and measured  from the start of treatment  until 
the criteria  for progression  are met, taking  as reference  the smallest  measurements  recorded  since  
the treatment  started.  All patients  will be included  in this analysis.  A subset  analysis  of patients  with 
stable  disease  at the initiation  of therapy  will be performed.  
Patients  who progress  between  cycles 1 and 2 will be replaced.  This is to ensure  that we will be able 
to study  toxicity  and tolerability  in 20 patients  who finish  full course  of therapy.  Patients  who are 
replaced  due to progression  will still be included  in the analysis  of secondary  endpoints  (ORR,  PFS 
and OS) so the sample  size for some  of the analyses  may exceed  20. We expect  progression  during  
therapy  to be rare. In a study  of metastatic  GEP-NETs  treated  with 177Lu-DOTA -TATE,  progression  
during  therapy  occurred  in only 37 out of 458 patients  (8%) (3).

16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The data and safety  monitoring  (DSM)  plans  at MSK were  approved  by [CONTACT_874698]  (NCI)  in September  2001.  The plans  address  the policies  set forth by [CONTACT_874699] , which  can be found  at http://cancertrials.nci.nih.gov/clinicaltrials . The DSM  
plans  at MSK were  established  and are monitored  by [CONTACT_40138].  The 
MSK DSM  plans  can be found  on the MSK Intranet  at:  
https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/clinresearch/Documents/MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safet   
y%20Monitoring%20Plans.pdf  
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by [CONTACT_46463],  safety,  
and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  (e.g.,  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff  
education  on clinical  research  quality  assurance)  and departmental  procedures  for quality  
control,  and two institutional  committees  are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees  are as follows:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  
Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  
Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III clinical  trials;  both of which  report  to the MSK Research  Council  
and Institutional  Review  Board.  
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH-sponsored,  
in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  group,  etc.) will be addressed,  
and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of protocol  activation.

17.1 PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS 
 
This study  will be conducted  in compliance  with the protocol,  GCP  guidelines  established  by [CONTACT_589818],  and the ethical  standards  set forth in the Declaration  of 
Helsinki  2004  (available   at: www.laakariliitto.fi/e/ethics/helsinki.html ). 
The PET/CT  scan  with 68Ga-DOTA -JR11  is diagnostic  in nature  and, based  on our extensive  clinical  
experience  with diagnostic  radiotracers  in general  and diagnostic  radiolabeled  peptides  in particular,  
will involve  administration  of the labeled  peptide  at mass and activity  levels  far below  those  that 
would  induce  any toxic or other  pharmacological  effects.  However,  as with any exposure  to radiation,  
even at the diagnostic  levels  to be used  in this study,  there  is a very low, theoretical  risk of radiation -
induced  cancer  at some  later point in life. The projected  normal -organ  radiation  doses  to subjects  in 
this study  are determined  and included  in our protocols  and are well in the range  of typi[INVESTIGATOR_874667],  such  as CT. The risk of subsequent  radiation - induced  
cancer  is explicitly  included  in the Informed  Consent  forms  for the studies  included  in this protocol.  
In addition,  the subjects  who will be enrolled  in this clinical  investigation  will be exclusively  patients  
with metastatic  neuroendocrine  cancers.  The additional  radiation  doses  associated  with the PET/CT  
scans  involved  in this study  will typi[INVESTIGATOR_589792]  a small  increment  in their "lifetime"  exposures  by 
[CONTACT_874700],  and more  importantly  radiopeptide  therapy.  
For the therapeutic  part of the study,  we also do not expect  pharmacologic  effects  because  the 
amount  of peptide  is again  very low when  compared  to the therapeutic  dose  of somatostatin  analogs  
(<= 100 µg every  3 months  vs. 120 mg every  4 months).  However,  the therapeutic  beta radiation  
presents  a risk. Lutetium -[ADDRESS_1221394]  DOTA -TATE.  Since  the biodistribution  and 
dosimetry  of 177Lu-DOTA -JR11  is similar  to 177Lu-DOTA -TATE  (10) (Table  5), we therefore  expect  
the same  radiation  exposure.

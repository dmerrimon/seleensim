Lay Summary:   The loss of muscle mass and strength due to aging leads to serious health problems 
for older  adults. Muscle health can be improved by [CONTACT_23063], but some people improve their 
strength substantially, whereas others improve little. The reason for this variation is unknown. This 
study will  investigate whether function of the immune system influences how well people respond to 
exercise.   Older veterans who participate will have their muscle size, strength, and function  measured 
periodically for almost a year.   Participants will drink a nutritional supplement or placebo daily and 
complete a 36 session strength training  program. Participants will be vaccinated for tetanus and donate 
small amounts of blood and muscle tissue during the study so that immune function can be compared 
to muscle outcomes during training and during a long- term follow -up.  The study  results should 
increase our understanding of the negative effects of aging on muscle and will  possibly lead to better 
strategies for muscle maintenance and rehabilitation for older adults.  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]

 Key Points  of the Supplementation and Exercise Protocol  
• Rationale:   Exercise is clearly able to affect immune function.  However, the proposed study will 
attempt to modulate immune function by [CONTACT_23064] .  
• Importance:   Targeting the immune system with nutritional supplementation may be the advantage 
needed for an older veteran to successfully use exercise training to maintain or restore the muscle 
mass, strength, and function that is necessary for personal independence.  
• Double- blind r andomized placebo -controlled trial:   groups consuming nutritional supplement 
(Muscle Armor)  or placebo (Kool -Aid) will be compared to answer four key questions : 
o Do 2 -weeks of supplementation improve immune function?  
o Does supplementation during 12- weeks of progressive high- intensity resistance training 
boost adaptations to exercise at the whole body or cellular level? 
o Does continued supplementation for 26- weeks after completion of exercise training promote 
the retention of the gains in muscle size, strength,  and function?  
o Do measures of immune function correlate with cellular and whole- body measures of muscle 
health after exercise training and detraining ? 
• Procedures to be completed by [CONTACT_23065] (age 60- 80, N=50)  
o Telephone pre- screening with required waiver of HIPAA and permission for verbal consent  
o Enrollment screening after written consent and HIPAA authorization 
o Approximately 50- 60 research visits over approximately one year  
o Data collection from CPRS problems and medication lists  
o Orange- flavored supplement or  placebo consumption mixed in water twice daily (~42 
weeks)  
o Supervised High-Intensity Resistance Exercise (two sessions prior to training to measure 
response to unaccustomed exercise) 
o Supervised High-Intensity Resistance Exercise Training (36 sessions in ≥  12 weeks)  
o Post-training follow -up (~26 weeks)  
o Blood draw (9x)  
o Muscle biopsy (5x)  
o Gait and balance testing (4x)  
o TDAP  Vaccination (1x)  
o Thigh CT Scan (3x)  
o Compensation (~$1500):  $20 per visit, completion bonus for exercise training ($100) and entire study ($300).  $[ADDRESS_22114]  
Objective:  The study will examine the influence of immune function in older adults on improvement of  
muscle mass, strength, and function by [CONTACT_23066]. The maintenance of those benefits during 
long term follow -up will also be examined. This objective will be accomplished by a double- blind 
randomized placebo- controlled trial of a nutritional supplement (Muscle Armor) which evidence 
suggests can i mprove immune function, promote muscle growth, and counteract muscle loss. The 
study premise is that aging results in decreased ability of the immune system to respond to stimuli such 
as exercise. The study proposes  that the supplement will improve muscle health by [CONTACT_6561] a shift in 
immune function of older adults from a pro-inflammatory state towards a state which supports muscle 
growth and maintenance.  
Research Plan:  The study will randomize veterans (age 60- 80, N= 50) to participate in the supplement 
or placebo groups in a three phase study. The phases of participation correspond to the three specific 
aims.   Aim 1 will determine if 2 -weeks of supplementation improves immune function. Humoral immune 
function will  be assessed as the response to vaccination. Innate immune function will be measured as 
systemic and  cellular responses to acute resistance exercise that our previous studies indicate are 
affected by [CONTACT_23067]. Aim  2 will determine if supplementation during 36 sessions  of progressive high -
intensity resistance training boosts  improvement in muscle size (CT scan), strength, and function (gait 
and balance).  Muscle adaptations at the  cellular levels will also be measured. Aim 3 will determine if 
continued supplementation for 26 -weeks after  completion of exercise training promotes the retention of 
the gains in muscle size, strength, and function.  Multivariable testing will then be used to compare the 
results between Aims 1, 2, and 3 to determine whether  or not immune function is correlated with 
muscle adaptation to training or detraining.  
Methods:   Participants will undergo nine blood draws and five muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis 
over the course of the study so that the effects of the supplement on immune function and cellular 
adaptations to  traini ng can be measured. Three of the blood draws will be used to assess the antibody 
response to the  tetanus, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccine.  Muscle and blood will be collected before 
and after a bout of  exercise conducted before and after the 2- weeks of supplementation prior to 
training. Immune function will be measured using the blood based on pro- and anti -inflammatory 
cytokine levels, the balance between specific T -cell subpopulations, and the proliferative capacity of 
mononuclear cells.  Immune function will be  measured in muscle based on macrophage content of 
specific cytokines and growth factors. Our previous  study showed that these muscle measures strongly 
correlate with size and strength gain after training. Key  signaling pathways including nuclear factor -k B 
and PI3 kinase will also be measured. The fifth biopsy will be collected post -training to measure 
adaptation at the cellular level based on changes in number of satellite cells and myonuclei and fiber 
size. Hypotheses related to these measures will be tested with 80% power to  detect at least 0.[ADDRESS_22115] deviations difference in means between the supplement and placebo groups.  
Clinical Relevance:   Exercise is clearly able to affect immune function. However, the proposed study 
will attempt to modulate immune function and determine the effects on exercise outcomes. The study 
will also  examine detraining, an important issue for older adults, that is usually omitted from training 
studies. Thus,  the study will potentially advance our understanding of the mechanisms of muscle gain 
and loss in older  adults, but more importantly, the study will evaluate a nutritional intervention as a 
complement to exercise for  supporting muscle health during aging. Targeting the immune system may 
be the advantage needed for an older Veteran to successfully maintain or restore the muscle mass, 
strength, and function that is necessary  for personal independence.

using a nutritional supplement (Muscle Armor, Abbott Labs) 
that is proposed to have beneficial effects on both immune 
function and skeletal muscle.  The trial will determine if  the 
supplement  is able to improve immune function, boost 
muscle adaptation to resistance training, and support 
retention of the exercise- derived benefits (Figure 1).   The 
supplement ingredients, methylbutyrate, arginine, and glutamine  (HMB, Arg, and Gln) , are used by [CONTACT_8497] -lifting 
enthusiasts to boost gains from resistance training and 
clinically to counteract muscle wasting.  Thus, an exercise 
trial evaluating Muscl e Armor could identify a means to 
make a significant impact on muscle function, health, and quality of life  for older adults .  However, t he mechanism s by 
[CONTACT_23068].   Thus, in addition to the potential for direct benefit 
to aging Veterans, conduct of the proposed trial will allow 
the mechanistic relationships between immune function and adaptation to exercise training and detraining to be invest igated.

Our findings indicate that various measures of immune function decrease with aging [1;2].  Aim [ADDRESS_22117] shown that muscle

boosts the response could be quite valuable to certain individuals .  Aim [ADDRESS_22118]-training maintenance of

 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
1. Muscle loss due to aging leads to serious health problems for older adults .  Effective 
strategies for rehabilitation are critical to the health of older adults  since m uscle loss decreases 
functional ability  and increases risk for falls and fractures, disability, and mortality  [6;7].   
2. Resistance training improves muscle mass, strength, and function in older adults but the 
response varies between individuals.   Resistance training can be safely performed with benefit 
to even chronic heart failure and nursing home patients  [8], but the magnitude of benefit varies [9].  
This suggests that older adults with less adaptive potential will have  greater muscle loss due to 
aging and that rehabilitation will be less effective.  Thus, a better understanding of the effects of 
aging on muscle health  may be needed to design interventions that c omplement resistance training.  
3. The ability of older adults to maintain or improve muscle health may be associated with 
systemic indicators of the effects of aging on immune function.   Age-related decline in 
functions of the immune system results in a weaker response to vaccination [10], diminished ability 
of immune cells to proliferate, and problems that specifically affect muscle.  Acute increases in 
cytokines after exercise initiate muscle repair  [11], but with aging inflammation becomes chronic 
and detrimental.  For example, inflammation induces muscle catabolism  in rats  [12] and is  
associated with sarcopenia and functional decline in humans  [13].  Thus, systemic differences in 
immune parameters  between older adults may reflect ability to improve or maintain muscle health.   
4. Cells of the immune system residing in  muscle play a central role in  the developi[INVESTIGATOR_23017].   Macrophages transition between three functional phases in 
response to exercise.  Phase 1 is an inflammatory response mediated by [CONTACT_23070] [14].  After this initial cleanup, Phase 2 is a 
down- regulation of inflammation by [CONTACT_14181]-inflammatory cytokines  so that secondary damage does not 
occur .  This allows the muscle to become conducive to growth [15].  In the regenerative Phase 3, 
macrophage arginine metabolism increases and promotes cell growth [16] and g rowth factors are 
produced to further stimulate myogenesis [17].  As muscle adapts to training, macrophage function  
may then become  dedicated to producing growth factors required for hypertrophy.    
5. Evidence suggests that the immune system and macrophages influence muscle mass and 
strength during health and aging.   In animals, extermination of muscle macrophage s decreases 
the ability of muscle to hypertrophy and recover from atrophy  [18-2 0].  The effects were related to 
decreased macrophage provision of growth factors, myogenesis , and muscle fiber growth [18;20] .  
In humans, muscle mass and strength gain are also associated with markers of myogenesis [21] 
that are diminished in older adults [22].  Inflammation may have contributed to those findings.  In a 
training study of older adults, individuals consuming anti -inflammatory drugs gained significantly 
more muscle mass and strength than those consuming placebo [23].  Our studies also indicate that 
immune function influences the response to exercise.  Muscle size and strength gained by [CONTACT_23071] s trong ly correlated with muscle expression of specific cytokines 
and growth factors [3].  Muscle macrophage content in those older adults was also strongly 
correlated with muscle adaptation and growth factor levels.  These findings support the idea that 
consumption of a nutritional supplement that either dampens a negative or boosts a positive e ffect 
of inflammation and immune function could benefit older adults during exercise training.  
6. Three signaling pathways may be involved in the regulation of macrophage function, 
production of cytokines and growth factors and their effects on muscle cells.   In response to 
pro-inflammatory cytokines and NFkB signaling [24] , macrophages may produce cytokines which 
block signaling that increases transcription of ubiquitin ligases  which control protein degradation 
and lead to muscle atrophy [25].  However, in response to anti -inflammatory cytokines and STAT3 
signaling, m acrophages [24], macrophages produce factors that support tissue growth and block

 atrophy [26].  Examination of these pathways in human muscle is limited and thus warrants further 
investigation to define their role in the context of aging, exercise, and nutritional supplementation.               
7. A nutritional supplement that affects immune function may improve the ability for older 
adults to benefit from  resistance training.   Muscle Armor  contains arginine, glutamine,  and 
methylbutyrate.  The se ingredients slow cachexia and increas e muscle mass in both cancer and 
AIDS p atients [5;27] .  They are also used to increase strength in combination with exercise for 
sports performance [28-30].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_23018].  
Methyl butyrate alter s protein synthesis, but it also enhances immune function in animals [31-33].  
Glutamine and arginine are considered immuno -nutrients that affect immune cell  phenotype, 
proliferation, and production of cytokines  [34-37].  The study will determine if the effects of the 
supplement on muscle health are mechanistically related to its ability to modulate immune function. 
8. Significance:  Nutritional intervention that targets the immune system may complement 
resistance exercise in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_23019].  Exercise is 
clearly affect s immune function [38].  However, it is unk nown if immune function affects  individual 
benefit from exercise  because studies have not altered immune function and determined the effects 
on training outcomes.  The proposed study will attempt to do this using a supplement that support s 
muscle health .  The study will also examine detraining, an important issue, that is often omitted 
from exercise studies [39].  Thus, the study has the potential to advance our understanding of the 
mechanisms of muscle gain and loss in older adults, but more importantly, the study will evaluate a nutritional intervention as a complement to exercise for improving  muscle health in older adults . 
 
PRELIMINARY STUDIES 
The study will determine the relationship between immune function and adaptation to training  and 
nutritional supplementation in older adults.  The expectation that improv ing and maintaining  muscle 
size, strength, and function will be correlated with immune function is based on the following findings . 
1. Muscle of older adults, as compared to young adults, has increased expression of cytokines at baseline and lacks cytokine induction in response to acute resistance exercise [2]. 
2. Muscle of older adults contains fewer macrophages than muscle of younger adults . The number of 
macrophages that display markers of inflammation or anti- inflammation and growth increase for 
young but not older adults  in response to exercise .  Interestingly , macrophages that display the 
marker of anti-inflammation and growth outnumber macrophages displaying the marker of 
inflammation  by [CONTACT_23072]  [2]. 
3. Muscle of older  adults, compared to young er adults, has lower expression of genes associated with 
tissue growth and remodeling at rest and in response to a bout of resistance exercise [40]. 
4. Muscle gene expression associated with inflammation and growth  is strongly correlated with muscle 
size and strength gained from training [3].  The number of macrophages in muscle is also correlated 
with size and strength gain,  and gene expression suggesting that macrophage provision of 
cytokines, and growth and remodeling factors contributes to muscle adaptation to training.    
5. The effects of aging on muscle macrophages are consistent with the immunosenescence o f 
immune cells outside of muscle.  For example, aging decreases the ability of peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells  and T- cells to proliferate and respond to pro -inflammatory stimul i [1].

 Finding  1:  Muscle of older adults, as compared to young adults, has increased expression of 
cytokines at baseline and also lacks cytokine induction in response to acute resistance exercise [2].   
Study :  Pro- and anti -inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels were measured in muscle of y oung (22- 41 
yrs) and older (66- 80 yrs) males (N=17 each ) at rest and [ADDRESS_22120], muscle of the older  adults 
possessed higher (3.3- fold, P=0.001) the pro -inflammatory cytokine, IL1β, than muscle from the 
young er adults  (Figure 2A).  Anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL1RA (P=0.003) and IL10 (P=0.03) were also 
higher in the old than young (not shown).  After exercise, levels of the IL1 β increased (~2 -fold, 
P=0.006) in the young muscle, but did not change in the old ( Figure 2B).  IL10 (P=0.02) also increased 
after exercise but only for the young subjects . 
Conclusions:   Pro- and anti -inflammatory muscle cytokine expression is regulated  differently  in older 
adults at baseline and in response to exercise.  These results were found for older adults who were 
quite  healthy and only ~20% weaker than the young group.  Thus, the overt effects on muscle of this 
altered cytokine expression were not obvious  though  the results implied that muscle of older adults may 
contain immune cells (i.e. macrophages) in a state of chronic low -grade inflammation. If this is true, 
then it is possible that the chronic inflammation could adversely affect levels of growth factors that 
control muscle hypertrophy which could hinder the adaptive response to resistance exercise training.   
These possibilities were investigated and the results are presented here in Findings [ADDRESS_22121] (dots) and medians (bar) are shown.   
 
 
Finding 2:  Muscle of older adults contains fewer macrophages than muscle of younger adults; and in 
both age groups, at baseline and in response to exercise, the majority of macrophages display a phenotype consistent with anti -inflammation and growth rather than inflammation [2] . 
Study :  Macrophages in muscle from the young and older males of Finding 1 were counted based on 
markers of inflammation  (CD11b) or  anti-inflammation and growth (CD163)  [16;41;42] .  At rest , muscle 
of the older adults contained approximately half as many CD11b+ cells (P=0.003, Figure 3A) as 
younger muscle and tended (P=0.07, Figure 3B) to contain fewer CD163+ cells.  72 hrs after a bout of 
exercise, the numbers of macrophages did not increase in the older adults, but both CD11b+ (55%, P=0.04) and CD163+ cells increased in younger adults.  Interestingly, muscle contained 8 -times as 
many CD163+ cells as CD11b+ cells (P<0.0001).  
Conclusions:   Muscle of older adults did not contain more macrophages with an inflamed phenotype 
than muscle of young adults.  Muscle m acrophages predominantly showed the anti -inflammation and

macrophages were similar though the age- associated difference was only a trend.  Median and inter -quartile 
range are shown.  Significance (P<0.05) between (*) and within (#) groups is shown.  
 
 Finding 3:   Aging alters muscle expression of genes which function in tissue growth and remodeling 
both at rest and in response to a bout of resistance exercise [40]. 
Study :  The muscle of the young and old adults of Findings [ADDRESS_22123] mRNAs.  The mRNAs included genes 
that function in cellular stress, signaling, tissue remodeling or growth.  Fou r mRNAs (IGF1, CNTF, 
MMP2, and IGFBP5) were significantly greater in younger muscle than older muscle both before and 
after exercise (P<0.05).  The median differences ranged from 60% to 230% (shown for IGF1 in Figure 
4A).  Two mRNAs showed a significant (P<0.05) response to exercise.  However, the response was 
found to be significant in only younger adults after statistical correction for multiple comparisons was 
applied.  In younger adults, median TIMP1 levels increased 200% ( Figure 4B) and GDF8 levels 
decreased by 50% after exercise (not shown).  
Conclusions:  Gene expression profiling identif ied a number of muscle mRNAs whose levels  are 
affected by [CONTACT_23073].  The results included the two most commonly studied regulators 
of muscle mass, IGF1 and GDF8 (also known as myostatin) [43;44]  as well as  other mRNAs about 
which little is known in the contexts of exercise, aging, and human muscle.  Thus, in addition to the 
factors discussed here in Findings 1 through 3, growth factors such as CNTF and factors that may 
participate in tissue remodeling, namely the metalloproteinase MMP2 and its inhibitor TIMP1, are also 
candidates that require investigation as regulators of muscle mass.  Finding 4 will present the results of 
a training study for older adults that sought to determine the relationship between the molecular and 
cellular variables discussed and gains in muscle size and strength.

Finding  4:  Muscle expression of genes associated with inflammation, growth, and remodeling is 
strongly correlated in older adults with muscle size and strength gained from resistance training [3]. 
Study :  Older (61- 78 yrs) m en (N=3) and women (N=5) completed 12 -week s of high-intensity 
progressive resistance training of the thigh muscles.  Biopsies were collected prior to training and  
analyzed by [CONTACT_5203] -time PCR and immunohistochemistry .  Muscle size change range from -1% to +18%  
while s trength increase ranged from  +8% to +6 5%.  Strength gain correlated (R > 0.7, P < 0.05) with 
expression of mRNAs encoding cytokines (IL1β, IL10, IL1RA), growth (CNTF, GDF8, IGF1, IGFBP5) 
and remodeling factors (MMP2, TIMP1) .  The result is shown for IGF1 in Figure 5A.  Strength gain also 
corre lated with the number of CD163+ macrophages in muscle with the exception of one outlier (Figure 
5B).  Similar results were found for muscle size.          
Conclusions:   Macrophages and mRNAs associated with inflammation, growth, and remodeling  
appear to be involved with adaptation to exercise in older adults.  However, these variables could be 
covariates affected by [CONTACT_23074].   The proposed study will allow 
investigation into whether macrophage function or immune function in general influences adaptation to 
resistance training in older adults.

 Findings 5:   Aging decreases the ability of immune cells to respond to stimuli  that cause cell 
proliferation and inflammation [1]. 
Study :  The effects of aging on immune cells  were examined in two experiments .  Experiment 1 
compared the T -Cell response to a pro -inflammatory stimulus using blood of young (N=5, 21- 30 yrs) 
and old (N=5, 65- 80 yrs) donors [45].  Cells were treated  with TNFα and NFkB binding to its promoter  
was measured.  Binding  was lower  (P<0.05, 250% versus 340%) in older than younger adults (Figure 
6A).  Experiment 2 examined the ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to proliferate in 
response to a phorbol ester and calcium ionophore.   After 5 and 8 days of treatment respectively, 84% 
and 92% of young cells had undergone at least one cell division ( Figure 6B); whereas only 52% and 
63% of older cells had divided (not shown).  
Conclusions:   Immunosenescence appears to universally  affect mononuclear cells , T-cells, and 
muscle macrophages by [CONTACT_23075]- inflammatory and exercise 
stimuli .  The proposed study will  determine the extent to whi ch immune function external to muscle 
reflect s the ability of muscle macrophages to respond to exercise or the ability of older adults to benefit 
from exercise training.

Findings 6 and 7: Pi[INVESTIGATOR_23021], Muscle Armor, is 
able to decrease systemic inflammation and improve the response to vaccination in older adults.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_16116]:   A double- blind placebo- controlled pi[INVESTIGATOR_23022] d whether the nutritional 
supplement, Muscle Armor, affects  immune function.  Since inflammation is associated with loss of 
muscle during aging and wasting disease, it was hypothesized that Muscle Armor functions, in part, by 
[CONTACT_23076] -inflammatory effe cts.  It was also hypothesized that the supplement would boost the 
response to vaccination, the gold standard measure of immune function.   Subjects were randomized to 
consume Muscle Armor (N=6) or placebo (N=6) for 4- weeks.  The tetanus , diphtheria, and pertussis 
(TDAP ) vaccine was administered two weeks after product consumption began.  Plasma was collected 
prior to the start of consumption, immediately prior to vaccination, and [ADDRESS_22125] -vaccination.  
Muscle tissue was obtained before and after consumption of supplement or placebo though analyses of 
these specimens are not yet complete.   Plasma C -reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor -α 
(TNFα), and interleukin- 6 (IL6) were measured as systemic markers of inflammation.   
Results and Conclus ions for Inflammation:   The results for CRP are shown in Figure 7.  After [ADDRESS_22126] Dennis, PhD

 (mean ± SEM:  -1.37 ± 1.06 versus 0.42 ± 0.50 mg/L).  Based on analysis of log-transformed data, the 
difference between groups was not significant statistically (P=0.16).  Although the sample size was 
relatively small (N=12), these data provide a reasonable estimate of the expected effect size which was 
calculated to be 0.[ADDRESS_22127] size given 
for muscle macrophage content under Aim 1.  Thus, the power for Aim 1 has been updated to include 
this new calculation.  The proposed sample size (N=50 with 20% dropout ) gives  80% power to detect 
an effect size of 0.85 or greater at a 5% significance level.  The results for TNFα (not shown) also 
suggested that the supplement functions, in part, by [CONTACT_23077] a 
change in IL6 due to the supplement was  not detected.       
Results and Conclusions for Vaccination :  The results for the antibody response to the pertussis 
antigen are shown in Figure 8.  Median levels of antibody increased in both groups after vaccination.  
The increase from pre -vaccination was greater in the supplement than the placebo group at both 1 -
week (37.8 v. 19.6) and 2- weeks (131.0 v. 70.7) post -vaccination.  Based on a Mann- Whitney test, the 
difference between groups in the 2- week change in pertussis antibody titers was not statistic ally 
significant (P=0.13).  Thus, it is unknown whether the proposed sample size (N= 50 with 20% dropout ) 
will allow detection of differences between supplement and placebo groups though the nonparametric 
test result based on only N=[ADDRESS_22128] Dennis, PhD

 RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODS  
Study Summary (Figure 9):  Veterans (age 60 -80 yrs, N=50) will participate in a randomized double-
blind placebo- controlled trial.  The trial will evaluate the effects of a nutritional supplement (Muscle 
Armor) on immune function, muscle adaptation to resistance training, and retention of exercise benefits 
after training is halted.  Individual participation will last approximately one year (≥ 47 weeks ).  This time 
will include periods for screening and introduction to exercise, supplementation prior to training (2 
weeks), supplementation plus supervised resistance training (36 sessions), and supplementation during 
post-training  follow -up (26 weeks).  Subjects will undergo four muscle biopsies and blood draws to 
measure the effects of supplementation on the immune response to a bout of exercise.  A fifth biopsy 
will be collected to measure cellular adaptations in muscle to resistance training.  Five additional blood 
draws will occur to assess eligibility , safety , markers of inflammation,  and the response to vaccination 
for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis ( TDAP ).  Strength will be measured bi -weekly, mass and function 
will be measured at baseline, and after the training and post-training /detraining  periods.   
Figure 9:  Approximate t imeline of subject participation and summary of trial protocol.  
 
X/X denotes assessment of response to a single bout of exercise by [CONTACT_23078] (1 hour) and muscle (72 hours).  The above time- frame is optimal though only an 
approximation because of  scheduling issues related to federal holidays, subject availability, etc.

1. Recruitment (Target Population):  Veterans of age 60 -80 years will be recruited.   
a. Accruals Requested:  brief pre -screening  with required waivers  (N=8000), sign consent and 
undergo screening (N=200), participate in study (N= 100), complete all aspects of study 
considering possible dropout (N=40 to 50).   These number will encompass all approved 
recruitment methods.  
b. Permission is requested for N=[ADDRESS_22130]’s 
ability to participate, and the event is discovered by [CONTACT_23079], the IRB 
will be consulted as to whether the subject must be withdrawn.  
d. Other vulnerable populations (economically and educationally disadvantaged persons, employees and students, and homeless persons) will not be targeted for recruitment but are not specifically excluded.  An older veteran may respond to recruitment who by [CONTACT_23080] a member of one of these other vulnerable populations.  These 
individuals will undergo the same informed consent process and will be afforded the same 
research protections as any other participant. 
e. Individuals with diminished cognitive capacity may possibly respond to the recruitment since 
the study is targeting older (60- 80 yrs) adults.  However, individuals lacking the cognitive 
capacity to consent, as judged by a study physician, will be excluded either during the pre -
screening or screening phase.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_23023]. 
f. Male and female veterans are eligible.  
g. Minorities are expected to respond to recruitment to the extent of their representation in the local VA population.  
 
2. Recruitment (Advertising):  Recruitment will occur  from flyers  (e.g. post -cards or electronic)  
placed within the CAVHS LR and NLR campuses  and by [CONTACT_23081] .  All 
advertising materials will have been approved by [CONTACT_23082].  
a. Newspaper advertisement may be used but not necessarily due to the high cost of the local 
newspapers  (Democrat Gazette)  including military specific publications such as the Combat 
Airlifter and North Pulaski Leader .  Aging Monthly may also be used.    
b. Word -of-mouth may also be used as a recruitment method based on recruit referral from 
physicians, our subjects, and other individuals.  
c. Flyers and post -cards may be posted within the community at military specific locations such 
as the American Legion and the VFW.  Non- military specific locations in the community, 
particularly areas frequented by [CONTACT_21140], may also be used.  
d. These recruitment methods most always lead to the initial contact [CONTACT_23083] a recruit calls the study.  However, it is possible that the contact [CONTACT_23084], PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 14  of 43 
 person.  Regardless, “cold- contacts” will not be used.  Contact [CONTACT_23085].  
e. Two new methods of r ecruitment are requested with the 07 -25-2016 modification.   The 
study will recruit by [CONTACT_23086] a staffed 
information table in concourse areas of the CAVHS hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
i. Need:   The study needs to mail an advertisement letter (included in submission) in 
order to recruit participants.  This recruitment method is necessary since the use of 
paper flyers has been banned on the CAVHS campuses.  The study is currently 
using post -cards displayed around campus but they are not effective compared to 
flyers.  The electronic message boards are supposedly available but the study has 
been unsuccessful in posting on the boards despi[INVESTIGATOR_23024].   The study also needs to place staff at an information table in 
concourse areas (e.g. off to the side in concourse outside hallway to primary care).       
ii. Justification:   From 08/2014 to 04/[ADDRESS_22131] of ~$1000  for three days  each.  Since the 04/[ADDRESS_22132] -cards are only likely to be noticed by [CONTACT_23087].   
iii. Method 1:   The study will mail an advertisement letter (opt -in) to individuals 
identified through screening primary care appointment lists available in CPRS.  These lists are available to anyone with CPRS access.  The main benefit  of this 
method is efficiency since these Veterans should have an up- to-date health 
assessment from the primary care visit.  A checklist (included with submission) will be used to determine if individuals meet basic general eligibility criteria.  Records w ill 
not be accessed if marked “sensitive” or if the person does not meet the age requirement.  If all criteria aside from the latest PC visit are met, then the person’s 
name, last four of SSN,  and address will be recorded on a checklist .  Then later (e.g. 
next day) the primary care assessment will be reviewed and if no concerns exist, then an advertisement letter will be mailed.  Individuals will be contact[CONTACT_23088].  Those who respond wi ll continue 
recruitment  by [CONTACT_23089] .  Non-responders will be placed on the 
recruitment/enrollment log (name [INVESTIGATOR_13701]) so that they are not contact[CONTACT_23090].  In 
order to perform this process waivers of HIPAA and informed consent (see 
Supplement L) are requested.    
iv. Extension of Method 1:   The package [ADDRESS_22133] participants in our studies 204327 and 
391351 (Waiver of HIPAA and Consent has been requested to access name [CONTACT_23145]).  The already approved process and protections for 
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 15  of 43 
 screening and mailing of the opt-in letters  of invitation  also applies to these 
extensions.  
v. Method 2:   The study will also place staff members at information tables available to 
Veterans.  The most likely area is in the concourse between the elevators and the 
hall to primary care in NLR (similar to the Million Veterans Program).  Staff will offer 
verbal explanation or an already approved post -card, or conduct the already 
approved initial contact [CONTACT_23091] (see pre -screening process below)  if the Veteran 
is interested.  The IRB can be confident that this face- to-face encounter will not 
include a coercive “sales pi[INVESTIGATOR_23025]” as drop out severely hurts  enrollment.  P articipa nts 
join the study due to personal interests in  exercise and nutritional supplementation 
and the willingness to attend approximately [ADDRESS_22134], the study never attempts to “talk someone into” this substantial 
commitment.  
vi. Additional Protections:   Any Veteran information collected by [CONTACT_23092].  Every effort 
will be made to ensure that these processes are seen as non -intrusive and 
respectful of  privacy from Veterans or the process will be modified if needed.   
Appointment lists will not be printed.  As with all other study records, paper documents are stored behind a least two locks in the GRECC in the office of the PI  
[INVESTIGATOR_23026]’s 
folders on the GRECC server.               
3. Pre-Screening:  Pre-screening for eligibility will be performed when a recruit responds to 
recruitment, is interested in learning more about the study, and is interested in being considered for participation.  A request for waivers of HIPAA and written consent is limited to this specific 
minimal risk activity.  Recruits who appear eligible will come to the NLR VA for a research visit to continue the informed consent process, including written consent, HIPAA authorization and further 
screening for eligibility.  Thus, the main purpose of the pre- screening is to minimize the chance of 
a recruit who does not meet even the basic eligibility criteria from unnecessarily attending a 
research visit.   
a. Verbal Informed Consent:   Verbal informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_23093] -screening.  Recruits must answer affirmatively to having an interest in being 
considered for the study for the pre -screening to continue.  Recruits are told that they may 
refuse to answer any question.  This activity presents minimal risk to the recruit and all 
information will be protected as confidential.  Justifications are included in the IRB -required 
supplement included with this submission.  
b. Waiver of HIPAA :  Permission is requested to for a waiver of HIPPA in order to collect pre-
screening information from the recruit and from CPRS.  Pre -screening information will be 
documented on the “Initial Contact [CONTACT_23094]” and “Medical History and Physical Exam Form” as applicable.  Justifications are included in the IRB -required supplement included with this 
submission.  
c. Initial Contact [CONTACT_23095] -Screening:   Documentation of the pre- screening (partial list of 
eligibility criteria) will begin  on the “Initial Contact [CONTACT_23094]”.  The form contains a scripted 
explanation of the study to be used by a member of the study team who has been delegated 
this responsibility and trained by [CONTACT_978].  The brief explanation describes study procedures, benefits, and risks.  The form contains the last 4 digits of the SSN which will be used to 
access the recruit’s CPRS record if verbal consent to pre- screening is given.  
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22135] 
for the recruit will be reviewed by [CONTACT_23096].  This review will be documented on the “Medical History and Physical Exam 
Form”.  This screen of the CPRS Problems List includes among the criteria, a check 
for evidence for lack of cognitive capacity to consent for the study . 
ii. Recruits who appear eligible will be contact[CONTACT_23097] a research visit in which 
written consent will be obtained and the screening process will be continued by [CONTACT_8350].  It is not a necessity but recruits are asked to bring the following 
information to their visit:  list of current medications; names and telephone numbers 
of two emergency contacts; name [CONTACT_23146].   
iii. Consent to the CPRS pre- screening process is not a requirement to be considered 
for the study.  Individuals who wish to be pre -screened after written consent wi ll be 
allowed to do so during a research visit.  
iv. Obviously CPRS pre- screening does not apply to recruits who have not previously 
received VA healthcare.  These recruits will be informed that a DD214 is necessary 
and that a VA medical record must be created for them  prior to written consent . 
4. Informed Consent Process and Written Consent:   Recruits passing the pre -screening will 
attend a research visit to consent the consent process, provide written consent and continue eligibility screening.  The goal of the informed consent process is to ensure complete disclosure 
and voluntary participation for the subjects.   
a. Informed Consent Process:  Informed consent will be an ongoing process that begins 
when the recruit first learns of the study and will continue as an ongoing exchange of 
information between the research team and the subjects throug hout the course of the study.  
b. Written Informed Consent:  Written informed consent will be obtained from recruits by [CONTACT_1600] [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a trained member of the study team who has been delegated this responsibility.  The current IRB -approved and stamped version of VA  Form [ADDRESS_22136] has been withdrawn and 30+ day monitoring is complete.   
viii. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_23027].  The 10- 9012s, 
HIPAA, and scanning request form will also be included.  
5. Screening for Eligibility:   Subjects who provide written informed consent will undergo a 
screening for eligibility by [CONTACT_23098].  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are based on the study design and health suitability to 
undergo exercise training, supplementation, blood draws, biopsy, CT scan, and vaccination.  If exclusion criteria are temporary, recruits may participate in the study (or specific procedure 
related to criteria) once condition is no longer exclusionary.  The criteria  and method for collection 
of this information are listed:  
a. Inclusion Criteria:  information collected from subject self -report

physician of the exclusion criteria that may have been reviewed during the pre -screening of the 
CPRS Problem List.  The physician will assess the available information and document whether or not the subject is excluded.

for lab analyses by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_23029], after completion of the exercise 
training program, and upon completion of the study  for tests related to eligibility, safety, and 
research data.   
(1) Blood Pressure greater than 160/100 or <100 systolic. 
(2) HbA1C>10 
(3) CBC or PT/PTT/INR results that the study physician determines indicate a risk for excessive bleeding.  
(4) Clinical labs performed for safety monitoring including  AST, ALT, creatinine, and BUN  
(5) Other tests that performed to measure immune function include HbA1C, CBC, CRP, ESR, 
cholesterol HDL and LDL, and blood differ ential.   
f. Exclusion Criteria Based on Other Physician Judgments:   older veteran subjects often 
possess numerous comorbidities that result in a complex and unique set of health issues.  Thus, 
in addition to the specific exclusion criteria named above, the physician must also use a 
considerable amount of judgment in determining whether a recruit should be excluded even 
though the recruit meets the named inclusion criteria and does not meet the named exclusion 
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22137]’s healthcare providers from inside or outside the VA.  As appropriate, the physician will document and use this information to judge whether the subject can safely participate, should be excluded or withdrawn, or should be 
referred for treatment.
 
6. Scheduling:   A scheduling calendar will be used by [CONTACT_23101].  
a. A subject scheduling calendar will be maintained in the form of an Excel spreadsheet.  The 
calendar is needed in order for the study team to coordinate study procedures and data collection particularly when multiple subjects are scheduled for any one day.  Thus, the calendar 
will improve study efficiency, subject safety, and care.  The calendar will contain dates, subject 
ID #, and procedures for each visit.  It will be stored in the PI’s secure folder containing 
electronic logs.   
b. The study will also give patients visit cards that will include subject name, visit date  and time for 
up to three visits, procedures, and estimated time required.  The calendar and cards will help keep the study team and subjects on track  with the study requirements for each visit.  
c. The scheduling cards will typi[INVESTIGATOR_23030].  However, scheduling cards may also be mailed, 
as needed, for instances  when an appointment must be scheduled over the phone and the 
subject desires a written reminder in addition to the reminder telephone calls that are already 
commonly used.  Obviously a card would not be mailed, for example, if a subject is contact[CONTACT_23102] a card is not needed or if the appointment is scheduled for so soon as to 
not allow time for mail to be received.     
7. Payment of Subjects:  This research is not integrated or related to patient care.  Subjects will be 
compensated for their time and inconvenience and as incentive to participate in compliance with the 
requirements of the study as explained in informed consent. 
a. Payments will be made in the form of Kroger gift cards.  
b. Participation involves approximately 50- 60 research visits over the course of approximately one 
year.  Subjects will receive $20 for each visit attended.  However, approximately 10 of the visits 
(e.g. once every four weeks) will require that the subject return a dosing calendar and the canisters containing any unused portion of supplement or placebo.   This process is required to 
monitor subject compliance with product consumption.  At these visits, subjects will receive the $[ADDRESS_22138] will receive an additional 
$[ADDRESS_22139] (i.e. $40 for the visit).  
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults

V11, 06-26-2017  Page 21  of 43 
 d. Subjects will be given two completion bonuses.  Subjects will receive $100 after completion of 
the resistance training program and $300 after completion of the entire study.  The total amount 
earned for completion of all study visits will total approximately $1,500.  
e. The compensation is normal compared to similar studies conducted  at other instituti ons.  The 
amount is not considered coercive considering that subjects will have more than 50 visits over a 
one year span that require a high level of conscientious active participation (exercise training and accurate supplement/placebo consumption, multipl e biopsies and blood draws).  
f. The consent form will inform the subject of that the VA may report participation payments as income to the IRS. 
g. Finder’s fees and recruitment bonuses will not paid to VA or study staff .  If a subject refers 
another veteran to the study who signs consent to participate, then a $[ADDRESS_22140].  
8. Randomization:  After medical clearance to participate, subjects will be randomized to either of two 
parallel groups, treatment with Muscle Armor or placebo.  The double -blind randomization will be 
performed by a research pharmacist.  Assignments will be unknown to investigators and subjects.  The pharmacist will review all study material prior to approval, and can  break the blind if needed for 
safety purposes, but is otherwise uninvolved in the study.  The pharmacist will dispense the products in sealed and blinded packaging.   The study will appoint a study monitor ( specific un -
blinded member of the study team ) to review and be involved in pharmacy and subject compliance.  
This person will not be involved in subject assessments or specimen analysis.  
9. Supplementation:  Muscle Armor was chosen from a scientific standpoint because of the ability of 
its ingredients to modulate muscle health and immune function.  Muscle Armor is a good choice for practical purposes because it’s ingredients are safe to consume [46;47]  and it is available to 
individuals by [CONTACT_23103].  
a. Subjects in the supplement group will consume orange- flavored Muscle Armor according to the 
manufacturer’s directions:  one serving ( approximately 30g, i.e. one scoop provided with the 
product by [CONTACT_23104]), twice daily (optimally morning and evening), mixed with 12 ounces (oz) of water.  Subjects in the placebo group will similarly consume one serving ( approximately 
13g, one scoop provided to pharmacy by [CONTACT_1758] ) of orange -flavored Kool -Aid mixed with [ADDRESS_22141] dose 
will vary based on whether a level, sub- level, or heapi[INVESTIGATOR_23031].  
Dose range for the supplement appears to be 30- 35 grams and dose range for the placebo 
appears to be 11- 15 grams.  This is less than the actual single serving size listed on the 
instructions for Kool -Aid but is deemed acceptable due the sugar content of the recommended 
serving size since diabetics will likely be enrolled and older adults may dislik e the taste due to it 
being too sweet.    
c. Supplementation will typi[INVESTIGATOR_23032] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_23033] 5) and 
continue for the remainder of the participant’s study involvement ( optimally approximately 42 
weeks) .  The total dosing time will likely be longer than the optimal time because scheduling of 
the exercise training and other appointments must be performed based on VA holidays, patient and physician availability, etc.   And specific starting date or intermittent dosing lengths of time 
can be altered without protocol deviation in order to maintain proper spacing of the more time dependent clinical procedures, e.g. blood draw, biopsy, and vaccination.        
d. Compliance will be monitored using subject self -report  and both the number of doses consumed  
and weight of product consumed.  Each canister will contain 14 doses (7 day supply) though 
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22142] agree to maintain their normal diet 
during participation.  
e. Subjects will be given a gym bag to transport their canisters of supplement/placebo and consumption calendar between home and  study visits.  They will also be given two drink mixer 
bottles of the type commonly used to mix powder shakes.  These products contain the GRECC 
name [CONTACT_23147].  Subjects will be allowed to keep the bag and 
bottles upon completion of the study.  The approximate value of the products per subject is 
~$28.  These gifts are justified due to making it easier for the subject to transport materials to 
and from study visits which should increase subject compliance with dosing and monitoring 
requirements.  
f. 06/12/[ADDRESS_22143], Juven, in the future.  The study will switch to 
using Juven with approval of this modification though remaining stores of Muscle Armor will be 
used until expi[INVESTIGATOR_320].  The study had originally planned to use Juven but did not use Juven 
after learning that it is only available in single serve packets which would make the blinding 
proces s laborious.  Use of Juven will require the study team member who packs the placebo in 
the pharmacy  to pack the supplement Juven in similar fashion, i.e. 14 doses (packets) will be 
emptied into the usual blinded supplement canisters.   Other pertinent detai ls of the switch 
include the following:  
i. Juven and Muscle Armor are essentially the same product but were being marketed by [CONTACT_23105].  They taste, smell, and look identical.  Thus, the blind will not be in jeopardy due to the switch. 
ii. The key ingredients of interest (Arginine, Glutamine, Methylbutyrate) are present in the same amounts in Juven and Muscle Armor.  Juven lacks the 3g Taurine 
that is in Muscle Armor and Juven contains phenylalanine, and FD&C Yellow #6 
instead of Red #40, and aspartame instead of sucralose.   
iii. The product identity and ingredients were not mentioned in the consent form or other information given to subjects.  
iv. Since Taurine is missing in Juven, the dose size is slightly smaller than Muscle 
Armor (24g versus 30 g).  However, Juven was measured in the same scoop 
size used for Muscle Armor and the difference was negligible. 
v. Switching to a slightly different product during the study is not optimal but is 
necessary.  The switch is not expected to affect the results.  However, the study 
will track when the switch was made for each subject to determine during 
statistical analysis if a bias was introduced.     
g. Benefit:  The subjects may or may not have improved muscle health and immune function due 
to the supplement.   The supplement may improve the response to the vaccine.  However, it is 
unknown whether this improvement will convey increased protection from disease.

 h. Risk:   There is little evidence from  controlled studies of risk associated with the ingredients of 
the supplement.  However, adverse events have occurred in which the relation to underlying 
disease or the supplement was not discerned.  Thus, this study will take a conservative 
approach and c onsider that the ingredients may exacerbate the following conditions:  allergies 
or asthma, herpes , and low blood pressure. The supplement may cause side effects such as 
abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gout, blood abnormalities, sensitivity similar to monosodium 
glutamate (MSG; headache, flushing, tingling, weakness).  Caution should be used when taking 
the supplement and lactulose.  The supplement should not be taken by [CONTACT_23106], or those having a recent heart attack, liver disease, seizures, mania or bipolar 
disorder and taking lithium.

 *Juven supplement has the same composition as Muscle Armor except it lacks Taurine.  
j. Minimization of risks:   The risks of participation will be minimized by [CONTACT_23107].  Individuals who should not take the supplement will be excluded.  Subjects will be 
informed of the potential side- effects and advised to report any symptoms.  Symptoms related to 
the supplement and other study procedures will be monitored for, as applicable, at each study  
appointment and by [CONTACT_23108].  Safety monitoring will also include blood draws for assessment of liver and kidney function at baseline, after completion of the 
training program and at the end of the study . 
9. Vaccination:  The International Society of Exercise and Immunology considers response to 
vaccination the gold- standard for assessment of immune function in the context of exercise [38].  
Multiple vaccine options were considered for use in the proposed study.  Vaccination with antigen 
more likely to be naïve to subjects is preferable.  However, the risk to benefit ratio of using the 
keyhole limpet protein or the herpes zoster live- attenuated virus was considered unacceptable.  The 
influenza vaccine was considered since the epi[INVESTIGATOR_23034], but this  option could limit 
recruitment outside of flu season by [CONTACT_23109].  The tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis ( TDAP ) vaccine has the 
advantages of benefit to the subject, low risk, low cost, and available test kits to measure response.   
a. Procedure:  The vaccine will be administered by a study physician to each subject after 2-
weeks of supplementation.  Blood will be collected at baseline and [ADDRESS_22144] Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 24  of 43 
 younger adults [48].  If needed to accommodate scheduling, the supplementation period may be 
extended.  The vaccination and second biopsy may occur up to [ADDRESS_22145] may also be utilized as needed, without being added as study staff, if the activity falls within their CAVHS job duties .      
b. Benefit:   The TDAP  vaccine was chosen because of the direct benefit it will provide to older 
subjects [49] .  Tetanus, for example, is uncommon in the [LOCATION_002], but 70% of cases 
involve older adults and individuals over 60 years of age experience greater than a 50% mortality rate [50;51] .  However, problems with these diseases are avoidable because the 
vaccine is safe for use in older adults.   
c. Risk:   The most common problems in adults are mild or moderate:  pain at injection site (mild 2 
in 3, moderate 1 in 100); redness or swelling at site (mild 1 in 5, moderate 1 in 25, severe 3 in 
100); fever (mild 1 in 100, higher 1 in 250); headache (mild 3 in 10, moderate 1 in 300); 
tiredness (mild 1 in 4), and nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or stomach ache (mild 1 in 10, moderate 
1 in 100).  Chills, body aches, sore joints, rash, or swollen glands are uncommon.  A severe 
allergic reaction could occur after any vaccine (rare, less than once in a million doses).  Individuals who are allergic or have experienced unexplained problems (coma, seizures) after 
vaccination, or has had Guillian- Barre Syndrome should not be vaccinated.  
d. Minimization of risk:  The most common problems can be safely managed with symptomatic 
treatment.  Individuals who should not be vaccinated will be excluded.  The procedure will be 
postponed until recovery for subjects with mild illness or fever.  All subjects will be informed of the risks and advised to call the study physician or staff immediately should a severe reaction 
occur.   
10. Resistance Exercise Training Program:  The study will use a resistance exercise routine that we 
have previously used to elicit cellular and molecular responses in muscle associated with immune function and to improve muscle mass and strength of the thigh for older adults [2;3;40;52] .   
a. Procedure:  The resistance exercise program will use three exercises to strengthen the thigh 
muscles including bilateral knee extension, knee curl, and leg press.  Exercises are completed on air -driven exercise equipment in a seated position.  Exercise  sessions are always supervised 
by a study team member.  
b. Strength Testing:   Strength will be determined using the [ADDRESS_22146] [52].  A 
brief warm -up period will include approximately 10 minutes of mild aerobic activity followed by 
[CONTACT_3450] 6 repetitions  of lifting warm up at for a resistance exercise at a “somewhat heavy” 
load.  The load is then gradually (~5-10%) increased such that the maximum capability for lifting 
is reached in approximately [ADDRESS_22147] completed in the 
order of press, curl, and extension.      
c. Unaccustomed Exercise Sessions (2x):   Prior to exercise training, the study will measure the 
response to single bouts of the training exercises before and after two weeks of nutritional 
supplementation.  The response to exercise will be measured using both muscle and blood.  The pre -exercise time points will be prior to exercise, possibly same say or  a different day 
based on scheduling and/or the judgment of the study physician.   The post -exercise time points 
for collection are [ADDRESS_22148]  in muscle  [52].  
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22149] determined the 
effects of exercise on systemic measures of immune function [11;53] .   
d. Exercise Training Sessions (36x):   The training program plans to have subjects perform 
supervised exercise at the NLR VA for approximately an hour optimally [ADDRESS_22150] is capable of lifting one ti me.  After 
strength testing, subjects will perform exercises at loads ranging from 60% to 80% (e.g. sets at 
60, 70, 75, and 80% of capability)  of their measured capability to the best of their ability.  
Strength is retested at  approximately every 6th sessi on to account for strength gain in 
maintaining the work load.   On days of testing, the strength test replaces one of the four 
exercise sets.   Strength is also tested twice prior to training, at the final training bout, and twice 
during the post-training follow-up period.   
f. Training sessions consist of three sets of [ADDRESS_22151] to complete 36 exercise training sessions may be 
necessary on a case -by-case basis at the discretion of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_23035] 72 hours (3 days) after the final exercise training session.  Addition or subtraction of  a limited number (optimally 1- 2) of exercise sessions may be 
necessary to meet this time frame due to scheduling difficulties for the biopsy.  Scheduling 
obstacles include physician or subject availability or more commonly the fact that the final 
exercise session cannot fall on a Wednesday or Thursday unless plans are made to perform the 
biopsy on Saturday or Sunday which is not preferable.    Maintaining this time frame for biopsy is the priority as it has a greater chance of influencing the cellular meas urements to be made 
using the biopsy than would a small difference in the total number of exercise sessions for 
influencing strength gain over the long training period.  
i. Benefit:  Regular resistance exercise is an effective method for improving many aspects  of 
health and well -being (13).  Subjects will likely improve the size (CT scan) , strength (strength 
testing) , and function (see below)  for their thigh muscles.  The assessments of muscle function 
include:  
(1) Berg Balance Scale (BBS):  BBS is used to detect balance impairments in older adults 
while the individual is static or performing various movements [53].  The tes t consists of 
[ADDRESS_22152] good inter-rater reliability of 0.98.  
(2) Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT):  The test is used to measure mobility performance in 
older adults and individuals with limitations [54].  The subjects will perform a supervised 
timed walk on a 200 foot track at a pace without encouragement and which allows speech without shortness of breath.   
(3) Gait Speed:  The test measures habitual walking speed [55].  The subjects will walk at 
their normal preferred pace for [ADDRESS_22153] Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 26  of 43 
 (4) Timed Up and Go:  The test is indicative of balance and mobility by a measuring the time 
required for the subject  to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around, walk back to 
the chair, and sit down [55].  
(5) Functional assessment data will be collected at four times during the protocol :  pre -
training, post -training, during post -training follow -up, and at end of st udy.    
j. Risk:  In all but limited contraindicating circumstances (our exclusion criteria), the benefits of 
regular exercise exceed the risks.  Exercise of the proposed intensity has been conducted 
safely in even frail elderly and adults in 80 -90 years of a ge (8, 18, 23) .  However, serious events 
are possible:  
(1) Exercise may cause (estimated at 1 of 100 cases or 1:100) shortness of breath, chest 
pain, or dizziness; and ligament, tendon, or muscle sprain.   
(2) Heart problems are a rare but serious risk of strenuous exercise and may result in 
sudden death (1:18,000 adults per year).  However, even in patients undergoing heart 
rehabilitation,  heart failure (1:100,000), heart attack (1:200,000), and death (1:750,000) 
are rare events relative to the number of hours spent exercising. 
k. Minimization of Risk:  the risks of exercise will be minimized for the subjects as follows:    
(1) Each subject will have undergone a thorough medical history and physical exam including an electrocardiogram (resting and during exercise stress) performed by [CONTACT_23110].  Details and physician clearance to participate are 
documented on the Medical History and Physical Exam Form.  
(2) Subjects will not be allowed to begin exercise if their blood pressure is greater than 160/100.  After training, if blood pressure is elevated, the subject will remain at the 
GRECC until it returns to normal.  If it d oes not return to normal the subject will be 
evaluated by a study physician.  
(3) Training will be supervised at all times during exercise by a member of the study team who is certified in basic life support to ensure subject safety and compliance.  If the 
subject cannot complete the exercise with proper form then the work load will be 
decreased or the set will be halted.  The member of the study team will know the 
emergency response procedures and they will be posted on the wall of the ex ercise 
room.  
(4) The exercises will be performed using air -driven equipment in a seated position.  Thus, 
there is no risk of the subjects falling, droppi[INVESTIGATOR_23036], or having weights fall on them.  
(5) Subjects will complete an introductory exercise session in order to learn proper exer cise 
form while lifting relatively light loads.  
(6)  Each training session will be preceded by a warm -up period on a stationary bicycle, 
treadmill, and/or the exercise equipment.  Stretching will be performed as needed during 
and after the training session.  
 
l. Emergency Response:
  If there is a problem or concern for continued exercise, the person 
supervising the exercise will immediately halt the exercise.   This emergency response also 
applies to any potential problem occurring on- site.  If the problem is a potential emergency, the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23037] [ADDRESS_22154] Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 27  of 43 
 problem that is not an emergency, the study medical staff and/or the GRECC nurse will be 
contact[CONTACT_23111] a course of action.  
(1) Modification to Emergency Response Plan 09- 16-2016:  
(2) This greater than minimal risk protocol is modified to inform the IRB that the emergency 
response procedure for an on- site serious adverse event has changed but there is no 
significant change in risk to the subjects.  Beginning the evening of 09 -15-2016, the NLR 
campus will deploy a "medical response team" (MRT) instead of a "code team" in response to emergencies.  
(3) In response to email notification of this change on 09- 13-16, [CONTACT_23149] 
convened a 90- minute meeting (09 -14-16) of the physicians and principle investigators 
of the GRECC.  [CONTACT_23150] obtained further clarification on the details of the 
change from the Quality Management Coordinator.  We also reviewed the medication list 
to be included in the Stat Pack meds of the MRT.  We  concluded that the risk posed to 
subjects participating in the ongoing clinical trials at GRECC and specifically this protocol, are not increased based on the following details of the change and our 
preparedness measures.  
(4) This opi[INVESTIGATOR_23038]- hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23039] [54]. 
(5) Under the new guidelines for emergency response, the medical officer of the day (MOD) will continue t o respond as team leader of the MRT.  MRT will provide BLS and other 
care determined by [CONTACT_23112].  The patient will be transferred to an acute care facility, if needed, via MEMS (determined by [CONTACT_23112]), as is similar to the prior practice.  
(6) Crash carts, including the crash cart on our unit, will no longer house medications.  
However, Stat Pack medications will be carried to each emergency site by a MRT nurse.  
The medications included are the same as those previously supplied on the crash cart 
with the exception of anti -arrhythmics and atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  However, our unit will stock atropi[INVESTIGATOR_23040] (e.g. IV 
lines and normal saline) so long as unavailable from the MRT.   
(7) Additionally, the MRT will not have access to intubation though use of this procedure 
was previously discouraged by [CONTACT_23113].  The MRT will still have capacity 
to support patient respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (Ambu Bag) until MEMS arrives, if necessary.  
(8) The likelihood of serious adverse events with the protocol are low though the 
possibilities of concern include:  acute myocardial infarction (MI) due to strenuous 
exercise, vasovagal response with syncope and possible bradycardia during muscle 
biopsy, and anaphylaxis due to lidocaine sensitivity during muscle biopsy.  Baby [CONTACT_6149][INVESTIGATOR_23041].  As stated above, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_23042]-hand in case of bradycardia.  Benadryl is available in the Stat Pack in case of

Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22155] -Training Follow -up Period:  After completion of the training program, subjects will remain in 
the study for at least 26 additional weeks so that the retention of muscle mass, strength, and 
function can be examined relative to continued daily consumption of supplement or placebo.  
Subjects will be required to refrain from strength training of the thighs (i.e. weight lifting, body weight 
exercise, elastic bands) during this period.  It is acceptable for subjects to participate in other forms 
of exercise such as walking or resistance training with the upper body.  Compliance with these and study dietary requirements will be monitored by [CONTACT_23114] -up 
period.  These visits are also required for dispensing of product from the pharmacy and monitoring of consumption compliance.  
a. The study did consider the ethical issue of disallowing resistance training of the thighs during the post -training period since the benefits of the exercise training will be partially lost without it.  
We concluded that this criterion was acceptable because it eliminates a strong confounder (i.e. 
strength training) for Aim 3 (Does the supplement promote retention of the benefits of exercise?) 
of the study; older adults are unlikely to participate in high -intensity training of the thighs 
anyway; and other options in exercise more commonly practiced by [CONTACT_23115].         
12. Muscle Biopsy:  Muscle biopsy is a procedure commonly performed in physiology studies.  The 
studies involving this PI [INVESTIGATOR_23044].  Only three problems have occurred which involved resumption of bleeding that required a pressure bandage, a 
mild reaction to the lidocaine injection which resulted in halting of the procedure, and fainting which 
led to withdrawal of the subject from the study.  
a. Procedure:  Muscle tissue will be obtained from each subject by [CONTACT_23116] (outer thigh) by a study physician.   Each subject will undergo the procedure five times.  
The first four will occur before and 72 hrs after a single bout of exercise completed before and 
after approximately 2- weeks of consuming the supplement or placebo.   The final biopsy will 
occur 72 hrs after completion of the exercise training program.   The procedure is performed 
after loca l anesthetic (lidocaine) is used to numb the site.  A small incision will be made in the 
skin and a Bergstrom needle will be inserted briefly into the muscle to remove several pea- sized 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_23045] (7).  Direct pressure will be applied to stop the bleeding.  The wound is closed 
with a band -aid type bandage and covered with a pressure bandage.   The procedure will be 
performed according to an approved Muscle Biopsy SOP.  The procedure details and outcomes 
will be documented using the Subject Procedure Note.   Pre-exercise biopsies will be taken from 
the dominant leg while post -exercise biopsies will be taken from the non- dominant leg.  
b. Benefit:  The procedure is of no benefit to the subject.  The study will investigate the effects of 
the nutritional supplement on muscle and the response to exercise training and detraining so 
that this information can be used in the future to potentially improve muscle rehabilitation strategies.  This information cannot be obtained by [CONTACT_23117].   
c. Risk:  The biopsy procedure may cause discomfort.  Injection of the local anesthetic may sting.  
The discomfort of the biopsy needle insertion varies from painless to uncomfortable or painful.  The site will be bruised and sore for a few days and will likely cause a small scar.  Temporary 
numbness of the skin at the biopsy site can occur.  Infection of the wound is rare.  Other risks of the biopsy include an allergic reaction to the local anesthetic, feeling light -headed or fainting 
during the procedure, or that the wound resumes bleeding later in the day (1:100 cases each).  
d. Minimization of Risk:  The medical history and physical screening process will be used by [CONTACT_23118] a history of allergic reaction to lidocaine or have had significant problems with fainting.  
*The protocol standard recommendations are that p rior to the muscle biopsies subjects should 
refrain from using certain products that can influence bleeding.  Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_23046], PhD  
V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22156] the investigators immediately and/or seek emergency hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23047].  
e. *Physician judgement:   Should the requirement for abstinence from contraindicated 
medications and supplements not be adhered to by [CONTACT_23119], the study physician may use clinical judgement to determine the potential for an impact on subject safety 
and the acceptability of undergoing muscle biopsy.  These decisions will be made on a case by 
[CONTACT_23120], time- frame of consumption, and other individual 
risk factors for bleeding possessed by [CONTACT_423].    
13. Blood Draw:  Blood draws will be performed by a qualified study staf f member  or GRECC nurse . 
a. Procedure:  Blood will be drawn nine times over the course of the study from each subject.  
The blood will most likely be drawn from the antecubital vein ( ≤ 60ml or 2 ounces); however 
other sites may be used at the discretion of the person drawing blood and assent of the subject.  
Fasting is not a requirement.  
b. Benefit:  The purpose of the blood draws are for screening for subject eligibility and safety, and 
for determining t he effects of the nutritional supplement on blood- based measures of immune 
function.  If requested, subjects will be provided the results of their clinical blood tests which 
may provide an educational benefit. 
c. Risk:  Blood draw in the proposed amount is a minimal risk procedure.  There is a risk of mild 
discomfort or pain or feelings of lightheadedness.  Fainting is possible.  The blood draw will 
likely cause a small bruise. There is also a small risk of infection.  
d. Minimization of Risk:  The risk of the blo od draw will be minimized by [CONTACT_23121].  The person drawing blood will utilize standard aseptic technique and follow VA policy for hand hygiene and protective coverings.  Sharps will be handled appropriately and 
disposed of properly.  Snacks (e.g. peanut butter crackers and juice) are offered to subjects to 
minimize the feelings of light -headedness after blood draw and biopsy.  
14. Other Human Subject Data Collected  
a. During participation subjects will be asked to maintain their “normal” diet and to not make any conscious efforts to lose or gain weight.  Weight will be measured at study entry and upon 
completion.  
b. Use of Certain Medications:  it is unknown how certain medications (specifically those used to 
control inflammation) and other age- associated medical issues will influence the variables of 
interest to the study.  Due to this possibility, medications and medical problems will be recorded and used as potential confounding variables in the statistical or exploratory analyses.  
15. Computed Tomography Scan of the Thigh   
a. Procedure:  Muscle Cross- Sectional Area and composition will be determined by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_23048] (CT) scan of the mid- thigh  at pre -training, post -
training, and at the end of the study.  The service performed CT scans for our previous study which showed that size increased (P=0.002, 7.4 ± 2.0%) in older adults after 12- weeks of 
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 30  of 43 
 training [3].  Subjects are carefully positioned in the scanner and boney land marks are used to 
ensure precise mid- thigh location for each scan.  Analysis of scans will be completed using a 
program such as Slice -O-matic (Montreal, Canada) to discern between bone, fat, and muscle.  
CT scan data is transferred from the Imaging service to the study on a CD which is not 
encrypted per se .  However,  the risk of an unintended recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23049].  Furthermore, the data is a cross-
sectional image of the thigh  which looks like a slice of ham (i.e. not sensitive) .  The information 
will be labeled with the subject study ID, not name [CONTACT_23148].   Transport of the disk from the LR to 
NLR VA will occur in a locked bag and the disks will be maintained according to CAVHS 
regulations.  
b. Benefit:  The CT scan of the thigh is of no direct benefit to the subject  though the measure 
provides important scientific knowledge of the effects of exercise training, detraining, and nutritional supplementation in older adults.  
c. Risk:   The procedure will expose subjects to radiation.  The total amount of radiation the 
subjects will be exposed to per scan (6 mSv) is approximately the same as the average 
exposure an individual has from natural sources per year.  Having three scans in one year 
creates a very small increase (from 44.9% to 44.95%) in the risk of cancer for the average 70 
year old male (www.xrayrisk.com).   
d. Minimization of Risk:  There are no exclusion criteria specific to this procedure.  Risk is low in 
the study population as compared to younger populations  and individuals who may become 
pregnant.  
16. Data Safety and Monitoring Plan  
a. The following plan has been adapted from "Guidelines for Data and Safety Monitoring for Clinical Trials Not Requiring Traditional Data  Monitoring Committees ” [55]. 
b. The study has eligibility criteria that have been precisely defined, as described above, to  ensure 
enrollment of subjects  who possess an appropriate risk/benefit ratio . The conservative inclusion 
and exclusion criteria were developed with input from multiple s tudy physicians.  The criteria 
select of individuals with relatively low risk of adverse events from the study procedures and relatively high probability of benefit from participation.   These criteria are assessed and 
documented in the Medical History and Physical Form prior to active participation.  Physician clearance to participate is documented on this form and CPRS.  
c. Safety monitoring will be performed on a frequent and regular basis from enrollment until at least [ADDRESS_22157] Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 31  of 43 
 f. Appropriate action relative to the severity of the event is taken by [CONTACT_23122].  This may range from documentation by [CONTACT_14676] (e.g. mild 
muscle soreness) to safety examination by [CONTACT_5989] (e.g. elevated blood pressure 
after exercise) .  This safety evaluation will include the measures necessary for the study 
physician to judge that the subject can safely continue participation, needs treatment, or should 
be withdrawn from the study.  
g. The study procedures (exercise, supplementation, etc) can and will be halted at any time a 
concern for the subject is identified. Halted procedures will not resume until the concern has 
been alleviated.  If concerns cannot be alleviated then the study physicians may judge to 
withd raw the subject, modify the protocol, suspend enrollment, or halt the study.  This is a 
relatively small single site study which allows these decisions to be made in real -time as they 
occur rather after aggregate data collection after interim analysis .  
h. All adverse events are brought to the attention of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238], as needed to 
the study physicians.   Adverse events will be reported to the IRB according to CAVHS policy.  
i. The study has also stipulated that a member of the study team will not be blinded to subject randomization to supplement or placebo.  This person will not be involved with assessment of 
any outcome measures but will be responsible for monitoring of subject product consumption 
compliance as it relates to the individual, the study, and the pharmacy.  
j. The sample size is justified by [CONTACT_23123].  
k. The study team members possess no conflicts of interest with regard to the study protocol and 
the procedures and products involved.  
 
17. Data Handling and Recording Plan  
a. The study team has undergone peer -review by [CONTACT_23124] R&D Service to determine 
that the team is composed of appropriately qualified individuals to supervise the overall conduct of the trial, to handle the data, to verify the data, to conduct the statistical analyses, and to 
prepare any study  reports.  
b. Data collected directly from the subject or their CPRS record is recorded in real -time directly 
onto the submitted data collection forms (e.g. medical history form, exercise training log, procedure note) by [CONTACT_23125].  Each of these forms has been 
submitted for IRB approval.  
c. These forms are adapted from those used in previous studies and thus are validated for the ability to reliably capture the required data. 
d. Data is transferred ( recorded) from the data collection forms into an electronic database (Excel 
spreadsheet).  Data entry is performed by a so delegated member of the study team.  The process is performed in duplicate (i.e. double data entry) so that the data can be readily 
checked for content validity, completeness,  accuracy, and consistency.   Changes to the 
electronic database can be made if needed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_23050].

LABORATORY ASPECTS OF THE STUDY  
Study Outcomes:  The study will examine the effects of the nutritional supplement on measures of 
immune function and muscle health.  The immune response to three types of stimulation will be measured:  antibody response to vaccination, immune response in muscle and blood to a bout of 
exercise, and an in vitro response for immune cell proliferation.  Muscle adaptation to trainin g will be 
measured at the whole body  (i.e. muscle cross -sectional area, strength, and function)  and cellular 
levels.   The blood and muscle tissue collected from the subjects at the described time points will be 
used for laboratory analyses of variables related to immune function and muscle adaptation to exercise 
training.   The basis for the expectations that each measure will be affected by [CONTACT_23127]  (β-hydroxy - β-methylbutyrate, arginine, and glutamine)  and/or resistance 
exercise is provided.    
The specific proposed method of measurement or measure of immune function (and associated 
hypothesis)  in muscle or blood may change for practical and scientific reasons  and not be considered a 
deviation so long as the measure:  1) addresses a molecular or cellular trait potentially impacted by 
[CONTACT_23128]; 2) is 
not genetic testing; 3) and the results will not be communicated back to the subjects or used  to 
influence their medical care in any way .    
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults

 BLOOD MEASURES  
A. Response to Vaccination:   β-hydroxy -β-methylbutyrate has been used in animal science to 
improve the response to vaccination [32].  The study will determine if 2- weeks of supplementation 
improves the response of older adults to the TDAP  vaccine.  The response to pertussis  is of primary 
interest though the responses to the tetanus  and diphtheria antigens will also be measured.  Serum 
antibody titers will be compared between pre -vaccination and two time points post -vaccination.  
Enzyme -linked immunosorbent assays are available for measuring antibodies  to each antigen (IBL 
International, Toronto, Ontario).   
B. T-Cell Subpopulations:    Glutamine and arginine may be conditionally essential amino acids in the 
contexts of aging and exercise that are needed for optimal T -Cell function [34;56] .  Aging decreases 
the ratio of naïve helper (CD4+) to cytotoxic (CD8+) T- Cells [57]; and though the levels of both cell 
populations increase shortly after moderate exercise for older adults, their levels do not reach the 
pre-exercise levels of young adults [58].  The proposed study  will determine if 2 -weeks of 
supplementation increases the CD4+ to CD8+ ratio or increases the response to acute exercise.  A regulatory t -cell subset (CD4+, CD25+, FoxP3+)  will also be examined since these cells function as 
regul ators of immune function that prevent an uncontrolled immune response or autoimmunity [59].  
Assessment of T-cell subsets will be carried out  by [CONTACT_23129] -linked 
antibodies specific to each marker  (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) .  Additionally, if an alteration in 
inflammatory status is indicated by [CONTACT_23130], then the Th17 subset (CD4+, CCR6+ , 
CD161+, RORα+ ) will be evaluated.  This pro -inflammatory subset  has not been studied following 
supplementation or exercise and the results could provide for the first time information on whether alteration in Th17 t -cells accompanies improvement in immune status.  
C. Cytokine and Chemokines:   Immune responses are either predominated by [CONTACT_23131]- inflammatory Th1 
cytokines (e.g. I FN-γ, TNF -α, IL-2, and IL- 17) or anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines  (e.g. IL -10 and IL -
4) and chemokines  depending on the nature of the stimulus .  However, arginine and glutamine may 
be able to limit the production of these factors  [36].  Since aging is thought to increase basal 
cytokine levels and impair the cytokine response to exercise [60], the study will determine if 2-
weeks of supplementation decreases baseline cytokine levels and increases the response to acute 
exercise.   Cytokines  and chemokines will be measured using the multiplex Luminex array system 
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and confirmed using high sensitivity enzyme linked immunosorbent assays 
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).  
D. Immune Cell Proliferation:    In vitro models indicate that glutamine and arginine are important to 
immune cell proliferation [34;61] .  Similarly, human trials of β -hydroxy - β-methylbutyrate, arginine, 
and glutamine have shown that monocytes, lymphocytes, and T -cells increase after treatment  
[27;46] .  Proliferative capacity of lymphocytes also increases shortly after moderate exercise but the 
change is significant only in young and not older adults [58].  This study will determine if [ADDRESS_22159] of the supplement is 
determined, the results will be confirmed using the supplement or its individual ingredients to treat 
cells in vitro.   Proliferation will be measured by [CONTACT_23132] a fluorescent dye 
(carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester)  after treatment with phorbol ester and calcium ionophore as 
was used in Finding 5 . 
MUSCLE MEASURES  
E. Macrophages:    Evidence from animal models indicates that arginine and glutamine metabolism is 
involved with macrophage activat ion that mediates  inflammation or anti -inflammation and growth 
[35;37] .  Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of macrophages residing in muscle 
perform the lat ter of these two functions , i.e. anti -inflammation and growth.  However, muscle of 
Immune Function and Muscle Adaptations to Resistance Exercise in Older Adults  
Richard Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22160] the CD163 marker (Cell Sciences, Canton, MA) .  Additional markers (CD68 and CD206) will 
be used to confirm the specificity of the CD163 marker to macrophages.  
F. Cytokines and Growth Factors:    Our preliminary results show that older muscle contains 
elevated basal levels of cytokines and diminished levels of growth factors.  The effect of arginine and glutamine on cytokine expression is expected to be the same in tissue as it is systemically.  
The study will determine if 2- weeks of supplementation decreases baseline cytokine levels and 
increases the response to exercise.  Since chronic inflammation is thought to dampen growth factor 
production [62], the study will deter mine if supplementation also increases growth factor levels at 
baseline and in response to exercise.  IL1β, IL10, and IGF1 are of primary interest though the other 
cytokines, and growth and remodeling factors including MuRF and MAFbx  which will also be 
measured.  Gene expression will be measured at the mRNA level using total RNA extracted from 
whole muscle by [CONTACT_23133]- time PCR.  Assays will utilize SYBR green chemistry and  
standard curves  as was used in Findings 1- 4 (Figures 2 -5). 
G. Nuclear Factor -kB (NFkB) and Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase S ignaling (PI3K) :   Direct 
assessment of protein and protein activity in human muscle has proven difficult for cytokines and 
growth factors including IGF1, one of the most commonly studied regulators of muscle mass.   For 
this reason, the study will evaluate muscle for cytokine (NFkB)  and growth factor  (PI3K)  activity by 
[CONTACT_23134]  
[63].  The study will determine if 2- weeks  of supplementation decreases NFkB signaling and 
increases PI3K signaling at baseline and in response to exercise.   NFkB  activity will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_23135] 9A or as follows for PI3K.  PI3K activity will be assessed by [CONTACT_23136] s (Millipore, Billerica, MA).  
H. Additional Signaling Pathway Members:  The regulation of inflammation and growth in 
macrophage s and muscle cells  is regulated by a complex network of signaling molecules.  Thus, in 
addition to NFkB and PI3K, other factors will also be measured for effects of supplementation and exercise [24;25;64] .  Of main interest are FOXO1,  STAT3, AKT, S6K, and ERK1 and 2.  The activity 
of these factors is regulated, in part, by [CONTACT_23137].  Matched antibody pairs are available to measure the ratio of these phosphorylated to un- phosphorylated proteins by W estern 
Blot (Cell Signaling Technology, [LOCATION_011], MA).  Pathway scanning kits are also available which 
include other related molecules in the cascade.  Muscle remains from the nutritional supplement 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_23052].  This muscle will enable an initial broad assessment of the 
signaling pathways affected by [CONTACT_23138].  The results will guide any changes in 
the specific factors cho sen for assay in muscle collected for the proposed study.  
I. Satellite Cells and Myonuclei:    Muscle adapts to resistance training through increases in satellite 
cell numbers and addition of nuclei to the myofiber [21].  However, these adaptations are 
diminished in older adults  [22].  The study will determine if 15 -weeks of supplementation increases 
the number of satellite cells and myonuclei per myofiber in muscle.  Satellite cells (Pax7+, CD56+, DAPI+) and myonuclei (Dystrophin plus DAPI [INVESTIGATOR_23053]) will be counted using established staining 
methods  [21]. 
J. Fiber Size:   Muscle also adapts to resistance training by [CONTACT_23139].  However, this 
growth is hindered in individuals, particularly older adults, who have a diminished satellite cell and myonuclei response to training [22].  The study will determine if [ADDRESS_22161] Dennis, PhD  
V11, 06-26-2017  Page 36  of 43 
 STATISTICAL PLAN :  The sample 
size (N=50 ) provides greater than 
80% power for Aims [ADDRESS_22162] deviation (SD) 
units at a 5% level of significance.  
Power calculations were based on 
using a one-sided t -test to compare 
independent groups  using data from 
our work and others [2;23;65]  though 
non-parametric test s or 
transformations will be used as 
necessary for data containing 
outliers .  There is no formal plan to 
adjust  for multiple comparisons .  
However, multiple correlation 
analysis will be used to determine the correlation between endpoints and any possible inflation in the overall Type I error rate.   This 
analysis will allow testing of the overall hypothesis that measures of immune function (Aim 1) will be  
positively correlated with adaptations to exercise (Aim 2) and retention of muscle strength, mass, and 
function after exercise training is halted (Aim 3).  The hypotheses are stated for each aim  and the time 
points  for comparison are listed in Table 6.
 
Aim 1 Power:   Aim 1 will determine if the supplement consumption for 2 -weeks improves baseline 
measures of immune function or the immune responses to vaccination or acute exercise.  The 
representative measures chosen to calculate power are change in muscle macrophage content after 
exercise (Finding 2) and change in CRP levels  post-supplementation (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_23054] 1).  Przyby[CONTACT_23140] a 29% increase in CD163+ macrophages in young subjects after exercise but no change 
in older subjects [2].  Power for this aim is calculated to detect at least a 29% greater increase in 
macrophages  in the supplement than the placebo group .  Przyby[CONTACT_23141] a nonparametric test  to 
lessen the effects of outliers.  To be more conservative here, the calculations here dropped the most 
extreme high and low data values before estimating effect sizes.  With that approach, the 29% increase 
corresponds to an effect size of 0.8 SD units (mean/SD = 0.128/0.159).  Similar results were found using CRP data from Pi[INVESTIGATOR_23055] 1.  The effect size for change in CRP is 0.85 SD units (mean/SD = 
0.665/0.780 for log- transformed data).  Having at least 20 subjects per group will provide 80% or 
greater power to detect a mean shift of 0.8- 0.85 SD units at a significance level of 5%  for the following 
Aim 1  hypotheses:  
a. The response to vaccination will be greater in the supplement than the placebo group.  The change between times K and A ( Table 6 ) will be compared between groups. 
b. The resting ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ t -cells will increase in the supplement but not in the placebo 
group.  The change between times G and C will be compared between groups. 
c. The change in t-cell subsets after acute exercise will be greater in the supplement than the placebo 
group.  The change between t imes I and G will be compared to the change between times E and C 
for both groups.  
d. Resting cytokine levels will decrease in the supplement but not in the placebo group.  Change will be 
compared between groups for blood ( times G and C) and muscle ( times H and D ).  Similar results 
are predicted for the MuRF and MAFbx atrophy -related transcripts.  
e. The increase in cytokine levels after acute exercise will be greater in the placebo group  than the 
supplement group .  For both groups, c hange between times I and G will be compared to the change Table 6.  Time points  are lettered for clear reference by [CONTACT_23142].

 between E and C for blood, and for muscle t he change between times J and H will be compared to 
the change between times F and D.  
f. The proliferative capacity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be greater in the supplement 
than the placebo  group .  The change between times G and C will be compared between groups.  
The change between times I and E will also be compared between groups. 
g. The resting number of muscle CD163+ macrophages will increase in the supplement but not in the 
placebo group.  The change between times H and D will be compared between groups.  
h. The number of muscle CD163+ macrophages will increase after acute exercise in the supplem ent 
but not in the placebo group.  The change between times J and H will be compared to change 
between times F and D for both groups.  
i. Resting NFkB activity will decrease  and PI3K activity will increase in the supplement group but not in 
the placebo group.  The change between time points H and D will be compared between groups.  
j. In response to acute exercise, NFkB activity will be lower and PI3K activity will be greater in the 
supplement group than in the placebo group.   The change between times J and H will be compared 
to change between times F and D for both groups.   Responses similar to NFkB are predicted for 
FOXO1, and responses similar to PI3K are expected for STAT3, AKT, P38 MAPK, and ERK 1 and 2.    
Aim 2 Power:  Aim [ADDRESS_22167] -training 
percent increase in muscle strength.  In a similar study, Trappe et al sought to improve strength gain by [CONTACT_23143].  The drug treatment group gained significantly more strength by 
25.1% than the group receiving placebo (26.4% vs. 21.1%, P<0.05) [23] .  The previous findings 
presented here (Finding 4) indicate that older subjects completing a 12- week training program but not 
taking supplements will experience an average strength gain of 25 ± 8%.  If treatment with the proposed supplement improves strength similarly to the Trappe drug treatment, subjects in the 
supplement group will improve strength by [CONTACT_5554] 31% (i.e., 25.1% greater than those of the placebo group).  This translates to an approximate effect size of 0.8 SD units (0.25*0.251/0.08) if 
variances are pooled for the groups compared.  With 20 subjects per group, there will be 80% power to 
detect a mean shift of 0.8 SD units using a significance level of 5%  for the Aim 2 hypotheses : 
a. The amount of strength gained from 12 -weeks of training will be greater in the supplement than the 
placebo group.  The change between times L and B will be compared between groups.  
b. The amount of muscle size gained from 12 -weeks of training will be greater in the supplement than 
the placebo group.  The change between times L and B will be compared between groups.  
c. The increase in muscle function after 12 -weeks of training will be greater in the supplement than the 
placebo group.  The change between times L and B will be compared between groups.  
d. The increase in muscle satellite cells after 12- weeks of training will be greater in the supplement 
than the placebo group.  The change between times M and D will be compared between groups.  
e. The increase in muscle myonuclei after 12- weeks of training will be greater in the supplement than 
the placebo group.  The change between ti mes M and D will be compared between groups.  
f. The increase in muscle fiber size after 12- weeks of training will be greater in the supplement group 
than the placebo group.  The change between times M and D will be compared between groups.  
Aim 3 Power:   Aim [ADDRESS_22168] -training during 26 weeks of long- term follow -up.  The representative response 
measure for this objective is the strength gain retained during long -term follow -up after exercise training 
is completed.  Lemmer et al observed an average gain in muscle strength of 27% (P<0.01) in older men after strength training which is similar the 25% gain presented here in Finding 4 [65].  Howev er, at

V11, 06-26-[ADDRESS_22169] -training follow -up, strength had decreased to be about 9% above pre -training levels.  
Assuming the same level of variation among our subjects in retention of strength gain as the observed 
8% SD for strength gain in Finding 4, then a 0.[ADDRESS_22170] size would be about 6.4% (0.8*0.08), 
translating to our supplement group retaining strength of 12.4% above pre -training levels.  With 20 
subjects per group, there will be 80% power to detect a mean shift of 0.8 SD units using a significance 
level of 5%.  If the SD for retention of strength is smaller than 8%, then we will have higher power to detect the same difference or equal power to detect smaller differences  for the following Aim 3 
hypotheses:  
a. The change in strength during the detraining period will be smaller in the supplement than the 
placebo group.  The change between times N and L will be compared between groups.  
b. The change in muscle size during the detraining period will be smaller in the supplement than the 
placebo group.  The chang e between times N and L will be compared between groups.    
c. The change in muscle function will be smaller in the supplement than the placebo group. The change between times N and L will be compared between groups.

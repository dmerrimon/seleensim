 applied only in the evening, while the Vehicle will be applied in the morning to keep the 
blinding between groups.  
Subjec ts in all the groups will undergo a further 4 -week treatment -free period from Week 12 to 
Week 16 (End of Study).  
Subject  visits are scheduled at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2 - Day 1), and Weeks 4 
(Visit 3), 8 (Visit 4), 12 (Visit 5) and 16 (Visit  6). Clinical determinations of efficacy will be 
conducted based on clinically visible or palpable lesions of AK in the treated areas at Weeks 4, 
8, 12 and 16  in comparison to Baseline. Comparisons will be made between the different 
strengths and dosing re gimen s of DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  and Vehicle  Cream . 
Local cutaneous tolerability will be determined at Baseline (Visit 2 –Day 1) and visits 3 – 6 for 
all treated areas.  Other safety assessments include physical examinations (HEENT, lungs, heart, 
abdomen, skin, neurologic) laboratory assessments, electrocardiogram (EKG), vital signs (blood 
pressure, pulse  rate), urine pregnancy tests, and collection of adverse event data.   
Number of Subjects : 
A total of  approximately 240 subjects  with actinic keratosis of the face  and/or scalp  will be 
randomized into  four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (60 subjects  in each group) at approximately 
20 centers.

1 INTRODUCTION  
Actinic keratosis (AK) is caused by [CONTACT_545348] 
(SCC) in situ . It is the most common carcinoma in situ  of the skin. For Europe, prevalence was 
reported to be up to 49% among males and 28% among females ( Flohil et al., 2013 ). Prevalence 
increases with increasing age ( Memon et al., 2000 ). AK occurs most commonly in fair skinned 
individuals ( Fitzpatrick skin types I and II and, to a lesser extent, III).  
The standard of care is to remove AK when diagnosed, which can be achieved either by 
[CONTACT_545349] (e.g. cryosurgery, curettage), chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] 5 -
fluorouracil, imiquimod, diclofenac, ingenol mebutate) or photodynamic therapy (PD T) with 
aminolevulinic acid or methylaminolevulinate.  
Solaraze®, which is widely used in the treatment of AK, contains 3% diclofenac in a gel 
formulation. The preparation is self -applied by [CONTACT_545350] a period of 90 days.  
Diclofenac and celecoxib  (the substance used in this clinical trial ) are non -steroidal anti -
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs ). NSAIDs act  against inflammation primarily by [CONTACT_545351] (COX) enzyme activity.  The mechanism of action of topi[INVESTIGATOR_6841] 3% gel 
(Solaraze) against AK lesions is unknown.  
Results of multiple in vitro  studies in cancer cell lines and in human tumor  xenograft mouse 
models have indicated that the type 2 isoform of the enzyme cycloxygenase is induced and plays 
critical roles in virtually all stages of tumor igenesis and proliferation (including tumor initiation, 
promotion, progression, survival, invasio n and  metastases)  in several pre -malignant conditions 
and malignancies, including those of the colon, breast, lung, skin, mouth, esophagus, stomach, 
pancreas, liver, prostate and blood ( Sobolewski  et al., 2010 ). However, inhibition of enzyme 
activity alo ne cannot explain the anti -tumor potential of the selective COX -[ADDRESS_713581] in HaCat 
keratinocytes, celecoxib has shown a 9 -fold higher potency compared to diclofenac in ter ms of 
growth inhibition (unpublished data). There is accumulating evidence of COX -[ADDRESS_713582] of celecoxib. These include enhancing tumor 
sensitivity to apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation ( Sobole wski et al., 2010 ). 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_6841] 3% gel, although better tolerated than many of the currently approved topi[INVESTIGATOR_545334], requires twice a day treatment for 60 to 90 days and has limited efficacy as 
shown in Table 1:

 Therefore, there is still a need for a topi[INVESTIGATOR_545335], with one or more of the 
following attributes: once a day convenient application, faster onset of action, increased lesion 
clearance rate, and/ or fewer, or less severe, side effects. DFD -07, a cream formulation 
containing celecoxib, has shown promise of fulfilling this need in in vitro  cell culture studies 
(unpublished data). These in vitro  cell culture studies indicate that celecoxib is approximately 9 
times as potent as diclofenac in inhibiting the growth of HaCaT (human keratinocyte) cell lines.  
In a 13-week dermal toxicity study in rats, daily application of  prototype  DFD -07 cream 
formulations containing celecoxib concentrations of 0.3%, 0.6%, 1.25%, and 2.5% 
(corresponding to absolute celecoxib dose levels of 6, 12, 25 or 50 mg/kg  /day, respectively),  for 
[ADDRESS_713584] was considered to be  more than 50 mg/kg/day   in both 
sexes under the conditions of testing in this study . 
In a study in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107] , dermal administration of prototype DFD -07 cream formulations 
containing celecoxib concentrations of 0 .6%, 1.25%, and 2.5% (corresponding to absolute 
celecoxib dose levels of 12, 25, or 50 mg/kg/day , respectively)  was well tolerated. Reversible, 
non-adverse, dermal irritation was observed without any correlating microscopic changes in all 
animals of the placebo group and DFD -07-treated group s and was attribut ed to constituent(s) of 
the formulation other than the active ingredient celecoxib . There was no evidence of celecoxib -
related systemic toxicity and no target organs were identified. Accordingly, the NOAEL was 
considered to be more than 5 0 mg/kg/day under the conditions of this study.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
4.1 Overall Plan  
This is a multi -center, rando mized, double -blind , parallel group,  Vehicle -controlled study.  The 
study products will be applied to a single contiguous  5 cm x 5 cm (25 cm2) treatment area 
containing the target lesions once or twice daily for a duration of [ADDRESS_713590] 18 years old, diagnosed with AK of 
the face  and/or scalp  will be randomized to treatment in one of the following four arms (60 
subjects  in each group):  
Treatment Group  Dose Strength  Dose Duration  DFD -07 Cream  Vehicle Cream  
   AM PM AM PM 
1 1.25%  12 Weeks  - √ √ - 
2 2.5%  12 Weeks  √ √ - - 
3 2.5%  12 Weeks  - √ √ - 
4 Vehicle  12 Weeks  - - √ √ 
4.2 Discussion of Design  
The study consists of three phases: Screening (up to 60 days), Treatment (12 weeks)  and 
Follow -Up (4 weeks).  In Groups 2 and 4 , the randomized  investigational products will be 
applied twice daily for 12 weeks to cover the entire  single contiguous 5 cm x 5 cm (25 cm2) 
lesional area on the face  and/or scalp. In Groups 1 and 3, the randomiz ed active DFD -07 
(celecoxib) Cream product will be applied only in the evening, while the Vehicle for DFD -07 
Cream will be applied in the morning to keep the blinding between groups.  
Subjects  in all the groups will undergo a further 4 -week treatment -free period from Week 12 to 
Week 16 (End of Study).  
The investigational products will be applied twice daily for 12 weeks to cover the entire lesional 
area (5 cm x 5 cm) on the face  and/or scalp  identified by [CONTACT_545354] . The dose 
for the study product will be a maximum of 0.5 g per application to the entire 5 cm x 5 cm area 
on the face and/or scalp for a maximum dose of 1.[ADDRESS_713591]  visits are scheduled at Screening (Visit 1), Baseline (Visit 2 - Day 1), and Wee ks 4 
(Visit 3), 8 (Visit 4), 12 (Visit 5) and 16 (Visit 6) . Clinical determinations of efficacy will be 
conducted based on clinically visible or palpable lesions of AK in the treated areas at Weeks 4, 
8, 12 and 16 in comparison to Baseline. Comparisons wil l be made between the different 
strengths and dosing regimen s of DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  and Vehicle  Cream . 
Local cutaneous tolerability will be determined at Visits 2 – 6 for the entire treated area.  Other 
safety assessments include physical examination s (HEENT, lungs, heart, abdomen, skin,

consu lted before discontinuing subjects  due to protocol deviations unless safety is a concern.  
Subjects  will be provided a diary card for documenting the dates of applications . The subjects  
will review the diary card with the Investigator or designee at each visit. The number of 
applications applied and t he number of  missed applic ations will be recorded on the source 
documents . By [CONTACT_108], there are no missed applications after the last date of treatment even if 
recorded on t he diary.  
In addition, tubes of study product will be weighed before dispensing and after  the return of the 
investigational products. At the last visit, the tube should be weighed before and after the 
application to determine the amount of study product applied for the last dose.  Thes e weights 
should  be entered into the CRF.  
6.5 Method of Assigning Subjects  to Treatment Groups  
Subjects  will be assigned randomly via IWRS to one of four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio 
(60 subjects  per treatment group) . A study medication assignment schedule will be created that 
is stratified by [CONTACT_3725] , with kit numbers randomly assigned to study products.  A randomization 
schedule will be produced for each site independently for use in randomization by [CONTACT_8784].  
The date and time of randomization, as well as the kit number , will be entered on the eCRF.    
The Investigator shall ensure that the study product  is only used by [CONTACT_545356]'s personal supervision or under the supervision of a sub-investigator responsible to 
the investigator and in accordance with the protocol.

 6.6 Blinding  
6.6.1 Method of Blinding  
This is a multi -center, randomized, double -blind, parallel group, Vehicle -controlled study.  The 
DFD -07 (celecoxib)  Cream and Vehicle Cream are whi te to off -white in color , and are similar  
in appearance, smell , and feel . The study medication kits (active and vehicle) will be marked for 
AM and PM use, so as to ensure blinding of the QD versus BID arms of the study. In the QD 
arms for the active product,  the active product marked PM will be applied in the evening while 
the vehicle product marked AM will be applied in the morning. Since the active and vehicle 
product are similar, the study blind is expected to be preserved by [CONTACT_162383].  
6.6.[ADDRESS_713609]  will know which medication they 
receive. DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream , 1.25% and 2.5% , and its matching Vehicle  for DFD -[ADDRESS_713610] identical packaging.  
The blind should be broken for all subjects suffering serious  adverse events ( SAE s) in which 
knowledge of the treatment assignment is critical to the subject ’s management. The blind for the 
subject  may be broken by [CONTACT_737], or designee, by [CONTACT_23793]. The blind 
should not be broken at the study site level except in a medical emergency (where knowledge of 
the study medication received would affect the treatment of the emergency). Fo r a medical 
emergency, the blind must only be broken following discussion with Sponsor medical monitor,  
on a case -by-case basis, at the discretion of the Investigator/treating physician/Sponsor.  
If the blind is broken, the date, time, and reason must be re corded in the subject ’s source record, 
eCRF, and any associated adverse event ( AE) report. If an Investigator, site personnel 
performing assessments, or subject is unblinded, the unblinding incident and unblinded subject 
must be listed as a major protocol deviation. A subject  for whom the blind is broken will 
discontinue study medication and be scheduled for a n End of Study  safety follow -up visit and 
then discontinued from the study. The subject will be encouraged to stay in the study until the 
AE is resolv ed or stabilized. All Investigators and the IRB will receive blinded safety reports. 
However, on the request of the IRB, the Sponsor will send unblinded reports directly to the IRB.  
6.[ADDRESS_713611] be recorded as an AE, if applicable.   
All medications (topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], oral, prescri ption, over -the-counter, and herbal medications) and 
medical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_112940]/conditions must 
be recorded on the eCRF.

7 STUDY PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS  
7.1 Screening  
A separate Screening Visit (Visit 1) may be performed when a washout period is required or for 
scheduling purposes.  Alternatively, Visits 1 (Screening) and 2 (Ba seline/Day 1) may be 
combined if no washout period is required.  The subject  number, date of visit, date of informed 
consent, reason for screen failure (if applicable) and study status will be captured in the eCRF 
for every screen failure subject . The Basel ine/Day 1 (Visit 2) Visit must occur no later than [ADDRESS_713612]  who received information about the study, including signing an 
informed consent and  possibly performing some study -related procedures , but was not 
randomized and/or did not use study product.

 7.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic variables include age (computed from date of birth and Baseline Visit date), race,  
ethnicity, weight, height and sex.  
7.[ADDRESS_713613] 5  or more AK  lesions within a single contiguous 5 cm x 5 
cm (25 cm2) area of the face and/or scalp . Only a single [ADDRESS_713614] has extensive lesions in an area spread over the face and scalp, the lesional area on 
the face will be preferably selected for treatment.  In order to determine  and identify the position 
of the treatment area at each Visit, a plastic grid foil will be laid on the treatment area(s)  and the 
contours of the treatment area (s) will be circumscribed. The lesions in the area will be 
circumscribed as well. Furthermore, f acial features like eyebrows, ears, etc. will be 
circumscribed and marked. The foil will be labelled with the subject  number  and filed in the 
source document . It will be used again at Visits 3 to 6 (EOS).  
The subject  will need to be instructed where the t reatment area is located. For this purpose, the 
Investigator will insert a drawing into the diary depi[INVESTIGATOR_545341].  
Subjects will be instructed to apply the study product  to the entire area as defined by [CONTACT_545357].  
Efficacy a ssessment  
The treated area will be inspected visually and by [CONTACT_23302]. This will always be done by [CONTACT_545358]  (unless the Investigator has delegated it to a 
trained designee, with proper documentation) . The number of AK lesions being either visible or 
palpable in the defined treatment area will be assessed at all study visits . All lesions in the 
treatment area will be included in the lesion count even if the lesion is  a new lesion tha t was not 
identifie d during the first Visit.  
7.4 Safety Variables  
Safety assessments include physical examination s (HEENT, lungs, heart, abdomen , skin, 
neurologic),  vital signs  (blood pressure, pulse  rate), 12-lead EKG s, 
hematology/chemistry/urinalysis  laboratory tests  (App endix 2), urine pregnancy tests for 
women of child bearing potential,  local tolerability evaluation  of the treated skin  (including 
erythema, edema, weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]/exudate, flaking/scaling/dryness, scabbing/crusting, 
erosion/ulceration, vesiculation/blistering) , and collection of adverse events (AEs)  data. Adverse 
events will be collected by [CONTACT_545359] , either verbal or recorded in the 
subject  diary, by [CONTACT_545360] , and by [CONTACT_4171]  (see Section 8  for details 
about AEs).  For female  subjects  of child bearing potential , urine pregnancy tests will be 
conducted at Screening, Baseline , and every subsequent visit . The test must have a sensitivity of 
at least 25  mIU/mL  for human chorionic gonadot ropin.  
Adverse events, whether believed by [CONTACT_545361], will 
be recorded on the CRF.

(including any cosmetic or therapeutic procedures, such as laser, peeling, and 
photodynamic therapy, within 2 cm of the selected treatment area and within the 2 weeks 
prior to the Baseline V isit) and AK history should be collected for the prior 1 -year 
period and concomitant medications , therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] , and procedures  collected from the prior 
6-month period. Only ongoing medical history items and ongoing concomitant 
medications should be entered on  the eCRF. AK history will be collected and recorded 
in the eCRF.  
5. Assess AK lesions (counting the visible and palpable lesions and measuring total area of 
lesions) to confirm that the subject  has a single contiguous 5cm x 5cm area that  qualifies 
for treatm ent on the face  and/or scalp.  If the subject has extensive lesions in an area 
spread over the face and scalp, the lesional area on the face will be preferably selected 
for treatment.    
6. Documentation of size and location of selected treatment area on grid foil 
7. Collect vital signs (blood pressure and pulse  rate). 
8. Screen subjects  according to the study inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine tentative 
eligibility. Initiate any protocol -required washout, if applicable.

determined or until all attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted  (“not 
recovered ” is not an acceptable outcome for acute c onditions). For other adverse events, the 
status at the last visit can be entered into the CRF.  
8.[ADDRESS_713625] be collected from the time treatment is initiated until the Week 16/End 
of Study Visit takes place.  Adverse events occurring from the time of the Screening Visit until 
the Baseline Visit associated with study procedures should also be reported  for all subjects  
including screen failures .   
8.2 Recording Adverse Events  
All AEs will be documented including  
• Severity  (see 8.3.1: Severity for details)  
• Start and stop date

 1. Mild :  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated. Not likely to interfere with 
normal activity or require medical attention.  
2. Moderate :  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity. May require 
medical intervention.  
3. Severe :  Incapacitating such that normal activity is prevented.  Likely requires medical 
intervention and/or close follow -up. 
8.3.[ADDRESS_713627]  (Causality)  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to assess the relationship between the study product  and the 
adverse event. The degree of “relatedness” of the adverse event to the study product  should  be 
described using the following categories:  
1. Not Related : The event is clearly due to extraneous causes (e.g., diseases, environment, 
etc.).  Specify if known . Or, the event is most probably  produced by [CONTACT_11259] ’s clinical state, therapeutic interv entions or concomitant therapy and does not 
follow a known response pattern to the study product . 
2. Possibly Related :  The event is temporally related to study product  use, but can be 
explained by [CONTACT_11693].  Information on the effect of study product  withdrawal 
may be lacking.  
3. Probably Related :  The event is temporally related to study product  use and is consistent 
with known effects of the study product  and/or improves upon withdrawal of the study 
product .  
4. Definitely Related :  The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
study product  administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study  
product, and could not have been produced by [CONTACT_1605] ’s clinic al 
state, therapeutic intervention or concomitant therapy, and either oc curs immediately 
following study  product administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_112945], or there is 
a positive reaction at the application site.  
8.3.3  Seriousness  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to determine the “seriousness” of an adverse event. A 
serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes:  
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening ( subject  at immediate risk of death)  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, are not life -threatening, or do not r equire 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions

until [ADDRESS_713635] one year previous experience in monitoring clinical studies. The monitor should be 
familiar wi th the etiology and signs and symptoms of Actinic Keratosis and the treatment 
options that are currently available.   
Before study initiation, the Investigator and site personnel will receive protocol training from 
the Sponsor’s representatives to ensure c ollection of accurate, consistent, complete and reliable 
data. This training will take place either at an Investigator Meeting or individually on -site. 
During the course of the study, a monitor will make multiple site visits to check the progress of 
the study, review consent forms, review protocol compliance, assess drug accountability, and 
ensure that the study is being conducted according to the protoco l and Good Clinical Practice.  
Any review of the subjects ’ original medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure 
that subject  confidentiality is maintained. The Investigator will ensure that the monitor or other 
compliance auditor is given acces s to all study -related documents and has adequate time and 
space to conduct the monitoring visit including availability of the Investigator and site personnel 
to discuss findings.  
Data capture methods will be designed to ensure accurate transfer of data to  electronic media.  
The Sponsor’s Quality Assurance representative will conduct QA audits randomly or if needed 
at 5-10% of the investigat ional  sites.

 Considering the exploratory dose -response character of the trial, and assuming a drop -out rate of 
10%, [ADDRESS_713637] s need to be recruited in each treatment group. With 4 treatment groups in the 
study, it is planned to recruit approximately 240 subjects in the study.  
 11.2 Analysis Data Set  
11.2.1  Intent to Treat  
The intent -to-treat population (ITT) will be the primary effi cacy analysis data set and consists of 
all subjects who are randomized and dispensed study medication.  
Missing data for efficacy analysis will be replaced using last observation carried forward 
(LOCF).  If a subject withdraws early from the study, that subject’s efficacy assessments 
captured at the early termination visit will be assigned to the nearest corresponding scheduled 
visit that has been missed.  
11.2.2  Per Protocol  
The PP popu lation will include all subjects  in the ITT population who complete the Week  16 
evaluation without any major protoc ol violations (i.e., any subject or Investigator activity that 
could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise 
evaluation of treatment efficacy).  
Specifically, the PP population will include subjects  in the ITT population who meet all of the 
following criteria:  
1. Subject met all inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
2. Subject  did not take any prohibited concomitant medications during th e evaluation 
period. The concomitant medication usage will be reviewed during the population 
determination review, remaining blinded to treatment designation, to determine 
prohibited medication usage that warrants exclusion from the PP population if they 
met the entry criteria without any protocol violations. This review will take into 
consideration the timing, duration of treatment with the concomitant medication, and 
influence on the efficacy and safety assessments prior to deeming a prohibited 
concomitan t medication as a protocol violation that warrants exclusion from PP.  
3. Completed the Week [ADDRESS_713638] 80% , but no more than 120% of the expected 
number of applications during  the entire treatment  period.  
Subjects  who prematurely discontinue from the study due to documented lack of efficacy, 
worsening condition, or a treatment -related AE will be included in th e PP population.  These 
subjects will be considered failures for all subsequent visits in the analysis of the primary and 
secondary endpoints of complete and partial clearance. Other than this, no imputations for 
missing data will be made for the PP populat ions.  
Other additional criteria may be added to the list to accommodate for unforeseen events that 
occurred during the conduct of the trial that result in noteworthy study protocol violations. 
These criteria will be documented with appropria te signature [CONTACT_545369], prior to database lock.  
   
   
 
 
Version 3.0  
DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream 1.25% and 2.5%  
Protocol DFD -07-CD-[ADDRESS_713639] demographic and baseline data characteristics will be reported in descriptive summaries 
by [CONTACT_545365], Per Protocol and Safety popul ations.  
11.4 Efficacy Analyses  
Efficacy summaries will be provided for the Intent  to Treat and Per Protocol  populations . 
Descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic means, SD, mi nimum, median, maximum) for all 
continuous values and frequency tables for categorical variables will be created. With regard to 
primary and secondary objectives as descriptive statistical evaluation , absolute and relative 
frequencies of number of observations will be presented together with 95 % - confidence 
intervals.  
In case of missing values the last -observation -carried forward principle shall be applied.  
A statistical testing procedure Chi -Quadrat test or a lternatively a binomial testing procedure will 
be applied. In case of small sam ple sizes al ternatively Fisher's exact test may be applied.  Other 
tests may be applied as required and these will be enumerated in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP).  
Further details of the statistical evaluation procedure will be presented in the Statist ical Analysis 
Plan (SAP). Analysis sets ( ITT population,  safety population , per-protocol population , rational 
for exclusion from any  population ) will also be specified in the SAP.  
Primary endpoint  
For statistical assessment of the primary endpoint with a significance level of 0.05% the 
following underlying hypotheses are used:  
H0: p1 ≤ p2 vs. H1: p1 > p2  
where p1 is the treatment effect of 2.5%  DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  twice daily  and p2  is the 
treatment effect of the  Vehicle Cream  preparation.  
Secondary endpoints  
For statistical assessment of all product comparisons after ce rtain period of treatment (i.e. at 
Visits 3, 4, 5  and 6 ) with a significance level of 0.05% the following underlying hypotheses are 
used:  
H0: p1 ≤ p2 vs. H1: p1 > p2  
where p1 is the tr eatment effect of 1.25%  or 2.5%  DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream  once daily and p2  
is the treatment effect of the  Vehicle C ream  preparation.  
For product and time point comparisons of medians, Mann -Whitney U -test and Wilcoxon -test 
may be applied.

treatment, outcome, and drug relatedness. The event onset will  also be shown relative (in 
number of days) to date of first administration.  
AEs related to study procedures done before study product  administration will be provided in a 
data listing.  
11.5.4  Vital Signs 
Changes from Baseline in vital signs (blood pressure, pulse  rate) will be summarized at each 
evaluation.  
11.5.5 Physical Examination and EKG  
Physical examinations  (HEENT, lungs, heart, abdomen, skin, and neurologic)  will be performed 
for all subjects at Baseline (Visit 2) and Week 12 (Visit 5).  EKG s will be performed for all 
subjects at Baseline (Visit 2), Week 4 (Visit 3), and Week 12 (Visit 5). Results will be presented 
in subject data listings.

A. PREAMBLE  
1. The Wo rld Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles for medical research involving human patient s, including research on identifiable 
human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be 
applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. T he 
WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human patient s to adopt 
these principles.  
B. GENERAL PRINCIPLES  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my 
patient will be my first consideration,” and the international Code of Medical Ethics declares that,”A 
physician shall act in the patient’s best interest when providing medical care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights of pat ients,   
including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge and conscience are 
dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human patient s.   
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human patient s is to understand the causes, 
development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and therapeutic interventions 
(methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best current in terventions must be evaluated 
continually through research for their safety, effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
7. Medical research is patient  to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human patient s 
and protect their he alth and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take 
precedence over the rights and interests of individual research patient s. 
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical researc h to protect the life, health, dignity, 
integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal information of research 
patient s. The responsibility for the protection of research patient s must always rest with the physician 
or oth er health care professionals and never with the research patient s, even though they have given 
consent.  
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research involving 
human patient s in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No 
national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the 
protections for research patient s set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimizes possible harm to the environment.

Protocol DFD -07-CD-[ADDRESS_713645], incentives for patient s and information regarding provisions 
for treating and/or compensating patient s who are harmed as a consequence of participation in th e 
research study. In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -
trial provisions.   
 
F. RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES  
 
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and approval to the 
concer ned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in 
its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and 
must be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the l aws and regulations of the country or 
countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and 
standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research 
patient s set forth in this Declaration. The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. 
The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about 
any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without c onsideration and 
approval by [CONTACT_942]. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
 
G. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research patient s and the confidentiality of 
their personal information.  
 
H. INFORMED CONSENT  
 
25. Participation by [CONTACT_545367] s in medical research must 
be voluntary. Although it may be appr opriate to consult family members or community leaders, no 
individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in a research study unless he or she 
freely agrees.  
26. In medical research involving human patient s capable of giving informed consent, ea ch potential 
patient  must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts 
of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the 
study and the discomfort it may  entail, post -study provisions and any other  relevant aspects of the 
study. The potential patient  must be informed of the right to refuse to participate in the study or to 
withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. Special attention sho uld be given to the 
specific information needs of individual potential patient s as well as to the methods used to deliver the 
information. After ensuring that the potential patient  has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qual ified individual must then seek the potential patient 's freely -given informed 
consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non -written consent 
must be formally documented and witnessed. All medical research patient s should be given the option 
of being informed about the general outcome and results of the study.  
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician should be 
particularly cautious if the potential patient  is in a dependent rel ationship with the physician or may 
consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent should be sought by [CONTACT_11274].  
28. For a potential research patient  who is incapab le of giving informed consent, the physician must seek 
informed consent from the legally authorized representative. These individuals must not be included 
in a research study that has no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is intended to promote the 
health of the group represented by [CONTACT_545368] , the research cannot instead be performed with 
persons capable of providing informed consent, and the research entails only minimal risk and 
minimal burden.  
   
   
 
 
Version 3.0  
DFD -07 (celecoxib) Cream 1.25% and 2.5%  
Protocol DFD -07-CD-[ADDRESS_713646] seek that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative. The potential patient 's dissen t should be 
respected.  
30. Research involving patient s who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent, for example, 
unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that prevents giving 
informed consent is a necessary cha racteristic of the research group. In such circumstances the 
physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorized representative. If no such 
representative is available and if the research cannot be delayed, the study may proceed without 
inform ed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving patient s with a condition that 
renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study 
has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to rem ain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the patient  or a legally authorized representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their care are related to the research. The 
refusal of a patient to participat e in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must 
never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship.  
32. For medical research using identifiable human material or data, such as research on material or data 
contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, 
storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or 
impracticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the research may be  done only after 
consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
I. USE OF PLACEBO  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the 
best proven intervention(s), except in the following circums tances:  
a. Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or  
b. Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodological reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of plac ebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention and the patients who receive 
any intervention less effective than the best proven one, placebo, or no intervention will not 
be patient  to additional risks of seriou s or irreversible harm as a result of no t receiving the 
best proven intervention. Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option.  
J. POST -TRIAL PROVISIONS  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should make  
provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention identified as 
beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed 
consent process.  
K. RESEARCH REGISTRATION AND PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF RESULTS  
35. Every research study involving human patient s must be registered in a publicly accessible database 
before recruitment of the first patient .  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations wi th regard to the 
publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly 
available the results of their research on human patient s and are accountable for the completeness and 
accuracy of their reports. All partie s should adhere to accepted guidelines for ethical reporting. 
Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly 
available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest should be d eclared in 
the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other known 
intervention s have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent

 from the patient or a legally authorized representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the 
physician's judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishi ng health or alleviating suffering. This 
intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and 
efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly 
available.

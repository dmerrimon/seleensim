[ADDRESS_671116] Context:  (Background) Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a significant public health problem in that it both harms children and is widely prevalent, affecting more than 40% of US children. Tobacco cessation quitlines are effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_328970], but few smokers make use of their services. Electronic health record-based systems that automate referral of interested parents to quitlines through pediatric settings may increase the proportion of smokers who successfully enroll in treatment. Objectives: (primary and important secondary objectives) Primary Objective: To compare through a randomized clinical trial parent smoker enrollment in the tobacco quitline using an electronic referral process (parent information sent to quitline with quitline calling the parent) to the current standard manual process (giving the parent the quitline phone number).  Secondary Objective: To explore certain parent and child factors associated with successful enrollment in and willingness to receive services from the tobacco quitline in order to inform future interventions that maximize impact. Study Design:  We propose a randomized controlled study of electronic quitline referral compared to standard practice. Parent enrollment in the quitline will be reported to the study team by [CONTACT_517529], managed by [CONTACT_268913]. Setting/Participants: This is a single site study at one large outpatient pediatric practice (Karabots). Eligible study participants are parents/caregivers (hereafter referred to as “parents”), 18 years of age or older, who are present for the child’s healthcare (both well-child and acute) visit, who smoke, and who are interested in receiving treatment through the tobacco quitline. Study Interventions and Measures:  The intervention is electronic referral to the tobacco quitline for parent smokers. The referral process will be embedded in a tobacco treatment clinical decision support (CDS) tool, created to help pediatricians provide counseling and treatment to parent smokers. The primary outcome of interest is smoker enrollment in the quitline, defined as the proportion of parent smokers identified in the clinic that enroll in quitline treatment compared across the intervention (electronic referral) and control (standard practice) approaches. Secondary outcomes include patient and parent demographic and behavioral factors associated with successful enrollment. 
   
   1 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE 1.1 Introduction Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a significant public health problem in that it both harms children, increasing their risk of acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_18073], asthma exacerbations, sudden infant death syndrome, and premature death,(1) and is widely prevalent, affecting more than 40% of US children.(2) When a parent quits smoking, they eliminate the majority of their children’s SHS exposure,(1)(3)(4) decrease the risk of their children becoming smokers when they grow up,(5) and increase their own life expectancy by [CONTACT_5554] 10 years.(6) Pediatricians are uniquely positioned to educate and motivate parents towards protecting their children from SHS.(7) Parents who smoke are often underserved medically, but see their child’s doctor an average of 4 times each year, significantly more than they themselves see a clinician.(8) Parents expect their pediatrician to ask about their smoking status and are interested in their pediatrician providing smoking cessation medication and connecting them to additional resources,(9) such as tobacco counseling quitlines.(10) Despi[INVESTIGATOR_517527], pediatricians rarely provide such treatments.(11) Nationally, of parents who smoke who had accompanied their child to the pediatric clinician in the past year, only 38% were advised to quit and 15% had treatment options recommended to them.(9) Tobacco cessation quitlines are effective in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_328970],(12)(13) but few smokers make use of their services. Less than 3% of smokers who saw their healthcare provider in the last year report being connected to them, (14) and only 8% of smokers who are trying to quit, and who are aware of quitlines, actually use them. (15) Quitlines provide free (to the user) population-based treatment to tobacco users available through a nationwide consortium (1-800-QUIT-NOW). Telephone counseling can be proactive or reactive. In a proactive approach the counselor initiates one or more calls to provide support in making a quit attempt or avoiding relapse. Reactive counseling in contrast is available on demand for people who smoke, or their friends and family.(13)(16) Electronic health records (EHRs) and clinical decision support (CDS) systems may improve the quality and standardization of clinical interventions for tobacco use.(17)(18)(19) Additionally, the EHR may reduce the costs and burden of delivering tobacco dependence interventions by [CONTACT_517530].(19) In adult settings, CDS systems that automate referral of interested patients to quitlines significantly increase the proportion of smokers who successfully enroll in treatment.(20)(21) Use of CDS tools help pediatric clinicians provide counseling and prescribe nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to parents who smoke in pediatric primary care and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_69225].(22)(23) For pediatric developmental evaluation, automated referrals to early intervention (EI), compared to the standard practice of handing the parent a phone number and asking him or her to make the connection, are strongly associated with completion of multidisciplinary evaluation by [CONTACT_517531].(24) No pediatric-based studies have evaluated automated electronic referral to quitlines with proactive counseling compared to standard practice (giving the parent the quitline phone number) for parent smoker enrollment in the quitline program. We hypothesize that automated electronic referral will increase enrollment into the quitline program compared to standard practices of providing the number quitline number to the parent.  
   
   [ADDRESS_671117] or Intervention The electronic quitline referral will be embedded within the Tobacco Treatment CDS tool, CDS system previously developed to help pediatricians provide smoking cessation counseling and treatment to parents who smoke,(22) modeled off the CEASE intervention, an evidence-based approach for implementing smoking cessation treatment of parents in the pediatric setting.(25) The parental tobacco treatment CDS tool, which interfaces seamlessly within the EHR (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457]®, Epic Sytems, Inc, Verona, WI, [LOCATION_003]), prompts the pediatric clinician to ask the parent about smoking status and assess interest in quitting (at all well-child and acute visits), links to an electronic nicotine replacement therapy prescription for parents interested in quitting, and guides appropriate documentation. Electronic referral to the quitline will be made by [CONTACT_517532]’ names and telephone numbers (entered by [CONTACT_15370]) directly to the Pennsylvania (PA) Free Quitline. This approach matches an existing workflow for CDS for other aspects of pediatric care already successfully in use by [CONTACT_517533].(26)(27)(28)(29) Parent information will be sent using secure, HIPAA-compliant methods to transmit protected health information, coordinated by [CONTACT_517534] (DBHi).

   [ADDRESS_671118] referral practice.  2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim) To compare through a randomized clinical trial parent smoker enrollment in the tobacco quitline using an electronic referral process (parent information sent to quitline with quitline calling the parent) to the current standard manual process (giving the parent the quitline phone number).  2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim) To explore certain parent and child factors associated with successful enrollment in and willingness to receive services from the tobacco quitline in order to inform future interventions that maximize impact. [ADDRESS_671119] number. Parent enrollment in the quitline will be reported to the study team by [CONTACT_517529], managed by [CONTACT_268913]. 3.1.1 Screening Phase Potential parent subjects will be screened using the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Parent subjects will be recruited at their child’s medical visit by [CONTACT_332424]. If parents are interested in using the tobacco quitline, they will be referred either via the standard method or through the electronic referral process.   3.1.2 Study Treatment Phase (start of the study intervention) Parent subjects will be referred to the tobacco quitline, either through electronic referral (intervention) or the standard manual process (control).  3.[ADDRESS_671120] broker as part of the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics (DBHi). This will allow for blinding of the clinicians to the allocation.  
   
   [ADDRESS_671121] will be up to 6 days, with 1 day of screening, up to 5 days of interactions with the tobacco quitline. Both the parent and the child are considered subjects. The parent receives the intervention but the child's data will also be collected. 3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected The study will be conducted at 1 investigative site in the [LOCATION_002] at the Karabots Pediatric Care Center, within the CHOP care network at The Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684].   Recruitment will stop when approximately 601 parent subjects are enrolled (referred to the quitline via either approach). It is expected that approximately [ADDRESS_671122]. Thus, a total of 1202 subjects (601 parents plus 601 related children) will be enrolled.  3.4 Study Population 3.4.1 Inclusion Criteria Eligible subjects will include parents, 18 years of age or older, present for the child’s healthcare (both well-child and acute) visit, who smoke, and who are interested in being referred to the tobacco quitline.  3.4.[ADDRESS_671123] party. Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria will not be enrolled.  4 STUDY PROCEDURES 4.1 Study Treatment Phase Potential parent subjects will be screened for smoking in the context of their child’s medical visit. If a parent smoker is identified and they are interested in treatment, the pediatric clinician will obtain their permission to refer the parent to the tobacco quitline. 4.2 Tobacco Quitline Phase The PA Free Quitline will reach out to interested parent subjects and provide telephone based counseling (see Section 7.1 for intervention description). The Quitline will collect information regarding parent smoker subject counseling. This information will be 
   
   [ADDRESS_671124] information from the child patient’s electronic medical chart and present that information to the study team as a de-identified data set (see section 5.1.1 for variable description).   
   
   [ADDRESS_671125] broker – DBHi – will be providing all data between CHOP and from the PA Free Quitline, presenting information to the study team in de-identified reports. 5.1.[ADDRESS_671126] information from the child patient’s electronic medical chart and present that information to the study team as a de-identified data set. This data will be merged by [CONTACT_517535], the honest broker, with data from the Quitline. The following variables will be abstracted: - Patient age - Patient race/ethnicity - Patient insurance status - Presence of chronic condition (e.g. Asthma) - Parent baseline smoking characteristics, including: o Number of cigarettes smoked per day o Stage of change assessed by [CONTACT_517536] 30 days or 6 months In addition to data abstracted from the patients’ medical charts, parent smokers who are interested in treatment will have their name [CONTACT_517547] [CONTACT_517537], to be electronically sent to the tobacco quitline. 5.1.2 Information collected from tobacco quitline - Pennsylvania (PA) Free Quitline The PA Free Quitline will collect the following information from/about parent smoker subjects: - Parent baseline smoking characteristics, including: o Number of cigarettes smoked per day o Stage of change assessed by [CONTACT_517536] [ADDRESS_671127] is smoker enrollment in the quitline, defined as the proportion of parent smokers identified in the clinic that enroll in quitline treatment 
   
   7 compared across the intervention (electronic referral) and control (standard practice) approaches.  Secondary outcomes include patient and parent demographic and behavioral factors associated with successful enrollment. Multivariable logistic regression models will be used to assess the adjusted association of independent variables with dependent variables. Additionally, the RE-AIM conceptual framework – a systematic way to evaluate the impact of public health interventions (30), used in a variety of healthcare settings and for varied conditions (31) – will help contextualize parent enrollment in the quitline and improve understanding of system implementation. The RE-AIM model includes the [ADDRESS_671128]. Reach will be calculated as the number of parent smokers who visited the clinic who subsequently talked with the quitline divided by [CONTACT_517538]. Efficacy will be calculated as the total number of parent smokers who visited the clinic who enrolled in treatment with the quitline divided by [CONTACT_517539]. Adoption will be measured as the proportion of clinicians who refer parent smokers to the quitline (that is, the proportion of clinicians who use the tool who received the tool prompt). We hypothesize that the efficacy of the standard practice approach will exceed that of the electronic referral approach because parent smokers who followed up with referrals on their own (using the number provided by [CONTACT_517540]) would be more motivated to enroll in cessation treatment. Thus, we will multiply reach by [CONTACT_517541] a composite measure of overall impact.(21)   5.[ADDRESS_671129] practice. The only identifying information that will be collected for the parent subjects will be participants’ name [CONTACT_41319]. Once data collection is completed, the master list containing only the names of the study participants will be deleted. No other PHI identifiers will be collected at any time, and no other PHI identifiers will be stored for parent subjects.

   9 7  STUDY INTERVENTION 7.1 Description Intervention – electronic referral to quitline  The electronic quitline referral will be embedded within the Tobacco Treatment CDS tool, a CDS system previously developed to help pediatricians provide smoking cessation counseling and treatment to parents who smoke,(22) modeled off the CEASE intervention, an evidence-based approach for implementing smoking cessation treatment of parents in the pediatric setting.(25) The parental tobacco treatment CDS tool, which interfaces seamlessly within the EHR (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_39457]®, Epic Sytems, Inc, Verona, WI, [LOCATION_003]), prompts the pediatric clinician to ask the parent about smoking status and assess interest in quitting (at all well-child and acute visits), links to an electronic nicotine replacement therapy prescription for parents interested in quitting, and guides appropriate documentation. Electronic referral to the quitline will be made by [CONTACT_517532]’ names and telephone numbers (entered by [CONTACT_15370]) directly to the Pennsylvania (PA) Free Quitline. This approach matches an existing workflow for CDS for other aspects of pediatric care already successfully in use by [CONTACT_517533].(26)(27)(28)(29) Parent information will be sent using secure, HIPAA–compliant method to transmit protected health information.  Control All procedures implemented in the standard referral approach will be identical to those in the electronic referral approach with the exception of providing the telephone number for the Quitline to the parent (rather than electronic referral). The clinician workflow will be nearly the same, in that the clinician will use the link embedded in the tobacco treatment CDS tool to add the quitline to the patient’s discharge paperwork (rather than automatically refer to the quitline).  Quitline Delivered Treatment  The PA Free quitline is funded by [CONTACT_517542] [ADDRESS_671133] party. All smokers who enroll in smoking cessation treatment will receive counseling and support consistent with accepted clinical practice guidelines.(32) This treatment includes as many as [ADDRESS_671134] call, and additional calls generally occurring at 2- to 3-week intervals thereafter. The call timing will be flexible and adjusted as needed. 
   
   10 8 SAFETY MANAGEMENT 8.1 Clinical Adverse Events Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study.  8.2 Adverse Event Reporting Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
   
   [ADDRESS_671135] protected and will not be stored on portable media devices (e.g., flash drives).   9.[ADDRESS_671136] practice. The only identifying information that will be collected for parent subjects will be parent participants’ name [CONTACT_41319]. That information, entered during the clinical care encounter by [CONTACT_517543], will be collected by [CONTACT_517544] (within the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics), and information about parent enrollment in the quitline will be presented back to the study team in de-identified reports. Once data collection is completed, the master list containing the names of the study participants will be deleted by [CONTACT_517534] (DBHi). The Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics will also build the final 
   
   [ADDRESS_671137] care of pediatricians. 9.4.4 Risk-Benefit Assessment From a risk-benefit assessment perspective, the potential large benefits outweigh the minimal risk posed by [CONTACT_1758], justifying proceeding with the trial.  9.5 Recruitment Strategy Identification of parent smokers will be achieved through the clinical care encounter.  9.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization We request a waiver of obtain informed consent as the research meets the criteria of 45 CFR 46.116(d), in that:  1) the research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects as this is a study aimed to improve parent smoker enrollment in the state tobacco quitline. The quitline offers evidence-based tobacco cessation counseling, and referral to this resource is already part of standard practice.; 
   
   13 2) the waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects as parent smokers are being connected with evidence-based resources that they could already use or not use at their discretion; 3) the research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver as obtaining consent would introduce significant bias into the study. Parents referred to the quitline could potentially change their behavior if they knew they were being studied, decreasing the likelihood that they would be willing to be referred (either electronically or the standard approach) to an evidence-based tobacco treatment quitline service. We would not be able to practicably achieve the first objective of the study to determine if electronic referral to the state tobacco quitline for parent smokers increases program enrollment compared to standard referral practice; and, 4) after their study participation, the parent subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information about their participation in study aimed at helpi[INVESTIGATOR_517528]. This information will be posted throughout the clinic.  9.6.[ADDRESS_671138] a waiver of HIPAA authorization as the use of protected health information (parent name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_3031]) involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of the parent subjects based on the presence of the following elements:  1) there is an adequate plan to protect the identifiers from improper use and disclosure;  2) there is an adequate plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent with conduct of the research; and  3) the protected health information will not be reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research project, or for other research for which the use or disclosure of protected health information would be permitted by [CONTACT_201815];  a. The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration (for the reasons detailed above); and  b. The research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the protected health information (we would not be able to connect parents to the tobacco quitline if their name [CONTACT_3669] [CONTACT_517545]).   9.7 Payment to Subjects/Families No payments will be made to the subjects for participation in the study.   10 PUBLICATION After completion of the study, a manuscript will be prepared for publication.

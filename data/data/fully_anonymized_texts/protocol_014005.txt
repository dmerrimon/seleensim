Page 9 of 62 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background  
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy with poor prognosis and limited 
response to therapy (1 -3). Recurrence after surgical resection is very common in patients presenting with 
localized disease and systemic therapy is the primary treatment for patients with recurrent or advanced 
disease. The combination of cisplatin/etoposide/doxorubicin/mitotane is the current standard of care for 
metastatic ACC. This combinatio n has a suboptimal response rate of 23% with median time to 
progression of about 5 months while second line therapy (streptozocin with mitotane) has response rate of 
9% with median time to progression of about 2 months (4).  
In order to understand factors related to chemotherapy resistance and to identify better treatment 
options, we recently studied the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor (cMET) in ACC. 
Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses indic ated that increased HGF/cMET expression in 
human ACC samples was positively associated with cancer- related biologic processes, including 
proliferation and angiogenesis, and negatively correlated with apoptosis. Accordingly, treatment of ACC cells with exogenous HGF resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo while short hairpin 
RNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of cMET with cabozantinib suppressed cell 
proliferation and tumor growth (Figure 1) (5).

Page 10 of 62 Moreover, exposure of ACC cell line to commonly used treatments in ACC (mitotane, cisplatin, 
or radiation) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_881250]- cMET  expression and was associated with an enrichment of genes (e.g., 
CYP450 family) related to therapy resistance, further implicating cMET in the anticancer drug response. 
Together, these data suggest an important role for HGF/cMET signaling in adrenocortica l carcinoma 
growth and resistance to commonly used treatments (5). Targeting cMET, alone or in combination with 
other drugs, could provide a breakthrough in the management of this aggressive cancer.   
Based on these preclinical data, we have recently used cabozantinib outside clinical trial to treat a 
patient with progressive ACC that failed multiple lines of treatment (Figure 2A) . Within 4 weeks of 
cabozantinib use, target lesions stopped growing and slightly reduced in size (one target lesion in left upper quadrant reduced  from 8.[ADDRESS_1232004] dimension to 6.6 cm)(Figure 2B). This 
patient had grade [ADDRESS_1232005] very good performance status (ECOG 1) 
while on cabozantinib 60 mg daily. Cabozantinib  was maintained and radiological stability was 
demonstrated stable disease for 12 months on therapy.

Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that targets 
the V EGF, c -MET, and RET receptors. Cabozantinib drug is  approved for the treatment of medullary 
thyroid carcinoma and was recently approved in renal cell carcinoma (7, 8). Receptor tyrosine kinases 
(RTKs) regulate many processes including cell growth and survival, organ morphogenesis, 
neovascularization, and tissue repair (12). Dysregulation of RTKs by [CONTACT_147844], gene rearrangement, gene 
amplification, and overexpression of both receptor and ligand have been implicated as causative factors in 
the development and progression of numerous human cancers. The RTK c-Met, encodes the high -affinity 
receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or scatter factor (SF) (12). c-Met and HGF are each required 
for normal mammalian development and have been shown to be important in cell migration, morphogenic differentiation, and organization of three-dimensional tubular structures (e.g., renal tubular cells, gland 
formation, etc .), as well as cell growth, angiogenesis, and tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Up-
regulation of MET is found in a wide range of malignancies including thyroid, prostate, ovarian, lung, and breast cancers, and is associated with more aggressive and invasive phenotypes of cancer cells in vitro 
and metastases in vivo (see latest version of the Investigator’s Brochure). C- Met-driven metastasis may 
be exacerbated by a number of factors, including tumor hypoxia caused by [CONTACT_881275].  
Evidence linking c -Met and HGF as causative or progression factors in human cancers include: 
(1) the overexpression of both receptor and ligand in neoplasms relative to surrounding tissues; (2) the 
correlation of receptor and ligand overexpression with dis ease severity and outcome; (3) genetic alteration 
of c-Met by [CONTACT_408230]; (4) introduction of c- Met and HGF 
(or mutant c -Met) into cell lines, conferred the properties of tumorgenicity and metastatic propensity on 
engineered cells; (5) introduction of c- Met or HGF as transgenes into the germline of mice resulted in 
primary and secondary neoplasms; and (6) the inhibition of c-Met or HGF function with dominant-negative receptors, antibody antagonists (both Met and HGF), and biologic antagonists (e.g., NK4) have reversed cancer-associated phenotypes such as motility, invasion and proliferation of tumor cells, and 
tumor growth and dissemination in vivo (12) . A wide variety of human cancers, including brain, 
colorectal, gastric, and lung, demonstrate dysregulated c- Met activity (13), either by [CONTACT_3553] c -Met 
kinase overexpression (14) , or increased autocrine and/or paracrine secretion of the c-Met ligand, 
HGF/SF . These alterations have been implicated in tumor progression and metastasis, and a high constitutive activation of c-Met has been correlated with poor clinical prognosis (15).  
VEGFR2 is the predominant mediator of VEGF -stimulated endothelial cell migration, proliferation, 
survival, and enhanced vascular permeability(16) . Increased expression of VEGFR2, often in combination 
with VEGFR3, has been observed in the tumor vascular endothelium in most common human solid tumor 
types, on tumor cells in melanoma and hematological malignancies, and in colitis -associated colon cancer 
(17) . High VEGFR2 expression is an unfavorable prognostic biomarker in hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC), and correlated with triple- negative (i.e., therapy- resistant) breast cancer.  The expression of VEGF 
and VEGFR -2 as well as microvessel density were higher in ACC compared to benign adrenal neoplasms 
(18). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_39044], targeting VEGF signaling alone had limited clinical efficacy in ACC (19) . 
Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of cMET and VEGFRs by [CONTACT_881276] a broad spectrum of antineoplastic activity and its use in ACC is appealing based on recently published preclinical data and early reports of human experience.  
As an exploratory objective, we also aim to generate crucial preliminary data about the changes in 
immune markers in association with cabozantinib study. The adrenal gland can be recognized by [CONTACT_881277] l insufficiency (Addison’s disease).

Page 12 of 62 Mononuclear cells infiltrating  (mainly CD3+)  the adrenal glands on autopsies are more common in 
people 60 years and older (63%) compared to subjects <49 years old (7%). CD4+ cells are more common 
than CD8+ cells and are thought to have been activated by [CONTACT_13204] 2 receptor(20) . In Merkel cell 
carcinoma, higher CD3+ and CD8+ immune infiltrates at the periphery of tumor were associated with improved overall survival (21).  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are increasingly used in multiple malignancies. 
Imatinib mesylate has known clinical benefits in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and has been 
reported to have direct effects on tumor cells as well as indirect immunostimulatory effects on 
lymphocytes and high densities of CD3+ tumor infiltrating cells correlated with PFS (22). The number of 
infiltrating FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells and macrophages is even higher in  in metastatic GIST compared to primary lesions. I matinib and sunitinib  increased the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in 
macrophage cultures thus affecting the tumor  microenvironment  (23). Similarly, cabozantinib has direct 
effect on tumor cells as well as immunomodulatory effect that enhances the sensitivity of tumor cells to T cell-mediated lysis  (24). Clinical trials using immunotherapy in ACC are emergi ng and it remains unclear 
if prior use of immunotherapy will affect the response to TKIs in ACC or if using TKIs can enhance the response to subsequent immunotherapy. Thus, data generated from patients in this study can further our 
understanding of the complex effect of TKIs on tumor immune infiltrate and could lead to new treatment 
combinations in the future.  Analyses of tumor and blood samples: These studies will be performed at MDACC  in collaboration with 
[CONTACT_881293] who is supervising the Translational Molecular Pathology - Immunoprofiling 
Laboratory (TMP -IL). P atient samples will be collected to perform immunologic analyses. The study will 
allow for the collection of blood samples  to be drawn at the time of routine blood-draw to assess circulating 
immune markers. Whole blood, plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and other 
secreted markers (such as cytokines) may be collected at 3 time points (before  and during treatment and at time of disease progression) and processed at the TMP -IL for further downstream analyses.  
Option al biopsies will be used for immune -profiling analysis (core needle biopsies (CNBs). Fresh tissue 
samples will be sent immediately after collection to TMP -IL. Core biopsy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_599019] 21-
18 gauge needle and with condition permitting, up to 5 cores should be collected, including 2 for clinical processing and 3 additional passes will be attempted to obtain the research core samples.   
Cores 1 and 2: Immediate and overnight fixation in 10% buffered formalin for paraffin embedding, 
usually within 20- 24 hour after fixation. For biopsies performed on Friday, fixation time may 
extend to 48 hours (FFPE samples) Cores 3 -4: Flash freezing in liquid nitrogen.  
Core 5 : Flow cytometry analysis of TIL and TME on fresh tissue.  
 
All ti ssue spec imens collected  will be review ed by [CONTACT_881278]. At least, three  types o f QC  
activiti es for specimens collected  will be perfo rmed: a) his tology/cytology ex amination of the tissues and 
cells to confirm the presence of tumor cells, as well as their abunda nce (tumo r cellularity); b) tissue 
quality assessme nt of fresh specimens for ext raction of DNA, RNA an d prote ins, and to prepare histology 
specimens such as whole sections for i mmu nohis tochemi stry a nd immu nofluo rescence; and, c) qua lity

Using immun ohistochemi stry (IHC) and multiplex immu nofluo rescence (IF) approach that is available 
in the TMP -IL (Drs. Wistuba  and Jaime Rodriguez Canales), we will quantitatively assess multiple immune 
markers. Fresh frozen tissues will be also used for analysis of immune markers. IHC and IF will be performed using autostainers. All antibodies used will be optimized for IHC/IF by [CONTACT_881279], including Western blotting. All

Page 13 of 62 pathology slides will be scanned into a digital image scanner and analyzed using image analysis software; 
IHC analysis will be performed using the Aperio Image Toolbox™ (Leica Biosystems) and IF analysis 
using the Vectra Inform ™ (Perkin -Elmer) software.  Nucleic acids ( DNA and RNA) and prote in ex traction: 
Blood (plasma  and PMBC s) and  tumor (CNB) samp les will be su bjected to extr action using s tandard 
meth ods. DNA and RNA quanti ty and i ntegr ity will be ass essed using NanoDr op 1000 
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop technologi es) and Pi[CONTACT_3252]-gree n analyses.  Also, protein lysate will be 
extracted  using standa rd metho ds. 
High order flow cytometry panels will focus on 1) delineation of major immune cell types (T cells, B cells, 
NK cells, DC), 2) determination of T cell differentiation status and limited functionality (IFN γ, TNFα, GB) 
and 3) defining the expression level of costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules on T cells and their respective receptors such as PD -L1 on infiltrating myeloid cells or tumor. Briefly, 50 cc of heparinized 
peripheral blood from cancer patients prior  to the initiation of treatment, during treatment, and at time  of 
progression will be processed fresh (within 24h of being drawn) for PBMC isolation by [CONTACT_588213]. PBMCs will be cryopreserved and stored in Liquid Nitrogen until use. Flow cytometric analysis will be conducted retrospectively on cryopreserved PBMCs. When appropriate, cells will be thawed and stained immediately. All time points belonging to a patient will be stained and acquired at the same time to avoid any technical variation (sample at time of progression will be omitted for responders if analysis needs to be completed 
when patient is still responding).  We expect that half of the study participants will agree to have the optional 
biopsies and we anticipate to collect blood samples from all participants.  
  
 
In another exploratory objective, we will attempt to assess the role of  genetic variants of drug disposition 
genes on the PK of cabozantinib .For the past decades, pharmacogenomic association studies have 
revealed a significant influence of genetic variants on the disposition of various drugs prescribed in the 
cancer care setting (e.g. tacrolimus, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and 6- MP).  This continues to be an 
increasingly popular area of pharmacological research.  Cabozantinib is a substrate for both cytochrome 
P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and the drug transporter MRP2, and maybe a substrate for other obscure drug 
metabolizing enzymes and transporters.  Hypothetically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
these genes may affect cabozantinib PK.  However, there is a dearth of data regarding the se potential  
genetic associations.  To preliminary assess for potential associations, a single blood sample (~ 10 ml) will be collected at the patient’s first clinic visit for exploratory pharmacogenomic testing.  Whole blood 
will be collected into pre -labelled lavender -top collection tubes.  Genomic DNA will be isolated from 
each blood sample using the GenElute Blood Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma- Aldrich Co), or similar DNA 
extraction kit, in the Pharmaceutics Research Laboratory (Div ision of Pharmacy, Department of 
Pharmacy Research) by [CONTACT_7628].  Isolated DNA will be transferred to pre-labelled, de-identified cryovials and frozen at -80ºC in the Pharmacy Research Laboratory freezer prior to shipment.  DNA samples will be shipped by [CONTACT_881280] (Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, SD) for analysis of over 2,000 
polymorphisms in drug di sposition genes using the  powerful  DMET ™ Plus Array (Affymetrix). 
Preliminary pharmacogenomic data will be a crucial step towards further understanding the disposition of cabozantinib in cancer patients.

MET (c -MET) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2); additional targets include 
RET, AXL, KIT, and TIE-2. Both c- Met and VEGFR2 are important mediators of tumor growth and  
tumor angiogenesis, and in vivo pharmacodynamic activity of cabozantinib against c- Met and VEGFR2 
has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies.

[IP_ADDRESS].3 Deaths  
In cancer subjects treated with single agent cabozantinib, d eath was reported in 10 out of 2410 subjects 
(0.4%) including death related to AEs in 3 (0.1%). Sudden death was seen in 2 patients (0.1%). [ (see 
latest version of the Investigator's Brochure) ]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
Cabozantinib pharmacokinetics as single agent in clinical studies are summarized in [ (see latest version of 
the Investigator's Brochure) ]. 
Population PK analysis of cabozantinib was performed using data collected from 289 cabozantinib- treated 
subjects from XL184- 301, XL184-001, and XL184-201 with solid tumors including MTC following oral 
administration of 140 mg daily doses. The predicted eff ective half -life is approximately 55 hours, V/F is 
approximately 349 L, and CL/F at steady-state is estimated to be 4.4 L/h. The terminal half- life (for 
predicting drug washout) is approximately [ADDRESS_1232014]-dose. Repeat daily dosing of cabozantinib at 140 mg for 19 days 
resulted in 4 - to 5-fold mean cabozantinib accumulation (based on AUC) compared with a single dose 
administration; steady state was achieved by [CONTACT_2006] 15. Cabozantinib is highly protein bound in human 
plasma (≥ 99.7%) ( see latest version of the Investigator Brochure).  
The PK evaluation of cabozantinib in the pediatric population is ongoing. A population PK analysis did 
not identify clinically relevant differences in clearance of cabozantinib between females and males or 
between Whites (89%) and non-Whites (11% [<4% were Asian]). Cabozantinib PK was not affected by 
[CONTACT_654] (20-86 years).  Within a 48-day collection period after a single dose of 14C-cabozantinib in healthy subjects, 
approximately 81% of the total administered radioactivity was recovered with 54% in feces and 27% in urine.  
Results from a PK study of cabozantinib in subjects with renal impairment indicated that the 
ratios of geometric least squares (LS) mean for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and AUCs 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
 
Page 16 of 62 (AUC0 -t and AUC0 -inf) were 19% and 30% higher, respectively, for subjects with mild renal impairment 
compared to subjects with normal renal function. For subjects with moderate renal impairment, both 
Cmax and AUCs appeared to be similar when compared to subjects with normal renal function 
(differences: < 3% and < 7%, respectively). Results from a PK evaluation of cabozantinib in subjects with 
hepatic impairment indicated that exposure (AUC0-inf) of cabozantinib was increased by [CONTACT_2902] 81% and 
63% in subjects  with mild and moderate hepatic impairment, respectively.  
A high-fat meal increased Cmax and AUC values by 41% and 57%, respectively relative to fasted 
conditions in healthy subjects administered a single 140-mg oral cabozantinib dose.  
Cabozantinib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4 ) in vitro. Inhibition of CYP3A4 reduced the 
formation of the cabozantinib N -oxide metabolite by > 80%.  
Cabozantinib is a substrate of CYP3A4 in vitro . Inhibition of CYP3A4 in vitro  reduced the 
formation of the cabozantinib N -oxide metabolite by > 80%. Inhibition of CYP2C9 had a minimal effect 
on cabozantinib metabolite formation (ie, a < 20% reduction). Inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 had no e ffect on cabozantinib metabolite formation. In 
healthy volunteers, cabozantinib AUC was increased 38% with co -administration of the strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor ketoconazole (XL184-007) and decreased 77% with co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 
inducer rifampin (XL184-006). 
  Cabozantinib is a noncompetitive inhibitor of CYP2C8 (Ki
app = 4.6 μM), a mixed- type inhibitor 
of both CYP2C9 (Ki app = 10.4 μM) and CYP2C19 (Ki app = 28.8 μM), and a weak competitive inhibitor of 
CYP3A4 (estimated Ki app = 282 μM) in human liver microsome (HLM) preparations. The IC 50 value was 
10.1 μM for CYP2B6 and IC 50 values were > 20 μM for CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 isozymes. 
Cabozantinib at steady -state plasma concentrations (≥ 100 mg/day daily dosing for a minimum of 21 
days) showed no effect on single- dose rosiglitazone (a CYP2C8 substrate) plasma exposure (Cmax and 
AUC) in subjects with solid tumors (XL184-008). Cabozantinib is an inducer of CYP1A1 mRNA in 
human hepatocyte incubations (ie, 75- 100% of CYP1A1 positive control β -naphthoflavone induction), 
but not of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 mRNA or isozyme- associated 
enzyme activities.  
Administration of the PPI [INVESTIGATOR_881251] -relevant effect on cabozantinib 
plasma PK in healthy volunteers (XL184-018).  Cabozantinib is an inhibitor (IC
50 = 7.0 μM), but not a substrate, of P -glycoprotein (P-gp) transport 
activities in a bi -directional assay system using MDCK-MDR1 cells. Therefore, cabozantinib may have 
the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co -administered substrates of P-gp.  
Cabozantinib was shown to be a substrate of drug transporter MRP2 in an in vitro assay. 
Administration of MRP2 inhibitors to subjects may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations. Therefore, concomitant use of MRP2 inhibitors (eg, cyclosporine, delaviridine, 
efavirenz, emtricitabine) should be approached with caution, and subjects taking MRP2 inhibitors 
should be monitored for AEs. 
 
 
Of interest, There was a differences in PK parameters from the two PopPK analyses ( RCC patients and 
MTC patients) and  appears to be result of higher clearance in MTC subjects, but the reason for this is not 
known ( see latest version of the Investigator Brochure).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Activity  
In phase 3 clinical trial in subjects with progressive MTC (214 on cabozantinib vs. 109 placebo),   the 
estimated median PFS was 11.2 months for cabozantinib versus 4.0 months for placebo (HR 0.28; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.40; p < .001). Prolonged PFS with cabozantinib was observed across all subgroups including 
by [CONTACT_654], prior TKI treatment, and RET mutation sta tus (hereditary or sporadic). The final analysis of the 
secondary endpoint of OS included 218 events (217 were required) and showed a trend for increased

Page 17 of 62 survival in the cabozantinib arm. The estimated median OS for the cabozantinib arm was 26.6 months 
versus 21.1 months for the placebo arm (HR = 0.85; 95% CI 0.64, 1.12; p = 0.2409).  
In phase 3 trial of 119 subjects with advanced castrate resistant prostate carcinoma with bone metastases, 
the enrollment was stopped before the planned study population size of 246; a total of 119 subjects were 
enrolled. The primary analysis for the ITT population (n=119) did not demonstrate an improvement in the 
proportion of subjects with a pain response at Week 6 confirmed at Week 12 the cabozantinib arm compared with the mitoxantrone plus prednisone arm; the proportions of subjects experiencing a 
confirmed pain response were 15% and 17% for the two arms, respectively.  
The secondary endpoints were BSR per IRF and OS. BSR was defined as a ≥ 30% decrease in total bone -
scan lesion area compared with baseline without soft- tissue disease progression. The analysis of BSR per 
IRF at Week [ADDRESS_1232015] 1.1 demonstrated a greater improvement 
in the cabozantinib arm (31%; 95% CI: 20%, 43%) compared with the mitoxantrone plus prednisone arm 
(5%; 95% CI: 0%, 11%). In the analysis of OS that included 78 deaths out of the 196 pre- specified deaths, 
the stratified H R was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.44, 1.10).  
In phase 3 study in renal cell carcinoma, 658 patients were randomized to either everolimus or 
cabozantinib. Median PFS was 7.4 months with cabozantinib and 3.8 months with everolimus with 
median duration of treatment of 7.6 months with cabozantinib and 4.4 months with everolimus. Dose 
reductions were needed in 60% of subjects treated with cabozantinib and the median average daily dose was 44 mg of cabozantinib. The rate of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events not related to 
renal -cell carcinoma was 9% in the cabozantinib group.

1.3 Rationale 
1.3.1 Rationale for the Study , Dose , and Schedule   
Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy with poor prognosis and limited 
response to therapy (1 -3). Recurrence after surgical resection is very common in patients presenting with 
localized disease and systemic therapy is the primary treatment for patients with recurrent or advanced 
disease. The combination of cisplatin/etoposide/doxorubicin/mitotane is the current standard of care for 
metastatic ACC. T his combination has a suboptimal response rate of 23% with median time to 
progression of about 5 months while second line therapy (streptozocin with mitotane) has response rate of 
9% with median time to progression of about 2 months (4).  
In order to understand factors related to chemotherapy resistance and to identify better treatment 
options, we recently studied the role of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor (cMET) in ACC. 
Transcriptomic and immunohistochemical analyses indic ated that increased HGF/cMET expression in 
human ACC samples was positively associated with cancer- related biologic processes, including 
proliferation and angiogenesis, and negatively correlated with apoptosis. Accordingly, treatment of ACC cells with exogenous HGF resulted in increased cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo while short hairpin 
RNA-mediated knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of cMET with cabozantinib suppressed cell 
proliferation and tumor growth (Figure 1) (5). Moreover, exposure of ACC cell line to commonly used 
treatments in ACC (mitotane, cisplatin, or radiation) rapi[INVESTIGATOR_881250]- cMET expression and was 
associated with an enrichment of genes (e.g., CYP450 family) related to therapy resistance, further implicating cMET in the anticancer drug response. Together, these data suggest an important role for 
HGF/cMET signaling in adrenocortical carcinoma growth and resistance to commonly used treatments (5). Targeting cMET, alone or in combination with other drugs, could provide a breakthrough in the management of this aggressive cancer.  
Based on these preclinical data, we have recently used cabozantinib outside clinical trial to treat a 
patient with progressive ACC that failed multiple lines of treatment (Figure 2A). Within 4 weeks of 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
 
Page 18 of 62 cabozantinib use, target lesions stopped growing and slightly reduced in size (one target lesion in left 
upper quadrant reduced from 8.[ADDRESS_1232016] dimension to 6.6 cm)(Figure 2B). This 
patient had grade [ADDRESS_1232017] very good performance status (ECOG 1) while on cabozantinib [ADDRESS_1232018] inhibition leading to tumor 
resistance and growth(6) .  
Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity that targets 
the VEGF, c -MET, and RET receptors. This drug was approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid 
carcinoma and recently approved in renal cell carcinoma (7, 8). Therefore, simultaneous inhibition of cMET  and VEGFRs by [CONTACT_881276] a broad spectrum of antineoplastic activity and its use in 
ACC is appealing based on recently published preclinical data and preliminary human experience.  
We also hypothesize that cabozantinib use has immunomodulatory effect on ACC that can 
include a change in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes profile. The optional biopsies from few patients has 
the potential of furthering our understanding about the effect of cabozantinib on tumor immunity and 
could open the door for combination therapy in the future.  
The study plan is to use cabozantinib with initiation dose is [ADDRESS_1232019] PK levels (obtained on day 1 and day 
29+/- 5 days) analyzed after collection to allow increasing cabozantinib dose to 80 mg a day if AUC for plasma  cabozantinib was <  50% of expected  AUC. Further dose titration in these subjects to 60 mg, 40 
mg and 20 mg will be done based on tolerability and adverse effects. In the remaining study subjects (estimated 12 out of 18 patients), samples will be analyzed a -posteriori after completing study enrollment.

3.2 Dose , Schedule  and Route  
Subjects will receive cabozantinib  orally at  a (starting) dose of [ADDRESS_1232023] follow -up visit ( [ADDRESS_1232024] dose of cabozantinib treatment. ) Subjects will be 
instructed to notify their physician immediately at the onset of any AE. Causality assessment of AEs will 
be determined by [CONTACT_093]. AE severity will be graded by [CONTACT_881283] v.4.0.  
The following should be taken into consideration in decisions regarding dose modifications (reductions or 
interruption): 
• As a general approach all AEs should be managed with supportive care at the earliest signs of toxicity 
considered  related to the study treatment. Should this be ineffective, dose interruptions and/or 
reductions should be considered to prevent worsening of toxicity.  
• Dose modification criteria for cabozantinib are shown in Table 3-3. Dose interruptions and/or 
reductions should be implemented for unacceptable toxicity. Doses may be modified at any time 
while a subject is on treatment.  
• The assigned starting dose for cabozantinib is 60 mg/day. 2 dose reduction levels of cabozantinib are permitted (see Table 3-2).  
• Dose reductions or interruptions may also occur in the setting of lower grade toxicity than defined in 
Table 3-3, if the investigator feels it is in the interest of a subject’s safety and will optimize drug 
tolerability.  
• Interruption of cabozantinib treatment for cabozantinib -related  AEs may occur at any time per 
investigator discretion. If treatment is interrupted due to related AEs for more than [ADDRESS_1232025] may be able to restart therapy with a dose reduction upon resolution of the toxicity per the discretion of the investigator. 
• Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than related AEs (e .g., surgical procedures) can be longer than 
6 weeks per the discretion of the investigator.  
• Considering the possibility mitotane induction of CYP3A4 that can reduce cabozantinib 
levels, subjects who used mitotane within [ADDRESS_1232026] PK levels 
(obtained on day 1 and day 29+/- 5 days) analyzed after collection to allow increasing

Page [ADDRESS_1232028] recovers from his or her toxicities to Grade ≤  1 or to the baseline value (or lower) the 
toxicity was deemed possibly related to study treatment, then study treatment may be restarted at a 
reduced dose (see Table 3-2 for the schedule of dose reductions).  
Subjects receiving a daily dose of 20 mg may be restarted at the same dose if deemed safe at the 
discretion of the investigator. Subjects unable to tolerate a daily dose of 20 mg should discontinue study 
treatment.  
 
Re-escalation to the previous dose, (but not higher than 60 mg/day) may be allowed at the discretion of 
the investigator and agreement of the MD Anderson IND Office  for AEs which have resolved or 
recovered to ≤ Grade 1 (or baseline value) and deemed tolerable and easily managed by [CONTACT_330346]. Dose re -escalation is not allowed for a drug-related dose reduction triggered by

cardiac, hepatic, and renal).  
3.3.[ADDRESS_1232029] frequent adverse events experienced by ≥ 20% of subjects treated with cabozantinib were 
diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, weight decreased, PPES, constipation, hypertension, dysgeusia, dysphonia, and asthenia. 
Adverse events associated with laboratory abnormalities experienced by ≥ 5% of subjects treated with 
cabozantinib include anemia, AST increased, ALT increased, hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thrombocytopenia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, l ipase increased, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) increased, neutropenia, ALP increased, hyponatremia, and leukopenia.  Mild to 
moderate QTc interval prolongation (10- 15ms) has also been observed with a QT interval calculated by 
[CONTACT_182097] (QTcF ) not exceeding [ADDRESS_1232030] been reported ( see latest version of the Investigator Brochure).  
 
Subjects may also experience medically important but less frequent adverse events including arterial and 
venous thrombotic AEs (eg, DVT, pulmonary embolism [PE], transient ischemic attack [TIA], and 
myocardial infarction [MI]), severe hemorrhagic events, proteinuria, wound healing complications, GI 
perforation, abscesses including intra- abdominal and pelvic abscess, GI and non -GI fistulae formation, 
osteonecrosis, and reverse posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome ( RPLS). 
Cabozantinib treatment should be permanently discontinued for the following adverse events: visceral perforation or fistula formation, severe hemorrhage, serious arterial thromboembolic events, nephrotic 
syndrome, malignant hypertension, hypertensive emergency, persistent uncontrolled hypertension despi[INVESTIGATOR_3062], osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), and RPLS.  
Guidelines for the management of AEs (i.e., dose interruptions and dose reductions) are presented in the 
next sections . Each dose reduction of cabozantinib should be to one dose level lower that the current dose.  
Dose reductions of more than one dose level are acceptable per Investigator judgment . All AEs should 
also be managed with supportive care at the earliest signs of toxicity.   Adverse reactions are presumed to 
be attributable to study drug. Adverse events classified as “not related” are defined as AEs that are, 
without question, not associated with the study treatment and definitely attributable to another cause. 
The predicted effective plasma half -life of cabozantinib is [ADDRESS_1232031] an early onset include hypocalcemia, hypokalemia, thrombocytopenia, 
hypertension, PPES, abdominal pain, mucosal inflammation, constipation, diarrhea and vomiting. In addition, earlier onset for events of dehydration was observed in subjects with CRPC when compared 
with subjects with other tumor types.

Page [ADDRESS_1232032] signs of poorly formed or 
loose stool or an increased frequency of bowel movements. Administration of antidiarrheal/antimotility 
agents is recommended at the first sign of diarrhea as initial management. Some subjects may require 
concomitant treatment with more than one antidiarrheal agent. When therapy with antidiarrheal agents 
does not control the diarrhea to tolerable levels, study treatment should be temporarily interrupted or dose 
reduced per Table 3-3. 
In addition, general supportive measures should be implemented including hydration, correction of fluid 
and electrolyte abnormalities, small frequent meals, and stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_151947] -containing products, high fat 
meals, and alcohol.  
Nausea and Vomiting  
Antiemetic agents are recommended as clinically appropriate at the first sign of nausea and vomiting or as 
prophylaxis to prevent emesis, along with supportive care in accordance to clinical practice guidelines. 
The 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists are recommended over chronic use of NK-1 receptor antagonists and 
dexamethasone (NK -1 receptor antagonists can induce or inhibit CYP3A4, and glucocorticoids induce 
CYP3A4 and thus could lower cabozantinib exposure (see Sections 3.4.4). Caution is also recommended 
with the use of nabilone, which is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4. When therapy with antiemetic  agents 
does not control the nausea or vomiting to  tolerable levels, study treatment should be temporarily 
interrupted or dose reduced per Table 3-3.Dehydration may be associated with vomiting and monitoring 
for and correction of fluid and electrolyte disturbances should be implemented. 
Dehydration  
Dehydration events have been identified with comparable incidence and occurring in a shorter time to 
onset in the prostate cancer studies than previously experienced with cabozantinib in other tumor types . 
Extra monitoring/medical management including electrolyte monitoring and/or early dose reduction of 
patients exhibiting dehydration symptoms and those with risk factors for dehydration is indicated. 
Stomatitis and Mucositis  
Preventive measures may include a comprehensive oral examination to identify and treat any potential 
risk for complications before study treatment is initiated. Appropriate correction of local factors should be 
instituted as indicated, such as modification of ill -fitting dentures and appropriate care of gingivitis.  
During treatment with cabozantinib good oral hygiene and standard local treatments such as nontraumatic 
cleansing and oral rinses ( e.g., with a weak solution of salt and baking soda) should be maintained. The 
oral cavity should be rinsed after meals, and dentures should be cleaned and brushed often to remove plaque. Local treatment should be instituted at the earliest onset of symptoms. O btain bacterial/viral 
culture if oral infection is suspected and treat infection as indicated by [CONTACT_13144]. When s tomatitis 
interferes with adequate nutrition and local therapy is not adequately effective, dose reduction or 
temporary withholding of cabozantinib should be considered per Table 3-2 and Table 3-3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hepatobiliary Disorders  
Elevations of ALT, AST, and bilirubin have been observed during treatment with cabozantinib. It is 
recommended that subjects with elevation of ALT, AST, and/or bilirubin have more frequent laboratory 
monitoring of these parameters. If possible, hepatotoxic concomitant medications should be discontinued in subjects who develop increased values of ALT, AST, or bilirubin.  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
 
Page 27 of 62 Subjects on this study may enter with increased ALT/AST serum levels up to 3 ×  ULN. Dose reductions 
of study treatment should be considered in any subject who develops drug- related Grade [ADDRESS_1232033] who develops Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_1232034] study tr eatment held and restarted at a reduced dose (see Table 3-2) after ALT, 
AST, and bilirubin levels resolve to at least Grade  ≤ 1 or baseline. In subjects with recurrence of drug-
related Grade ≥  [ADDRESS_1232035] dose level, study treatment should be 
discontinued. In subjects who develop ALT/AST elevations > 3 × ULN in combination with a bilirubin 
elevation > 2 × ULN without reasonable other explanation, drug -induced liver injury should be suspected 
and cabozantinib treatment interrupted. Reinstitution of study treatment after recovery of ALT, AST, and 
bilirubin to Grade 1 or baseline level is at the discretion of the investigator.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hematological Disorders  
Hematological toxicities ( i.e., neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and associated complications have 
been observed after administration of cabozantinib and may be managed with dose interruptions and/or dose reductions. Use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support for neutrophil recovery is allowed 
per investigator discretion and in accordance with accepted guidelines after the first incidence of 
clinically relevant cytopenia.  
Complete blood counts with differentials and platelets should be performed regularly. Subjects with 
hematologic toxicities may require additional or more frequent laboratory tests according to institutional 
guidelines. Results of such tests are to be forwarded to the local laboratory data management vendor.  
Febrile neutropenia or evidence of infection associated with neutropenia must be assessed immediately and treated appropriately and in a timely manner according to institutional guidelines. 
Dose reductions or dose interruptions for anemia are not mandated but can be applied as clinically 
indicated. Supportive care such as red blood cell transfusions may be managed according to institutional 
guidelines. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Fatigue, Anorexia, and Weight Loss 
Fatigue has been reported during treatment with cabozantinib. Common causes of fatigue such as anemia, 
dec
onditioning, emotional distress (depression and/or anxiety), poor nutrition, sleep disturbance, and 
hypothyroidism should be ruled out and/or these causes treated in accordance to standard of care. Individual non-pharmacological and/or pharmacologic interventions directed to the contributing and 
treatable factors should be given. Note : Chronic use of modafinil should be avoided because of its 
potential to reduce cabozantinib exposure (see latest version of the  Investigator’s ).  Refer to Table 3-[ADDRESS_1232036] of care including nutritional 
support. If fatigue, anorexia, or weight loss cannot be adequately managed, study treatment should be 
temporarily interrupted or dose reduced per Table 3-2 and Table 3-3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Skin Disorders  
Palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome ( PPES; also known as hand- foot syndrome), skin rash 
(including blisters, erythematous rash, macular rash, skin exfoliation, dermatitis acneiform, and papular rash), pruritus, dry skin, erythema, pi[INVESTIGATOR_9491], and alopecia have been reported in cabozantinib-
treated subjects. All subjects on study should be advised on prophylactic skin care. This includes the use of hypoallergenic moisturizing creams, ointment for dry skin, and sunscreen with sun protection factor 
≥ 30, avoidance of exposure of hands and feet to hot water, removal of calluses, protection of pressure -
sensitive areas of hands and feet, and use of thick cotton gloves and socks to prevent injury and to keep

Page 28 of 62 the palms and soles dry. Subjects with skin disorders should be carefully monitored for signs of infection 
(eg, abscess, cellulitis, or impetigo). 
Early signs of hand -foot syndrome could be tingling, numbness, and slight redness or mild 
hyperkeratosis. Early manifestations include painful, symmetrical red and swollen areas on the palms and 
soles. The lateral sides of the fingers or peri -ungual zones may also be affected. Adequate interventions 
are required to prevent worsening of skin symptoms such as blisters, desquamations, ulcerations, or 
necrosis of affected areas. Aggressive management of symptoms is recommended, including early 
dermatology refer ral. Treatment guidelines for PPE related to study treatment are presented in  Table  3-4. 
In the case of study treatment -related skin changes (eg, rash, hand -foot syndrome), the investigator may 
request that additional assessments be conducted with the subject’s consent. These assessments may 
include digital photographs of the skin changes and/or a biopsy of the affected skin and may be repeated 
until the skin changes resolve.  
Table  3-4: Management of Treatment -Emergent Hand-Foot Syndrome  (PPES)  
CTCAE v.4.0 Grade  Action To Be Taken  
Grade 1  Study treatment may be continued at the current dose if PPES is clinically 
insignificant and tolerable. Otherwise, study treatment should be reduced 
to the next lower dose level. Start urea 20% cream twice daily AND 
clobetasol 0.05% cream once daily. Reass ess at least weekly; if PPES 
worsens at any time or does not improve after 2 weeks, proceed to the 
intervention guidelines for Grade  2. 
Grade 2  Study treatment may be continued if PPES is tolerated. Study treatment 
should be dose reduced or interrupted if PPES is intolerable. Continue urea 20% cream twice daily AND clobetasol 0.05% cream once daily and 
add analgesics ( e.g., NSAIDs/gamma -aminobutyric acid agonists) for 
pain control if needed. Reassess at least weekly; if PPES worsens or 
affects self -care, proceed to the intervention guidelines for Grade  3. 
Grade 3  Interrupt study treatment until severity decreases to Grade 1 or 0. 
Continue treatment of skin reaction with clobetasol 0.05% cream twice daily AND analgesics. Resume study drug at a reduced dose if PPES 
recovers to Grade ≤  1. Discontinue subject from study treatment if PPES 
does not improve within 6  weeks.

[IP_ADDRESS] Wound Healing and Surgery  
VEGF R inhibitors can cause wound healing complications and wound dehiscence which may occur even 
long after a wound has been considered healed. Therefore, surgical and traumatic wounds must have completely healed before starting cabozantinib treatment and be monitored for wound dehiscence or 
wound infection while the subject is being treated with cabozantinib. If possible, cabozantinib treatment should be stopped for at least 28 days prior to major surgery.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypertension  
Hypertension is a common class effect of drugs that inhibit VEGF pathways and has been reported among subjects treated with cabozantinib.  
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
 
Page 29 of 62 Treatment guidelines for hypertension deemed related to cabozantinib are presented in Table 3-5. Blood 
pressure should be monitored in a constant position at each visit (either sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_050]). In general, 
subjects with known hypertension should be optimally managed before  study entry. Decisions to decrease 
or hold the dose of study treatment must be based on blood pressure readings taken by a medical professional and must be confirmed with a second measurement at least [ADDRESS_1232037] 
measurement.  Other than for hypertension requiring immediate therapy, the presence of new or worsened 
hypertension should be confirmed at a second visit before taking therapeutic action. It is recommended 
that this second visit occurs within 1 -2 week s. 
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with hypertensive crises or hypertensive encephalopathy.

Page 30 of 62 [IP_ADDRESS] Thromboembolic Events  
Thromboembolic events are frequent in cancer subjects due to procoagulant changes induced by 
[CONTACT_603874]. DVT and pulmonary embolism have been observed in 
clinical studies with cabozantinib, including fatal events. Subjects who develop a pulmonary 
embolism and/or DVT should have study treatment interrupted until therapeutic anticoagulation 
is established . Treatment with cabozantinib  may be resumed in subjects with pulmonary 
embolism or DVT if it is determined that the event is uncomplicated and that the subject is deriving clinical benefit from cabozantinib treatment and that anticoagulation does not place 
them at a significant risk that outweighs the benefit of resuming treatment per discretion of the 
Investigator and according to individual protocols. Therapeutic doses of LMWH or the direct 
factor Xa oral inhibitors rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or api[INVESTIGATOR_881253]. Other oral anticoagulants including coumarin agents (e.g., warfarin), direct

discontinued. See Section 3.4.4 for additional restrictions on anticoagulation therapy.  
 
Arterial thrombotic events (e.g., TIA, MI) have been observed in studies with cabozantinib . 
Subjects should be evaluated for pre-existing risk factors for arterial thrombotic events such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], hypertension, coronary artery disease, history of tobacco use, 
and cardiac and/or thromboembolic events that occurred pri or to initiation of study treatment. 
Further treatment with cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects who develop an acute MI, cerebral infarction, or any other clinically significant arterial thromboembolic complication.

Proteinuria  
Proteinuria is an anticipated AE with the inhibition of VEGF pathways and has been observed in 
cabozantinib clinical studies, and nephrotic syndrome has been reported with cabozantinib and other inhibitors of VEGF pathways. Management guidelines are provided in Table 3-6.   
Cabozantinib should be  permanently discontinued in subjects who develop nephrotic syndrome 
(proteinuria > 3.5 grams per day in combination with hypoalbuminemia and peripheral edema [hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_881255] ]) or any other relevant renal disease.

The effect of orally administered cabozantinib [ADDRESS_1232041] form morphology or new rhythms were not observed. No 
cabozantinib-treated subjects in this study had a QTcF > 500 ms. 
Unless otherwise specified in certain protocols, only subjects with a baseline QTcF ≤  500 msec are 
eligible for cabozantinib research studies. Cabozantinib should be used with caution in subjects with QT 
prolongation risk, a history of QT interval prolongation, or who are taking antiarrhythmics or drugs

• Check electrolytes, especially magnesium, potassium and calcium; correct abnormalities as clinically indicated 
• Check concomitant medications for any medication that may have contributed to QT prolongation, and if possible, discontinue these medications ( http://www.qtdrugs.org ) 
• Repeat ECG triplicates hourly until the average QTcF is ≤ [ADDRESS_1232044] resolved. Study treatment may be restarted at a reduced dose level if all of the following conditions are met:  
• Symptoms are determined to be unrelated to the QT interval prolongation 
• The QTcF value > 500 ms or increase of > 60 ms above baseline is not confirmed according to protocol procedures 
• Study treatment has been interrupted through a minimum of 1 week following the return of the QTcF to ≤ 500 msec or return to ≤ 60 ms above baseline.

[IP_ADDRESS] Hypophosphatemia  
Hypophosphatemia has been reported during treatment with cabozantinib. Serum phosphorus should be 
monitored frequently while receiving cabozantinib. Other causes of hypophosphatemia should be ruled out and/or these causes treated in accordance to standard of care. Mild to moderate hypophosphatemia 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
 
Page 33 of 62 should be managed by [CONTACT_881288] (diary items, meats, 
beans) and/or oral phosphate supplements in accordance to standard clinical practice guidelines.  
Clinically relevant hypophosphatemia should be managed in accordance to the dose modification 
guidelines as outlined in Table 3-2 and Table 3-3 or as clinically indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Thyroid Function Disorders  
Changes in thyroid function tests (TFTs) and hypothyroidism have been reported with cabozantinib 
therapy and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a result of altered thyroid hormone regulation by 
[CONTACT_622696]. Currently available data are insufficient to determine 
the mechanism of TFT alterations and its clinical relevance. Routine monitoring of thyroid function and assessments for signs and symptoms associated with thyroid dysfunction is recommended before 
initiation and during treatment with cabozantinib. Management of thyroid dysfunction (eg, symptomatic 
hypothyroidism) should follow accepted clinical practice guidelines and dose modification guidelines as 
outlined in Table 3-2 and Table 3-3.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Hemorrhagic Events 
Hemorrhagic events have been reported with cabozantinib. In order to mitigate risk of severe hemorrhage, 
subjects should be evaluated for potential bleeding risk factors before initiating cabozantinib treatment 
and monitored for bleeding events with serial complete blood counts and physical examination while on 
study. Risk factors for hemorrhagic events may include (but may not be limited to) the following: 
• Tumor of the lung with cavitary lesions or tumor lesions which invades or encases major blood 
vessels. The anatomic location and characteristics of tumor as well as the medical history must be 
carefully reviewed in the selection of subjects for treatment with cabozantinib; 
• Recent or concurrent radiation to the thoracic cavity ; 
• Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory GI diseases including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis ; 
• Underlying medical conditions which affect normal hemostasis (e.g., deficiencies in clotting factors and/or platelet function, or thrombocytopenia) ; 
• Concomitant medication with anticoagulants or other drugs which affect normal hemostasis; 
• History of clinically significant hemoptysis. 
The risk of hemorrhage in cabozantinib-treated subjects with brain metastases has not been thoroughly analyzed. Though the incidence of CNS hemorrhage events in a study of subjects with GB was higher 
than observed in general population of subjects with cancer treated with cabozantinib, it is not clear how 
the risk of hemorrhage in GB translates to a risk of hemorrhage for subjects with brain metastases. 
Currently, brain metastases of carcinomas are not contraindications to the use of cabozantinib, but subjects with brain metastases should be monitored with a high index of suspi[INVESTIGATOR_881256] a CNS hemorrhage occur.  
Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious and life- threatening bleeding events or 
recent hemoptysis (≥  5 mL of red blood).

Page 34 of 62 [IP_ADDRESS] GI Perforation/Fistula and Non-GI Fistula Formation 
Gastrointestinal perforation /GI  fistula: Prior to initiation of treatment with cabozantinib, subjects should 
be carefully evaluated for potential risk factors including (but not limited to) the following: 
• Tumors invading GI or respi[INVESTIGATOR_322171] 
• Active peptic ulcer disease, inflammatory bowel disease (eg, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease), 
diverticulitis, cholecystitis or symptomatic cholangitis, or appendicitis  
• History of abdominal fistula, GI perforation, bowel obstruction, or intra- abdominal abscess  
• Ongoing visceral complications from prior radiation therapy  
• Prior GI surgery (particularly when associated with delayed or incomplete healing)  
Complete healing following abdominal surgery and/or resolution of intra- abdominal abscess must be 
confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib.  
After starting cabozantinib, subjects should be monitored for early signs of GI perforation such as 
abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, constipation, and fever especially if known risk factors for developi[INVESTIGATOR_881257].  
Discontinue cabozantinib treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with GI perforation/fistula. 
Non-GI fistula formation :  Complications from radiation therapy has been identified as a possible 
predisposing risk factor for fistula formation in subjects undergoing treatment with cabozantinib. 
Subjects with any clinically relevant ongoing complications from prior radiation therapy (ie, radiation 
es
ophagitis or other inflammation of the viscera) should not be treated with cabozantinib. 
Radiation therapy to the thoracic cavity (including mediastinum) should be avoided within 3  months of 
starting treatment with cabozantinib (excluding local radiation for bone metastases). Fistula should be 
ruled out as appropriate in cases of onset of seve re mucositis or difficulty swallowing after start of 
therapy. Discontinue cabozantinib and initiate appropriate management in subjects who have been 
diagnosed with a non- GI fistula.  
Discontinue cabozantinib treatment in subjects who have been diagnosed with non- GI fistula.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Osteonecrosis of the Jaw  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported in subjects treated with cabozantinib. Additional risk 
factors for ONJ have been identified including the use of bisphosphonates and denosumab, chemotherapy, 
corticosteroids, local radiotherapy, and dental or orofacial surgery procedures .   
Osteonecrosis of the jaw can manifest as jaw pain, osteomyelitis, osteitis, bone erosion, tooth or periodontal infection, toothache, gingival ulceration, or gingival erosion. Persistent pain or slow healing of the mouth or jaw after dental surgery may also be manifestations of ONJ.  
Perform an oral examination prior to initiation of cabozantinib and periodically during cabozantinib therapy. Advise subjects regarding oral hygiene practice and to quickly report symptoms to investigator. Caution should be used in subjects receiving bisphosphonates. 
Invasive dental procedures should be avoided. In cases where dental procedures are unavoidable, 
treatment with cabozantinib should be held for at least 4 weeks prior to the procedure and resumed after 
complete wound healing has occurred. Bone healing may often require a protracted time.

Angioedema should be managed according to standard practice. The subject should be observed until 
symptoms resolve, with particular attention to maintaining an open airway.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders  
Cabozantinib appears to represent minimal risk of adverse musculoskeletal effects based on nonclinical 
GLP -compliant toxicology studies. The development of new or progressive, unexplained musculoskeletal 
symptoms such as pain or weakness should be assessed  for underlying causes.  
Rhabdomyolysis has been reported. Cabozantinib should be discontinued in subjects with serious and life-threatening rhabdomyolysis and interrupted if less severe forms occur when there are no other clear 
causes. Reinitiation of cabozantinib treatment must be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_881289] . Therapy of rhabdomyolysis should include supportive care and standard medical 
intervention. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders  
Dyspnea has been reported in clinical studies with cabozantinib . Symptoms should be managed according 
to locally accepted clinical practice including an assessment for underlying causes. Pulmonary embolism 
should be considered as possible causes for new onset dyspnea given the risk of thrombosis associated 
with inhibiti on of VEGF signaling. Furthermore, fistula formation (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) and pneumonia 
have been reported in subjects treated with cabozantinib and should be considered as clinically indicated 
in subjects presenting with pulmonary symptoms.

anticoagulants should be reassessed on a regular basis. For more information 
regarding the use of anticoagulants, refer to the prescribing information of the 
anticoagulant and accepted clinical practice guidelines.  
3.4.[ADDRESS_1232050] is on study : 
• Any investigational agent or investigational medical device ; 
• Any drug or herbal product used specifically for the treatment of ACC  ; 
• Oral anticoagulation with coumarin agents (e.g., warfarin), direct thrombin inhibitors (e.g., 
dabigatran), direct factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban, platelet inhibitors (e.g., clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745]), and 
chronic use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_881260]- protectio n per local applicable 
guidelines), until 4 weeks after cabozantinib has been permanently discontinued. 
• Any other systemic anticancer treatment (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radionuclides) and 
local anticancer treatment such as surgery, ablation, or embolization.  
The following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_622657], while the subject is on study : 
• Palliative external radiation to bone metastasis for bone pain should not be routinely performed while on study but can be considered as a treatment for non- target lesions at the investigator’s discretion.  
• Erythropoietic stimulating agents (e.g., epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa) should not be used based on a report of increased risk of tumor recurrence  and/or progression associated with erythropoietin; 
• Chronic co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family 
(e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) 
may significantly decrease cabozantinib concentrations and should be avoided if possible . Selection

Page 38 of 62 of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is  
recommended;  
• Caution must be used when discontinuing treatment with a strong CYP3A4 inducer in a subject who 
has been concurrently receiving a stable dose of cabozantinib, because this could significantly 
increase the exposure to cabozantinib;  
• Co-administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (e .g., itraconazole, 
clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib 
concentrations and is not permitted . Grapefruit and Seville oranges may also increase plasma 
concentrations of cabozantinib and should be avoided. Ketoconazole use will be permitted to treat 
Cushing syndrome if clinically unavoidable. Cabozantinib dose needs to be reduced by 20 mg when using ketoconazole. Resuming prior dose level is permitted 2-3 days after discontinuing ketoconazole.  
 
Additional information on potential drug interactions with cabozantinib is provided in Section 3.4.5. 
3.4.5 Potential Drug Interactions 
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) : D ata from a clinical drug interaction study (Study XL184 -008) show that 
clinically relevant steady -state concentrations of cabozantinib appear to have no marked effect on the area 
under the plasma drug concentration time curve ( AUC ) of co- administered rosiglitazone, a CYP2C8 
substrate. Therefore, cabozantinib is not anticipated to markedly inhibit CYP2C8 in the clinic, and by 
[CONTACT_151998], is not anticipated to markedly inhibit other CYP450 isozymes that have lower [I]/Ki values 
compare d with CYP2C8 ( i.e., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP3A4). In vitro data 
indicate that cabozantinib is unlikely to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes, except for possible induction of CYP1A1 at high cabozantinib concentrations (30 μM).  
Cabozantinib is a CYP3A4 substrate and a weak substrate for CYP2C9 (but not a CYP2D6, CYP2C8, 
CY
P2C19, CYP2B6, or CYP1A2 substrate), based on data from in vitro studies. Results from a clinical 
pharmacology study, XL184-006, showed that concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inducer, rifampin, resulted in an approximately 77% reduction in cabozantinib exposure (AUC 
values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Chronic co -administration of 
cabozantinib with strong inducers of the CYP3A4 family (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, 
rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort) may significantly decrease cabozantinib 
concentrations. The chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided. Other drugs that induce 
CYP3A4 should be used with caution because these drugs have the potential to decrease exposure (AUC) 
to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme induction potential is recommended .  
Results from a clinical pharmacology study, XL184-007, showed that concurrent administration of cabozantinib with the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a 38% increase in the 
cabozantinib exposure (AUC values) after a single dose of cabozantinib in healthy volunteers. Co-
administration of cabozantinib with strong inhibitors of the CYP3A4 family (eg, ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, and ritonavir) may increase cabozantinib 
concentrations. Grapefruit and Seville oranges may also increase plasma concentrations of cabozantinib 
and should be avoided. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided and other drugs that inhibit 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
 
Page [ADDRESS_1232051] the potential to increase exposure (AUC) 
to cabozantinib. Selection of alternate concomitant medications with no or minimal CYP3A4 enzyme 
inhibition potential is recommended.  
In addition, cimetidine should be avoided because of its potential to interfere with CYP3A4 mediated 
metabolism of cabozantinib.  
Please refer to the drug interaction tables at the following websites for lists of substrates, inducers, and 
inhibitors of selected CYP450 isozyme pathways: 
Http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx  
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DevelopmentResources/DrugInteractionsLabeli
ng/ucm080499.htm    
Protein Binding:  Cabozantinib is highly bound (≥ 99.7%)  to human plasma proteins. Therefore, highly 
protein bound drugs should be used with caution with cabozantinib because there is a potential 
displacement interaction that could increase free concentrations of cabozantinib and/or a co -administered 
highly protein- bound drug ( and a corresponding increase in pharmacologic effect). 
Other Interactions :  
Food may increase exposure levels of cabozantinib by 57%, fasting recommendations should be followed. Subjects should fast (with the exception of water) for at least [ADDRESS_1232052] and before going to bed, subjects are to take cabozantinib with a full glass of water (minimum of 8 oz or 240 mL) with no more food intake for one 
hour post-dose. 
In vitro data suggest that cabozantinib is unlikely to be a substrate for P-glycoprotein, but it does appear 
to have the potential to inhibit the P -glycoprotein transport activity. Therefore, cabozantinib may have the 
potential to increase plasma concentrations of co- administered substrates of P -glycoprotein.  
Cabozantinib was shown to be a substrate of drug transporter MRP2 in an in vitro assay. Administration 
of MRP2 inhibitors to subjects may result in increases in cabozantinib plasma concentrations.  
Additional details regarding potential drug interactions with cabozantinib can be found in the latest 
version of the investigator brochure .

5.6 Outside Physician Participation During Treatment  
• MDACC Physician communication with the outside physician is required prior to the patient 
returning to the local physician. This will be documented in the patient record. 
• A letter to the local physician outlining the patient's participation in a clinical trial will request local physician agreement to supervise the patient's care.  
• Protocol required evaluations outside MDACC will be documented by [CONTACT_756], fax or e-mail.   Fax and/or e -mail will be dated and signed by [CONTACT_41232], indicating that they 
have reviewed it.  
• Changes in drug dose and/or schedule must be discussed with and approved by [CONTACT_41233], or their representative prior to initiation, and will be documented in the 
patient record. 
• A copy of the informed consent, protocol abstract, treatment schema and evaluation during treatment will be provided to the local physician. 
• Documentation to be provided by [CONTACT_304488], progress notes, reports of protocol required laboratory and diagnostic studies and documentation 
of any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].  
• The home physician will be requested to report to the MDACC physician investigator all life threatening events within 24 hours of documented occurrence. 
• Patients will return to MDACC every [ADDRESS_1232089], regardless of whether or not the event is assessed as related to the s tudy treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product, regardless of whether or not the event is 
assessed as related to the investigational product. Pre- existing medical conditions that worsen during a 
study should be recorded as AEs. Abnormal laboratory values, ECG findings, or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if they meet the criteria described in Section 6.2.1. 
All untoward events that occur after the first protocol intervention  through 30 days after the decision to 
discontinue study treatment (or the date the subject is deemed to be a screen failure) are to be recorded by 
[CONTACT_2727]. This requirement includes AEs from unscheduled as well as scheduled visits.

6.1.2 Serious Adverse Events  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or the sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death 
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience – any adverse experience that places the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at 
immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. It does not include an adverse experience that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_881264] 51 of 62 • A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious 
adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse (21 CFR 312.32).  
 
• Important medical events as defined above, may also be considered serious adverse events. Any important medical event can and 
should be reported as an SAE if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_9476], IND Office.  
• All events occurring during the conduct of a protocol and meeting the definition of a SAE must be reported to the IRB in accordance with the timeframes and procedures outlined in “The University of [LOCATION_007] M. D. Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board 
Policy for Investigators on Reporting Serious Unanticipated Adverse Events for Drugs and Devices”.  Unless stated otherwise i n the 
protocol, all SAEs, expected or unexpected, must be reported to the IND Office, regardless of attribution (within 5 working days of 
knowledge of the event).  
• All life -threatening or fatal events,  that are unexpected, and related to the study drug, must have a written report submitted within 24 
hours  (next working day) of knowledge of the event to the Safety Project Manager in the IND Office.   
• Unless otherwise noted, the electronic SAE application (eSAE) will be utilized for safety reporting to the IND Office and MDACC IRB.  
• Serious adverse events will be captured from the time of the first protocol -specific intervention, until [ADDRESS_1232090] returned to baseline, progression of the event has stabilized, or there has been acceptable resolution of the event. 
• Additionally, any serious adverse events that occur after the [ADDRESS_1232091] be reported 
to the IND Office. This may include the development of a secondary malignancy.  
 
Reporting to FDA:  
• Serious adverse events will be forwarded to FDA by [CONTACT_9533] (Safety Project Manager IND Office) according to 21 CFR 
312.32.  
 
It is the responsibility of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_881265], Good Clinical Practices, the protocol guidelines, the sponsor’s guidelines, and Institutional Review Board policy.
 
 
6.1.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
As soon as an investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the definition of ‘serious,’ this should be 
documented to the extent that information is available.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_881266].  
 
• Investigator shall notify Exelixis within twenty -four (24) hours of making such discovery by 
[CONTACT_17258] a completed SAE report form and any other pertinent SAE information as indicated on 
the SAE reporting form; 
• This report must be submitted by [CONTACT_622705] e- mail: [EMAIL_131]  or 
fax [PHONE_154], even if it is not felt to be drug related; 
• Pregnancy (for a subject or for the partner of a subject), although not itself an SAE, should also 
be
 reported on a pregnancy form and be followed up to determine outcome, including 
spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence o r absence of any birth 
defects or congenital abnormalit ies; 
• SAEs that must be recorded on an SAE Reporting form include the following: 
o all SAEs that occur after first protocol intervention  and through 30 days after the decision 
to discontinue study treatment (or the date the subject is deemed to be a screen failure);  
o any SAEs assessed as related to study treatment or study procedures, even if the SAE occurs more than 30 days after the decision to discontinue study treatment;

6.2.3 Medication Errors/Overdose  
Any study drug administration error or overdose that results in an AE, even if it does not meet the definition of serious, requires reporting within [ADDRESS_1232096] be followed until either resolution of the event or 
determination by [CONTACT_622708]. This follow-up 
guidance also applies to related SAEs that occur > 30 days after the decision to discontinue study 
treatment. The status of all other continuing AEs will be documented as of 30 days after the decision to discontinue study treatment. 
7 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
7.1 Analysis Population 
This is an investigator -initiated, open label, pi[INVESTIGATOR_881268]/metastatic ACC. The primary objective of our study is 4-
month progression- free survival (PFS4) rate in patients with unresectable/metastatic ACC who will 
Proprietary Information of MD Anderson
 
 
Page 53 of 62 receive cabozantinib. The secondary objectives are to determine the safety and toxicity,  overall survival 
(OS) , and to estimate overall response rate (ORR).  
7.1.[ADDRESS_1232097] of all subjects who receive any amount of study treatment. 
7.2 Safety Analysis 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_238798]. All safety analyses will be performed using the safety 
population. 
7.2.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse event terms recorded on the e CRFs in the Prometheus database will be mapped to preferred 
terms using the NCI CTCAE v.4 . Seriousness, severity  grade and relationship to study treatment will be 
assessed by [CONTACT_093]. Severity grade will be defined by [CONTACT_29630] (NCI) 
CTCAE v 4.0. Listings of AEs will be provided.  
7.[ADDRESS_1232098] the likely outcomes.  The maximum number of subjects to be 
recruited for the study is 18.  
 
It is expected for the current trial that the drug will achieve a minimum PFS4 of 20% while the maximum toxicity rate should be below 30%.PFS4 is defined as no disease progression or death within the first 4 
months of the proposed treatment. I f the trial is not terminated early, a posterior 90% credibility interval 
for the primary endpoint PFS4 rate will have a width of 0.271, given 3 patients achieving PFS4 under the assumption of 20% PFS4 rate.  
 
7.4 Safety and Futility Monitoring  
The PFS4 and toxicity rates will be monitored simultaneously using the Bayesian approach of Thall, 
Simon, Estey (10) as extended by [CONTACT_210872] (11) , an effective and flexible method which has been 
successfully applied in hundreds of clinical trials at UT -MD Anderson and other institutions. The prior 
probabilities of PFS4 and toxicity for the experimental regimen are modeled by [CONTACT_525298] (Beta(0.20, 0.80) and Beta (0.25 0.75), respectively). Denoting the probabilities of PFS4 and study drug-
related toxicity rate of the experimental treatment by {p(PFS4,E) , p(TOX,E)}, the following decision criteria will be applied:  
the trial will be stopped early either due to futility if  
Prob{ p(PFS4,E) < 0.20 | data} > 0.90, 
or due to toxicity if  
Prob{ p(TOX,E) > 0.25 | data} > 0.90. 
The above futility and toxicity monitoring rules will be implemented by a cohort size of 3, starting from 
the 6th enrolled patient. Patients will be monitored according to the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_564848]4 or 
study drug- related toxicity specified in Table 7 -1. For example, the patient enrollment will be stopped if 
more than 3 severe toxicities  (Grade 4 ) are observed among the first 6 patients. The patient enrollment 
will continue unless the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_881269]. The corresponding operating characteristics are listed in the Table 7 -2.

first 6 evaluable patients per cohort, complete 4 months  of study treatment, and every 3 evaluable patients 
per cohort, thereafter. On every summary submission, toxicity will be assessed after one month, and 
efficacy after four months of therapy.

If the number of PFS4 required for moving the trial to next stage has not been achieved, 
the patient enrolment will be halted until enough responses observed. Toxicity evaluation will be based on 
the incidence of severity and type of AEs (including physical and laboratory). Data from all subjects who 
receive any study drug will be included in the safety analyses. Subjects who entered the study and did not take any of the study drug and had this confirmed, will not be evaluated for safety.

Page 55 of 62 8 OTHER ANALYSES  
Blood samples for pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics studies will  be collected during study course. 
However, analysis  is planned to occur after data is completely collected , except in the subset of subjects 
who previously used mitotane within 6 months of study participation . This subset’s PK samples will be  
analyzed shortly after collection to guide cabozantinib dosing.  
PK profiles will be obtained on first dose (Day 1) and at steady- state (Day 29 +/ - 5 days) after starting 
study drug. In addition, 1 blood sample will be collected every 12 weeks (+/- 6 weeks ) to measure 
cabozantinib trough levels. If feasible, blood samples will be collected at the time of disease progression 
or significant toxicity (CTACE grade 3 or more).  For determining PK profiles, PK blood samples (10 mL) are to be collected within 15 m inutes prior to dosing of cabozantinib and at the following time points 
following ingestion of the dose: 1 hour (±15 minutes), 2 hours (± 15 minutes), 4 hours (± 15 minutes), and 
8 hours (±15 minutes) post -dose.  Blood samples (~10 ml) for the determination of steady- state trough 
concentrations of cabozantinib will be collected immediately prior to the patient’s first dose of the day.  The time and date of the patient’s prior dose, and time and date of blood sam pling will be clearly 
documented in the patient’s medical chart.  At each collection point, whole blood (10 mL) w ill be 
collected into pre -chilled lavender-top (or similar) collection tubes and immediately placed on wet ice.  
Within 30 minutes of collection, chilled tubes will be centrifuged at 1,500 x g for 15 min at 4ºC.  Plasma 
(supernatant) will be immediately tr ansferred to pre -labelled cryovials and stored at -80ºC until assayed.     
Plasma concentrations of cabozantinib will be measured by a validated liquid chromatography- mass 
spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) assay in a validated laboratory ( World Wide Clinical Trials  [WWCT] , Austin, 
[LOCATION_007] ). 
All PK samples will be split into two ~2.5 mL plasma samples, with only one (primary) 
sample being shipped to WWCT for analysis and the other (backup) retained in  pre-labelled 
cryovials and stored at - 80ºC. All samples that will be analyzed after study completion will be also stored 
at -80ºC until assayed.   
In most study subjects (estimated 12 out of 18 patients), samples will be analyzed a- posteriori after 
completing study enrollment.  In subjects who were on mitotane therapy within 6 months of study participation, PK samples will be analyzed after collectio n to allow PK derived dosing as detailed earlier.   
 
 Analyses of immune markers in tumor and blood samples: These studies will be performed at MDACC in 
collaboration with [CONTACT_881293] who is supervising the Translational Molecular Pathology - 
Immunoprofiling Laboratory (TMP -IL). Patient samples will b e collected to perform immunologic 
analyses. The study will allow for the collection of blood samples to be drawn at the time of routine blood-
draw to assess circulating immune markers. Whole blood, plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs)  and other secreted markers (such as cytokines) will be collected at 3 time points (before  
treatment (during screening), at week 9 day 1 visit (+/ - 5 days)  and at time of disease progression  (+ 5 
days), and processed at the TMP -IL for further downstream analyses.   
Optional biopsies will be used for immune -profiling analysis (core needle biopsies (CNBs). Fresh tissue 
samples will be sent immediately after collection to TMP -IL. Core biopsy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_599019] 21-
18 gauge needle and with condition permitting, up to 5 cores should be collected, including 2 for clinical 
processing and 3 additional passes will be attempted to obtain the research core samples.  Core biopsy will 
be performed only when the desired tissue focus is deemed amenable to safe biopsy and low risk for 
complications.  
Cores 1 and 2: Immediate and overnight fixation in 10% buffered formalin for paraffin embedding, 
usually within 20- 24 hour after fixation. For biopsies performed on Friday, fixation time may 
extend to 48 hours (FFPE samples) Cores 3 -4: Flash freezing in liquid nitrogen.

All ti ssue spec imens collected  will be review ed by [CONTACT_881278]. At least, three  types o f QC  
activiti es for specimens collected  will be perfo rmed: a) his tology/cytology ex amination of the tissues and 
cells to confirm the presence of tumor cells, as well as their abunda nce (tumo r cellularity); b) tissue 
quality assessme nt of fresh specimens for ext raction of DNA, RNA an d prote ins, and to prepare histology 
specimens such as whole sections for i mmu nohis tochemi stry a nd immu nofluo rescence; and, c) qua lity 
assessment of DNA, RNA and prote in extr acted. Al l histology s tained samples wil l be scanne d and digi tal 
imag es will be a vailable f or review. 
Using immun ohistochemi stry (IHC) and multiplex immu nofluo rescence (IF) approach that is available 
in the TMP -IL (Drs. Wistuba  and Jaime Rodriguez Canales), we will quantitatively assess multiple immune 
markers. Fresh frozen tissues will be also used for analysis of immune markers. IHC and IF will be 
performed using autostainers. All antibodies used will be optimized for IHC/IF by [CONTACT_599060], including Western blotting. All pathology slides will be scanned into a digital image scanner and analyzed using image analysis software; 
IHC analysis will be p erformed using the Aperio Image Toolbox™ (Leica Biosystems) and IF analysis 
using the Vectra Inform ™ (Perkin -Elmer) software.  Nucleic acids ( DNA and RNA) and prote in ex traction: 
Blood (plasma  and PMBC s) and  tumor (CNB) samp les will be su bjected to extr action using s tandard 
meth ods. DNA and RNA quanti ty and i ntegr ity will be ass essed using NanoDr op 1000 
spectrophotometer (Nanodrop technologi es) and Pi[CONTACT_3252]-gree n analyses.  Also, protein lysate will be 
extracted  using standa rd metho ds. 
High order flow cytometry panels will focus on 1) delineation of major immune cell types (T cells, B cells, 
NK cells, DC), 2) determination of T cell differentiation status and limited functionality (IFN γ, TNFα, GB) 
and 3) defining the expression level of costimulatory and coinhibitory molecules on T cells and their respective receptors such as PD -L1 on infiltrating myeloid cells or tumor. Briefly, 50 cc of heparinized 
peripheral blood from cancer patients prior  to the initiation of treatment, during treatment, and at time  of 
progression will be processed fresh (within 24h of being drawn) for PBMC isolation by [CONTACT_588213]. PBMCs will 
be cryopreserved and stored in Liquid Nitrogen until use. Flow cytometric analysis will be conducted 
retrospectively on cryopreserved PBMCs. When appr opriate, c ells will be thawed and stained immediately. 
All time points belonging to a patient will be stained and acquired at the same time to avoid any technical 
variation (sample at time of progression will be omitted for responders if analysis needs to be completed 
when patient is still responding). We expect that half of the study participants will agree to have the optional biopsies and we anticipate to collect blood samples from all participants.  
 
In another exploratory objective, we will attempt to assess the role of genetic variants of drug disposition 
genes on the PK of cabozantinib.  For the past decades, pharmacogenomic association studies have 
revealed a significant influence of genetic varian ts on the disposition of various drugs prescribed in the 
cancer care setting (e.g. tacrolimus, irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil and 6- MP).  This continues to be an 
increasingly popular area of pharmacological research.  Cabozantinib is a substrate for both cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and the drug transporter MRP2, and maybe a substrate for other obscure drug 
metabolizing enzymes and transporters.  Hypothetically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 
these genes may affect cabozantinib PK.  However, there is a dearth of data regarding these potential genetic associations.  To preliminary assess for potential associations, a single blood sample (~ 10 ml) 
will be collected at the patient’s first clinic visit for exploratory pharmacogenomic testing.  Whole blood  
will be collected into pre -labelled lavender -top collection tubes.  Genomic DNA will be isolated from 
each blood sample using the GenElute Blood Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma- Aldrich Co), or similar DNA

Pharmacy Research) by [CONTACT_7628].  Isolated DNA will be transferred to pre-labelled, de-
identified cryovials and frozen at -80ºC in the Pharmacy Research Laboratory freezer prior to shipment.  
DNA samples will be shipped by [CONTACT_881280] (Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, SD) for analysis of over 2,000 
polymorphisms in drug di sposition genes using the powerful DMET™ Plus Array (Affymetrix). 
Preliminary pharmacogenomic data will be a crucial step towards further understanding the disposition of 
cabozantinib in cancer patients.

11.[ADDRESS_1232104] be submitted to the IRB/EC for information and approval in accordance with local requirements and to regulatory agencies if required. Approval must be obtained before any 
changes can be implemented, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study 
subjects or those that involve only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (eg, change in monitor or change of telephone number). 
13 CONDITIONS FOR TERMINATING THE STUDY 
Exelixis reserves the right to terminate the study, and investigators reserve the right to terminate their 
participation in the study, at any time. Should this be necessary, Exelixis and the investigator will arrange the procedures on an individual study basis after review and consultation. In terminating the study, 
Exelixis and the investigator will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subjects’ interests.  
14 STUDY DOCUMENTATION AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
14.1 Investigator’s Files and Retention of Documents  
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be 
fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified 
into two separate categories as follows: (1)  the inv estigator’s study file , and (2)  subjects’ clinical source 
documents. 
The investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments, CRFs, query forms, 
IRB/EC and governmental approvals with correspondence, sample informed consent, drug records, staff 
curriculum vitae and authorization forms, and other appr opriate documents and correspondence. 
Subjects’ clinical source documents include the subjects’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/ clinic records; physicians ’ and nurses’ 
notes; the appointment book; original laboratory, ECG, X-ray, pathology and special assessment reports; signed informed consent forms; consultant letters; and subject screening and enrollment logs.  
The investigator must keep these two categories of documents on file for at least the latest of [ADDRESS_1232105] confidentiality is protected. 
14.3 Audits and Inspections  
The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made available, after 
appropriate notification, to qualified personnel from the Exelixis Quality Assurance Unit (or designee) or 
to health authority inspectors. The verificat ion of the CRF data must be by [CONTACT_477912]. 
14.4 Case Report Forms  
For enrolled subjects, all and only data from the procedures and assessments specified in this protocol and 
required by [CONTACT_622709]. Data from some procedures required by 
[CONTACT_760], such as physical examinations and laboratory results, will be recorded only on the source 
documents and will not be transcribed to CRFs. Additional procedures and assessments may be 
performed as part of the investigator’s institution or medical practice standard of care  and may not be 
required for CRF entry .  
For each subject enrolled, the CRF (paper or electronic) must be completed and signed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_881271].  
All paper forms should be typed or filled out using indelible ink and must be legible. Errors should be 
crossed out but not obliterated, the correction inserted, and the change initialed and dated by [CONTACT_716155].  
The investigator should ensure the accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data in the 
CRF s and in all required reports. 
15 MONITORING THE STUDY  
It will be the monitor’s responsibility to inspect the CRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to 
verify both adherence to the protocol and the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being entered on them. The monitor should have access to laboratory test reports and other subject records 
needed to verify the entries on the CRF. The investigator (or designee) must agree to cooperate with the 
monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits are resolved. 
[ADDRESS_1232106] assure that subjects’ anonymity will be maintained and that their identities 
are protected from unauthorized parties. On CRFs or other documents, subjects should be identified by [CONTACT_622711]. The investigator should keep a subject enrollment log showing codes and names. The investigator should maintain documents not for submission to Exelixis or designees ( e.g., subjects’ written consent forms) in strict confidence.

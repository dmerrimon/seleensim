Study Objectives:  
The primary objective of this study is to:  
• Compare the differences in percent change in urinary total 4- (methylnitrosamino) -1-(3-pyridyl) -1-
butanol (NNAL ) from Baseline  to End of Study between adult smokers randomly assigned to Test 
Group ( ad libitum  VBM -FG2 use) and Control Group (no VBM -FG2) .  
 
The secondary objectives of this study are to:  
• Compare the difference in biomarkers of exposure (BOE ; urinary total NNAL, 
nicotine metabolites , S-phenylmercapturic acid [ S-PMA ], blood carboxyhemoglobin [ COHb ] and 
exhaled carbon monoxide [ CO]) and cigarettes per day ( CPD ) between two  methods for 
determining CPD during the  Baseline  Period : 
o Recall of average daily CPD for prior week using Past 7 Day Cigarettes Use 
Questionnaire ( Day 1 ). 
o Daily CPD tracking using an interactive voice response system ( IVRS ; 7 day average of 
values recorded on Days 2 through 8).  
• Compare the differences in percent change in urinary nicotine equivalent [ NE], S-PMA, blood 
COHb, exhaled CO, and CPD from Baseline to End of Study between adult smokers randomly 
assigned to Test Group ( ad libitum  VBM -FG2 use) and Control Group (no VBM -FG2) .  
• Compare the changes in all BOE and CPD from Baseline to End of Study between Test Group and 
Control Group over 4 weeks . 
• Characterize subgroups based on change in CPD from Baseline to  End of Study  (no change, <50% 
reduction, ≥50% reduction, 100% reduction, increase) within each study group . 
• Characterize subgroups based on change in total NNAL from Baseline to the End of Study ( no 
change, reduction, increase) in each study group . 
• Compare changes in the Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence from Baseline ( Day 8) to End 
of Study within and between each  study group . 
• Compare changes on the Quit Attempts and Quitting Intentions  from Baseline ( Day 1) to End of 
Study within and between each  study group . 
  
The Baseline Period is from Day 1 to Day 8.  Statistically, “Baseline” will be defined as a single time point 
at the end of the Baseline Peri od (except where noted) .  The last study visit will be defined as End of Study.

Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the data during the Baseline Period  and over time.  All  
summaries of categorical data will present frequency counts and proportions.  All summaries of continuous data will present the number of non -missing values, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum , 
maximum, coefficient of variation , and 95% confidence interval.   
 
Primary outcome measure analyses
 
A linear mixed model for repeated measures analysis of variance will be used for the analyses of the 
primary outcome measure.  The terms of the model will be outlined in the statistical analysis plan.  SAS 
procedure Proc Mixed will be used for the statistical computing.  
 Secondary outcome measure analyses
 
A linear mixed model for repeated measures analysis of variance will be used for the analyses of the secondary outcome measures.  The model will include terms for study group (or tracking method for 
cigarette consumption), study visit and subject.  SAS procedure Proc Mixed will be used for the statistical 
computing.  
 For correlations, a linear regression analysis will be conducted to  examine the relationships between levels 
of biomarkers (dependent variable) with either the weekly cigarette counts (independent variable) or the daily cigarette counts.   The coefficients of determination will be compared.  
 The Mantel -Haenszel Chi -Square Test will be used to test the frequency differences of product use 
categories between the 2 groups.  
 
Interim Analysis: 
 
An interim data analysis will be conducted after the first 50 (approximately [ADDRESS_1028088] Group and 20 Control 
Group) subjects have completed the study.   The purpose of the analysis is to obtain timely information for

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background  
The harm caused by [CONTACT_750868].  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_750854], millions of adults are likely to continue smoking.  Discouraging initiation and promoting cessation are and should remain core strategies to reduce tobacco -related harm; however, it is unlikely that they will eliminate tobacco use 
altogether.  Transitioning adult smokers from cigarettes to demonstrably less hazardous non-combustible tobacco products could positively impact smoking cessation (number of years smoked) and number of cigarettes per day (CPD) .   
Altria Client Services (ALCS) is committed to the development of less harmful tobacco 
product alternatives for adult cigarette smokers.   There is overwhelming scientific 
evidence regarding  a risk  continuum in the range of tobacco products currently available 
on the market.  According to this body of evidence, cigarettes are the most risky  tobacco 
product and smokeless tobacco products present relatively lower risks
1.  Making 
available lower  risk tobacco products for those adult smokers that do not quit smoking, 
can complement strategies that have been proven to reduce harm from cigarette smoking (i.e., smoking cessation and discouraging initiation). 
1.1.[ADDRESS_1028090]; VBM-FG2.  VBM -FG2 
discs are oral, non-dissolvable products containing tobacco- derived nicotine that may 
provide an opportunity for adult cigarette smokers to move down the continuum of risk.  VBM -FG2 discs are a tobacco-derived nicotine product designed to appeal to adult 
cigarette smokers who are interested in tobacco product alternatives to cigarettes. VBM -FG2 discs are designed to be spit- free and chewable.  
The product consists of a polymer matrix, which is embedded with a cellulose fiber that meets or exceeds the monograph requirements for Powered Cellulose as published in the Food Chemicals Codex, 4
th Edition.  The matrix also contains flavors that are generally 
recognized as safe.  
The polymer being used meets the requirements of the FDA -modified ISO [ZIP_CODE], Part 1 
“Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices” tests for materials in contact [CONTACT_750869] a contact [CONTACT_31398] 30 days or less.   The nicotine is pharmaceutical grade, 
derived from tobacco obtained from a facility that operates under FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice regulations for pharmaceutical active ingredients.   The level of 
nicotine in a VBM-FG2 disc is approximately 1.5 mg .  The amount of nicotine in a 
VBM -FG2 disc is lower than the range of nicotine typi[INVESTIGATOR_750855].
  
1.1.2 Previous human studies 
A previous version of VBM- FG2 (VBM -FEXP) has been  sold in a lead market in the 
Commonwealth of Virginia since June, 2012.  This product is very similar to the product 
being tested, it contains 1.5 mg tobacco-derived nicotine and has similar ingredients

except that the VBM -FG2 has a softer texture.   Before introduction of VBM- FEXP to the 
market a pharmacokinetic (PK) study was conducted with 2 prototype products (11 -
SOLID -OOE -45 and 11- SOLID -OOE -46 containing 1 and 2 mg tobacco derived 
nicotine, respectively) in December 2011.  The purpose of this study was to characterize 
the nicotine plasma PK profile from a single use of the prototypes.  This ran domized, 
single -blind, 2-period crossover PK  study ( study number: CEL -SOL -01-11) was 
conducted in 18 (M/ F = 9/9) healthy adult smokers following single use of the 
[ADDRESS_1028092] in the mouth. 
The geometric mean baseline-adjusted maximum observed concentration values for 
nicotine were 1.40 and 2.51 ng/mL for 11- SOLID -OOE -[ADDRESS_1028093] measurable concentration  values for nicotine were 5.69 and 9.73 ng·hr/mL 
for 11 -SOLID -OOE -45 and 11- SOLID -OOE -46, respectively.  Maximum nicotine 
plasma concentrations were reached by [CONTACT_3450] 0.65 hours while mean half- life 
was between 3 and 4 hours, regardless of the dose administered or gender. 
Six (33%) subjects experienced a total of 11 mild adverse events (AEs) over the course of 
the study.  The most common AE was throat irritation (4 subjects), followed by [CONTACT_41679] (2 subjects) and nausea ([ADDRESS_1028094]).  Based on the results of this study it was determined 
that single administrations of the V BB-FG2 disc prototypes yielded rate and extent of 
nicotine absorption that were linear and approximately dose proportional for the [ADDRESS_1028095] use behavior.  The products were well tolerated by [CONTACT_750870] 
12-week study (n  = 284).   
Furthermore, ALCS continuously monitors consumer calls to the Consumer Response Center (CRC).  As of June 27, 2013, since the launch of the previous version of 
VBM-FG2, the CRC has received 2 calls considered to be potential AEs.  In one call, the 
consumer reported “Almost swallowed product,” and in the second call the consumer reported breaking a molar tooth while chewing on Verve® discs for the first time.  Overall, based on the information presented, it is anticipated that VBM -FG2 will be well 
tolerated in this study.  
The participants will be made aware of the possible risks associated with the use of the 
product.  VBM -FG2 packages will have the following warning : “This product contains

tobacco -derived nicotine.  Nicotine is addictive.  Nicotine can harm  your baby [CONTACT_750871].  Nicotine can increase your heart rate, blood pressure, and aggravate 
diabetes.  Nicotine can cause dizziness, nausea and stomach pain.” 
1.2 Rationale   
The current study will serve as a pi[INVESTIGATOR_141106] a larger study with a similar design.  The 
purpose of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_750856] (BOE) in 
adult cigarette smokers using VBM -FG2 discs relative to adult smokers who continue 
smoking and do not receive VBM-FG2 discs.  Results of this study will be used to estimate the sample size for a proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_2397].  Results of this study will also be 
used to determine the optimal method by [CONTACT_750872]; daily product use tracking via interactive voice response system (IVRS) or weekly product use recall.   
2 PURPOSE AND STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to 1) estimate the change in BOE  in adult smokers using 
VBM -FG2 versus adult smokers not using VBM-FG2, and 2) determine the appropriate 
CPD reporting method for baseline measurements ( for IVRS Baseline is defined as the 
average CPD  recorded  on Days 2 through 8)   
2.2 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to: 
• Compare the differences in percent change in urinary total 4-(methylnitrosamino) -
1-(3-pyridyl) -1-butanol ( NNAL ) from Baseline to End of Study between adult 
smokers randomly assigned to Test Group ( ad libitum  VBM -FG2 use) and 
Control Group (no VBM- FG2) . 
2.3 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this study are to: 
• Compare the difference in BOE  (urinary total NNAL, nicotine  metabolites , 
S-phenylmercapturic acid [S -PMA], blood carboxyhemoglobin [COHb], and  
exhaled carbon monoxide [ CO]) and CPD between  two methods for determining  
CPD during the B aseline Period : 
o Recall of  average daily  CPD for prior week using Past 7 Day Cigarettes Use 
Questionnaire ( Day 1 ).  
o Daily CPD tracking using  an IVRS ( 7 day average of values recorded on 
Days  2 through 8).

• Compare the differences in percent change in urinary nicotine equivalent ( NE), 
S-PMA, blood COHb, exhaled CO, and CPD from Baseline to End of Study 
between adult smokers randomly assigned to Test Group ( ad libitum  VBM -FG2 
use) and  Control Group (no VBM -FG2) . 
• Compare the changes in all BOE and CPD from Baseline to End of Study 
between Test Group and Control Group over 4 weeks. 
• Characterize subgroups based on change in CPD  from Baseline to  End of Study 
(no change, <50% reduction, ≥50% reduction, 100% reduction, increase) within 
each study group.  
• Characterize subgroups based on change in total NNAL  from Baseline to  End of 
Study (no change, reduction, increase) within each study group. 
• Compare changes in the Fagerström Test for Cigarette Dependence from Baseline 
(Day 8 ) to End of Study within and between each study group 
• Compare changes on the Quit Attempts and Quitting Intentions from Baseline 
(Day 1)  to End of S tudy within and between each study group. 
3 STUDY DESIGN AND EVALUATION 
3.1 Study Design  
This is a randomized, controlled, open- label, parallel group, multi- center, 5 -week pi[INVESTIGATOR_750857] -FG2 relative to adult smokers who are not allowed use of VBM-FG2.  This study 
will be conducted in approximately 150 adult smokers who are considered to be in over 
all good health.  Subjects will be randomized (based on gender, daily cigarette consumption [<20 and ≥20], and quit attempts [any quit attempts/no quit attempts]) to Test (allowe d VBM -FG2 use ) or Control (not allo wed VBM -FG2 use) treatment in a 
3:2 ratio  ([ADDRESS_1028098]:  60 subjects randomized to Control ) with no 
more than  a 60:40 distribution of either males or females to either group.

approximately 5 weeks (potentially 9 weeks  from Screening to End of Study).  All 
subjects will be informed that they are allowed to smoke their own cigarettes or to quit 
smoking during the study.   
3.1.2 Screening  
Screening (Visit 1) will occur within 28 days of Day 1 (Day -28 to Day -1).  An Informed 
Consent Form (ICF) must be signed prior to conducting any study related procedures.  
Potential subjects will undergo an initial evaluation (vital signs, urine pregnancy test [females only] , and questionnaires) to determine initia l eligibility.   
If the Subject passes  the initial evaluation, then he/she will be provided with a sample of 
VBM -FG2 and asked to use the product as they like for [ADDRESS_1028102] Questionnaire.  If they indicate that they 
“definitely  would buy” or “probably would buy” the product on the questionnaire, then 
the subject will undergo the rest of the screening procedures (clinical labs, 
electrocardiogram [ ECG ]).  Laboratory values will be evaluated by a local laboratory.
 
Additional details related to Screening  are located in Section 6 (Study Procedures and 
Observations). 
3.1.3 Baseline Period 
Subjec ts will r eturn to the study site on the evening (between approximately 16:00 and 
19:00) of Day 1 for Visit 2.  A physical examination will be conducted and subjects who

Protocol No: COV -VER -01-13  Issue Date: [ADDRESS_1028103] is enrolled in the study (Day 1), if they choose to no longer participate, 
they will be considered a drop- out/early termination subject.  
During the Baseline Period, at  Visits 2 and 3 (Days 1 and 8), blood and urine samples 
will be collected  for analysis of BOE.  Subjects will also complete the Past 7  Day 
Cigarettes Use Question naire (Appendix 5) while at the study  site, to indicate their CPD  
over the previous week.   
During the Baseline Period (Days 1 to 8) subjects will report CPD daily through an IVRS 
conducted each day  between 16:00 and 19:00.   
At Visit 3, approximately [ADDRESS_1028104] or Control Group in a 3:2 ratio (with not more than a 60:40 distribution of either males or females to either group).  VBM -FG2 will be dispensed to subjects randomized to the Test Group for 
ad libitum  use beginning after the Day 8 IVRS. 
Additional details related to these visits are located in Section 6 (Study Procedures and 
Observations). 
3.1.[ADDRESS_1028105] Use Period will begin  following the Day 8 ± 1 IVRS  and will continue 
through Day 36 ± 1.  Subjects in the T est group will be provided VBM -FG2 for 
ad libitum  use.  Subjects in both T est and Control Groups will continue daily tobacco use

5.1 Ethics 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Protocol, Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP ) based on the current International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines 
for GCP, and the corresponding sections of the [LOCATION_002] Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) governing the Protection of Human Subjects (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and the Basic Principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.   
The study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol.  No deviation (s) from the 
protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the IRB except 
where it may be necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research subject.  In such case, the deviation (if applicable to IRB policies) will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible.  The protocol, any amendments, and the subject ICF will receive IRB 
approval prior to initiation of the study. 
5.2 Randomization and Administration  
5.2.1  Study Group Assignment (Randomization) 
Each site will be assigned a unique two-digit (e.g. 01, 02, etc.) site number. At each site, each  subject will be assigned a unique sequential enrollment number 
consisting of “E” + a sequential number beginning with 001 (e.g. E001, E002, E003, E004) at enrollment on Day 1.  This enrollment number in combination with the site number will remain with the subject until they are randomized on Day 8. 
On Day 8 subjects will be randomized (based on gender, daily cigarette consumption 
[≤20 and >20], and quit attempts [any quit attempt/ no quit attempts])  to either the Test  or 
Control Group in a 3:2 ratio (not more than 60:40 distribution of either male or female), according to a randomization schedule.  Each subject will be assigned a randomization number based on this randomization schedule.  This randomization number will be used 
for identification throughout the study and will not be used for any other subject at the study site.   Further details on the randomization will be available in the Randomization 
Specification Plan prepared by [CONTACT_750876].  
Because this is an open label study, product use assignments will not be blinded.  
5.2.[ADDRESS_1028116] Group will be provided VBM -FG2 discs and told to use them 
ad libitum  throughout the study.   
5.3 Blinding/Unblinding

8 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING IN CLINICAL TRIALS 
8.1 Adverse Ev ents 
The following is the definition for an AE : 
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding
a), symptom, or diseaseb temporally associated with the use of a study 
product, whether or not  related to the study product.2,[ADDRESS_1028153] be recorded in the CRF, including the date and time of onset and outcome of each event.  Events captured between Screening  (Visit 1)  and Visit [ADDRESS_1028154] usage will be documented as baseline signs and symptoms and not AEs, unless “likely” or “definitely” associated with product trial use in Screening Part 1. 
Surgical procedures themselves are not AEs; they are therapeutic measures for conditions 
that require surgery.  The condition for which the surgery is required may be an AE.  Planned surgery permitted by [CONTACT_49894](s) leading to this surgery are not AEs. 
No causal relationship with the study products or with the clinical study itself is implied 
by [CONTACT_3794] “adverse event.”  
The Investigator will review each event and rate each reported sign or symptom on a 
3-point severity scale.  The following definitions for rating severity
2 will be used: 
Mild : The AE is easily tolerated and does not interfere with daily 
activity.  
Moderate : The AE interferes with daily activity, but the subject is still 
able to function. 
Severe : The AE is incapacitating and requires medical intervention.  
Note: This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on the outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to life or functioning.

Protocol No: COV -VER -01-13  Issue Date: [ADDRESS_1028155] 
(causality) using the following grades of certainty4,5 (the strength of a causal association 
may be revised as more information becomes available):  
Not related :   
Clearly and definitely due to extraneous cause ( e.g., disease, environment) 
Unlikely :   
a. Does not follow a probable temporal (i.e., time) sequence from use of 
study product. 
b. Does not follow a known pattern of response to the study product. 
c. Could plausibly have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state/underlying disease or other drugs or chemicals the subject received.  
d. Does not reappear or worsen when the study product is re- administered.  
Possible :  
a. Follows a reasonable temporal (i.e., time) sequence from use of study 
product 
b. Follows a known pattern of response to the study product. 
c. Could also have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state/concurrent 
disease or other drugs or chemicals the subject received.  
Likely :   
a. Follows a reasonable temporal ( i.e., time) sequence from use of study 
product. 
b. Follows a known pattern of response to the study product. 
c. Could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state/concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.  
d. Follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge), i.e., disappears or decreases when the study product is stopped or 
reduced.  
e. Rechallenge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  
Definitely :  
a. Follows a reasonable temporal (i.e., time) sequence from use of study 
product. 
b. Follows a known pattern of response to the study product. 
c.  Cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state/concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals.

Protocol No: COV -VER -01-13  Issue Date: [ADDRESS_1028156] 2013  
 
d. Follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge), 
i.e., disappears or decreases when the study product is stopped or reduced.  
e. Recurs with re -exposure to study product (rechallenge).  NOTE: 
Re-exposure of the subject is NOT required, but the “certainly/definitely 
related” category may only be used when recurrence is observed.  
8.2 Serious Adverse Events  
The following is the definition for  a serious adverse event (SAE):  
An SAE is any adverse study experience that results in any of the following outcomes:   
• death  
• a life -threatening adverse study experiencea 
• in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant disability/incapacityb  
• a congenital anomaly/birth defect.3 
a “Life -threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of 
the SAE; it does not refer to a SAE that hypothetically might  have caused death if it 
were more severe. 
b “Persistent or significant disability/incapacity” means that there is a substantial 
disruption of a person’s ability to carry out normal life functions.  
Important medical events that may or may not result in dea th, be life-threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse study experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the out comes listed in this definition.  
An example is allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home. 
All SAEs, whether or not considered study-related, must be reported by [CONTACT_750886] 24 hours of the site’s learning of the SAE or, at the latest, on the following workday.  The Sponsor’s representative to contact [CONTACT_461980]:

The Investigator must also inform the IRB, in compliance with GCP reporting guidelines, and the site monitor of an SAE, whether or not considered study- related.  The initial 
report must be as complete as possible, including an assessment of the causal relationship between the event and the study product.  Information not available at the time of the

initial report (e.g., end date, laboratory values) must be documented on a f ollow -up SAE 
form.  
8.3 Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Event Follow-Up  
Each AE including clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, whether serious or 
non-serious, will be followed to a final outcome regardless of whether the subject is still 
participating  in the study.  Final outcome may be classified as resolved, improved, 
unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown (lost to follow-up).  Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document the outcome of the AE.

(Days 1 and 8 ) versus daily tracking (average of recordings on Days 2 through 8). 
• Differences in the percent change from Baseline to End of Study in BOE (urinary 
NE , S-PMA, blood COHb, exhaled CO) and CPD between the Test and Control 
Groups. 
• Differences  from Baseline to End of Study in all BOE and CPD between the Test 
and Control Groups. 
• Proportion of subjects in subgroups based on cigarette consumption change from 
Baseline to  End of Study (no change, <50% reduction, ≥50% reduction, 100% 
reduction, increase) within and between the Test and Control Groups. 
• Proportion of subjects in subgroups based on total NNAL change from Baseline 
to End of Study (no change, reduction, increase ) within each group. 
• Changes from Baseline (Day 8)  to End of Study in Fagerstr öm Test for Cigarette 
Dependence, within and between the Test and Control Groups.  
• Changes from Baseline (Day 1) to End of Study on the Quit Attempts and 
Quitting Intentions, within and between the Test and Control Groups. 
10.2.3  Safety Outcome Measures (Endpoints) 
Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety population.  Safety analyses will include 
summaries and analysis of AEs as well as summaries of vital signs and laboratory test 
results.  
See Section 8 for details of procedures for assessment and reporting of AEs. 
10.3 Data Set Descriptions  
Intent to treat (ITT) population includes every subject who is randomized according to the randomization schedule. 
Per-protocol (PP) population is defined as a subset of the ITT population which is 
comprised of subjects who completed the study without any major protocol violations. 
10.4 Data Set Analyses 
Both the ITT and the PP populations will be used in the statistical analyses.   Gender, average daily cigarette consumption  (≤20 and >20) and quit attempts may affect 
the primary outcome of the study and they will be considered in the randomization.  A 
randomization plan will be developed to balance these factors between the product use groups.  Other factors such as study site, socio-economic status, etc., will be adjusted in statistical analyses.   The details of the plan will be provided in the s tatistical analysis 
plan.

Appendix 1   Investigator Obligations  
Each clinical investigator is responsible for conducting the study in accordance with the protocol, all applicable laws, regulations, and the ICH Consolidated Guideline:  GCP. 
A. Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review/Approval 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to ensure that all aspects of the ethics review are 
conducted in accorda nce with the current Declaration of Helsinki as described in the ICH 
GCP guidelines, and/or in accordance with local laws, whichever provides the greatest level of protection for the study subjects.  The protocol and any information supplied to the subject  to obtain informed consent, including written informed consent forms (ICF) , 
subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements) and written information (e.g., information leaflets), must be reviewed and approved by a qualified IRB prior to enrolling subjects in the study.  Prior to study initiation, ALCS must receive documentation of the IRB approval, which specifically identifies the study/protocol and a list of the committee members.  
Amendments to the protocol and revisions to the ICF must also be submitted to and, if 
required, approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
At intervals required by [CONTACT_1201], but not less than annually, the I nvestigator must submit 
to the IRB a progress report with a request for re-evaluation and re-approval of the study.  
A copy of the progress report and re-approval of the study must be sent to ALCS. 
When ALCS provides the Investigator with an Expedited Safety Report, the Investigator 
must promptly forward a copy to the IRB according to local regulatory requirements or institution procedures. 
After completion or termination of the study, Investigators should follow any applicable 
institutional policies and procedures for notifying the IRB of the study's completion.  
This submission and approval or acknowledgement should be sent to ALCS for submiss ion in the trial master file.   
As part of the record retention requirements for the study, the I nvestigator must maintain 
documentation of all submission, correspondence, and approvals to and from the IRB. 
B. Informed Consent 
Informed consent must be obtained from each subject prior to entering the study, and must meet the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki as defined by [CONTACT_750897]/or conform to local laws, whichever provides the greatest level of protection.  Each subject must be provided, in an understandable manner, written and verbal information that describes the nature and duration of the study.  Additionally, the subject must be allowed adequate time to consider the potential risks and benefits

associated with his/her participation in the study.  The informed consent must also 
contain language that allows ALCS (or designated representative), regulatory authorities, and the IRB direct access to the subject’s source documents for the purpose of review and copying. 
The consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_1177].  In situations where 
study subjects are not legally competent to provide consent (e.g., a minor or mentally incapacitated subject) written consent must be obtained from an authorized guardian or representation .  The ICF must also be signed and dated by [CONTACT_750898]. 
The Investigator, as part of the study documentation, must retain the signed and dated 
ICF and must provide a copy to each subject or authorized representative. 
C. Data Reporting and Case Report Forms (CRFs) 
Data reflecting the subject’s participation in the study and experiences with the test 
product must be reported by [CONTACT_750899].  These data must be recorded on CRFs or other media approved by [CONTACT_750874].  For rules regarding completion and correction of CRFs, see the CRF instructions that accompany the CRFs.  C ase report form s must be 
signed and dated by [CONTACT_941] I nvestigator and must be submitted in a timely manner to ALCS.  
D. Record Retention  
The Investigator must ensure that all records pertaining to the conduct of the clinical 
study, including signed CRFs, ICFs , test product accountability records, source 
documents, and other study documentation are adequately stored for the required time period to allow for retrieve and reconstruction of the study.  This documentation must be retained for the most conservative time period below: 
• 2 years following approval/authorization of the last marketing application that the 
data was used to support; or 
• 5 years after formal disco ntinuation of the clinical development program; or 
• a record retention period mandated by [CONTACT_91569]/or local laws, regulations, and customs;  
• or as specified by [CONTACT_750874].  
The Investigator must not destroy any records associated with the study without rec eiving 
approval from ALCS.  The Investigator must notify ALCS in the event of accidental loss 
or destruction of any study records.  If the I nvestigator leaves the institution where the 
study was conducted, ALCS must be contact[CONTACT_750900].

and approvals; signed consent forms; and Statement of Investigator forms/Investigator 
Agreements.  
Source documents include all original records or observation, results, and activities necessary to reconstruct and evaluate the study.  Source documents include, but are not limited to, laboratory reports, electrocardiogram tracings, X -ray films, ultrasound 
photographs, subject diaries, subject progress notes, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], appointment books, radiology reports or pharmacy records, and any other records or reports of procedures performed during the study.  Source documents also may include copi[INVESTIGATOR_750864].  
Whenever possible, an original recording of an observation must be retained as the source document.  However, a photocopy of a record is acceptable provided it is legible and is a verified copy of the original document. 
E. Deviation from the protocol 
The Investigator must not deviate from the protocol without prior written approval from 
ALCS and as required, the IRB.  In medical emergencies, the Investigator should use 
medical judgment and remove the subject from immediate  hazard.  A ltria Client Services  
and the IRB must be notified regarding the type of emergency and course of action taken. 
F. Investigational Product Accountability 
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records (including quantities and 
dates) f or clinical supplies received from ALCS, dispensed during the study, and unused 
clinical supplies that were returned or destroyed.  All clinical supplies must be accounted for at the termination of the study and a written explanation must be provided for discrepancies.  All unused clinical supplies must be returned promptly to ALCS or, if authorized in writing by [CONTACT_750874], properly destroyed at the study site (except for retained samples in the case of bioavailability/bioequivalence studies).  
G. Study Monitoring 
Each study will be monitored by [CONTACT_750901] a predetermined monitoring plan.  Monitoring visits provide ALCS with the opportunity to: evaluate the progress of the study; verify the accuracy and completeness of CRFs; assure that all protocol requirements, applicable laws and/or regulations and investigator obligations are being fulfilled; and resolve any inconsistencies in the study records.  The Investigator must allow ALCS’s representatives to periodically review, at mutua lly 
convenient times during the study and after the study has been completed, all CRFs and office, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], laboratory records supporting the participation of each subject in the study.  C ase report forms  and supporting documentation of the study conduct must be 
kept up- to-date and available for each monitoring visit.

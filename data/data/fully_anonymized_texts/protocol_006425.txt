Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  1.0 Introduction    
 
1.1 Renal Cell Carcinoma 
 
 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a non -homogenous collection of histologically distinct 
tumor types broadly classified as clear cell and non -clear cell kidney cancer as recognized 
by [CONTACT_31936]. While clear cell histology forms the bulk (75 -
80%) (Cohen and Mc Govern 2005) of all kidney cancers several distinct non clear cell 
histological subtypes constitute 15- 25% of all renal cell cancers. The approximate 
distribution among histological sub- types of kidney cancer is as follows:  
 Clear cell (75 to 85 percent of tumors)  
 Chromophilic (papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396]) (10 to 15 percent)  
 Chromophobic (5 to 10 percent)   Oncocytic (uncommon)  
 Collecting duct (Bellini's duct) (very rare)  
 The genetic and molecular biology of clear cell renal cancer has been successfully targeted 
with the approval of several new drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) and the mammalian -target of rapamycin (m -TOR) pathways since 2006 (Di 
Lorenzo, Autorino et al. 2009) . These pathways  are  up regulated as a result of mutational 
inactivations in the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene that inhibition of these pathways using pazopanib (LaPlant and Louzon) , sunitinib (Motzer, Hutson et al. 2007) , sorafenib 
(Escudier, Eisen et al. 2007) , everolimus (Motzer, Escudier et al. 2008), bevacizumab with 
interferon (Rini, Halabi et al. 2008) and temsirolimus (Hudes, Carducci et al. 2007) has 
resulted in slowing disease progression and prolonging longevity of life in the metastatic 
setting compared to previous cytokine based approaches for progressive stage IV disease.  
 Most of the above trials however excluded non clear cell histological subtypes, and it 
remains unclear if patients with metastatic non clear cell histology will derive therapeutic 
benefit from the above drugs as well, since the genetic and molecular characteristics of 
non clear cell histology are distinct and the clinical b ehavior of these histological subtypes 
are different from clear cell histology. For example, when initially diagnosed in the 
localized stage, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], chromophobe and oncocytomas have a better prognosis than 
clear cell renal cancer. However, after develo pi[INVESTIGATOR_31886], in general the survival of 
patients with non clear cell RCC becomes universally poor. The exception is collecting duct cancers (including medullary) of the kidney, which are extremely aggressive and 
carry a poor prognosis in any stage of detection.  
 At the molecular and genetic level the characteristics of non  clear cell vary with histology. 
Papi[INVESTIGATOR_31887], the second most common histological subtype is histologically categorized 
into Type I and Type II. Type I (sporadic and hereditary forms ) is associated with 
activating mutations of the methyl -nitroso-nitroguanidine-induced (MET) oncogene on the 
long arm of chromosome 7 (Dharmawardana, Giubellino et al. 2004) . These mutations 
result in ligand independent activation of intracytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains, which constitutively activate hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF)/MET pathway. Additionally in its 
  6 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  hereditary form families with Type I papi[INVESTIGATOR_31888]. Individuals with 
these mutant alleles phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_31889] b ilateral multifocal papi[INVESTIGATOR_31890] I 
RCCs (Sudarshan and Linehan 2006). Papi[INVESTIGATOR_31891] (Hereditary leiomyomatosis with RCC -
HLRCC) due to mutations in the Fumarate Hydratase (FH) gene which inactivate the gene 
leading to generation of a pseudo -hypoxic state characterized by [CONTACT_31937] (HIF) similar to that seen in the VHL pathway in clear cell RCCC, albeit by a different mechanism (Isaacs, Jung et al. 2005).  
 The mechanisms underlying chromophobe histology are lesser understood, although an 
autosomal dominant hereditary cancer syndrome, Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD) syndrome associated with bilateral multifocal chromophobe RCC is the result of loss of folliculin 
protein is thought to interact with cellular activate mitogen protein kinase (cAMP) and m-TOR pathways (Nickerson, Warren et al. 2002) . Apart from this mechanism, other 
mechanisms such as upregulation of cellular proto -oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase (c-
KIT) ha ve also been observed in chromophobe R CC (Yamazaki, Sakamoto et al. 2003). 
1.[ADDRESS_31184] in therapeutic targeting, which resulted in excluding these histologies in 
the pi[INVESTIGATOR_31892]. However, with 
limitations there is some clinical evidence available indicative of efficacy for VEGF 
targeting in non clear cell RCC.  
 The Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Sorafenib Expanded Access Program, a non -
randomized open label program initiated prior to drug approval treated 158 metastatic 
papi[INVESTIGATOR_31893] (Stadler, Figlin et al.) . Stable disease was observed 
in 87 pat ients of 107 evaluable patients for 8 weeks with a partial response observed in an 
additional three patients.  
 In a multi- center, international, non -randomized open label compassionate use trial with 
sunitinib in poor prognosis populations that were excluded from other trials on the basis of brain metastasis, non clear cell histology, poor performance status and increased age, the 
overall survival of patients with non clear cell histology was observed to be improved 
(13.4 months compared to a historical control of 9.4 months) with an overall response rate of 11% for non clear histology (Gore, Szczylik et al. 2009).  
 Other small retrospective series have reported variable efficacy with sunitinib and 
sorafenib (Choueiri, Plantade et al. 2008)  in patients with metastatic non clear hist ology 
with response rates ranging between 5% and 17% while recently a lack of response to sunitinib in 23 patients with metastatic papi[INVESTIGATOR_31894] (Plimack E. et al. 
2010 J Clin Oncol 28: 15s, 2010 (suppl; abstr 4604)) in a small phase II trial with a best response of 1.6 months in 8 patients demonstrating stable disease.  
1.3 Clinical Experience with non VEGF axis inhibition strategies  
 Experience with non-VEGF axis directed drugs in non clear RCC has also been limited. In 
the Global Advanced RCC trial comparing temsirolimus, interferon or both for advanced 
  7 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  RCC, (Hudes, Carducci et al. 2007)  124 subjects (20%) had non clear RCC histology. In 
an exploratory analysis hazard ratios for over all survival among non clear RCC patients 
favored treatment with temsirolimus compared to interferon or observation. A prospective 
phase II trial of ever olimus in advanced papi[INVESTIGATOR_31895]. A new novel oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, foretinib (formerly known as [COMPANY_004] 1363089/XL880) that targets c- MET and VEGFR -[ADDRESS_31185] form (SrinivasinR, et al. J Clin Oncol 27:15s, 2009 
(suppl; abstr 5103)). Of the [ADDRESS_31186] response with 6 patients ≥12  months, 3 patients ≥ 9 months 
and 3 patients  ≥ 6 months. Four of 5 patients with Hereditary Papi[INVESTIGATOR_31896] 
(15-53%) in all measurable tumors while twenty-three patients with sporadic Papil lary 
RCC had shrinkage (2- 58%) in the sum of measurable tumors.  
 Other trials with single agent erlotinib in advanced stage papi[INVESTIGATOR_31887] (Gordon, Hussey 
et al. 2009) or in combination with bevacizumab are currently underway at the National 
Institute of Health.  
  Cytotoxic chemotherapy has so far yielded poor efficacy results in non -clear -cell renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC). A phase II study conducted to assess the efficacy of carboplatin and 
paclitaxel in such patients observed a response rate of 0% with a median survival of 63 
weeks (By[CONTACT_6398], Atkins et al. 2009). In another phase II multi- center trial that tested 
gemcitabine and cisplatin in collecting duct tumors in 23 patients found a response rate of 26% with a progression free survival of 7.1 months (compared to historical controls) and an overall survival of 10.5 months with considerable toxicity (Oudard, Banu et al. 2007). 
 
1.4 Mayo Clinic Nephrectomy database experience with non clear cell renal cell cancer  
 At the Mayo Clinic ([COMPANY_002]ster), (Department of Urology) an active kidney tumor registry 
has been maintained since 1970. The Nephrectomy Registry is currently complete with 
clinical follow up through 2007 and provides a rich source of clinical outcomes based on various histological subtypes. Between 1970 and 2007, 3714 nephrectomies for RCC were 
performed that had a specific RCC histo-path subtype with a breakdown as follows: 
[ADDRESS_31187] RCC 
 
 (Sarcomatoid differentiation can arise in all of these subtypes and is not considered a 
separate subtype according to the AJCC classification)  
  Among the 663 nephrectomies for non- clear cell RCC, 26 were M1 at nephrectomy and 
48 subsequently developed met astases sometime following nephrectomy.  For the 74 cases 
with distant metastases either at nephrectomy or following nephrectomy, the overall 
survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years following distant metastases were 55.2%, 24.9%, and 
16.3%, respectively (Leibovich, Lohse et al.) . Non- clear cell metastatic RCC survival

published by [CONTACT_31938] (Motzer, Bacik et al. 2002) also provides insight into the poor 
prognosis of these histological subtypes. Of the [ADDRESS_31188] and

group of patients. 
  Mayo Clinic ([COMPANY_002]ster) annually averages [ADDRESS_31189] been targeted for anti -tumo r 
therapy.  Numerous growth factors and cytokines are involved in the angiogenic process.  Among these factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has a predominant role 
as a central mediator of tumor -related angiogenesis,
 and its expression has been shown to 
be an adverse prognostic factor for a number of solid tumors [Folkman, 1971; Folkman 
1997; Ferrara, 1997].

GW786034 (pazopanib) is an orally- bioavailable, adenosine triphosphate (ATP)- 
competitive tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor (VEGFR) -1, -2, and -3, platelet- derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)- α and - 
β, and stem cell growth factor receptor (c- Kit) [ Kumar , 2007]. Pazopanib administered as 
oral doses up to 800 mg daily is bei ng developed for the treatment of a variety of cancers 
and is currently approved by [CONTACT_2165] (FDA; New Drug 
Application #022465), European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory 
authorities as a monotherapy treatment for patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) and advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS). GW786034 is hereafter referred to as 
pazopanib in this document. 
 
Nonclinical pharmacology studies conducted in vitro and in vivo have shown that 
pazopanib is a potent and selective orally bioavailable, adenosine triphosphate 
competitive, TKI of VEGFR-1, -2, and - 3; PDGFR - α and - β; and c-Kit. Pazopanib was 
generally efficacious in oral dosing xenograft models and in angiogenesis and neovascularization models using oral and topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] (skin and ocular dosing) administration. 
 
As of 09 September 2015, a total of 53 GlaxoSmithKline ([COMPANY_004])-sponsored studies of pazopanib have been conducted in oncology indications (including 2 studies initiated by

6.0  Registration Procedures  
 
 6.1 To register a patient, access the Mayo  Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) web page and enter 
the registration/randomization application.  The registration/randomization application is 
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Back up and/or system support contact 
[CONTACT_31942] s ite.  If unable to access the Web site, call the MCCC 
Registration Office at ([PHONE_492] between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Central 
Time (Monday through Friday). 
 
The instructions for the registration/randomization application are available on th e MCCC 
web page  and detail the process for completing and 
confirming patient registration.  Prior to initiation of protocol treatment, this process must be compl
eted in its entirety and a MCCC subject ID number must be available as noted in 
the instructions.  It is the responsibility of the individual registering the patient to confirm the process has been successfully completed prior to release of the study agent.  Pa tient 
registration via the registration/randomization application can be confirmed in any of the following ways: 
 
• Conta c
t the MCCC Registration Office   If the patient was fully 
registered, the MCCC Registration Office staff can access the i nformation from 
the centralized database and confirm the registration. 
• Refer to “Instructions for Remote Registration” in section “Finding/Displaying 
Information about A Registered Subject.” 
 
6.[ADDRESS_31215] be on file (no less than annually) at the Registration Office 
.  If the necessary documentation is not submitted in advance of attempting 
patient registration, the registration will not be accepted and the patient may not be enrolled in the protocol until the situation is resolved.  
 When the study has been permanently closed to patient enrollment, submission of annual 
IRB approvals to the Registration Office is no longer necessary.  
 
6.3 Prior to accepting the registration, registration application will verify the following: 
• IRB approval at the registering institution  
• Patient eligibility  
• Existence of a signed consent form 
• Existence of a signed authorization for use and disclosure of protected health 
information  
 
 6.4  At the time of registration, the following will be recorded:  
• Patient has/has not given permission to store and use his/her sample(s) for unspecified future research of renal cancer  at Mayo.  
• Patient has/has not given permission to store and use his/her sample(s) for future

Agent  Dose Level  Route  Day 
Pazopanib  800 mg  PO once daily  
       Cycle length=28 days 
   Protocol treatment consists of four 200mg tablets (800 mg) of pazopanib by [CONTACT_31943] a 
day. 
 
7.[ADDRESS_31218] ration  
    Administration of pazopanib with a high- fat or low-fat meal results in an   
   approximately 2- fold increase in area under the plasma drug concentration curve  
   (AUC) and maximum observed plasma drug concentration (C
max). 
  18 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018   
Pazopanib should be taken orally without food at least one hour before or two 
hours after a meal. The tablets should be swallowed whole and must not be 
crushed or broken. The time of day the tablets are taken should be relatively 
constant.  
 
If a dose is missed, the subject should take the dose as soon as possible, but only if 
there are [ADDRESS_31219] should be monitored for 
approximately 10 to 14 days at each dose level.  If toxicity does not abate during 
this mo nitoring time, the medication may need to be interrupted and/or the dose 
further decreased with continued monitoring for an additional 10- 14 days at each 
dose level, and so on.  
 If the toxicity has abated with reduction of the dose and dose re- escalation is 
considered safe by [CONTACT_093], the dose can then be increased step -wise back 
to the pre-event dose (in 200 mg increments, after monitoring for 10-14 days at 
each dose level to ensure that toxicity did not recur or worsen).  
 If a subject’s treatment has been interrupted for more than [ADDRESS_31220]’s condition in 
order to resume the treatment.

- Liver imaging  
-Consider toxicological blood screen for possible contributing 
chemical/medical entities  
(3) Monitor subject closely for clinical signs and symptoms; record the 
appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis, or 
hypersensitivity, such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever rash or eosinophilia as relevant on the AE report form.  Perform full panel LFTs

 (1) Isolated hyperbilirubinemia (i.e., in the absence of elevated ALT or 
other signs/symptoms of liver injury) does not require dose 
modification.  Pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and OATP1B1, which 
can cause elevation of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin in the absence of liver injury..  
(2)  If bilirubin is >1.[ADDRESS_31242]  in the absence of ALT elevation, 
fractionation of bilirubin elevation should be performed.  If bilirubin is >35% direct (conjugated), further evaluation for underlying cause 
of cholestasis should be performed.  
a.     Full panel LFTs include: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, GGT, and total bilirubin.  Coagulation tests 
should be performed as clinically indicated.  
b.    Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available.  If testing is unavailable and a

)    
 
10.[ADDRESS_31247], identify and grade the severity of the event using the CTCAE v ersion 4.0.  
Next, determine whether the event is expected or unexpected (see Section 10. 2) 
and if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment or procedure (see 
Section 10.3).  With this information, determine whether the event must be 
reported as an expedited report (see Section 10.4 ). Expedited reports are to be 
completed within the timeframes and via the mechanisms specified in Sections 
10.4. All AEs reported via expedited mechanisms must also be reported via the 
routine data reporting m echanisms defined by [CONTACT_760] (see Sections 10. 5 and 
18.0).

  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  • NOTE:  A severe AE, as defined by [CONTACT_15928], is NOT the 
same as serious AE which is defined in the table in Section 10.4.  
 
10.2  Expected vs. Unexpected Events  
 
• The determination of whether an AE is expected is based on agent- specific 
information provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
• Unexpected AEs are those not listed in the agent -specific information 
provided in Section 15.0 of the protocol. 
 
NOTE : “Unexpected adverse experiences” means any adverse experience that is 
neither identified in nature, severity, or frequency of risk in the information 
provided for IRB review nor mentioned in the consent form.  
10.3 Assessment of Attribution  
 
When assessing  whether an adverse event is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure, the following attribution categories are utilized: 
 
Definite - The adverse event is clearly related to the agent(s).  
Probable - The adverse event is likely related to the agent(s).  
Possible - The adverse event may be related to the agent(s). 
Unlikely - The adverse event is doubtfully related to the agent(s).  
Unrelated - The adverse event is clearly NOT related to the agent(s).  
 
Events determined to be possibly, probably or definitely attributed to a medical 
treatment suggest there is evidence to indicate a causal relationship between the drug 
and the adverse event.

10.32  Persistent or Significant Disabilities/Incapacities  
 
Any AE that results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions (formerly referred to as disabilities), congenital abnormities or birth defects, must be reported immediately if they occur at any time following 
treatment with an agent u nder an IND/IDE since they are considered to be a serious AE and 
must be reported to the sponsor as specified in 21 CFR 312.64(b).

10.34  Secondary Malignancy 
 
• A secondary malignancy  is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, 
radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  
 
• All secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an 
agent under an IND/IDE be reported . Three options are available to 
describe the event:  
 
o Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myeloctyic Leukemia [AML])  
 
o Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
 
o Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 
• Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 10.35  Second Malignancy  
 
• A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior 
malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy).  Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting .

proposed by [CONTACT_459] (RECIS T) guidelines 
(version 1.1) Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions 
and the short axis measurements in the case of lymph nodes are used in the RECIST guideline.

11.2 Definitions of Measurable and Non -Measurable Disease  
 
  
  39 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  11.[ADDRESS_31263] diameter can be 
accurately measured as ≥2.[ADDRESS_31264] x- ray, or as ≥1.[ADDRESS_31265] component of a PET/CT, or MRI.  
 
11.[ADDRESS_31266] diameter is ≥ 1.0 
cm in diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules) or imaging.  
In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including 
a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
 
11.213   A malignant lymph node is considere d measurable if its short axis is >1.[ADDRESS_31267] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be 
no greater than 5 mm).   
 
11.22 Non-Measurable Disease  
 
11.221 All oth er lesions (or sites of disease) are considered non- measurable 
disease, including pathological nodes (those with a short axis ≥1.0 to <1.5 
cm).  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, infl ammatory breast disease, and 
abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-
measurable as well.  
 
 Note:  ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
 considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of 
 measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are present 
 in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  In 
 addition, lymph nodes that have a short axis <1.0 cm are considered non-  pathological (i.e., normal) and should not be recorded or followed. 
 11.3 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
 
11.31  Measurement Methods:   
 
• All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (i.e., decimal fractions of centimeters) using a ruler or calipers.  
• The same method of assessment and the same technique must be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -
up. For patients having only lesions measuring at least [ADDRESS_31268]- treatment tumor assessments.   
• Imaging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_31952] a treatment.   
 
11.32 Acceptable Modalities fo r Measurable Disease:  
 
• Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or 
  40 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for 
a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
 
• As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and 
site of disease.  The lesions should be measured on the same pulse sequence.  
Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 
 
• PET-CT:  If the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT 
is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and 
can be used interchangeably  with conventional CT in accurately measuring 
cancer lesions over time.   
 
• Chest X -ray:  Lesions on chest x -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions 
when they are clearly defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT 
scans are preferable.  
 
• FDG -PET:  FDG-PET scanning is allowed to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progressive disease [PD] and particularly possible 'new' disease.  
A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scanned lesion is defined as one which is FDG avid 
with an update greater than twice that of the  surrounding tissue on the 
attenuation corrected image; otherwise, an FDG -PET scanned lesion is 
considered ‘negative.’  New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET imaging can be 
identified according to the following algorithm: 
 
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline with a positive FDG -PET at follow-up is a 
sign of PD based on a new lesion. 
 b. No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:   
 
i. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of 
disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.   
 ii. If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT at the same evaluation, additional follow- up CT scans 
(i.e., additional follow -up scans at least 4 weeks later) are needed to

 iii If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre -existing site 
of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, it is not classified as PD.

Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  11.33 Measurement at Follow -up Evaluation:   
 
• In the case of stable disease (SD), follow -up measurements must have met the 
SD criteria at least once after study entry at a minimum interval of 8 weeks 
(see Section 11. 44). 
 
• The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that 
appears or worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met 
criteria for response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between 
response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) 
and progressive disease.  
 
• Cytologic and histologic techniques can be used to differentiate between PR 
and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell 
tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain.) 
 
11.[ADDRESS_31269]  
 
11.41  Target Lesions & Target Lymph Nodes 
 
• Measurable lesions (as defined in Section 11.21) up to a maximum of 5 lesions, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as “Target Lesions” 
and recorded and measured at baseline.  These lesions can be non-nodal or 
nodal (as defined in 11.21) , where no more than 2 lesions are from the same 
organ and no more than 2 malignant nodal lesions are selected.  
 
Note:  If fewer than 5  target lesions and target lymph nodes are identified (as 
there often will be), there is no reason to perform additional studies beyond those specified in the protocol to discover new lesions.   
 
• Target lesions and target lymph nodes should be selected on the basis of their 
size, be representative of all involved sites of disease, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be 
the case that,  on occasion, the largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) does 
not lend itself to reproducible measurements in which circumstance the next largest lesion (or malignant lymph node) which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.   
 
• Baseline Sum of Dimensions (BSD):  A sum of the longest diameter for all 
target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum of dimensions (BSD).  The BSD 
will be used as reference to further chara cterize any objective tumor response 
in the measurable dimension of the disease.   
 
• Post-Baseline Sum of the Dimensions (PBSD):  A sum of the longest diameter 
for all target lesions plus the sum of the short axis of all the target lymph nodes 
will be calcu lated and reported as the post -baseline sum of dimensions (PBSD).  
If the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure for the target lesion (or 
target lymph node), that should be recorded, even if it is below 0.5 cm.  If the 
target lesion (or target l ymph node) is believed to be present and is faintly seen 
  42 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  but too small to measure, a default value of 0.[ADDRESS_31270] that the target lesion or target lymph node has 
likely disappeared, the measurement sh ould be recorded as 0 cm. 
 
• The minimum sum of the dimensions (MSD) is the minimum of the BSD and the PBSD.  
  
11.42  Non-Target Lesions & Non -Target Lymph Nodes 
 
Non-measurable sites of disease (Section 11.22) are classified as non - target lesions 
or non- target lymph nodes and should also be recorded at baseline.  These lesions 
and lymph nodes should be followed in accord with 11.433. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_31271]/MRI/PET -CT/Chest X -ray/physical examination must be measured on 
re-evaluation at evaluation times specified in Section 11.1.  Specifically, a 
change in objective status to either a PR or CR canno t be done without re -
measuring target lesions and target lymph nodes.  
 
Note: Non-target lesions and non -target lymph nodes should be evaluated 
at each assessment, especially in the case of first response or confirmation of response.  In selected circumstances, certain non- target organs may be 
evaluated less frequently.  For example, bone scans may need to be 
repeated only when complete response is identified in target disease or 
when progression in bone is suspected. 
 
11.432 Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all target lesions.  
 b. Each target lymph node must have 
reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm 
 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in PBSD (sum of 
the longest diameter for all target lesions 
plus the sum of the short axis of all the 
target lymph nodes at current evaluation) 
taking as reference the BSD ( see Section 
11.41). 
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant lesion, 
which also includes any lymph node 
that was normal at baseline (< 1.0 cm 
short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.0 cm 
short axis during follow-up.  
  43 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018   
b. At least a 20% increase in PBSD (sum 
of the longest diameter for all target 
lesions plus the sum of the short axis of 
all the target lymph nodes at current 
evaluation) taking as reference the MSD (Section 11.41).  In addition, the 
PBSD must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 0.5 cm 
from the MSD.  
 
c. See Section 11.32 for details in regards 
to the requirements for PD via FDG -
PET imaging.  
  
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR, nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD taking as reference the MSD.  
 
11.433 Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions & Non-target Lymph Nodes 
 
• Complete Response (CR):  All of the following must be true:  
 
a. Disappearance of all non -target lesions.  
 b. Each non-target lymph node must have 
a reduction in short axis to <1.0 cm. 
 
• Non-CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non- target 
lesions or non-target lymph nodes. 
 
• Progression (PD):  At least one of the following must be true: 
 
a. At least one new malignant  lesion, 
which also inc ludes  any lymph node 
that was normal at ba seline (<  1.0 cm 
short axis) and increased to ≥ 1.0 cm short axis during follow-up.   
 
b. Unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions and non -target 
lymph nodes.  (NOTE:  Unequivocal 
progression should not normally trump 
target lesion and target lymph no de 
status.  It must be representative of 
overall disease status change.)

regards to the requirements for PD via FDG -PET imaging.

  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  15.14 Administration:   The medication is taken orally .  Pazopanib should be 
taken without food, at least [ADDRESS_31283] not be broken or 
crushed.  If a dose is missed, it should not be taken if it is less than 12 
hours until the next dose . 
  
15.15 Pharmacokinetic information : 
a)  Absorption – Pazopanib is absorbed orally with an absolute 
oral bioavailability range of 13.5 to 38.9% after an 800 mg dose, with a median absolute bioavailability of 21%.  Plasma  
concentration s of pazopanib peak from [ADDRESS_31284] one hour befor e or 2 hours after a meal. Administration of 
pazopanib as a crushed tablet increases the rate and extent of oral absorption relative to administration of the whole tablet.  The crushing of the tablet increases AUC by 46% and C
max  by 
[CONTACT_3450] 2-fold, but decreases t max by [CONTACT_3450] 2 hours 
relative to administration of the whole tablet.  Consequently, it is 
recommended not to crush pazopanib tablets. 
b)  Distribution – Binding of pazopanib to human plasma protein in vivo was greater than 99% with n o concentration dependence.  
Pazopanib is associated with a small volume of distribution (9.2 to 131L). 
c)  Metabolism – In vitro studies demonstrate pazopanib is 
metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4 with a minor contribution from CYP1A2 
and CYP2C8.  Patients who have AST/ALT >[ADDRESS_31285] and 
concurrent bilirubin > [ADDRESS_31286] permanently discontinue 
pazopanib.  Use of pazopanib is not recommended in patients with total biblirubin >[ADDRESS_31287] (regardless of any ALT) due to 
insufficient data with this severe impairment.  
d)  Elimination – Pazopanib has a mean half-life of 30.9 hours 
after administration of an 800mg dose.  Elimination is primarily 
via feces with renal elimination accounting for < 4% of the 
administered dose. 
  
15.16 Potential Drug Interactions:  CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers :  
Coadministration of pazopanib with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., 
itraconazole, atazanavir, indinavir,  nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, 
telithromycin, voriconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin) increases pazopanib concentrations and should be avoided.  Grapefruit 
juice should be avoided as it inhibits CYP3A4 activity and may also 
increase plasma concentrations of pazopanib. CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin may decrease plasma pazopanib concentrat ions. Pazopanib 
should not be used if chronic use of strong CYP3A4 inducers cannot be avoided.  Please see Appendix VI for a list of strong inhibitors and 
inducers of CYP3A4. 
  55 MC1152 
  MCCC Addendum 11 
Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018   CYP Substrates:  Results from drug-drug interaction trials conducted in 
cancer p atients suggest that pazopanib is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, 
CYP2C8, and CYP2D6 in vivo, but had no effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
or CYP2C19.   Concomitant use of pazopanib with agents with narrow 
therapeutic windows that are metabolized by [CONTACT_097]3A4, CYP2D6, or 
CYP2C8 is not recommended. Coadministration may result in inhibition of the metabolism of these products and create the potential for serious 
adverse events.  
 Concomitant use of pazopanib and simvastatin increases the 
incidence of ALT elevations.  If a patient receiving concomitant 
simvastatin develops ALT elevations, follow dosing guidelines for pazopanib or consider discontinuing simvastatin.  Insufficient data 
are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of 
alternative statins and pazo panib. 
 If the concomitant use of a PPI [INVESTIGATOR_31917], the dose of 
pazopanib should be taken without food once daily in the evening 
concomitantly with the PPI. If the concomitant administration of an H2 -receptor antagonist is medically necessary, pazopanib 
should be taken without food at least [ADDRESS_31288] 1 hour before or 2 hours after administration of short -acting antacids.  
 
With concomitant use of pazopanib with lapatinib (an inhibitor of 
P-gp, BCRP and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4), patients should be 
observed for adverse reactions and the pazopanib dose should be 
reduced as needed. 
 
In vitro studies also showed that pazopanib inhibits UGT1A1 and OATP1B1 .   Pazopanib may increase concentrations of drugs 
eliminated by  [CONTACT_15924]1A1 and OATP1B1. Coadministration of 
pazopanib 400 mg once daily with cetuximab 250 mg/m2 and irinotecan 150 mg/m2 resulted in a 20% increase in systemic 
exposure to SN -38 (a substrate for UGT1A1 and OATP1B1).

15.18 Drug procurement :  Pazopanib HCl (GW786034)  is an investigational 
agent that will be supplied by [CONTACT_5343] .  See Appendix V for detailed 
drug ordering instructions/form. 
 
15.2 Nursing Guidelines for pazopanib 
 
15.21 Pazopanib should be taken without food (1 hour before or 2 hours after a 
meal). Should be taken whole with water and not broken or crushed. If a 
dose is missed, do not take if it is less than 12 hours until the next dose.  
 
15.22 There are numerous drug to drug interactions between pazopanib and 
other agents metabolized through the P450 system.  Assess patient’s concomitant medications, including OTC and herbal products.  Refer to 
appendix for medications that should be avoided or used concomitantly 
with caution. 
 15.[ADDRESS_31289]. Monitor blood 
pressure closely per stu dy guidelines. Administer antihypertensives as 
ordered by [CONTACT_28839]. 
 
15.24 Inform patient of possible changes in hair color. 
 15.25 Gastrointestinal side effects are common (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, 
loss of appetite). Treat symptomatically and assess for effectiveness.  
 15.26 Due to the similarity in nature of this agent to other VEGF inhibitors 
(bevacizumab, VEGF-trap, etc.) monitor for signs of bleeding, 
thrombosis and PE. Instruct patient to report any calf tenderness, 
shortness of breath, chest pain or ble eding immediately.  
 15.27 Cytopenias are common. Monitor CBC w/diff and instruct patient to 
report any unusual bruising or bleeding and/or signs of infection to study 
team.  
 15.28 Monitor LFT’s. Patients who have AST/ALT levels > 3x ULN and 
concurrent bilirubin >2X ULN should permanently discontinue 
pazopanib. Patients with AST/ALT levels as above and mild hyperbilirubinemia (with suspected or known Gibert’s syndrome) should 
be monitored weekly while continuing pazopanib. 
 15.29 Cardiac side effects (CHF, MI, chest pain, etc).  while rare can be serious 
and life threatening. Instruct patient to report any cardiac symptoms to 
study team immediately.  
 
15.29a RPLS, CVA, and TIA are uncommon, but are life threatening. Instruct 
patient to report any neurological symptoms to the study team immediately.

Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  16.0  Statistical Considerations and Methodology  
 
16.1 Overview:   This protocol will assess the efficacy of pazopanib in patients with 
non-clear cell metastatic renal cancer using a one- stage phase II study design.   
 
 16.11  Primary Endpoint:  T he primary endpoint of this trial is the 12 -month 
overall survival rate.  A “12 -month overall survivor” will be considered 
synonymous with “success”, unless otherwise spec ified. A patient is 
considered to be a 12-month survivor if the patient lives 12 months from 
registration (note, all deaths prior to 12 months, regardless of cause, will 
be considered a failure). All patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be evaluable 
for the primary endpoint. All eligible patients will be followed until 
death or a minimum of 2 years.  
 
16.2  Statistical Design:
  
 
16.21  Decision Rule:  T he largest success proportion where the p roposed 
treatment regimen would be considered ineffective in this population is 55%, and the smallest success proportion that would warrant subsequent 
studies with the proposed regimen in this patient population is 75%. The 
one-stage design based on properties of the binomial distribution uses [ADDRESS_31290] 55%.   
 
16.22  Sample Size:   There will be 35 evaluable patients accrued onto this study 
unless undue toxicity is encountered. We anticipate accruing an 
additional 4 patients to account for ineligibility, cancellation, major 
treatment violation, or other reasons.   
 
16.23  Accrual Time and Study Duration:  T he anticipated accrual rate is 
approximately 1-2 patients  per month, based on the incidence of tumor 
type and the potential to accrue at Mayo Clinic sites (Mayo Clinic 
[COMPANY_002]ster , Mayo Clinic [LOCATION_012] and Mayo Clinic Arizona).  Therefore, 
the accrual period for this phase II study is expected to be [ADDRESS_31291] patient has been observed for 12 months. 
 
16.24  Power and Significance Level:  The null 12-month overall survival rate 
of 55% is based on the Kaplan -Meier estimate of 12 -month survival from 
the M ayo Clinic Nephrectomy database (Leibovich, Lohse et al.) .  
Assuming that the number of successes is binomially distributed and the 
significance level is ≤0.10, we are required to accrue evaluable 35 
patients to achieve an 80% power under the alternative hypothe sis of a 
75% success proportion. 
 
16.3  Analysis Plan:  The analysis for this trial will comme nce at the time all  patients 
have become evaluable for the primary endpoint. Such a decision will be made by [CONTACT_31957], in accord with standard operating procedures, availability o f data for secondary endpoints, and the level of data maturity.

follow-up (eg, progressed/recur red, refusing further study 
participation, etc) prior to the time necessary for the binomial 
endpoint (eg, 12 months) will be defined as failure.  All 
patients meeting the eligibility criteria who have signed a consent form and have begun treatment will be considered 
evaluable for the primary endpoint. All eligible patients will be followed until death or a minimum of 2 years.  
 
16.312  Estimation: The proportion of successes will be estimated by 
[CONTACT_31958]. Confidence intervals for the true success 
proportion will be calculated.   
 
16.313  Over Accrual: If more than the target number of patients are 
accrued, the additional patients will not be used to evaluate the 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_15901]; 
however, they will be included in final point estimates and 
confidence intervals.  
 
16.[ADDRESS_31293] date documentation of disease 
progression or death .  Kaplan -Meier curve will be used to 
estimate progression -free survival time.  
 
16.323 Adverse events: All eligible patients that have initia ted 
treatment will be considered evaluable for assessing adverse event rate(s). The maximum grade for each type of adverse 
event will be recorded for each patient, and fre quency tables 
will be reviewed to determine patterns. Additionally, the relationship of the adverse event(s) to the study treatment will 
be taken into consideration. 
 
16.324 Observation Phase: Retreatment of patients who have relapsed 
will be left to the discretion of the treating physician. 
Statistical analysis of the observational phase data for these 
patients will be of a descriptive nature.

Protocol Version Date:  10Jul2018  16.4 Data & Safety Monitoring:  
 
16.41 The study chair(s) and the study statistician will review the study at least 
twice a year to identify accrual, adverse event, and any endpoint 
problems that might be developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. The Mayo Clinic Cancer Center 
(MCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is responsible for reviewing accrual and safety data for this trial at least twice a year, based 
on reports provided by [CONTACT_31959].  
 
16.42 Advers e Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]: The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31920]. We note that the 
Adverse Event Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_31921] (1) 
the study re-opening to accrual or (2) at any time during the conduct of 
the trial and in consideration of newly acquired information regarding the 
adverse event profile of the treatment(s) under investigation. The study 
team may choose to suspend accrual because of unexpected adverse 
event profiles that have not crossed the specified rule below.  
Accrual will be temporarily suspended to this study if at any time we 
observe events considered at least possibly related to study treatment (i.e. an adverse event with attribute specified as “possible”, “probable”, or 
“definite”) that satisfy the following:  
 If [ADDRESS_31294] 15 treated patients or anytime 
thereafter more than 25% of patients experience a ≥grade 4 or higher adverse event, except for hypertension, diarrhea, and 
abnormal liver functi on tests , accrual will be temporarily 
suspended. 
We note that we will review grade 4 and 5 adverse events deemed 
“unrelated” or “unlikely to be related”, to verify their attribution and to monitor the emergence of a previously unrecognized treatment- related 
adverse event.  
16.5  Results Reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov: At study activation, this study will have 
been registered within the “ClincialTrails.gov” website. The primary and 
secondary endpoints (ie, “Outcome Measures”) along with other required 
information for this study will be reported on ClinicalTrials.gov. For purposes of 
timing of the Results Reporting, the initial estimated completion date for the 
Primary Endpoint of this study is 36 months af ter the study opens to accrual. The 
definition of “Primary Endpoint Completion Date” (PECD) for this study is at the 
time the last patient registered has been followed for at least 12 months overall 
survival  status.

with causing torsades de pointes and/or QT prolongation.  There is insufficient data that these medications alone may cause torsades de pointes and/or QT prolongation, however when pazopanib is given concomitantly with a medication on this list (or other risk factors are present such as bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, congenital long QT syndrome, or concomitant drugs that inhibit metabolism), there may be possible or conditional risk of torsades de pointes 
and/or QT prolongation.  Extreme caution and careful monitoring should be instituted with 
concomitant administration of pazopanib and a medication on this list.

The Stages of Heart Failure – NYHA Classification  
In order to determine the best course of of therapy, physicians often assess the stage of 
heart failure according to the [LOCATION_001] Heart As sociation (NYHA) functional 
classification system. This system relates symptoms to everyday activities and the 
patient's quality of life.  
Class  Patient Symptoms  
Class I (Mild)  No limitation of physical activity. Ordinary physical activity does 
not cause undue fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea (shortness of 
breath).  
Class II (Mild)  Slight limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but 
ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea.  
Class III 
(Moderate)  Marked limitation of physical activity. Comfortable at rest, but less 
than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_332], or dyspnea.  
Class IV (Severe)  Unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort. 
Symptoms of cardiac insufficiency at rest. If any physical activity is 
undertaken, discomfort is increased.

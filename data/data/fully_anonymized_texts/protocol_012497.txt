 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Overview  
Perioperative anxiety in Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) is associated with  increased post -
operative pain and decreased patient satisfaction. Optimum delivery of patient education has been 
suggested as a potential modality to decrease perioperative anxiety, but has not been conclusively  
demonstrated. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_249941] 2017 at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s Westlake Campus  
demonstrated that patient education completed with a 3D printed model and standardized script increased patients subjective understanding and decreased patient anxiety during the perioperative period. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_249942], the pi[INVESTIGATOR_249943] a small sample 
size and lacked an adequate control group. Our aim is to complete a comprehensive randomized 
control trial, with a larger cohort of patients and  an adequate control group, to compare  of our 
innovative counseling protocol to the current standard of care , verbal counseling . This work may 
help to provide an optimized educational delivery system  for MMS at University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].

studies demonstrate that physical models outperform static (2D) or dynamic (3D), animated  or 
digitized,  representations for the delivery of medical education.
12-18 In addition, the use of physical 
models for the delivery of medical education has been shown to decrease learner anxiety.12,19 
 In July 2017, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_249944] a 3D printed MMS model and standardized script protocol could enhance patient understanding of MMS and decrease perioperative patient anxiety.

in anxiety by 1.5 points using  a Visual Analog Scale.
19 Limitations of our initial study included 
lack of an adequate control group and small initial sample size.  
 Our aim is to complete a comprehensive randomized control trial, with a larger cohort of patients

is preferred to written consent to prevent the collection of information classified as protected health information (PHI).  
 5.0 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS  
A total of 100  patients will be recruited from University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_249946], Chagrin Highlands  and 
Westlake Locations. These patients will be randomly assigned to a control (50%) or experimental 
group (50%) prior to the onset of the study protocol . Patients in the control group will be educated 
on MMS according to the current standard of care, verbal counselling, with a standardized script  
(Appendix A). The experimental group will be educated on MMS with a standardized script in addition to a 3D MMS model  (Appendix B) . 
 Patients will initially undergo  verbal  consent in private patient rooms located within the Mohs 
Microsurgery Clinics prior to study initiation. As previously stated, verbal consent will prevent the 
CASE PRMC 6617  3 3/2/2018 
 collection of any PHI during this study. Upon verbal consent, patients will fill out baseline testing 
including a State -Trait Anxiety Inve ntory (STAI) and Visual Analog S cale (VAS)  to quantify 
their anxiety and understanding of the Mohs procedure (Appendices C, D, E). Following baseline testing, patients will undergo preoperative education. In the control group patients will be educated with  a standardized script alone, and experimental group patients with a standardized 
script, in addition to a 3DP physical model demonstrating the M MS procedure. The total length 
of time to educate patients will be recorded.  
 After completion, patients will undergo standard of care procedures with the MMS team, 
including surgeon, and undergo the first stage of the MMS  procedure. Patients will undergo post-
testing following the first layer of MMS. This layout was chosen to ensure all patients to prevent study personnel from impeding the workflow of the MMS clinic, and is similar to a workflow 
used in previous studies.

and level of understanding of the Mohs Procedure. In addition, patients will receive an objective 
Mohs Quiz and subjective Satisfaction Survey (Appendices F, G). All of the data collected for the study will be de -identified, HIPPA-compliant and encrypted on a password protected 
Department of Dermat ology server folder.  These secure file folders are restricted and only 
research personnel have access to the files.  In addition to de-identification, encryption and 
password protection, these data are also protected by [CONTACT_249951][INVESTIGATOR_249947] l. 
 
5.1 Design/Study Type   
We propose a randomized control group format with 50% of patients randomized to the control 
limb and 50% of patients randomized to the experimental group.  
5.[ADDRESS_303788] -intervention instruments  
1) State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) 
a. The STAI is a well -known, frequently used measure of patient anxiety within the 
clinical setting.
5,8 This form consists of two forms to assess state anxiety and a 
patient’s baseline trait anxiety. Each form consists of 20 Likert-type questions that 
can be easily answered by a patient with an average reading level. Estimated  time 
for completion of these questions is approximately 2 minutes per form. This form 
has been used in 2 studies to date that assess intraoperative anxiety in Mohs.5,8 
b. We plan to use the anxiety State F orm Y1, appendix A, at baseline and following 
completion of Stage 1 of MMS.  
c. We plan to use the anxiety Trait F orm Y2, appendix B, at baseline only to compare 
the baseline level of anxiety bet ween the control and experimental groups.  
d. Found in Appendices C, D  
 
2) Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
a. The VAS is a frequently employed Likert -type scale that is used to measure 
anxiety.5,8 This 0 -10 scale documents the patients current state of anxiety and can 
be answered by [CONTACT_249952]. Estimated time of completion is under 30 seconds. This form has been used in 2 studies to date and 
CASE PRMC 6617  4 3/2/2018 
 previously by [CONTACT_249953]. 5,8,19 
b. In addition, because of the ease of use this tool has been converted to assess other 
objective measures including understanding. This was previously used by [CONTACT_249954]’s und erstanding of MMS.
[ADDRESS_303789] stage of MMS.   
d. Found in Appendix E  
3) Objective Questionnaire & Patient Satisfaction Survey  
a. We have designed a short,  questionnaire with 6  objective questions related to the 
patient’s understanding of Mohs. This objective portion is to help to delineate objective differences in understanding between the control and experimental groups. This testing was created under the guidance of Dr . Margaret Mann (Mohs 
Surgeon) and similar objective surveys have been used to assess understanding following educational intervention.
12-[ADDRESS_303790] stage of MMS.  
d. See Appendix F & G 
 5.3 Description of Interve ntion  
A standardized script including the counselling that patients would receive in both the control and experimental groups is included in the attached study documents. See Appendix A, B . This will 
allow for patients to receive the same information throughout the study, similarly to our  recently 
completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].
19 Patients in the experimental group will be educated with our 3D printed 
MMS model, in addition to the standardized script.   
5.4 Data Collection   
The same data will be collected from both groups of patients. This information will not include any 
data regarded as protected health information.

medical questions related to their MMS procedure the research assistant will defer to the medical team. Patients will receive educational intervention following baseline testing.  
 
5.[ADDRESS_303792] differences between the control and 
experimental group. Our power analysis was designed to determine the number of patients per group required to determine a difference between the control and exper imental group’s results of 
the STAI Form Y1 (Appendix A). This form detects the differences in patient’s current state of 
CASE PRMC 6617  6 3/2/[ADDRESS_303793] a minimum difference in the STAI Form Y1 of 5 points between the control and experimental groups.   Based on data from prior studie s
5, we anticipate that the mean STAI score will be approximately 
38.7 +/ - 10. We anticipate that a [ADDRESS_303794] deviation of approximately 10, significance set to .05 and power of 80%. Within these constraints we estimate approximately [ADDRESS_303795] (nQuery 
Advisor). Assuming a rate of 10% attrition per every [ADDRESS_303796] outcome of their procedure.  
 6.6  
Ineligible patients for the study fall under one or more of the below criteria:  
• Under 18 years of age  
• Over 90 years of age 
• Cannot complete the survey measures independently for any reason  
 6.[ADDRESS_303797]. Daniel Popkin. This analysis will use basic statistical measurements in order to determine differences between the contr ol and experimental groups. 
Demographic information including age (but excluding birth date), gender and response to prior 
CASE PRMC 6617  7 3/2/[ADDRESS_303798] will be 
used after checking n ormality assumption. In addition, to compare subgroups of the experimental 
and control groups (> 2 groups) ANOVA followed by [CONTACT_249955]. If normality assumption is violated, Wilcoxon rank signed test and Kruskal -Wallis test will be used.  
  6.[ADDRESS_303799] for a patient whom completed the entire protocol, data would be handled according to the digression of the study team. In patients missing only one value, median data point would be applied. If patients were missing one or more values, data would need to be discarded.

What is Skin Cancer?  
Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer and over one million people in the [LOCATION_002] develop skin cancer per year. The majority of these skin cancers are either called either basal cell carcinoma (BCC), or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), based on the cell type the cancer originates from.  
 Patients will either then be counseled using ¶1 – for BCC    ¶2 – for SCC  
¶1 - for BCC: This is the most common skin cancer and almost never spreads, therefo re it is 
very rarely life threatening. This type of tumor can be very locally destructive and can become problematic when it involves structures on the face and neck. As they increase in size, they become more complex to remove and have the potential to invade into bone and other tissues.  ¶2 - for SCC:  This is the second most common form of skin cancer and has the potential to be 
aggressive, but usually only once they reached a size over 2 cm in diameter.  With this tumor type there is concern for invasion into the surrounding tissue, which is why prompt removal of this type of skin cancer is recommended.   These tumors are commonly described by [CONTACT_249956] “pi[INVESTIGATOR_249949]” or “scab that just won’t heal” prior to seeking care from a dermat ologist. Often times the tumor has 
been growing for several months to years, prior to recognition by [CONTACT_249957]. Although a skin cancer may appear small from the surface, in many cases the cancer undergoes extensive growth below the skin, former, deeper root-like branching patterns and thus the visible tumor maybe only represent the “tip of the iceberg.”  
Why people get skin cancer?  
Long -term exposure to sunlight, especially during the teenage years and early adult decades, is 
the single most important factor in the formation of skin cancer. After years of ultraviolet light 
damage to sun-exposed areas, normal skin cells may transform into cancer cells. As a collective group, these cells will divide more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_249950], until they become readily visible to patients and dermatologists as a skin cancer.  
 
What are the treatment options for skin cancer?  
Depending on the specific characteristics of your skin cancer, a number of different treatments 
can be used. These treatments include excision of the tumor, curettage and electrodessication, 
and Mohs Surgery.   
What is Mohs Micrographic Surgery?  
Mohs micrographic surgery is the gold treatment of choice in basal and squamous cell 
carcinoma, when they become large in size and/or effect important functional areas like the head and neck. The goals of this procedure are to completely remove the cancer, preserve normal skin function and are to provide an optimal cosmetic result. Overall, this treatment has a 97- 99% cure 
rate for skin cancer.  
  
The Mohs Procedure  
CASE PRMC 6617  12 3/2/2018 
 The Mohs procedure entails a series of repeated “stages” to ensure complete cancer removal. 
During each stage, a layer of tissue is removed, processed and examined under the microscope to determine if any residual cancer remain s.  
 Before the Mohs procedure, an area surrounding the skin cancer will be numbed with local anesthetic. Once numbed, a thin, “saucer-shaped” layer of tissue is removed. A small portion of healthy tissue around the skin cancer is taken, in attempt to clear the tumor during the first stage of the procedure. This takes approximately 5 minutes, after which time your wound will be bandaged. 
 
Figure 1: Left: Demonstrates the irregular appearance of skin cancer compared to healthy tissue.  Middle: Demonstr ates an example of the first 
layer of tissue take during MMS with residual tumor tissue. Right: Demonstrates the residual tumor embedded in the surrounding tissue.  
*Figures included for IRB review board only, demonstrate how models will be used. For more information see supplemental document  
 The tissue specimen is then taken to the lab, marked and processed. Using a map of the cancer cells in relation to the healthy tissue, the surgeon can determine during microscopic examination if there are remaining can cer cells. The entire stage takes about [ADDRESS_303800] method to treat your wound. Options include allowing the wound to heal naturally, using stiches to sew the wound closed, using a skin grafting to cover the surgical wound, or by [CONTACT_2329] a flap procedure to close the wound. This will be discussed more extensively with your surgeon during the procedure, based on the size and location of your skin cancer.   
What are the advantages of Mohs? 
The major advantages to Mohs Surgery are that this procedure has the highest cure rate for skin 
cancer, removes a minimal amount of healthy tissue, provides the opportunity to achieve an optimal cosmetic outcome with minimal scarring, and eliminates the need for general anesthesia or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].   
What are th e risks of Mohs?  
The risks of surgery, as with any trauma to the skin, risks include bleeding, bruising around the 
surgical area, a risk of infection below 1% and local numbness. In addition, there is often a need to extend surgical incisions approximately  3 times the length of the initial incision to facilitate 
optimal closure of the surgical wound. Again, these risks are shared by [CONTACT_249958], whether MMS or non- MMS.

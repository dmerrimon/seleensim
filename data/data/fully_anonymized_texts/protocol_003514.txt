Context :   
In 2012, 3,328 people were killed and an additional  421,000 were injured in crashes 
involving a distracted driver1. Adults aged greater than 40 years old accounted for 44% of 
these fatalities2. Teen driving behavior is heavily influenced by [CONTACT_367295] a recent study showing the proport ion of teens that text while driving is 14% higher if 
they have observed their parents doing the same4. The proportion of adults who text while 
driving has recently surpassed teen rates with a 2013 national poll finding 49% of adult car 
commuters admit to texting while driving, most stating that they did it out of habit5. Based 
on previous findings, it is unlikely that teens will reduce their texting while driving unless 
their parents do the same.  
Objectives :  
The objective of this study is to compare measu res of acceptance and feasibility across teen -
parent dyads randomized to bidirectional teen -parent (teen monitors parent and parent 
monitors teen) vs. teen only (parent monitors teen) cellphone use while driving.  
Study Design :  
Research participants will be recruited to take part in a randomized control trial. 
Participants’ cellphone use will be observed during an initial baseline period. Participants 
will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions ( bidirectional teen -parent monitoring or 
parental monit oring of the teen only ). An exit survey and interview will be administered to 
both the parent and teen separately at the end of the study.  
Setting/Participants:  
High  school students who are age [ADDRESS_459238] an average of 4 
or more trips per week  and hold a valid  driver’s licenses and a parent for each teen will be 
recruited. Other inclusion criteria include living with their teen /parent , having their own 
smartphone  (iPhone 4S or newer or Android 4.3 or newer) with data plan , admit ting to 
texting while driving at least once in the past month , and do not currently use a c ellphone 
blocking app or device , parent willing to install device and adjust settings as necessary .  
Study Interventions and Measures :  
Cellphone blocking devi ce(s) (Cellcontrol DriveID) will be mailed or given directly to 
participants  for each car driven by [CONTACT_367296]/or parent.  DriveID will measure all 
participant cellphone use while the cellphone is in the car  for the first three weeks . During 
   
   2 
the intervention period, p articipants will be randomized to one of the two conditions  and 
followed for 8 weeks . Surveys will also be adm inistered as part of this study.  
1.     BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver; an additional 
421,000 people were injured.1 Adults aged greater than 40 years old accounted for 44% of 
these fatalities, and drivers under the age of 20 were more likely than any other age group to 
die in distracti on-related crashes caused by [CONTACT_367297]. According to a CDC survey, 43% 
of U.S. high school students admit to texting while driving in the last 30 days,2 despi[INVESTIGATOR_367289].3 It has been well established that teen  
driving behavior is heavily influenced by [CONTACT_367298]. A recent study 
demonstrated the proportion of teens that text while driving is 14% higher if they have 
observed their parents doing the same.4 Unfortunately, the proportion of adults who  text 
while driving has recently surpassed teen rates with a 2013 national poll finding 49% of 
adult car commuters admit to texting while driving.[ADDRESS_459239] of these adults surveyed said they 
did this out of habit, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] 98% also knowing it unsafe, and 60% s aying they did not do 
this three years ago.[ADDRESS_459240] more weight on benefits realized now and less weight on costs realized in the future, 
leading to prioritizing immediate pleasure over actio ns that are in one’s long -term interest.[ADDRESS_459241] not been trialed for 
combating texting while driving. Furthermore, given the above findings, it is unlikely that 
teens will reduce texting while driving unless their parents do the same. 
1.2 Name [CONTACT_367312] 2013 as a device to overcome a 
technological barrier in being able to accurately measure whether a driver’s cellphone is 
being used while driving. It is a solar -powered Bluetooth signaling technology placed on the 
car wind shield. DriveID  can measure type of cellphone use while driving and be configured 
to block a driver’s cellphone use while the vehicle is in motion.  There is no physical 
interaction with the DriveID device other than installation.  
   
   3 
The device is placed on th e windshield and  an app is downloaded on to the phone. Online 
configuration of the device settings takes approximately 3-5 minutes. After the initial 
installation, the device is always on and interacts with the user ’s cellphone in the 
background. Only the cellphone with the corresponding DriveID application is monitored by 
[CONTACT_72677]. The DriveID device directly measures the  vehicle’s movements  and can 
be set to lock the phone at speeds as low as 1 mph. Device setup is flexible to allow  specif ic 
smartphone applications like navigation and maps  to be used if initiated when stopped . The 
blocking function cannot be deactivated without permission of the account holder.  
The study intervention involves randomization into one of two conditions : teen -parent  
monitoring and teen only monitoring. In the bidirectional teen -parent monitoring condition, 
the teen driver will receive an automatic notification (via email) when one of his or her 
parents overrides the DriveID blocking function to use their phone while driving along with 
the parent receiving a notification when their teen overrides the blocking function. The teen 
only monitoring condition only involves the parent/guardian receiving a notification (via 
email) if their teen overrides the DriveID blocking f unction. Furthermore, if anyone ta mper s 
with the DriveID device, delete the corresponding application from their smartphone, or 
disable Bluetooth capabilities, an email will be sent to a member of the study team.  
1.[ADDRESS_459242] rigorous study of the crash risk associated with distraction from 
cellphone use was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2014.  The 
authors conducted two studies on the relationship between the performance of secondary 
tasks, including cell -phone use, and the risk of crashes and near -crashes. To facilitate 
objective assessment, accelerometers, cameras, global positioning systems, and other 
sensors were installed in the vehicles of 42 newly licensed drivers ( 16.3 to 17.0 years of age) 
and 109 adults with more driving experience.   
During the study periods, 167 crashes and near -crashes among novice drivers and 518 
crashes and near -crashes among experienced drivers were identified. The risk of a crash or 
near-crash among novice drivers increased significantly if they were dialing a cell phone 
(odds ratio, 8.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.83 to 24.42), reaching for a cell phone 
(odds ratio, 7.05; 95% CI, 2.64 to 18.83), sending or receiving text messages (odds  ratio, 
3.87; 95% CI, 1.62 to 9.25), reaching for an object other than a cell phone (odds ratio, 8.00; 
95% CI, 3.67 to 17.50), looking at a roadside object (odds ratio, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.72 to 8.81), 
or eating (odds ratio, 2.99; 95% CI, 1.30 to 6.91). Among experienced drivers, dialing a cell 
phone was associated with a significantly increased risk of a crash or near -crash (odds ratio, 
2.49; 95% CI, 1.38 to 4.54); the risk associated with texting or accessing the Internet was 
not assessed in this population. The prevalence of high -risk attention to secondary tasks 
increased over time among novice drivers but not among experienced drivers.  
The authors concluded that the risk of a crash or near -crash among novice drivers 
increased with the performance of many se condary tasks, including texting and dialing cell 
phones. The study was funded by [CONTACT_72678].  
   
   4 
There is one previous field study using Cellcontrol’s cellphone blocking/filtering 
technology to reduce cellphone use while driving, which was funded by [CONTACT_72679] (NHTSA Contract DOT HS 811 863) and 
carried out by [CONTACT_367299].  The abstract of the full report 
published online in December 2013 states:  
Forty -four participants each received a cell phone filtering/blocking application on 
their employer -provided cell phones for [ADDRESS_459243] 3 week s, 
cell phone activity including calling, text messaging and application use was simply 
recorded in the background. During the middle 3 weeks, the cell phone 
filtering/blocking software was active, meaning that anytime the application sensed 
that the phone  was moving faster than the pre -set speed threshold, all phone activity 
was blocked. Objective data on participants’ phone use behavior and subjective data 
(from a questionnaire) on participants’ acceptance were collected. Additionally, the 
impact on an or ganization attempting to implement a similar program employing cell 
phone filtering/blocking was examined. During the blocking period, participants 
initiated a higher proportion of their calls when stopped than when the blocking 
software was inactive. Also , during the blocking period, participants answered a 
much smaller proportion of incoming calls while driving, and outgoing calls were 
placed at a lower mean speed. Participants were neutral in their opi[INVESTIGATOR_367290] a safety benefit from the cell phone blocking.  
1.4 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance of all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5765]  45 CFR 46. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol and will report 
unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with The 
Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_367291]. Collection, recording, and reporting of data will be accurate and will ensure 
the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and after the study.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The purpose o f the study is to demonstrate acceptance and feasibility of conducting a field 
trial of cellphone blocking technology between parents and their  teen drivers to calculate 
sample sizes for future trials and generate preliminary data for funding applications.  
Primarily, the proposed is measuring whether the bidirectional teen -parent monitoring 
approach decreases overall cellphone use while driving for both teen and parent.  
   
   5 
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)  
The primary objective of this study is to compare measures of  acceptance and feasibility of 
teen-parent dyads randomized to bidirectional teen -parent vs. teen only monitoring of 
cellphone use while driving in an  on-road driving study . 
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondary objectives are to:  
1. To compare the : a) number of cellphone unlocks per hour of drive time; and b)  total 
proportion of non zero -speed drive time spent using a cellphone while driving  in teen-
parent dyads randomized to bidirectional teen -parent vs. teen only monitoring of 
cellphone use while d riving in an on -road driving study .  These estimates will be used 
to design a future, well -powered study examining the comparative effectiveness of 
these two approaches as the primary objective.  
2. To determine the drive and environmental characteristics of instances in which a 
phone is unlocked using data collected from the DriveID device overlayed with data 
collected from Geographic Information Systems (GIS).   
3. Measure the reasons cellphones are  being used while driving at non -zero speeds 
among teens and their parents (calls, texts, smartphone apps, etc .)  
4. Measure teen and parent satisfaction with the cellphone monitoring and blocking 
device  
5. Determine the incidence of handheld cellphone use while driving and its 
relationship to incoming text messages and driving conditions in a teen driver s 
and their parents .   
6. Measure the number of phone unlocks per hour of drive time  
7. Measure the speed of the car, acceleration, and spatial characteristics of  phone 
unlocks (ex. on highways vs. at intersections)  
 
[ADDRESS_459244] a study team member for more information about the 
study, and/or, they  will be directed to the Way to Health platform  for more study 
information as well as consent. All participants who consent will be contact[CONTACT_426] a me mber 
of the study team to ensure full comprehension of study procedures and requirements.   
Participants will also be recruited through posted flyers, postcards, email blasts, through the 
Recruitment Enhancement Core (REC), social media, and by [CONTACT_72683] -of-mout h/colleague 
   
   [ADDRESS_459245] obtaining permission. Postcards will be mailed to 
potentially eligible families identified by [CONTACT_72684] & Health 
Innovation Lab.  
The Penn Social Media & Health Innova tion Lab will assist with recruitment through a 
variety of social media outlets including Facebook and Craigslist. Language for these 
postings have been included with the application.  
Interested participants will be directed to the Way to Health platform. A parent will create 
an account and consent online. Once consent is obtained, teens will be able to create their 
own account and assent online. Once consent and assent are obtained, parents and teens will 
be screened for eligibility with an eligibility sur vey presented on the Way to Health 
platform. Only eligibility criteria will be asked. If a participant responds “yes” to all 
questions, teens and parents will each be presented with an intake survey on the Way to 
Health platform. Questions will cover demog raphics, opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], perceptions and experiences 
with texting and driving. Both parent and teen will be asked to email the study team a 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_72662]’s license. A member of the study team will also contact [CONTACT_367300]. If a teen is not eligible, the 
participant will be informed that they are ineligible for the current study.  
If participants turn [ADDRESS_459246] to Health . 
3.1.2 Baseline Measurement Period (Weeks 1 -3) 
DriveID will monitor all cellphone use while the participant’s cellphone is in the car in 
which DriveID is installed.  During the Baseline Measurement Period, DriveID will only 
monitor cellphone use while driving; n o blocking will occur. During this period the 
Cellcontrol app runs in the background.   
3.1.3 Intervention  Measurement Period  (Weeks 4-8) 
DriveID will monitor all cellphone use while the participant’s  cellphone is in the car in 
which DriveID is installed. The ap plication will  be used as a cellphone blocking device 
where the phone will lock the phone screen while driving  and block  incoming calls and 
texts.  The  locking function can be overridden with a tap of a button on the home screen . 
This use of this application has been approved by [CONTACT_367301] 14-[ZIP_CODE]  for use in a teen 
driver cohort.  DriveID continuously monitor s cellphone use while driving , regardless of 
whether the blocking function is activated,  including how often the teen and/ or parent 
unlocks the cellphone as well as if they are using the phone for a call or other  handheld  
phone features. However, DriveID is not able to differentiate which phone features are being 
used. DriveID will capture GPS data throughout the measurement period . A survey 
following the baseline period  (end of Week 3 ) will be administered to gain feedback. At the 
completion of Week 8 or upon voluntary withdrawal from the trial, the participants will be 
instructed to complete an online survey administered thr ough Penn’s Way to Health IT 
   
   [ADDRESS_459247] pair  will be up to eight  weeks . 
3.3.2 Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projected

use while driving  
Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any violations 
of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and Procedu res.  
4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Screening Procedure  and Online Consent/Assent Process  
Potential participants will be recruited through methods discussed in section 8.5. Teens and 
parents will be instructed that the parent first needs to create a n account through th e WTH 
platform and then review a consent and sign prior to their teen being screened for the trial. 
Way to Health collects basic demographic information from every person creating an 
account, including date of birth. After a parent consents for  them and  their teen to 
participate , parents will be presented with an eligibility survey. If elibilble,  they will be 
instructed to have their teen go to the WTH site and register. Teens  will then review and 
sign an assent for the trial. Following this they will be sc reened with an eligibility survey 
presented on the WTH  platform. If a participant is eligible, they will be allowed to continue 
in the trial and will be asked to complete the intake survey immediately. Questions will 
cover demographics, opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], perceptio ns and experiences with texting and driving.  They 
will then continue on with their trial participation. If they are not eligible,  the participant will 
be informed that they are ineligible for the current study  and will not complete any study 
procedures. Th ese teens will be documented as screen failures . After teen assent and 
eligibility is completed, parents will be able to sign back into Way to Health and complete 
the intake survey.  
Teens and parents will be asked to email the study team a copy of their driver’s license. A 
member of the study team will then contact [CONTACT_72689]/guardian to schedule an in 
person meeting or a phone meeting. During this meeting the study team will answer any 
questions pertaining to the consent or the study and distrib ute the DriveID device in person 
or by [CONTACT_2319]. If a participant turns 18 years old during their participation in the study, a 
member of the study team will email the teen a link to complete the online consent via WTH 
in order to re -consent. Participants will  receive an email or a text message reminder 
regarding incomplete steps in WTH depending on their preference selection for 
communication.  
The validation of the online consent/assent process will be met during this meeting and 
allow for the fulfillment of o ne of the study aims: to demonstrate the feasibility and 
effectiveness of an online consent process in order to remotely recruit a larger number of 
participants in future studies among those who purchase the Cellcontrol product. During the 
meeting, a membe r of the study team will ensure that the participants truly understand the 
   
   [ADDRESS_459248] ; the size of the 
device is approximately [ADDRESS_459249] of a baseline measurement period, a n intervention 
and a debriefing period . 
4.3.1 Intervention  
DriveID will measure participants ’ trip characteristi cs (duration, mileage, speed) and 
cellphone use while the cellphone is in the car in which the DriveID device is installed. 
DriveID will also record GPS data. This data will not be accessed in real time by [CONTACT_367302] c ompletion of the drive.  
Coded  data on primary and secondary endpoints will be automatically uploaded daily 
whenever the phone has a Wi-Fi or cellular data connection to the Cellcontrol server and 
then exported through an encrypted, secure internet connect ion to Penn’s Way to Health IT 
Platform for management and analysis via linkage of a study ID  (as has been established 
under IRB 14-[ZIP_CODE] ).   
After baseline period, parents can view teen trip summaries.  
4.3.2 Debriefing  
At the completion of Week 8 or upon voluntary with drawal from the trial, the participant s 
will be instructed to complete an online survey administered through Penn’s Way to Health 
IT platform asking about user satisfaction with the device.  They will receive a link to the  
survey thro ugh email. If necessary, they may receive reminder calls from members of the 
study team  for a one month period following study completion . The purpose of the survey 
will be to debrief the participant’s experience with the trial, cellphone blocking technolo gy, 
and suggestions for designing a better trial. For subjects that withdrawal prematurely, we 
will ask about what factors contributed to the ir decision to withdraw early.  
For participants who complete the trial, a member of the study team may contact [CONTACT_941] m to 
complete a brief , semi -structured  exit phone interview . 
   
   [ADDRESS_459250] Completion/Withdrawal  
Participants may withdraw from the study at any time. They may also be discontinued from 
the study at the discretion of the Investigators at any time.  
5 STUDY EVALUATI ONS AND MEASUREMENTS  
5.1 Confirmation of Eligibility  
Members of the research team will confirm the eligibility of potential subjects based on the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria noted in Section 3.4 during the in -person meeting  or phone call , 
after the online con sent/assent process . A parent or guardian will first need to create an 
account on the Way to Health platform and complete consent online. Once consent is 
obtained, teens will need to create an account on the Way to Health platform and complete 
assent. Afte r consent  and assent are completed , parents and teens  will each be presented 
with a survey to confirm eligibility. If they are eligible, an intake survey will be available for 
teens to complete. A study team member will contact [CONTACT_238538] c onfirm eligibility . 
Confirmation of eligibility will be recorded and retained for all individuals . If subjects are 
not eligible, no other study procedures will occur.

behaviors for the previous three  weeks in which they were enrolled in the trial study. 
Information includes how often they report texting and driving and self -report cellphone use.  
5.[ADDRESS_459253] To Health , to elicit feedback on the 
cellphone blocking technology .  Participants  will be asked to report:  
• Their feedback on using the cellphone blocking technology  
• Feedback on settings /configurations of the cellphone blocking technology  
• Perceptions of whether their sa fety had improved with the use of the technology  
• Suggestions for improving the technology  and the research study  
• Suggestions for future interventions to promote engaged driving  
5.[ADDRESS_459254] no interaction with the physical DriveID device after installation. 
There are no expected serious adverse events related to t he intervention or participation in 
this study.   
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_72666] .   
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
In determining feasibility the following endpoints will be measured:  
• Proportion of screen eligible  who enroll  
• Number enrolled per month  
• Retention rates by [CONTACT_30157]  
• Proportion of surveys completed  
• Acceptance of cellphone blocking strat egy measured on Likert scale in post -study 
survey 
6.[ADDRESS_459255] descriptive 
summaries (e.g. means and standard deviations for continuous variables such as age and 
percentages for categorical variables such as gender).  
6.3.2 Efficacy Analysis  
The primary analysis will be based on an i ntention to treat approach and will include all 
subjects randomized at the beginning of the intervention period . 
Primary endpoints on feasibility and acceptability will tabulated across randomization arms 
using descriptive statistics.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints will summarized with descriptive statistics across arms and 
will include : 
Frequency of phone unlocks at non -zero speeds  
Total proportion of trip time the phone is in use at non -zero speeds  
Total proportion of trip time  on non-call related phone use at non -zero speeds  
Total proportion of trip time  on call-related phone use at non -zero speeds  
Total proportion of trip time  on non-call related phone use while stopped.  
Total proportion of trip time  on call-related phone use while stopped.  
 
The statist ical model used for the efficacy analysis will be tailored to the selected endpoint, 
but will likely be evaluated with a multilevel model to examine within -subject and across -
subject changes over time.  
A secondary epi[INVESTIGATOR_367292] d riving and environmental 
characteristics associated with the instant a phone is unlocked at non -zero speeds.  This will 
include vehicle speed, acceleration, time of day, and road and weather characteristics based 
on GPS location of the phone unlock.   
STUDY INTERVENTION  
6.[ADDRESS_459256] the ability to override the blocking. Number 
of unlocks can be monitored through logging in to the Cellcontrol  webs ite. 
The teen only monitoring group  involves parental monitoring of teen’s cellphone use while 
driving only. The parent will receive an email notification when their teen unlocks their 
phone while driving.  Both parent and teen will drive under the same res trictions, but only 
the parent will be notified of teen cellphone use.  
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to research involvin g risks to subjects or others happen 
during the course of this study (including SAEs) they will be reported to the IRB in 
accordance with CHOP IRB SOP 408: Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. 
AEs that are not serious but that are notable an d could involve risks to subjects will be 
summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing 
review.  
Enrolled participants will be provided with contact [CONTACT_21115] a study team member for 
reporting of any adverse  events that occur during data collection. They will be told to 
contact [CONTACT_367303], including but not limited to, 
moving violations/citations while participating, traffic accidents, DriveID malfunction, etc.  
[ADDRESS_459257] To Health  collects subjects’ names, dates of birth, addresses, email addresses, 
phone numbers, and the last four digits of their social security number. They also request the 
name [CONTACT_72705]. To assure that participant confidentiality is 
preserved, individual identifiers are stored in a single password protected system that is 
accessible only to study research, analysis and IT staff. The last four digits of participants’ 
social security numbers will be stored in a locked cabinet to be d estroyed at a later date. An 
investigator or statistician who logs in will be able to access only non-identifiable  data. The 
Way To Health  administrative group and research coordinators responsible for contact[CONTACT_72695] -up study visits or responding to questions about the study are able to 
view participant names and contact [CONTACT_3031].  The WTH web development team and 
Project Director currently have administrative access to PHI. All of these personnel will 
have completed Human Subjects Pr otection and HIPAA privacy training. The system 
automatically generates logs of all data queries which can be reviewed by [CONTACT_367304]. This 
system is hosted on site at  The University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) and is protected by a 
secure firewall and several layers of operational security. Once a participant has been 
entered into this system, they are given a unique study identification number (ID). Any 
datasets and compu ter files that leave the firewall are stripped of all identifiers and 
individuals are referred to by [CONTACT_72697]. The study ID is also used on all analytical files.  
The Penn Medicine Academic Computing Services (PMACS) is the hub for the hardware 
and database infrastructure that supports the project and the Way To Health  web portal is 
built on this infrastructure. The data collected for Way To Health  based studies is stored in 
mySQL databases on a PMACS -operated blade server environment devoted specifically to 
Way To Health . The data center is housed in Information Systems and Computing at [ADDRESS_459258] party data sources ( i.e. 
survey software) is stripp ed of any identifiers and transmitted in encrypted format. The same 
unique study ID is used to link these outside data to the participants. All data for this project 
will be stored on the secure/firewalled servers of the PMACS Data Center, in data files th at 
will be protected by [CONTACT_164259]. These data servers are maintained in a 
guarded facility behind several locked doors, with very limited physical access rights. They 
are also cyber -protected by [CONTACT_367305]. Electronic access rights are carefully controlled by [CONTACT_111551].  
   
   [ADDRESS_459259] To Health  uses highly secure methods of data encryption for all transactions involving 
participant's financial information using a level of security com parable to what is used in 
commercial financial transactions. This multi -layer system of data security, identical to the 
system protecting the University of Pennsylvania Health Systems medical records, greatly 
minimizes the risk of loss of privacy. All com munications between users and our site will be 
encrypted with SSL/HTTPs technology.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_459260] to Health through secure CSV reports.  Data 
will not be tracked in real time.  
8.2.3 Semi -Structured Interview  
The semi -structured interview will be completed by a member of the study team and will be 
recorded by [CONTACT_72698]’s Mixed Methods Research Lab. The MMRL provides verbatim 
transcription of i ndividual and group data through Accurate, Dependable, Affordable  (ADA) 
transcriptions services. ADA provides secure and confidential data transfers consistent with 
the University of Pennsylvania’s Institutional Review Board data safety standard. ADA 
provi des transcription services that are also consistent with federal Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guidelines and regulations. The MMRL works 
with ADA to check for accuracy. Once accuracy in transcription is determined, original 
recordings are destroyed.   
8.[ADDRESS_459261] 
confidentiality.  
No identifiable data will be used for future studies without participant’s consent for future 
use of data and without first obtaining IRB approval. The investigator will obtain a data use 
agreement between provid er (the PI) and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including others at 
CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (dates and zip codes).  
8.[ADDRESS_459262] for t his study as it is a study with 
minimal risk and without medical or biological intervention, the research teams at the 
University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684], led by [CONTACT_21422], will be aware of and will monitor possi ble areas of risk to the research 
participants. Weekly team meetings will include discussion of any safety and data issues that 
are observed. The PIs will be responsible for monitoring the data and safety . 
   
   17 
8.4.2 Risk Assessment  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_367293], it is 
acknowledged that there is minimal risk to participants.  
Loss of confidentiality is a potential risk of participating in this study; however, the 
safeguards put in place by [CONTACT_367306]  (Section 8.1) will reduce this likelihood. The 
members of the study teams will follow necessary precautio ns to ensure that all collected 
data is not shared with unauthorized individuals or groups . 
As part of this study, teens will be driving with a cell phone blocking d evice present and 
operating in the vehicle. These teens are eligible for the study because they admit to texting 
while driving. This study will not require them to interact with their phones while driving 
any more than they would normally choose to on thei r own . We will encourage participants  
throughout the study to drive safely and not to use their cell phones while driving.  
It is possible that participants may feel uncomfortable answering some of the interview 
questions. They will be made aware before the  start of the interview that this is a risk 
associated with participation in the interview and will be reminded that they do not have to 
answer any questions which make them uncomfortable.  
 
8.4.[ADDRESS_459263] bene fits from participating in this study .  
8.4.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
The gathered information has the potential to increase the understanding of teen’s  and 
parent’s  opi[INVESTIGATOR_367294]. The research has the potential to 
enhance the foundat ion of behavioral change models and improve the quality of continuing 
education about safety. The results may also speak to the benefits of using cellphone 
blocking devices in -vehicle for promoting positive safety behaviors; these benefits outweigh 
the min imal risk of participation in this study .  
8.[ADDRESS_459264] of on -the-ground recruitment strategies (posting 
posters and flyers in visible areas, recruitment through local school districts), direct mailer 
(email blasts , letter or postcard sent to home address), social media (facebook, craigslist, 
snapchat, etc),  for -profit and nonprofit organization partnerships/mentions, media attention 
(mentions in local and national news sources), and word -of-mouth referrals.  
On-the-ground recruitment strategies include posting flyers in areas where teen drivers and 
parents frequent and recruiting through local school boards. These locations will include 
parks, malls, and other after school hangouts. These materials will only be post ed in the 
Philadelphia area rather than nationwide.  We will also reach out to local school boards to 
ask about having flyers posted and/or sent to parents in the Philadelphia.  We will contact 
   
   [ADDRESS_459265] and/or are willing to mail letters to parents of 
teen drivers in their school district. This will only be done in the Philadelphia area. No 
recruitment will occur through sch ools or public places without first obtaining permission. 
Letters, postcards, and flyers will consist of the messaging in the letters, postcards, and flyer 
we have attached to this protocol.  
We will also recruit participants by [CONTACT_367307] e mail blasts to parents of teen 
drivers. We will work with CHOP’s Recruitment Enhancement Core (REC) to contact 
[CONTACT_72702]/or postcards. The REC will also send email blast s to families on our behalf. These 
emails will consist of the messages included in the letters attached to this protocol. 
Recruitment efforts will include sending mailings in addition to the REC contact[CONTACT_367308]. Investigators will also obtain  mailing labels with potential subjects' names 
and addresses for recruitment letters from the REC.  
Social media sources will also be used for recruitment purposes. We plan to use Facebook, 
Craigslist, Twitter, Snapchat, Google, and Instagram in our social media campaign. The 
Penn Social Media & Health Innovation Lab will assist us in using the various social media 
outlets so that we can be as effective as possible in disseminating the recruitment message to 
the correct population. With many of these mediums  we will be able to target teens and 
parents with separate ads. In those cases we will provide recruitment ads that are targeted for 
that specific population. In many cases the social media ad that we can use consists of a 
brief message (i.e., Twitter only  allows a 160 character message). In these cases the message 
would direct the potential participant to the WTH landing page where they can register. On 
this page we will recreate the full message that is included in the recruitment letters so that 
all part icipants are well informed of the study details prior to registering for the study. Final 
advertisements and Twitter messages have been attached to this protocol.  
The use of social media in this trial will include only IRB approved advertisements. These 
advertisements will be used on social media in a manner that does not allow commenting, 
posts, or conversation. They will be posted in a way that they will appear like any other 
advertisement. We will not be creating any social media site where posts or comm ents can 
be made (such as a facebook site) instead we will only commence with advertising this study 
on social media in a form where we will not have to monitor chats and comments. Only IRB 
approved study staff can post these ads on these sites, after disc ussion with the study team.  
We will be reaching out to many for profit and nonprofit organizations that might be willing 
to help us advertise this study. These organizations include but are not limited to MADD, 
insurance companies, and cell phone companies  (other examples: 
madd.org< http://madd.org >, vsofa.org< http://vsofa.org >, 
stoptextsstopwrecks.org< http:// stoptextsstopwrecks.org >, 
aaafoundation.org< http://aaafoundation.org >, enddd.org< http://enddd.org >, 
digitalresponsibility.org< http://digitalresponsibility.org >).  We will ask these organizations 
if they would be willing to advertise to consumers using the flyer, letter, or brief mentions 
on their websites. Letters and flyers would be the same as th ose used for other recruitment 
strategies. Brief mentions would redirect potential participants to the WTH landing page 
where they would read the full recruitment message.  
   
   19 
We will be working with the CHOP ad UPenn media relations offices to learn various w ays 
we might get mentions for this study in the press.  We hope that some local and nationwide 
news outlets (Penn News Today, NPR, and other print and online newsletters) will be 
interested in doing a story on the goals of this program and that this media attention will 
help with recruitment. If we are successful in getting media attention the lead Penn PI [INVESTIGATOR_25847], Kit Delgado, will conduct interviews and ensure that a link to the WTH landing 
page is included in any material produced around the study .  
While all the above recruitment strategies may differ in terms of their approach, message 
length and type, each method will direct all potential participants  either  to the WTH landing 
page where a standard message giving an overview of the program will be posted , or to 
contact [CONTACT_367309] (via the Way 
to Health website) . That landing page text has been included in this protocol as well. It is 
important to stress that because of this method all po tential participants will be exposed to 
the same recruitment message and study information prior to registering for the program.  
The Recruitment Enhancement Core provides assistance with recruitment plan development 
and will identify and contact [CONTACT_367310], and the CHOP Recruitment Registry.  
 
8.6 Informed Consent/Assent  
We will require parental consent and teen assent for this trial. Parental consent and 
subject assent for this trial will be obtained via  Way to Health. Interested participants will 
be directed to the Way to Health Platform to get more information on the trial and 
complete the online consent/assent process.  
Teens and parents will be instructed that the parent first needs to create a userna me and 
password through the WTH platform and then review a consent and sign prior to their 
teen being screened for the trial. After a parent consents for  themselves and  their teen to 
participate , they will be presented with the eligibility survey. If eligi ble, they will be 
instructed to have their teen go to the WTH site and register. Teens will then review and 
sign an assent for the trial. Following this they will be screened with an eligibility survey 
presented on the WTH platform. If a participant is eli gible,  they will be allowed to 
continue in the trial and will be asked to complete the intake survey immediately. 
Questions will cover demographics, opi[INVESTIGATOR_6153], perceptions and experiences with texting 
and driving. They will then continue on with their trial  participation. If they are not 
eligible , the participant will be informed that they are ineligible for the current study and 
will not complete any study procedure s. These teens will be documented as screen 
failures . If a teen assents and is eligible, pare nts will then sign back into Way to Health to 
complete the intake survey.  
A member of the study team will then contact [CONTACT_72689]/guardian to schedule an 
in person meeting or a phone meeting. During this meeting the study team will answer 
any que stions pertaining to the consent or the study and distribute the DriveID device in 
person or by [CONTACT_2319]. If a participant turns 18 years old during their participation in the 
   
   20 
study, a member of the study team will email the teen a link to complete the online 
consent via WTH in order to re -consent. Participants will receive an email or a text 
message reminder regarding incomplete steps in WTH depending on their preference 
selection for communication.  
The validation of the online consent/assent process will be m et during this meeting and 
allow for the fulfillment of one of the study aims: to demonstrate the feasibility and 
effectiveness of an online consent process in order to remotely recruit a larger number of 
participants in future studies among those who purc hase the Cellcontrol product. During 
the meeting, a member of the study team will ensure that the participants truly understand 
the risks and benefits of the study. If any participants wish to withdraw, they may do so at 
this time.  
A member of the study te am will contact [CONTACT_367311]. Electronic signatures will be obtained for both parent and child.  
 
8.7 Payment to Subjects/Families  
8.7.1 Payment for time and inconvenience (i.e. compensation)  
Teen p articipants will be compensated up to a total of $ 110 and parent participants will be 
compensated up to a total $110  for their time, effort, and inconvenience over the duration of 
the study:  
• Teen Intake Survey : $ 20 
• Parent Intake Survey : $20 
• End of Baseline Survey Tee n: $30

Title of Study:  
A 40 to 52 -Week  Open-Label Extension Stud y to Evaluat e TNX -102 SL Taken D aily at Bedtime 
in Patients with PT SD 
Stud y period (months): [ADDRESS_253832] patient enrolled:   April  [ADDRESS_253833] patient completed: September  2019  Phase of development: 3  
 
Objectives  
Primary:  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety of TNX -[ADDRESS_253834] also participated in  an initial  
12-week  open -label extension study (TNX -CY-P303).   This will provide at least [ADDRESS_253835] 50 patients .   
Methodology:  
This is an open -label, extension trial designed to evaluate safety  of additional 40 to 52 weeks of TNX -
102 SL  5.6 mg  taken daily at bedtime for the treatment of PTSD. There are two possible “tracks” 
patients can use to enroll into this study:  
Track A:  patients that complete  the double -blind lead -in HONOR  study and complete or ar e 
active (at the time of study discontinuation) in the  12-week open -label extension study , P303 , 
and received active drug in the  12-week  double -blind lead-in study , P301/HONOR.  
Track B:  patients that are currently enrolled  in the double -blind lead -in P301/ HONOR study that 
has been discontinued  due to  results of  an interim analysis  or ar e active (at the time of study 
discontinuation) in the  12-week open -label extension study , P303 , and received placebo in the 
12-week double -blind lead -in study, P301/HONOR . 
The study will consist of 5  or 6 in-clinic study visits, including Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0, which is 
anticipated to be the same visit as the last visit of the 12-week  open -label extension study P303  for 
Track A  patients) , followed by [INVESTIGATOR_2993] -clinic visits after 7, 16, 28 and 40 weeks of open -label treatment.  
Patients who are active in the 12 -week double -blind  lead-in study  (P301/HONOR) at the t ime of 
enrollment  to P306  will also have a [ADDRESS_253836]  52 
weeks  of open -label treatment and a  Visit 7.  For patients  enrolled from the  discontinued  double -blind 
lead-in study, P301/HONOR , the P306 Baseline Visit will occur in lieu of an early termination visit.    
Patient safety parameters recorded at the final visit in the double -blind lead -in HONOR study  (which 
is the baseline visit  in the 12-week open -label extension study  P303 ) can also be used a s the baseline 
safety values for th e P306  extension study  for Track A patients .  Patients will attend  clinic visits at 7-, 
9-, and  12-week intervals as indicated in the study visit schedule.  Eligible patients who provide 
written informed consent will be p rovided with a supply of TNX -[ADDRESS_253837] blood drawn for pharmacogen omic  testing.   
Number of patients (planned):  
The study will enroll up to  200 patients.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:

3. The patient met all prior inclusion and exclusion requirements for the double -blind lead -in 
HONOR study, or the site received medical monitor approval for the patient to remain in the 
lead-in study after the retrospective discovery of an entry violation that did not pose any 
threat to the patient’s safety or well -being.  
4. During the course of the lead -in HONOR study  or 12 -week open -label extension P303 study , 
the patient has had no intervening medical conditions including pregnancy, clinically 
significant increase  in suicidal ideation (plan or intent) or significant worsening of 
depression, newly arising  clinically significant abnormal laboratory tests, or any clinically 
significant, uncontrolled, or unstable medical or surgical condition that could affect the 
patient’s ability to participate in the study or potentially compromise the patient’s well -being  
during the study . 
5. The patient does not require treatment with a potent (strong) cytochrome P450 subtype 3A4 
(CYP3A4) inhibitor, or St. John’s wort.  
6. The patient is willing to refrain from use of all other formulations of cyclobenzaprine for the 
duration of  the study.

Dose, route, frequency: 2 tablets of TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg  taken simultaneously and sublingually 
(under the tongue ) each day at bedtime starting on Day 0 for 40 to 52  weeks.  
Duration of treatment:  
40 to 52 weeks  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration:  None  
Criteria for evaluation:  
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of bedtime treatment with TNX -[ADDRESS_253838] either completed the double -
blind lead -in HONOR study and completed or are active (at the time of study discontinuation) in the  
12-week open -label extension study , P303 , or were enrolled in the double -blind lead -in HON OR 
study that  has bee n discontinued due to results  of an interim analysis .  Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_211952], clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, the monitoring of suicidality 
using the Columbia Suicide Rating Scale (C -SSRS) scale , and the monitoring of depressive 
symptoms using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II). Safety as well as durability of response will 
also be assessed by [CONTACT_211953] -Specific Version 
(PCL -S) at Visit 5  (Week 28)  and Visit 6 (Week 40) in order to  monitor for  any potential worsening 
of PTSD symptoms or its symptoms clusters  during the final [ADDRESS_253839] an additional  PCL-S evaluated for safety at their Visit 7 (Week 52).  
Limited efficacy assessments consisting of the CGI -I, SDS, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance and the BDI -
II will be collected at each visit.  The PCL -S will be  used for efficacy assessments at Visits 5 and 6 
only.  
Statistic s 
Analys is Population :  
The Safety Population will comprise all patients who have been exposed to  TNX -102 SL . 
 
Safety Analyses :   
Safety data will be summarized as a single treatment group receiving 1 or more  doses  of TNX -102 SL  
5.6 mg .  Adverse events will be coded using the same version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) as used for the lead -in HONOR study  and will be summarized 
overall and by [CONTACT_82523] (SOC).  Adverse events will also be summarized 
by [CONTACT_11762].  Serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
drug will also be summarized. A dverse events that are ongoing in the 12-week open -label extension 
study  P303 or the lead-in double blind HONOR study will be transcribed into the eCRF.  All other 
adverse events that are reported after starting TNX -102 SL  in this extension study, or that worsen 
after entry into th is extension study, will be considered newly emergent AEs (NEAEs), even if the 
type of event was previously reported (and resolved) during either the HONOR study or the [ADDRESS_253840] results, vital sign measurements,  
depression status via the BDI -II and PTSD symptom status via the PCL -S, will be summarized at 
endpoint using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maxim um).  The number of

 patients with baseline and treatment -emergent suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior or self -
injurious behavior, based on the C -SSRS, will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
 
Efficacy Analyses : 
Descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_15449] w ill be displayed for:  
▪ Proportion of patients with a CGI -I score of “very much improved” or “much improved” 
from baseline  
▪ Change from baseline in the SDS  
▪ Change from baseline in patients’ quality of sleep score using the PROMIS Sleep 
Disturbance scale  
▪ Chan ge from baseline in BDI -II total score  
▪ Change from Visit  5 to Visit 6  in PCL -S total score  
 
Pharmacogenomic Analyses : 
Potential genetic determinants of treatment response will be examined by [CONTACT_211954]. A blood sample will be obtained from patients who have 
signed a separate informed consent form for the pharmacogen omic analys es.  The blood sample can 
be obtained  as soon as the patient has agreed to be tested and has signed the separate informed 
consent  form ; i.e., the blood draw is not tied to any specific study visit , hence it can be obtained at 
any time .   
 
The first step of the pharmacogenomic analyses will involve  exome sequencing and analysis for 
allelic polymorphisms related to treatment response to TNX -[ADDRESS_253841] OF FIGURES  ................. 8

Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_253849]  with daily bedtime dosing of TNX -102 SL 
5.6 mg (2 x 2.8mg tablets ) in patients with PTSD.  This study will be conducted at approximately 
35 sites in the [LOCATION_002] (US).  
Patients who have either : (a) completed  the double -blind lead -in study and complete , or are 
active (at the time of study discontinuation) in the  12-week open -label extension study , P303 ; or 
(b) are currently enrolled  in the double -blind lead -in study (HONOR study) that has been  
discont inued  due to results of an interim analysis , will be eligible.  For Track A  patients, t his 
extension study consists of 5 in-clinic visits, including the Screening/Baseline visit  and visits 
after 7, 16, 28 and 40 weeks of treatment (Visits 3-6).  There will also be a telephone visit after 
two weeks of treatment (Visit 2)  for patients enrolling from the double -blind lead -in study, 
P301/HONOR .  The total treatment duration of this study will be 40 weeks  for patients  enrolled  
under Track A criteria, and 52 weeks for patients enrolled under Track B criteria .  Therefore, the 
maximum total duration of continuous treatment with TNX -102 SL could be approximately 64 
weeks for those patients assigned to TNX -102 SL  in the lea d-in HONOR study  who then also 
completed the 12 -week open -label extension study  P303 .  
For patients  enrolling from the open -label extension study , P303,  there is no need to repeat 
assessments at Visit 1 for this study, if the patient enroll s and initiate s study treatment within 
fourteen days of completing the 12-week open -label e xtension  study  P303 .  For patients  who are 
active in the double -blind lead-in study, P301/HONOR , all Baseline procedures and assessments 
will be completed at Visit 1.  
After the patient has participated  in the lead -in HONOR  study  or the open -label extension study, 
P303,  and has consented to participate in this open -label extension stu dy, patients will be 
dispensed a 7-week supply of open -label TNX -102 SL tablets (3 bottles) and will be instructed to 
take 2 tablets of study drug sublingually daily at bedtime, starting on the evening of Visit 1.  A 
phone visit will be completed after 2 weeks of treatment for patients enrolling from the double -
blind lead-in study, P301/HONOR .  All  patients will return to the study center for safety and 
efficacy assessments at Weeks 7, 16, 28, and 40 (or early termination). Patients enrolled under 
Track B criteria will continue to dose for an additional [ADDRESS_253850] study visit at 
Week 52.   Patients will return their TNX -102 SL medication  (including empty bottles) at these 
visits .  Patients will also receive a 9-week  supply  of TNX -102 SL  (4 bottles) at the Week 7 visit, 
and a  12-week supply (5 bottles) at the Week  16, 28 and 40  (Week 40  for Track B  patients only ) 
visits.  Patients will be allowed to take other medications deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_211955], including currently approved PTSD 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  See  Section  8.[ADDRESS_253851] been currently enrolled  in a double -blind lead -in HONOR study when that study was 
discontinued  due to results  of an interim analysis . 
All patients  will be assigned to TNX -102 SL , 5.6 mg regardless of which treatment arm they 
were randomized to in the lead -in HONOR study.

 8. STUDY DRUG MATERIALS  AND MANAGEMENT  
8.1. Study Drug Packaging , and Labeling  and Storage  
The study medication bottles will be labeled minimally with the following information:  study 
number TNX -CY-P306 (P306) , sponsor name [CONTACT_3816], bottle number, drug name, quantity, 
storage conditions, usage instructions, and caution statement s for investigational new drug, i.e., 
Caution: New Drug L imited by [CONTACT_36974] , and Keep Out of 
Reach of Children  and Pets. 
Each study medication bottle will contain 40 tablets .  Since the patient will dose with two tablets 
sublingually each night, three bottles will be dis pensed  to each patient at Visit 1/ Baseline .  Four  
bottles will be dispensed at Week 7  and five bottles  at Week s 16, 28 and 40  (Week 40 for Track 
B patients only) ; this will provide the patient with enough study drug  between visits, plus 
additional tablets to cover loss and/or visit window variability.  The patient should be instructed 
to take all the tablets in one bottle before opening  another  bottle.  The patient should be 
instructed to keep this study medication i n a safe location out of extreme environmental 
conditions  and out of the reach of children  and pet s, and that this medication is not to be taken by 
[CONTACT_82534].  Each patient will also be instructed that they will be 
expecte d to return all bottles and all unused study medication at each clinic visit ; unused 
medication will be counted to assess compliance with study drug treatment.  
Storage of the study drug at the investigational site should be under locked and secure conditio ns 
with limited staff access.  Study drug should be stored at 20 -25°C/68 -77°F in a temperature/  
humidity -monitored r oom; however, brief excursion  (15-30°C/59 -86°F ) as defined in  the Study ’s 
Reference Manual ( IP Receipt and Storage ) is permitted  without sponsor’s approval . 
8.2. Dosing Instructions  
Patients will be instructed to take two (2) TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg tablets sublingually, placed 
simultaneously under the tongue , each evening at bedtime starting on evening of Day 0 and 
continuing without interruption for 40 to 52  weeks.  The study drug should be taken at bedtime 
after teeth brushing and other oral care  has been completed .  The mouth/sublingual area should 
be mois t at the time of dosing, so the patient should drink a few sips of water prior to dosing , 
especially if prone to dry mouth.  Patients will be instructed to place the two TNX -[ADDRESS_253856] disso lved.  They should not 
swallow, crush or chew the tablets .  Patients should not eat or drink (or chew gum) for at least 15 
minutes after dosing, and preferably not until morning.  Pati ents will be reminded that only two 
(2) tablets are allowed per day. Not e: In the event that the patient misses a dose, instruct the 
patient to continue dosing with two (2) tablet s the next evening ; i.e., they should not take more to 
make up for the missed dose.  
Patients should also be reminded to keep the desiccant in the bot tle after opening and to screw 
the cap on tightly after dosing.

 8.3. Dispensing Instructions  
Each enrolled patient will be assigned 3, 4 or 5 bottles of TNX -102 SL at each dispensing visit.  
Bottles of TNX -102 SL tablets are numbered and will be supplied to si tes as open stock.  Patients 
are remi nded to open and use one bottle of TNX -102 SL tablets at a time.  
8.4. Release of Clinical Study Supplies to the Investigator  
Tonix or Tonix’s designee’s standard operating procedures (SOP)  for releasing clinical trial 
supplies to the site will be followed.  
8.5. Concomitant Medications  
Many of the restrictions in the lead -in study related to concomitant medications and trauma -
focused  psychotherapy will be relaxed.  Therefore, patients may utilize antidepressants, mood 
stabilizers, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], stimulants, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], if needed , unless 
specifically excluded as outlined below .  Patients may take medications to help  them sleep, per 
the judgment of the investigator.  
Any concomitant medications or other treatments, including dietary supplements, must be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and case report form along with the indication, dose and 
dates of treatment .  
The following medications are specifically excluded during the study and patients must agree to 
refrain from use of these medications during the study:   
• Any other forms of cyclobenzaprine (FLEXERIL®, AMRIX®, FEXMID®, or generic 
equivalents) continue to  be specifically excluded during the study and patients must 
agree to refrain from use of these medications during the study.  
• Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (tranylcypromine, phenelzine, isocarboxazid, and 
selegiline )   
• Cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (stron g ones  only) (refer to Appendix  [ADDRESS_253857]).  
• St. John’s wort  
NOTE: Patients initiating treatment with antidepressants, tramadol or other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438],  triptans, or 
any other serotonergic medication should be cautioned about the possibility of serotonin 
syndrome which has been reported in patients receiving cyclobenzaprine with selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin –norepi[INVESTIGATOR_211941] (SNRIs) and other 
serotoninergic agents. (See Appendix  3, AMRIX® Package Insert, Warnings Section).  The 
patient should be instructe d to call the clinic immediately in the event of any of the warning 
signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome, as outlined in the informed consent.  The investigator 
should carefully review the patient’s complete list of medications when considering new 
treatments and the site should ask the patient to call the site (or return for an unscheduled clinic 
visit) within one week after adding a new serotonergic therapy (or increasing the dose of a prior 
treatment).

Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_253858] returned (based on the number 
of days since the previous visit).  The number of tablets dispensed, the number returned, and the 
number expected to be returned will be recorded in the patient’s record.  An assessment of 
medication adherence shoul d be done by [CONTACT_211959].  If it is found that the patient is not 
taking the study medication as prescribed, the patient will be re -counseled on c orrect 
administration, and this should be noted in the patients’ record, and discussed with the medical 
monitor, if necessary.   
If the patient fails to return all unused study drug as expected, the patient should be questioned 
regarding the reason for the lower than expected tablet number and about potential misuse, abuse 
or diversion.  In situations where more than 2 tablets per week cannot be accounted for, the 
investigator will be asked to evaluate the situation, and a written summary should be added to the 
source and entered onto the case report form ( CRF ).  In addition, the medical monitor should be

or damage to study drug).  Situations where replacement d rug is requested, or when more than [ADDRESS_253859] to the Sponsor’s drug distribution depot.  
Tonix or their designee will perform drug accountability which entails reconciliation between the 
amount of dr ug shipped to the study site, study drug assigned and dispensed to the patient 
(including returned unused assigned study drug), and study supplies that were never dispensed 
and/or assigned to patients.

 9. STUDY VISITS AND PRO CEDURES  
The overall and detailed  schedule for study procedures and visits is provided in Appendix  1. 
9.1. Visit 1  – Screening/Baseline (Week 0, Day 1)  
9.1.1.  Informed Consent  
Before the potenti al patient has undergone any study -related screening procedures, the nature of 
the study and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the patient, and the patient 
will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction.  After all questions are 
answered, but before proceeding further, the patient must read and sign a written informed 
consent form.  This signed informed consent form will be retained in the Investigator’s study 
file, and the date the patient signed the form  will be entered into the CRF.  The patient will be 
provided with a copy of his or her signed and dated informed consent form.  The patient will be 
required to sign all updated informed consents.  
Separate written, signed informed consent must be obtained i f the patient is to participate in the 
optional pharmacogenomic assessment.   
 
9.1.2.  Screening Overview  
The first study visit, Visit 1, will be where the study is explained to the prospective study patient, 
where written informed consent will be obtained and doc umented, and where protocol -specified 
study procedures and assessments will be completed.   
For patients enrolling into this study from the 12-week open label extension study , P303 , the 
P306 Baseline Visit (Visit 1) date is intended to be the same date as the  final visit of the 12 -week 
open label extension study , P303 .  However, if there are extenuating circumstances, Visit 1 of 
P306 may occur within fourteen days of their final visit in P303  without repeating baseline 
assessments .   If more than fourtee n days elapse between the final visit of P303  and start of the 
P306 study, medical monitor approval will be required and  baseline assessments will need to be 
repeated.    
For patients  enrolling directly from the double -blind lead -in study , P301 , all Visit 1  assessments 
will be performed.  These patients are also expected to enter the P306  study  at the same time as 
their final P301 visit ; however, if there are extenuating circumstances , then Visit 1 of P306 may 
occur within fourteen days of their final P301 v isit.    
Once the patient has provided written informed consent to participate and has met all relevant 
inclusion criteria, this patient is eligible to begin the open -label treatment period , starting at 
bedtime  on the day of enrollment .  The patient should be dispensed t hree bottles of TNX -102 SL 
tablets, along with dosing and storage instructions .  The end -of-study information collected at the 
final visit of the 12 -week open label extension  study  P303 , or the V isit 1 assessments completed 
as part of this protocol , will be considered  the baseline values for Study P30 6. 
9.1.3.  Patient  Numbering  
All patient s who participated in  the double -blind lead -in HONOR study  will retain their original 
concatenated 6-digit site-patie nt number , i.e., all patients entering P306 .

Version 5.0, 05 June 2019  Page 24 of 56 
 9.1.4.  Pharmacogenomic Assessment  
Patients should be offered the opportunity to participate in the pharmacogenomic assessment as 
soon as Protocol Amendment 01  has been approved and implemented at the clinical site.  The 
blood draw for this assessment is not tied to any specific visit ; instead , it should be obtained after 
the patient has reviewed and signed the separate pharmacogenomic testing informed consent 
form, irrespective of the visit at which the consent is signed .

9.6. Early Termination (ET)  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, patient s have the right to withdraw from the 
study at any time for any reason, and they will be advised of this ri ght.  The investigator and 
Tonix also have the right to remove patient s from the study.  Specific reasons for removal of a 
patient  from the study could include, but are not limited to:  
▪ An AE  
▪ An illness that, in the judgment of the investigator or Tonix, mi ght invalidate the 
study results or place the patient  at risk  
▪ The request of the patient , investigator, or Tonix, whether for administrative or other 
reasons  
▪ Pregnancy  
Patients who wish to terminate their participation in the study should be instructed to come to the 
clinic for an Early Termination Visit.  The purpose of the Early Termination visit is to obtain 
critical information about the patient’s participation, and should be scheduled preferably before 
there has been a substantial lapse in study medication usage.  However, even if there has been a 
medication lapse, the patient should be encouraged to return to the clinic for this visit, and should 
be instructed to re turn all remaining study medication.  
The following assessments and procedures are completed at this visit in the following general 
order:  
▪ Collect returned study medication from patient and perform drug accountability

Once these assessments have been  completed, the patient may be discharged from the study , 
provided there is no need for additional follow -up to continue to monitor an AE or other 
condition.  
9.7. Unscheduled Visits  
Patients may need to be seen at other times than the scheduled study visits for  additional safety 
assessments or to follow -up, as medically necessary, on clinical laboratory, physical 
examination, or other findings.  In addition, if a patient calls between scheduled visits to report a 
visible lesion in the oral cavity or other concer ning oral cavity AE, the patient should be asked to 
return to the clinic as soon as possible for an unsche duled oral cavity examination.   Unscheduled 
examinations are NOT required for reports of oral numbness, tingling, bitter taste, or for other  
mild or t ransient AEs that are not concerning to the patient.   If an additional study visit occurs, 
the date and nature of the visit will be documented in the CRF and in the source documents .  The

 10. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
10.1. Screening Assessments  
The results of the  screening  assessments should be reviewed to ensure that the patient continues 
to satisfy all entry criteria and otherwise remains a satisfactory patient for the extension study.  
Laboratory  assessments obtained at the final visit of the double -blind  lead-in HONOR study or 
the 12 -week open -label extension study P303 will not be available prior to the patient’s entry 
into the extension study,  but should be reviewed within 7  days when they become available , to 
ensure the patient’s ongoing well -being . 
10.2. Efficacy Assessments  
A secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term effect of TNX -[ADDRESS_253861] be administered by [CONTACT_211961].  Study specific training will be required before new staff 
that were not trained for the lead -in study are allowed to administer  these scales.  In an attempt to 
minimize variability in responses of a given patient over time, it is important that the same rater 
administer the scales to a given patient throughout the study  as much as possible .  It is also 
important that the assessmen ts, including those that are patient -completed, be conducted in the 
specified order, according to specific instructions, and in a setting where the patient has minimal 
distractions and sufficient time to complete them.  After completion of these assessment s, the 
study coordinator should review the responses for completeness with the patient.  
10.2.1.  Clinic al Global Impression of Improvement (CGI -I) 
The CGI -I is a commonly used clinician -rated scale designed to assess overall clinical 
improvement (change) since baseline .  The CGI -I will be completed at each in-clinic visit after 
baseline .  It will be the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_211942]’s overall status . 
10.2.2.  Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)  
The SDS scal e is a self -report questionnaire that was designed to assess the subject’s view of the 
degree to which symptoms have disrupted work, social life/ leisure activities, and family life/ 
home responsibilities during the past week.  In addition, the SDS asks th e subject to provide the 
number of days or work lost as well as unproductive days.   The SDS will be administered at each 
in-clinic visit . 
10.2.3.  PROMIS Sleep Disturbance Scale   
PROMIS refers to the Patient -Reported Outcome Measurement Informati on System 
(www.nihpromis.org), an NIH -funded initiative to develop instruments to be used across chronic 
conditions.  The PROMIS scale for sleep disturbance (form 8a) will be administered at all in-
clinic visits.

Version 5.0, 05 June 2019  Page 30 of 56 
 10.2.4.  Beck Depression Index (BDI -II) 
BDI-II refer s to the patient -rated assessments of depress ive symptomology .  The BDI -II will be 
administered at  all in-clinic visits.   Each patient’s response to the BDI suicidality question (item 
9) should be reviewed and compared to the C -SSRS responses to ensure careful assessment of 
any suicidal ideation  and resolution of any discrepancies  between the self -reported BDI -II and 
the C -SSRS interview . 
10.2.5.  PTSD Checklist -Specific Version (PCL -S) 
Developed by [CONTACT_211962], the PCL -S is a [ADDRESS_253862] as their Index Trauma during the lead -in double blind study (TNX -CY-P301). 
Respondents rate each item from 1 ("not at all") to 5 ("extremely") to indicate the degree to 
which they have been bothered by [CONTACT_211963].   
In addition,  the long -term safety of TNX -102 SL on PTSD based on PCL-S completed by 
[CONTACT_211964] 5 (Week 28) and Visit 6 (Week 40)  and Visit 7  (Week 52  for patients enrolled 
under Trac k B), is assessed with this scale . The mean change in PCL -S total score and PCL -S 
clusters scores from Visit 5 (Week 28) to Visit 6 (Week 40) , or to Visit [ADDRESS_253863] passed the Visit 4 (Week 16 time point, Visit 5 ( Week 28 ) is 
chosen as the “baseline” for PCL -S in order to capture the vast majority of the patients who 
enrolled in the study  from its beginning . 
10.3. Pharmacogen omics  Testing  
For pharmacogenomic analysis, a single blood draw collected in two PAXgene DNA tubes will 
be obtained from each patient after they have provided separate written, signed informe d consent 
for pharmacogenomic analysis.  The purpose of this testing is to allow exome sequencing and 
analysis for genetic variants related to treatment response to TNX -[ADDRESS_253864] the patien t’s 
eligibility for the main study. Pa tients  have  the right to stop participating at any time during the 
study or during the time of sample storage, and, if a pa tient decides to withdraw from the 
pharmacogenomics portion of this study, any remaining sample will be destroyed and not used 
for further resea rch.  Data collected before a p atient ’s withdrawal from the pharmacogenomics 
portion of this study will remain in the research database.  
10.4. Safety Parameters  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_76606], responses on the C -SSRS, clinical 
laborator y tests, examinations of the oral cavity, vital signs, weight, patient -rated assessments of 
depressive symptomology  (BDI -II) and PTSD symptomology (PCL -S).

 10.4.1.  Adverse Events (AEs )  
Patients will be monitored for AEs throughout the study, from the time the patient signs an 
informed consent onward.  AEs that are spontaneously reported, elicited or observed are to be 
recorded on the CRF with the date, time of onset, date and time of res olution, severity, 
seriousness, causality (relationship to study medication), actions required, and outcome.  
To elicit AEs, non -leading, simple questions with minimal connotations should be used as the 
initial questions at all evaluation points during the  study.  Examples of these questions can be:  
▪ How have you felt since your last visit?  
▪ Have you had any health problems since your last visit?  
If an AE occurs, the investigator will institute support and/or treatment as deemed appropriate.  
If a non -serious AE is unresolved on the last day of the study, an effort should be made to follow 
up until the AE is resolved or stabilized, the patient is l ost to follow -up, or there is some other 
resolution of the event.  
There are many symptoms associated with PTSD that can vary in intensity and frequency over 
time.  Only symptoms that significantly worsen or become more frequent, and in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_211943], should be reported as adverse event s.  
If a patient reports an oral adverse event  other than numbness, tingling or bitter taste , the 
Investigator should examine the oral cavity to confirm presence or absence of any  lesion or other 
abnormality,  and document the exam.  Additional details related to onset, duration, severity and 
reversibility of the oral  event will also be documented .  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS is a clinician -administered interview developed by [CONTACT_211965].  
This scale is intended to be administered by [CONTACT_211966].  The questions contained in the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale are 
suggested probes.  Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidal ideation or behavior 
depends on the judgment of the individual administering the scale.  
The “since last visit” version of the C -SSRS will be completed at all study visits.  Note that if 
there has been a significant change in responses to this scale indicative of increased suicide risk, 
appropriate intervention should be prescribed Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and an AE should be recorded.   
The patient’s response to BDI -II item 9 (suicidal ideation) should be reviewed prior to 
conducting the C -SSRS  at the in-clinic visits to ensure the patient’s responses are consistent 
between the BDI and the C -SSRS ( and/or the reason for any inconsistency documented in the 
patient’s chart).        
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety Planning Intervention (SPI)  
The C -SSRS is completed at every visi t in order to assess for changes in suicidality during the 
study.  If a patient scores a 4 or 5 on the Suicidal Ideation section of the C -SSRS at a clinic visit 
following enrollment, the patient should be withdrawn from the study and referred for 
appropria te emergency care.  A score of 4 or 5 should also result in the reporting of a SAE .   
Protocol No. TNX -CY-P306   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 5.0, 05 June 2019  Page 32 of 56 
 If a patient scores a 2 or 3 on the Suicidal Ideation section of the C -SSRS at any visit, the 
investigator should consider the implementation of  a Safety Planning Intervention (SPI).  The 
recommended SPI [INVESTIGATOR_211944], PhD and Gregory 
Brown, PhD which has been adopted by [CONTACT_211967]’s Administration (VA) (Stanley & 
Brown, 2012 ).  The VA SPI [CONTACT_832] a brief clinical intervention aimed at mitigating suicide risk.  It 
consists of a written, p rioritized list of copi[INVESTIGATOR_211945] a suicidal crisis.  Sites may use an internally -developed SPI [INVESTIGATOR_211946].  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Visual Examination of Oral Cavity  
A visual examina tion of the oral cavity should be done at Baseline /Visit 1  (or the Week 12 Visit 
of the 12 -week open label study ) and after 28 weeks (Visit 5) and 40 weeks (Visit 6) for Track A 
patients , or after 52 weeks of treatment (Visit 7) for Track B patients, and/o r at ET.  In addition 
to these regularly scheduled examinations, a visual inspection of the oral cavity (including the 
sublingual area) should be done any time a patient reports a  lesion or other finding in the  oral 
cavity other than  numbness, tingling or bitter taste , in order to document the presence or absence 
of any visible abnormalities .  Additional details related to onset, duration, severity and 
reversibility of oral events will also be documented in the CRF.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Signs  
Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], oral temperature, and weight) 
will be assessed at Visits 1 , 3, 4 , 5, 6 and 7 ( Visit 7 for Track B patients only) .  Height will be 
transferred from the lead-in study  database for BMI calculations (done at B aseline and Visit 6 for 
Track A patients or Visit 7 for Track B patients ).  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
The clinical laboratory evaluations to be performed in this study are listed in  Table  2.  All tests 
will be performed at Baseline /Visit 1  (or the Week 12 Visit of the 12 -week open label HONOR 
study ), after 28 weeks (Visit 5)  and after 40 weeks of treatment (Visit 6) for Track A patients , or 
after 5 2 weeks of treatment  (Visit 7) for Track B patients , or ET.  
With the exception of the urine pregnancy tests, all clinical laboratory evaluations will be 
analyzed via a central clinical laboratory, and information regarding appropriate sample volume, 
collection tubes, sample labeling and handling, and shipment will be provided in a study manual. 
Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality 
should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely 
to resolve.  If such abnorma lities do not return to normal within a reasonable period, their 
etiology should be identified and Tonix or designee should be notified.  Treatment -emergent 
clinically significant abnormalities in laboratory values will be recorded as AEs.

11. DEFINITIONS, RECORDI NG, AND REPORTING OF  ADVERSE 
EVENTS  AND PREGNANCY  
11.1. Definition of Adverse Events  
According to Inte rnational Council  on Harmoni sation (ICH) guidance E2A, Clinical Safety Data 
Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, an AE is any untoward 
medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient  administered a pharmaceutical  
product and which is not necessarily required to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory 
finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated  with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product . 
A newly -emergent adverse event  (NEAE ) is defined as any new AE that starts after the patient’s 
baseline visit for P306, or any ongoing  AE that was first repor ted during  the lead -in study  or 12 -
Protocol No. TNX -CY-P306   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 5.0, 05 June 2019  Page 34 of 56 
 week open -label extension study  and which  then exhibits  an increase in severity, frequency or 
relationship after the patient’s participation in P306 has begun .  NEAEs and “All AEs” will be 
tallied by [CONTACT_1196] ( SOC ) and preferred terms.  AEs that are ongoing at the time of 
the patient’s baseline visit  for P30 [ADDRESS_253865] medical terminolog y should be used in describing AEs.  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA )® will be used as the standard coding dictionary for AEs and in 
describing the patient’s medical history, and the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary will  be used to code concomitant medications.  Informal descriptions should be 
avoided.  
11.2.2.  Severity of Adverse Event  
AEs should be graded as mild, moderate, or severe using the following definitions.  
• Mild:  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and of minor irritant type 
causing no loss of time from normal activities.  Symptoms do not require therapy or a 
medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient.  
• Moderate:  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
participant and may  interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with 
functioning.  
• Severe: Events interrupt the participant’s normal daily activities and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating.  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious “and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided.  The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event 
(as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, maybe of 
relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache).  This is  not the same as 
“serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a patient's life or functioning.  Seriousness (not severity) serves as a 
guide for defining regulatory reporting obl igations.  
11.2.3.  Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the following 
descriptions.  
• Not Related:  This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is, another cause of 
the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is 
Protocol No. TNX -CY-P306   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 5.0, 05 June 2019  Page 35 of 56 
 inconsistent with the onset of the event and the administration of study drug and/or a 
causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
• Unlikely Related:  This category applies to an AE that could reasonably be considered 
caused by [CONTACT_6615], and where there is n o known or expected response pattern 
to the suspected study drug.  
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that follows a reasonable temporal 
sequence from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected 
response pattern to th e suspected study drug, but that could readily have been 
produced by a number of other factors.  
11.3. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Drug Reactions  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study,  or within 28 days after the patient’s last 
exposure to study drug , including a clinically significantly abnormal laboratory test result that is 
considered serious, must be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) so that Tonix may comply with 
regulatory obligations.  If the SAE is life -threatening or fat al, it must be reported to Tonix or its 
designee(s) immediately, by [CONTACT_166932].  For these and all other SAEs, an SAE report 
form must be completed and sent by [CONTACT_211968](s) within 24 
hours of the site’s initial awa reness of the event.  These requirements apply equally to all 
patients, regardless of the study phase or the at -risk patient’s treatment assignment.  
A serious adverse event (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any 
dose:  
• Resu lts in death,  
• Is life -threatening,  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or  
• Is an important medical event  
NOTE:  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Medical and sc ientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_211947].  These should 
also usually be considered serious.   Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospa sm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
A death occurring during the study  or reported to the Investigator after study participation (no 
required post -study time limit) mus t be reported to Tonix or its designee(s) immediately, whether 
or not it is considered treatment -related.  Initial SAE reports must be followed by [CONTACT_211969]. TNX -CY-P306   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_253866] Research Organization ( CRO ) will confirm via email or facsimile when 
it has received SAE documentation.   If such confirmation is not received at the site in a timely 
manner, it is then the responsibility of the site to contact [CONTACT_211970].   
The Investigator or other study personnel must immediat ely inform one of the Tonix Medical 
Monitors by [CONTACT_211971], as described 
above.  In addition, a completed SAE report form must be submitted to  
 within 24 hour s of the site’s initial awareness of the event.  
 
Contact [CONTACT_211972]:  
 
 
For questions pertaining to the reporting of SAEs or the completion of SAE documentation, 
site personnel should call the  
The investigator, or the sponsor or designee in the case of a central  Institutional Review Board  
(IRB), also must notify the Ethics Committee ( EC)/IRB of the  occurrence of the SAE, in writing, 
as soon as is practicable and in accordance with local law.  A copy of this notification must be 
provided to Tonix or its designee.  
In the event of an SAE that meets the criteria for expedited reporting, an Investigation al New 
Drug ( IND) Safety Report will be prepared for submission to the FDA.

 11.4. Pregnancy  
The active pharmaceutical ingredient  in TNX -102 SL 2.8 mg tablets is cyclobenzaprine HCl, 
which is in Pregnancy Category B (See Appendix  3 for AMRIX® Package Insert).  All 
pregnancies occurring during the study (after exposure to study drug) or within [ADDRESS_253867] be followed until  resolution (i. e., birth or voluntary or 
spontaneous termination of the pregnancy).  Any patient found to be pregnant at any time during 
the study will be withdrawn from the study immediately.  Any pregnancy outcome that meets the 
criteria for an SAE will be reported as an SAE.

 12. STATISTICS  
A description of any statistical analyses to be performed will be provided in a statistical analysis 
plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to database lock.     
12.1. Evaluation of Safety  
Safety data will be summarized as a single treatment group receiving 1 or more doses of TNX -
102 SL  (patients that have taken only 1 tablet of TNX -102 SL will be included) .   
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_211973], clinical laboratory tests, vital 
signs , visual examination o f the oral cavity findings, the monitoring of suicidality using the 
Columbia C -SSRS scale , and patient -rated assessments of depressive symptomology  (BDI -II) 
and PTSD symptomology (PCL -S). 
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA and will be  summarized overall and by [CONTACT_211974] . AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_11762]. SAEs and AEs 
leading to discontinuation of study drug will also be summarized.  
Actual values and changes from the extension study ba seline values  for clinical laboratory test 
results and vital sign measurements will be summarized at endpoint using descriptive statistics 
(n, mean, standard deviation ( SD), median, minimum, and maximum).  Laboratory values will be 
displayed in the data li stings  along with corresponding normal ranges , and those that are outside 
the normal range will be flagged .   
Based on the C -SSRS results, the frequency and severity of suicidal ideation and behavior will 
be tabulated at each time point.  The number of pat ients with baseline and treatment -emergent 
suicidal ideation and/or suicidal behavior or self -injurious behavior, based on the C -SSRS, will 
be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  
All data gathered will be listed by [CONTACT_211975], and clinically signific ant abnormalities 
should be recorded as AEs. AEs of special interest  indicating  potential abuse and dependency  
will be evaluated and summarized as described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
12.2. Evaluation of Efficacy  
As this is  a long -term safety study, minimal conclusions will be available concerning long -term 
efficacy. The efficacy analyses will focus on durability of the response achieved prior to entry into 
this extension study , based on the CGI -I for patients in Track A and for patients on active drug in 
the lead -in HONOR study or the P303 -early -terminated patients (due to IA results) who were on 
placebo in P301  in Track B . In addition, d urability of response for both Track A and B patients 
will be assessed by [CONTACT_211976] -S scores from Visit 5 ( Week 28 ) to Visit 6 ( Week 
40) in order to detect  any potential worsening in PTSD symptoms as a result of longer term use of 
TNX -102 SL 5.6 mg . For Track B patients, an additional Visit 7 (Week 52) PCL -S assessment 
with b e available for subset analysis of durability of response.  
12.3. Estimate of Sample Size  
No sample size calculations were made for this study as it is a follow -on, open -label study.  The 
sample size for this study will depend upon the number of patients who participate in  the lead -in

Version 5.0, 05 June 2019  Page 39 of 56 
 HONOR study, remain eligible for entry, and indicate willing ness to participate in th is extension 
study.  
12.4. Assessment of Demographic and Baseline Characteristics and 
Patient  Disposition  
For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Continuous variables 
will be summarized using descriptive  statis tics (n, mean, median, SD, minimum, and maximum).  
Demographic and baseline characteristic variables will be summarized  based on the data 
obtained at the screening visit from the lead -in HONOR study . The number of patients who 
enroll in the study an d the number and percentage of patients in each analysis population who 
complete the treatment period will be presented. The frequency and percentage of patients who 
withdraw from the study, along with the reason for withdrawal or discontinuation, will als o be 
summarized.

Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_253868] be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_82574]/IRB before the revised protocol can be implemented.  Emergency revisions that 
eliminate an apparent hazard to patients do not require preapproval by [CONTACT_1383]/IRB.  However, 
the EC/IRB must be notified, in  writing, as soon as possible after the modification has been 
made.  A copy of this communication must be forwarded to Tonix.  
13.2. Study Termination  
The study may be prematurely terminated at any time at the discretion of Tonix, its designee, or 
the principal i nvestigator.  Should premature termination be considered necessary, written 
notification documenting the reason for study termination will be provided, and specific 
procedures for termination will be arranged.  Circumstances that may warrant premature stud y 
termination include, but are not limited to, the following.  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients  
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate  
• Insufficient adherence to the requirements of the protocol  
• Insufficient  provision of complete and evaluable data  
• Plans to modify, suspend, or discontinue development of the study drug  
In the event that the study is terminated prematurely, all study materials must be returned to 
Tonix or its designee.  
Protocol No. TNX -CY-P306   CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 5.0, [ADDRESS_253869] of the Study  
This protocol is written in accordance with the principles established by [CONTACT_941] 18th World Medical 
Assembly General Assembly (Helsinki, 1964 CI) and amendments and clarifications adopted by 
[CONTACT_82575].  The invest igator will make sure that the study described in this 
protocol is conducted in full conformance with those principles, the protocol, current FDA 
regulations, ICH GCP guidelines, Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) guidelines, local ethical and 
regulatory requ irements, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, US applicable 
Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR)  (title 21), any EC requirements relative to clinical studies.   
As required by [CONTACT_55257], the study drug may not be shipped to any participating in vestigator 
until the requisite study documentation has been submitted to the IND.  
Should a conflict arise, the investigator will follow whichever law or guideline affords the 
greater protection to the individual patient.  The investigator will also make su re he or she is 
thoroughly familiar with the appropriate administration and potential risks of administration of 
the study drug, as described in this protocol and the Investigator’s Brochure, prior to the 
initiation of the study.  
14.2. Ethics Committee/Instituti onal Review Board (EC/IRB) Review  
The EC/IRB must be a properly constituted board or committee operating in accordance with 21 
CFR Part 56, “Institutional Review Boards.”  This protocol, any protocol amendments, the 
associated informed consent forms, and t he informed consent procedures must be submitted to 
the EC/IRB for review and approved before the enrollment of any patient into the trial.  
All types of patient recruitment or advertising information must be submitted to Tonix or its 
designee and to the EC /IRB for review and approval prior to implementation.  EC/IRB approval 
of any protocol amendments must be received before any of the changes outlined in the 
amendments are put into effect, except when the amendment has been enacted to eliminate a 
potential  hazard to study patients.  In such cases, the chair of the EC/IRB should be notified 
immediately and the amendment forwarded to the EC/IRB for review and approval.  
14.3. Written Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain signed writ ten informed consent from each 
potential study patient prior to the conduct of any screening or other study procedures.  This 
written informed consent will be obtained after the methods, objectives, and potential risks of the 
study have been fully explaine d to the potential patient.  The investigator must explain to each 
patient that he or she is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to withdraw from it at any 
time.  NOTE:  Patients on antidepressant therapy should be warned of a potential serious  drug 
interaction and should be advised to contact [CONTACT_82576], including fever, confusion or 
agitation, hallucinations, sweating, high or low blood pressure,  rapid heart rate, tremor, muscle 
rigidity or nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  
The method of obtaining and documenting informed consent and the contents of the ICF will 
comply with ICH  GCP guidelines, the requirements of 21 CFR Part 50, “Protection of Human 
Protocol No. TNX -CY-P306   CONFIDENTIAL

 Patient s,” the HIPAA regulations, and all other applicable regulatory requirements.  A properly 
executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_211977].  The original signe d and dated ICF will be kept on file 
at the study site.  Patients will be given a copy of the signed ICF and will be informed of any 
new developments during the course of the study that might influence their continued 
participation in the study.  
The investigator or a qualified designee will be available to answer each patient’s questions 
throughout the study, and all questions must be answered to the patient’s satisfaction.  If the 
protocol is amended and a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each patient’s further 
consent must be obtained.  The new version of the ICF must be approved by [CONTACT_1383], prior to 
subsequently obtaining each patient’s consent.  
Receipt of written informed consent will be documented in each patient’s or potential patient’s  
CRF.  The signed ICF must remain in each patient’s study file and must be available for 
verification by [CONTACT_82578].  
Separate written, signed informed consent must be obtained if the patient is to participate in the 
optional pharmacogenomi c assessment.

 15. DATA HANDLING AND RE CORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
15.1. Maintaining Privacy and Confidentiality  
In order to maintain patient  privacy, all CRFs, study drug accountability records, and other 
documents, including communications between the study site and Tonix, will id entify patient s 
only by [CONTACT_211978].  If required, the investigator 
will grant monitors and auditors from Tonix or its designee and/or regulatory authority’s access 
to patient s’ original medical records for  verification of the data gathered on the CRFs and to 
audit the data collection process.  Patient s’ confidentiality will be maintained and will not be 
made publicly available.  
Special Provisions for Confidentiali ty:  A Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) has been 
obtained from the FDA for the investigators to protect patient s enrolled in the study.  
Investigator s may use the Certificate to avoid being compelled to make "involuntary disclosure" 
(e.g., subpoenas, insurers, employers, or other third parties) of names and other identifying 
information about any individual who participates as a research patient  (i.e., about whom the 
investigator maintains identifying information) during any time the Certificate is in effect.  
15.2. Maintaining Essential Clinical Docume nts 
Study site files for the retention of regulatory documents will be established at the beginning of 
the study, maintained for the duration of the study, and retained according to FDA and ICH/GCP 
guidelines and applicable regulatory requirements.  The re cords maintained must be adequate to 
fully document appropriate protection of study patient s/patients, the validity of the study, the 
integrity of the data, and the manner in which the study was conducted.  
The investigator’s site file, copi[INVESTIGATOR_82512],  CRFs, originals of test result reports, drug 
disposition logs, correspondence, records of written informed consent, and other documents 
pertaining to the conduct of the study must be kept on file by [CONTACT_211979] [ADDRESS_253870] 2 years after clinical development of the study 
drug for the indication being studied has been discontinued.  After that period, the sponsor will 
be contact[CONTACT_211980], destroyed, 
or kept at the location of the designee or another facility for a longer period of time.

 15.3. Data Handling  
Unless otherwise specified, procedures, data collection and evaluati on will be conducted as per 
the SOPs of the CRO.  The investigator will assume the responsibility of ensuring the 
completeness and accuracy of the clinical data.   
All laboratory results will be analyzed by [CONTACT_211981].  
Clinical laboratory data will be transferred from the central laboratory to the clinical database 
maintained by [CONTACT_82582] 11 -compliant.  
The responsible clinical study monitor(s) will check data at the monit oring visits to the clinical 
study site.  The investigator will ensure that the data collected are accurate, complete, and 
legible.  Any changes made to the clinical data will be documented with a full audit trail.  
Aspects of the clinical and statistical p hases of the study, including all associated documentation 
may be reviewed by [CONTACT_82583] a 
risk-assessment approach.  The final clinical and statistical report will be audited to ensure that, 
as far as can be reasonably established, the methods described and the results reported accurately 
reflect the raw data generated during the study.  
15.4. Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histori es 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study patient.  
Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by [CONTACT_82584].  Data (including AEs) will be 
recorded on raw data sheets and/or electronic or paper sour ce documents.  
If selected data is collected via paper (patient questionnaires, etc.), the data must be entered into 
the eCRF and verified that it has been transcribed correctly.  
15.5. Screening Records  
A record must be kept of all patient s considered for the stu dy who sign informed consent and 
who began any screening procedures.  The information should include the patient ’ initials, 
unique patient  identification numbers, whether they passed or failed screening, and, if they 
failed, the reason for screen failure.  
15.6. Clinical Laboratory Certification  
A central clinical laboratory will be used to analyze all samples in this study, with the exception 
of the urine pregnancy test and ad hoc urine drug screens.  The investigator must maintain, on 
file, written evidence that  the central clinical laboratory to be used is certified under the Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Act or equivalent certification (depending on local regulations).  
Further, the investigator will maintain a copy of the certification, the range of normal v alues, the 
effective dates for the ranges, and the units of measurement for all laboratory tests requested in 
the protocol.  If any of the laboratory measurements will be transformed and/or categorized in 
any way, a description of the procedures(s) used sh ould be included.  The investigator is

 15.7. Site Monitoring and Tonix’s Right to Review Records  
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_82585]/or its designee will be imple mented 
to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP and GLP guidelines.  
Tonix’s designated representative (the monitor or auditor) will contact [CONTACT_211982].  The monitor will be expected and allowed to veri fy the 
investigator’s qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, 
including proof of EC/IRB review, with the stipulation that patient confidentiality will be 
maintained in accordance with local and federal regulations , including HIPAA requirements.  
The monitor will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting 
CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data.  CRFs will be checked for 
accuracy, completeness, and clarit y and will be cross -checked for consistency with source 
documents, including laboratory test reports and other patient records.  Instances of missing or 
uninterpretable data will be resolved in coordination with the investigator.  
The monitor/auditor will a lso investigate any questions concerning adherence to regulatory 
requirements.  Any administrative concerns will be clarified and followed.  The monitor will 
maintain contact [CONTACT_35716] e -
mail, telephone, facsimile, and mail.  The investigator and all other site personnel agree to 
cooperate fully with the monitor and will work in good faith with the monitor to resolve any and 
all questions raised and difficulties detected by [CONTACT_2037].  
15.8. Audits and Inspections  
The investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the EC/IRB, and/or Tonix or their 
designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study documentation 
for on -site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the study to at least [ADDRESS_253871] make sure that each patient ’s anonymity is maintained.  On CRFs or other 
documents submitted to Tonix or its agent, patient  should not be identified by [CONTACT_2249], but 
rather by [CONTACT_82587].  The investigator should 
keep a separate record of the patient  initials, randomization cod es, patient  names, address, and 
contact [CONTACT_3031].  Documents that contain the names associated with these initials and codes 
are not for submission to Tonix or its agents (e.g., written informed consent forms).  These 
records should be maintained by [CONTACT_211983], Tonix, or its agents.  These records should 
be kept in compliance with HIPAA regulations.  
Special Provisions for Confidentiality:  In addition, a Certificate of Confidentiality ( CoC) has 
been  obtained from the FDA for the investigators to protect patient s enroll ed in the study.  
Investigators can use the Certificate to avoid being compelled to make "involuntary disclosure" 
(e.g., subpoenas, insurer s, employers, or other third parties) of names and other identifying 
information about any individual who participates as a research patient  (i.e., about whom the 
investigator maintains identifying information) during any time the Certificate is in effect.  
16.2. Confidentiality of Study Information  
All information relevant to this study, whether supplied by [CONTACT_211984], is privileged and confidential.  The 
investigator agrees to  use this information to carry out the study and will not use it for other 
purposes without written consent from Tonix.  It is understood that the investigator is under 
obligation to provide Tonix with all data obtained during the study.  The information o btained 
from this study will be used by [CONTACT_82590], other investigators, 
corporate partners, or consultants as required.  
16.3. Publication o f Data and Protection of Trade Secrets  
No presentations, abstracts (including meeting abstracts), or other publications based on the 
conduct or results of this study will be permitted without the express written permission of Tonix 
or its designated agent.   All such presentations or publications will proceed only as 
collaborations between Tonix and the investigators.  
If the investigator wishes to publish the results of this study, a copy of the proposed manuscript 
or abstract (including meeting abstracts) w ill be provided to Tonix or its designee for review, 
revision, and approval at least sixty (60) days before the expected date of submission for 
publication, unless otherwise arranged with Tonix in writing.  This will enable Tonix to protect 
its proprietary  information and augment the publication with insights or information of which the 
investigator may not be aware.  
Patient  names and other identifiers, such as photographs or audio or video recordings, may not 
be disclosed in any publication or public forum  without prior written authorization from the

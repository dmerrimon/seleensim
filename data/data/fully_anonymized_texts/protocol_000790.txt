Section C:  Background Information
     Scoliosis is a disease that involves lateral and/or rotational deformity of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_370574] 4% of the
population. T ypi[INVESTIGATOR_897] , surgery is considered when Cobb's angle, which is a measurement used for evaluation of curves in
scoliosis on an anterior-posterior radiographic projection of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], is greater than 50 degrees in the thoracic region (40
degrees in the lumbar region) or when the curvature causes significant pain, or respi[INVESTIGATOR_370575].
Patient undergoing this surgical correction experience severe pain in the postoperative period and the management
includes the use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-based patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). 
  
Methadone is an opi[INVESTIGATOR_370576]-life and has been used as an ef fective analgesic for acute,
chronic, neuropathic, and cancer pain in adults, children, and even neonates1-5. Its long duration of action and
antagonism to the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor may decrease the need for PCA use in the postoperative period.
Gourlay2 demonstrated the ef fectiveness and utility of perioperative methadone including the advantages of longer
analgesia with no serious side ef fects of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]. A recent study by [CONTACT_370602]2 in adult patients

F2.  Procedure
     The perioperative management of patients will be in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_370584] T exas Children¿s
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. Before surgery , patients will be asked to rate their baseline pain using a verbal rating scale from [ADDRESS_463751] 30 days will be
collected. 
 
Muscle spasms after scoliosis surgery are a common cause of postoperative pain. Our current practice is to provide oral or
IV diazepam to treat muscle spasms. Many patients who undergo scoliosis repair receive pre-operatively oral diazepam or
midazolam for anxiolysis. In order to prevent introducing a confounding factor in the evaluation of postoperative pain
scores in the recovery period, the protocol will require all patients to receive the same preoperative medication (oral
diazepam). After intravenous access, endotracheal intubation will be facilitated with additional bolus of propofol 1-3 mg/kg
or succinylcholine 1-2 mg/kg at the discretion of the intra-operative anesthesiologist. According to the randomization plan,
after intubation, the control group will receive a 20 ml normal saline placebo infusion over 10 minutes, while the treatment
group will receive 0.2 mg/kg methadone diluted to a [ADDRESS_463752] TCH practices for neuromonitoring (somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) and motor evoked
potentials (MEPs) with propofol 75 - 200 mcg/kg/min and sufentanil 0.2 ¿ 0.5 mcg/kg/hour , adjusting the doses to achieve
a targeted bispectral index level of 40-60. Nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_370585]-operative anesthesiologist. The sufentanil and propofol infusion will be turned of f when the second rod is placed
and after the final SSEPs, MEPs are obtained. Anesthesia will be maintained with inhalational agent until the end of the
surgical procedure. At the end of surgical procedure, residual neuromuscular blockade will be antagonized and the trachea
extubated in the operating room when the Anesthesiologist decides it is safe. The patient will then be transferred to the
post anesthesia recovery room (P ACU). Both the intra-operative anesthesiologist and the researcher staf f gathering the
PACU pain scores and use of PCA will be blinded to the medication. 
 
Postoperative Analgesia All groups: In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_370586], supplemental oxygen will be available for oxygen
saturations less than 94% during spontaneous ventilation. All patients will be monitored with continuous pulse oximetry as
in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_370587]. Every patient will have a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) morphine pump with a basal
rate infusion of 0.01 mg/kg/hour , a demand dose 0.02 mg/kg with a lockout time of 10 minutes to be started in the P ACU
once the patient emerges from the anesthetic. The patient will be administered diazepam 0.05 mg/kg IV or oral with
maximum of 5 mg every 6 hours as needed for muscle spasms in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_370586]. On POD 1, the basal rate
of morphine will be discontinued and ketorolac 0.5 mg/kg every 6 hours initiated in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_370588]. On POD
3, the patient will be transitioned from the PCA with scheduled oral hydrocodone/acetaminophen at a dosage of 0.135
mg/kg of hydrocodone with a maximum of 15 mg every 4 hours in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_370586]. The PCA will be available
for use during the transition for breakthrough pain. 
 
Postoperatively , patients will be asked to rate their pain using a validated pain scale (a verbal rating scale where 0 = no
pain and 10 = worse pain ever) by a blinded research staf f member . These pain scores will be collected at [ADDRESS_463753] and during activity by [CONTACT_370604]. The cumulative intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_370589] 24, 48, and 72 hour will be recorded. The cumulative
breakthrough intravenous opi[INVESTIGATOR_370590]. The level of
sedation will be determined using the University of Michigan Sedation Scale. In addition, complications such as the
incidence of hypotension (defined as mean arterial blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg), the need for vasopressors, the
incidence of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341] (defined as a respi[INVESTIGATOR_71564] [ADDRESS_463754], or the
need for naloxone), the incidence of hypoxemia or desaturation (defined as oxygen saturation [Sao2] less than 90% or the
need for a supplemental oxygen to maintain Sao2 greater than 94%), the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias, and the
incidence of nausea and vomiting including the treatment of side ef fects will be also recorded. Upon discharge from the
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], the patients will be asked to keep a diary consisting of daily opi[INVESTIGATOR_16444], epi[INVESTIGATOR_370591], daily
activity level, and satisfation scores. As part of standard routine post-surgical followup in the orthopedic clinic, information
is collected from the patients which consist of questionnaires regarding pain scores, functional status, activity level, and
quality of life. The research team will collect this information at 3 months and 6 months postoperatively .
 
Section G:  Sample Size/Data Analysis
G1.  Sample Size
How many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?
12/28/2020 Human Protocol Report
https://brain.bcm.edu/esp1/reports/Human/Protocol.asp?protocol=403715 6/10     Local: 98              W orldwide: 98
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:
     The sample size was based on the assumption that opi[INVESTIGATOR_14048] 3 days in the placebo group would be similar to
that in a previously published study of the same patient population undergoing spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477] (mean 275 mg SD 75 mg). A
group size of 28 would be required for an 80% power of detecting a 30% reduction in opi[INVESTIGATOR_370592] 275 to 200 mg at the
0.05 level of significance. Allowing for a 50% dropout rate for incomplete data, we will recruit 49 patients in each group for
a total of 98 subjects.
G2.  Data Analysis
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan (e.g. comparison of means,
comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). Which is the PRIMAR Y comparison/analysis? How will the
analyses proposed relate to the primary purposes of your study?
     The primary endpoint of the study is the morphine consumption during the first [ADDRESS_463755] examined for a normal distribution by [CONTACT_144407][INVESTIGATOR_2152] ¿ Wilk test. The
outcome variables between the two groups will be compared with Student¿s t-test where appropriate, for normally
distributed continuous data or by [CONTACT_370605]. It is anticipated that the
distribution of pain scores will not be normal and that non-parametric tests will be required. Categorical data including
patient gender , ASA physical status, incidence of side ef fects (respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], need for oxygen beyond the first 2
hours, nausea and vomiting) will be compared by [CONTACT_3493]¿s exact test Analysis of variance for repeated measures will be
performed to compare dif ferences in pain scores between the treatment groups with time. Data will be presented as mean,
standard deviation, median values or numbers (percentages). P values less than 0.[ADDRESS_463756] postoperative pain after spi[INVESTIGATOR_79477] (e.g., age, gender ,
ASA physical status, duration of surgery , intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_370593], time of the P ACU stay , mean and peak pain
scores and recorded opi[INVESTIGATOR_370594] P ACU before discharge). Failure to show a dif ference in these factors may
suggest that the missing data can be considered to be missing at random.
 
Section H:  Potential Risks/Discomforts
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or other) and assess the likelihood
and seriousness of such risks:

possible that there will be no benefits from participating in the study .
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.
     Data from this study can be used to determine if methadone provides better pain control in the perioperative setting.
Knowledge obtained from this study may allow anesthesiologists from other institutions caring for children and adolescents
undergoing similar painful procedures to use this medication to reduce pain.
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk-to-benefit ratio.
     The risks in this study do not vary from the risks of standard practices at TCH for children undergoing multi-level thoraco-
lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_370599]. The additional minor risk of an unlikely loss of privacy is outweighed by [CONTACT_370607].

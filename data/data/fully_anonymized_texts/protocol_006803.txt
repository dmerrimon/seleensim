Summary/Purpose/Rationale 
 
Multimodal pharmacologic therapy is a mainstay of postoperative analgesia for patients 
undergoing cardiothoracic surgery involving sternotomy. Diligent control of postoperative pain 
for patients following cardiac surgery is essential for promoting early mobilization and improved 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_104899], as well as decreasing the incidence of delirium, myocardial oxygen 
demand, and risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_23181]1. Emerging evidence suggests that pain after 
cardiothoracic surgery falls into four distinct trajectories, with over 50% of patients reporting 
moderate to high pain even on the 30th postoperative day2. Several regional anesthesia 
procedures have demonstrated improvement in postoperative pain after median sternotomy but 
remain underutilized3,4. 
 
While thoracic epi[INVESTIGATOR_104900], there are notable concerns involving systemic heparinization following epi[INVESTIGATOR_104901], with potentially catastrophic neurologic 
sequelae, as well as one of the more common side effects of hypotension from sympathetic 
blockade, which can be deleterious for cardiac patients in the immediate postoperative period5,6. 
For these reasons, the field of regional anesthesia has progressed to investigating more peripheral 
targets for nerve blockade that are distant from the neuraxis and more targeted to the specific 
drivers of surgical pain. Fascial Plane Blocks (FPB) have become a common approach to 
blocking afferent sensory innervation of the chest wall for patients undergoing cardiothoracic 
surgery involving sternotomy, including Pectoral (PECS) blocks, Serratus Anterior Plane (SAP) 
blocks, and Erector Spi[INVESTIGATOR_104902] (ESP) blocks4,7. The Pecto-Intercostal Fascial Block (PI[INVESTIGATOR_14049]) is 
one such approach that anesthetizes the anterior cutaneous branches of the second through the 
sixth intercostal nerves, which innervate the sternum and overlying soft tissue, by [CONTACT_104939]. 
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_104903], 
postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], time to extubation, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, 
and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients following cardiac 
surgery8,9. 
Ver 09/11/2023 Perineural adjuvants are commonly used in peripheral nerve blocks (PNB) to extend the duration 
of analgesia, but they remain relatively understudied in FPB. Specifically, the glucocorticoid 
steroid dexamethasone, alpha-[ADDRESS_116587] bupi[INVESTIGATOR_104904]. The primary outcome will be the 24 hour area under 
the curve (AUC) pain scores, based on patient-reported dynamic NRS pain scores with incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (IS) use measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after block placement in patients that are 
extubated. We set a minimally clinical important difference (MCID) to be 10% for AUC pain 
scores with IS use. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported NRS pain scores at rest at 
6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after block placement; cumulative 24 hour opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]; time to 
first postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_104905]; time to extubation; duration of ICU 
admission; incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_104906] 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours after block placement; 
Ver 09/11/2023 nausea incidence; vomiting incidence; postoperative delirium incidence; and patient-reported 
NRS satisfaction with the analgesic regimen.  
 
Risks to Subjects 
The PI[INVESTIGATOR_104907] a safe block, given its superficial target plane between the 
pectoralis major and internal intercostal muscles. Although the intended location is not 
intrathoracic, but rather, superficial to it, the relative proximity to the parietal pleura makes 
pneumothorax a potential risk of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_14049]. The transversus thoracis muscle is deep to the 
intended fascial plane and constitutes a safe “backstop” in case of needle advancement farther 
than intended, before arriving at the parietal pleura. The presence of the internal mammary 
arteries and veins, which reside in the deeper plane between the internal intercostal and 
transversus thoracis muscles, are also theoretically potentially at risk of needle puncture, 
although they are easily visualized and avoided during PI[INVESTIGATOR_104908]. Another FPB that 
similarly targets the anterior cutaneous branches of the upper intercostal nerves, called the 
Transversus Thoracis Plane (TTP) block, entails advancing the needle to this deeper plane, 
where the internal mammary vessels lie. Given the intrathoracic location of this deeper block, 
and attendant risks of pneumothorax and internal mammary vessel injury, our institution has 
opted to avoid TTP block placement, in favor of the PI[INVESTIGATOR_14049], as the latter is generally regarded as a 
safer block. To date, there have been no incidences at our institution or in the literature of any 
identified pneumothorax or internal mammary vessel injury occurring as a result of PI[INVESTIGATOR_104909]. 
 
The risks will be minimized by [CONTACT_104940], real-time, in-plane ultrasound guidance of our 
echogenic block needles only after identifying the correct anatomy, using color Doppler function 
on our ultrasound machine as appropriate to more readily identify vascular structures and avoid 
them. Blocks will be performed by [CONTACT_104941][INVESTIGATOR_14049], or 
by [CONTACT_104942]. 
 
The use of local anesthetics always bodes a potential risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity 
(LAST) as a result of systemic uptake from intravascular injection, rapid vascular absorption, or 
overdose of local anesthetic solution. We employ a multifaceted approach to minimize the risk of 
LAST by [CONTACT_104943]’s weight during the 
regional timeout procedure, using epi[INVESTIGATOR_104910] 3mg/kg for bupi[INVESTIGATOR_21153], and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_104911], 
including before any injection of local anesthetic solution, and in between each aliquot of 5cc of 
local before proceeding with dosing. This study has an exclusion criterion such that minimum 
body weight must be above 50kg for inclusion, so that no patients in whom the prescribed local 
anesthetic dose would be higher than the recommended upper limit of bupi[INVESTIGATOR_104912], as detailed below.

Design 
This will be a randomized, triple-blinded, prospective, feasibility trial that will take place after 
approval from our Institutional Review Board. Investigational New Drug Exemption has been 
obtained  from the US Food and Drug Administration for use of the perineural adjuvants and is 
filed as FDA IND Exemption 165506. Written informed consent will be obtained from all study 
participants prior to randomization.  This trial has been registered  on www.clinicaltrials.gov as 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. 
 
Selection Criteria 
Inclusion: Adults between [ADDRESS_116588] consented to participate and 
lack any contraindications to PI[INVESTIGATOR_104913].  
 
Exclusion: Patients with any contraindications to regional anesthesia, such as history of allergy 
to amide local anesthetics or any of the perineural adjuvants; existing neurologic deficit in the 
chest wall; remaining intubated at the six hour point after block placement; weight under 50kg; 
undergoing emergency surgical procedures or urgent return to the operating room; active 
endocarditis or mediastinitis;  moderate to severe right ventricular function before or after 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_6476] ; reliance on mechanical circulatory support devices, such as intra-aortic 
balloon pump or Impella; reliance on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; localized or 
systemic infection; chronic use of high dose opi[INVESTIGATOR_2467] (defined as daily use greater than 
30 oral morphine milligram equivalents (OMME) for over one month prior to surgery); as well 
as those who are pregnant, will be excluded from participation. Intraoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_104914], therefore patients who receive any other opi[INVESTIGATOR_104915]. 
Additionally, any administration of ketamine, methadone, and dexmedetomidine during 
intraoperative and postoperative settings will exclude the subjects from the study. Furthermore, 
postoperative administration of tramadol, NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and Haldol will exclude the 
subjects from the study. Any patients who refuse enrollment or withdraw their consent will also 
be excluded and any of their information already collected will be destroyed. 
 
Setting 
Patients between [ADDRESS_116589] is shown, the 
consent will be emailed to them for review prior to their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_104916].  Those subjects will then be seen on the morning of surgery to obtain a 
written informed consent. All patients will be provided with a signed copy of their written 
informed consent for their records.

Study Protocol  
 
Baseline data collection 
After time of consent, enrolled patients will be informed on the appropriate use of an incentive 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (IS), asked to rate their baseline verbal pain score both at rest and with use of an 
incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007] (IS) on the eleven-point numerical rating scale (NRS: 0-10, where [ADDRESS_116590] imaginable pain). Maximum effort IS volumes 
will be measured in triplicate and averaged, and patient characteristics will be recorded, 
including age, gender, height, weight, BMI, ASA physical status classification score, surgeon, 
planned surgical procedure, as well as preoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_104917]. 
 
Randomization 
Subjects will be randomized on the day of surgery, specifically prior to the start of their 
procedure. Surgery will proceed as scheduled, and patients will be anesthetized and monitored 
per our usual cardiac anesthesiology practice with general anesthesia. At the end of the 
cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_104944], patients will be reassessed for the aforementioned exclusion 
criteria before the randomized block is placed.  Patients will be blinded to their treatment arm 
assignment, as will all research personnel who be responsible for collection of outcome data, as 
well as the surgeons performing the cardiac procedure, and the critical care staff caring for the 
patients in the postoperative period. PI[INVESTIGATOR_104918]. For patients who are randomized at enrollment 
but later excluded due to exclusion criteria prior to block placement, their randomization 
assignment will be replaced at the end of the initial recruitment. 
 
Interventions 
Once the surgical team is finished with skin closure, bilateral PI[INVESTIGATOR_104919] a faculty 
anesthesiologist well-versed in the performance of ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia and 
performance of PI[INVESTIGATOR_104920], or by a trained anesthesia resident or fellow directly supervised by 
[CONTACT_476]. This will be done by [CONTACT_19201] a longitudinal, parasagittal view of the costal cartilage 1-
2cm lateral to the sternum at the level of the fourth or fifth rib and guiding a block needle in the 
cephalad direction in plane to the fascial plane between Pectus Major and Internal Intercostal 
muscles, with the goal of obtaining cephalad spread along the plane over multiple costal cartilage 
levels, as described previously23. PI[INVESTIGATOR_104921] a volume of 30cc of 
local anesthetic solution per side, with dosing in 5cc aliquots only after confirming aspi[INVESTIGATOR_104922] a small aliquot of local solution demonstrates spread in the intended 
plane. We will repeat aspi[INVESTIGATOR_104923] 5cc of local anesthetic, as is our 
standard practice, to monitor for intravascular needle position.  
 
Patients randomized to the control arm will receive bilateral PI[INVESTIGATOR_104924] a total of 60cc of 0.25% 
bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 2.5mcg/cc epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (1:400,000 dilution), and those in the experimental arm 
will receive bilateral PI[INVESTIGATOR_104924] a total of 60cc of 0.25% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_72160] 2.5mcg/cc epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 
(1:400,000 dilution), 1.67mcg/cc clonidine, and 0.1mg/cc preservative-free dexamethasone. 
Ver 09/11/[ADDRESS_116591] as-needed doses 
of oxycodone and/or hydromorphone ordered for analgesia after extubation, unless they have a 
contraindication or allergy, in which case a suitable alternative at equianalgesic doses will be 
ordered. 
 
Materials  
Ultrasound guidance for imaging the relevant anatomy will be obtained using a linear ultrasound 
probe. All PI[INVESTIGATOR_104925] a sterile manner, using sterile gloves, sterile ultrasound 
probe cover, sterile short-bevel block needle, and skin cleaning using an aseptic cleaning 
solution prior to placement. All products used are FDA-approved for the above-mentioned 
procedures, and an Investigational New Drug (IND) exemption has been obtained for use of the 
study medications used in this protocol under FDA IND165506. 
 
Measurements 
The time of block placement will be documented as the zero hour time point for the purposes of 
measurements. As described above, to collect data for the primary outcome, research staff will 
elicit patient-reported NRS pain scores with use of incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_91398] 6, 12, 18, and [ADDRESS_116592] data for secondary 
outcome measures including, but not limited to: eliciting resting NRS pain scores at 6, 12, 18, 
and 24 hours after block placement; measuring incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_104926] 6, 
12, 18, and 24 hours; measuring the time after extubation to first opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499]; time to 
extubation; duration of ICU admission; calculating incidence of nausea and vomiting based on 
the administration of the antiemetics ondansetron, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine , and 
promethazine; assessing delirium based on bedside ICU nurse documentation using Confusion 
Assessment Method in the ICU (CAM-ICU) in the first [ADDRESS_116593] block placement; and 
measuring patient-reported NRS satisfaction with the analgesic regimen at the 24 hour point (0 
represents completely unsatisfied and 10 represents completely satisfied). 
 
For the NRS pain scores and measurement of incentive spi[INVESTIGATOR_104927] 6, 12, 18, and 
24 hours interval, there is a grace period of 1 hour. This is to give the research staff/ ICU nurse 
the flexibility of completing these tasks.

Statistical Analysis  
 
Power Analysis  
We define a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) to be a 10% reduction in area 
under the curve for our primary outcome. Given that no current data exist on the anticipated 
duration of PI[INVESTIGATOR_104930], we have decided to recruit [ADDRESS_116595] 
deviations of the overall integrated area under the curve using the trapezoid rule. For secondary 
outcomes with continuous variables, such as intubation or ICU duration, t-tests and confidence 
intervals will be calculated. For continuous variables with serial measurements, repeated 
measure analysis of variance (RMANOVA) will be used. Further assistance with statistical 
analysis is being elicited from the Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), and this 
IRB protocol will be updated with further details after final review with a statistician. 
 
Missing Data Points 
Missing data points for the primary outcome will be imputed by a mixed effects modeling 
framework that allows us to use all available data points to tests hypotheses about differences 
between the two groups at each time point. Models will be implanted using the ‘lme4’ package 
in R statistical software. 
 
 
Human Subjects Protection 
 
Subject Recruitment Methods  
Potential candidates for the study will be identified based on the posting for the surgical 
procedure of cardiac surgery involving sternotomy as mentioned in the inclusion criteria as 
above, provided they lack any of the exclusion criteria. Patients will be approached during their 
preoperative assessment clinic visit, via telephone call, or during their inpatient admission if they 
are scheduled for surgery the following day, and told about the study in detail, including any 
known or possible risks, benefits, and alternatives. They will be advised there will be no

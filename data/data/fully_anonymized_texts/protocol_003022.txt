DY OVERVIEW  
Dry eye is a multifactorial chronic condition reducing quality of life by [CONTACT_835651] . Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69177], a n FDA approved thermal pulsation t reatment device, was 
designed to treat MGD related lipid deficiency evaporative dry eye. In previous s tudies, 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835635]. However, many 
studies were limited in that the subject receiving treatment was aware of the difference 
and could potentially introduce bias for the newer technology . The current study aims to 
investigate the efficacy of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835636] a simulated placebo treatment . The 
impact on  ocular health and perceived symptoms will also be evaluated.

 RATIONALE AND SIGNIFICANCE : Meibomian gland dysfunction is a common 
condition in clinical practice coinciding with reduced tear film stability and patient complaints of dryness and irritation. The number of therapeutic devices and clinical trials focused on this complex  issue are growing. Although many clinical trials show the 
increased efficacy of thermal pulsation treatment options compared to traditional therapy , subjects in all of these studies were aware of the treatment they were 
undergoing; thus, the possibility f or subject bias was high.   
 STUDY AIM : The current study aims to systematically investigate the efficacy of Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835637]. This study will compare a single 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835638] a single simulated placebo treatment in the same patient to mask 
subjects from any potential bias for newer technology.  
 STUDY DESIGN  
The study is a prospective, clinical trial , comparing the difference in results between 
Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835639] a placebo control  (subject masked to treatment) , and also comparing 
treatment versus no treatment between eyes  (subject not masked to treatment) . 
There will be 4 study visits in this investigation, an initial screening visit, a placebo 
treatment visit, a Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835640]/assessment visit (in that order).  
Potential subjects will be called and administered a telephone screener for dry eye symptoms, medical and ocular history to exclude those with previous ocular surgery, etc., before being scheduled for Visit 1. If eligible based on the telephone screener, time and day of visit schedule will be discussed with subject to make an effort to keep appointments at the same time of day, and all visits will be tentatively scheduled for the subject. Visit [ADDRESS_1160182] POPULATION 
Up to 16 adults with meibomian gland dysfunction and symptoms of dry eye disease wi ll 
be enrolled in this study. The minimum sample size requirement based on sample size 
calculations is 14  subjects.

Equipment : 
1. Slit lamp biomicroscope.  
a. A microscope with a bright light and magnification that can be used to take a close look at the structures of the eye. The binocular aspect provides a stereoscopic view of the eye structures.  
2. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835645]  (v. 2020 -JAN- 27)   
 Page 6 of 7 a. The Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835646] a non- invasive device that can capture digital images of 
interferometric observations of the tear film and of the meibomian glands 
under near -infrare d illumination. It can measure the absolute thickness of 
the tear film lipid layer. It will also be used to image glands to determine 
the level of obstructed glands, gland loss, and potential for benefit from thermal pulsation treatment.  
3. Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835647]  
a. The Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_69189] a device used for applying localized heat and pressure in adult patients with conditions such as meibomian gland dysfunction. It is an in- office procedure that provides controlled heat to the inner surface of 
the eyelids and pulsating pressure to the outer eyelid. This heat and pressure facilitates release of lipid, or meibum, from the meibomian glands to liquify and clear clogged glands. The procedure lasts 12 minutes and uses a single – use sterile dome shaped activator tha t applies  heat and 
pressure to the Meibomian glands to liquefy and clear clogged glands.  
4. Describe Placebo treatment.  
5. Meibomian Gland Evaluator for expression from meibomian glands  
  STUDY OUTCOMES  
 
Primary outcome : Change in DEQ -5 score from V3 to V4 for Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835648] -5 score from V2 to V3  for sham treatment .  
 
Secondary outcome : Change from V3 to Visit 4 in meibomian gland score (meibomian 
glands evaluated on the lower eyelid using MGE. 5 glands in 3 regions (nasal, central, temporal) evaluated and scored from 0 to 4 for a max score of 60 in each eye. MGS scale 0 = clear, 1 = cloudy, 2 = granular, 3 = pastelike, 4 = obstruction)  
 
Exploratory outcomes:  Change in TBUT, LLT

  STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
Sample Size Calculation  
 
CONFIDENTIAL STU DY PROPOSAL  (v. 2020 -JAN- 27)   
 Page 7 of 7 The overall sample size estimate for this study is based on the primary outcome 
measure of change in DEQ -5 score from V3 to V4 for Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_559020]. We 
hypothesized that the change in DEQ -5 score would be greater for the Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835649].  The sample size was calculated with 80% power to detect a mean difference of [ADDRESS_1160185] deviation of 3.5 points on the DEQ -5 questionnaire based on previous studies using a type 1 error of 
5%. This power calculation resulted in 14 patients. In order to ensure that the study is powered relative to any loss to follow up, we will recruit a total of 16 patients.  
 
Analysis  
A repeated measures analysis of variance (repeat measure ANOVA) will be  used for 
statistical analysis of crossover and treatment effects. Pearson correlation analysis will be performed to evaluate the relationship between Lipi[INVESTIGATOR_835650]. P values< 0.05 will be  considered statistically significant.

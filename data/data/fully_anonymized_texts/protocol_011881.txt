 minutes in each eye. Efficacy and safety assessments will be conducted for 5 hour s 
following Dose 2. 
Measures Taken to 
Reduce 
Bias: Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment 
an
d to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups.  
Double-masked treatment will be used to reduce the potential of bias during data 
collection and the evaluation of clinical endpoints.

Efficacy Endpoints 
 Primary Endpoint s: 
Per
centage of subjects with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) gain, from baseline, in best distance-
corrected visual acuity (BDCVA) at 40 cm (Precision Vision chart) and no loss in 
best distance corrected visual acuity ≥ 5 letters (ETDRS chart  at 4m ) in the study eye 
at Visit 3, following Dose 1, [ADDRESS_596138]-treatment 
BDCVA at 40 cm is measured using an ‘ETDRS -like’ chart from Precision Vision. 
The 40 cm Precision Vision chart uses the same letter and line spacing as the ETDRS 
chart, only calibrated in size for testing at 40 cm. Similar to the 4m chart, the 
Precision Vision 40 cm chart is placed in light box creating retro illumination for 
testing. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
Percentage of subjects with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) gain, from baseline, in BDCVA at 
40 cm (Prec ision Vision chart) and no loss in best distance corrected VA ≥ 5 letters 
(ETDRS chart at 4m) in the study eye at the following Visits, Doses and time points:

 General Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses 
Analysis Sets: 
• Full Analysis Set – The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects who have received 
at least one dose of the study drug. Subjects in the FAS will be analyzed as randomized. 
• Per Protocol Set – The per-protocol (PP) set will include subjects in the FAS who do not have significant 
protocol deviations that affect the primary endpoint analysis. Protocol deviations will be ass essed prior 
to database lock and unmasking. Subjects in the PP set will be analyzed as treated. 
• Safety Set – The safety set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose of the study 
drug. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated. 
Unit of Analysis: 
The study eye will be used for all monocular analyses. The fellow eye will inherently be in cluded in all binocular 
analyses. Both eyes will be displayed and analyzed for all ophthalmic safety variables. 
The study eye will be defined by [CONTACT_465021]. If both eyes 
meet all enrollment criteria, then the eye with the worse Visit 2 pre-treatment/baseline BDCVA at 4 0 cm 
(Precision Vision chart ) will be the study eye. If both eyes have the same BDCVA at 40 cm, the right eye will b e 
the study eye. 
General Considerations: 
In general, quantitative/continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n,  mean, standard 
deviation ( SD), median, minimum, and maximum). Qualitative/categorical data will be summarized using 
frequencies and percentages. Statistical testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2-sided 0.05 
significance level. 
For all variables, baseline is defined as the pre-randomization measurement taken at Visit 2 (Day 1), prior to 
administration of study drug. Change from baseline will be calculated as follow-up mea sure minus baseline 
measure. 
Hypothesis: 
The primary efficacy hypothesi s is: 
H01: The difference between study eyes treated with CSF-1 and study eyes treated with Veh icle, in the percentage 
of study eyes with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) improvement from baseline in BDCVA at 40 cm (Precision Vision ch art) 
without a loss in best distance corrected VA of ≥ 5 letters (ETDRS at 4m) at  Visit 3 (Day 8) , [ADDRESS_596139]-Dose 1 
= 0. 
H11: The difference between study eyes treated with CSF-1 and study eyes treated with Veh icle, in the percentage 
of study eyes with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) improvement from baseline in BDCVA at 40 cm (Precision Vision char t) 
without a loss in best distance corre cted VA of ≥ 5 letters (ETDRS at 4m) at Visit 3 (Day 8) , [ADDRESS_596140]-Dose 1 
≠ 0. 
The study will be considered a success if the null hypothesis, H 01, is rejected at a 2-sided alpha = 0.05 in favor of 
CSF-1 in the alternative hypothesis, H 11, tested as delineated in the primary efficacy analysis section, and the 
following secondary efficacy hypotheses will each be tested as stated under adjustments  for multiplicity.

each dose on Visit 3 (Day 8) assuming a response rate of 42.5% in CSF-1 and 17.5% in Vehicle using a Pearson 
chi-squared test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Accounting for approximately a 5% discontinuation rate, approximately 150 subjects per arm (approximately 300 
total) will be randomized. 
Estimates were obtained from the Phase 2b study (18-150-0006) Intent- to-Treat ( ITT) population response for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] 0.4% vs. diclofenac (control), additionally imputing missing data as failures.  
At least approximately 30% of subjects will have light (i.e., blue, green, gray, and hazel) iris, and at least 
approximately 30% will have a brown iris. The actual percentages will vary based on enrollment. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis: 
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is the p ercentage of subjects with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) gain, from 
baseline, in best distance-corrected visual acuity (BDCVA) at 40 cm (Precision Vision chart) and no loss in best 
distance corrected visual acuity ≥ 5 letters (ETDRS chart) at Visit 3, 1 hour following Dose 1 in the study eye. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted in the FAS with intercurrent events handled in the following 
manners:  
1) Discontinuation of study drug and non-optimal compliance will be ignored [treatment policy strategy]. 
2) Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed as failure 
[hypothetical strategy ]. 
3) Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy or adverse 
events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation (MI) using randomized treatment-
based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology [hypothetical strategy]. 
No subject data will be excluded from the FAS due to protocol violations/deviations. The FAS will be used for 
the primary efficacy analyses. Note that multiple imputations of missing values will be completed for the 
continuous measures (BDCVA at [ADDRESS_596152] distance corrected VA at 4m), then the response variable will be 
determined therefrom. 
Sensitivity analyses on the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the FAS with all missing data 
imputed as failures, the FAS with observed data, and PP set with observed data. Additional sensitivity analyses 
such as control-based pattern mixture model MIs and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_464993] (SAP). 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Testing of the percentage of subjects with at least a 3-
line (15-letter) improvement from baseline in BDCVA at 40 cm without a loss of ≥ [ADDRESS_596153] distance 
corrected VA at 4m will be completed separately for the 1 hour and 2 hour time points using a generalized linear 
mixed model with a binomial distribution including fixed effects of baseline BDCVA at 40 cm as a covariate, 
daily dose (Dose 1 and Dose 2), treatment, and the interaction of dose with treatment and random effect of 
subject to account for the correlation within a subject between daily doses. The dose- by-treatment interaction 
term will be used to check if there is differential treatment effect between Dose 1 and Dose 2. If the dose- by-

of the treatment effect will be completed within the model separately following Dose 1 and following Dose 2. If 
the dose- by-treatment interaction term is not significant (p ≥ 0.10), then the interaction term will be removed 
from the model and testing of treatment effect will be completed within the model pooled over dose.  
The adjusted odds ratios and marginal proportions and difference in proportions along with corresponding two-
sided 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values will be presented. 
Treatment comparisons will also be made separately for each time point and dose using logistic regression model 
including fixed effects of baseline BDCVA at 40 cm as a covariate and treatment, Pearson’s chi -squared test or 
Fisher’s exact test if any of the cell counts are less than five as a sensitivity analysis to the primary model above.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
For the secondary efficacy endpoints of BDCVA at 40 cm, the percentage of subjects who achieve a ≥ 3 -line (15-
letters) improvement from baseline without a loss of ≥ [ADDRESS_596154] distance corrected VA  at 4m for each 
Visit, time point and daily dose (Dose 1 and Dose 2) will be summarized and analyzed using the same imputation 
as the primary efficacy endpoint. The same modeling strategy will be used as detailed in the primary efficacy 
analysis for any time point that is measured after both doses within the visit

Safety Analysis:  
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms 
and be presented in a data listing. Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), those that occur after the first Dose of 
study drug, will be summarized by [CONTACT_465022] 
(SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) within each SOC. Similar summaries will also be presented for serious TEAEs, 
TEAEs leading to death, TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, TEAEs related to IP and TEAEs by 
[CONTACT_926]. When reporting the incidence of AEs, a subject will only be counted once if they ever experience an 
event within the SOC and ever experience the individual PT within the SOC. 
Actual results and changes from baseline results in monocular and binocular BCVA at 4m and Low- Luminance 
BCVA, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, conjunctival redness grading, IP drop comfort, IOP, and dilated fundus 
examination will be summarized descriptively at each visit by [CONTACT_1570].  
Full details of the safety analyses will be specified in the formal SAP.

IND # [ADDRESS_596162] individuals will develop symptoms of presby[CONTACT_465023] 50 (Truscott 2009). Worldwide, 
there were 1.8 billion people globally with presby[CONTACT_465024] 2015, with a prevalence of 
approximately 25%, which is growing as the world population is aging. Approximately 45% of 
these cases (~826 million) had near visual impairment (VI) because of lack of or inadequate 
vision correction (Fricke, Tahhan et al. 2018). The primary symptom of this condition is a 
progressive blurring of vision when performing near tasks such as reading, sewing, working at a 
computer, and using a tablet or cellular phone. Other symptoms include headaches and visual 
fatigue, which impair one’s quality of life (Truscott 2009).  
The underlying cause of presby[CONTACT_465025] (accommodation) 
(Donders 1864). Accommodation is facilitated by [CONTACT_465026], 
which change the shape and location of the crystalline lens of the eye. In response to near vision, 
the crystalline lens becomes thicker and more rounded in response to the actions of the ciliary 
muscle fibers (Garner and Yap 1997, Croft, Glasser et al. 2001, Glasser 2006). As an individual 
ages, the lens becomes stiffer and less amenable to changing shape in response to ciliary Muscle 
activity and this culminates in the symptoms of presby[CONTACT_19555]. 
Pupil size is determined by [CONTACT_465027][INVESTIGATOR_464996]. 
The pupil becomes smaller in conjunction to accommodation. This reduction in the size of the 
pupil (termed miosis) improves the resolution of the retinal image by [CONTACT_465028]. A relatively small pupil offers increased depth of field in a way 
similar to that achieved by [CONTACT_465029] a camera, leading to better visual acuity (VA) 
of close objects. 
Current presby[CONTACT_465030]/multifocal lenses, corneal refractive surgery, corneal inlay procedures, and intra-ocular 
lens surgery. Monovision correction improves the near vision of one eye (through the use of 
lenses, contacts, or surgery) while allowing the other eye to be used for distance vision. This 
approach has had variable results and may cause disturbances in depth-perception (Fernandez, 
Schwarz et al. 2013). Lastly, surgical correction of vision in presby[CONTACT_465031], laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), laser-assisted epi[INVESTIGATOR_464997] (LASEK), photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), corneal inlays, and 
accommodative or multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs). The results of these procedures are 
variable, at times inconsistent, and contraindicated in some patient groups (Moussa, Jehangir et 
al. 2017). The inconsistencies regarding the success of some of these procedures of presby[CONTACT_465032] a need for alternative strategies. 
The treatment proposed here repurposes a muscarinic receptor agonist to stimulate effects on iris 
and ciliary contractility via stimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M3. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227], a 
muscarinic agonist, has been successful in treating cases of dilated pupil following ocular 
surgery (Patel, Jenkins et al. 2002) and a broad spectrum of systemic conditions including 
botulism (Monaco, Freddi et al. 1998), leprosy (Lana-Peixoto, Campos et al. 2014), sarcoidosis 
(Bowie and Givre 2003), and Ross syndrome (Weller, Wilhelm et al. 1992 , Chemmanam, 
Pandian et al. 2007). 
CSF-1 was initially developed as a combination of a Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug 
(NSAID), diclofenac, with pi[INVESTIGATOR_464998] a potential inflammatory response associated 
with pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227].

 The safety and efficacy of CSF-1 (the initial combination and current formulation) is well 
established based on several previous clinical studies; an investigator-led feasibility study and 
two Phase 2a studies demonstrated favorable safety and preliminary efficacy. 
A Phase 2b multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel groups, clinical study was 
conducted to measure the contribution of each active ingredient to the efficacy and safety of 
CSF-1. Subjects were assigned to one of three treatment arms; diclofenac sodium alone 
(0.006%), pi[INVESTIGATOR_143569] (0.2% and 0.4%) combined with diclofenac sodium (0.006%), and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_464999] (0.2% and 0.4%, the latter being the current formulation). Results from 
this study showed that diclofenac did not significantly improve tolerability, safety or efficacy of 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_465000]. Furthermore, the percentage of subjects in the CSF-1 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_143569] 0.4%/diclofenac sodium 0.006%) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_143569] (0.4%) alone groups 
with ≥ [ADDRESS_596163]-treatment at 
Visit 4 was statistically significant (p-value=0.0015 for CSF-1 group and p-value= 0.0002 for 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_465001]) compared to the diclofenac group, demonstrating success for the primary 
efficacy endpoint in the CSF-1 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_143569] 0.4%/diclofenac sodium 0.006%) and 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_143569] (0.4%) alone groups. The study thus indicated that 0.4% pi[INVESTIGATOR_465002] a 
single active ingredient was responsible for the temporary correction of presby[CONTACT_465033] t 
diclofenac is not needed in the formulation. For this reason, the Sponsor decided to continue the 
clinical development of CSF-1 with pi[INVESTIGATOR_143569] 0.4% alone and to drop diclofenac from the 
clinical formulation 
In addition, a post-hoc analysis was cond ucted with the additional criteria of no loss of ≥ [ADDRESS_596164]-hoc analysis showed that 22 (43.1%)

results from the Phase 2b study and suggests that not only is CSF-1 effective for the temporary 
correction of presby[CONTACT_19555] (evidenced by a ≥ [ADDRESS_596166]-administration at 
Day 15 compared to baseline) but also that the benefit in BCVA at 40 cm remains after

 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of CSF-1 (0.4% pi[INVESTIGATOR_465004]) for the temporary correction of presby[CONTACT_19555].  
2.2 Secondary Objectives 
The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CSF-1 (0.4% 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_143573]) versus Vehicle. 
3 CLINICAL HYPOTHESES  
The clinical hypothesis of this study is that CSF-1 is superior and/or safer/better tolerated 
compared with Vehicle for improving near vision in subjects with presby[CONTACT_19555]. 
4 OVERALL STUDY DESIGN 
This is a 4-visit multi-center, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group study evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of CSF-1 compared with Vehicle in approximately 300 subjects with

 6 STUDY PARAMETERS 
6.1 Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints 
Percentage of subjects with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) gain, from baseline, in BDCVA at 40 cm 
(Precision Vision chart) and no loss in BDCVA ≥ 5 letters (ETDRS chart at 4m) in the study eye 
at Visit 3, following Dose 1, [ADDRESS_596183]-treatment 
The BDCVA at 40 cm is measured using an ‘ETDRS -like’ chart from Precision Vision. The 40 
cm Precision Vision chart uses the same letter and line spacing as the ETDRS chart, only 
calibrated in size for testing at 40 cm. Similar to the 4m chart, the Precision Vision 40 cm char t 
is placed in light box, creating retro illumination for testing.

Protocol 20-150-0003   Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) 
IND # [ADDRESS_596185] ( IP) is CSF-1, a sterile topi[INVESTIGATOR_465007]. The formulation 
developed by [CONTACT_465034]. is a preservative-free eye drop, containing the active 
ingredient pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] 0.4%, with the addition of standard pharmacopoeial 
excipi[INVESTIGATOR_465008]. 
The vehicle (CSF-1 placebo) is a topi[INVESTIGATOR_465009]-1 except for the active ingredient. 
Both IP and Vehicle are packaged in a single-dose transparent low-density polyethylene (LDPE) 
vials, enclosed within a pouch. Each pouch includes five vials. Kits will be dispensed to subjects 
at Visit 2 and Visit 3 with 1 week of at-home dosing in each kit. CSF-1 will be evaluated for 
comparison to Vehicle. 
Instructions for Use and Administration 
All study treatments are topi[INVESTIGATOR_465010].  
Following Visit 2, all subjects will be instructed to dose twice daily (BID) with a single drop in 
each eye for approximately [ADDRESS_596186] daily dose should occur in the morning, with the 
second dose following 2 hours later (+1 hour). Subjects will be instructed not to dose at home on 
clinic visit days. 
Following Visit 3, all subjects will be instructed to dose twice daily (BID) with a single drop in 
each eye for approximately [ADDRESS_596187] daily dose should occur in the morning with the 
second dose following 3 hours later (+1 hour). Subjects will be instructed not to dose at home on 
clinic visit days. 
Subject Instructions 
After randomization at Visit 2, subjects will receive study drug and a paper dosing diary. Once 
dispensed to the subject, the study drug must be stored in a refrigerator or cooler with ice pack. 
Study drug is packaged as a single dose unit. Subjects will remove one pouch from a single study 
drug kit and remove one vial from the strip. The remaining vials will be returned to the opened 
pouch and placed back into the refrigerator. Each subject will instill one drop of study drug to 
each eye and keep aside the used vial to be returned to the site at next visit for compliance check. 
An open vial should not be re-used. Subjects will be instructed to save and return all used and 
unused study drug and to bring their kits to each study visit. Following Visit 2, subjects will be 
instructed to dose bilaterally BID (with 2 hours (+1 hour) between doses) and record doses in 
their diary until Visit 3. Subjects should not dose at home on day of Visit 3. At Visit 3, subjects 
will receive their doses at the visit by [CONTACT_465035]-treatment 
assessments and the current study drug will be collected. After subjects receive their study drug 
and dosing diary, subjects will be instructed to dose bilaterally BID (with 3 hours (+1 hour) 
between doses) and record doses in their diary until Visit 4. Subjects should not dose at home on 
day of Visit 4. At Visit 4, subjects will receive their doses at the visit by [CONTACT_465036]-treatment assessments and their study drug will be collected. Subjects will exit the 
study after all assessments are complete at Visit 4.

▪ recreational drug use (e.g., marijuana, methadone, heroin, cocaine) 
Procedures for Final Study Entry 
Subjects must satisfy all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria in order to be entered into 
the study. 
Pregnancy 
Females must have a negative urine pregnancy test at Visit 1, if female of childbearing potential 
(those who have experienced menarche and who are not surgically sterilized [bilateral tubal 
ligation, hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy] or post-menopausal [[ADDRESS_596189]

 menses]) and must use adequate birth control throughout the study period. Adequate birth control 
is defined as hormonal – oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal contraceptives; mechanical 
– spermicide in conjunction with a barrier such as condom or diaphragm; IUD; or surgical 
sterilization of partner. For non-sexually active females, abstinence may be regarded as an 
adequate method of birth control. 
In the event a female has a positive urine pregnancy test at Visit 4, the subject will be withdrawn 
from the study and the investigator will notify  and the sponsor within [ADDRESS_596190] meets all qualification criteria at 
Visit 2, he/she will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio via an Interactiv e Response Technology (IRT) 
system to one of the following treatment groups: 1: CSF-1 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_143566] 0.4% 
ophthalmic solution), 2: Vehicle, and stratified by [CONTACT_60245] (brown versus light [i.e., blue, green, 
gray, and hazel]) and by [CONTACT_465037] (-4.5 D to <-0.5 D, -0.5 
D to +0.75 D, and >+0.75 D to +2.0 D); randomization will not be stratified by [CONTACT_3725].  
At least approximately 30% of subjects will have light (i.e., blue, green, gray, and hazel) iris and 
at least approximately 30% will have a brown iris. The actual percentages will vary based on 
enrollment. 
Randomization will be used to avoid bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment, to increase 
the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (e.g., iris color and baseline 
characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of 
statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Double-masked treatment will be used to reduce 
the potential of bias during data collection and the evaluation of clinical endpoints.  
8.2 Concurrent Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_465011], prescription, or OTC taken within 30 days of Visit 1, is to 
be recorded on the subjects ’ source document and corresponding electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF ) along with the reason the medication was taken. 
All significant current and prior ocular medical and surgical history are to be recorded on the 
subjects ’ source document and corresponding eCRF. All current and prior significant general 
medical and surgical history is to be recorded on the subject’s source document and 
corresponding eCRF. 
Concurrent enrollment in another investigational drug or medical device study is not permitted.

 9 ADVERSE EVENTS 
9.1 Adverse Event 
An adverse event ( AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of 
an IP in humans, whether it is considered IP-related or not. An AE can be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an IP, without any judgment about causality. An AE can arise from 
any use of the IP (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug or medical device) 
and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_3184]/or in response to an open question from study 
personnel or revealed by [CONTACT_4171], physical examination, or other diagnostic procedures will 
be recorded in the subject’s source document and eCRF. Any clinically relevant deterioration in 
clinical finding is considered an AE and must be recorded. When possible, signs and symptoms 
indicating a common underlying pathology should be noted as one comprehensive event. 
Documentation regarding the AE should be made as to the nature, date of onset, end date, 
severity, relationship to IP, expectedness, action(s) taken, seriousness, and outcome of any sign 
or symptom observed by [CONTACT_465038]. 
All AEs will be collected from the time a subject signs the ICF through the subjects ’ study exit 
visit. 
Severity 
The severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the degree of intensity of an AE 
as determined by [CONTACT_72079]/her by [CONTACT_102]/subject. The assessment of 
severity is made irrespective of relationship to IP or seriousness of the event and should be 
evaluated according to the following scale: 
• Mild : Event is noticeable to the subject but is easily tolerated and does not interfere with 
the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : Event is bothersome, possibly requiring additional therapy, and may interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Severe : Event is intolerable, necessitates additional therapy or alteration of therapy, and 
interferes with the subject’s daily activities.  
Relationship to Investigational Product 
The relationship of each AE to the IP should be determined by [CONTACT_459742]: 
• Suspected : A reasonable possibility exists that the IP caused the AE. 
• Not Suspected : A reasonable possibility does not exist that the IP caused the AE. 
“Suspected adverse reaction ” means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the 
IP caused the AE. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE. Types of evidence that would suggest a causal 
relationship between the IP and the AE include: a single occurrence of an event that is 
uncommon and known to be strongly associated with IP exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic 
injury, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome); one or more occurrences of an event that is not commonly 
Orasis Pharmaceuticals  CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution 
Protocol 20-150-0003   Version 2.0 (Amendment 1) 
IND # 131464  January 07, 2021 
40 
 associated with IP exposure, but is otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the IP 
(e.g., tendon rupture); an aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical trial (such as 
known consequences of the underlying disease or condition under investigation or other events 
that commonly occur in the study population independent of drug therapy) that indicates those 
events occur more frequently in the IP-treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control 
group. 
Expectedness 
The expectedness of an AE should be determined based upon existing safety information about 
the IP using these explanations: 
• Unexpected : an AE that is not listed in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) or is not listed at 
the specificity or severity that has been observed. 
• Expected : an AE that is listed in the IB at the specificity and severity that has been 
observed. 
• Not applicable:  an AE unrelated to IP. 
AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of products or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological (or other) properties of the product but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular product under investigation are to be considered unexpected. 
The investigator should initially classify the expectedness of an AE. The final classification of an 
AE is subject to the sponsor ’s determination.  
9.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any 
of the following outcomes: 
• Death; 
• A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the  investigator or 
sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not 
include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; 
Note: The term “inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any inpatient admission (even  if 
< 24 hours). For chronic or long-term inpatients, inpatient admission includes transfer 
within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4591]/intensive care inpatient unit. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241525]: emergency room visits; outpatient/same-day/ambulatory procedures; 
observation/short stay units; rehabilitation facilities; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4593]; nursing homes; or 
clinical research/Phase 1 units. 
Note: The term “prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” refers to any extension of an 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_241526]. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions;

 Note: A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) specifically related to visual threat would be 
interpreted as any potential impairment or damage to the subject’s eyes ( e.g., intraocular 
hemorrhage, retinal detachment, central corneal ulcer, or damage to the optic nerve). 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
Important medical events that may not result in death, are life-threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition. The medical monitor will review and determine the 
expectedness of any SAE following the investigator’s assessment.

Reporting a Suspected Unexpected Adverse Reaction 
All AEs that are ‘suspected’ and ‘unexpected’ are to be reported to the study sponsor , and 
the IRB as required by [CONTACT_1201], federal, state, or local regulations and governing health 
authorities. 
Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 
To ensure subject safety, all SAEs, regardless of relationsh ip to the study drug, must be 
immediately reported by [CONTACT_465039] [ADDRESS_596197] also inform the IRB of 
the AE within their guidelines for reporting SAEs. The investigator is obligated to pursue and 
obtain information requested by  [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the sponsor in addition to the information reported 
on the source document, SAE Report Form, and eCRF. All subjects experiencing an SAE must 
be followed-up with, and the outcome reported.

9.4 Procedures for Unmasking (if applicable) 
Tre
atment assignment should not be communicated to the Contract Research Organization 
(CRO ) or Sponsor and should not be recorded in any study documents or source document. 
When medically necessary, the investigator may need to determine what treatment has been 
assigned to a subject. When possible (i.e., in non-emergen cy situations), and/or the study 
sponsor should be notified before unmasking the study drug. 

Orasis Pharmaceuticals  CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution

IND # [ADDRESS_596198], or certified mail. All follow-up will be documented in the subjects ’ 
source document. Non-serious AEs identified on the last scheduled contact [CONTACT_465040]. 
If the investigator becomes aware of any new information regarding an SAE (i.e., resolution, 
change in condition, or new treatment), a new SAE Report Form must be completed and 
faxed/emailed to  and/or the study sponsor within 24 hours. The original SAE Report Form is 
not to be altered. The SAE Report Form should describe whether the event has resolved or 
continues and how the event was treated. 
 
10 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES AND METHODS OF ANALYSES  
10.1 General Considerations  
In general, quantitative/continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (n, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum). Qualitative/categorical data will be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages. Statistical testing, unless otherwise indicated, 
will be performed at a 2-sided 0.05 significance level.  
For all variables, baseline is defined as the pre-randomization measurement taken at Visit 2 (Day 
1), prior to administration of study drug. Change from baseline will be calculated as follow-up 
measure minus baseline measure. 
10.2 Hypotheses 
The primary efficacy hypothesis is: 
H01: The difference between study eyes treated with CSF-1 and study eyes treated with Vehicle, 
in the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) improvement from baseline in BDCVA 
at 40 cm (Precision Vision chart) without a loss in best distance corrected VA of ≥ 5 letters 
(ETDRS at 4m) at Visit 3 (Day 8), [ADDRESS_596199]-Dose 1 = 0. 
H11: The difference between study eyes treated with CSF-1 and study eyes treated with Vehicle, 
in the percentage of study eyes with a ≥ 3 -line (15-letter) improvement from baseline in BDCVA 
at 40 cm (Precision Vision chart) without a loss in best distance corrected VA of ≥ 5 letters 
(ETDRS at 4m) at Visit 3 (Day 8), [ADDRESS_596200]-Dose 1 ≠ 0.  
The study will be considered a success if the null hypothesis, H01, is rejected at a 2-sided alpha 
= 0.05 in favor of CSF-1 in the alternative hypothesis, H11, tested as delineated in the primary 
efficacy analysis section, and the following secondary efficacy hypotheses will each be tested as 
stated under adjustments for multiplicity.

10.3 Study Populations  
• Full Analysis Set – The full analysis set (FAS) will include all randomized subjects who 
have received at least one dose of the study drug. Subjects in the FAS will be analyzed as 
randomized. 
• Per Protocol Set – The per-protocol (PP) set will include subjects in the FAS who do not 
have significant protocol deviations that affect the primary endpoint analysis. Protocol 
deviations will be assessed prior to database lock and unmasking. Subjects in the PP set 
will be analyzed as treated. 
• Safety Set – The safety set will include all subjects who have received at least one dose 
of the study drug. Subjects in the safety population will be analyzed as treated.  
10.4 Unit of Analysis 
The study eye will be used for all monocular analyses. The fellow eye will inherently be 
included in all binocular analyses. Both eyes will be displayed and analyzed for all ophthalmic 
safety variables. 
The study eye will be defined by [CONTACT_465041]. If both eyes meet all enrollment criteria, then the eye with the worse Visit 2 pre-
treatment/baseline BDCVA at 40 cm (Precision Vision chart) will be the study eye. If both eyes 
have the same BDCVA at 40 cm, the right eye will be the study eye.

 10.5 Sample Size 
A total sample size of 280 subjects (140 subjects per arm) yields >97.5% power to establish 
superiority of CSF- 1 to Vehicle in the percentage of study eyes demonstrating a ≥ 3 -line (15-
letter) gain from baseline in BDCVA at 40 cm (Precision Vision chart) and no loss of best 
distance corrected VA ≥5 letters (ETDRS at 4m), [ADDRESS_596211] each dose on Visit 3 (Day 8) 
assuming a response rate of 42.5% in CSF-1 and 17.5% in Vehicle using a Pearson chi-squared 
test with a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Accounting for approximately a 5% discontinuation rate, approximately 150 subjects per arm 
(approximately 300 total) will be randomized. 
Estimates were obtained from the Phase 2 study (18-150-0006) Intent- to-Treat (ITT) population 
response for pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227] 0.4% vs. diclofenac (control), additionally imputing missing data as 
failures.  
At least approximately 30% of subjects will have light (i.e., blue, green, gray, and hazel) iris, and 
at least approximately 30% will have a brown iris. The actual percentages will vary based on 
enrollment. 
10.[ADDRESS_596212] demographics including age, gender, race, ethnicity, and iris color will be presented 
using summary statistics (mean, SD, minimum, maximum, and median) or frequency counts and 
percentages as appropriate.  
10.7 Efficacy Analysis  
Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is the percentage of subjects with a ≥ 3 -line (15-
letter) gain, from baseline, in best distance-corrected visual acuity (BDCVA) at 40 cm (Precision 
Vision chart) and no loss in best distance corrected visual acui ty ≥ 5 letters (ETDRS chart) at 
Visit 3, 1 hour following Dose 1 in the study eye. The primary efficacy analysis will be 
conducted in the FAS with intercurrent events handled in the following manners:  

Orasis Pharmaceuticals  CSF-1 Ophthalmic Solution

IND # 131464  January 07, 2021 
51 
 1) Discontinuation of study drug and non-optimal compliance will be ignored [treatment 
policy strategy]. 
2) Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly imputed 
as failure [hypothetical strategy]. 
3) Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of efficacy 
or adverse events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple Imputation (MI) 
using randomized treatment-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology 
[hypothetical strategy]. 
No subject data will be excluded from the FAS due to protocol violations/deviations. The FAS 
will be used for the primary efficacy analyses. Note that multiple imputations of missing values 
will be completed for the continuous measures (BDCVA at [ADDRESS_596213] distance corrected 
VA at 4m), then the response variable will be determined therefrom. 
 
 
 
 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. Testing of the percentage of subjects 
with at least a 3- line (15-letter) improvement from baseline in BDCVA at 40 cm without a loss 
of ≥ [ADDRESS_596214] distance corrected VA at 4m will be completed separately for the 1 hour and 
2 hour time points using a generalized linear mixed model with a binomial distribution including 
fixed effects of baseline BDCVA at 40 cm as a covariate, daily dose (Dose 1 and Dose 2), 
treatment, and the interaction of dose with treatment and random effect of subject to account for 
the correlation within a subject between daily doses.  
 
 
 
  
  
The adjusted odds ratios and marginal proportions and difference in proportions along with 
corresponding two-sided 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) and p-values will be presented. 
Treatment comparisons will also be made separately for each time point and dose using logistic 
regression model including fixed effects of baseline BDCVA at 40 cm as a covariate and 
treatment, Pearson’s chi -squared test or Fisher’s exact test if  any of the cell counts are less than 
five as a sensitivity analysis to the primary model above.  
Secondary Efficacy Analysis 
For the secondary efficacy endpoints of BDCVA at 40 cm, the percentage of subjects who 
achieve a ≥ 3 -line (15-letters) improvement from baseline without a loss of ≥ [ADDRESS_596215] 
distance corrected VA at 4m for each Visit, time point and daily dose (Dose 1 and Dose 2) will 
be summarized and analyzed using the same imputation as the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
same modeling strategy will be used as detailed in the primary efficacy analysis for any time 
point that is measured after both doses within the visit [e.g.: 2 hours at Visit 3 (Day 8); 30 
minutes, 1 and 2 hours at Visit 2 (Day 1); and 20 minutes, 1, 2, and 3 hours at Visit 4 (Day 15)]. 
For those time points that are measured only after the second dose within the visit

10.8 Safety Analysis 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) terms and be presented in a data listing. Treatment Emergent AEs (TEAEs), those 
that occur after the first dose of study drug, will be summarized by [CONTACT_465042] (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) within each 
SOC. Similar summaries will also be presented for serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to death, 
TEAEs leading to study drug discontinuation, TEAEs related to IP and TEAEs by [CONTACT_926]. 
When reporting the incidence of AEs, a subject will only be counted once if they ever experience 
an event within the SOC and ever experience the individual PT within the SOC. 
Actual results and changes from baseline results in monocular and binocular BCVA at 4m and 
Low- Luminance BCVA, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, conjunctival redness grading, IP drop 
comfort, IOP, and dilated fundus examination will be summarized descriptively at each visit by 
[CONTACT_1570]. 
Full details of the safety analyses will be specified in the formal SAP. 
10.9 Interim Analysis 
No interim analyses are planned for this study.

 10.10 Missing Data 
The primary efficacy analyses will be conducted with missing data and intercurrent events 
handled in the following manners:  
1) Discontinuation of study drug and non-optimal compliance will be ignored 
[treatment policy strategy]. 
2) Withdrawal due to lack of efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be singly 
imputed as failure [hypothetical strategy]. 
3) Missing data without withdrawal or withdrawal due to reasons other than lack of 
efficacy or adverse events: missing data will be imputed employing Multiple 
Imputation (MI) using randomized treatment-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) methodology [hypothetical strategy]. 
Sensitivity analyses on the primary efficacy variable will be performed using the FAS with all 
missing data imputed as failures, the FAS with observed data, and PP set with observed data. 
Additional sensitivity analyses such as control-based pattern mixture model MIs and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_465012] (SAP).

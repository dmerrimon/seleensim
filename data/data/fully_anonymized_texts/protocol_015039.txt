1) Objectives:  
Primary:  
To e valuate efficacy of the addition of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442482] -emetic combination of [ADDRESS_562156] and 
dexamethasone for gastrointestinal cancer patients receiving FOLFIRINOX ( 5-FU, oxaliplatin 
and irinotecan)  chemotherapy. The primary objective is to determine the rate of complete 
response (no emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_140586]) in the combined acute and delayed phase 
from 0 -120 hours after chemotherapy.  
 
Secondary :  
To determine the incidence of nausea and vomiting in both acute (<24 hours) and delayed (24 -
120 hours) setting  in patients receiving FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy . 
   
Tertiar y: 
Follow overall survival in patients receiving FOLFI RINOX chemotherapy.  
 
2) Background  and Rationale : 
 
          Nausea and vomiting are symptomatic side effects of chemotherapy that are both 
physically and psychologically burdensome.  Until the advent of the serotonin receptor 
antagonists, control of nausea and vomiting for patient receiving high -dose chemotherapy was 
inadequate. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, the current 
approach for prophylaxis of nausea and vomitin g caused by [CONTACT_442549] 5 -HT3 antagonists  (ondansetron or granisetron)  combined with corticosteroids and 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053].[ADDRESS_562157]  used 
for chemotherapy associated nausea and vomiting.  Neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (NK1RA) 
are a class of anti -emetic compounds that can block NK 1 receptor in the gastrointestinal fibers 
and the brainstem and is thought to play a key role in emesis induction when these receptors are  
stimulated by [CONTACT_358574]/or chemotherapy.[ADDRESS_562158] 
from the 5 -HT3’s, which act mainly at peripheral sites. Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (an antagonist at this receptor) 
was first tested in animal models including ferrets and displa yed potent and long -acting anti -
emetic activity.3  NK1RA’s antagonize a much broader range of emetic stimuli than the 5 -HT3’s 
in animal models.4 
 
 The benefit of combining aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_372665] 5 -HT3 receptor antagonists and corticosteroids 
for the prevention of  chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting ( CINV ) was initially shown in 
two phase III trials that included 1099 patients receiving cisplatin -containing chemotherapy  (≥70 
mg/m2  per cycle).5 6  In both trials, patients were randomly assigned to ondansetron  (day 1) plus 
dexamethasone  (days 1 to 4) with either aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (125 mg by [CONTACT_442550] 1, followed by 80 
mg orally on days 2 and 3) or placebo. The end point of both studies was complete protection 
from emesis with no need for any  rescue antiemetic . Acute emesis was blocked more effectively 
in patients receiving aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (overall 86 percent versus 73 percent with placebo). The 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] -containing regimen maintained its advantage in controlling CINV over multiple 
treatment cycle s. Similar results were seen in a third phase III trial, in which patients were 
randomly assigned to a three -drug regimen including aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], ondansetron , and 
dexamethasone  or to ondansetron plus dexamethasone only. The overall, acute, and delayed 
complete response rates were significantly better with the aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442483] (72 versus 61, 88 
 
 4 versus 79, and 74 versus 63 percent, respectively) compared to ondansetron plus dexamethasone 
alone.7   
 
 
 Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442484] (IV) administration . It is approved in [ADDRESS_562159] and dexamethasone for the prevention of acute and delayed 
nause a and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic 
chemotherapy (HEC) and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). A Phase III study was 
recently conducted utilizing fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], at a dose of [ADDRESS_562160] common primary tumor types were 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal cancer, reproductive cancer, and genitourinary cancer. The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of patients with  Complete Response in the overall phase (0 to 120 
hours following initiation of cisplatin chemotherapy). Complete Response is defined as the 
absence of vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], retching or dry heaves (no vomiting) and no use of rescue 
medication. The fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442485] a complete response of 72% as compared to 72% in 
patient receiving aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_226473] 3 days.  Acute and delayed phase had similar outcome 89% vs. 
88% and 74% vs. 74%. No vomiting was noted in 73% treated with fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442486] 75% had 
no vomiti ng in the aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_247011].8 
 
 Adverse events were reported for 1,389 (60.1%) patients, 671 (58.7%) in the 
fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442487] 718 (61.4%) in the aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_140561]. The adverse 
events were generally comparable between the fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] a nd aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_335659]. In general, 
the adverse event profile observed was typi[INVESTIGATOR_12340] a patient population with cancer receiving  
highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The most frequently reported clinical adverse events reported 
in both the fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_140560] g roup and the aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442488] (10%), 
constipation (10%), anorexia (7.9%), diarrhea (8.3%), and nausea (6.5%).[ADDRESS_562161] 20%, and 5%, respectively.[ADDRESS_562162] decade.10  This 
was a prospectively designed study that compared 5 -fluoro uracil to gemcitabine therapy in 126 
patients.  5 -FU was given as a bolus at 600mg/m2 weekly and gemcitabine was given at 
1000mg/m2 for [ADDRESS_562163].  The results showed statistically 
significant improvement in the primary endpoint of clinical benefit response (CBR: defined as 
composite of measurements of pain, performance status and weight) and 5 weeks improvement 
in median survival.  Howeve r the median survival for gemcitabine arm was still a dismal 5.65 
months with 1 year survival rate of 18%. More than 10 large randomized clinical trials were 
conducted to improve the clinical outcome in pancreas cancer but the results were all 
disappointin g. 
 
 5       
          In 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, a randomized  phase 3 trial 
comparing the FOLFIRINOX regimen (oxaliplatin and irinotecan plus fluorouracil and 
leucovorin) to gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer was presented.11  Results showed an 
overall survival increased from 6·8 months to 11·1 months (p<0·0001). More interestingly, 
almost half the patients in the FOLFIRINOX group were alive after 1 year, and response rate 
was 31·6% —the highest rate seen in phase 3 pancreatic cancer trials. However the side effects of 
treatment was worse in the FOLFIRINOX group.  Patients had 61% vomiting with grade III 
nausea and vomiting in 15%.  In another FOLFIRINOX study in advanced colorectal cancer, up 
to 79.4% had vomiting and 91% had n ausea.[ADDRESS_562164] demonstrated that 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442489].13 14  
 
In this open labeled study, the goal is to improve complete response to n ausea and 
vomiting from about 30% in historical control to about 60% with addition of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442490].  Hopefully this study could elucidate the impact 
of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442491].  
 
 
3. Drug Information:  
A. Description:  
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442492], (EMEND™  for Injection) is a phosphoryl prodrug of  
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (EMEND™ 2) that can be administered intravenously (IV). Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442493] (within 30 minutes) converted t o aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442494]. Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442495] a selective high affinity antagonist of substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. It has 
little or no affinity for serotonin, dopamine and corticosteroid receptors.   
 
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442496] -white, odorl ess powder that is highly soluble in water or 0.9%  
solution of sodium chloride (about 55 mg/mL as free acid equivalent). It is prepared  
by a multistep chemical synthesis as the bis -meglumine salt, which has a molecular  
formula of C 23H22F7N4O6P•(C 7H17NO 5)2 and a molecular weight of 1004.83 (61.1%  
of which is attributable to the free acid). The neat solid is thermally unstable and  
degrades at about 155°C to aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442497]. It is also  
unstable in aqueous solutions and it must be form ulated as a lyophilized powder in  
order to prevent its degradation during storage.  
 
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442498] 10 -mL vials as a  sterile, lyophilized 
preparation; each vial contains an overage of 5% to account for  non-withdrawable lo ss 
after reconstitution of the lyophilized product in order to  deliver appropriate dose. The 
lyophilized product per [ADDRESS_562165] per 150 mg vial contains 
157.5 mg free acid equivalent (150 mg  label claim) of active drug substance, 78.[ADDRESS_562166] be stored at 2 to 8°C. Prior to use, the 
preparation will be reconstituted with  0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to a final 
concentration of 1 mg/mL. The final  drug solution is stable for [ADDRESS_562167] allows for reconstitution in normal saline taken from an y 
package  including PVC bags and do not require specialized IV infusion equipment.  
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442499]’s Solution (LRS) or any other  
solutions containing divalent cations. Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442500] s olutions for which physical and chemical compatibility has been established.  
    
B. Pharmacology : 
 
1. Pharmacokinetics :  
 
Following a single intravenous dose of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_372677] a 15 -minute 
infusion to healthy volunteers the mean AUC  of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_252366] t was 31.7 (± 14.3)  mcg•hr/mL 
and the mean maximal aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442501] (C max) was 3.27 (± 1.16)  mcg/mL. The 
mean aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442502] [ADDRESS_562168] dose  was similar between the 125 -
mg oral aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442503] 115 -mg intravenous fosap repi[INVESTIGATOR_372593].  
 2.  D istribution : 
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442504]. Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442505] 95% bound to 
plasma proteins. The mean apparent volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) is 
approximately 70 L in humans. Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442506] . 
 
3. Metabolism:   
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442507] (rat and dog) and humans. Furthermore , 
fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442508] S9 
preparations from multiple other human tissues including kidney, lung and ileum. Thus, it 
appears that the conversion of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442509]. In humans, fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442510] 30 minutes following the end of 
infusion.  
Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442511]. In vitro studies using human l iver 
microsomes indicate that aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442512]3A4 with minor 
metabolism by [CONTACT_097]1A2 and CYP2C19. Metabolism is largely via oxidation at the 
morpholine ring and its side chains. No metabolism by [CONTACT_097]2D6, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1 
was detected . In healthy young adults, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442513] 24% of the 
radioactivity in plasma over 72 hours following a single oral 300 -mg dose of [14C] -
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], indicating a substantial presence of metabolites in the plasma. Seven 
metabolites of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], which are only weakly active, have been identified in human 
plasma.  
4. Excretion : 
 
 7 Following administration of a single I.V. 100 -mg dose of [14C] -fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442514], 57% of the radioactivity was recovered in urine and 45% in feces.  Aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442515]; aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442516]. The apparent 
terminal half -life of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442517] [ADDRESS_562169] indicated that fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442518], with an adverse  
event profile comparable to both the oral aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (EMEND™) [ADDRESS_562170] common drug -related ad verse events in patients that were treated 
with aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442519]: hiccups, 
asthenia/fatigue, ALT increased, constipation, headache and anorexia. The adverse event 
profile was typi[INVESTIGATOR_442520]. Other 
symptoms  in patient receiving chemotherapy included fatigue. The incidence of clinical 
and laboratory adverse events were generally similar to the  Standard therapy regimen 
(ondansetron and dexamethasone) for both  groups.   Overall, EMEND™ is safe and well -
tolerated.  
    
E. Special Population  
 
1. Gender  
Following oral administration of a single 125 -mg dose of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], no difference in AUC 0-24hr 
was observed between males and females. The C max for aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61666] 16 % higher in females as 
compared with males. The half -life of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_61666] 25% lower in females as compared with 
males and T max occurs at approximately the same time. These differences are not considered 
clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment is neces sary based on gender.  
2. Geriatric  
Following oral administration of a single 125 -mg dose of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_388030] 1 and 80 mg once 
daily on Days 2 through 5, the AUC 0-24hr of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442521] 21% higher on Day 1 and 36% 
higher on Day 5 in  elderly (≥65 years) relative to younger adults. The C max was 10% higher on 
 
 8 Day 1 and 24% higher on Day 5 in elderly relative to younger adults. These differences are not 
considered clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patien ts. 
3. Pediatric  
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442522] 18 years of age.  
4. Race  
Following oral administration of a single 125 -mg dose of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], the AUC 0-24hr is 
approximately 25% and 29% higher in Hispanics as compared with Whites and  Blacks, 
respectively. The C max is 22% and 31% higher in Hispanics as compared with Whites and 
Blacks, respectively. These differences are not considered clinically meaningful. There was no 
difference in AUC 0-24hr or Cmax between Whites and Blacks. No dosa ge adjustment is 
necessary based on race.  
5. Hepatic Insufficiency  
Fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442523]; therefore hepatic insufficiency is not 
expected to alter the conversion of fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442524]. Oral aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442525] l tolerated 
in patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency. Following administration of a single 125 -
mg dose of oral aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_388030] 1 and 80 mg once daily on Days 2 and 3 to patients with mild 
hepatic insufficiency (Child -Pugh score 5 to 6), th e AUC 0-24hr of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442521] 11% lower on 
Day 1 and 36% lower on Day 3, as compared with healthy subjects given the same regimen. In 
patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child -Pugh score 7 to 9), the AUC 0-24hr of 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442521] 10% higher on Day 1 and 18% higher on Day 3, as compared with healthy 
subjects given the same regimen. These differences in AUC 0-24hr are not considered clinically 
meaningful; therefore, no dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate 
hepatic insufficien cy. There are no clinical or pharmacokinetic data in patients with severe 
hepatic insufficiency (Child -Pugh score >9)  
6. Renal Insufficiency  
A single 240 -mg dose of oral aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442526] (CrCl<30 mL/m in) and to patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring 
hemodialysis. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the AUC 0-∞ of total aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] 
(unbound and protein bound) decreased by 21% and C max decreased by 32%, relative to healthy 
subjects. In patients with ESRD undergoing hemodialysis, the AUC 0-∞ of total aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442527] 42% and C max decreased by 32%. Due to m odest decreases in protein binding of 
aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442528], the AUC of pharmacologically active unbound drug was 
not significantly affected in patients with renal insufficiency compared with healthy subjects. 
Hemodialysis conducted [ADDRESS_562171] on the 
pharmacokinetics of aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053]; less than 0.2% of the dose was recovered in the dialysate. No 
dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal insufficiency or for patients with ESRD 
undergoing  hemodialysis.

 [ADDRESS_562173] cycle. In the 
subsequent cycles  (cycle 2) , diary would be used to collect the epi[INVESTIGATOR_442531].  The patient may continue on treatment and to take IV 
fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442532] 2 if there is clinical benefit noted by [CONTACT_1275].   After cycle 2 only survival data will be collected.     
        
 
7.  Dose Adjustments  
 
      Fosa prepi[INVESTIGATOR_442533] t he Grade II toxicities th at 
is likely related to use of the study medication.  Fosa prepi[INVESTIGATOR_442534] .  Investigator can use NCI 
common toxicity criteria for any toxicity encountered that is not specificall y listed here and 
use instructions above.  Patients will be considered treatment failure if more then two 
vomiting occurs within an hour and will be treated using other antiemetics.  
 
 
8. Criteria for evaluation and Endpoint assessment  
 
Nausea and vomiting will be assessed in two different time periods

2. 25-120 hours will be defined as the delayed phase  
Emesis Response  
1. Complete: Defined as no emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_442535]  
2. Partial Response:  0-2 emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_442536]  
3. Failed Response: >2 emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_49591]/or use of rescue medications  
 
Patient will fill a diary from Days 1 -5 (5 days), documenting detail ed account of 
vomiting epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. Patient will be assessed for delayed vomiting on a follow up visit with 
the study investigators  or coordinator  on Days 3 .  
 
9. Reasons for removal from study  
a. Death  
b. Participant withdrawal  
c. Grade 3 -5 toxicity from fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053] (probably or definitely attributed to 
treatment) as judged by [CONTACT_83362]  
d. Non- compliance to study drug during cycle 1 or cycle 2  
 
10. Statistical Considerations  
 
 
10.1 Objectives  
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442537] (no emetic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865] 
 
 11 and no rescue medication) in the combined acute and delayed phase from [ADDRESS_562174] cycle of chemotherapy.  
 
The secondary objectives are to estimate the rates of control of a) acute and delayed 
vomiting and b) nausea ..  
 
The tertiary objective is to estimate overall survival of enrolled patients.  
This endpoint will be assessed every [ADDRESS_562175] 120 hours after fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442538].  
 
The secondary endpoints are a) control of acute and delayed vomiting  following 
fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442539]; b) control of acute and delayed nausea   during the first 
five days following fosaprepi[INVESTIGATOR_442539].  
 
The tertiary endpoints is overall survival defined as time of initiation of treatment 
until death or censor.  
 
10.3 Design  
 
A single stage optimal design was used for testing the null response (defined in the 
first paragraph in Section 10.1) rate (0.30) versus the alternative response rate  
(0.60). A sample size of 25 patients and a critical value of 12 responses results in a 
0.038 probability of concluding that the new treatment is effective, if the new 
treatment is actually not effective (Type I error). If the new treatment is actually 
effective, there is 0.922 power of concluding that it is effective. If the total number 
of patients who respond is 12 or more, then the response rate hypothesis under the 
null (0.30) is rejected in favor of the alternative (0.60). If the total number of

hypothesis is 0.30.  
 
10.4 Statistical Analysis of the Primary Endpoint  
 
If the total number of patients who respond is 12 or more, then the response rate 
hypothesis under the null (0 .30) is rejected in favor of the alternative (0.60). If the 
total number of patients who respond is [ADDRESS_562177] that the 
response rate hypothesis is 0.30.  
 
 
10.5 Statistical Analyses of the Secondary Endpoints  
 
The secondary endpoints (control of acute and delayed vomiting, control of nausea 
and toxicity) will be described with a point estimate and  a Wilson’s two -sided 90% 
confidence interval .  
 
10.6 Statistical Analyses of the Tertiary Endpoint

The response rate will be described with a po int estimate and  a Wilson’s two -sided 
90% confidence interval.  The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the 
survival curve for overall survival.

patients will be evaluated for toxicity. We would recommend reconsidering the study 
for safety reasons if there were X many occurrences of grade 3 or higher toxicity 
(using the CTCAE guidelines) among the first N (or fewer) patients tre ated, as it 
would result in an upper confidence limit greater than 0. 25: 
 
N X p UCL  
8 1 0.125  0.255  
13 2 0.154  0.256  
18 3 0.167  0.253  
22 4 0.182  0.261  
27 5 0.185  0.256  
    
    
    
 
In the above table, N = the number of patients treated; X = the cu mulative number of 
patients with a grade 3 or higher toxicity currently observed; p = the observed toxicity  
rate; and UCL = the exact 1 -sided upper 80% confidence limit for p, using Wilson's 
method without a continuity correction . 
 
 
11. Study Administratio n and Investigator Obligations  
a. Review Boards  
The study must have the approval of the Protocol Review and Monitoring 
Committee of the Clinical Trials Office at the Karmanos Cancer Institute 
and of the Wayne State University Institutional Review Board (IRB) . 
b.  Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to design the Informed Consent 
form.  The consent form has been designed using appropriate National or 
Regional guidelines (equivalent to the American Federal Guidelines 
(Federal Register Jul y 27, 1981 or 21 CFR Part 50)  
c. Adverse Events  
 
 13 Definitions:  A serious adverse event is any experience that suggests 
significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution.  A serious 
adverse event includes any experience that:  
1. Is fatal or immedia tely life threatening  
2. Is severely or permanently disabling  
3. Requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442540]’s medical record.  The 
adverse reactions must be reported to the data manager’s office, principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_442541]:  
1.Unexpected and/or severe toxicities: any unexpected Grade 2 or 3  
toxicity (not previously reported in the literature or package insert) 
must be reported in writing on an Adverse Drug Reaction Form to the 
data manager’s office.  Any Grade [ADDRESS_562179] be reported by 
[CONTACT_442551]’ office within [ADDRESS_562180] be sent to the data manager’s 
office.  
2. Deaths:  within 30 days of study medication should be reported  
except if cause is secondary to cancer progression . 
3. Adverse Event reporting to the FDA:  
FDA shall be notified by [CONTACT_36983] -threatening experience associated with the use of 
the drug as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 calendar days after 
the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.  Each telephone call or 
facsimile transmission to FDA shall be transmitted to the FDA review 
division that has responsibility fo r review of the IND.  Principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_442542] a 
written IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the 
use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  Each notification shall 
be made as soon as possible and in no event later than 15 calendar days 
after initial report of the information.  Each written notification may be 
submitted on FDA Form 3500A or in a narrative format and shall bear 
prominent identification of its contents, i. e., “IND Safety Report.”  Each 
written notification to FDA shall be transmitted along with a FDA Form 
1571 to the FDA division that has responsibility for review of the IND.  If 
FDA determines that additional data are needed, the agency may require 
further  data to be submitted.  In each written IND safety report, the 
investigator shall identify all safety reports previously filed with the IND 
concerning a similar adverse experience, and shall analyze the significance 
of the adverse experience in light of th e previous, similar reports.  
d. Termination of Study  
Specific instances that may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_442543]:  The incidence 
and/or severity of adverse drug experiences in this or other studies 
indicating a potential health hazard caused by [CONTACT_8235].  
e. Study Amendments  
If the protocol requires an amendment, the amendment must be submitted to 
the IRB for approval together with a revised consent form, if applicable.

 15 APPENDIX 2: DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING PLAN  
 
Adverse Event Reporting:  
Unexpected Grade 4 or 5 toxicities are to be reported to the Karmanos Clinical Trial Data 
Management Office  by [CONTACT_756] (313 -576-9385 ) within [ADDRESS_562181]  if it meets reporting requirements .  
 
Patient safety will be monitored by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_442544](s) on a monthly basis. At 
this time the safety of protocol participants, i.e., adverse event reporting  will be reviewed.   
[COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme Corp. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) will be  
provided with copi[INVESTIGATOR_140606], regardless of causality, within two  
working days. Additionally, any pregnancy occurring in as sociation with use of a [COMPANY_006] Product  
will be reported to [COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme Corp. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 
993-1220). A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports is submitted as required 
by [CONTACT_8415], European Union (EU), Pharmaceu tical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other 
local regulators by [CONTACT_093]. This submission will be cross referenced according to local  
regulations to the [COMPANY_006] Investigational Compound Number (IND, CSA, etc.) at the time of  
submission. Addition ally, a copy of these reports will be submitted to [COMPANY_006] Sharp & Dohme  
Corp. (Attn: Worldwide Product Safety; FAX 215 993 -1220) at the time of submission to FDA.  
In studies involving human subjects, serious adverse experience means any experience that  
sugg est a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution. A serious adverse  
experience includes any experience that is fatal or immediately life threatening, results in a  
persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires or prolongs in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or is  
a congenital anomaly, cancer, or overdose. Other important medical events that may not result in 
death, not be life -threatening, or not require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the 
subject/patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed previously.  
 
Quarterly reporting of summary data will be provided to th e Data and Safety Monit oring 
Committee for oversight of monitoring. Overall assessment of accrual, toxicities and responses 
will be done at this time to determine whether significant benefits or risks are occurring that 
would warrant study closure. Adherence to the protocol, i.e ., protocol violations, and data 
completeness and integrity will also be reviewed at this time.  
 
One month prior to anniversary date of the IRB original approval, a yearly summary report of 
trial activities will be made to all participating co -investigator s and the Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee. This report will include the number of patients on the trial, the number 
of patients treated, a summary of all adverse events reported to date using CTC 3.0 grading 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf),  a specific list of serious adverse events requiring 
immediate reporting and any significant developments that may affect the safety of the 
participants or ethics of the study.

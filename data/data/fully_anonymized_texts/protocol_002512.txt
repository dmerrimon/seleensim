2. JUSTIFICATION FOR THE DESIGN OF THE CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
2.1. BACKGROUND
2.1.1. Dentin Hypersensitivity
Dentin hypersensitivity (DHS) is characterized as exposed dentin in which brief, sharp pain 
occurs in response to stimuli (eg, thermal and/or tactile stimulus) and cannot be ascribed to any 
other form of dentin defect.1  DHS is a fairly common affliction for adults, with one study 
showing 21.3% of Subjects (163 of 767) with DHS in response to tactile stimulus and 38.6% 
of Subjects (296 of 767) with DHS in response to air-blast stimulus (ie, cold air exposure).2  
Not surprisingly, non-carious cervical lesions and gingival recession were significantly 
associated with DHS in response to both tactile and air stimulus (P ≤ 0.02) in the 
aforementioned population, and female sex was significantly associated with DHS in response 
to air-blast stimulus (P < 0.01).2  
There are currently two modes of action for agents used to manage DHS: (i) blocking pulpal 
nerve response or (ii) dentine tubule occlusion with resistance to removal by [CONTACT_817933].3  
Fluoride (F-)-containing products, including those that are self-administered (eg, pastes and 
rinses) and those that are professionally applied (eg, varnishes and gels), have been shown to 
relieve DHS via the second mode of action through the formation of precipi[INVESTIGATOR_14263] (eg, calcium-
phosphorous, calcium fluoride, and fluorapatite).4-6  The focus of this study is to compare two 
professionally applied F-containing products, one of which contains a hexane-based solvent 
and the other a novel aqueous solution (Clinpro™  2.1% Sodium Fluoride Aqueous 
Solution), on changes in DHS.     
2.1.2. Desensitizing F- containing Agents in the Treatment of DHS
Previous publications reporting clinical trial results for the impact of professionally applied F--
containing products (with more than 1% F- in the product) on DHS in at least one arm of the 
trial date back to the early 1990s,7 with 22 clinical trials assessing DHS since that time.7-28  One 
publication had an inconsistent description of methods and study results, which made a 
meaningful interpretation of the data impractical.8  In addition, three other studies are not 
relevant for this trial since the F--containing products were used along with an adjunctive 
therapy (eg, subsequent laser treatment or iontophoresis)7,[ADDRESS_1132691] on

[IP_ADDRESS].IMPACT OF 2% FLUORIDE GELS ON IMMEDIATE CHANGE IN DHS
Each of the 5 publications that assessed an immediate change in pain for study teeth with DHS 
used cold-air stimulus (ie, air blast stimulus) as part of the assessments.  In one of the studies, 
a verbal response scale (VRS) was used to assess pain, whereby a “0” indicated the absence of 
pain and a “4” indicated unbearable pain.23  Similar VRS scores were observed for 18 teeth 
before (2.5 ± 0.514) and immediately after (2.56 ± 0.511) application of the 2% F- gel.23  In the 
other four studies using 2% F-gels in one of the study arms, a visual analog scale (VAS) ranging 
from 0 to 10 cm (or 100 mm) was used to measure pain levels, whereby a “0” indicated no pain 
and a “10” (ie, 10 cm or 100 mm on the scale) indicated unbearable pain.14,21,26,28  In a study 
with a sample size of 27 teeth treated with 2% F-gel, Soares et al observed a mean (± standard 
deviation, or SD) reduction in the VAS score of 2.5 cm (± 1.86 cm) points immediately after 
product application when compared with the baseline score (P = 0.001).28  In a sample size of 
65 teeth treated with 2% F- gel, Femiano et al observed a change in the mean (range of single 
VAS values for the group) VAS score from 6.4 cm (±4 cm) at baseline to 3.2 cm (±5 cm) 
immediately after gel application (P < 0.001).14  Similarly, Lund et al described a reduction in 
the mean VAS score from 6.1 cm (variance or range not provided) at baseline to 4.1 cm when 
assessed 5 minutes after application of a 2% sodium fluoride gel (P < 0.05).[ADDRESS_1132694] (ETAB); for teeth treated with 
2% F- gel, there was an increased ETAB from 4.[ADDRESS_1132695] application (P < 0.05).21  Lastly, Pamir et al observed a change 
in the mean (± standard error, or SE) VAS score (n = 30 teeth) from 5.0 cm (± 0.3 cm) at 
baseline to 1.7 cm (± 0.3 cm) immediately after application of the 2% sodium fluoride gel (P < 
0.05).26  In this study, the change in VAS scores in response to tactile stimulus was also 
examined, and a change in the mean (± SE) VAS score from 4.1 cm (± 0.2 cm) at baseline to 
1.1 cm (± 0.3 cm) immediately after application of the 2% sodium fluoride gel was observed 
(P < 0.05).26
[IP_ADDRESS].IMPACT OF 5% FLUORIDE VARNISHES ON IMMEDIATE CHANGE IN DHS
Previous clinical trials reporting on the immediate impact of 5% F- varnishes on DHS have 
assessed the response to cold-air stimulus and/or tactile stimulus.  Pain assessments were made 
using a VAS scale (described in Section [IP_ADDRESS]), a calibrated Yeaple probe (for tactile stimulus) 
that was used to measure the amount of pressure in grams (g) until the Subject felt discomfort, 
or the Schiff scale, depending on the trial.  For the Schiff scale, scoring categories included:

“0”, indicating no response to the stimulus, “1”, indicating the Subject responded to the stimulus 
but did not request its discontinuation, “2”, indicating the Subject responded to the stimulus and 
requested its discontinuation or moved away from the stimulus, and “3”, indicating that the 
Subject considered the stimulus painful and requested its discontinuation.  
In 2003, Corona et al reported the number of Subjects (n = 30) within each Schiff category in 
response to air blast stimulus both before and immediately after application of a 5% F- varnish.  
Before treatment, there were no (0) Subjects with a score of “0”, 11 Subjects with a score of 
“1”, 13 Subjects with a score of “2”, and 6 with a score of “3”.  Immediately after treatment, 
11 Subjects had a score of “0”, 6 had a score of “1”, ten had a score of “2”, and 3 had a score 
of “3”.[ADDRESS_1132696] of a 5% F- varnish on

treatment to 30.5 mm (± 28.51 mm) after treatment, and the mean (± SD) Schiff score was 
reduced from 2.32 (± 0.72) at pre-treatment to 0.91 (± 1.0) after treatment (P < 0.05).9   In a 
study of 36 teeth treated with a 5% F- varnish, Eyüboğlu et al showed a significant reduction in 
VAS upon air blast stimulus (P < 0.001), changing from 56.39 mm (± 19.91) at baseline to 10

the amount of pressure (ie, tactile stimulus) before the Subject felt discomfort (P < 0.01), 
changing from 18.89 g (± 12.1 g) at baseline to 32.78 g (± 23.49 g) immediately after 
treatment.13  Finally, Machado et al observed a significant reduction in VAS (P < 0.05) in 
response to air blast stimulus, with a mean (± SD) VAS of 5.9 cm (± 1.5 cm) at baseline versus 
3.4 cm (± 2.4 cm) immediately after treatment.22  In this study, a significant reduction in VAS 
(p < 0.05) was also seen for teeth (n = 38) treated with a F--containing ionomeric sealant, with 
a mean (± SD) VAS of 6.7 cm (± 1.7 cm) at baseline and 3.4 cm (± 2.5 cm) immediately after 
treatment.22                 
2.2. RATIONALE FOR STUDYING THE SPECIFIC POPULATION/CONDITION
Subjects with at least one tooth with DHS, defined as having a baseline VAS score of at least 
[ADDRESS_1132697] stimuli, were selected as the specific population/condition for 
this study since desensitizing agents are commonly used to treat DHS (see Section 2.1.1).  
Subjects with surrounding teeth or tissues with painful pathology or defects are being excluded 
in an effort to eliminate the potential for pain from an area other than the study tooth (ie, to not 
impact VAS scores from the study tooth itself).  Similarly, teeth with previous restorations or 
periodontal treatments are being excluded to limit other potential causes of tooth pain.

initial application of the investigational device (Treatment arm) or control device (Control arm).  
Due to the nature of the investigative device, the duration of treatment application, and the study 
design, Investigator blinding is not feasible for the study.  For Subjects with multiple eligible 
teeth, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_817923]; however, this selection must be made prior to randomization.  Randomization 
of the Subjects will be performed using a permuted block technique and will be centralized and

6.6.6. Treatments
[IP_ADDRESS].WASHOUT PERIOD
All Subjects will undergo a pre-treatment washout period for 3- to 6-weeks (± 4 days) post-
enrollment.  During this time, the Subject is to only use the oral hygiene products (Colgate 
Cavity Protection Fluoride Toothpaste - Great Regular Flavor 0.15% w/v Fluoride Ion, Colgate 
Company and Oral-B® Indicator™ Toothbrush, Sensitive 35 Extra Soft, Procter & Gamble 
Company) provided for the study, except for floss; beginning immediately after the consent 
visit.  The Subject should perform tooth brushing during this period with the sponsor-provided 
toothbrush and toothpaste as directed by [CONTACT_737].  In addition, the Subject should refrain 
from taking prescription or OTC analgesic medications for [ADDRESS_1132720]-treatment visits.  Any use of analgesics within 48 h prior to treatment visit should 
be documented on concomitant medications CRF.
[IP_ADDRESS].BASELINE PAIN ASSESSMENTS AND TREATMENT APPLICATIONS
The study tooth for Subjects in both arms of the study will be isolated from neighboring teeth 
according to standard dental practices (eg, VPS putty or cotton rolls)  and should remain isolated 
during pain assessment. Isolation materials may be removed during treatment application; 
however, the study tooth should remain clean and free of excess saliva for the application of 
the product. The method of isolation should be documented and should remain consistent for 
each study visit.  After isolation of the study tooth, a pain assessment will be performed (ie, a 
baseline pain score) in response to both an air-blast stimulus and tactile stimulus.  For the air-
blast stimulus, a pressure-calibrated air syringe should be placed perpendicular to the center 
cementoenamel junction (CEJ) of the study tooth.  With the tip of the syringe placed 
approximately 1 cm from the tooth, the syringe is to be fully activated for 1 second.    For the

continuum between “no pain”, indicated by 0 mm on the scale, and “worst pain”, indicated by 
[ADDRESS_1132722], with a minimum of 3 minutes between tests.
After recording baseline pain scores, isolation should be maintained and excess saliva should 
be removed.  Immediately apply Clinpro™ 2.1% Sodium Fluoride Aqueous Solution 
(Treatment arm) or Vanish™ 5% Sodium Fluoride White Varnish (Control arm) as described 
in Sections [IP_ADDRESS].1 or [IP_ADDRESS].2, respectively.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. TREATMENT GROUP
After ensuring that the study tooth is clean and free of excess saliva, Clinpro™  2.1% Sodium 
Fluoride Aqueous Solution should be applied to the tooth using the applicator brush, according 
to the manufacturer’s IFU.  The product should be applied to the tooth in a thin layer, reloading 
the applicator brush as needed.  Only enough product should be used to form a thin coating on 
the desired treatment area, and it is not necessary to use all the product provided. After the 
application, any excess material or saliva may be suctioned from the mouth or the Subject may 
spit.  To achieve the maximum benefit, the Subject should avoid food, beverages, and oral rinses 
for 15 minutes after application.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. CONTROL GROUP
After ensuring that the study tooth of Subjects randomized to the Control group is clean and 
free of excess saliva, 3MTM Vanish™ 5% Sodium Fluoride White Solution should be applied 
to the tooth using the applicator brush, according to the IFU.  Before application, use the brush 
to thoroughly mix the varnish since components of all sodium fluoride varnishes can separate 
during storage.  The product should be applied to the study tooth in a thin layer, applying the 
varnish in sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_817924].  
Only enough varnish to form a thin coating should be used on the desired application area.  
After application, the Subject should close their mouth to allow the varnish to set and rinsing 
or suctioning immediately after application is not recommended.  To achieve the maximum 
benefit after application, the Subject should not brush or floss the teeth for at least [ADDRESS_1132723] should also eat soft foods and should

No other treatments for the study tooth other than those described in Section 6.6.6 are permitted 
during the course of this study.  Any divergence from these treatment conditions will be 
captured as a protocol deviation (see Section 10) and the reason for selecting alternative 
treatments in the absence of an AE or device defect should be documented.  Study visits that 
occur outside of the study visit windows will also be documented as protocol deviations.  In 
addition, Subjects should avoid the following from the time of tooth treatment until completion 
of the study to ensure the oral hygiene activities and products used are controlled prior to and 
throughout the study:
•Refrain from additional desensitizing treatments after application of the study product.
•Refrain from activities that would impair the function of the products, including:

6.8. ROLE OF SPONSOR REPRESENTATIVE
6.8.1. Monitoring 
Study monitoring is conducted to ensure that (i) the rights, safety, and well-being of study 
participants are protected, (ii) the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, 
and (iii) the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved CIP, with good 
clinical practice (GCP) principles, and with applicable regulatory requirement(s).  3M, as 
Sponsor of this clinical investigation, is responsible for study oversight and for providing the 
Principal Investigators (PIs) and study staff with training regarding the proper conduct of the 
clinical investigation with regard to CIP adherence and validity of the data recorded on the 
CRFs.  3M has therefore assigned study monitor(s) to this clinical investigation.  The progress 
of the clinical investigation will be monitored by:
•Periodic and/or remote review
•Telephone communications 
•Review of CRFs and source documents (eg subject records)
The study monitor(s), other authorized representatives of the Sponsor, representatives of the 
IRB, or regulatory authorities may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained 
by [CONTACT_737], including but not limited to Subject records (office, clinic, or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) for 
the participants in this study.  The clinical study site personnel will permit access to such 
records.  The Investigator will give 3M study monitor(s) direct access to source documents that 
support data on the CRFs, including any electronic records.  If site policies restrict access to 
Subjects’ files to site personnel, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_817925] a staff member to work with the Sponsor’s 
monitor to verify source documents on an as-needed basis.  This verification will be conducted 
in a way that will ensure that only study-related information is examined.
Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a Monitoring Plan (MP).  The MP 
describes who will conduct the monitoring, the planned frequency of monitoring visits, records 
to be reviewed, and the distribution of monitoring reports.

7. DATA MANAGEMENT
Data collected for this study will be analyzed and stored at 3M or an approved supplier for use 
by [CONTACT_817939].  Permission to transmit, store and use data 
outside of the study will be included in the informed consent.  Details of data management for 
this investigation are documented in a Data Management Plan (DMP).  The DMP describes the 
procedures used for CRF tracking, data review, database cleaning, query management, coding 
and data reconciliation.
7.1. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical study staff at the site under the supervision 
of the site Investigator.  The Investigator is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, 
legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.
All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible, permanent and un-editable manner 
to ensure accurate interpretation of data.  Data recorded in the electronic case report form 
(eCRF) derived from source documents must be consistent with the data recorded on the source 
documents. 
All data, including AEs and expected AE data, will be entered into a [ADDRESS_1132737] protection 
and internal quality checks (eg, automatic range checks) to identify data that appear 
inconsistent, incomplete, or inaccurate.
The Sponsor is responsible for compi[INVESTIGATOR_817926], retention 
of the clinical study database, performance of statistical analysis, and preparation of the clinical 
study report.

8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
8.1. PASS/FAIL CRITERIA
The null hypotheses that we seek to reject are that Vanish™ 5% Sodium Fluoride White Varnish 
has a 15.0 mm higher change from baseline VAS than Clinpro™ 2% Sodium Fluoride Aqueous 
Solution when measured immediately after application (within [ADDRESS_1132739]-treatment) or at 
24-hours after treatment (±4 hours).  The null and alternate hypotheses are described below.
H0: Vanish™ Varnish changed from baseline – Clinpro™ 2.1% Sodium Fluoride Aqueous 
Solution change from baseline >15 mm.
Ha: Vanish™ Varnish changed from baseline – Clinpro™ 2.1% Sodium Fluoride Aqueous 
Solution change from baseline  ≤15 mm.

be used.  There is uncertainty in the efficacy difference between treatments as well as the error 
term.  An interim analysis will be conducted at approximately 50% of subject treatment to 
reassess sample size with no alpha spending required.  Ninety-six (96; 48 per arm) total subjects 
will provide 80% power allowing for a [ADDRESS_1132743] 
application and change in hypersensitivity 24-hours after application.   For the secondary and 
exploratory endpoints, all dosed subjects without a major protocol deviation occurring up to the 
evaluation time for each endpoint will be included in the analysis dataset for that endpoint.  All 
treated subjects will be included in the safety analysis dataset. Major protocol deviation(s) for 
exclusion from the analysis dataset will be defined and documented in a blinded fashion prior 
to interim and final analyses (eg, inadequate washout).
8.4. STATISTICAL ANALYSES
8.4.1. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics for the study will be generated and displayed by 
[CONTACT_166884].  Key baseline characteristics variables may include but are not 
limited to general health status, baseline pain, and any specific factors that may affect the 
change in pain after treatment.  
8.4.2. Analysis of Primary Endpoints
At the final analysis, multiplicity will be controlled through a Hochberg procedure.  Ninety-
five- percent (95%) confidence intervals will be generated for the difference between treatments

in change from baseline immediately after application and separately for the difference between 
treatments in change from baseline 24-hours after application using Student’s t distribution.  
Scenario 1:  Neither of the 95% confidence intervals contain 15 mm.
Result: Non-inferiority for both co-primary endpoints will be declared 
Scenario 2:  Both of the 95% confidence intervals contain 15 mm.
Result:  No non-inferiority for either co-primary endpoints will be declared, and all analyses 
will be informational only.
Scenario 3:  One confidence interval contains 15 mm, and the other confidence interval does 
not contain 15 mm.
The endpoint that does not contain 15 mm has the potential to be declared non-inferior.  For 
this endpoint, as part of the Hochberg procedure, a 97.5% confidence interval will be generated.  
Non-inferiority for this endpoint will be declared if the new confidence interval does not contain 
[ADDRESS_1132744] for non-inferiority of Clinpro™ 2.1% Sodium Fluoride Aqueous Solution to Vanish™ 
Varnish for the various secondary endpoints.  Ninety five percent (95%) confidence intervals 
will be generated for the difference between treatments in change from baseline using the 
Student’s t distribution at each evaluation time.  Non-inferiority will be declared if Vanish™ 
Varnish changed from baseline minus Clinpro™ 2.1% Sodium Fluoride Aqueous Solution 
change from baseline is less than or equal to 15 mm for each secondary endpoint. There are 3 
secondary endpoints.  The alpha will be passed sequentially in the order listed in section 5.3.2.
8.4.4. Analysis of Additional/Exploratory Endpoints
Ninety five percent (95%) confidence intervals will be generated for the difference between 
treatments in change from baseline using a Student’s distribution at each evaluation time.  No 
non-inferiority will be declared.

8.5. PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSES AND CRITERIA FOR CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
An interim analysis will be conducted after treating approximately 50% of the planned sample 
size for the purpose of sample size re-estimation.  No alpha will need to be spent because of 
this sample size re-estimation.  The parameter estimates from the interim data will be used and 
the sample size necessary for 80% power will be calculated.
8.6. PROCEDURES FOR REPORTING DEVIATIONS FROM STATISTICAL PLAN
Any deviations from the original plan will be described and justified in the final report.
8.7. PROCEDURES FOR MISSING, UNUSED, OR SPURIOUS DATA 
If a subject withdraws, only the data up to withdrawal will be used.  There will be no imputation 
of missing outcome data.  Any non-use of data will be explained and justified in the final report. 
8.8. VALIDATION PLAN
The results of this study will be used for registration, therefore level 2 validation of the statistical 
programs and output will be performed.  Level 2 validation entails independent review of logs, 
output, program code, and report results.
9. AMENDMENTS TO THE CIP
If modifications to this CIP are necessary (eg, to protect the safety of the Subjects and/or the 
integrity of the data), the CIP will be amended and approved by [CONTACT_1034].  All changes will 
be evaluated for impact per the standard operating procedures of the Sponsor.  In collaboration 
with the Investigator(s), the CIP modifications will then be documented and submitted for 
ethical and regulatory approval (as required) before implementation.  Modifications will be 
considered implemented after all ethical and regulatory approvals (as required) are received and

13.3. DETAILS CONCERNING SAFETY RECORDING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
13.3.1. Investigator Responsibilities
It is the responsibility of each participating Investigator to ensure all safety events (eg, AEs, 
SAEs, device effects, or DDs) are recorded in the Subject’s record.  The collection/reporting 
period for safety events will begin from the time of randomization through the end of the 
study.  Investigators should assess for AEs at each visit after randomization, and study 
Subjects should be instructed to report any AE that they experience to the Investigator.  All 
AEs, regardless of perceived relationship to study product, will be documented in a timely 
manner and reported according to the methods and timelines in Section 13.4.  In addition, 
the worsening of an underlying medical condition should also be recorded as an AE.  The 
AE description will include the nature of the experience (AE term), the start date, the end 
date, the severity of each sign or symptom, the seriousness of the event or experience, the 
relationship to study treatment, the course of action taken, and the outcome of the experience.  
It will be indicated if the AE caused the Subject to be discontinued from the study.
[LOCATION_003]DEs must be reported by [CONTACT_817942] 24 hours of becoming aware of the event 
(see Table 13.4-1).  In addition to submitting UADEs to the IRB, the Investigators will, along 
with the Sponsor, decide to continue, suspend, or terminate the study.
13.3.2. Sponsor Responsibilities
Safety oversight will be under the direction of the Medical Monitor and Safety Monitor of 
3M, which both have appropriate expertise.  The Clinical Trial Safety Officer and Senior 
Medical Director will routinely review and assesses the safety data of the study.  Emergency 
contact [CONTACT_817943], as well as the IRB, before initiating the study.
The Sponsor will evaluate the received AEs/SAEs and if an event is confirmed to be an 
SAE/[LOCATION_003]DE, will then immediately conduct an evaluation of a [LOCATION_003]DE and report the 
results of the evaluation to the FDA and participating Investigators within [ADDRESS_1132750] receives notice of the event (21 CFR 812.46(b), 812.150).  If the 
Sponsor determines that the event presents an unreasonable risk to the study Subjects, the 
Sponsor will terminate all clinical studies or parts of studies presenting risk as soon as 
possible.

Any AEs that are not device-related and are ongoing at the end of the study should be marked 
as “persistent” per the eCRF.  Any AEs that are device-related and ongoing at the end of the 
study may be followed for an additional 30 calendar days, as medically necessary.  Any Events 
ongoing at the end of this 30-day period should be marked as “persistent” per the eCRF.  Events 
reported by [CONTACT_817947] [ADDRESS_1132753] completes participation in the study.
14. VULNERABLE POPULATION
This study is intended to be conducted using a non-vulnerable adult population (ie, 18 years of 
age or older) with no expectations of benefits associated with participation or of a retaliatory 
response from senior hierarchical members in case of refusal to participate.  In addition, the 
study includes only Subjects that are capable of and can provide informed consent.  However, 
the study does not exclude economically or educationally disadvantaged persons.  The 
protection of rights, well-being, and safety of vulnerable populations is the most important 
consideration and should take precedent over the interests of the study.  In addition, the 
protection of rights, well-being, and safety of vulnerable populations, and ascertaining 
appended safeguards, are the prerogative of the IRB, and the Investigator should comply with 
all institutional guidelines related to vulnerable populations.
In the recruitment process, the Investigator will ensure that Subject recruitment is free from 
pressure and will respect the Subject’s expectations of privacy.  Participation will be presented 
as a voluntary option.  In addition, the screening process will contain procedures to assess the 
pregnancy status of females of childbearing age (self-reported) as well as the decisional 
capacity of potential study Subjects.  The study will be described to all potential Subjects by 
[CONTACT_817948]-technical terms, and the ICF will be written in an essentially non-
technical manner to suit the solicited community.  The study will be presented in a manner that 
permits ample time for consideration of participation, with no undue pressure related to the 
timing of the request.

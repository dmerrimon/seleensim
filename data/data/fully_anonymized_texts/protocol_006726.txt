censoring defined as the time from infusion to the first of any of the following events: 
no response, relapse, death due to any cause, or to the last day of follow up if no 
event occurs. All analyses will be performed for cohort A and B separately. Kaplan -
Meier (KM) curves will be generated and one- sample Log -rank test will be used to 
test the [ADDRESS_474624] the historical rate. One -year EFS and its 95% confidence 
interval (CI) will also be estimated based on the KM method. For cohort A, the null 
hypothesis is 40% 1 -year EFS and the alternative hypothesis is 60% 1 -year EFS. The 
sample size of 52 provides 95% power to test this hypothesis, using a one -sided one -
sample Log -rank test with 10% type I error, assuming [ADDRESS_474625] . For cohort B, the null hypothesis is 15% 1 -year EFS and the alternative 
hypothesis is 30% 1 -year EFS. The sample size of 48 provides 91% power to test this 
hypothesis, using a one -sided one -sample Log -rank test with 10% type I erro r, 
assuming [ADDRESS_474626] that we could infuse 
approximately 85% of enrolled subjects , so we will enroll approximately 62 subjects 
for cohort A and approximately 54  subjects for cohort B to obtain the targeted 
number of in fused subjects .

 INTRODUCTION 
While survival rates in children with de novo B -ALL approach 90%,2 subgroups of patients at very high risk 
(VHR) of relapse are in need of novel therapeutic approaches. Many of these patients can be identified 
early in therapy by [CONTACT_379205].  Refractory ALL poses a therapeutic challenge, with long -
term survival close to 30%  for patients who do not achieve remission with induction chemotherapy 
(induction failure) .3 Survival rates for children who experience early medullary relapse of B-ALL, defined 
as a marrow relapse within 36 months of diagnosis, are equally poor, with EFS rates <30% reported.[ADDRESS_474627] not improved measurably in 30 years.5,6 Even for patients 
who achieve a second remission, those remissions are frequently not sustained,4,7 and with each 
subsequent relapse, achieving remission is harder, and long -term survival is extremely poor.4 
 
Intensive chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_379206]  (HSCT)  [ADDRESS_474628] demonstrated suboptimal outcomes; therefore, we hypothesize that these leukemias may be chemo -refractory.  
 Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) has emerged as a powerful technology producing dramatic responses in patients with highly refractory malignancies. Our 
group and others have shown complete remission (CR) rates of 70 -93% in children and adults with 
relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
1,11-15,16,17.  Outcomes using autologous T cells 
expressing a  murine CAR  directed at CD19 (CAR T19) in a large multicenter trial of 75 patients (median 
survival not reached) led to the 2017 FDA approval of this agent in pediatric and young adult patients with 
r/r disease17. Remission for some patients with CTL019 have been durable even without a consolidative  
HSCT 16,17. However, a subset of patients do not respond or relapse due to poor CAR T cell expansion and 
persistence.  Approximately 20% of patients demonstrate early recovery of CD19 -expressing B cells,18 a 
surrogate marker of CD19 -directed CAR T cell loss, within 6 months of CART19  infusion. Without further 
therapy, early loss of CAR T cells confers an increased risk of CD19+ relapse.  Options for patients who do 
not respond or relapse after prior engineered cell therapy are extremely limited.  
 
We have assessed a humanized version o f CART19 , called huCART19, in a Phase 1 trial at the Children’s 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP). The 13BT022 trial evaluated huCART19 in CAR -naïve subjects as well as 
subjects who had previously received anti -CD19 CARs, either CTL019 at CHOP or another ant i-CD19 CAR 
elsewhere. Clinical success was seen on this trial in both patient subsets.  
 Based on our previous success and lack of clinical options in patients with very high risk ( VHR ) ALL, w e 
propose to test huCART19 as an alternative treatment approach,  in newly diagnosed B -ALL patients 
predicted to have an exceedingly poor outcome with conventional chemoth erapy,  in high -risk first 
relapse , and in second or greater relapse  in this  phase 2 trial (Cohort A) . In addition, a second cohort 
(Cohort B) will test the efficacy of huCART19 in patients with poor response to prior B cell directed 
engineered cell therapy.

 Back ground  
 Engineered T cells with redirected specificity: chimeric antigen 
receptors (CAR)  
CAR T cells are patient -derived lymphocytes transfected with a gene encoding a chimeric transmembrane 
receptor that enables recognition of target cell- surface antigens with high specificity in a non -MHC 
restricted manner, coupl ing antigen -binding with intracellular signals that promote T cell effector 
functions19,20. The extracellular component of CARs typi[INVESTIGATOR_379157] -binding domains from 
the heavy and light chains of an antibody configured as a single -chain (i.e., a single -chain variable 
fragment, or scFv). The intracellular component typi[INVESTIGATOR_379158] T 
cell activation (as reviewed21,22). The CAR T cells used in this study are so -called second -generation CARs 
that incorporate the TCRζ and [ADDRESS_474629] reported by [CONTACT_379207]. using CART19/CTL019 in patients with advanced, treatment -refractory CLL
23,24. This was followed by [CONTACT_379208]19/CTL019 in 
ALL16,17 and non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma25, along with reports from other centers evaluating anti- CD19 CAR 
T cells (as  reviewed  26,27).  
 Response rates and duration of response to CAR T cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_379159], however, even among 
the various CD19+ malignancies treated with anti- CD19 CARs.  Therefore, the design of this study is 
informed by [CONTACT_379209]22 and CART19 in previous 
studies.
 
 CD19 as a therapeutic target for B cell leukemia and lymphoma  
CD19 is a 95kDa glycoprotein present on B cells from early development until differentiation into plasma cells
28-30. It is a membe r of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and a component of a cell surface signal 
transduction complex that regulates signal transduction through the B cell receptor30-32. Mice lacking CD19 
have a decreased number of B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, a decreased B cell response to oral vaccines and mitogens, and decreased serum Ig levels
30,33. Expression of CD19 is restricted to B lineage 
cells and is not expressed by [CONTACT_379210]29. CD19 is also expressed by [CONTACT_304900] B cell 
lymphomas, mantl e cell lymphoma, ALLs, CLLs, hairy cell leukemias, and a subset of acute myelogenous 
leukemias28,34,35. CD19 thus represents a highly attractive target for immunotherapy29. Furthermore, CD19 
is not present on most normal tissues, other than normal B cells, including pluripotent blood stem cells29, 
which makes CD19 a relatively safe target presenting a minimal risk of autoimmune disease or irreversible myelotoxicity. Anti -CD19  antibodies and scFvs either native or conjugated to radioisotopes or toxins are 
currently being developed and have demonstrated promise in both mouse models
36-[ADDRESS_474630] as “cytokine sinks”, 
enhancing the availability of cytokines such as IL -7 and IL -15 that are important for T cell proliferation and 
survival54. This  concept was initially demonstrated clinically using ex -vivo-expanded tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes in patients with metastatic melanoma; in these patients, pre- treatment with

and clinical activity55.  
 
Lymphodepleting chemotherapy has be come  standard for  CAR T cell treatment . While initial studies 
allowed investigators to choose among  chemotherapy regimens based on patients’  prior treatment 
histories, more recent studies have been more prescriptive with the recognition that the lymphodepletion regimen affects clinical activity and toxicity. For example, Turtle et al. compared results o btained in 
sequential cohorts of non- Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with a CD28- based second -generation 
anti-CD19 CAR following cyclophosphamide with or without fludarabine (Cy vs Cy/Flu )
56. Subjects 
receiving Cy/Flu were more likely to have a complete response (50% vs 8%) and exhibited more robust in vivo proliferation and more durable in vivo  persistence. As might be expected with increased proliferation, 
Cy/Flu was also associated with higher frequency of severe CRS and neurotoxicity, though this toxicity agent  differential was only apparent in the highest cell -dose cohort. T hese data suggest that fludarabine 
contributes to in vivo  CAR T cell expansion and persistence, leading to increased efficacy but also perhaps 
increased toxicity. However, fludarabine is likely just one of many factors (e.g., cell dose, CAR design specific ations, target antigen expression, disease burden, pre -manufacturing T cell phenotype) 
contributing to efficacy and toxicity profile of CAR T cell treatment regimens. The optimal lymphodepletion regimen likely varies by [CONTACT_81418] T cell product and disease and  will need to be determined 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_379160] .  
 The “flu/cy” regimen has developed into one of the standard regimens for lymphodepletion  prior to CAR 
T cell administration. In fact,  the prescribed lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen for use with the  
FDA- approved CTL019  therapy in ALL  consists of fludarabine (30 mg/m
2/day x 4 days) and 
cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/day x 2 days , starting with fludarabine) .  
 Phase 1 trial of huCART19 in pediatric ALL p atients – 13BT022  
In a Phase 1 trial in children and young adults with relapsed/refractory B -ALL at CHOP (13BT022, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), [ADDRESS_474631] been infused with huCART19  as of April 2018 . Infused s ubjects received 
a single dose of huCART19 (median 6x106 huCART19 cells/kg; range 5.03x105 – 1.38x107 huCART19 
cells/kg) at Day 0, post -lymphodepleting chemotherapy. The huCART19 cells have been well tolerated in 
this population as  grade [ADDRESS_474632] commonly observed related  
adverse event s (57%) . We observed that  huCART19  can induce durable remissions without further 
therapy in this clinical setting . An interval data analysis showed a 100% CR rate  (22 out of 22 subjects)  in 
patients with no prior CAR T cell exposure, with a 12 month RFS of  82%. In addition, in patients with a 
prior poor or transient response to murine CD19 -directed CAR T cells, 56% (9 out of 16 subjects) achieved 
CR with B cell aplasia. A 56% RFS at 12 months was observed in the retreatment cohort57. The safety and 
efficacy on this trial encouraged us to expand our experience with huCART19 in pediatric ALL patients in a Phase 2 study that will enroll patients wi th VHR ALL (Cohort A) and patients with poor response to prior 
B cell-directed cell therapy (Cohort B).  
 Investigational Agent  
The investigational agent in this protocol is humanized CART19 cells  (huCART19) . The huCART19 cells will 
be manufactured in the CVPF at U Penn. huCART19 cells will be administered as a single  infusion of 2 - 5 x 
106 huCART19  cells /kg. 
 See the huCART19 Investigator Brochure for additional details.  
huCART19 Ph2 Pediatric ALL  Page [ADDRESS_474633] emerged in more 
than 300 pediatric and adult subjects  treated with various CARs [ mostly murine CART19  but also 
huCART19]  at CHOP  and Penn .  
 Previous Clinical Data  
Prior clinical experience and the safety data collected from prior studies are available in the current 
version of the huCART19  Investigator Brochure.  
 
 Inclusion of children in the research 
Broadly speaking, we feel inclusion of pediatric patients in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_379161]. This is the approach that is generally pursued in early phase cancer trials 
for three reasons: i) to get clinical experience in pediatric populations, ii) to learn about issues with dosing or administration that might be specific to younger patients, and iii) allow pediatric access to novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_379162]. The population of pediatric relapsed/refractory leukemia 
patients targeted for enrollment in this study have no curative options for treatment. New and highly innovative approaches are desperately needed for this group of pediatric  patients. Our initial pediatric 
experience with  huCART19 cells  demonstrates a powerful signal for potential efficacy, with a 100% CR 
rate and 8 2% RFS at 1 year in children  with relapsed/refractory B- ALL and a 56% CR rate with B cell aplasia 
and 56% RFS at [ADDRESS_474634] of benefit 
in patients with no curative options.

 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
 Dose Rationale  
The huCART19 transduced cell dose will be targeted at 5 x106 huCART19 cells/kg  (acceptable dose range 
2x105/kg – 5x105/kg) with a maximum total hu CART19 cell dose of 2 .5x108 huCART19 cells. These doses 
are based on the global phase 2 trial of CTL019  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ). Because there are about 1 x 1012 T cells in 
a healthy adult (equivalent to 2x1010 T cells/kg), assuming a transduction efficiency of 10%, the total cell 
dose is equivalent to about 0.2 5% of the total body mass of T cells85,86. Therefore, we expect the initial 
frequency of cells to be present at about 0. 25% at baseline following infusion.  In addition, in our  animal 
models, we find that a dose of [ADDRESS_474635] antitumor response.  The dose 
given to animals, when scaled, is similar to 5x109 cells in humans.    
 Potential Risks  
Please refer to the current version of the huCART19  Inves tigator Brochure  for expected adverse events.  
 Potential benefits  
Outcome remains poor for pediatric patients with r/r B cell ALL. Treatment options include further 
treatment with salvage chemotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  (HSCT)  or 
supportive care.  
 
Based on inclusion criteria, patients have poor outcomes  with standard available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Furthermore , 
most patients will not be eligible for allogeneic transplant.  For ALL patients, there is little benefit from 
allogeneic SCT with relapsed and active disease and pediatric centers do not offer SCT to patients in this  
situation because of futility. Therefore, any benefit that may be seen with CART19  cells will have a major 
impact for patients.  
 For patients who relapse after allogeneic transplant, treatment options are even more limited and 
outcomes dismal. Conventional chemotherapy is not curative and often highly toxic and ineffective. Second allogeneic transplant is associated with extensive morbidity, mortality, high relap se rate, and is 
ineffective for the majority of patients. Donor lymphocyte infusions result in response rates between 0-
13% and there are very few long -term survivors.  
 
Ongoing clinical trials with murine and humanized CART19  cells expressing the  second generation CAR 
with an anti -CD19 scFv and 4 -1BB and TCR signaling domains, in patients with B -cell ALL and  CLL (both 
CD19 expressing B cell malignancies) described above , show that CART19  therapy has potent anti -tumor 
activity in pediatric and adult ALL patients
97, 98, 101 (described in detail in Section 1.4). Therefore, the risk  
benefit ratio for hu CART19  potential to induce remission in the ALL populations to be studied here  is quite 
favorable.

1BB lentiviral vector, expan ded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. Cryopreserved historical 
apheresis products collected from the patient prior to study entry are usable for huCART19 manufacturing if collected at an appropriately certified apheresis center and the pr oduct meets adequate mononuclear 
cell yields. If a historical apheresis product is not available, an apheresis procedure will be scheduled for cell procurement after study entry.  
 Unless contraindicated and medically not advisable based on previous chemotherapy, patients will be given conditioning chemotherapy prior to hu CART19 cell infusion with the intent of lymphodepletion.  
Additionally, if the patient’s wh ite blood cell (WBC) count is ≤ 1,000 / µL, conditioning/lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy may be held at  investigator discretion . The chemotherapy will be planned so that th e last 
dose is completed 2 -5 days BEFORE the planned infusion of hu CART19 cells.  The chemotherapy start date 
will vary based on the duration of the selected chemotherapy regimen. If the period from chemotherapy to huCART19 infusion is delayed for 4 weeks or more, the patient will need to be re -treated with 
lymphodepletin g chemotherapy prior to hu CART19 infusion.  
 Two study cohorts are planned:  
1. Cohort A : Patients with newly diagnosed VHR B -ALL or high -risk relapse of B-ALL   
2. Cohort B: Patients with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy

Please refer to the Concomitant Therapy Section 5.7  for windows related to apheresis and huCART19 
infusion.  
 Patient Recruitment and Screening 
Patients will be identified through the clinical practices of the investigator or sub -investigators and 
through referrals from outside hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379163].  The study will be posted on clinicaltrials.gov.   
 Female pat ients of reproductive potential (women who have reached menarche and have not 
experienced treatment- related premature ovarian failure) must have negative serum pregnancy test 
performed at the time of screening and a negative urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_474644] infusion of CAR T cells.  
Investigators shall counsel subjects on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the implications of 
an unexpected pregnancy.  
Medically acceptable birth control i ncludes one  of the following methods:  
• Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent  
• Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Hormonal- based contraception  
 Patients who are not of reproductive potential (females who  are pre -menarchal or have experienced 
treatment- related premature ovarian failure or males who have documented azoospermia) do not require 
the use of contraception.  Acceptable documentation of sterilization, azoospermia, and premature 
ovarian failure is specified below:

 Withdrawal of Subjects  
 When and How to Withdraw Patients  
Subjects who enroll but do not receive hu CART19 cells will be prematurely discontinued from the study, 
will not be followed, and will be replaced in the study.  
 Reasons for premature discontinuation  prior to receipt of CART19 cells  include , but are not limited to, 
the following : 
1. The subject  is lost to follow -up. 
2. The judgment of the principal investigator . 
3. Patient non -compliance with the study therapy and/or clinic appointments.   
4. Pregnancy :  Withdraw subject  if pregnancy occurs prior to the huCART19 infusion .  If pregnancy 
occurs after the subject has received hu CART19 cells, they will be kept active in the study for 
safety and pregnancy follow -up and outcome.  No subsequent hu CART19 infusions will be 
administered.   
5. Voluntary withdrawal; a subject may remove himself/herself from the study at any time without 
prejudice. A subject  may withdraw from the study at any time they wish to withdraw consent.  
6. Progression of malignancy requiring alternative medical, radiation or surgical intervention.

 Description 
Humanized CART19 ( huCART19 ) cells are autologous T cells (collected from the patient) that have been 
engineered to express an extracellular single chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an 
intracellular signaling molecule comprised of a tandem signaling domain of the 4 -1BB and TCR ζ signaling 
modules.  
 
Possible toxicities  associated with the administration  of huCART19 cells include transient fever, chills , 
nausea, and rigors.  In order to minimize these events, subjects  will receive premedication as instructed 
below in S ection 5. 5.  Later toxicities ([ADDRESS_474648] infusion) are likely to be related to CRS, or possibly 
tumor lysis. Toxicities that could potentially occur but are u nprecedented are primarily related to the gene 
transfer are discussed in greater detail in the huCART19 Investigator Brochure. In addition, management 
of such toxicities is described in Section 8. 5.   
 Cohort Assignment  
Cohort assignment will occur at enrollment : 
• Cohort A : Patients with newly diagnosed VHR B -ALL or high -risk relapse of B-ALL  
• Cohort B: Patients with poor response to prior B cell directed engineered cell therapy

The subject must complete treatment prior to receiving their huCART19 infusion.  The test 
does not need to be repeated after treatment, however if influenza signs and symptoms are present, the huCART19 infusion should be delayed until the subject is asymptomatic.  
 huCART19 Treatment Regimen  
Subjects will receive a single dose of huCART19 cells on Study Day 0. A cell dose of 5x106 huCART19 cells/kg  
will be targeted . The acceptable target dose range is 2x105 – 5x106 huCART19 cells/kg, with  the maximum 
single dose of huCART19 cells to be administered is  2.5x108. We will use the following schedule:  
 
If the minimum target dose is not achieved in manufacturing, a product that meets all release criteria may 
be infused  at the investigator’s discretion . 
 
Timin g of additional huCART19 infusions is described in Section 6.13 . The same dosing parameters listed 
above for huCART19 will apply for reinfusion/retreatment doses.  
 Pr eparation and Administration of huCART19  
In addition to the language below, please see the Investigationa l Product Handling Manual for further 
details on product thawing, transport, and labeling.  
 
Manufacturing  
huCART19 c ell manu facturi ng is performed  at the University of Pennsylvania Clinical Cell and Vaccine 
Production Facility (CVPF)  and transported to the Cell and Gene Therapy Laboratory (CGTL) at CHOP.   
 
Transport and CHOP Cell and Gene Therapy Laboratory Activities  
The investigational product is transported in dry ice from the CVPF to the CGTL at CHOP.  The frozen cells 
will be thawed at the CGTL at CHOP , the bag will be washed to recover all remaining volume with 5% H SA, 
the resulting volume will be drawn into a syringe with a new label affixed that includes the investigational 
product name , participant (denoted as DONOR or RECEIPI[INVESTIGATOR_16139]) ID number, expi[INVESTIGATOR_4389],

Additionally, an aliquot of the reconstituted product is sent for additional sterility testing.  Sterility testing 
is not available in real-time prior to subject administration.  If a positive sterility test is reported, the CGTL 
at CHOP will notify the Sponsor Medical Director and PI [INVESTIGATOR_97318].  
 The syringe is then transported to the subject’s bedside for infusion. The final volume transported to subject’s bedside will be recorded at the CHOP CGTL . The inves tigator must notify the Sponsor of any 
damaged or unusable cell products that were supplied to the investigator’s site by [CONTACT_379214].  
 
Premedication  
Side effects following T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea. It is recommended that the subject  be pre -medicated with acetaminophen and an antihistamine  prior to each CART19 cell 
infusion. Subjects  should not  receive systemic corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, 
methyl prednisolone or dexamethasone at any time, except physiologic doses of hydrocortisone for 
adrenal support or  in the case of a life -threatening emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on 
CART19 cell expansi on and function.   
 
Additional Safety Procedures Prior to Administration  
Emergency medical equipment must be available during the infusion in case the subject  has an allergic 
reaction , or severe hypotensive crisis, or any other reaction to the infusion. Vital signs (temperature, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], pulse, and blood pressure) will be taken before infusion.  
 huCART19 Product  Infusions 
Prior to each infusion, two individuals will independently verify all unique identifier information in the presence of the subject  and confirm that the information on the product label is correctly matched to the 
participant.  The product will then be checked to the subject  per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137288].  
 
Trained study staff will administer the hu CART19 product by [CONTACT_379215] i.v. or central line, prior to 
the expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]/time identified on the product label .  A leukoreduction filter  must not be used for the 
infusion of the CART cell product . The durati on of CART19 administration will be based on the total 
volume to be infused and the recommended infusion rate of 10 -20mL per minute.  
 Vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation  as clinically 
indicated ) will be measured within 10 minutes prior to the infusion  and within 15 minutes after the 
infusion . Vital signs will also be measured 15 (+/- 5) minutes, 30 (+/- 5) minutes, 45  (+/- 5) minutes, and 
60 (+/- 5) minutes after the infusion.  If the subject’s vital signs are not satisfactory and stable one hour 
post -CART19 infusion, vital signs will continue to be monitored as clinically indicated  until stable .   The 
subject will be discharged when medically stable and in accordance with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_41361] .   
 
Febrile reaction  
In the event of febrile reaction, an evaluation for infection should be initiated, and subjects  managed 
appropriately with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive care as medically indicated and determined by [CONTACT_1963]. In the event that the subject  develops sepsis or systemic bacteremia following the 
CAR T cell infusion, appropriate cultures and medical management should be initiated.  If a contaminated 
huCART19 Ph2 Pediatric ALL  Page [ADDRESS_474657] likely etiology should be given.  
 Concomitant Therapy  
All prescription and nonprescription medication, vitamins, herbal and nutritional supplements, taken by 
[CONTACT_379216] 30 days  prior to screening /enrollment  will be recorded. At every visit following the 
huCART19 infusions  and until the subject  has completed or has been discontinued from participation in 
the study , concomitant medications will be recorded in the medical record an d on the appropriate CRF. 
Any additions, deletions, or changes of these medications will be documented.  The following guidelines 
must be adhered to during the study:  
• Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) should be avoided  due to potential 
to worsen CRS sy mptoms.  G-CSF would be the preferred myeloid growth factor over GM -CSF, if 
medically indicated. The effects of G -CSF on CRS symptoms  are unknown and can be used at the 
physician’s discretion.  
• Steroids o r other immunosuppressant drugs should NOT be used within 48 -72 hours (preferably 
7 days ) prior to the apheresis procedure.  
• Steroids or other immunosuppressant drugs should NOT be used within 48 hours prior to  or at 
any time  following CART19 infusion unless under life threatening circumstances or at the 
physicians’ discretion for CRS management . 
• Recent or current use of inhaled steroids or physiologic replacement with hydrocortisone is allowed. Therapeutic doses of steroids must be stopped > 48 hours  prior to CART19 infusion. The  
following physiological replacement doses of steroids are allowed: 6 -12 mg/m
2/day 
hydrocortisone or equivalent .  
• Subjects  with severe signs and symptoms attributable to CRS should be managed with the 
administration of tocilizumab or other ant i-cytokine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Section 8.5 .2) for administration 
details . 
• Neutropenic subjects will be administered broad -spectrum antibiotics at the start of fever and 
managed as per institutional SOPs .

CONF IDENTI AL 
This material is the p roperty o f the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as auth orized in wr iting by [CONTACT_379203] r. • Review of prior antineoplastic medications  
• Physical exam and measurement of vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, body 
temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], and heart rate , and oxygen saturation via pulse oximetry  as 
clinically indicated)  
• Lansky  or Karnofsky performance status  
• ECHO  
• Blood will be taken for Hematology, Coagulation, and Biochemistry analysis. Viral serologies 
(HIV, Hepatitis B/C). If the HCV antibody is positive, a screening HCV RNA by [CONTACT_379217] -PCR or 
bDNA assay must be performed. Eligibility will be determined based on the screening value. The test is not required if documentation of a negative result of a HCV RNA test performed within 60 days prior to screening is provided.  
• Serum pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential  
• Serum IgG level  
• Pulmonary function Test (DLCO) - if clinically appropriate as determined by [CONTACT_124133]  
• BCR-ABL PCR (Ph+ ALL patients only ; as clinically indicated ) 
• Bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_379169] 1 . If the results of recent testing  
(obtained at the time of the patient’s most recent relapse) are available, these do  not need to 
be repeated for enrollment . 
• CNS evaluation - If CNS symptoms are present at Screening/Enrollment , then a lumbar puncture 
and brain imaging by [CONTACT_9268]/CT will be performed to assess CNS leukemic involvement.  If the 
results of a historical lumbar puncture (obtained at the time of the patient’s most recent relapse) are available, this does not need to be repeated for enrollment.  
 
In the event that the time between the screening visit  and the infusion of hu CART19 T cells exceeds the 
12 week  Screening/Enrollment Window  the following will be repeated: Physical Examination, 
Performance Status Assessment, Complete Blood Count with differential and Platelet Count, Chemistry Panel, Pregnancy test .  An ECHO  must be performed within [ADDRESS_474658] numbers will occur at consent, will be in ascending order ( 18CT014- 01, 18CT014-
02, etc.) and no numbers will be omitted. Subject numbers will be used on all study documentation. Once 
assigned, the Subject Number must not be reused for any other subject and the Subject Number for that 
individual must not be changed, even if the subject is re -screened.  
 At the time a subject consents to participate in this study, a Consent Notification Form should  be 
completed.  Once required screening tests have been completed and the subject has been determined eligible by [CONTACT_099]- investigator, provide the documents listed below to:

assessments).  
 Upon informed consent completion and receipt of screening and eligibility documentation, a Sponsor Monitor will review and provide documentation that monitoring of eligibility has been completed. This documentation must be received prior to cell product manufacturing.  
 Apheresis  (~Week -4 to -3)  
After  the monitoring visit for eligibility has been completed , a single large volume apheresis procedure 
may  be carried out at a FACT -accredited  apheresis center. PBMC are obtained for huCART19 
manufacturing during this procedure. From a single leukapheresis, the intention is to harvest up to 50 x 
109 (recommended 2 -10x108/kg) cells to manufacture hu CART19 T cells. Baseline samples  for FDA look -
back requirements and for research are also obtained and cryopreserved. The cell product is expected to 
be ready for release at least  [ADDRESS_474659] is not available, an apheresis procedure 
(as described above) will be performed for cell procurement after study eligibility has been confirmed.  
 Recommended criteria for apheresis product acceptance to initiate processing for clinical manufacturing to meet the dosing requirements includes the following specifications :  
A CBC with automated differential on the apheresis product following completion of collection that reports absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) ≥ 500/ µL. If the ALC <500/ µL in the apheresis product, it is 
recommended that the CD3 cell count should be ≥ 150/ µl for acceptance to begin processing for clinical 
manufacturing to achieve the target dose.  
 Assessment Types  
 Demographics, Eligibility Verification, Medical History, Historical and 
Concomitant Medications  
Patient demographics will be recorded on the demography source documents. A physician -investigator 
will review inclusion/exclusion criteria to verify eligibility. A detailed medical history will be taken and 
recorded on the medical history CRF as well as current and prior (within 30 days of enro llment ) 
concomitant medications.  
 Physical Exam  
A complete physical examination will be performed according to Appendix 1 .  Physical examination will 
also be used to assess evidence of disease in the liver, spleen, and lymph node, skin, gum infiltration, and testicular involvement in males.  Statements of “normal or WNL” will indicate lack of involvement.  Height 
will be measured in centimeter s and weight will be measured in kilograms.  
 Significant findings that are present prior to receipt  of the investigational product  must be included on

seru m pregnancy test (β -HCG) will be performed at screening according to Appendix [ADDRESS_474661] be withdrawn from 
the study.  
 Research Assessments to A ssess Engraftment, Persistence and 
Bioactivity  
The following assessments will be performed  according to Appendix 1  and will be analyzed  at the 
Translational and Correlative Studies Laboratory ( TCSL ). These tests may include:   
• Serum Cytokines   
• DNA qPCR for huCART19 persistence  
• Flow cytometry for hu CART19  
 
RCL VSV -G testing will not be routinely performed as of Protocol V2.  Blood samples will be collected and 
banked at pre -infusion and post -infusion at Months 3, 6, and 12.  These samples may be used for future 
RCL VSV -G testing if indicated .  
 
Sample Handling 
Samples will be delivered, processed, and frozen as per SOP to the TCSL at the University of 
Pennsylvania . Samples will be stored for banking and bulk analyses.  Documentation for sample receipt, 
processing, and storage and primary data from the research analyses will be collected and stored.

Unscheduled Research Sample Collections  
Beyond the research sample collections scheduled for specific time points, up to 45 mL (3  tablespoons) of 
additional peripheral blood may be drawn twice per week to better characterize correlates of clinical 
events such as cytokine release syndrome.  Marrow/LN collections would not exceed more than one 
procedure per month at physician’s discretion.  In addition, samples obtained during procedures 
performed for standard clinical indications (e.g., bone marrow samples, et c.) may be diverted for research 
use if such diversion does not substantially increase the risk of the procedure or compromise standard clinical diagnostic studies.   
 Cytoreductive /Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy  
Prior to huCART19 cell infusion, an additional chemotherapy cycle is planned.  While  the choice of 
chemotherapy will be at the investigator’s discretion depending on the patient’s underlying disease and 
prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day x 4 days) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2/day x 2 days) 
are the preferred agents, as there is the most experience with the use of these agents in facilitating 
adoptive immunotherapy on completed and ongoing pediatric CART19 trials . In addition, this is the 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen prescribed with the FDA- approved CART19 therapy in ALL, 
Tisangenlecleucel ( Kymriah™ ).  
 
**Note, the lymphodepleting chemotherapy prior to huCART19 cell infusion is NOT  required if patient ’s 
WBC ≤ 1,000 / µL. Additionally, if the period between chemotherapy and  huCART19 infusion is delayed [ADDRESS_474662] dose is completed  approximately 2 -5 days BEFORE the 
planned infusion of hu CART19 cells. The purpose of the chemotherapy is to induce lymphopenia in order 
to facilitate the engraftment and homeostatic expansion of hu CART19 cells.  In addition, chemotherapy is 
intended to control the ALL . The  chemotherapy is not investigational and may be given by a patient’s local 
oncologist within the specified time frame.  
 All patients must undergo influenza testing within [ADDRESS_474663] does not need to be repeated after treatment, however

longer -term disease control. In thes e cases, it may be appropriate to give more hu CART19 cells. Additional 
huCART19 cells  may  be given no earlier than Day 14  and no less than 14 days from a prior infusion .  
Additional infusions will be administered as outlined below.  
 Reinfusions 
Subjects in continued remission may  receive additional huCART19 infusion (s) at the physician -
investigator’s discretion.  Subjects must be evaluated by a physician- investigator for eligibility to receive 
additional huCART19 infusions according to criteria in Section 5.3 .  If performed, these additional infusions 
will be defined as “reinfusions’.  For the purposes of study timepoint identification and reporting, each reinfusion will be considered  a  new treatment number (i.e.  the first huCART19 infusion on Day 0 will be 
Treatment #1, the first reinfusion post Day 0 will be Treatment #2, the second reinfusion post Day 0 will be Treatment #3, etc).    If reinfusions are administered, additional safety follow -up visits are required.  While all study visits will 
continue to be calculated based on the date of the initial huCART19 cell infusion (Day 0), subjects will also enter into a Reinfusion Section of the Schedule of Evaluations at the time reinfusion of huCART19 cells is initiated.  Where Reinfusion Study Visits may overlap with existing study timepoints (i.e. Reinfusion Day  0 
may overlap with the Month 3 study timepoint), all study tests/procedures required for both visits should 
be completed per protocol requirements  but will not be duplicated .  When post -reinfusion follow -up is 
completed per protocol. The subject will resume the study follow -up timepoints per the Primary Schedule 
of Evaluations .  Additional follow -up post reinfusion may  also be performed per physician -investigator 
discretion.  
   
Both study visit identifiers will be used for data collection/reporting purposes (i.e. continuous study visit 
day and reinfusion visit timepoint).  Please refer to the Schedule of Evaluations in Appendix [ADDRESS_474668] -

for eligibility to receive additional huCART19 infusions according to criteria in Section 5.[ADDRESS_474669] -relapse will be defined as “retreatment”.   
 
If a decision is made to retreat a subject post -relapse, the subject will officially discontinue the  Primary 
Schedule of Evaluations ( Appendix 1 ) at the time of their first retreatment study visit/procedure (i.e. 
lymp hodepleting chemotherapy)  and enter the Retreatment Schedule of  Evaluations (Appendix 2 ). 
Retreatment study visit timepoints will be distinguished from the  primary Schedule of Evaluations by a “ -

the same as “No response” or “Treatment failure”, which is consistent with the Cheson et al. (2003)94 
guideline. The difference between PD and “No response” in ALL is not believed to be clinical meaningful. 
 
B cell aplasia status : In addition to disease response defined above, all patients will be evaluated for B cell 
aplasia status at pre -infusion and each response assessment time point thereafter.  In particular, 
achievement of B cell aplasia will be the key biologic response endpoint for subjects who are enrolled in continued remission but have demonstrated B cell recovery after prior therapy with engineered T cells . B 
cell aplasia is defined as less than 3% of peripheral blood lymphoc ytes are CD19+  or an absolute CD19+ 
lymphocyte count of less than 50/ µL. 
 STATISTICAL PLAN  
 Design Overview  
This is a two cohort , open -label, phase 2 study to determine the efficacy of huCART19 in pediatric and 
young adult patients with CD19 -expressing relapsed and refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
 Sample Size Justification  
This is a phase 2  study of huCART19  to determine the efficacy of huCART19 in relapsed/refractory B- ALL. 
The primary endpoint of 1- year EFS will be determined in 2 cohorts based on exposure to prior B cell 
directed engineered cell therapy.  
 A total of 100 infused subjects is targeted. Cohort A will enroll up to approximately 62 patients with newly 
diagnosed VHR B -ALL or high -risk relapse of B-ALL  to achieve a sample size of 52 infused patients for the 
primary endpoint; Cohort B will enroll up to approximately 54 patients with poor response to prior B cell 
directed engineered cell therapy  to achieve a samples size of 48  infused patients. For cohort A, the null 
hypothes is is 40% 1-year EFS and the alternative hypothesis is 60 % 1-year EFS. The sample size of 52 
provides 9 5% power to test this hypothesis, using a one -sided one -sample Log -rank test wi th 10% type I 
error, assuming 1 year of follow up for each patient
95. For cohort B, the null hypothesis is 1 5% 1-year EFS 
and the alternative hypothesis is 30 % 1-year EFS. The sample size of 48 provides 91% power to test this 
hypothesis, using a one -sided one -sample Log -rank test wi th 10% type I error, assuming [ADDRESS_474674] that we could infuse approximately 85% of enrolled patients, so we will enroll approximately 62 patients for cohort A and approximately 54 patients for cohort B to obtain the 
targeted number of infused patients.  
 Analysis Sets  
• The Enrolled Set comprises all subjects who sign an informed consent form and are confirmed 
eligible for  the study (i.e. excluding screen failure patients ). 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS)  comprises all subjects who received the huCART19 cells.  The FAS will 
be used for all the analyses, including the primary, secondary , and exploratory analyses.  
 
Definitions relevant to the Analysis Sets:  
1) Screen failure  - Any patient who fails to meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified by [CONTACT_12695].

CONF IDENTI AL 
This material is the p roperty o f the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as auth orized in wr iting by [CONTACT_379203] r. 2) Manufacturing failure  – Any patient who has manufactured hu CART19 cells that do not meet 
the manufacturing release criteria.   
 Analysis of Primary Objective  
The p rimary endpoint is the 1- year Event -Free Survival in patients with newly diagnosed VHR B- ALL or 
high -risk relapse of B- ALL (cohort A) and in patients with poor response to prior B cell directed 
engineered cell therapy  (cohort B). Time to event or censoring is defined as the time from infusion to 
the first of any of the following events: no response, relapse,  death due to any cause, or to the last day 
of follow up if no event occurs. All analyses will be performed for cohort A and B separately. Kaplan -
Meier (KM) curves will be generated and one- sample Log -rank test will be used to test the 1-year EFS 
against the historical rate. One-year EFS and its 95% confidence interval (CI) will also be estimated based 
on the KM method.  
 Analysis of Secondary Objectives  
• Overall remission rate is determined by [CONTACT_379220] 28, computed as the proportion of 
subjects with CR or CRi according to the response criterion described in Section 6. 15. The 
proportion and its 95% CI will be calculated.  
• 2-year EFS with 95% CI will estimated based on the KM method.  
• Relapse -free Survival (RFS)  is defined as the time  from achievement of remission ( CR or C ri) to 
the date of relapse or death due to ALL , or censored at the las t day of follow -up. Relapse -free 
Survival will be assessed only in subjects with the best overall response of CR or CRi.  KM curves 
will be generated and 2 -year relapse -free survival with its 95% CI will be estimated.  
 
All adverse events , CRS, and neurotoxicity  will be summarized based on the incidence rate as the main 
source to characterize the safety profile of huCART19  administration.  After completing post -infusion 
follow -up on this study, subjects will be asked to participate in a separate dest ination long- term follow -
up study for up to [ADDRESS_474675] model describing huCART19 expansion followed by [CONTACT_379221].  Descriptive statistics will be calculated for change over time as absolute values or fold change. Summary statistics will also be provided for measures of anti-CAR antibodies and cellular immunogenicity, and measures of checkpoint pathways (e.g. PD -1, CTLA -4, Tim -3, LAG -3) at time 
points before and after infusion.  
 SAFETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS 
 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related .  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse 
events.

CONF IDENTI AL 
This material is the p roperty o f the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as auth orized in wr iting by [CONTACT_379203] r. Serious Adverse Event  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse event is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• leads to a persistent or significant disability or incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 
to conduct normal life functions  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379176]:  
• Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition, such as preplanned study visits and preplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379177]  
• Elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication 
unde r study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent  
• Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general condition  
 Note : Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis that does not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_379178] a SAE given above is not a serious adverse event.   
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.  They may jeopardize the patient, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did not result -
in patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or intensive treatment of bronchospasm in an emergency department would typi[INVESTIGATOR_15355].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious should be regarded as non-serious 
adverse events. 
 
Unexpected adverse events  
An adverse event is considered unexpected if the event, and  severity and/or frequency  of the event,  is 
not consistent with the risk information described  in the investigator brochure or protocol .  Please refer 
to the huCART19 Investigator Brochure for complete details.    
 
Related adverse events  
An adverse event is considered related to participation in the research if there is a reasonable possibility 
that an event was caused by [CONTACT_379222], intervention, or research -required procedures.  
For the purposes of this study, "reasonable possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. Related adverse events will be classified as possibly related, probably related, and definitely 
related:  
• Possibly Related : There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship, however other factors 
may have contributed to the event.  
• Probably Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other 
factors is unlikely.

CONF IDENTI AL 
This material is the p roperty o f the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as auth orized in wr iting by [CONTACT_379203] r. • Definitely Related: There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible 
contributing factors can be ruled out.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Collection of adverse events will begin at the time of apheresis and will continue until the subject is off-
study.  For subjects who do not undergo apheresis on this study (i.e. historical apheresis product is 
available), adverse event reporting will begin on Day 0  (from the start of the first huCART19 infusion) until 
the subject  is off-study .   
 
If a subject is taken off study within 30 days of the T -cell infusion, all SAEs experienced within 30 days 
after the T -cell infusion should be reported to the sponsor. Any SAEs experienced after this 30 day period 
should be reported to the sponsor if the i nvestigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment.  
 
Preexisting Condition /General Physical Examination Findings  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the Adverse Event Reporting Period .  All 
clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as a preexisting condition on the medical history 
eCRF.  During the course of the study, a  preexisting condition should be recorded as an adverse event if 
the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens.   Preexisting conditions that improve 
should also be recorded appropriately.  
 Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the  following  
conditions is met:  
• The laboratory abnormality is not  otherwise refuted b y a repeat test to confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent fo llow -up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc.  
 
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for Adverse Events should be followed until they have returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. When an abnormal laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported adverse event, it is not necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional event. Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet 
the definition of an adverse event,  should not be reported as adverse events. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) 
as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined 
above  and/or as per investigator’s discretion. Whenever possible, a diagnosis, rather than a symptom 
should be provided (i.e. anemia instead of low hemoglobin).    
 Recording of Adverse Events  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_379223] 5.0  (CTCAE v5.0)  at each study visit. Patients will be monitored by 
[CONTACT_379224], physical examinations, and blood studies to detect potential toxicities from the treatment.  If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, the severity of mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, and death, corresponding to Grades [ADDRESS_474676] symptoms separately if a diagnosis can be 
assigned. The safety team may require events be reported separately if they occur as SAEs (or in the context 
of a SAE) even if they can also be considered a constituent of another AE such as CRS . 
 All adverse events occurring during the adverse event reporting period (defined in Section 8.1  above) 
must be recorded.   
 As much as possible, each adverse event  should be evaluated to d etermine:  
1. The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 -5) 
2. Its duration (Start and end dates)  
3. Its relationship to the study treatment- [Reasonable possibility that AE is related: No 
(unrelated/unsuspected) or Yes (a suspec ted adverse reaction) ].  If yes (suspected) - is the event 
possibly, probably or definitely related to the investigational treatment?  
4. Expectedness to study treatment- [Unexpected- if the event severity and/or frequency is not 
described in the investigator brochure and protocol  (in the absence of an investigator 
brochure) ]. 
5. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable)  
6. Whether medication or therapy taken (n o concomitant medication/non -drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non -drug therapy)  
7. Whether it is serious, where a serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as in Section 8.1. 
 All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non -drug therapy is 
given, this action should be recorded.  Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment should be made at each visit ( or more 
frequently, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome.  
 Progression of malignancy, documented appropriately in the medical records, should not be reported as 
a serious adverse event.  Adverse events that occur concurrently with the progression of malignancy but that are not related to disease progression (i.e. deep vein thrombosis or hem optysis) will be reported as 
an adverse event as described above.  Progression of malignancy resulting in death should be reported as a serious adverse event.  
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the adverse event reporting period must be followed to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the adverse event reporting period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation, should be recorded and reported.  
 
Grading System of Cytokine Release Syndrome  (CRS)   
A protocol specific grading system ( Table 8-1) has  been developed to ca pture cytokine release syndrome  
in CAR T -cell protocols.  Please refer to the current version of the huCART19 Investigator Brochure for 
additional detail on CRS in CAR  T-cell therapy.

 Pregnancies  
To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy occurring while the patient is on study treatment must be reported to protocol sponsor within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The pregnancy should be 
followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications.  If a preg nancy occurs on study, this will be reported as an SAE using the SAE Report Form.  
 Pregnancy outcomes must be collected for the female partners of any males who took study treatment in this study. Consent to report information regarding these pregnancy outcomes should be obtained from the mother . 
 Toxicity Management, Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_379179]. Ther efore, there is no specific occurrence of SAEs 
that define a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], but the review of SAEs will form the basis for potential early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_379180]. Only unexpected SAEs that are related to the huCART19 cells would define a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]. The

that there are problems in the cell product generation, as a result of safety concerns, or at the discretion of the Sponsor or study investi gators. Additionally, recruitment may be stopped for reasons of particularly 
low recruitment, protocol violations, or inadequate data recording.

 Criteria for Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_379182]: 
• Any patient develops uncontrolled T cell proliferation that does not respond to management.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_474677] 14 and 5 at any time.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_474678] 14 , and 5 at any time.  
• Grade [ADDRESS_474679] 14 and 5 at any time.  
• Premature study termination may occur if the Investigator, Sponsor, DSMB,  ACC DSMC,  or any 
appropriate independent review board or regulatory body decides for any reason that patient 
safety may be compromised by [CONTACT_144533].  
• Premature study termination ma y occur if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the development 
of the intervention to be used in this study.   
 
The stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_379183], neurotoxicity and GVHD were calculated based on the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval exceeding 10%.  
 General Toxicity Management Considerations  
Replication -competent lentivirus (RCL).  
RCL may in theory be generated during the CAR T cell manufacturing phase or subsequently after 
introduction of vector transduced cells into the subject. However, an RCL resulting from the production 
phase is highly unlikely since elements are incorporated in the design of the vector system that minimize vector recombination and generation of RCL. Furthermore, the vector used to transduce the product undergoes sensitiv e assays to confirm that the vector is RCL negative before it can be released for use in 
product manufacture. Though theoretical, development of RCL could pose a risk to both the subject and their close contact(s), and therefore, samples will be archived d uring the course of the trial. In the event 
of a suspected RCL, measures to detect RCL will be followed as per  the recent FDA guidance , Testing of 
Retroviral Vector -Based Human Gene Therapy Products for Replication Competent Retrovirus During 
Product Manuf acture and Patient Follow -up.    
 
Clonality and insertional oncogenesis    
Monitoring for T cell clonal outgrowth will be performed by [CONTACT_379225]19 and by [CONTACT_379226].   
huCART19 levels that continue to rise in a manner inconsistent with observed kinetics (i.e. initial 
expansion after infusion) will be examined to determine if these are expected due to subject’s clinical course  (reappearance of disease)  or other cause. If clonal expansion is suspected , the patient's T cells will 
be evaluated for the pattern of vector inserti on.   
 If integration site analysis reveals mono - or oligoclonality and/or integration at or near an oncogenic locus, 
a monitoring plan, including follow -up molecular analyses, will be developed in collaboration between the 
PI [CONTACT_1629] d Regulatory Sponsor of the original study that is specific for the health care risks that are anticipated 
given the nature of the integration site and vector target cell type.  
 If integration site analysis reveals mono - or oligoclonality and/or integration at or near an oncogenic locus, 
a monitoring plan, including follow -up molecular analyses, will be developed in collaboration between the 
PI [INVESTIGATOR_379184].

Uncontrolled T cell proliferation   
Toxicity associated with allogeneic or autologous T cell infusions has been managed with a course of 
pharmacologic immunosuppression. CAR T cell associated toxicity has been reported to respond to 
systemic corticosteroids97.  If uncontrolled T cell proliferation occurs  (grade 3 or 4 toxicity related to CAR  T 
cells) , subject s may be treated with corticosteroids. Subjects will be treated with pulse  methylprednisolone 
(2mg/kg i.v. divided q12 hr x 2 days), followed by a rapid taper.  
 
B cell depletion   
In the event of clinically significant hypogammaglobulinemia (i.e. systemic infections), patients may be 
given intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) by [CONTACT_379227].  
 
Infusion re action   
Acetaminophen and an antihistamine  may be repeated every [ADDRESS_474680] can be retested for sterility using archived samples that 
are stored in the CVPF.  Consideration  of CRS (see below) should be given.   
 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)/ Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)   
Tocilizumab should be used as a single, weight -based dose  of 8-12 mg/kg at the time of hemodynamic 
instability  (as per Tocilizumab package insert) .  This management approach is designed to avoid life -
threatening toxicities , so the timing of the tocilizumab should be individualized, in close consultation with 
the study te am.  Steroids have not always been effective in this setting  and may not be necessary given 
the rapid response to tocilizumab . Because steroids will interfere with huCART19 function  and efficacy, if 
used, they should be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_333379].  
 
Upon developi[INVESTIGATOR_379185] -persistent fevers following hu CART19 infusion, patients should 
then be followed closely. Infection and tumor lysis syndrome work up should be immediately undertaken.  
The pharmacy should be notified of the potential nee d for tocilizumab.  Patient management in an 
intensive care unit may be required and the timing is dependent upon local institutional practice. In addition to supportive care, tocilizumab may be administered in cases of moderate to severe CRS, 
especially  if the patient exhibits any of the following:  
• Hemodynamic instability despi[INVESTIGATOR_379186]  
• Worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], including pulmonary infiltrates, increasing oxygen requirement including high -flow O
2, and/or need for mechanical ventilation.  
• Any other signs or symptoms of rapid deterioration despi[INVESTIGATOR_379187]19 Ph2 Pediatric ALL  Page [ADDRESS_474681] been immediately treated with 
tocilizumab and decisions  are, in part, based upon the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_379188].  
 
Please refer to Table 8-4 below for the CRS Treatment Algo rithm.  
 
CRS has been associated with biochemical and physiologic abnormalities consistent with MAS.  Moderate to extreme elevations in serum C -reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin have been seen with CART19 
associated  CRS, however the magnitude and kinetics vary greatly between individual patients.  CRS 
management decisions should be based upon clinical signs and symptoms and response to interventions, not these laboratory values per se . 
 CTCAE grading of CRS relates to its occurrence with acute infusional toxicities, whereas the CRS associated with CART19 therapy  is not acute, but rather delayed. Refer to Section 8. 2 and Table 8-1 for modified 
definitions of grading of huCART19 delayed CRS events.

 Hemodynamic and respi[INVESTIGATOR_379195] 8-3 and Table 8-5, 
respectively . The mechanism underlying neurotoxicity after CAR T cell administration is poorly 
understood. Anecdotal evidence suggests that anti -IL6 therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which are effective for CRS, do  not 
prevent or reverse neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity can be asynchronous with cytokine release syndrome, 
often reaching its maximum intensity later than CRS or even arising after resolution of CRS. The following 
principles guide the recommended management of neurotoxicity:  
– Most instances of neurologic toxicity are self-limited, but life -threatening complications such 
as cerebral edema develop in some cases of patients treated with other CAR products, such as 
JCAR01598 . This has not been seen in children treated with huCART19 or murine CART19  
(CTL019 ) at CHOP  or on the multisite trials. Corticosteroid therapy has not been necessary in 
any pediatric patient with moderate (grade 2 -3) neurotoxicity. The efficacy of corticosteroids 
is unproven, and corticosteroids may adversely affect CAR T cell efficacy, so a risk -benefit 
determination must be made by [CONTACT_379228] . In exceptional 
circumstances, cytotoxic chemotherapy could be considered in grade 4 cases based on a report 
that cerebral edema improved promptly after cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in one case99. 
– Consultation with a neurologist is helpful for properly documenting and tracking neurologic abnormalities, evaluating for other potential etiologies of neurologic abnormalities, and managing neurologic emergencies such as seizure or elevated intracranial pressure.  
– Coagulopathy and t hrombocytopenia should be aggressively managed. Both coagulopathy and 
thrombocytopenia often develop with CRS. Intracranial hemorrhage has been observed in conjunction with severe neurotoxicity. In addition, a recent report suggests that 
thrombocytopenia i s an independent risk factor for CAR -related neurotoxicity, and platelets 
may serve as a source of mediators that stabilize the endothelium and counteract destabilizing 
effects of cytokines elaborated during CAR T cell proliferation
93. 
 CRS should be managed concurrently with neurotoxicity according to guidelines enumerated above. It is difficult to distinguish delirium secondary to CRS from mild/early CAR -related neurotoxicity (and these 
phenomena may not be distinct pathophysiologically).

CONF IDENTI AL 
This material is the p roperty o f the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as auth orized in wr iting by [CONTACT_379203] r. developed for safety oversight of this study. The DSMB will provide guidance/advice to the Regulatory 
Sponsor and Clinical Investigators. The DSMB will evaluate subject  safety as specified in the DSMB Charter.  
 A DSMB meeting will occur a pproximately every 6 months. If necessary, additional meeting s of the DSMB 
may be held if safety issues arise in between scheduled meetings.   
  
It is envisioned that the DSMB may make four types of recommendations, namely:  
• No safety or efficacy issues, ethical to continue the study as planned.  
• Serious safety concerns  precluding further study treatment, regardless of efficacy.  
• Overwhelming evidence for futility, recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098].  
• Recommendation to continue the study but proposing an amendment to the protocol (e.g., incorporate an additional safety assessmen ts). 
 A sponsor representative will share the outcome of the DSMB meeting with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_137095], for 
submission to local regulatory review committees as required per institutional policy.  
 DATA HANDLING AND RECORDKEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_379196] 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a 
signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from patients in this study  
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research patient to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 In the event that a patient revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], 
retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of patient authorization.   For 
patients that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the patient is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 Source Documents  
Source data is all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents . Examples of these original documents, and data records include:  hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_20112],  
clinical  and  office  charts,  laboratory notes,  memoranda,  patients’ diaries or evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copi[INVESTIGATOR_10379], microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, patient files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at 
medico -technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 The investigator m ust maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of case and 
visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_20114]) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms and the results of any other tests or  assessments. All information

also keep the original signed informed consent form, and a signed copy must be given to the patient  
and/or legally acceptable surrogate . 
 Case Report Forms  
The study case report form (CRF) is the primary data collection instrument for the study. All  
data requested on the CRF must be recorded. All entries will be entered into an electronic  
data capture system (EDC). The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_379197], accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner.  
 Records Retention 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to retain study essential documents for at least [ADDRESS_474685].  These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_16477].  In such an instance, it is the resp onsibility of the 
sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
 STUDY MONITORING, AUDITING, AND INSPECTING

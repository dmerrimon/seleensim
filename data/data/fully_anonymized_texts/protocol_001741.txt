  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135726] Background  
High rates of health -related financial burden and unaddressed social determinants of 
health (SDHs) are key drivers of adverse health outcomes for people with diabetes. 
Increases in patient cost -sharing across all insurance types, coupled with unaddressed SDHs 
affecting patients’ health (e.g. food insecurity, unstable housing) have created significant 
stressors for individuals with complex and expensive conditions like diabetes.8-11 In 2014, 1 in 4 
families reported financial burdens from managing their out -of-pocket healthcare expenses8, 
and 1 in 5 reported trouble meeting basic needs.9,12 Financial stressors (actual and perceived) 
are major barriers to treatment adherence.[ADDRESS_1135727] -
related non -adherence (CRN) - taking a smaller dose of medication, taking medications less 
frequently, delaying or not fulfilling prescriptions, and borrowing medicines from someone else 
to avoid additional expenses.1 Eleven percent of people with chronic illnesses (17.5 million 
Americans) report both CRN and food insecurity.9 Failure to identify and address unmet medical 
resource needs and SDHs leads to uncontrolled disease, high rates of avoidable healthcare use 
(emergency department (ED) visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]), high healthcare costs, and premature 
morbidity and mortality.2-3,[ADDRESS_1135728] 
(ACA) provides little time to adequately meet the needs of complex patients. Given that social 
factors are key determinants of health, providers serving patients with multifaceted needs 
require efficient and effective approaches to ensure that their patients can access affordable, 
necessary services and resources to effectively manage their health.  Failing to do so can 
compromise access to care and further widen population- level health disparities.  
There is increased recognition to screen for and address health -re lated financial 
burden and unmet SDHs. Most interventions seeking to address cost -related barriers to 
adherence have narrowly focused on price transparency and lowering insurance costs related to 
prescription medications.13-[ADDRESS_1135729] become more common with ACA initiatives.15 The 
typology of different approaches include integrated efforts between di fferent entities (e.g. state, 
health plan, health system) and social service and community resource organizations. 
Randomized controlled trials of screening tools for unmet SDHs have shown increased uptake 
of social resources and fewer unmet needs among patients.16-[ADDRESS_1135730] Protocol                                                                                                                                     Version 1-12 
  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135731] be comprehensive, feasible, evidence- based, and 
efficient. Activating patients to address health- related financial burden and unmet SDHs is an 
investment that would maximize the time of both patients and providers, and become 
generalizable to diverse practice settings. Technology -based approaches represent a 
promi sing, scalable approach to screen for SDHs, provide information on locally available 
resources to meet identified needs, and prompt patients to seek out resources, share 
information efficiently with their providers, and make behavior changes that can improve health 
status.22 Communication technologies such as smartphones and tablets that provide internet 
access are increasingly available to patients across the spectrum of socioeconomic status.23-24 
Text-messaging and interactive voice response (IVR) methods are effective in improving patient 
monitoring, self -care behaviors, adherence, and in turn disease control.25-30 They can also be 
integrated into health systems given the universal adoption of electronic he alth records. We 
reviewed >100 chronic disease and financial management/literacy mobile apps available on the 
market. We found that none link individuals to low- cost resources that comprehensively address 
health- related financial burden and SDHs, while also providing skills training and feedback in 
navigating complex healthcare and community resource infrastructures, and attending to other determinants of meeting disease management goals.  
Activating patients to address health- rel
 ated financial burden and SDHs could have 
broad translational impact and improve diabetes outcomes. The high prevalence of 
patients’ health -related financial burdens and unmet SDHs, the lack of attention these burdens 
receive in clinical settings, and the serious consequences of CRN on health all underscore the 
need to test and evaluate practical, scalable, and effective solutions to the spectrum of burdens 
impacting health. Through the proposed study, we will provide a more in- depth understanding of 
the extent to which automating screening to identify health- related financial burdens and unmet 
SDHs before clinic visits, and activating patients to take steps to access suggested resources 
and engage in self -care, impro ves disease control.  We will also identify the mechanisms 
through which this occurs. This contribution could have broad translational importance to improving clinical outcomes of complex patients and reducing health disparities in an era where 
delivery sys tems strapped for time and resources must re -orient to value- based reimbursement 
models.  
Unaddressed SDHs and socioeconomic vulnerabilities will be critical issues for our country 
i
nto the foreseeable future. Although the ACA increased access to care, gaps in health 
insurance eligibility and benefits persist, and costs to consumers are rising annually and creating significant national concern. Diabetes and many other chronic conditions have high out -
of-pocket costs for testing supplies and special foods that will likely never be fully covered, even 
with a single payer system. Automated resource  delivery through our intervention is expected to 
benefit a wide range of people, especially the under -insured, who comprise about 25% of the 
population (31 million people), primarily low and middle- income families.
33 
 
Current approaches to screen for and address health- related financial burden and unmet SDHs 
are fragmented, and not offered to all patients with or at risk for poor health outcomes. Accessing resources is heavily reliant on time -limited providers. We do not know whether and 
how addressing health- related financial burden and unmet SDH’s in clinical settings actually

  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135732] of our intervention on 
health status and disease control is different across groups defined by [CONTACT_195602]. 
Aim 2 will also provide evidence regarding behavioral mechanisms through which improved 
outcomes are achieved in Aim 1. The e- health intervention 1) includes generalizable resources, 
2) generates a summary of identified needs and resources for the patient to give their providers 
in an easily digestible format, and 3 ) can be easily integrated into comprehensive chronic 
disease self -management programs and delivery systems that do not have consistent 
processes for addressing economic issues or unmet social needs. Given the increasing 
penetration of health IT in low- resource populations, our approach of using a web- based 
intervention optimized to tablets and smartphones will be increasingly generalizable, and thus have the capacity to enhance health in high- risk groups. Our preliminary d ata (see Approach 
subsection) suggests that activating patients, automating the process to link them to resources, 
and providing automated follow- up to support self -care is highly acceptable and changes 
behavior. Our intervention will address a significant  gap in care by [CONTACT_819801] a practical, accessible, and 
scalable way of delivering options to meet diverse patient needs.

1.2.[ADDRESS_1135736] (HUM00097785) : CRN and unmet SDH screening 
and feedback  
The PI (with mentorship from co- investigators Heisler and Resnicow) recently completed a pi[INVESTIGATOR_819768]- an automated, pre- visit, e -health intervention designed to identify 
perceived financial burdens and unmet SDHs, and provide solutions.
6 (This initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] 
(HUM00097785) informed both the pi[INVESTIGATOR_819769] s of the study described in 
this protocol (HUM00149794)) Through the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we 1) successfully identified diabetes patients 
experiencing CRN or financial burden, 2) identified both health- related and broader unmet 
needs impacting patients’ self -management, and 3) prompted patients to address these risk 
factors; all wit hout relying on clinical staff and personnel to deploy the intervention. We recruited 
101 individuals with diabetes reporting CRN or perceived financial burden at the time of clinic visits at the University of Michigan Health System Metabolism, Endocrinology & Diabetes Clinic . 
Eligible participants were asked to use CareAvenue on a tablet (it took 5 minutes to complete 
the process) . CareAvenue first asked participants to identify their sources of financial burden 
related to their diabetes management and rat e each burden on a 5- point Likert scale. It then 
asked them to identify diabetes -specific and broader basic needs (e.g. food assistance, 
housing, employment) that they would like more information on. Based on their insurance and information preferences, CareAvenue then generated a list of both local and national resources. 
A trained research assistant then printed and gave the tailored resource list to the participant before the participant saw his/her provider. All resources underwent critical review by [CONTACT_819802].  
In this feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], outcomes of interest included CRN behaviors, uptake of resources, 
diabetes distress, and communication. Each domain was measured using items adapted from 
previous studies
33-35 at baseline and 2- months following participants’ use of CareAvenue . The 
Health IT Usability Evaluation Model (Health -ITUEM) framework36 informed the assessment of 
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of CareAvenue  via validated instruments.37-38  
The mean age of participants was 50 years (SD=15.3), 47% reported a household income 
<$40,000/year, and 37% were unemployed, thus increasing generalizability to 
socioeconomically vulnerable patients. Participants found the intervention to be relevant and 
useful. Acceptability of CareAvenue across 14 indicators was >90%, and we had a 94% 
retention rate at the 2- month follow -up.  
CareAvenue Protocol                                                                                                                                     Version 1-12 
  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135737] (see Table 
1). We saw changes in uptake of cost- reducing resources 2- months 
post intervention, including purchasing food at farmers’ 
markets and food assistance 
programs (32% to 36%), and use 
of online diabetes educational resources (29% to 40%), 
medicati ons savi ngs clubs through 
local retailers (9% to 15%), and support groups (9% to 16%).
6 More individuals reported that they discussed their concerns with 
health professionals (13% to 25%). We saw significant increases in household financial 
management measured through the Financial Management Behavior Scale (p<0.01).[ADDRESS_1135738] vulnerable participants: 
lowest income, low education, unemployed, taking 7 or more medications, high out -of-pocket 
diabetes -related expenses, moderate to high diabetes -related distress (see Table 1). Overall, 
our study found that regardless of patient health literacy, automated pre- visit screening and 
feedback for health -related financial burden was both feasible and acceptable and significantly 
improved uptake of resources, communication with health professionals, and fewer individuals 
were skippi[INVESTIGATOR_819770] a 2- month period.  
[ADDRESS_1135739] treatment adherence and unmet SDHs improves 
disease control, and the mechanisms through which primary and secondary outcomes are achieved. The specific aims of the study  are listed below.  
Aim 1 : D
etermine the effectiveness of  CareAvenue relative to usual care in improving 
glycemic control and patient -centered outcomes such as CRN behaviors and perceived 
financial burdens.  We hypothesize that participants randomized to CareAvenue will have  a 
change inHbA1c ( primary outcome) compared to usual care. We will measure the change in 
HbA1c at baseline, 6 months  (-2 weeks/+4 weeks), and 12 months  (-2 weeks/+4 weeks)  using 
an HbA1c machine. Additionally, we hypothesize that  other patient -centered outcomes 
(secondary outcomes ) will change  compared to usual care. Secondary outcomes will be 
measured at baseline, 6 months  (-2 weeks/+4 weeks), and 12 months  (-2 weeks/+4 weeks) . 
They include blood pressure (measured with an automated blood pressure cuff ), Cost -related 
non-adherence behaviors with prescribed treatment regimens related to diabetes, Cost -related 
non-adherence behaviors with prescribed treatment regimens related to other conditions being 
managed, Perceived financial burden, and unmet social risk factors .

 ____________________________________________________________________________________________  
10 Aim 2 : Examine mediators and moderators of the effectiveness of CareAvenue  on 
primary and secondary outcomes.  We hypothesize that the intervention will significantly 
improve skills and self -efficacy in uptake and use of resources leading to decreased financial 
burdens, perceived stress of unmet SDHs, and improved adherence to treatment regimens, with 
these changes being the primary mechanism through which improvements in glycemic control 
are achieved. We also hypothesize that CareAvenue will be most effective among patients with 
high need for resources and low self -efficacy in navigating resources at baseline.  
 
3 EXPECTED RISKS AND BENEFITS 
3.1 Expected Risks  
 
3.1.1 Confidentiality   
Risk: Breech of confidentiality of information and identification.  
Likelihood of r isk: Rare 
Seriousness to the subject:  Information about the participants health, financial situation, 
and demographic information connected to their identify (age, marital status, etc.) may be 
obtained by [CONTACT_819803]:  All recruitment and data collection activities will take 
place in private rooms.  All data collected will be coded so that no direct participant identifiers 
are linked with data. Access to the code that links data with identifiable information will be 
held only by [CONTACT_819804]. All other research staff, including the 
data collection staff, and the investigators will only have access to specific and select 
information on an 'as needed' basis. The coded database will be password protected and stored on a secured, encrypted University of Michigan drive.  
 
When data must be shared for study purposes it will be shared through the University of 
Michigan School of Public Health secure, HIPAA- compliant fax line or stored virtually via a 
secure, HIPAA -compliant web application hosted by [CONTACT_17901], DropBox at 
U-M, or through MiShare,  a secure virtual file transfer system hosted by [CONTACT_819805] & Services (HITS) . 
 Participant data for IVR  calls will be maintained by a HIPAA- compliant platform within the 
University of Michigan Health System. All participant data collected and transmitted through the intervention website will be sent encrypted via TLS/SSL secure transfer.   
 
SMS participant data will be stored on HIPAA -compliant University of Michigan servers. In 
order to send and receive SMS messages, the SMS platform will transmit and receive messages through Twilio. Messages will be automatically redacted from  Twilio's servers, to 
ensure that participants' messages and identifiable data such as phone numbers are not stored in Twilio's logs.  
 
To the extent that logbooks or paper records need to be maintained for purposes of the 
study, they will be kept locked in file cabinets in a locked room accessible to research staff 
only. All consent forms will be stored in the same manner. All data with i dentifiable

3.1.2 Risks Related to HbA1C Fingerstick  
 
Risk: Discomfort at the site of the blood draw from the HbA1c rapid test.  
Likelihood of risk:  Likely  
Seriousness:  Bruising, bleeding, or slight swelling at the site of the stick  
 
Risk: Fainting from the blood draw from the HbA1C rapid test  
Likelihood:  Rare  
Seriousness:  Participant will need professional medical assessment  
 Risk: Local infection from the blood draw from the HbA1C rapid test 
Likelihood:  Rare 
Seriousness:  Ranging from need for over the counter antibiotics to the need for 
professional medical treatment  
 
Measures taken to minimize the risk:  The first procedure of protecting participants 
from risks associated with the HbA1c test using a rapid fingerstick is proper training of all 
research staff taking these assessments in line with university of federal guidelines.  Staff of 
the University of Michigan Department of Pathology will thoroughly train research staff on 
taking HbA1c assessment using established protocols  (see letter of support) . Procedures 
include those that emphasize sanitation, cleaning the site of the prick with alcohol before and after, and properly disposing of gloves and fingersticks  after each assessment.  Once 
trained, research staff can train additional staff on use of the HbA1c machine.  A second 
protection for participants from risks associated with the HbA1c test using a rapid fingerstick is providing first aid and standard procedures in line with university and federal guidelines in 
the even t of an adverse health event.  All research staff will undergo Biosafety Training for 
Laboratory Personnel offered by [CONTACT_819806].  For participants in the virtual appointments, trained staff will provide additional 
support and instructions during the at- home testing of HbA1c.

4.1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
 Study participants will meet the following criteria:  
• 18- 75 years of age  
• Have access to a  telephone that can receive and send text messages  
• diagnosis of diabetes with prescribed anti -hyperglycemic medication  
• most recent (within the past 6 months) recorded hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of ≥7.5% for 
individuals ≤70 years and >8.0% for individuals between 70- 75 years in age  
• positive report of financial burden or CRN using screening questions developed and validated 
from prior work33-37 
 
Exclusion criteria include significant cognitive impairment precluding individuals from completing 
the study as evidenced by [CONTACT_819807] .  
 
4.2 Source of Participants  
We will recruit potential participants from the University of Michigan’s Diabetes  Research 
Registry  and the University of Michigan Medical School Office of Research DataDirect.  The 
Diabetes Research Registry and DataDirect meet HIPAA security and privacy requirements  and 
provide streamlined access to potential participants’ electronic health records (EHR).  The study 
team will be accessing participants’ electronic health records (EHR)  via the Diabetes Research 
Registry and the University of Michigan Medical School Office of Research DataDirect. Over 
6,000 (18– 75 years) diabetes patients are included in the registry and receive care at the 
University of Michigan's ambulatory care clinics. Thirty percent of registrants have type 1 
diabetes, and 70% have type 2 diabetes, with equal proportions of men (49.6%) and women 
(50.4%). Mean age is 54.3 ± 15.9 years, mean duration of diabetes is 15.8 ± 11.2 years, and 
30% of registrants are racial/ethnic minorities.[ADDRESS_1135741] ≤ 7 was only 
24%, and the proportion with HbA1c ≥9 was 24%. From our pi[INVESTIGATOR_819772], 77% of individuals approached and interested in participating reported either financial 
burden with their diabetes treatments or engaging in a CRN behavior, 47% reported a 
household income <$40,000/year, and 37% were unemployed. Based on these data and the 
high retention in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_819773]- up (94%), the Diabetes  Research Registry will provide 
an adequate recruitment pool of at least 1,500 eligible participants to achieve our recruitment and retention goals.   
 
4.3 Vulnerable Populations  
4.3.1 Inclusion of Women and Minorities : We will enroll eligible patients who give 
informed consent, regardless of their gender, race, or ethnicity.  We expect the study to roughly 
reflect the racial, ethnic, and gender distribution of the University of Michigan Diabetes 
Research Registry (DRR)’s  patients with diagnosed diabetes. The DRR has over 5,000 
registrants, 30% with type 1 diabetes and 70% with type [ADDRESS_1135742] equal 
proportions of men (49.6%) and women (50.4%), average age is 54.3 ± 15.9 years, and 
average duration of diabetes is 15.8 ± 11.2 (Mean ± SD) years. Thirty percent of DRR patients

4.3.2 Inclusion of Children: This study will focus on adults  with a diagnosis of diabetes 
over the age of 18. Individuals under the age of 18 will be excluded from this study given their 
financial dependence on an adult. The intervention is designed at the cognitive and 
developmental and decision- making ability of adults over the age of 18. Children may directly 
benefit from the intervention through the inclusion of adults, given that the intervention may benefit the household financial situation, therefore an additional intervention exclusive to 
children may be needlessly redundant.

inclusion/exclusion criteria over the phone. Those participants who are interested in being part 
of the study and are eligible to participate will be read pertinent parts of the  consent form in 
order to provide them with a thorough understanding of the potential risks and benefits (participants will also go through a full consent process prior to initial data collection). If a 
potential participant indicates they are interested a nd are screened eligible but are then difficult 
to reach, the study team will mail them the study flyer previously mentioned that was posted in UM locations and clinics.  
All recruitment and screening will take place in private rooms to ensure participant privacy. 
Messages left for the participant will not disclose any information about the potential participant. 
No information about the participant or study will be given to anyone who answers the phone 
other than the participant. All information with personal identifiers will be stored in either a locked cabinet in a locked office (when paper log books are needed) or on a secured drive on 
password protected computers.  
For patients who are not able to be reached, decline participation, or are ineligible, patient 
subject identifiers will be destroyed as soon as possible once one of these terminating events 
occurs. Data will be collected from people who indicate they are not interested in participating in 
the study  (i.e., reason for non- interest , socio -demographics  for participants who are eligible and 
still not interested) . We will also collect ineligibility reason  for people who are determined to be 
ineligible to participate in the study . This data will be anonymized with all personal identifiers 
attached to the information destroyed. The aggregate, anonymized data will be kept for analysis.

adherence behavior in chronic disease management broadly.29-30 We will develop a bank of text 
messages tailored to intervention content and oriented towards behavioral activation to follow 
up with resources. Text messages will be sent to participants 3- 5 times per week  (4-5 times per 
week for intervention participants  and 3- 4 time s a week for control participants ) for [ADDRESS_1135753] , whereas the control 
messages do not. Both intervention and control participants will receive a text message each 
week asking them to respond with how they rate their diabetes management. A feedback text response will be sent back to participants based on their diabetes management rati ng. IVR calls 
allow patients to receive information and respond using their mobile or landline telephone. 
Additionally, for the intervention participants we will develop IVR messages that inquire about 
follow- up with resources and ease of access, and automated messages back to the study team  
if the participant reports needing additional help in navigating resources . IVR calls will be placed 
on days and times that the intervention participant  indicates are convenient, with automatic call -

8.1 Preliminary analyses  
We will examine baseline clinical differences between study arms and use them as model 
covariates as appropriate to address potential uncontrolled confounding. We will use t -tests and 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess effects of covariates (e.g., gender, age, education, health insurance type) on continuous outcomes (e.g., HbA1c). For categorical variables, we will calculate two -way contingency tables (e.g. % improved by [INVESTIGATOR_216]), and use odds ratios and chi -
square tests to evaluate differences in proportions by [CONTACT_30157]. These results will be used to guide multivariate regression analyses.  
 
8.2 Regression models  
For the primary outcome (HbA1c), we will fit a longitudinal mixed- effects model to all 
repeated measurements during the pre -randomization baseline period and the one- year 
intervention period. The model will have the intervention (yes/no) as the main independent

20 variable and HbA1c accounted for as a repeated measure within patients. Thus, we will model 
HbA1c as a function of fixed effects for the treatment arm (the intervention group vs. the control 
group), the observation period (baseline vs. one- year intervention period), and a treatment -by-
time period interaction term, with adjustment for confounding covariates (age, gender, race, 
income, health insurance type, comorbidities, health literacy). For this model, the coefficient of 
the treatment -by-time period interaction effect estimates the key parameter of interest: changes 
in HbA1c levels. Random effects are included in the model to adjust for HbA1c variation over time within patients. We will take a similar modeling approach to secondary outcome measures (CRN be haviors, perceived financial burdens, perceived stress of unmet SDHs). We will also 
dichotomize outcomes based on standard thresholds (eg., baseline HbA1c 8- 9% vs > 9%) and 
use similar mixed -effects logistic regression models to test differences in HbA1c, CRN 
behaviors, perceived financial burdens, and perceived stress of unmet SDHs across treatment arms.  
Among those randomized to CareAvenue  in Aim 1, we will assess the change in magnitude 
of the outcome coefficient’s association with the intervention before and after the adjustment of mediators of interest (see Figure 1, conceptual model). We will examine the Lagrange Multiplier 
and Wald Tests to consider the deletion or inclusion of paths based on our hypotheses.
[ADDRESS_1135760] for group differences (i.e. intervention vs. control) in latent constructs and in the paths between these constructs. This method will allow us to estimate the 
intervention effects on the constructs directly as well as their relationships to one another.

will follow guidelines for adequate reporting of SEM using three goodness -of-fit indices: Bentler -
Bonnet’s Normed Fit Index (NFI), Bentler -Bonnet’s Non- Normed Fit Index (NNFI), and the

total of 5 10 participant s (25 5 per arm) with outcome data to show a 0.[ADDRESS_1135766]- generated 
action- plan to alert them of their needs and possibly receive additional support in accessing 
services. Although the intervention is targeted at the individual, physicians may change their 
behavior based on their interaction with treatment group  patients and begin to better address 
unmet needs with control patients, thus raising the issue of contamination. That is, due to interactions with intervention patients, providers may alter “usual care.” This could diminish the 
effect size between intervention and control patients. One solution to this problem would be to 
conduct a cluster -randomized trial, which would obviate such contamination. We concluded, 
however, that because of the large number of unique providers seeing patients in the Diabetes 
Registry, the likelihood that a doctor will have patients in each arm is low. Further, some cross -
over is inevitable because many patients in the Diabetes Registry see both a specialist and primary care provider, who may be randomized to different arms. Finally, a cluster randomized 
design would have required a large increase in sample size and cost. Although potential contamination lowers the treatment effect, we consider our design a strength of the study 
compared to a cluster randomized trial because baseline and follow -up assessments will allow 
us to quantify how much the control group also benefited from increased communication about low-cost treatment options with providers in the absence of the e -Health tool (comparing pre- 
and post - data among control patients within providers). This will demonstrate a generalized 
effect for the whole practice. We have increased the sample size by 3 % to account for the 
potential that physicians’ behavior will spi[INVESTIGATOR_819776]. To account for a potential

 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
NIH Study Number: 1 R01 DK116715 -01A1  
Title:  I mproving diabetes outcomes and health disparities through a patient activation intervention 
addressing unmet resource needs  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_819762] R. Patel,  Phd, MPH  
 I. Overview  
A. Study Purpose  
The purpose of this study is to determine the extent to which activating diabetes patients to address 
health- related financial burdens that impact treatment adherence and unmet social risk factors improves 
disease control, and the mechanisms through which primary and secondary outcomes are achieved. The goal of this study  is to evaluate CareAvenue on health outcomes - an automated, e- health screening, 
feedback and skills training intervention that addresses health- related financial burden and unmet SDHs.
 
 
B. Adherence Statement  
The Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) outlined below for ( 1 R01 DK116715- 01A1) will adhere 
to the protocol approved by [CONTACT_742598] (IRBMED), National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK), and the study Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
 
C
. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
The purpose of the study DSMB is to monitor the safety and conduct of the study. The responsibilities 
of the DSMB are outlined in the charter.  
 II. Adverse Events, Other Reportable Incidents and Occurrences, and Unanticipated Problems    
A. Assessment of Participant Risks   
Potential risks for this study include:  
• A common side effect of the finger stick blood draw is localized discomfort or bruising  
• In rare cases, infection may occur as a result of the capi[INVESTIGATOR_689386]  
• In rare cases, fainting may occur as a result of the capi[INVESTIGATOR_819779], bruising, fainting, infection, or any other unexpected adverse reactions to the capi[INVESTIGATOR_819780]. All identified risks are addressed in the study protocol and have been outlined in the study consent form.  
All research staff will undergo training in line with university and federal guidelines. Staff of the 
University of Michigan Department of Pathology  will thoroughly train research staff on taking HbA1c 
assessment using established protocols that emphasize sanitation, cleaning the site of the prick with alcohol before and after, and properly disposing of gloves and fingersticks after each assessment.  Once 
trained, research staff can train additional staff on use of the HbA1c machine.  All research staff will 
undergo Biosafety Training for Laboratory Personnel offered by [CONTACT_819818]. First aid will be available onsite site at the location of testing. Study HbA1C testing protocols can be found in Appendix 1.  
i. Adverse Events  
Adverse Events (AEs) are events that involve physiological, social, economic, or psychological 
harm to subjects. They may include symptoms, abnormal test results, a response to the study procedures, or any combination of these.  Adverse events may also indicate risks of harm to other 
CareAvenue Protocol                                                                                                                                     Version 1-12 
  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135781] manager  and PI [INVESTIGATOR_819781], symptoms, or occurrences that are unusual for them to experience whether they believe they are related to the study or not. Additionally, the study team will formally assess for Adverse 
Events/Serious Adverse Events at the Follow -up 1 ([ADDRESS_1135782] baseline) and Follow -up 2 (12- months 
post baseline) data collection time points. The study team will utilize case report forms to collect this information from participants. Specific safety data the study team will assess includes:  
• Discomfort, bruising, infection, fainting or unexpected adverse reactions to the capi[INVESTIGATOR_819782]1c measurement  
• Negative outcomes related to use of the CareAvenue website (intervention group), Guest 
Assistance Program services (control group), receiving IVR calls (intervention group), or 
receiving text messages (intervention and control groups). This includes participant concerns related to privacy and safety of their information.  
• Events resulting in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or emergency department visits  
• Death (reported to the study team by [CONTACT_819819])  
• Other non- specified events the participant shares  
In addition to self -reporting, all data collectors will be instructed to report any indicators of adverse 
events to the project manager  as soon as possible and not more than by [CONTACT_819820]. 
Indicators of adverse events may be observations of study subjects during data collection or reports made by [CONTACT_819821]. Once the event has been reported to the project Manager, the project Manager  will inform the PI. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_819783] a determination on the expectedness and relatedness of the event to the study using the University of Michigan Medical School Office of Research guidelines (see Appendix 2). This will occur within 24 hours of the initial report of the adverse event.   
ii. Other Reportable Incidents and Occurrences  
Other Reportable Incidents and Occurrences (ORIOs) are events in which no one suffered actual 
harm but indicate that there is a potential for future adverse events to occur. This includes events that may increase risk, alter the risk -benefit assessment, affect a participant’s willingness to participate in the 
study or any departure from the human subject protection regulations and policies set forth by [CONTACT_1201], NIDDK, or in this DSMP.  
iii. Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated Problems (UaPs) are events that are unexpected, related or possibly related to the 
study, and suggests that participation in the study places the participant or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously thought. Unanticipated problems do not include events in which harm has already occurred (which would be classified as an adverse event) or events in which potential harm or risk to subjects occurs (which would be classified as an ORIO).
 UaPs may happen to participants or non-
partici pants who are affected by a person taking part in the study.

the issue of contamination. That is, due to interactions with intervention subjects, providers may alter “usual care.” This could diminish the effect size between treatment groups. One solution to this problem would be to conduct a cluster -randomized trial, which would obviate such contamination. We concluded, 
however, that because of the large number of unique providers seeing patients in the Diabetes Registry, the likelihood that a doctor will have patients in each treatment arm is low. Further, some cross -over is 
inevitable because many patients in the Diabetes Registry see both a specialist and primary care provider, who may be randomized to different arms. Finally, a cluster randomized design would have required a large increase in sample size and cost. Although potential contamination lowers the treatment effect, we consider our design a strength of the study compared to a cluster randomized trial because 
baseline and follow -up assessments will allow us to quantify how much the control group also benefited 
from increased communication about low -cost treatment options with providers in the absence of the e-
Health tool (comparing pre- and post - data among control patients within providers). This will demonstrate 
a generalized effect for the whole practice. We have increased the sample size by 3 % to account for the 
potential that physicians’ behavior will spi[INVESTIGATOR_819786]. To account for a potential 12% loss 
to follow -up, we will recruit [ADDRESS_1135787] manager . Additionally, the DSMB will review adherence on an annual 
basis.  
 
The annual report  provided to NIDDK  will include the following information:  
• A summary of AEs , SAEs , ORIOs, and UaPs  
• A comparison of AEs rates with those anticipated at the study outset  
• Statement regarding any loss of confidentiality that occurred, if applicable, and remedial 
steps taken  
• Any protocol deviations and remedial steps taken  
• Any communications with the IRB  
• Recruitment and retention over the reporting period including the reason for subject drop out  
• Study progress toward stated aims  
• A comparison of study progress to the timeline set at the outset of the study  
 
C. DSMB guidelines for recommending action  
The DSMB will monitor the safety and conduct of the study. The board will make recommendations to the 
study team which may include study protocol modification, study suspension, or study termination. The 
CareAvenue Protocol                                                                                                                                     Version 1-12 
  Date: 8-30-2021

 recommendations will be made at the DSMB’s discretion and in accordance with the following specific 
guidelines:  
• If study recruitment is more than 50% behind the recruitment timeline  
• If participants report repeated AE/SAE directly related to the study intervention or their study involvement  
• If there are consistent breaches of patient confidentiality either at the data collection site or 
through storage of data  
• The DSMB will request unmasking of closed session reports at its discretion and if analyses indicate:  
Half of participants experience a significant increase in HbA1c levels through the course of the study as 
measured by [CONTACT_755331]1c collected at follow -up data collection time points  
 IV. Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained from each subject at entry into the study. I nformed consent 
will be treated as an ongoing process. The process will begin with recruitment and continue throughout the subjects’ involvement in the study. Subjects will be provided with the consent form prior to baseline data collection. Subjects will be given time to thoroughly read the consent form 
and ask any questions prior to signing the form. Data collectors will offer to read the entire consent 
form aloud to the subject. At subsequent data collection points, data collectors will reiterate that participation is voluntary and that subjects may withdraw at any point in time from the study .  
V. Data Quality and Management  
A. Data collection review    
All screening and survey data will be downloaded on a weekly basis for auditing and to identify and 
address any data discrepancies. All data will be collected and entered by [CONTACT_3647]. The data manager will be responsible for downloading and auditing all data. In addition to review of data collection by [CONTACT_58047], the DSMB will review the data on an annual basis and ensure that protocols are being followed in data collection and the quality of the data is not compromised. Internal interim 
monitoring will occur on a regular and continuous basis in the form of data collection auditing and safety 
data monitoring throughout the study. As noted in the charter, the unmasked biostatistician will prepare reports on a semi -annual basis.  
 
B. Measures to insure data integrity and protection of databases.  
All data will be collected through Qualtrics which uses Transport Layer Security to encrypt 
information. Data will be downloaded and audited for data quality on a weekly basis by [CONTACT_87137] . 
The Data Manager  will store all downloaded data in a secure, password protected, encrypted University 
of Michigan drive. Back up databases will be stored before a new download is initiated. No databases will ever be overwritten. Access to the drive storing the databases w ill be restr icted to the PI, Data Manager, 
project manager, and study biostatistician.   
VI. Confidentiality  
In order to maintain subject confidentiality, all study  staff will be trained in Good Clinical Practice and 
Responsible Conduct of Research. The Data Manager  will audit data collection processes on a weekly 
basis in order to ensure study procedures related to data safety are being followed. Any issues will be reported to the project manager  and PI. Weekly meetings will be held between the project manager  and 
research staff and data collectors to provide an opportunity for discussing general interviewing issues and 
issues of confidentiality. The project manager  will report directly to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a weekly basis or per the 
timeline listed above in the case of adverse events.  
All recruitment and data collection activities will take place in private rooms to help protect subjects’ 
CareAvenue Protocol                                                                                                                                     Version 1-12 
  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135788] information on an 'as needed' basis in order to conduct recruitment, data 
collection, or the intervention. The coded database will be password protected and stored on a secured, 
encrypted University of Michigan drive.  
When data must be shared for study purposes (e.g. potential Diabetes Registry subject lists, reports 
to the DSMB), it will be shared through the University of Michigan School of Public Health secure, HIPAA -
compliant fax line or stored virtually via a secur e, HIPAA -compliant web application hosted by [CONTACT_361341], DropBox at U -M, or through MiShare, a secure virtual file transfer system hosted 
by [CONTACT_819816] & Services (HITS) .   
Participant data for IVR calls will be maintained by a HIPAA -compliant platform within the University 
of Michigan Health System. All participant data collected and transmitted through the intervention website 
will be sent encrypted via TLS/SSL secure trans fer.  
SMS participant data will be stored on HIPAA -compliant University of Michigan servers. In order to 
send and receive SMS messages, the SMS platform will transmit and receive messages through Twilio. Messages will be automatically redacted on Twilio's servers, to ensure that participants' messages and identifiable data such as phone numbers are not stored in Twilio's logs.  
The CareAvenue website will not have access to any participant identifiers. The website will only 
collect responses to content questions and progress of website completion. Progress of website completion will be securely transmitted through an application programming interface hosted on a HIPAA -
compliant server within University of Michigan Health System and will be encrypted using TSL or SSL encryption.  
To the extent that logbooks or paper records for individual subjects need to be maintained for 
purposes of data collection or conducting the intervention, they will be kept locked in file cabinets in a locked room accessible to research staff only. All consent forms will be stored in the same manner. All data with subject identifiers will only be destroyed as soon as it is no longer needed for completion of study related activities.

Upper Arm Blood Pressure Detailed Testing Protocol  
 
Preparation for the Blood Pressure Measurement:  
1. Ask participant to remove tight -fitting clothing or tight rolled up sleeve from their left upper 
arm. 
2. Have the participant sit upright on a chair with their feet flat on the ground. The 
participant’s arm should rest on a table so that the arm cuff is at the same level as their 
heart.  
3. Ask the participant to remain still and refrain from speaking while the blood pressure 
measurement is taken.  
 
Preforming the Blood Pressure Measurement:  
1. Insert the arm cuff air plug into the air jack, located on the left side of the automatic blood pressure machine.  
2. Wrap the arm cuff firmly around the participant’s left upper arm and secure the cuff using 
the fabric fastener.  
a. The bottom edge of the arm cuff should be about ½ inch above the elbow  
b. The air tube attached to the arm cuff should be located inside the participant’s 
arm and should align with their middle finger.  
3. Press the START/STOP button located on the bottom right of the blood pressure 
machine’s visual display. The arm cuff with start to inflate automatically.  
a. The irregular heartbeat symbol will be displayed at the top of the display screen 
if the monitor detects an irregular rhythm two or more times during the 
measurement.  
b. The movement error symbol will be displayed at the top of the display screen if 
the participant moves during the measurement. Remove the arm cuff and wait 
2-[ADDRESS_1135791] the participant’s blood pressure  
a. The blood pressure machine displays the systolic blood 
pressure above the diastolic blood pressure. The smaller number indicates the participant’s pulse.

Intervention Addressing Unmet Resource Needs      
 
This charter defines the roles and responsibilities of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board 
(DSMB) for the study: Improving Diabetes Outcomes and Health Disparities through a Patient Activation Intervention Addressing Unmet Resource Needs. This study is funded by [CONTACT_819826] (NIDDK).  
 
The DSMB will serve in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this charter. DSMB members will review and agree to the charter at the initial meeting. If changes to the charter are necessary, the DSMB will review and affirm their agreement with the cha nges. Their 
concurrence will be noted in the DSMB meeting summary.  
 DSMB RESPONSIBILITIES  
The first responsibilities of the DSMB will be to review the final protocol, informed consent documents, and plans for data and safety monitoring and provide input to the investigators on major changes that should be made. Ultimately, the DSMB will approve  the clinical study 
named above so the study can begin enrolling patients.  
 After initial approval, and at periodic intervals during the course of the study, the DSMB 
responsibilities are to:  
• Provide input to the investigators on the progress of the study, including periodic assessments 
of data quality and timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of the study sites, and other facto rs that may affect study 
outcomes  
• Review serious adverse events and other safety reports and make recommendations 
regarding protection of the safety of study participants  
• Ensure data integrity and confidentiality  
• Provide input to assist the investigators in protecting the safety of the study participants  
• Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the study  
• Provide input to the investigators on modification of the study protocol or possible early termination of the study because of attainment of study objectives, safety concerns, low likelihood of showing a benefit of the intervention, or inadequate performan ce (such as 
enrollment and retention problems)

[CONTACT_149463]. The reports will be distributed to the DSMB at least [ADDRESS_1135797] Protocol                                                                                                                                     Version 1-12 
  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135798] of two parts: an Open Report and a 
Closed Report.  
 Open Session Report  
This portion of the report provides information on study aspects such as accrual, baseline 
characteristics, and other general information on study status. This report is shared with all 
investigators involved with the clinical study. The reports contained in this section will include:  
• Comparison of Target Enrollment to Actual Enrollment by [CONTACT_43380]  
• Overall Participant Status including: Participants Screened, Enrolled, Active, Completed and 
Terminated  
• Demographic and Key Baseline Characteristics by [CONTACT_26374]  
• Treatment Duration for Participants who Discontinue Therapy  
 
Closed Session Report  
This report will contain data on study outcomes, including safety data , and Adverse 
Events/Serious Adverse Events by [CONTACT_3445]. Data will be presented by [CONTACT_546549]; however, the DSMB may request that the treatment groups be unmasked to ensure that there are no untoward treatment effects. The Closed Session Report is considered confidential and will be destroyed at t he conclusion of the meeting. Data files to be used for 
interim analyses will have undergone established editing procedures to the extent possible. This report will not be viewed by [CONTACT_819831].  
 MEETING FORMAT  
An appropriate format for DSMB meetings consists of an open, closed, and executive session. This format may be modified as needed.  
 Open Session  
Members of the DSMB, the PI, staff members of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_819797]. Issues discussed will include the conduct and progress of the study, including patient recruitment, data quality, general adherence and toxicity issues, compliance with protocol, and any other logistical matters that may affect either the conduct or outcome of the study. Proposed protocol amendments will also be presented in this session. Patient -specific 
data and treatment group data may not be presented in the open session.  
 Closed Session  
The closed session will be attended only by [CONTACT_39129], and the unmasked study biostatistician.
 The discussion at the closed session is completely confidential. All materials from 
the closed session will be destroyed at the end of the meeting. Analyses of outcome data are reviewed by [CONTACT_546549], including baseline characteristics, primary  and 
secondary outcomes, adverse events, adherence and dropouts, and examination of any relevant subgroups. The DSMB may request unmasking of the data for ei ther safety or efficacy 
CareAvenue Protocol                                                                                                                                     Version 1-12 
  Date: 8-30-[ADDRESS_1135799] of the study. The DSMB can be unmasked at any time if trends develop either for 
benefit or harm to the participants.  
The DSMB will make a recommendation for either continuation or termination of the study. Sound rationale for either decision (continuation or termination of the study) should be presented. Termination may be suggested by [CONTACT_350425]. Reasons for e arly 
termination include:  
• Serious adverse effects in entire treatment group or in a dominating subgroup  
• Greater than expected beneficial effects  
• A statistically significant difference by [CONTACT_93528]  
• Logistical or data quality problems so severe that correction is not feasible  
 DOCUMENTATION OF DSMB MEETINGS

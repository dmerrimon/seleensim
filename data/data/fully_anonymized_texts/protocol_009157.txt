Protocol Number: SCR-012 
Title: Clinical study to investigate the effect of selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors and an opi[INVESTIGATOR_674352]: Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_674353]: Jan Matousek 
Study Phase: 1 
Study Period: This is a 3-period, double-blind, randomized crossover study. The 
duration of each treatment period will  be 21 days in addition to a three-
week washout between periods. The duration of study participation will 
be 106 days (excluding the screening period). 
Study Site: Spaulding Clinical Research  Unit, West Bend, Wisconsin 
Background and 
Motivation: A well-known and potentially fatal a dverse reaction associated with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_40499], partic ularly in the scenario of misuse, abuse, or 
when coadministered with certain other drugs is that people ‘stop 
breathing’. Research suggests this is caused by a reduced ventilatory 
response to increasing levels of  carbon dioxide. In August 2016, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included boxed warnings about increased potential for respir atory depression with co-use of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199721].
[ADDRESS_911275] similar adverse reactions  when combined with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Subsequently, FDA performed a review of the literature and identified 
13 psychotropic drugs for evaluation in an in vivo animal study (using a 
rat model). The in vivo study identi fied 4 drugs that had significant 
effects when combined with oxyc odone on arterial carbon dioxide.
2 
Two drugs (quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_674354]) were selected for further 
evaluation in a human clinical study evaluating drug effects on 
hypercapnic ventilation.  
To study the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_674355], FDA used a procedure referred to as 
Read rebreathing.3-4 With Read rebreathing, study participants rebreathe 
through a circuit with increased levels of O 2 and CO 2 . The artificially 
increased levels of CO 2 trigger the subjects to increase ventilation. This 
“hypercapnic ventilatory response”  can be decreased by [CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438], 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and other drugs.5-19 
The previous study, which included 5-days of study drug dosing with 
oxycodone administered on da y 1 or 5 showed quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_327528]-

CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_911276] under steady state conditions 
As part of this proposed study with a longer dosing duration and 
different SSRIs, hypercapnic vent ilation will be assessed under 
hyperoxic and hypoxic gas levels usi ng a modified Read rebreathing 
approach referred to as Duffin rebr eathing. These modifications allow 
for critical physiological measuremen ts and thresholds to be captured 
that can then be used to model the effects of drugs when there are dynamic changes in PO
2 and PCO 2, such as during a real-world opi[INVESTIGATOR_46229].47-52  
Objectives and Endpoints: The objectives of this study are: 
Primary Objectives 
Primary objectives include the following: 
x To study ventilatory effect s of SSRIs (paroxetine or 
escitalopram) combined w ith oxycodone compared to 
oxycodone alone after [ADDRESS_911277] s of SSRIs (paroxetine or 
escitalopram) compared to placebo  after 20 days of SSRI dosing

Sample Collection The following samples should be collected and processed as follows. 
Number of samples collected through out the study can be found in the 
Schedule of Events (see Appendix): 
The PK blood samples (6 mL each) will be collected into tubes 
containing K2EDTA, inverted several times to mix the blood with the 
anticoagulant, and placed in an ice bath. Within 30 minutes of 
collection, the samples will be ce ntrifuged for 10 minutes, at 3000 
relative centrifugal force (RCF), at 4°C, by a study team member. 
The plasma will be separated using a disposable plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_674359] A 
(primary) and Aliquot B (backup) . The plasma samples will be 
appropriately labeled and stored fro zen at -70°C or below within 30 
minutes after aliquoting until shipment. Temperature monitoring logs should be maintained and accessible fo r review by [CONTACT_11200].  
The Aliquot A samples (primary) will be  shipped first, on dry ice, to the 
bioanalytical laboratory at FDA fo r processing when requested by [CONTACT_103]. The Aliquot B samples (bac kup) will be held for a second 
shipment after completion of all Aliquot A sample shipment(s) and the timing of the Aliquot B shipment will be communicated by [CONTACT_456]. 
None of the PK blood samples will be st ored at the clinical facility for 
future use. 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments: Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be  collected on the following days 
at the approximate time s for each study period: 
x Day 5, 6, 11, 12, 20, and 21: 0 (pre-dose), 3, 4, 5, 8 hr (and 24 hr 
for Day 6, 12, and 21) 
x Day 2 and 16: 0 (pre-dose), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, [ADDRESS_911297] venipuncture or by [CONTACT_674422]. There wi ll be a total of 51 PK samples per participant for 
each study period. 
For each participant, the following PK  parameters will be determined 
for oxycodone and oxymorphone (days 6, 12, and 21) and paroxetine escitalopram, and escitalopram metabolites (days 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 16, 20, 
and 21):

During Duffin’s rebreathing procedure, subjects will be placed in an 
upright position (90
o angle) on a bed and connected to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_674360]. Subjects will we ar a facemask and breathe from a 
pre-filled rebreathing ba g containing approximately 4 L of either a 
hyperoxic-hypercapnic (24% O 2, 6% CO 2, N2 balanced) or hypoxic-
hypercapnic (6% O 2, 6% CO 2, N2 balanced) gas mixture. During this 
study, subjects will be asked to brea th room air for 5 minutes (relaxation 
stage) and then to hyperv entilate (primarily th rough deep breathing) 
room air voluntarily for 5 minutes (hyperventilati on stage). Thereafter, 
subjects will be switched to the rebr eathing bag and perform rebreathing 
assessments at one of the 2 different isoxic end tidal PO 2, i.e., 150 
mmHg and 50 mmHg. The isoxia at 150 mmHg or 50 mmHg end-tidal PO
2 will be maintained by [CONTACT_1541] a computer-controlled flow of 
100% O 2 to the rebreathing bag.  
Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_674361] (see separate SOP) will be performed before and 
after each rebreathing procedure (ex cept not in between the hyperoxic 
and hypoxic paired assessment) while the ambient light is kept at a 
consistent level. The rubber cup of  the pupi[INVESTIGATOR_674362] 1 minute later.

free from external stimuli. 
Different ventilation, cardiovasc ular, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], sedation, and ECG 
measures that will be summarized include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
Ventilation and Cardiova scular Assessments:  
x During rebreathing stage

 In addition, PK/PD relationships will  be evaluated between study drugs 
and a subset of pharmacodynamic endpoints (ventila tion, pupi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], 
ECG).  
Safety Assessments: 
 Safety will be evaluated in terms of  adverse events (AEs), clinical 
laboratory results (hematology, serum ch emistry, and urinalysis), vital 
sign measurements (blood pressure, hear t rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral 
body temperature), safety 12-lead ECG, and physical examination 
findings. 
Sample Size and Threshold Determination: Approximately 25 healthy participants are planned for enrollment. A 
previous study (20 partic ipants) with paroxetine showed a decrease of 
10.2 L/min in VE55 for paroxetine (40 mg) combined with oxycodone (10 mg) compared to oxycodone alone  after 5 days of dosing with 
paroxetine. Similarly, there was a 9.3 L/min decrease in VE55 for paroxetine compared to placebo after [ADDRESS_911300] deviation in assess ments was approximately 6.5 L/min. 
Assuming a similar effect size with paroxetine and escitalopram at day 
20 and 21, the planned number of participants allows for a 40% drop out rate while maintaining at least 90% po wer for separate one-sided tests at 
a 0.025 significance level with th e multiple primary endpoints. 
 
Statistical Methods: All data will be presented in data  listings. Data from subjects excluded 
from an analysis population will be pres ented in the data listings but not 
included in the calculation of su mmary statistics. The number of 
subjects who enroll in the study and the number and percentage of 
subjects who complete each asse ssment will be presented. The 
frequency and percentage of subjects  who withdraw or discontinue from 
the study and the reason for withdr awal or discontinuation will be 
summarized. Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by [CONTACT_308299]. 
Descriptive statistics will be us ed to summarize demographic and 
baseline subject characteristics. For continuous variables, the mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD), minimum, and maximum values will

 be reported. For categorical (no minal) variables, the number and 
percentage of subjects (or observations) will be reported. 
The rebreathing analysis populati on will include all subjects who 
completed at least one rebreathing assessment on any day or at any 
timepoint. Specific information on an alysis populations for different 
pharmacodynamic measures wi ll be described in the Statistical Analysis 
Plan (SAP). 
 
Primary and Secondary Ventilation Analyses 
Multiple primary analyses are planned for each drug. The first primary 
analysis will be VE55 on day 21 at 5 h (hyperoxic) between oxycodone 
with paroxetine or escitalopram  compared to oxycodone alone. The 
second primary analysis will be VE 55 on day 20 at 5 h (hyperoxic) 
between paroxetine or escitalopram compared to placebo. Since Day [ADDRESS_911301] an adjustment for multiplicity using a Bonferroni correction (each day will be tested at a 0.025 significa nce level). No adjustments will be 
made for separate testing of par oxetine or escita lopram since the 
treatments are considered separate interventions in the study.  
A linear mixed effects model will be  developed using all study data 
from hyperoxic assessments . Fixed effects will include treatment, 
period, sequence, and baseline VE55 (i.e., VE55 obtained at 0 h on Day 
-1 of each treatment period).  S ubject will be included as a random 
effect on the intercept.  If a subj ect’s baseline VE55 for a treatment 
period is not available, then the ba seline value for that period will be 
calculated based on the median of al l other baseline values for that 
subject from other study periods. If a subject does not have any 
completed baseline VE55 data, the s ubject will be assigned a baseline 
VE55 equal to the median of the population.  
To demonstrate an effect when oxyc odone is combined with paroxetine 
(or escitalopram) compared to oxycodone the upper bound of the one-
sided 97.5% CI of the least-squa re mean VE55 difference between 
treatments must not overlap 0 L/min.  Similarly, to demonstrate an 
effect of paroxetine (or escital opram) compared to placebo the upper 
bound of the one-sided 97.5% CI of the least-square mean VE55 difference between treatments mu st not overlap 0 L/min. Each 
comparison will be performed separately (i.e.,‘trt’ as ‘paroxetine’ or ‘escitalopram’).:  
x H0: VE55oxy+trt - VE55oxy  0 L/min 
x HA: VE55ox

 For secondary endpoints, effects of paroxetine or escitalopram with 
oxycodone compared to oxycodone alone will also be performed using 
the same comparisons on day 6 and day 12. 
As additional secondary endpoints, effe cts of paroxetine or escitalopram 
alone compared to placebo will be determined on day 5 and 11 using the same model. Additional details on testing of ventilation secondary 
endpoints are discussed in the SAP. 
Pharmacokinetics : Concentrations will be determined at approximately 
specified timepoints. O xycodone and oxymorphone C
max and AUC will 
be summarized on days 6, 12, and [ADDRESS_911302] atistics.  
The PK parameters will be analyz ed using noncompartmental methods 
based on actual sampling times. All parameters will be calculated using SAS or R software. Mean  and individual concentration time profiles 
will be presented in graphs. 
Additional PK parameter analyses in cluding but not limited to measures 
listed under Pharmacokinetic Assessments will be included in the SAP. 
Additional Pharmacodynamics on Ventilatory Assessment Days : 
Mean and standard deviations for baseline minute ventilation, 
ventilatory recruitment th reshold, slope of the PCO
2-ventilatory 
response curve, and the extrapolated  ventilatory recr uitment threshold 
will be calculated for each subject at each rebreathing assessment using data from the rebreathin g stage. Mean and standard deviation for minute 
ventilation, tidal volume, resp iratory rate, end-tidal PCO
2, end-tidal 
PO 2, oxygen saturation, and heart rate will be calculated using data from 
the relaxation stage. Number of apneic events lasting > 10s will be counted for each subject, day, and rebreathing assessment during the 
relaxation stage. Full details will be  described in a separate SAP. 
Additional pupi[INVESTIGATOR_674361] (e.g., ventilatio n, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], heart 
rate, maximum pupil diameter before constriction) as specified in the protocol will be reported with standard descriptive statistics.

 Intensive ECG assessments will be  performed on Days 2 and Day 16. 
The QT interval will be corrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula (QTc=QT/RR
1/3). The J-T peak interval will be corrected for heart 
rate using the formula (J-T peakC = J-T peak/RR0.58). Baseline will be the 
mean of the 3 predose EC G extractions of Day 1. 
Exposure-response analyses will be  performed for the change from

with a focus on treatment-emergent AEs. Vital sign measurements will 
be summarized using descriptive stat istics by [CONTACT_7206]. All values will

 1. INTRODUCTION 
A well-known and potentially fatal adve rse reaction associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_50352], particularly in the scenario of misuse, abus e, or when co-administered 
with certain other drugs is that people ‘stop breathing’. Research sugge sts this is caused 
by a reduced respi[INVESTIGATOR_674364] (CO 2). In August 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included 
boxed warnings about increased potential for respi[INVESTIGATOR_674365]-use of 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_199721].[ADDRESS_911304] similar adverse 
reactions when combined with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  
Subsequently, FDA performed a review of th e literature and identified 13 psychotropic 
drugs for evaluation in an in vivo animal study (using a rat model) . The in vivo study 
identified [ADDRESS_911305] s when combined with oxycodone on arterial 
carbon dioxide.2 Two drugs (quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_674366]) were selected for further 
evaluation in a human clinical study eval uating drug effects on hype rcapnic ventilation.  
To study the effects of opi[INVESTIGATOR_674367], FDA used a procedure re ferred to as Read rebreathing.3-4 With Read 
rebreathing, study participants rebreathe th rough a circuit with increased level of O 2 and 
CO 2 (93% O 2 and 7% CO 2). The artificially increased levels of CO 2 trigger the subjects to 
increase ventilation. This “hypercapnic ventilatory response” can be decreased by 
[CONTACT_5060][INVESTIGATOR_2438], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and other drugs.5-[ADDRESS_911306] shown different selec tive serotonin reup take inhibitors (SSRIs) can have 
independent effects on ventilation, though SSRI s have not been shown to cause severe 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_674368].25-43 This supports the need for additional 
investigation on the effects of serotonergic drugs. Escitalopram is highly selective for the 
serotonin transporter, has low selectivity for serotonin receptors and muscarinic

data cannot necessarily be used to ex trapolate to the dynamic changes in PO 2 and PCO 2 
that occur during real-world drug-induced respi[INVESTIGATOR_674369] a patient is 
breathing room air. Duffin modified th e Read rebreathing method to include 1) 
hyperventilation (primarily thr ough deep breathing) prior to rebreathing to achieve an end 
tidal PCO 2 or approximately 20-25 mm Hg prior to  rebreathing, 2) maintaining an isoxic 
end tidal PO 2 during rebreathing, and 3) repeating re breathing at 2 different isoxic end 
tidal PO 2 levels (i.e., at 150 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg). These modifications, which have 
been used by [CONTACT_674423], allo w for critical physiol ogical measurements and 
thresholds to be captured that can then be us ed to model the effects of drugs when there 
are dynamic changes in PO 2 and PCO 2, such as during a real-world opi[INVESTIGATOR_46211].47-52

study. Subjects will be informed  that their participation in  the study is voluntary, that 
refusal to participate will invol ve no penalty or loss of benefi ts to which the subject is 
otherwise entitled, and th at the subject may discontinue participation at any time without 
penalty or loss of benefits to whic h the subject is otherwise entitled. 
Should a subject’s participati on be discontinued, the primary  reason for termination must 
be recorded. In addition, efforts should be ma de to perform all proc edures scheduled for 
the early termination visit. Any data and samp les collected before subject withdrawal will 
become the property of the sponsor.

compensated for completed days . If subjects are withdrawn fo r medical reasons or if the 
study is halted temporarily or permanen tly, the subjects will receive compensation 
proportional to the time spent in the study. No compensation will be provided if a subject 
is dismissed from the study for noncomplian ce (e.g., improper conduct, ingesting alcohol 
and/or drugs [including recr eational drugs], tampering wi th the study drug, consuming 
any prohibited foods  or beverages). 
If subjects are required to stay  in the clinic for a longer period for sa fety reasons, they 
will be compensated at a rate proportional to  the entire compensation for the study. If a 
subject becomes ill or physically injured becau se of participation in  this study, the subject 
will be referred for treatment.

aspects of blood collection and the reduc tion in blood volume subsequent to blood 
collection. A 5-minute window for PK sample collection is allowed after the ECG 
extraction window.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic Specimen Handling 
The PK blood samples (6 mL each) will be  collected into tubes containing K 2EDTA, 
inverted several times to mix the blood with the anticoagulant, and pl aced in an ice bath. 
Within 30 minutes of collection, the samples will be centrifuged for 10 minutes, at 3000 
RCF, at 4°C, by a study team member. 
The plasma will be separated using a disposable  plastic pi[INVESTIGATOR_674379]  A (primary) and Aliquot B (backup). The 
plasma samples will be appropr iately labeled and stored froze n at -70°C or below within 
30 minutes after aliquoting until shipment. Temperature monitoring logs should be 
maintained and accessible for re view by [CONTACT_11200].  
The Aliquot A samples (primary) will be ship ped first, on dry ice, to the bioanalytical 
laboratory at FDA for processing when request ed by [CONTACT_456]. The Aliquot B samples 
(backup) will be held for a second shipment  after completion of all Aliquot A sample 
shipment(s) and the timing of the Aliquot  B shipment will be communicated by [CONTACT_103]. None of the PK blood samples will be stored at the clinical  facility for future 
use. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
The following exploratory PK parameters  will be determined for oxycodone and 
oxymorphone (days 6, 12, and 21) and paroxe tine, escitalopram, and escitalopram

angle) on a bed and connected to the respi[INVESTIGATOR_674380]. Subjects will wear a 
facemask and breathe from a pr e-filled rebreathing bag cont aining approximately 5 L of 
either a hyperoxic-hypercapnic (24% O 2, 6% CO 2, N2 balanced) or hypoxic-hypercapnic 
(6% O 2, 6% CO 2, N2 balanced) gas mixture. During this study, subjects will be asked to 
breath room air for 5 minutes (relaxation stag e) and then to hyperventilate (primarily 
through deep breathing) room air voluntarily for 5 minutes  (hyperventilation stage). 
Thereafter, subjects will be switched to th e rebreathing bag and perform rebreathing 
assessments at one of the 2 different isoxic end tidal PO 2,  i.e., 150 mmHg or 50 mmHg. 
The isoxia at 150 mmHg or 50 mmHg end-tidal PO 2 will be maintained by [CONTACT_1541] a 
computer controlled flow of 100% O 2 to the rebreathing bag.   
Subjects will perform one hype roxic and one hypoxic rebreathi ng procedure at check-in 
of each study period and a total of 4 rebrea thing procedures (three hyperoxic and one 
hypoxic) each day on Days 5, 6, 11, 12, 20, a nd [ADDRESS_911336]-doses 
on assessment days (hyperoxic at 0, 4 and 5 hours; a hypoxic assessment will be 
performed after the 5 hour hyperoxic assessme nt). Participants can communicate to staff 
to discontinue an assessment due  to discomfort at any time. Additional considerations for 
discontinuing a rebreathing procedure are described in a separate SOP for the 
Rebreathing Procedure. 
Each rebreathing procedure (r elaxation, hyperventilation, and rebreathing) should take 
approximately 13-[ADDRESS_911337] completed. If reproducibi lity is acceptable and no procedural changes 
are needed, additional lead-in cohorts may not be enrolled. If any study procedure 
element changes are needed, they may be ma de and additional pa rticipants may be 
enrolled.  
The clock on the rebreathing recorder will be confirmed to be consistent with the study 
clock at the clinical site; this will be conf irmed on each study day. Preparatory steps for 
the Duffin’s rebreathing proce dure (i.e., relaxation, hypervent ilation) should begin prior

extractions/period time matched to the PK samp les will be obtained before the PK sample 
collection time. Subjects will be isolated (not able to see each other) in a quiet 
environment that is free from external stimuli. 
 
4.7.3 Safety Assessments 
Safety will be evaluated in terms of AEs, clinical laboratory re sults (hematology, serum 
chemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign m easurements (blood pressure, heart rate, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and oral body temperature) , safety 12-lead ECG results, and physical 
examination findings.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_911339] and/or unintended sign, in cluding an abnormal clinical 
laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study 
drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Events or conditions that 
increase in frequency or seve rity during or as a consequen ce of use of a drug in human 
clinical trials will also be considered AEs. 
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that  begins after study 
drug administration. 
An unexpected AE is any AE having a specific ity or severity not consistent with the 
current investigator’s broc hure for the study drug(s).

 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that meets the 
following criteria: 
x Results in death, 
x Is life threatening, 
x Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_25411], 
x Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, 
x Results in a congenital anomal y/birth defect due to expos ure prior to conception or 
during pregnancy, or 
x Is an important medical event that may not  meet the previous criteria but, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, jeopardizes the subject or requires medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously.

will continue until discharge (or early termination). All AEs, whether serious or 
nonserious and whether or not related to the study drug, must  be recorded in the eCRF. 
Study subjects will be instru cted to warn study staff if he or she has any unexpected 
symptoms. In addition, all subjects will rece ive a reminder telephone call approximately 
24 h before Check-in. 
Any SAE (whether expected or unexpected) mu st be entered into the eCRF system and 
reported by [CONTACT_674431] [ADDRESS_911341] be reported promptly to the 
investigator’s IRB as pe r the IRB’s requirements. 
In the event of a fatal or life-threatening SAE, the spons or will notify the appropriate

 Adverse events that are assessed by [CONTACT_674432]. All SA Es will be followed 
until resolution. 
[IP_ADDRESS].3  Assessment of Severity 
The investigator will assess the severity of each AE using the following scale: 
x Mild: The subject is aware of the AE but is still able to perform all activities; minimal 
or no medical intervention or therapy is required. 
x Moderate: The subject has to discontinue so me activities due to the AE; minimal or 
no medical intervention or  therapy is required. 
x Severe: The subject is incapacitated by [CONTACT_3433] e AE and is unable to perform normal 
activities; significant medical intervention or  therapy is require d, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_674383]. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Assessment of Causality 
The investigator will assess the causal relationship/relatedness of each AE to the study 
drug using the following scale: 
x Not Related: Onset of the AE has no reasonable temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug, a causal relationship to adminis tration of the study 
drug is biologically implausible, or the even t is attributed to an  alternative etiology. 
x Unlikely Related: Onset of the AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to study 
drug administration and although a causal relationship is un likely, it is biologically 
plausible. 
x Possibly Related: Onset of the AE ha s a strong temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug, cannot be e xplained by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state or 
other factors, and a causal relations hip is biologically plausible. 
x Probably Related: Onset of the AE show s a distinct temporal relationship to 
administration of the study drug that cannot  be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical 
state or other factors, the AE is a known r eaction to the product or chemical group, or 
can be predicted by [CONTACT_77425]’s pharmacology.

4.8 Study Treatments 
4.8.1 Dose Strategy  
Prior data with oxycodone alone using 20 mg  doses, showed signi ficant decreases in 
VE55 from baseline.5-6 Our previous study that administered 10 mg oxycodone showed 
approximately 5 L/min decrease with  oxycodone alone compared to baseline.[ADDRESS_911346]  on the hypercapnic vent ilatory response with 
oxycodone alone, but not too high (for safety cons iderations) as it will be combined with 
a SSRIs that may also have effects on ventilation.  
Paroxetine dosing in labeling starts at 20 mg/d ay and allows titration up to a maximum of 
60 mg/day for obsessive compul sive disorder (panic disord er starts at 10 mg/day and 
allows titration up to 60 mg/day). Dosing to 60 mg/day will allow as sessment of effects 
on ventilation alone or combined with oxyc odone under clinically relevant exposures 
Escitalopram dosing in labeling starts at 10 mg/day and allows titration up to 20 mg/day 
for treatment of major depressive disorder a nd treatment of generaliz ed anxiety disorder. 
The study will administer up to 30 mg/day, whic h is above the maximal labeled dose of 
escitalopram (20 mg/day), but  doses up to 30 mg/day have been evaluated in a thorough 
QT study. Escitalopram exposure with 30 mg /day is similar to  the steady state 
concentration expected in CYP2C19 poor me tabolizers following a th erapeutic dose of 
20 mg/day. 
4.8.[ADDRESS_911347] during the treatment pe riod. Oxycodone, paroxetine, escitalopram, 
ondansetron, and placebo will be administered or ally. Subjects will co mplete each of the 
three treatments (A, B, and C):  
x Treatment A: Placebo on Days 1-5; Pl acebo + Oxycodone (10 mg IR) on Day 6; 
Placebo on Days 7-11; Placebo + Oxycodone  (10 mg IR) on Day 12; Placebo on 
Days 13-20; Placebo + Oxycodone (10 mg IR) on Day 21 
x Treatment B: Paroxetine (40 mg) on Days 1-5; Paroxetine (40 mg) + Oxycodone (10 
mg IR) on Day 6; Paroxetine (60 mg) on Days 7-11; Paroxetine (60 mg) + 
Oxycodone (10 mg IR) on Day 12; Paroxetine  (60 mg) on Days 13-20; Paroxetine (60 
mg) + Oxycodone (10 mg IR) on Day 21

 x Treatment C: Escitalopram (20 mg) on Da ys 1-5; Escitalopram  (20 mg) + Oxycodone 
(10 mg IR) on Day 6; Escitalopram (30 mg ) on Days 7-11; Esc italopram (30 mg) + 
Oxycodone (10 mg IR) on Day 12; Esc italopram (30 mg) on Days 13-20; 
Escitalopram (30 mg) + Oxycodone (10 mg IR) on Day [ADDRESS_911348]’s bedside. The pharm acist and investigator will be  available if needed during 
study drug administration. Oral study drugs will be administered with 240 mL of 
room-temperature water. 
4.8.3 Dose Selection and Schedule 
Oxycodone: The oxycodone dose is 10 mg IR. Oxycodone dose selection is based on 
previous published results where oxycodone was administered alone or in combination 
using rebreathing procedures in healthy vol unteers. Two studies by [CONTACT_674434] 20 mg alone  or in combination with ethanol.5-6 Sedation 
levels in the ethanol study in particular, which included a higher dose of oxycodone and 
was performed in the young and elderly, were moderate and well addressed by [CONTACT_674435]. Varying dose comb inations of oxycodone and morphine (total 
combined doses of 15 mg) have been sa fely evaluated using a similar system.7 Our 
previous study with oxycodone 10 mg IR show ed that small (approximately 5 L/min) but 
detectable effects on hypercapnic ventilation coul d be safely observed with this dose with 
minimal effects on baseline ventilation.20   
Paroxetine: The paroxetine dose is [ADDRESS_911349] one week before the day 20 and 21 
assessments.  Target dosi ng range for paroxetine is 20-60 mg/day depending on the 
indication. Initial starting doses  in labeling for general anxi ety disorder, social anxiety 
disorder, posttraumatic stre ss disorder, obsessive compul sive disorder, and major 
depressive disorder are 20 mg/day with dose increases of 10-mg/day made in intervals of 
1 week. Paroxetine has been administered at 30 mg/day for 30-days in healthy volunteers 
and up to 60-mg as a single  dose in healthy volunteers.51  
Escitalopram: The escitalopram dose is 20 mg  for Days 1-6 and 30 mg for Days 7-21. 
Escitalopram dosing in labeling starts at 10 mg/day and allows titration up to 20 mg/day 
for treatment of major depressive disorder a nd treatment of generali zed anxiety disorder. 
The study will administer up to 30 mg/day, whic h is above the maximal labeled dose of

 escitalopram (20 mg/day), but  doses up to 30 mg/day have been evaluated in a thorough 
QT study for a comparable duration of time. Escitalopram exposure with 30 mg/day is 
similar to the steady state concentrati on expected in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers 
following a therapeutic dose of 20 mg/day.55 
Ondansetron: The ondansetron dose is 4 mg orally given 30 minutes before oxycodone 
administration. Up to two additional doses of IV ondansetron 4 mg can be given in a day 
for nausea/vomiting. The select ed ondansetron dose is less than the recommended dosing 
for labeled indications of nausea and vomiti ng associated with highly or moderately 
emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or postoperative nausea or vomiting.  
Naloxone: The naloxone dose is 0.4 mg admini stered intravenousl y, as needed, for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_674384] d eemed necessary by [CONTACT_20603]. Naloxone may be 
administered as a rescue medication fo r opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]-induced resp iratory depression.  
4.8.4 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Sequence 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Randomization Process 
The project biostatistician will create the specific ations that will be used to generate the 
randomization schedule. The specifications w ill be based on the protocol requirements 
and appropriate statistical programming with  consideration for study design, number of 
treatments, number of subject s planned for enrollment, st ratification, and blocking. 
Based on these specifications, the project bi ostatistician (or designe e) will generate a 
dummy randomization schedule. The schedule is generated in R.  
The project biostatistician (o r designee) distributes the ‘dummy’ randomization schedule 
to specified personnel for revi ew. Any change (e.g., change in block size, change in 
stratification levels) that requi res an update to the specificati ons will reset this process. 
Minor changes (e.g., display formatting) will not require a change to the specifications. 
After the approval of the ‘dummy’ randomization schedule, the project biostatistician (or 
designee) transfers the program used to  generate the ‘dummy’ schedule to the 
randomization biostatistician (unblinded), who is an independent party and will not be 
participating in any programmi ng or statistical decisions for the study before breaking the 
blind. No transfer is necessary if the unbli nded randomization biosta tistician also created 
the ‘dummy’ randomization. 
The randomization biostatistician is responsib le for generating the final randomization 
schedule. The output is sent only to designate d unblinded recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], who will maintain a 
secured digital and printed copy for their use.

Standardized meals will be served at cons istent times relative to  dosing, and no food or 
fluids will be served containing caffeine. Subjects will fast during days with rebreathing 
assessments (i.e., Day 5, 6, 11, 12, 20, and 21 of each period) until after the last 
rebreathing assessment. On ECG collection da ys (Day 2 and 16 of each period) subjects 
will have fasted for at least 8 hours prior to drug administration. Subjects should only eat 
meals and snacks that are provided during period s of their stay in the study clinic, and 
should consume each meal that is served at  a reasonable pace (within 25 minutes). 
Outside of meal times, the s ubjects will only be allowed to intake water, which will be 
available ad libitum. 
Due to current precautions being taken for COVID-19, the following re strictions will be 
in place: 
x Subjects should be encouraged to wear mask s except when in a private room without 
anyone else present or for a limited tim e for a study procedure (e.g., study drug 
administration or eating) when instructed by [CONTACT_3655].  
x Subjects must practice social distancing, which will include having a maximum of [ADDRESS_911360] of their time in their rooms except 
for specified times for walking in the halls (with masks recommended).

dosing with paroxetine. Similarly, there was a 9.3 L/min decrease in paroxetine compared 
to placebo after [ADDRESS_911363] devi ation in assessments 
was approximately 6.5 L/min. Assuming a simi lar effect size with paroxetine and 
escitalopram at day 20 and 21, the planned num ber of participants allows for a 40% drop

rebreathing assessment on any day or at any timepoint. Speci fic information on analysis 
populations for different pharmac odynamic measures will be de scribed in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP).   
A rebreathing assessment will be considered complete if the subject makes it through the 
entire procedure at a specific timepoint, if there are no identifiable issues with how the 
procedure was conducted, and if the VE55 regr ession converges.  Potential issues with 
how the procedure was conducted can included , but are not limited to, a leak from the 
system (e.g., substant ially decreasing O 2 during rebreathing or no evidence of an increase 
in CO 2 during rebreathing) or inaccurate read ings from the pneumotach (e.g., baseline 
minute ventilation readings less than 5 L/min).  
Subjects in this population will be used for the planned primary and secondary analyses 
related to evaluating drugs effe cts on the ventilatory response to hypercapnia.  If a subject 
does not contribute data from all treatments due  to early discontinuati ons or other reasons, 
only those comparisons where the subject ha s all required data will be performed. 
The PK population will include all subjects who receive study drug and have at least 
one estimable PK para meter after dosing.

4.9.6 Rebreathing Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Analysis  
The primary objective is to study ventil atory effects of SSR Is (paroxetine or 
escitalopram) combined with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] ( oxycodone) compared to an opi[INVESTIGATOR_674389]. The 
primary endpoint is VE55 unde r hyperoxic conditions on day 21.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Data Analysis  
Minute ventilation and end-tidal pCO 2 (PETCO 2) data from the rebreathing stage of the 
Duffin rebreathing procedure wi ll be analyzed at the speci fied primary timepoints using 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_674390]. The regressions will be used to predict VE55. VE55 when 
the SSRIs (paroxetine or escitalopram) are combined with oxycodone will be compared 
to VE55 with oxycodone alone.  
Multiple primary analyses are planned for each  drug. The first primar y analysis will be 
VE55 on day 21 at 5 h (hyperoxic) between oxycodone with paroxetine or escitalopram 
compared to oxycodone alone. The second primar y analysis will be VE55 on day 20 at 5 h 
(hyperoxic) between paroxetine or escitalopr am compared to placebo. Since Day [ADDRESS_911367] an adjustment for 
multiplicity using a Bonferroni correction (eac h day will be tested at a 0.025 significance 
level). No adjustments will be ma de for separate testing of pa roxetine or escitalopram since 
the treatments are considered separa te interventions in the study.  
A linear mixed effects model will be developed using al l study data from hyperoxic 
assessments. Fixed effects will include treatment, period, sequence, and baseline VE55 
(i.e., VE55 obtained at 0 h on Day -1 of each treatment period).  Subject will be included 
as a random effect on the intercept.  If a subj ect’s baseline VE55 for a treatment period is 
not available, then the baseline value for that period will be calculat ed based on the median 
of all other baseline values for that subjec t from other study periods.  If a subject does not

CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_911368] for normality. Homogeneity of varian ces will be verified using Levene’s test. If 
the data in its original or transformed form does not satisf y assumptions for normality and 
homogeneity, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be  used for all comparisons rather than a 
linear mixed effect model. In the event that  the data does not satisfy assumptions for 
normality and homogeneity then a Wilcoxon signed -rank test will be used for comparisons.  
To demonstrate an effect when an SSRI (par oxetine or escitalopram) is combined with 
oxycodone compared to oxycodone alone, the u pper bound of the one-sided 97.5% CI of 
the least-square mean VE55 difference between treatments must not overlap 0 L/min.  
Similarly, to demonstrate an effect of paroxe tine (or escitalopram) compared to placebo 
the upper bound of the one-sided 97.5% CI of  the least-square mean VE55 difference 
between treatments must not overlap 0 L/min . Each comparison will be performed 
separately (i.e., þtrt’ asþparoxetine’ or þescitalopram’):  
ЬH0: VE55oxy+trt - VE55oxy  0 L/min 
ЬHA: VE55oxy+trt - VE55oxy < 0 L/min 
For secondary endpoints, effect s of SSRIs (paroxetine or escitalopram) with oxycodone 
compared to oxycodone alone will be performed on day 6 and day 12. 
As additional secondary endpoints, effects of  SSRIs (paroxetine or escitalopram) alone 
compared to placebo will be determined on da y 5 and 11 using the same model. Additional 
details on testing of ventilation secondar y endpoints is discussed in the SAP. 
4.9.7 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The PK parameters C max, AUC 0-t, Tmax, and K el will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics (number of subjects, geometric m ean, coefficient of vari ation [CV], mean, SD, 
median, minimum, and maximum) on Day 2, 5, 6, 11, 12, 16, 20 and 21 of each period 
for paroxetine, escitalopram, and escita lopram metabolites (Days 6, 12, and 21 for 
oxycodone and oxymorphone). The PK para meters will be analyzed using 
noncompartmental methods based on actua l sampling times. Geometric mean and 
individual concentration-time profiles will be presented in graphs. 
4.9.8 PK/PD Modeling 
A nonlinear-mixed effect pha rmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model will be developed 
for VE55 and baseline-adjusted VE55 versus time for all treatments. The model will be 
developed using modeling software.

 Additional details on PK/PD modeling will be discussed in a separate Modeling Analysis 
Plan. 
4.9.9 Electrocardiogram Analyses 
The QT interval will be co rrected for heart rate using Fridericia’s formula 
(QTc=QT/RR1/3). The J-T peak interval will be corrected for heart rate using the formula 
(J-T peakC = J-T peakC/RR0.58).60 Baseline will be the mean of the 3 predose ECG extractions 
of Day 1. 
Exposure-response analyses will be performed  for the change-from-baseline in QTc

Analysis Plan), where the mean of the [ADDRESS_911369] practices in concentration-QTc 
modeling.61-62  
To assess the appropriateness of a linear mo del, normal QQ-plots for the residuals and 
plots of weighted residuals versus concen tration and versus fitted values will be 
produced. A model with a quadratic  term in concentration will be fitted and the quadratic 
term will be tested on the 2-sided 5% alpha le vel. In case of a significant quadratic term, 
nonlinear models, such as a log-linear model and an E max model, will be investigated and 
the primary model will be selected based on the Akaike Information Criterion and 
plausibility arguments.  
Unless the prespecified test procedure for linearity indicates ot herwise, the primary 
analysis will be based on a linear mixed eff ects model implemented in R software, with

continuous covariates, treatment and time poi nt as categorical factors, and subject 
specific random effects for the intercept and slope. All post dose data will be used. The 
degrees of freedom for the model estimates will be determined by [CONTACT_315456]-Rogers 
method. From the model, the slope (i.e., the regression parameter for the concentration) 
and the treatment effect will be estima ted together with 2-sided 90% CIs.

Aptinyx Confidential  6 Methodology:  
Study Design  
The study will be a 6 - to 9-week study, including a 1-to 4-week Screening Period, followed by a 
4-week double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled Treatment Period , and a 1 -week Follow Up 
Period.  
 
Screening Period  (Week -4 to -1) 
The subject s will be asked to provide informed consent for this study before any required procedures 
are performed. Subjects will also be required  to sign an additional consent for their inclusion in a 
subject registry data base. The database will use partially -identified subject information to review 
subjects’ research study history within a proprietary, secure platform . Subjects who meet any of the 
following criteria will not be eligible for continued screening: current enr ollment in another study, 
concurrent screening at another research site, violation  of the required number of half -lives since the 
last research study, violation of the washout period between studies, or incorrect age for the NYX -
[ADDRESS_673291] 1 month (or 
have stable glycemic control with diet and exercise alone) and who have been suffering from painful 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least [ADDRESS_673292] a score of ≥4 and ≤9 on the 11 -
point Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) for average pain over the past 24 hours at Visit 1 . Subjects will be 
assessed for widespread pain symptoms using the American College of Rheumatology  Fibromyalgia 
Criteria. Additional procedures during Visit 1 will in clude the administration of the Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56106] ( HADS ), completion of the Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale (S-STS), adverse 
event collection which will begin at the time of informed consent, demographic characteristics, medical 
history including concomitant medications, complete physical examination (with c omprehensive 
neurological examination), 5 -minute electrocardiogram, vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse), 
height, body weight, and collection of blood and urine samples for chemistry,  Human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, triglycerides, hematology  (including HbA1c) , and urinalysis. 
All subjects will undergo urine drug and alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and breathalyzer, 
respectively. Subjects who test positive for marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_519039], or alcohol will not be allowed to continue in the study. Female subjects of 
childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local urine testing kit  and will be counseled 
to begin or continue using highly effective contraceptio n.  
 
Eligible subjects who meet all entry criteria will enter a 1 - to 4-week Screening Period, during which 
they will discontinue all except 1 (if applicable) of their pharmacologic analgesic treatments for 
neuropathic pain associated with diabetic periphe ral neuropathy, and complete daily pain diaries. The 
duration of the Screening Period will depend upon the analgesic treatment that is being discontinued. 
The only allowed analgesic s for painful diabetic peripheral neu ropathy may not be  an N-methyl -D-
aspar tate receptor  ligand, must be non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_9787] -sedative , and must not interfere with subjects’ 
pain reporting. The allowed analgesic  must have been taken for at least 1  month (30 days) prior to Visit 
1, and subjects must be on a stable fixed dose that is  not expected to change during the study.  Subjects 
already taking no more than [ADDRESS_673293] their pain on the device. Subjects will also be educated at Visits 1 through 3 on appropriate 
expectations around their participation in a clinical study and the importance of consistently  and 
accurately reporting their pain throughout the study.  Review of these  educational materials may be 
repeated for some or all subjects depending  on findings of an ongoing blinded data review (e.g., if pain 
score variability is increased on a subject or site level).  
 
Subjects will be dispensed acetaminophen to be used as rescue medication, and will be instructed to 
take no more than 2 g/daily (one to two 500 -mg caplets every 4 to 6 hours as needed) for DPN pain.  
 
Beginning immediately after Visit 1, pain intensity and rescue medication use will be recorded in the 
study -issued handheld device daily at bedtime. Subjects will enter their average pain i ntensity, worst 
pain intensity, pain on walking, and whether  rescue medication was used during the past 24 hours. Pain 
intensity will be recorded using an 11 -point (NRS ), with [ADDRESS_673294] pain 
imaginable. Every morning upon awake ning, subjects will complete the Daily Sleep Interference Scale 
(DSIS ) via their study -issued handheld device.  
 
Screening Period (Week -1) 
The investigative site staff will contact  [CONTACT_519057] -1 to 
reinforce the reporting instructions  (i.e., diary completion) and to assess adverse events. Subjects will 
be asked a non -leading question to inquire about potential adverse events, “Have you experienced any 
new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since last week?”  Subjects taking no more than 1 
allowed concomitant analgesic medication s at Visit 1 may directly begin Week -1 of the Screening 
Period.  
 
Baseline Visit (Week 0)  
At Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), study personnel will verify eligibility with the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria when the subjects are on site, and prior to randomization. P ain scores reported by [CONTACT_519058] “Eligible” or “No t eligible .” No other information will be provided.  
 
Subjects whose mean of the daily average pain intensity score during the preceding 7 (±1) days is 
within the protocol -defined algorithm and with adequate  compliance with daily diary completion will 
be el igible for randomization. The absolute pain score and variability among scores, as well as the 
actual percentage required for diary compliance will be masked to investigators and subjects. Subject 
eligibility for randomization into the study based on these  variables will be communicated to the 
investigator via the interactive response technology system.  
 
Subjects will again be asked a non -leading question to assess potential a dverse events .  Use of 
concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs (bl ood pressure and pulse) will be measured 
after sitting for [ADDRESS_673295] and instructed to take 2 capsules 
by [CONTACT_519059]. Subjects will also be re -dispensed acetaminophen to use as rescue medication  for 
DPN pain ; instructions not to exceed 2 g/day will be reinforced. The appropriate use of rescue 
medication will be assessed by [CONTACT_519060], as wel l as by [CONTACT_248457].  
 
Subjects will be instructed to continue entering their average pain intensity, worst pain intensity, pain 
upon walking, and  whether they used  rescue medication over the past 24 hours into their study -issued 
handheld devices ever y night. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will complete the DSIS via 
their study -issued handheld device. Pain diary compliance will be reviewed at each study visit by [CONTACT_28023], and reporting instructions will be reinforced.  
 
Quantitative senso ry testing will be done using the Bedside Sensory Testing Kit. The following scales 
will be completed at the Baseline Visit: Brief Pain Inventory for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy 
(BPI -DPN), the Short -Form McGill Pain Questionnaire version 2  (SF-MPQ -2), the Norfolk Quality of 
Life Questionnaire - Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL -DN), the HADS, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the 
S-STS.   
 
One week following the Week [ADDRESS_673296] 
a non -leading question.  
 
Treatment Period: Week [ADDRESS_673297] a non -leading question. Use of concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs 
(sitting blood pressure and pulse) will be measured. Blood samples will be collected for liver function 
testing. Female subjects of childbearing  potential will be counseled to continue using highly effective 
contraception. Subjects will be instructed to continue entering their average pain intensity, worst pain 
intensity, pain upon walking, and rescue medication use over the past 24  hours into the ir study -issued 
handheld devices every night. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will complete the DSIS via 
their study -issued handheld device.  
 
Scales to be completed at the Week 2 visit include the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C), 
the S -STS,  and the Insomnia Severity Index.   
 
One week following the Week 2 visit, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_519061].

Treatment Period: Week 4/Early  Termination  
During the Week 4 or Ear ly Termination Visit, subjects will be evaluated for compliance with study 
medication, and return all materials and unused study medication/rescue medication to the study site. 
The study -issued handheld device will be returned. Pain diary compliance will b e reviewed by [CONTACT_28023]. Adverse events will be assessed  by [CONTACT_63397] a non -leading question. Use of 
concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse) and body 
weight will be measured, brief physical examination performed, and subjects will undergo a 5 -minute 
electrocardiogram. Blood and urine samples will be collected for chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis 
testing. Female subjects of childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local  urine 
testing kit. Subjects will undergo drug and alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and 
breathalyzer, respectively.  
 
Scales to be completed at the Week 4/Early Termination V isit include BPI -DPN, PGI -C, SF -MPQ -2, 
HADS, QOL -DN, Insomnia Severity Index, and S -STS.  
 
[ADDRESS_673298] -Treatment  Follow Up  Visit (Week 5)  
Subjects will return to the study site 7 days following the Week 4/Early Termination visit to assess 
adverse events and concomitant medication use. The adverse event assessment will  include any serious 
adverse events that were ongoing at the time of study completion, and whether any ongoing adverse 
events had progressed to becoming serious.  Blood samples will be collected for liver function testing.  
 
Number of subjects (planned and  analyzed):  
Approximately 300 subjects enrolled by a randomized method with a pre -specified number of  subjects 
per treatment arm.

Aptinyx Confidential  14 Sample Size:  
The planned sample size is a total of 300 randomized subjects.  This sample size will provide 
approximately 80 % power for a [ADDRESS_673307] with Type I error of 0.048.  
Statistical methods:  
Safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population, which is defined as all subjects who receive at 
least [ADDRESS_673308] baseline 
assessment of the pain intensity NRS.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the daily pain intensity NRS score from the handheld device will be 
averaged for baseline (Days -7 to -1) and Week 4 (Days 22 to 28) after randomization. Change from 
baseline to Week [ADDRESS_673309] 24 hours from baseline 
(average of Days -7 to -1) to each week of treatment will be assessed for treatment group differences 
with an analysis of co variance with fixed factors for study site and treatment, with baseline value as a 
covariate. Change from baseline for the PGI -C, SF -MPQ -2, QOL -DN, Insomnia Severity Index, 
HADS, DSIS, BPI -DPN will be analyzed similarly.  
The use of rescue medication and pe rcent of subjects meeting responder criteria will be summarized 
descriptively.  
The number of days to the first ≥30% reduction and first ≥50% reduction in the NRS average pain 
intensity will be assessed for treatment group differences with the log -rank test .  
Adverse events will be categorized by [CONTACT_519066].  Summary tables for treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAEs)  
will include number and percent of subjects experiencing TEAEs by [CONTACT_72065].  
Mean change in clinical laboratory and vital signs from baseline (Visit 2) to Week 4 (Visit 4) will be 
summarized descriptively. Clinical laboratory r esults considered clinically important by [CONTACT_519067]. Subjects with suicidal ideation or behavior will be identified with the

Aptinyx Confidential  21 4 INTRODUCTION 
NYX-2925 is a novel small molecule being developed for the treatment of neuropathic pain and 
fibromyalgia. NYX-2925 is an N- methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) functional glycine-site 
partial agonist, and at low concentrations of endogenous agonist (glycine or D-serine), 
NYX-[ADDRESS_673316] from that of all of existing 
and emerging drugs that are indicated for the treatment of neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia. 
While current medications target individual elements of pain signal transmission or modulation, 
NYX-2925 modulates multiple synaptic relays within pain circuits. 
Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system and acts 
through activation of glutamate recep
tors. A portion of the receptors bind preferentially to 
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and are therefore, termed NMDARs . Unlike other glutamate 
receptor
s found in the brain, such as α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropi[INVESTIGATOR_519042], the NMDARs ar
e unique in that they have distinct binding sites for both 
glutamate and glycine, and binding by [CONTACT_519068]. The 
NMDARs are implicated in a number of physiologica
l and pathological processes, including 
anxiety, cognition, learning, stroke, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and neuropathic pain 
(Traynelis 2010, Mony 2009, Tai 2001).  
The central ner
vous system modulates the experience of pain in people with neuropathic pain, 
with the rostroventralmedial medulla ( Silva 2016 ), the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex 
(Russo 2015), the insula and other brain regions ( Ossipov  2010) all thought to be involved. 
Neuropathic pain is caused by [CONTACT_519069] ( Jensen 2014). While 
neuropathic pain can initially arise within the central or the peripheral nervous system through a 
wide r
ange of etiologies, central nervous system modulation 
of the experience of pain is 
common, regardless of the specific precipit
ating factors or initial location of the pain. The 
prevalence of neuropathic pain is approximately 8% in the population in the [LOCATION_002] 
(Gilron 2015, Toth 2013, Bouhassira 2008 ). 
Individuals suffering from  neuropathic pain, 
irrespective of the underlying disorder, currently have limited treatment options available. 
Current treatment options predominantly include antidepressants and antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23698]. These 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_519043], although for a large 
proportion of patients, treatment is insuffic
ient. 
Preclinical pharmacology studies support the study of NYX-2925 in both fibromyalgia and 
neuropathic pain, both of which are chronic pain syndromes involving central nervous system 
modulation of pain signals. NYX-2925 is effective in several models of neuropathic pain, and 
has been shown to be effective in the chronic unpredictable stress model of fibromyalgia. Animal 
models of neuropathic pain in which NYX-2925 was tested include the rat Bennett model of 
neuropathic pain, the rat 
streptozotocin model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and the rat 
Taxol® model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Unlike gabapentin (150 mg/kg orally), 
NYX-2925 (1 to 30 mg/kg orally) produced a rapid and long-lasting analgesia in the rat Bennett 
model of neuropathic pain without changes in locomotor activity after a single dose. Further, in 
Clinical Protocol Masked NYX -2925-2001  Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018 
Aptinyx Confidential  22 the chronic unpredictable stress model of fibromyalgia, NYX-2925 (10 mg/kg) has been shown 
to produce mechanical analgesia. In summary, these data support testing NYX-[ADDRESS_673317] that NYX-2925 is 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_519044], and time to peak plasma concentration is reached within 
1 hour. NYX-2925 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_519045]
f-life in the range of 1 to 2 hours. Brain exposure is approximately 5% to 10% relative to 
plasma levels of NYX-2925. 
Both si
ngle-dose and daily repeat-dose toxicology studies have been performed in rats and dogs. 
The maximum tolerated dose following a single oral exposure is at least 1000 mg/kg in both rats 
and dogs. After [ADDRESS_673318] doses tested (180 mg/kg in dogs and 480 mg/kg in rats). There were no adverse findings 
in either species. The plasma levels (exposure) of NYX-[ADDRESS_673319]- in-human study (NYX-2925-1001), for 
which r
esults are available, was a combined single and multiple ascending dose, placebo-
cont
rolled study in healthy volunteers that also includes food-effect, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF), 
and el
derly cohorts.  
In the single dose portion of the study, single doses of NYX-2925 were administered orally. Five 
ascending dose groups (50 mg, 150 mg, 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg) and an elderly cohort 
(300 mg) with 8 subjects each (6 on active drug, 2 on placebo in each group) were dosed. Seven 
days a
fter the initial dose, the 400 mg dose group received a second repeated dose (6 active drug, 
1 placebo) to examine the effect of food on plasma drug concentrations. A CSF cohort (50 mg) 
was also completed with [ADDRESS_673320] discontinued due to physician decision (related to subject 
noncompliance). One subject in the elderly cohort receiving 300 mg experienced a treatment-
emergent adverse event (TEAE) which was not considered related to NYX-2925. Five subjects 
in t
he CSF cohort receiving [ADDRESS_673321] one TEAE, one of which (procedural 
headache) was deemed related to NYX-2925. One subject receiving placebo experienced a 
TEA
E. There were no TEAEs reported for clinical laboratories, safety electrocardiograms, or 
vit
al signs.     
In t
he multiple ascending dose phase, there were three ascending dose groups (150, 600 and 900 
mg) with 8 subjects in each dose group; 6 received active drug and 2 received placebo for up to 7 
days
. There were also 6 subjects in the CSF cohort who were dosed with NYX-2925 300 mg (no 
pla
cebo control) and 5 completed the study. A total of 15 males and 15 females were enrolled. 
Study medication was given once daily for up to 7 days. Two subjects in the CSF cohort 
discontinued study participation, 1 due to other  (related to subject noncompliance) and 1 due to 
protocol violation. All subjects in 150 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg dose groups received all 7 doses 
of study medication. Twelve subjects (1 NYX-2925 150 mg, 3 NYX-2925 600 mg, 1 NYX-2925 
900 mg, 2 placebo, and 5 NYX-2925 300 mg CSF cohort) reported at least [ADDRESS_673322] 1 study drug 
Clinical Protocol Masked NYX -2925-2001  Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018 
Aptinyx Confidential  23 related TEAE (flatulence and bloating) in the [ADDRESS_673323] 
1 study drug related TEAE (fatigue and lethargy), and [ADDRESS_673324] 1 study 
drug r
elated TEAE (headache). No grade [ADDRESS_673325] in the 150 mg, 600 mg, or 900 mg dose groups. In the CSF cohort, 3 
subjects reported procedural headache, 5 subjects reported procedural pain, and 2 subjects 
re
ported vomiting. There were no TEAEs reported for clinical laboratories, safety 
electrocardiograms, or vital signs. 
Concerning cardiovascular safety, a thorough analysis of ECGs demonstrated that NYX-2925 
did not increase QTc at any dose up to 1200 mg.  The maximum geometric mean peak plasma 
concentration (C max) (20.1 μg/ml) was well above the expected exposure in clinical care.  There 
were no clinically significant changes in HR, PR and QRS or in ECG diagnostic statements. 
The pharmacokinetics of NYX-2925 in humans are similar to the pharmacokinetics in rats and 
dogs.
 Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that absorption of NYX-2925 was relatively rapid and 
peak conc
entrations were achieved within 2 hours after dosing and declined in a roughly 
monophasic manner over 24 hours. The pharmacokinetics were dose proportional over the dose 
range tested (within the variability) and showed minimal accumulation following once per day 
dosing for 7 days. A high-fat, high-caloric meal decreased the rate of absorption (delayed T max), 
lowered C max by 10%, but had no impact on the extent of exposure (area under the plasma 
conce
ntration versus time curve [AUC] values were comparable), suggesting that the compound 
m
ay be administered with or without food. The majority, approximately 60% to 70%, of the 
administered dose was eliminated as unchanged NYX-[ADDRESS_673326]- in-human study indicate that NYX-2925 is  safe and well-tolerated in the 
m
ale and female healthy volunteers dosed to date at single doses up to 1200 mg, and multiple 
doses up to 900 mg given daily for 7 days. The preclinical and phase 1 clinical data support 
further
 testing in humans. 
In addition to the current trial, there are 2 other ongoing clinical studies with NYX-2925. NYX-
2925-1003 is a phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], crossover study to assess the 
eff
ects of NYX-2925 on sleep architecture as assessed by [CONTACT_519070] 40-55 when their bedtime is advanced by 3 hours in a sleep laboratory. Also 
ongoing is study NYX-2925-2002, in subjects with fibromyalgia. The primary objective of this 
study is to determine whether NYX-2925 modulates central nervous system activity in key pain 
neural circuitry, consistent with the potential to provide analgesia in subjects with fibromyalgia, 
as assessed by [CONTACT_62211]. Secondarily, this study will provide a preliminary 
characterization of the safety of NYX-2925 in subjects with fibromyalgia. 
Further, there is planned study ; a phase 1, double-blind, randomized, sponsor-open, parallel, 
placebo-controlled exploratory study to assess the effect of multiple dose levels of NYX-2925 on

re
ported in the clinical development program for NYX -2925, that being in the current study, 
NYX-2925-2001. The event is considered not related to NYX-2925. 
 
This study (NYX-2925-2001) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple -dose 
study to assess the efficacy and safety of NYX-2925 in subjects with neuropathic pain associated 
with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. NYX-2925 will be provided as capsules for oral 
administration.

Aptinyx Confidential  27 6 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
6.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description 
The study will be a 6- to 9-week study, including a 1- to 4-week Screening Period, followed by a 
4-week double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Treatment Period, and a 1-week 
Foll
ow-
Up Period ( Figure 1).  The schedule of assessments is provided in Table  3. The study will 
include approximately 35 study sites in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Screening Period (Week  -4 to -1 ) 
Upon Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the protocol, subjects will be asked to 
provide informed consent for this study before any required procedures are performed. Subjects 
will also be required to sign an additional consent for their inclusion in a subject registry 
database. The database will use partially-identified subject information to review subjects’ 
research study history within a proprietary, secure platform. Subjects who meet any of the 
following criteria will not be eligible for continued screening: current enrollment in another 
study, concurr
ent screening at another research site, violation of the required number of 
half-
lives since the last research study, violation of the washout period between studies, or 
incorrect
 age for the NYX-2925-[ADDRESS_673327] 
1 month (or have stable glycemic control with diet and exercise alone) and who have been 
suffering from painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy in the lower extremities for at least [ADDRESS_673328] a score of ≥4 and ≤[ADDRESS_673329] 24 hours at 
Visit 1. S
ubjects will be assessed for widespread pain symptoms using the American College of 
Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Criteria. Additional procedures during Visit 1 will include the 
administration of the HADS , completion of the S- STS, adver se event collection which will begin 
at the time of informed consent, demographic characteristics, medical history including 
concomitant
 medications, complete physical examination (with comprehensive neurological 
examinati
on), 5-minute electrocardiogram, vital signs (sitting blood pressure and pulse after 5 
minut
es), height, body weight, and collection of blood and urine samples for chemistry, HIV, 
hepat
itis, an
d triglycerides, hematology (including HbA1c), and urinalysis. All subjects will 
undergo urine drug and 
alcohol screen using a local urine testing kit and breathalyzer, 
respectively . Subjects who test positive for marijuana, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_519046], 
or alcohol will not be allowed to continue in the study. Female 
subjects of
 childbearing potential will be tested for pregnancy using a local urine testing kit and 
will be counseled to begin or continu
e using highly effective contraception.  
Eligible
 subjects who meet all entry criteria will enter a 1- to 4-week Screening Period, during 
which t
hey 
will discontinue all except 1(if applicable) of their pharmacologic analgesic 
treatments for neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and complete 
daily pain diaries. The duration of the Screening Period will depend upon the analgesic treatment 
Clinical Protocol Masked NYX -2925-[ADDRESS_673330] not interfere with subjects’ pain reporting ( Sect ion 8.7 ). The allowed analgesics must have 
been taken 
for at least 1 month (30 days) prior to Visit 1, and subjects must be on a stable fixed 
dose 
that is not expected to change during the study.  
The discontinuation of all (but 1 allowed, as applicable) analgesic medications will be managed 
by [CONTACT_519072]. Subjects already taking no more than 
[ADDRESS_673331] their pain on the device  
 Subjects
 will also be educated at Visits 1 through 3 on appropriate 
expectations around their participation in a clinical study  
, and the
 importance of consistently and accurately reporting 
their pain throughout the study. Review of these educational materials may be repeated for some 
or a
ll subjects depending on findings of an ongoing blinded data review (e.g., if pain score 
variability is increased on a subject or site level). 
Subjects will be dispensed acetaminophen to be used as rescue medication, and will be instructed 
to take no more than 2 g/daily (one to two 500-mg caplets every 4 to 6 hours as needed) for DPN 
pain. 
Beginni
ng immediately after Visit 1, pain intensity and rescue medication use will be recorded in 
the study-
issued handheld device daily at bedtime. Subjects will enter their average pain 
intensity, worst
 pain intensity, pain on walking, and whether rescue medication was used during 
the past [ADDRESS_673332] pain imaginable. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will complete 
the
 DS
IS via their study-issued handheld device.  
 
Screening Period (Week - 1) 
The investigative site staff will contact [CONTACT_519057] -1 to 
reinforce the reporting instructions (i.e., diary completion) and to assess adverse events. Subjects 
will be asked a non-leading question to inquire about potential adverse events, “Have you 
experienced any new or changed symptoms since we last asked/since last week?” Subjects taking 
no more than 1 allowed concomitant analgesic medication at Visit 1 may directly begin Week -1 
of the
 Screening Period.

Aptinyx Confidential  29 Baseline (Week 0, Visit 2) 
At Visit 2 (Baseline Visit), study personnel will verify eligibility with the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria when the subjects are on site, and prior to randomization. Pain scores reported 
by [CONTACT_519073]. The interactive response technology system will notify 
the site i
f the subject is “Eligible” or “Not eligible”. No other information will be provided. 
Subjec
ts whose mean of the daily average pain intensity score during the preceding 7 (±1) days 
is within the protocol-defined algorithm ( Section 12.2) and with adequate compliance with daily 
diary completion will be eligible for randomization. The absolute pain score and variability 
among scores, as well as the actual percentage required for diary compliance, will be masked to 
inve
stigators and subjects. The appropriate use of rescue medication will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_519074], as well as by [CONTACT_248457]. Subject eligibility for 
random
ization into the study based on these variables will be communicated to the investigator 
via the interactive response technology system. 
Subjects will again be asked a non-leading question to assess potential adverse events, for 
example, “Have you experienced any new or changes symptoms since we last asked/since your 
last visit?” Use of concomitant medications will be documented. Vital signs (blood pressure and 
pulse
) will be measured after sitting for [ADDRESS_673333] and instructed to take 
2 capsules by [CONTACT_16629]. Subjects will also be re-dispensed acetaminophen to use as 
re
scue medication for DPN pain; instructions not to exceed 2 g/day will be reinforced.  
Subjec
ts will be instructed to continue entering their average pain intensity, worst pain intensity, 
pain upon walking, and whether they used rescue medication over the past 24 hours into their 
study-issued handheld devices every night. Every morning upon awakening, subjects will 
complete the DSIS via their study-issued handheld device. Pain diary compliance will be 
revie
wed at each study visit by [CONTACT_5984], and reporting instructions will be reinforced. 
Quantitative sensory testing will be done using the Bedside Sensory Testing Kit. The following 
scales will be completed at the Baseline Visit: BPI-DPN, the SF-MPQ-2, the QOL-DN, the 
HADS, the Insomnia Severity Index, and the S-STS.

 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-[ADDRESS_673339] variability in treatment response ( Katz 2005, 
Katz
 2015 ) . The 1-month duration of treatment is considered sufficient to identify clinically 
im
portant pain relief. 
Only masked versions of the informed consent and protocol will be provided to study sites. The 
masked ver
sions will obscure the number of dose groups (i.e., the probability of receiving 
placebo) and the ra
ndomization criteria ( Section 7.1) . Mas king is expected to reduce variability 
in treatment response and to reduce the response to placebo. 
6.3 Justification of Dose 
Multiple dose levels of NYX-2925 are planned. No dose is more than 1/6th of  the maximum 
single dose (1200 mg) given in phase 1, which was safe and well-tolerated. Further, no dose is 
more than 2/9th of the maximum multiple dose (900 mg) given once daily for 7 days in phase 1, 
which was sa
fe and well-tolerated. Both the 1200 mg single dose and the 900 mg multiple dos e 
were associated with pharmacokinetic exposures (maximum concentration and area under the 
concentratio
n curve) below the no-observed-adverse-effect levels for both the dog and rat in the 
Good Laboratory Practice toxicology studies. NYX-2925 has a terminal elimination half-life of 4 
to 5 hours and demonstrated no accumulation with once daily dosing over 7 days in phase 1. This 
is c
onsistent 
with pharmacokinetic data in rats and dogs, following much higher doses over six 
weeks. Approximately 65% of the NYX-2925 dose is eliminated as unchanged drug in the urine. 
Thus, no drug accumulation is expected in this study. Both male and female subjects were 
included in the phase 1 studies and provide adequate support for studying both female and male 
subjects wi
th neuropathic pain, when using appropriate contraception precautions. Thus, the 
selected dose strengths chosen for this study are well supported by [CONTACT_519076]. The 28-day duration of exposure to NYX-2925 in this 
study is support
ed by [CONTACT_519077], comprising 42 and 55 daily 
doses, respectively. 
The dose strengths of NYX-2925 planned for this study are expected to produce maximum 
plasma concent
rations ranging from approximately 170 to 3400 ng/mL. These levels 
approximate the plasma maximum concentration associated with efficacy in the rat Bennett, 
Taxol®, and streptozotocin models. In those pharmacology models, analgesia was observed at 
doses between 1 and 30 mg/kg, corresponding to maximum plasma concentrations levels of 210 
to 4500 ng/mL, respectively. Brain exposure in humans, as measured in CSF, is anticipated to 
approximate the CSF levels measured in rats at analgesic doses. Additionally, the anticipated 
CSF levels in humans should be 3- to 6-orders of magnitude greater than the NYX-[ADDRESS_673340]-dose. In a rat Bennett model 
exper
iment that included gabapentin as a positive control, gabapentin was active only at the 
1-hour time point. In the rat Taxol® model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, NYX-2925 was 
active at both 24 hours and 1 week after administration of a single dose, whereas the positive 
cont
rol, bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], was active only at the 1-hour testing interval. Gabapentin (150 mg/kg 
ora
lly) was inactive in this model. Finally, in the rat model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic 
neuropathy, NYX-[ADDRESS_673341] Inclusion Criteria

9.1 Screening Assessments 
9.1.1 Masqueradi ng Disorders Tool 
The Masquerading Disorders Tool (Analgesic Solutions, Wayland, MA) is a screening 
instrument to help identify subjects with disorders that masquerade as painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy, such as Morton’s neuroma, peripheral vascular disease, Achilles tendonitis, arthritis, 
and tarsal tunnel syndrome. The screening instrument consists of symptom screening questions, 
and an in-clinic history and examination to target the nature and etiology of the subject’s 
peripheral pain. The results of this assessment tool are provisional, with the final decision based 
on the clinical judgment of the investigator. 
9.1.2 Mi chigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument 
The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument is a 15-item, self-administered questionnaire 
and a lower 
extremity examination that includes inspection of vibratory sensation and ankle 
reflexes. It can be used to assess distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy in diabetes 
(Herman 2012 ). 
9.1.[ADDRESS_673363] ing Kit 
The Bedside Sensory Testing K it (Analgesic Solutions, Wayland, MA) is used to assess a 
subject’s sensory profile to allow phenotypic identification of subgroups of subjects with painful 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy who might respond differently to a given treatment. The kit 
consists of multiple sensory instruments that are applied to different peripheral anatomic sites to 
evaluate
 the following phenomena: extent of damage of low threshold mechanoreceptive small 
fibers in the
 feet, dynamic mechanical allodynia, punctate hyperalgesia, high threshold 
m
echanoreceptive function, and cold allodynia. 
9.1.4 Ameri can College of Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Criteria 
The 2010 American College of Rheumatology Fibromyalgia Criteria is a clinician-administered 
survey that is used as a d
iagnostic tool for fibromyalgia. The diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia 
are met by [CONTACT_716] 3 conditions:  
 Widespread Pain Index ≥7 and Symptom Severity Score ≥5, or the Widespr ead Pain 
Index is 3 to 6 and the Symptom Severity Score is ≥9;  
 S ymptoms have been present at a similar level for at least 3 months; and 
 Subject does not have a disorder that would otherwise explain the pain ( W olfe 2010).  
9.2 Efficacy
 Assessments 
9.2.1 Nu meric Rating Scale of Pain Intensity (NRS) 
The NRS of pain intensity is a unidimensional, segmented numeric version of the visual analog 
scale
. A subject selects a whole number (0 to 10) that best indicates the intensity of his/her pain. 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-[ADDRESS_673364] 24 hours, using the 11-point NRS. 
9.2.2 Pati ent Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) 
The PGI-C is a 7-point scale that allows subjects to rate the change in the disease state from 
study
 initiation to specific tim
e points during the study or at the end of the study. It provides the 
subject’s impression of overall change since beginning the study. 
9.2.3 Short -Form McGill Pain Que stionnaire, version 2 (SF-MPQ-2) 
The SF-MPQ-2 measures the sensory, affective, and evaluative qualities of pain, including 
sym
ptoms relevant to neuropathic pain. The tool includes visual analogue as well as verbal rating 
scales of pain intensity on a total of 22 neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain descriptors that are 
each evaluated on a 
10-point numerical rating scale ( Dworkin 2009).  
9.2.4 Norfol k Quality of Life Questionnaire – Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL -DN) 
The Norfolk QOL -DN is a [ADDRESS_673365] -reported questionnaire designed to measure the 
relationship between symptomatic diabetic neuropathy and quality of life from the perspective of 
the patient. It is composed of 2 parts: questions related to symptoms e xperienced by [CONTACT_519082]'s neuropathy on activities of daily life. A factor 
analysis performed on the Norfolk QOL -DN separated the questions into 5 domains: activities of 
daily living, symptoms, small fib er neuropathy, large fiber neuropathy, and autonomic 
neuropathy.  The QOL -DN is sensitive to the different features of diabetic neuropathy including 
small fiber, large fiber, and autonomic nerve function ( Vinik  2005).  
9.2.5 Hospi [INVESTIGATOR_5620] (HADS) 
The HADS is a self-reported screening tool for anxiety and depression in non-psychiatric clinical 
populations.  The scale consists of 14 items (7 each for anxiety and depression), each rated on a 
4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very often). Responses are based on the relative 
frequency of symptoms over the preceding week. Possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each 
subscale. An analysis of scores on the two subscales supported the differentiation of each mood 
state into four ranges: ‘non cases’ (scores 0-7), ‘mild cases’ (scores 8-10), ‘moderate cases’ 
(scores 11-15), and ‘severe cases’ (scores 16 or higher) ( Zigmond 1983 ). 
9.2.[ADDRESS_673366] o f 
insomnia. The usual recall period is the “last month” and the dimensions evaluated are: severity 
of sleep onset, sleep maintenance and early morning awakening problems, sleep dissatisfaction, 
interference of sleep difficulties with daytime functioning, n oticeability of sleep problems by 
[CONTACT_2312], and distress caused by [CONTACT_238797]. A 5 -point Likert scale is used to rate each 
item (e.g., 0 = no problem; 4 = very severe problem), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 28. 
The total score is inter preted as follows: absence of insomnia ( 0–7); sub -threshold insomnia 
(8-14); moderate insomnia (15 –21); and severe insomnia (22 –28) (Bast ien  2001) .

Aptinyx Confidential  47 9.2.7 Daily Sl eep Interference Scale (DSIS) 
The DSIS was developed to quantify sleep interference due to pain. The DSIS is a single-item 
measure that is completed by [CONTACT_519083] a day (upon awakening) to accurately capture 
variability in sleep interference due to pain on a daily basis, thus minimizing recall bias. The 
DSIS has an 11-point response scale that asks patients to ‘‘Select the number that best describes 
how much your pain has
 interfered with your sleep during the past 24 hours.’’ Response options 
range from 0 (Did not interfere with sleep) to 10 (Completely interfered with sleep / unable to 
sleep due to pain). The DSIS is designed to be used in a patient daily diary that patients fill out 
upon awakening each morning ( Vernon 2008).  
9.2.8 Brief  Pain Inventory for Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (BPI-DPN) 
The BPI [CONTACT_832] a patient-completed numeric rating scale that assesses the severity of pain (Severity 
scale), its impact on daily functioning (Interference scale), and other aspects of pain (e.g., 
location of pain, relief from medications). A modified version of the BPI, including the 4-item 
pain Severity scale (Worst Pain, Least Pain, Average Pain, and Pain Now) and the 7-item pain 
Interference scale (General Activity, Mood, Walking Ability, Normal Work, Relations With 
Others, Sleep, Enjoyment of Life) has been validated in patients with painful diabetic peripheral 
neuropathy), which distinguishes between pain due to DPN and pain due to other causes. Each 
BPI [INVESTIGATOR_519049] a 0-10 numeric rating scale anchored at zero for “no pain” and 10 for “pain as bad 
as you can imagine” for Severity, and “does not interfere” to “completely interferes” for 
Interference. The 4 Severity items and the 7 Interference items can also each be averaged to form 
2 composite scores, the Pain Severity Index and the Pain Interference Index ( Zelm an 2005).

Body weight and height will be measured at selected visits ( Table 3).  
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-[ADDRESS_673368] rocardiogram 
Electrocardiograms (5-minute duration) will be collected after [ADDRESS_673369] and prior 
to blood sample collection, if possible. The device will be a Spaulding electrocardiogram device 
that acquires a 12-lead electrocardiogram continuously at each time point for up to 5 minutes. 
The 5 minutes of electrocardiogram data will be converted into a summary electrocardiogram 
(simulated 10-second electrocardiogram) for each electrocardiogram time point and submitted to 
the designated electrocardiogram laboratory cardiologists for measurements and diagnoses as 
though it were a standard 10-second electrocardiogram. Electrocardiograms may be repeated for 
elig
ibility assessments.  
The investigator or qualified sub-investigator will review all electrocardiogram interpretations 
and interval duration measurements for clinical significance. Standard electrocardiogram 
parameters will be measured. Clinically significant, abnormal 12-lead electrocardiograms should 
be repeated. Clinically significant electrocardiogram changes should be recorded as an adverse 
event.  
The Spaulding electrocardiogram device should be used for all assessments during the study 
unless it is non-operational, in which case another electrocardiogram may be performed locally 
and transmitted to Spaulding for central reading via printout.

The investigator will review clinical laboratory test results as they become available, for 
det
ermination and documentation of clinical significance (if there are out of range values). The 
investigative site will contact [CONTACT_519084][INVESTIGATOR_3418]. Possibly drug related or clinically relevant abnormal 
val
ues of uncertain causality must be repeated. Persistently abnormal laboratory values should be 
followed at
 the investigator’s discretion. Clinical labs may be repeated for eligibility 
asse
ssments. Abnormal liver function tests (specified in section 11) must be repeated within 48-
72 hours. 
Hematology assessments will include total white blood cell count, differential (neutrophils, 
lym
phocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), hemoglob in, hematocrit, red blood cell 
count
, platelet count and HbA1c (at Visit 1). 
Serum chemistry assessments will include electrolytes (bicarbonate, calcium, chloride, 
phosphorous
, potassium, sodium, and magnesium), enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, aspartate 
am
inotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and gamma-glutamyl 
transferase), and other (albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, indirect bilirubin, creatinine, 
glucose, tr

T
he standard version of the S-STS ( Sheehan 2014[2] ) i s a 16-item scale that assesses the 
seriousness of suicidality phenomena on a Likert-type scale (0 to 4) ranging from 0 = “not at all” 
(0) to 4 = “extremely”. It also assesses the frequency of key phenomena and the overall time 
spent in suicidality. The standard version is available in identical clinician- and subject-rated 
format
s. The S-STS accommodates a wide range of time frames. In clinical trials, the frequently 
used variants are “in the past week”, “in the past month”, “since the last visit”, “lifetime look 
back
”, and “in the past day”.

Suicidality identified after baseline will be recorded as an adverse event. 
9.4 Safety and Pharmacovigilance 
9.4.1 Ad verse Events –  Relationship to Investigational Product 
An adverse event is any untoward, undesired, unplanned clinical event in the form of signs, 
symptom
s, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a human being 
participating in a clinical study with an Aptinyx investigational product, regardless of causal 
relationship. A pre-existing condition is one that is present before investigational product dosing 
and is repo
rted as part of the subject’s medical history. Pre-existing conditions should be 
reported as an adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre-existing 
condition worsens during the
 course of the study. 
Laboratory abnormalities are not considered adverse events unless they are associated with 
clinical signs or symptoms, or require medical intervention. However, a laboratory abnormality 
(e.g., a clinically significant change detected on clinical chemistry, coagulation, hematology, 
urinalysis) that is independent from the underlying medical condition and that requires medical 
or surgical intervention, or leads to investigational product interruption or discontinuation, must 
be considered an 
adverse event. 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-[ADDRESS_673372] using the following scale: 
Un

 Does not foll ow a known response pattern to the suspect investigational product (if 
response pattern is previously known). 
 Can clea rly be explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state or 
other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
Unlikely Related 
 The tem poral sequence from dosing of the investigational product suggests that a 
re
lationship is unlikely. 
 Follows a response pattern that is unlike that of the suspect investigational product (if 
re
sponse pattern is previously known). 
 Could be re asonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject.

 Follows a reasonable temporal sequence from dosing of the investigational product .  
 May foll ow a known response pattern to the suspect investigational product (if response 
pattern is previously known). 
 Could als o be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or other modes of

Probably Related 
 Foll ows a reasonable temporal sequence from dosing of the investigational product.  
 Could not b e reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s clinical 
state or any other modes of therapy administered to the subject. 
 Is  confirmed by [CONTACT_3895][INVESTIGATOR_519050], if applicable. 
When an assessment is not provided, the event will be treated as possibly related for purposes of 
re
gulatory reporting. 
9.4.2 Recording Adverse Events 
A “pre-existing” condition is one that is present before investigational product dosing and is 
reported as part of the subject’s medical history. Pre-existing conditions should be reported as an 
adverse event only if the frequency, intensity, or character of the pre- existing condition worsens 
during the course of the study. Adverse events will be collected from the time the informed 
consent is signed to the end of the subject’s participation in the study. 
Subjects should be instructed to report all potential adverse events to the investigator, and, 
queried in a non-leading manner, without specific prompting (e.g., “How are you feeling?”). The 
sit
e study staff should assess emerging symptoms of dissociative reaction similar to those caused 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  51 by [CONTACT_519085], disturbance in time, body or 
environmental perception, stilted speech, emotional withdrawal, impaired coordination, motor 
retardation, bizarre reasoning or illusory experiences in any sensory perception, or confused 
state; such symptoms may be captured as adverse event s. 
To avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, all adverse events should be recorded in 
standard medical terminology rather than in the subject’s own words. Each adverse event will 
al
so be described in terms of duration (start and stop date), severity, relationship to 
investigational product, action(s) taken, and outcome. Diagnoses (rather than symptoms) should 
be recorded wherever possible. 
9.4.[ADDRESS_673373]’s participation in the study ends. Ongoing adverse events should be 
followed 
to a satisfactory resolution in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Subjects should be instructed 
to r
eport all adverse events to the investigator. In addition, the investigator should seek to elicit 
any cl
inical or objective reactions by [CONTACT_179546] (e.g., “How have you been feeling?”) 
and as
 appropriate by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events should be recorded on the 
eCRF. All clearly related signs, symptoms, and results of diagnostic procedures performed in 
relation to an adverse event should be grouped together and recorded as a single diagnosis.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Severi ty of Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be assessed for severity, using the following general grading scale: 
Mild: Transient or mild discomfort (<48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy required. 
Moderate: Mild to moderate limitation in activity – some assistance may be needed; no or 
m
inimal medical intervention/therapy required. 
Severe: Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy,  required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]. 
Life
 threatening: Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant 
m
edical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328525]. 
W
hen changes in the severity of an adverse event occur more frequently than once a day, the 
m
aximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes 
over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset 
dates). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Acti on Taken for Adverse Events 
For ea
ch reported adverse event, an investigator must document the action taken according to the 
following criteria: 
 No acti on taken 
 Concomitant medication taken 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519051]-2925-2001   Version 4.0

 Dose not changed 
 Inve stigational product interrupted 
 Inve stigational product withdrawn 
 Not appli cable 
 Unknow n 
[IP_ADDRESS] Outc ome for Adverse Events 
Adverse events should be followed until resolution. For each reported adverse event, the 
investigator must document the outcome according to the following criteria: 
 Fata l

 Recover ed/resolved 
 Recover ed/resolved with sequelae 
 Recovering/resolving 
 Unknow n 
9.5 Serious Adverse Events 
Serious adverse events are reported to the sponsor-designated medical monitor using the Aptinyx 
provided form by [CONTACT_519086]: 
  
  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
 Death: “Death” is an outcome and is NOT the adverse event. In the event of death, 
the cause of death should be recorded as the adverse event. The only exception is 
“sudden death” when the cause is unknown. 
 Is a life-threatening experience: Life-threatening adverse events include any adverse 
drug experie
nce, which, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurs. It does not include a reaction 
that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death. 
 Requir es inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_519052]-2925-2001   Version 4.0 
  28 Feb 2018  
Aptinyx Confidential  53  Result s in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity : Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption in a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 Result s in a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 Additi onally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life 
thr
eatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse event 
when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
previously. Example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home. 
All serious adverse events that result in death or are life threatening, regardless of causal 
re
lationship, must be reported to the sponsor-designated medical monitor within 24 hours of the 
sit
e’s knowledge of the event. A copy of the initial serious adverse event report must be received 
withi
n 1 business day. 
All ot
her serious adverse events or other events reportable to the [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug 
Ad
ministration (FDA) and/or IRB will be forwarded to the sponsor-designated medical monitor 
withi
n 1 business day. 
The serious adverse event report should provide as much of the required information as is 
avai
lable at the time. The following minimum information is required for reporting a serious 
adverse event: subject identification, reporting source, and an event outcome. Supplemental 
information may be transmitted using a follow-up report and should not delay the initial report. 
Aptinyx may contact [CONTACT_115996]-up on 
the event. 
If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes a serious adverse event, the information 
will be treated as a serious adverse event for the purposes of this protocol. Serious adverse event 
re
porting will begin at the time of consent and will end [ADDRESS_673374] dose.   
All r
elevant documentation pertaining to a serious adverse event (additional laboratory tests, 
consul
tation reports, discharge summaries, postmortem reports, etc.) will be provided to the 
sponsor-designated medical monitor in a timely manner. Serious adverse events will be followed 
unti
l resolution or return to baseline (when worsening of a pre-existing condition is reported). If 
a se
rious adverse event does not return to baseline but reaches a stable situation that is not 
expec
ted to change, this may be documented on the serious adverse event form. 
The Sponsor 
may break the treatment code for subjects who experience a serious adverse event 
in order to determine if the individual case or group of cases required expedited regulatory 
reporting. Individual treatment codes will be available to limited staff who are responsible to 
break codes for reporting purposes. 
All serious adverse events will be reported to the FDA. 
9.6 Other Re
portable Events 
Reports of overdose (with or without an adverse event), abuse, dependency, inadvertent or 
accidental exposure, pregnancy, and unexpected therapeutic benefit should be forwarded in the 
same timeframe as a serious adverse event. Overdose occurs when a subject is dosed or has taken

Aptinyx Confidential  61 12 STATISTICS 
12.1 Sample Size Determination 
The planned sample size is 300 randomized subjects. This sample size will provide 
appr
oximately 80% power for a 2-sided t-test with Type I error of 0.048.  
12
.2 Randomization 
Daily pain scores and diary compliance will be transferred into the interactive response 
technology system, which will be used to assess the criteria for randomization. Subjects whose 
mean of the daily average pain intensity score during the preceding 7 (±1) days is within the 
protocol-defined algorithm and with adequate compliance with daily diary completion will be 
eligible for randomization. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive either NYX-[ADDRESS_673382] baseline assessment of the pain intensity 
NRS .

Aptinyx Confidential  62 12.5 Analyses of Efficacy  
12.5.1 Prim ary Efficacy Endpoint 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the daily pain intensity NRS score from the handheld device 
will be 
averaged for baseline (Days -7 to -1 ) and  Week 4 (Days 22 to 28) after randomization. 
Change from baseline to Week 4 will be assessed for treatment group differences with an 
analysis of covariance with fixed factors for study site and treatment, with baseline value as a 
covariate. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Sensitivity Analysis 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, the daily pain intensity NRS score from the handheld device 
will be 
averaged for baseline (Days -7 to -1 ) and  each week (Days 1 to 7, Days 8 to 14, Days 15 
to 21,
 and Days 22 to 28) after randomization. A mixed model repeated measures analysis of 
var
iance will be used to assess treatment differences. The model will include factors for study 
site, treatment, week, and the treatment-by-week interaction, with baseline value as a covariate. 
12.5.[ADDRESS_673383] 24 hours from 
baseline (average of Days -7 to -1) to each week of treatment (average of Days 1 through 7, 
Days 8 through 14, and Days 15 through 21) will be assessed for treatment group differences 
with a
n analysis of covariance with fixed factors for study site and treatment, with baseline value 
as a covariate. Change from baseline for the PGI-C, SF-MPQ-2, QOL-DN, Insomnia Severity 
Index, HADS, DSIS, BPI-DPN will be analyzed similarly. 
The use of rescue medication and percent of subjects meeting responder criteria (≥30% reduction 
and first ≥50% reduction in the NRS average pain intensity) will be summarized descriptive ly. 
The number of days to the first ≥30% reduction and first ≥50% reduction in the NRS average 
pai
n intensity and the number of days to sustained pain reduction will be assessed for treatment 
group diff
erences with the log-rank test. Subjects who fail to achieve the target reduction will be 
cens
ored at the end of their final week with NRS pain intensity measurements. 
12.5.3 Mult iple Comparisons 
The primary efficacy endpoint and primary statistical analysis are protocol-specified. A Type I 
error
 of 0.005 will be allocated to the interim analysis (if applicable) and a Type I error of 0.048 
will be allocated to the final analysis ( Fleming 1984 ). There will be no adjustment for multiple 
treatment group comparisons in this phase 2 study. 
12.6 Ana
lyses of Safety  
All safety summaries will be descriptive; no statistical testing will be performed. 
 Clinical Protocol Masked NYX-2925-[ADDRESS_673384] will be counted 
only once in that system organ class category.  
The following TEAE summaries will be provided for the Screening Period and Treatment Period 
(i
ncluding Follow-Up) :  
 O verall summary of TEAEs  
 TEA Es by [CONTACT_6657]  
 Drug -related TEAEs by [CONTACT_6657] 
 TEA Es by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, and severity 
Serious TEAEs and TEAEs leading to investigational product discontinuation will be identified. 
12.6.2  Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Mean change from baseline (Visit 2) to Week 4 (Visit 4) will be summarized descriptively for 
each analyte. 
Clinical laboratory results considered clinically important by [CONTACT_519092]. 
Individual
 results for clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) 
outsi
de the normal range will be flagged in the data listings.

.7 Interim Analysis 
One interim analysis may be conducted after approximately 50% of subjects (i.e., approximately 
150 subjects) have completed Visit 4. Based on the interim analysis, 1 or more dose groups of 
NYX
-2925 could be discontinued and the total sample size re-estimated. A Type I error of 0.005 
would be allocated to the interim analysis. Complete details of the interim analysis would be 
provi
ded in a separate analysis plan. It is not anticipated that the interim analysis would lead the 
Sponsor t
o decide to terminate the trial, although such a decision, made for any reason, would be 
m
ade after consultation with FDA.

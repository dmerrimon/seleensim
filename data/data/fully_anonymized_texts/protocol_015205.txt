5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
The clinical and financial burden of patients with suspected reflux associated laryngeal sym ptoms 
(RALS) is substantial. RALS is the process where gastro- esophago- pharyngeal reflux contributes to 
chronic laryngeal symptoms such as sore throat and dysphonia. The objectives of this proposal are 
to understand the performance of standard of care diagnostic tools  and treatment options  among 
suspected RALS.  
 
6. SPECIFIC AIMS  
Aim 1: To determine the ability of novel diagnostic tools to predict symptom -based treatment respon se 
in suspected RALS.  
Hypothesis: Salivary pepsin will have high sensitivity for  response to proton pump inhibitor ( PPI); pH-
impedance (Z2pH) and esophageal manometry (HRIM) will have high specificity for response to Upper 
esophageal sphincter assist device ( UESAD ) in adjunct to PPI.  
 Aim 2: To examine the therapeutic efficacy of UES augmentation in suspected RALS.  
Hypothesis:  UESAD in adjunct to PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458888].  
 
Approach:  We will perform an [ADDRESS_586301] ic tests (esophageal manometry (HRIM), pH -impedance (Z2pH)) 
and research diagnostic test (salivary pepsin) followed by [CONTACT_458923][INVESTIGATOR_014]  (PPI x [ADDRESS_586302] to PPI x 4 weeks).  
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
Reflux ass ociated laryngeal symptoms (RALS), coined “laryngopharyngeal reflux”, occurs when 
gastro -esophago- pharyngeal reflux contributes to chronic laryngeal symptoms such as throat 
clearing, sore throat and dysphonia.1, 2, [ADDRESS_586303] RALS, although 60% of cases are likely 
misdiagnosed.5, 12, [ADDRESS_586304] office 
visits and 6 diagnostic tests, often without clarity or improved health- related quality of life.12, 24- 26 This 
redundant and ineffective clinical paradigm contributes to health care costs of $5,438 per patient, 
equating to over $[ADDRESS_586305] -effective and patient -
centered approaches to suspected RALS.   
 
Clinical Barrier  Treatment strategies for suspected RALS are inappropriately generalized  
Patients presenting with laryngeal complaints are heterogeneous in terms of symptom presentation, 
underlying physiology, and response to treatment. For instance, non- reflux mechanisms commonly 
generate laryngeal irritation; in these cases acid suppression and anti -reflux therapy is 
unwarranted.27 Nonetheless, the majority of patients with suspected RALS are trialed on empi[INVESTIGATOR_458889]. However, fewer than 50% of patients will derive 
symptom relief with PPI [CONTACT_48831].13, [ADDRESS_586306] RALS.28 Furthermore, anti -reflux  surgery is often 
considered, even though anti -reflux surgery is invasive, morbid and costly, and not shown to improve 
outcomes.15-17  Thus, effective, safe, and personalized treatment options are needed.   
 
Diagnostic Challenges Current diagnostic tools are unable to reliably identify RALS  A major 
barrier to identifying true RALS is that traditional diagnostic tools assess anatomic or physiologic 
properties in isolation, resulting in poor specificity, sensitivity, and prognostic ability

9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
Study Design: This is a prospective  multicenter  single -arm non -randomized non -controlled clinical 
trial registered with clinicaltrials.gov. This study will be performed at the UCSD Medical Campus  and 
the University  of Colorado (CU)  Medical Campus . With regards to IRB the plan is that University of 
Colorado will have IRB oversight of the study activities at University of Colorado and UCSD will have 
IRB oversight of study activities at UCSD. The study has already been active and IRB approved at 
University of Colorado. (IRB Approval letter from University of Colorado included)  
Setting at UCSD: Patients will be enrolled from clinics of study investigators that are also the treating 
provider for the patient. Therefore, the patients are known to the investigator and have a treatment relationship. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are below. The clinics are clinics of [CONTACT_458950], [CONTACT_369882], [CONTACT_186448], [CONTACT_458951], [CONTACT_458952].  
Study Protocol:  
Screening:  Upcoming c linics staffed by [CONTACT_458924] 
(RA) to identify potential participants. The PI/RA will notify the study investigator MD of patient’s eligibility. Once investigator approves, the RA will contact [CONTACT_458925], determine eligibility, and answer any questions.

Page [ADDRESS_586308] of care Clinic Visit (Visit 1):  At the already scheduled standard of care clinic visit t he 
treating physician will provide the potential participant with information regarding the study. If the 
patient is interested in participating in the study, the RA will review the study in detail and obtain informed consent. At this time request s for procedures, office visits, and PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458890].  
 Standard of Care Diagnostic Evaluation (Visit 2):  Participants  will present for standard of care 
(SOC) diagnostic evaluation.   
• Esophageal manometry (will not be repeated if performed within 3 months  of study)  
• 24 hour pH impedance monitoring (will not be repeated if performed within 3 months  of study)  
• Patient reported outcome questionnaires : the Gerd questionnaire (GerdQ) and the Reflux Symptom 
Index. These are validated patient reported outcome instruments, available in English and Spanish.  
• Saliva sample collection . Participant s will self -induce (non -invasive) 2cc of saliva. Saliva will be 
collected in a testtube and immediately processed using the Peptest technique to measure pepsin 
concentration in the saliva. Saliva will not be stored.  
Per national guidelines and recommendations, it is SOC to evaluate patients with suspected RALS 
with esophageal manometry and pH impedance in the motility laboratory. This practice is SOC at 
UCSD. Therefore, esophageal manometry and pH impedance procedures are expenses that insurance typi[INVESTIGATOR_458891]. Patient reported outcome questionnaires are SOC nationwide and are SOC at our motility lab at UCSD. The time for these SOC procedures combined is 90 minutes.  * in 
the table indicates that the costs for these SOC procedures are expected to be covered by [CONTACT_458926] a risk that for a certain subject insurance may cover the costs. Therefore, orders for tests will be placed at the first SOC clinic visit and potential costs not covered by [CONTACT_458927].  Table 1.

2 and week 3 of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458897], adherence, 
and remind the participant  of the mid- treatment visit.  
Mid-Treatment Visit (Visit 4):  After 4 weeks of PPI [CONTACT_48831] , the participant  will present to a clinic 
room at Clinical Trial Research Institute for a mid -treatment visit. During this visit the PI/RA will collect 
a saliva sample non-invasively via the method described below and analyzed for pepsin 
concentration (2 minutes). The participant  will complete a SOC questionnaire to assess clinical 
outcomes following the PPI [CONTACT_48831]. The participant  will be given an UES assist device. The PI/RA 
will fit the UES assist device during this visit and educate the participant  on use of the UES assist 
device. The UES assist device is an FDA approved non- invasive device that is available over the 
counter for this proposed participant  population, and is not considered a research intervention. For 
this study the research team will provide the UES assist device free of cost to the participant . 
Therefore, the participant  will not incur any costs related to the UES assist device.  The visit duration 
will be [ADDRESS_586313] Device & PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458893] (Weeks 5 to 8):  The participant  will use the UES assist device

invasively via the method described below and analyzed for pepsin concentration (2 minutes). The 
participant  will complete a SOC questionnaire to assess clinical outcomes following the PPI + UES 
assist device therapy. Participant s are permitted to keep the UES assist device if they intend to 
continue to use it, free of cost.  
Phone Call:  The PI/RA will call the participant  at week [ADDRESS_586316], and provide a streamlined and efficient evaluation.   
 
 
 
SPECIFIC AIMS & DATA ANALYSIS  
 
Aim 1:  To determine the ability of novel diagnostic tools to predict symptom -based treatment response 
in suspected RALS.  
Data Analysis for Aim 1  
Aim 1 analysis will employ a series of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess and compare baseline diagnostic tool ability to predict patient -reported symptom response to treatment 
(positive or negative) at time points B (post -PPI) and C (post -UESAD+PPI). The areas under the 
ROC curves (AUCs) will be  
 Sample Size & Power Calculation:  At UCSD w e plan to enroll 100 participants with an  
expected <15% dropout, with an overall analytic sample size of ≥80. Assuming a minimal response 
rate of 50% to PPI [INVESTIGATOR_1238] 67% to UESAD+PPI, a sample size of 80 and alpha level of 0.05 allows for 90% power to detect an AUC ≥0.70. The UESAD+PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458899].  
 Aim 2:  To examine the therapeutic efficacy of UES augmentation in suspected RALS.  
Data Analysis for Aim 2  
Aim 2 analysis will employ a longitudinal mixed model to assess the association between intervention (PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458900]+PPI) and ou tcome (patient reported symptom response). Longitudinal data will be 
clustered by [CONTACT_458933], and analyzed at 3 study time points: A (baseline), B (post -PPI), and C (post -UESAD+PPI) to specifically compare change from A  to B and B 
to C. Salivary pepsin at time points B and C will also serve as an objectively measured response variable.  
 Sample Size & Power Calculation: The participants in Aim 1 will be included in Aim 2. With 80 
participants, if we conservatively assume that the correlations among the repeated measures is ≥0.5, 
we have 90% power to detect an effect of 0.37SD as measured by [CONTACT_458934] A  to B and B  to 
C (the effects measured in pi[INVESTIGATOR_458901] 0.1SD). It is likely that we would also want to estimate change from B toC in the subset of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458902]-responders; we have 90% power to detect 
a change of 0.37SD (30 participants) or 0.53SD (40 participants).  
 Inclusion of Women & Minorities:  Approximately 25% of women and minorities have RALS. We 
anticipate that approximately 60% of participant s will b e wo men and at least 10% will be minorities.

clearing, and/or voice hoarseness, naïve to PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458903] 8 weeks, any ethnic 
background   
B. Exclusion criteria:  Laryngeal mass lesion on laryngoscopy  (if performed); Pregnant;  
Breastfeeding;  Unable to consent in English or Spanish as questionnaires are only validated in 
English  and Spanish; Imprisoned; PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458904];  Contraindication to UESAD use per 
manufacturer guidelines which include:  
• Patients with implants or implant parts that reside in the area where UESAD is applied.  
• Patients with an implanted pacemaker, implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), vagus nerve 
stimulator, or other such similar devices implanted in the neck.

11. RECRUITMENT AND PROCEDURES PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH  
How will participant s be identified for recruitment? The research assistant (RA)/PI [INVESTIGATOR_458905], endoscopy unit and motility lab that  are patients 
of study investigators. The RA/PI [INVESTIGATOR_458906]/treating MDs if eligible participant 
meeting inclusion criteria is  identified. RA will keep a password protected screening list stored in a 
secure server separate from research  data.  This will protect identifiers from improper use and 
disclosure. A partial HIPAA waiver will be used for the minimal risk record review because identifying 
and contact[CONTACT_458936] a medical record revi ew where 
results would not change care the individuals already would have received, and waiver will not adversely 
affect the rights of welfare of the subjects.  
1. What PHI will be accessed to identify participants? Participant s name, DOB, MRN, current 
medications, disease diagnosis,  and relevant medical records (gastroenterology and laryngology 
records) will be accessed to identify if a patient meets inclusion criteria. No PHI will be stored in the screening log if the patient does not meet the inclusion crit eria. This will protect identifiers 
from improper use and disclosure.  
 
2. When will participant s be approached for recruitment? If treating MD/study investigator 
approves, the RA will call the potential research participant  using the pre- screening phone script 
to notify the participant about the study, review eligibility and answer any questions and/or will 
contact [CONTACT_458937]. They will be given the consent form 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_586317] that cannot be answered by [CONTACT_21118].  
 
3. Who can refer patients to the study? Patients may be referred to the study by [CONTACT_83671] , and are participant  to the same screening process to determine if they are eligible.  
Patients will not be obtained from any recruitment database.  
 4. Who will not be considered for recruitment? Participant  must be able to consent to the study. 
This protocol involves minimal risk, and/or targets only populations wherein impaired decision-making capacity is unlikely. Based upon past experience, we expect that the population of 
patients we will be including in this protocol will be competent to give informed consent. If there is any concern by [CONTACT_458938] a potential research participant has a condition or circumstance that is associated with a possible decrease in decision making capacity, that participant  will not be included in the study.   
 
At risk populations including but not limited to prisoners, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, the mentally disabled, cognitively impaired, those requiring legal adult representation, and individuals under the age of [ADDRESS_586318] 
of research.  
 
12. INFORMED CONSENT  
This study has a consent process.  The RA/PI [INVESTIGATOR_458907].  Participants will be 
screened prior to consent by [CONTACT_458939]. Only patients under a treating relationship by [CONTACT_458940]. No research procedures will be 
done prior to obtaining consent (including fasting). Participant s will not provide information about 
other identifiable persons, such as relatives or friends (secondary participant s) that will be used for 
data analysis.  Participant s will receive a signed and dated copy of the consent form to be kept in their 
electronic medical record, and can ask for a paper copy in clinic.  There is no deception involved in 
this study.  
 1. How will consent be obtained? Consent will be obtained face- to-face and/or via email. The 
consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_21118] /PI. If c onsent  is obtained face- to-face it  will take place in a 
private clinic setting. The participant will be given time to read the consent and ask questions before they decide to participate. Comprehension and autonomy will be assessed by [CONTACT_458941]. Only the participant  may provide 
consent or permission.  
2. Who will obtain consent? The RA /PI [INVESTIGATOR_458908] s. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_458909].  
3. Who will be excluded from the study and why? Participant s unable to consent and complete 
questionnaires in English or Spanish will be excluded. This study requires participant ’s patients to 
answer their own questionnaires. The questionnaires used in this study are verified in English and 
Spanish.  Participant s who are blind, illiterate or have similar reading limitations will be excl uded. A 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 9 self-reporting questionnaire will be used in this study. It may alter the answers if the questionnaire 
is read to them.  If English is not the participant’s primary language then an official health 
translator will be used. A Spanish version of the informed consent form will also be developed 
after the current informed consent version is approved by [CONTACT_1201].  
4. How will consent be documented? A copy of the signed informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization will be placed in the participant ’s medical record. The patient will also receive a 
signed and dated copy of the consent form electronically, and may request a paper copy in clinic if this is not accessible to them. The original consent form and HIPAA authorization will be kept in a secure office until completion of the study.  
 
 
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
Patients may elect to not participate in the study and continue with a standard course of tr eatment for 
their GERD and RALS as discussed with their physician.  
 
14. POTENTIAL RISKS  
Complet ion of questionnaire  (Standard of Care) :  There exists a small risk of emotional upset 
when filling out questionnaires. Participant s may experience some anxiety as they are asked to 
answer personal questions or are reminded of unpleasant thoughts or experi ences during the 
questionnaire process. The participant , as always, has the right to refuse to answer any question 
they are asked. However the study team shall determine if the extent of refusal may warrant the removal of the participant  from the research study so as to ensure complete and accurate data 
collection.   
 Pepsin analysis (Research) : The Peptest requires non- invasive ( participant  induced) collection of 
saliva.  There is no diagnostic or therapeutic procedure performed. There may be a small amount of discomfort when the participant  is bringing up saliva for collection. There is also a risk that the 
Peptest result will be incorrect (false negative or false positive).  However, no decisions regarding management of a patient’s disease will be made based on the results of this test.   
 Esophageal Manometry (HRIM)  (Standard of Care)  
The manometry test measures the strength of the esophagus muscle and the direction of movement of the muscular contractions.  Impedance can also detect the direction and speed of fluid and airflow through the esophagus. This procedure takes approximately 45 minutes.  It involves passing a recording tube (less than 1/4 inch across) through the nose into the esophagus.  The tube is designed to measure pressures in the pharynx, esophagus and stomach.  A lubricant will be put on 
the end of the tube to make the placement more comfortable. An anesthetic (numbing) jelly (Lidocaine®) is also available if you choose. Once the manometry tube is in place, the participant  will 
be asked to swallow 5 ml (1 teaspoon) of water or a salt solution several times throughout the 
measurement.  
 pH impedance  (Standard of Care)  (Z2pH) : 
A pH -impedance catheter will then be placed in a similar manner through the nose and into the 
esophagus.  This catheter measures how acidic the environment in your esophagus is.  Impedance can also detect the direction and speed of fluid and airflow through the esophagus.  These measurements allow the physician to determine if gastro -esophageal reflux is contributing to y our 
symptoms.  This procedure takes approximately 45 minutes.  
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 10  The catheter will be attached to a portable receiver that you will wear for 24 hours.  You will be given 
instructions as to how to note meals, sleep, and symptoms throughout the 24 hour period.  
 
The risks of manometry (HRIM) and pH impedance (Z2pH) : Placement of the manometry and pH -
Impedance catheters through the nose can cause g agging or mild pain in the nose and throat , skin 
irritation. Nosebleeds can also rarely occur.  These tests are standar d of care and care will be taken 
to reduce these risks as much as possible. All procedures will be performed by [CONTACT_458942].   
 Upper esophageal sphincter assist device (Standard of Care) : 
The upper esophageal sphincter assist device (UESAD) is a band that is worn externally around the neck, and provide increased pressure at the upper esophageal sphincter. It is recommended to be worn at nighttime.  
 The safety of the UESAD (Reflux  Band) has been assessed in previous studies. Adverse events that 
were reported during these studies were generally mild, short in duration, and the majority of these events were not related to the device. Those events that were related to the device were also generally mild and short in duration. Potential risks include discomfort, difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], skin 
irritation, risk of over compression, misuse, incorrect fitting, and malfunctions.  
 Device -related adverse events did not result in reduced outcomes in relation to the change of the R SI 
score from baseline to the score measured after [ADDRESS_586319] on heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, or intraocular pressure when the UESAD  was worn as intended 
as well as when it was intentionally displaced laterally, as compared to the baseline. This device has been approved for sale and marketing by [CONTACT_458943], and is 
available as an over the counter device.  
 Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) Therapy: Short -term use of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458910]: headache, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, flatulence, nausea, 
vomiting, and rash. Short -term PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458911]. The FDA has determined that short -term use of PPI [INVESTIGATOR_458912].  
  Potential loss of confidentiality: Finally, there is a risk that confidentiality of participant  information 
will be breached.  However, all participant  data will be kept confidential, following HIPAA regulations.  
Participant  data will be stored on encrypted files.     
 
Data safety and compliance monitoring: Compliance to UESAD use will be monitored via patient -
reported outcomes during telephone follow -up by [CONTACT_17033]. In addition, research 
assistant will assess for adverse events to the UESAD d uring telephone follow -up. A designated 
physician in gastroenterology team will serve as the safety monitor will to assess adverse events and safety concerns.  
 
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 11  Questionnaires - The participant , as always, has the right to refuse to answer any question they are 
asked.  However the study team shall determine if the extent of refusal may warrant the removal of 
the participant  from the research study so as to ensure complete and accurate data collectio n.    
 Manometry & pH impedance – 
-Gagging or mild pain in the nose and throat. In this event, the nurse/technician will stop catheter 
advancement and will use a light to inspect the oral cavity and nares. If the catheter is in an appropriate configuration, the patient will be asked to take deep breaths and promote relaxation. Once the patient is comfortable the patient will be advised to drink sips of water as catheter advancement is attempted. If symptoms do not improve catheter placement will be aborted and the ordering provider notified.  
-Skin irritation. The catheter is transnasally placed and the proximal end of the catheter will sit gently 
across the patient’s cheek and loop around the ear lobe. To ensure adequate placement of the pH impedance catheter over the 24 hour period, a non- abrasive anti -slip tape will be used to secure the 
catheter to the cheek. There is risk of skin irritation. The motility nurse/technician and gastroenterology team are on call 24 hours a day, and in the event of skin irritation the patient will be advised by [CONTACT_458944] a finger width space between the catheter and the cheek. The skin will be evaluated the following day when the patient drops the catheter off by [CONTACT_46566]. However, if the skin  remains irritated the patient will be educated on catheter removal over 
the phone.     
-Nosebleeds can also rarely occur. In this rare event, pressure will be applied by [CONTACT_46566].  An 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_458913].   
 Reflux band Band (UESAD) - the device, and how it works will be fully explained to the participant , 
any questions they have will be answered. If the device is worn the correct way, there have been no risks found. Participant s will have the phone number of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_445461], and will be 
advised to contact [CONTACT_458945]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_458914] , and will discuss how they will move forward which may include re- education about device 
use, re- fitting of the device, or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_172535].   
  Peptest - very little risk to begin with, other than the participant  being sli ghtly uncomfortable during  
saliva production. The procedure will be explained to the participant  so they know what to expect. If 
there is  false negative or false positive result, no decisions regarding management of a patient's disease will be made based on the results of this test.   
  To protect confidentiality, all participant  data will be kept confidential, following HIPAA regulations.  
Participant  data will be stored on encrypted files on a password protected  data base that only the 
study team will have access to .  
  
RALS participant s will be called every [ADDRESS_586320], this event will be reported to the UCSD 
IRB HRPP within 10 days.  
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
Benefit s of this study include  assisting doctors in having a better diagnostic and therapeutic plan for 
RALS to be more accurate and efficient, and offering an improved diagnostic and therapeutic plan to 
society. 
 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
The risks in this resear ch study are minimal. UESAD has very little found side -effects, and has been 
proven to help symptoms. This device is non- medication and non- surgical. It is not invasive.  
The pepsin test also has minimal risk, but it could help the doctor better diagnose a nd assess the 
participant  to find the best course of treatment. The pepsin test is much less invasive than all the 
other diagnostic tests that are being used for RALS, hopefully this will be a much easier way to diagnose RALS and more comfortable for the participant .  
  The benefits to this study could entail much  more affordable and more effective treatments for the 
patient suffering from RALS, which outweighs the minimal risks listed.  
 The ineffective and circuitous care for suspected RALS contributes to an estimated $[ADDRESS_586321] of care for this patient population at UCSD and the procedure and related side effects will be covered by [CONTACT_22241]: esophageal manometry, pH impedance, and PPI [CONTACT_48831].

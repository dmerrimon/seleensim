1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction 
Continuous pulse oximetry (SpO 2) monitoring has revolutionized detection of oxygen desaturation in 
operating rooms and other high- risk areas, improving outcomes in those settings.1,2 However, 
research suggests that overuse of continuous SpO 2 monitoring in stable children with bronchiolitis 
who are unlikely to benefit from it is low -value care that places some children at risk of adverse 
outcomes.3–12 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_343005]13,14 discouraging continuous pulse oximetry use in stable bronchiolitis 
patients, 46% of those infants and children are continuously monitored (not yet published data from a 
multicenter study performed in 56 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343011] ).  
This study aims to pi[INVESTIGATOR_343012] a 
multicenter cluster -randomized hybrid trial.  
1.2 Relevant Literature and Data  
1.2.1  Bronchiolitis SpO 2 monitoring guidelines  
Appropriate use of SpO 2 monitoring in children with bronchiolitis is guided by [CONTACT_30255] (AAP) Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Bronchiolitis
13 and Society of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343013].14 The AAP 
Guideline was published by [CONTACT_343071] (Advisory Committee member) and colleagues in 2014.13 The 
Guideline states that “Clinicians may choose not to use continuous pulse oximetry for children with a 
diagnosis of bronchiolitis ,” citing intermittent monitoring benefits including shorter length of stay, 
decreased alarm fatigue, and decreased cost. The Society of Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343014] a stronger stance against monitoring, s tating “Do not use 
continuous pulse oximetry routinely in children with acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_343015].”14 
1.2.2  Research published since bronchiolitis SpO 2 monitoring guidelines  
Since publication of the AAP Guideline and Choosing Wisely recommendations, 3 randomized 
trials,3–[ADDRESS_424810] using continuous SpO 2 monitoring in favor of intermittent SpO 2 measurement 
in children with bronchiolitis not requiring supplemental oxygen.  The research below demonstrates 
that intermittent SpO 2 monitoring is a safe alternative,3,7 those who are continuously monitored 
unnecessarily are at risk  of adverse outcomes including prolonged length of stay,5,8,9 iatrogenic 
harm,10 and increased costs,5 and false SpO 2 monitor alarms contribute to alarm fatigue.11,12 
McCulloh et al performed a randomized trial comparing continuous versus intermittent SpO 2 
monitoring among children with bronchiolitis at 4 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343016] 90% or higher off supplemental oxygen.
[ADDRESS_424811] their SpO 2 measured either with an oximeter 
with true SpO 2 displayed or a modified oximeter with falsely elevated SpO 2 displayed (+3 percentage 
points). Patients whose SpO [ADDRESS_424812] outcomes but are over weighted in 
clinical decision making (in this study, the decision to admit).  
In the Bronchiolitis of Infancy Discharge Study (BIDS), a randomized controlled trial of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343017], Cunningham et al randomized infants to be continuously  monitored using 
either a standard pulse oximeter or a modified oximeter that falsely inflated SpO
2, displaying a 
measured value of 90% as 94%.[ADDRESS_424813] oximeter group had significantly greater hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343018], primarily driven by [CONTACT_343072][INVESTIGATOR_33798], supplemental oxygen, and oximeter probes.
16 Like Schuh’s study, we interpret these findings as indicating that continuous pulse oximetry 
likely identifies minor desaturations that do not impact patient outcomes but are over weighted in clinical decis ion making, unnecessarily prolonging oxygen administration and length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343019].   
Principi [INVESTIGATOR_343020] a cohort study of infants presenting to an emergency department with bronchiolitis who were well enough to be discharged home.
6 Prior to discharge, researchers applied 
pulse oximeters to the infants. The oximeters had alarms disabled and their displays did not show SpO
2 values. They collected the oximeters 72 hours later. They found that half of these infants 
deemed well enough for discharge had desaturations to 80% or less for at least 1 minute and one-
quarter had desaturation to 70% or less for at least [ADDRESS_424814] clinical 
decision support. They found a reduction of median time on continuous pulse oximetry from 10.7 to 
3.1 hours without a difference in rapid response team activations, ICU transfers, or readmissions. 
This study confirms the safety of the AAP Guideline and Choosing Wisely recommendations, and supports the practice of removing continuous pulse oximetry after supplemental oxygen is discontinued and replacing it with intermittent SpO
2 monitoring.  
In a 2017 BMJ expert commentary , “When technology creates uncertainty: pulse oximetry and 
overdiagnosis of hypoxaemia in bronchiolitis,”15 Quinonez et al  review ed the literature above and 
argue that the widespread use of pulse oximetry in stable bronchiolitis patients leads to overdiagnosis of hypoxemia. Overdiagnosis is when a true abnormality is discovered, but awareness 
of the abnormality does not benefit the patient.
17 The authors conclude that “current body of 
evidence suggests that we should challenge assumptions regarding the detection and aggressive 
management of borderline hypoxemia in non- critically ill infants with bronchiolitis,” because current 
overuse of continuous pulse oximetry has led to overdiagnosis of clinically insignificant hypoxemia that contributes to unnecessary resource utilization and risk of patient harm.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_424815] trial is a single center pi[INVESTIGATOR_343021].
18 The second is a 6- center trial that is ongoing.19 While results of the intervention on the 
primary outcome (length of stay) are not yet available, in a personal communication the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_343022] 89  patients randomized to intermittent (as opposed to 
continuous) SpO
[ADDRESS_424816] Evidence for Effective Pediatric (BEEP) Monitoring Study  
The BEEP study, performed in 2018 (not yet published)  and led by [CONTACT_343073], MD, 
MSc used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness method and a panel of experts nominated by [CONTACT_343074], physician, human factors, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_343023] a family advocacy organization to develop consensus guidelines for physiologic monitoring in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343024]- ICU settings. Pertinent to this proposal, the expert panel determined the following 
scenarios to be appropriate and necessary : 
   
   3 
• Children hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343025] 2 value of >=90% without 
supplemental oxygen in the absence of witnessed apnea or cyanosis should NOT receive 
continuous pulse oximetry monitoring, instead they should receive intermittent pulse 
oximetry measurement  
• Children weaned from supplemental oxygen should be transitioned to intermittent oximetry 
measurement within 1 hour if oxygen saturations are stable at >=90% unless otherwise 
indicated by [CONTACT_343075]. 
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_424817] observation during the 2018 -19 
bronchiolitis season  
From D ecember 2018 through March 2019, our team performed a 56- center observational study 
within the Pediatric Research in Inpatient Settings (PRIS) Network measuring pulse oximetry use in 
stable infants and children not requiring supplemental oxygen.21 This is the population for whom the 
AAP and Choosing Wisely support avoiding the use of continuous pulse oximetry.  
The study aimed to include exclusively patients for whom continuous pulse oximetry is not indicated according the AAP and Choosing Wisely guidelines: Children [ADDRESS_424818] services in non-
ICU areas, and not currently on any supplemental oxygen or room air flow support. We excluded 
infants born at <[ADDRESS_424819] was funded by [CONTACT_343076] (CHOP 
IRB# 18 -015070).  
In this study that included over 3600 in- person assessments of pulse oximetry monitoring status, we 
found that the overall monitoring rate across all hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65262] 46%, with a very wide range of variation, ranging from hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343026] <5% of these patients to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343026] >85% of 
these patients (results not yet published; see figure below).  These results support efforts to reduce 
continuous pulse oximetry in stable bronchiolitis patients in outlier hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343027].  
Prior to submitting a subsequent grant that will aim to de-implement continuous pulse oximetry in a well-defined stable bronchiolitis population, we must establish the feasibility of a foundational audit 
and feedback  strategy for addressing continuous pulse oximetry overuse.

1.2.6  Effective strategies for implementing practice guidelines  
In a recent report from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force 
on Clinical Practice Guidelines, evidence from the published implementation science literature was presented describing effective strategies to enhance the adoption and implementation of clinical 
practice guidelines.
[ADDRESS_424820] effective in improving outcomes measuring processes of care as well as 
clinical outcomes.  However, the specific aspects of audit and feedback that make this strategy 
effective (e.g. who the feedback data are delivered to, what information is delivered, is comparison data provided, are data presented graphically, what is the lag time between data collection and feedback, etc) are not well established, but are an active area of inquiry in the field of implementation 
science. The subsequent trial that we will plan based upon the results of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_343028].  
1.3 Compliance Statement  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343029].  All 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_48478].  
The investigators will perform the study in accordance with this protocol and will report unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects or others in accordance with Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_137069]. Collection, recording, and reporting of 
data will be accurate and will ensure the privacy, health, and welfare of research subjects during and 
after th e study.  
 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES 
2.1 Primary Objective (or Aim)  
The primary objective of this study is to measure the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of 
audit and feedback  with educational outreach as a strategy to align continuous pulse oximetry use in 
stable bronchiolitis patients with evidence and guideline recommendations.  
2.2 Secondary Objectives (or Aim)  
The secondary objectives are to:  
• Measure continuous pulse oximetry use rates in children with bronchiolitis who are not requiring 
supplemental oxygen administration.  
• In hospi[INVESTIGATOR_66386] “medical device integration” in which data from physiologic monitors are sent 
directly to  the electronic health records, we will:  
• Validate that the medical device integration data in the electronic health record reflects the 
findings of  direct in -person observation described above  as the gold standard. 
 
3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 General Schema of Study Design  
This is a pragmatic,
23 prospective, non -randomized, single- arm feasibility pi[INVESTIGATOR_343030] (i.e. 
ward) level.  
This study does not directly involve making any changes to patient care – it only involves presenting 
data, guidelines, and evidence to clinical staff who make independent decisions about their own 
actions related to pulse oximetry monitoring in bronchiolitis. Any individual clinicians who do not wish 
   
   [ADDRESS_424821] with the electronic communications and may choose to not 
attend meetings where this intervention is discussed.  
On the Pragmatic- Explanatory Continuum,23 this study is highly pragmatic for the following 
reasons (see cited article for detailed explanation of domains):  
• Eligibility criteria: The same bronchiolitis patients who would likely be a candidate for the 
audit and feedback  intervention if it was  being provided in usual care are also eligible for this 
intervention since it is applied at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343031].  
• Recruitment:  The audit and feedback  intervention will be delivered to the same health care 
professionals who are involved in the decisions or actions surrounding the initiation or discontinuation of continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in usual care. 
• Setting:  The pi[INVESTIGATOR_343032].  
• Organization:  Given the highly pragmatic nature of this study, the intervention will be 
delivered into each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343033].  
• Flexibility in intervention delivery:  Consistent with the idea that interventions can be tailored 
to local context, we will allow for flexibility/adaptation/tailoring in the content and format of the educational materials and outreach sessions. Thus, the methodology of exactly how to deliver this intervention is not rigidly prescriptive in this protocol. In addition, it is possible that 
some sites will be performing concurrent quality improvement interventions targeting pulse 
oximetry overuse. We will seek to fully understand when and how any potential quality 
improvement interventions interact with this study but we will not restrict sites from performing separate improvement initiatives nor will we will regulate or oversee their concurrent quality improvement projects.  
• Flexibility in adherence to the intervention:  While we will monitor health care professionals’ 
engagement with the interventions and the resulting pulse oximetry use that results at the patient level, as in usual care, there are no special measures in place beyond what would 
occur in the course of a practice change in the usual care of bronchiolitis.  
3.2 Allocation to Treatment Groups and Blinding  
N/A: This is a single -arm study.  
3.[ADDRESS_424822] between 2- 4 months depending on the timing relative to the local 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_623] -dictated bronchiolitis season.  
The primary subjects are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717] . Secondary subjects are patients age 2 through 23 months 
with a primary diagnosis of bronchiolitis.  
3.3.1  Duration of Study Participation  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]: 2 -4 months.  
• Patients: minimum of 1 day, maximum of the duration of their entire hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (maximum 4 months; anticipated average of 1-3 days).  
3.3.2  Total Number of Study Sites/Total Number of Subjects Projec ted 
The study will be conducted in up to 10 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343009].  
Primary subjects exposed to the intervention (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]) : Since the intervention is occurring at a 
unit-wide level and we are not collecting any identifiers on these primary subjects, it is not possible to 
accurately measure the actual number of staff whose behavior could potentially have been impacted 
by [CONTACT_25234]. It also will not be possible to identify when hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343034]. In order to best estimate this number, we will “count” the 
   
   6 
involveme nt of 1 00 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343035]. Based on an average 
of 5 available units per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343036], we can estimate 10 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] * 5 units per 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] * 100 staff per unit = 5,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343037] , acknowledging that this number will not 
be completely accurate but is a reasonable estimate. When we report the “actual” number of primary 
exposed subjects involved for continuing reviews and study closure, we will report 100 * the total 
number of units involved in the study . 
Primary subjects completing the questionnaires (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33717]) : We will aim for 100 completed 
questionnaires per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] x 10 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] = 1,[ADDRESS_424823] total.  
Secondary subjects - Patients:  We project collecting data on a maximum of 300 unique bronchiolitis 
patients  per hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] * 10 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600] = 3,000 patients.

4 STUDY PROCEDURES  
4.1 Pre-intervention period  
• Implementation champi[INVESTIGATOR_343038], local teams formed  
• Local team members will meet with leadership on each potential unit; unit leadership will be 
given the opportunity to opt their unit out of the study for any reason.  
• Implementation champi[INVESTIGATOR_5458] & teams perform educational outreach sessions on participating units  
• describing current guidelines  
• summarizing the evidence behind the guidelines  
• discussing potential alternatives to continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for patients in whom guidelines do not advise continuous pulse oximetry  
• Distributi on/dissemination of educational materials (e.g. slide presentations,  posters,  flyers , 
videos ) to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343039] 
• materials collaboratively developed by [CONTACT_343079], w ith 
site-specific tailoring by [CONTACT_343080]  
4.2 Intervention period  
• Implementation teams will conduct data collection rounds  and supplemental chart review 
(see Section 5)  to determine continuous pulse oximetry status on bronchiolitis patients  not 
receiving supplemental oxygen or room air flow, targeting data collection at least twice  per 
week in order to acquire sufficient data for audit and feedback intervention. 
• If any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343040], the data collector may perform real -time inquiry if feasible , briefly asking about the 
indications for monitoring individual patients, which will be documented in the study database as field notes without documenting any of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343041]’s identifiers.  
• On a weekly basis, the data will be summarized in a dashboard and the dashboard along with the raw data will be returned to the site PI.  
• Local implementation team will then share that data in electronic and in-person settings 
appropriate and tailored to each site (e.g. email, safety huddles,
24,[ADDRESS_424825] systems) with key clinician stakeholders who order or manage continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for bronchiolitis patients. Data will be 
contextualized with (a) the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s prior performance, (b) other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ prior performance, (c) the current performance of other units in the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], (d) the current performance of other units in other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600].  
• Additional educational materials will be distributed and additional education/outreach sessions will be held by [CONTACT_343081] a frequency determined by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_343042].  
4.3 At conclusion of the intervention period 
• Administer questionnaire- based psychometrically valid measures to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343043], acceptability, appropriateness ,
26 and perceived safety of the audit and feedback  
strategy . 
 
5 STUDY EVALUATIONS AN D MEASUREMENTS  
5.1 Overview  
Data collection will be operationalized at sites during periodic in -person observational “rounds”  
during the intervention period.  During a data collection round, site investigators will first identify all 
   
   8 
patients currently admitted to their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s non-ICU pediatric wards with bronchiolitis by [CONTACT_343082]. They will then walk to the bedside of each eligible infant with bronchiolitis to confirm that supplemental oxygen and room air flow are off and 
determine the current continuous monitoring status (SpO

monitoring are poorly predictive of  actual monitoring status  (data from current 56 -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343045]) . Sites will transmit data  using REDCap, a secure research data 
management tool.28 At the conclusion of the intervention period, questionnaires  will be electronic ally 
distributed to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343046].  
5.2 Chart review  
5.2.1  Site investigators will provide the following contextual information about audit and 
feedback and educational outreach  delivery  events , using a framework previously 
described:29 
• Date of event  
• What type of session was held? (audit data review, educational outreach session, email, 
webinar, etc)

5.2.2  The following data elements will be abstracted from the chart and stored in the study 
database : 
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Admission date and time 
• Coded patient -admission ID – this is an identifier for each unique patient -admission to allow 
the data analysis to account for clustering of observations within individual patient -
admissions. This is not an actual patient identifier assigned by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]; it is a study -
specific coded identifier with the linkage master list document held by [CONTACT_343083] (no 
   
   9 
actual patient identifiers other than the dates listed here are transmitted to CHOP from other 
sites).  
• Unit name  
• Bed number  
• Patient age  
• Patien t sex  
• Patient race and ethnicity  
• Patient primary diagnosis and chronic conditions  
• Forms of chronic neurologic impairment (e.g. static encephalopathy, cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, spi[INVESTIGATOR_113163], epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]/seizure disorder, hypotonia, other form of neurologi c 
impairment)  
• Technology dependence (e.g. short -term feeding tube, long- term feeding tube, central 
venous line, renal dialysis)  
• History of apnea or cyanosis during this illness  
• History of ICU stay earlier in this admission  
• Patient gestational age  
• How long have they been off respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (e.g. supplemental oxygen or room air flow), according to the chart? 
• Are any pulse oximetry measurements documented in the chart since the patient has been off respi[INVESTIGATOR_1413] (e.g. supplemental oxygen or room air  flow)? 
• Do they have an active continuous pulse oximetry monitoring order in the chart right now?  
• Do they have an active continuous electrocardiographic/cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_343049]?  
• For hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343050]:  
• Is there at least 1 pulse oximetry data point visible in the chart from the same minute that 
rounds occurred?  
• Is there at least 1 pulse oximetry data point visible in the chart for each of the 15 minutes 
preceding when rounds occurred?  
• Is there at least 1 pulse oximetry data point visible in the chart for each of the 15 minutes 
following when rounds occurred?  
5.2.3  The following data elements will be abstracted from the chart an d stored in the 
individual site’s  separate master list alongside the coded ID, admission date, and data 
collection rounds date but NOT entered into the study database  and NOT transmitted 
outside of the institution where the patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] : 
• Patient  first name  
• Patient last name  
• Patient medical record number  
• Patient admission /account number (a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -specific identifier in the EHR that identifies 
the specific admission)  
   
   10 
5.3 Bedside visual observation “rounds”  
• Date and time rounds occurred at this patient’s bedside (the exact time, to the minute, using 
the time displayed on the bedside monitor as the time of record)  
• Based on observing the patient at the bedside, are they currently receiving any respi[INVESTIGATOR_81407] (e.g. supplemental oxygen or nasal cannula flow)?  
• Are they being continuously pulse oximetry monitored right now based on bedside observation?  
• Are they being continuously electrocardiographically/cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_343051] (using chest leads to measure heart rate, heart rhythm, and/or respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) right now based on bedside observation?  
• Field notes based on brief real time inquiry of health care professionals, if performed, regarding why the patient is continuously monitored  
 
5.3.[ADDRESS_424828] in protecting the health and safety of data collection staff, we will 
permit  the following modifications to the observational rounds for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343052]:  
• The data collector may obtain the respi[INVESTIGATOR_343053], so no room entry is required  
• The data collector may obtain the continuous monitoring status by [CONTACT_15482], so no room entry is required: 
o Viewing the monitor from outside the patient room (e.g. through a door)  
o Viewing the monitor from a central station  
o Viewing the monitor using an existing remote continuous monitor viewing 
platform used by [CONTACT_343084][INVESTIGATOR_343054] (e.g. AirStrip)  
The method used for determining respi[INVESTIGATOR_343055].  
 
5.4 Staff questionnaires (see appendix for instrument)  
5.4.1  Site PIs will submit to CHOP for recruitment  
• Email addresses of potential health professional subjects  
5.4.2  The questionnaires will include the following elements:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  
• Unit(s) where person worked during the intervention period  
• Profession (nurse, attending physician, etc.) 
• Did the person care for any patients with bronchiolitis on an intervention unit during the 
intervention period?  
• Gender, race, ethnicity of subject completing the questionnaire  
• Acceptabili ty of Intervention Measure (AIM) 
• Intervention Appropriateness Measure (IAM)  
• Feasibility of Intervention Measure (FIM)  
   
   11 
• Supplemental items (see appendix)  
Please note that we may make minor changes to the items included in the questionnaire in the 
months between initial IRB submission and questionnaire administration based on ongoing 
discussion with the investigative team and site PIs. As long as the changes do not represent major 
changes in scope, we will not submit revised versions of the questionnaire t o the IRB.  
 
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
This is a feasibility study preparatory to a clinical trial. Therefore, there is minimal emphasis on 
statistical power.  
6.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoints are the resulting scores on the questionnaire measures above. 
6.2 Secondary Endpoints  
Secondary endpoints will include the following:  
• Continuous pulse oximetry use rates in children with bronchiolitis who are not requiring 
supplemental oxygen administration.  
• The test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive 
value) of the electronic health record data from the medical monitoring device for actual monitoring at the bedside in bronchiolitis  
6.3 Statistical Methods  
6.3.1  Questionnaire- based methods (AIM, IAM, FIM)  
We will generate average scores for each item and for each measure, stratified by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_343056] (e.g. nurse, physician).  
6.3.2  Pulse oximetry use rates  
We will calculate the overall rate of SpO 2 monitoring overuse within each hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The rate 
numerator  is the number of patients with bronchiolitis who are breathing room air (not requiring any 
supplemental oxygen) and are continuously SpO 2-monitored . The rate denominator is the total 
number of patients with bronchiolitis who are breathing room air. We will stratify these rates by [CONTACT_343085] (e.g. time of day, amount of time off supplemental oxygen).  
6.3.[ADDRESS_424829] 90% power to reject the 
null hypothesis response of “Neither agree nor disagree” (3.0) assuming a mean response of “Agree” 
(4.0), alpha=.05, standard deviation=3. A total of 73 responses would provide 80% power to detect the above conditions.  
 
7 SAFETY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Clinical Adverse Events 
Clinical adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. See details in section 8.4.1 
describing the proactive adverse event surveillance plan.  
   
   12 
7.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
Since the study procedures are not greater than minimal risk, SAEs are not expected. If any 
unanticipated problems related to the research involving risks to subjects or others happen during 
the course of this study (including SAEs) , they will be reported to the IRB in accordance with CHOP 
IRB SOP 408:  Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects. AEs that are not serious but that 
are notable and could involve risks to subjects will be summarized in narrative or other format and submitted to the IRB at the time of continuing review.  
 
8 STUDY ADMINI STRATION  
8.1 Treatment Assignment Methods  
This is a single arm study without randomization or blinding.  
8.2 Data Collection and Management  
8.2.1  Data sources 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Chart review  
Data from chart review will be extracted from the medical record system used at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93966]. 
This may include electronic medical records (e.g. the Epic system at CHOP) or paper medical 
records.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Bedside visual observation “rounds”  
Data will be obtained by [CONTACT_343086][INVESTIGATOR_343057].  See details of COVID -19 modifications in 
Section 5.3.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Staff questionnaires  
• As listed in Sections [ADDRESS_424830] privacy. The Investigator and other site personnel will not 
use such data and records for any purpose other than conducting the study.  
The only PHI element s that documented in the study database are the admission date and the date 
the data collection rounds occurred (which by [CONTACT_343087] a date during the patient’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). Thus this is a limited dataset . 
The dataset is also coded to decrease the risk of breach of confidentiality . A patient -admission ID 
number  not otherwise associated with the individual (not derived from any element of PHI) will be 
generated by [CONTACT_343088]. This is an identifier for each unique patient -admission to allow the data 
analysis to account for clustering of observations within individual patient -admissions. This is not an 
actual patient identifier assigned by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_307]; it is a study -specific coded identifier with the linkage 
master list document held by [CONTACT_343083] (no PHI other than the dates listed above are 
transmitted to CHOP from other sites).  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343058] s. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343059]/approved by [CONTACT_1385]. The master list containing the key to 
decipher the coded dataset will be deleted/ destroyed at the earliest possible date that complies with 
individual hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]’ retention of records policies.  
Questionnaire data will not contain any PHI.  
   
   [ADDRESS_424831] obtaining IRB approval. The investigator 
will obtain a data use agreement between provider (the PI) and any recipi[INVESTIGATOR_5772] (including 
others at CHOP) before sharing a limited dataset (dates and zip codes).  
8.4 Regulatory and Ethical Considerations  
8.4.1  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan 
The risks of this study are minimal as it involves an intervention intended to align clinical practice with established guidelines and recommendations for quality bronchiolitis care. The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_343060]. The primary risk is breach of privacy and 
confidentiality.  We will also perform proactive surveillance for threats to patient safety. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plan for mitigating and monitoring risk of privacy and confidentiality breaches  
CHOP’s instance of REDCap will be used for all data collection and management in this study, including data collection performed at non- CHOP sites. For feasibility reasons, study sites will be 
permitted to use a temporary paper data collection worksheet as long as it is stored in a locked file cabinet and destroyed after abstraction into REDCap. Handling of the master list is described in the above section.  
After data collection, exported data for analysis will take place only on computers that meet CHOP IT standards for encryption and password protection as outlined in CH OP IT SOP A -3-6. Data will be 
stored on the CHOP research SAN and/or other secure servers maintained by [CONTACT_343089]. Only investigators and study staff approved by [CONTACT_343090].  
In accordance with the current CHOP Retention of Records Policy A -3-[ADDRESS_424832] retention requirements. For this reason, we will:  
1. Provide all data submitted to CHOP back to the Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_343061] a CHOP IT approved secure method, allowing each site to meet local record retention requirements. We will not submit Site-Specific Amendments describing each site’s record retention requirement.  
2. Support other site- specific record retention or local IRB policy exceptions (such as a local 
requirement to retain data collection worksheets after the data are abstracted into REDCap) 
that may differ from what we have written above as long as they are described in the Site 
Survey or a Site- Specific Amendment.  
The CHOP PI [INVESTIGATOR_343062], the accuracy and security of the data, and 
will ensure subject confidentiality and safety.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Plan for proactive surveillance for threats to patient safety  
In this study, we will regularly evaluate the safety of the intervention, since the intervention may lead to less intensive monitoring for some bronchiolitis patients. In order to monitor for threats to safety, 
we will:  
• M onitor for code blue team activations  and rapid response team / medical emergency team / 
critical assessment team activations in all bronchiolitis patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343063].  This includes patients who were not 
subjects of data col lection, because the intervention is applied at the unit level and could 
impact the care of patients with bronchiolitis even if they are not reviewed during data collection rounds.  
• Investigators will review the chart of each patient meeting the above criteria to determine if 
the patient was unmonitored at the time of the event that led to the activation.  
• Events meeting the activation criteria in which the patient was unmonitored at the time of the event that led to the activation will be considered study adverse events, whether or not they 
   
   14 
are related to the research intervention, and be documented in research records as meeting 
those criteria. 
• Investigators will then determine, through chart review and speaking with staff present at the 
time of the event, if available,  if the event was at least possibly related to the study  
intervention, defined as “there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459].” 
• Investigators will follow the CHOP IRB’s Unanticipated Problems Decision Tree (https://irb.research.chop.edu/unanticipated- problems ) in order to determine whether the 
Adverse Event requires prompt reporting to the IRB or should be filed with the next continuing review.  
• Adverse Events that meet the definition of Unanticipated Problem Involving Risks to 
Subjects will be reported promptly to the IRB  and the study will be suspended pending 
review of the event by [CONTACT_1201]. Following the review, we will work with the IRB and staff from the inpatient units to determine if the study should be modified to improve the safety of 
patients.  
• Sites other than CHOP will follow their IRB’s internal reporting requirements, if they differ 
from the procedures outlined above.  
 
8.4.2  Risk Assessment  
Risks are not greater than minimal in this study. The primary risk is breach of privacy and confidentiality. Less likely are threats to patient safety. These risks will be minimized as described 
above.  
Given that there are national recommendations from Choosing Wisely and the AAP that support using less continuous monitoring in stable bronchiolitis, this study is not introducing any additional risk than would be introduced if clinical leaders initiated efforts into routine clinical care to align their 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_600]’ practice with the existing national guidelines. The intervention simply aims to measure the 
feasibility of reveal ing how hospi[INVESTIGATOR_343064], and providing  information/education on the existing recommendations. All decisions about 
changes to monitoring are made by [CONTACT_343091], not the researchers.  
8.4.3  Potential Benefits of Trial Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Direct  
Patients, their families, and the health professionals caring for them have the potential to benefit from 
higher quality, guideline -concordant health care. This may produce fewer monitor alarms, and 
thereby [CONTACT_343092], wake patients from sleep, or cause unnecessary anxiety in patients and their loved ones. The patients also may have a lower risk of harm due to a reduction in the probability of 
the clinicians caring for them experiencing the alarm fatigue that can result from high alarm  rates. 
Patients may also benefit by [CONTACT_343093][INVESTIGATOR_343065].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Indirect 
The study outlined in this proposal will generate important knowledge that will advance (a) the science of audit and feedback  and (b) plans for a future large- scale cluster -randomized trial of this 
intervention.  
8.4.[ADDRESS_424833].  
   
   15 
8.5 Recruitment Strategy  
The pragmatic approach to recruitment of health care professionals and patients for the intervention 
has been described in previous sections.  
For the data collection in -person observational rounds, site investigators will identify all patients 
currently  admitted to their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s non- ICU pediatric wards with bronchiolitis by [CONTACT_343094]. Eligibility screening does not involve recording any data until the patient is determined to be eligible and is enrolled.  
For the primary objective, measuring feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness using the validated questionnaire instruments, site PIs will distribute the questionnaire to the following health 
care professional types who worked on an intervention unit in a role involving the care of patients 
with bronchiolitis during the intervention period:  
• Attending physicians  
• Resident physicians  
• Nurses  
• Nursing assistants  
• Physician assistants  
• Respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175]  
• Other relevant staff (e.g. if a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]’s bronchiolitis care team includes staff who educate 
parents about their child’s condition prior to discharge, we would include them here)  
 
Questionnaires  will be distributed in paper and electronic formats. Paper questionnaires will be 
distributed during unit -based events such as safety huddles,
24,[ADDRESS_424834] of email addresses of these 
potential subjects to CHOP study leadership, who will enter these into the CHOP -based REDCap 
survey distribution system.  
8.6 Informed Consent/Assent and HIPAA Authorization 
8.6.1  Informed consent and HIPAA for the primary measure (questionnaires)  
Cons ent will be obtained for the questionnaires administered to health care professional; we request 
waiver of documentation.  The waiver is appropriate under §46.117(c)(ii): the research presents no 
more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is 
normally required outside of the research context.  
The first section of the questionnaire will include the required elements of consent and a statement 
that completion of the questionnaire indicates willingness and consent  to participate. Specific 
language is included in the Appendix . HIPAA Authorization is not necessary for the questionnaire 
portion of the study; email addresses of health care professionals are being collected in order to 
distribute but are not considered PHI because they do not relate to the health of an individual.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_424835] involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research 
   
   16 
context.  Any health care professional can opt out of study participation at any time simply by [CONTACT_343095] -related acti vities.  
The research meets the criteria of 45 CFR 46.116(d), as illustrated below:  
(1) Risks are not greater than minimal in this study. The primary risk is breach of privacy and 
confidentiality. The risk will be minimized by [CONTACT_9377][INVESTIGATOR_343066]. The investigators will not use data or 
records for any purpose other than conducting the study. Please see Section 8.3 for additional details.  
(2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects because PHI will only be accessed by [CONTACT_343096], and we are collecting a limited, coded dataset to minimize risk of PHI exposure . 
(3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration. The intent is to 
obtain a large, unbiased sample of patients with bronchiolitis to obtain insights on hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -level 
practices and systems of care related to pulse oximetry  monitoring in bronchiolitis. The research 
could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration, as it may not be feasible to locate and contact [CONTACT_343097]. If we fail to obtain all of the data due to families who cannot be located/contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], this will 
threaten the statistical outcome, bias the sample, prohibit conclusions to be drawn or alter the 
sample such that conclusions would be skewed.   
(4) There will not be any pertinent patient -level information that would benefit the patient directly 
after participation so none of the subjects will be provided with additional information after 
participation.  
8.6.[ADDRESS_424836] a waiver of HIPAA Authorization. The study presents no more than minimal risk to the 
privacy of individuals. The research meets the criteria of 45 CFR 46.116(d), as illustrated below:  
 (A) The use or disclosure of protected health information involves no more than a 
minimal risk to the privacy of individuals, based on, at least, the presence of the following element s:  
(1) An adequate plan to protect the identifiers from improper use and disclosure;  
• We have provided an adequate plan to protect identifiers from improper use and disclosure above.  
(2) An adequate plan to destroy the identifiers at the earliest opportunity consistent 
with conduct of the research, unless there is a health or research justification for retaining the identifiers or such retention is otherwise required by [CONTACT_2371]; and  
• We have provided a plan to destroy the identifiers, including those in the master list,  at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the 
research that is also consistent with institutional record retention policies, described above.  
(3) Adequate written assurances that the protected health information will not be 
reused or disclosed to any other person or entity, except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research project, or for other research for which the use or disclosu re of protected health information would be permitted by [CONTACT_201815];  
• Protected health information will not be reused or disclosed to any other 
entity except as required by [CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research 
   
   [ADDRESS_424837], or for other research for which the use or disclosure of protected 
health information would be permitted by [CONTACT_201815].  
(B) The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration; and  
• The research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver as described above in waiver of consent  request . 
(C) The research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the protected health information.  
• The research could not practicably be conducted without access to and 
use of protected health information needed to track patients over time 
and to track the dates of admission and data collection at each site during the bronchiolitis season.

Up to half of all cancer related deaths are preventable via evidence-based lifestyle changes such as increasing physical
activity, enhancing nutrition, and reducing obesity.(1-3) Physical inactivity is a specific modifiable risk factor for breast
and colon cancer.(4) Rates of physical inactivity are lower in rural communities as compared to their urban and suburban
counterparts.(5) Nearly one-third of Missouri’s population lives in rural counties,(6) and the “Bootheel” region suffers
from a disproportionately high rate of cancer, in addition to physical inactivity and obesity.(7,8)
The purpose of the present study is to determine if a multilevel intervention (consisting of community events at local
walking trails, formation of walking groups, and text messaging) will increase physical activity among rural residents.
Intervention community members will receive the multilevel intervention while control communities will not. In the
intervention communities, it is preferable for all participants to partake in all aspects of the intervention; however, not
every person will partake in every level. We will create a dose-response variable hypothesizing participants who take
part in all aspects of the intervention (i.e., attend walking events, takes part in walking groups, and receives text
messages) will increase their physical activity more than people who engage in less of the intervention and those in
control communities. As a part of the walking group formation in intervention sites, we will be utilizing the Stanford
Healthy Neighborhood Discovery Tool application in order to receive feedback from participants related to the walking
trails in their towns.
1.4 Specify your research question(s), study aims or hypotheses:
Test the independent and moderating effects of a multilevel intervention and the community environment on physical
activity among rural residents.
1.5 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project:
Key informant interviews were conducted in the intervention communities with three groups of people, walking trail
users, walking trail non users, and stakeholders. We received feedback on the best methods by [CONTACT_59906]. Further, participants indicated to us their willingness to partake in future aspects of
the study. Walking trail users and walking trail non users may be asked to participate as participants, while
stakeholders may be asked to partake in a coalition to partner in increasing physical activity in rural southeast
Missouri.

1.22 Provide a summary of the analysis methods you will use, including, if applicable, the data points or outcomes you
will analyze.
The intervention is at the community, interpersonal, and intrapersonal levels, and the activity environment is
classified at the individual level. The basic model for the individual level analysis is: Yjk = αj + βIj + γXj + ηZjk + θ
Ij*Ejk + εjk; where Yjk is the change in physical activity for subject k in jth community (j = 1,2…12), I = 1 if
intervention and 0 otherwise, X = a vector of community level covariates, Z = a vector of individual level covariates
(including Ejk individual level of activity environment), and Ij*Ejk = intervention-by-environment interaction. The
parameter αj is the random intercept, β is the main effect for intervention, and θ is the interaction effect. In this
model, β is the expected difference in the physical activity level between intervention and control among those
whose physical activity is mainly indoor, and (θ + β) is the expected difference in the physical activity level between
intervention and control among those whose physical activity is mainly in the natural environment. Both main and

https://myirb.wusm.wustl.edu/summary/projects.page?mode=pf&OID=77913733 6/8interaction effects are adjusted for community level and individual level covariates. The primary analyses will be
conducted at the end of 1 and 2 year follow-up. In these analyses, baseline physical activity level will be used as one
of covariates.
1.23 Provide the rationale or power analysis to support the number of participants proposed to complete this study.
This study uses a paired, group-randomized design. By [CONTACT_59909], we will balance potential community-
level confounding factors (e.g., community size, poverty level) with a gain in the statistical power [9,10]. Based on
the literature, we estimated accelerometer-measured MVPA in the control group at 42.5 minutes per week (m/w).[9]
In the intervention group, we assume a 16% increase (42.5*1.16 = 49.3), based on a recent meta-analysis [11]. We
used a much larger SD of 16 rather than that reported (6.2) to ensure a sufficient sample size both for testing the
intervention effect and for testing the intervention-by-environment interaction (moderation) effect. We assumed ICC
estimates in the range of 0.01-0.03, based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_59899] [12-18]. With 12
communities and an average of 48 study subjects in each (a total of 576 subjects for accelerometry), the study has
power >90% with 2-sided α = 5% to detect the mean difference in MVP A between the control (42.5) and
intervention (49.3) groups, using Donner’s method [19]. For intervention-by-environment interaction, we assume in
the natural environment, the intervention and control difference is 57 m/w versus 44 m/w, and in the indoor
environment, the difference is 43 m/w versus 41 m/w. Estimates of interaction are based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_59900] [20]. With a common SD in each of four subgroups = 10, we ha ve 84% power to detect a significant
interaction using factorial analysis of variance methods (F-test) adjusting for clustering (ICC = 0.03). Our simulation
using two-level mixed effect models also indicates the power to detect the assumed interaction effect >90%. Our
sample size is determined for accelerometry subjects at the end of Year 2. With a yearly follow-up rate of 80%,
which is achievable given our previous work, we need to enroll 576/0.64 = 900 at baseline for accelerometry. For
telephone survey subjects, we need to enroll 900/0.75 = 1,[ADDRESS_64815] be stored for use in future research studies?

5 Purpose of the Statistical Analysis Plan 
The purpose of this Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) is to document technical and detailed 
specifications for analyses of data collected for protocol MS200527-0081 dated 02 September 2016 (version 3.0). The SAP is based upon Section 8 (Statistics) of the trial protocol and is prepared in compliance with Internat ional Council for Harmonisation E9.  
The first version (version 1.0) of the SAP includes details for the primary and final statistical 
analyses, planned for the end of 12 weeks treatment and for the end of study, respectively.  
Results of the analyses described in this SA P will be included in the Clinical Study Report 
(CSR). Additionally, the planned analyses identif ied in this SAP will be included in regulatory 
submissions or future manuscripts. Any post-hoc, or unplanned analyses performed to provide results for inclusion in the CSR but not identi fied in this prospective SAP will be clearly 
identified in the CSR. 
 
The final clinical database cannot be locked until the final SAP has been approved and signed.

Exploratory objectives :  
 
  
Open-label extension objectives : 
To evaluate the on-going safety and efficacy of M2951 in an open-label extension with 
treatment at 50 mg bid for an additional 6 months.  
Methodology: This is a Phase IIa randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 
approximately 64 modified intent-to-treat (mITT) subjects [ADDRESS_57416] participation is ap proximately between 5 months (20 weeks) to 
11 months (46 weeks), which includes: 
• Screening: 28 days (4 weeks) 
• Treatment: 84 days (12 weeks) 
• Optional 6-month open-label extension period (26 weeks)  
• Safety Follow-Up: 28 days (4 weeks)  
Screening will occur over Day -28 to -1 (Visit 1), during which time all Screening 
assessments must be completed and reviewed.  
On Day 1 (Visit 2), after confirmation of elig ibility, assessment of RA disease activity and 
vital signs, and obtaining of required blood a nd urine samples, subjec ts will be randomly 
assigned 1:[ADDRESS_57417] (IMP) at a set time each day 
(± 2 hours). Subjects must take their daily dose more than 1 hour prior to a meal or snack or more than 2 hours after a meal or snack. Clear fluids are allowed at any time. On trial visit days, the IMP will be administered during the trial visit, after trial visit procedures (other than 
PK/PD sampling) are completed. 
Subjects will have trial visits weekly for the first 3 weeks of treatment; bi-weekly up until 
8 weeks of treatment; a final On-Treatment Vis it on Day 85, and then return for 1 Follow-Up 
Visit approximately 28 days (4 weeks) after the last dose of IMP. 
After completing the 12-week treatment period, subjects will be offered the opportunity to 
participate in an optional 6-month open-label extension period where all subjects will receive M2951. For subjects who choose to participate in the optional extension period, the duration of participation will last a to tal of approximately 11 months.  CCI

superiority of M2951+MTX to placebo + MTX for the primary endpoint at the 1-sided 10% 
level. Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with M2951 or placebo through a 
central randomization process by [CONTACT_53804] (IWRS).  
Approximately 64 subjects will be randomized under the assumption of a 6.25% drop-out 
rate.  
There will be 3 analyses: (1) an interim analysis (IA), triggered when subjects from the first 
50% of the planned enrollment have reached Day [ADDRESS_57424] discontinued treatment prior to Day 29, (2) a primary analysis, triggered

 when 100% of subjects enrolled have reached Day [ADDRESS_57425] discontinued 
treatment prior to Day 85, and (3) a final analys is, triggered when 100% of subjects enrolled 
complete all study parts, or discontinue prematurely from study. 
The percent change in hsCRP fro m Baseline to Day 29 will be the key endpoint evaluated at 
the IA. Point estimate and confidence interval (CI) estimates of the Day 29 hsCRP change from Baseline difference, comparing the 2 treatment groups, will be estimated for use in 
internal decision making. In addition, the ch ange in DAS28-hsCRP from Baseline to Day 29 
will be evaluated using the same approach as used for change in hsCRP. The IA will not be used to alter the design of the trial. No  adjustment will be made to the 1-sided Į of 10% to be 
used in the primary analysis at the end of the first treatment period (12 weeks).  
The Day 85 ACR20 proportion and a 2-sided 80% CI will be provided for each treatment 
group. The difference ( ǻ) in 12-week ACR20 proportions between M2951+MTX and 
placebo + MTX, and a 2 sided 80% CI for ǻ, based on the “corrected Miettinen-Nurminen” 
method will be provided. The primary analysis will be based on the mITT Analysis Set using Last Observation Carried Forward for imputation of missing values and will reject the null 
hypothesis (H0): ǻ  [ADDRESS_57426] as the Day 85 
ACR20 proportions. 
Safety data will be listed and summarized using descriptive statistics. 
In addition, efficacy and safety data collected during the open-label extension period will be 
summarized. 
Pharmacokinetics 
M2951 concentrations and PK parameters will be listed and summarized by [CONTACT_53805].  Pharmacodynamics 
Data on immunoglobulin levels, , and B cell numbers and subsets will be 
summarized in tabular and/or graphic format, as appropriate to the data. Potential PK/PD correlations may be explored and reported separately. 
7 Sample Size/Randomization 
The trial is powered to demonstrate superiority of M2951 + MTX to placebo + MTX in ACR20 
response proportion after [ADDRESS_57427] of the null hypothesis H0: ǻ  0 
based on the 2-sided 80% confidence interval (CI) for ǻ, where ǻ is the difference in Week 12 
ACR20 response proportion comparing the 2 treatm ent groups. The null hypothesis H0 will be 
rejected if the lower limit of the 2-sided 80% CI  exceeds zero. It is assumed that the Week 12 
ACR20 response proportion in the placebo + MTX treatment group is 0.21 (1), and that the 
difference in Week 12 ACR20 response proportions between the 2 treatment groups under the alternative hypothesis H1: ǻ > 0 is ǻ = 0.25 (1, 2). 
If the response proportions in the 2 treatment groups are 0.46 and 0.21, respectively, under the 
alternative hypothesis, then a sample size of approximately 60 mITT subjects randomized 1:1, 
M2951+MTX:placebo+MTX, provides 80.2% power to demonstrate superiority at the 1-sided CCI

 10% significance level. The power calculation is based on a simulation of the 2-sided 80% CI for 
ǻ estimated using the “corrected Miettinen-Nurminen” method (3) conducted in R Cran software 
version 2.15.2 using the function PropCIs::diffscoreci (version 0.2 5, 2015).  
A total of approximately 64 subjects will be randomized to provide 60 mITT subjects in the 
presence of a 6.25% dropout rate. 
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a blinded fashion by [CONTACT_53806] a ratio of 1:1 to M2951 
dose of 50 mg bid + MTX or placebo + MTX,  
 
[ADDRESS_57428] of the trial; no additional risk 
minimization measures are proposed. IDMC meetings will take place every 4 months or as requested by [CONTACT_53807]. Details of the statistical analyses of the IDMC 
are provided in the IDMC/IA SAP and the IDMC charter. 
8.2 Interim Analysis 
An IA will be conducted with the percent chan ge in hsCRP from Baseline to Day 29 as key 
endpoint evaluated at the IA. Details of the statistical analyses of the IA are provided in the IDMC/IA SAP.

 9 Changes to the Planned Analyses in the Clinical Trial 
Protocol 
Computation of point estimates and CIs of differences from baseline in hsCRP and Disease 
Activity Score based on 28 joints and high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (DAS28-hsCRP)  
Details were added to complete the planned analysis of hsCRP and DAS28-hsCRP.  
In the SAP, it has been further specified that: 
• the differences in mean changes between M2 951+MTX and Placebo+MTX will be considered 
for hsCRP and DAS28-hsCRP, along with the 2-sided 80% CI for the difference  
• the estimates and the CI limits will be derive d using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) 
model with baseline as a covariate and treatment group as an independent variable 
• Percent Change From Baseline (CFB) of hsCRP will be provided as summary statistics 
Missing hsCRP and DAS28-hsCRP imputation 
Missing hsCRP values and DAS28-hsCRP scores will be imputed for the primary and final 
analyses:  
• Missing hsCRP values will be imputed using th e same rule used for the analysis of the 
primary endpoint, ie, post-baseline Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) 
• Missing components of DAS28-hsCRP will be imputed using the same rule as the primary 
endpoint, i.e., post-baseline Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) 
Imputation of hsCRP and DAS28-hsCRP is not applicable for open-label extension (OLE) 
period, only for 12-week treatment period. 
 
 
   
 
 
OLE PD endpoints 
The Schedule of Assessments table in protocol specifies immunoglobulin and B cells and 
subtypes to be collected during the optional OLE period.  A description of the analysis of these data is missing from the “Endpoints for Open-l abel Extension” section of the protocol. A 
separate analysis set has been added here in Section 10.2. 
CTCAE Grades for Relevant Laboratory Parameters 
The Grade [ADDRESS_57430], all laboratory abnormalities will be graded as specified in CTCAE, version 4.03; Table 3 of the protocol will not be used. CCI

planned enrollment (ie 32 subjects) have reached Day [ADDRESS_57432] discontinued treatment prior to Day 29. The trigger has been updated and the change from 
protocol is detailed in IDMC/IA SAP. 
 
OLE extension endpoints 
For the final analysis, in addition to the ACR50 and ACR70, the ACR20 will be also analyzed as 
an open-label extension endpoint. 
 
OLE mITT definition 
The definition of OLE mITT set has been updated. It will include all subjects who received at 
least [ADDRESS_57433] the 
completeness, accuracy, and/or reliability of the study data or that might significantly affect a 
subject's rights, safety, or well-being.  
The following important deviations will be identified and confirmed prior to or at the Data 
Review Meeting, which will occur before the database lock. The outcome of the Data Review 
Meeting will document the important protocol deviations as well as the finalization of the 
analysis population in a memo.  
• Subjects that are dosed on the study despi[INVESTIGATOR_53796] 
• Subjects that develop withdrawal criteria whilst on the study but are not withdrawn 
• Subjects that receive the wrong treatment or an incorrect dose 
• Subjects that receive an excluded concomitant medication 
• Deviation from Good Clinical Practice

 • Inclusion and exclusion criteria violations 
• Other violations/events that may have a relevant influence on the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis (eg, adverse events (AEs), vomiting, 
sample processing errors, inaccurate dosing, etc.) 
Any important protocol deviations that lead to the exclusion of a subject from an analysis set will 
be considered clinically important (see Section 10.2 ). 
All important protocol deviations should be documented in Clinical Data Interchange Standards 
Consortium Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) (or Analysis Data Model (ADaM) for those 
derived by [CONTACT_53808]) whether identified through sites monitoring, medical review and/or 
programming based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria presented in the protocol. Important 
protocol deviations to be identified by [CONTACT_53809] 3 . 
10.2 Definition of Analysis Sets and Subgroups 
Screening Analysis Set (SCR) 
The SCR includes all subjects who signed the informed consent.  
Safety Analysis Set (SAF) 
The SAF will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of M2951 or placebo. The SAF 
will be used for all demographic/baseline characteristics and safety analyses.  
 
Analyses performed on the SAF will consider subjects as treated. Subjects will be allocated to 
active arm if at least one dose of M2951 was taken during first 12-week treatment period. 
The OLE SAF will include all subjects who received at least [ADDRESS_57434] 1 available efficacy evaluation (ACR components, ESR, 
anti-CCP, RF) at a time point after first dose in OLE period. The OLE mITT Analysis Set will be 
used for the analysis of efficacy endpoints at the time of the final analysis.

11 General Specifications for Statistical Analyses 
All statistical analyses will be performed by . 
Treatment groups and IMP: 
Treatment groups are defined as placebo + MTX and M2951 + MTX groups, except for the 
analyses including both the first 12-week treatment period and OLE period data, which will be summarized according to treatment groups ‘Placebo/M2951 + MTX’ and ‘M2951 + MTX’. Unless otherwise indicated, all analyses will be  presented separately for the two treatment 
groups. The IMPs are placebo and M2951. 
Presentation of Tables/Figures 
For the primary analysis at the end of first 12-week treatment period, drug code will be broken 
and tables and figures will be produced using true treatment groups and their true labels (ie, ‘Placebo’, ‘M2951 50 mg BID’). For the final analysis, tables and figures will be produced using true treatment groups and the following labels: ‘Placebo/M2951 50 mg BID’ and ‘M2951 50 mg BID/M2951 50 mg BID’.  
Tables and figures will be sorted by [CONTACT_1570] (in order of ‘Placebo’ and ‘M2951 50 mg 
BID’, or ‘Placebo/M2951 50 mg BID’ and ‘M2951 50 mg BID/M2951 50 mg BID’ for final analysis) and chronological scheduled time point (where applicable).  
Presentation of Listings: 
All data recorded during the trial will be presented in individual data listings
. All listings are 
sorted by [CONTACT_1570] (in order of ‘Placebo’ and ‘M2951 50 mg BID’, or ‘Placebo/M2951 50 mg BID’ and ‘M2951 50 mg BID/M2951 50 mg BID’ for final analysis), subject, and scheduled time point (where applicable), if not otherwise stated.   [COMPANY_003]

 Data handling for the planned analysis: 
For the primary analysis, data will be handled as follows:  
• Data from OLE, or safety follow-up posterior to OLE, will be excluded from the primary 
analysis. This exclusion will be performed at the ADaM level; no selection will be 
performed, neither at the data management level, nor at the SDTM level.  
• As the database lock for the primary analysis will be based on data up to and including 
the last patient’s last dose of IMP (LPLD) during 12-Week treatment period, all data 
from screening to LPLD during the 12-Week treatment period for all subjects will be 
locked and available in the database for the primary analysis. 
• A cut-off date will be applied at the SDTM level: all data posterior to LPLD during 12-
Week treatment period will be removed from the database. Details on the implementation 
of this cut-off date are available in the document named SDTM Cut-off date 
implementation rules_BTKi(M2951)-Compound_v2.0.docx  
• For all subjects, data during the 12-week treatment period up to and including the LPLD 
will be included for the primary analysis except for the safety follow-up data. All safety 
follow-up data will be reported for the mITT population at the final analysis stage.  
• Data selection for the primary and final analyses will be identified at the ADaM level 
first before any statistical calculations can start. Therefore, the data handlings described 
in all tables in the following sections of this SAP will depend on data selected in the 
ADaM level. 
 
For the final analysis, data will be presented on subjects who agreed to participate in OLE.  
Presentation of continuous and qualitative variables: 
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, ie  
• number of subjects (N) 
• number and percentage of non-missing values 
• number and percentage of missing values  
• mean, standard deviation (SD) 
• median, 25th Percentile - 75th Percentile (Q1-Q3) 
• minimum and maximum 
For both continuous and qualitative variables, percentages such as 0% or 100% should be 
reported with the same format used for the column, together with the count of observations. For 
example, if the count of observations is zero, then display ‘0 (  0.0)’; if the count of observations 
represents 100%,  then display ‘xx (100.0)’. 
Qualitative variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_33335].  Unless otherwise stated, 
the calculation of proportions will be based on the number of subjects in the analysis set of 
interest. Therefore counts of missing observations will be included in the denominator and 
presented as a separate category.

I N F O R M A T I O N 26/[ADDRESS_57437] is still in the trial at the time-point but with missing data, it should be 
counted in the number of missing observations.   
Pharmacodynamic endpoints will be reported as descri bed above for presentation of continuous 
and qualitative variables. 
Specific rules for PK concentrations and PK parameters  
Plasma concentrations of M2951 will be presented descriptively by [CONTACT_53812] (N), number of observations (n), 
mean, SD, coefficient of variation (CV%) median, minimum, and maximum. The below limit of 
quantification (BLQ) PK concentration values will be set to zero prior to computing descriptive 
statistics of PK concentrations. Missing concentrations will be omitted from the calculation of 
descriptive statistics. 
Individual plasma and mean concentration-time plots will be provided using a linear and semi-
logarithmic scale. 
Descriptive statistics for PK parameters (see Section 16.3.2 for calculations) will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_53813] (N, n, arithmetic mean, SD of the arithmetic mean, CV%, median, minimum, 
maximum geometric mean [GeoMean], geometric coefficient of variation [GeoCV%], and the 
95% CI for the GeoMean). For t max, only n, minimum, median, and maximum will be reported. 
For calculation and presentation of PK descriptive statistics, and the inferential statistical 
analysis, values as presented in the data listings will be used as the source data. Minimum, 
maximum, mean, GeoMean, median, Q1, Q3, and 95% CI for mean or GeoMean will be 
presented to the same significant figure precision as listed data. Standard deviation will be 
presented to 1 significant figure more than the precision of the data listed. The CV% and 
GeoCV% will always be reported to [ADDRESS_57438]. Derived parameters will be reported to 3 
significant figures, except for parameters that are taken directly from concentration data which 
will be reported using similar precision to those from which they were derived or elapsed 
sampling times which will be reported as 2 decimal places. 
Definition of baseline: 
For the purpose of statistical analysis, baseline is defined as the last non-missing measurement 
prior to the first dose of study drug as described in the following table:  
M2951      Phase IIa in Rheumatoid Arthritis

12-week treatment period 
OLE Period Last non-missing measurement prior 
to first dose of study drug of the 
12-week treatment period 
Definition of CFB:  
CFB and percent CFB will be computed as follows:  
• CFB = visit value – baseline value 
• Percent CFB = 100 * (visit value – baseline value) / baseline value 
Definition of duration: 
Unless otherwise specified, duration will be calculated as the difference between start and stop 
date + 1 (e.g. duration of AE (days) = AE start date – AE stop date + 1). Unless otherwise 
specified, missing dates will not be imputed. 
The time since an event will be calculated as: 
• date of event minus reference date +1 (eg days in study at onset of AE = AE start date - date 
of randomization + 1) if date of event is equal or greater than reference date 
• date of event minus reference date (eg days in study at onset of AE = AE start date - date of 
randomization) otherwise 
Conversion factors: 
The following conversion factors will be used to convert days into months or years: 1 month = 
30.4375 days, 1 year = 365.25 days. For time windows calculation, 1 month is expressed as 30 
days. 
Definition of Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m²): 
BMI will be computed as weight / (height²), where weight is expressed in kg and height in m.  
Handling of missing data: 
The Table 3 summarizes how missing data will be handled for each ACR component and 
DAS28-hsCRP:  
M2951      Phase IIa in Rheumatoid Arthritis

Unless otherwise specified, missing data will not be replaced.  
In all subject data listings, imputed values will be presented. In all listings imputed information 
will be flagged. Non imputed partial dates will be presented in a format such as “_____YYYY”. 
Where imputation is defined, an imputed date with flag (ie, D for day, M for month) will be 
reported. 
Missing statistics, eg when they cannot be calculated, should be presented as ‘nd’ (denoting “not 
done”). For example, if n=1, the measure of variability (SD) cannot be computed and should be 
presented as ‘nd’. 
In case of zero records, an empty output with 0 occurrences, or a sentence mentioning that there 
are no data, will be presented. For tables of AEs and Deaths (outputs required for EudraCT 
and/or clinicaltrial.gov), if there are no observations, the output must contain the first line 
‘Subject with…’ or ‘Subject who died’ displayed with 0 occurrence.

 If the System Organ Class (SOC) or Anatomical Therapeutic Class (ATC) term is missing/not 
coded yet, then ‘Uncoded SOC’ (or ‘Uncoded ATC’) will be indicated at the ADaM level. When 
a Preferred Term (PT) is missing, it will be set to ‘Uncoded PT: verbatim text’. 
Treatment day: 
Treatment day is defined as relative day to the start date of treatment. Treatment day will be 
calculated accordingly, ie: 
• For primary analysis, treatment day [ADDRESS_57439] administration of any 
IMP. 
• For final analysis, treatment day [ADDRESS_57440] administration of M2951: 
o For subjects who switch from placebo to M2951, the treatment day [ADDRESS_57441] administration of M2951 during 12-Week treatment period   
 
The day before is defined as Treatment day –1 (no Treatment day 0 is defined). 
Repeated and unscheduled measurements: 
Data collected at unscheduled visits will be included and analyzed for safety analyses in the 
same fashion as the data collected at scheduled visits. Unscheduled measurements will also be 
used for shift tables.  
Gap between 12-Week treatment period and OLE period 
Subjects with a gap strictly greater than [ADDRESS_57442] as subjects without a gap.  Specific data listings on safety 
data (AEs and all laboratory data) will be produced for these subjects for the final analysis. 
 
Time windows 
As a measurement may have been performed out of window, data will be re-allocated according 
to time windows defined in Table 4, so that each measurement is allocated to the closest 
timepoint. In case of a gap between 12-Week treatment period and OLE, time windows 
allocation will be handled case by [CONTACT_53814]. 
 
For efficacy and safety analyses, each measurement will be assigned an analysis visit number 
first according to Table 4. The analysis visit will then be used for all missing data imputations, 
analysis variable derivations, statistical calculations and presentations. For patient data listings 
by [CONTACT_11191], the visit as collected in the database as well as the analysis visit will be displayed.

The following summary tables and listings of important protocol deviations will be provided 
(separately for pre-/post inclusion deviations): 
• Table providing frequency for each type of important protocol deviation 
• Listing of important protocol deviations 
12.2.[ADDRESS_57447] a relevant influence on the 
PK/PD analysis or impact the quality of the PK/PD data may lead to exclusion from the PK/PD 
analysis sets. Examples include, but may not be limited to, the following:

 o Adverse events, vomiting, diarrhea etc. 
o Vomiting following oral dosing (these instances will be discussed on a 
case-by-case basis) 
o Sample processing errors that may lead to inaccurate bioanalytical results 
o Inaccurate dosing or dosing errors 
o Concomitant medication violations (see Section 6.5.2. of the protocol) 
In the case of a deviation or event that may affect PK, PK data collected during the affected 
study day will be excluded from the study results after consultation and agreement with Sponsor 
or sponsor representative. Other changes to the procedures or events which do not impact the 
quality of the PK data will not be considered clinically important protocol deviations. A common 
example of a protocol deviation that is not clinically important is a missed PK blood sample or 
deviations from PK blood collection times, with the requirement that the actual time of collection 
is recorded. An exception to a PK blood sample deviation defined as not clinically important is 
the predose sample which will be considered a deviation if it is not collected predose, and the 
[ADDRESS_57448] M2951 concentrations are excluded from the PK analysis set, the excluded 
PK data will be listed in the CSR and flagged.

 Partial dates will be handled as follows:  
• For previous medications, in case the date values will not allow a medication to be 
unequivocally allocated to previous medication, the medication will be considered as 
previous medication. 
• For concomitant medications, in case the date values will not allow a medication to be 
unequivocally allocated to concomitant medication, the medication will be considered as 
concomitant medication. 
The ATC-2nd level and PT will be tabulated as given from the World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary (WHO-DD) current version. In case multiple ATCs are assigned to a drug, all ATC-
2nd level will be used for reporting.  
The number and proportion of subjects with previous or concomitant medications (previous 
medications will not be summarized for final analysis) will be separately summarized by 
[CONTACT_53826] 2nd level term and then 
by [CONTACT_53827]. If multiple ATCs/PTs have the same frequency, 
they will be sorted alphabetically. The WHO-DD version used will be indicated in footnote.  
Previous or concomitant medications will be also listed.  
All concurrent procedures, which were undertaken any time on trial, will be summarized. 
Concurrent procedures will be classified by [CONTACT_53828]. Number of subjects with concurrent 
procedures (prior, on or after the first day of IMP) overall and by [CONTACT_53829] (as classified

 15 Treatment Compliance and Exposure 
Exposure 
Exposure will be separately analyzed for the 12-week treatment period, for the OLE period and 
overall (ie 12-Week treatment period + OLE).  
Exposure for 12-week treatment period will only be presented for primary analysis, whereas 
exposure for OLE period and overall exposure will only be presented for final analysis.

 For the 12-week treatment period, subjects will receive 50 mg bid M2951 or placebo 
administered as 2 matching oral capsules twice daily for 84 days. Each treatment kit contains 
enough medication for administration for 1 week + 2 days (ie 36 capsules). On trial visit days, 
subjects will be given treatment kits containing the number of capsules needed up to next 
planned trial visit. Subjects will self-administer IMP in a blinded manner at a set time each day 
(± 2 hours) as two matching capsules bid (morning and evening) for 12 weeks: 
• Subjects randomized to placebo arm will take four placebo capsules filled with mannitol  
• Subjects randomized to M2951 arm will take four capsules filled with 25 mg of M2951. 
On trial visit days, IMP will be administered during the trial visit after the scheduled trial visit 
procedures (other than post treatment PK/PD sampling) are completed. Exposure time in weeks 
will be calculated according to the following formula:  
exposure 	weeks	 =	date of last dose 	-	date of first dose 	+	1/[ADDRESS_57454] administration of any IMP in 12-week treatment period. 
Exposure time will be presented by [CONTACT_53830]:  
• ≤ 1 week  
• > 1 to 2 weeks  
• > 2 to 4 weeks  
• > 4 to 8 weeks  
• > 8 weeks 
The cumulative actual dose (mg) per subject for the 12-week treatment period will also be 
summarized for the active treatment group. The cumulative actual dose is defined as the sum of 
the total dose levels that the subject received between first and last treatment dose: number of 
ingested capsules * 25mg. The number of ingested capsules will be computed as the difference 
between the dispensed amount of capsules and the returned amount of capsules. Cumulative 
actual dose cannot be calculated for placebo treatment group. 
Study drug administrations will also be listed by [CONTACT_1570], and subject, with start/end 
dates of administration, and reason for dose change or no dose (if applicable).

 OLE period 
Exposure for the OLE period will only be presented on patients from OLE SAF who switch from 
Placebo to M2951 50 mg BID. 
After completing the treatment period, subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in 
an optional 6-month M2951 extension period on Week 12 (Visit 8). Subjects who received 
M2951 during the treatment period will continue with the same dose of M2951 (in tablet 
formulation). All subjects in the placebo group during the treatment period will discontinue 
placebo and start treatment with 50 mg bid M2951 tablets on Day 1 of OLE. On trial visit days, 
the IMP will be administered during the trial visit after the scheduled trial visit procedures are 
completed. 
Subjects will take 2 matching oral tablets twice daily for 6 months. Subjects will self-administer 
the IMP at a set time each day (± 2 hours). 
Exposure time in weeks will be calculated according to the following formula:  
exposure 	weeks	 =	date of last dose 	-	date of first dose 	+	1/[ADDRESS_57455] administration of M2951 in OLE period. 
Exposure time will be presented by [CONTACT_53830]:  
• ≤ 4 weeks  
• > 4 to 8 weeks  
• > 8 to 12 weeks  
• > 12 to 16 weeks  
• > 16 weeks 
The cumulative actual dose (mg) per subject for the OLE period will also be summarized for 
both treatment groups. It is defined as for the 12-week treatment period.   
Overall 
Overall exposure will be presented on OLE SAF only for subjects who received M2951 during 
the 12-week treatment period and continue with the same dose of M2951 during OLE period.  
Exposure time in weeks will be calculated according to the following formula:  
exposure 	weeks	 =	date of last dose 	-	date of first dose 	+	1/7

The cumulative actual dose (mg) per subject will be computed as well. It is defined as for the 12-
week treatment period or OLE period. 
Study drug administrations will also be listed by [CONTACT_1570], and subject, with start/end 
dates of administration and reason for dose change (if applicable).  
Compliance  
Compliance will be separately analyzed for the 12-week treatment period, the OLE period and 
overall, in the same manner as exposure was analyzed (see Table 10).  
For each analysis, a listing of kit number with date of dispense, number of ingested and returned 
capsules/tablets will also be provided. 
12-week treatment period 
Compliance for the 12-week treatment period will be presented on SAF. 
For the 12-week treatment period, compliance with treatment is defined as the number of 
capsules taken during a period divided by [CONTACT_53831], multiplied by 100 to yield a percentage, ie:  
compliance for X weeks of treatment =  
100*(
36 ∗ − number	of	returned	capsules	for	X_wk	period  
4 ∗number	of	days	between	first	intake	and	last	intake	of	X_wk	period	) 
Compliance with treatment and the number of ingested capsules will be tabulated overall (ie 
from first intake to last intake of 12-week treatment period).

 The Table 13 summarizes the sensitivity analyses to be performed on missing data imputations: 
Table 13 : Sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis 
Endpoint  Method 
ACR Response  Non-responder imputation (NR) : ACR20 response rate will be evaluated 
on mITT analysis set. Subjects with missing ACR score will be considered 
as non-responders.  
Completely Missing at Random pattern (MCAR) : ACR20 response rate 
will be evaluated as observed without any LOCF imputation on mITT 
analysis set.  
Missing At Random pattern (MAR) : ACR20 will be imputed using 
multiple imputations process using MI SAS procedure as follows:  
1. Monotone missing data structure will be created as follows: 
intermediate (non-monotone) missing data will be multiply imputed 
using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and 
assuming MAR and multivariate normality. Transformation of data 
will only be used if there is a clear deviation from normality. The 
SAS procedure PROC MI with the MCMC option will be used with 
seed number=20170524. The number of burn-in iterations will be 
set to 200, which is the default value. Nevertheless, if diagnosis 
plots show that the convergence has not yet occurred, this will be 
adjusted.  
2. Then, each component will be imputed with treatment group, 
hsCRP at baseline and data at previous visit from all ACR20 
components as covariates .  
3. Imputation will be repeated 1000 times. The ACR20 will then be 
calculated for each of the multiply imputed data sets from the 
imputed components. Results will be combined using 
MIANALYZE SAS procedure with the Rubin’s rules. 
Missing Not At Random pattern (MNAR) : ACR20 will be imputed using 
multiple imputations process with MI SAS procedure for the MNAR 
pattern, using controlled-arm data with the MNAR statement from SAS MI 
procedure.

I N F O R M A T I O N 50/[ADDRESS_57458]’s Assessment of Physical Function as measured by [CONTACT_36134]-DI 
- Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
- Acute phase reactant as measured by [CONTACT_53832]. 
In this trial, ACR20 response calculations will use the HAQ-DI for the subject’s assessment of 
physical function and hsCRP as the measure of acute phase reactant. 
Improvement of at least 20% of these assessments is defined as follows: 
• TJC (68 joint count): a decrease of at least 20% of the number of tender joint compared to 
baseline 
• SJC (66 joint count): a decrease of at least 20% of the number of swollen joint compared to 
baseline  
• Subject’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity: a decrease of at least 20% on the VAS 
compared to baseline. 
• Subject’s Assessment of Pain: a decrease of at least 20% on the VAS compared to baseline. 
• Subject’s Assessment of Physical Function: a decrease of at least 20% of the HAQ-DI score 
compared to baseline. 
• Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity: a decrease of at least 20% on the VAS 
compared to baseline 
• Acute phase reactant: a decrease of at least 20% of hsCRP measurement compared to baseline 
The hypotheses tested are as follows: 
• H0: Difference in ACR20 response rates at Week 12 (M2951 versus placebo) ≤ 0. 
• H1: Difference in ACR20 response rates at Week 12 (M2951 versus placebo) > 0. 
Tests will be based on the 2-sided 80% CI for ∆.  
The Week 12 ACR20 proportion and a 2-sided 80% CI will be provided for each treatment 
group. The difference ∆ in ACR20 proportions between M2951 + MTX and placebo + MTX, 
and a 2-sided 80% CI for ∆, based on the “corrected Miettinen-Nurminen” method (3) - method 
of Mee interval corrected with Miettinen and Nurminen factor n/(n-1), n being the total number 
of evaluable randomized subjects - will be provided.  
The 2-sided 80% CI for ∆ based on the “corrected Miettinen-Nurminen” method will be 
computed with SAS® FREQ procedure, using RISKDIFF and CL=MN statements. 
The primary analysis will be based on the mITT Analysis Set using post baseline LOCF for 
imputation of missing values for the ACR components. If a subject discontinued prior to Week 
12, then the subject will be considered as ACR20 non-responder. The null hypothesis H0: ∆ ≤ 0 
will be rejected at the 1-sided 0.10 level if the lower limit of the 2-sided 80% CI exceeds zero.

 The primary analysis will be repeated for subjects with baseline hsCRP ≥3.6mg/L, as detailed in 
Table 14. 
Additional sensitivity analyses will be performed on ACR20 response as described in Table 13. 
16.2 Secondary Endpoint Analyses 
16.2.1  Key secondary endpoint analysis 
The key secondary endpoint is the change in hsCRP from Baseline to Week 4 and will be 
presented on the mITT Analysis Set. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_53833]. A point estimate and 2-sided 80% CI for the difference ∆ in Week 4 hsCRP mean CFB 
between subjects treated with M2951 + MTX and subjects treated with placebo + MTX 
(reference) will be provided.  
Point estimate and its CI limits will be estimated with SAS® GLM procedure using LSMEANS 
statement. The ANCOVA will include baseline as a covariate and treatment group as an 
independent variable. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using a non-parametric method. 
The Hodges-Lehmann difference median estimate and 80% CI will be calculated with SAS® 
NPAR1WAY procedure using HL statement. Asymptotic and exact CIs will be computed. 
Assumptions for the ANCOVA models:  
Validity of the model will be verified as follows:  
• The homogeneity of variances between treatment groups will be checked using the Levene’s 
test. A scatter plot of residuals versus fitted values will be also performed. 
• In order to assess the independence of error terms, a residual lag plot will be performed, ie 
constructed by [CONTACT_53834] (i) against residual (i-1).  
• A scatter plot of the response variable against the covariate, using separate symbols for each 
treatment group will be performed to verify the presence of linear relationship between the 
covariate and the response variable, and that all treatment regression lines have the same slope.  
• Homogeneity of regression slopes will be verified by [CONTACT_53835]. This assumption will be validated 
if this interaction is not significant. If this assumption is verified, then the interaction will be 
removed from the model. 
• Normality of residuals will be checked by [CONTACT_53836], which should 
fall within the interval [-2;2]. Normal QQ-plot of residuals will be performed as well.

as well as the statistical analysis of the PK pa rameters will be the responsibility of the study 
biostatistician at . 
For the PK analysis, predose sample M2951 concentrations that are BLQ will be assigned a 
numerical value of zero. On Day 1, any missing predose value will also be assigned a numerical 
value of zero for the calculation of AUC. Any anomalous concentration values observed at 
predose will be identified in the CSR. All postdose BLQ concentrations will be set to ‘zero’ in all 
cases. Graphical displays of mean (± SD for linear profiles only) plasma concentration-time profiles will be presented on linear and semi-logarithmic scales by [CONTACT_53839] 1 and Day 29 data on the same plot.  
Non-compartmental computation of M2951 PK parameters will be performed. Pharmacokinetic 
parameters will be evaluated and listed for all pa tients who provide suffici ent concentration-time 
data.  
Individual PK parameters will be calculated using actual elapsed time from dose with a 
maximum of 14 significant digits in the time data (or using scheduled time if actual time is not 
available). The predose sample will be considered as if it had been taken simultaneously with the 
administration of IMP.  
For each subject in the PK analysis set the following PK parameters will be calculated for 
M2951 on Day 1 and Day 29 following the morning dose on Days 1 and 29:

16.3.3  Pharmacodynamic Endpoint Analyses 
Absolute B cell numbers and subtypes (mature-naïve, non-switched, immature/transitional, 
memory), are assessed at screening and Days 1, 29, and 85 (end of treatment), prior to the morning dose in the 12-week treatment period. In addition absolute B cell numbers and subtypes will be assessed in the optional OLE period at Month 3, Month 6, and at the End of Trial Visit. Immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgM, and IgG and subc lasses) will be assessed at screening, Day 57 
and Day 85 (end of treatment) in the treatment period, and at Month 3 and Month 6 visits in the OLE period.  
Absolute B cell, B cell subtypes, and immunoglobulin levels (observed, change from baseline, 
and percent change from baseline values) will be summarized using the relevant PD analysis set. Descriptive statistics for these variables (mean, SD, CV%, median, minimum/maximum, Q1 and Q3 percentile, and interquartil e range) will be presented. 
The mean (SD) absolute value for each treatment group will be plotted versus time point for 
B cell, B cell subsets (mature-naïve, non-switche d, immature/transitional, memory), and IgM, 
IgA, IgG immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclass es IgG1-IgG4. Similar plots of the mean (SD) 
percent change from baseline for each treatment group versus time point will be generated for B cell and B cell subtypes (mature-naïve, non-switched, immature/transitional, memory), NK cell, T cell, T cell subtypes (CD4 and CD8) and IgM, IgA, and IgG (and IgG subclasses) immunoglobulin levels.

17.1 Adverse Events 
All analyses described in Section 17.1 will be based on treatment-emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) if not otherwise specified.

I N F O R M A T I O N 59/78  
 
 TEAEs will be defined according to Table 16.  
Table 16: Definition of TEAE  
Primary analysis TEAEs will be defined as AEs starting on or after first treatment 
administration of any IMP (placebo or M2951) until first dose of 
M2951 during OLE (or until the end of study if the patient 
declined to participate in OLE period). 
 
Only AEs from 12-Week treatment period will be considered.  
Final analysis  • For subjects who switch from placebo to M2951 [ADDRESS_57464] treatment administration of M2951 50 mg BID during 
OLE until the end of study.  
Only AEs from OLE period will be considered. 
• For patients who continue with M2951 [ADDRESS_57465] treatment administration of M2951 during 12-Week 
double blind treatment period.  
AEs from both periods (12-Week treatment and OLE) will 
be considered. 
Incomplete AE-related dates will be handled as follows: 
• In case the onset date is missing completely or missing partially but the onset month and year, 
or the onset year are equal to the start of IMP then the onset date will be replaced by [CONTACT_53840].  
• In all other cases the missing onset day or missing onset month will be replaced by 1. 
• Incomplete stop dates will be replaced by [CONTACT_53841] (if day is missing only), if 
not resulting in a date later than the date of subject's death. In the latter case, the date of death 
will be used to impute the incomplete stop date.  
• Further information collected after the cut-off for an analysis (such as a fatal outcome) may be 
extracted from the Safety data base and presented separately in the CSR. 
17.1.[ADDRESS_57466] MedDRA version available at the time of analysis. The 
severity of AEs will be graded using National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE version 4.03) toxicity grades. AEs with missing classification 
concerning IMP relationship will be considered related to the IMP.

 All AEs recorded during the course of the trial (ie assessed from signature [CONTACT_53861]-up/End of Trial visit) will be coded according to the MedDRA and 
assigned to a SOC and PT.  
The number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least one TEAE will be summarized 
according to MedDRA SOCs and PTs by [CONTACT_1570], relationship to IMP, and severity. If a 
subject experiences more than one occurrence of the same TEAE during the trial, the subject will 
only be counted once for that treatment (the worst severity and the worst relationship to trial 
treatment will be tabulated).  
In case a subject had events with missing and non-missing grades, the maximum of the non-
missing grades will be displayed. 
A TEAE summary table will include a row for the overall frequency of TEAEs of the following 
types:  
• Any TEAE 
• IMP related TEAE 
• Serious TEAE 
• IMP related serious TEAE 
• TEAE with severe intensity (NCI-CTCAE grade ≥ 3, NCI-CTCAE grade ≥ 4) 
• IMP related TEAE with severe intensity (NCI-CTCAE grade ≥ 3, NCI-CTCAE grade ≥ 4) 
• TEAE leading to death 
• IMP related TEAE leading to death  
A separate TEAE summary table will present the following:  
• TEAE leading to interruption of IMP  
• IMP related TEAE leading to interruption of IMP 
• TEAE leading to withdrawal of IMP 
• IMP related TEAE leading to withdrawal of IMP  
• TEAE leading to dose reduction  
• IMP related TEAE leading to dose reduction    
• TEAE leading to study termination  
• IMP related TEAE leading to study termination

Group/SOC terms will be sorted alphabetically. PTs within each group/SOC will be sorted by 
[CONTACT_53845], and alphabetically if multiple PTs have the same frequency.  
Pre-treatment and TEAEs will be listed separately by [CONTACT_50109]. Specific data 
listings of pre-treatment AEs and TEAEs will be performed for subjects with a gap > [ADDRESS_57467] 
onset of AE. The incidence rate multiplied with 1000 would give the number of AEs expected in 
1000 subjects within 1 time unit (for example 1 year). The exposure adjusted incidence rates of 
TEAEs will be presented by [CONTACT_3592].

coagulation) will be summarized by [CONTACT_53846] (see Section 11 ). The 
s
tatistics will be presented for baseline, each time point during the study, and CFB to each time 
point, when applicable. 
Laboratory results will be classified according to NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03 as provided by [CONTACT_19979]. In case a laboratory parameter has bi-directional toxicities (eg Potassium) 
both directions will be presented for the given parameter (ie Potassium Low and Potassium 
High). On-treatment values are results of assessments done from the first IMP administration on 
Day 1. Laboratory results containing a modifier such as “<” or “>=” will be handled case by [CONTACT_53847]. 
A shift table of baseline versus post-baseline based on the worst NCI-CTCAE grade will be 
presented by [CONTACT_53848].  
Additional laboratory results that are neither classified in protocol nor part of NCI-CTCAE will 
be presented according to the categories based on normal ranges: below normal limits (Low),

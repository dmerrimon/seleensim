Safety endpoints:   
• Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation from the study drug, SAEs, 
and deaths.  
• Change from Baseline in clinical laboratory results (including fasting glucose 
and total lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] [8 to 10 hours of fasting is required for these laboratory 
testing ]), ECG results, body weight, and vital signs.  
• Dermal safety: adhesion, irritation, discomfort, and adhesive residue.  
Pharmacokinetic endpoint : 
• Plasma concentrations of diclofenac (for both HP -5000  and HP -5000
on Day  14 and 28 (or at the Early Termination  Visit). 
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses.  A Statistical 
Analysis Plan ( SAP) that describes the details of the analyses to be conducted will be 
written prior to database lock.  Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of s tatistical 
significance will be 2 -sided .  A difference resulting in a P value of <0.[ADDRESS_311491] deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical variables, these 
statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_256316].  
 
Analysis Populations  
• Intent -to-Treat (ITT):  Will include  all randomized subjects.  Regardless of 
any protocol deviations, analyses performed on the ITT set will be based on the randomized treatment assign ment and all available data.  
 
• Full Analysis Set (FAS):  Will include  all randomized subjects who have had 
at least [ADDRESS_311492] -baseline assessment of the primary 
efficacy measure (WOMAC pain score).  Evaluable subjects will be defined 
as those who meet the FAS definition.  The FAS will be used as the primary 
set for analysis of efficacy endpoints based on randomized treatment 
assignment.  
 
• Safety Analysis Set (SAF):  Will include  all subjects who have had at least [ADDRESS_311493] occurred in treatment arm assignments, then analyses using the SAF will be based on treatment actually received. 
 
The SAF will be used for both the analysis of dermal evaluations and safety 
endpoints.  
 
• Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS):  Will include  all subjects who have 
received at least [ADDRESS_311494] 1 blood sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment.  
Subjects may be excluded from the PAS set if they significantly violate 
inclusion or exclusion criteria, significantly violate the protocol in a way that 
may influence the PK analysis, if any unexpected error occurs during the Page 8 of 246

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 8 of 89 study that may influence the PK analysis (e .g., early detachmen t of 
transdermal systems, apparent sample switching, etc.) or if their data are 
unavailable or incomplete.  The PAS will be used for the analysis with 
model -based approach.  Excluded cases will be documented together with the 
reason for exclusion.  
 
Primary  Efficacy Analysis :  The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the 
change from Baseline to Week 4 in the WOMAC pain score; the primary analysis set is the FAS.  The comparisons of interest are:  
• HP-5000  versus placebo  
• HP-5000  versus placebo  
 
The estimand in the primary analysis for efficacy for each dose is the difference between treatments groups (HP -5000 dose group vs. placebo) in the change from 
Baseline to Week 4 in WOMAC pain score in all subjects as randomized, under the 
assumption that  all randomized subjects 
remain on their randomized treatment 
throughout the study.  WOMAC scores obtained more than 24 hours after 
discontinuation of double -blind study drug will be excluded as a -priori defined 
outliers . 
 
The primary efficacy variable, the change from Baseline to Week 4 in the WOMAC 
pain score will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis.  The MMRM model will include change from Baseline in WOMAC pain 
score as the repeated dependent variable, with treatment (HP-5000 , 
HP-5000 , and placebo), treatment -by-visit interaction, and the Baseline 
WOMAC pain score as covariates.  An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
assumed.  If the unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, a series of other 
covariance structures will be tested for use.  The MMRM model may be repeated on 
additional analysis sets as a sensitivity analysis.  If the normality assumption is 
violated, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on rank -transformed data will be used as 
utility ana lysis and additional supportive analyses may be performed.  
 Other sensitivity analyses may be performed on the primary endpoint to assess the robustness of the results based on the model used for primary analysis.  These analyses  
may include multiple imput ation and pattern -mixture models for handling of missing 
data.  Details will be provided in the SAP.  The analyses will be performed according 
to the National Academy of Sciences (2010) guidelines.  
 
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints :  Other secondar y efficacy endpoints will 
be analyzed using the change in mean as appropriate.  
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (pain) – change between  Baseline and Week  1, 
and Week  2. 
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (stiffness)  between Baseline and Week  1, Week 2 
and Week 4 . 
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (physical function) between Baseline and Week  
1, Week 2 and Week 4 . 
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index ( composite score ) between Baseline and Week  1, 
Week 2 and Week 4 . 
• Patient Global Assessment between Baseline and Week 4.  
• Patient Global Impression of Change  between Week  1 and Week 4 . 
• Pain intensity assessed on an 11 -point NRS between Baseline, Week  1, Week 
2, and Week 4 . 
• Use of rescue medication  between Baseline and Week  1, Week 2 and Week

provided in the SAP.   Additional categorical response analyses may be performed; 
additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
 
Analysis of Safety  and Dermal Assessments :  All safety summaries will be 
descriptive; statistical s ignificance tests may be performed on safety data that will be 
described in the SAP .  Safety variables include AEs, clinical laboratory values, vital 
signs, ECG readings, physical examination results,  and dermal safety results .  No 
formal inferential analy ses will be conducted for safety variables, unless otherwise 
noted.

5.1. Background and Rationale 
An estimated  52.5 million adult s (22.7% of the population)1 in the [LOCATION_002] (US) have 
doctor-diagnos
ed osteoarthritis  (OA) ; 22.7 million (9.8% of all adults) have arthritis and 
arthritis -attributable activity limitations.   Based on these data, it is projected that 78 million 
(26%) adults aged [ADDRESS_311502] doctor -diagnose d arthritis by [CONTACT_2892] 2040.2  
Patients with arthritis are encouraged to be active, since it has been shown that exercise and 
activity help to decrease pain associated with OA, improve function, and delay disability.  
However activity and exercise are oft en limited by [CONTACT_256364], and this 
pain may become  part of a cycle of inactivity  and weight gain that tends to perpetuate the 
stiffness and disability associated with OA.  Additionally, oral medications used over time may 
cause gastrointestinal (GI) distress and interfere with the blood- clotting cycle.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_256317]; patients may also become dependent on their opi[INVESTIGATOR_256318], thereby [CONTACT_256365].  There is an unmet need for a safe, reliable, and effective pain 
medication without the risk and lack of efficacy associated with those currently available. 
 
Diclofenac sodium is from the phenylacetic acid class of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drug  
(NSAIDs ) developed by [CONTACT_256366]., Ltd., Switzerland, in 1965.  In the US, diclofenac 
sodium is available in various dose forms, including tablet, eye drop, extended- release tablet, gel, 
patch, capsule, and  solution.  The mechanism of action of NSAIDs is not completely understood 
but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase [COX]-1 and COX-2) inhibition. 
 
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has started the development of a formulation of diclofenac sodium 
for topi[INVESTIGATOR_256319] a transdermal patch system, the HP -5000 for the treatment of pain 
of OA of the knee(s) .  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_256320] [ADDRESS_311503] potential benefits compared with the existing formulations, as 
follows: 
• Transfer of drug into the treatment target area resulting in lower systemic and GI exposure when compared to orally administered diclofenac sodium and a possible 
reduction of systemic side effects including GI ul cers/lesions and adverse reactions such 
as nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and stomach pain. 
• Improvement of compliance with  compared with existing topi[INVESTIGATOR_256321]. Page [ADDRESS_311504] been completed 
 
evaluating the PK and tolerability in healthy volunteers.  The lead formulations for this 
program, HP 5000  and HP 5000 , both of which contain  
diclofenac sodium  with a patch size of , were selected based on t he diclofenac 
pharmacokinetic profile and patch performance characteristics, such as irritation and adhesion on 
the mobile knee joint application site.  
 
It should be noted that the HP 5000  formulation is also being developed  by [CONTACT_256367]’s 
parent company,  for different  indications 
(i.e.,  and  and is referred to as the  (also known as

additional safety data.

Further details about HP-5000 are found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
5.3. Summary of Potential Risks and Benefits  
The potential benefits of study  participation are that subjects with OA (1) may experience a 
reduction in pain and inflammation as a result of treatment with  the HP-5000 patch and (2)  will 
understand that they are contributing to the scientific knowledge that may lead to expansion of 
the treatment options for subject s with OA. 
 The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to the HP-5000 
patch and the risks of medical evaluation, including venipuncture.

7.1. Overall Study Design and Plan - Description  
This is a 4-week, randomized, double -blind, multicenter, placebo -controlled phase 2 study to 
evaluate the efficacy , safety  and tolerability  of HP-5000 compared with that of placebo  in the 
treatment of OA.  The study will run for approximately 9 weeks comprised of up to a maximum 
of 28-day Screening  Phase that will include  a Washout Period of up to a maximum of 14 days, a 
4-week Double-blind T reatment P hase, and a 1- week Follow -up Safety Period.  Subjects will be 
randomly assigned to receive  one of the following 3 treatments  in a 1:1:2 ratio :  HP-[ADDRESS_311506] will be approximately 9 weeks.  
 
• Screening/Washout Period : Visit 1 ( up to 28 Days): This is the period b etween 
Screening Visit (V1) and Baseline Visit ( V2): After signing the informed consent, the 
Screening Phase will begin .  Subjec ts who se preliminary  entry criteria have been met on 
Visit 1 will be contact[CONTACT_256368] -25 and will be 
instructed to begin the Washout P eriod for 7 to a maximum of  14 days (or at least 5 half -
lives , whichever  is longer ) prior to start the B aseline Visit (V2).   
 
During Visit 1, s ubjects will receive instruction on how to use the patient eDiary.  The

subjects will have to record pain severity  of their target knee  score on the patient eDiary 
every day at home before the start of the Washout and during the Washout P eriod  using 
the 11-point NRS Scale.  Subjects may start rescue medication usage  as needed  from the 
start of the Washout Period ( i.e., Day -25).    Subjects will record rescue medication 
usage in their eD iary starting from the Washout Period.    
 
  
  If 
determined to be eligible, the subject will continue to record his/her pai n score daily  of 
the target knee during the Washout Period.  The mean pain score, using the 11- point NRS  
scale, of at least the last  2 consecutive days immediately prior to the Baseline Visit  Page 22 of 246

8.2.[ADDRESS_311519] Withdrawal  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, 
Republic of South Africa, October 1996), subjects have the right to withdraw participation from 
the study at any time for any reason.   Every reasonable attempt should be made by [CONTACT_256372] ; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if 
they withdraw consent to participate.  Investigators must make at least [ADDRESS_311520] 
subjects who fail to attend scheduled visits by [CONTACT_256373] . 
 
The investigator also has the right to remove subjects from the study for the following reasons: 
• Adverse events:  If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an AE, the 
principal specific event and any related test results will be recorded on the electronic case 
report form (e CRF).  If a subject withdraws because of an AE plus another reason, the 
withdrawal will be considered due to the AE and the eCRF will be completed to reflect 
this reason for withdrawal.  A narrative description will be required for all early 
withdrawa ls due to AEs. 
• The request of the subject , his/her representative, investigator or sponsor, whether for 
administrative or other reasons. 
• Noncompliance with study drug or non- compliance with subject eDiary completion, 
protocol violation, or unreliable behavior.  
• Pregnancy.  If the subject becomes pregnant during the clinical study, the study drug 
should be stopped immediately and the subject will be withdrawn from the study  and 
followed until delivery. 
 If a subject is withdrawn early from the study, the foll owing procedures will be performed: 
• The date of the last dose of study drug and all observations collected up to the time of termination will be recorded on the Early Withdrawal eCRF page along with the reason 
for termination.  All Early Withdrawal procedu res should be completed and recorded on 
the Early Withdrawal eCRF page.  If withdrawal occurs at a regular scheduled visit, the Page [ADDRESS_311521] any information related to the visit. 
• In order to enable the most complete recording of any subject who withdraws early from 
the study, it is important to evaluate these subjects at the study center as soon as possible.  
Subjects who are withdrawing early should undergo an Early Withdrawal /Termination  
Visit and a Follow -up Safety Visit must be scheduled.  
 Subjects may be withdrawn if continuing in the study is not in the subject’s best interest; their 
condition worsens during the study , or for safety reasons, as determined by [CONTACT_1188].  
Subjects may also be withdrawn due to lack of compliance with the protocol or if the subject is 
unwilling to continue participation in the study. 
8.3. Subject Replacement Criteria  
Subjects who withdraw after randomization and the application of the first treatment patch will 
not be replaced.  Page [ADDRESS_311522] 
The following is a description of study drug:

details the accountability of clinical supplies through the use of a Drug Dispensing Log. 
9.2. Treatments Administered  
HP-5000 will be administered  for a maximum of 28 ± 2 days. 
The treatment arms for this study are the following: 
Treatment Arm   Treatment  
HP-5000   One patch applied  to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
HP-5000  One patch applied  to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
Placebo  One patch applied  to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
Patch Application 
A separate  guidance for patch application will be provided to subjects for applying, securing, and 
removing the patch . 
9.3. Dispensing and Storage 
Study drug  supplied by  [CONTACT_256374].  The investigator is responsible for 
dispensing study drug  according to the dosage scheme and for ensuring proper storage of study 
drug. 
 
The investigator must confirm the receipt of study drug  with his/her signature.  A copy of this 
receipt must be kept by [CONTACT_093] , and another copy will be stored at Noven 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “Noven”) , and/or   Until study 
drug is dispensed to the subjects, it must be stored at 25°C and in a dry place in a securely locked 
area that is not generally accessible.  
 All study drug supplies must be stored in a secure l ocked a rea with access limited to the 
investigator or those persons authorized by [CONTACT_256375].  Study drug should be stored as per the label. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
In this parallel- group randomized study, subjects who will meet study entry criteria will be 
randomly assigned in a 1:1:2 ratios  to receive HP-5000  HP-5000  or placebo 
patches , respectively .  The randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially through a Page 33 of 246

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 33 of 89 central interactive voice response system ( IVRS ) as subjects who met eligibility criteria are 
enrolled into the study.  The study center will not be a blocking factor in the randomization 
schedule.   At designated visits, subject s will be given a kit containing sufficient study drug to last 
until the next scheduled study visit. 
 
The randomization schedule will be  prepared by  [CONTACT_81563].  
No one involved in the clinical conduct will have access to the randomization schedule before 
official unblinding of treatment assignment.  No subject will be randomized into this study more 
than once. 
9.5. Blinding  and Unb linding  Treatment Assignment  
To protect the blind, placebo patches will be identical in appearance to the HP-[ADDRESS_311524] of the study, including 
data management, will be blinded to study drug treatment assignment with the exception of a 
prespecified unblinded statistician /programmer from  who will have 
access to the randomization code.  The unblinded study personnel will not participate in study 
procedures or data analysis prior to unblinding of the study data to all study related personnel.  If 
an interim analysis is to be conducted, then unblinded personnel who are not otherwise involved 
in the study will prepare the data for review. 
 
Study personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize bias in 
the conduct of the clinical study.  Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the 
treatment assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency.  Unblinding will be permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate 
knowledge of t he subject’s treatment assignment.  
 
In the case of a medical emergency, to appropriately treat  the subject , study drug will need to be 
unblinded.  T he investigator may break the randomization code for an individual subject.  
However, the investigator should make every effort to discuss the unblinding of the subject  with 
the medical monitor  prior to unblinding whenever  possible. 
 
If the investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, then he/she must notify 
the medical monitor immediately  of the blind breaking  incident without revealing the subject’s 
treatment assignment.  Page 34 of 246

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 34 of 89 In all such cases, the AE necessitating the emergency blind break will be handled as an SAE in 
accordance with the procedures indicated above.  Any broken code  will be clearly justified, 
explained by a comment on the appropriate eCRF page  along with the date and reason for study 
discontinuation ; and captured on the SAE Form. 
 The investigator or designee must record the date and reason for unblinding or study 
discontinuation on the appropriate eCRF for that subject.  In all cases that are not emergencies, 
the investigator must discuss the event with the medical monitor prior to unblinding the subject’s 
treatment assignment.  
 If treatment assignment is unb linded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the remaining subjects in the study.  Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised.  If a 
subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from 
the study.  The investigator will make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.  
9.6. Selection of Doses and Administration in the Study  
The dose of diclofenac  in a patch size of  ap
plied  and rotated between 
 on the knee (inner and outer knee ) is based on the following considerations: 
•  
 
• Dose that targets diclofenac exposure after HP -5000 patch application that is similar to 
that of registered topi[INVESTIGATOR_256324].  
• The data from previous studies investigating  irritation and PK s upport the proposed dose 
of  and a patch size of  a pplied  and rotated between  on 
the knee for the lead formulations (HP-5000  and HP -5000 . 
9.7. Dose Adjustment Criteria  
Dose adj ustment is NOT  allowed in this study.  
9.8. Drug Accountability  
The investigator (or pharmacist, as appropriate)  must maintain adequate records of the receipt 
and conditions of all study drugs , dispensing, return, or other disposition of study drug  including 
the date, quantity dispensed to each subject, batch or code number, identification of subjects 
(subject number [and initials]) who received study drug  and any reasons for departure from the Page [ADDRESS_311525] keep accurate records of drug received at 
site, dispensed to the subjects.  
 
The investigator will not supply study drug  to any person except those named as sub-
investigators  (on the Form FDA  1572) , designated study personnel, and subjects in this study.  
The investigator will not dispense study drug  from any study sites to other than those l isted (on 
the Form FDA  1572). 
 
Study drug  may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_23837].  If any of study drugs  is 
not dispensed, lost, stolen, unusable , or is received in a damaged container, this information must 
be documented and reported to Noven and appropriate regulatory agencies, as required. 
 
At the completion of the study, a final reconciliation of all study drugs  (used and unused) must 
performed by [CONTACT_256376] (or designated 
location).  The unused study drug must be left in the original packaging and returned to the 
sponsor (or designee) for destruction. 
9.9. Treatment Compliance  
Treatment compliance with study drug  regimens will be assessed by [CONTACT_256377], patch application, removal and by [CONTACT_256378], if 
necessary, at every post -randomization visit.  Treatment compliance will also be calculated as 
the number of patches applied divided by [CONTACT_256379] a given period, expressed as a percentage.  
 At Visits 3 through 5 or any Early Termination Visit, the study drug (patches) from the previous 
Double-blind Treatment Phase will be returned to the investigator.  The study drug will be 
inventoried and noncompliance defined assuming  less than 80% or more than 120% of study 
drug during any evaluation period (visit to visit).  If the subject is noncompliant, the Medical 
Advisor should be contact[CONTACT_256380]’s eligibility to continue in the study. 
 
The subject must be counseled if compliance is not satisfactory  (used 6 or less patches per 
week) .  If a subject has been noncompliant on two consecutive visits, the subject may be 
withdrawn early from the study for non- compliance.

intake/use of rescue medication/ study drug in the eDiary .  Deviations from the planned doses 
(overdose, missed dose or timing) will be recorded on the subject s’ eCRF.  These eD iaries will 
be reviewed by [CONTACT_256381].  
Information from that subject eDiary will be transcr ibed on the appropriate eCRF pages for 
documentation of subject compliance with study drug.  Compliance will include the following:  
 
1. Telephone Follow- up: A telephone follow -up call will be performed between Screening 
(Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2), before the start of the Washout Period and another one 
during the Follow-up Period. 
 
2. Patient Education: At all clinical study visits, the investigator will explain the 
importance of the following:  
 
a. applying study medication  to the target  knee after 
showering/bathing;  
b. recording patient eDiary  information every day; 
c. accurately reporting pain;  
d. accurately reporting rescue medication use;  
e. understanding when to return for next visit and the importance of returning on 
schedule; and  
f. adhering to the overall research plan. 
 
During Screening (Visit 1), the investigator will provide the subject with an introduction to the various questionnaires including the  that will be used during the  
entire  study and the patient eD iary. 
 
3. Patient eDiary :  The subject eD iary will be used by [CONTACT_256382]/removal, the NRS scores, the use of 
rescue medication, and questionnaires about adhesion, skin irritation, discomfort and 
adhesive residue.  
 
4. Rescue Medication:   If needed, subjects will be allowed to take up to a maximum of 2 
grams (4 tablets) of oral acetaminophen per day as rescue medication for pain of the 
target and/or the non- target knee except within 2 calendar days prior to Baseline Visit 
(V2) a nd within 1 calendar  day for all subsequent visits (V3, V4 and V5) .  Information Page 37 of 246

10.2. Assessments  
10.2.1 Efficacy  
[IP_ADDRESS] Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index  
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Likert (LK) version  3.[ADDRESS_311545] recent version of this instrument for the assessment of hip and knee OA.  The WOMAC 
Osteoarthritis Index is widely used to measure pain, stiffness, and physical function in subjects 
with OA pain .  It is considered to be a reliable and valid instrument for this indication .5,6,7   
 
The WOMAC Pain  scale evaluates the following 5 items:  
1. Walking Page [ADDRESS_311546] 
5. Weight bearing  
 
Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being no difficulty and 4 being extreme difficulty.  
 
The WOMAC Stiffness  scale assesses 2 items:  
1. Morning stiffness , and  
2. Stiffness occurring later in the day.  
Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being no difficulty and 4 being extreme difficulty.  
The WOMAC Physical Function  assesses the following  17 categories using the 0 to 4 scale 
described previously: 
1. Descending stairs  
2. Ascending stairs  
3. Rising from sitting  
4. Standing 
5. Bending to floor 
6. Walking on a flat surface  
7. Getting in/getting out of car  
8. Going shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
9. Putting on socks 
10. Lying in bed 
11. Taking off socks

13. Getting in/out of bath  
14. Sitting  
15. Getting on/off toilet  
16. Heavy domestic duties  
17. Light domestic  duties 
 
The WOMAC  Composite score is most commonly calculated  by [CONTACT_256389] 3 
subscales.  Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional 
limitations.  The total score is calculated as follows: Total score= __/96= __%  Page 46 of 246

HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 50 of 89 [IP_ADDRESS] Evaluations of Patch and Dermal Assessment 
Patch Adhesion  
Patch adhesion will be assessed in two ways  (in-clinic and at -home).  At each  clinic  visit, patch 
adhesion will be assessed by [CONTACT_1720] a designee using the following 5-point numerical 
scale:  
• 0 = ≥90% adhered (es sentially no lift off the skin).  
• 1 = ≥75% to <90% adhered (some edge s only lifting off of the skin). 
• 2 = ≥50% to <75% adhered (less than half of the system lifting off of the skin) . 
• 3 = <50% adhered but not detached (more than half the system lifting off of the skin 
without falling off) . 
• 4 = patch detached (patch completely off the skin). 
 
During the Double-blind T reatment Phase at home, subjects will only report on any  incidence of  
patch detachment  in the eD iary. 
 
Irritation  
At each clinic visit, the a pplication site where the previous patch was applied will be examined 
for signs of skin irritation.  All subjects will be evaluated by a trained investigator or designee 
using the Berger and Bowman scale (Berger and B owman 1982) as described below. 
 Half grades will not be assigned if reactions fall between the unit grades, rather, the more severe 
of the 2 grades will be assigned.  
 
Dermal Response 
• 0 = no evidence of irritation 
• 1 = minimal eryth ema, barely perceptible  
• 2 = definite erythema, readily visible; minimal ed ema or minimal papular response 
• 3 = erythema and papules 
• 4 = definite edema  
• 5 = erythema, edema, and papules 
• 6 = vesicular eruption 
• 7 = strong reaction spreading beyond the application site  
 
Other Effects  
• A = slightly glazed appearance  
• B = marked glazed appearance  Page 51 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 51 of 89 • C = gl azing with peeling and cracking  
• F = glazing with fissures  
• G = film of dried  serous exudates covering all or part of the patch site 
• H = small petechial ero sions and/or scabs 
• N = no other observations 
 
Dermal response score will be rated on a 0 to 7 scale, whereby 0 is rated as “No evidence of irritation” and 7 is rated as “Strong reaction spreading beyond test (application) site.” 
 
Other effects will be scored via a letter scale and a corresponding numeric scale, whereby N (0) 
is rated as “No effects” and H (3) is rated as “Small petechial erosions and/or scabs.”  
 
During the Double- blind T reatment Phase at home, subjects will complete a questionnaire about 
skin irritation in the eDiary. 
 
Discomfort  
Discomfort will be assessed by [CONTACT_1720] a designee using a predefined discomfort 
rating scale.  The evaluator will ask the subject, “Are you experiencing any discomfort related to 
the patch?”  If the answer is no, the overall level of discomfort will be rated as 0.  If the answer is 
yes, the evaluator will then ask the subject to rate the discomfort as mild, moderate, or s evere. 
Any discomfort mentioned should be recorded and rated as follows: 
• 0 = No discomfort 
• 1 = M ild discomfort 
• 2 = Mo derate but tolerable discomfort 
• 3 = Severe, intolerable discomfort 
• 4 = Patch not present 
 
During the Double-blind T reatment Phase at home, subjects will complete a questionnaire about 
discomfort in the eD iary. 
 
Adhesive Residue  
At each clinic visit, the amount of adhesive residue remaining at the application site where the 
previous patch was applied will be examined by [CONTACT_256390] a designee and scored 
according to the scale below:  Page 52 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 52 of 89 • 0 = None 
• 1 = Light 
• 2 = Medium 
• 3 = Heavy  
• 4 = Patch not present 
 
During the Double- blind T reatment Phase at home, subjects will complete a questionnaire about 
adhesive residue in the eD iary. 
10.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for the determination of plasma diclofenac concentrations will be collected at 
specified visits after the application of the study drug as per the Schedule of Event s in Section  
17.1.  A volume of approximately 4 mL of blood will be collected at Visit 4 (Day  14) a nd Visit 5 
(Day 28); or at the E arly Termination Visit, if applicable.  The LC/MS/MS validation method 
will be used to analyze the plasma sample to determine the diclofenac concentrations and blood sampling times will be recorded.  
 The total blood volume collected will be approximately 40 mL (inclusive of pharmacokinetic 
and clinical safety laboratory collections).  Page [ADDRESS_311552].  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, 
clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will NOT be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequen cy or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition during the Double-
blind Treatment Phase (Worsening of a pre-existing condition is considered an AE.). 
 
Events occurring in subjects treated with placebo will also  be considered AEs.  However, AEs 
reported during treatment -free periods before study drug  has been administered are not 
considered AEs; these events are captured on the eCRF as updates to the subject’s medical 
history. 
 
• All AEs encountered during the clinical study will be re ported on the eCRF. All AEs, 
regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from 
after the start of the study drug.  AEs in clinical investigation subjects include any change 
in the subject’s condition.  This includes symptoms, physical findings, or clinical 
syndromes. 
• An abnormal laboratory value may be considered an AE if the identified laboratory abnormality leads to any type of intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not.  It 
is up to the investigator to determine whether an abnormal laboratory value constitutes an 
AE.  If an abnormal laboratory value is caused by a disease process, the disease process 
and not the laboratory abnormality should be listed as the AE (e.g., if n ew onset viral 
hepatitis is causing elevated ALT, hepatitis and not the elevated ALT should be listed as the AE).  
• Examples of laboratory abnormalities, which should be considered as AEs include those 
which result in withdrawal of the study treatment, withh olding study treatment pending 
some investigational outcome, reduction of dose of the study treatment, or additional concomitant treatment.  All laboratory abnormalities considered to constitute an AE Page 54 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 54 of 89 should be reported on the appropriate AE page of the eC RF.  Laboratory abnormalities do 
not need to be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be part of a clinical 
syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
review all laboratory findings in all subjects .  Abnormal values should be commented 
upon as to clinical relevance or importance on the eCRF or the laboratory report as 
appropriate.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an 
isolated laboratory abnormality should be cl assified as an AE.  
• Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_256391].  
11.1.[ADDRESS_311553] ent with 
the current IB and Developmental  Core Safety Information . 
 Furthermore , reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, 
already documented adverse reactio n constitute unexpected events. 
11.1.3 Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life-threatening.  
NOTE :  The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject  was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
• Requires  inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
NOTE :  An elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] a dmission to treat a condition present before exposure to the test 
drug, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does NOT  qualify the 
condition or event as an SAE. 
• Results  in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
• Is a congenital anomaly . 
NOTE :  A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to study drug 
during pregnancy is an SAE.  However, a  newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has Page 55 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 55 of 89 received a study drug  is NOT  considered an SAE unless it is suspected that study drug 
interacted with a contraceptive m ethod and led to the pregnancy. 
• is an important medical event 
NOTE : Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256332].  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug dependency, or drug abuse. 
11.2. Management of Adverse Events  
Adverse events will be collected from the time of first dose administration  through the  Follow- up 
Visit or  Early Termination Visit, whicheve r occurs first.  
 Subjects who complete the Double-blind T reatment Phase or terminate early will continue to be 
monitored for AEs for [ADDRESS_311554] visit or evaluation.  The investigator will 
then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non- leading  questions, such as: 
• “How are you feeling?”  
• “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit? ” 
• “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?”  
11.2.2 Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered  
AEs. Evaluation 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events  
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as  
Mild  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or thera peutic 
intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
Moderate  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The event Page [ADDRESS_311555].  
Severe  Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, 
or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. 
 
It is important to distinguish betwee n severe AEs and SAEs.  Severity is a classification of 
intensity whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section  11.1.3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness  
The investigator i s to evaluate  whether the AE meets serious criteria , as described in 
Section  11.1.3. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action  Taken  
Action taken may consist of: 
Drug 
withdrawn  An indication that a medication schedule was modified through termination of 
a prescribed regimen of medication. 
Not applicable  Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome at the Time of Last Observation  
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as  follows: 
• Recovered/resolved  
• Recovered/resolved with sequelae  
• Recovering/resolving  
• Not recovered/not resolved 
• Fatal*  
• Unknown 
 
NOTE :  Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death.  If more than [ADDRESS_311556]’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such 
AE.  Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained 
death should be reported as SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make an assessment of each AE’s relationship to study drug .  The 
categories for classifying the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_256333]. Page 57 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 57 of 89 Not related  An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that ther e is no causal relationship to 
study drug  administration (e .g., no temporal relationship to drug 
administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; 
investigation shows that the drug was not adminis tered; another cause was 
proven). 
Unlikely related  An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to 
study drug  administration that makes a causal relationship improbable, and in 
which other drugs, events or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations. 
Possibly related  An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study drug , 
but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_256392]. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. 
Definitely 
Related  An AE occurring in a pl ausible time relationship to study drug  administration, 
and which cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or 
events.  The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinically 
reasonable.

is described in Section  11.2): 
• AE name [CONTACT_81620]  
• When the AE first occurred (start date and time)  
• When the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of “ongoing”) 
• Severity of the AE  
• Seriousness (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, etc.)

It is NOT  necessary to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment in most circumstances, even if 
an SAE has occurred. If unblinding is necessary, see Section  9.5 for a description of the 
unblinding procedures. 
11.2.5 Follow- up  
ALL ongoing S AEs at the time of discontinuation will be followed (up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_311560] dose of study medication) to a satisfactory resolution, or until it becomes stable, or  
until it can be explained by [CONTACT_256393]  (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and 
clinical judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted.  All ongoing AEs at the time 
of discontinuation will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_311561]’s medical record  and recorded on the e CRF  page . 
11.2.6 Reporting of Adver se Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator or designee must report all SAEs  promptly to  within [ADDRESS_311562] becoming aware of the event  by [CONTACT_12550] , signing and dating  the Serious Adverse

13.1. Study Endpoints  
13.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in WOMAC LK3.1 OA pain score from Baseline  
and Week 4. 
13.1.2 Secondary  Efficacy  Endpoints  
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (pain) – change between Baseline and Week  1, and Week 2  
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (stiffness)  between Baseline and Week  1, Week 2 , and Week 
4 
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (physical function)  between Baseline and Week  1, Week 2 , 
and Week 4  
• WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index ( composite score ) between Baseline and Week  1, Week 2 , 
and Week 4  
• Patient Global Assessment between Baseline and Week 4  
• Patient Global Impression of Change between Week 1  and Week 4  
• Pain intensity assessed on an 11- point NRS  between Baseline and Week  1, Week  2, and 
Week 4  
• Use of rescue medication  between Baseline and Week  1, Week 2 , and Week 4 
13.1.3 Safety Endpoints  
• Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation from the study drug, SAEs, and deaths. 
• Change from Baseline in clinical laboratory results ( including fasting glucose and total 
lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] [8 to 10 hours after fasting is required for these laboratory testing]), ECG results, 
body weight, and vital signs. 
• Dermal safety: adhesion, irritation, discomfort, and adhesive residue. 
13.1.4 Pharmacokinetics Endpoint  
Plasma concentrations of diclofenac (for both HP -5000  and HP -5000  on Day  14 
and 28 ( or at the Early Termination  Visit). 
13.2. Sample Size Determination  
Assuming an effect size of   on the 
change in WOMAC pain score from Baseline to Week  [ADDRESS_311569] size  or higher will be approximately 67% having 75 evaluable subjects per each 
active arm and 150 evaluable subjects in the placebo arm.  Having 3 treatment arms, the total 
number of subjects randomized in the study and included in the primary analysis set should be 
approximately 300.  A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize the proposed 
sample size.  
13.3. Analysis Populations 
The following 4 analysis populati ons are planned for this study: 
• Intent- to-Treat (ITT):  I ncludes all consented and randomized subjects.  Regardless of 
any protocol deviations, analyses performed on the ITT set will be based on the 
randomized treatment assignment and all available data.  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS):  I ncludes all randomized subjects who ha ve had at least [ADDRESS_311570] -baseline assessment of the primary efficacy measure (WOMAC pain score).  
Evaluable subjects will be defined as those who meet the FAS de finition.  The FAS will 
be used as the primary set for analysis of efficacy endpoints based on randomized treatment assignment.  
• Safety Analysis Set (SAF):  Includes all subjects who have had at least [ADDRESS_311571] 
occurred in treatment arm assignments, then analyses using the SAF will be based on 
treatment actually received.  The SAF will be u sed for the analysis of dermal evaluations 
and safety endpoints. 
• Pharmaco kinetic Analysis Set (PAS):  I ncludes all subjects who have received at least 
[ADDRESS_311572] that may influence the PK analysis, if any unexpected error occurs during the study 
that may influ ence the PK analysis (e.g., early detachment of transdermal systems, 
apparent sample switching, etc.) or if their data are unavailable or incomplete.  The PAS 
will be u sed for the analysis with model -based approach.  Excluded cases will be 
documented together with the reason for exclusion.  
Inclusion in the analysis populations will be determined prior to database lock.  Page [ADDRESS_311573] study drug , analyses of the 
ITT population will be based on the assigned treatment whereas all other analyses will be based 
on the actual treatment.  
13.4. Statistical Analyses 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses.   A Statistical Analysis Plan 
(SAP) that describes the  detail s of the analyses  to be conducted will be written prior to database 
lock.  Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of statistical significance will be 2-sided, and a 
difference resulting in a P value of <0.[ADDRESS_311574] deviation 
(SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  For categorical variables, these statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_256338]. 
13.4.1 Study Subjects and Demographics

The numbers of subjects randomized, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  The number of subjects and 
patches in each analysis population will be reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol Deviations 
A by -subject listing of all protocol deviations and violations will be reported  in Clinical Study 
Report. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and Other Baseline  Characteristics

13.4.3 Efficacy  Analyses 
Efficacy variables will be summarized and analyzed using the FAS population as primary , unless 
otherwise specified.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the change from Baseline to Week 4 in the 
WOMAC pain score; the primary analysis set is the FAS.  The comparisons of interest are:  
• HP-5000  versus placebo  
• HP-5000  versus  placebo  
 
The estimand in the primary analysis for efficacy for each dose is the difference between 
treatments groups (HP -5000 dose group vs. placebo) in the change from Baseline to Week 4 in 
WOMAC pain score in all subjects as randomized, under the assumption that all randomized patients remain on their randomized treatment throughout the study.  WOMAC scores obtained 
more than 24 hours after discontinuation of study drug will be excluded as a-priori defined 
outliers.  
 The primary efficacy variable, the change from Baseline to Week 4 in the WOMAC pain score 
will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.  The MMRM 
model will include change from B aseline in WOMAC pain score as the repeated dependen t 
variable, with treatment (HP -5000 , HP-5000  and placebo), visit, treatment- by-visit 
interaction, and the B aseline WOMAC pain score as covariates.  An unstructured covariance 
matrix will be assumed.  If the unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, a series of other 
covariance structures will be tested for use.

HP-5000- US-05 
12 January 2018 Final Amendment 2 .0 Page 68 of 89 The MMRM model may be repeated on additional analysis sets as a sensitivity analysis.  If the 
normality assumption is violated, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on rank- transforme d data 
will be used as utility analysis and additional supportive analyses may be performed. 
 
Other sensitivity analyses may be performed on the primary endpoint to assess the robustness of 
the results 
based on the model used for primary analysis.  These analyses  may include multiple 
imputation and pattern- mixture models for handling of missing data.  Details will be provided in 
the SAP.  The analyses will be performed according to the National Academy of Sciences (2010) 
guidelines.8 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analyses for Secondary Endpoint  
The secondary endpoints will use the change in mea n for analysis (as applicable):  
 Additional categorical response analyses may be performed; additional details will be provided 
in the SAP . 
13.4.4 Safety and Tolerability Analyses 
All safet y summaries will be descriptive; statistical significance tests may be performed on 
safety data that will be described in the SAP.  
 Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the safety population (as defined in 
Section  13.3).  Safety variables include AEs, clinical laboratory values, body weight, vital signs, 
ECG readings, physical examination results,  and dermal safety results .  No formal inferential 
analyses will be conducted for safety variables, unless otherwise noted. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events

the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulations and guidelines.  The assigned clinical research 
associates (CRAs) will visit the investigator and study site at periodic intervals and maintain 
periodic communication.  It will be the CRA's responsibility to inspect the eCRFs at regular 
intervals throughout the study, to verify the adherence to the protocol and the completeness, 
consistency and accuracy of the data being entered.   The investigator agrees to allow the CRAs 
and other authorized Noven personnel access.  The CRAs will maintain current personal 
knowledge of  the study through observation, review of study records and source documentation, 
and discussion of the conduct of the study with the investigator and staff.  While on site, the 
CRAs will review: 
• regulatory documents, directly comparing entries in the EDC system with the source 
documents 
• consenting procedures 
• laboratory test reports 
• other patient records and study documents 
• AE procedures , storage and accountability of study drug  and study materials  
 The CRA will ask for clarification and/or correctio n of any noted inconsistencies.  Procedures 
for correc ting eCRF are described in the study manual .  As representatives of the sponsor, CRAs 
are responsible for notifying project management of any noted protocol deviations. 
 
By [CONTACT_81593]’s Ag reement (see Section  17.2) , the investigator agrees : 
• to meet with the CRAs during study site visits ;

The SAF will be used for the analysis of dermal evaluations an d safety 
endpoints.  
 
 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS):  Will include  all subjects who have 
received at least [ADDRESS_311608] 1 blood sample for pharmacokinetic ( PK) assessment.  
Subjects may be excluded from the PAS set if they significantly violate 
inclusion or exclusion criteria, significantly violate the protocol in a way that 
may influence the PK analysis, if any unexpected error occurs during the 
study that m ay influence the PK analysis ( e.g., early detachment of 
transdermal systems, apparent sample switching, etc.) or if their data are 
unavailable or incomplete.  The PAS will be u sed for the analysis with 
model -based approach.  Excluded cases will be documented together with the 
reason fo r exclusion.  
 
Primary Efficacy Analysis :  The primary efficacy endpoint of this study  is the 
change from Baseline to Week 4 in the WOMAC pain score; the primary analysis set 
is the FAS.  The comparisons of interest are:  
 HP-5000  versus placebo  
 HP-5000  versus placebo  
 
The estimand in the primary analysis for efficacy for each dose is the difference 
between treatments groups (HP -5000 dose group vs. placebo) in the change from 
Baseline to Week [ADDRESS_311609] is approximately 9 weeks.  Page 99 of 246

22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 16 of 87 5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background and Rationale 
An estimated 52.5 mill
ion adults (22.7% of the population)1 in the [LOCATION_002] ( US) have 
doctor-diagnosed osteoarthritis (OA); 22.7 million (9.8% of all adults) have arthritis and 
arthri tis-attributable activity limitations.  Based on these data, it is projected that 78 million 
(26%) adults aged [ADDRESS_311615] doctor-diagnosed arthritis by [CONTACT_2892] 2040.2  
Patients with arthritis are encouraged to be active, since it has been shown that exercise and 
activity help to decrease pain associated with OA, improve function, and delay disability.  
However activity and exercise are often limited by [CONTACT_256364], and this 
pain may become part of a cycle of inactivity and weight gain that tends to perpetuate the 
stiffness and disability associated with OA.  Additionally, oral medications used over time may 
cause gastrointestinal (GI) distress and interfere with the blood-clotting cycle.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_256317]; 
patients may also become dependent on their opi[INVESTIGATOR_256347], thereby [CONTACT_256365].  There is an unmet need for a safe, reliable, and effective pain 
medication without the risk and lack of efficacy associated with those currently available. 
 
Diclofenac sodium is from 
the phenylacetic acid class of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug 
(NSAIDs) developed by [CONTACT_256366]., Ltd., Switzerland, in 1965.  In the US, diclofenac 
sodium is available in various dose forms, including tablet, eye drop, extended-release tablet, gel, 
patch, capsule, and solution.  The mechanism of action of NSAIDs is not completely understood 
but may be related to prostaglandin synthetase (cyclooxygenase [COX]-1 and COX -2) inhibition.  
 
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has started the development of a formulation of d iclofenac sodiu m 
for topi[INVESTIGATOR_256319] a transdermal patch system, the HP-5000  for the treatment of pain 
of OA of the knee(s).  The topi[INVESTIGATOR_256320] [ADDRESS_311616] potential benefits compared with the existing formulations, as 
follows: 
 Transfer of drug into the treatment target area resulting in lower systemic and GI 
exposure when compared to orally administered diclofenac sodium and a possible 
reduction of systemic side effects including GI ulcers/lesions and adverse reactions such 
as nausea, vomiting, dyspepsia, and stomach pain.  
 Improvement of compliance with  compared with existing topi[INVESTIGATOR_256321].  Page [ADDRESS_311617] been completed 
with various formulations of the diclofenac transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS), 
evaluating the PK and tolerability in 104 healthy volunteers.  The lead formulations for this 
program, HP 5000  and HP 5000  both of which contain  
diclofenac sodium  with a patch size of   were selected based on the diclofenac 
pharmacokinetic profile and patch performance characteristics, such as irritation and adhesion on 
the mobile knee joint application site. 
 
It should be noted that the HP 5000 formulation is also being developed  by [CONTACT_256367]’s 
parent company,  for different  indications 
(i.e.,  and  and is referred to as the  (also known as

22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 21 of 87 7. STUDY DESIGN 
7.1. Overall Study Design and Plan - Description 
This is a 4 -week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled phase 2 study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of HP-5000  comp ared with that of placebo in the 
treatment of OA.  The study will run for approximately 9  weeks comprised of up to a maximum 
of 28 -day Screening Phase that will include a Washout Period of up to a maximum 14 days, a 4-
week Treatment Phase, and a 1-week Follow-u p Period.   Subjects will be randomly assigned to 
receive  one of the following 3 treatments in a 1:1:2 ratio :  HP-5000   HP- 5000 -
  or placebo patch, respectively.   The placebo patch will be identical in appearance 
to the 2 HP-5000 active patches.  The total number of subjects randomized in the study and 
included in the primary analysis will be approximately 300 . 
 
The duration of double-blind treatment is expected to be 4  weeks and the total time in the study 
will be approximately 9  weeks. 
 
 Screening/Washout Period : Visit 1 (up to 28 Days): Screening and start of baseline 
diary (BL): After signing the informed consent, the Screening Phase will begin.   Subjects 
whose preliminary entry criteria have been met will be contact[CONTACT_256417] -[ADDRESS_311618] 3 consecutive days immediately prior to the Baseline Visit will be 
calculated for subjects to be considered eligible for study participation.   During the 
Washout Period, rescue medication (acetaminophen [APAP]) will be permitted (a 
maximum of 2 g/day) except within 2 calendar days prior to the Baseline Visit (i. e., 
rescue medication is prohibited from Day-2 until clinic visit on Day 0). 
 
 Baseline Visit:  Visit 2 ( 0 Day):  Subjects will be reevaluated according to the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and the average patient diary pain score will be calculated.  Those 
subjects who continue to meet all of the inclusion criteria, none of the exclusion criteria, 
who have completed the patient diary for at least [ADDRESS_311619] 5 will be randomized to receive 
one of 2 formulation of HP-5000  or placebo. Page 111 of 246

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 22 of 87  
 Double-blind Treatment Phase :  On Day 1 of the Treatment Phase, subjects will start 
applying their assigned patch for 4 Weeks (from Week 5 through 8 ):  Subjects will be 
randomized to receive either HP-5000  patch, HP- 5000  patch, or placebo 
patch.  Dose modifications will NOT  be permitted.  Subjects who cannot tolerate their 
designated study drug dose will be withdrawn from the study. 
 
 Follow-up Period:  Visit 6 (Week 9):  After the 4-week Treatment Phase, the study 
center will conduct a follow-up phone call for safety monitoring or based on the 
investigator’s judgment, a subject may return to the study center for the safety Follow-u p 
Visit. 
 
All subjects will be contact[CONTACT_256418], general well-being, provide 
visit reminders, and reinforce diary record and treatment compliance.  Dose modifications will 
NOT  be permitted and study procedures will be reinforced. 
 
At each study visit, subjects will undergo efficacy and safety evaluations.  Efficacy evaluations 
will include the change from baseline values in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities 
(WOMAC) LK3.1 OA index for pain, stiffness,  physical function,  and composite score, the 
Patient Global Assessment, the Patient Global Impression of Change, and pain intensity assessed 
on an 11-point NRS and the subjects’ use of rescue medication. 
 
Safety evaluation 
will include collection of AE s, physical examination findings, vital sign 
measurements, electrocardiogram (ECGs), clini cal laboratory test results, and body weight.   All 
AEs observed by [CONTACT_256419] (from the time 
of study drug administration through the post treatment visit) will be documented.  
 
Dermal characteristi
cs will be assessed by [ADDRESS_311620]
ing will be performed as scheduled.  Plasma concentrations of 
diclofenac will be assessed by [CONTACT_256371] 14 and 28  (or at the Early 
Termination Visit).   Study center personnel will also assess study drug and diary compliance.

In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, 
Republic of South Africa, October 1996), subjects have the right to withdraw participation from 
the study at any time for any reason.  Every reasonable attempt should be made by [CONTACT_256420]; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if 
they withdraw consent to participate.  Investigators must make at least [ADDRESS_311631] 
subjects who fail to attend scheduled visits by [CONTACT_30100]. 
 
The investigator also has the right to remove subjects from the study.  Subjects may be removed 
from the study for the following reasons: 
 Adverse events:  If the reason for removal of a subject from the study is an AE, the 
principal specific event and any related test results will be recorded on the electronic case 
report form (eCRF).  If a subject withdraws because of an AE plus another reason, the 
withdrawal will be considered due to the AE and the eCRF will be completed to reflect 
this reason for withdrawal.  A narrative description will be required for all early 
withdrawals due to AEs. 
 The request of the subject, his/her representative, investigator or sponsor, whether for 
administrative or other reasons. 
 Noncompliance with study drug or non-compliance with subject diary completion, 
protocol violation, or unreliable behavior. 
 Pregnancy.  If the subject becomes pregnant during the clinical study, the study drug 
should be stopped immediately and the subject withdrawn from the study. 
 
If a subject is withdrawn early from the study,  the following will be performed: 
 The date of the last dose of study drug and all observations collected up to the time of 
termination will be recorded on the Early Withdrawal eCRF page along with the reason 
for termination.  All Early Withdrawal procedures should be completed and recorded on 
the Early Withdrawal eCRF page.  If withdrawal occurs at a regularly scheduled visit, the 
Early Withdrawal eCRF page should be used instead of the regular visit eCRF page to 
record any information related to the visit.  
 In order to enable the most complete recording of any subject who withdraws early from 
the study, it is important to evaluate these subjects at the study center as soon as possible.  
Subjects who are withdrawing early should undergo an Early Withdrawal Visit and a 
Follow-Up Visit must be scheduled.

condition worsens during the study,  or for safety reasons, as determined by [CONTACT_093].  
Subjects may also be withdrawn due to lack of compliance with the protocol or if the subject is 
unwilling to continue participation in the study. 
8.3. Subject Replacement Criteria 
Subjects who withdraw after randomization and the application of the first treatment patch will 
not be replaced. Page [ADDRESS_311633] be available for monitoring, auditing, or inspection.  Section 9.8 
details the accountability of clinical supplies through the use of a Drug Dispensing Log. 
9.2. Treatments Administered 
HP-5000 will be administered  for a maximum of 28 ± 2 days. 
The treatment arms for th
is study are the following: 
Treatment Arm   Treatment  
HP-5000   One patch applied to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
HP-5000  One patch applied  to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
Placebo  One patch applied  to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
Patch Application 
A separate guidance for patch application will be provided to subjects for applying, securing, and 
removing the patch. 
9.3. Dispensing and Storage 
Study drug supplied by  [CONTACT_256421].  The investigator is responsible for 
dispensing study drug according to the dosage scheme and for ensuring proper storage of study 
drug. 
The
 investigator must confirm the receipt of study drug with his/her signature.  A copy of this 
receipt must be kept by [CONTACT_093],  and another copy will be stored at Noven  
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (hereafter referred to as “Noven”), and/or   Until study 
drug is dispensed to the subjects, it must be stored at 25°C and in a dry place in a securely locked 
area that is not gen
erally accessible. 
All 
study drug supplies must be stored in a secure locked area with access limited to the 
investigator or those persons authorized by [CONTACT_256422].   Study drug should be stored as per the label. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
In this parallel-group randomized study, subjects who meet study entry criteria will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1:2  ratios to receive HP-5000 HP-5000  or placebo patches.  The 
ra
ndomization numbers will be assigned sequentially through a central interactive voice response Page 122 of 246

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 33 of 87 system (IVRS) as subjects who met eligibility criteria are enrolled into the study.  The study 
center will not be a blocking factor in the randomization schedule.   At designated visits, subject s 
will be given a kit containing sufficient study drug to last until the next scheduled study visit. 
 
The randomization schedule will be prepared by  [CONTACT_81563].  
No one involved in the clinical conduct will have access to the randomization schedule before 
official unblinding of treatment assignment.  No subject will be randomized into this study more 
than once. 
9.5. Blinding and Unblinding Treatment Assignment 
To protect the blind,  placebo patch es will be identical in appearance to the HP-[ADDRESS_311634] of the study, including 
data management, will be blinded to treatment assignment with the exception of a prespecified 
unblinded statistician/programmer from  who will have access to the 
randomization code.  The unblinded study personnel will not participate in study procedures or 
data analysis prior to unblinding of the study data to all study related personnel.  If an interim 
analysis is to be conducted, then unblinded personnel who are not otherwise involved in the 
study will prepare the data for review. 
 
Study personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize bias in 
the conduct of the study.  Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment 
assignment will not materially change the planned management of a medical emergency.  
Unblinding will be permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the 
subject’s treatment assignment. 
 
In the case of a medical emergency, to appropriately treat the subject,  study drug will need to be 
unblinded.  The investigator may break the randomization code for an individual subject.  
However, the investigator should make every effort to discuss the unblinding of the subject with 
the medical monitor prior to unblinding whenever possible. 
 
If the investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, then he/she must notify 
the medical monitor immediately of the blind breaking incident without revealing the subject’s 
treatment assignment. 
 Page 123 of 246

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 34 of 87 In all such cases, the AE necessitating the emergency blind break will be handled as an SAE in 
accordance with the procedures indicated above.  Any broken code will be clearly justified, 
explained by a comment on the appropriate eCRF page along with the date and reason for study 
discontinuation ; and captured on the SAE Form. 
 
The investigator or designee must record the date and reason for unblinding or study 
discontinuation on the appropriate eCRF for that subject.  In all cases that are not emergencies, 
the investigator must discuss the event with the medical monitor prior to unblinding the subject’ s 
treatment assignment. 
 
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subject’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the 
remaining subjects in the study.  Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised.  If a 
subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from 
the study.  The investigator will make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor. 
9.6. Selection of Doses and Administration in the Study 
The dose of diclofenac  in a patch size of   applied  and rotated between 
 on the knee (inner and outer knee ) is based on the following considerations: 
  
 
 Dose that targets diclofenac exposure after HP-5000 patch application that is similar to 
that of registered topi[INVESTIGATOR_2855] d iclofenac products and considerably lower than that of oral 
diclofenac tablets.  
 
The data from previous studies investigating irritation and PK support the proposed dose of 
 and a patch size of   applied  and rotated between  on the kne e 
for the lead formulations (HP-5000  and HP- 5000  
9.7. Dose Adjustment Criteria 
Dose adjustment is NOT  allowed in this study. 
9.8. Drug Accountability 
The investigator (or pharmacist, as appropriate) must maintain adequate records of the receipt 
and conditions of all study drugs, dispensing, return, or other disposition of study drug including 
the date, quantity dispensed to each subject, batch or code number, identification of subjects Page 124 of 246

22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 35 of 87 (subject number [and initials]) who received study drug and any reasons for departure from the 
protocol-dispensing regimen.  Receipt of study drug must also be confirmed within IVRS.  The 
drug accountabilit
y records, along with used and unused packaging must be available for 
monitoring, auditing, or inspection.  Each site must keep accurate records of drug received at 
site, dispensed to the subjects. 
 
The investigator will not supply study drug to any person except those named as sub-
investigators (on the Form FDA 1572 ), designated study personnel, and subjects in this study.  
The investigator will not dispense study drug from any study sites other than those listed (on the 
Form FDA 1572 ). 
 
Study drug may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by [CONTACT_23837].  If any of study drugs is 
either not dispensed,  lost, stolen, unusable,  or is received in a damaged container, this 
information must be documented and reported to Noven  and appropriate regulatory agencies, as 
required. 
 
At the completion of the study, a final reconciliation of all study drugs (used and unused) must 
performed and returned to the sponsor (or designated location).  The unused study drug must be 
left in the original packaging and returned to the sponsor (or designee) for destruction. 
9.9. Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance with study drug regimens will be assessed by [CONTACT_256377], patch application, removal and by [CONTACT_256378], if 
necessary, at every post-randomization visit.  Treatment compliance will also be calculated as 
the number of patches applied divided by [CONTACT_256379] a given period, 
expressed as a percentage.  
 
At Visits 3 through 5 or any Early Termination Visit, the study drug (patches) from the previous 
Treatment Phase will be returned to the investigator.  The study drug will be inventoried and 
noncompliance defined as using less than 80% or more than 120% of study drug during any 
evaluation period (visit to visit).  If the subject is noncompliant, the Medical Advisor should be 
contact[CONTACT_256380]’s eligibility to continue in the study . 
 
The subject must be counseled if compliance is not satisfactory (used 6 or less patches per 
week).  If a subject has been noncompliant on two consecutive visits, the subject may be 
withdrawn early from the study for non-compliance. Page [ADDRESS_311635] their daily 
intake/use of rescue medication/study drug in the diary .  Deviations from the planned doses 
(overdose, missed dose or timing) will be recorded on the subjects’ eCRF.  These diaries will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_256423].  
Information from that subject diary will be transcribed on the appropriate eCRF pages for 
documentation of subject compliance with study drug.   Compliance will include the following: 
 
1. Telephone follow-up: A telephone follow-up call will be performed between Screening 
(Visit 1) and Baseline (Visit 2), before the start of the Washout Period and another one 
during the Follow-up Period.  
 
2. Patient Education: At all study visits, the investigator will explain the importance of the 
following:  
 
a. applying study medication  to the target knee after 
showering/bathing;  
b. recording patient diary information every day; 
c. accurately reporting pain; 
d. accurately reporting rescue medication use; 
e. understanding when to return for next visit and the importance of returning on 
schedule; and 
f. adhering to the overall research plan. 
 
During Screening (Visit 1), the investigator will provide the subject with an introduction to 
the various questionnaires that will be used during the study and the patient diary.  
 
3. Patient Dairy (e-Diary):   The patient diary will be used by [CONTACT_256382]/removal, the NRS scores, the use of 
rescue medication, and questionnaires about adhesion, skin irritation, discomfort and 
adhesive residue.  
 
4. Rescue Medication:   If needed, patients will be allowed to take up to 2 grams of 
acetaminophen per day as rescue medication for pain of the target and/or the non-target 
knee.  Information regarding the use of rescue medication will be recorded on the 
appropriate concomitant medication eCRF.  Page [ADDRESS_311636] 7 days ; however, rescue medication 
(acetaminophen [APAP]) is permitted during the Washout Period if required.  A maximum of 
2 g/day of APAP will be allowed for rescue treatment of both target and non -target knee pain 
except within the 2 calendar days prior to the Baseline V isit (i. e., rescue medication is prohibited 
from Day -2 until clinic visit on Day 0) and within the 1 calendar day prior to each clinic visit 
(e.g., rescue medication is prohibited from Day [ADDRESS_311637] will 
visit the study site on Day 7).  APAP will be provided by [CONTACT_1034].  Subjects are NOT 
allowed to apply study treatment drug ( HP-5000/Placebo) on the non-target knee at any time 
during the study period. 
 
All concomitant medications used (including OTC medications and herbal supplements) will be 
recorded in the source document and on the appropriate e CRF  page. 
9.10.1 Permitted Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256350], chondroitin, and antidepressants (for indication of depression) will be allowed if 
used as stable therapy for at least 90 days prior to Screening Visit.  Other concomitant 
medications for treatment of ongoing medical conditions are allowed, but should be limited to 
those medications considered necessary in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871]. 
9.10.2  Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256351] (selective or nonselective), any opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], APAP (>2 g/day), ASA (>81  mg/day), 
corticosteroids (a stable does by [CONTACT_256383]/or topi[INVESTIGATOR_256328]) , anticonvulsants (i.e. , pregabalin and gabapentin etc. ), 
muscle relaxants, other oral analgesics (prescription and/or OTC ), antidepressants prescribed for 
the control of chronic pain syndromes, antihistamine with a sedative effect, sedatives for 
insomnia,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_256329], camphor, menthol, 
methylsulfonylmethane,  or capsaicin, any intra-articular treatments for the knee, any 
nonpharmaceutical therapy or device to relieve knee pain (including physiotherapy, massage 
therapy, hot wax therapy etc.) may not be taken during the study. 
 
Note :  Glucosamine, chondroitin, and antidepressants (for the indication of depression) will be 
allowed if used as stable therapy for 90 days prior to Screening Visit.  However, if in use for 
fewer than 90 days, these drugs will be considered as prohibited concomitant medications and 
will require a Washout Period.  Page 127 of 246

10.2. Assessments 
10.2.1 Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS] Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Likert (LK) version 3.[ADDRESS_311648] recent version of this instrument for the assessment of hip and knee OA.  The WOMAC 
Osteoarthritis Index is widely used to measure pain, stiffness, and physical function in subjects 
with OA pain.  It is considered to be a reliable and valid instrument.5,6,7 
The WOMAC Pain  scale evaluates the following 5 items: 
Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being no difficulty and 4 being extreme difficulty. 
The WOMAC Stiffness  scale assesses 2 items: 
Ea
ch item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being no difficulty and 4 being extreme difficulty. 
The WOMAC Physical Function  assesses the following categories using the 0 to 4 scale 
described previously: Page [ADDRESS_311649] commonly calculated by [CONTACT_256389] 3 
subscales.  Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional 
limitations.  The total score is calculated as follows: Total score= __/96= __% 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Assessment 
The PGA is a self-administered instrument that measures the subject’s overall impression of their 
OA pain in their target knee on a 5-point scale where 0  = “Very Good” and 4  = “Very Poor”. 
Subjects will be asked the complete the following statement: 
“How would you rate your osteoarthritis condition over the last 24 hours?” 
The response options include the following: 
 Very Good  0 
 Good  1 
 Moderate  2 
 Poor  3 
 Very Poor  4 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Impression of Change 
The Patient Global Impression of Change is a self-administered instrument that measures change 
in subjects’ overall improvement with treatment on a scale where 1 = “very much improved” and 
7 = “very much worse.”  Subjects will be asked the following question:  “How would you rate 
your overall improvement with treatment during the clinical trial?”  The response options include 
the following: Page 135 of 246

[IP_ADDRESS] Numeric Rating Scale 
The NRS is an 11-point scale from 0 to 10. On this scale, 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain 
imaginable.  NRS will be assessed in two  ways.  One is the average pain condition over the last 
[ADDRESS_311650] will rate his or her target knee pain intensity using the following question:  “On a 
scale from 0 to 10, where “zero” represents “no pain” and “10” represents “the worst possible 
pain,” how would you rate the pain that you have been feeling in your knee over the last 24 
hours?” 
Note: 
1. The NRS pain score for assessment is an average of the NRS pain scores reported for
pain over the last [ADDRESS_311651] 3 days prior to washout start (Phone Visit 1)
and Baseline (Visit 2) is required.
[IP_ADDRESS] Use of Rescue Medication

The definitions and management of and special considerations for AEs are provided in 
Section 11. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluations of Patch and Dermal Assessment 
Patch Adhesion  
Patch adhesion will be assessed in two ways (in-clinic and at-home).  At each clinic visit, patch 
adhesion will be assessed by [CONTACT_1720] a designee using the following 5-point numerical 
scale: 
• 0 = ≥90% adhered (essentially no lift off the skin). 
• 1 = ≥75% to <90% adhered (some edges only lifting off of the skin). 
• 2 = ≥50% to <75% adhered (less than half of the system lifting off of the skin) . 
• 3 = <50% adhered but not detached (more than half the system lifting off of the skin 
without falling off). 
• 4 = patch detached (patch completely off the skin).  
During the Treatment Phase at home, subjects will report on any incidence of  patch detachment 
in the diary. 
 
Irritation 
At each clinic visit, the application site where the previous patch was applied will be examined 
for signs of skin irritation.  All subjects will be evaluated by a trained investigator or designee 
using the Berger and Bowman scale (Berger and Bowman 1982) as described below. 
 
Half grades will not be assigned if reactions fall between the unit grades, rather, the more severe 
of the 2 grades will be assigned. 
 
Dermal Response 
• 0 = no evidence of irritation 
• 1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible 
• 2 = definite erythema, readily visible; minimal ed ema or minimal papular response 
• 3 = erythema and papules 
• 4 = definite edema 
• 5 = erythema, edema, and papules 
• 6 = vesicular eruption 
• 7 = strong reaction spreading beyond the application site

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 50 of 87 Other Effects  
• A = slightly glazed appearance 
• B = marked glazed appearance 
• C = glazing with peeling and cracking 
• F = glazing with fissures 
• G = film of dried serous exudates covering all or part of the patch site 
• H = small petechial erosions and/or scabs 
• N = no other observations 
 
Dermal response score will be rated on a 0 to 7 scale, whereby 0 is rated as “No evidence of 
irritation” and 7 is rated as “Strong reaction spreading beyond test (application) site.” 
 
Other effects will be scored via a letter scale and a corresponding numeric scale, whereby N (0) 
is rated as “No effects” and H (3) is rated as “Small petechial erosions and/or scabs.” 
 
During the treatment phase at home, subjects will complete a questionnaire about skin irritation 
in the diary. 
 
Discomfort 
Discomfort will be assessed by [CONTACT_1720] a designee using a predefined discomfort 
rating scale.  The evaluator will ask the subject, “Are you experiencing any discomfort related to 
the patch?”  If the answer is no, the overall level of discomfort will be rated as 0.  If the answer is 
yes, the evaluator will then ask the subject to rate the discomfort as mild, moderate, or severe. 
Any discomfort mentioned should be recorded and rated as follows: 
• 0 = No discomfort 
• 1 = Mild discomfort 
• 2 = Moderate but tolerable discomfort 
• 3 = Severe, intolerable discomfort 
• 4 = Patch not present 
During the Treatment Phase at home, subjects will complete a questionnaire about discomfort in 
the diary. 
 
Adhesive Residue  
At each clinic visit, the amount of adhesive residue remaining at the application site where the 
previous patch was applied will be examined by [CONTACT_1720] a designee and score d 
according to the scale below: Page 140 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 51 of 87 • 0 = None 
• 1 = Light 
• 2 = Medium 
• 3 = Heavy 
• 4 = Patch not present 
During the treatment phase at home, subjects will complete a questionnaire about adhesive 
residue in the diary. 
10.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Blood samples for the determination of plasma diclofenac concentrations will be collected at 
specified visits after the application of the study drug as per the Schedule of Events in attachment 
17.1.  A volume of approximately 4 mL of blood will be collected at Visit 4 (Day 14) and Visit 5 
(Day 28); or at the Early Termination Visit, if applicable.  The LC/MS/MS validation method 
will be used to analyze the plasma sample to determine the diclofenac concentrations and blood 
sampling times will be recorded. 
 
The total blood volume collected will be approximately 40 mL (inclusive of pharmacokinetic 
and clinical safety laboratory collections). Page [ADDRESS_311656].  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, 
clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will N OT be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition during the Treatment 
Phase (Worsening of a pre-existing condition is considered an AE.). 
 
Events occurring in subjects treated with placebo are also considered AEs.  However, AEs 
reported during treatment-free periods before study drug has been administered are not 
considered AEs; these events are captured on the eCRF as updates to the subject’s medical 
history. 
 
 All AEs encountered during the clinical study will be reported on the e CRF . All AEs, 
regardless of relationship to study drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from 
after the start of the study drug.  AEs in clinical investigation subjects include any change 
in the subject’s condition.  This includes symptoms, physical findings, or clinical 
syndromes. 
 An abnormal laboratory value may be considered an AE if the identified laboratory 
abnormality leads to any type of intervention whether prescribed in the protocol or not.  It 
is up to the investigator to determine whether an abnormal laboratory value constitutes an 
AE.  If an abnormal laboratory value is caused by a disease process, the disease process 
and not the laboratory abnormality should be listed as the AE (e.g., if new onset viral 
hepatitis is causing elevated ALT, hepatitis and not the elevated ALT should be listed as 
the AE). 
 Examples of laboratory abnormalities, which should be considered as AEs include those 
which result in withdrawal of the study treatment, withholding study treatment pending 
some investigational outcome, reduction of dose of the study treatment, or additional 
concomitant treatment.  All laboratory abnormalities considered to constitute an AE Page 142 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 53 of 87 should be reported on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF.  Laboratory abnormalities do 
not need to be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be part of a clinical 
syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
review all laboratory findings in all subjects.  Abnormal values should be commented 
upon as to clinical relevance or importance on the eCRF or the laboratory report as 
appropriate.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an 
isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an AE. 
 Every effort must be made by [CONTACT_3190]. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_311657].  For a study drug, the known information is contained in the IB which includes 
the HP-5000 Developmental Core Safety Information.  
 
An unexpected adverse event is one for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with 
the current IB and Developmental Core Safety Information.  
 
Furthermore,  reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, 
already documented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events. 
11.1.3 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 results in death 
 is life-threatening.  
NOTE:   The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
NOTE:   An elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88909] a condition present before exposure to the test 
drug, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does NOT  qualify the 
condition or event as an SAE.  
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
 Is a congenital anomaly. 
NOTE :  A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to study drug 
during pregnancy is an SAE.  However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has Page 143 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 54 of 87 received a study drug is NOT  considered an SAE unless it is suspected that study drug 
interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy. 
 is an important medical event 
NOTE:  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117112].  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias,  or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug dependency,  or drug abuse.  
11.2. Management of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be collected from the time of first dose administration through the  Follow- up 
Visit or Early Termination Visit, whichever occurs first. 
 
Subjects who complete the Treatment Phase or terminate early will continue to be monitored for 
AEs for [ADDRESS_311658] visit or evaluation.  The investigator will 
then monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using non-leading questions, such as: 
 “How are you feeling?” 
 “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?” 
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?” 
Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered AEs. 
 
11.2.2 Evaluation 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events 
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as 
Mild  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatmen t or therapeutic 
intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  Page [ADDRESS_311659].  
Severe  Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, 
or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . 
 
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs.  Severity is a classification of 
intensity whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section 11.1.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness 
The investigator is to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria, as described in 
Section 11.1.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken 
Action taken may consist of: 
Drug 
withdrawn  An indication that a medication schedule was modified through termination of 
a prescribed  regimen of medication.  
Not applicable  Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome at the Time of Last Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as follows: 
 Recovered/resolved 
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae 
 Recovering/resolving 
 Not recovered/not resolved 
 Fatal* 
 Unknown  
Note :  Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death.  If more than [ADDRESS_311660]’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such 
AE.  Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained 
death should be reported as SAEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make an assessment of each AE’s relationship to study drug .  The 
categories for classifying the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_256333].  Page 145 of 246
Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 56 of 87 Not related  An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that ther e is no causal rel ationship to 
study drug  administration (e .g., no temporal relationship to drug 
administration, because the drug was administered after onset of event; 
investigation shows that the drug was not adminis tered; another cause was 
proven ). 
Unlikely related  An A E, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to 
study drug  administration that makes a causal relationship improbable, and in 
which other drugs, events or underlying disease provide plausible 
explanations.  
Possibly related  An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study drug , 
but which could also be explained by [CONTACT_256392]. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Definitely 
Related  An AE occurring in a plausi ble time relationship to study drug  administration, 
and which cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or 
events.  The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinically 
reasonable.

eCRF with the following information; where appropriate (The period of observation for the study 
is described in Section 11.2): 
 AE name [CONTACT_81620] 
 When the AE first occurred (start date and time) 
 When the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of “ongoing”) 
 Severity of the AE 
 Seriousness (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, etc.) 
 Actions taken

the specific study drug, such as the collection of a serum sample for determining blood 
concentrations of study drug, or treatment regimens, as appropriate. 
 
It is NOT  necessary to unblind a subject’s treatment assignment in most circumstances, even if 
an SAE has occurred. If unblinding is necessary, see Section  9.5 for a description of the 
unblinding procedures. 
11.2.5 Follow- up  
ALL ongoing S AEs at the time of discontinuation will be followed (up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_311664] dose of study medication) to a satisfactory resolution, or until it becomes stable, or 
until it can be explained by [CONTACT_256393] (i.e., concurrent condition or medication) and 
clinical judgment indicates that further evaluation is not warranted.  All ongoing AEs at the time 
of discontinuation will be followed for up to [ADDRESS_311665]’s medical record and recorded on the e CRF  page. 
11.2.6 Reporting of Adver se Events  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator or designee must report all SAEs promptly to  within [ADDRESS_311666] becoming aware of the event by [CONTACT_12550], signing and dating the Serious Adverse 
Event Report Form, verifying the accuracy of the information recorded in the form with the 
source documents and eCRF, and sending the SAE form to the sponsor by [CONTACT_256394]: 
  
All SAEs, irrespective of relationship to study treatment, must be reported as soon as 
possible but no later than 1 business day by [CONTACT_58233]:

22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 58 of 87 It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completely as possible at the time of 
the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality.  All SAEs must be 
followed to resolution, or if resolution is unlikely, to stabilization.  Any follow-up information 
received on serious adverse events should be forwarded within one business day of its receipt.  If 
the follow-up information changes the investigator’s assessment of causality, this should also be 
noted on the follow-up SAE form. 
 
SAEs, regardless of causality assessment, must be collected through the Termination Visit and 
for [ADDRESS_311667] notification, the investigator or designee should provide the following information,  if

follow-up SAE Report Form, together with the following information (adverse event, date of 
occurrence, subject ID, study ID, study drug, and site number) including copi[INVESTIGATOR_5913], autopsy reports and other documents requested by [CONTACT_456]; this will allow the 
follow-up information to be linked to the initial SAE report. 
 
The investigator is required to comply with applicable regulations (including local laws and 
guidances) regarding the notification of his/her health authorities, institutional review board 
(IRB), principal and coordinating investigators, study investigators, and institutions.

22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 63 of 87 13. STATISTICAL METHODS 
13.1. Study Endpoints 
13.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change in WOMAC LK3.1 OA pain score from Baseline 
and Week 4. 
13.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (pain) – change between Baseline and Week 1, and Week 2 
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (stiffness) 
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (physical function) 
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (composite score) 
 Patient Global Assessment 
 Patient Global Impression of Change 
 Pain intensity assessed on an 11-point NRS 
 Use of rescue medication 
13.1.3 Safety Endpoints 
 Adverse events, AEs leading to discontinuation from the study drug, SAEs, and deaths. 
 Change from baseline in clinical laboratory results (including fasting glucose and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805]), 
ECG results, body weight, and vital signs. 
 Dermal safety: adhesion, irritation, discomfort, and adhesive residue . 
13.1.4 Pharmacokinetics Endpoint 
Plasma concentrations of diclofenac (for both HP-5000  and HP-5000  on Day 14 
and 28 (or at the Early Termination Visit). 
13.2. Sample Size Determination 
Assuming an effect size of   on the 
change in WOMAC pain score from baseline to Week [ADDRESS_311674] size  or higher will be approximately 67% having 75 evaluable subjects per each 
active arm and 150 evaluable subjects in the placebo arm.   Having 3 treatment arms, the total 
number of subjects randomized in the study and included in the primary analysis set should be Page 153 of 246

Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Confidential  
HP-5000- US-05 
22 May 2017 Final Amendment 1.0 Page 64 of 87 approximately 300 .  A sufficient number of subjects will be screened to randomize the proposed 
sample size. 
13.3. Analysis Populations 
The following 4  analysis populations are planned for this study: 
 Intent- to-Treat (ITT):  Includes all consented and randomized subjects. Regardless of any 
protocol deviations, analyses performed on the ITT set will be based on the randomized 
treatment assignment and all available data. 
 Full Analysis Set (FAS):  Includes all randomized subjects who have had at least [ADDRESS_311675]-Baseline assessment of the primary efficacy measure (WOMAC pain score).  
Evaluable subjects will be defined as those who meet the FAS definition.  The FAS will 
be used as the primary set for analysis of efficacy endpoints based on randomized 
treatment assignment. 
 Safety Analysis Set (SAF):  Includes all subjects who have had at least [ADDRESS_311676] 
occurred in treatment arm assignments, then analyses using the SAF will be based on 
treatment actually received.  The SAF will be used for the analysis of dermal evaluations 
and safety endpoints. 
 Pharm acokinetic Analysis Set (PAS):  Includes all subjects who have received at least 
[ADDRESS_311677] that may influence the PK analysis, if any unexpected error occurs during the study 
that may influence the PK analysis (e.g. , early detachment of transdermal systems, 
apparent sample switching, etc.) or if their data are unavailable or incomplete.  The PAS 
will be used for the analysis with model-based approach. Excluded cases will be 
documented together with the reason for exclusion. 
 
Inclusion in the analysis populations will be determined prior to database lock. 
 
If a subject is randomized incorrectly or is administered the incorrect study drug, analyses of the 
ITT population will be based on the assigned treatment whereas all other analyses will be based 
on the actual treatment.

This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses.  A SAP that describes the 
details of the analyses to be conducted will be written prior to database lock.   Unless otherwise 
indicated, all testing of statistical significance will be 2 -sided, and a difference resulting in a P 
value of <0. [ADDRESS_311678] deviation (SD),

13.4.1 Study Subjects and Demographics 
[IP_ADDRESS] Disposition and Withdrawals 
The numbers of subjects randomized, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal will be tabulated overall and by [CONTACT_1570].  Th e number of subjects and 
patches in each analysis population will be reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol Deviations 
A by-subject listing of all protocol deviations and violations will be reported in Clinical Study 
Report. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demographics and
 Other Baseline Characteristics 
These analyses will be conducted for all analysis populations.   Demographic variables will 
include age, gender, height, and weight.  Information on race and ethnicity will be collected for 
any eventual analysis of differences in response to study drug,  in accordance with local 
regulatory requirements .  Baseline subject characteristics will include medical history, physical 
examination findings, and previous OA treatment modalities. 
 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570], by [CONTACT_149199], classified using World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary (WHO-DD) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classes and preferred terms. Page [ADDRESS_311679] mean in terms of duration of exposure will be calculated.  
Descriptive statistics for these quantities, including the mean, median, SD, minimum, maximum, 
and quartiles, will be provided by [CONTACT_1570].  
13.4.3 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy variables will be summarized and analyzed using the FAS population as primary, unless 
otherwise specified. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the change from Baseline to Week 4 in the 
WOMAC pain score; the primary analysis set is the FAS.  The comparisons of interest are: 
 HP-5000  versus placebo 
 HP-5000  versus placebo 
 
The
 estimand in the primary analysis for efficacy for each dose is the difference between 
treatments groups (HP-5000 dose group vs. placebo) in the change from Baseline to Week 4 in 
WOMAC pain score in all subjects as randomized, under the assumption that all randomized 
patients remain on their randomized treatment throughout the study.   WOMAC scores obtained 
more than 24 hours after discontinuation of study drug will be excluded as a-priori defined 
outliers. 
 
The primary efficacy variable, the change from Baseline to Week 4 in the WOMAC pain score 
will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.  The MMRM 
model will include change from baseline in WOMAC pain score as the repeated dependent 
variable, with treatment (HP-5000  HP-5000 -  and placebo), visit, treatment- by-visit 
interaction, and the baseline WOMAC pain score as covariates.  An unstructured covariance 
matrix will be assumed.  If the unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, a series of other 
covariance structures will be tested for use. 
 
The MMRM model may be repeated on additional analysis sets as a sensitivity analysis.  If the 
normality assumption is violated, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on rank-transformed data 
will be used as utility analysis and additional supportive analyses may be performed.

Analysis Populations  
 Intent -to-Treat (ITT): includes all consented and randomized subjects. 
Regardless of any protocol deviations, analyses performed on the ITT set will be 
based on the randomized treatment assignment and all available data.  
 Full Analysis Set (FAS): includes all randomized subjects who have had at least 
[ADDRESS_311711] -baseline assessment of the primary 
efficacy measure (WOMAC pain score ). Evaluable subjects will be defined as 
those who meet the FAS definition. The FAS will be used as the primary set for 
analysis of efficacy endpoints based on randomized treatment assignment.  
 Safety Analysis Set (SAF): includes all subjects who have had a t least [ADDRESS_311712] occurred in treatment arm assignments, then analyses using th e 
SAF will be based on treatment actually received. The SAF will be used for the 
analysis of dermal evaluations and safety endpoints.  
 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS): includes all subjects who have received at 
least [ADDRESS_311713] 1 blood sample for pharmacokinetic ( PK) assessment. Subjects may 
be excluded from the PAS set if they significantly violate inclusion or exclusion 
criteria, significantly violate the protocol in a way that m ay influence the PK 
analysis, if any unexpected error occurs during the study that m ay influence the 
PK analysis (eg , early detachment of transdermal systems, apparent sample 
switching, etc.) or if their data are unavailable or incomplete. The PAS will be 
used for the analysis with model -based approach. Excluded cases will be 
documented together with the reason for exclusion.  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial is the change 
from Baseline to Week 4 in the WOMAC pain score; the primary analysis set is the 
FAS. The comparisons of interest are:  
 HP-5000  versus placebo  
 HP-5000  versus placebo  
The primary efficacy variable, the change from baseline to Week 4 in the WOMAC 
pain score will be analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) 
analysis. The MMRM model will include change from baseline in WOMAC pain 
score as the repeated dependent variable, with treat ment (HP -5000  
HP-5000  and placebo), visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and the baseline 
WOMAC pain score as covariates. An unstructured covariance matrix will be 
assumed. If the unstructured covariance matrix fails to converge, a series of  other 
covariance structures will be tested for use. The MMRM model may be repeated on 
additional analysis sets as a sensitivity analysis. If the normality assumption is 
violated, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on rank -transformed data will be used as 
utility analysis and additional supportive analyses may be performed.  
Other sensitivity analyses may be performed on the primary endpoint to assess the 
robustness of the results based on the model used for primary analysis. This analyses 
may include multiple imputation and pattern -mixture models for handling of missing Page [ADDRESS_311714] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 8 of 69 data. Details will be provided in the SAP. The analyses will be performed according 
to the National Academy of Sciences (2010) guidelines.  
Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoints:  Other seconda ry efficacy endpoints will 
be analyzed using the change in mean  as appropriate.  
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (pain) – change between Baseline and Week  1 and 2  
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (stiffness)  
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index (physical function)  
 WOMAC LK3.1 OA Index ( composite  score ) 
 Patient Global Assessment  
 Patient Global Impression of Change  
 Pain intensity assessed on an 11 -point NRS  
 Use of rescue medication  
Additional categorical response analyses may be performed; additional details will be 
provided in the SAP.  Additional categorical response analyses may be performed; 
additional details will be provided in the SAP.  
Analysis of Safety:  All safety summaries will be descriptive; statistical significance 
tests may be performed on safety data that will be described in the SAP . Safety 
variables include treatment -emergent AEs, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, ECG 
readings, physical examination results,  and dermal safety results . No formal 
inferential analyses will be conducted for safety variables, unless otherwise noted.  
Analysis of PK : Plasma concentrations of diclofenac (for both HP -[ADDRESS_311715] size or higher will be approximately  67% having

7.1. Overall Study Design and Plan 
This 4-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study is designed to 
compare the safety and efficacy of HP-5000  with that of placebo in the treatment of OA. Subjects 
will be randomly assigned to receive 1  of the following 3 treatments in a 1:1:2 ratio : HP-5000  
pa
tch, HP-5000  patch, or placebo  patch  The placebo patch will be identical in 
a
ppearance to the 
2 HP-5000 active patches. The total number of subjects randomized in the trial 
and included in the primary analysis will be approximately 300 . The duration of double-blind 
treatment is expected to be 4 weeks and the total time in the study will be approximately 7 weeks. 
Efficacy will be assessed by [CONTACT_256434] (WOMAC) LK3.1 OA index for pain. Efficacy assessments will also include the use 
of the WOMAC LK3.1 OA index for stiffness,  physical function,  and composite score, the Patient 
Global Assessment, the Patient Global Impression of Change, pain intensity assessed on an 
11-point NRS and the subjects’ use of rescue medication.
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_256435] (AEs), physical examination findings, vital 
sign measurements, electrocardiogram (ECGs),  clinical laboratory test results, and body weight. 
All AEs observed by [CONTACT_256419] (from the time 
of study drug administration through the posttreatment visit) will be documented. 
Dermal characteristics will be assessed by [ADDRESS_311724] the  patch application and removal times 
in electronic diaries along with any incidence of patch detachment. 
Plasma concentrations of diclofenac will be assessed by [CONTACT_256371] 14 and 28  
(or at the early termination visit).  
Figure [ADDRESS_311725] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 21 of 69 7.2. Discussion of Study Design

research organization (CRO) or the sponsor involved in this study.. 
8.3. Premature Subject Withdrawal 
All subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any reason, and without prejudice. Every reasonable attempt should be made by [CONTACT_256372]; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if 
they withdraw consent to participate. Investigators must attempt to contact [CONTACT_256436].   
Subjects may be withdrawn if continuing in the study is not in the subject’s best interest, their 
condition worsens during the study,  or for safety reasons, as determined by [CONTACT_093]. 
Subjects may also be withdrawn due to lack of compliance with the protocol or if the subject is 
unwilling to continue participation in the trial. 
If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal and the date of 
discontinuation will be recorded on the appropriate page of the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Whenever possible and reasonable, the evaluations that  are to be conducted at the completion of 
the study should be performed at the time of premature discontinuation. 
8.4. Subject Replacement Criteria 
Subjects who withdraw after randomization and the application of the first treatment patch will 
not be replaced. Page [ADDRESS_311731] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 26 of 69 9.2. Treatments Administered 
HP-5000 will be administered  for a maximum of 28 days. 
The treatment arms for th
is study are the following: 
Treatment Arm   Treatment  
HP-5000   One patch applied  to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
HP-5000  One patch applied  to alternate side of the target kn ee (inner 
or outer).  
Placebo  One patch applied  to alternate side of the target knee (inner 
or outer).  
Patch Application 
An example of the guidance information to be provided to subjects for applying, securing, and 
removing the patch will be provided separately.  
9.3. Dispensing and Storage 
The IP supplied by  [CONTACT_256437]. The investigator is responsible for dispensing 
the IP according to the dosage scheme and for ensuring proper storage of the IP. 
The investigator must confirm the receipt of the IP with his/her signature. A copy of this receipt 
must be kept by [CONTACT_093],  and another copy will be stored at Noven Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(hereafter referred to as “Noven”),  and/or  Until the IP is dispensed to the 
subjects, it must be stored at 25 °C and in a dry place in a securely locked area that is not generally 
accessible. 
The key to the storage area is to be kept by [CONTACT_88948]. The 
storage area will be accessible only to those persons authorized by [CONTACT_256438]. 
9.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
In this parallel-group randomized study, subjects who meet study entry criteria will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1:2 ratio to HP-5000  HP- 5000  or placebo patches. The 
ra
ndomization schedule will be computer generated using a permuted block algorithm and will 
randomly allocate IP to randomization numbers. The randomization numbers will be assigned 
sequentially through a central interactive voice response system ( IVRS) as subjects are entered 
into the study. The study center will not be a blocking factor in the randomization schedule. 
The randomization schedule will be prepared by [CONTACT_256439]. 
No one involved in the clinical conduct will have access to the randomization schedule before 
official unblinding of treatment assignment. No subject will be randomized into this study more 
than once. Page [ADDRESS_311732] maintain adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, return, or other 
disposition of the IP including the date, quantity, batch or code number, and identification of 
subjects (subject number [and initials]) who received the IP. The investigator will not supply the 
IP to any person except those named as subinvestigators (on the Form FDA 1572 ), designated 
study personnel, and subjects in this study. The investigator will not dispense the IP from any study 
sites other than those listed (on the Form FDA 1572 ). The IPs may not be relabeled or reassigned 
for use by [CONTACT_23837]. If any of the IP is not dispensed,  is lost, stolen, unusable,  or is received 
in a damaged container, this information must be documented and reported to Noven  and 
appropriate regulatory agencies, as required. 
Upon completion of the study, the IP must be left in the original packaging and returned to the 
sponsor or designee for destruction or return. 
9.9. Treatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance with IP regimens will be assessed by [CONTACT_256440], if necessary, at every post-randomization 
visit. A subject who is not compliant (used  6 or less patches per week) will be counseled at each 
visit on the importance of taking the IP as instructed. A subject who is deemed noncompliant on 
[ADDRESS_311733] their daily intake/use of 
rescue medication/IP in the diary. Deviations from the planned doses (missed dose or timing) will 
be recorded on the subjects’ eCRF. These diaries will be reviewed by [CONTACT_256441]. Information from that subject diary will be transcribed 
on the appropriate eCRF pages for documentation of subject compliance with IP. 
9.10. Permitted and Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256354] . Prior to the double-blind treatment 
period, subjects will stop taking all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic medications 
for at least 7 days ; however, rescue medication (acetaminophen [APAP]) is permitted during the 
wash-out if required . A maximum of 2 g/day of APAP will be allowed for rescue treatment of both 
target and non-target knee pain except within the 2 calendar days prior to the baseline visit (ie, 
rescue medication is prohibited from Day -2 until clinic visit on Day 0) and within the 1 calendar 
day prior to each clinic visit (eg, rescue medication is prohibited from Day [ADDRESS_311734] will visit the study site on Day 7). APAP will be prepared by [CONTACT_1034]. 
Subjects are not allowed to apply HP-5000 on the non-target knee at any time in the study period.  
All concomitant medications used (including OTC medications and herbal supplements) will be 
recorded in the source document and on the appropriate eCRF.  
9.10.1 Permitted Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256350], chondroitin, and antidepressants (for indication of depression) will be allowed if 
used as stable therapy for [ADDRESS_311735] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 29 of 69 9.10.2 Prohibited Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_256351] (selective or nonselective), any opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], APAP (>2 g/day), ASA (>81 mg/day),

chronic pain syndromes, antihistamine with a sedative effect, sedatives for insomnia,  topi[INVESTIGATOR_256355], camphor, menthol, methylsulfonylmethane, 
 or capsaicin, any intra-articular treatments for the knee,  any nonpharmaceutical therapy or 
device to relieve knee pain (including physiotherapy, massage therapy, hot wax therapy etc.) may 
not be taken during the study. 
Glucosamine, chondroitin, and antidepressants (for the indication of depression) will be allowed 
if used as stable therapy for 90 days prior to screening visit. However, if in use for fewer than 
90 days, these drugs will be considered as prohibited concomitant medications and will require 
washout. 
Subjects will be allowed to continue stable ASA therapy not for OA pain (up to 81 mg/day).

3. Follow up Period : [ADDRESS_311744] is approximately 7  weeks.  
10.2. Assessments 
10.2.1 Efficacy 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index 
The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index Likert (LK) version 3.[ADDRESS_311745] recent version of this instrument for the assessment of hip and knee OA. The WOMAC 
Osteoarthritis Index is a widely used, self-administered assessment used to measure pain, stiffness, 
and physical function in subjects with OA. It is considered to be a reliable and valid instrument.5,6,7   
The WOMAC Pain scale evaluates the following 5 items:  
1. Walking 
2. Stair climbing 
3. Noctural 
4. Rest 
5. Weight bearing 
Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being no difficulty and 4 being extreme difficulty.  
The WOMAC Stiffness scale assesses 2 items: morning stiffness and stiffness occurring later in 
the day. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0 being no difficulty and 4 being extreme 
difficulty. 
The WOMAC Physical Function assesses the following the following categories using the 0 to 4 
scale described previously: 
1. Descending stairs  
2. Ascending stairs 
3. Rising from sitting 
4. Standing Page [ADDRESS_311746] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 34 of 69 5. Bending to floor 
6. Walking on a flat surface 
7. Getting in/getting out of car 
8. Going shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
9. Putting on socks 
10. Lying in bed 
11. Taking off socks 
12. Rising from bed 
13. Getting in/out of bath 
14. Sitting 
15. Getting on/off toilet 
16. Heavy domestic duties 
17. Light domenstic duties 
The Womac Composite score is most commonly calculated by [CONTACT_256389] 3 
subscales. Higher scores on the WOMAC indicate worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations. 
The total score is calculated as follows: Total score= __/96= __% 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Assessment 
The PGA is a self-administered instrument that measures the subject’s overall impression of their 
OA in their target knee on a 5 -point scale where 0 = “Very Good” and 4  = “Very Poor”.   
Subjects will be asked the complete the following statement: “How would you rate your 
osteoarthritis condition over the last 24 hours? ”  The response options include the following: 
 Very Good  0 
 Good  1 
 Moderate  2 
 Poor  3 
 Very Poor  4 
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient Global Impression of Change 
The Patient Global Impression of Change is a self-administered instrument that measures change 
in subjects’ overall improvement with treatment on a scale where 1 = “very much improved” and 
7 = “very much worse.” Subjects will be asked the following question: “How would you rate your 
overall improvement with treatment during the clinical trial?” The response options include the 
following: Page [ADDRESS_311747] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 35 of 69  Very Much Improved  1 
 Much Improved  2 
 Minimally Improved  3 
 No Change  4 
 Minimally Worse  5 
 Much Worse  6 
 Very Much Worse  7 
[IP_ADDRESS] Numeric Rating Scale 
The NRS is an 11-point scale from 0 to 10. On this scale, 0 = no pain and 10 = the worst pain 
imaginable. NRS will be assessed in two  ways. One is the average pain condition over the last 
[ADDRESS_311748] will rate his 
or her target knee pain intensity using the following question: “On a scale from 0 to 10, where 
“zero” represents “no pain” and “10” represents “the worst possible pain,” how would you rate the 
pain that you have been feeling in your knee over the last 24 hours ?” 
Note: 
1. The NRS pain score for assessment is an average of the NRS pain scores reported for pain 
over the last [ADDRESS_311749] 3 days prior to wash-out start (Phone Visit 1) 
and Baseline (Visit 2) are required. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Use of Rescue Medication 
For the [ADDRESS_311750] their daily 
intake/use of rescue medication in the diary. Rescue medication will be limited as follows: 
2 gram/day APAP may be used except within 2 calendar days prior to the baseline visit and within 
1 calendar day prior to other visits.  
10.2.2 Safety 
Safety assessments will include the evaluation of laboratory assessments, vital signs, 12 -lead 
ECG s, physical examinations, and AEs. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Laboratory Safety Assessments 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Laboratory Tests to be Performed

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events 
The definitions and management of and special considerations for AEs are provided  in Section 11. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluations of Patch and Dermal Assessment 
Patch Adhesion  
Patch adhesion will be assessed in two ways. In the clinic, patch adhesion will be assessed by [CONTACT_92685] a designee using a predefined patch adhesion scale with scores on a 5-point 
numerical scale, by [CONTACT_256444] 
2016, at each clinic visit. The following information will be included in the full protocol that will 
be submitted with the IND:  
• 0 = ≥90% adhered (essentially no lift off the skin)  
• 1 = ≥75% to <90% adhered (some edges only lifting off of the skin)  
• 2 = ≥50% to <75% adhered (less than half of the system lifting off of the skin)  
• 3 = <50% adhered but not detached (more than half the system lifting off of the skin without 
falling off)  
• 4 = patch detached (patch completely off the skin)  
During the treatment period at home, subjects will report the incidence of patch detachment by 
[CONTACT_256445]. 
Irritati on 
application site where the previous patch was applied will be examined for signs of skin irritation 
at each clinic visit. All subjects will be evaluated by a trained investigator or designee using the 
Berger and Bowman scale (Berger and Bowman 1982) as described below.  
Half grades will not be assigned if reactions fall between the unit grades, rather, the more severe 
of the 2 grades will be assigned. Findings will be graded using the following 2 scales, which will 
be included in the full protocol that will be submitted with the IND:  Page [ADDRESS_311756] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 38 of 69 Dermal Response  
• 0 = no evidence of irritation  
• 1 = minimal erythema, barely perceptible  
• 2 = definite erythema, readily visible; minimal edema or minimal papular response  
• 3 = erythema and papules  
• 4 = definite edema  
• 5 = erythema, edema, and papules  
• 6 = vesicular eruption  
• 7 = strong reaction spreading beyond the application site  
Other Effects  
• A = slightly glazed appearance  
• B = marked glazed appearance  
• C = glazing with peeling and cracking  
• F = glazing with fissures  
• G = film of dried serous exudates covering all or part of the patch site  
• H = small petechial erosions and/or scabs  
• N = no other observations  
Dermal response score will be rated on a 0 to 7 scale, whereby 0 is rated as “No evidence of 
irritation” and 7 is rated as “Strong reaction spreading beyond test (application) site.” 
Other effects will be scored via a letter scale and a corresponding numeric scale, whereby N(0) is 
rated as “No effects” and H(3) is rated as “Small petechial erosions and/or scabs.” 
Discomfort  
Discomfort will be assessed by [CONTACT_1720] a designee using a predefined discomfort rating 
scale. The evaluator will ask the subject, “Are you experiencing any discomfort related to the 
patch?” If the answer is no, the overall level of discomfort will be rated as 0. If the answer is yes, 
the evaluator will then ask the subject to rate the discomfort as mild, moderate, or severe. Any 
discomfort mentioned should be recorded and rated as follows:  
• 0 = No discomfort  
• 1 = Mild discomfort  
• 2 = Moderate but tolerable discomfort  
• 3 = Severe, intolerable discomfort  
• 4 = Patch not present  Page [ADDRESS_311757] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 39 of 69 Adhesive Residue  
The amount of adhesive residue remaining at the application site where the previous patch was 
applied will be examined by [CONTACT_1720] a designee at each clinic visit and scored according 
to the scale below:  
• 0 = None  
• 1 = Light  
• 2 = Medium  
• 3 = Heavy 
• 4 = Patch not present 
10.2.[ADDRESS_311758]. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a new, 
clinically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated 
with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition. (Worsening of a 
pre-existing condition is considered an AE.) 
Events occurring in subjects treated with placebo are also considered AEs. However, AEs reported 
during treatment-free periods before IP has been administered are not considered AEs; these events 
are captured on the eCRF as updates to the subject’s medical history. 
11.1.[ADDRESS_311759]. For an IP, the known information is contained in the IB which includes the HP -5000 
Develepmental Core Safety Information.  
An unexpected adverse event is one for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the 
current IB and Develepmental Core Safety Information.  
Furthermore,  reports that  add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, already 
documented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events.  
11.1.3 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 results in death  
 is life-threatening 
NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
 requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_256357]: An elective hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88909] a condition present before exposure to the 
test drug, or a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_81539] a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the 
condition or event as an SAE  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 is a congenital anomaly 
NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the IP 
during pregnancy is an SAE. However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that has 
received an IP is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the IP interacted with a 
contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy.  Page [ADDRESS_311760] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 41 of 69  is an important medical event 
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropriate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117112]. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or 
at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias,  or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], development of drug dependency,  or drug abuse  
11.1.4 Significant Adverse Events 
Other significant AEs are defined as marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities 
(other than those meeting the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, 
including withdrawal of test drug, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy. 
11.2. Management of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be collected from the time of first dose administration through  the Follow- up 
Visit or Early Termination Visit, whichever occurs first. 
Subjects who terminat
e early will continue to be monitored for [ADDRESS_311761] visit or evaluation. The investigator will then 
monitor and/or ask about or evaluate AEs using nonleading questions, such as 
 “How are you feeling?” 
 “Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?” 
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?” 
Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered AEs. 
11.2.2 Evaluation 
[IP_ADDRESS] Severity of Adverse Events 
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as 
Mild  Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
Moderate  Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe  Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, 
or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . Page [ADDRESS_311762] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 42 of 69 It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs. Severity is a classification of intensity 
whereas an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section 11.1.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Seriousness 
The investigator is to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria, as described in 
Section 11.1.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Action Taken 
Action taken may consist of 
Dose in creased  An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60267]; either by 
[CONTACT_60268], strength or amount.  
Dose not 
changed  An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
Dose reduced  An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_58413], either 
by [CONTACT_60268], strength or amount.  
Drug 
interrupted  An indication that a medication schedule was modified by [CONTACT_60269] a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Drug 
withdrawn  An indication  that a medication schedule was modified through termination 
of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Not applicable  Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context.  
Unknown  Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Outcome at the Time of Last Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as follows: 
 Recovered/resolved 
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae 
 Recovering/resolving 
 Not recovered/not resolved 
 Fatal* 
 Unknown  
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death. If more than [ADDRESS_311763]’s death, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE. 
[Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death 
should be reported as SAEs.] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make an assessment of each AE’s relationship to the IP. The categories for 
classifying the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_256333]. 
Not related  An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship 
to IP administration (eg, no temporal relationship to drug administration, Page [ADDRESS_311764] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 43 of 69 because the drug was administered after onset of event; investigation shows 
that the drug was not administ ered; another cause was proven.)  
Unlikely 
related  An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to 
IP administration that makes a causal relationship improbable, and in which 
other drugs, events or underlying disease provide p lausible explanations.  
Possibly related  An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the IP, but which 
could also be explained by [CONTACT_81572]. 
Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Definitely 
Related  An AE occurring in a plausible time relationship to IP administration, and 
which cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or events. 
The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinically reasonable.  
11.2.[ADDRESS_311765] be documented in the eCRF 
with the following information, where appropriate. (The period of observation for the study is

If AEs occur in a subject that are not tolerable, the investigator must decide whether to stop the 
subject’s involvement in the study and/or treat the subject. Special procedures may be 
recommended for the specific IP, such as the collection of a serum sample for determining blood 
concentrations of IP, specific tapering procedures, or treatment regimens, as appropriate. 
For doubleblinded studies like HP-[ADDRESS_311767]’s treatment 
assignment in most circumstances, even if an SAE has occurred. If unblinding is necessary, see 
Section  9.5 for a description of the unblinding procedures. 
11.2.5 Follow- up 
Any AE will be followed (up to a maximum of [ADDRESS_311768] dose of study medication) to 
a satisfactory resolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be explained by [CONTACT_256447] [ADDRESS_311769] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 44 of 69 causes (ie, concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further 
evaluation is not warranted. All findings relevant to the final outcome of an AE must be reported 
in the subject’s medical record and recorded on the e CRF  page.   
11.2.6 Notification 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events 
The investigator or designee must report all SAEs promptly to  within [ADDRESS_311770] becoming aware of the event by [CONTACT_12550], signing and dating the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form, verifying the accuracy of the information recorded in the form with the source 
documents and eCRF, and sending the SAE form to the sponsor by [CONTACT_7053]:  
Email:  
F
ax number:  
The written report should be submitted on the SAE form provided for this purpose. At the time of 
first notification, the investigator or designee should provide the following information,  if 
available: 
 Protocol number 
 Reporter (study site and investigator) 
 Subject’s study number 
 Subject’s year of birth 
 Subject’s gender 
 Date of first dose of IP 
 Date of last dose of IP, if applicable 
 Adverse event term 
 Date of occurrence of the event 
 A brief description of the event, outcome to date, and any actions taken 
 The seriousness criteria that were met 
 Concomitant medication at onset of the event 
 Relevant medical history information 
 Relevant laboratory test findings 
 Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_256359]. (“Is there a reasonable possibility that the IP 
caused the SAE? Yes or No?”) 
 Whether and when the investigator was unblinded as to the subject’s treatment assignment  
The investigator must fax/mail a written SAE Report Form that describes the SAE to the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_256360], who will forward the information to the sponsor.   
Any missing or additional relevant information concerning the SAE should be provided to the 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_256336] a follow-up SAE Report Form, together 
with the following information (adverse event, date of occurrence , subject ID, study ID, IP, and 
site number); this will allow the follow-up information to be linked to the initial SAE report.   Page [ADDRESS_311771] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 46 of 69 using the Pregnancy Data Collection Form via the same fax number and/or email address as for 
SAE reporting. The inve stigator should contact [CONTACT_256448]. 
Early Termination Visit assessments are required as soon as possible after learning of the 
pregnancy . The investigator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or 
termination. These findings must be reported on the Exposure in Utero form and forwarded to the 
designated individuals.  The event meets the SAE criterion only if it results in a spontaneous 
abortion or a congenital anomaly.   Page [ADDRESS_311772] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 49 of 69 13.3. Analysis Populations 
The following 4 analysis populations are planned for this study:  
 Intent- to-Treat (ITT): includes all consented and randomized subjects. Regardless of any 
protocol deviations, analyses performed on the ITT set will be based on the randomized 
treatment assignment and all available data. 
 Full Analysis Set (FAS): includes all randomized subjects who have had at least [ADDRESS_311773]-Baseline assessment of the primary efficacy measure (WOMAC pain score). 
Evaluable subjects will be defined as those who meet the FAS definition. The FAS will be 
used as the primary set for analysis of efficacy endpoints based on randomized treatment 
assignment. 
 Safety Analysis Set (SAF): includes all subjects who have had at least [ADDRESS_311774] occurred in treatment arm assignments, then analyses using the SAF will be 
based on treatment actually received. The SAF will be used for the analysis of dermal 
evaluations and safety endpoints. 
 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PAS): includes all subjects who have received at least 
[ADDRESS_311775] that may influence the PK analysis, if any unexpected error occurs during the study 
that may influence the PK analysis (eg, early detachment of transdermal systems, apparent 
sample switching, etc.) or if their data are unavailable or incomplete. The PAS will be used 
for the analysis with model-based approach. Excluded cases will be documented together 
with the reason for exclusion. 
Inclusion in the analysis populations will be determined prior to database lock. 
If a subject is randomized incorrectly or is administered the incorrect IP, analyses of the 
ITT population will be based on the assigned treatment whereas all other analyses will be based 
on the actual treatment. 
13.4. Statistical Analyses 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A SAP that describes the 
details of the analyses to be conducted will be written prior to database lock.   
Unless otherwise indicated, all testing of statistical significance will be 2 -sided, and a difference 
resulting in a P value of <0.[ADDRESS_311776] deviation (SD), 
median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, these statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_256361]. Page [ADDRESS_311777] 2016 Final v1.0 Page 51 of 69 Other sensitivity analyses may be performed on the primary endpoint to assess the robustness of 
the results based on the model used for primary analysis. This analyses may include multiple 
imputation and pattern-mixture models for handling of missing data. Details will be provided in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The analyses will be performed according to the National 
Academy of Sciences (2010) guideline s.8 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analyses for Secondary Endpoint

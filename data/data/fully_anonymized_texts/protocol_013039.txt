Title  A Phase 3, Multi -Center, Randomized, Open -Label Study of Carbavance 
(Meropenem/R PX7009) Versus Best Available Therapy in Subjects with Selected 
Serious Infections Due to Carbapenem -Resistant Enterobacteriaceae  
Indication s Subjects with serious infections, specifically 
complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) or 
acute pyelonephritis (AP),  complicated 
intra-abdominal infections (cIAI), 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired bacterial pneumonia 
(HABP), ventilator -associated bacterial 
pneumonia (VABP), and bacteremia, known 
or suspected to be caused by

Study 
Objectives  The objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of Carbavance ™ (meropenem/  
RPX7009) in treatment of subjects with selected serious infections, suspected 
or known to be due to CRE ; and  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics ( PK) of meropenem  and RPX7009 in subjects 
with selected serious infections, suspected or known to be due to CRE . 
Rationale  
 
 Beta-lactam  antimicrobials  are considered to be among the most useful classes of 
antimicrobial agents for treatment of bacterial infections. In particular, the 
development of broad -spectrum cephalosporin and carbapenem antimicrobials have 
represented a key advancement in replacing other classes of drugs with toxicities 
and limited spectra of activity against pathogens.  
In the current era of increased resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins and 
penicillin/beta -lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenem antimicrobial agents 
are frequently the antibiotics of “last defense” for the most resistant pathogens in 
serious infections. However, the recent dissemination of serine carbapenemases 
(e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae  carbapenemase [KPC]) in Enterobacteriaceae  within 
many U nited States and global hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222242] a considerable threat to 
carbapenem and other members of the beta -lactam class of antimicrobial agents.  
Infections caused by [CONTACT_222296]. The loss of the carbapenem class of antimicrobial agents for 
treatment of Enterobacteriaceae  (the most frequently occurring pathogens in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]), Acinetobacter baumannii , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
represent s a critical setback in modern patient care.  
As a result of  the current lack of an optimal treatment for patients who have 
infections due to a CRE, physicians manage these patients with the limited 
anti-infective options available, including aminoglycosides, polymyxin B, colistin, 
tigecycline, or vario us combinations of these. There are limited efficacy data 
available for many of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_222243], 
particularly in combination, but with limited or no alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_222244] , INC.   Carbavance ™ (Meropenem/RPX7009)  
CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -[ADDRESS_267122] Available Therapy (BAT) despi[INVESTIGATOR_222245].  
Meropenem is a broad -spectrum injectable carbapenem antibiotic used to treat a 
wide variety of infections. The spectrum of action includes many gram -positive 
bacter ia, gram -negative bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria, and it is approved in many 
countries around the world at doses up to 2 g every 8 hours (q8h). Three -hour 
infusions of meropenem are commonly used to treat organisms with higher 
minimum inhibitory concentr ations (MICs), such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , to 
maximize the time above the MIC.  
RPX7009 is a novel beta -lactamase inhibitor that has inhibitory activity against 
many serine beta -lactamases and was optimized for inhibition of the KPC 
beta-lactamase and t he potentiation of carbapenems against Enterobacteriaceae . 
RPX7009 is being developed for use with meropenem to address the challenges of 
treatment of serious infections caused by [CONTACT_222297].  
Carbavance, the c ombination of meropenem and RPX7009 administered as a fixed 
combination by [CONTACT_33980] ( IV) infusion, is being developed to treat serious 
gram -negative infections, such as cUTI, AP,  cIAI,  HABP, VABP, and bacteremia, 
including those infections caused by [CONTACT_222298].  
Study Design  
 
 This is a Phase 3, multi -center, randomized, open -label study of Carbavance 
(meropenem/RPX7009) versus BAT in the treatment of subjects with selected 
serious infections, specifically cUTI or AP, cIAI, HABP, VABP, and bacteremia, 
suspected or known to be caused by [CONTACT_222299].  
Approximately 150 subjects will be enrolled in a 2:1 ratio of Carbavance to BAT , 
respectively.  
The Treatment Arms in the study are as follows:  
• Treatment Arm A:  Subjects (n = 100) will receive Carbavance ( meropenem  2 g 
plus RPX7009 2 g) IV q8h, with each dose infused for 3 hours for up to 14 days.  
NOTE: Dose adjustments will be required for subjects  with renal insufficiency.  
• Treatment Arm B:  Subjects (n = 50) will receive BAT  with IV antibiotics chosen 
from the following list, either in combination or alone, for up to 14 days:  
carbapenem (meropenem, ertapenem, or imipenem ), tigecycline, colistin, 
aminoglycoside ( amikacin, tobramycin,  or gentamicin ), polymyxin B , and 
ceftazidime -avibactam . 
Subjects  (or subjects’ legal representatives)  providing informed consent, meeting all 
study eligibility criteria including those criteria for their particular site of infection 
(e.g., cUTI or AP,  cIAI,  HABP, VABP, and bacteremia), and who have either a 
known CRE infection or a suspected CRE infection  (based on colonization with a 
KPC -producing Enterobacteriaceae  organism  [which may be determined through 
rapid diagnostic tests, active surveillance cultures , or other documentation of CRE 
colonization]  in the past [ADDRESS_267123] 90 days) will be randomized to receive Carbavance 
(meropenem/RPX7009) or BAT .

CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -[ADDRESS_267124] day of study drug  administration (Carbavance 
[meropenem /RPX7009] or BAT ). Subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_222300]. The planned total duration of IV study drug  therapy is 
up to [ADDRESS_267125] receive [ADDRESS_267126] receive 3 days of 
study drug  therapy.  
End of Treatment (EOT) will be the day on which the final dose of study drug  is 
administered  (+1 day). The Test  of Cure (TOC) visit and Late Follow -up (LFU) visit 
will occur at the time points  listed in the Schedule of Procedures . 
An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review  accumulated  
safety data  for this study and Rempex -505 when the total combined enrollment in 
both trials is approximately 25% (250 subjects) and 50% (500 subjects).  They will 
also review serious adverse events on an ongoing basis.  They will make 
recommendations to the Sponsor  based on th is safety data . Further details regarding 
the data safety monitoring guid elines will be included in the DSMB  Charter, which 
is the governing document of the DSMB . 
In order to ensure unbiased assessment of outcomes between treatment arms  
subjects will not be  informed  what treatment arm they are assigned . Efforts should 
be made to keep subjects  treatment naï ve throughout the course of the study. At each 
site a Blinded Investigator (BI) will be assigned to assess each subject’s baseline 
status and Outcome Assessment during the EOT and TOC visits.  A blinded 
adjudication committee will  also be formed to  independen tly evaluate clinical 
outcome  data in cases where the Principal Investigator ( PI) and BI’s assessment of 
outcome differ . Further details regarding the blinded adjudication committee will be 
included in a Blinded Adjudication Committee C harter, which is the  governing 
document of the committee.   
Number of 
Subjects  The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_267127] CRE infections across the following indications: cUTI or AP,  
cIAI,  HABP, VABP, and bacteremia. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222246].  Subjects will be stratified at randomization based 
on their presenting indication  (cUTI/AP, cIAI, HABP, VABP , or bacteremia ) and 
by [CONTACT_11338]  (North Ame rica vs. Europe vs. Asia Pacific vs. Rest of World ). 
Enrollment will continue until  at least 45 subjects (30 Carbavance [meropenem/  
RPX7009 ], 15 BAT ) with cUTI or AP are documented to have a CRE organism at 
baseline  and until  at least  30 subjects with cI AI with a documented CRE organism 
at baseline  (20 Carbavance [meropenem/RPX7009], 1 0 BAT ) are enrolled .  Once 
the specified number of subjects are enrolled in the cUTI and/or cIAI indications, 
data from these subjects may be submitted to regulatory agencies in support of a 
marketing application, and the enrollment of additional subjects into the specific 
indication(s) where enrollment was met may be stopped.

Microbiology  Accurate micro biologic results are critical to successfully meet the study objectives.  
All specimens will be sent to the local la boratory for culture and susceptibility  
testing  per institutional standards . For all carbapenem -resistant gram -negative 
organisms, the MIC to carbapenems will be captured in the electronic Case Report 
Form (e CRF ). Susceptibility to Carbavance as determined  by [CONTACT_222302] -Bauer disk 
methodology  will be captured at baseline . If the resistance mechanism for each 
carbapenem -resistant organism cultured during the study is known, it should be 
captured in source documents.   
Any isolated bacteria deemed to be contributor y to the infectious process will be  
designated a pathogen by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_222253]. The local 
laboratory will culture each sample for organism identification, quantification ( when 
applicable ), and susceptibility testing  per institution al standards . CRE isolates at 
baseline, and a ll post-baseline isolates  cultured at the local laboratory and designated 
as pathogens by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_222254] (Medpace Reference 
Laboratory [MRL]) for confirmation of identification and  susceptibility testing 
results.  
All subjects must have a specimen sample  from the site of infection (i.e., blood, 
urine,  intra-abdominal fluid/tissue , or respi[INVESTIGATOR_222255])  and t wo sets of blood 
samples from two  separate venipuncture sites collected immediately prior to the first

dose of study drug) , and submitted to the local microbiology laboratory for culture 
and susceptibility testing.  When it is not p ossible to collect specimens for culture 
immediately prior to the first dose of study drug, cultures that have been obtained 
no more than 72 hours  (or 96 hours for cIAI)  prior to the first dose of study drug are 
acceptable.  The results of this culture will determine whether the subject meets the 
criteria for the Microbiological CRE Modified Intent -to-Treat ( mCRE -MITT ) 
Population  or the Microbiological Modified Intent -to-Treat  (m-MITT ) Population . 
Kirby -Bauer d isks for Carbava nce (meropenem/RPX7009)  susceptibility testing 
will be provided by [CONTACT_222303] . Susceptibility testing for BAT  
and other antimicrobials will be done per each institution’s standard procedures. In 
instances where susceptibility testing indicates resistance to the study drug but the 
subject is clinically improving, the subject should remain on study drug at the 
Investigator’s discretion.  
If the screening sample for culture is taken per standard of care before the subject 
(or the subject’s  legal representative ) signs informed consent, that isolate may be 
used for baseline and sent to the central lab oratory  once consent is obtained  as long 
as the sample was collected no more than  72 hours before (or 96 hours for cIAI  
specimens ) the first dos e of study drug . 
Urine Specimens  
For subjects with cUTI or AP, urine samples will be collected by [CONTACT_222304] -catch 
midstream, from a newly -inserted Foley catheter (no bag specimens allowed), 
bladder needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], or ureter aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
CRE isolates at baseline, and all post -baseline isolates  cultured at the local 
laboratory and designated as pathogens by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_222256] c entral 
laboratory for confirmation of identification and susceptibility testing results.   
The baseline urine cultures must grow at least one defined bacterial pathogen at 
concentration of 105 CFU/mL . Up to 2  isolated pathogens will be allowed per 
baseline urine culture  provided they are at concentrations of 105 CFU/mL of urine . 
The baseline urine samples submitted for culture must have a microscopic 
evaluation (e.g., gram  stain) and a dipstick analysis performed by [CONTACT_97946].   
For all post -baseline urine cultures, only pathogens at concentrations of 103 
CFU/mL of urine  will be sent to the central laboratory.  Up to [ADDRESS_267136] -baseline urine culture provided they are at concentrations 
of 103 CFU/mL.  
For both baseline and post -baseline cultures - if a subject grows [ADDRESS_267137] one intra -

administration).  Baseline s pecimens should be sent for gram stain, pathoge n 
identification and susceptibility testing at the local lab oratory . Isolates from the 
baseline specimen will also be sent to the central laboratory  for confirmatory testing . 
Post-baseline specimens  should be collected as clinically indicated  and sent to t he 
local lab oratory  for testing . Isolates from all post -baseline specimens should be sent 
to the central laboratory  for confirmatory testing . 
To be considered adequate, a specimen should consist of at least 1mL of fluid or 
tissue representative of the mate rial associated with the clinical infection.  
Gram stains will be conducted per institutional standards and gram stain data should 
be captured in source documents. If any intra -abdominal culture is performed 
(including cultures taken on swab), pathogens ex hibiting significant growth on 
cultures identified by [CONTACT_50821]’s routine procedures should be sent to the 
central lab, even if from a specimen that does not meet the aforementioned adequacy 
criteria.   
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_222257], a cceptable specimens should include at least 
one positive pretreatment sample obtained by [CONTACT_222305] (PSB) with 
bronchial alveolar lavage ( BAL ) or mini -BAL, non -bronchoscopic -BAL (NBBAL), 
or Protected Endotracheal Catheter  obtained prior to randomization and treatment . 
Non-ventilated subjects may have specimens obtained via deep expectoration or 
expectorated/induced sputum.   
All specimens should be sent  for gram  stain, quantitative culture, pathogen 
identification and suscep tibility testing.  
To be adequate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_222258] <10  squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_39560] >25 polymorphonuclear neutrophils per 
100x field. Colony counts 103 CFU/mL are considered the threshold for identifying

bronchoscopic BAL or the BALCath NBBAL, and 106 CFU/m L for endotracheal 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_25480].   
Gram stain s will be conducted per inst itutional standards , and gram stain data should 
be captured in source documents . Colony counts are not expected to  be performed 
on expectorated or induced sputum.  If the sputum is cultured , all pathogens 
exhibiting significant growth identified by [CONTACT_222306]’s routine procedures 
should be sent to the central lab, even if from a specimen that does not meet the 
specimen adequacy criteria described above.  
Blood and Other Tissue Specimens  
Two sets of samples from [ADDRESS_267139] negative blood culture (culture reading at 
24 hours or more) .  
Additional blood cultures , including bl ood cultures taken during fever spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988] (oral

Reference 
Therapy, 
Dose/Route  Subjects will receive BAT , with IV antibiotics, either alone or in combination, 
chosen from the following: carbapenem (m eropenem, ertapenem,  or imipenem ), 
tigecycline, colistin, aminoglycoside ( amikacin, tobramycin,  or gentamicin ), 
polymyxin B , and ceftazidime -avibactam . Ceftazidime -avibactam may  also be used 
as BAT , but may  not be given in combination with other BAT agents, with the 
exception of concurrent aminoglycoside therapy for either 72 hours/pending 
susceptibility testing in patients with cIAI, HABP,  VABP and bacte remia , similar 
to Carbavance  (see Concomitant Antibiotics below) . Details for dose and frequency 
of administration of BAT  (as well as warnings, precautions, and contraindications) 
can be found in the referenced summaries of product characteristics  for the specific 
antibacterials selected by [CONTACT_222307] . Investigators will be  instructed 
to select only country -approved  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
Concomitant 
Antibiotics  Subjects with cUTI  or AP who are randomized to Carbavance (meropenem/ 
RPX7009) or to BAT , and receive ceftazidime -avibactam should receive 
Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or ceftazidime -avibactam  alone , respectively . 
Subjects with cIAI, HABP, VABP, or bacteremia who are randomized to 
Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or to BAT and are treated with  
ceftazidime -avibactam should receive Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or 
ceftazidime -avibactam  alone , respectively . However, if the Investigator believes it 
is medically necessary , subjects may receive supportive aminoglycoside therapy in 
conjunction with C arbavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or ceftazidime -avibactam  
until culture information is available or for the first [ADDRESS_267141]’s 
organism is shown to be susceptible to Car bavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or

Efficacy 
Assessments  
 Efficacy Assessments for  cUTI or AP  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for cUTI or AP is defined differently by [CONTACT_222308]. The primary endpoint for the EMA is proportion of subjects in the 
mCRE -MITT Population that demonstrate microbiological eradication (See  
table below ). The primary endpo int for the FDA is the proportion of subjects in 
the mCRE -MITT Population who demonstrate a response of overall success at 
the TOC visit (See  table below ). 
To meet the primary endpoint for EMA and FDA, a subject’s gram -negative 
antimicrobial therapy to tre at the baseline infection cannot be altered (other than 
dose adjustment or modification of BAT  based on susceptibility of baseline 
pathogen within the first [ADDRESS_267145] dose of study drug) after 
randomization due to concerns of microbiological failure, clinical failure, or

CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -[ADDRESS_267149] s with HABP  and VABP,  
combined with all subjects with bacteremia (not related to cUTI/AP or  
HABP/VABP ). 
Secondary  Endpoint s 
• The all -cause mortality rate in the mCRE -MITT and m-MITT Populations 
at Day 28;  
• The proportion of subjects in the mCRE -MITT Population who 
demonstrate a response of overall success at the TOC visit.  
For subjects  whose gram -negative antimicrobial therapy to treat the baseline 
infection is not altered (other than dose adjustment or modification of BAT  
based on susceptibility of baseline pathogen within the first [ADDRESS_267150] dose of study drug) after randomization due  to concerns of 
microbiological failure, cl inical failure, or tolerability, a response of success 
is defined by [CONTACT_222309] (microbiological eradication) and a 
clinical assessment of cure.  
Clearance of bacteremia (microbiological eradication) is defined as the 
demons tration that bacterial pathogen s) found at baseline is absent with 
repeat culture.  
Clinical assessment of cure is defined as complete resolution or significant 
improvement of the baseline signs and symptoms of bacteremia, such that 
no further surgical intervention or antimicrobial therapy is warranted;  
• Proportion of subjects  in the m -MITT , CRE -ME, and ME Populations  
who demonstrate a response of overall success at the TOC visit;  
• Proportion of subjects  in the mCRE -MITT, m-MITT, CE,  CRE -ME, and 
ME Populations  with a clinical outcome of cure at Day 3, EOT, TOC,  and 
LFU;  
• Proportion of subjects in the mCRE -MITT, m -MITT, CE,  CRE -ME, and 
ME Populations with a clinical outcome of cure at TOC, where the use of 
an aminoglycoside beyond 72 hou rs in subjects with a pathogen 
susceptible to Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) is assigned  to failure;  
• Proportion of subjects  in the mCRE -MITT, m-MITT , CRE -ME, and ME 
Populations  with a microbiological  outcome of  eradication at Day 3, EOT, 
TOC, and LFU;  
• Relapse/recurrence rates of baseline bacteremia at the LFU visit;

Safety 
Assessments  The following will be assessed to determine the safety of Carbavance 
(meropenem/RPX7009) : 
• Assessment of adverse events from Day 1  through LFU visit (or , if applicable, 
early termination visit); and  
• Changes from baseline in physical examination findings, electrocardiograms 
(ECGs ), safety laboratory test results, and vital signs will be evaluated.  
Data Analysis  
 Sample Size Justification  
Due to the infeasibility of recruiting a large number of subjects infected with CRE 
pathogens, no formal power calculations have been performed for this study. The 
sample size is based on practical considerations.   
Criteria for Outcome Measures  
Study populations are as follows: ITT, MITT , Safety  Population , m-MITT, 
mCRE -MITT ( i.e., Primary Efficacy Population), CE, ME, and CRE -ME. Please 
refer to the Statistical Analysis Populations diagram provided in Appendix [ADDRESS_267152] 
binomial 95% confidence interval s for the true proportion of respo nses of success  
for the primary efficacy endpoint will be reported.  
Exploratory analyses will be conducted based on subject evaluability and may 
include clinical and microbiological responses in various analysis populations at 
EOT, TOC, and LFU.  
Pharmacoki netics  
Pharmacokinetic  characterization , evaluation of plasma PK, and  exposures of 
meropenem and RPX7009 in treated subjects  will be performed.  Analysis of the PK 
data will be described in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan.  
A pharmacodynamic analysis will be conducted to link meropenem and RPX7009 
exposures in each subject with clinical and microbiological outcomes.  
Safety  
All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug  (i.e., the MITT  Population ) 
will be included in the safety analyses  and analyzed based on actual treatment 
received . Adverse events will be collected throughout the study duration. 
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_222310]. The number and 
percentage of subjects in each treatment group reporting at least [ADDRESS_267153] 
1 occurrence of a serious adverse event will be tabulated.  The number and

CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -506 
24 APR 2015, Version 3.0  Page  29 of 116 a. Screening/baseline procedures may be performed up to [ADDRESS_267155] 
dose of study drug (Day 1).  The date of the first dose of study drug will be considered Day 1, and subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_222311].  
b. All subjects will be assessed on the ir last day of treatment ( any time from Day 7 to Day 14). The EOT visit activities sh ould occur within [ADDRESS_267156] ’s treatment is changed after [ADDRESS_267157] will complete further 
visits as planned.  
c. The TOC visit will occur 7 days (±2 days) after EOT , between Day [ADDRESS_267158] a TOC visit on Day 12 (+2  days).  
d. The LFU visit will occur 14 days (±2  days) after EOT , between D ay 19 to Day 30. The LFU visit should  be performed in -house (with limited physical exam ination ) if at all possible. If 
not possible, a phone call to assess the subject’s wellbeing  may be substituted.  Any subject receiving treatment for less than 7 days sho uld receive an LFU visit on Day 19 (+2  days) . For 
outpatient subjects with an LFU  visit occurring before Day 28, a phone call to assess survival will be made on Day 28.  
e. Subjects are expected to complete all study visits.  In circumstances where a subject discontinues the study early, early termination visit procedures are required.  
f. Demographic data will be collected, including name, sex, age, race, weight , and alcohol use.  
g. Height will be taken at screening only.  A limited, symptom -based, physical examination will be performed at indicated visits. If a subject does not display symptoms, no limited physica l 
examination needs to be performed.  
h. Assessment of signs and symptoms will include assessments to classify as new onset, co ntinuing (increased, decreased, no change), or resolved (returned to pre-infection  state) 
indication -based symptoms as outlined in the protocol.  
i. Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature.  Vital signs should be captu red at approximately the same time as the Signs and Symptoms assessment .  
j. A urine and serum pregnancy test will be performed before the first dose of study drug in women of childbearing potential , however, only urine results are required to initiate treatm ent. 
A urine and serum pregnancy test will be performed as part of EOT/ early termination procedures.  
k. Screening laboratories will  be processed/analyzed by [CONTACT_222312] 48 hours of randomization and include : AST, A LT, total bilirubin, creatinine, WBC count with 
differentials, platelet count, and LCE in urine.  
l. Laboratory samples will be collected, processed, and sent to the central lab oratory  for analysis. Hematology includes complete blood count (with red blood cell count, total WBC  count 
with differential counts, platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit). Serum chemistry includes creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, AST, ALT, alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, uric acid, lipase, amylase, albumin, total protein, glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, and phosphorus.  Urinalysis includes dipstick 
analysis of protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, nitrites, LCE, and urobilinogen; microscopic evaluation for red blood cells, WBCs,  bacteria, and casts; specific gravity; and pH . 
m. For subjects randomized to Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) only: Day [ADDRESS_267159] infusion . 
Day 3 and Day 5 plasma  PK samples will be collected within 30  minutes  after the end of one of that day’s  infusion s. 
n. Blood cultures are required from all study participants at baseline. All s ubjects with bacteremia will have daily blood cultures collected until the first negative blood culture (culture 
reading at 24  hours or more).  Subsequent blood cultures  may be collected at the Investigator’s discretion, but are not required.  Isolates from each positiv e culture will be sent to the 
central lab oratory .  
o. An adequate and appropriate infection site -specific specimen based upon diagnosis (e.g., cUTI or AP,  cIAI,  HABP, or VABP) should be obtained immediately prior  to the first dose of 
study drug  (or for cIAI, [ADDRESS_267160] dose of study drug)  and submitted to the local microbiology laboratory for culture and susceptibility testing.  If the 
screening sample for culture is taken per standard of care before the subject or th e subject’s legal representative signs informed consent, that isolate may be used for baseline and sent to 
the central laboratory once consent is obtained as long as the sample was collected within 72 hours  (96 hours for cIAI)  of the first dose of study dr ug. Additional samples for culture 
should also be collected at the specified time points. If at any point in the study a subject fails while on therapy, an adequate and appropriate spec imen should be obtained prior to the 
initiation of a new treatment.   When bacteremia is a subject’s primary index infection, daily blood cultures will be collected until the first negative blood c ulture (culture reading at 
24 hours or more). When cIAI is the subject’s baseline infection, post -baseline samples should be collec ted as clinically indicated.  
p. A chest x -ray, MRI , or CT  scan done within 48 hours of enrollment is acceptable . 
q.  The Blinded Investigator will be responsible for establishing a baseline level of health and performing outcome assessments independent of the un blinded staff per the Blinded 
Adjudication Charter .

In the current era of increased resistance to extended spectrum cephalosporins and penicillin/  
beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenem antim icrobial agents are frequently the 
antibiotics of “last defense” for the most resistant pathogens in serious infections. However, the 
recent dissemination of serine carbapenemases ( e.g., Klebsiella  pneumoniae  carbapenemase 
[KPC]) in Enterobacteriaceae within many U nited States (US)  and global hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222242] a 
considerable threat to carbapenem and other members of the beta -lactam class of antimicrobial 
agents.1,2,3 
Infections caused by [CONTACT_222295] -resistant Enterobacteriaceae  (CRE) are associated with high 
mortality rates and have limited treatment options.1 The loss of the carbapenem class of 
antimicrobial agents for treatment of Enterobacteriaceae  (the most frequently occurring pathogens 
in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]), Acinetobacter bauma nnii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa  represent s a 
critical setback in modern patient care.  
Meropenem is a broad -spectrum injectable carbapenem antibiotic used to treat a wide variety of 
infections. The spectrum of action includes many gram -positive bacteria, gram -negative bacteria, 
and anaerobic bacter ia, and it is approved in many countries around the world at doses up to 2 g 
every 8  hours (q8h). Three -hour infusions of meropenem are commonly used to treat organisms 
with higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa,  to 
maximize the time above the MIC.  
RPX7009 is a novel beta-lactamase inhibitor that has inhibitory activity against many serine 
beta-lactamases and was optimized for inhibition of the KPC beta -lactamase and the potentiation 
of carbapenems against Enterobac teriaceae . RPX7009 is being developed for use with 
meropenem to address the challenges of treatment of serious infections caused by [CONTACT_222315].  
Carbavance, the combination of meropenem and RPX7009 administered  as a fixed combination 
by [CONTACT_33980] ( IV) infusion, is being developed to treat serious gram -negative infections, such as 
complicated urinary tract infections  (cUTI ), acute pyelonephritis  (AP), complicated 
intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) , hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acqu ired bacterial pneumonia  (HABP ), 
ventilator -associated bacterial pneumonia  (VABP ), and bacteremia, including those infections 
caused by [CONTACT_222316].

CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -506 
24 APR 2015, Version 3.0  Page  40 of 116 To inform on the efficacy of these regimens as well as the target patient population with CRE 
infections, Rempex recently performed an internation al, multi -center, retrospective study of 
infections due to known CRE (Study 506NH). This study was conducted in 22 major medical 
centers in 4 countries – the US, [LOCATION_006], Italy and Greece . The study population  consisted of male and 
female patients, over 18 year s of age with serious bacterial infection s including cUTI/AP, HABP , 
VABP , and bacteremia due to known carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae  occurring over a 
6 month period from  September 1, 2013 to March 1, 2014. Data were  collected from 257 patients 
with known CRE infections: 76 cases of cUTI/ AP, 21 cases of HABP, 20 cases of VABP, and 140 
cases of bacteremia. Among study patients, there was a high prevalence of comorbid conditions: 
overall 33% of study patients had moderate -to-severe renal disease, with 20% requiring 
hemodialysis ; 35% of patie nts had underlying malignancy ; 16% of patients had undergone prior 
organ/tissue transplantation ; and 16% of patients had deep -tissue infection (predominantly cIAI ) 
(See Table 2). The average duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222262] 22 days. The average duration of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222263] 14 days, with 
an average duration of intensive care unit stay  of 8 days. The outcomes associated with these 
infections were poor. The average 28 -day mortality was 28% with an in -house mortality of 33 %. 
These mortality rates varied by [CONTACT_35151], with cUTI showing the lowest 28 -day mortality rate  
(18%) and VABP  the h ighest at 35%.  Rates of both clinical and microbiological cure were 
correspondingly poor. Only 41% of patients achieved a response of clinical cure and only 52% of 
patients had a microbiological response of eradication of the baseline pathogen. These data indicate 
the significant comorbidities, the underlying severity of illness and the poor outcomes associated 
with CRE infections and the need for new agents against CRE pathogens.  
Based on these data and in consultation with study investigators and key opi [INVESTIGATOR_46830] , the 
current amended protocol more accurately reflects the comorbidities and severity of illness 
associated with patients infected with CRE. The changes include  expanded  inclusion  criteria , 
allowing patients with moderate -severe renal dysfunct ion, neutropenia, and patients on 
immunosuppressive medications to be included , and a modification of the exclusion criteria – 
eliminating exclusion of patients with neuromuscular disorders, elevated liver function tests , and 
history of seizure disorders . The goal of these changes is to  make the study population more 
representative of the eventual target patient population of Carbavance – specifically patients with 
severe infections due to carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae .

7.2 Carbavance  (Meropenem/RPX7009)  
Carba vance (meropenem/RPX7009) is a combination of the approved carbapenem antibiotic 
meropenem and the investigational beta -lactamase inhibitor RPX7009. This drug combination is 
being developed for IV administration for the treatment of patients with severe gram-negative 
infections, including those caused by [CONTACT_222318].  
Meropenem is a broad -spectrum carbapenem antibiotic active against gram -positive and 
gram -negative bacteria, including the Enterobacteriaceae  (the most frequ ently occurring 
pathogens in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885]) and other key pathogens associated with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired 
infections, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter sp. , and anaerobes. While meropenem 
has excellent stability to many bacterial beta-lactamases (the major pathway of resistance to 
penicillins and cephalosporins), resistance to meropenem (and other carbapenems) can be 
mediated by [CONTACT_130039] A serine carbapenemases, especially KPC.  Meropenem is approved in most 
countries in the developed world. In many countries, meropenem is approved for treatment of both 
urinary tract infections ( UTIs) and cUTI s. In the US, it is marketed under the proprietary name [CONTACT_222361], Meropenem for Injection, [LOCATION_002] Pharmacopeia  (USP), 
and is indicated for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated 
intra-abdominal infections , and bacterial meningitis.[ADDRESS_267178] several clinically 
important bacterial beta -lactamases, particularly KPC. The pharmacological properties of

The Sponsor  has developed a n IV formulation of Carba vance (mero penem/RPX7009 ) for 
evaluation in clinical trials , and will administer Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) in a fixed 
combination by [CONTACT_16228].  
7.3 Microbiology  
7.3.1  Susceptibility Testing  
Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) has primary activity against gram -negative organisms. The 
potency and MIC s of Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) have been evaluated against a variety 
of contemporary clinical strains.  In the presence of RPX7009, the potency of meropenem was 
enhanced at least [ADDRESS_267180] strains. See  the 
Investigator’s Brochure.6 
7.4 Nonclinical Pharmacology and Toxicology  
A toxicology and safety assessment pr ogram to support clinical trials with RPX7009 was 
conducted. RPX7009 had no discernible effects in any of the safety pharmacology studies, 
demonstrated a similar pharmacokinetic (PK) profile to that of meropenem in preclinical species 
studies, and was devo id of mutagenic, clastogenic, and genotoxic effects for in vivo and in vitro 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) genotoxicity studies.  See the Investigator’s Brochure.6 
7.4.1  Mechanism of Action  
RPX7009 alone has no antimicrobial activity; however, when combined with meropenem in vitro 
and in vivo, it markedly enhanced the potency of meropenem against Enterobacteriaceae  strains 
expressing KPC enzymes.  See the I nvestigator’s Brochure.6 
7.4.2  Metabolism and Excretion  
There is no evidence of accumulation with multiple RPX7009 doses and no differences in PK 
between males and females. RPX7009 has low plasma protein binding, is stable in human 
microsomes and hepatocytes, and shows no induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes. It show s no inhibition of key renal transporters, nor does it appear to be a substrate of 
them.  See the Investigator’s Brochure.6 
7.5 Overview of Clinical Pharmacology  
7.5.1  Rempex 402 and Rempex 501  – Single and Multiple -Ascending Dose 
Studies in Healthy Volunteers  
Two ascending -dose studies in healthy volunteers have been conducted.  Both studies evaluated 
RPX7009 when administered as a [ADDRESS_267181]-in-human study evaluated RPX7009 alone ( Study 402 ), while the second study evaluated 
RPX7009 in combination with 1 g and 2 g doses of meropenem  (Rempex -501). The RPX7009 PK 
REMPEX PHARMACEUTICALS , INC.   Carbavance ™ (Meropenem/RPX7009)  
CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -506 
24 APR 2015, Version 3.0  Page  44 of 116 data from these two studies w ere very consistent and demonstrated the similarity of PK profiles 
between the two drugs, as well as a lack of drug -drug interaction.  The PK parameters for R PX7009 
after single and multiple 2 g doses administered either alone or in combination with a 1 g or 2 g 
dose of meropenem are shown in Table 4. The PK parameters of meropenem after single and 
multiple 1 g or 2 g doses administered either alone or in combination with RPX7009 doses of 1 g 
and/or 2 g are shown in Table 5.  
In both clinical studies, RPX7009 exposure in subjects (maximum plasma concentration [C max] 
and area under the concentration -time curve [AUC]) increased with increasing dose. The mean 
Cmax and AUC values for RP X7009 following administration of a 2  g dose q8h for 7  days were 
41 mg/L and 145 mg·h/mL, respectively.  The terminal half -life was less than 2 hours, resulting in 
no accumulation of drug between multiple doses of RPX7009 alone or in combination with 
meropenem.  Volume of distribution and plasm a clearance were independent of dose , and mean 
values ranged from 17.50 L to 24.95 L and 10.42 L/h to 17.61 L/h, respectively.   
There were no significant changes in RPX7009 PK when it was administered with 1  g or 2 g doses 
of meropenem.  Likewise, the PK pa rameters for meropenem, and its metabolite, hydrolyzed 
meropenem, remain unchanged with co -administration of RPX7009.

7.5.2  Rempex 503  – Randomized, Open -label Study of the Pulmonary 
Pharmacokinetics  of Meropenem and RPX7009 (Carbavance) in Healthy 
Volunteers  
Study 503 was a randomized, open -label study in healthy adult subjects to evaluate the plasma, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_71444] (ELF), and alveolar macrophage (AM) penetration of a single dose level of 
2 g of meropenem/2 g of RPX7009 (Carbavance) after 3 doses, giv en 8 hours apart, administered 
as 3-hour infusions; safety and tolerability were also evaluated.  
Twenty -five subjects underwent  bronchoscopy and  BAL  at 1 of 5  time points (1.5, 3.25, 4, 6, and 
8 hours) after the third dose of IV meropenem and RPX7009 . Bronchial alveolar lavage samples 
provide d ELF and AM concentrations for meropenem and RPX7009 for pulmo nary PK analysis, 
and b lood samples provide d plasma concentrations for meropenem and RPX7009 plasma PK 
analysis.  
Preliminary data showed that IV dosing of 2 g meropenem/2 g RPX7009 (Carbavance) every 
8 hours, administered as 3 -hour infusions, produced steady -state ELF concentrations of 
approximately 50% and 60% of simultaneous plasma concentrations for RPX700 and meropene m, 
respectively.  See the Investigator ’s Brochure  for details .6

the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Carbavance in Subjec ts With Renal 
Insufficiency  (Including Subjects  on Standard Hemodialysis )  
Study 504 wa s an open -label study in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal insufficiency , 
including those requiring hemodialysis (HD),  or normal renal function. The safety and PK of a 
single IV dose of 1 g meropenem plus 1 g RPX7009 (Carbavance), infused over 3 hours, was 
evaluated.  Forty -one subjects were enrolled in  5 groups  based on their degree of renal 
insufficiency .  
Preliminary da ta demonstrate that meropenem and RPX7009 plasma clearance followed a linear 
PK model in subjects with decreasing renal function  (see Appendix  4). This allows the ratio of 
meropenem and RPX7009 to be maintained for dose adjustment in subjects with reduced renal 
function  (See the Investigator’s Brochure6). For subjects with an estimated  creatinine clearance 
below 20  ml/min , including  those on standard hemodialysis, data w ere recently obtained, and 
[ADDRESS_267188] included subjects with an estimated creatinine clearance between 
10 ml/min and 19  ml/min (including those requiring hemodialysis). The second included all 
subjects with an estimated creatinine clearance below 10 ml/min (including those on 
hemodialysis).   
For subjects with an estimated creatinine clearance  of 10 -19 ml/min, the dosing strategy with the 
highest probability of target attainment was 500  mg of Car bavance (500  mg meropenem/500  mg 
RPX7009) every 12 hours. For subjects with estimated creatinine clearance below 10 ml/min , a 
dose of Carbavance (500  mg meropenem/500  mg RPX7009) every [ADDRESS_267189] exposure 
achieved in this study, which was well tolerated in the setting of twice weekly hemodialysis. 
Subjects with  an estimated creatinine clearance  of less than 10 ml/min are required to receive 
dialysis at least twice per week.  
Based on this data, the following are recommended Carbavance dosing regimens for subjects with 
impaired renal function.

Maintenance doses of Carbavance in these subjects  should be administered as soon as possible after the dialysis session. For 
example, if a subject is scheduled to receive Carbavance at 18:00 but receives hemodialysis at 13:00, the planned 1 8:00 
Carbavance dose should be given after the dialysis session is completed (rather than waiting until 18:00).

24 APR 2015, Version 3.0  Page  48 of 116 7.6 Justification of Carbavance Dose Selection for Registration Clinical 
Program  
The Carbavance  (meropenem/RPX7009)  program was initiate d with the goal of treating 
KPC -containing Enterobacteria ceae by [CONTACT_222319]7009 and improving the 
coverage against P. aeruginosa  and Acinetobacter  spp. by [CONTACT_222320].  
The PK -pharmacodynamic  parameter for efficacy of meropenem is free drug time above the MIC 
and the magnitude of this parameter necessary to achieve maximal efficacy is free drug above the 
MIC for 30 % to 50% of the dosage interval.  From the PK data obtained in Rempex -501, a 
meropenem dose of 2  g administered by 3 hour infusion every 8  hours will maintain concentrations 
above the 8 mg/L for 30 % to 50% of the dosage interval.[ADDRESS_267190] strains containing the KPC enzyme (or expressing KPC) 
as well as reduce the development of resistance during therapy.  Based on in vitro resistance  
development studies, a minimum concentration of 8 mg/L of  RPX7009 (in combination with 
8 mg/L of meropenem) was required to be present for 24 hours to prevent resistance.  This became 
the basis for the  minimum AUC (8 mg/L * 24 h = 192 mg*h/L ) target in animal model s and in 
vitro  pharmacodynamic  models.  From the data obtained from Rempex -501, a dose of 2  g 
administered by 3 hour infusion every 8 hours was required to maintain an AUC above 192 
mg*h/L.6 This RPX7009 dosage regimen has been chosen for this study and for the Registrati on 
Clinical Development Program.  
The selected combination dosage regimen of 2 g meropenem /[ADDRESS_267191] Enterobacteriaceae  and 
P. aeruginosa  strains with Carbavance MI Cs as high as 8 mg/L.  In each of these models, the dosage 
regimen proved to not only be efficacious, but prevented the development of resistance in those 
studies.  If this data is confirmed in the Registration Clinical Development Program, it may justify 
a Carbavance MIC breakpoint as high as 8 mg/L.  
Overall, based on the PK data from Rempex -501 and the in vitro  and in vivo  PK and 
pharmacodynamic  data generated, the dose of 2  g meropenem in combination with 2  g RPX7009 
infused over 3 hours, every 8 hours, wa s chosen for development.  
7.7 Overview of Clinical Safety  
7.7.1  Rempex 402 and Rempex 501 – Single and Multiple -Ascending Dose 
Studies in Healthy Volunteers  
There have been no safety signals identified in the clinical pharmacology studies conducted with 
RPX7009 alone ( Study 402 ) and in combination with meropenem ( Rempex -501).  Events related 
to the infusion site (dosing catheter) and/or PK catheter site (blood collections only) were the most 
prevalent events reported and were evenly distributed across subjects tre ated with placebo, 
RPX7009 alone, meropenem alone, and meropenem/RPX7009, indicating no evidence of local 
adverse events related to RPX7009 dosing, either alone or in combination with meropenem.  
Common adverse events in subjects treated with RPX7009 or mer openem/RPX7009, outside of 
REMPEX PHARMACEUTICALS , INC.   Carbavance ™ (Meropenem/RPX7009)  
CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -506 
24 APR 2015, Version 3.0  Page  49 of 116 infusion site/PK catheter site events, were limited to headache, lethargy, dizziness, nausea, and 
diarrhea.  Of these events, headache was the most frequently reported adverse event in both studies, 
being reported in 42% of subjec ts in RPX7009 multiple -dose groups in Study 402 and 30% in 
meropenem/RPX7009 dose groups in Rempex -501. In comparison, the incidence of headache was 
50% in subjects treated with meropenem alone in Rempex -501, and 25% in subjects treated with 
placebo in Stu dies [ADDRESS_267192] in Rempex -501, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_222265].  
Lethargy was reported in Study 402 in 1 of 6 subjects (17%) that received RPX7009 1 g q8h and 
4 of 6 subje cts (67%) that received RPX7009 2 g q8h , for an overall incidence of 21% in subjects 
treated with RPX7009 in Study 402; however, lethargy was not reported in a single subject that 
received RPX7009 alone or in combination with meropenem q8h in Rempex -501. All epi[INVESTIGATOR_222266] [ADDRESS_267193] (4%) each in 
Study  402 and 4 (9%) subjects that received either RPX7009 250 mg alone (1 of 8 subjects  [13%] 
for each event)  or a combination of meropenem/RPX7009 (3 of 37 subjects [8%] for each event)  
in Rempex -501. In addition, 1 (6%) and 2 (13%) subjects that received meropenem 1 g reported 
dizziness and diarrhea, respectively.  All epi[INVESTIGATOR_222267] , nausea, and diarrhea were 
considered mild in severity.  
Two subjects in Remepx -501 had asymptomatic elevations in their alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) levels to > [ADDRESS_267194] was in the  meropenem 1 g cohort and one was in the meropenem/RPX7009 1 g/ 2 g cohort. 
Neither were associated with alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin elevations and both resolved 
spontaneously after study drug treatment was completed. There were no other clinically s ignificant 
trends in clinical laboratory parameters, or clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical 
examinations, or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in either study.  
7.7.2  Rempex 503  – Randomized, Open -label Study of the Pulmonary 
Pharmacokinetics  of Meropenem and RPX7009 (Carbavance) in Healthy 
Volunteers  
Study 503 was a randomized , open -label , PK study conducted in healthy adult male and female 
subjects  to evaluate the lung penetration of 2 g meropenem /2 g RPX7009 (Carbavance) every 
8 hours admin istered as a 3 -hour infusion . Twenty -five subjects underwent  bronchoscopy and  
BAL  at 1 of 5  time points (1.5, 3.25, 4, 6, and 8 hours) after the third dose of IV meropenem and 
RPX7009 . Bronchial alveolar lavage samples provide d ELF and AM concentrations for 
meropenem and RPX7009 for pulmo nary PK analysis, and b lood samples provide d plasma 
concentrations for meropenem and RPX7009 plasma PK analysis.    
Twenty -six subjects were randomized and [ADDRESS_267195] ew 
from the study during the second infusion of meropenem/RPX7009 because of chest pressure of 
unknown etiology that was moderate in intensity, lasted 90 minutes, resolved spontaneously when 
the infusion was stopped, and was considered by [CONTACT_222321].  
Carbavance (meropenem/ RPX7009 ) given as a 2 g/2 g dose was  well tolerated in Study 503.

7.7.3  Rempex 504  – Open -label Study of the Safety and PK of a Single Dose of 
Meropenem and RPX7009 (Carbavance) in Volunteers with Varying 
Degrees of Renal Insufficiency or Normal Renal Function, and in 
Patients with Hemodialys is 
All subjects in the normal, mild, moderate, and severe renal fu nction groups received a single  
3-hour IV infusion of Carbavance (1 g meropenem and 1 g RPX7009).  Subject s in the end stage 
renal disease ( ESRD ) group received two infusions , one  infusion im mediately prior to HD, and 
the other infusion following HD on different days separated by a washout period to ensure that 
study drug administration was at least 6 days apart and no more than 14 days apart.  
Overall, 14 subjects (34.1%) reported a total of 2 0 treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) 
during the conduct of the study. The most frequently reported TEAEs were diarrhoea, headache, 
abdominal pain, and dermatitis contact . All TEAEs were mild in severity except  1 moderate TEAE 
(abdominal pain) and 2 severe TEAEs (1 prostate cancer metastatic and 1 diarrhoea haemorrhagic).  
A similar proportion of subjects reported at least 1 TEAE in the mild (2 subjects [25.0%]),  
moderate (3 subjects [37.5%]), severe ([ADDRESS_267197] [12.5%]), and normal (2 subjects [25.0%])  renal 
function groups. I n the ESRD group, a large r proportion of subjects in Period 2 (i.e., when dialysis 
occurred prior to study drug administration) (5 subjects [62.5%] ) reported TEAEs as compared to 
the Period 1 group (2 subjects [22.2%]; i.e., when d ialysis occurred after study drug 
administration); however, the type and severity of these adverse events  in the  ESRD group were 
similar to those adverse events  observed in the other renal function groups.  The higher incidence 
of these mild TEAEs reported during Period 2, as opposed to Period 1, is consistent with the PK 
data indicating that both meropenem and RPX7009 are cleared by [CONTACT_121264].  
Eight of the 20 TEAEs reported in the study were either “possibly” or “probably” related to study 
treatment and were reported by 7 subjects (17.1%). Only 1 TEAE (prostate cancer metastatic) was 
ongoing at study completion. Two (2) SAEs were reported (1 prostate cancer metastatic and 
1 diarrhoea haemorrhagic) in subjects with ESRD. The event of prostate cancer metast atic resulted 
in an interruption to study drug dose administration, and the subject did not receive the second 
dose. No adverse events  resulted in death.  
There were no clinically significant trends in 12 -lead ECG data, vital signs data, clinical laboratory  
results, or physical examination data.  
Overall Carbavance was well tolerated across all levels of renal insufficiency, including in subjects 
with severe  renal insufficiency  and those on hemodialysis. Guidelines on dosing of Carbavance in 
subjects with ren al impairment is outlined in Section  11.1.2 .

9.1 Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, multi -center,  randomized,  open -label study of Carbavance (meropenem/  
RPX7009) versus BAT  in the treatment of subjects with selected serious infections, specifically 
cUTI or AP, cIAI,  HABP, VABP, and bacteremia, suspected or known to be caused by [CONTACT_222299].  See 
Appendix 2  for a flow diagram of the study.  
For this study, the specif ic serious infections selected for study will be defined as the following:  
• Complicated UTI  (cUTI)  is a urinary infection occurring in a subject  with a structural or 
functional abnormality of the genitourinary tract associated with clinical signs and sympto ms. 
• Acute pyelonephritis (AP) is an acute infection of the renal pelvis or parenchyma associated 
with clinical signs and symptoms.  
• Complicated Intra -abdominal Infection (cIAI) is an infection in the abdominal cavity which 
extends beyond the hollow viscus o f origin (bowel, stomach, gallbladder, etc.) into the 
peritoneal space and is associated with either a bscess formation or peritonitis associated with 
clinical signs and symptoms.   
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] -acquired bacterial pneumonia  (HABP)  is an acute infection of the p ulmonary 
parenchyma that is associated with clinical signs and symptoms in a subject  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222268] [ADDRESS_267199] admitted from a long -term acute care or rehabilitation 
center , or admitted from home 7 days after discharge from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222269].  
• Ventilator -associated bacterial pneumonia  (VABP)  is an acute infection of the pulmonary 
parenchyma that is associated with clinical signs and symptoms beginning more than [ADDRESS_267200]  receives ventilatory suppo rt via an endotracheal (or nasotracheal) tube.  
• Bacteremia is defined by [CONTACT_46917] a bacterial pathogen in a blood culture that is not 
thought to be a contaminant . Subjects enrolled with the indication of bacteremia will not have 
concurrent HABP, VABP , cIAI,  or cUTI/AP infections. However, subjects enrolled with 
HABP, VABP , or cUTI/AP may also have concurrent secondary bacteremia.  
Approximately [ADDRESS_267201] 7 days of treatment with IV 
antibiotics  will be enrolled in a  2:1 ratio of Carbavance to BAT , respectively.   
The Treatment Arms in the study are as follows:  
• Treatment Arm A:  Subjects (n = 100) will receive Carbavance (meropenem 2  g plus RPX7009 
2 g) IV q8h, with each dose infused for 3 hours for up to 14 days.  
NOTE:  Dose adjustments will be required for subjects with renal insufficiency (see Section  
11.1.2 ). 
• Treatment Arm B:  Subjects (n = 50) will receive BAT  with IV antibiotics chosen from the 
following list, either in combination  or alone, for up to 14 days:  carbapenem  (meropenem, 
ertapenem,  or imipenem ), tigecycline, colistin, aminoglycosides  (amikacin, tobramycin  or 
gentamicin ), polymyxin B , and ceftazidime -avibactam .

CRE infection (based on colonization with a KPC -producing Enterobacteriaceae  organism  [which 
may be determined through rapid diagnostic tests, active surveillance cultures, or other 
documentation of CRE colonization] in the past [ADDRESS_267202] 90 days) will be  randomized  to receive Carbavance 
(meropenem/RPX7009) or BAT .  
Any isolated bacterial pathogen will be identified by [CONTACT_222322]. The local laboratory will 
culture each subject sample for pathogen identification, quantification, and susc eptibility testing. 
Isolated pathogens collected at the time points listed in Table [ADDRESS_267203] day of study drug  administration (Carbavance [ meropenem/  RPX7009] 
or BAT ). Subsequent study days are defined by [CONTACT_222323]. The 
planned total duration of IV study drug  therapy is up to [ADDRESS_267204] receive [ADDRESS_267205] 
receive 3 days  of study drug  therapy.  
End of Treatment  (EOT) will be the day on which the final dose of study drug  is administered  
(+1 day). The Test  of Cure (TOC) visit and Late Follow -up (LFU) visit will occur at time points  
as defined in the Schedule of Procedures ( Table 1). 
9.1.1  Blinding  
This is an open label study and the Principal Investigator  (PI), study coordinators, and pharmacy 
staff will not be blinded.  However, the measures outlined below will be implemented in order to 
optimize unbiased assessments  of outcomes between treatment arms  at the investigational site.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject Treatment  Bias  
In order to ensure unbiased assessment of outcomes between treatment arms , subjects will not be 
informed what treatment arm they are assigned.  Efforts should be made to keep subjects  naïve to 
their treatment throughout the course of the study .  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Blinded Investigator (BI)  
Each site will assign a Blinded Investigator (s) (BI) to eva luate criteria for Clinical Outcomes 
during designated study visits (See  Table 1). A BI must be qualified to perform medical evaluations 
and determine medical diagnoses  (e.g., physician, physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner 
[within the U S]). A BI should have no other role in the study other than making blinded 
assessments.  For con sistency, whenever possible the same BI should complete all blinded 
assessments for a study subject.  All efforts should be made to keep a BI blinded during the course 
of the study.  Data collection by [CONTACT_222324].   
REMPEX PHARMACEUTICALS , INC.   Carbavance ™ (Meropenem/RPX7009)  
CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -[ADDRESS_267206] (DSMB) will review accumulated safety data for 
this study and Rempex -505 when the total combined enrollment in both trials is approximately 
25% (250 sub jects) and 50% (500 subjects).  They will also review serious adverse events on an 
ongoing basis.  They will make recommendations to the Sponsor based on this safety data.  Further 
details regarding the data safety monitoring guidelines will be included in th e DSMB Charter, 
which is the governing document of the DSMB.   
9.2.2  Blinded Adjudication Committee   
A blinded adjudication committee will also be formed to independently evaluate clinical outcome  
data in cases where the PI ’s and BI’s assessment of outcome differ . In these instances the decision 
made by [CONTACT_11146] a djudication committee will factor into the final clinical outcome data as 
described in Section 15.1.[ADDRESS_267207] population.  Therefore, 
using the BAT  with any of the following IV antibiotics, alone or in combination, is the appropriate 
option  for this study:  carbapenems (m eropenem, ertapenem, imipenem ), tigecycline, colistin, 
aminoglycoside ( amikacin, tobramycin, gentamicin ), polymyxin  B, and (where available) 
ceftazidime -avibactam . 
Randomization will be  used to assure that study populations are similar between  the test and 
control groups, and to avoid systemic differences between the [ADDRESS_267208] outcome.

and are treated with ceftazidime -avibactam should receive Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or 
ceftazidime -avibactam alone , respectively . 
Subjects w ith cIAI, HABP, VABP, or bacteremia who are randomized to Carbavance 
(meropenem/ RPX7009)  or to BAT and are trea ted with ceftazidime -avibactam should receive 
Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or ceftazidime -avibactam  alone , respectively . However, if 
the Inves tigator believes it is medically necessary, subjects may receive supportive 
aminoglycoside therapy in conjunction with Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) or 
ceftazidime -avibactam until culture information is available or for the first [ADDRESS_267219]’s organism is 
shown to be susceptible to Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009)  or ceftazidime -avibactam  and the 
subject is clinically improving.  The use of an aminoglycoside beyond 72 hou rs in subjects with a 
pathogen(s) susceptible to Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) or ceftazidime -avibactam will be 
considered a treatment failure.  
Inhaled antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, are not permitted.  
Bladder irrigation with antibiotics or antibiotics administered directly via a urinary catheter are 
not permitted.  
Intra -abdominal irrigation with antibiotics or antibiotics administered through a peritoneal 
dialysis catheter or other intra -abdominal catheter are not permitted.   
10.3.3  Permitted Anti -infective Adjunctive Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_222272] l care for superficial wound s is permitted ( i.e., topi[INVESTIGATOR_222273], topi[INVESTIGATOR_222274], wet-to-dry dressing change). The use of t opi[INVESTIGATOR_222275] -negative  organisms is discouraged , but will not constitute a failure of the primary antibiotic 
regim en if administered .  
10.3.4  Concomitant Medication Precautions and Exclusions  
Caution should be used in subjects receiving concurrent valproic acid or probenecid as u se of 
carbapenems may lower the serum concentration of these agents.   Physicians are therefore advised 
to consider checking serum levels of these agents frequently in patients receiving concurrent 
Carbavance or carbapenems . A one -time dose of vecuronium, r ocuronium , or other paralytic agent  
during intubation is permitted. Due to drug -drug interactions between rocuronium, vecuronium , 
and similar paralytic agents and several BAT agents (including aminoglycosides and polymyxins) 
investigators are cautioned not  to choose aminoglycosides or polymyxins as BAT in patients with  
ongoing receipt (i.e. continuous infusion) of rocuronium, vecuronium , or other paralytic agent .   
10.4 Randomization and Treatment Group Assignment  
Subjects will be randomized to receive either Ca rbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) or BAT  through 
a centralized Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). The time and date of randomization will 
be recorded on the IWRS confirmation, which will be the reference time point for screening 
procedures and diagnostic t ime windows. The subject will only be randomized after the inclusion 
and exclusion criteria are verified. A manual will be provided that describes the IWRS and includes 
complete user instructions.

in the cUTI and/or cIAI indications, data from these subjects may be submitted to regulatory 
agencies in support of a marketing application, and the enrollment of additional subjects in to the 
specific indication(s) where enrollment was met may be stopped.  
Subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio. A randomization notification will be sent to the 
appropriate site personnel; it will contain subject identification information and the treat ment 
assignment for entry onto the eCRF.

Intravenous study drug  will be administered in a n open -label  design. The following drugs will be 
administered in this study:  
• Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) for IV infusion , administered as a 2  g/2 g dose diluted in 
normal saline to a volume of 250 mL and infused for 3 hours q8h; and 
• Subjects will receive BAT , with IV antibiotics, either alone or in combination, chosen from 
the following: carbapenem (me ropenem, ertapenem, or imipenem ), tigecycline, colistin, 
aminoglycoside (amikacin, tobramycin, or gentamicin), polymyxin B , and 
ceftazidime -avibactam . Details for dose and frequency of administration of BAT  (as well as 
warnings, precautions, and contraindications) can be found in the referenced summaries of 
product characteristics  for the  specific antibacterials  selected by [CONTACT_222327] .4,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,[ADDRESS_267221] only country -approved  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Infusions of IV study drug s will occur for 7 to 14  days.  Subjects whose cultured pathogen is sho wn 
not to be susceptible to Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) or the treatment chosen as BAT  may 
continue that treatment as long as the subject is clinically improving. If, more than [ADDRESS_267222] is not clinically improving, and th e cultured pathogen is shown 
not to be susceptible to Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) or the treatment chosen as BAT  and 
the Investigator elects to change antibacterial therapy, EOT procedures should be performed and 
the subject should complete further visi ts as planned.  
11.1 Description of Carbavance (Meropenem /RPX7009 ) 
Meropenem is a white to pale yellow crystalline powder. The solution varies from colorless to 
yellow depending on the concentration. When reconstituted as instructed, each 1 g vial will deliver 
1 g of meropenem for injection.  
RPX7009 is a sterile, lyophilized white to off -white powder presented in 20 mL single -use vials. 
Each  labeled vial contains enough RPX7009 to deliver  either  500 mg  or 1000 mg  RPX7009 when 
reconstituted and prepared according to instructions. Once reconstituted, it is a clear, colorless to 
yellow solution.  
11.1.1  Administration of Carbavance (Meropenem/RPX7009)  
A pharmacist will be responsible for providing Carbavance (meropenem/RPX70 09) to the study 
personnel for administration. The study drug will be provided ready for IV infusion. Subjects will 
receive Carbavance (meropenem/RPX7009) 2 g/[ADDRESS_267223] be recorded. Instances 
where a dose is interrupted by [CONTACT_726] 10  minutes should be noted in the source documents , 
including the reason for interruption. The reasons for missed doses should be noted in the source 
documents.  Subjects will receive infusions every 8 hours (±2 hours). Infusions that fall outside of 
that q8h dosing (± 2 hours) will be captured as protocol  deviations.

Maintenance doses of Carbavance in these subjects should be administered as soon as possible after the dialysis session. For 
example, if a subject is scheduled to receive Carbavance at 18:00 but receives hemodialysis at 13:00, the planned 18:00 
Carbavance dose should be given after the d ialysis session is completed (rather than waiting until 18:00).  
q8h = every 8 hours; q12h = every 12 hours; q24h = every [ADDRESS_267225] Available Therapy  
Subjects randomized to BAT  will be treated with IV antibiotics, either alone or in combination, 
chosen from the following: carbapenem  (meropenem, ertapenem,  or imipenem ), tigecycline, 
colistin, aminoglycosides  (amikacin, tobramycin  or gentamicin ), polymyxin B , and 
ceftazidime -avibactam . The doses and combinations for BAT  will be determined by [CONTACT_3786].   
Ceftazidime -avibactam may also be used as BAT, but may not be given in combination with other 
BAT agents, with the exception of concurrent aminoglycoside therapy for eit her 72 hours/pending 
susceptibility testing in patients with cIAI, HABP, VABP and bacteremia , similar to Carbavance

standards  and recorded in the electronic data capture (E DC) database according to the EDC 
guidelines .  
12.4.[ADDRESS_267244] X -Ray/Radiology  
Chest x -rays, CT scans or MRIs will be performed in subjects with HABP or VABP at designated 
time points  as specified by [CONTACT_222332] ( Table 1) to evaluate for the presence of 
infiltrates.  Imaging should be conducted per institution al guidelines  and results record ed in the 
source documents and the eCRF . 
12.4.9  Clinical Laboratory Assessments  
Blood samples for serum chemistry  and hematology  analyses  will be  collected as specified by [CONTACT_222333] ( Table 1).  
Eligibility criteria related to laboratory assessments (i.e., screening labo ratory assessments) will 
be processed/analyzed  by a local laboratory  within [ADDRESS_267245], ALT, total bilirubin, creatinine, white blood cell ( WBC ) count with 
differentials, platelet count, and leukocyt e esterase (LCE) in urine.  
All other study -related analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_2237].  
The chemistry, hematology , and urinalysis  parameters assessed in this study include the following:  
• Chemistry:  creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen , AST, ALT, 
alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin,  uric acid, lipase, amylase,  albumin,  total protein, 
glucose, sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, calcium, and phosphorus.  
• Hematology: complete blood count (red blood cell count and white blood cell (WBC) count 
with differentials  (manual differential at baseline) , platelet count, hemoglobin, and 
hematocrit).  
• Urinalysis: dipstick analysis  of protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, nitrites,  LCE, and 
urobilinogen;  microscopic e valuation  for red blood cells, WBCs, bacteria, and casts;  specific 
gravity ; and pH.  
For women of childbearing  potential, a  serum and urine pregnancy test will be performed before 
the first dose of study drug, however, only urine results are required to ini tiate treatment . A urine 
and serum pregnancy test will be performed at EOT  or early termination.  
12.4.10  Pharmacokinetic Sampling  
Pharmacokinetic sampling will be completed in subjects randomized to Carbavance 
(meropenem/RPX7009) only. Samples will be collected for PK analysis on Day 1 within  
REMPEX PHARMACEUTICALS , INC.   Carbavance ™ (Meropenem/RPX7009)  
CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -[ADDRESS_267246] infusion. On Day 3 and Day 5, PK samp les 
will be collected within  30 minutes after the end of one of that day’s  infusion s. Samples will be 
taken as close to the [ADDRESS_267247] was discharged to (e.g., 
home, another hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], long term adult care facility, etc.).  
12.4.12  Mechanical Ventilator Assessments  
Subjects whose primary indication for enrollment into the s tudy is HABP or VABP, and require 
mechanical ventilation support, will be managed by [CONTACT_222334]. Data regarding mechanical ventilation will be captured in the source documents and 
the eCRFs.  
12.4.13  Infection Source Contro l  
It is expected that prior to enrollment adequate source control (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_17439]) should be 
achieved for each subject’s index infection (for example, for a subject enrolled due to cIAI, the 
intra-abdominal source should be properly drained/debrided/removed; for a subject with cUTI, any 
indwelling catheter should be removed or replaced).  Any secondary drainage that occurs within [ADDRESS_267248]’s participation in 
the study  to the extent possible (i.e. if the subject has a recurrent intra -abdominal abscess, this 
should be drained in accordance with site -specific practices ).  A qualified independent reviewer 
will access the adequacy of source control in subjects whose outcome is clinical failure, death or 
indeterminate . Additional medical records will be collected and submitted to the reviewer as 
appropriate.  
12.4.14  Microbiology A ssessments  
Accurate microbiologic results are critical to successfully meet the study objectives.  All specimens 
will be sent to the local laboratory for culture and susceptibility  testing  per institutional standards . 
For all carbapenem -resistant gram -negat ive organisms, the MIC to carbapenems will be captured 
in the eCRF. Susceptibility to Carbavance as determined by [CONTACT_222302] -Bauer disk methodology  will 
be captured at baseline . If the resistance mechanism for each carbapenem -resistant organism 
cultured during the study  is known, it  should be captured in source documents.

obtained no more than 72 hours p rior to  (or for cIAI , 96 hours before or  24 hours after)  the first 
dose of study drug are acceptable. The results of this culture will determine whether the subject 
meets the criteria for the Microbiological CRE Modified Intent -to-Treat (mCRE -MITT) 
Populat ion or the Microbiological Modified Intent -to-Treat (m -MITT) Population.  
Kirby -Bauer disks for Carbavance (meropenem \RPX7009) susceptibility testing will be provided 
by [CONTACT_222303] . Susceptibility testing for BAT  and other antimicrobia ls will be 
done per each insti tution’s standard procedures. In instances where susceptibility testing indicates 
resistance to the study drug but the subject is clinically improving, the subject should remain on 
study drug at the Investigator’s discretion.  
If the screening sample for culture is taken per standard of care before the subject  (or a subject’s 
legal representative)  signs informed consent, that isolate may be used for baseline and sent to the 
central lab oratory once consent is obtained as long as the sample was collected within 72 hours of 
(or for cIAI , 96 hours before or  24 hours after)  the first dose of study drug . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Urine Specimens  
For subjects with cUTI or AP, urine samples will be collected by [CONTACT_222335], from a 
newly -inserted Foley catheter (no bag specimens allowed), bladder needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], or ureter 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
CRE isolates at baseline, and all post -baseline isolates cultured at the local laboratory and 
designated as pathogens by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_222278].  
The baseline urine cultures must grow at least one defined bacterial pathogen at concentration of 
105 CFU/mL. Up to 2  isolated pathogens will be allowed per baseline urine culture provid ed they 
are at concentrations of 105 CFU/mL of urine.  
The baseline urine samples submitted for culture must have a microscopic evaluation (e.g., gram

Post-baseline specimens should be collected as clinically indicated and sent to the local laboratory 
for testing. Isolates from all post -baseline specimens should be sent to the central laboratory for 
confirmatory testing.  
To be considered adequate, a specimen should consist of at least 1mL of fluid or tissue 
representative of the materi al associated with the clinical infection.  
Gram stains will be conducted per institutional standards and gram stain data should be captured 
in source documents. If any intra -abdominal culture is performed (including cultures taken on 
swab), pathogens exhi biting significant growth on cultures identified by [CONTACT_50821]’s 
routine procedures should be sent to the central lab, even if from a specimen that does not meet 
the aforementioned adequacy criteria.

CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -[ADDRESS_267255]  AND STUDY DISCON TINUATION  
A clear distinction will be made between subjects who withdraw from study drug dosing and those 
who withdraw from the study. All subjects who withdraw from study drug dosing should be 
encouraged to follow all study procedures to the LFU visit fo r safety assessment, even if they 
withdraw from dosing in absence of a clinical outcome  of failure.  
The clinical report will include the reason(s) for subject withdrawal from either study drug or the 
study , as well as details relevant to the withdrawal. I f a subject is withdrawn from the study  prior 
to study completion, the subject will undergo early termination procedures (See Section  12.3.3 ). 
Any subject withdrawn due to an adverse event (whether serious or non -serious) or clinically 
significant abnormal laboratory test value will be evaluated by [CONTACT_29517] a monitoring  
physician and will be treated and/or followed up until the symptoms or values return to normal or

be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whet her or 
not related to the investigational medicinal product. All adverse events, including observed or 
volunteered problems, complaints, or symptoms, are to be recorded and entered on the appropriate 
eCRF. Adverse events will be coded using the most update d version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities available (version 15.0 or higher).  
Adverse events, which include clinically significant laboratory test variables, will be monitored 
and documented from the time of informed consent until study  participation is complete . 
Treatment -emergent adverse events, which include clinical ly significant  laboratory test variables, 
will be monitored and documented from the first dose of study drug until study participation is 
complete. Subjects should be inst ructed to report any adverse event that they experience to the 
Investigator. Investigators should make assessment s for adverse events and record the event on the 
appropriate adverse event eCRF.  
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than individual associated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by [CONTACT_76768]. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a component of a specific disease or 
syndrome by [CONTACT_737], it should b e recorded as a separate adverse event on the eCRF.  
Additionally, the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, 
tooth extraction, transfusion) should be recorded as an adverse event, not the procedure.  The

Any medical condition alrea dy present at screening or baseline should not be reported as an 
adverse event , unless the medical condition or signs or symptoms present at baseline worsen  in 
severity or seriousness at any time during the study. In this case, it may be reported as an adv erse 
event  at the discretion of the Investigator . 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination (e.g., ECG) findings detected

The reference safety information will be reviewed yearly and the periodicity of the review will be 
harmonized with the reporting period of the Development Safety Update Report.  
14.4 Assessment and Reporting of Adverse Events b y the Investigator  
The Investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to study drug treatment (not 
related, unlikely, possible, or probable). Each sign or symptom reported will be graded on the 
NCI-CTCAE  V4.0  toxicity grading 5 -point sever ity scale (Grade 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5), detail s of which 
can be found in Appendix 3 . The date and time of onset, duration, and outcome 
(Recovered/Resolved, Recovering/Resolving, Resolved with Sequelae, Not recovered/Resolved, 
Fatal, or Unknown/Lost to follow -up) of each event will be noted.  
Adverse events, including those not listed on the NCI -CTCAE grading system, will be graded on 
the 5 -point scale (mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening, death) and reported in detail as indicated 
on the eCRF according to  the following definitions for rating severity:  
• Grade 1  - Mild: asymptomatic or mild symptoms OR clinical or diagnostic observations only 
OR intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2  - Moderate: minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated OR limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (e.g., preparing meals, 
shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, managing money, etc.).

Causality Assessment  
The relationship of each adverse event will be assessed using the followi ng definitions:  
Not related  • Event occurring before dosing.  
• Event or intercurrent illness due wholly to factors other than drug 
treatment.  
Unlikely  • Poor temporal relationship with drug treatment.  
• Event easily explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other factors.  
Possible  • Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment.  
• Event could be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or other 
factors.  
Probable  • Reasonable temporal relationship with drug treatment.  
• Likely to be known reaction to agent or chemical group, or 
predicted by [CONTACT_25046].  
• Event cannot easily be explained by [CONTACT_1130]’s clinical state or 
other factors.  
The following factors should also be considered:  
• The temporal sequence from study drug administration – 
The event should occu r after the study drug is given. The length of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical context of the event.  
• Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases – 
Each report should be evaluated in the context of the natural hi story and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the subject may have.  
• Concomitant drug – 
The other drugs the subject is taking or the treatment the subject receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them might be recognized to cause the event in question.  
• Known response pattern for this class of study drug – 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particular response is likely to be a 
class effect.  
• Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses – 
The exposure to st ress might induce adverse changes in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_23567] a logical and 
better explanation for the event.

14.5 Serious Adverse Event s 
An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator 
or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening adverse event;  
• NOTE: An adverse event or adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in view of 
either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form,  might have 
caused death.  
• Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_97889];  
NOTE: Any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186220] 1 overnight stay will be considered an inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. An emergency room visit without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222282], nor will hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a procedure scheduled or planned 
before signing of informed consent. However, unexpected complications and/or prolongation 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222283].  As the subjects in this study will already be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], it is likely 
that unexpected complications and/or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222284].  
• Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_186223] (i.e., no place to stay, live too far 
away to come for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6042]) will NOT be considered inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] ;  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substant ial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions;  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• An important medical event.  
NOTE: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_222285], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], or the development of drug dependency.

15.1 Efficacy Assessments  
Efficacy Assessments for cUTI  or AP  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for cUTI or AP is defined differently by [CONTACT_222341]. The primary 
endpoint f or the EMA is proportion of subjects in the mCRE -MITT  Population that 
demonstrate microbiological eradication (See  Table 9). The primary endpoint for the FDA is 
the proportion of subjects in the mCRE -MITT Population who demonstrate a response of 
overall success at the TOC visit  (See Table 9).  
To meet the primary endpoint for EMA and FDA, a subject’s  gram -negative antimicrobial 
therapy to treat the baseline infection cannot be  altered (other than dose adjustm ent or 
modification of BAT  based on susceptibility of baseline pathogen within the first [ADDRESS_267267] dose of study drug) after randomization due to concerns of microbiological failure, 
clinical failure, or tolerability AND must meet  the criteria in Table 9.

The primary endpoint for HABP and VABP is t he all -cause mortality rate in the mCRE -MITT 
Population at Day [ADDRESS_267269] s with  
bacteremia (not related to cUTI/AP or HABP/VABP ). 
Secondary Endpoints  
• The all -cause mortality rate in the mCRE -MITT and m -MITT Populations at Day 28 ; 
• The proportion of subjects in the mCRE -MITT Population who demonstrate a clinical 
outcome  of cure at the TOC visit.  
A clinical outcome of cure is defined as : 
o A subject whose gram -negative antimicrobial therapy to treat the baseline infection is 
not altered  (other than dose adjustment or modification of BAT  based on susceptibility 
of baseline pathogen within the first [ADDRESS_267270] dose of study drug) after

Efficacy Assessments for Bacteremia  
Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for bacter emia is t he all -cause mortality rate in the mCRE -MITT 
Population at Day [ADDRESS_267271] s with  
bacteremia (not related to cUTI/AP or HABP/VABP ). 
Secondary Endpoints  
• The all -cause mortality rate in the mCRE -MITT and m -MITT Populations at Day 28;  
• The proportion of subjects in the mCRE -MITT Population who demonstrate a response of 
overall success at the TOC visit.  
For subjects whose gram -negative antimicrobial therapy to treat the baseline infection is 
not altered (other than dose adjustment or modification of BAT  based on susceptibility of 
baseline pathogen within the first [ADDRESS_267272] dose of study drug) after 
randomization due to concerns of microbiological failure, clinical failure, or tolerability , a 
response of success is defined by [CONTACT_222342] (microbiological eradication) 
and a clinical assessment of cure.   
Clearance of bacteremia (microbiological eradication) is defined as the demonstration that 
bacterial pathogen(s) found at baseline is absent with repeat culture . 
Clinical cure is defi ned as complete resolution or significant improvement of the baseline 
signs and symptoms of bacteremia, such that no further surgical intervention or

15.1.2  Clinical Outcome  
Clinical outcome will be used to determine a response of success for subjects with  cIAI, HABP , 
or VABP . Clinical outcome , as a component of an assessment of overall response , will also be 
used to determine a response of success for subjects with cU TI or AP  (FDA only) , or bacteremia.  
The Investigator will be provided with a choice of clinical outcome s based on definitions to make 
a clinical assessment of the subject  at the Day 3,  Day 7,  EOT,  TOC,  and LFU  visits. The 
Investigator will assign a clinical outcome  as defined in Table 10. 
If all symptoms present at baseline are classified as mostly resolved or continuing (decreased), 
with no new o nset symptoms, such that no further surgical intervention or antimicrobial therapy  is 
warranted, the subject will have a clinical outcome  of cure at Day 7, EOT, TOC, and LFU visits. 
Subjects with lessening, incomplete resolution, or no worsening of these s ymptoms (i.e., 
continuing [decreased or no change] and resolved), who still warrant antimicrobial therapy, will

or the development of new onset symptoms  sufficie nt to require unplanned surgical 
procedures/percutaneous drainage or initiation of non -study antimicrobials,  in addition to the 
criteria in Table [ADDRESS_267274] of care to evaluate clinical outcome.  
Table 10. Criteria  for Clinical Outcome  
Category  Criteria  
Cure  Complete resolution or significant improvement of the baseline signs and symptoms, 
such that no further surgical intervention or antim icrobial therapy is warranted.  This 
outcome category will only be used at Day 7, EOT, TOC, and LFU visits.  
Improvement  Lessening, incomplete resolution, or no worsening of baseline clinical signs and 
symptoms, but continued therapy is warranted. This outcome category will only be 
used at Day 3  and Day 7  visits.  
Failure  Subjects  who experience any one of the following:  
• At any study visit, worsening of baseline clinical signs and symptoms or the 
development of new clinical signs and symptoms of infection, sufficient to stop 
study medication and i nitiate non -study antimicrobial  or require unplanned 
surgical procedures or per cutaneous drainage ; 
• Surgical site wound infection ; 
• At TOC and LFU visits, persistence, incomplete resolution of baseline clinical 
signs and symptoms of infection;   
• Withdrawal from the study due to an adverse event or due to lack of clinical 
improvement; or  
• Death of the subject  during the study.  
Indeterminate  Clinical outcome cannot be determined . 
EOT = End of Treatment; LFU = Late Follow -up; TOC  = Test of Cure.  
15.1.3  Microbiologic Outcome  
The microbiologic outcome  will be used , as a component of an assessment of overall response , to 
determine a response of success for subjects with cUTI or AP  (FDA only) , or bacteremia.  The 
microbiologic outcome  will be used to determine a response of success for subjects with cUTI or 
AP for the  EMA. The criteria for microbiological outcome  for subjects with cUTI or AP  are 
defined in Table 11.

Category  Criteria  
Eradication  • Eradication  is the demonstration that the bacterial pathogen(s) fo und at baseline 
is reduced to < 104 CFU/mL on urine culture  for FDA or <103 CFU/mL for EMA  
• AND a negative blood culture (after  positive blood culture  at baseline ). 
Persistence  • Persistence  is the demonstration at EOT that 1 or more of the bacterial 
pathogen (s) found at baseline remains 104 CFU/mL o f urine culture  for FDA or 
103 CFU/mL for EMA , 
• OR a positive blood culture.  
Recurrence  • Recurrence is the isolation of the same baseline bacterial pathogen(s) from 
culture after a response of eradication ,  
• OR a positive blood culture with the same baseline organism that was identified 
as a uropathogen after a response of eradicatio n. 
Indeterminate  • An indeterminate outcome will occur if there is no culture or the culture cannot 
be interpreted for any reason.  
AP = acute pyelonephritis; CFU = colony -forming unit ; cUTI =  complicated urinary tract infection;  
EMA  = European Medicines Agency; EOT = End of Treatment; FDA =  Food and Drug Administration . 
 
The criteria for microbiological outcome  for subjects with bacteremia are presented in Table  12. 
Table  12. Criteria for Microbiologic Outcome for Bacteremia  
Category  Criteria  
Eradication  • Eradication is the demonstration  that the bacterial pathogen(s) found at baseline 
is absent with repeat blood culture.  
Persistence  • Persistence is the demonstration  at EOT  that the bacterial pathogen(s) found at 
baseline is present with repeat blood culture.  
Recurrence  • Recurrence is the isolation of the same baseline bacterial pathogen(s) from blood 
culture after a response of eradication .  
Indeterminate  • An indeterminate outcome will occur if there is no blood culture or the  blood 
culture  cannot be interpreted for any reason.  
EOT = End of Treatment . 
15.1.4  Overall Response  
Overall response  will be used to determine a response of success for subjects with cUTI or AP  
(FDA only) , or bacteremia. This efficacy measure is derived from a composite of the clinical 
outcome  and the microbiological outcome .  
The algorithm for overall response  at the TOC visit is summarized in Table 13.

DETERMINE THE SAFETY  AND PHARMACOKINETIC S OF 
CARBAVANCE IN SUBJEC TS WITH RENAL  INSUFFICIENCY 
(INCLUDING SUBJECTS ON STANDARD HEMODIAL YSIS)  
Study 504 was an open -label study in adult subjects with varying degrees of renal insufficiency, 
including those requiring hemodialysis (HD). The safety and PK of a single IV dose of 1 g 
meropenem plus 1 g RPX7009, infused over 3 hours, was evaluated. Forty -one subjects were 
enrolled in 5 groups based on their degree of renal insufficiency. The five cohorts included: 
subjects with normal renal function (CrCl >90 ml/min), mild renal impairment (CrCl 
60-89 ml/min), moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 -<60 ml/min), severe renal impairment (CrCl 
<30 ml/min, and subjects with end stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. Patients on renal 
replacement therapy other t han standard hemodialysis (including continuous veno -venous 
hemofiltration, continuous veno -venous hemodialysis and continuous renal replacement therapy) 
were not studied.   
Figure 1 shows the relation between estimated GFR  (eGFR)  and meropenem or RPX7009 plasma 
clearance. The plasma clearance of both drugs remained similar throughout the range of renal 
function as evidenced by [CONTACT_222351].  
The removal of meropenem and RPX7009 during hemodialysis was studied in 9 patients with 
severe renal insufficiency on chronic hemodialysis. Patients received a single meropenem 1 g/ 
RPX7009 1 g dose, followed by a hemodialysis session. Both meropenem and RPX7009 were 
removed from plasma by [CONTACT_222352]. These data indicate that maintenance doses of each drug 
(adjusted for degree of underlying endogenous renal function) should be administered after a 
dialysis session.

24 APR 2015, Version 3.0  Page  112 of 116 Determination of Carbavance (meropenem/RX7009) Dosage in Renal Impairment  
Dosage adjustment according to degree of renal impairment was determined by [CONTACT_222353]’s pharmacokin etics and exposures determined by [CONTACT_222354]7009. The objective was to maintain exposures 
(as AUC) across the range of renal function to be as consistent as possible across the spectrum of 
renal functi on. In view of PK -PD analyses in nonclinical models that show AUC is linked to 
efficacy for RPX7009, AUC was the appropriate controller of efficacy for this agent. Since T>MIC  
is the PK -PD index important for  meropenem, different dosing intervals were eval uated to insure 
T>MIC breakpoint was above threshold values (T>MIC >40%) for efficacy. For purposes of this 
analysis, the forecasted susceptibility breakpoint for meropenem based on the 2 gram dose and 
3 hr infusion was 8 ug/ml.   For purposes of this analys is, the forecasted susceptibility breakpoint 
for meropenem based on the 2 gram dose and 3  hr infusion was 8 ug/ml.   This breakpoint was 
determined by [CONTACT_222355] a a 
minimum concentration of 8 mg /L of RPX7009 (in combination with 8  mg/L of meropenem) was 
required to be present for  24 hours to prevent resistance . Free drug was considered for both 
meropenem and RPX7009 (plasma protein binding of 6% and 33%, respectively). Free drug was 
considered fo r both meropenem and RPX7009 (plasma protein binding of 6% and 33%, 
respectively).

Table 1  shows meropenem  Time  > MIC  (T> MIC) measured  in each patient and PK -PD indices 
for three potential dosage regimens in each subject according to measured m eropenem PK in each 
subject. Meropenem dosage regimens were identified for each of the strata of renal function that 
would meet or achieve target exposures (T>MIC of at least 40%  of the dosing interval ) in all 
subjects (see shaded cells).

CONFID ENTIAL  Clinical Study Protocol: REMPEX -[ADDRESS_267299]. Since AUC is the target PK 
metric and RPX7009 clearance remained close to meropenem clearance, unit and 24 h r doses 
remained at a 1:1 ratio throughout the range of renal function.  
Considerations for subjects with creatinine clearance < 10 ml/min  
As noted in the Figure 1 , as creatinine clearance falls below 10 ml/min, meropenem non -renal 
clearance assumes a grea ter proportion of total clearance. In contrast, RPX7009 has no 
measureable non -renal clearance. Thus, to maintain a 1:1 dose ratio and, more importantly 
provide therapeutic exposures of each component and to avoid accumulation of RPX7009, 
patients with a c reatinine clearance <10 ml/min should receive hemodialysis at least every 3 days 
(i.e., at least twice weekly).

Title of study : The effectiveness of Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520608] -on therapy using a Real -world cohort of 
patients with Asthma
Rationale and 
background:While asthma imposes a substantial burden on the healthcare system, the cost 
of uncontrolled asthma is more than double that for controlled asthma 
patients. Asthma therapy involves a stepwise approach depending on control 
and severity levels. To better guide treatment decision making, it is imperative 
to understand the impact of diffe rent treatment choices on health outcomes in 
a real -world setting for patients taking ICS/LABA combinations .
Research question 
and objectives:To evaluate the effectiveness of add on therapy with Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611] ® 
compared to increasing the dose of ICS in patients with a diagnosis of Asthma 
and on ICS/LABA therapy.
Study design: Retrospective cohort data analysis of patients with asthma prescribed w ith 
ICS/LABA therapy. Patients will be followed after the date of first 
ICS/LABA prescription and those prescribed Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611] ® will be 
classified under the ‘Tio’ group w hile the rest will be under the ‘NonTio’ 
group. Outcomes will be compared betw een these tw o groups.
Population: Asthmatics 6 years and above and on ICS/LABA at baseline
Variables: Baseline measures will include patient demographics, medications, control 
status, comorbidities, resource use, eosinophil levels (if available), ACT score 
(if available).
Data sources: IMS Pharmetrics (IMS or Database I);
EMRClaims+ (Database II)
Study size: >6,300 (expected)
Data analysis: Propensity Score Matching will be conducted using baseline characteristics in 
order to ensure as much similarity between the two groups. Time to fi rst 
exacerbation (primary outcome) w ill be compared betw een the two groups 
descriptively, as well as using Cox PH modelling techniques. Secondary 
outcomes will include rate of exacerbation, proportion of patients with 
exacerbation, health care resource use and cost during follow -up,

While asthma imposes a substantial burden on the healthcare sy stem, the cost of uncontrolled 
asthma is more than double that for controlled 
asthma patients (ACAAI). The European 
National Health and Wellness Survey  (P19-[ZIP_CODE] )and the Real-world Evaluation of Asthma 
Control and Treatment (US) (R16-0701) survey  both found that 55% of asthma patients were 
uncontrolled, even among those who are treated. Asthma therapy  involves a stepwise 
approach depending on control and severit y levels. Uncontrolled asthma, which may present 
regardless of severit y level, results in exacerbations, use of systemic corticosteroids, and 
declined lung function (P14-[ZIP_CODE]). When asthma is not controlled, guidelines recommend 
increased ICS dose, and use of ICS in combination with long-acting β2-agonists (LABA), 
and/or other add-on therapy , including leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), antibody  
biologics or oral corticost eroids.  The ERS/ATS guidelines (P14-[ZIP_CODE]) define severe asthma 
as that which remains uncontrolled despi[INVESTIGATOR_520612]. Uncontrolled asthma is associated with an increased 
risk of exacerbation, which results in impaired lung function, reduced patient quality  of life 
and increased health care resource use. To better guide treatment decision making, it is 
imperative to understand the impact of different treatme nt choices on health outcomes in a 
real-world setting for patients taking ICS/LABA combinations.
The intended audience will be health sy stems, payers and prescribers. The results of the study  
will be used to provide evidence of the effectiveness of tiotro pi[INVESTIGATOR_520613]- on therap y in 
reducing exacerbations, reducing the increased dosing of current medications and health care 
resource utilization for their asthma patients. 
In September 2015, the FDA approved Spi[INVESTIGATOR_520614] -
term, once -daily , maintenance treatment of asthma in patients 12 y ears of age and older (6 
years and above approved in Feb 2017).

9.1
STUDY DESIGN
Data extraction from both databases (I and II, see section 9.4) will be conducted by 
.  All patients will be required to have a prescription for ICS/LABA therap y [e.g. 
Advair (Diskus and HFA), Airduo, Breo, Dulera, or Symbicort ].The date of the first 
prescription of ICS/LABA within the study  period (Jan 1st2016 to Nov 30th2018) willbe 
defined as ICS/LABA -initiation (ICS/L ABAi) date. This baseline cohort will then be 
followed to identify  two cohorts (two arms of the study ). One cohort that receives a 
prescription for Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611]®  1.25 mcg (on top of baseline ICS/L ABA) will be 
classified as the ‘Tio’ group ,and the second cohort that receives a “step -up” from baseline 
low-dose ICS/LABA to medium/high dose ICS/LABA or from baseline medium dose 
ICS/LABA to high dose ICS/LABA or an additional prescription/refill ofhigh-dose-
ICS/LABA following the first prescription of baseline high dose ICS/LABA within the 
study  period, will be classified as the ‘NonTio’ group . The date of the first prescription for 
Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611]®  
1.25 mcg in the ‘Tio’ group will be defined as the index date for 
the ‘Tio’ group. Similarly  the date of the first prescription fora “step -up” from baseline 
low-dose ICS/LABA to medium/high dose ICS/LABA or from baseline medium dose 
ICS/LABA to high dose ICS/LABA or an additional prescription/refill ofhigh-dose-
ICS/LABA following the first prescription of baseline high dose ICS/LABA (evidenced by 
[CONTACT_2669] 90-days of prescription utilization) within the study  period will bedefined as the 
index date for the ‘NonTio’ group.
Patients will be required to have a m inimum follow -up period of 30 day s after the index 
date for the anal yses of the primary  endpoint with no limit onthe maximum period  (this 
30-day minimum follow -up period requirement will be waived in a sensitivity  analy sis). 
Subject to sample size requir ements, patients will be required to have available records for 
at least 12 months prior to the index date to ensure no prior use of Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611]®  
and to establish baseline patient characteristics .  This 12 -month period prior to the index 
date wil l be defined as the pre -index period .

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_675313] -01(4.0)9.4 DATA SOURCES
Two separate 
databases will be appended to create the anal ytic dataset to obtain sufficient 
power for the primary  endpoint analy sis.  This approach will provide both comprehensive 
geographic representation from national claims, and important asthma clinical measures 
available through electronic medical records (EMR).  Both databases have been widel y 
published in the academic asthma literature. 
As a general note, this study  protocol attempts to anticipate availabilit y of detailed data 
elements of the two real -world dat a sets listed below.  Consistent with accepted research 
standards using retrospective administrative data, evaluation of missing data and study  
variables is often required to ultimately  finalize the study  protocol as it relates to inclusion 
of covariates a s well as secondary  outcome measures.  
IMS Pharmetrics (IMS or Database I)
We will establish 
Database [ADDRESS_675314] patient 
follow -up period for tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 1.25 mcg dose patients starting January  2016.  This 
database contains administrative insurance data and enrolment information derived from 
approximately  150 million commerciall y insured and Medicare lives. This longitudinal 
database a llows documentation and anal ysis of the patient journey  from diagnosis to 
intervention and follow -up. It is nationall y representative covering 90% of US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_520617] (Health Insurance Portability  and Accountability  Act) 
regula tions.
EMRClaims+ (Database II)
We will establish database II using EMRClaims+®, which will offer lung function results, 
Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, as well as eosinophil counts for asthma patients in 
addition to administrative data. EMRClaims+® is an integrated health services database 
containing more than 20 mi llion EMR across seven states in the Midwestern region of the 
[LOCATION_002].   The database includes administrative insurance claims of approximately  
690,000 lives linked to an overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_520618], including 
laboratory  values, and provider billing files.  
The above two 
databases will be combined for the anal ysis of endpoints common to both 
databases. 
9.5 STUDY SIZE
The expected number of asthma patients aged 12 y ears and above, without concurrent 
COPD, and continuous enrollment for 12 months prior to the Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611]®  date 
is estimated to be approximately  2,100 to be matched to double (4200 patients) the num ber 
of NonTio patients resulting in a total N =6,300.   Power calculation was conducted for the 
primary  endpoint, time -to-first exacerbation by  [CONTACT_1008] -up time. The 
calculation was based on detecting a significant treatment effect using Cox p roportional 
hazard model. Estimates were obtained from the MEZZO trial comparing tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_1890] 2.5 
μg vs. salmeterol ( P15-[ZIP_CODE] ). Assuming 6.4% of patients in the control group followed

study ) and assuming a constant hazard rate, equating to an exponential rate parameter of 
0.012 per month for the control group and 0.0096 per month for the Tio group, the power 
is calculated to be 77%. Using the P
rimo study , assuming 26.9% of patients in the control 
group followed up for [ADDRESS_675317] an exacerbation (based on the Tio R 5 group in 
the 48- week stud y Primo) and assuming a constant hazard rate, equates to an exponential 
rate parameter of 0.028 p er month in the control group and 0.0224 per month in the Tio 
group, the power is 98%.  The Mezzo- derrived power calculation likely  underestimates the 
power since our study  design includes sicker patients that required a step
-up in I CS 
treatment (not requi red in the Mezzo Study ). While we expect that the actual power will lie 
between the two estimates (assuming that the patient population is similar to the less severe 
Primo patients and the more severe MEZZO patients), the estimated power is greater than 
77%.
9.6 DATA MANAGEMENT
All established securit y and confidentiality procedures will be obs erved b y BIand/or 
 
 personnel who are assigned appropriate access to the data. Enrolment data, medical 
claims, and prescription claims will be accessed from t his administrative claims dataset. The 
analyses will be performed on limited data sets that are void of member protected health 
information and all results were shared in aggregate form onl y.
9.[ADDRESS_675318] exacerbation per patient and compare it between the two groups (Tio vs. 
NonTio).  For secondary  endpoint anal yses we will compare the rate of exacerbation, 
proportion of patients with exacerbations after 6 months and one year (based on Kaplan 
Meier estimates), HCRU and average cost during follow -up and compare them between the 
two groups (Tio vs. NonTio).  
The primary  outcome of the study  will be analy zed using Cox proportional hazard 
modelling. The secondary outcome of rate of exacerbation per patient will be anal yzed 
using negative binomial regression. This technique works on the assumption that the rate 
of exacerbation varies among every  subject in the study  (P16- [ZIP_CODE] ). Also this model 
accounts for overdispersion of data which is likel y to happen due to variability  between the 
patients. Balance in covariates will be checked after matching. If PSM was able to balance 
all observed baseline characteristics, the regression models for outcomes  will be limited to 
the databases (IMS and EMR) and to the key  independent variable of interest (namel y Tio 
use vs. I CS/LABA dose
increase) and model overfitting is not, therefore, of concern.  
However, if there are unbalanced baseline characteristics, we will include these 
characteristics in the regression as covariates.  For regression model covariate selection we

Protocol for non -interventional studies based on existing data
BI Study Number 0205-0543 c28659325 -01
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_675319] -01(4.0)will also estimate the multicollinearity  of covariates by  [CONTACT_520622]. For example, if comorbidities from the specific list are also 
included in CCI , they  will only  be included in the CCI .  
In order to handl emissing 
data, in the PSM we will create a category  variable (‘missing 
data”) for each covariate to ensure that patients with that variable and without that variable 
are respectivel y matched. Patients with missing prescription data required for classification 
of the treatment groups will be excluded.  Patients with missing lung function scores and 
ACT scores at baseline and in the follow up period will be excluded from these respective 
secondary  anal yses. 
9.[ADDRESS_675320] commercial health insurance may  be different from those 
with non- commercial or without (commercial) health insurance. Database I 
underrepresent sthe population aged [ADDRESS_675321] scores, therefore, the 
sample size for related secondary  endpoints or sub -group anal yses may  produce results for 
these anal yses that are not gener
alizable.  While duplication anal yses will make double 
counting the same patient across both datasets negilible, it should be noted that the same 
patient may  be present in both cohorts.

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_675322] -01(4.0)Including patients with persistent use of high -dose ICS/LABA (as oppo sed to an increase in 
ICS/LABA dose) in the NonTio group, may  complicate the interpretation of the results, as 
patients with a deterioration in their asthma necessitating an increase in asthma medication 
(Tio group) will be matched to patients continuing on the same medication (high -dose 
ICS/LABA) .
No claims regarding the effectiveness of Tio should be made on the basis of this study . 
This real -world evidence study  lacks controls available with randomized co
ntrolled trials. 
Patient misclassification, missing data, objective and reliable  measurement of patient 
outcomes, and lack of detailed information regarding subjects’ cinical history  or clinical 
status during the stud y timeframe may undermine the accuracy of our study  results. 
9.10 OTHER ASPECTS
The IMS® PharMetrics Plus database is comprised of adjudicated claims for more than 
150 million unique enrollees across the US. Enrollees with both medical and pharmacy  
coverage in 2012 represented 40 million active lives. Patients in the majority of three -digit 
zip codes and in every  metropolitan statistical area of the US are represented, with 
coverage of data from 90% of US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], 80% of all US doctors, and representation 
from 85% of the Fortune [ADDRESS_675323] external validity  
in the case of Medicare, Medicare Advantage or Medicaid patients. 
EMRClaims+®, will offer lung function results, Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, as 
well as eosinophil counts for asthma patients in addition to administrative data. 
EMRClaims+® is an integrated hea lth services database containing more than 20 million 
EMR across 7 states in the Midwestern region of the [LOCATION_002].   The database includes 
administrative insurance claims across approximately 690,000 lives linked to an 
overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_520619], including laboratory  values, and 
provider billing files.  This data source uniquel y provides a strong -level of internal validity  
since two separate sources (EMR and administrative data) cross reference unique patient 
identifiers.  In the event of discrepancies between administrative files and EMR data (or for 
uncertaint y about disease classification), manual evaluation of the individual patients' 
medical records is conducted to provide resolution based on access to the complete patient 
medical history  in the EMR.   
The database sdo not have the capability  to uniquely  identify  members who disenroll and 
re-enroll; consequentl y, these individuals are assigned a new identifier and may be 
represented in the data as two unique subjects. It is also possible that a patient may  be in 
both cohorts.  Both possibilities will be checked using zip codes.  If two patients are 
suspected of being the same, only  the data with the longer follow- up period will be used.

Channeling Bias Mitigation
Introduction of channeling bias in this study  is highly  likely  using retrospective claims data 
based on asthma medication use; patients between the two cohorts may differ in baseline 
control and severity  levels. On aggregate, patients for whom Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611]®  1.25 
mcg was added (vs NonTio) are likely to be less well-controlled and more severe both at 
baseline and  and during the follow upperiod.  Absent a method to control for this 
channeling bias, it is likely  that placing sicker patients in the Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_520611]®  
1.25mcg group will confound an accurate comparison of cost, resource use, and other 
outcomes between the groups. Two design features of our study  will help mitigate this 
bias.  First,  our comparison (NonTio) group will be required to step- up their baseline 
ICS/LABA dose or have an  additional prescription/refill ofhigh-dose-ICS/L ABA 
following the first prescription of baseline high dose ICS/L ABA within the study  period . 
Second, we will use Propensity  Score Matching (PSM) to match patients on key measures 
of disease control and severit y as listed in Table 1, such as demographics, Charlson 
Comorbidity  Index (CCI) score, specific comorbidities, number of prescriptions (overall 
and asthma -related medications). This baseline matching strategy  will be particularl y 
important to ensure that patients in the TIO group who have a corresponding increase in 
their ICS dose at or prior to the date of their TIO prescription (for example, if the patient 
has an exacerbation), will be matched to a corresponding NonTIO patient in terms of 
increased ICS dose or additional ICS prescription. It should be noted that after the 
prescription index date for both Tio and NonTio patients, we anticipate changes in ICS 
medication for patients in both cohorts.  These ICS medication changes reflect patient

up period, where patients who encounter exacerbation in either 
group are likely  to see a change in the ICS dose.   
 
  As a result, post-index period ICS medication 
changes will not alter the classification of patient groups nor will it be the basis for 
exclusion of these patients.     
We will conduct 1:[ADDRESS_675328] neighbour matching approach with a radius of 
0.2*SD(log(P)). This will be conducted in both databases (IMS: Cohort I and EMRClaims+: 
Cohort II) separatel y.

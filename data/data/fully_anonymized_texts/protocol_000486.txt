rationale  for this study  is to determine  whether  telemonitoring  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_77535].
Part  1: Demonstrate  the reliability  of remote  pulmonary  function  testing,  performed  via telemedicine,  
for monitoring  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77536]  (ALS)
Primary  Hypothesis:  There  is no difference  in the results  of PFT and rPFT  for respi[INVESTIGATOR_77537].
Secondary  Hypothesis:   The respi[INVESTIGATOR_77538],  patient,  and caregiver  will express  confidence  in 
conducting  the rPFT,  as determined  by [CONTACT_77619].
Part  2: Weekly  remote  pulmonary  function  testing  (rPFT)  and nurse  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77539]  
(NRHC)  in ALS telemedicine
This part randomizes  subjects  into two arms  – both  perform  weekly  rPFT  testing  and one receives  
monthly  NRHC.
Aim 1: Clinically-meaningful  benefit  of weekly  rPFT
Primary  Hypothesis:  Home  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77540]-invasive  ventilation  (NIV)  
recommendation  to be met on average  [ADDRESS_84562]  3-month  interval.
Secondary  Hypothesis:  Determine  the factors  associated  with  adherence  to weekly  rPFT  procedures.
Aim 2: The impact  of NRHC  on patient  outcomes
Primary  Hypothesis:  Patient  and caregiver  teams  in the NRHC  arm report  higher  self-efﬁcacy  in the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_77541] 6 months  compared  to those  in the non-NRHC  arm.
Secondary  Hypotheses:  Patients  in the NRHC  arm report  higher  self-efﬁcacy  at 12 months,  experience  
less decline  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]-related  quality  of life and fewer  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77542]-NRHC  arm.
1.2 Primary  Study  Endpoints
Part 1:  The primary  endpoint  is completion  of a standard  PFT and an experimental  rPFT  during  a single  
clinic  appointment.   At the endpoint,  study  outcomes  will include:
1)The best  forced  vital  capacity  (FVC)  and maximal  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_77543]  (MIP)  results  from  that visit’s  
PFT
2)The best  FVC and MIP results  from  that visit’s  rPFT
3)Survey  responses  from  study  participants.
Part 2: The primary  endpoint  for Aim [ADDRESS_84563]  in-person  or telehealth  clinic  
appointments.   The primary  endpoint  for Aim 2 will be the change  in self-efficacy  scores  from  baseline.   
Changes  will be compared  across  arms.
1.3 Secondary  Study  Endpoints
In Part 2: All participants  will undergo  a training  period  for rPFT  procedures,  which  entails  weekly  rPFT  
coaching  by a member  of the research  team  for the first four  weeks.   To proceed  with  the remainder  of 
the study,  the participant  team  must  demonstrate  the ability  to perform  and transmit  rPFT  results  to the 
research  team  during  the 4th rPFT  training  session,  and demonstrate  FVC test results  that are within  10%  
of the mean  values  achieved  during  the first three  training  sessions.   Training  sessions  will occur  at

2.0 Background  
2.1 Scientific  Background  and Gaps
Non-invasive  ventilation  (NIV)  lengthens  survival  and improves  QoL for patients  with  ALS.
According  to the Quality  Measurement  Set put forth  by [CONTACT_77620]  (AAN),  two 
parameters  of high  importance  in ALS care  are monitoring  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_77544] [Miller2013].    The practice  parameter  of the AAN  regarding  ALS care  states  that NIV is effective  in 
prolonging  survival  and slowing  the rate of respi[INVESTIGATOR_77545]  [Miller2009].   NIV has been  documented  
to have  a positive  effect  on QoL in the areas  of sleep  quality,  daytime  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008],  physical  fatigue,  and 
depression  [Butz2003].   NIV is recommended  when  a patient  presents  with  either  an FVC≤50%  predicted  
or a MIP > -60 cm H2O [Miller2009].   It is recommended  that PFTs  be done  at least  once  every  three  
months,  and that doctors  discuss  options  for NIV support  regularly.   
The multidisciplinary  clinical  model  may  not provide  optimal  management  for patients  with  rapi[INVESTIGATOR_77546].
Although  disease  course  varies  substantially,  some  patients  experience  rapid  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77545].   In 
prospective  study  of 38 newly  diagnosed  patients,  half presented  with  chronic  hypoventilation  after  one 
year,  necessitating  the introduction  of NIV [LoCoco2006].    The authors  suggest  that efforts  should  be 
made  to evaluate  pulmonary  function  in these  patients  at least  once  every  month.    Furthermore,  it has 
been  shown  that early  initiation  of NIV at an FVC threshold  of 65%  predicted  was associated  with  a 
significant  increase  in the median  time  from  ALS diagnosis  to death  [Lechtzin2007].   The current  practice  
of quarterly  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77547].
Telemedicine  has impacted  other  areas  of neurology,  but is understudied  for efficacy  in ALS.
The practice  of telemedicine  involves  the delivery  of medical  care  via long-distance  and electronic  
communication  between  a health  care  professional  and a patient  or another  health  care  professional.    
This type  of intervention  can expand  medical  coverage  into underserved  regions,  while  maintaining  the 
high  quality  of care.  Success  with  telemedicine  in other  areas  of neurology,  such  as in the treatment  of 
Parkinson's  disease  [Samii2006],  epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]  [Ahmed2008],  and stroke  [Demaerschalk2009],  provide  a 
framework  for achieving  positive  outcomes.
It is largely  unknown  whether  remotely-provided  multidisciplinary  care  results  in outcomes  for ALS 
patients  and their  caregivers  that are comparable  to those  achieved  with  traditional  care.   A review  by 
[CONTACT_77621]. identified  32 publications  addressing  telemedicine  in ALS [Hobson2016],  which  concluded  
that patients  are comfortable  using  the videoconferencing  interface  to discuss  most  concerns,  they  
appreciated  the reduced  travel  time  and costs,  and the use of telemedicine  extended  the period  for 
which  they  received  multidisciplinary  care.    Some  programs  offered  live interaction  with  providers  as a 
way to delivered  care  to individuals  in rural  areas  with  no alternative  treatment  options  [ALS-
Maine2010,  Bedlack2014].    Other  models  utilized  a traveling  nurse  to perform  the assessment  in the 
patient's  home,  which  is stored  and forwarded  to the appropriate  providers  at the multidisciplinary  
clinic  [Pulley2015,  McClellan2013].   Others  have  taken  on a more  passive  role,  with  monitoring  of 
oximetry  and non-invasive  ventilation  (NIV)  data  by a nurse  led to fewer  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56877],  and higher  
treatment  adherence  [Pi[INVESTIGATOR_1946]2010,  Vitacca2010,  Ashcroft2016].   
STUDY00006924
Approval: 6/12/2023
Page  5 of 23 (V.06/27/2016)  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_77548],  Hobson  concludes  “There  is limited  evidence  to recommend  the use of 
telemedicine  or telehealth  in the case  of patients  with  ALS.   Using  telehealth  as an alternative  to clinic  
visits  appears  technically  feasible  but further  research  needs  to establish  its safety  and effectiveness ” 
[Hobson2016].    To address  gaps  in telemedicine  care,  randomized  controlled  clinical  trials  must  be used  
to identify  methods  that can meet  or surpass  the standards  of in-person  assessment.
2.2 Previous  Data
Preliminary  work  by [CONTACT_77622] a pi[INVESTIGATOR_77549],  caregivers,  and 
multidisciplinary  ALS team  members,  although  less so by [CONTACT_77623]  (Figure  1, [Morris2016,  
Geronimo2017]).   Overall,  the three  rater  groups  were  concerned  that the lack of physical  contact  
[CONTACT_77624].   This led us to identify  and act upon  one area  of 
care  that could  be improved  in telemedicine  – assessment  of breathing  function.

From  January  to September  2018,  the procedures  for part [ADDRESS_84565]  assessments  (Figure  2).  In this sample,  the specificity  and sensitivity  of FVC measurements  
were  100%,  for MIP assessments  was 89%  and 82%,  respectively  [Geronimo2019].   The results  of part 1 
indicate  that rPFTs  are accurate  and acceptable  measures  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_77551].

4.4 Eligibility/screening  of subjects
Before  enrolling  prospective  participants,  we will contact  [CONTACT_77633],  email,  or in 
person.  For those  individuals  who  are Hershey  Medical  Center  patients,  we will ask for their  consent  to 
access  their  medical  record  to confirm  certain  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.    For potential  
participants  who  are not treated  at the Hershey  Medical  Center,  we will request  that they  release  
medical  records  to us from  their  doctor.   These  will be reviewed  by [CONTACT_77634]/exclusion  criteria.
We will confirm  that they  and their  caregiver  are aware  of the study  requirements  and are willing  to 
complete  the study  procedures  according  to the procedures  described  (see “Screening  questionnaire”  in 
recruitment  materials).   This form  addresses  the remaining  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  In it, we will 
ask the patient  if they  anticipate  any issues  relating  to performing  spi[INVESTIGATOR_77559]  (in the case  of Part 2).  They  will be directed  to an online  
internet  speed  test to ensure  sufficient  connection  speed.   We also ask if the caregiver  anticipates  they  
will be able  assist  in administering  the procedure.    If a caregiver  is not available,  a patient  may  be 
enrolled  in the study  if the investigator  judges  that they  have  the capacity  to perform  home  PFTs  
unassisted.  If at any point  in the study  a patient  enrolled  without  a caregiver  is no longer  able  to 
perform  the home  tests  without  additional  assistance,  a caregiver  must  be enrolled  to aid home  PFT 
administration,  or the patient  will be exited  from  the rPFT  portion  of the study.

7.0 Study  Design  and Procedures
7.1 Study  Design
Part 1: This is a self-controlled  study  where  each  participant  will be administered  a standard  of care  PFT 
for measurement  of FVC and MIP,  as well as an rPFT,  separated  by [CONTACT_77640],  for measurement  of 
STUDY00006924

Page  12 of 23 (V.06/27/2016)  experimental  FVC and MIP.    The rPFT  is guided  by a respi[INVESTIGATOR_77563],  utilizing  the 
telemedicine  interface  of the Hersey  ALS clinic  and devices  for measuring  FVC and MIP (Error!  Reference

Figure  3: Tools  for remote  pulmonary  testing.   Left:  Air Smart  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_77564].  Right:  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77565].
Part 2:  This is a two-arm,  randomized  study  to determine  1) whether  weekly  monitoring  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_77566] 2) whether  structured  nurse  coaching  leads  to 
improved  self-efficacy  for managing  disease  and better  maintenance  of respi[INVESTIGATOR_77551].   For enrollees  
in both  arms,  standard  FVC and MIP measurements  obtained  approximately  every  three  months  by [CONTACT_77641][INVESTIGATOR_77567]-administered  rPFTs  performed  
weekly.   To train  the participant  in the performance  of rPFTs,  a member  of the research  team  will be 
present  either  in person  or virtually  to guide  the patient  and caregiver  in the appropriate  use of the 
equipment  during  the first four  weeks  of the study.   Enrollees  in the NRHC  arm will additionally  receive  
monthly  coaching  with  the study  nurse  via telehealth.   Approximately  5% of NRHC  sessions  will include  
audio  recordings  that will be evaluated  by a second  clinician  nurse  for quality  and consistency.

The following  information  is paraphrased  from  the user  manual,  which  is included  in the “devices”  page  
of the protocol.
“The  Instrumentation  Industries,  Inc. Negative  Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_77582]  (NIF)  Meters  are devices  used  to 
measure  and monitor  patient  inspi[INVESTIGATOR_77583].  During  use the NIF Meter  is attached  to the patient  
airway  at a point  that provides  optimal  readings  of patient  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77583].”
During  each  guided  rPFT  administration,  a member  of the research  team  and/or  respi[INVESTIGATOR_77584].  The 
participants  prepare  the spi[INVESTIGATOR_77585].  The patient  is told to sit as upright  as possible  for the measurement  of FVC.  They  will be told 
that to do this they  will 1) inhale  maximally,  2) exhale  as hard  and fast as possible,  and 3) continue  to 
exhale  until  indicated  by [CONTACT_38802][INVESTIGATOR_541].  The researcher  will also demonstrate  this procedure  to the 
patient.  The caregiver  applies  nose  clips  to block  airﬂow  through  the nose,  holds  the turbine  of the 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_77586]’s  mouth  and performs  three  repetitions  of this sequence,  with  periods  of 
relaxation  between  testings.   Testing  is repeated  until  three  valid  maneuvers  are achieved.  The 
application  on the tablet  computes  the FVC and percentage  predicted  value,  the best  of which  is 
retained.
To perform  the MIP test,  the participant  inserts  the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_77587].  The patient  is 
told they  will be asked  to draw  breath  in as quickly  and powerfully  as possible,  for at least  one second.  
The researcher  tells the caregiver  to place  a ﬁnger  over  the valve  outlet  so that no air ﬂows  through  the 
mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_77588].  Nose  clips  will be used.  The patient  performs  three  repetitions  of this

Patients  may  be enrolled  without  a caregiver  available  if the investigator  determines  that the 
patient  is able  to perform  the home  breathing  tests  without  additional  assistance.   The patient’s  
ability  to perform  these  tests  solo will be reviewed  at a minimum  interval  of successive  clinic  
visits.   If they  are no longer  able  to perform  the home  tests  without  additional  assistance,   a 
caregiver  must  be enrolled  aid home  PFT administration,  or they  will be exited  from  the rPFT  
portion  of the study.   Caregivers  enrolled  part-way  into the study  will receive  training  on 
administering  rPFTs  at that time.
rPFT  arm: Subjects  will continue  to self-administer  rPFTs  every  week.   A research  team  member  
will schedule  rPFT  training  appointments  at weeks  8 and 12 order  to re-assess  aptitude.   rPFT  
procedures  are not performed  during  weeks  in which  a clinical  appointment  occurs.    Subjects

8.2 Sample  size determination
Our sample  size is predetermined  based  on our subjective  ability  to recruit  patients  within  the time  
frame  of the study.  Power  analysis  was based  on studies  of FVC decline.  Lo Coco  et al., [LoCoco2006],  
showed  that 50%  of study  participants  dropped  below  50%  predicted  FVC in one year.  Given  that our 
exclusion  criteria  for Part [ADDRESS_84581]  many  of the 37%  of individuals  in their  study  who  were  “slow  
progressors,”  we estimate  that 75%  of patients  enrolled  in our study  will meet  the respi[INVESTIGATOR_77600].  This results  in a sample  size per arm of n=15,  which  provides  80%  power  to detect  a 
difference  in mean  outcome  between  the two groups  if the effect  size is found  to be 0.95.   
Assuming  a monthly  change  in FVC of 3.5±3.4%  found  by [CONTACT_77646]. [Schiffman1993],  we 
conducted  10,000  Monte-Carlo  simulations  of 40 participants  declining  at this rate for 12 months.  Half 
were  sampled  once  every  three  months,  and half were  sampled  every  month.  80.6±6.3%  of simulated  
participants  met the requirements  for NIV recommendation,  in roughly  equal  proportions  across  groups.  
The average  FVC at recommendation  was 47.0%  predicted  in the experimental  group,  and 43.4%  
predicted  in the control  group.  The effect  size of the difference  in FVC between  groups  was .964±.343.  
8.3 Statistical  methods
Part 1:  The primary  hypothesis  is that there  is no difference  in the results  of PFT and rPFT  for respi[INVESTIGATOR_77601].   We will use a paired  sample  t-test  to determine  if the mean  test results  are 
comparable  between  the standard  and experimental  treatments.   We will conduct  a qualitative  analysis  
to determine  whether  the patient,  caregiver,  and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_77602].
Part 2: Aim [ADDRESS_84582].   For analysis  of Aim 2, a linear  mixed  effects  
model  will be used  to analyze  the change  from  baseline  between  study  groups  of self-efﬁcacy  scores  and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_77551]  [Verbeke2000].  The effect  size will be quantiﬁed  from  the model  using  the difference

20.1 Auditing  and Inspecting
The investigator  will permit  study-related  monitoring,  audits,  and inspections  by [CONTACT_77653](s),  IRB, the sponsor,  and government  regulatory  bodies,  of all study  related  
documents  (e.g.,  source  documents,  regulatory  documents,  data  collection  instruments,  study  data  
etc.).   The investigator  will ensure  the capability  for inspections  of applicable  study-related  facilities  
(e.g.,  pharmacy,  diagnostic  laboratory,  etc.).
The study  will be monitored  by [CONTACT_77654].  The monitors  will provide  an independent  review  of 
the regulatory  and subject  records  and the data  collected  to assure  compliance  with  the protocol,  GCP,  
and applicable  federal  regulations.  The monitoring  will occur  at regular  intervals  after  the enrollment  of 
the first subject  and the times  will be predetermined  by [CONTACT_77655].

1) Protocol Title  
 
Pre vs. postoperative adductor canal block for total knee arthroplasty: prospective randomized  
trial 
 
2) Objectives * 
 
The purpose of this project is to determine if a change in patient reported pain , nausea and vomiting 
after total knee arthroplasty can be observed with the substitution of post operative adductor canal 
block for a preoperative adductor canal  block  in the current established peri -operative pain 
protocol and if these changes lead to a decrease in opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556] (in morphine equivalents).  
 
3) Background * 
 
Levels of postoperative surgical pain are often high, particularly in orthopedic procedures such 
as total joint replacement [1, 2]. Increases in postoperative pain not only present discomfort to 
the patient, but can increase length of postoperative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_700655] [3]. Furthermore, increases in postoperative pain have previously been associated with 
increased use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_700656] [4].  
 
Due to these implications, there has been interest in exploring more effective options in pain 
management after total joint replacement including various types of multimodal pain 
management strategies. Currently, guidelines widely suggest that opi[INVESTIGATOR_700657] a larger focus on options such as multimodal pain management, though  the 
optimal multimodal protocol has yet to be established. [ 5-6] 
 
Adductor canal blocks have been demonstrated to be effective in reducing post -operative pain, 
reducing the amount of opi[INVESTIGATOR_700658] , thus reducing  the adverse effects related to 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] , as well as improving the recovery time required  [7-9]. 
 
Whether the adductor canal block must be performed preoperatively versus immediately 
postoperatively, however, has yet to be investigated. While preoperative blocks are effective in 
reducing the postoperative pain, by [CONTACT_700662], the analgesic benefits to the patient will potentially last longer into their 
postoperative recovery as the administration will be held until the end of the procedure.   
 
4) Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria*  
 
Inclusion criteria -  
1- Patients over the age of 18,  
2- Patients undergoing primary total knee replacement at the University of  Miami Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  
 Page 3 of 8 Revis ed: January [ADDRESS_951110].  
4- Patients on steroid preoperatively.  
5-Inability to provide medical consent.  
6- Patients with a history of significant unmitigated pain in parts of their body not including the 
knee the procedure is to be performed or a history of pain catastrophizing ( the tendency to 
magnify the threat value of the pain stimulus and to feel helpless in the context of pain, and by a 
relative inability to inhibit pain -related thoughts in anticipation of, during or following a painful 
event ) regarding pain anywhere in the body.  
7-Any condition that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would compromise the well -being of the 
patient or the study or prevent the patient from meeting or performing study requirements will 
exclude the participant.  
8-Allergy to local anesthetic  or any medication used in the standard protocol for joint 
replacement.  
  
 
5) Procedures Involved*  
 
Study design: All patients who fulfill inclusion criteria,  including undergoing a pregnancy test if a 
woman of childbearing age, undergoing total knee  arthroplasty will be randomized to one of two 
groups to be given the standard orthopaedic joint replacement protocol including general 
anesthesia with the preoperative adductor canal block or the standard orthopaedic joint 
replacement protocol including general anesthesia except the adductor canal block  will be given 
at the end of the procedure instead of the beginning . General a nesthesia for the groups will be 
standardized , and no intraoperative analgesics  given . Nerve blocks will be placed for both groups 
by [CONTACT_700663]. All nerve blocks will be placed following the same 
procedural protocol with the same supplies under ultrasound guidance to ensure consistency and 
minimize variation. Nerve blocks in both groups will include the standard 20mL Ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] 0.2%  
(local anesthetic)  injected in the same manner . PACU orders will not differ between the groups 
and will be the standard procedure for total joint arthroplasty at the facility. Cases will be assigned 
randomly in a 1:[ADDRESS_951111] orthopaedic joint replacement protocol at our institution includes  all of the 
following :    
1. Dexamethason e 10mg IV once postoperatively within [ADDRESS_951112] 1 -2 weeks postop  
5-Meloxicam  30mg IV once postoperatively within 24 hours  for pain and swelling  
 Page 4 of 8 Revis ed: January [ADDRESS_951113] 1 -2 weeks postop  
 
 
After surgery, patients will be evaluated for  the primary outcome of  pain status at time points 2 
hours  and 24 hours using the numeric rating pain scale ( 0-10). Patient’s nausea and vomiting will 
be evaluated by [CONTACT_2329] a binary “yes” or “no” for nausea and  recording the number of epi[INVESTIGATOR_112182]. T he Apfel score  will be used during statistical analysis to explore possible causes for 
differences in nausea and  vomiting  (0-4). Opi[INVESTIGATOR_700659] [ADDRESS_951114] ed via telephone for assessment using the 
numeric rating pain scale (1 -10) and post -op nausea and vomiting.  
 
 
6) Study Timelines*  
• Participants will be active in the study for the 24 hours after the index knee 
replacement surgery . 
• It will take about 6 months from the start of the study to recruit the total 
anticipated participants.  
• We will allot 1 month after the final participant has completed the study for 
analysis and write up.  
 
7) Study Design  
 
• The primary purpose of this project is in the treatment of pain around the immediate post -
operative time after total knee  replacement surgery. As a parallel experimental/ 
interventional study design, patients will be randomized to either the control group 
(institution specific joint replacement pain protocol) or the intervention group (receiving 
the postoperative adductor canal block ). Patients and those collecting the postoperative 
data will be blinded to eliminate bias  in a 1:1 randomization process match ing 
intervention group patients with control group patients . The surgeon will not be informed 

 Page 5 of 8 Revis ed: January [ADDRESS_951115] will be 
allowed to find out their group assignment when the study is over.  
 
• Power Analysis:  
Study Group Design: Two independent study groups  
Primary Endpoint: Continuous  
Data normally distributed  
Alpha: 0.05  
Power: 0.80  
 
Total number of patients enrolled: 84  
 
Based on similar study design [10], the standard deviation for pain scores was 3. Assuming 
a reasonable clinically significant difference of 2 on VAS score, this calculates to sample 
size of 35 in each group. Assuming attrition rate of 20%, 42 samples in each group will be 
obtained  
 
8) Study Endpoints*  
• Primary endpoint – change in pain score at time points 2 hours  and 24 hours after 
primary total knee arthroplasty for each group.  The numeric pain rating scale will 
be used - a higher pain score would indicate higher pain levels.  It is scaled from 0 -
10.  
• Secondary endpoint - (1) Total opi[INVESTIGATOR_502580] -operative 
period ( preoperative block versus postoperative block ) (2) change in  patient nausea 
scores and vomiting scores  at time points 2 hours, and 24 hours (3) duration of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] . 
 
 
9) Data Management*  
 
We will perform a superiority test and examine the mean pain score differences at time points [ADDRESS_951116] or Mann 
Whitney U with confidence intervals.  
 
INTERIM ANALYSIS:  
We plan to analyze this trial for futility by [CONTACT_502583] O’Brien and Fleming method of interim 
analysis. Specifically, we will analyze our groups at interims n = 2 1 (total 42) for futility using 
 Page 6 of 8 Revis ed: January 13 , 2025 appropriate boundaries for the mean difference. Should the mean difference exceed the boundary, 
the trial will conclude concluding significance between the groups; conversely, should the mean 
difference be below the boundary, the trial will terminate with futility.  
 
10) Risks /Benefits  
 
This study is a prospective cohort study that will collect private, identifiable information about 
human subjects. The main risk is to subjects’ confidentiality should an individual outside of the 
study team access the study data.  
 
There may be  no direct benefit to subjects.   
The group receiving the postoperative nerve block may have better pain control and less opi[INVESTIGATOR_173942]. 
This research might lead to the benefit of others should the analysis of the data lead to better 
selection of surgical candidates and possible interventions to reduce adverse outcomes.  
 
11) Adverse Events / Serious Adverse Events  
 
Any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human study participant, including any 
abnormal sign (e.g. abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the participants’ involvement in the research, whe ther or not 
considered related to participation in the research will be recorded for the first [ADDRESS_951117] -
operatively.

Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679015]:   NRX -101 (administered to subjects who respond to an intravenous 
infusion of ketamine - 0.5 mg/kg administered over 40 min; on Day 
0) 
Name [CONTACT_3261]:   Fixed dose combination of d -cycloserine + lurasidone  
Reference Product( s):  Lurasidone/placebo  
Title  of Study : NRX -101 for the Treatment of Acute Suicidal Ideation and 
Behavior (ASIB)  in Bipolar Depression  
Phase  of Development : Phase 2b/3 
Study Site (s): Approximately 12  study sites which may be either inpatient 
psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523224]/bipolar 
clinics with immediate access to inpatient care facilities.   All sites 
will have a minimum of 12 months prior experience in the use of 
ketamine for stabilization of patients with ASIB in Bipolar 
Depression as part of their practice of medicine.  
Study Duration:  Screening: up to 48 hours ; IV ketamine Day 0; 6 -week treatment; 4 
week follow up  
Background and Rationale:  
 
 DCS and Lurasidone , taken together,  have been shown to maintain 
a 50% reduction in depression and a 75% reduction in suicidality 
following a single infusion of ketamine in patients with suicidal 
ideation and bipolar depression.  Ketamine is increasingly used in 
medical practice to achieve rapid stabilization of patients with 
ASIB.  However, the duration of ketamine effect is limited and its 
repeated use for maintenance of stabilization is not proven.  
Objectives:  The objectives of the study are as follows:  
Primary Objective:  
• The primary objective of the study is to test the hypothesis 
that following stabilization of depression and ASIB in 
response to initial ketamine infusion, NRX -101 is superior 
to lur asidone alone and also superior to placebo as oral -
therapy for delaying time to relapse (resulting in a new 
treatment plan or the subject relapsing to baseline levels of 
depression or suicidality) in subjects with documented 
bipolar depression presenting w ith symptoms of 
depression and suicidal ideation.  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To demonstrate superiority over placebo and over 
lurasidone alone in maintaining remission from depression 
in bipolar disorder . 
• To demonstrate efficacy can be sustained with NRX -101 
dosing regimens  
• To demonstrate NRX -101 safety

 Endpoint(s)  Primary Endpoint:  
• The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, 
defined as the need to implement a new treatment plan or a 
return to baseline levels on the Columbia -Suicide Severity 
Rating S cale (C -SSRS), or the Montgomery Asberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) subset on the Bipolar 
Inventory of Symptom Severity (BISS).

 4. INTRODUCTION  
4.1   Acute Suicidal Ideation and B ehavior  in Bipolar Disorder  
Bipolar disorder  (i.e., form erly known as manic depressi ve disorder ) is a well -established psychiatric 
diagnosis , with a prevalence in  about 2.6% in the [LOCATION_002] (approximately 8.5 million  people ) (Kessler 
et al., 2005 ). The risk o f acute suicidal ideation and behavior (ASIB) is uniquely high in patients during 
bipolar depressi ve epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , compared to those with major depressive disorder (MDD), thought disorders, 
and personality disorders . Lifetime suicide behavior occurs in 25% to 56% of people with BD (Nierenberg 
et al. , 2001 ). About 3% to 14%  of the total 30,000 annual deaths from suicide  in the [LOCATION_002]  are 
associated with bipolar depression  (Mahli et al., 2015 ). The  overall  rate of death by [CONTACT_523261]  [ADDRESS_679035] a suicide attempt are 2.3 times more likely to die by [CONTACT_523262] a suicide attempt ( Coryell et al. , 2016 ). Thus, ASIB in bipolar depression has uniquely lethal 
clinical characteristics ( Pompi[INVESTIGATOR_45769] , Gonda, &Serafini , 2013 ). 
4.[ADDRESS_679036]  Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval  for use in patients with bipolar 
depression  and acute suicidality . Physicians are increasingly cautious about the use of selective serotonin 
release inhibitors ( SSRI’s), particularly in patients with ASIB because of evidence that SSRI’s and other 
antidepressants may actually increase the risk of suicidal ideation, particularly i n younger patients   (Stone 
et al., 2009 ). This evidence has resulted in an FDA warning on the label of current antidepressants. 
Moreover, it seems clear that antidepressants do not decrease suicidal ideation and behavior in proportion 
to their effect on symptoms of depression.  
In recent years, [ADDRESS_679037] effic acy in treating bipolar depression  
(olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_523229], quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and lurasidone) . While these medications are effective at 
reducing overall symptoms of depression, they do not specifically reduce suicidal ideation, as shown in 
recent clin ical trials of lurasidone ( Loebel et al., 2014a; Loebel et al., 2014b ). Moreover, in these two 
studies, individuals with active suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10 ≥ 4) were specifically excluded because 
of concerns regarding exacerbating suicidality . Similarly, acutely suicidal patients are routinely excluded 
from clinical trial s of other experimental anti -depressive agents . Thus, ASIB in bipolar depression 
represents a major unmet medical need that must frequently be treated with voluntary or involuntary 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523230]  (ECT) . 
Whereas all approved drugs for depression act primarily through monoaminergic mechanisms, the 
serendipi[INVESTIGATOR_523231] a rapid and profound effect on depression and suicidality 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 17 of 103  
 (Berman, et. al ., 2000 ) led to the realization th at the glutamate system and the N methyl -D-aspartate 
receptor (NMDAR) may play an important role in depression and suicidality.  
4.3   Rationale for Clinical Development Plan  
To meet the unmet need  for the treatment of ASIB  in adults with BD, NeuroRx, Inc. is d evelopi[INVESTIGATOR_523232] -
101, a fixed -dose combination oral capsule composed of d -cycloserine (DCS) and lurasidone, intended as a 
component of a sequential therapy , which  takes advantage of a unique synergistic confluence of three  
FDA -approved drugs with long histori es of safety.  
The combination of the drugs for the proposed sequential therapy  (DCS, lurasidone, ketamine)  has been 
tested in an acute toxicity study under a protocol reviewed in advance by [CONTACT_523263], even at other wise toxic doses (i.e. 2000 mg/kg) of lurasidone. Each of the 
proposed drugs  has a long history of safe use in humans and their AE profiles are well characterized. The 
safety of the three drugs, given in combination has been tested in a human phase [ADDRESS_679038] spectrum antibiotic approved for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB).  DCS has been used in 
millions of individuals without report of significant safety concerns .  
Lurasidone is an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_523233] h approval for the treatment of depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_523234]. Of the other drugs in its class, lurasidone requires the lowest treatment dose and 
demonstrates the fewest side effects . 
Ketamine is a nonbarbiturate, rapid -acting gene ral anesthetic for intravenous ( IV) or intramuscular 
injection, approved for surgical anesthesia.  Ketamine has a wide margin of safety. Its use for more than 
12,[ADDRESS_679039] is apparently 
unrelated to its properties as an anti -infective By [CONTACT_523264] -

provides a review of relevant non -clinical and clinical experience for each. Safety information is also

4.[ADDRESS_679041] that increases in anxiety/akathisia may play a critical role. ( Harada et al., 2014 ; 
Popovic et al ., 2015 ) Serotonin -related anxiety/akathisia may be modele d in rodents using several well -
estab lished assay systems such as the elevated plus maze and are known to be sensitive to serotonergic 
agents. ( Sachdev, Brune , 2000 ) In this assay, increased percent time spent in the open arms of the maze is 
believed to be associated with increased akathisia and anxiety . In contrast, increased total distance traveled 
in the maze is thought to be a signal related to psychosis. As shown by [CONTACT_379281] ( 2014 ) and in

 Table 1 (below), DC S significantly reduces the anxiogenic effects of lurasidone and quetiapi[INVESTIGATOR_523235] % time  spent  in open arm, suggesting that this treatment might reduce medication -induced 
suicidality as well as suicidality associated with BD itself. These findings  are consistent with the 
documented anti -suicidal effectiveness of acute ketamine treatment ( DiazGranados et al., 2010 ; Ballard et. 
al., 2014 ), including theories that ketamine’s reductions in suicidality are associated with reductions not 
only in depressi on but also in anxiety .  
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679042] of NMDA and 5 -HT2a Antagonists in Rodent Akathisia Model  
 
Source: Javitt , [ADDRESS_679043] the ability to reverse low -level 
psychotomimetic effects of DCS  and ketamine . This signal may be apprec iated from the decrease in 
distance traveled when lurasidone is added to DCS. Lurasidone mediates its antipsychotic effects at both 
D2 and 5 -HT2A receptors. As opposed to pure serotonergic agents used in the treatment of major 
depressive disorders (e.g. , SSRIs), the additional D2 blockade of lurasidone makes it a clinically effective 
antipsychotic and, thus, also potentially effective in treatment of psychotic symptoms that may be induced  
by [CONTACT_101033] . 
Clearly the phenomena observed in rodents should  not be viewed as isomorphic with drug - induced 
akathisia and/or jitteriness/anxiety syndrome in humans. However, we believe that these findings provide a 
rationale for combining glycine site -binding NMDAR antagonists with [ADDRESS_679044] noted in the late 1950’s when it was first introduced as 
a treatment for tuberculosis ( TB). Several clinicians noted dramatic improvement in patients’ depressive 
symptoms, leading to suggestions of potential psychotropic effects. These effects we re subsequently 
confirmed in small  scale clinical studies. ( Crane, 1959 and 1961 ). The mechanism of action was unknown 
at the time and the finding was not pursued. The interaction of DCS with the NMDA receptor was first 
demonstrated in 1989, ( Hood et al., 1989 ), leading to some interest in NMDAR blockers as potential 
antidepressant treatments. ( Trullas, Skolnick 1990 ; Skolnick et al. , 1996 ). For example, both DCS and the 
related compound ACPC were shown to be active in mice, using the forced swim test for d epression. 
(Lopes  et al. , 1997 ) To the best of our knowledge, no clinical antidepressant research programs targeting 
the NMDA receptor were initiated at that time.  
Interest in the potential clinical use of DCS as an antidepressant agent was renewed followi ng Berman’s 
fortuitous observation of ketamine’s rapid antidepressant effect in 2000 . An initial  study performed with 
DCS at a dose of 250 mg/d did not show therapeutic effect, but did demonstrate relative lack of 
psychotomimetic side effect when DCS was c ombined with concurrent antidepressant treatment ( Heresco -
Levy , Javitt  et al., 2006 ). Based upon these safety data, a study using a higher dose of 1000 mg/d) was

4.6   Investigational Therapy  
The investigational therapy to be evaluated in this study  consists of sequential treatment consisting of the 
following components:  
1. an initial, one -time intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 m g/kg administered over 40 min)  on Day 
0, followed by  
2. twice daily oral capsules of NRX 101 (d -cycloserine [DCS] + lura sidone), which is initiated on D ay 
1 (in subjects who respond to ketamine) and continued for up to [ADDRESS_679048] ketamine’s potential for abuse and psychosis.  
4.7   Dosing Rationale  
The doses chosen for the three components of the sequenti al therapy are based on current dosing 
recommendations for each. In Stage1, the one -time IV infusion of ketamine on Day  0 at 0.5  mg/kg over 
[ADDRESS_679049] recommended IV  concentration ( 1 mg/kg ) to induce anesthesia , and is 
consistent with s tudies of ketamine for use in depress ion.  
DCS is well -tolerated as a second -line treatment for TB  at therapeutic split daily oral doses in the range of 
500 to 1000 mg/d ay. The recommended oral dose of lurasidone f or the treatment of acute depressive BD is 
20 to 120 mg/day for up to [ADDRESS_679050] safety la beling for each of 
the drugs, which are included in  the Investigator Brochure (IB) . 
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679051] the hypothesis that following response to initial ketamine 
infusion , experimental drug NRX -101 (DCS +  lurasidone ) is superior to lurasidone alone and placebo as 
oral-therapy for delay ing time to relapse (resulting in a new treatment plan or the subject relapsing to 
baseline levels of depression or suicidality) in subjects with documented bipolar dep ression presenting with 
symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation . 
The primary study hypothesis (alternative hypothesis) is that ketamine  and experimental drug NRX -101 
(K/N) delays the time to documented relapse as compared to both lurasidone (L) and pl acebo (P) as measured 
by [CONTACT_350876] (h) versus the null hypothesis of no delay in time to relapse for either comparator treatment 
(ketamine /lurasidone [K/L] and ketamine /placebo [K/P]) as follows:  
H0: hNRX -101 < h L and h P 
Ha: hNRX -101 > hL and h P. 
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as the need to implement a new treatment 
plan or a return to baseline levels on the C olumbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) , or the 
Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) subset on the Bipolar Inventory of Symptom 
Severity ( BISS ). 
All relapses will be doc umented by [CONTACT_523266] a monthly basis by a Relapse 
Adjudication Committee. The Relapse Adjudication Committee (RAC) will determine whether the relapse 
met the primary endpoint criteria.   
5.2   Secondary Objective  
The s econdary objectives of the study are the following:  
• To demonstrate bipolar depression efficacy  
• To demonstrate efficacy can be sustained with NRX -101 dosing regimens  
• To demonstrate NRX -101 safety   
The secondary study hypotheses (alternative hypotheses favoring K/N vs. K/L and K/P) are the following:  
1. K/N will favorably separate from both K/L and K/P by 72 hours, with sustained difference between 
groups thereafter.  
2. All cause discontinuation (including  discontinuation for continued suicidal ideation) will be lower 
for K/N than both K/L and K/P.  
3. K/N will favorably separate from K/L and K/P starting at day 7, with sustained difference 
thereafter .  
4. Improvements within the K/N group observed at Week 2 will remain stable to end of study.  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 26 of 103  
 5. C-SSRS scores will remain <4 for 4 weeks following treatment discontinuation ( i.e., “crisis” will 
resolve within the 6 week time period with more favorable outcomes in the K/N group as compared 
to K/L and K/P . 
Additionally, symptom improvement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_379310]: C -SSRS, CHRT, and the BISS  (including its subscales).  These measures will be assessed at the 
times specified on the Study Activity Schedule , Table 3. 
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679052] the hypothesis that following response to ketamine infusion, exper imental 
drug NRX -101 (DCS +  lurasidone) is superior to  both lurasidone alone and placebo as oral -therapy for 
delaying t ime to relapse  (resulting in a new treatment plan or the subject  relapsing to baseline levels of 
depression or suicidality) in subjects with documented bipolar depression presenting with symptoms of 
depression and suicidal ideation.  
6.2   Methods  
In Stage 1 eligible subjects will initially receive an infusion of open -label ketamine 0.5mg/Kg. Those who 
do not respond to ketamine infusion as mea sured by a ≥25% improvement in the MADRS  subset on the 
BISS  and a reduction in C -SSRS suicidal ideation to ≤ [ADDRESS_679053] s with suicidal ideation or behav iors. 
Subjects who respond successfully to ketamine infusion, as defined above (≥25% improvement in the 
MADRS subset of the BISS and C -SSRS ≤3) at [ADDRESS_679054] infusion will proceed to Stage 2 and be 
random ized to either  experimental drug  NRX -101 ( DCS + l urasidone) , lurasidone  alone,  or placebo . 
Efficacy data will be collected for the subjects responding to ketamine through [ADDRESS_679055] a significant  safety  risk for clinical deterioration or suicide .

8.[ADDRESS_679067]  
Subjects may be recruited upo n presentation in an outpatient psychiatric practice, emergency department, 
community mental health setting, or psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  The site of care will be either (1) a community 
mental health/bipolar clinic setting with overnight observation capabilit y and with immediate access to a 
psychiatric inpatient facility or (2) an inpatient setting.  Only sites that have been using ketamine for 
stabilization of patients with bipolar depression as part of their practice of medicine for at least [ADDRESS_679068] written criteria for ensuring the safety of patients under 
their care who receive ketamine.  
It should be emphasized that dedicated (typi[INVESTIGATOR_116389] -profit) psychiatric research facilities whose physicians 
do not otherwise provide ongoing care to patients wit h suicidal bipolar depression are not eligible to 
participate as study sites because of concerns that such facilities may not have adequate clinical experience 
or resources to ensure patient safety over the course of the study.  
The study protocol does not dictate the site of care (inpatient vs. outpatient).  That is determined by [CONTACT_523268] , based upon assessment of the patient’s 
acuity, the patient’s home environment, and other factors that psychiatri sts expert in the management of 
this patient population use in determining the appropriate site of care.  It is anticipated that subjects 
enrolled at C -SSRS level [ADDRESS_679069] s who meet study criteria for relapse  at any point during the study will be withdrawn from the study 
and offered clinically -appropriate treatment as determined by [CONTACT_523269], which may

8.2.2 Drug Levels  
Blood samples for monitoring therapeutic drug levels  will be collected on all subjects to veri fy 
exposure and consi stency with the randomization schedule. The timing of the blood draws are 
defined in Table 3 and include both pre -dosage (time 0) and post initial dosing of investigational 
product  within  the first 2 hours. Analyses of the samples will be conducted by [CONTACT_11378].  
8.2.3 Randomization phase   
Following the documented observance of a therapeutic response to IV ketamine as defined by a 
25% or greater reduction in the baseline MADRS and a C -SSRS < [ADDRESS_679084] s will be randomized 2: 1:1 to either a fixed dose combination of experimental drug NRX -
101 ( DCS + lurasidone) or to an identical capsule containing placebo  + lurasidone or to an 
identical capsule containing placebo . Institution balancing will be used to ensure that treatment 
and control groups are balanced with stratification according to C -SSRS [ADDRESS_679085] -infusion 
(1, 2). Subject s who respond to ketamine will be followed for [ADDRESS_679086] will b e provided in a blinded fashion to sites for dispensation to subjects .  
8.2.5 Outcome and Safety Measures  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Outcome Measures  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as (1) a return to  a score of  >4 on 
the C -SSRS, (2) a score of >20 on the  MADRS subset of the BISS  following a response to 
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 43 of 103  
 ketamine at 24 hours , or (3) the treating physician’s determination that a change in treatment 
plan, such as re -hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], ECT, or addition of new antidepressant drugs i s required . 
All site-defined relapses will be adjudicated by a Relapse Adjudication Committee (RAC) which 
will review documentation provided by [CONTACT_523278] . The RAC will meet monthly . The RAC is 
authorized to determine that relapse occurred even if the site does not make this determination.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Additionally, symptom improvement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_523279]: C -SSRS,  Concise Health Risk Tracking –Clinician, -Self-Rated (CHRT -C 
and –SR), and BISS . These measures will be assessed at the times specified on the Schedule  of 
Study Activities , Table 3.  
The C-SSRS (and the retrospective Columbia -Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment 
(C-CASA component), Suicide Ideation and Behavior Questionnaire (SIBQ) , BPRS, CHRT -C 
and –SR, will be evaluated within and between study treatment groups. Mean changes fr om 
baseline for the differences from baseline and after randomization baseline will be evaluated 
using a paired t -test with in each study group and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L and K/P.  
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Diagnostic Metric  
The following diagnostic metric will  be evaluated at baseline:  
• MINI 7.0.2  
[IP_ADDRESS].4. Additional Endpoints  
The following additional endpoints will be recorded and analyzed for both study stages : 
• Study dose per treatment group  
• All-cause discontinuation (and reason for discontinuation)  
• Suicide rates  
• Incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523239] -related outcomes  
• Proportion of subjects who are treated with new SSRIs or have increased SSRI dosages  
• Proportion of subjects who discontinue SSRIs or have reduced SSRI dosages.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Endpoints  
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Overall Adverse Events  
Separate safety analyses will be performed for the two stages for the Safety population . Safety 
endpoints will include ad verse events (AE), vital signs , and relevant clinical chemistries and 
hematology parameters.  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 44 of 103  
 The princ iple of treatment emergence will be employed for the analysis of AE data . Treatment 
emergence is defined to be any event that occurred during the observation period and was not 
present at baseline, or one which represents an exacerbation of a condition pre sent at baseline .  
Events emerging during ketamine treatment  will be counted during the randomized phase of the 
study  if not resolved by [CONTACT_523280] . Unresolved AE outcomes at 
the end of randomized treatment  will be followe d for an additional seven days or until resolution, 
whichever occurs earlier.  
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_61132] . For each study treatment, safety data will be 
collected and analyzed per stage or until treatment -emergent AEs are resolved . The type , 
incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of AEs will be reported for 
treatment -emergent and suspected adver se reactions . Reasons for withdrawal due to AEs will 
also be reported . Narratives will be written for every AE classified as  serious or associated with 
death . Safety results will be displayed separately for each stage and combined.  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed using two -sided Fisher Exact tests to compare K/N vs. 
K/L and K/P . Mean changes from baseline will be displ ayed for each serum chemistry and 
hematology parameter as well as the shift; unpaired t -tests will be used to compare K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P; in addition, paired t -tests will be performed for the change s from baseline for each 
study treatment group .   
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Safety Measures  
The Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects ( PRISE ), CADSS, and Barnes Akathesia Scale 
(BARS)  (including the global severity rating) will be evaluated within and between study 
treatment groups. Mean changes from baseline for the differe nces from baseline and after 
randomization baseline will be evaluated using a paired t -test within each study group and an 
unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L and K/P.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Other Safety Measures  
It is expected that some subject s in both groups (more amo ng those randomized to 
placebo+lurasidone  and placebo ) will have recurrence of their depression and, possibly 
suicidality. Therefore, the investigators plan to effect careful surveillance of all study subjects as 
follows:  
Subjects who receive ketamine will be maintained under continuous professional observation 
until stabilization is documented or ketamine is deemed not to have achieved stabilization and 
the treating physician has elected another therapeutic option (which in most cases will be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523240]).  In general, study subjects will be maintained under direct observation 
in a mental health center or inpatient setting during the [ADDRESS_679087]  or family /significant other  concerns . The contact [CONTACT_523281] a telephone 
or actual visit.   All on -site study visits will include a meeting with a study p sychiatrist.  
The study will employ the u se of HIPAA -compliant, electronic video monitoring of medication 
compliance , with the capability to send an immediate alert for outreach with any missed doses of 
medication.   A non -adherence period of 12 hours (i.e. 2 missed doses will trigger outreach by 
[CONTACT_3462]).  
In case of loss of  phone contact [CONTACT_523282] -adherence to medication, study staff will contact 
[CONTACT_523283] /significant other .  If study staff determines that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523241], either the family member will take the subject  to the emergency room or the staff will 
contact [ADDRESS_679088] infusion (1, 2), age (<25, 25 -39, >40), and gender.  
Vital signs will be obtained at every  office  visit.  ECGs  will be measured at the Screen V isits, and 
at Visit s 1, 5, and [ADDRESS_679089] 10 minutes.  All digital ECGs will be documented by [CONTACT_523284], time, heart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, RR interval, QT, and QTcF intervals. Mean 
differences will be calculated using the Fridericia formula (Puddu et al ., 1988 ). Vital signs and 
ECGs will also be evaluated within and between study treatment groups.  If indicated,  additional 
ECG assessments can be made at the discretion of the investigator. The investigator will judge 
the overall interpretation as normal or abnormal. If abnormal, it will be decided as to whether or 
not the abnormality is clinically significant or not clinically significant and the reason for the 
abnormality will be recorded on the eCRF. Abnormal values shall not be recorded as AE s unless 
deemed clinically significant.  
At the Screen visit, and at Visits 1, 5, and 9, subject s will have their blood drawn for chemistry 
and CBC blood tests. At Screen, and at Visits [ADDRESS_679090] a physical 
examination .  If these tests or exams are abnormal per established site -specific normal ranges, it 
will be decided by [CONTACT_523285] -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.

 not clinically significant and recorded on the eCRF. Abnormal and clinically significan t lab 
values will be reported as AEs if they fulfil l any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. Abnormal lab values (clinically significant and 
clinically non -significant), will be reviewed monthly by [CONTACT_523286]. Should 
any abnormal lab values exceed rates described in the IB, the FDA and SPONSOR  will be 
notified within regulatory timelines.  McNemar paired comparison tests will be performed within 
study treatment groups for the abnorma l percents while two -sided Fisher Exact tests will be 
performed between treatment groups.  
8.2.[ADDRESS_679091] ance to the schedule in  Table 3. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Measure s 
Bipolar  Inventory of Symptom Scale  (BISS) (Bowden et al., 2007 ): The BISS i s a 44-item 
clinician -rated scale (22 items for the depression subscale and 22 items for the mania scale), in 
which each items is rated on a [ADDRESS_679092] high internal consistency (Chronbach's alpha=0.93 for the Total 
Scale, 0.92 for the depression subscale, and 0.90 for the mania subscale) and inter -rater 
reliability (ICC=0.96 for total scale, 0.98 for depression subscale, and 0.95 for mania subscale) 
(Gonzalez , et al, 2008).  Regarding discriminant validity, the BISS total score was able to 
significantly distinguish between patients in a depressed, manic or mixed epi[INVESTIGATOR_523242], recovered patients, and healthy controls (Gonzalez et al, 2008).  
Convergent validity was demonstrated by [CONTACT_523287] (i.e., r=.64 to .94) between 
the BISS total score and the BISS depression subscale and the MADRS, an d between the BISS 
total score and the mania subscale and the YMRS across all patient and control groups described 
above;  divergent validity was demonstrated by [CONTACT_523288] (i.e., r= -.14-0.30) correlations 
between the BISS depression subscale and the YMRS  scale, and between the BISS mania scale 
and the MADRS (r= -.06-.31). 
 
The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) (Posner et al ., 2007 ): The C -SSRS is a 
low-burden measure of the spectrum of suicidal ideation and behavior that was developed in the 
National Institute of Mental Health Treatment of Adolescent Suicide Attempters Study to assess 
severity and track suicidal events through any treatment. It is a clinical interview providing a 
summary of both ideation and behavior that can be administered d uring any evaluation or risk 
assessment to identify the level and type of suicidality present. The C -SSRS can also be used 
during treatment to monitor for clinical worsening. The C -SSRS will be performed to assess 
suicidal ideation and behavior.  C-CASA is the retrospective counterpart of the more detailed 
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679093] developed for a prospective 
national study of treatment for adolescent suicide attempts. C -SSRS was developed by [CONTACT_523289].  It contains a 1 -to-5 rating scale for suicidal 
ideation of increasing severity (from a “wish list to die” to an “active thought of killing oneself 
with plan and intent”), in contrast to C -CASA, which only has one ideation item. (IOM, 2010 ) 
The time frame is for both lifetime and the past six months for the Baseline/Screening scale and 
since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale.  
Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS ) (Overall  & Gorham , 1962): The BPRS is an [ADDRESS_679094] ’s own report.  It has been widely used to 
measure change in pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment trials and  provides a rapid 
and efficient evaluation of treatment response in clinic drug studies and in clinical settings. Only 
the 4 -item positive symptom subscale BPRS+ (i .e., suspi[INVESTIGATOR_23703], hallucinations, unusual 
thought content, and conceptual disorganization ) will be used in this study. It is highly sensitive 
to change, and excellent inter -rater reliability can be achieved (i.e., ICC>.80) with training and a 
standard interview procedure.   Concurrent validity has been established by r=.92 between the 
positive symptom subscale and the corresponding subscale of the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale, and sensitivity to change has been demonstrated by [CONTACT_523290].  
Concise Health Risk Tr acking – Self Report (CHRT -SR) and Clinician Rating (CHRT -C) 
scales (Trivedi et al, 2011): This is both a subject  self-report assessment of suicidality and 
related thoughts and behaviors , with a corresponding clinician rated scale . The scale s are 
designed to quickly and easily track suicidality in a manner consistent with the Columbia 
Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C -CASA) (Posner et al, 2007). The CHRT -SR 
is a 16-item self -report suicidal ideation scale and the CHRT -C is a 9-item clinician -rated 
behavioral module. Items are rated on a fully anchored 5 -point Likert scale with responses 
ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The time frame is the past seven (7) 
days.  The CHRT -SR has good internal consistency (Cronbach's alp ha 0.88-0.90), convergent 
validity with MADRS suicide item (r=.60) and QIDS suicide item (r=0.59), and divergent 
validity with the YMRS (r=.02).  Predictive validity was established by [CONTACT_523291] -related serious adverse events am ong 482 patients with bipolar disorder in a 
multicenter trial (Reilly -Harrington et al, 2016).  
Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Questionnaire (SIBQ): The pur pose of this instrument is to 
ensure clinicians properly assess and document suicidal ideation and be havior as well as any 
study decisions (study exclusion of subject, filing of a serious adverse event) pertaining to 
suicidality. It will be completed by [CONTACT_523292].

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Measures  
 
In addition to the measures described under e fficacy, including CSSR -S, BISS (MADRS) 
CHRT -SR and CHRT -C and SIBQ, the following safety measures will be employed:  
Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE): The self -reported PRISE questionnaire will 
be used for the specific symptoms considered b y the patients as more or less tolerable drug side 
effects. The nine domains (gastrointestinal, heart, skin, nervous system, genital ⁄ urinary, sleep, 
sexual functioning, and other symptoms) will be individually and cumulatively evaluated using a 
paired t -test with each study group and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L and K/P to assess the 
mean side effect or adverse event.  Reasons for premature discontinuation and dose reduction, 
including intolerable side effects, will be recorded.  Drug interactions b etween DCS and 
lurasidone will be examined.  
Clinician -Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) : The CADSS is a 23 -item scale 
(Bremner et al 1998). It is a reliable, valid instrument. The severity of each dissociative symptom 
ranges from 0 (not presen t) to 4 (extreme). The CADSS total score will be calculated as the sum 
of the individual item scores. For the CADSS, change from the first time point  to each  
subsequent  time point will be calculated as the 40-minute, 80 -minute, and 120 -minute 
assessment  minus the 0 (-5 minutes)  score.  The scale is  administered at  0 (-5 minutes), 40, 80, 
and 120 minutes from the start of the infusion. The timeframe is “at this moment ”.  The CADSS 
has been validated in healthy subjects and patients with psychiatric illness.  
Barnes Akathesia Scale (BA RS): The Barnes Akathesia Scale (Barnes TR,  1989) is a clinician -
rated scale to assess drug -induced akathisia and classify it as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. It 
comprises items for rating the observable, rest less movements wh ich characteriz e the condition, 
the subjective awareness of restlessness, and any distress associated with the akathisia. In 
addition, there is an item for rating global severity. It is the scale used most commonly in trials 
comparing incidence and severit y of akathisia between antipsychotic medications and placebo.  
The time frame is “at this time”. With trained raters, the BARS has demonstrated strong inter -
rater reliability (Kappa= 0.74 -0.95) (Barnes , 2003).  The BARS has been used to support the 
concur rent validity of actigraphic monitoring in akathisia (Barnes, 2003).   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Other Diagnostic Instruments  
MINI 7.0.2 : The M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) is a short, 
structured diagnostic interview developed initially in [ADDRESS_679095] s will be compensated for their time at each visit, at a rate 
determined appropriate by [CONTACT_135785] (estimated compensation:  $20/hour). We 
believe that this level of subject compensation, while non -coercive, facilitates adherence to 
assessments and procedures that require frequent, inconvenient visits.

(e.g., rifampin). Lurasidone  dose should not exceed 40 mg/day if co -administered with moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. DCS has never been reported to have an y interaction with lurasidone.  
It is anticipated that subjects entering the study will be receiving concurrent disorder -directed 
treatment with various combinations of medications including:  
1. Approved antidepressants ( e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TeCAs, fluoxetine),  but no 5 -HT-2a

conduct of the study with the exception of the group responsible for maintaining the IWRS. That 
group will be able to identify patient -specific treatment according to the uniquely assigned kit 
number.

that relapse or experience  a SAE will require real -time interaction with the medical monitor  to 
confirm the event and to decide if the event must be r eported to regulatory agencies or IRBs.  
The Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB)  (refer to Section 14.2) can request a code break , 
either for an individual subject or on a g roup basis as described in the DSMB charter. The 
DSMB  may request to break the blind if:  
• There is an imbalance in safety parameters between groups  
and/or  
• In case of single or multiple significant AEs/SAEs that mi ght be drug -related.  
In such a case, the chair of the DSMB  would request unblinding , either of an individual subject or 
on a group basis, and the C RO would then request unblinding from the third party keeper of the 
randomization codes.

7 days of acute treatment plus 6 weekly follow -up assessments (Days 10, 14, 21, 28, 35 , and 42). 
Acceptable reasons for early discontinuation include the following: 1) non -response to ketamine 
treatment, 2) request of subject , 3) decision of  physician, 4) SAE , 5) and protocol violation.  
A subject  who decides to discontinue the investigational product will always be asked about the 
reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. If possible, they will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_98225]. Adverse ev ents will be followed up (see Section  12.6) until resolution.

 11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as a return to  a score of  >4 on the 
C-SSRS, and/or a score of [ADDRESS_679109] model to include the above cited covariates .  
Titration of DCS or  lurasidone within the dosing range will not be considered to be a relapse .  
All of the instruments used to measure ASIB or depression constitute serial continuous and 
ordinal outcomes which will be analyzed using MMRM, which accounts for missing data and 
early discontinuations . These instruments include the following:  
• C-SSRS (and the retrospective C -CASA component)  
• CHRT (CHRT -SR and CHRT -C) 
• BISS  
• SIBQ  
• BPRS  
The models will include treatment group, study visit, the interaction between study visit and 
treatmen t group, the baseline of the variable being analyzed, C -SSRS [ADDRESS_679110] infusion (1, 
2), age (<25 yrs, 25 -39 yrs, >40 yrs), and gender as fixed effects . The reason for missing data 
will be evaluated as a condition of MMRM analysis.  
Means, mean changes,  standard deviations, and ranges will be presented separately for Stage [ADDRESS_679111] at each time; these p -values 
will be presented as descriptive statistics.

 12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1 Suicidal Ideation and Clinical Management  
The documentation and proper management of  suicidal ideation by [CONTACT_523301] (SIBQ), completed by [CONTACT_523302], and by [CONTACT_317263], independent third party  raters during the screening 
period.  
Any subject  who, based on the investigator’s judgment, poses an imminent risk of suicide should 
be discontinued from the study (see Section 9.2). All efforts will be taken to minimize the risk of 
suicide and the investigator will carefully monitor the subject . If durin g the course of the study, 
subject s show evidence of suicidal behavior, the subject s will be evaluated immediately or 
referred to their attending psychiatrist , a local emergency room , or another appropriate clinical 
setting  for further evaluation to see if  they are safe to continue in the study.  The site will have the 
ability to direct any subject  who requires emergency hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523244] a [ADDRESS_679112] serious worsening of their 
condition.  
Suicide and attempted suicide, irrespective of the method, but occurring in connection with the 
use of IP, will be reported as AEs (all suicides  are SAEs; attempted suicides can be either serious 
or non -serious AEs). The event will be identified as suicide or attempted suicide, and the method 
of the suicide or attempt will be provided. If an attempted suicide meets the criteria for an SAE, 
the eve nt must be reported according to the guidelines in Section s 12.3 and [IP_ADDRESS] . If a suicide 
attempt does not meet the criteria for an SAE , it will be considered a reportable AE and a 
Suicidal  Ideati on and Behavior Reportable Event Form  will be completed by [CONTACT_11168].  
All events of suicidal ideation and behavior will be carefully monitored. These include events of 
suicide attempts, emergence or significant worsening of suicidal ideation, comple ted suicides, 
and suicidal behavior. As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].1 , the C-SSRS and MADRS items of the 
BISS, as well as the clinician’s judgment, will be used in the assessment of suicidal risk by [CONTACT_1275]. The investigator’s clinical judgment a nd conclusion regarding suicidal risk will be 
documented in the SIBQ for that visit. Clinically significant (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_68331]) emergence or worsening of suicidal ideation  and/or behavior will be considered 
reportable events  and docum ented as AE s, and a Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Reportable 
Event Form will be completed and submitted to  medical monitor within 24 business hours of the 
site’s knowledge of the ideation or behavior. The subject should be withdrawn from the study 
and the  event will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_523303] a potential endpoint event.  
If suicidal behavior meets the criteria for a SAE, according to the guidelines in  Section  12.3, 
investigators are required to report the event according to th e guidelines for SAEs in 
Section s 12.3 and [IP_ADDRESS]  and submit the completed SAE form to  the medical monitor within [ADDRESS_679113] version of the AE dictionary, MedDRA , will be used by [CONTACT_523304].  For regulatory reporting, SAEs will be 
processed  in the E lectronic Data Capture (EDC)  System and coded using MedDRA.  
If a subject (or subject’s partner) becomes pregnant during the study, it must be  reported  within 
24 business  hours of the time the investigator becomes aware of the event  and in accordan ce with 
the procedures described on the Pregnancy Report Form.  Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an 
SAE/ AE unless there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_40958] a study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness 
of a contraceptive medication . Any pregnancy that occur s from Visit [ADDRESS_679114] will be discontinued from study medication.  
12.2 Definition of Adverse Even ts 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject 
administered a  medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An AE does not 
necessarily  have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavorable  and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease 
temporally associated  with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) 
product, whether or not  related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) pr oduct. 
(Definition per  ICH). 
This definition  includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or 
frequency from the  baseline condition, or abnormal results of d iagnostic procedures, including 
laboratory test  abnormalities.  
The followi ng variables will be collected for each AE:  
• AE (verbatim)  
• The date and time when the AE started and stopped  
• Maximum intensity or intensity or changes in intensity  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Expectedness  
• Investigator causality rating against study dru g (yes or no)  
• Action taken with regard to the Investigational Product (IP)  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 65 of 103  
 • AE caused subject ’s withdrawal from the study (yes or no)  
• Outcome  
Any AEs that are unresolved at the subject’s last AE assessment in the study are followed up by 
[CONTACT_198672] r as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the eCRF. 
MGH CTNI or its representative retains the right to request additional information for any 
subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary.  
12.3 Definiti on of Serious Adverse Even ts 
The following criteria define a Serious Adverse Event:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening event  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] >24 hours or 
• Prolongation >24 hours of inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Cong enital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically important event, as defined in this protocol*  
*Medical and scientific judgment will be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that ma y not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These will usually be considered serious.  
If a serio us and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the study drug and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis), the event must 
be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of 
the study endpoint (e.g., all -cause mortality).  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:  
• Date AE met criteria for SAE  
• Date investigator became aware of SAE  
• AE is serious due to  
• Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
Protocol NRX -101-001  NeuroRx, Inc.  
  CONFIDENTIAL  
Page 66 of 103  
 • Date of death  
• Autopsy performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s)  
• Causality assessment in relation to study drug  
• Causality assessment in relation to other medication  
• Description of AE  
Intensities will be reporte d for each AE in the following categories: a) Mild (awareness of sign or 
symptom, but easily tolerated); b) Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with 
normal activities); c) Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activitie s). 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of intensity 
whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_523305] . An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily 
be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered 
severe nausea, but not an SAE.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke, but would be an SAE.  
Worsening symptoms of the primary study condition (i.e. , bipolar depression ) will not be 
recorded as an AE.  However, if inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523245] , the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523246].  
Study drug abuse is an SAE, even when t here are no symptoms or additional AEs, and  will be 
reported according to the guidelines in Section  12.5. Misuse of IP is an AE, but is not considered 
an SAE unless accompanied by [CONTACT_523306].  
Should an overdose of study d rug occur, it must be reported in accordance with the procedures 
described in Section  12.5. An overdose associated with symptoms must be reported as an AE, 
while an overdose without associated symptoms, must be reported only on  the separate Clinical 
Study Overdose Report Form.

treatment.  
The investigator will assess the causal relationship (i.e., the relationship to study treatment) 
between the IP and AEs, and answer “yes” or “no” to the question “Do you consider that there is 
a reasonable possibility that the event may have  been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?”  
Causal relationship in cases where the depression or suicidal ideation  has deteriorated due to lack 
of effect will be classified as no reasonable possibility.  For SAEs, causal relationship will also be 
assessed . Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal 
relationship is implied as “yes.”   
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679116] in response to the open question from the study 
personnel: “Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?” or revealed by 
[CONTACT_523307] t; classified as mild, moderate, or severe ; and recorded 
in the eCRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other 
signs or symp toms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.  
Subjects shall be encouraged to contact [CONTACT_1720] a member of the clinical site  staff at 
any time between visits concerning AEs or worsening of symptoms.  
Abnormal and clinically significant lab values will be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the 
SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the study drug. The principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_523247] -specific lab normal ranges. Adverse 
events, including abnormal lab values (clinically significant and clinically non -significant), will 
be reviewe monthly for trends by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_523248]. Should any 
abnormal lab values exceed rates described in the IB, the FDA will be notified within regulatory 
timelines. If deterioration in a laboratory valu e/vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory 
result/vital sign will be considered as additional information. Wherever possible, the reporting 
investigator will use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low 
hemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant 
deteriorations in non -mandated parameters will be reported as AE(s).  
Any new or aggravated clinicall y relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination as 
compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to the 
disease for which the study d rug is being studied. It may be an increase in the severity of the 
disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of 
worsening bipolar depression will be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events 
(except for suicidal ideation or behavior) which are unequivocally due to disease progression 
will not be reported as an AE during the study.

 12.6 Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non -serious, will be  reported fr om 
the time a signed and dated Informed Consent Form ( ICF) is obtained until completion of the 
subject ’s last  study -related procedure (which may include contact [CONTACT_20687] -up of safety). 
Serious adverse  events, including those spontaneously reported to the  site-investigator from the 
time a signed and  dated ICF is obtained until within [ADDRESS_679117] be 
recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the  eCRF. Whenever  possible, 
diagnoses will be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology  (e.g., cough, 
runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, a nd head congestion  will be reported as “upper  respi[INVESTIGATOR_42977] ”). Investigators must record in the CRF their opi[INVESTIGATOR_523249].  All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source 
documen t and reported according to CRO instructions.  
The sponsor  assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory  authorities. 
CRO , on behalf of the sponsor, will also report to  site investigator s all SAE s that are unlisted 
(unexpected) a nd associated  with the use of the study drug. CRO  will report these  events to the 
designated IRB, on behalf of the sponsor.  
12.6.1  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
The EDC platform will provide a mechanism for sites to report SAE s, and for the site 
investigato rs and medical monitor to sign off on the SAE reports. Reportable SAEs will be sent 
to the FDA by [CONTACT_456] . CRO will notify sites of reportable SAEs, as outlined in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
When a SAE is discovered, it will be repo rted immediately (within 24 business hours) to the 
Medical Monitor, as described below. Serious adverse events will be reported within 24 business 
hours of the site’s knowledge of the event to the IRB (see below). Reportable events which do 
not meet the cr iteria for an SAE will include (but will not be limited to): (a) pregnancy, and (b) 
clinically significant (in the judgment of the investigator) severe psychiatric complications .  The 
site P rincipal Investigator  will determine whether the event is study -related. All SAE s and 
reportable events will be reported within 48 business hours of [ CRO ] receipt of an SAE or other 
reportable event form to the sponsor, Medical Monitor , and the study site investigators.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Procedures for Assessing, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events and Serious 
Adverse Events  
Throughout the duration of the study, the Investigator will closely monitor each subject for 
evidence of drug intolerance and for the development of clinical or laboratory evidence of adverse 
events.  All adverse e vents (expected or unexpected) which occur during the course of the study, 
whether observed by [CONTACT_162837], and whether or not thought to be drug -
related, will be reported and followed until resolution or until they become stable.  
The description of the adverse event will include description of event, start date, stop date, 
intensity, if it was serious, relationship to test drug, change in test drug dosage, if the subject died, 
and if treatment was required.  
Events will be coded to on e of the following intensity categories below:  
Severity  Definition  
Mild  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but no disruption of usual activity  
Moderate  Event sufficient to affect usual activity (disturbing)  
Severe  Event causes inability to work or perform usual activities 
(unacceptable)

 Events will be coded into one of the following causality categories as defined below:  
Category  Definition  
Unrelated  Clearly and incontrovertibly due only to extraneous causes, and does 
not meet criteria listed under poss ible or probable.  
Unlikely  Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration. 
May have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state or by 
[CONTACT_162839][INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
Possible  Follows a reasonable temporal sequ ence from administration, but 
may have been also produced by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, 
environmental factors or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_191293].  
Probable  Clear -cut temporal association with administration with improvement 
on cessation of investigational medicinal product or reduction in 
dose. Reappears upon rechallenge. Follows a known pattern of 
response to the investigational medicinal product.  
Adverse events with the causality assessed as unrelated or unlikely are categorized as not related 
to study m edication.  
Adverse events with the causality assessed as possible or probable are categorized as related to 
study medication and are called adverse drug reactions.  
All SAEs must be reported immediately (no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
event).  The investigator must complete the SAE Report Form and  notify  according to the Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form Instructions.

 13.4 Hypothesis Tests  
 
13.4.1  Primary  Hypotheses  
The primary study hypothesis (alternative hypothesis) is that Ketamine  and experimental drug 
NRX -101 (K/N) delays the time to documented relapse as compared to both lurasidone (L) and 
placebo (P) as measured by [CONTACT_350876] (h) versus the null hypothesis of no delay in time to 
relapse for either comparator treatment (Ketamine/lurasidone [K/L] and Ketamine/placebo [K/P]) 
as follows:  
• H0: h NRX -101 < h L and h P 
• Ha: h NRX -101 > h L and h P 
13.4.2  Secondary  Hypotheses  
The secondary study hypotheses relating to secondary ASIB and BPD endpoints (alternative 
hypotheses favoring K/N vs. K/L and K/P) are the following:  
1. K/N will favorably separate from both K/L and K/P by 72 hours, with sustained 
difference between groups thereaf ter. 
2. All cause discontinuation (including discontinuation for continued suicidal ideation) will 
be lower for K/N than both K/L and K/P.  
3. K/N will favorably separate from K/L and K/P starting at day 7, with sustained difference 
thereafter.   
4. Improvements wit hin the K/N group observed at Week 2 will remain stable to end of 
study.  
5. C-SSRS scores will remain <4 for 4 weeks following treatment discontinuation (i.e. any 
“crisis” will resolve within the 6 week time period with more favorable outcomes in the 
K/N gro up as compared to K/L and K/P.  
13.5 Efficacy Endpoints  
13.5.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary outcome measure will be time to relapse, defined as the need to implement a new 
treatment plan (not a dose increase, decrease, or suspension) or as a return to  a score of ≥4 on the C -
SSRS, and/or a score of 20 on the MADRS subset of the BISS 
13.5.2  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
Additionally, symptom improvement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_523308] : C-SSRS, CHRT, BISS  (MADRS) , and BPRS .  These measures will be 
assessed at the times specified on the Study Activity Schedule, Table 3. 
The C -SSRS (and the retrospective C -CASA component), CHRT (CHRT -SR and CHRT -C), BISS 
and B PRS (including the global severity rating) will be evaluated within and betw een study 
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679122] six months for the 
Baseline/Screening scale and since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale. Mean differences 
will be evaluated using a paired t -test with each study grou p and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P.  
 
13.5.3  Diagnostic Metrics  
The following metrics will be evaluated at baseline:  
• MINI 7.0. 2 
13.6 Additional Endpoints  
The following additional endpoints will be recorded and analyzed for both study phases:  
• Study dose pe r treatment group  
• All-cause discontinuation (and reason for discontinuation)  
• Suicide rates  
• Incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_523239] -related outcomes  
• Proportion of subjects who are treated with new SSRIs or have increased SSRI dosages  
• Proporti on of subjects who discontinue SSRIs or have reduced SSRI dosages.  
13.7 Safety Endpoints  
13.7.1  Overall Adverse Events  
Separate safety analyses will be performed for the two stages for the Safety population.  Safety 
endpoints will include adverse events (AE), vital si gns (VS), and relevant clinical chemistries and 
hematology parameters.  
 
The principle of treatment emergence will be employed for the analysis of AE data.  Treatment 
emergence is defined to be any event that occurred during the observation period and was n ot 
present at baseline, or one which represents an exacerbation of a condition present at baseline.   
 
Events emerging during Stage 1 will be counted during Stage 2 if not resolved by [CONTACT_523309].  Unresolved adverse event outcomes at the end of Stage 2 will be 
followed for an additional seven days or until resolution, whichever occurs earlier.  
 
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_61132].  For each study treatment, safety data will be 
collected and analyzed per stage or unt il treatment -emergent adverse events are resolved.  The 
type, incidence, timing (onset, duration), relationship, and severity of AEs will be reported for 
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679123] tests to compare K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P.   Mean changes from baseline will be displayed for each serum chemistry and hematology 
parameter as well as the shift; unpaired t -tests will be used to compare K/N vs. K/L and K/P; in 
addition, paired t -tests will be performed for the change from baseline for each study treatment 
group.     
13.7.[ADDRESS_679124] a positive response to ketamine.  Moreover, it is expected that some 
subjects in the K/L and K/P treatment groups will have recurrence of their depression and, possibly 
suicidality. The timing and incidence of adverse findings will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_523250] a designated safety monit or.  The number of such epi[INVESTIGATOR_523251] a Poisson regression model to compare study treatment groups controlling 
for C -SSRS [ADDRESS_679125] infusion (1, 2), age (<25, 25 -39, >40), and gender.  
 
Vital signs and ECGs will also be evaluated with in and between study treatment groups.  Mean 
differences in heart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, RR interval, QT, and QTcF. QTcF intervals 
will be calculated using the Fridericia formula (Puddu et al, 1988).  The overall interpretation will 
be reported a s normal or abnormal; if abnormal, then the percents clinically significant will be 
reported. Abnormal values shall not be recorded as AEs unless deemed clinically significant. 
McNemar paired comparison tests will be performed within study treatment groups  for the 
abnormal percents while Fisher Exact tests will be performed between treatment groups.  
 
While  symptom improvement will be evaluated by [CONTACT_379310] : C-SSRS, CHRT, BISS  (MADRS) , SIBQ and BPRS, safety measures in the PRISE, 
CADSS and BARS (including the global severity rating) will be evaluated within and between 
study treatment groups.  The time frame is for both lifetime and the past six months for the 
Baseline/Screening scale and since the last visit for the Since Last Visit scale. Mean differences 
will be evaluated using a paired t -test with each study group and an unpaired t -test for K/N vs. K/L 
and K/P.

 13.8 Sample Size  Calculations  
13.8.1  Allocation  
To encourage study participation, a  2:1:[ADDRESS_679126] half as many 
subjects will be assigned to the lurasidone and placebo arm s as compared to the K/N study arm.  
The goal will be to have 62 subjects randomized to K/N and 31 subjects randomized to each of 
K/L and K/P for a total of [ADDRESS_679127] of the Ketamine response rate exceeding 70%, if the Stage 1 loss rate being less 
than 8% (1 5 subjects), or if the Stage 2 loss rate being less than 8% ( 9 subjects). Thus, there would 
be 177 subjects who complete Stage 1 before considering Ketamine response.  The literature and 
prior experience suggests that 70% of those treated with ketamine will have an adequate reduction 
in depression and suicidality which equates to 1 24 Ketamine respo nders (1 77 x 0.7) who would 
be available for randomization.  More subjects will need to be enrolled if the Ketamine response 
rate was lower than 70% or the randomization refusal rate was higher than 8%, considered to be 
part of Stage 2 losses.    
13.8.3  Stage 2  
Stage 2 will investigate the study hypotheses . The primary efficacy hypothesis is that K/N will 
delay the time to relapse relative to K/L and K/P . The goal will be to have 62 subjects 
randomized to K/N and 31  subjects randomized to K/ L and K/ P. These number s are based on the 
Ketamine Responders . See Error! Refe rence source not found.  for the total number of K/N and 
K/L subjects required to test the primary efficacy hypothesis . The sample size requirements are 
shown ju st for K/N and K/L . . 
The study is powered based on the number of subjects randomized to K/N vs. K/L . In order to 
achieve 90% study power with two -sided 0.0 5 Type I error, a total of 56 K/N subjects, 28 K/L 
subjects, and 28 K/P subjects  must be evaluated f or time to relapse over the full 6 weeks . This is 
based on the assumption of a 30% relapse rate in the K/N treatment group and a 70% relapse rate 
in the K/L and K/P treatment group s. A larger gap in the relapse rate is expected based on the 
literature, so this is believed to be a conservative assumption . These calculations assume a loss of 
8% during Stage 2 .

 15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
15.1 Source Data and Records  
Source data are all the information in original records and certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_364990], observations, laboratory reports, data sheets provided by [CONTACT_162849], which are necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study. The 
investigator will permit study -related monitoring, au dit(s), IRB review(s) and regulatory 
inspection(s), with direct access to all the required source records.  
All study records will be retained for a period of time as defined by [CONTACT_523317] d.  Generally, this means at least [ADDRESS_679158] of the investigation.  In other situations (e.g., where the investigation 
is not in  support of or as part of an application for a research or marketing permit), a period of [ADDRESS_679159] the Sponsor prior 
to disposal of any records related to th is study.  
15.2 Reporting of Results  
The Case Report Form (CRF) is an integral part of the study and subsequent reports.  The CRF 
must be used to capture all study data recorded in the patient’s medical record.  The CRF must be 
kept current to reflect patient s tatus during the course of the study.  Only a patient screening and 
randomization number will be used to identify the patient.   
The monitor is responsible for performing on -site monitoring at regular intervals throughout the 
study to verify adherence to t he protocol; verify adherence to local regulations on the conduct of 
clinical research; and ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data entered in the 
CRF.  
The CRO will monitor completed Case Report Forms (CRFs).  A case report form will be provided 
for each screened patient.  
All protocol -required information collected during the study must be entered by [CONTACT_737], 
or designated representative, in the Target e*CRF , an Internet -based electronic data collection 
system.  All details of t he CRF completion and correction will be explained to the investigator.  
The management module of Target e*CRF  includes edit check and query systems that 
seamlessly integrate with the data entry system.  All modifications to the data in the eCRF are 
track ed by [CONTACT_121755] (date and identity of the person making the change are 
instantaneously recorded).  Target e*CRF  is 21CFR Part [ADDRESS_679160] be provided for all missing data, 
altered data, and/or out of range data.  
The completed case report form must be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_523318] a designated sub investigator.  
Final monitored and audited eCRFs will be provided by [CONTACT_162852] a PDF file.

managed by [CONTACT_941] [CRO/data management]  team. Subjects will be assigned study ID numbers.  
Potential risks to data confidentiality will be mitigated by [CONTACT_276188] -identification 
of all study data and by [CONTACT_276189].  All users of the EDC 
system will be tracked and provided access in a secure fashion following established Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOPs) for this process.  
As wi th all research data, information gathered by [CONTACT_379316]; it will not be released with any information that identifies research participants.  
Pharmacogenetic information, in particular, will be coded and unlinked to individual respondent 
identifiers.  The data managers, biostatistician, and study sponsor  do not have access to the 
identities of subject s. That information is retained only at the clinical sites. Uses and risks related 
to data collection will be outlined i n the informed consent and reviewed with the subjects.

 16. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
16.1 Ethics Review  
Anticipated  benefits of the research to participants and others: This study will potentially help 
individuals with BPD and acute suicidal intention . If we discover that this intervention is 
effective, these results will lead to a full clinical development program of this treatment for BPD 
and acute suicidal intention . 
Risks to subjects relative to the anticipated benefits to research participants and others: The 
treatment has been selected with consideration of safety in mind. Additionally, adequate 
protections are in place to  carefully  monitor the medical wellbeing of participants.  In contrast, 
the morbidity and mortality associated with BPD and suicidal ideation  are known to be very 
high.  
Risks to subjects in relation to the importance of the knowledge that reason ably may be expected 
to result:  The benefit to society from the development of efficacious interventions with rapid 
onset for BPD and acute suicidal ideatio n would be a substantial public health benefit.  
Vulnerable populations will not be included, except for adolescents  ages [ADDRESS_679162] not responded to available antidepressant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Both active treatment and 
placebo/control groups in each trial will receive comprehensive evaluation and careful 
monitoring. Close monitoring b y a trained psychiatrist is beneficial for individuals with mood 
disorders. If subject s are in need of more intensive psychiatric treatment at any time during the 
course of the trial, study personnel will assist in needed evaluation and referral to appropr iate 
treatment settings. Subjects will be carefully monitored regarding depressive and other 
psychiatric symptoms. Non-responders to study treatment will be offered referrals for treatment 
at the end of the trial.  
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679163] s at the 1000mg 
dose in formal studies of psychiatric illness . Therefore, the investigators will appoint a 
designated safety  monitor to surveil for any safety signals that may arise in the course of the 
study .  
Lurasidone is an FDA -approved medication which is indicated in the treatment of bipolar 
depression and is a member of a class of medications (5 -HT2A antagonists) that is  routinely used 
in treating bipolar depression . Neither lurasidone, nor any other member of this class has 
successfully demonstrated efficacy against suicidality – in fact the medication bears a warning 
about potential suicide risk . However, its efficacy a gainst bipolar depression is established .

participating in the study.  Any questions, concerns, or ambiguities will be clarified by [CONTACT_779]’s 
site investigator  or another study clinician prior to the subject  signing consent.  Subject s will sign 
informed consent and only then will begin participation in the study.  
Protocol NRX -101-[ADDRESS_679165] for 10 years.  
If the investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another investigator, IRB , sponsor ). Notic e 
of such transfer will be given in writing to sponsor .

EVALUATIONS  Prior to injections on Day 0, subjects will be assessed using the 
ALSFRS -R, the Medica l Research Council (MRC) scale  for muscle 
strength testing , dynamometry, FVC , and muscle circumferenc e.  
These tests can be conducted one day before the scheduled injection  
visit.  Immediately before injection on Day 0, the following will be 
conducted: recording of concomitant medications, vital signs, and 
blood draw for serum chemistry and hematology, se rum HGF and 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_4777]202 in whole blood .  
 
INJECTIONS  VM202 is delivered in 0.5 mL intramuscular injections of a solution 
of 0.5 mg VM202 / mL.  It will be administered over the course of 
four visits: Day 0, Day 7, Day 14, and Day 21.  As in all previous 
VM202 studies, final dose of VM202 for each target muscle group is 
divided and administered [ADDRESS_4352] will begin with the lower limb injection series 
and will be injected in accordance with the schedule outlined in  Table 
1.  The next sequentially eligible patient will begin with injection of 
the upper limbs (see  Table 2).  Subsequent e ligible patients will be 
treated in an alternating fashion, such that [ADDRESS_4353] initiated their VM202 injections in the upper limbs . Please note: 
Regardless of injection order, a ll subjects will receive the same final 
dose of VM202 and the same number of injections per muscle 
group.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder 
characterized by [CONTACT_4839].  The disease is diverse in its 
presentation, cause, and progression, but, in general, ALS presents clinically as asymmetric 
muscle weakness, wasting, spasticity, weight loss, and paralysis.  Pathologically, ALS is 
c
haracterized by [CONTACT_4840][INVESTIGATOR_1831], 
brainstem, and cerebral cortex.  Death usually occurs within 2–[ADDRESS_4369]

DA for the treatment of this disease is a glutamate release inhibitor (Rilutek, generic:

events.  Its effect is both minimal and controversial.[ADDRESS_4371] been proposed and investigated.  They

Astrocytes contribut

aberrant protein folding.  Aberrant proteins can form aggregates, leading to 
pr

m
itochondrial impairment and dysregulation of calcium handling trigger autophagy

nd the apoptotic cascade.  11,12  The process is ‗c ontagious‘ and self-perpetuating, 
affecting the dynamics of cell death in neighboring cells due to release of 
interleukin-1 , TNF-, and free radicals.13  Figure 1 depi[INVESTIGATOR_4780].

de
generation, the end result in ALS is motor neuron death.  The major executioners 
in t
he apoptotic process are proteases known as caspases (cysteine-dependent, 
a
spartate-specific proteases).  Caspases directly and indirectly orchestrate the 
morpholog
ic changes of the cell during apoptosis.   The y exist as latent precursors, 
which, when activated, initiate the death program by [CONTACT_4842].   
 
The first evidence of the role of caspases in a neurodegenerative disease came from 
e
xperiments in which the ― ALS mouse ‖ (SODG93A) was cross-bred with a mouse 
e
xpressing a mutant caspase 1 gene that inhibited caspase 1 in neurons.  Mice 
expressing the mutant SOD1 transgene and the mutant caspase 1 transgene survived 
9% long
er, and disease progression was slowed by [CONTACT_726] 50 percent.14 Caspase 
inhi
bition in the same model was found to be neuroprotective and extended survival 
by 22%.15   
 
The
 clinical relevance of these studies is supported by [CONTACT_4843].  
Ea
rly activation of caspase-1 in ALS contributes significantly to toxicity.16  However, 
neuronal death only occurs following upregulation and concomitant expression of

1.2. CURRENT TREATMENT O PTIONS  
Rilutek, (originally manufactured by [CONTACT_4844] 12, 1995 (NDA 020599)), is now off-patent and available in the 
generic form of riluzole.  Rilutek was approved on the basis of two controlled trials 
in which the time to tracheostomy or death was longer for patients randomized to 
Rilutek than for those randomized to placebo.  These studies admitted patients with 
e
ither familial or sporadic ALS, disease duration of less than 5 years, and a baseline 
forced vital capacity greater than or equal to 60%.  In one study, performed in 
[LOCATION_009] and Belgium, [ADDRESS_4374] 13 months 
(maximum duration 18 months) after being randomized to either 100 mg/day (given 
50 mg BID) of Rilutek or placebo.  The second study was conducted in both Europe 
a
nd North America.  [ADDRESS_4375] 1 year (North 
Ame
rican centers) and up to 18 months (European centers) after being randomized 
to either 50, 100, 200 mg/day of Rilutek or placebo.  The studies concluded that 
R
ilutek extends early survival and / or time to tracheostomy, but there was no 
statis
tically significant difference in mortality at the end of the studies. 
 
 
1.3. UNMET CLINICAL NEED 
Riluzole does not prevent or correct the underlying causes of ALS.  It has not been 
shown to improve muscle strength or neurological function.  Clearly, a therapy that 
could impede or reverse neurodegeneration is needed for patients with ALS. 
 
 
1.4. HGF  FOR THE TREATMENT OF AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS  
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multi-functional mesenchyme-derived cytokine.  
It is a recognized potent angiogenic growth factor and anti-apoptosis agent , 
sti
mulating the growth of endothelial cells and the migration of vascular smooth 
muscle
 cells.19-22  HGF stimulates DNA, RNA and protein synthesis by [CONTACT_4845] 
c
ells in a dose-dependent manner, upregulates vascular endothelial growth factor 
(
VEGF) expression, and exhibits greater mitogenic activity than that of VEGF alone 
in hum
an aortic endothelial cells in vitro .21,23-25   
 
Although largely thought of as an angiogenic agent, HGF has been recently 
identifie
d as a neurotrophic factor.26-32  HGF  and its cognate receptor (the c-Met 
re
ceptor ) are expressed in the peripheral nervous system as well as in various regions 
of
 the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831].  W. Sun,  et al.  (2002) found that local sustained HGF 
production in neural tissue in SODG93A mice (transgenic ALS model) alleviated the 
s
ymptoms of A
LS by [CONTACT_4846] r neurons and indirect 
activities on glial cells.33  It suppresses microgliosis and astrocytosis, which 
c
ontribute to motor neuron degeneration by [CONTACT_4847].33-36    
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page 19 of 101  
Early in the disease, surviving nerve fibers establish connections and reinnervate 
motor units (muscle groups) that have lost their connection to axons that have died.  
As a result, larger motor units are formed.  HGF  may be able to slow disease 
progress by [CONTACT_4848].  It has been demonstrated that HGF can 
pr
omote neurogenesis, angiogenesis, and synaptogenesis and that it can inhibit 
fibr
otic changes in  ischemic regions better than glial cell line-derived neurotrophic 
fa
ctor (GDNF).[ADDRESS_4376] excitotoxic injuries, because it has 
be
en shown to attenuate axonal degeneration by [CONTACT_4849]-excitation 
(e
xcitotoxicity) through modulation of the expression of the scaffolding protein of 
the NMDA receptor at the synapse.[ADDRESS_4377] off cell death and halt the cascade of neighboring cell 
damage by [CONTACT_4850].38,39  In ALS patients, chronic, sublethal 
activation of caspase appears to mediate cell dysfunction, which precedes cell 
death.15,16  Cell dysfunction of substantial magnitude, occurring before cell death, 
mi
ght result in symptomatic disease.  Given that caspases may be active in 
indi
vidual neurons for a long period (potentially weeks to months), inhibition of 
caspase in these circumstances could reduce cell dysfunction and delay cell death.[ADDRESS_4378] in part, promoted by [CONTACT_4851]-mediated cell death signals.

The challenge associated with delivering a targeted sustained dose of exogenous 
HGF is in overcoming the instability of HGF in blood circulation and its rapid 
c
learance by [CONTACT_4852]; HGF has an in vivo half-life of less than [ADDRESS_4379] that it is associated with limited persistence and no propensity for genomic 
integration, (particularly in skeletal muscle tissue) makes it an attractive option for 
local targeted delivery.

Safety of VM202.   The use of plasmids for targeted delivery of angiogenic factors 
int
o muscle tissue is a particularly attractive and a relatively safe therapeutic 
approach, because plasmids have been shown to effectively transfect postmitotic 
cells such as skeletal and heart muscle and to successfully express angiogenic genes 
with very little dissemination and persistence at distant sites.  Following 
intramuscular injection, the plasmid that persists is extrachromosomal and 
integration into host DNA, if it occurs, is negligible.43-[ADDRESS_4380] of 
c
onventionally injected naked plasmid DNA is well known.46,47

HGF locally at the site of injection may help support nerve health, regeneration and 
to forestall motor neuron die-off.  
 
 
1.6. PRECLINICAL DATA 
The non-clinical safety of VM202 has been evaluated for general toxicity following 
single intramuscular and intravenous doses in rats.  In addition, the general toxicity 
of VM202 following multiple intermittent (weekly or monthly) intramuscular doses 
has been evaluated in rabbits and rats, respectively.  The potential for genomic 
integration at the injection site as well as the potential for distribution to and 
persistence of VM202 in reproductive tissues was evaluated in rats. The ability of 
VM202 to induce humoral immune responses was evaluated following intramuscular 
administration with or without adjuvant in mice.  All species utilized for these 
studies (mouse, rat, and rabbit) were shown in in vivo  experiments to be able to 
e
xpress the plasmid following intramuscular injection.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
Therefore, the nonclinical efficacy and safety studies support the clinical 
investigation of VM202 in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.   
 
 
1.7. CLINICAL DATA 
VM202 was/is being evaluated in four clinical trials.  
 
1.7.1.  PHASE I STUDY IN CRITICAL LIMB ISCHEMIA

Median ABI and TBI significantly increased from 0.35 to 0.52 ( P=0.005) and 0.15 
to 0.24 ( P=0.01) at 12 months follow-up.  TCPO 2 showed an improvement trend 
(

with m
edian VAS decreasing from 58 to 16 ( P=0.03) at 6 months follow-up. VAS 
sc
ore reduction tracked well with the hemodynamic data.   
 
In general, there was more improvement over baseline in Cohort II (4 mg VM202) 
than in any other cohort.  Cohort I (2 mg of VM202) also experienced a significant 
reduction in pain and modest improvement in hemodynamic measurement.

1.8. STUDY AND DOSE RATIONALE  
The natural history of ALS is characterized by [CONTACT_4854].  Deterioration rates and patterns vary, with death occurrin g as 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_4782] 1–[ADDRESS_4384], but regardless of the order in which 
muscle wasting occurs, the disease is progressive , se lf-perpetuating, and ultimately 
results in significant atrophy and weakness in all limbs.  We therefore propose 
tre
ating both upper and lower limbs.   
 
The proposed final (cumulative) dose to be administered to each subject is 64 mg 
VM202.  A dosi ng schedule similar to the one used in the phase I and the phase II 
DPN studies will be used in this study.  Namely, intramuscular injections for each 
tar
get muscle group will be divided into two injection visits, (equal halves), two 
we
eks apart.  As in all four prior studies, VM202 will be delivered in a solution of 
0.5 mg
 VM202 / mL.  The proposed dose is well within that  supported by [CONTACT_4855]202.  Safety studies in rabbit, 
ra
t and mouse models demonstrate that doses of up to approximately 12.8 times the 
c
umulative clinical dose proposed in this study are safe and resulted in no toxicities.  
The
 dose to each muscle group (VM202 is only active once transfected into skeletal 
muscle cells) falls within the doses given in the four other clinical studies.  The 
excellent safety profile of VM202 seen thus far in the phase I and phase II CLI 
studies, the phase I/II study in patients with DPN, and from the ongoing phase II 
DPN study supports this dosing scheme. 
 
 
 
 
2. GO OD CLINICAL PRACTICES (GCP)  STATEMENT  
This trial will be conducted in compliance with all applicable federal regulations pertaining 
to investigational drugs and devices including but not limited to: [ADDRESS_4385] (IRB) and the Institutional 
Biosafety Committee (IBC) at the study site.  Any deviations from the protocol that may

[IP_ADDRESS].  MEDICATION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH VM202 BIOACTIVITY  
COX-1 and COX-2 inhibiting drugs may interfere with the bioactivity of VM202, 
and are therefore prohibited from use during the study.  Other than the maximal 81 
mg daily dose of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] (acetylsalicylic acid), subjects must agree to not take any of 
these
 drugs until completion of the 9 month follow-up visit.  The patient needs to be 
advised that common over the counter medications that are prohibited include: Bayer 
(>
 81mg), Excedrin, Aleve, Advil (motrin, ibuprofen).  A mor e complete list of the 
excluded medications, including the washout period, can be found in Appendix 3. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]. SCREE N FAILURES  
Subjects not meeting all study entry criteria will be designated as a screen failures.  
End of study procedures will not be performed for these subjects, but their reason for 
discontinuation will be recorded on Screening Log.  Screen failures will be replaced. 
 
3.4.5.  TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION  
After providing written informed consent, potential study participants will undergo 
Screening assessments.  The site will complete a Treatment Authorization Form 
(TAF) for subjects determined to be eligible for study participation.  The TAF

3.5. STUDY COMPLETION  
 
3.5.1.  COMPLETED SUBJECTS  
Each subject in the study will undergo formal clinical assessments throughout the [ADDRESS_4401] from the study at any time if (s)he 
c
onsiders that remaining in the study compromises the subject‘s health or the subject 
is not sufficiently cooperative. In either event, reason(s) for discontinuation should 
be recorded on the CRF. 
 
Possible reasons for study discontinuation include the following: 
 
• Adverse events (A Es) necessitating discontinuation from the study (pre-treatment) 
• The subject is lost to follow-up 
• Subject decision 
• Investigator decision 
• Other reason 
 
The
 reasons for any subject discontinuation will be specified and recorded on the 
stud
y completion form of the CRF.  Additional subjects may be enrolled if subjects 
discontinue prior to the 90 day visit. 
 
Subjects discontinued for AE(s) will be followed-up after subject‘s discontinuation 
until the event is resolved or considered medically stable by [CONTACT_737].   
 
S
ubjects that withdraw prior to study completion will undergo the following 
assessments if possible: 
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page [ADDRESS_4402] do his/her best to contact 
[CONTACT_1560] (by [CONTACT_4857]) at least twice.  If no response is obtained from the 
subj
ect, the Investigator is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_4858]‘s relatives or 
his/
her general practitioner.  Documentation of these contacts must be recorded in 
the 
subject medical chart.  It can be, for instance, the acknowledgement of receipt of 
a
 letter sent to the subject.   
 
3.5.3. PRE MATURE STUDY TERMINATION  
The Sponsor reserves the right to discontinue the study for any safety, ethical or 
administrative reason at any time. 
 
 
 
3.6. INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG PRODUCT AND ACCOUNTABILITY  
 
3.6.1.  INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG PRODUCT  
VM202 is a DNA plasmid which contains a novel genomic cDNA hybrid human 
hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) coding sequence (HGF-X7) expressing two 
isoforms of HGF, HGF 728 and HGF 723.  The  key feature of HGF-X7 is that it was 
designed by [CONTACT_4859] a series of intron sequences into certain sites of HGF cDNA so 
that both isoforms of HGF protein are expressed simultaneously and efficiently as in 
the human genome.  Because there is no change in the coding region of the HGF 
g
ene, HGF proteins generated from VM202 are identical to the wild-type human 
HGF proteins.   
 
The plasmid has 7,377 base pairs, a HCMV enhancer / promoter, a growth hormone 
polyadenylation terminator sequence, ColEl originator, and the Kanamycin 
resistance gene, on a pCK backbone.   
 
VM202 is supplied in a sterile glass vial containing 2.[ADDRESS_4403], or a duly 
designated person.  Since VM202 does not contain preservatives, opened vials of 
VM202 a
nd VM202 reconstituted with water for injection (WFI) must be used 
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page [ADDRESS_4404] ACCOUNTABILITY  
In accordance with federal regulations (21CFR 312.62), all Investigators are required 
to keep accurate records showing final disposition of all investigational drugs.   
 
Investigational drugs are to be used only in accordance with this protocol and under 
supervision of the Study Pharmacist or a duly designated person.  The Study 
P
harmacist or his/her designee will maintain an accurate record of the receipt of the 
test drug
 as shipped by [CONTACT_1034] / Designee, including the date received.  In 
a
ddition, an accurate drug disposition record will be kept, specifying the amount 
dispensed to each subject and the date of dispensation.  This inventory record must 
be
 available for inspection at any time.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_4785]. 
 
Af
ter the study is completed, the Study Pharmacist must account for all drug used, 
unuse
d and partially used.  Unused study medication from the study site will be 
returned to the Sponsor / Designee as directed in writing by [CONTACT_4860]. 
 
3.6.3. DO SE AND ADMINISTRATION  
VM202 is supplied in a sterile glass vial containing 2.[ADDRESS_4405].  Before administration, it will be reconstituted with 5 mL of water for 
inj
ection (WFI) by [CONTACT_4861] a final VM202 concentration of 0.5 mg / 
mL.  Each reconstituted vial is only to be used for one subject.  A complete 
de
scription of test article administration can be found in Appendix 4 . 
 
 
 
3.7. PRIOR AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATION  
All concomitant medications (taken within [ADDRESS_4406] injection) will be 
recorded on the CRF at each study visit.  For each medication taken, the following 
information will be collected: 
 
 Medic ation trade name; 
 Indication for which the medication was given; 
 Dose/strength, route, and frequency of administration; 
 Date started and date stopped (or continuation at study exit).

4.2.7. RE VISED AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS FUNCTIONAL RATING 
SCALE (ALSFRS -R) 
The revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) is 
a validated rating scale for measuring the global function of patients with ALS.52  It 

 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page 43 of 101 provides a health professional-generated estimate of the patient‘s degree of 
functional impairment, which can be evaluated serially to objectively assess any 
response to treatment or progression of disease.  The ALSFRS-R includes twelve 
que
stions that ask the physician to rate his/her impression of the patient‘s level of 
functional impairment in performing one of twelve common tasks, e .g. climbing 
stairs.  Each task is rated on a five-point scale from 0 = can't do, to 4 = normal ability. 
I
ndividual item scores are summed to produce a reported score of between 0=worst 
and 48=best.   The ALSFRS-R will be conducted at Screening, on Day 0 before the 
tre
atment (injection), on Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months.  Details 
c
an be found in Appendix 5.   
 
4.2.8. ME DICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (MRC)  SCALE FOR MUSCLE STRENGTH 
TESTING 
The Medical Research Council (MRC) Scale is a validated instrument used in 
assessing muscle strength.  It uses the numeral grades 0 – 5 to characterize muscle 
strength as follows: 
 
[ADDRESS_4410] gravity and resistance 
5 - Normal power  
 
The
 MRC scale will be used to assess muscle strength in the muscle groups injected 
with VM202.  This
 assessment will be conducted on Day 0 before the treatment 
(inje
ction), on Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, at 6 months and 9 months.  The muscle 
g
roups to be evaluated and the methods of evaluation can be found in Appendix 6. 
 
4.2.9. MUSCL E CIRCUMFERENCE  
The muscle circumference of the following groups of muscles will be assessed on

Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page 44 of 101 Finger pi[INVESTIGATOR_4790], grip strength, and lower leg extension will be measured using 
non-AC powered dynamometers manufactured by [CONTACT_4865], Inc.  
Data will be collected on the Data Collection Software Package that works with all 
the Hoggan FET dynamometers.  These measurements will be performed on Day 0 
be
fore the treatment (injection), Day 60, Day 90, [ADDRESS_4411] injection, Day 
30, and Day 60.  Any adverse reaction should be reported as an AE. 
 
 
 
5. EVALUATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
5.1. DEFINITIONS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is the development of an untoward medical occurrence or 
the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition following or during exposure to 
an investigational product, whether or not considered causally related to the product.   
 
An untoward medical condition can be symptoms ( e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs 
(e
.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or clinically significant abnormal results of an 
investi
gation ( e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). 
 
Conditions or diseases that are chronic but stable should not be recorded on AE 
pages of the CRF.  In addition, changes in a chronic condition or disease that are 
consistent with natural disease progression are NOT considered AEs and also should 
not be recorded on AE pages of the CRF.  These medical conditions should be 
adequately documented on the appropriate page of the CRF (medical history and/or 
physical examination).  
 
An adverse reaction  means any adverse event caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions 
a
re a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event. 
 
Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a 
re
asonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event.  For the purposes of 
IND safety reporting, ‗ reasonable possibility‘ means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse 
reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, 
which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence which: 
 Results in death; 
 Is life-threatening; 
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page 45 of 101  R equires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (admission to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4791] a stay > 24 hours) 
or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (note, elective procedures requiring 
hospi
[INVESTIGATOR_4792] a SAE); 
 Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a 
bod
y structure; or 
 R equires medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a 
body function or permanent damage to a body structure. 
 
Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-
threatening or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4793]
s listed above.  Examples of such medical events include: allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4794].  Medical and scientific judgment 
must be exercised when classifying events as serious. 
 
Life-threatening  means that the subject is, in the view of the Investigator, at 
im
mediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred.  It does not include an AE which, 
had it occurred in a more serious form, might have caused death.   
 
Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  means that the event resulted in 
pe
rmanent or significant and substantial disruption of the subjects‘ ability to carry 
out normal life functions.   
 
An unexpected AE  is an AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with 
the applicable product information ( e.g., Investigator Brochure for an unapproved 
pr
oduct).  Expected means that the event has been previously observed with the test 
article and is identified and/or described in the applicable product information.  It 
does not mean that the event is expected with the underlying disease(s) or 
c
oncomitant medications.  It is expected that certain disease states will have 
reoccurring adverse events some of which may be considered expected over time. 
 
 
5.2. ASSESSMENT OF AES 
All AEs experienced by [CONTACT_4866], regardless of severity, which occur between 
the first study drug administration and the [ADDRESS_4412] 
be recorded on the AE form provided with the CRF.  This will include the following 
infor
mation: 
 
 De scription of the AE 
 Date of onset

All AEs and SAEs must be followed until resolution, or the condition stabilizes.  The 
I
nvestigator is responsible to ensure that follow-up includes any supplemental 
investigations as may be indicated to elucidate as completely as possible the nature 
and/or causality of the AE or SAE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or 
investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care 
professionals.  The Sponsor or its designee may request that the Investigator perform 
or
 arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations. 
 
5.2.1. AE CA[LOCATION_003]L ITY 
The study Investigator will determine whether an AE is related or unrelated to study 
medication, the procedure (intramuscular injection) and / or the underlying disease 
using the following criteria: 
 
Not related:  An adverse event that is not related to the use of the test article or 
a
dministration procedure.   
 
Possibly related: An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure. An alternative explanation, e.g., concomitant study 
pr
oduct(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, a causal relationship cannot be excluded.   
 
Probably related: An adverse event that might be due to the use of the test article or 
administration procedure. The relationship in time is suggestive. An alternative 
explanation is less likely, e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). 
 
De
finitely related : An AE that is due to the use of the test article or administration 
procedure. The event cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867] – 
e
.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s).  
 
5.2.2. AE INT ENSITY  
The intensity of the AE/SAE will be defined by [CONTACT_4868]:  
 
Mild: The AE is noticeable to the subject but does not interfere with 
routine activity. 
Moderate: The AE is discomforting and interferes with routine activity. 
Severe: The AE significantly limits the subject‘s ability to perform 
routine activities despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795]. 
 
 
5.3. REPORTING /RECORDING OF AES 
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made by [CONTACT_4869].  The first concern will be the safety of the subject, and 
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page [ADDRESS_4413] intramuscular injection procedure (Day 0) 
unti
l the 9 month follow-up visit.  Any AE should be recorded on the appropriate 
C
RF page(s). 
 
 
5.4. REPORTING / RECORDING OF SAE S 
 
5.4.1.  INVESTIGATOR ’S RESPONSIBILITY  
SAEs will be recorded following the first study drug administration through the [ADDRESS_4414] be reported immediately (within 72 hours) 
to t
he Sponsor and MedTech Consultants, Inc., the designated CRO.   
 
Each SAE must be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved or 
assessed as chronic or stable regardless of whether or not, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], the event is thought to be related to the study medication.   
 
The
 Investigator will be required to provide complete information concerning each 
SAE to the CRO and Sponsor within [ADDRESS_4415]‘s medical record and then transcribed onto the SAE 
FAX Form.  The completed SAE Form (including the Investigator‘s opi[INVESTIGATOR_4796]), copi[INVESTIGATOR_4797]/reports, 
consultant report(s), and other relevant information will be faxed and/or mailed to 
the CRO. 
 
In the event of an SAE leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], every effort will be made by [CONTACT_4870], including a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4798].  In the event of a fatal AE, documentation of any available postmorte m 
findings, including autopsy, will be provided to the Sponsor or their designee.  In 
a
ny event, the Investigator will provide a narrative summary of circumstances, 
events related to the death, and cause of death, if known.  Any follow-up information 
obtained must be recorded on an SAE follow-up report form. 
 
The
 Investigator must comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements 
related to the reporting of SAEs to regulatory authorities and the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB), and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) if applicable.  
Upon r
eceipt from the Sponsor of an initial or follow-up IND Safety Report or other 
safety information, the Investigator must promptly notify his or her IRB, and IBC (if 
a
pplicable). 
 
5.4.2. SP ONSOR ’S RESPONSIBILITY  
All AEs and SAEs will be reported on an annual basis to FDA in accordance with 
the IND regulation (21 CFR Part 312).  Per the 2010 FDA Guidance Document for 
Industry and Investigators ―Sa fety Reporting Requirements for INDs and BA/BE 
Studies,‖ events categorized as ‗possibl y‘ or ‗pr obably‘ related will be treated as 
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page 48 of 101 ‗suspe cted adverse reactions.‘  Events categorized as ‗de finitely‘ related will be 
treated as an ‗a dverse reaction.‘ 
 
All serious, unexpected adverse reactions and suspected adverse reactions will be 
reported to FDA and to all participating Investigators as an IND Safety Report 
within 15 calendar days of the event after the sponsor determines that the suspected 
a
dverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR §312.32).  Any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening AEs will be reported to the Agency within 7 calendar days after the 
sponsor‘s initial receipt of the information. 
 
The Sponsor will notify all participating Investigators of any new safety information 
that a
lters the current risk-benefit assessment of the study medication or that would 
be sufficient to consider changes in VM202 administration or in the overall conduct 
of the trial. 
 
 
 
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODS  
The objective of this Phase I/II study is to evaluate the safety of IM administration of 
VM202 in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.   Sample size estimations were not 
based on formal statistical hypotheses testing due to the exploratory nature of this Phase 
I/II study.  Hypothesis testing will not be performed on any endpoint. 
 
6.1. PATIENT CATEGORIZATION  
Screen Failure  - Any patient who was consented and entered into the screening 
process appropriately, but subsequently did not meet the entry criteria in order to be 
treated.  Patients who fail screening will not be followed for safety or efficacy 
assessment, and no other study procedures will be performed. 
 
Evaluable Patient  - Any patient who received the study drug. 
 
Lost to follow- up - A patient deemed to be lost to follow-up is any patient who 
re
ceived treatment, but who does not complete scheduled study visits to [ADDRESS_4416] the patient are deemed unsuccessful. 
 
 
6.2. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
The primary study endpoint is to evaluate safety and tolerability of intramuscular 
injections of VM202 at different injection sites in subjects with ALS.  Secondary 
e
ndpoints include the assessment of the potential of VM202 to reduce 
neurodegeneration and muscle wasting as determined by [CONTACT_4871]-R, muscle 
strength (MRC scale), muscle circumference measurements and dynamometry.  FVC 
will also be tracked and trended. 
 
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page 49 of 101 6.2.1.  SAFETY  
Any patient who receives VM202 will be included in the safety analysis population.  
Adverse events, serious adverse events, and adverse events leading to treatment 
discontinuation will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  Categorical 
variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_4872]. Continuous variables will be summarized using n, mean, SD, median, 
minimum, and maximum values.  No statistical testing will be performed. 
 
6.2.2. PH ARMACOKINETICS & PHARMACODYNAMICS  
HGF serum levels will be determined immediately pre-treatment on Day 0, 
immediately pre-treatment on Day 7 , immediately pre-treatment on Day 14, 
immediately pre-treatment on Day 21, on Day 30, Day 60, and Day 90.  The number 
of
 copi[INVESTIGATOR_4777]202 in whole blood will be determined at Day 0 (pre-injection, and 2 
hours [± 1 hour] post last injection), at Day 7 (pre-injection, and 2 hours [± 1 hour] 
post
 last injection), at Day 14 (pre-injection, and 2 hours [± 1 hour] post last 
inj
ection), at Day 21 (pre-injection, and 2 hours [± 1 hour] post last injection), on 
Da
y 30, Day 60, and Day 90. 
 
6.2.3. EF FICACY  
This is a phase I /II study, not powered to detect differences in efficacy measures.  
However, descriptive statistics of clinically meaningful endpoints will be tabulated.  
The potential of VM202 to reduce neurodegeneration and muscle wasting will be 
characterized using the ALSFRS-R, muscle strength (MRC scale), muscle 
c
ircumference measurements and dynamometry.  FVC will also be tracked and 
trended.  Survival will also be recorded. 
 
 
 
 
7. ACCES S TO STUDY DOCUMENTS AND STUDY MONITORING  
The Sponsor has designated MedTech Consultants to monitor the progress of this study.  
The clinical monitor, as a representative of the Sponsor, has the obligation to follow this 
study closely.  In addition to conducting a site visit prior to initiation of enrollment, the 
clinical monitor will visit the study facilities regularly, and utilize telephone and written 
communications on an ongoing basis to maintain current knowledge of the study.   
 
During periodic visits to the study site, the monitor will review the source documents used 
in the preparation of the CRFs to verify the accuracy and completeness of the information 
contained in those reports in preparation for retrieval.  All source documents must contain 
all information required by [CONTACT_4873].  All data generated during this study and the source 
documents from which they originated are subject to inspection by [CONTACT_4874]
s, the FDA and other regulatory agencies. 
 
Upon completion of the study, the clinical monitor will conduct a final visit (close-out) to 
the site.  The objectives of this visit are to ascertain that all regulatory records and reports 
 
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page [ADDRESS_4417] been accounted for and ensure 
that the Investigator is aware of his/her responsibilities post-study. 
 
 
 
8. QUALI TY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE  
The Sponsor employees and/or their contracted representatives utilize Standard Operating 
Procedures (SOP) designed to ensure that research procedures and documentation are 
consistently conducted/prepared to the highest quality standards.  These SOPs also require 
compliance with Health Authority regulations and Good Clinical Practice guidance. 
 
A Quality Assurance audit may be conducted by [CONTACT_4875] a study.  The Investigator will be given adequate notice if 
he/she is selected for an audit.  The audit will include, but is not limited to, a review of all 
informed consent forms, a review of CRFs, associated source documents and medical 
records, a review of regulatory documentation, an assessment of study conduct and 
protocol compliance, and a review of the investigational drug accountability.  At the 
conclusion of an audit, the auditor will conduct a brief meeting with the Investigator to 
review the findings of the audit. 
 
 
 
9. INST ITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB)

  Page [ADDRESS_4436] to take part? 
Taking part in this study is entirely voluntary, and you may refuse to participate or withdraw 
from the study at any time without influencing your regular medical treatment and without 
giving a reason.  A decision to withdraw at any time, or a decision not to take part, will not affect 
the standard of care you receive.  Regardless of your decision, you will still be treated for your 
medical condition.   
 
 
Why is this research study being done? 
You are being considered for participation in this research study because you have been 
diag
nosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  The specific events that result in ALS are 
not we
ll understood, but all ALS patients experience damage to the ne rve cells in the brain and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_4807] (motor neurons).  For 
unknown r
easons, in ALS, these motor neurons stop working.  The muscles the motor neuron 
c
ontrol no longer function, and they gradually become paralyzed.   
 
S
upporting motor neuron health and function may slow down the degenerative processes in ALS.  
R
esearchers have discovered that a protein called hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that your body 
naturally produces in small amounts can protect nerves.  Unfortunately, your body only makes a 
small amount of this protein and not always in the areas where you need it.  Researchers have 
found a way to increase the amount of HGF in your limbs.  They have isolated the genes 
responsible for directing the production of HGF, and have designed a product that can be 
injected into your muscles. 
 
I
n this research study, the HGF gene will be injected into the muscles of your arms, hands, and 
leg
s to evaluate if it affects your ALS symptoms and disease progression.  The product being 
used 
in this study is called VM202.  VM202 is an experimental drug that is not yet approved by 
[CONTACT_4896] (the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).  VM202 is a plasmid (a 
small pi[INVESTIGATOR_4808]), which includes the genes for HGF.  VM202 has been used in two small 
stud
ies in the [LOCATION_002] in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy (another neural 
de
generative disease); in two small studies in patients with critical limb ischemia, and in a study 
in Korea in patients with coronary artery disease.  VM202 has also been tested in people 
unde
rgoing coronary by[CONTACT_4897].  It is hoped that VM202 injected into your muscles will 
slow down the
 progression of your ALS symptoms.   
 
 
Wh
o is in charge of this study? 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_4809] A. Kessler, M.D.  This study is sponsored and funded by [CONTACT_4898]., Ltd.  VM BioPharma Co., Ltd. will use a specialized research company, called a 
contract research organization, in addition to specialized laboratories to manage and execute 
some parts of the detailed requirements of the study.

  Page 66 of 101 How many people will take part in this research study? 
A total of 18 patients will take part in this study at Northwestern University.   
 
 
What happens if I agree
 to be in this research study? 
After you sign this consent form indicating you want to participate in this study, you will need to 
undergo some tests to see if you qualify for the study.  If you do not meet all of the study entry 
c
riteria, you will not be able to participate in the study and your doctor will discuss with you 
other options that you may have for treatment of your medical condition.  The study doctor will 
tell you whether you are able to participate in this study after the initial test results are received 
and reviewed.   
 
This study is an open label clinical study.  All patients will receive the same final dose of 
VM202 (
64 mg).  VM202 is delivered by [CONTACT_4899].  
I
ndividual injections contain 0.5 ml of fluid with 0.25 mg VM202.  This is about one tenth of a 
tea
spoon of fluid per injection.   
 
You will receive VM202 injections four times (every 7 days) after you qualify for the study.  
Each week, you will alternate between receiving injections in the arms and hands or injections in 
the legs.  In this way, your arms will be treated twice with VM202 and your legs will be treated 
twice with VM202.   
 
The first eligible patient will begin the injection series with injections in the legs.  The next 
e
ligible patient will receive initial injections in the arms and subsequently eligible patients will 
alternate between initiating treatment in the arms or legs.  Depending when you qualify, the 
injections will start in your arms and hands OR in your legs. 
 
W
hen receiving injections in the arms, you will get 26 injections of VM202 distributed over each 
a
rm (upper arm, forearm, and hand) for a total of 52 injections (right arm/hand and left 
a
rm/hand).  When receiving injections in the legs, you will get [ADDRESS_4437]
ributed over each leg (thigh and calf) for a total of 76 injections (right leg and left leg).   
 
All patients wil
l receive the same final dose of VM202 (64 mg) and the same number of 
injections in the arms and legs. 
 
What tests, procedures, and diagnostic studies will be done during this study?  
There are 10 visits which span 9 months total time from visit #2 to visit #9.  Depending on the 
visi
t, different tests will be done.  Visit #[ADDRESS_4438] injection procedure (Visit #2).  Below is a detailed description of each of 
the required visits and the laboratory tests, procedures, and evaluations that will be done during

  Page 67 of 101 Description of the tests, procedures, and diagnostic studies to be done  
 
Medical history – Discussion with your doctor of your medical history, including ALS family 
hist
ory, current symptoms and any changes that have happened.   
 
P
hysical exam – Your  doctor will give you a physical exam and will check your reflexes, 
strength, balance, and coordination.  This exam will also include taking your sitting blood 
pressure, temperature, heart rate, height and weight ( vital si gns).   
 
Medication Review – Discussion with your doctor of what medications and dietary supplements 
y
ou have taken or are currently taking.  Please note, some medications may not be taken during 
the stud
y since they may interfere with the potential effect of the study medication or ability to 
assess the response to the study medication.  The doctor will talk to you about these medications; 
if you are currently taken any of these medications, you will be asked to stop taking these 
medications for the duration of the study.      
 
Assessment of ALS – Assessment by [CONTACT_4900]. 
 
In
jection site reaction assessment – Assessment by [CONTACT_4901]202 was injected. 
 
Assessment of side effects – Assessment by [CONTACT_4902], 
side e
ffects, or discomforts that may have happened to you.   
 
Questionnaire – You and your doctor will fill out a short que stionnaire about your ALS 
symptoms during the screening process and right before the first injections.  This questionnaire, 
(
ALS Functional Rating Scale [ALSFRS-R] ), asks about your ability to function in certain daily 
a
ctivities.  You will be asked to complete this questionnaire again at some visits. 
 
F
orced Vital Capacity (FVC) – To test how well your lungs are working, we will measure the 
g
reatest amount of air you can exhale (breath out) following a deep breath. For this test, we will 
ask you to hold a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_4810], breathe in deeply, and breathe out slowly for as 
long as you can.  
 
Muscle Strength – The strength in your arms and legs will be evaluated by [CONTACT_4903] 
a
 scoring method (Medical Research Council [MRC] scale).  The scale ranges from ‗0‘  (No 
c
ontraction) to ‗ 5‘ (Normal power).  Muscle strength and range of motion will also be measured 
using a small device called a hand-held dynamometer.  The evaluator will hold the device in his 
or
 her hand and will push against your arms and legs while you try to hold against this pushing.  
This t
esting will take approximately [ADDRESS_4439] INFORMATION SHEET / INFORMED CONSENT FORM

12 Lead EKG –  An electrocardiogram (EKG) is a measurement of your heart‘s electrical 
activity that is traced and sent to a machine, which can be read by [CONTACT_4904].  This procedure is 
not painful and involves lying as still as possible for a few minutes with sticky pads (electrodes) 
on your chest, arms and legs which are connected through wires to the EKG machine.  This test 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_4811] 15 to 20 minutes. 
 
Blood tests – Routine blood tests will be done at certain visits.  Laboratory tests will also include

g for VM202 and HGF  levels in the blood at certain visits.  The screening evaluation 
labor
atory tests will include viral tests for various diseases including HIV  (the AIDS virus), 
HTLV (human T-cell lymphotropic virus), hepatitis B ( HBV ), and hepatiti s C ( HCV).  
 
Following is a list of each visit and the specific tests that will be done. 
 
Visi
t # 1: Screening/Baseline Evaluations 
Screening is a process of evaluating your initial health status and assessing the status of your 
ALS.  Screening is usually completed within one month before the first study injections if you 
qualify for this study.  If you agree to take part in this research study, you will first sign this 
consent form, and then undergo screening.  Screening will involve the following procedures:  
medical history, physical exam, vital signs, medication review, determination of how well your 
lungs are working, determination of your ALS status (completion of questionnaire), blood tests 
including
 a viral screen; urine pregnancy test (if you are a female of childbearing age), and the 
12 lead EKG. 
 
Please note:  If any of your viral test results are positive you may need to have a second test to 
make sure the results are the same.  The doctor or his/her nurse will tell you how to find medical 
help and counseling as needed, and you will not be able to take part in this study.  The study 
Sponsor will not pay for the cost of the repeat tests, or any other follow-up medical care, or 
counseling for a positive or abnormal test result.   
 
It takes approximately one to two weeks to get all of the initial test results.  After your doctor has 
reviewed the results of these tests he/she will determine whether you are eligible for participation 
in the study.  If you are eligible for the study and you do wish to continue, you will be scheduled 
for the first set of injections which will be done at your next visit (Visit #2).

The injection procedure will be done in your doctor‘s office.  The doctor will use a syringe with 
a fine needle to inject 0.5 ml of VM202 at sites evenly distributed over your arm or leg muscles 
(the
 limbs not injected in the previous visit).  If you are receiving injections in the arms, you will 
receive 26 injections in each arm as follows: 
 
 Ha nd – 4 injections in each hand: 2 in the palm in the large muscle under the thumb; 2 in the 
muscle between th
e thumb and forefinger 
 Forearm - 6 injections in each forearm: 4 on the inside of the forearm, 2 on the outer forearm 
 Uppe r arm – 16 injections in each upper arm: 8 in the biceps, 8 in the deltoids (upper arm / 
shoulder) 
 
If 
you are receiving injections in the legs, you will receive 38 injections in each leg as follows: 
 
 Thigh – 20 injections evenly distributed over the front of each thigh 
 C alf – 12 injections evenly distributed over the back of each calf, 6 injections on the front of 
each calf 
 
Ea
ch injection will take 3 - 5 seconds.  The entire injection procedure is expected to take 30 
mi
nutes.

(PROTOCOL VMALS-001)  
 
 
Protocol VMALS- 001/B CONFIDENTIAL VM BioPharma 
  Page [ADDRESS_4447] to do as a participant in this study? 
Participation in this study requires you to make sure that you are available to attend all your 
scheduled visits through [ADDRESS_4448] checking with your study doctor.  If you use any non-prescription medication you should 
inform your doctor of the details (medication, dose, etc.) at each study visit.   
 
You also must not participate in any other clinical trial before the 9 month study visit.   
 
What about my rights to decline participation or withdraw from the study? 
You may choose not to be in the study, or, if you agree to be in the study, you may withdraw 
from the study at any time.  If you withdraw from the study, no new data about you will b e 
collected for study purposes.   
 
Your
 decision not to participate or to withdraw from the study will not involve any penalty or 
loss of benefits to which you are entitled, and will not affect your access to health care.  If you do 
decide to stop your participation in the study, you should talk to your doctor immediately so 
he/she can advise you of any additional tests that may be needed for your safety.  Your doctor 
may decide to take you off this study if your condition gets worse, if you have serious side 
effects, or if he/she determines that it is no longer in your best interest to continue.  The Sponsor 
or regulatory agencies may stop this study at any time without your consent.  If this occurs, you 
will
 be notified and your study doctor will discuss with you other options you may have.   
 
What are the risks of this research study? 
There are known risks and discomforts involved in some of the tests and evaluations.  There are 
also unknown risks.  Below is a description of these risks.  Your doctor will discuss the risks and 
procedures with you before you start in the study.   
 
Risks from Injection Procedures 
VM202 will be injected into your muscles using a fine needle.  There may be some pain at the 
inj
ection site at the time of injection.  There may be swelling, bruising or inflammation near the 
injection site.    There may be a risk of an allergic reaction, fever or tissue damage from the 
injection.  Because HGF has the potential to create new blood vessels, there may be risk of 
promoting tumor growth (cancer) or of increasing the number of blood vessels in the back of 
your eye and damaging your retina.   
 
Risks to women who can get pregnant or are breastfeeding 
Being a part of this study while pregnant may expose the unborn child to significant risks.  
Therefore, pregnant women cannot take part in this study.  If you are a woman who can get 
pregnant, a urine pregnancy test will be done and it must show that you are not pregnant before

  Page [ADDRESS_4449] agree to use an acceptable method of birth control for the whole 
study.   
 
The following birth control measures are acceptable:  
 B arrier type devices (examples are condom, diaphragm, and contraceptive sponge) used only 
in combination with a spermicide; 
 Intrauterine device (IUD); 
 B irth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] 
 De po-provera (medroxyprogesterone acetate); 
 L evonorgestrel implants; 
 
Abstention, the rhythm method, and/or contraception by [CONTACT_4906].   
 
If you do become pregnant during this study or think that you might be pregnant, you must 
inform your study doctor immediately.  If this happens, the study doctor will discuss with you 
what you should do.  If you get pregnant, you will be asked to stop taking part in the study and 
you will be asked for information about the pregnancy and the baby.   
 
Risks from taking a blood sample 
You will have routine blood samples taken from a vein in your arm by a needle stick.  Risks 
associated with drawing blood from your arm include slight discomfort and/or bruising.  
Infection, bleeding, clotting, or fainting are also possible, although unlikely.  The number of 
times that you will have a blood sample drawn for this study totals about 13 times over 
a
pproximately 10 months.  Each time your blood is drawn roughly 1 to 2 tablespoons of blood 
will
 be taken.   
 
Risks from EKG  
In rare circumstances, a rash or irritation at the location of the electrocardiogram electrode 
placement can occur due to the adhesive.  If this should occur it will be assessed and treated 
using clinical standards of care with appropriate medication(s) and/or compresses. 
 
Unknown risks 
In addition to the risks already described, there may be other discomforts or risks from this study 
drug and/or procedures that we do not know about.  You will be watched for signs and symptoms 
of any side effects and you should tell your doctor if you do not feel well or experience any 
unusual symptoms.

a
ttempts to apply resistance in the testing position while stating " Hold it, don't let me push it 
down" or "Hold it, don't let me bend it "  
4. I f the subject tolerates no resistance, the muscle score is Grade 3. If the subject tolerates 
some r
esistance, the score is Grade 4, and full resistance, Grade 5.  
5. I f the subject cannot move against gravity, the subject is repositioned to allow movement of 
the extremity with gravity eliminated.  If supporting the limb, the examiner provides neither 
assistance nor resistance to the subject's voluntary movement. This gravity-eliminated 
positioning will vary for each muscle tested. If the subject cannot complete at least partial 
ra
nge of motion with gravity eliminated, the muscle or tendon is observed and/or palpated for 
contraction. 
6. F or a bedridden subject who cannot sit up in a bed placed in the chair position or on the edge 
of the bed, alternate positions for testing the lower extremity are included in this protocol.

 1. BACKGROUND  
Surgical site infection (SSI) remains a persistent and morbid problem in colorectal surgery with 
published rates ranging from 7 to 25% 1-6. The negative outcomes of SSI are well reported and 
include a significant increase in morbidity, length of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], readmissions and healthcare -
associated cost7, 8.  Therefore, strategies to reduce the incidence of SSI following colorectal surgery 
are important to improve overall pa tient outcomes, reduce healthcare -associated costs and provide 
value -based healthcare to surgical patients.  
Since 2005, our institution has been an active participant of the American College of Surgeons 
(ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( NSQIP), and our SSI rates have been 
compared with other NSQIP centers; in 2006, we were found to be a high -outlier institution for SSI   
9.  The ACS -NSQIP greatly facilitated our understanding of the reasons b ehind our high SSI rates, 
the patient profiles that are associated with SSIs, and how we can make improvements. This 
previously published work helped us to develop a Surgical Site Infection Prevention Bundle to 
reduce SSI rates after colorectal  surgical pr ocedures performed  at the Cleveland Clinic. This bundle 
was introduced in February 2014. Between 2013 and 2015, 2250 abdominal colorectal surgical 
procedures were performed, including 986 (43.8%) during the prebundle period and 1264 (56.2%) 
after the bundl e project. Patient characteristics and comorbidities were similar in both periods. The 
overall surgical site infection rate decreased from 11.8% prebundle to 6.6% at the bundle period 
(P < 0.001). Although a decrease for all types of surgical site infectio ns was observed after the 
implementation, a significant reduction was achieved in the organ -space subgroup (5.5% –1.7%;  P < 
0.001).  Since then, the elements of this bundle became the standard of care in all elective  colorectal 
surgeries  done  at the Clevela nd Clinic.  The most important elements of the bundle include 
mechanical bowel preparation, antimicrobial antiseptic skin cleanser, prophylactic antibiotic 
(ceftriaxone + Flagyl) [ADDRESS_1120802] represented  6 randomize d clinical trials (RCTs) and 
[ADDRESS_1120803] of wound protectors in reducing the risk of surgical site 
infection (SSI) after gastrointestinal surgery. A significant decrease in SSI rates (RR = 0.55, 95%  
confidence Interval  (CI) 0.31-0.98, P = 0.04) was noted13. A more recent meta -analysis included 
eighteen randomized controlled trials with 3808 patients. The use of wound protectors was  
associated with the reduced incidence of overall SSI (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.43 -0.81; z  = 3.30; 
  CleanCision and SSI  
 
 
Version 7.0 – 02-26-2020   4 
 p < 0.001) and superficial SSI (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.18 -0.95; z = 2.09; p  < 0.04). In addition, wound 
protectors successfully  reduced the risk of SSI in clean -contaminated  wounds  (OR 0.67; 95% CI 
0.46-0.98; z  = 2.06; p  < 0.04) as well as in contaminated  wounds  (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.12 -0.49; 
z = 3.96; p  < 0.0001)11. Based on that, the WHO global guidelines for the prevention of surgical site 
infection recommends the usage of wound protector devices in clean -contaminated, contaminated 
and dirty abdominal surgical procedures for the purpose of reducing the rate  of SSI14.  
The usage of in traoperative wound irrigation has also been shown to significantly reduce the risk of 
SSI via multiple RTC. A significant reduction in SSI rates after intraoperative wound irrigation  with 
any solution was noted compared to no  irrigation (OR =  0.54, 95 % CI  0.42; 0.69 , p < 0.0001) 13.  
A surgical device that combines continuous wound irrigation and barrier protection will have an 
important SSI prevention advantage. CleanCision is a recently developed apparatus that serves this 
dual purpose and was found to reduce bacterial wound contamination in preclinic al and clinical 
trials. A prospective multicenter pi[INVESTIGATOR_810354] 7 large tertiary -
care referral centers in the [LOCATION_003]15. The study was designed to evaluate the bacteriology of the wound 
incision edge when an investigational device  (CleanCision wound protector)  that combines 
continuous wound irrigation and barrier protection was used during colorectal surgery. A total of 
97 patients (11 roll -in and 86 treatments) were enrolled in the study. All patients completed the 30 -
day follow -up. The 86 treatment patients w ere used for the primary analysis.  Use of the study device 
was associated with a 71% reduction in enteric bacterial contamination (9.5% vs 33.3%,  P < 0.001), 
and 66% reduction in overall bacterial contamination (11.9 vs. 34.5%,  P < 0.001) at the protected 
incision edge versus the exposed incision edge. In addition, analysis of the skin organisms on the 
incision edge prior to device placement compared to the protected incision edge at the time of device 
removal demonstrated an 86% reduction after use of the study device (16.7 vs. 2.4%,  P < 0.001). 
There were no deaths and no device -related adverse events reported in the study.  There were 4 
wound -related adverse events, other than SSI, reported: 1 skin necrosis, 1 non -infections erythema, 
1 hematoma and 1 woun d opening up postoperatively. All 4 events were not device related as 
determined by [CONTACT_6962].  Although SSI was not the endpoint that this study was designed 
to examine, the observed overall SSI rate  was 1.2%, such rate is  lower than reported at our institute 
for colorectal surgery ( 6.6% )15.  
As part of our continuous effort to reduce SSI, additional measures such as CleanCision wound 
protector could bring our SSI rates even further. This will translate in better patient care and reduced 
health care cost.  
Supported by [CONTACT_810358] 11, 13, 15, this study  aims to investigate 
the effect of using CleanCision wound protector on  the rates of postoperative Surgical Site 
Infections in comparison to the current wound protector  (Alexis O)  being used at our institute.

3. SELECTION OF PA TIENT S 
 
3.1 Inclusion Criteria  
  
 Patients 18 years old and above.  
 Elective colorectal surgery with a planned resection including open or laparoscopic 
surgeries.   
 Patients with a c lean –contaminated, contaminate d, or dirty wound classification  
 Patients undergoing Standard of care SSI reduction bundle including Prophylactic 
AB and mechanical bowel preparation.   
 Anticipated incision length of 3 -17 cm  
 
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
 
 Patients with a preexisting stoma.  
 Patien ts with prior laparotomy withi n 15 days.  
 Patients with an active infection or systemic antibiotic therapy within 1 week prior 
to surgery with the exception of preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis.  
 Emergent/ urgent surgery.  
 
3.3 Statistical Considerations  
 
Planned Data Analysis  
Descri ptive statistics will be computed for all variables including mean ± standard deviation 
or median [25th, 75th percentiles] for continuous factors and frequency (percent) for 
categorical variables. Univariate analyses will be conducted to compare the distri bution of 
pre-op characteristics across study groups using ANOVA for continuous variables and Chi -
square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables.  
 
For purposes of statistical analysis, a subset analysis may be done based on laparoscopic vs. 
open p rocedures, patients with high risk for SSI, type of surgery, or other clinically 
significant co -factors.  All data will be analyzed with the use of SAS (version 9.4, The SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC), SPSS statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL),  or R ve rsion 3.1.2 
(www.R -project.org).  A p -value <0.05 will considered statistically significant.  
 
Sample Size Calculations    
The sample size calculation using estimates of SSIs from the Papaconstantinou  et al. 
Multicenter trial. This study showed an incisional SSI rate of 1.2% in thos e that completed 
the protocol. In comparison, the incisional SSI rate using the current standard of care 
  CleanCision and SSI  
 
 
Version 7.0 – 02-26-2020   6 
 practice at our institute is 4.8 %.  On the other hand, the overall SSI rates in Papaconstantinou 
et al. multicenter trial is 3.7% and in the current standard of practice at the Cleveland Clinic, 
the overall SSI rate is 6.6%.  We used these two estimates of SSI rates to calculate the sample 
size.  Using the incisional SSI,  we assumed a 3.6% drop rate if the study hypothesis is true. 
We are assuming equal -sized treatment groups and alpha = 0.05.  Based on this assumption, 
a total of 277 subjects in each study group will be needed to achieve 70% power, [ADDRESS_1120805] udy group will be needed to achieve 80% power, and 470 subjects will be 
needed to achieve 90% power. On the other hand, using the overall SSI rates and assuming 
a drop of 2.9% , a total of 716  subjects in each study group will be needed to achieve 70% 
power, 805 subjects in each study group will be needed to achieve 80% power, and  1219 
subjects will be needed to achieve 90% power.  
 
Based on the above, [ADDRESS_1120806] of 
care SSI prevention bundle. Part of this bundle is the utilization of wound protectors. The current 
system used at Cleveland Clinic  is Alexis wound protectors/retractors (Applied Medical, Avenida 
Empresa Rancho Santa Margarita, CA). It provides 360° of circumferential, atraumatic dry 
retraction. Independent wound irrigation is also utilized. CleanCision is a novel FDA approved 
irrigating wound protector/ retractor that combines mechanical wound prote ction with an active 
continuous irrigation via microfluidic system that circulates the irrigation throughout the whole 
thickness of the protecting membrane. The safety and possible advantage of this new system has 
been shown through prec linical and clinica l studies. Prescient Surgical, based in San Carlos, 
[LOCATION_004], has an FDA  marketing  clearance  for its  CleanCision  Wound Retraction and Protection 
System.   
4.1 Consent  
 
Patients will be identified prospectively by [CONTACT_810359] / 
exclusion criteria. Patients will be offered to participate in the study in the preoperative setting . The 
patient eligibility to participate in the study will be verified by [CONTACT_3476].  The study details will 
be explained to the patient by a member of the study team. The consent conversation will take place 
in a private room and a sufficient time interval will be offered to allow the patient to comprehend  
the study details. Enrolled patients will be randomly assigned via REDCap  in a 1:1 rati o to either 
the control arm (Alexis wound protector) or the intervention arm (CleanCis ion Wound retractor 
system) . The randomization will be done by a delegated member of the study team . Consent will be 
documented in the medical record.

 4.2 Study Process  
 
Utilization of CleanCision wound protector/ Irrigation system is free  of charge without e xtra 
financial charges to the enrolled patients.  
The study team  will confirm that patients are adhering to pre - intra- and post -operative standard of 
care SSI prevention bundle. The Bundle main elements are:  
 Patient bathing with Hibiclens preoperatively.  
 The patient use CHG (SAGE) wipes.  
 Mechanical bowel preparation.  
 Antibiotics Prophylaxis (ceftriaxone + Flagyl) given approximately 1 h our prior to 
incision. If the patient is allergic to above antibiotics, aztreonam or imipenem are used as 
prophylactic antibiotics.  
 The usage of wound protector and the placement and r emoval of blue towels under the 
Alexis wound protectors for control cases.  
 Use chlorhexidine gluconate and isopropyl alcohol for preoperative skin preparation  
 Wound irrigated with 100cc of fresh saline.  
 Separate instrument tray used for closing the incisi on. 
 Gloves changed before closing the incision.  
 Suction tip changed before closing the incision.  
 Dressing left intact for [ADDRESS_1120807] of 
care in terms of providing the baseline needed protection.  Intra -operatively, either CleanCision 
Wound protector/ irrigation system or Alexis O wound protector will be ch osen. Additional wound 
irrigation and washing with Normal Saline will be performed before skin closure as part of the 
standard of care. This will include both study groups (patients with Alexis O wound protectors and 
CleanCision wound protectors). In the C leanCision group, a broad spectrum antibiotic may be added 
to the irrigation fluid. Post -operatively, patients will be followed for wound infections according to 
the standard of care in the department of colorectal surgery. For patients undergoing colorect al 
procedures at the department of colorectal surgery, the timing of outpatient post -operative follow -
up can be variable depending on the type of procedure performed, the treating surgeon, the patient 
place of residence, and the patient general medical con dition.  To avoid variability, patients will be 
asked to send a photographic documentation of the wound at day 7 ± 7 days and day 30 ± [ADDRESS_1120808] of care, a photograph of the wound can be obtained during the outpatient visit by [CONTACT_717104].  The purpose of these photographs as well as the time poin ts will be explained to the 
patient at the time study enrollment. Patients refusing or incapable of sending the photographs will 
not be enrolled in the study.  For study enrolled patients’ a reminder will be added to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_810355] .

 4.3 Blinded Assessment  
The study team member will evaluat e the  images for signs of surgical site infection  and will be 
blinded to the type of wound protector used intraoperatively. This will be done at regular intervals 
and in aggregate.  
4.4 Data Recording  
 
Data will be collected from EPIC by [CONTACT_3476]. A secure REDCap database will be utilized to 
store the d ata. The following variables will be recorded:

o DOB , age at the time of surgery, gender, race , Height, weight and body mass index 
(BMI) at the time of surgery.  
 American Society of Anesthesiologists physical  status classification (ASA score).  
 Preoperative diagnosis and patient’s History of present illness.   
 Adherence  to SSI prevention bundle (e lements defined above).  
 Risk factors for SSI including nutritional status (represent ed by [CONTACT_810360]) an d 
immune status including WBC and differentials, history of smoking, and any other risk 
factors for SSI.  
 
B) Intraoperative variables:  
 Operating surgeon.  
 Length of incision/wound.  
 Surgical approach (open vs. laparoscopic vs transanal).  
 Device deficiencies  including (leaking of fluid, breakage of plastic sheath, ring malfunction 
in CleanCision wound protector).  
 
C) Postoperative variables:  
 In-patient Progress notes.  
 The development of SSI per the criteria defined above along with any related investigation 
/ clinical encounter needed for such diagnosis. The timing of SSI development.  
 
4.5 Definitions  
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of wound classifications and SSIs were adopted 
in this study. The WHO definitions are based on the Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). NHSN is the nation’s most widely used 
healthcare -associated infection tracking system  14.

Version 7.0 – 02-26-2020   9 
 Surgical wound classification  
1. Clean: An uninfected operative wound in which no inflammation is encountered and the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], alimentary, genital, or un infected urinary tracts are not entered. In addition, clean 
wounds are primarily closed and, if necessary, drained with closed drainage.  
2. Clean -contaminated: Operative wounds in which the respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], alimentary, genital, or urinary 
tracts are entered u nder controlled conditions and without unusual contamination. Specifically, 
operations involving the biliary tract, appendix, vagina, and oropharynx are included in this 
category, provided no evidence of infection or major break in technique is encountered .  
3. Contaminated: Open, fresh, accidental wounds. In addition, operations with major breaks in 
sterile technique (for example, open cardiac massage) or gross spi[INVESTIGATOR_810356], and incisions in which acute, non -purulent inflammatio n is encountered including necrotic 
tissue without evidence of purulent drainage (for example, dry gangrene) are included in this 
category.  
4. Dirty or infected: Includes old traumatic wounds with retained devitalized tissue and those that 
involve existin g clinical infection or perforated viscera. This definition suggests that the organisms 
causing post -operative infection were present in the operative field before the operation.  
Surgical Site Infection s (SSI)  
Superficial SSI  
A) An infection occurring with in 30 days of the operative procedure (where day 1 = the procedure 
date).  
 
B) AND involves only skin and subcutaneous tissue of the incision.  
 
C) AND patient has at least one of the following:  
 Purulent drainage from the superficial incision.  
 Organisms identified from an aseptically -obtained specimen from the superficial incision or 
subcutaneous tissue by a culture or non -culture based microbiologic testing method which 
is performed for purposes of clinical diagnosis or treatment.  
 Superficial incision t hat is deliberately opened by a surgeon or other designee and culture or 
non-culture  based testing is not performed  AND patient has at least one of the following 
signs or symptoms: pain or tenderness; localized swelling; erythema; or heat.  
 Diagnosis of a superficial incisional SSI by [CONTACT_810361].  
 
The following do not qualify as superficial SSI:  
 Diagnosis/treatment of cellulitis (redness/warmth/swelling), by [CONTACT_5071], does not meet 
criterion “d” for superficial incisional SSI. Conversely, a n incision that is draining or that 
has organisms identified by [CONTACT_679570] -culture based testing is not considered a cellulitis.  
 A stitch abscess alone (minimal inflammation and discharge confined to the points of suture 
penetration).

Objective :  The intent of this exploratory study is to compare two methods (cordless vs corded gingival 
displacement) currently used in clinical practice to displace sulcular tissues to facilitate an acceptable dental impression that accurately captures the prepare d cervical finish line for the fabrication of indirect 
fixed prosthodontic restorations. The primary aims are to compare the two methods with respect to 1) the accuracy of the impression with respect to capturing the prepared cervical finish line for the 
fabrication of the indirect fixed prosthodontic restoration as assessed by [CONTACT_497844] 2) the time required to prepare the impression and 3) the discomfort of the procedure as reported by [CONTACT_102]. 
Secondary aims are to estimate the effect of clinician experience (resident level vs faculty) and jaw of restoration placement (maxillary vs mandibular) on the outcomes of accuracy, time, and discomfort.   
Background:  Indirect fixed prosthodontic restorations are widely used for the restoration of teeth. The 
fabrication of a well -fitting indirect restoration requires an accurate impression which captures the cervical 
finish line. Dentists have a hard time making proper impressions, with a reported 56% of impressions sent to labs being inadequate. The most common deficiency is inadequate recording of the cervical finish line. The primary reason for this inadequacy is deficient gingival displacement technique.  
The traditional procedure used to displace gingival tissue prior to making impressions is gingi val retraction 
cord, with a reported 92% of dentists surveyed employing this procedure. (Ahmed 2014) For this procedure 
to work properly, it is time consuming (requires 7 -10 minutes in the sulcus), technique sensitive, requires 
anesthetizing the patient, and causes patient discomfort both during and post operatively. 
More effective and efficient gingival displacement procedure can lead to clinically improved fixed 
restorations, less patient chair time, and less patient discomfort.  
Materials and Methods:  On e hundred (100) patients will be recruited from the University of North 
Carolina (UNC) School of Dentistry (SOD). A stratified block randomization will be used to randomize 
patient to impression technique:  Aquasil Ultra Cordless, Dentsply International using Aquasil Ultra 
Polyvinyl siloxane (PVS) impression material versus Dentsply International, gingival displacement cord (Ultrapak, Ultradent Products International) hydrated with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (Hemodent, 
Premier Dental Products Company). St ratification will be based on the clinic where treatment is 
provided (Dental Faculty Practice, Graduate Operative Dentistry, Graduate Prosthodontic Clinic), A block size of 4 within each stratum will be used to maintain a balanced allocation to impression group. Patient inclusion criteria include: 1) requires indirect restoration 2) probing depths 4mm or less. 3) No 
bleeding on probing. 4) finish line 0- 1mm sub -gingival.

Significance  
Indirect fixed prosthodontic restorations are widely used for the restoration of teeth. The fabrication of a well -
fitting indirect restoration requires an accurate impression which captures the cervical finish line. Dentists 
have a hard time making proper impressions, with a reported 56% of impressions sent to labs being 
inadequate. The most common deficiency is inadequate recording of the cervical finish line. The primary reason for this inadequacy is deficient gingival displacement technique.  
The traditional procedure used to displace gingival tissue prior to making impressions is gingival retraction 
cord, with a reported 92% of dentists surveyed employing this procedure. (Ahmed 2014) For this procedure to work properly, it is time consuming (requires 7 -10 minutes in the sulcus), technique sensitive, requires 
anesthetizing the patient, and causes patient discomfort both during and post operatively. 
More effective and efficient gingival displacement procedure can lead to clinically improved fixed 
restorations, less patient chair time, and less patient discomfort.  
The specific aims in this proposal explore whether a cordless gingival dis placement procedure can 
properly displace sulcular tissues to facilitate an acceptable impression that accurately captures the 
prepared cervical finish line for the fabrication of indirect fixed prosthodontic restorations and thereby [CONTACT_497845] a traditionally technique sensitive procedure in dentistry.  
 
Methods  
A total of one hundred participants will be recruited from the University of North Carolina (UNC) 
School of Dentistry (SOD) Graduate Prosthodontics clinic, Graduate Operative clinic, and the Dental 
Faculty Practice. A stratified block randomization will be used to randomize patient to impression 
technique:  Aquasil Ultra Cordless, Dentsply International using Aquasil Ultra Polyvinyl siloxane 
(PVS) impression material versus Dentsply In ternational, gingival displacement cord (Ultrapak, 
Ultradent Products International) hydrated with aluminum chloride hexahydrate (Hemodent, Premier 
Dental Products Company).  Stratification will be based on the clinic where treatment is provided 
(Dental Faculty Practice, Graduate Operative Dentistry, Graduate Prosthodontic Clinic), A block size of 
[ADDRESS_640253] posterior, will be included in t he evaluation. The clinician will be instructed to 
  complete the impression for that tooth be fore proceeding to other teeth. The patient will be informed that 
participation, if multiple teeth are treatment p lanned, may increase the appointment time.  
 
The gingival displacement procedures and impression procedures are described here:  
 
Traditional Corded Impression Procedure: 
1) The prepared tooth is washed and dried, and assure hemostasis.  
2) Small diameter re traction cord, after it has been hydrated with Hemodent for [ADDRESS_640254] from the tooth. (Before making the impression, the 2nd larger cord is removed, 
and the gums will stay back  long enough for the impression material to seep around the tooth, thus 
allowing it to capture a copy of the entire tooth preparation.) 
3) After a minimum of [ADDRESS_640255] will be removed, and the tooth dried. Quickly, after 
confirmation o f a dry field, the light body consistence impression material is syringed around the 
prepared tooth and across the occlusal surfaces of adjacent teeth.  
4) An impression tray  that has been filled with the heavy body consistency impression material is then 
placed over the arch of teeth, and gently pressed into place to ensure the teeth are completely covered 
with a uniform thickness of impression material. As the different impression material  consistencies set, 
they fuse together into a single unit.  
5) When r emoved from the mouth, the impression should contain a negative copy of both the prepared 
tooth and the teeth of that jaw. 
 
Cordless Impression Procedure: 
1) The prepared tooth is washed and dried, and assure hemostasis.  
2) Apply B4 + surface optimizer. 
3a) If [ADDRESS_640256] restoration is being impressed, a single size 
(0.7mL) unit dose cartridge will be inserted into the digit power dispenser. If more than [ADDRESS_640257] restoration is being impressed, a mul ti size (1.6mL) unit 
dose cartridge will be inserted into the digit power dispenser.   
3b) Using the digit power dispenser, unit dose cartridge, and intrasulcular mixing tip, depress foot pedal 
and gently insert tip into the gingival sulcus of the prepared tooth, slightly api[INVESTIGATOR_497842]. Material should flood the sulcus. Make sure to dispense material ahead of the intrasulcular 
tip, and completely around the prepared finish line, and then the tooth. 
4) An impression tray  that has been filled with the heavy body consistency impression material is then 
placed over the arch of teeth, and gently pressed into place to ensure the teeth are completely covered 
with a uniform thickness of impression material. As the different impression material  consistencies set, 
they fuse together into a single unit.  
5) When removed from the mouth, the impression should contain a negative copy of both the prepared 
tooth and the teeth of that jaw. 
 
  The clinician will record the impression technique, type o f impression material used; whether tray 
adhesive was used; the tray material; the type of tray used; the number of units requested; the time 
required to obtain the first impression (start and end of impression taking is defined above for each 
procedure), and the total number of impressions produced until an adequate impression was 
made. Also recorded will be the clinic and resident year if placed in a graduate clinic and the 
subject’s age and sex.  Unique id numbers not related to clinical record will be used.  
The impressions will be photographed, digitally scanned, saved in black and white, and then collectively 
evaluated at a later time based on a criteria evaluation form by [CONTACT_497846]. The evaluators 
(also referred to as expert examiner) will assess each impression for errors in the finish line; in the 
tray/material; and errors with gingival displacement/hemostasis as primary outcomes. The number of 
errors can range from 0 to 13.  
Patient discomfort will be assessed using the FACES visual pi[INVESTIGATOR_497843] 1 -10 based on 
the following question posed at 4 points during treatment; “How much discomfort are you experiencing at this point in treatment?” This question will be ask ed at the beginning of the treatment appointment, 
immediately before the impression procedure is initiated, immediately after the impression procedure is 
completed, and again at the completion of the treatment appointment. Each question will be rated on a 
scale of 1 to 10. The total score indicated by [CONTACT_497847] 4 questions will be analyzed.  
Patient consent will be obtained prior t o treatment and the impression.  This may occur at a prior 
treatment planning visit or at the treatment visit.  
 
Inclusion Cr iteria:  
• Patients must be adult males or females 18 years of age or older.  
• Patients must be able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions. 
• Patients must have read, understood and signed an informed consent form. 
• Patients must be in good general health, (based on a review of the medical history, blood 
pressure and heart rate).  
• Patients must have no health- realated contra- indications to dental treatment.  
• Patient must require at least one indirect restorations (crowns).  
• Probing pocket depths arou nd the treatment tooth/teeth must be 4mm or less.  
• There must be no bleeding on probing around the treatment tooth/teeth. 
• The prepared finish line must be between 0 to 1mm sub -gingival (inclusive).  
 
Exclusion Criteria: 
• Individuals who have a chronic disease with oral manifestations.  
• Individuals who exhibit gross oral pathology. 
• Smokers 
• Uncontrolled Diabetics (per review of medical history)  
• Probing pocket depths around treatment tooth/teeth of greater than 4mm.  
• Bleeding on probing around treatment tooth.teeth. 
• The prepared finsh line is greater than 1mm sub- gingival.  
 
The inclusion/exclusion criteria limit generalizability of the findings to patients without confounding  
periodontal or medical issues.  However, the sample size of this study is not suffici ent to extend to a 
consideration of the effect of these confounders on the comparison of the two impression techniques.  
 
  The proposed resea rch study requires a total of [ADDRESS_640258] adult 
medical and dental health history questionnaire provided by [CONTACT_497848] (Appendix 1) and will be provided with the UNC Chapel Hill Notice of Privacy Practices and the Consent for Purposes of 
Treatment, Payment and Health Care Operations (Appendix 2). Other than the research consent, these 
are standard practices followed by [CONTACT_497849]. The study is mandated to adhere to these 
protocols prior to tre ating a patient at the UNC SOD.  After consent has been obtained, an oral 
examination will be performed by [CONTACT_497850].  The patient will be dropped from the study if inclusion/ exclusion criteria are not met. The treating 
clinician will record the criteria that resulted in the patient being dropped (See Appendix B). If the 
inclusion criteria are not met, a clinically appropriate impression method will be performed at the 
clinician's judgment and wil l be made per case by [CONTACT_68071], following standard of care.  
Customary anesthesia and tooth preparation will be performed by [CONTACT_497851]. The gingival displacement procedure and impression will be made as 
described in this study protocol and as followed on the laminated clinical protocol sheet. If the clinician finds that the first impression is inadequate and chooses to make an additional impression, only the first 
impression will be evalu ated for the study and a note will be indicated to record the number of 
impressions the clinician made to achieve an acceptable impression.  
Patients will be given appropriate verbal and written post-procedure instructions; and appointments will be made fo r restoration try -in and delivery, as would happen as part of their regular treatment.  
There are no potential direct benefits to the participant besides the fact that particularly close attention will be paid to the gingival displacement and impression procedures, and there will be close evaluation of impressions.  
All of the impressions will be photographed and digitally scanned, and saved in black and white.  
These scans will be evaluated collectively on a later day, and will be critiqued based on a criter ia form 
(See Appendix B). This evaluation will be performed by [ADDRESS_640259]- related personnel will  be able to access these files.  Data 
collection for ms will be kept in locked files. Quality assurance (QA) will occur as data is entered in 
order to check for data completeness and consistency prior to entry.   
 
Statistical Analysis:  
Descriptive statistics for all study variables will be computed by [CONTACT_497852]. The primary outcomes are 
the number errors of the impression in the finish line; in the tray/material; and errors with gingival 
displacement/hemostasis (number of errors can range from 0 to 13), the time to complete the impression, 
and patient di scomfort (range from 0 to 4 0). Since the outcomes are unlikely to be normally distributed, 
the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used as the primary statistical test to assess whether the quality of impressions, time, or patient discomfort made with a cordless gingival displacement procedure is 
different than with a corded technique. To adjust for additional covariates [clinic providing care, jaw, procedural material s], Poisson regression will be used to assess the relationship between the primary 
outcomes and the covariates of interest, including impression group with a primary interest in estimation using confidence intervals.  
The lack of historical data comparing the proposed outcomes between the two impression groups makes a sample size calculation difficult. For this exploratory study which is time constrained as a thesis project, a sample size calculation was done using an effect size which may be larger than the clinically 
meaningful effect size. A sample size of [ADDRESS_640260] 80% power to detect a probability of 0.709 that an observation (number of total errors) in the Cordless group is less than an observation in the 
Corded group using a Wilcoxon ( Mann -Whitney) rank-sum test with a 0.[ADDRESS_640261] approximately 1.5 years to allow for recruitment and data collection and 
analysis. The study would ask the participants to come to 2 appointments; it might be possible to consent 
the patient and perform treatment on the same day, if the patient was scheduled for treatment that day 
already.

This study seeks to improve clinical care for peripheral and central vestibular disorders by [CONTACT_697447]. Vertigo and dizziness lead to ~4.4 million US emergency 
department (ED)  visits annually at a cost of roughly $[ADDRESS_946673] of the estimated 1 million patients with 
peripheral (inner ear) vestibular causes for their symptoms are over -tested, misdiagnosed, and undertreated. 
Each year in the [LOCATION_002] (US), h undreds of millions of dollar s are spent on neuroimaging (~$500M CT, 
~$100M MRI) trying to detect the 3-5% of patients who have life -threatening posterior fossa strokes causing 
their vertigo―yet one -third of these vestibular strokes are missed. Accurate , early,  and efficient diagnosis  will 
save lives and reduce costs through prompt and appropriate treatments  applied in the ED in real time . 
Our team has studied dizziness in the ED for more than a decade. We have developed a new approach to 
differentiate benign peripheral causes from dangerous central ones by [CONTACT_697448] ( HINTS : Head Impulse, Nystagmus, Test of Skew) and hearing. Our approach enables rapid 
physiologic diagnosis at the bedside with greater accuracy than MRI brain scans in the fir st two days after the 
onset of acute, continuous vertigo or dizziness. This approach has been validated in over 200 patients. Similar, 
well-established bedside techniques (e.g., Dix -Hallpi[INVESTIGATOR_697363]) work to diagnose intermittent, position -provoked 
vertigo. U nfortunately, these eye movement tests are unfamiliar to most ED providers  and even to many 
specialists. A video -oculography (VOG) device that measures these eye movements quantitatively has the 
potential to transform diagnosis of acute  dizziness and verti go. The device is easy to use, measures eye 
movements accurately, and requires no more patient cooperation than a routine bedside exam of the cranial 
nerves  by a specialist . We have shown initial proof that the device correctly diagnoses acute vestibular s trokes.  
The AVERT  Trial ( Acute Video-oculography for Vertigo in Emergency Rooms for Rapid Triage ) is a 
multicenter, randomized, Phase II clinical trial of VOG -guided vs. standard care to improve diagnosis and initial 
management for patients with a chief sy mptom of vertigo or dizziness suspected to be of vestibular cause. We 
will recruit [ADDRESS_946674] procedures and data collection tools prior to initiation 
of the main trial.  
We hypothesize that VOG -guided rapid triage (VRT) will accurately, safely, and efficiently differentiate 
peripheral from central vestibular disorders in ED patients presenting acute vertigo or dizziness, and 
that doing so has the potential to improve post -treatment clinical outcomes for these patients.

2. BACKGROUND  
Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_697364] a ma jor public health problem 
relevant to NIDCD1 and NIH.2 There are ~4.4 million US emergency department (ED) visits  for vertigo or 
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946677] of ~$10 billion/yr.3 The ~[ADDRESS_946678] ED 
clinical practice, resulting in both overuse and underuse of diagnostic tests.4 Patients with inner ear conditions 
such as vestibular neuritis (or laby[CONTACT_344105]) and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) are often imaged 
and admitted unnecessarily4 instead of being treated and discharged. Patients with dangerous brainstem or 
cerebellar strokes may be sent home without critical stroke treatments, somet imes resulting in serious harm.[ADDRESS_946679] developed a clinical decision rule based on such eye exams that distinguishes central from peripheral 
causes in acute vertigo more accurately than early MRI.4,21,38 Unfortunately, eye findings (e.g., head impulse, 
nystagmus type) require visual interpret ation and can be subtle. Many clinicians are unfamiliar with their use .5 
A device measuring these eye movements could transform diagnosis of vertigo in the ED. A portable video -
oculography (VOG) device is approved by [CONTACT_697449]. Its technical performance has been 
validated in the lab,52,53 and it is already routinely used in the assessment of peripheral vestibular patients in 
otolaryngology clinics.54-56 We recently showed that it can accurately diagnose strokes in the ED.33 Integration 
of this device into daily ED practice could allow rapid and accurate diagnosis of vestibular neuritis, BPPV, and 
stroke―in tota l accounting for  roughly  one third of ED dizziness  patients .57,58  
 
3. STUDY PROCEDURES  
Randomized controlled trial (individual patient randomization), parallel design (1:1)  (Figure 1 ). Patients 
screened but not eligible for randomization will be enrolled in an observational arm that undergoes limited 
follow -up to ascertain for cli nical outcomes, particularly stroke events . 
 
 
 
Figure 1. AVERT Trial  patient flow. R = randomization. The VOG -guided  rapid triage  (VRT)  algorithm selects a predetermined care 
pathway using decision rules. If the V RT algorithm diagnosis is peripheral, the patient will be slated for treat and discharge  from the ED , 
followed by [CONTACT_50426] -day safety MRI . ED providers may go ‘off protocol’ and insist on admission for safety, and may choose to consult 
another provider (e.g.,  ENT physician , vestibular physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541])  for treatment of BPPV or vestibular neuritis  if study treatment 
procedures appear ineffective . If the VOG diagnosis is equivocal, a neurology consultation is required, with subsequent management 
determin ed by [CONTACT_697450] (s) working together. The requirement for neurology consultation may be waived in cases where 
doing so could not feasibly be accomplished within a reasonable time frame; in such a case, the ED provider would determine subseq uent 
management without the assistance of a neurologist. If the VOG diagnosis is central, the research tea m will request that the ED provider 
order a neurology consultation, neuroimaging (MRI), and admit the patient for further evaluation and testing , even if the ED provider 
believes the patient has a peripheral cause ; a note to this effect will be placed in the patient’s medical chart as part of the research record.  
The ED provider will make the final decision whether to admit the patient. If the ED provider elects to discharge the patien t, this would be 
documented as a protocol deviation . Funds permitting, we will also obtain [ADDRESS_946680] procedures , data collection tools  and examine 
VOG-guided rapid triage (VRT) reports prior to initiation of the main AVERT Trial .  Study coordinators will 
verify that VOG quantitative outputs are complete and accurate before results are submitted to the clinical trials 
data warehouse. A designated centralized eye movement expert  will revie w all VOG tests (videos, tracings, 
summary values and the automated algorithm classification) after VOG data collection and provide a n 
eligibility determination and diagnostic classi fication , independent of the automated VRT algorithm result.   The 
expert h uman interpretation will eith er agree or disagree with the eligibility and classification determined by [CONTACT_697451].  If disagreement occurs, the human expert classification will d etermine eligibility  (for all) 
and VRT pathway of care (for those  randomized to the VRT arm of the study) . These findings will be compared 
to the automated results  output from the VOG device for quality assurance and to evaluate t esting accuracy and 
sensitivity of the VOG -guided results.  This process will continue in t he main trial, if necessary, until 
confirmation of VOG testing result accuracy  is established and verified.  Subjects enrolled in the logistical pi[INVESTIGATOR_697365], but not all, study procedures scheduled for the main trial.  
 
4. ENROLLMENT  CRITERIA  & PROCESS  
Performance sites are Johns Hopkins University  (Bayview Medical Center  [ED] , Johns Hopkins Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]  [ED, 
clinic] ), University of Michigan  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [ED, clinic], University of Illino is (OSF St. Francis Medical Center  
[ED, clinic] ), The Mount Sinai  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [ED, Clinic], The [LOCATION_005]  General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] [ED], [LOCATION_005]  
Eye and Ear [ Clinic].   
 
4.A. MRI standardization subjects  
 
Healthy volunteers, up to 4, were recruited for the purposes of standardizing MRI machine settings and image 
acquisition protocols across sites. Some of the volunteers were staff traveling from the Coordinating Center 
(CC) to the performance sites in order  to have the same person(s) undergo MRI scanning at each site to enhance 
MRI standardization a cross sites. Adults [ADDRESS_946681] an MRI, including people with certain metal or foreign objects in their bodies, and pregnant 
wom en were excluded. Non -study staff volunteers were recruited in accordance with local IRB policies.  
 
4.B. Dizziness subjects (ED patients at one of 5 academic -affiliated hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]; consecutive sample  during shifts ) 
 
For the main clinical trial, we expect t o enroll (randomize) approximately 226 participants recruited from the 
ED across  the five sites, approximately 75 per site  (the Johns Hopkins and University of Michigan will each 
recruit a total of 75 subjects from all of their institutional ED sites  combi ned). Recruitment will be consecutive 
during shifts ( generally scheduled during the time window 8AM to 7PM  weekdays ). For the logistical p ilot 
study , participants from the ED were screened and granted consent for participation across the three  sites in a 
convenience sample to maximize effectiveness of trial procedure development . 
 
4.1 Inclusion criteria  
Adult (18 years and older)  ED patients with  all of the following  (all determined pre -randomization) :  
1. VESTIBULAR SYMPTOMS: presenting symptom of “vertigo” OR “dizziness” OR “unsteadiness” ( as 
defined by [CONTACT_697452]25)  
2. RELEVANT EXAM SIGNS *: pathologic nystagmus (spontaneous, gaze -evoked, or positional) by [CONTACT_697453] (gait, trunk, stance, limbs) by [CONTACT_697454]

patients with abnormal mental state due to alcohol intoxication or illicit substance, which are known, easily -
recognized causes of dizziness or vertigo presentations to the ED)  
• Non-English speaking (enrollment of non -English speakers is not feasible given the logistics of identifying a 
translator and the need for rapid recruitment and randomization in the AVERT study; furthermore, the terms 
vertigo, dizziness, and unsteadiness may have different meanings in other languages15) 
• Known pregnancy  (all women of childbearing age who are enrolled will undergo a urine or serum beta -HCG 
pregnancy test prior to MRI to confirm no pregnancy , per local institutional guidelines)  
• Unable or u nsafe to participate in screening, including VOG tests (as deemed by [CONTACT_697455] -enrollment risk 
assessment questions  or ED provider  and/or Study Coordinator  judgment ) including, but not limited to:  
o visual impairment sufficient to prevent visual fixation during the VOG testing  
o clinically -perceived risk to patient of participating in study (ED provider  or staff concerns)  
o clinically -perceived risk to research staff (e.g., violence, blood/body fluid/respi[INVESTIGATOR_467135])  
o unstable cardiac status (given a single reported case of bradycardia with impulse testing61) 
o acute cranio -cervical trauma or other condition (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) that might lead to 
instabi lity of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_697367] a contraindication to neck rotation during VOG testing

• Unable to participate fully with study follow -up (particularly MRI)  including, but not limited to:  
o unable to return for follow -up testing within 30 days  
o unable to undergo  MRI because of contraindications (e.g., pacemaker, metallic foreign body, 
pregnancy) or other reasons ( severe claustrophobia, too large or too heavy for MRI scanner)  
 
4.3 Study enrollment procedures   
4.3.1 Sampling:  Consecutive during shifts. Recruitment shifts will be Monday to Friday during peak hours 
(window between 8 AM–7PM). Total ~35 hours per week.  
4.3.2 Identification & Recruitment:  A full-time study coordinator  (SC) at each site will screen, recruit, and 
colle ct clinical data. The SC will be stationed in the hospit al to systematically identify  potential subjects and 
maximize early recruitment , using both active and passive (notified by [CONTACT_175302]) surveillance . We will actively 
pre-screen chief complaints under a HIPAA waiver, and approach potentially eligible patients for pre -screening 
and consent. After granting consent, p atients will undergo VOG testing to determine trial eligibility.   
4.3.3 Documentation for Ineligibility:  Patien ts with a chief presenting symptom of vertigo , dizziness , or 
unsteadiness , whether eligible or not, who have been screened by [CONTACT_697457][INVESTIGATOR_697368] E lectronic Data Capture (EDC)  system. All reasons for exclusion for each 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     9  patient not entered into the trial will be recorded. Each participating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697369] a standardized electronic data capture procedure (see ‘Digivey’ below) . Subjects 
completing the s creening procedure will be identified as ineligible ( a pre-screen or screen failure ) or will be  
randomized. Monthly reports of subject accrual (pre -screened, screened, randomized) and other protocol 
compliance data will be maintained by [CONTACT_697458] d for site performance.  
4.3.[ADDRESS_946682] Recruitment for Training : During the trial start-up period , each site was approved 
to obtain consent from up to approxim ately  [ADDRESS_946683] and additional clinical exam s. Consent was obtained from pi[INVESTIGATOR_697370], including 1 -week and 30 -day clinical follow -up. A sample pi[INVESTIGATOR_697371] v3.2 of the AVERT protocol document, but has been removed from the main trial protocol (v4.0) . The 
consent procedure for these pi[INVESTIGATOR_697372] s from the full study participants, and the consent form 
and procedure identif ied the specific aspects  of the study in which the patients were  participating (which var ies 
during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_49149]). The rationale for having a flexible pi[INVESTIGATOR_697373]: (1) staged beta testing  of 
data collection instruments and procedures  – for the initial patients we did a very limited data collection to test 
the consent procedures, electronic data capture forms and data transfers; subsequent patients went  through the 
full 1 -month data collection protocol, including follow -up; the final group of patients will comple te the entire 
protocol, including randomization to VOG care; (2) availability of funds for follow -up testing  – we sought  to 
test the procedures for scheduling and conducting these exam s at each site, but did not have sufficient funds for 
all pi[INVESTIGATOR_697374] -up advanced testing  (MRI, vestibular lab tests) . 
4.3.5 Consent/Ethics:  Patients  will be offered enrollment using a standard written consent procedure. A sample 
AVERT (main) trial consent is provided in the Appendix. For the main trial, consent will be obtained during 
screening with enrollment into the trial occurring at the time of ra ndomization. The testing involves minimal 
risk, ide ntical to that in routine specialty care (neuro -otologic exam). Randomization is ethical because we are 
in research equipoise: (1) eye movement approaches to diagnosis are established63; (2) the VOG device has 
proven measurement accuracy52,53,64,65; but (3) the impact of VOG on clinical management and outcomes is 
uncertain. We will obtain VOG in all patients, then randomize to disclosure ( VRT ) or non -disclosure (standard 
care). The ethical nature of non -disclosure in diagnostic trials has been discussed in detail by [CONTACT_697459].66 
The key reasons why such trials are considered ethical are t hat (1) patients are not being denied anything of 
known value, (2) disclosure may cause harm, and (3) subjects consented to the conditions of non -disclosure.66 
Trial risks and safety of head impulses (routine in specialty care) are summarized in Section [ADDRESS_946684]. Joseph Mercy Hea lth System. The second consent will be obtained at the time of the 
approximately 1 -week follow -up visit at the University of Michigan for the University of Michigan activities.  
This is because the two sites operate under different IRB structures, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] t heir institutional affiliation.  
4.3.6 Randomization:  Patients who meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria using the above screening 
procedures and who provide consent will be randomized. AVERT randomization will initially assign each 
patient to a block size of 2 or 4, with a 50 -50 probability; all site personnel will be masked to this block 
assignment. Then, when the patient is determined to be eligible for the study, the patient will be randomized 
using VISION’s randomization framework, stratified  by [CONTACT_697460], so that all patients assigned to size 
“2” are randomized in blocks of 2 and all patients assigned to “4” are randomized in blocks of [ADDRESS_946685] the next assi gnment, as they will not know which 
patients are in which block.  
VISION’s just -in-time randomization framework generates each random treatment at the moment a patient is 
randomized, instead of reading from a pre -computed table of treatments. This automatic ally compensates for 
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946686] the next 
“toss” better than 50% of the time.  
4.3.7 Masking (blinding):  Allocation will be known to SC, ED provider(s) , and patients (VOG result added to 
the medi cal record in the intervention arm) , in order to guide management in the ED . This allocation will also 
be known to a small number of personnel at the CC, including members of the biostatistics team. The 
Investigator will become unmasked to allocation status for patients  who have completed their final diagnosis 
adjudicati on as part of the iterative VRT algorithm refinement process (see Section 5.1.1 ). Since this is a 
diagnostic (not therapeutic) trial, masking is most crucial for outcome assessors, who will adjudicate final 
diagnoses ‘offline ,’ masked to allocation status . Procedures will be  used to ensure maximal masking of the Final 
Diagnosis Adjudication Committee (FDAC) members  to trial allocation . In particular, all testing protocols are 
the same between the two arms of the study other than the requir ed “safety MRI” in the VRT arm (Figure 1). 
The risk of unmasking of allocation therefore relates to patients in the standard care arm who do not undergo 
clinical MRI. The FDAC process will proceed in two discrete stages separated in time: (1) based solely on ED 
index visit dat a without  the safety MRI; (2) based on all clinical data through the 30 -day follow -up. Study 
radiologists will be masked to the index visit scan purpose /type  (“safety MRI” vs. “pathway MRI” vs. “clinical 
MRI”), so the presence or absen ce of an imaging study will not cue them to the allocation during the first stage 
of FDAC review. During the second stage of review, study radiologists will reference any prior imaging studies 
using standard language that prevents disclosure to the other FDAC members whether a prior imaging study 
was or was not available (e.g., “The present study was compared to any prior studies, if available, and revealed 
no evidence of interval change.” ). The actual FDAC review will occur approximately [ADDRESS_946687], they are instructed not to indicate this to the remaining FDAC members.  
 
5.         STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
 
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration  
5.1.1 Study Structure & Flow:  Detailed study flow is illustrated in Figure [ADDRESS_946688] decision will occur in real time, 
final adjudicated (correct) diagnoses will be determined by a masked, multidisciplinary panel of physicians 
using clinical data from the ED Index V isit, 1-week, and 30 -day follow -up. Data from the 6 -month follow -up 
(funds permitting ) will not be used for primary trial outcome measures.  
It is pre -specified that the VRT algorithm will be adjusted during the study period. Because this algorithm has 
not been used before in this specific study population, optimal cut points for various algorithmic parameters can 
only be approximated  prior to the trial . The plan for adapting the algorithm will be refined during the logistical 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_189914], in close con cert with the study’s biostatistical team. The general plan is to adapt the algorithm 
frequently near the beginning of the trial, and progressively less frequently during the course of the trial.  The 
algorithm will be adapted during the logistical pi[INVESTIGATOR_697375]. The algorithm will be adapted during the main trial at pre -specified 
intervals  that will be identified in the statistical analysis plan following the logistical pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731].  In the event of 
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946689] is selected for the patient (see section 5.1.3) . 
5.1.2 Study Flow (timing):  Patients will be directly engaged at three  or four  time points : (1) ED Index Visit , (2) 
1-week clinic follow -up, (3) 1-month  phone follow -up, and (4) 6 -month phone follow -up. After consent, 
screening d ata collection burden early in the ED Index Visit  is anticipated to be ~ 30-45 min. Additional 
research data will be gathered after patients are randomized (another ~30 min).  In our prior observational 
studies,[ADDRESS_946690]  gathered research data from patients up to 60 min continuously. Total patient data collection 
burden in follow -up is anticipated to be approximately  6 hours, the bulk of which will occur during an on -site 1 -
week ‘gold standard’ follow -up visit: <1.5 hours for MRI; <3 hours for VOG, vestibular expert exam, repeating 
survey instruments; 1 hour for round trip travel; and 0.[ADDRESS_946691] for the index visit  and subsequent 30 day s of follow -up. An 
additional phone follow -up will be made at 6 months to ascertain stroke diagnoses  (funds permitting ). 
 
Figure 2. AVERT Trial  flow (expanded) . ED = emergency department; ENT = ear, nose, and throat physician; R = randomization; 
VOG = video -oculography; WK = week . VOG -guided  rapid triage (VRT) selects one of three predetermined care pathways using 
decision rules implemente d as a computer -based algorithm  (detailed rules to be used and modified as neede d):  
a) If the VOG algorithm diagnosis is peripheral , the research team will request that the ED provider  treat and discharge  the patient , followed 
by [CONTACT_50426] -day safety MRI . Treatment will be applied for VOG -based BPPV diagnoses by [CONTACT_3462], while recommendations for medical 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_697376] -based other peripheral diagnoses (e.g., vestibular sedative treatments with or without steroid 
therapy  for vestibular neuritis ). ED providers may choo se to go ‘off protocol’ and insist on admission for safety, and may choose to consult 
an ENT physician , vestibular physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] , or other provider  (optional) for treatment of BPPV, vestibular neuritis, or other peripheral 
vestibular disorder. Safety MRIs will occur after an ED disposition decision is made (discharge, observation, admission). To optimize 
integration of VOG care pathways into local care delivery mechanisms, decisions regarding precise timing and location of immediate, same -
day MRIs (<24 hours) were  adapted to each site’s specific needs during the pre -trial logistical pi[INVESTIGATOR_32731].  
b) If the VOG diagnosi s is equivocal , the research team will request that the ED pro vider order a neurology consultation , with subsequent 
management determined by [CONTACT_697461].  The requirement for neurology consultation may be waived in cases where 
doing so could not feasibly be accomplished within a reasonable time frame  (e.g., at a site where on -site neurology consultation is not 
routinely available) ; in such a case, the ED provider would determine subsequent management without the assistance of a neurologist.  ED 
providers  may choose to go “off protocol” and consult an ENT physician, vestibular physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or other provider (optional) for  
treatment of BPPV, vestibular n euritis, or other peripheral vestibular disorder if they believe the patient has an inner ear disease.  
c) If the VOG diagnosis is central , the research team will request that the ED provider order a neurology consultation , neuroimaging (MRI), 
and admit the patient for further evaluation and testing , even if the ED provider believes the patient has a peripheral cause ; a note to this 
effect will be placed in the patient’s medical chart as part of the research record . The ED provider will make the final decision whether to 
admit the patient. If the ED provider elects to discharge the patient, this would be documented as  a protocol deviation.  The neurology 
consultation may be obtained after inpatient admission, if logistical circumstances in the ED or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697377]. ED providers may choose 
to go “off protocol” and consult an ENT physician , vestibular physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or other provider  (optional) for treatment of BPPV, 
vestibular neuritis, or other peripheral vestibular disorder  if they believe the patient has an inner ear disease .

Both Trial Arms (pre -randomization & follow -up): VOG exam determines eligibility  
• patient approached for consent as early as possible during ED visit; randomization occurs after VOG testing  
• algorithm exam protocol (HINTS -Hallpi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] -Hearing) is a ~20 -minute data collection in the ED by [CONTACT_16274] 
• uses commercially -available recording equipment (portable VOG device, audiometer, tablet computer)  
• examination protocol is standard in neuro -otologic specialty pract ice 
• systematic 1 -week (visit), 30-day (phone, records), follow -up post randomization  
 
Trial Arm 1 VRT  (intervention arm): VOG -based  logic rules determine rapid triage pathway  
• report includes direct device output (physiologic traces, quantitative measures) plus most likely diagnosis, 
category, and clinical trial care pathway (peripheral, equivocal, central) instructions  
• the VOG results  become  part of the patient’s clinical record  
 
The roles of the ED provider  in the care of patients in the VOG arm will be as follows:  
• assess illness severity and appropriateness of the patient for VOG testing and the study protocol  
• exclude obvious general me dical conditions  
• take over diagnostic decision -making for patients in whom VOG is equivocal  (with consultant input , if available ) 
• intervene to deviate from VRT pathway  if they are concerned about safety for patients in the VOG arm

     13  5.1.3 Expert  Human VRT Double -Check : The VRT algorithm outputs in the intervention arm will be double -
checked by [CONTACT_697462] -otology fellows or faculty in real time  to ensure accuracy; human judgment will 
“trump” VRT if there is disagreement  (or if, for technical reasons, the real -time algorithm is not able to be 
generated – for example, as with internet connectivity problems  or during development ). The expert human 
double -check procedure will be in place at the start of the main trial, and we anticipate it will remain in place 
until the VRT algorithm is refined (as per pre -specified  adaptations during the trial period) such that it appears 
accurate and safe.  
 
Proced urally, t he patient will be randomized electronically, with their VRT algorithm diagnosis determined 
electronically . If the patient is randomized to the VRT (intervention) arm , the on -call expert reviewer at the 
Coordinating Center will be notified (regard less of site) and the entire VOG recording will be available for 
immediate review and playback, in real time , along with key historical data . The review process is expected to 
take ~[ADDRESS_946694] care arm (only those in the VRT arm).  
 
In the VRT arm, the  selected diagnosis is linked to the prespecified management recommendation per 
diagnosis.  If the ED provider has any concerns with VRT -diagnostic category or specified management , they 
will be given the opportunity to  talk with  the reviewing vestibular specialist, if applicable , and if so desired.  For 
as long  as this human double -check procedure remains in place, any VRT -arm care recommended by [CONTACT_697463] -indicated for billing purposes.  For 
example, if the VRT algorithm suggests the patien t has a vestibular neuritis, but the human reviewer changes 
the category to stroke,  then the prespecified management pathways (including the stroke -related care ) is 
considered clinically -indicated (e.g., ED index visit MRI, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]). Alternatively, i f the VRT 
algorithm returns an “equivocal” result and the expert reviewer changes the category to a specific  vestibular 
condition , then the pres pecified pathway for the vestibular condition (e.g ., requires vestibular function testing 
for Menière’s disease) will also be considered clinically -indicated .

6.2 Timing of Evaluations  
6.2.1 Screening & Recruitment:  Screening & recruitment is the start of the screening process and begins when 
the study team identi fies or is notified of a potentially eligible subject. Consent will be obtained prior to 
performing VOG to determine trial eligibility. The potential  research subject will be informed as part of the 
consent discussion that the screening procedures will det ermine eligibility for the trial and that signing the 
consent form does not constitute enrollment into the trial.  
6.2.2 ED Index Visit & Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  The acute phase of the protocol is defined as day one (day of 
randomization) through ED discharge or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. All subjects randomized to the V RT arm will 
undergo study -specific procedures as outlined in Table 1 above. Randomization , which is determined by [CONTACT_697465],  will occur immediately after eligibility screening if  all eligibility crite ria are met.  
6.2.3 1 -Week Clinic  Follow -up: The follow -up phase of the protocol begins during the week following the ED 
Index Visit . All enrollees will undergo a ‘gold standard’ battery of tests during week [ADDRESS_946696] stroke is roughly 3 -7 days after the onset of continuous dizziness or vertigo 
symptoms, although MRI -DWI detects acute stroke with high sensitivi ty out to 14 days or longer. We will 
define “T0” (time zero) as the time when dizziness symptoms began or most recently worsened, leading to the 
ED index visit. We will define “T1” as the ED registration time at the ED index visit. Follow -up MRI should 
not occur prior to 72 hours after ‘T0’ to reduce the odds of a false negative follow -up MRI scan for those with 
stroke . The target window for MRI is 3 -7 days after T0, but up to 14 days will be considered acceptable  for the 
purposes of inclusion in the primar y outcome analysis (see Statistical Analysis Plan below) . If T0 is unknown or 
uncertain, we will use time from T1 to determine the appropriate follow -up window . For scheduling purposes, 
the [ADDRESS_946697] 
timing, this visit will be known as the “1 -Week” or “Week -1” follow -up visit.  
6.2.4 30 -Day Phone Follow -up: All subjects will complete a phone interview 30 days (+/- 7 days) after the ED 
Index Visit. In the event that no 6 -month follow -up is possible ( e.g., due to funds limitations), the subject will 
be instructed that this is the final visit.  30-day phone follow -up (~20 -30 min) will repeat symptom  and quality -
of-life measures  (see Schedule of Evaluations ) and determine hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697380] -related 
diagnoses (e.g., stroke, aneurysm, heart attack) . We will review relevant medical records for vascular events, 
outpatient visits  (particularly neurology or ot olaryngology) , ED visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and neuroimaging.  
Regardless of exact timing, this visit will be known as the “30 -Day” or “1 -Month” follow -up visit . 
6.2.5  6-Month  Phone Follow -up: Funds permitting, all subjects will complete a phone interview 6 months (+/ - 1 
month) after the ED Index Visit.  The subject will be instructed that this is the final visit. The [ADDRESS_946698] to follow -up at this time point , we will search the National Death Index 
(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ndi/index.htm ) using  the patient’s social security number  or other identifiers  to 
determine the patient’s vital status  and cause of death , if available . 
 
6.3 Special Instructions and Definitions of Evaluations  
6.3.1 Consent : The informed consent process will occur  during pre-screening , and must be completed  prior to 
screening VOG testi ng. A signature [CONTACT_697550]. Only 
after informed consent has been signed and all relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria have been met can a patient 
be randomized or enrolled  in the observational  arm of the  study.  
Informed consent must be obtained from the patient. Patients will not be enrolled  if consent cannot be obtained.   
The study center wil l document the informed consent process and the signing of the consent form in a written 
progress note, place a signed copy of the consent form in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18080] , and keep the signed 
original consent form in the study subject file. A signed co py must be given to the subject as well. The study 
monitor will review and confirm the signed consent form while reviewing subject data collection forms and/or 
during monitoring visits  (which may be conducted remotely or on site) . 
6.3.2 Structured Symptom History : SCs will gather standard identifying, demographic, and meta -data (e.g., 
triage severity); key clinical parameters related to dizziness  (e.g., symptom onset, timing, triggers, type42), 
associated symptoms  (e.g., tinnitus, hearing loss, other neurological symptoms), and key past medical history .  
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     16  6.3.3 Vertigo Symptom Scale – short form  (VSS-SF166): The VSS -SF incorporates two sub -scales with 8 items 
relating to  vertigo -balance and 7 items relating to autonomic anxiety symptoms. Severe dizziness is defined as 
≥12 points on the total scale. Subjects will complete the VSS -SF at baseline and 1-month  visit.  
6.3.4 ABCD2 Vascular R isk Score167: The ABCD2 score will be calculated  to determine the risk for stroke in the 
days following the  ED index visit.  This measure will likely be incorporated into the initial diagnostic algorithm.  
6.3.5 NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) : The NIHSS will be done by a certified examiner during screening or shortly 
after randomization  and then repeated at the 1 -week visit.  
6.3.6 Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) : SARA is an [ADDRESS_946699] (CALFRAST) : CAL FRAST is a rapid bedside assessment 
for hearing loss using finger rubbing. Results of this test at the ED Index Visit will be used as part of the 
diagnostic algorithm. The test will be followed post -randomization by [CONTACT_697466]. We will obtain formal, lab -based audiometry at [ADDRESS_946700] during the follow -up bedside exam, for comparison to audiometry . 
6.3.8  Subjective Visual Vertical (SVV ): Measurement of the patient’s SVV is a routine part of bedside and 
laboratory vestibular testing. This psychophysical test assesses the patient’s perception of verticality. At the ED 
Index Visit, testing will be accomplished using a standard ‘bucket test.’[ADDRESS_946701], the examiner holds 
a large bucket in front of the patient’s face so that they are peering at the floor of the bucket. A straight line is 
displayed in the floor of the bucket. As the examiner rotates the bucket slowly, the patient is as ked to notify the 
examiner when they believe the line to be completely vertical (i.e. parallel to gravity). The bucket is pre -
calibrated, and the examiner records how far from true vertical the bucket line is when the patient believes the 
line is vertical.  The test will be repeated at the 1-week follow -up. Depending on site -specific procedures, tests 
may be performed using the bucket, a mechanical light bar (see Laboratory -based vestibular testing), or both . 
6.3.9 Portable VOG – HINTS -Hallpi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] : Using the IC S Impulse 3-dimensional VOG (horizontal -vertical -
torsional  channels), trained SCs will record eye movements, including VOR gain ( horizontal head impulses); 
nystagmus―spontaneous (with, without fixation), gaze -evoked, positional (Dix -Hallpi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] [Nylen -Bárány]  plus 
supi[INVESTIGATOR_697381]50), head shaking104; and eye alignment (alternate cover for skew deviation60).  
As per standard practice, testing will occur under conditions of visual fixation and with vision denied. Vision 
will be denied using the manufacturer’s FDA -approved disposable occluder and eyepatch or a study -designed 
drape affixed to a simple plastic headband. The manufacturer’s  disposable vision denied solution is comprised 
of one sticky  patch that is fully opaque for the non -test (left) eye and a cup inserted into the goggles frame that 
allows the infrared camera to record eye movement  in the recording (right) eye . Both pi[INVESTIGATOR_81882] a mild 
adhesive backing and are applied to the orbital rim of each eye. The materials have  passed biocompatibility 
testing. After testing, the patches are gently removed by [CONTACT_697467].  The study -
designed external drape is intended to speed testing during recruitment by [CONTACT_697468], affix the adhesive patches, replace the goggles, recalibrate, and the n remove the adhesive patches.  
During testing, we will record video images of the eye movement examination for the following purposes: (1) 
final diagnosis adjudication  for the main trial outcome of diagnosis accuracy ; (2) monitoring adherence to trial 
examination protocols; (3 ) additional research questions (e.g., concordance between expert eye movement 
interpretation and results of quantitative recordings and algorithmic interpretation ; assessing head tilt and ocular 
counter -roll as signs of central vs. peripheral disease ); and (3) generating an educational library of teaching 
videos, as articulated in the AVERT grant proposal.  Images will includ e the following: eye -only videos (non -

     17  identifiable), room camera videos of most  test procedures (potentially identifiable), partial -face close -up eye 
movement exams (potentially identifiable), and full -head/face images for head tilt (identifiable).  
Identif iable images will only be used outside the research study team (e.g., for education or academic 
publication) if the subject elects this option when signing the  consent .  
6.3.10 Portable Audiometry : SCs will use  portable audiometry headphones to record hear ing in each ear  (air and 
bone conduction thresholds) . SCs will be properly trained in hearing testing and assessment (e.g., conductive vs. 
sensorineural loss). Tympanograms/acoustic reflexes will be obtained at [ADDRESS_946702] reliability and validity relative to lab audiometry.   
6.3.11 General  Self-Rated Health Status : We will use two single -item general self -rated health measures to 
assess current health status and recent changes in health status  at baseline, 1 -week, and 1 -month . 
6.3.12 Dizziness Handicap Inventory – Screening  (DHI -S169): The DHI -S is a 10-item, self -reported, screening 
version of the full DHI an d will be used to identify difficulties that the subject may be experiencing because of 
dizziness or unsteadiness.  Subjects will complete the DHI -S at baseline, the 1 -week visit and the 1-month  visit.  
6.3.13 Simplified modified Rankin Scale questionnaire (smRSq) : The smRSq is a shorter, telephone -enabled 
version of the standard modified Rankin stroke -related disability score. The smRSq will be assessed at baseline 
and at the 1 -week and 1 -month follow -up visit s to determine a mRS score.  
6.3.1 4 Neuro -QoL: The Neuro -QoL is a set of self -report measures that assess health -related quality of life by 
[CONTACT_697469], concerns, and issues that are relevant across different neurological disorders. Subjects 
will co mplete multiple short form items from the Neuro -QoL at the 1 -week visit.  
6.3.1 5 RAND 36 -Item Health Survey ( RAND -[ZIP_CODE] v1.0): The RAND -36 uses 36 questions to measure 
functional health and well -being. Subjects will complete the RAND -36 at the 1-month follow -up. This 
instrument is made up of the same 36 questions as the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (MOS SF -36) but 
uses a different scoring algorithm ( http:// www.rand.org/health/surveys_tools/mos/36 -item-short -form.html ). 
6.3.16 Charlson Comorbidity Index  (CCI): The CCI is a composing scoring measure of medical comorbidity 
based on the presence or absence of 19 specific conditions and the patient’s age. The CCI  will be assessed at the 
ED Index Visit and updated at 1-month based on medical chart review.  
6.3.17 MRI pre -screen : All patients will complete a n abbreviated  set of questions related to magnetic resonance 
(MR) pre-procedure screening during the Screening & Recruitment period to determine eligibility. Patients with 
known contraindications to MR imaging will be excluded from the trial. For those randomized, s tandard MRI 
pre-screening will occur per local institutional policies prior to safety (ED Index) or r esearch (1 -week) MRI.  
6.3.18 MRI : ED Index Visit  MRIs differ from Week-1 research follow -up visit MRIs (Table 2).  To maximize 
trial safety, all patients in the VOG arm of the study will undergo stroke protocol (safety ; 1.5 T esla) MRI  with 
non-contrast MRA  to minimize risk that a patient is erroneously discharged with a stroke . VRT -arm subjects 
with suspected central l esions will be admitted for stroke care and undergo clinical stroke protocol MRI  with 
MRA  as part of the required trial care pathway. VOG care patients slated for discharge will undergo same -day 
safety MRI  if they have not had a clinical MRI . Stroke -protocol images (for safety or based on pathway VRT -
C) will not be specifically adjusted or harmonized for the research study; they will use standard clinical 
protocols, so as to minimize clinical disruption in the ED and radiology  department . Althou gh the protocol 
requests a non -contrast MRI/A (to minimize total contrast dose, in light of Week-[ADDRESS_946703] -enhanced MRI), the 
patient’s clinical providers may request contrast -enhanced imaging be added if clinically indicated  for patients 
without contrain dications to contrast . All enrollees will undergo a  Week-[ADDRESS_946704] ([ADDRESS_946705])  MRI (stroke, internal auditory canal sequences pre -/post -contrast , if applicable ). A 1.[ADDRESS_946706] posterior fossa stroke as

     18  well as other posterior fossa and vestibular lesions (e.g., demyelinating lesio ns, cerebellar tumor, acoustic 
neuroma ). The Week-1 research MRI acquisition protocol was adapted at the start of the study for each site’s 
MRI technology (GE vs. Siemens, 3 Tesla) by [CONTACT_697470]. The optimal MRI window is 
describe d in 6.2.[ADDRESS_946707] 72 hours after onset of symptoms. MRI sensitivity (using diffusion -
weighted imaging [DWI ] optimized for stroke detection) rises sharply in the first few hours after the onset of 
stroke symptoms. False negative scans are more frequent in the first 24 hours after onset of posterior fossa 
stroke symptoms than in the subsequent period from 24 -72 hours after onset. MRI sensitivity is about 80%29 
<24 hours and about 86%73 <72 hours. Maximal MRI sensitivity (~99%73) is achieved after about 72 hours, and 
is maintained at a high level until ~[ADDRESS_946708] MRI scans were obtained within the 14 -day period will be 
included as part of the primary analysis for the main trial outcome  (see Statistical Analysis Plan below) . 
Oral anxiolytic therapy may be offered to subjects per local institutional policy who have MRI anxiety.  This 
will be documented in the subject’s record and same -day follow -up assessments that may be affected by 
[CONTACT_697471] (e.g., vestibular testing)  must be completed prior to anxiolytic administration.  
MRIs will be read by [CONTACT_697472], masked study neuro -radiologists. For safety, all 1-week study MRIs will 
also be read clinically as an urgent ED scan by [INVESTIGATOR_2394] -site clinical radiologists .  
Standardization MRIs  (normal volunteers, occurred only during protocol refinement phase) : The MRI 
acquisition protocol was adapted for each of the study center’s MRI technology (GE vs. Siemens, 1.5 Tesla vs. 
3 Tesla) by [CONTACT_697473] h an MRI physicist . To ensure that MRIs for 
the [ADDRESS_946709] study were harmonized across sites, the MRI personnel from the CC visited each 
study center and collaborated with the local MRI personnel. This process involved scans obtained from both a  
“phantom” (non -human or animal impregnated gel) and 1 -4 human volunteer subjects (inclusive of study staff 
from the CC to allow for the same person(s) to undergo MRI scanning at each site to enhance MRI 
standardization across sites). Each volunteer underw ent MRI (see Table 2 for sequences) for 60 -180 minutes 
depending on the progress of the harmonization process. Scanner settings were adjusted during this time until 
optimal settings were obtained. This protocol differe d from the final protocol for the pati ents enrolled in the 
AVERT Trial ; no gadolinium was used , negating the need for IV access and assessment of kidney function.

6.3.1 9 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] : The ED provider  determine s if admission is necessary for the standard care pathway. 
The research team will request that the ED provider admit eligible subjects randomized to VRT  whose VOG 
diagnosis is ‘central’  at the ED Index Visit. Those whose  VOG diagnosis is ‘equivocal’ will have hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697383] a neurologist , when available . Those whose 
VOG diagnosis is ‘peripheral’ will be discharged after safety MRI, unless the ED provider  decides to ad mit ‘off 
protocol’ for safety.  
6.3.20 Neuro -otology examination : All subjects will undergo a focused neuro -otology examination at the 1 -
week visit to evaluate ongoing and new clinical symptoms since the ED Index Visit, to assess the likely 
diagnosis,  and to provide any necessary referrals or communication with other providers.  
6.3.21 Laboratory -based vestibular testing : All subjects will undergo formal vestibular testing at the [ADDRESS_946711] clinical vestibular testing battery (~3 hours) will include the following:  
1. Subjective visual vertical (SVV) testing  
This test requires the patient to re-position a mechanical light bar so it is oriented upright.  Depending 
on site -specific procedures, this may occur using the ‘bucket test’ (described above).  
2. Video -oculography (VOG) saccade accuracy testing  
This test requires the patient  to look from side  to side.   
3. Video -oculography (VOG) head impulse testing (vHIT), [ADDRESS_946712] involves ~[ADDRESS_946713] of each semicircular canal.  
4. Video -nystagmography ( VNG ) with caloric testing . 
This test involves a series of maneuvers designed to elicit nystagmus. These include looking side to 
side, blocking visual fixation, passive head shaking, positional tests (Dix -Hallpi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], supi[INVESTIGATOR_697384]), and 
bithermal caloric testing (warm and cold water inst illed into the ear canal)  while supi[INVESTIGATOR_050] .  
5. Vestibular -evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs), cervical (c -VEMPs) and ocular (o -VEMPs) . 
Both tests are performed supi[INVESTIGATOR_697385] -invasive, surface electrodes to measure neck and eye 
motor responses to auditory,  vibratory, or forehead ‘tappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]’ stimuli. The c -VEMPs  test requires 
patients to lift or turn their heads against resistance to activate the sternomastoid muscle; they may 
also be asked to clench their teeth to activate the jaw muscles and to look at a fix ed target. The 
o-VEMPs test does not require any sustained patient effort. Tone bursts will be presented 
unilaterally to the test ear through a calibrated audiometric speaker or bone conduction vibrator at a 
varied stimulation rate to obtain thresholds for  response. In order to test utricular function, VEMP 
responses to midline forehead taps will be measured. The stimulus consists of a brief acceleration of 
the head imparted to the forehead with a neurological reflex hammer or a mechanical device (a 
short -distance tappi[INVESTIGATOR_697386] a repeated tap at set time intervals).  
 
SVV, VNG with caloric testing and VEMPs will be performed at all sites where clinical appointments are 
readil y available, and at the same location as the rest of the follow up visit. Sites with logistical constraints for 
getting these tests will perform them on a time permitting basis at follow -up.  
 
6.3.22 Laboratory -based audiometry : All subjects will undergo f ormal audiometry testing at the 1 -week visit. 
Pure tone thresholds at 500 Hz through 8000 Hz will be measured in addition to speech reception threshold and 
speech discrimination score. Testing will be  performed in a sound -proof booth with a clinical audiom eter. 
Tympanometry (test of middle ear compliance during changes in external auditory canal pressure and during 
comfortable -level sounds applied by [CONTACT_697474]/acoustic reflex function)

     20  6.3.23 Emergency Department Patient Experiences with Care  (EDPEC) : An abridged version of t he EDPEC  
survey  (https://www.cms.gov/Research -Statistics -Data -and-Systems/Research/CAHPS/ed.html ) using questions 
focused on overall experience will be completed by [CONTACT_697475] 1-week follow -up visit to 
provide their perspectives on the care they received during the ED Index Visit.  
6.3.24 Resource utilization : SCs will record the number and type of brain imaging studies, consultations, and 
admissions, as wel l as ED length of stay. They will note key process measures such as whether patients are 
treated with anti -vertigo medications or undergo specific canalith repositioning therapy.  
We will track use of higher -cost services likely to be impacted by [CONTACT_697476] a t ED visit and in follow -up 
(radiology/lab tests, physician consultations, admissions). Costs will be based on national average Medicare 
reimbursement (commonly used in cost analyses170), or, as needed, average consortium costs.  
6.3.[ADDRESS_946714] review : Medical records will be accessed at the ED Index Visit to identify relevant 
medical conditions related to inclusion/exclusion parameters or critical study covariates. SCs will review 
medical records for baseline medical comorbidities (and any acquired duri ng the 30 -day follow -up period), 
ED/hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/outpatient healthcare visits, and major medical events ( falls, hip fractures, vascular events [stroke, 
myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism] , and test or treatment complications  related to 
studies/inter ventions during the study period (ED Index through 1 -month) .  
6.3.2 6 Canalith repositioning treatment for  BPPV : For patients in the VRT arm with an algorithmic, VOG -
derived diagnosis of BPPV, SCs will provide standard, evidence -based guideline -recommended canalith 
repositioning treatments.49,50 These maneuvers are simple and routinely per formed by [CONTACT_697477][INVESTIGATOR_697387]. All SCs will be trained to provide canalith repositioning for posterior 
canal BPPV via the modified Epley canalith repositioning maneuver (a [ADDRESS_946715] position). SCs with more experience will also perform horizontal canal canalith repositioning 
treatments (e.g., the Lempert roll maneuver, which is similar to the Epley but with the chin tucked forward 
rather than head hanging  back ). No treatments for anterior canal BPPV will be applied by [CONTACT_283784], as our current 
VOG algorithm dictates that patients with positional downbeat nystagmus are diagnosed as presumed to have 
central lesions until proven otherwise by [CONTACT_95425] ; if this aspect of  the VOG algorithm is modified during 
the course of the study, only SCs with adequate experience or training in treatment of anterior canal BPPV will 
apply the appropriate maneuvers . Our standard approach will be the one typi[INVESTIGATOR_697388]: 
to apply the treatment maneuver up to three times or until the nystagmus has resolved on positional testing. The 
treatments will be provided under  VOG guidance ―the VOG tracks the three -dimensional position of the head 
in space, and notifies the user if the patient’s head angles are not in the appropriate planes/locations. This will 
increase the accuracy of treatments  by [CONTACT_697478]. It will also provide an internal check on 
accuracy and effectiveness of treatment procedures, as the VOG tr aces and videos from the treatments will be 
reviewed by [CONTACT_114890] -otologists for correct technique and correct results (based on nystagmus patterns). At any 
time, the ED provider  may go ‘off protocol’ for any safety or treatment effectiveness concerns and requ est an 
ENT or physical therapy consultant to perform the maneuvers instead of (or in addition to) the SC.  Similar 
treatments will be applied at the [ADDRESS_946716] BPPV symptoms and findings.  
7.    RISKS  
This is a low -risk study who se properties generally do not exceed that typi[INVESTIGATOR_697389] (bedside exam using the standard of care in neuro -otology/vestibular neurology; MRI brain imaging using 
standard clinical protocols). Other than the risks of contrast  MRI, there are no specific procedures, situations, or 
materials that pose serious hazards to patients or personnel. Additional small risks relate to misdiagnosis and 
risks from subsequent inappropriate testing or treatments. While we hypothesize that the intervention (VOG -
guided care) will substantially reduce the risks of misdiagnosis, we are in equipoise regarding the possibility 
that it may not, on average, prove beneficial (or that individual patients could be harmed).

EACH OF THESE TRIAL RISKS IS DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW  
 
7. I. Risks of disclosure of PHI  
 
These risks are minimal, since data security protections (described in Data and Safety Monitoring below) are in 
place and the data we are gathering will, in general, not be of a particularly sensitive nature.  
 
7. II. Risks from delays in care  
 
A theoretic al risk is that clinical care will be delayed because of interference by [CONTACT_697479]. As in all 
of our previous ED -based studies,4,15,21,33,71-74 clinical care needs will always take precedence over our research 
investigations. SCs will be trained to stop their testing immediately if clinical care is needed. There will be no 
delay in administration of any treatment or procedure, including administration of thrombolytic 
medications for stroke, should this be the ED provider ’s manageme nt decision . Since testing will all 
happen ‘in situ’ within the ED, there will be no delays associated with patient transport. Likewise, since we will 
only recruit during shifts when SCs are stationed in the ED, there will be no delays incurred related to SC 
notification or travel prior to assessing the patient as part of the study protocol.  
 
Another theoretical risk is that care will be delayed because the VOG test results are part of the diagnostic 
process for VOG care. The total testing time for pre-randomization screening  is expected to be about 30-45 
minutes, but this will occur ‘around’ the usual ED care by [CONTACT_13922] , providers and nurses, as described in the 
prior paragraph.  The VOG component of the testing will take approximately 20 minutes continuo usly, but could 
be interrupted for clinical care.  In other words, VOG care will not lengthen the time of an ED provider ’s 
initial assessment or management, or delay its onset . The VOG diagnosis may identify a stroke missed by 
[CONTACT_697480]  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     22  the clinician. In such cases, VOG could  speed identification of stroke (i.e., relative to waiting for neurology 
consultation or neuroimaging), shortening (not lengthening ) the time to early stroke ther api[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
 
7. III. Risks of VOG with HIT  
 
7. III. 1 Overview of Video -oculography (VOG) : VOG has been used for 20 years (since the early 1990s) to 
measure eye movements during vestibular testing both in a laboratory75 and clinical setting.[ADDRESS_946718] eye position (usually throug h algorithms that recognize and track the location of 
the pupil). The pupil location, representing eye position, is then tracked in horizontal and vertical directions 
(some systems , including ours,  track torsional eye movements, but real -time torsional mea sures are not as 
accurate77). This is generally accomplished using a set of goggles with a small, infrared camera pointed at the 
eye. Prior iterations of such goggles looked similar to a large dive mask. More rece nt iterations are more 
compact and look more like swim goggles. These have enabled new forms of testing, described further below.  
 
Eye movement exams for specific forms of nystagmus during positional testing represent the gold -standard 
diagnostic tool in B PPV.48,[ADDRESS_946719] made device -based diagnosis of stroke attainable:  
1. HIT (1988) : Halmagyi and Curthoys developed the horizontal head impulse test (h -HIT) of vestibulo -ocular 
reflex (VOR) function to assess vestibular disorders.[ADDRESS_946720] could be performed qualitatively (expert 
examiner, visual inspection of eye movements) or quantitatively (lab -based recording devices).[ADDRESS_946721] has 
now been adapted to assess all semicircular canals.80  
2. HINTS (2008) : Newman -Toker and colleagues demonstrated the utility of the qualitative h -HIT by [CONTACT_697481], 
continuous dizziness (the ‘acute vestibular syndrome’).16,21 Our team recognized that strokes involving both the 
brain and laby[CONTACT_697482] h -HIT,21 so we created a 3 -step 
eye exam battery to capture the remaining cases. We labeled the beside qualitative eye examination ‘H.I.N.T.S. 
to I.N.F.A.R.C.T.’[ADDRESS_946722] 48 hours after onset.4,29,73   
3. VOG -HINTS (2009) : MacDougall et al. built a portable VOG device lightweight enough to measure the h -
HIT without goggles slippage.52,64,[ADDRESS_946723] 
publishe d detailed quantitative results and technical analyses.  
4. HINTS ‘Plus’ (2013) : Newman -Toker et al. showed that a minor modification of the HINTS decision rule is 
more sensitive for detecting stroke while losing only a small amount of specificity.73 This ‘HINTS plus’ counts 
new unilateral hearing loss in those with acute, continuous vertigo or dizziness as a predictor of stroke involving 
the inner ear (i.e., combined cochleo -laby[CONTACT_697483]). This occurs because vestib ular neuritis is 
generally without hearing loss, while the blood supply to the inner ear derives from the vertebrobasilar 
circulation, generally via the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) giving rise to the internal auditory artery.  
The ICS Impulse  device ( http://icsimpulse.com/ ) that will be used in the AVERT Trial is a lightweight, modern 
adaptation of standard VOG technology; it received FDA approval in February, 2013 via a 510(k) mechanism 
that demonstrated  it to be substantially similar to predicate VOG devices measuring vestibular function 
(http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices /productsandmedicalprocedures/deviceapprovalsandclearances/510kclearances/default.htm ).  
 
Since VOG devices can now measure the h -HIT, nystagmus (BPPV or central -type), and vertical eye 
position (skew deviation), VOG testing can now diagnose BPPV, vestibul ar neuritis, and stroke.

Note on Commercial Relationships and Choice of Device : No one on the research team ha d any commercial 
or financial interest in the ICS Impulse device (or any other VOG system)  at study start; any new commercial 
relationships (e.g., licensing the AVERT algorithm) will be disclosed per institutional policy . Here we describe 
the rationale for our choice of the ICS Impulse device ( http://icsimpulse.com/ ) over competitor products such as 
the EyeSeeCam ( http://eyeseecam.com/ ; http://www.interacoustics.com/us/vhit )  or Video Head Impulse Test 
Ulmer ( http://www.synapsys.fr/en/p -video head -impulse -test-ulmer -vhit-ulmer -48.htm ). Our choice to focus on 
using the ICS Impulse device was made for scientific rea sons. To our knowledge, only the I CS Impulse and 
EyeSeeCam devices have been validated against magnetic scleral search coil recordings (the gold standard in 
eye movement recording techniques) and are currently FDA approved for clinical use in the US. Compa nies 
producing these two devices have loaned them to our research group for research purposes. The EyeSeeCam 
has greater eye movement measurement flexibility in its current hardware and software configuration, but the 
ICS Impulse has a simpler, unibody des ign without moving or detachable parts; it is also more comfortable  for 
patients to wear . We believe these features make the ICS Impulse device more likely to be widely disseminated 
in an ED environment, so we chose to focus our initial efforts on using th is particular device. We are currently 
using the EyeSeeCam preferentially for laboratory -based studies. As long as the particular device can give 
similar measurements as described in this trial, the results should be applicable to all similar VOG devices.  
 
7. III. 2 The Impulse Maneuver : The horizontal head impulse test (h -HIT) of vestibulo -ocular reflex (VOR) 
function, as originally described in 1988,79 is a 
rapid, passive head rotation from lateral (10 -20 
degrees) to center head position as a subject 
fixates at a central target (e.g., the examiner’s 
nose). For the test to work, the head rotation 
must be passive (i.e., conducted by [CONTACT_290442]), rather than active (i.e., deliberate 
head turn by [CONTACT_102]).[ADDRESS_946724] shown that high -quality 
technique is achieved in less than 1 hour of training (Fig. 3). 
 
The HIT technique is now considered a standard part of the routine clinical exam in patients presenting with 
dizziness or vertigo.63,83 The evidence supporting its use in experienced hands is substantial.4,21,29,73,84 Our 
systematic review concluded the re was strong evidence (GRADE system85) for adequately -trained providers to 
use these findings for stroke diagnosis in AVS.[ADDRESS_946725] vestibular specialists.  
 
7. III. 3 Side Effects of HIT : It is reasonable to expect that  patients with dizziness or vertigo could have an 
exacerbation of their symptoms during the HIT, as they might with any head movement. As a consequence, 
patients may feel greater dizziness, nausea, or unsteadiness during testing or for a few seconds or min utes after 
testing is complete. The maneuver could provoke vomiting or other vagal responses. Since [ADDRESS_946726] HIT technique in <1hr with VOG  

AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946727] found that patients experience more symptoms from 
sitting up from a recumbent position in bed than from the HIT itself . This is likely because the amplitude of the 
HIT movement is so small and the stimulus duration so brie f, that it does not cause major symptoms.  
 
Those with neck arthritis (or baseline neck pain or headache) could experience mild, transient increase in pain 
during the head rotation. None of these symptoms are expected to last more than a few seconds and no ne of 
these symptoms will be greater than those expected to be brought out by [CONTACT_697484] 
(e.g., during typi[INVESTIGATOR_697390] -Hallpi[INVESTIGATOR_697391], which, unlike the HIT, is more commonly 
applied by [CONTACT_697485] c ourse of routine clinical care for patients with dizziness or vertigo).  
 
7. III. 4 Theoretical Complications of HIT : Millions of HITs have been performed by [CONTACT_697486] [ADDRESS_946728] likened  it to chiropractic neck manipulation and expressed 
concerns about the possibility of causing a vertebral artery dissection or exacerbating a pre -existing one. The 
HIT differs mechanically from cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_697392] (>45 degrees) 
with full neck extension in order to immobilize the joint at its end range of motion before applying a sudden, 
high-velocity head rotation as a therapeutic maneuver ( http://www.you tube.com/watch?v=CAVxOFftqxg , 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=endscreen&v=NVuY5vqoGyU&NR=1 ).  
 
The theoretical risk of vertebral artery injury is with far lateral  (>45 d egree) neck rotations (as may occur with 
cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_697393], but not HIT ), since studies suggest that physical traction on the vertebral artery 
only begins to occur when the head is rotated more than 30 degrees laterally, and is only substantial w hen the 
head is rotated beyond 45 degrees laterally.91,92 This mechanical risk may be further increased in chiropractic 
cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_697394] (also not done in HIT ), 
thereby [CONTACT_697487].[ADDRESS_946729] the head 10 -20 degrees laterally ( less of 
an excursion than typi[INVESTIGATOR_697395] ) and return the head 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_697396] (100 -200 degrees per second) ( http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/ehsl -
dent/id/6 , video time point 4:29 for close -up demonstration of the head impulse as performed properly).  
 
For vertical HIT (v -HIT) testing in the  RALP (right anterior, left posterior semicircular canal) and LARP (left 
anterior, right posterior semicircular canal) planes, we will displace the head 30 -40 degrees laterally53 (roughly 
the excursion typi[INVESTIGATOR_697397] e auscultation of the carotid artery ) and rotate the head 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_697398] [ADDRESS_946730] causal relationship between chiropractic neck 
manipulation and stroke linked t o cervical (carotid or vertebral) artery dissection has been postulated,[ADDRESS_946731] shown that vertebrobasilar artery 
dissection and stroke is associated with a three to five -fold increase in likelihood of having been exposed to 
recent chiropractic neck manipulation among patients age <45 years  but not those over that age.98,99 The risk of 
having visited a primary care physician in th e weeks before dissection/stroke diagnosis, however, is the same as 
the risk of having visited a chiropractor.[ADDRESS_946732] the association could be spurious, reflecting 
“confounding by [CONTACT_35151]” or “reverse causality bias” (‘vertebral dissection’ causes  ‘neck pain’ which causes  
‘chiropractic or primary care visit’… rather than ‘ neck disease ’ causes  ‘neck pain’ causes  ‘chiropractic visit’ 
which causes  ‘vertebral dissection’).96,99 Even those asserting a real association accept the absolute risk of 
dissection is low.97 The maximum estimated risk is 1 dissection per 20,000 manipulations,100 though others 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     25  sugges t the risk is much lower, between 1 per 400,000 and 1 per 1.3 million manipulations.98 Also, the presence 
of a vertebral artery dissection often has a favorable outcome  when treated appropriately .36  
 
Assuming the theoretical risk of dissection with the HIT is the same as the risk for cervical manipulation (which 
is unlikely based on the biomechanics described above), with a maximum of 180 impulses per patient ( 20 per 
canal , 2 canals at ED index and 6 at 1  week ), the total risk of a dissection would be approximately 0.01 -0.9%. 
By [CONTACT_22242], the risk of not performing the HIT in an ED patient with acute, continuous dizziness or vertigo 
presenting in the first 24 hours confers a 20% risk of missed stroke, even if every such patient is sent for an 
MRI. The 20% risk is of a false -negative MRI,[ADDRESS_946733] (other than HIT). 
Many ED patients get CT rather than MRI, so their risk of a missed stroke is probably 58 -93%.101-103 Those 
whose strokes are initially missed appear to be at much higher risk of death (40% in one case series11) so the 
absolute risk increase of d eath due to a misdiagnosis (as a consequence of not performing the HIT) could be as 
high as 35% relative to a correctly -diagnosed patient. Thus, the absolute risk of death due to missed stroke in 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_697399] (by [CONTACT_697488]) in a patient pop ulation like ours (~10 -20% strokes) may be ~1%.  
 
If we have 15% strokes in our subject pool, then even if the excess risk of death due to a delay in ED 
cerebellar stroke diagnosis is only half that reported in the literature,11 the risk of stroke -related death  
due to misdiagnosis from NOT  performing the HIT is likely greater than any hypothetical risk of 
vertebral artery dissection  from actually pe rforming the HIT to help diagnose stroke in these patients .  
 
7. III. 5 Risks of other vestibular testing (positional tests,49,50 side-to-side head shaking104): These standard 
vestibular tests used to provoke vertigo, dizziness, or nystagmus are used routinely in specialty clinical 
practice.42,105,106 Aside from an increase in symptoms (dizziness, nausea, or vomiting), there are no known risks 
of these tests. If a patient wishes not to continue with the test protocol, they may stop at any time.   
 
7. III. 6  Risks of vestibular treatments  (canalith repositioning maneuvers ): These standard vestibular treatments  
are used routinely in specialty clinical practice  and form the basis of at least two clinical practice guidelines .49,50 
Aside from an increase in symptoms (dizziness, nausea, or vomiting), there are no known significant risks of 
these procedures (Cochrane Review doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD003162.pub3).  The modified Epley maneuver  
for posterior canal BPPV is effective i n approximately  80% of acute cases, with a number needed to treat ~1.[ADDRESS_946734] been found for horizontal canal BPPV treatmen ts, 
albeit from lower -quality studies.50 If a patient wishes not to continue with the treatment  protocol, they may 
stop at any time.  If an ED provider  prefers treatment by [CONTACT_425405], they may go ‘off protocol.’  
 
7. IV. Risks of MRI testing  
 
Overall, the risks of MRI, even with contrast administration, are extremely low. None of the risks in this study 
exceed risks typi[INVESTIGATOR_697400]. Contrast 
administration is a recommended element of MRI imaging for patients with  vertigo and hearing loss.108  
7. IV. 1 Inadvertent imaging of patients with contraindications : This complication is rare with standard pre -
MRI screening procedures,[ADDRESS_946735] scan of the head (i.e., confirmed NOT  to have metal fragments) will, however, be eligible . Eligibility will 
be confirmed at each site using the standard  clinical or research pre -screening MRI questionnaires /checklists, 
per local institutional policies  (including a negative pregnancy status for all women of childbearing potential  
prior to MRI ). Patients will be pre -screened for claustrophobia  and treated w ith anxiolysis in advance as 
appropriate ; if refractory anxiety develops during the MRI, we will stop the scan.

     26  7. IV. 2 Risks of flying metallic objects : This complication is rare with standard precautions in the conduct of 
MRI testing,69,109,110 which will be followed in the AVERT Trial . 
7. IV. 3 Risks of auditory injury : This complication is rare with standard precautions,69,109,110 which will be 
followed in the AVERT Tr ial. All patients will receive hearing protection. While some clinicians consider 
immediate MRI in a patient with sudden hearing loss to be contraindicated (for risk of further noise -induced 
damage), our data suggest that patients with combined audio -vesti bular presentations to the ED are more likely 
to be the result of stroke than peripheral vestibulopathy (i.e., laby[CONTACT_697489] -vestibular neuritis).73 This 
means that the risks of further hearing loss from MRI are likely outweighed by [CONTACT_3433] e risks of missed stroke.  
7. IV. 4 Inadvertent risks of difficulty with cardiac resuscitation : Risks of difficulty with cardiac resuscitation 
are minimal since critically ill and unstable cardiac patients will be excluded.  
7. IV. [ADDRESS_946736] agents : [Note  that this risk did not apply to the MRI standardization 
volunteers because gadolinium was not administered.] Gadolinium helps identify brain, blood vessel, and 
cranial nerve pathology by [CONTACT_697490]  (e.g., due to cervical artery stenoses or dissections ), and the surrounding soft tissues.  Contrast 
administration is important in this study to identify correct etiologies for dizziness, including active multiple 
sclerosis, inflammatory balance nerve lesions, small neoplasms (e.g., cerebellar metasteses), and vascular 
stensoses responsible for stroke.  At 1-week, contrast therefore maximizes accuracy of the gold standard.  
Overall risks are minimal in patients with normal renal function70 (defined as GFR >30 mL/min/1.73 m2). For 
patients without contraindications , we will use a gadolinium -based contrast agent to be administered 
intravenously at a dose of 0.1 mM/kg body weight using a power injector at a rate of 2cc/sec. This agent has 
been approved by [CONTACT_697491]. The amount is considered a “single 
dose”, and is typi[INVESTIGATOR_697401]. We will minimize excess dosing by 
[CONTACT_697492].  
Insertion of an intravenous catheter for injection may cause minor pain, bruising and/or infection at the injection 
site. Transient side effects of gadolinium administration may include discomfort during the injection of cont rast, 
tingling or warmth in the lips, metallic taste in the mouth, tingling in the arms, nausea, or headache.  These 
symptoms occur in less than 1% and resolve quickly.  There is a small risk of an allergic reaction to gadolinium; 
however, a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) occurs in less than 1 in 300,000.  
People with moderate to advanced renal failure who receive gadolinium are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_697402]/Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy (NSF/NFD). NSF/NSD causes thickening of skin and 
connective tissues that can result in pain, reduced joint mobility, and in some cases leads to death.70 The risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_248526]/NFD is 3 -7% in subjects with moderate to advanced renal failure,70 but these patients will not 
receive gadolinium.   The disorder has not been reported in patients with normal renal function.70 
7. IV. 6 Risks of incidental findings : Research MRI images or other tests obtained for research purposes may 
disclose incidental abnormal findings. In some cases, these findings may benefit the patient, in others, pursuing 
them may prove harmful.111 These findings will be shared with the patient, as described in the written consent 
form  and in the incid ental findings plan  (http://braininjuryoutcomes.com/documents/viewdownload/82/592 ). 
7.IV.7 Risks of Anxiolysis : Optional  anxiolytic medications given prior to MRI typi[INVESTIGATOR_697403], dizziness, and mild cognitive impairments, all revers ible. In patients who metabolize these 
medications slowly, these side effects may persist for several hours, and, in rare instances, longer. Operating a 
motor vehicle while suffering from such side effects may be dangerous. To mitigate this risk, patients will not 
be administered these agents if they must operate a motor vehicle later that day ; as appropriate, transportation 
assistance may be offered to participants if necessary . There are also rare risks of serious allergic reactions.

“dizziness/vertigo, no t otherwise specified.” The majority may have undiagnosed vestibular disorders.57,58 
Among those diagnosed as peripheral, 81% are misclassified.5 In those diagnosed with BPPV, appropriate 
bedside posit ional testing is documented in only 22% and treatments applied in just 4%.124  
Harm may also result from missed opportunities to treat peripheral vestibular disorders, even if ‘benign.’115,[ADDRESS_946738] more than double the recurrence risk (46% vs. 
20%, p=0.002)126 and 6.5 -fold greater odds of falling.115 Prompt BPPV treatment improves health -related  
quality of life.127 Dizziness is a risk factor for hip fracture,128 and increases the ris k of a repeat hip fracture 
nearly 3 -fold.129 It produces subjective functional impairment in 54% of patients and engenders fear of serious 
medical illness in 46%.130 Untreated, dizziness decreases health -related quality of life131,132 and functional 
capacity.133 Vertigo or dizz iness can lead to a secondary depression or anxiety disorder in 32% of patients.[ADDRESS_946739] common medical error type found in the ED138 and may be of special concern with neurologic 
problems.137 More obvious stroke symptoms such as hemiparesis are infrequently missed (~4%139), but ~ 30% of  
vestibular s trokes are missed initially.7,135,136 In the subset of vestibular strokes presenting isolated 
dizziness/vertigo (i.e., wit hout any other associated neurologic symptoms or signs) , representing the majority of 
patients enrolled in the AVERT Trial , it is possible that as many as 50% of strokes are missed initially.7 
The prognosis of posterior circulation strokes, if promptly diagnosed and  appropriately managed, is usually 
favorable.17 When  strokes are missed, preventable adverse outcomes result from missed opportunities for 
thrombolysis,136,140 early surgery for malignant posterior fossa edema,17,141 or prevention of subsequent 
vertebrobasilar infarction  (i.e., major stroke following minor stroke or transient ischemic attack) .142-144 Rapid, 
early treatment improves stroke outcomes145,146 and lowers repeat stroke risk by [CONTACT_8622] 80%.147,[ADDRESS_946740] found that 
there are racial, ethnic, and sex -related disparities in missed vestibular strokes, with minorities and women at 
~20-30% higher risk.149 Patients <60yo are at especially high risk of misdiagnosis,149 because stroke is often not 
considered in young patients.73 
When vestibular strokes are missed, the risks of death and disabili ty may rise substantially.29 A small study 
found a 40% 5 -day mortality amo ng those with missed cerebellar strokes.11 If this is representative, missing the 
stroke may  increase mortality 8 -fold ― 40% (missed cerebellar s troke) vs. 5% (correctly diagnosed cerebellar 
stroke).29 This risk difference (35%) could correspond to as many as ~20 -30,000 preventable stroke deaths 
annually  in US EDs . The true attributable risk is probably not quite that high, but even a 10% difference would 
mean ~5,000 -7,000 preventable deaths per year.  
 
7. VI. Risks of Wrong Diagnosis or Overtesting  
 
As in Section 7. V. (Missed Diagnoses), the risks of wrong diagnoses are important for treatable peripheral 
vestibular disorders and vestibular strokes. As with missed diagnoses, these risks are hypothesized to be 
substantially higher in the standard care arm than in the VOG -guided care arm.  
 
Benign peripheral vestibular disorders are often mistaken for vestibular strokes.[ADDRESS_946741] a misdiagnosed benign ear disorder (n=22/70).[ADDRESS_946742] a 
missed stroke (n=36/160).114,151 
 
With wrong diagnosis (especially beni gn vestibular disorders erroneously pursued for stroke), over -testing 
(especially neuroimaging or admission), confers special risks, described further below.  
• The risks of undergoing unnecessary CT will be far higher in the standard care arm than in the VO G-
guided care arm (since CT will not be a recommended strategy in any of the VOG clinical pathways).  
• The risks of undergoing unnecessary MRI are probably slightly higher in the VOG arm, since the 
decision rules ( algorithm will be used and modified as need ed) are tuned to err on the side of not 
missing a stroke.  
• The risks of unnecessary admission are probably slightly higher in the standard care arm.  
 
Patients with benign inner ear disorders are at risk of being harmed by [CONTACT_697493] 
a stroke or other neurologic diagnosis.  
• CT neuroimaging is ineffective, but frequently ordered in routine care for dizziness: The fraction o f ED 
dizziness patients undergoing neuroimaging to rule out stroke or other central causes has risen steadily from 
10% in 1995 to nearly  50% in [ADDRESS_946743] (~4 7%) 
rather than MRI (~ 3%),[ADDRESS_946744] to ‘rule out’ ischemic stroke in the  
posterior cranial fossa.11,17,135 The general increase in neuroimaging over time has not led to a corresponding 
increase in diagnosis of strokes or other important central causes.27 The same is true for unwanted, wide 
(1.5-fold), local -area practice variations in ED neuroimaging.152 
• CT carries meaningful risks:  In addition to delays in care, CT risks cancer from radiation exposure153 and, if 
contrast is used,  systemic allergy ( including risk of death from anaphylaxis)[ADDRESS_946745] nephropathy.155  
• MRI carries some risks:  described above in  7. IV. Risks of MRI testing  
• Unnecessary admission carries some risks:  Some patients may be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697404] -acquired infections or treated erroneously with medications that have potential side 
effects or toxicity.116,[ADDRESS_946746] care to their patients (i.e., without  
a VOG results report). The y are presumably at no greater risk of making a diagnostic error than if they were 
providing usual care outside the study protocol. Should a diagnostic error occur, ED provider s may be at greater 
risk for medicolegal liability given the greater clarity of diagnostic documentation and confirmatory testing. The 
gold-standard testing at [ADDRESS_946747] aggregate  ongoing  study information  to ED quality 
assurance and quality improvement processes as well as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697405].  
AVERT  
  Version  4.2

     29   
ED provider s caring for patients in the intervention arm (i.e., VOG -guided care) could potentially be held liable 
for VOG misdiagnoses, since ultimately they are responsible for clinical care decisions. This risk is mitigated 
almost entirely by [CONTACT_697494] (opportunity for ED provider s to go ‘off protocol’ for safety at 
any point; MRIs on all VOG patients; and [ADDRESS_946748] testing). The protocol goes well beyond usual 
care in terms of safety, so a medicolegal action agains t an ED provider  in this arm is highly improbable. It is 
much more likely that patients in the VOG arm are less likely to suffer a diagnostic error, thereby [CONTACT_697495]. Furthermo re, 
oversight provided by [CONTACT_697496] ( DSMB ) will mitigate any residual risk.  
 
Protection Against Risks  
 
Patient Selection : We will exclude from study participation any patients with prior trauma to the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_697406] (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) that might lead to instability of the cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_697407] a contraindication to neck rotation for the HIT. We will exclude any patients from the study who  are 
pregnant  (so as not to expose a fetus to neuroimaging risks),  and patients with contraindications to MRI with 
contrast, including renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2),[ADDRESS_946749].   
 
Pre-Screening : For individuals who may have cervical spi[INVESTIGATOR_697408] (e.g., fusion, stenosis), prior to 
performing manipulations as part of the head impulse testing, treating ED providers  will confirm that patients 
can tolerate these manipulations. Patients will  be advised to indicate any discomfort, and research personnel 
will be prepared to discontinue if significant discomfort is indicated, as described further below. Moreover, our 
routine testing procedures always include a pre -impulse neck range of motion as sessment. The head is rotated 
slowly from side -to-side to ensure that there are no neck problems prior to HIT testing.  
 
Asepsis prior to the Exam : A procedure for sanitizing the ICS Impulse device will be implemented at all 
enrolling sites before the first  subject is enrolled. The VOG device has a disposable foam insert (produced by 
[CONTACT_697497]) that contacts the patient’s skin surface. This foam will be replaced 
after each patient use to avoid infection related to the device. O ther equipment surfaces, including over -the-ear 
audiometry headphones, will be wiped clean with alcohol swabs or other disinfectant as appropriate.  
 
During the VOG Exam : Patients will be notified prior to any maneuvers necessary to evaluate their conditio n 
during the physical examination that might exacerbate their symptoms, so as to alleviate any unwarranted fear 
of the examination or examiner. We will stop testing at any time at the patient’s request. We anticipate no 
adverse effects of these research ex aminations. Nevertheless, should patients deteriorate clinically during their 
assessments, appropriate nursing and/or medical staff will be contact[CONTACT_697498].  
 
HIT Exam Technique : During our HIT procedures, the excursion of the neck rotation  will be very small (~10 -
20°). This technique minimizes potential discomfort or pain during testing, and effectively eliminates any 
hypothetical risk of soft tissue injury (e.g., vertebral arte ry dissection, described above in section 7.III.4 ). 
 
Response to Side Effects of the VOG Exam : All research personnel will be trained and ED site clinical 
providers will be given a standard set of instructions for how to handle any side effects or complica tions of 
testing  (See Manual of Operations and Procedures ). Emesis basins will be kept at the ready in case the patient 
should vomit during testing. All EDs will be equipped and ready to handle a bradycardic event, should one 
occur. For minor pain (or mino r increase in nausea/dizziness), VOG testing will stop temporarily and the patient 
asked if they are able to continue. For significant pain, VOG testing will stop . We have never seen a patient 
experience pain after impulse testing that lasts more than a fe w seconds . Nevertheless, if pain persists for more 
than 5 minutes after cessation of testing, its trajectory will be assessed over the subsequent 30 minutes. For 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     30  waning pain, there will be no specific intervention. For persistent pain, treatments will be a pplied by [CONTACT_697499]  (e.g., ibuprofen). Pain that remains persistent at the end of the ED visit will be documented, and these 
patients will be contact[CONTACT_697500][INVESTIGATOR_13377]. At the 1 -week 
follow -up neuro -otology visit, pain issues will be addressed, and any necessary referrals or communication with 
other providers (e.g., primary care) made.  
 
Diagnostic  Process : The VRT algorithm will be tuned to err on the side of caution. For example, those with  
prior inner ear or eye movement disorders risk confounding the results in a way that could potentially harm 
patients (e.g., patient with prior acoustic neuroma  surgery who comes with acute, continuous dizziness due to 
stroke; in this patient, the exam findings related to prior surgery could lead to an erroneous “benign peripheral” 
diagnosis).  In such cases, the algorithm will incorporate that past history and will be tuned to return an 
equivocal result, necessitating a neurological consultation, if available. In addition,  there will be an expert 
human double -check for the algorithm output in the VRT arm until it is sufficiently refined (Section 5.1.3)  
 
Identifi cation of Adverse Effects  
 
Safety Assessments : All safety -related assessments will be consistent with generally accepted medical practices 
and standard -of-care. The following specific assessments will be performed according to the schedule described 
in the protocol, when it is developed and approved by [CONTACT_4318]. Adverse events (AEs) recorded in the source 
documents will be entered into the e -CRF post randomization through the index discharge. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697409] [ADDRESS_946750] medical occurrence in a patient enrolled into the study wh ether or not 
it has a causal relationship to the study events. An adverse event can be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal lab finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated to the study timeline. The 
investigators will follow s tudy-related vestibular and stroke adverse events to resolution whenever possible.  
 If a subject is discontinued from the study for any reason, site personnel must clearly report and 
document the circumstances and data leading to any discontinuation, using  the EDC and whether the early 
termination was due to an adverse event. For any untoward event(s) the subject will be followed until the event 
resolves or is explained, with the frequency of follow -up designated by [CONTACT_093]. Any alarming or 
unexpec ted adverse event, including death due to any cause, which occurs, inclusive of the follow -up period (30 
days), and whether or not thought to be related to the study, must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of 
learning of the event) to the CC. Clinic al adverse events and study AEs are defined in accordance with the 
International Conference on Harmonization.   
 
Adverse Event Follow -Up: Follow -up assessments will be repeated to document return -to-normal of any 
abnormalities (or the establishment of a permanent sequelae with no further improvement expected during the 
established study period), or to document other outcomes of any adverse events.   
 
VISION™ EDC System : The EDC system will have a robust set of data quality checks that wi ll be executed at 
the time of data entry at the investigational site. This includes the standard validations available with most EDC 
systems such as range checks (e.g., to flag timing inconsistencies for symptom inclusion) and data format 
checks (e.g., to flag an invalid date). Additionally, the VISION™ platform performs sophisticated cross -form 
computed calculations that would not be available in lesser EDC systems. It will also detect protocol variances 
and present a list to the investigator and the CC fo r evaluation and follow -up. Consequently, the EDC system 
will provide consistency, completeness, and logic checks immediately at the time of data collection.  
 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     31  FDA Guidance for Electronic Data Entry Compliance : The design and development of the VISION EDC 
system will reflect the FDA Guidance for Industry for Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials (April 
1999) as well as the Electronic Records/Electronic Signatures rule (21 CFR part 11). A secure, computer 
generated, time -stamped electronic record allows reconstruction of the course of events relating to the creation, 
modification, and deletion of an electronic record. A copy of original information is verified, as indicated by 
[CONTACT_697501], as an exact co py having all of the same attributes and information as the original. A computer 
data compi[INVESTIGATOR_215441] a series of symbols, executed, adopted, or authorized by [CONTACT_697502]'s handwritten signature. Source do cuments are retained to enable a reconstruction 
and evaluation of the study. The system ensures that all applicable regulatory requirements for record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_697410] d with paper 
systems. Clinical investigators retain the original copy of all source documents uploaded onto the electronic 
case report form (eCRF). Query resolution correspondence is maintained and eCRF edits are tracked by [CONTACT_28049]. Changes to a require d record do not obscure the original information. The record clearly indicates the 
time a change was made and clearly provides a means to locate and read the prior information through the audit 
trail. This audit trail is in compliance with the 21 CFR 11.10 (e). The record, along with supporting 
documentation, also indicates who made the changes, when, and why changes were made. Security measures 
are in place to prevent unauthorized access to the system and data. To ensure that individuals have the authority 
to proceed with data entry, the system is designed to verify the electronic signature (user ID and password) at 
the start of a user session. The data entry system ensures attributability. Each entry to an electronic record, 
including any change, is made un der the electronic signature [CONTACT_472980]. A separate 
electronic signature [CONTACT_697551]; a single electronic signature [CONTACT_697552]. Individuals who maintain the electronic record sys tems as well as the audit trail carry the 
responsibilities to protect authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of electronic records. Audit trails will be 
available for inspectors at the CC or other location where associated electronic study records ar e maintained. 
The system will be designed to contain the prompts, lookup values, cross -field validations, flags, and on -line 
help to encourage consistent use of clinical terminology and to alert the user in case that data entered are out of 
acceptable rang e. External safeguards are in place to ensure that access to the computerized system and to the 
data is restricted to authorized personnel. Servers are stored in a physically secured, guarded data center.  
 
Security Measures : Users at the participating centers are aware of system security measures and the importance 
of limiting access to authorized personnel. Access to the data at a clinical site is restricted and monitored by [CONTACT_697503] -on, security verifi cation procedures, and audit trail. The data cannot be altered, 
browsed, queried, or reported via external software applications without entering through the protective 
software, although computers at each site may also be used for purposes other than the clinical trial. Because the 
system is largely through remote access, all data and applications used for the study are logically and physically 
isolated from the servers in order to preclude unintended interaction with non -study use software. These servers 
are strictly monitored and maintained by [CONTACT_697504]; remote sites do not have the ability to 
change such logical security of the system.  
Wireless data transfers will be fully encrypted. In addition, a secure handoff procedure has been 
devel oped for the transfer of data from the wireless data ( Creoso/Digivey ) devices to the VISION™ system via 
a secure mechanism . This secure procedure will ensure that patient identifiers are disaggregated from  any PHI 
transferred. Research personnel will first conduct a secure patient matching procedure to secure the patient’s 
unique study identifier from the e -patient log, then gather data from patients transferred as an encrypted file, 
and using only the patient’s unique study identifier .  
 
Disaster Prevention for EDC System :  The VISION EDC server uses multiple hard drives configured in 
a RAID array to maintain a continuous backup. A daily backup to external media supplements the RAID system 
along with weekly backup to offsite secure storage. The ser ver also has redundant separate power supplies. The 
hosting data center has dual electricity generation systems that can maintain the facility for up to 24 hours 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2

     32  (along with redundant cooling systems) in the event of power grid failure. OnRamp also maintai ns a second 
data center at a geographically separated locations (in the event of an attack or disaster that takes down the 
Austin facility completely) and, further, Prelude has contracted with a second data center in Austin (which is in 
an underground nucl ear-fortified shelter that also serves as a backup for the State of [LOCATION_007]) that can be deployed 
quickly to ensure continuing operation with minimal downtime.  
 
Limited Access : Each user is assigned an individual account with a unique username [CONTACT_2383]. The 
users are required to log into that account to start a data entry session and log out at the completion of the 
session  (the system will time -out following a period of inactivity) . Users  are legally (per FDA regulation 
subjecting them to civil and possi bly even criminal liability) and contractually prohibited from giving another 
person access to the system directly or by [CONTACT_697505]. Any hacking attempt to guess the 
password is locked out after ten (10) consecutive failed attempts, and any unauthorized access log -in attempt is 
recorded in a log file  that includes the originating TCP/IP  address . Once a hacking attempt is recognized, blocks 
of IP addresses (say, from a geographic region or top -level domain where there are no participat ing sites) can be 
locked -out at the network level.   
 
Users are required to log off the system upon leaving a workstation. Login sessions are protected by [CONTACT_697506], creating a secure tunnel between the authorized user and the serv er. The 
computer automatically logs off the current session after 30 minutes of inactivity, deactivating the session ID. 
On the computers accessing the EDC, as well as the site laptops/tablets temporarily compi[INVESTIGATOR_697411], 
users are also required (per training and contractual user agreement) to use screensave rs with password s that 
prevent access to their computer screens after a short period should they step away from the computer . 
 
 Audit Trails : All changes made to data in the electronic record are tracked and recorded in the audit trail 
which is located wit hin the primary database. This audit trail captures the date/time, and the contents of the 
changes made, and the user’s name  [CONTACT_697553]. The audit trail is created incrementally in 
chronological order, and in a manner such that overwriting of data cannot occur, in accordance with 21 CFR 
11.10(e).  
 
 Date and Time Stamps : All data are saved in the VISION EDC system on a central server carrying a 
time stamp, which is documented in the audit trail. The data server uses the participating site's time zone when 
available and US Central Time otherwise as the server is located in that time zone. The computers in 
participati ng sites use the local time where the study site is located. Individual users are unable to change the 
time on the server.

At any point of the study, the patient may choose to withdraw.

     33   
9. STATISTICAL CONSI DERATIONS & STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
 
9.1 General Design and Analysis Issues  
 
Main trial d esign : Randomized controlled trial (individual patient randomization), parallel design (1:1) . 
Results will be used for primary outcome analyses related to  diagnosis accuracy at the ED index visit.  
 
Secondary cohort  design : Two c ohort s in the standard care arm are defined based on correctness of ED index 
visit diagnosis. Cohort s will be  followed for adverse events and functional outcomes (1wk, 30d) . Estimate s will 
be used for Phase III trial planning for the impact of diagnosis accuracy on clinical events and outcomes.  The 6 -
month follow -up time point (if available) will not be part of the primary trial outcomes.  
 
Observational arm: Patients with vestibular symptoms but no signs or who are not randomized for other 
reasons (see Inclusion and  Exclusion Criteria) will be eligible for a parallel track observational sub -study with 
limited phone follow -up. Results will support Phase III trial planni ng and diagnostic algorithm refinement . 
 
Diagnosis adjudication : Prior to adjudication, index VOG results  will be interpreted by [CONTACT_697507] . They will be given only patient demographic information, a structured 
summary of dizziness -related history of the present illness, and bedside hearing test  result s. Using this 
information, and masked to all other index visit clinical findings, ED physician diagnoses, any neuroimaging, 
and all follow -up data, they will render an ED index visit diagnosis (“Index  VOG  Diagnosis ”). Prior to 
adjudication, MRIs will be interpreted by [CONTACT_697508] -radiologists masked to allocation and all 
clinical findings  other than demographic information . They will render an in dex visit diagnosis (“ Index 
Radiology Diagnosis ”). A 5-member multidisciplinary panel with ED physician, otolaryngologist, vestibular 
neurologist, stroke neurologist, and neuro -radiologist will adjudicate diagnoses. The panel will be masked at all 
times to  trial allocation ( VRT  vs. standard care). Diagnoses will be classified into [ADDRESS_946751] clinical criteria. Diagnoses will be  rendered in two stages – first based on VOG and all clinical data 
(including eye videos) from the ED index v isit alone, without follow -up data (“ Adjudicated Index Diagnosis ”); 
then again after all 1 -week testing and 30 -day follow -up data are revealed electronically (“ Adjudicated Final 
Diagnosis ”). All differences will be resolved by [CONTACT_697509].  
 
Algorithm Refinement : It is pre -specified that the VRT algorithm will be adapted iteratively during the trial. 
The algorithm performa nce in the VRT arm of the live trial will be monitored from the outset through the use of 
a human double -check procedure (described above in Section 5.1.3). The human double -check will remain in 
place until the algorithm performance is sufficient to be con sidered safe for unattended use, in consultation with 
the DSMB. The algorithm will be refined as frequently as necessary as long as the human double -check remains 
in place, and afterwards (if the human double check is removed before trial end) based on a s chedule 
determined by [CONTACT_697510]. In the interest of being able to conduct an end -of-trial analysis 
using the ‘optimized’ algorithm, modifications to the algorithm during the trial will be restricted to results from 
the VRT or observat ional arms of the trial; in this way, the optimized algorithm can be run on the SOC arm 
results without concerns for overfitting the algorithm to the data (i.e., a ‘split -half’ analysis).  
 
Outcome assessment : The ED diagnosis will have been elicited from ED provider s by [CONTACT_697511] a 
forced choice diagnosis. For the primary outcome, a correct “ED Provider Diagnosis” requires that the 
“Adjudicated Final Diagnosis” is the same diagnostic category . The VRT diagnosis will be assigned 
automatically by [CONTACT_697512] -time. However, as long as the algorithm is being iteratively refined 
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946752]. In this context , the 
primary trial outcome will be based on the actual VRT -based  care delivered to the patient ( regardless of 
whether that result was generated by [CONTACT_697513]). This approach is 
necessary to maintain alignment with  the structure of the study as a randomized trial. Additional  analyses will 
test the diagnostic accuracy of both the algorithm as rendered  and the end -of-trial ‘optimized’ algorithm . 
 
Analytic approach : For all primary and linked secondary analyses, we wil l include only randomized subjects 
completing the essential elements of the  diagnostic study protocol through the end of 1 -week follow -up (i.e., 
with ED index visit VOG test results, follow -up MRI within 14 days, and an in -person neuro -otology visit  
within 30 days of the index visit ). The quality of VOG and MRI testing will be determined by [CONTACT_697514], expert 
raters from the FDAC during an FDAC meeting pre -review process; if either essential test is deemed to be of 
insufficient quality for analysis (e.g. , key VOG tests performed improperly or missing; motion artifact on MRI), 
such patients will be excluded from the primary and linked secondary analyses of the main trial outcomes. This 
per-protocol analysis is appropriate for this Phase II study designed t o determine the potential efficacy of the 
VRT intervention on diagnostic accuracy. Without adequate quality VOG and 1-week follow -up data, diagnoses 
will remain speculative. Subjects lost to follow -up at the 30 -day time point (phone follow -up) will be incl uded 
in these analyses, as [ADDRESS_946753] diagnoses.  
 
Definitions : For the purposes of all analyses, the term “stroke” refers to any acute cerebrovascular event 
(ischemic stroke, transient is chemic attack, intracranial hemorrhage), unless expressly specified otherwise.  
 
9.2 Outcomes  
 
9.2.1 Aim 1 (Trial Outcome): Measure the impact of V RT on diagnosis and initial management  
 
Hypothesis  1: The VRT  pathway will yield more correct diagnoses by [CONTACT_697515] v isit than the 
standard care ( ED provider -determined) pathway.  
 
Primary outcome  1: Six-Category Diagnosis Accuracy (all, VRT vs. SOC).  Total proportion of correct 
diagnoses made by [CONTACT_697516] v s. SOC among subjects with 30 -day adjudicated final diagnoses (the gold standard) 
categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non -
diagnosis).  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan 1 :  
Primary analysis 1 : A generalized linear model with a log link will be used for comparing the true positive 
rates (TPRs) of VRT and SOC. Without additional covariates, the model based score test is equivalent to a 
Pearson Chi -square test for unpaired data. The regression mode l will assess the influence of demographic and 
key clinical variables as exploratory subgroups. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) 161 method will be used 
to account for clustering effects by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_697412]. VOG non -completers are excluded pre -
randomization (randomization occurs post -VOG for all patients).  
 
Specifically, define Di= [ADDRESS_946754] is categorized in one of six 
possible diagnosis c ategories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non -diagnosis). Define a test variable 
as

0   for SOC 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019

Define Yi(VRT)= [ADDRESS_946755] is the same as his/her 30-day adjudicated final 
diagnosi s and Yi(VRT)= 0 otherwise . Similarly, define Yi(SOC )= [ADDRESS_946756] is the same as his/her 30-day adjudicated final diagnosis and Yi(SOC )= [ADDRESS_946757] diagnoses, is defined as follows  
𝑇𝑃𝑅(𝑋𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡)=𝑃[𝑌𝑖(𝑋𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡)=1 | 𝐷𝑖=1],    𝑋𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡=0,1. 
 
Define the regression model as  
log𝑇𝑃𝑅(𝑋𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡)=𝛼0+𝛼1𝑋𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡+𝑎𝑖⃐   ∙𝑋𝑖⃐       
 
where  𝑋𝑖⃐    is a vector of additional subgroup variables or other covaria tes to be explored for assessing the 
influence of demographic and key clinical variables described in the secondary analysis.  
 
Secondary analysis 1 : For each of the six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 
1 non -diagnosis), define the gold standard =[ADDRESS_946758] positive respe ctively for “Index VRT Diagnosis” and “ ED Provider

Secondary outcomes 1.1-1.7: Diagnosis accuracy for different category groupi[INVESTIGATOR_697415]; the 
following accuracy comparisons  are considered : 
  
1. Central -Peripheral Diagnosis Accuracy  (all, VRT vs. SOC)  
Total diagnosis accuracy VRT vs. SOC using 30 -day adjudicated final diagnos es categorized as central (stroke, 
posterior fossa mass lesion, encephalitis, demyelinating disease, etc.) vs. non -central (includes peripheral 
vestibular, medical, psychiatric, non -diagnoses, etc.).  
2. Stroke -No Stroke Diagnosis Accuracy  (all, VRT vs. SOC)  
Total diagnosis accuracy VRT vs. SOC using 30 -day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized as stroke vs. no 
stroke (includes posterior fossa mass lesion, encephalitis, etc.).  
3. Preventable  Six-Category Diagnosis Error  (all, VRT vs. SOC)  
Total diag nosis inaccuracy  (error)  VRT vs. SOC using adjudicated index diagnoses categorized in one of six 
possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non -diagnosis). Adjudicated index 
diagnoses will be determined using only E D index visit data that ‘would have been’ available clinically (i.e., 
excluding safety MRI, index hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697416], and all follow -up data).  
4. VRT vs. MRI Stroke -No Stroke Diagnosis Accuracy (VRT arm only, VRT vs. MRI)  
Total diagnosis accuracy VRT vs. index imaging using 30 -day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized as stroke 
vs. no stroke (posterior fossa mass lesion, encephalitis, etc.). The VRT arm is chosen here because all VRT arm 
patients will undergo MRI at the index visit (protocol, clinica l, or safety), eliminating diagnostic ascertainment 
bias that may be present in the SOC arm.  
5. Algorithm -Only VRT Six -Category Diagnosis Accuracy (all, initial VRT output  vs. SOC ) 
Total diagnos is accuracy “as computed in real time,” algorithm -only VRT diagno sis vs. SOC using 30 -day 
adjudicated final diagnoses categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 
medical/other, 1 non -diagnosis). We will use “ Index VRT  Diagnosis” and “ED Physician Diagnosis” compared 
to the “Adjudi cated Final Diagnosis” based on ED index visit and [ADDRESS_946759] Accuracy  (SOC arm only, optimized VRT vs. SOC)  
Total diagnosis accuracy optimized VRT vs. SOC using 30 -day adjudicated final diagnoses categorized in one 
of six possible diagnosis ca tegories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non -diagnosis). We will use 
“Optimized VRT Diagnosis” and “ ED P rovider  Diagnosis” compared to the “Adjudicated Final Diagnosis” 
based on ED index visit and 30 -day follow -up clinical assessments. Optimiz ed VRT diagnoses will be  run using 
the final (end -of-trial) version of the VRT algorithm. Only SOC -arm subjects are used for this outcome , as VRT 
patient results will have been used to optimize the algorithm during the trial . VRT diagnoses in the SOC arm 
(algorithm not run during the trial), will be assigned based on the final, optimized algorithm; for this purpose, 
the ED SOC diagnosis will be assigned as the VRT diagnosis for algorithm results in the VRT -E group.  This 
outcome measure reflects the estimate d diagnostic accuracy of the end -of-trial automated algorithm.  
7. Expert VOG Six-Category Diagnosis Accuracy (all, expert VOG  vs. SOC ) 
Total diagnos is accuracy adjudicated  expert VOG  diagnosis  vs. SOC using 30 -day adjudicated final diagnoses 
categorized in one of six possible diagnosis categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non -
diagnosis). We will use “ Index  VOG  Diagnosis” and “ED Physician Diagnosis” compared to the “Adjudicat ed 
Final Diagnosis” based on ED index visit and 30 -day follow -up clinical assessments . This outcome measure 
reflects the theoretical maximum diagnostic accuracy performance (i.e., expert level) of any future algorithms.  
 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan Secondar y Outcomes 1.1-1.7: A generalized linear model with a log link will be used 
for comparing the true positive rates (TPRs) of VRT and SOC. Without additional covariates, the model based 
score test is equivalent to a Pearson Chi -square test for unpaired data. The regression mod el will assess the 
influence of demographic and key clinical variables as exploratory subgroups. Generalized estimating equation 
(GEE) 161 method will be used to account for clustering effects by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_307] s ite or provider.  
 
Secondary outcomes 8-9: Discharge and admission proportions: the following proportions are considered:  
8. Central Discharge Proportion (central subgroup only, VRT vs. SOC)  
Total discharge proportion of central causes VRT vs. SOC. Central causes determined based on 30 -day 
adjudicated final diagnosis.  
9. Peripheral Admission Proportion (peripheral subgroup only, VRT vs. SOC)  
Total admission proportion of peripheral causes VRT vs. SOC. Peripheral causes determined based on 30 -
day adjudic ated final diagnosis.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan 1.b.2 : A logistic regression will be used to estimate the odds of discharge in two arms 
among subjects with central causes  determined based on 30 -day adjudicated final diagnosis. Similarly, a logistic 
regres sion will be used to estimate the odds of admission in two arms among subjects with peripheral causes 
determined based on 30 -day adjudicated final diagnosis.  
 
 9.2.2 Aim 2 (Trial Outcome): Measure the impact of VRT  on initial diagnostic work -up costs  
 
Hypothesis  2: The VRT  pathway is cost saving relative to current ED practice in diagnostic assessments.  
 
Primary outcome  2: Total dollar costs of VRT as compared to SOC for diagnostic tests and consultations 
obtained d uring the ED index v isit and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (for those admitted at the index visit) . The cost for 
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946760]  by 
[CONTACT_697518] s in the ‘equivocal’ pathway.  Total costs will be calculated by [CONTACT_697519] (most recent year available average Medicare reimbursement in US dollars) by [CONTACT_697520].  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  2: Analyses will include two -sample comparisons of mean and median costs . Mean of 
total cost between two study -arms will be compared by [CONTACT_300469] t -test wit h unequal variances. Median total 
cost between two study -arms will be compared by [CONTACT_195463] -Mann -Whitney tests.162  
 
9.2.3  Aim 3 (Observational Outcome): Compare clinical outcomes for correct vs. incorrect diagnoses  
  
Hypothesis  3: ED patients with vertigo or dizziness who receive standard care will have better outcomes if 
correctly diagnosed than if misdiagnosed ( this is an observational outcome in the standard -care arm ). 
 
Primary Outcome  3: Proportion with short -term serious medical  events (SMEs) occurring between the time of 
ED index visit disposition and [ADDRESS_946761] vs. incorrec t ED 
provider  Diagnosis. “Correct” vs. “incorrect” diagnoses are categorized in one of six possible diagnosis 
categories (3 peripheral, 1 central, 1 medical/other, 1 non -diagnosis). SMEs  will include ED revisits, falls, hip 
fractures, vascular events (incl uding stroke), and test or treatment complications.  
 
Statistical Analysis Plan  3: A multivariable logistic regression will be used to estimate the odds of a n SME  
(correct diagnosis vs. misdiagnosed) adjusting for demographic and clinical variables . 
 
Specifically, define Si = [ADDRESS_946762] experience SMEs between the time of ED index visit disposition and 
1-week research follow -up visit. Following notation used in Aim 1, define the logistic model as,  
 
logit𝑃(𝑆𝑖=1|𝑋𝑇𝑒𝑠𝑡=0)=𝛽0+𝛽1𝑌𝑖(0)+𝛽2⃐    ∙𝑍𝑖⃐    
 
where  𝑌𝑖(0) is the variable indicating correct or incorrect diagnoses in SOC arm as defined in aim 1,   𝑍𝑖⃐     are 
additional subgroups variable s or other covariates listed in Aim 1.  
 
In addition, standard time -to-event analyses (Kaplan -Meier,163 Cox regression164) will be used to estimate 
relative hazard ratios, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables listed in Aim 1.  
 
9.3 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
Powering Endpoint : AVERT will be powered to detect a clinically important difference in diagnos is accuracy 
of 90% vs. 75% (113 per arm). VRT  diagnosis is anticipated to be nearly 100% accurate. We have shown that 
expert eye movement exams have 98.4% (n=187/190) accuracy for differentiating peripheral (vestibular 
neuritis) from central (stroke) vestibular disorders in acute, continuous vertigo.[ADDRESS_946763] now replicated these 
findings with the VOG device in 21 acute vertigo patients (100% accuracy). The gold standard

so we conservatively estimate that VOG accuracy across  all vestibular 
conditions will be >90%. Diagnos is accuracy of routine ED care varies, 
estimated at <20% for BPPV and neuritis5 and ~70% for stroke, and 
lower (~50%) if stroke presents with isolated vertigo.7,135,[ADDRESS_946764] ED diagnosis rate of about 56% for vestibular patients.[ADDRESS_946765] case scenario of 90% V RT 
accuracy and 75% standard care accuracy (Table 3).  
 
Recruitment Capacity : Our 3 -site consortium has a total of ~180,000 ED visits per year. Chief symptoms of 
vertigo/dizziness account for ~3 -4% of ED visits.15,[ADDRESS_946766] ~5,400 -7,200 ED dizziness visits 
per year (~5 -7 patients per 24hrs pe r site). Of these, we estimate ~20 -30%20 will meet inclusion criteria (~1-2 
patients per 24hrs per site). We will screen during five designated 7 -hr shifts weekly, performing VOG on ~3 -5 
patients per week, enrolling ~2 -4 patients per month per site, taking ~3 years to reach 226.  
 
Number of Strokes : With our inclusion criteri a, we expect ~10 -20% strokes (n=11 -23 per arm). This will not 
yield firm conclusions about VOG stroke accuracy, but should be sufficient for  Phase III trial planning.  
 
Interim Analyses : We plan interim analyses to be conducted by [CONTACT_697522] (Human Subjects below ). The primary concern is risk of misdiagnosis 
causing harm in the standard ED care arm, since safety MRIs in the VOG arm make harm from misdiagnosis 
unlikely. Our preliminary plan is to conduct statistical analyses on 30 -day clinical events after 75 and 150 
patients, but the interim analysis plan will be finalized in concert with the DSMB and institutional IRBs . 
 
Decision Rule for Proceeding to Phase III : We will proceed to Phase III if Phase II suggests either the (1) total 
diagnos is accuracy point estimate for V RT (or expert VOG) is higher than that of ED standard care (Aim 1); or 
(2) total diagnos is accuracy is statistically equivalent (Aim 1), but cos ts are lower for V RT care (Aim 2). Based 
on scant available data, a Phase III trial using 30 -day clinical events would likely need ~1,[ADDRESS_946767] with 2 -4 years of recruitment at ~[ADDRESS_946768] Medical Benefits  
We hypothesize that VOG -guided rapid triage (VRT) will help accurately, safely, and efficiently differentiate 
peripheral from central vestibular disorders in ED patients presenting vestibular vert igo or dizziness, and that 
doing so has the potential to improve post -treatment clinical outcomes for these patients.  The information 
learned from this study may help others in the future.

that help them get better faster, with fewer unnecessary tests. If participants  are found to have  a stroke causing  
their dizziness, they will  get the bes t possible treatments, and this  could reduce their chances of a second stroke

10.2 Payment and Remuneration  
Trial  participants who complete the Week-1, in-person  follow -up testing  will be paid $ 200. The payment 
structure is based on roughly $25 per hour for time spent at the one -week follow -up visit . It is anticipated that 
the follow -up visit will take up to 8 hours, for a total payment of $ 200. If participants complete partial testing , 
they will receive partial payment based on tests completed  ($50 neuro -otology clinical visit , $50 vestibular  and 
audiometric testing , $100 MRI ). Payments will not be prorated based on actual hours spent, and a single 
payment will be issued to the patient after follow -up testing has been completed  (within approximately 6 -8 
weeks of the follow -up visit) . In addition, p arking voucher s will be provided for free parking for the one week 
follow-up visit.  Transportation assistance may be offered to participants if necessary . For p articipants scheduled 
for their follow -up visit overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  a mealtime , meal vouchers may  be available. Neither trial (randomized) 
nor observational arm patients (not randomized) will receive payment for phone follow -up. 
 
 
11. RECORD RETENTION, DATA, SAFETY, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE MONITORING, EARLY     
STOPPI[INVESTIGATOR_16442]  
 
11.1 Records to be kept :  
 
Participation in this study requires that original study documents be retaine d for a minimum of [ADDRESS_946770] complies with 
U.S. FDA regulations (21 CFR  §312.62[c]) . Records must not be destroyed without first contact[CONTACT_697526].   
 
For the purposes of this section, “original study documents” are defined as:  
 
• Subject medical records created at or available to the enrolling center during the subject’s 
participation in the trial, or any other document that supports entries in the EDC system and 
represents the original source of that information, including but not limited to applicable sections 
of medical charts, and patient correspondence, as well as any  forms or documents used to 
compi[INVESTIGATOR_697417]. Intermediary 
documents and worksheets used to organize and compi[INVESTIGATOR_697418] a form that 
facilitates easier transcription into the EDC do not  represent original study documents. Certain 
data may be entered directly into the EDC in which case the EDC system represents the original 
study document.  
 
• All Essential Regulatory Documents (as defined under Good Clinical Practice Regulations) 
including:  all material communications with the IRB; all communications with the Sponsor that 
are related to study subjects or which otherwise document material study -related procedures or 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2

     41  safety issues; and, all training records and documentation that all participa ting staff are suitably 
qualified and authorized (CVs, 1572, Delegation Log, etc.).  
 
• Archival copi[INVESTIGATOR_697419] -EDC system.  
 
All study documents should be uploaded to the Electronic Trial Master File (eTMF) section  of the 
VISION -EDC system. VISION will be used as the master repository for all site and Sponsor regulatory 
documents, and all patient source documents with the exception of DICOMs and any records not 
uploaded to the EDC (perhaps for confidentiality reason s or do to specific site discretion, such as might 
be suitable for financial contracts), sites generally do not need to maintain duplicate local files unless 
otherwise mandated by [CONTACT_697527].  
 
At the conclusion of the study, all enter ed patient data and uploaded documents (with the exception of 
DICOMs) in the VISION -EDC system will be archived and provided to the site on DVDs  or other 
digital media . DICOMs submitted to the EDC system will be maintained in the EDC system. Sites will 
retain DICOMs via their local PACS system (or local copi[INVESTIGATOR_697420]).  The CC will also maintain a copy.  
 
Regulations require that study documents (including the archive CDs and any study documents not uploaded to 
the EDC) must be retained in the files of the re sponsible investigator for potential review by [CONTACT_174275]. The expected retention period is a minimum of 2 years after the final report is submitted to the 
NIDCD after the conclusion of the overall clinical trial, irrespective of any particular si te’s participation.  
 
11.2 Data Management:  
 
Data Collection (logistics) : SCs will gather data from enrolled subjects in the ED using tablet devices as we 
have done in the past (NIH/NCRR RR17324 -01, AHRQ HS017755 -01).15 We use Digivey™ (Creoso 
Corporation, Phoenix, AZ) digital survey software platform to create our structured interview, touch -screen 
clinical data entry forms for use on tablet devices. All data are temporarily stored to local devices, wirelessly 
synchronized to a central server via encrypted Wi -Fi, and de leted from the local device following confirmed 
data transfer for optimal security. For VOG data we will use GN Otometrics’ OTOsuite Vestibular™ software 
in the local  configuration , and Digivey ’s Task Manager  will securely transfer files to the VISION ™ system.  
 
Data Management : Research data will be synchronized to our internet -accessible clinical trials management 
software platform ( VISION ™ by [CONTACT_697528], Austin, TX ). This system is used by [CONTACT_697529] (BIOS) for rapid and efficient prot ocol management in large, multicenter, acute stroke trials (30 -70 sites).  
 
BIOS Reading Center : Once images and videos are received, the BIOS (Clinical Trials CC) Reading Center 
Technician opens all image and video packets to verify contents. Each is catalogued by [CONTACT_17634]/time of the 
scan, the scan modality (MRI, CT, video, etc.), the scan medium (i.e., digital films, hard films, or printouts, 
etc.), the date received at the Reading Center, and any comments relating to the image packet or specific 
individual studies. Once the contents have been verified and catalogued, the images are loaded on the study 
server for archive, and made available for access at the Reading Center workstations.  
 
Data Analysis and Interpretation : We will have a safety and data  monitoring committee in full compliance 
with relevant Federal Policies for Data and Safety Monitoring in addition to compliance with all applicable U.S. 
and international GCP regulations.

  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946771] the well -being of study participants and to ensure scientific integrity, and 
will include the following components:  
 
• an externally -appointed, independent DSMB;  
• CC and performance site IRBs;  
• direct, ongoing oversight by [CONTACT_697530];  
• central image reading providing independent, masked radiographic assessments;  
• multidisciplinary panel of outcome adjudicators masked to allocation status;  
• automated data quality checks at the time of EDC form completion by [CONTACT_6207];  
• a training program prior to site activation and with  continuous communicating and training after trial 
start-up. 
 
11.[ADDRESS_946772]:  A DSMB will provide an independent review of the research, interim 
safety and efficacy data, and progress towards achieving the goals of the study. To enable the CC to properly 
manage the study, the project leadership and key personnel will jointly work on a DSMB plan early in the study 
start-up process. The externally -appointed DSMB will then approve the plan. The monitoring plan will describe 
the process for reporting adverse events to the IRB, FDA, and NIH/NIDCD, as appropriate.  
 
FDA Approval and IDE : FDA review of the AVERT proposal has determined that no IDE is required:  
 “FDA has determined that your proposed clinical investigation is a nonsignificant risk (NSR) device study 
because it does not meet the definition of a significant risk (SR) device unde r § 812.3(m) of the investigational 
device exemptions (IDE) regulation (21 CFR 812).” (FDA Letter ; available for download from 
www.braininjuryoutcomes.com ). 
 
Data Flow for the Data Safety and Monitoring Board and Final Analyses : Each step in the flow of da ta for this 
study is discussed below in regards to its importance in ensuring data integrity and patient safety. The steps are 
numbered for reference purposes, albeit some steps may occur simultaneously and data for a single patient may 
be in differing sta ges in this process.  
 
 1. Regulatory Specialist Verification of Study Documentation : Before the site can begin enrolling 
patients, the CC will verify that all mandatory startup tasks have been completed and appropriate documentation 
has been uploaded to the electronic data capture (EDC) system’s electronic trial master file (eTMF). A 
param eter in the EDC system will allow the site to enroll a patient and grant user access rights to the online case 
form. This step will ensure that no site may enroll patients until all regulatory documentation (i.e., IRB 
approval, investigator qualification),  staff training certificates, and contractual requirements are fulfilled. 
During the study, the CC will work with the site PIs and SCs to maintain the study documentation in the eTMF 
repository, as all study documentation will be online. At the end of the study, the eTMF content will be 
provided to the site on compact disks, consisting of all the collected patient data and study documentation, for 
long term regulatory retention.  
 
 2. Data Entry & Source Document Upload : Once a potential patient is identifie d, the SC will register 
this new patient via the Digivey backend connection to the VISION EDC system, triggering an automated alert 
to the CC, reading center, and investigators. Should the patient subsequently fail to qualify for the study, the 
basic demographic information and reason for screen failure will be used to assess potential selection bias at the 
site, and for performance tracking and epi[INVESTIGATOR_697421].  
 Next, the SC will upload copi[INVESTIGATOR_697422] -identified  or identified  medical r ecords , according to 
institutional policy,  to the eTMF to include the EDC and ambulance records, ED records, progress notes, 
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946773]/MRI data files (as zipped DICOMS) and video images and upload these 
to the EDC system as well. These will be reviewed by [CONTACT_171120].   
 Sites will be expected to enter critical screening data within 24 hours of enrollment , if these are not 
automatically transferred to VISION from Digivey . The EDC system will be programmed to send automated 
reminders to the investigator and site managers if sites fail to enter any data in a timely manner.  
 
3. Correction of Automat ed Errors and Warnings : As data are entered, the EDC system will 
immediately generate automated warnings (yellow highlights) and errors (red highlights). Warnings will 
represent data that is outside expected (questionable, but not impossible) limits or where required data are 
missing. Errors will indicate conditions that are unrealistic (such as an impossibly high age  or blood pressure 
reading ) or that indicate data error (such as an invalid date format).  
 In keepi[INVESTIGATOR_697423], the EDC system will not force an investigator  
or SC  to immediately change the entered data (as that could be misconstrued as encouraging data falsification) 
but instead the EDC will simply provide feedback via on -screen messages and red/yellow fi eld highlighting. 
Unresolved w arnings may remain , due to patient -specific issues, but will be documented nonetheless. 
Conversely, red errors must be resolved before the case form page can be advanced in the workflow (i.e., signed 
by [CONTACT_16274]) so the data wil l be “clean” before it is exported for analysis. The EDC system will also produce 
various instantaneous reports that are useful for data quality and safety monitoring purposes both by [CONTACT_697531].  
 
4. Source Document Verification a nd Data Integrity Review : The CC ’s data quality monitoring team  
(monitors) will review the online case forms for completeness, logic, and consistency, then verify the entered 
data against the uploaded source medical records and data collection worksheets. Routine queries identified in 
this process will be entered into the EDC system (triggering an automated notice to the site). A monitor will 
then work with the SCs to obtain correction of all data errors and resolution of the corresponding queries. 
Random s ampling will be used to select primary data for 100% source verification. Should the data accuracy for 
a patient/site exceed certain minimum expectations in this step, or if any material data integrity or regulatory 
compliance issues are identified, additi onal data from a patient/site will undergo intensive monitoring and the 
site referred to the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_697424].  
 
5. Data Analyst Verification & Preliminary Compi[INVESTIGATOR_344] : Once the data are entered, source -verified, and 
safety -reviewed, they will be exported to a statistical analysis package (Stata or SAS) and subject to additional 
offline edit checks. Expanding upon the patient -oriented monitoring and automated verifications, this step will 
focus on cross -study evaluation of the data and identify outliers and notable trends.  
 
6. Final Data Listing Review : After a patient is complete and all data are final, a report (tables and 
graphs) of the important data points will be generated. The data m anager will perform a final check on the data 
to assess data completeness, consistency, and logic in preparation for final data lock.  
 
7. Report -to-Database Verification Audit :  A random sample (approximately 10%) of the data in the 
final data listing will  be 100% visually verified against the EDC entries to ensure there are no systematic or 
sporadic errors generated in the export, analysis, and compi[INVESTIGATOR_697425]. This quality control audit will be 
documented for the study files.  
 
8. Investigator Signoff an d Final Data Lock : Finally, after completion of all data cleaning, safety 
reviews, and QA activities, the investigator will be asked to sign -off on the final patient data  and then the case 
record will be locked . Once locked, the case forms will no longer b e editable.

9. Data Collection and Submission to Statistical Center : Data will be entered digitally at the bedside as 
described above and synchronized to a secure central server. The study database (EDC system) contains raw 
data entered by [CONTACT_697532]; it has pre -programmed exports to extract speci fic data sets 
for analysis. New exports can be built as may be necessary. The export routine is fully tested and documented 
as part of the overall EDC validation  (in accordance with FDA Part -11 guidance) . For data analysis and 
reporting, the data forms wil l be finalized through a specific time point (e.g., all data entered, cleaned, signed -
off, and locked to prevent further changes). The database is then exported (maintaining appropriate security, 
change -tracking, and chain -of-custody controls and a record (snapshot) is kept of data to be used for specific 
reports and analyses, such as for DSMB reports  our routine data quality audits. These snapshots are considered 
interim, as the patient data are subject -to-change while the study is ongoing. StatTransfer ( Seattle, WA)  or a 
comparable package  is used to export data from tables and queries of the local copy of the database in a format 
that can work with the statistical software (Stata or SAS) or be used for cost or cost -effectiveness analysis using 
standard s oftware (TreeAge, http://www.treeage.com/). The outputs are then analyzed, and if graphical 
presentation is needed, Ploticus, Stata, or SAS are used to generate charts and graphs. The CC will prepare 
routine interim reports of data analyses and reports sum marizing patient screening and selection, protocol 
adherence, and data quality. After the final full database lock at the conclusion of the study (and for any formal 
interim analyses stipulated in the protocol), the Statistical Center will develop (using f inal data exports that are 
generated by [CONTACT_697533]) data analyses that summarize the study’s findings. The CC will work 
with Statistical Center to prepare the final reports summarizing the overall performance of all sites with respect 
to the protocol and the quality of the data generated.  
 
10. Statistical Analysis and Study Reporting : Final, locked data will be used for the protocol -defined and 
exploratory statistical analyses and generation of the final study report and associated study pu blications.  
 
10.4 Interim Analyses for Harm (Early Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]):  We plan two interim analyses to statistically assess  for 
harm in either trial arm (VOG care [active intervention] or standard care). These will be finalized in concert 
with the externally -appointed DSMB and institutional IRBs, but our initial plans are described here.  
  
Analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_697534]. The first interim analysis will occur at the one -third -way point 
in the trial after the first [ADDRESS_946774] been randomized. If it is determined at either interim analysis 
that patients are suffering significant harms differentially across the two arms, the DSMB will d etermine if the 
trial should be modified (e.g., by [CONTACT_1583] a safety MRI to the standard care arm) or discontinued.  
 
Potential risks of harm are described in detail in Human Subjects Section above , and adverse event detection 
and reporting in the Data and S afety Monitoring Plan (below). The primary concern is risk of misdiagnosis and 
resulting harm in the standard ED care arm, since safety MRIs in the VOG arm make harm from misdiagnosis 
unlikely. The rationale for allowing a ‘no safety MRI’ -standard care arm  is that immediate safety MRIs for the 
standard care arm would be non -standard, since only 1 -2% of all ED patients with dizziness nationally undergo 
MRI.[ADDRESS_946775] care arm, i t is also possible that there would 
be instead be harms from overtesting in the VOG care arm ( 7. VI. Risks of Wrong Diagnosis or Overtesting).  
 
The DSMB will consider all NIH/NIDCD -defined serious and non -serious adverse events occurring within 30 -
days 
 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     45  NIH Adverse Event Definition ( http://grants.nih.gov/clinicaltrials_fdaaa/definitions.htm ):  
“Unfavorable changes in health, including abnormal laboratory findings, that occur in tri al participants 
during the clinical trial or within a specified period following the trial.   Two types of adverse event data are 
to be reported: "Serious" and "Other (Not Including Serious)" adverse events.  
• Serious Adverse Events  include adverse events th at result in death, require either inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697426], are life -threatening, result in a persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity or result in a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Other important medical e vents, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, may also be considered Serious Adverse Events if a trial 
participant's health is at risk and intervention is required to prevent an outcome mentioned.  
• Other (Not Including Serious) Adverse Events  are those that are not Serious Adverse Events that exceed 
a frequency threshold.”  
These two interim analyses will be based on group sequential methods that control for the effects of ‘multiple 
looks’ at the data, as described by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_260586].171 To create the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we will use cutoff points (c k), as 
described in Jennison and Turnbull,[ADDRESS_946776] of adver se events between the two trial arms 
using Cox regression164 and assuming O’Brien -Fleming boundar ies.[ADDRESS_946777] participation will be in accordance with applicable Federal and international Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) requirements regarding protection of human subjects, to include 45 CFR Part 46, 21 CFR 50, and the 
Declaration of Helsinki. All research will be under the review of the IRBs at the respective sites, to include IRB 
approval at the JHU BIOS CC (JCCI), operating in accordance with 21 CFR Part 56.  
 
The HIPAA Privacy Rule, 45 CFR Parts 160 and 164, will govern the protection of individually identifiable 
Protected Health Information (PHI). No PHI will be collected without first obtaining a HIPAA waiver and 
subject informed consent. Access to PHI will be restrict ed to authorized staff, and only after signing 
confidentiality, patient privacy, and security agreements. All key personnel, BIOS staff, and all investigative 
team members at the enrolling sites will provide proof of training on the protection of human res earch 
participants and maintenance of patient confidentiality. All certification documents will be required on e -file 
before a site is activated and its first research participant enrolled.  The conduct of this study will be in 
accordance with NIH’s Policy for Data and Safety Monitoring (N OT-98-084).  
 
12.[ADDRESS_946778] (IRB) Review and Informed Consent : This protocol and the informed 
consent document  and any subsequent mod ifications will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_697535]. The con sent form will describe the purpose of the study, the procedures to be followed, 
and the risks and be nefits of participation.  
 
The informed consent documents will meet the requirements of 21 CFR 50.20 and contain the information

2. Why is this research being done?  
This research is being done to learn more about the diagnosis of stroke in Emergency Room (ER) patients who are 
experiencing new dizziness or other balance problems.  
 
Sometimes doctors are not able to figure out whether the dizziness or balance problem is coming from a problem with the ear 
or a problem with the brain (like a stroke). We are trying to make sure doctors  in the ER don’t miss the chance to recognize 
and treat strokes early, since strokes that cause dizziness are easy to miss. Specialists can diagnose strokes by [CONTACT_697538]. We are using a non -invasi ve device that is similar to a pair of 
swimming goggles that fits over a person’s head and takes a video pi[INVESTIGATOR_697434].  
These goggles are already routinely being used to care for patients with vertigo, dizziness an d balance problems in specialty 
clinics  and in some ERs . 
 
We want to see if using the information from the goggles helps give better treatment to people with dizziness or balance 
symptoms. To do this, we need to compare people whose treatment was guided by  [CONTACT_697539]. This study is a “randomized trial.” Everyone will be tested with the goggles, but not 
everyone’s doctor will be told the results. The choice of whose doctor gets the goggles test res ults will be random (by [CONTACT_3364], 
like the flip of a coin). For some participants, the study goggles test results will guide the care they receive and become p art 
of their medical record. For other participants, the results will not be given to their ER doct or, and they will get the same care 
in the ER that they would have gotten if they did not join the study.  
 
AVERT  
  Version  4.2 
May 7th, 2019 
     57  The video goggles in this research study are approved by [CONTACT_6581] (the FDA) for 
measuring balance function. The  use of the video googles in this study is investigational. The word “investigational” means 
that they are not approved by [CONTACT_697540] . The FDA has reviewed its use in this study and determined that 
it presents a non -significant risk to y ou and other participants.  
 
Adults , 18 years and older  who speak English and are not pregnant, coming to the ER with dizziness, vertigo, or other related 
balance problems may join this study.  
 
How many people will be in this study?  
Roughly  2,000 people are expected to take part in the screening part of this  study, but only about 226 will complete the 
randomized trial, including about 75 at [insert your institution name] . 
 
3. What will happen if you join this study?  
 
If you agree to be in this stu dy, we will ask you to do the following things:  
 
NOW, AT THE ER VISIT : After signing this consent form, you will answer some basic questions about your health, 
including how much your dizziness is affecting you now. Put on a pair of study goggles (like swimming goggles) that 
measure eye movements and a brief clinical exam will be performed. The goggles have a small camera built into the frame to 
record a video of your eye movements during this exam. This video technolo gy finds more abnormalities than visual 
observation alone.  It is important to do a portion of the exam in complete darkness and your eyes will be covered 
temporarily using sticky patches that block light  or a drape that covers your face . This should take about [ADDRESS_946817] of the videos and other images recorded in the study 
will not be identifiabl e (for example, a close -up video pi[INVESTIGATOR_697435]). Signing th is consent to participate in this trial 
means you agree to have these unidentifiable  images used for the purposes of training, teaching, and scientific publication.    
Some images for the rese arch study will include a pi[INVESTIGATOR_697436]. In order for us to use these 
identifiable recordings  to help educate other doctors around the world , we are asking for your permission below . You do not 
have to allow us to use these recordings to take part in the study. You may still take part in this study no matter what your 
decision. These videos will be used for the purpose s of training, teaching and scientific publications. These materials will not 
be used for any other purposes,  such as marketing.   
 
□  Yes, I agree for my identifiable images in the video recordings to be used for training, teaching, and 
scientific publications.  
□ Yes, I understand that I can request that the video recording be stopped at any time and that by 
[CONTACT_5634], this will end my participation in the trial.  
□ Yes, I understand that I have the right to withdraw my consent before the video recordings or my 
images are shared with the public.  
 
□ No, my identifiable images in the video recordings may not be used for training, teaching, or scientific 
publications. I understand that my  identifiable images in the video recordings will still be seen and 
analyzed as part of the research study.  
 
At the end of the initial testing, t he results of the eye exam with the goggles and other tests will determine if you are eligible 
for the trial. Even if you are not eligible for the trial, you are still eligible for the part of the follow -up study .

  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946818] care in the ER . 
 
GROUP #1 (STUDY GOGGLES CARE)  
 
a) The study goggles will determine your care. In some cases, your goggle s results may be double -checked by a specialist 
doctor who is an expert in dizziness. If th e specialist doctor disagrees with the goggles  result , the specialist doctor’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_697437]. The study coordinator doing the goggles testing will tell you whether the 
specialist  will be reviewing your goggles and other test results.  
 
b) If the study goggles (or specialist  doctor ’s review) suggest your dizziness or vertigo probably indicates a stroke, you 
will be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697438]. This will include a brain scan (magnetic resonance 
imaging [MRI]) and other standard tests. The length of your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408] (usually about 2 -3 days) will depend on test 
results and treatments you need. If tests confirm you have a stroke or other brain problem, you will be given st andard 
treatments for that problem. If tests confirm an inner ear problem, you will be given standard treatments and sent home . If 
your ER doctors believe  you do not need hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697439], then  the research study will pay 
for the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422]. If your ER doctors believe you should be admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697440] a 
problem that would typi[INVESTIGATOR_697441], the study will not pay for your care.  
 
c) If the study goggles (or specialist  doctor ’s review) suggest your dizziness or vertigo is from an inner ear problem, you 
will be treated in the ER and sent home. You will be given standard treatments for your inner ear problem such as 
medications to  reduce dizziness or nausea. As an a dded precaution before you leave, we will obtain an MRI brain scan 
(details below ) to make sure you do not have a stroke.  
 
GROUP #2 (STANDARD CARE)   
 
You will have the study goggles test, but the results will not be given to you or your doctors. The care you receive in the 
ER will be the same as you would if you were not part of the study.  
 
AFTER TODAY’S ER VISIT : If you are eligible for the trial, t here will be  one more in-person study follow -up visit and 
two follow -up phone calls: (1) Week 1 (in person); (2) one month (phone); and , in most cases,  (3) six months (phone). If you 
are not eligible for the trial, there will only be two phone calls. E ach appointment  is described below . 
 
WEEK -1 IN-PERSON  VISIT ( TRIAL PARTICIPANTS ONLY ): We will ask you to return for a n in-person  follow -up visit to 
[insert your institution name] . You will be paid $ [ADDRESS_946819] (water in the ear test) and a complete 
hearing test will be performed. A repeat MRI brain scan ( see below ) will be performed to confirm your diagnosis, since early 
MRI can sometimes be wrong. Unless these tests were recommended as clinically necessary by [CONTACT_697541] 
(including any specialists, if involved), the tests will be paid  for by [CONTACT_67300].  
 
ONE -MONTH & SIX-MONTH PHONE  FOLLOW -UP (ALL PARTICIPANTS) : You will be called by a member of the 
research team about one month (and, in most cases,  again about six months) after your ER visit to ask some questions and see 
how you are doing. Each  call will take about [ADDRESS_946820] that 
relate to dizziness or strokes, like whether you saw an ear doctor (otolaryngologist) or a brain doctor (neurologist).   
 
 DETAILS ABOUT MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) BRAIN SCANS:  
As part of your participati on in this research study, you will have a MRI brain scan to look for stroke or other brain disease 
that might be the cause of your dizziness or vertigo. If you have known  reasons why you cannot have an MRI brain scan , you 
cannot take part in th e trial, bu t you may still take part in the phone follow -up study. If you agree to join the study , we will 
ask you questions to make sure you are able to have an MRI. If you are accepted into the trial, b efore your MRI exam, the 
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946821], you will lie on a padded table. A head/neck “coil” frame will be placed around your head, face, and neck (close to 
your face, but not touching you directly). The coil frame is necessary to help the MRI machine take pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]. The table on 
which you are lying will be moved to the center of an MRI magnet, which looks like a long narrow tube. Even though the 
tube is open, some people feel confined in small places. If this bothers you, please notify the MRI s taff. You may end your 
participation in this study at any time by [CONTACT_697542]. When MRI pi[INVESTIGATOR_247717], radio -signals and magnetic 
fields are used. When this happens, it is normal for the MRI machine to make loud, banging, and clicking noises . You will be 
asked to wear earplugs or headphones for your comfort during the exam, and to protect your hearing.  
During the exam, the MRI staff can see and hear you. You will be able to hear the MRI staff. The MRI staff will be talking to 
you during your MRI exam and may give simple instructions to hold your breath, maintain your position, etc. You will 
generally be requested to lie perfectly still throughout the exam. Again, you may ask the MRI staff to stop at any time.  If your 
MRI is with contrast, a t some point during your MRI exam the MRI staff will interrupt the scanning procedure in order to 
give a “contrast agent” (sometimes called a “contrast dye”). Giving contrast allows us to take more accurate pi[INVESTIGATOR_697442]. Th e agent is given through a needle placed (an IV) in your arm. The IV will be placed 
using standard hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697443].  The research study requires an MRI at the 1 -week follow -up visit; if you do not wish to 
receive a MRI,  you cannot participate in the tr ial, but you may still participate in the phone  follow -up study . 
Incidental Findings  
The MRI you are having as part of this research study will be reviewed by a qualified physician  just as when having the MRI 
as part of your routine medical care. There is a possibility that while reviewing your MRI we may see an abnormality that we 
did not expect to see in this study. This is what is called an “incidental finding.” We will let you know if we see such an 
incidental finding.  Depending on the type of incident al finding, we may contact [CONTACT_697543]. In the case of a 
potential serious emergency, someone may go to your home. A qualified person (usually a member of the research team) will 
talk to you if there is an incidental finding. You do not have an  option to decline information about an incidental finding.  If 
you want, we will give information about this incidental finding to your primary doctor or we will refer you to an appropriat e 
doctor for further evaluation.  
 
• An incidental finding may cause yo u to feel anxious.  
• Since an incidental finding will be part of your medical record, it may affect your current or future life or health 
insurance coverage. This risk will vary depending on the type of insurance plan involved.  
The costs for any care that will be needed to diagnose or treat an incidental finding would not be paid for by [CONTACT_265724]. These costs would be your responsibility.  
 
How long will you   be in the study?  
The entire study will last for about 5 years. You will be in this study for about six months .  
 
4. What are the risks or discomforts of the study?  
 
• You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions or you are completing questionnaires. You do not ha ve to 
answer any question you do not want to answer.  
 
• You might experience some increased dizziness or feel sick to your stomach during the examination, although most of 
our patients and research participants do not.  
 
• The sticky patches on your eyes , if us ed, may cause some brief discomfort when removing.  
 
• There is a rare risk of neck pain or slowed heart rate during the examination.  
 
• There is a rare risk of discomfort from the audiology tones during the examination.  
 
• The risks of the MRI are the same as in routine brain scans for dizziness/vertigo.  
AVERT  
  Version  4.[ADDRESS_946822] been extensively studied, and there are no known significant risks with  
an MRI exam. You may, however, be bothered by [CONTACT_49995] (claustrophobia)  or by [CONTACT_697544]. You will be asked to wear earplugs or earphones while in the MRI scanner . You may not 
participate in this study if you have a pacemaker, an implanted defibrillator or cer tain other implanted electronic or metallic 
devices. It is important for you to advise the MRI staff if you have had brain surgery for a cerebral aneurysm, or if you hav e 
implanted medical or metallic devices, shrapnel, or other metal, including metal in y our eye.  
The contrast agent you will receive is FDA -approved and used routinely for MRI exams. It contains a material called 
gadolinium. The injection of contrast may cause discomfort, tingling or warmth in the lips, metallic taste in the mouth, 
tingling i n the arm, nausea, or headache. These symptoms occur in less than 1% (less than 1 in 100) of people and go away 
quickly.  Insertion of the needle  and intravenous catheter  (small plastic tube  often referred to as an “IV” ) to give you 
gadolinium may cause min or pain, bruising and/or infection at the injection site.  There is a small risk of an allergic reaction 
to gadolinium; however, a severe allergic reaction occurs in less than one in 300,[ADDRESS_946823] normal kidney function to receive gadolin ium during the research MRI in this study. People with severe 
kidney failure who receive gadolinium are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_272769]/Nephrogenic Fibrosing 
Dermopathy (NSF/NFD). This ( NSF/NFD ) is a serious progressive disease and can result in death. There are no confirmed 
cases of this complication ( NSF/NFD ) occurring in individuals with normal kidney function (GFR ≥ 30 mL/min).  
All subjects will undergo the standard, institutionally required clinical prescreening tests, including MR I questionnaire and 
blood or urine test for kidney disease or pregnancy, per policy.  Please notify a doctor, nurse , or technologist if you are 
allergic to gadolinium, if you have any kidney problems, or if you experience any of these or other side effects .  
A physician will be available during the procedure to administer any necessary care if side effects do occur, and to determin e 
when or if the injection of the gadolinium should be stopped.  
Unexpected Diagnosis or Future Diagnostic Tests : In this study y ou will get special diagnostic tests that you would not 
normally get. These tests could identify brain diseases that you have but did not know about , such as stroke or multiple 
sclerosis. Finding this out could make you upset. It could also lead to other t ests or treatments outside the study that might 
have side effects, risks, or costs to you. These tests could also be wrong, which might lead to unnecessary tests or treatmen ts. 
 
Confidentiality : There is always a risk that information about you may become known to people outside this study. We will 
do everything we can to make sure that everyone who needs to see your information uses it only for the study and keeps it 
confidential.  
 
Randomization (Coin Flip) : The study goggles results (or specialist doctor ’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_697444]) might lead your 
ER visit doctor(s) to choose tests or treatments that they might not have chosen. We believe those choices will benefit you, 
but we cannot be sure. For example, a common situation is that the study goggles results might require a brain scan that your 
ER doctor wouldn’t have ordered. The tests could show an important medical condition, like stroke , but i t might also turn out 
that these other tests don’t reveal anything, making them unnecessary. We bel ieve the goggles lead to tests that are medically 
necessary and decrease unnecessary tests, but we cannot be sure this will happen for you.  
 
5. Are there risks related to pregnancy?  
Pregnant women may not take part in this study because of unknown MRI/gadolin ium risks for an embryo or fetus. Women 
of childbearing potential may have a urine or blood pregnancy test , per institutional policy,  to confirm they are not pregnant.  
 
6. Are there benefits to being in the study?  
You may or may not benefit from being in this study. The information learned from this study may help others in the future.   
 
If you are assigned (by [CONTACT_3364]) to receive care guided by [CONTACT_697523]  (that might include input from a 
dizziness/ver tigo specialist) , the results may help you get better care in the ER, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and afterwards. The study goggles 
device has been shown in a small study to accurately diagnose inner ear versus brain causes of dizziness. We believe the 
study goggles will he lp your doctor get the correct diagnosis for the cause of your dizziness symptoms. If you are found to 
have an inner ear balance problem, we believe you may receive treatments that help you to get better faster, with fewer 
unnecessary tests. If you are fou nd to have a stroke causing your dizziness, you will get the best possible treatments, and

as part of the study. These tests may help you receive a correct diagnosis and correct treatments for dizziness.  
 
If you are assigned (by [CONTACT_3364]) to receive standard care, there i s no direct benefit to you from the study goggles testing 
during the ER visit. You may benefit from being examined by [CONTACT_697525]/vertigo/balance specialist one week after the ER 
visit. You may benefit from the MRI scan or other tests obtained as part of  the study. These tests may help you receive a 
correct diagnosis and correct treatments for dizziness, even if these problems were not diagnosed at the first ER visit.

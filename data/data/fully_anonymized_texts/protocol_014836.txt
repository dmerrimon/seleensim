powder is dry, sterilized, biocompatible, and non -pyrogenic.  It is resorbed within [ADDRESS_1063814]™ is composed predominantly of highly purified porcine collagen with smaller amounts of 
bovine chondroit in sulfate and human pooled plasma derived thrombin.  Each device contains a maximum 
of 1500  IU of thrombin.  Plasma donations are from US plasma centers only.  All individual donations of 
the plasma were tested for HBsAg, anti -HIV1/ -HIV2, and anti -HCV and  found to be negative.  The plasma 
pools were tested and found to be non -reactive for HCV RNA, HBV DNA, and HIV1 RNA as determined 
by [CONTACT_954] (NAT).  The product complies with the specifications of the manufacturer and World Health 
Organization (WHO).  
 
The man ufacturing procedures for HEMOBLAST™ include processing steps designed to reduce the risk 
of viral transmission.  
 
HEMOBLAST™ is approved by [CONTACT_6581] (FDA) for use  in 
surgical procedures as an adjunct to hemostasis when  control of minimal, mild, and moderate bleeding [ADDRESS_1063815] ™ is Biom’u p SA, which is located in Saint Priest, [LOCATION_009].   Biom’u p 
is ISO [ADDRESS_1063816] current definition is the “cessation of bleeding.” 3  The term comes from the Greek 
roots heme (blood) and stasis  (halt).  Hemostasis can be considered  as control of bleeding within the 
finely tuned balance of procoagulant, anticoagulant, fibrinolytic, and anti -fibrinolytic activities. 4 
 
Hemostasis refers to the process of causing blood to form a clot (the opposite of h emostasis is 
hemorrhage).  Most of the time, this process includes the changing of blood from a fluid to a solid state.  
  Protocol ETC [ADDRESS_1063817] blood vessels are central to moderating blood’s tendency to clot.  The endothelial cells of intact 
vessels prevent blood coagula tion by [CONTACT_774594] -like molecules and thrombomodulin and 
prevent platelet aggregation by [CONTACT_774595].  When endothelial injury 
occurs, the endothelial cells cease secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibit ors and instead secret 
von Willebrand factor and tissue thromboplastin which initiate s the maintenance of hemostasis after 
injury.  Hemostasis has three major steps: vasoconstriction, formation of a platelet plug, and blood 
coagulation.  
 
4.[ADDRESS_1063818] savings. 5, 6, 7 During  surgical 
operations,  it is important to maintain a fine balance between bleeding and clotting so that blood 
continues to flow to the tissues at the surgical site without excessive blood loss.  There are many tools 
used for hemorrhage control; these include preventive measures , transfusion of blood products, and 
traditional methods. [ADDRESS_1063819] pressure or compression at a bleeding site is 
often the surgeon ’s first choice to assist in the control of bleeding.  The placement of direct pressure over 
the injury site serves to compress  vascular structures and promote localized clotting.  Direct pressure, 
while widely accepted as standard of care for the control of all levels of bleeding severity, has limited 
discourse in the surgical literature.  Other mechanical methods, including sutu res, staples, and ligating 
clips, are useful if the source of bleeding is easily identifiable and able to be sealed. 7 
 
Compression and other mechanical methods may not be appropriate during all surgical procedures; this 
method of controlling bleeding may not be sufficient when the source of bleeding is hard to identify, as 
for diffuse venous bleeding. 8  Moreover, the mechanical methods are not  applicable in some surgical 
procedures  because of localization and the inaccessibility of structures.   
 
To summarize, conventional techniques show their limits in terms of bleeding control efficacy. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 
Furthermore , they may be associated with the occurrence of complications. 10 
 
4.3 Rationale  
 
Although the properties of the ideal local hemostatic agent may vary according to the surgical specialty, 
some properties are universally valued including: rapid and effective control/cessation of bleeding; ability 
to make effective contact [CONTACT_774596]; acceptable safety profile; and ease of preparation and 
use. 
 
According to Spotnitz et al., the ideal hemostat, sealant or adhesive must have certain performance 
characteristics (safety, efficacy, usability, cost , and approvability) that enable it to be used by [CONTACT_14085] .12   
Biom’up  has developed and manufactured a hemostatic device, HEMOBLAST ™, which is ready to use  
without any preparation  required .  This post -market study will be conducted to assess time to hemos tasis, 
which includes the time of device preparation.

representative must sign the informed consent form indicating that they have re ad and understand 
the information provided.  Each site will follow their local Institutional Review Board ( IRB) and 
applicable regulatory guidelines for obtaining informed consent.  Documentation of the informed 
consent process for each subject and the ori ginal signed informed consent will be retained at the 
site and as required by [CONTACT_5279] .  A copy of the signed informed consent will be 
provided to the subject.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1063828] fails to fulfil l any element of the preoperative eligibility criteria, this will be 
documented and any signed cons ent form and completed preoperative inclusion/exclusion criteria 
retained.  This information will be tracked on the Screening and Enrollment Log.  The subject will 
not be advanced any further into the clinical study . 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_1063829] will be allocated to the next available study  number (subject ID number) , which 
will be assigned . 
 
The subject ID num ber will consist of the site number and the subject number.  The subject number 
will be [ADDRESS_1063830].  
 
6.3 Preoperative Procedures and Evaluations  
 
The following data will be collected and recorded at the preoperative visit  on the Preoperative CRF : 
 
• Demographic data  
o Age 
o Gender  
o Race and ethnicity  
• Physical exam   
o Height  
o Weight  
• Medical history  
o Disease process (es) / indication (s) for surgery  
o Concomitant illnesses  
o Preoperative anticoagulation  and antiplatelet  regimen, if applicable  
 
6.[ADDRESS_1063831] procedures, including conventional 
methods of hemostasis  where practical  (pressure, ligature, cautery , etc. ). 
 
Both test and control devices  (not opened or prepared)  should be available at the start of each procedure.  
 
6.4.[ADDRESS_1063832] then meet all of the following intraoperative inclusion  criteria:  
 
• Subject does not have an active or suspected infection at the surgical site;  
• Subject in whom the Investigator is able to identify a TBS for which any applicable conventional 
means for hemostasis are ineffective or impractical; and

  Version 2 .0 
Confidential   Page 18 of 32 
 
The bleeding severity of the  TBS will be assessed  via the SBSS/SPOT GRADE™  for intraoperative 
inclusion, which is immediately prior to enrollment.  The bleeding severity of the TBS will also be assessed 
and confirmed immediately prior to hemostat application, as bleeding severity may  change between the 
time of enrollment and when the hemostat is ready to be applied.  Both bleeding severities will be re corded 
on the Intraoperative CRF.  Both bleeding severities will be presented in the analysis of the study data.  
 
If the bleeding sever ity at the time when the hemostat is ready to be applied is not minimal, mild, or 
moderate bleeding, then the TBS will not be treated.  If another suitable TBS is identified, the subject may 
undergo intraoperative evaluations for that TBS.  If another suit able TBS is not identified, the subject will 
be withdrawn from  the clinical study.

• [ADDRESS_1063835] ™; and  
• [ADDRESS_1063836] . 
 
A study -specific stopwatch  will be used in the performance evaluations.  
 
After randomization, the assigned hemostat will be opened and prepared.  The study -specific stopwatch 
will be started at the time of hemostat outer packaging opening (time 00:00).  
 
The assig ned hemostat will be prepared and applied to the TBS per its respective Instructions for Use (IFU).   
 
At time 03:00 (3 minutes after hemostat packaging opening), hemostasis will be assessed using the SPOT 
GRADE™.  If the TBS is hemostatic (SPOT GRADE™ score = 0), the performance evaluations are 
complete.  If the TBS is not hemostatic (SPOT GRADE™  score  > 0), a re -application of the assigned 
hemostat will be performed per the respective IFU.  
 
At time 0 5:00 ( 5 minutes after hemostat packaging opening), hemostasis will be assessed using the SPOT 
GRADE™.  If the TBS is not hemostatic (SPOT GRADE™ score > 0), the Investigator may use any means 
necessary to obtain hemostasis.  
 
The study -specific stopwatch will run continuously until the [ADDRESS_1063837] aff member.  In cases where 
the individual(s) involved in preparing the hemostat are required to perform other activities, the stopwatch 
will be paused and restarted when preparation resumes.  The number of interruptions will be recorded  for 
each case . 
 
6.4.3 Bleeding Severity and Hemostasis Evaluations  
 
Bleeding severity and hemostasis will be assessed using the SBSS  / SPOT GRADE™ at each time point . 
 
A SPOT GRADE™  score of 0 is equivalent to hemostasis.  All other SPOT GRADE™ scores are  
considered  failure of hemostasis.  See below in Table 6 .

7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
7.1 General  
 
An adverse event (AE) is ‘any untoward medical occurrence in a subject’.   
  Protocol ETC [ADDRESS_1063839] to its identity, quality, 
durability, reliability, safety or performance, which may include device malfunctions, use errors and 
inadequate labeling .  
 
Only Adverse Events (AE s) possibly, probably, or definitely related to the hemostatic device (using the 
definitions below) will be recorded as part of this clinical study.  A nticipated adverse device effects are 
included in Section 1 2. 
 
7.2 Adverse Event Documentation  
 
Only Adverse Events (AEs) possibly, probably, or definitely related to the hemostatic device (using the 
definitions below) will be recorded as part of this clinical study.  AEs not related to the hemostatic device 
(the AE is due to the underlying disease state or is du e to concomitant medications or therapy not related 
to the use of the hemostatic device) will not be recorded as part of this clinical study.  
 
AEs will be documented by [CONTACT_774598](s) at the study  site and 
also on th e Adverse Event CRF.  Adverse events are to be recorded and dated according to when they are 
first observed.  The subsequent treatment(s) should also be documented.  The following will be recorded 
on the Adverse Event CRF:  
 
• Accepted medical term for the AE; 
• Description of the event;  
• Date of onset;  
• Date of resolution, if applicable;  
• Outcome;  
• Treatment(s)/action(s) taken;  
• Severity;   
• Relationship to the hemostatic device; and  
• Determination of reportability (see Reporting Section below).  
 
The severity of the ev ent will be determined by [CONTACT_699550]:  
 
• Mild: the symptoms are transient, barely perceptible by [CONTACT_774599]; no treatment is usually prescribed to reduce these symptoms ; 
• Moderate: the symptoms are sufficiently severe to provoke discomfort in the subject and 
sufficiently uncomfortable to prevent normal activity; a treatment may be required ; or 
• Severe: the symptoms considerably modify the normal course of the subject’s activ ities or are 
disabling or are life -threatening; the treatment studied should be suspended; a treatment for the 
symptoms is prescribed . 
 
The relationship to the hemostatic device will be determined by [CONTACT_774600]:  
 
• Possi bly related: the AE has a reasonable temporal relationship to the use of the hemostatic 
device but alternative etiology is equally or more likely compared to the potential relationship to 
the use of the  hemostatic  device ; 
• Probably related: the AE has a str ong temporal relationship to the use of the hemostatic device 
and alternative etiology is less likely compared to the potential relationship to the use of the 
hemostatic device ; or 
  Protocol ETC 2018 -005 
  Version 2 .0 
Confidential   Page 22 of 32 
 
• Definitely related: the AE has a strong temporal relationship to the use of  the hemostatic device, 
follows a known response pattern and cannot reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_774601]’s clinical state or other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] . 
 
The expectedness of the AE will be determined by [CONTACT_5256]:  
 
• Anticipated; or  
• Unanticipated.  
 
Anticipated AEs are those that are identified as potential risks in the device labeling (e.g., IFU).  
Unanticipated AEs are those that are , by [CONTACT_15623], incidence, severity, or outcome,  not identified in the 
device labeling.  
 
7.3 Reporting  
 
A serious adverse event  (SAE)  is defined as an adverse event that:  
 
• Led to death ; 
• Led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in a life -threatening 
illness or injury, or a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or in -patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], or resulted in medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body 
structure or a body fun ction ; or 
• Led to fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
 
A serious adverse device effect (SADE) is defined as an adverse device effect that has resulted in any of 
the consequences characteristic of a serious adverse event  or that might have led to any of these 
consequences if suitable action had not been taken or intervention had not been made or if circumstances 
had been less opportune.  
 
An unanticipated  [serious]  adverse device effect (UADE /[LOCATION_003]DE ) is any serious adverse effect on health 
or safety, any life -threatening problem or death cause d by, or associated with a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol; 
or any other unanticipate d serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or 
welfare of subjects.

11.2 General Analysis Considerations  
 
All statistical analyses will be performed using Powe r BI, SAS ®, and/or R.  Unless otherwise specified, all 
continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics, which will include the number of 
subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum.  All categorical endpoints will 
be summarized using  frequencies and percentages.   
 
11.2.1  Analysis Populations  
 
Safety analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Population, defined as all subjects who were 
randomized into the study and received study intervention.  Efficacy analyses will be conducted on th e time 
to hemostasis  (TTH ) Analysis Population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, received study 
intervention, and had a TTH assessment recorded regardless of whether the measurement was censored 
(defined as the use of an additional hemostatic p roduct or surgical rescue prior to the end of observation 
time, or failing to achieve and maintain complete hemostasis prior to the end of observation time).  Data 
summaries will be based on the intervention received, regardless of which intervention was r andomly 
assigned.  
 
11.2.[ADDRESS_1063849]™ arm will be considered treatment failures while 
hemostasis at 3 minutes will be imputed for all values censored prior to 3 minutes on the FLOSEAL arm.   
 
11.2.3  Subgroup Analyses  
 
Analyses of performance  (primary and secondary endpoints) will be presented by [CONTACT_774602] . Additionally, the primary and secondary endpoints  will be presented stratified by  [CONTACT_774603].

The number of subjects randomized to each treatment arm will be tabulated. Demogra phic variables will 
include age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight , and Body Mass Index (BMI) .  Baseline disease 
charac teristics will include indication(s)  for surgery and related co -morbidities /concomitant illnesses . All 
continuous endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics, that will include the number of 
subjects (n), mean, standard deviation, median, min imum, and maximum.  All categorical endpoints will

11.2.[ADDRESS_1063851] compliance 
with completing the study  evaluation s is not an issue and will not be reported.    
 
11.2.7  Protocol Deviations  
 
Eligibility criteria that were not met will be listed along with whether or not an exception was granted.  
Important protocol deviations will be summarized by [CONTACT_1570].  Important protocol deviations are 
defined as:  
 
- Any unauthorized protocol deviations that result in a significant added risk to the study subject ; 
- Performing study -specific activities without subject written informed consent;  
- Non-adherence to eligibility cr iteria without prior Sponsor approval ; and 
- Non-adherence to Good Clinical Practice and/or applicable regulations ; 
- Protocol deviations will be summarized in tables produced by [CONTACT_774604].  
 
Protocol deviations will be either self -reported by [CONTACT_774605]/Sponsor

11.3   Analytic Methods  
 
11.3.1  Analysis of Primary and Secondary  Efficacy Endpoints  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Analysis Population  
 
Efficacy analyses will be conducted on the TTH Population, defined as all subjects who were randomized, 
received study intervention, and had a TTH assessment recorded regardless of whether the measurement 
was censo red.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Methods of Analysis  
 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the difference in the probability of TTH at [ADDRESS_1063852] ™ to FLOSEAL .  Letting θ denote the true difference in the probability of hemostasis at [ADDRESS_1063853]™ to FLOSEAL, the trial will test the null hypothesis H 0: θ   0 vs. the 
alternative hypothesis H A: θ > [ADDRESS_1063854]. The resulting p -value based upon 
the asymptotic normal distribution and a corresponding (2 -sided) 95 % confidence interval for the difference 
in binomial proportions (HEMOBLAST™ minus FLOSEAL) will also be computed and reported.

randomized into the study and received study intervention.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Methods of Analysis  
 
Summaries of the number and percent of subjects with at least one device -related AE  will be provided.  
Comparisons of the proportion of subject s experienc ing SADEs and UADEs  will be made between 
treatment arms.  
    
11.3.3  Sample Size Justification  
 
The sample size for the proposed study is based on : 
 
• Type I error α = 0.0 25 (one-sided);  
• Type II error β = 0.10;  
• δ = 0.30;  
• θHEMOBLAST™  = 0.40 at 3 minutes; and  
• θFLOSEAL  = 0.10 at 3 minutes.  
 
Based upon the above model specification, the proposed study will require approximately N=98 patients 
(49 patients per arm).  While early discont inuation is expected to be rare, to account for potential loss of 
patients due to early discontinuation, a total of N=104 subjects (52 patients per arm) will be enrolled in 
order to ensure at least 90% power under the design assumptions while allowing for up to 5% attrition.  
   
12 RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
 
12.1 Anticipated Clinical Benefits  
 
It is anticipated that application of a hemostatic  device to a bleeding site will result in a reduced time to 
hemostasis compared to conventional methods of hemostasis  (pressure, suture, or cautery) .  Individual 
subjects may not directly bene fit from participation in this study .  However , conducting this research 
could contribute to the overall advancement of medical and scientific knowledge and may benefit future 
patients.  
 
12.[ADDRESS_1063855]™ include:  
 
• Adhesion formation;  
• Allergy or anaphylaxis;  
• Blockage of cardiopulmonary by[CONTACT_774606];  
• Compromised attachment of orthopedic implants;  
• Creutzfeldt -Jakob disease (CJD) agent;  
• Increased infection;  
• Nerve compression;  
• Thrombosis or thromboembolism;  
  Protocol ETC 2018 -005

• Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE); and  
• Viral disease transmission.  
 
Hypersensitivity of allergic/anaphylactoid reactions may occur with HEMOBLAST™.  Symptoms 
associated with allergic anaphylactic re actions include: flush, urticaria, pruritus, nausea, drop in blood 
pressure, tachycardia or bradycardia, dyspnea, severe hypotension, and anaphylactic shock.  
 
These reactions may occur in patients receiving HEMOBLAST™ for the first time or may increase wit h 
repetitive applications of HEMOBLAST™.  In the event of hypersensitivity reactions, discontinue 
administration of HEMOBLAST™.  Mild reactions can be managed with antihistamines.  Severe 
hypotensive reactions require immediate intervention using current p rinciples of shock therapy.  
 
Subjects randomized to receive the control are exposed to risks associated  with FLOSEAL , as described 
in the current device labeling.  
 
Participation in this clinical study  also presents additional risks or inconveniences.  These may include, 
but are not limited to:  
 
• Additional intraoperative assessments of bleeding severity at 3 and 5  minutes.  
 
There may also be other unforeseen risks.  
 
12.3 Risk/Benefit Analysis  
 
Individual patients may experience no direct benefit from participation in the study.  However, a potential 
benefit of HEMOBLAST ™ to be investigated in the study include s a higher probability of hemostasis 
within [ADDRESS_1063856] device specifications ; further, the test device has been 
approved by [CONTACT_774607] .  Risk mitigation steps are also implemented in the manufacture and shipment 
of the test device .

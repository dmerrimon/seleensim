Protocol version number and  date: Version #1 May 2, 2017      
 
Research Question and Aims  
 
Hypothesis: I t is hypothesized that a re al- time, interactive, mobile education system will demonstrate improved 
pa
in associated outcomes,  and higher patient participation when compared to the current standard education 
delivery method. 
 
Aims, purpose, or objectives: This study seeks to understand the difference between two different education 
de
livery methodologies and the effect on the postoperative pain experience, including participation in treatment 
plan, knowledge, pain outcomes, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965].

 Background ( In clude relevant experience, gaps in current knowledge, preliminary data, etc .):   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_499189], modern devices, and nonpharmacological interventions, pain in the 
acute post-surgical period remains a prominent issue and effective management has remained elusive with 
significant gaps in care. Early estimates suggest that anywhere from 50% to 75% of surgical patients experience 
inadequate pain relief (Huang et al., 2001), often due to delayed intervention (Sinatra, Torres, & Bustos, 2002).  
A National Survey of patients who had undergone non-specific surgical care demonstrated occurrence of acute 
pain in 80% of patients and moderate to severe pain in approximately 86% of those who experienced acute pain 
(Apfelbaum, Chen, Mehta, & Gan, 2003). A 2008 study of 1,490 surgical inpatients, 41% of patients reported 
severe pain in the first 24 hours after surgery (Sommer, de Rijke, van Kellef, et al., 2008). Watt-Watson, 
Stevens, Garfunkel, Steiner, & Gallop (2001) found severe pain in 86% of coronary artery by[CONTACT_499198] 24 
hours after surgery. A chart review revealed that 80% of these patients experiencing severe pain received ˂[ADDRESS_642318] (Watt-
Watson eat al., 2001). Ineffective pain management effects recovery, complications, cost (Gordon, Dahl, & 
Stevenson, 2000), patient satisfaction (Garimella & Cellini, 2013), length of stay (Joshi, Beck, Emerson, et al., 
2014)
, readmissions (ASA, 2012), quality of life (Ersek, 2001), and chronic postsurgical pain (O’Brien, 
Pergolizzi, van de Laar, et al, 2103; Barrington, Halaszynski, & Sinatra, 2014). 
Effective pain management is the use of appropriate pain modalities to improve the pain experience 
while balancing the goal of optimal pain relief with patient safety to prevent adverse outcomes (Hayes & 
Gordon, 2015). In the surgical setting, effective and safe pain management poses significant challenges for 
nurses, providers, and healthcare organizations. This is due in part to the multifactorial influences that result in 
inadequate pain management including substandard assessment of pain (Michales, Hubbartt, Carroll, & 
Hudson
-Barr, 2006), limited clinician knowledge to manage pain effectively, and poor patient engagement 
(Innis, Bikaunieks, Petryshen, Zellermeyer, & Ciccarelli, 2004). From the patient perspective, effective pain 
management is reliant on their knowledge, engagement, and the ability to effectively report pain symptoms 
(The Joint Commission, 2009). Patient reported dissatisfaction and poor pain outcomes have been linked to 
insufficient education and limited patient-provider communication (Subramanian, Ramasamy, Hoong, Chinna, 
&Rosli, 2016; Smith, Rhodes, Paciotti, et al., 2015; Helfand & Freeman, 2009). These gaps faced by [CONTACT_499199], opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and side effects (Helfand & Freeman, 2009; Morrison RS, 
Meier DE, Fischberg et al., 2006). Clinical outcomes, including pain reporting, opi[INVESTIGATOR_8560], pain scores, 
a
nd satisfaction may be improved with focused patient education and knowledge acquisition (Mularski, White-
C
hu, Overbay, Miller, Asch, & Ganzini, 2006). The literature suggests that patients lack the needed knowledge 
to ef
fectively manage opi[INVESTIGATOR_499190] (Horwitz et al., 2013; AJN, 2015). 
Lack of knowledge, medication safety concerns (misuse), and risk for adverse effects are most prominent in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve patient experiencing acute pain (AJN, 2015). A panel of clinical experts from the APS and the 
Ame
rican Anesthesia Association made the following recommendations “clinicians provide patient and family-
centered, individually tailored education to the patient (and/or responsible caregiver), including information on 
treatment options for management of postoperative pain, and document the plan and goals for postoperative 
pain management” (Chou et al., 2016, pg. 133) followed by [CONTACT_499200] “pain 
management plan on the basis of adequacy of pain relief and presence of adverse events” (Chou et al., 2016, pg. 
135).  
In 2016, the NIH and the American Pain Society (APS) both issued gaps in research to guide clinical 
practice. Research gaps exist in nearly every aspect of pain management. One gap of note is the role of pain 
management patient education and engagement on recovery, pain relief, adverse effects, safety, and long term 
outcomes in patients undergoing major joint arthroplasty (TJA) (NIH, 2016; Gordon, Leon-Casasola, Wu et al., 
2016)
. Research is needed to understand the effectiveness of educational methods, delivery mechanisms, and 
  Effective: 8/14/2017 
 
D:\DNP research\ IRB-Application-Patient Education-PainOutcomesFinalEdit.docx  Page [ADDRESS_642319] influence of pain management education on patients’ recovery, 
engagement, pain relief, adverse effects, safety, and long term outcomes. These gaps are consistent with the 
identified research gaps from the NIH and APS. The use of technology in clinical practice and patient 
education, such as mobile applications, patient portals, and iPads, are only just beginning to be explored in the 
last five to ten years. Further research is needed to understand the effectiveness, barriers, and use of eHealth 
delivery models. One barrier to eHealth delivery is adoption and use of technology in the elderly populations. 
The elderly population has lagged in the acceptance and adaptation to technology. Only 59% of seniors use the 
internet and computer, compared to 86% of all adults (Smith, 2014). The adoption of technology in this 
population is potentiated by [CONTACT_499201] (arthritis, and vision changes), skeptical attitudes about the 
benefits of technology, and difficulty with learning how to use digital devices. However, a paradigm shift is 
occurring with a 6% annual increase in the number of seniors using technology (Smith, 2014). This trend is 
anticipated to continue, making technology less of a challenge in health information delivery. The average age 
of patients undergoing TJA surgery is 67years of age. As such, consideration and further research into the 
adoption of eHealth delivery in this population is necessary. Additionally, each education delivery method 
poses several advantages and disadvantages. Verbal 1:[ADDRESS_642320] 
interaction and questions yet is costly, time consuming, and is associated with limited memory recall (Knowles, 
Holton, Swanson, 2011). This style of education is often used in conjunction with written text in the form of 
booklets or pamphlets. Written education allows for mass distribution of educational content but is associated 
with printing expenses and low patient compliance (Knowles, Holton, Swanson, 2011). Conversely, internet 
based education is interactive, easily accessible, simple, and visually appealing (Knowles, Holton, Swanson, 
2011). Depending on an organization’s technological capabilities, internet based education may not be 
attainable due to technical limitations and cost (Knowles, Holton, Swanson, 2011) . The research study proposed 
he
re seeks to understand the difference and effectiveness of educational methods and delivery mechanisms 
using mobile applications compared to standard education delivery (verbal and written) to determine the impact 
on pain outcomes, pain experience, patient participation, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]. 
 
Study Design and Methods  
 
Methods:  Describe, in detail, the research activities that will be conducted under this protocol :   
Variables 
The independent variable is the type of patient education deliverable given to the two study arms, group 
A (experimental group, real-time, interactive, mobile education system) and group B (control group, standard of 
care). The dependent variables are 1) patient knowledge, 2) patient perceived participation in pain management, 
3) high and low pain scores, and 4) total opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556]. A simple table of the independent, dependent, and 
additional variables are presented in Appendix B. A detailed accounting of all data points including variable 
type, theoretical definitions, and operational definitions can be found in the detailed code book.

D:\DNP research\ IRB-Application-Patient Education-PainOutcomesFinalEdit.docx  Page [ADDRESS_642321] 
education the other unit will offer the mobile, iPad based education. The patient care unit to offer the mobile, 
iPad based education will be selected at random. This study design will help minimize will reduce the risk of 
selection bias, increase fidelity of the intervention, and increases the probability that the differences 
demonstrated between the study groups will be attributed to the actual intervention under study.   
S
tudy participants will be  assigned into one of two study arms,  intervention or control, based on random 
a
ssignment to  the two  designated units. At  the time  of consent, patients will be informed that there are two 
stud
y arms and that some subjects will receive enhanced pain management education; however, subjects will 
not
 explicitly be informed if  they are in  the intervention or control arm of the study. Participants who have 
ve
rbally consented will receive a HIPAA authorization form accompanied by a letter reminding them of the 
stud
y and their consent to  participate at  the time of the preoperative visit. This typi[INVESTIGATOR_499191]. Participants will be asked to sign the HIPAA authorization form and return the clinical staff. 
P
articipants will be provided an extra copy for their records. No Patient data will be collected prior to this. Once 
HIPAA has been signed participants will complete the intake survey provided with the packet of information.   
Researchers are blinded to  the study arm the participant was enrolled in until after consent has been 
obtaine
d, the patient is enrolled in the study, and has been admitted to  the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_499192] a bed. Once 
e
nrolled and consented, bed control will be notified to  assign the patient(s) to one of the two designated patient 
c
are units with no specific direction offered on which unit the patient(s) should be assigned to. The only 
dire
ction provided will be  to split the patients evenly between the two units. Only ten study arm participants 
ma
y be enrolled and  active at  one time. This is limited  based on the number of available  iPad devices for the 
purpo
ses of this study.  
S
tudy Population 
The target population is adult patients undergoing elective, lower extremity total joint arthroplasty 
(TJA). Candidates for inclusion are adult patients over the age of 18 years undergoing surgical intervention and 
inpatient care for one of the following procedures, total hip arthroplasty (THA) (primary, bilateral, and revision) 
a
nd total knee arthroplasty (TKA) (p rimary, bilateral, unicompartmental, and revision). Patients must be fluent 
in the English language. Patients will be excluded if  they are undergoing more complex hip and knee 
pr
ocedures such as  implant resections with or without spacer placement, liner exchange, or  THA or unipolar hip 
arthroplasty related to  repair of hip fracture. Patients will also be excluded if  there are preexisting physical or 
cognitive limitations that would hinder their ability to use the mobile application. 
S
ample Size  
Assuming a moderate effect size 0.50 (Cohen’s d), a power of 80% (0.80), and an alpha of 0.05, 64 
participants are needed in each study arm (Polit, 2010). Due to limited time scope, a minimum of 150 patients 
will be approached for potential participation. If time allows and additional subjects are needed to achieve the 
desired sample size, additional candidates will be approached to reach the recommended total of 128 patients, 
divided between the two study arms.

 Recruitment and Consent 
 Eligible patients will be identified using surgeon referral and/or electronic surgical listing reports. 
Enrollment into the study is  completely voluntary. Patients will be recruited at the time of perioperative phone 
c
onsultation with nursing. This consultation occurs approximately two weeks prior to their scheduled surgical 
pr
ocedure. At this time patients will be introduced to the study by [CONTACT_499202]. If the patient expresses 
interest, verbal consent will be obtained and documented at the time of the call by [CONTACT_499203]. Consent designees will read the consent script and provide any necessary time to answer the patients’ 
questions. At the time  of consent, patients will be informed that there are two study arms and that some subjects 
will
 receive enhanced pain management education; however, subjects will not explicitly be informed if  they are 
in the intervention or control arm of the study.  
Enr
ollment into the study is  completely voluntary. Participating in  this study poses minimal risk to  the 
pa
rticipants; all patients will receive the necessary education to meet their care needs and the minimum standard 
of
 practice. The potential for risk is  that the mode of information/education delivery does not meet the patients’ 
ne
eds and the risk of low acceptance of technology use. In this case,  patients in the study arm would be 
re
moved from the study and would receive standard education. Pain management in  both arms  will remain the 
sa
me; no changes will be made to  the process for treating pain using either non-pharmacologic or 
pharma
cologic interventions. Medication orders, medication administration, and pain treatment plans will not 
be
 affected by  [CONTACT_499204]. As care is  today, pain management will be customized to  meet the needs 
of
 the individual patient.  
Or
al consent will be obtained, documented, and maintained as  part of the research records. No  
identifia
ble patient information will be maintained. The only identifiable information collected will be the 
pa
tients’ clinic number. It will be used for tracking purposes only until the data collection process is  complete. 
W
hen the chart audit is  complete, the clinic numbers will be removed from the data set and only the 
pr
edesignated subject number will be used and maintained. At  the start of the study the patient will be asked to  
c
omplete the HIPAA Authorization to Use and Disclose Protected Health Information. The researcher will 
re
main blinded to  the type of education delivery that the patient will receive until after enrolment and bed 
a
ssignment. This will prevent potential bias with inadvertently assigning patients to  groups based on 
c
haracteristics, like age. 
The
re is a risk for disclosure of personal protected information. The electronic data will be stored on an  
int
ernal secure server. If transport of electronic data is  necessary for any reason an  encrypted storage device will 
be
 used. Paper and pencil surveys will be stored in  a locked cabinet, in a locked and secure office. The 
re
searcher and the RN  will be responsible to data entry into SPSS.  The RN will be trained by  [CONTACT_499205] 
S
PSS data entry. Access to the data will be restricted to only research personnel approved on the IRB 
a
pplication. The RNs will complete the institution’s IRB education requirements for staff assisting with 
research data. Limiting the number of staff involved will reduce the potential for data entry errors.   
Setting  
The intervention and data collection will be collected on orthopedic patients admitted to two orthopedic 
inpatient care units who have undergone major joint replacement surgery at a large academic medical center in 
the upper Midwest. Between the two units there are 50 dedicated orthopedic beds that admit more than 9,000 
orthopedic patients annually. Included in the annual orthopedic admits are approximately 4,000 major total joint 
arthroplasties. Based on historical admission data and patient volumes the desired sample size is feasible. 
Patients relocated to non-orthopedic units due to high patient census will not be included in the study. The goal 
is to recruit 20 patients on a weekly basis, ten in each arm of the study. Due to the restricted number of iPads 
  Effective: 8/14/2017 
 
D:\DNP research\ IRB-Application-Patient Education-PainOutcomesFinalEdit.docx  Page 7 of 15 
 available, only ten patients may be enrolled in the study arm at any point in time. The total divided sample of 
124 patients should be achievable within ten weeks from the start of the study.  
Intervention  
Study group. The participants in the study arm will receive comprehensive pain management education 
de
livered using mobile iPads at the point of care. The mobile based education modules will be inclusive of the 
use of the pain rating scale and assessment of pain; communication with healthcare providers; daily 
expectations for pain and pain management; pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment options; 
medication side effects and safety; and discharge instructions including safe handling of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], disposal, 
tapering, and when to call the provider. It will also include an interactive pain and discomfort menu, knowledge 
based questions, and medication tracking log. The content has been developed using existing Mayo Clinic 
patient education materials (videos and written text) developed by [CONTACT_499206]. The mobile application covers a curriculum of 
the most common concerns and questions individual experiencing pain have as presented by [CONTACT_499207] (2014), 
Horwitz et al. (2013), AJN (2015), and Chou et al. (2016). The content presented in the application is 
c
omprehensive, compi[INVESTIGATOR_499193], comprehensive, and convenient way. The mobile application uses multiple teaching 
methodologies to accommodate different learning needs, including written text; short videos; illustrated 
graphics, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], and guides; interactive checklists; knowledge based questions; and frequently asked 
questions. The program was developed using Mayo Clinic Care Connect as the build platform in collaboration 
with the Department of Social Media. The Web-based platform where this pain program is housed was 
successfully trialed in [ADDRESS_642322] the patient on how to use the iPad and the program. The device will remain with the patient until 
discharge. The patient, independently or with the nurse, may use the program at any point during the inpatient 
care experience. The RN will use the iPad to engage patients in their pain management and care. Intervention 
fidelity will be monitored by [CONTACT_499208]/or directly 
engaged the patient in pain education using the mobile device. A checklist will be available on the patients chart 
for the RN to complete at the end of each shift through the duration of the patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  
Control group. The control group will receive the current standard of care which consists of verbal 
inst
ruction and pain management pamphlets. At a minimum, the patients will receive two educational pamphlets 
titled Your Pain and Discomfort Management Menu  and Communicating About Your Pain . The  pain 
management menu is designed to provide the patient with basic pain information with a focus on non-
pharmacologic pain interventions. The pain communication pamphlet offers a more comprehensive explanation 
about pain, assessment of pain (0-10 scale), communicating with the healthcare providers, and pain 
management options. The content of these two documents is a portion of the education the study patients will 
receive using the mobile application. These two documents are existing educational material available through 
the Department of Patient Education. These educational materials were developed by [CONTACT_499209]. Verbal instruction is 
inconsistent and is nurse dependent. At a minimum the nurse is instructed to provide the two pamphlets to the 
patient and follow-up with the patient to address any questions. Additional printed education materials are 
available through the department of patient education and verbal instruction may be tailored based on nursing 
assessment and patient need. It is important to note that all educational content available to the study 
participants is available to the control group in different forms or functions. Fidelity to standard of care will be

 monitored by [CONTACT_499208]/or directly engaged the 
patient in pain education using standard pamphlet educational material. A checklist will be available on the 
patients chart for the RN to complete at the end of each shift through the duration of the patients hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].     
M
anagement of interventions and study participants. The implementation of the interventions in the 
stud
y and control arm will be closely monitored by [CONTACT_3021]. Educational in-services for all shifts will be 
held on various days. Education will include the research protocol, goals of the study, use of the mobile iPad 
pa
tient education in practice, and data collection procedures. To ensure all staff have access to the education, a 
brief video will be disseminated via e-mail to be viewed at staff convenience prior to the start of the study. 
Participants in the study will be denoted by a specific color coded label at the door. This will notify and flag 
direct care staff to ensure that the appropriate study protocol is followed. The research protocol for each arm of 
the stud
y and instructions for the mobile education application will be placed in the research reference book, 
located at each nursing sub-station. For participants whom are enrolled in the study arm, the researcher will 
deliver the iPad either directly to the patient or to the bedside RN caring for the patient. The RN will receive 
one-on-one, just in time education at the point of device delivery. The researcher will also make daily rounds 
and random care observations with nurses caring for participants enrolled in the study. Additional education and 
reminders will be offered at the point of care and as needed.  
Instruments 
Patient demographics and clinical characteristics. Patient demographics and past medical history will 
be
 collected as part of the study (Appendix D). Patient demographic variables to be collected include age, race, 
education level, marital status, and employment status. Specific confounding variables associated with the type 
of intervention and outcome will be collected including patients’ preferred learning style, comfort level with 
tec
hnology, and anxiety. Preferred learning style will be assessed using the three styles of learning reading, 
seeing, doing, or listening (Bastable, 2008). Comfort level with technology will be assessed using a five-point 
Lickert scale with zero being, “not comfortable at all” and five being “very comfortable.” Anxiety associated 
with anticipated pain will be assessed on ten-point. Relevant past medical and surgical history will also be 
collected including past major orthopedic surgeries, chronic pain, preoperative use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and mental health 
conditions. The patient demographic collection form will be administered using paper and pencil survey. The 
patient will be given the form when they arrive to the ambulatory orthopedic clinic for their perioperative visit, 
one to two days prior to their scheduled surgery. It will take participants approximately five minutes to 
complete the survey.  
Pain outcomes. The Revised American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R) will 
be
 used to evaluate the patients’ perception of their pain management experience and outcomes (Appendix E). 
The
 APS-POQ-R is a [ADDRESS_642323] measuring non-pharmacologic management. These 6 aspects include (1) pain severity and relief; (2) 
impact of pain on activity, sleep, and negative emotions; (3) side effects of treatment; (4) helpfulness of 
information about pain treatment; (5) ability to participate in pain treatment decisions; and (6) use of 
nonpharmacological strategies (Gordon, Polomano, Pellino et al., 2010). There are 14 symptom-based questions 
to indicate symptom severity using a ten-point scale (0-10). The higher the score, the more severe the symptom 
experience. Two additional symptom-based questions explore severity of pain over time and pain relief using a 
ten-point scale with a range of 0% to 100%. For pain severity over time, a higher score indicates a higher 
incidence of severe pain in 24 hours. For pain relief, a higher score indicates a more positive response to pain 
relief. These data points will help determine the effectiveness of the intervention on pain outcomes (pain 
scores). Three questions are associated with the pain education experience. Using a ten-point scale (0-10), the 
hig
her response scores indicate a more positive experience rating. Pain experience here is assessed by 
  [CONTACT_499210]: 8/14/2017 
 
D:\DNP research\ IRB-Application-Patient Education-PainOutcomesFinalEdit.docx  Page 9 of 15 
 generalized satisfaction with pain relief and participation in treatment decisions. These data points will help 
determine the influence of pain education on satisfaction with educational material/delivery and participation. 
The reported participation score will be used to measure the degree to which the patient is engaged by a means 
of active participation in care and treatment. The remainder of the survey questions use a single word 
association to answer the question rather than a measurable scale. The APS-POQ-R has demonstrated adequate 
psychometrics, construct validity, reliability, and clinical feasibility. Internal consistency reliability was 
acceptable with a Cronbach α of 0.86. The individual subscales were also assessed for reliability with the 
resulting Cronbach α as follows affective subscale, α = 0.82; pain severity and sleep interference subscale, α = 
0.83; perceptions of pain care subscale, α = 0.70; interference with activity, α = 0.82; and adverse effects 
subscale, α = 0.63 (Gordon, Polomano, Pellino et al., 2010). This tool is open source and available for 
application without further permission (Gordon, Polomano, Pellino et al., 2010). 
Pain knowledge. The Patient Pain Questionnaire (PPQ) will be used to evaluate pain knowledge post 
int
ervention (Appendix F). The PPQ is a 16-item questionnaire measuring both pain knowledge and actual 
e
xperiences with pain. This study will use only nine of the items targeted at pain knowledge and beliefs. The 
nine knowledge-based questions use a ten-point (0-10) ordinal scale to assess patients’ agreement or 
disagreement with statements about pain relief, medication administration, addiction, dosing, timing, non-
pharmacologic management, side effects, beliefs about pain medications, and changes in the pain experience. 
Depending on the statement a higher score may indicate either agreement or disagreement with the statement. 
All items have been formatted so that zero indicates the most positive outcome and a ten indicates the most 
negative outcome. These nine items are primarily used for chronic cancer pain; however the PPQ has been and 
can be adapted to assess general pain knowledge and experiences. Psychometric analysis of the PPQ 
demonstrated content validity of 0.90 (content validity index), construct validity of <0.05 variance, concurrent 
validity (r=0.60; p <0.05), test-retest reliability (r=0.80), and internal consistency with a Cronbach α of 0.71 
(Ferrel & Rivera, 1997). The language will also be revised, as in the study conducted by [CONTACT_499211] (2009) and 
reference to chronic cancer pain will be removed from the original question. This tool is open source and 
available for application without further permission and may be utilized by [CONTACT_248390] (City of 
Hope Pain and Palliative Care Resource Center, 2017; MIDSS, n.d.).  
At the start of the study and at the time of discharge the patient will complete the APS-POQ-R and the 
revised knowledge-based PPQ surveys. It will take participants approximately 10 minutes to complete the two 
surve
ys. The use of  these two widely used instruments will ensure that the information being collected is  highly 
re
liable and valid, truly measuring what the study is seeking to evaluate. These paper and pencil surveys will be 
pr
ovided to  the patient prior  to discharge and collected from the patient by  [CONTACT_499212] (RN) and/or 
c
harge nurse.  In addition to  training and education on the intervention, staff will receive direction on the data 
(survey)  collection process and requirements. 
Chart
 audits. Chart audits of the electronic health record will be conducted after discharge to collect the 
re
maining clinical data. Data to be collected will include total opi[INVESTIGATOR_499194]; primary surgical procedure as reported in the surgical listing and the 
operative report; type of regional anesthesia as indicated in the anesthesia record; length of stay; and discharge

sition as reported in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_499195]. Additionally, the past medical history will be 
reviewed to confirm patient reported history of chronic pain, preoperative use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], and mental health 
conditions. The researcher and a staff RN will conduct these chart audits.  
Limitations 
 The design of this study does present some limitations. Participants in the study group will receive 
enhanced pain content that is delivered using an alternative method, ultimately testing both the delivery method 
and the content. The duality of the study intervention is a confounding variable and may make differentiating

 the cause of the outcome difficult. Another limitation is that preoperative educational classes are available to 
patients to attend if they choose. All patients receive the same pamphlets and information in the mail when 
surgery is scheduled. An in-person didactic class is optional for patients. Some pain education is offered in this 
class. Currently only 49% of patients attend these classes. It is anticipated that some patients enrolled in the 
stud
y will have received varying levels of education prior to their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063]. This is an antecedent 
variable that will be collected as part of the chart audit and accounted in the data analysis. The two nursing units 
invol
ved in the study are located within the same hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. It is possible that nursing staff from the intervention 
unit may float to the control unit and educate study patients using content from the expanded education from the 
intervention on the iPads. P re-testing knowledge of pain and measured again at the end of the intervention 
(pr
epost) using a paired t-test analysis will strengthen the design of the study. Only opi[INVESTIGATOR_499196]. 
Data Management 
Data Collection Procedure 
Data will be collected at three points in time using paper and pencil survey’s and chart audits. The data 
c
ollection protocol can  be found in Appendix G. After completion of the HIPAA form, demographic and past 
medic
al history information and pain knowledge survey will be administered in the ambulatory clinic at the 
ti
me of the perioperative surgical visit. A paper and pencil survey/form will be provided to the patient when 
they arrive in the clinic for their perioperative appointment and returned to the desk staff when completed. 
The intervention will occur on the postoperative inpatient care unit (PCU) starting at the time the patient 
arrives on the unit from the post anesthesia care unit (PACU). The intervention will continue through the course 
of care until discharge. At the time of discharge the patient will complete the Revised American Pain Society 
Patient Outcomes Questionnaire (APS-POQ-R) (Gordon et al., 2010) and the revised knowledge-based Patient 
Pain Questionnaire (PPQ) (Ferrell &Rivera, 1997; Reynolds, 2009). The use of these two widely used 
instruments will ensure that the information being collected is  highly reliable  and valid, truly measuring what 
the
 study is  seeking to evaluate. These paper and pencil survey’s will be provided to the patient prior to 
discha
rge and collected from the patient by  [CONTACT_499212] (RN) and/or charge nurse.  In addition to  
tra
ining and education on the intervention, staff will receive direction on the data (survey) collection process 
a
nd requirements. The administration of the post-intervention surveys at  the point of care, before the patient has 
left the study environment, will help to prevent the loss of study participants due to  non-response or failure to  
c
omplete follow-up surveys.  
Af
ter discharge the researcher will conduct  a chart review to  collect clinical data including opi[INVESTIGATOR_499197], past medical history, anesthesia type, and length of stay. The researcher in  addition to one 
RN will be responsible for chart audit data collection. The RNs will be trained by  [CONTACT_499213]. The RNs will complete the institutions IRB education requirements for staff assisting with research 
da
ta. A tentative timeline has been developed as  a GNATT chart in Appendix H. All collected data from the 
pa
per sur veys’ and chart audits will be entered in  to SPSS for analysis. Data storage and management is  
discusse
d further under ethical considerations.

Data Analysis Plan  
The pre-intervention and post-intervention, paper surveys’ will be returned to  the researcher for data 
e
ntry and storage. The collected data will be collated and entered by  [CONTACT_499215]. 
A detailed code book has been developed to  include specific information on  the type of variable and the 
theor
etical and operational definitions. Data entry will be double-checked for accuracy by  [CONTACT_499216]. Descriptive statistics will be performed on 
e
ach study variable. Continuous variables, including pain scores, pain knowledge, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965], will 
be reported using a mean and standard deviation. Categorical variables, including patient characteristics and 
education engagement, will be reported as frequencies and percent occurrence. The data will be examined for 
any baseline differences between the groups to identify characteristics that may confound results and require 
c
ontrol in the analysis. Data will  be examined to assure that it meets the assumptions of normality required for 
parametric analysis. If data does not meet normality assumptions, nonparametric analyses will be used. This 
stud
y uses a revised adaption of the Patient Pain Questionnaire (PPQ) survey. For this reason, the reliability and 
va
lidity of the nine knowledge based questions will be evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha and factor analysis.   
This s
tudy will explore the difference between two types of education delivery methods and the effect 
on pain scores, participation, knowledge, and opi[INVESTIGATOR_4965]. The difference amongst the two study groups 
will
 be analyzed using an independent t-test. Using the population mean of each group a t statistic will be 
computed. The independent t-test was selected because this statistical test is appropriate when there are two 
groups that are not the same people and are not connected to one another in any other systematic way (Polit, 
2010). Additionally, the requirements for the t-test fit with the design of the study and variables. The 
independent variable must be dichotomous nominal level indicating a participants’ status in one of the two 
groups and the dependent variable must maintain the characteristics of interval-scale or ratio (Polit, 2010).

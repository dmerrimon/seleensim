comply with the st udy procedures, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], are to 
be excluded. 
14. Acute illness within [ADDRESS_667830] is asymptomat ic but has a 
left ventricular ejection fraction <4 0% at Screening, the investigator 
should discuss inclusion of subject in the study with the S afety Review 
Committee .

weeks prior to ant icipated study drug administration. 
 
Dose/Route/Regimen  
(Test Article)  Eteplirsen, casimersen, or golodirsen (each at 30 mg/kg) will be administered 
as an IV infusion over [ADDRESS_667831] size.  
 
Statistical Methods  Efficacy Analyses:  
The analysis of changes in dystrophin expr ession by [CONTACT_515367]. Changes from baseline to week [ADDRESS_667832] . 
  
Safety Analyses: 
Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized by [CONTACT_436441] (MedDRA) system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT) by [CONTACT_1570]. 
 
Non-treatment emergent events will be recorded in the data listings. For all AE 
tables, the number and percentage of subjects reporting AEs will be grouped

1-10  
Protocol v6.0 (20Apr2021)    CONFIDENTAL        by [CONTACT_3592]. Multiple occurrences of the same AE (at the  PT level) in the 
same subject will be counted only once in the frequency tables. If a subject 
experiences multiple epi[INVESTIGATOR_515338]/severity, the event with the strongest relationship or maximum 
severity to study treatment will be used to summarize AEs by [CONTACT_515368]. 
 
Descriptive statistics for ECG, ECHO, vital signs, and safety laboratory parameters will be generated. Summary statistics for each parameter at specific 
time points, as well as the change from Baseline to that time point, will also be 
displayed. All safety data will be presented in the data listings . 
Post-treatment Follow -
up/Clinical Tr ansition 
Period  Subjects will be followed up with by [CONTACT_515369] 4 weeks 
(28 days) following last infusion to check for adverse events or other 
significant findings. 
 
At the conclusion of the 48 week study period, subjects will be enrolled in  the Sarepta Clinical Tr ansition  Program and will be followed 
clinically in the NCH DMD clinic for safety, specifically for monitoring of renal function as per the prescribing informatio n for casimersen and 
golodirsen.  All prescribing recommended testing will be performed for 
clinically monitoring only.  Those subjects receiving golodirsen or casimersen via this program will be monitored by [CONTACT_515370], and serum cystatin C and urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) every 3 months  There is no additional clinical safety testing recommended per the prescribing information for eteplirsen.- Additionally, through this program the subjects will be provided uninterrupted weekly drug access after conclusion of the 48 week study period. Subjects will remain on the Clinical Tr ansition 
Program /SareptAssist  until study samples can be analyzed and 
insurance authorization for the drug(s) can be obtained, or the efficacy of the drug is determined to not meet the standards for continuation. The threshold for study drug continuation in Sarepta’s Clinical Transition  
Program /SareptAssist  is a 10 percent increase in dystrophin positive 
fibers (defined as fibers with 30 percent of the ci rcumference positive 
for dystrophin) as determined by [CONTACT_515371] 48- week post -treatment muscle biopsies .  Subjects will 
receive weekly drug infusions via home health care arranged by [CONTACT_515372] .

 4 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Background of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  
 
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a  degenera tive neur omus cular disease with an  X linked r ecessive  
inheritance  caused by [CONTACT_515374] , with a worldwide in cidence  of approxima tely [ADDRESS_667838] a re wheelchair depe ndent. Weakness of the arms and increasingly limited 
upper limb function, contractures, decubitus ulcers, and scoliosis (which often requires surgery), occur 
frequently. While pulmonary and cardiac functions are generally normal during early childhood, cardiac 
and diaphragmatic muscles progressively weaken during late childhood and adolescence leading to eventual dependence on ventilation support. Historically, subjects typi[INVESTIGATOR_515340] 20s
7, 8. Recent research suggests that use of ventilation support 
and steroids may increase life span by [CONTACT_72623]; however, DMD still has a mortality rate of 100%9. 
Corticosteroids used for palliative treatmemt of DMD  can prolong ambulation and reduce the incidence 
of severe scoliosis; however, they are often associated with serious side effects10, 11 and are not always 
employed.

Protocol v6.0 (20Apr2021)    CONFIDENTAL        
  
Phosphorodia midate mo rpholino olig omers (PM Os) are a class of  synthe tic molecules b ased on a 
redesign of the na tural nucleic acid stru cture. PMOs differ from 2′ -O-methyl and othe r oligonuc leotide 
therape utic platforms be cause of their si x-memb ered morpholino ring, which repla ces the five-
memb ered ribofuranosy l. Mor eover, PMOs also have each morpholino ring bound to each other through 
an unchar ged phosphorodia midate moie ty, as oppose d oth er RNA therape utics and backbones which 
have a n egatively-charge d phosphorothioate.  
 
Several PMOs are being evaluated by [CONTACT_515375], Inc., (Sarepta) for the treatment of DMD. 
The investigational drug products, casimersen (previously SRP-4045), eteplirsen (previously AVI-4658), 
and golodirsen (previously SRP-4053), are charge-neutral PMOs that selectively bind to exon 45, 51, or 
53, respectively, of dystrophin pre-mRNA and cause the exon to be skipped during processing. This 
restores the open reading frame in DMD subjects with mutations amenable to skippi[INVESTIGATOR_515341] 45, exon 51 or exon 53 of the dystrophin pre-mRNA, each of which represents approximately 8% , 13% and 8%  of all 
DMD subjects, respectively
12. This mechanism is expected to enable the production of an internally 
deleted, yet partially functional, dystrophin protein, similar to that observed in Becker muscular dystrophy 
(BMD), a much less severe form of dystrophinopathy. In contrast to DMD, most BMD subjects remain 
ambulatory and have a near-normal life expectancy13, 14. Treatment with casimersen. eteplirsen, or 
golodirsen is expected to result in sustained production of partially functional dystrophin protein and 
potentially improve the quality of life and pr ognosis for DMD subjects, essentially switching their clinical 
symptoms and prognosis to be more similar to those of subjects with BMD. Over time, treatment with casimersen, eteplirsen or golodirsen is expected to delay or potentially halt disease progress ion in boys 
with DMD who have gene mutations amenable to exon 45, exon 51 or exon 53 skippi[INVESTIGATOR_007], respectively. 
Nonclinical data for casimersen, eteplirsen, and golodirsen are described in the respective Investigator’s 
Brochures.  
4.[ADDRESS_667839] provided initial support and proof-of- concept for the 
safety and potential efficacy of eteplirsen in the treatment of DMD. In light of the posit ive findings from 
the 2 Phase 1 studies15, 16, a 28-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study (Study 4658-us-
201)17 was initiated to assess efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of eteplirsen. 
Twelve patients aged 7 to 13 years were randomized to receive once- weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 
eteplirsen (30 or 50 mg/kg) for 28 weeks, or once-weekly placebo infusions for 24 weeks followed by 
[CONTACT_515376] (30 or 50 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. At Week 28, these same 12 patients were enrolled in the 
extension study (Study 4658-us-202)[ADDRESS_667840] been 
conducted in patients with DMD:  
• Study 4658-203

 Based on the cumulative available safety data from these studies, eteplirsen has been shown to be well 
tolerated, with low rates of treatment- related serious or severe adverse events (AEs).   
Analysis of biopsies taken at combined Study 201/202 Week 180 showed a significant increase in

This is a open label, 48 -week stu dy to eva luate  the ef ficacy and safety of three PMOs – casimersen, 
eteplirsen, and golodirsen – in [ADDRESS_667847] out-of- frame duplications of a single exon that may be corrected by [CONTACT_281115][INVESTIGATOR_515341] 
45, 51, or 53 will receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30 mg/kg casimersen, 30 mg/kg

Protocol v6.0 (20Apr2021)    CONFIDENTAL        
 Upon qualification for the study based on Screening and Baseline ass essments, all subjects will undergo a 
muscle biopsy for baseline assessment of dystrophin expression. All subjects will undergo a second 
biopsy at 48 weeks of treatment.   
 
Efficacy will be assessed at regularly scheduled (12 week intervals) study visits and safety will be 
monitored on an ongoing basis for all subjects.  
Safety will be assessed through the collection of adverse events (AEs), laboratory tests, 
electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), vital signs, and physical examinations 
throughout the study as described in the Schedule of Events ( Table 6). A Safety Follow Up phone call 
will be placed approximately 4 weeks (28 days) after the last study infusion to check for new adverse 
events,  to obtain any new information regarding ongoing AEs and/or any other noteworthy subject 
progress.  
 
At the conclusion of the [ADDRESS_667848] patient support program .  Subjects will be followed  clinically in the NCH 
DMD clinic  for safety, specifically  for monitoring of renal function as per the prescribing information for 
casimersen and golodrisen. All prescribing re commended testing will be performed for clinical 
monitoring only. Those subjects receiving golodirsen or casimersen  via this program will be  monitored by 
[CONTACT_515370], and serum cystatin C and urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) every three 
months.  
  There is no additional clinical safety testing r ecommended  per the  prescribing information 
for eteplirsen.  
 
Additionally, through this program the subjects will be provided uninterrupted weekly drug access after 
conclusion of the 48 week study period. Subjects will remain on the Clinical 
TransitionProgram /SareptAssist  until study samples can be analyzed and insurance authorization for the 
drug(s) can be obtained, or the efficacy of the drug is determined to not meet the standards for continuation. The threshold for study drug continuation in Sarepta’s Clinical 
Transiti onProgram /SareptAssist  is a 10 percent increase in dystrophin positive fibers (defined as fibers 
with 30 percent of the circumference positive for dystrophin) as determined by [CONTACT_515384] 48-week post- treatment muscle bi opsies.
  
Subjects will receive weekly drug infusions via home health care arranged by [CONTACT_515385] . 
6.2 Dose S election Rationale 
 
A dose of 30 mg/kg casimersen, eteplirsen,  or golodirsen was se lected to use  in this  study . Doses we re 
chosen based on re sults f rom animal and phase 1 clinical studies with casimersen and golodirsen and on 
additional c linical data  from eteplirs en. The re are three ongoing c linical studies with g olodirsen and 
casimersen in DMD patients ( Study 4053-101, Study 4045-101 and Study 4045- 301)24-26.  
 
As described in S ection 4.3,  clinical studie s 4658-us- [ZIP_CODE] and 4658-us-[ZIP_CODE] with ete plirsen assessed 
the efficacy, safety , and tol erability of e teplirs en (50 mg/kg a nd 30 mg/kg ) administered as I V infusions 
in tw elve 7- to 13-yea r old pediatric  subjects di agnosed with DM D with out of frame mut ations 
amenable to tr eatment by [CONTACT_281115][INVESTIGATOR_515341] 51. 
 At W eek 48, 
 the inc reases in the  percent of dystrophin-positive fiber s were si milar  for subjects who had 
received w eekly 30 m g/kg and 50 mg/kg e teplirs en w ithout inte rruption f rom W eek 1 (52% a nd 42%  of 
norma l respectively, or 47% f or the c ombined groups). These da ta sugge st that the effec t of e teplir sen 
on the pro duction of nove l dystrophin is not sig nifica ntly different be tween the two dose s tested in this

 study. Thus, the lowe r dose  of eteplirs en (30 m g/kg) was selected fo r further clinical stu dy, a s it is a  
more conserva tive choice give n that  subjects would re ceive e teplir sen a s a lif e-long treatment. 
 
Like e teplirs en, the PM Os casimersen and golodirsen have been evaluated i n non-c linical studies to 
assess their pharmacologica l activity , pharmacokinetic, saf ety, a nd tox icolog y/toxicokine tic proprieties . 
RT-PCR studie s using  cultured muscle cells and demonstra ted strong e xon 45 (casimersen)  and exon 
53 (golodirsen) skippi[INVESTIGATOR_160981]. Both casimersen and golodirsen have shown low pr otein binding  
activity and low potential for d rug-drug inter actions, sinc e they did not int eract with cy tochrome  P450 
isoenzymes a t biolo gically relevant co ncentrations in vitro . 
 
The non-c linical safet y prof iles of casimersen and golodirsen a re similar to other  PMOs test ed to date;  
no ca rdiov ascular, re spi[INVESTIGATOR_515344], ge notoxicity, male  reproduc tive 
toxicity, or imm unotoxicity ha ve been det ected. The kidneys were the m ain targe t organ in mice  and 
monkey s after 12 weeks of rep eat dosi ng (w eekly IV injections of casimersen a nd golodirsen) whi ch is 
consistent with the r enal excretion be ing the major e limin ation p athway for PM Os. No a dverse effect 
were observed in mice using 960 m g/kg a nd 120 m g/kg of casimersen and golodirsen, a nd the m axim um 
feasible  dose for I V administr ation in monkeys was of 320 mg/kg fo r both PMOs. Beca use the pot ential 
target organ of to xicity (the kidney) ca n be monitor ed in the c linic, doses of 30 mg/kg casimersen  or 
golodirsen a re considered sa fe for  once we ekly I V infusions  in DMD  subjects with mutations a menable 
to exon 45 or exon 53 skipp ing. Additiona l non -clinical data  for casimersen and golodirsen a re described 
in
 the respective Inve stigator’s Broc hures.  
Further, 30 mg/kg/wk golodirsen treatment in clinical trial 4053 -101 resu l ted in a significant mean 
increase in dystrophin protein from baseline (N=25, p<0.001) at Week 48.  
Due to the expected  simila rities  among investiga tional PMOs for  the treatment of subjects with DMD , a 
30 mg/kg dose for eteplirsen,  casimersen and golodirsen wa s selected  for evaluation in this stu dy.

abnorm alities r elated to that diagnosis. Severa l symptoms or l aboratory results that are related to the  
same dia gnosis can thus be pa rt of the same A E.  
A medical or su rgica l procedure is not an A E; rather the c ondition l eading to the  procedure should be  
recorded as the AE.  Simila rly, death is n ot an AE, but is ra ther the outcome of the  AE( s) that resulted in 
death. If the AE(s ) leading to death are not known, then dea th must be re ported as an AE . All AEs will

Directive 2001/20/EC and/or  in the US Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). 
 
15.1.2 Institutional and Ethics Review   This study will be conducted in full compliance with the IRB regulations in 21 CFR 56 and/or the 
European C linical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC. Before enrollment of subjects into the study, the 
protocol and informed assent (for subjects, if applicable) and informed consent (for parents/legal guardians) documents will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_209118] I RB and regulatory authority. 
Amendments to the protocol will be subjected to the same IRB and regulatory authority review requirements as the original protocol. The Investigator will promptly notify the IRB and DSMB of any 
SAEs or of any other information that might affect the safe use of the IP during the study. IRB 
approvals and regulatory authorities’ approvals must be sent to the DSMB , or its designee, before 
initiation of the study or before an amendment is instituted. All correspondence with the IRB a nd the 
regulatory authority must be retained in the study regulatory files. 
 
15.1.3 Informed Consent/Assent and Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Protected Health 
Information   
Written informed consent from each subject’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and written assent from 
each subject, if applicable, must be obtained before any study- specific screening or Baseline period 
evaluations are performed. One copy of the signed informed consent/assent documents will be given 
to the subject; the Investigator will retain the original copi[INVESTIGATOR_91678].  
 
The informed consent/assent documents, as prepared by [CONTACT_284952], must be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_243476], as applicable, before initiation of the 
study. The informed consent document must contain the basic required elements of consent and 
additional elements, as applicable, as specified in the [ADDRESS_667908] the DSMB  as soon as possible regarding 
such a deviation. These departures do not require preapproval by [CONTACT_1201]; however, the IRB and DSMB  
must be notified in writing as soon as possible in accordance with the IRB policies after the departure has 
been made.

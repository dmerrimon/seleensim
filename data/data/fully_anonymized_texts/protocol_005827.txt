Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 1 Introduction 
1.1 RAD001 (everolimus) 
RAD001 (everolimus) is a novel oral derivative of rapamycin.  
RAD001 has been in clinical development since 1996 as an immunosuppressant in solid organ 
transplantation and has obtained marketing authorization (Certican®) for prophylaxis of 
rejection in renal and cardiac transplantation in a number of countries, including the majority of the European Union. RAD001 has been in development for patients with various malignancies since 2002. RAD001 is being investigated as an anticancer agent based on its potential to act: 
i. Directly on the tumor cells by [CONTACT_309957]. Indirectly by [CONTACT_129552] (via 
potent inhibition of tumor cell HIF-1 activity, VEGF production and VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells). The role of angiogenesis in the maintenance of solid tumor growth is well established, and the mTOR pathway has been implicated in the regulation of tumor production 
of proangiogenic factors as well as modulation of VEGFR signaling in 
endothelial cells. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_380246] and mechanism of action 
At cellular and molecular level RAD001 acts as a signal transduction inhibitor. RAD001 
selectively inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), a key and a highly conservative serine-threonine kinase, which is present in all cells and is a central regulator of protein synthesis and ultimately cell growth, cell proliferation, angiogenesis and cell survival. mTOR is the only currently known target of RAD001
1. 
mTOR is downstream of PI3K/AKT pathway, a pathway known to be dysregulated in a wide spectrum of human cancers (e.g. through loss/mutation of the PTEN negative regulator; through PI3K mutation/amplification; through AKT/PKB overexpression/overactivation; through modulation of TSC1/TSC2 tumor suppressors). In addition, activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is frequently a characteristic of worsening prognosis through increased aggressiveness, resistance to treatment and progression.  
The main known functions of mTOR include the following 
1, 2: 
mTOR functions as a sensor of mitogens, growth factors and energy and nutrient levels, 
facilitating cell-cycle progression from G1 to S phase in appropriate growth conditions. 
The PI3K-mTOR pathway itself is frequently activated in many human cancers, and 
oncogenic transformation may sensitize tumor cells to mTOR inhibitors.  
Through inactivating eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding proteins (4E-BP1) and activating 
the 40S ribosomal S6 kinases (i.e., p70S6K1), mTOR regulates translation of important

Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/[ADDRESS_380247] leads to the increased production of pro-angiogenic factors 
(i.e., VEGF) in tumors and to tumor, endothelial and smooth muscle cell growth and proliferation. 
The regulation of mTOR signaling is complex and involves positive regulators, such as AKT 
that phosphorylate and inactivate negative regulators such as the Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC1/TSC2). 
mTOR is represented by [CONTACT_309958], mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1, rapamycin sensitive) and mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2, rapamycin insensitive) 
3.  
mTORC1 is mainly activated via the PI3 kinase pathway through AKT (also known as PKB, protein kinase B) and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/TSC2) 
2. Activated AKT 
phosphorylates TSC2, which lead to the dissociation of TSC1/TSC2 complex, thus inhibiting the ability of TSC2 to act as a GTPase activating protein. This allows Rheb, a small G-protein, to remain in a GTP bound state and to activate mTORC1. AKT can also activate mTORC1 by [CONTACT_129554]40 phosphorylation, thereby [CONTACT_214791]40-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 
4, 5.  
mTORC2 (mTOR complex 2) is activated through a currently unknown mechanism, possibly by [CONTACT_129556] (RTK) signaling
4. It has been suggested that mTORC2 
phosphorylates and activates a different pool of AKT, that is not upstream of mTORC1. PHLPP phospatase plays a role of a negative regulator. mTORC2 is rapamycin insensitive and is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton 
3. 
mTORC1-mediated signaling is subject to modulation by [CONTACT_309959], such as RAD001. Once these agents bind to the 12 kDa cytosolic FK506-
binding protein immunophilin FKBP12, the resulting rapamycin-FKBP12 complexes bind to a 
specific site near the catalytic domain of mTORC1 and inhibit phosphorylation of mTOR substrates. As a consequence, downstream signaling events involved in regulation of the G1 to S-phase transition are inhibited. This mechanism is thought to be responsible for the immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin as well as its putative antineoplastic activity 
6. As 
many cancers are characterized by [CONTACT_113912] G1 transit (for example, overexpression of cyclin or cyclin-dependent kinases), inhibition of mTOR becomes an intriguing target for inducing cytostasis 
2.  
1.1.[ADDRESS_380248] demonstrated that RAD001 is a potent inhibitor of the 
proliferation of a range of human tumor cell lines in-vitro  with IC50s ranging from sub/low 
nM to μM concentrations, concentrations capable of being reached in patients at the doses used in clinical trials.  RAD001 was shown to have activity in many human tumor cell lines originating from lung, breast, prostate, colon, kidney, melanoma and glioblastoma and neuroendocrine tumor cells. Recent data suggests anti-tumor activity also in thyroid cancer
7. This study suggests that the

Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibition ma y be due to the inhibition PI3 kinase activation 
and the down-regulation of cyclin D1 and D3.  
RAD001 has shown activity in human pancreatic neuroendocrine cells, where induction of 
apoptosis was reported 8. Other tumor types in which activity was observed include acute 
myeloid leukemia cells 9, adult T-cell leukemia cells 10, diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells 
(DLBCL; 11, pancreatic tumor cells 12, ovarian cancer cells 13 and hepatocellular carcinoma 
cells 14.  
In a clonogenic assay using cells derived from 81 patient-derived tumor xenografts never cultured in vitro  (11 human tumor types with 3 to 24 tumors each: bladder, colon, gastric, 
NSCLC [adeno, squamous epi[INVESTIGATOR_309927]], SCLC, breast, ovary, pancreatic, renal, melanoma, and pleuramesothelioma), RAD001 inhibited colony formation in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, normal hematopoetic stem cells were insensitive to RAD001, with an IC50 about 15 fold higher than the tumor lines.  
RAD001 also inhibits the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECS), 
with particular potency against VEGF-induced proliferation. This is particularly important in the context of thyroid cancer since thyroid cancer appear to rely to a high degree on angiogenesis and high expression of VEGF has been linked to aggressive tumor growth and poor prognosis
15. Furthermore, tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Sorafenib, AMG706 and 
axitinib which predominantly block VEGF-receptor activation have been successfully used in this disease
16-18. The inhibition of endothelial proliferation and antiangiogenic activity of 
RAD001 was confirmed in vivo , as RAD001 selectively inhibited VEGF-dependent 
angiogenic response. Mice with primary and metastatic tumors treated with RAD001 showed a significant reduction in blood vessel density when compared to controls at well tolerated doses. Additionally, activity in a VEGF-impregnated s.c. implant model of angiogenesis and reduced vascularity (vessel density) of RAD001-treated tumors (murine melanoma) provided evidence of in vivo  effects of angiogenesis. 
RAD001 also inhibits tumor growth in-vivo  in xenografted, syngeneic and orthotopic animal 
models, residing longer in tumor tissue than in plasma and demonstrating high tumor penetration in a rat pancreatic tumor model. These effects occurred within the dose range of 2.5 to 10 mg/kg p.o. daily. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], the antitumor activity of RAD001 monotherapy was that of reduction of tumor growth rates rather than producing regressions or stable disease. 
RAD001, administered p.o., was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth and well tolerated in: 
x s.c. mouse xenograft model, established from a variety of tumor cell lines of diverse 
histotypes (NSCLC, pancreatic, colon, melanoma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_015]), including a Pgp170 
overexpressing multi-drug resistant tumor line  
x in a series of low-passage tumor xenografts established directly from human tumor 
material, maintained only in vivo  and considered highly predictive of therapeutic 
outcome in patients. These included breast (5 lines), colorectal (9 lines), gastric (3 
lines), lung (22 lines including adenocarcinomas, epi[INVESTIGATOR_309928], large cell and small cell histotypes), melanoma (6 lines), ovarian (4 lines), pancreatic (3 lines) and renal (6 lines)

Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 x in two syngeneic models (CA20948 rat pancreatic, B16/Bl6 mouse orthotopic 
melanoma) 
Taken together, these data indicate the broa d antiproliferative potential of RAD001 which 
includes thyroid cancer. 
It is not clear which molecular determinants predict responsiveness of tumor cells to RAD001. 
Molecular analysis has revealed that relative sensitivity to RAD001 in vitro correlates with the 
degree of phosphorylation (activation) of the AKT/PKB protein kinase and the S6 ribosomal protein. PTEN status alone may not be predictive of RAD001 relative in vitro sensitivity, 
however in some cases (i.e., GBM) there is also a correlation with PTEN status. 
In preclinical models, the administration of RAD001 is associated with reduction of protein 
phosphorylation in target proteins downstream of mTOR, notably phosphorylated S6 (pS6) and p4E-BP1, and occasionally with an increase in phosphorylation AKT (pAKT).  
Pre-clinical safety 
In safety pharmacology studies, RAD001 was devoid of relevant effects on vital functions 
including the cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_129521]. RAD001 had no influence on QT interval prolongation. Furthermore, RAD001 showed no antigenic potential. Although RAD001 passes the blood-brain barrier, there was no indication of relevant changes in the behavior of rodents, even after single oral doses up to 2000mg/kg or after repeated administration at up to 40 mg/kg/day. Based on these findings, the potential of RAD001 to affect vital functions in patients is considered to be low.
RAD001 is considered to have no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity potential. All significant 
adverse events observed in preclinical toxicology studies with RAD001 in mice, rats, monkeys and minipi[INVESTIGATOR_264293] a 2- or 4-week recovery period with the exception of the changes in male reproductive organs, most notably testes. Ocular effects (lenticular disorders) observed in rats were not observed in any other species and are considered to be a species-specific disorder.

1.1.3 Clinical experience 
[IP_ADDRESS] RAD001 Pharmacokinetics 
RAD001 is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_19627] a median t
max of 1-2 hours. The bioavailability of the drug is 
believed to be 11% or greater. The AUC 0-Ĳ is dose-proportional over the dose range between 5 
to 70 mg in the weekly regimen and 5 and 10 mg in the daily regimen. C max is dose-
proportional between 5 and 10 mg for both the weekly and daily regimens. At doses of 20 
mg/week and higher, the increase in C max is less than dose-proportional. The coefficient of 
variation between patients is approximately 50%.  
Trough levels ([ADDRESS_380249]-dose) correlate well with AUC 0-Ĳ at steady-state during daily 
administration. 
 Confidential Page 11 
Clinical study protocol  DFCI Study No 09-049.  
 
Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 In whole blood, at a daily dose of 10 mg, about 20% of RAD001 is confined in plasma with 26% being unbound. The remaining 80% is sequestered in blood cells.  
RAD001 is extensively metabolized in the liver and eliminated in the bile. Major metabolites 
are inactive. Elimination half-life is approximately 30 hours. The clearance of RAD001 is approximately halved in patients with mild-moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B), while renal impairment has little or no impact on the pharmacokinetics of RAD001. 
Age, weight and gender in the adult population do not affect the pharmacokinetics of RAD001 
to a clinically relevant extent. The clearance of RAD001 is reduced in children. 
Pharmacokinetic characteristics are not notably different between Caucasian and Japanese 
subjects, whereas in Black patients pharmacokinetic studies have shown an average 20% higher clearance. 
A high-fat meal altered the absorption of RAD001 with 1.3 hour delay in t
max, a 60% 
reduction in C max and a 16% reduction in AUC. 
RAD001 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and a substrate and a moderate inhibitor of the multi-drug 
efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gP, MDR1, ABCB1). Hence, its metabolism is sensitive to drugs which modify these enzymes (substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of these enzymes). Competitive inhibition could occur when RAD001 is combined with drugs which are also CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein substrates 
Table 3-3a (Section 3.3.3) lists examples of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibitors and 
inducers. 
Please refer to Section 3.3.3 for more information on the concomitant use of CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers and other medications. 
More information on RAD001 pharmacokinetics is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure.
[IP_ADDRESS] RAD001 Pharmacodynamic studies 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling based on inhibition of the biomarker p70S6 
kinase 1 [S6K1] in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]) suggests that 5-10 mg daily should be an adequate dose to produce a high-degree of sustained target inhibition. Furthermore, molecular pharmacodynamic (MPD) studies, using immunocytochemistry (IHC) in biopsied tumor tissue, assessed the degree of inhibition and its duration for pS6, p4E-BP1 and pAKT expression with the daily and weekly dosing. There was high inhibition of the downstream markers S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 5mg/day, which was complete at 10 mg/day, while preliminary results suggest increase in pAKT expression with maximal effect at 10 mg daily

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical experience with RAD001

Updated: 1/28/2014 the European Union under the trade name [CONTACT_309984]®. The most frequent adverse drug 
reactions in this context are highly specific to the transplant context. However, certain events are generalizable, most notably myelosuppression, skin disorders and increases in blood lipid levels. 
RAD001 has been in development for patients with cancer since 2002. Approximately [ADDRESS_380250] been treated in either [COMPANY_001] sponsored or non-[COMPANY_001] sponsored clinical studies as of 31 Aug 2007. Overall, [COMPANY_001] sponsored a total of 22 studies of RAD001 administered either as single-agent (n=848), or in combination with other anti-tumor agents (n=663). Ongoing or completed Investigator sponsored studies also enrolled over [ADDRESS_380251] or are being conducted in various advanced 
malignancies. Five Phase I studies evaluated several escalating doses with either weekly or daily administration (Studies C2101/02, C2106, C2107, C1101) of RAD001 with the  objective to identify an optimal regimen and dosage, based on safety, pharmacokinetics and knowledge of the drug’s molecular effects on various tumors. The 10 mg/day and 50-70 mg/week dosages were proposed for further studies, when using RAD001 as a single agent, and as a target maximum dose in combination studies. In addition the Phase I studies, conducted in prostate cancer (Study C2106) and in Japanese patients with advanced cancers (Study C1101), evaluated the safety and the molecular changes in tumor, associated with the administration of RAD001.  
Two Phase II monotherapy studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 
single dose of 10 mg administered daily including Study C2235 in advanced NSCLC (n=81) and Study C2239 in advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (n=160). 
A Phase III study (Study C2240) is ongoing and designed to demonstrate the safety and 
efficacy of RAD001 at an oral dose of [ADDRESS_380252] frequent mild-moderate Grade 1/[ADDRESS_380253] been rash, 
stomatitis, fatigue, neutropenia and to a lesser extent gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting), and headache. The primary DLT has been severe (Grade 3) stomatitis, and occasionally fatigue, hyperglycemia, and neutropenia. Reduced blood counts, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] (mainly hypercholesterolemia) and hyperglycemia are relatively frequent laboratory findings. Infections have not been notably frequent or severe. Non-infectious low-Grade (Grade 1/2) pneumonitis has led to de velopment of treatment guidelines for the 
disorder (Table 3-2a). Preliminary indications of anti-tumor activity are encouraging. 
For more information on known undesirable effects of RAD001 refer to Section 3.2.5.  Further detailed information regarding RAD001 clinical development, safety and efficacy is

Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 Rationale for this study:  
 
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer and affects approximately 7 per 100,000 
people in the western hemisphere. Over [ZIP_CODE] new thyroid cancer cases are diagnosed annually in the US alone and it appears that the incidence is rising 
20, 21. Approximately 90% 
of these are well differentiated cancers, 5% to 9% medullary tumors, and 1% anaplastic tumors. The well-differentiated tumors include papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], follicular and Hurthle cell types with the papi[INVESTIGATOR_309929]. The primary treatment modality for most patients with thyroid cancer is surgery followed by [CONTACT_158211]-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression and possibly Iodine 131. In cases in which the tumor has spread to distant sites and has become refractory to radioiodine or is not amenable to curative surgery, expected survival declines rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]. In this setting, no standard therapy exists. In the past, chemotherapy was and sometimes still is attempted but overall traditional chemotherapy is considered ineffective and too toxic. Among classical chemotherapy agents, doxorubicin has been studied most extensively, both as a single agent and in combination. Ahuja et al reviewed [ADDRESS_380254] 250 patients with thyroid cancer who were treated with single agent doxorubicin and showed a composite response rate of 38%
22. The response rate to doxorubicin monotherapy 
was further broken down to differentiated 38%, undifferentiated 22%, medullary 42% and Hurthle cell 33%. Based on this data, the doxorubicin received FDA approval in this disease. Because of the short progression-free survival of 2 months, a median survival of 8 months and the toxicity of this drug, it is rarely used
23. Doxorubicin has also been used as the backbone of 
combination therapy with many different agents including bleomycin, cisplatin, vincristine, melphalan and paclitaxel. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_309930], the median survival in these mostly small trials appeared not to be increased compared to doxorubicin alone and therefore none of these combinations are used routinely in this disease
24, 25.  
 Recently, progress has been made using small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that inhibit VEGF, raf, c-kit and RET such as Sorafenib, Axitinib or Motesanib (AMG706) 
17, 26, 27 . 
Sorafenib was used in 30 patients with differentiated, medullary and anaplastic disease with documented disease progression. A partial response (PR) by [CONTACT_309961] 23%, 53 % had stable disease. Progression free survival was [ADDRESS_380255] criteria was achieved in 30% and stable disease was found in 38% in an intent to treat analysis and 4% had disease progression. PFS was 18 months and thus remarkably similar to that seen in the Sorafenib trial. Among the nine patients in this trial who had received chemotherapy prior to treatment with Axitinib, a PR was achieved in five subjects. Motesanib (AMG706) was tested in [ADDRESS_380256] 6 months prior to study entry, 14% had an objective response and stable disease was 
achieved in 67%. PFS was 40 weeks. In some patients comorbidities such as uncontrolled hypertension and gastrointestinal side effects make the use of these drugs difficult and

However, data form the RADIANT-1 trial in neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the pancreas, are very similar to differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer on a molecular level were recently presented
28. 
In the trial, 115 patients with metastatic pancreatic NET and documented disease progression on chemotherapy were given either daily RAD001 combined with monthly Sandostatin LAR Depot or daily RAD001 alone. Progression-free survival was 9.3 and 12.9 months and the fifteen month survival was 52.6 and 90.3%. Treatment was generally well-tolerated and most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea (48%) stomatitis (47%) rash (44%) fatigue (42%) nausea (41%) pyrexia (32%) vomiting (30%) headache (27%) asthenia (27%) peripheral edema (28%) and abdominal pain (27%). 4% of subjects had a grade 4 adverse event possibly related to trial therapy. Grade 1/2 pneumonitis were reported in 4% of subjects and no Grade 3/[ADDRESS_380258] been found to
 be dysregulated in thyroid cancer, such 
as the cell cycle stimulators c-Myc and cyclin-D129 and the cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 (p27), 
suggesting a potential role for mTOR in thyroid cancer progression30. mTOR is under control 
by [CONTACT_309962], Akt, which is elevated in several types of cancer, including 
anaplastic, papi[INVESTIGATOR_1396], and follicular thyroid cancer31, and may contribute to the dysregulation 
of mTOR activity. Taken together, these data suggest that mTOR is an appropriate target for 
thyroid cancer therapy. 
 Based on the molecular mechanism outlined above and the response rates with mTOR inhibitors in other neuroendocrine cancer types, we propose to study RAD001 as first line therapy in patients who are diagnosed with radioiodine non-avid thyroid cancer or who have failed treatment with a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as sorafenib, axitinib or AMG706

Rationale 
To date, there is no established therapy option for patients with Radioactive Iodine (RAI) 
refractory thyroid cancer who have progressed on oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors or who are not candidates for treatment with these drugs. This study seeks to obtain first information about the effectiveness of RAD001 in thyroid cancer that has shown evidence for disease 
progression as first or second line therapy.  If promising activity is detected, this will be the 
basis for larger subsequent studies.

and re-initiation of RAD001 treatment 
Toxicity Actions 
Non-hematological toxicity  
Grade 2  (except pneumonitis – refer to Table 3-2a) If the toxicity is tolerable to the patient, maintain the same dose. If the toxicity is intolerable to patient, 
interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade 
d1. Then 
reintroduce RAD001 at same dose. 
If event returns to grade 2, then interrupt RAD001 
until recovery to grade d1. Then reintroduce RAD001 
at the lower dose level. 
Grade 3 
(except hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]*) 
(except pneumonitis – refer to Table 3-2a) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade d1. Then 
reintroduce RAD001 at the lower dose level. For 
pneumonitis consider the use of a short course of 
corticosteroids. 
Grade 4 (except hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]*) 
 Discontinue RAD001. 
Hematological toxicity  
Grade 2 Thrombocytopenia (platelets <75,  50x10
9/L)  Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade d1 (>75 
x109/L). Then reintroduce RAD001 at initial dose. 
If thrombocytopenia again returns to grade 2, 
interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade d1. Then 
reintroduce RAD001 at the lower dose level.  
Grade 3 Thrombocytopenia (platelets <50,  25 x109/L) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade 1 
(platelets  75 x109/L).  Then resume RAD001 at one 
dose level lower.  If grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
recurs, discontinue RAD001. 
Grade 4 Thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25 x109/L)  Discontinue RAD001. 
Grade 3 Neutropenia (neutrophils <1, 0.5 x109/L) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade d1 ( 
neutrophils  1.5 x 109/L). Then resume RAD001 at 
the initial dose.  If ANC again returns to Grade 3, hold RAD001 until the ANC  1.5 x 10
9/L.  Then 
resume RAD001 dosing at the lower dose level.  Discontinue patient from study therapy for a third epi[INVESTIGATOR_254335] 3 neutropenia. 
Grade 4 Neutropenia (neutrophils < 0.5 x10
9/L) Interrupt RAD001 until recovery to grade d 1  
(neutrophils   1.5 x 109/L). Then resume RAD001 at 
the lower dose level. If grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_264265],

fatigue, headache, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. Infections have not been notably frequent or severe. Non-infectious pneumonitis has also been observed. The majority of these AEs have been of mild to moderate severity (CTC grade 1-2). Overall, the most frequently observed laboratory abnormalities include reduced blood counts, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_309932]/or hypertriglyceridemia.  
3.2.5a The principal DLT in Phase 1 trials has been Grade 3 stomatitis. For guidance on 
management of stomatitis refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] 
3.2.5b Hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_309933] a serious adverse reaction. It is a recognized side-
effect of rapamycins. Use of lipid-lowering drugs should be associated with dietary recommendations. Monitoring of blood lipid levels requires patients to be fasting so that this aspect must be verified when interpreting results. For guidance on management of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_309934] [IP_ADDRESS]. 
3.2.5c Hyperglycemia was reported as a serious adverse reaction. Similarly, the fasting state 
of patients should be verified when interpreting results. For guidance on management of hyperglycemia refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
3.2.5d Pneumonitis is a recognized adverse effect of rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus, and 
everolimus). Numerous case reports in the literature suggest that rapamycin-associated pneumonitis is relatively unaggressive, limited in extent, and reversible upon drug discontinuation. The term ‘pneumonitis’ is used here to describe non-infectious, non-malignant infiltration in the lungs which is evident radiologically. More precise diagnosis should follow histocytological examination following lung biopsy, generally during bronchoscopy which may or may not be symptomatic. Advice on the management of pneumonitis has been provided in Table 3-2a.  
In oncology studies with RAD001, severe pneumonitis suspected as drug-related has been 
reported as a serious adverse event on 13 occasions and additionally in the following associated preferred terms including acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (n=2), alveolitis (n=1) and allergic alveolitis (n=1), interstitial lung disease (n=10), lung infiltration (n=23), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, lung consolidation, pulmonary alvealoar haemorrhage, pulmonary toxicity and pulmonary fibrosis (n=1, each). One fatal case of drug-related

Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/[ADDRESS_380275] treated with 10 mg/day, which developed approximately two months after starting RAD001. Cytology for both the pleural and pericardial fluids were positive for malignancy.  The death was considered possibly related to the underlying late stage tumor and study drug. Additionally, one patient treated with 10 mg/day died due to severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_309935]. Thoracic CT scan demonstrated condensation in the majority of the left lower lobe and frosted glass appearance in the left upper lobe, lingula, and right lung. 
Along with the cases of non-infectious pneumonitis, serious opportunistic infections have also 
been reported in cancer patients treated with RAD001: mycobactrium, aspergillus, and fatal candidal sepsis, and fatal pneumocystis carnii in particular. Because RAD001, as other rapamycins, inhibits proliferation of activated lymphocytes and reduces neutrophil counts, treatment with RAD001 must be considered as predisposing patients to the risk of infection. This risk will be higher in patients severely immunocompromised because of their underlying disease and/or co-medications. Outcome may be fatal in case of serious infections.   3.2.5e Pericardial effusions, pleural effusions, and weight loss have been reported as serious adverse events with suspected causality. Due to the imprecision of causality assessments it should not be assumed that all of these events are indeed the result of therapy with everolimus since confounding factors are present relating mainly to complications of the underlying disease and to the use of concomitant medications.  
3.2.5f A reduction in blood cell counts is frequent when RAD001 therapy is initiated. Without 
clinical significance and infrequently, anemia and thrombocytopenia have been reported. In heavily pretreated patients with aggressive lymphoma, the incidence of grade 3 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was reported to be 11%, 16%, and 30%, respectively. Serious, suspected drug-related hemorrhages have been exceptional. Nevertheless, RAD001 should be considered as predisposing patients to hemorrhage, potentially fatal, should they develop severe drug-related thrombocytopenia. 
3.2.5g Discrete, reversible changes in liver enzymes have been found to occur in numerous 
patients during treatment with RAD001 in oncology clinical studies, and in a study in rheumatoid arthritis. In oncology studies, these changes may be evident only in patients without severe underlying morbidity. The increase in transaminase’s (AST and ALT) generally appears after 4 weeks of treatment. In all but a few cases it does not exceed Grade 1 ( 2.[ADDRESS_380276]). Similarly, mild increases in alkaline phosphatases can coexist. Spontaneous 
corrections or intermittent correction with continued treatment can occur. Serum bilirubin is not increased.  In studies of patients with advanced cancers, clinically relevant changes in liver enzymes have been invariably associated with the presence of liver metastases and/or progression of the underlying cancer.  
3.2.5h Renal failure has been reported in five suspected cases to date. One patient with no 
alternative explanation made a complete recovery following study drug adjustment and no treatment/therapy for the event. The rest or the patients had concurrent morbidities, which might have contributed to the reported events.

Updated: 1/28/[ADDRESS_380277] been reported as serious adverse reactions. Electrolytes should be monitored in patients treated with RAD001. 
Table 3-1 provides general recommendations for the management of patients, with suspected 
drug toxicities while on treatment with RAD001 as single-agent therapy. 
More detailed information regarding RAD001 reported suspected toxicities and individual 
cases is provided in the [Investigator’s Brochure].  3.2.5j Reactivation of Hepatitis B (HBV) has been observed in sporadic cases with patients in this setting with everolimus. Use of antivirals during anti-cancer therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of Hepatitis B virus reactivation and associated morbidity and mortality. A detailed assessment of Hepatitis B/C medical history and risk factors must be done for all patients at screening, with testing performed prior to the first dose of everolimus.  
Patients who test positive for a past or active Hepatitis B infection
 should be given 
prophylactic administration. If the patient has a positive Hepatitis B test result, they should be 
treated with Hepatitis B anti-viral lamivudine [ADDRESS_380278] of the treatment will be charged to the patient’s insurance. For guidance on management of Hepatitis B and C reactivation, refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
3.2.6 Management of Side Effects of RAD001     
[IP_ADDRESS]   Management of stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers 
Stomatitis/oral mucositis/mouth ulcers due to RAD001 should be treated using local 
supportive care.  
When described, the disorder has been identified as inflammation or ulcers in the mouth. If 
exam reveals mouth ulcers, rather than a more general inflammation of the mouth, please classify the adverse event as ‘mouth ulcers’. If inflammation is limited to the mouth without ulcers please use the term ‘stomatitis’ rather than the less specific term ‘mucositis’. 
If the disorder is elsewhere than the mouth please describe the location as well as any specific 
procedures carried out for exploration (e.g. endoscopy).   
Please use the Grading according to the NIH-NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events, Version 3.0 (CTCAEv3.0; http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf). 
Grade 1: minimal symptoms; normal diet Grade 2: symptomatic but can eat -and swallow modified diet Grade 3: symptomatic and unable to adequately aliment or hydrate orally Grade 4: symptoms associated with life-threatening consequences  
 Confidential Page 25 
Clinical study protocol  DFCI Study No 09-049.  
 
Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 Recommendations 
For mild toxicity (Grade 1), use conservative measures such as non-alcoholic mouth wash, 
decadron mouthrinse, or salt water (0.9%) mouth wash several times a day until 
resolution. For more severe toxicity (Grade 2 or 3), the suggested treatments are topi[INVESTIGATOR_032] (i.e., local anesthetics such as benzocaine, butyl aminobenzoate, tetracaine hydrochloride, menthol, or phenol) with or without topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930], such as triamcinolone oral paste 0.1% (e.g. Kenalog in Orabase
®). 
Agents containing hydrogen peroxide, iodine, and thyme derivatives may tend to worsen 
mouth ulcers. It is preferable to avoid these agents. 
Antifungal agents must be avoided unless a fungal infection is diagnosed. In particular, 
systemic imidazole antifungal agents (ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.) should be 
avoided in all patients due to their strong inhibition of RAD001 metabolism, therefore leading to higher RAD001 exposures. Therefore, topi[INVESTIGATOR_033]. Similarly, antiviral agents such as acyclovir should be avoided unless a viral infection is diagnosed. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Management of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_309936]-treatment status and dietary 
habits. Blood tests to monitor hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_309937]. Grade 2 or higher hypercholesterolemia (>300 mg/dL or 7.75 mmol/L) or grade 2 or higher hypertriglyceridemia (>2.5 x upper normal limit) should be treated with a statin or appropriate lipid-lowering medication, in addition to diet. Patients should be monitored clinically and through serum biochemistry for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse events as required in the product label/data sheets for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. 
Note: Concomitant therapy with fibrates and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor is associated 
with an increased risk of a rare but serious skeletal muscle toxicity manifested by [CONTACT_090], markedly elevated creatine kinase (CPK) levels and myoglobinuria, acute renal failure and sometimes death. The risk versus benefit of using this therapy should be determined for individual patients based on their risk of cardiovascular complications of hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]. 
Grade 3 hyperglycemia has been observed in patients receiving RAD001 therapy. In many 
cases in [Study RAD001C2222] the affected patients had an abnormal fasting glucose at baseline. Based on this finding, it is recommended that optimal glucose control is achieved before starting a patient on RAD001. Study patients should have their glucose levels monitored during RAD001 therapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Management of non-infectious pneumonitis 
Both asymptomatic radiological changes (grade 1) and symptomatic non-infectious 
pneumonitis (grade 2 = not interfering with activities of daily living or grade 3 = interfering with activities of daily living and oxygen indicated) have been noted in patients receiving RAD001 therapy. Non-infectious pneumonitis has been associated with RAD001 and other mTOR inhibitors (Atkins 2004). In order to monitor for asymptomatic (grade 1) pulmonary

Screening for Hepatitis C  
Patients with a positive Hepatitis C test or known to have a history of HCV infection 
including those with a negative viral load test at baseline are excluded from the study.   
All interruptions or changes to study drug administration must be recorded.  It will be documented whether or not each patient completed the clinical study. If for any 
patient either study treatment or observations were discontinued the reason will be recorded.  
Reasons that a patient may discontinue participation in a clinical study are considered to 
constitute one of the following: 
adverse event(s) 
abnormal laboratory value(s) 
abnormal test procedure result(s) disease progression 
protocol violation 
subject withdrew consent lost to follow-up 
administrative problems 
death 
3.3 Treatments 
3.3.1 RAD001 Administration 
The study drug RAD001 will be self-administered (by [CONTACT_36129]). The 
investigator will instruct the patient to take the study drug exactly as specified in the protocol. RAD001 will be administered orally as once daily dose of 10 mg (one 10mg tablet or two 5mg 
tablets)  continuously from study day 1 until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. 
Patients will be instructed to take RAD001 in the morning, at the same time each day.   
RAD001 should be taken by [CONTACT_89410] a fasting state or with no more than a light fat-free 
meal. Dietary habits around the time of RAD001 intake should be as consistent as possible

For patients unable to swallow tablets, everolimus tablet (s) should be dispersed completely in a glass of water (containing approximately 30mL) by [CONTACT_36915], immediately prior to drinking. The glass should be rinsed with the same volume of water and the rinse should be completely swallowed to ensure that the entire dose is administered.  
A dose of RAD001 is considered missed if the patient did not take RAD001 within [ADDRESS_380289] step of the trial, 18 patients with differentiated 
thyroid cancer will be enrolled and if responses are seen, the study will proceed to the full enrollment of 50 patients.  
3.3.3 Concomitant therapy 
Patients will be instructed not to take any additional medications (including over-the-counter 
products) during the course of the study without prior consultation with the investigator. At each visit, the investigator will ask the patient about any new medications he/she is or has taken after the start of the study drug. 
All Concomitant medications/Significant non-drug therapi[INVESTIGATOR_32546]  30 days prior to start and 
after start of study drug, including physical therapy and blood transfusions, should be 
recorded. 
The following restrictions apply during the entire duration of the study: 
x No other investigational therapy should be given to patients. 
x No anticancer agents other than the study medication should be given to patients. If such 
agents are required for a patient then the patient must first be withdrawn from the study. 
x Growth factors (e.g.G-CSF, GM-CSF, erythropoietin, platelets growth factors etc.) are not 
to be administered prophylactically but may be prescribed by [CONTACT_309965], if this is thought to be appropriate. 
Concurrent administration of RAD001 and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, 
itraconazole, ritonavir) and inducers (such as rifampin, rifabutin) should be avoided. 
 Confidential Page 31 
Clinical study protocol  DFCI Study No 09-049.  
 
Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 Provided there is no alternative treatment available, patients should be closely monitored for potential toxicities. 
Concurrent administration of RAD001 and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as 
erythromycin, fluconazole, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651]) and moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], phenobarbital, phenytoin) should also be avoided if possible, or used subject to caution (e.g. increased frequency of safety monitoring, 
temporary interruption of RAD001). 
Competitive inhibition could occur when RAD001 is combined with drugs which are also 
CYP3A4 substrates. Therefore caution should be exercised in such cases. 
Co-administration with substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein should be avoided, 
if possible, or used subject to caution (e.g. increased frequency of safety monitoring, 
temporary interruption of RAD001).  
Grapefruit,grapefruit juice and pomegranate juice affect cytochrome P450 and P-glycoprotein 
activity and should therefore be avoided.  
x In addition, patients should avoid Seville oranges and star fruit, as well as the juice of these fruits, which are potent CYP3A4-inhibitors.  
x No chronic treatment with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressive agents while 
taking RAD001. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_129534]. 
x In case of severe mucositis, systemic treatment with oral steroids for up to one week is allowed. RAD001 is held while on oral steroids.  
x RAD001 may affect the response to vaccinations making the response to the vaccination less effective. Live vaccines should be avoided while a patient is treated with RAD001. 
Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin are CYP2C9 substrates and, as such, no interaction with 
RAD001 is expected. However, drug-drug interaction studies between macrolide antibiotics and warfarin have produced mixed outcomes and the disparity in these findings has led to the conclusion that multiple factors may alter the clear ance of warfarin. The coadministration of 
RAD001 and oral anticoagulants is possible but should be subject to verification of coagulation (INR) once steady state is reached (after one week’s treatment). 
Examples are provided in Table 3-3a. A comprehensive list of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes 
and CYP3A4 inhibitors, inducers, and substrates can be found at http://medicine.iupui.edu/flockhart.  This website is continually revised and should be checked frequently for updates.

that there is no relevant PK interaction.

Institutions will register eligible participants with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance 
Office for Clinical Trials (QACT) central registration system. Registration must occur prior to the initiation of therapy. Any participant not registered to the protocol before treatment begins will be considered inelig ible and registration will be denied.  
 
A member of the study team will confirm eligibility criteria and complete the protocol-
specific eligibility checklist.  
Following registration, participants may begin protocol treatment. Issues that would 
cause treatment delays should be discussed with the Principal Investigator. If a participant does not receive protocol therapy following registration, the participant’s protocol status must be changed. Notify the QACT Registrar of par ticipant status changes as soon as possible.

except for adverse events that will be evaluated continuously through the study. Safety and tolerability will be assessed according to the NIH/NCI CTC http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.pdf. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by 
[CONTACT_424], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be collected and recorded and followed as appropriate. 
An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or 
medical condition occurring after starting the study drug even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. Medical conditions/diseases present before starting study drug are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting study drug. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant, or require therapy. 
The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by [CONTACT_105]-directive questioning of the patient 
at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_24479], laboratory test, or other assessments. As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 
 the severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) or (grade 1-4) 
 its relationship to the study drug(s) (suspected/not suspected) 
 its duration (start and end dates or if continuing at final exam) 
 action taken (no action taken; study drug dosage adjusted/temporarily interrupted; study drug permanently discontinued due to this adverse event; concomitant medication taken; non-drug therapy given; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]/prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) 
 whether it constitutes a serious adverse event (SAE) 
All adverse events should be treated appropriatel y. Such treatment may include changes in 
study drug treatment including possible interruption or discontinuation, starting or stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_058], changes in the frequency or nature of assessments, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or any other medically required intervention. Once an adverse event is detected, it should be followed until its resolution, and assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently,

Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014 if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. 
Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be 
found in the Investigators’ Brochure. This information should be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious adverse events 
Information about all serious adverse events will be collected and recorded. To ensure patient 
safety each serious adverse event must also be reported to [COMPANY_001] within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: 
 is fatal or life-threatening 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above

experiences will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by [CONTACT_093]. 
 
3.4.5 IRB Instructions for notification of serious adverse events 
 For DF/HCC Sites:  
The DFCI IRB SAE Reporting Form must be used to report SAEs experienced by [CONTACT_102927]/HCC participants enrolled in a DF/HCC study including any serious adverse events on DF/HCC led Multi-Center trials where the event occurs at a non-DF/HCC site. Full written SAE report must be submitted to OHRS as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working 
days from notification of event. For DF/HCC participant centers, reports must be submitted 
via OHRS Submit, and the lead site must be notified prior to submission to OHRS.    
The DFCI IRB requires the following events be reported: 
 Grade 2 (moderate) and Grade 3 (severe) Events – Only events that are 
Unexpected and Possibly, Probably or Definitely Related/Associated with the 
Intervention.

Version 12 
Updated: 1/28/2014  ALL Grade 4 (life threatening or disabling) Events  
 ALL Grade 5 (fatal) Events – When subject is enrolled and actively 
participating in the trial OR when event occurs within [ADDRESS_380311] study intervention. 
 Follow Up SAE Reports (DF/HCC participating centers only): When submitting follow up reports to previously reported SAEs, attach a copy of the original report and any prior IRB determinations to the follow up report . This gives the 
reviewer all the information required to conduct a thorough review and eliminates questions that might otherwise be raised.
For Non-DF/HCC Sites:  For institutions outside of DF/HCC, please report grade 2 or higher AEs considered 
unexpected and possibly, probably, or definitely re lated/associate d with the in tervention to 
DFCI Study Team ([CONTACT_309985]: Principal Investig ator) for reporting to the DFCI IRB. All 
outside institutions are also required to report events to their IRB per individual 
institutional guidelines.

5 Correlative Studies 
For correlative studies, patients will be asked for the permission to obtain and store either a 
tumor tissue block from a previous biopsy and/or undergo sequential biopsies.  
 If tumor tissue blocks are unavailable, then up to forty unstained slides should be obtained. 
These will be kept in the clinical research lab in a secure location.  
They will be used for immune histochemistry (IHC) studies and possible analysis of genetic 
mutations in the future. IHC staining for the expression of AKT, PTEN, PI3K and others will be performed when funding becomes available. Analysis of mutations such as B-raf may also be performed depending on funding in the future. Patients may decide against participating but will be encouraged to give permission for using their tumor tissue.   
Patients with easily accessible tumors such as skin metastases, will be asked to undergo 
sequential biopsies before and during treatment with RAD001. This will be performed in collaboration with [CONTACT_309986] from the Department of Surgery at BWH at his outpatient office. Obtaining biopsies will be optional for patients and will only be pursued if they can be obtained with a minimal risk to the patient. Biopsies will be evaluated in the lab of [CONTACT_309987] for the presence of markers of autophagy. It will also be analyzed for tyrosine kinase phosphorylation status in collaboration with [CONTACT_309988] at the Broad Institute, Harvard University.  
For Non-DF/HCC Sites:  
 Institutions outside of DF/HCC will also be participating in the correlative studies. They 
will send their participants’ arch ival tissue with the submissi on form to [CONTACT_309989] 
and his study team. Before any tissue is sent, the external sites need to contact [CONTACT_309969]. For specimen preparation, submission and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_15381], please see Appendix E.

6.1.1 Data Safety 
 
The DF/HCC Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review and monitor 
toxicity and accrual data from this trial. The committee is composed of clinical specialists with experience in oncology and who have no direct relationship with the study. Information that raises any questions about participant safety will be addressed with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_36749]. 
 
The DSMC will meet quarterly and/or more often  if required to review toxicity and 
accrual data.  Information to be provided to the committee may include:  up-to-date participant accrual; current dose level information; DLT information; all grade [ADDRESS_380315] been reported; summary of all deaths occurring within 30 days for Phase I or II protocols; for gene transfer protocols, summary of all deaths while being treated and during active follow-up; any response information; audit results, and a summary provided by [CONTACT_3476]. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request.

thyroid cancer (excluding medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancer) and documented disease 
progression within  [ADDRESS_380317] 2 subjects meet the criteria, the study will proceed to its full accrual of patients with differentiated thyroid cancer of 33 patients.
 Patients who drop out 
before the 6 month binary evaluation will be counted as failures. We will declare the trial a

Updated: 1/28/[ADDRESS_380318] alpha = 0.092 and power =0.970, assuming a [ADDRESS_380319] from differentiated thyroid cancer with a high rate of distant metastasis and a poor prognosis. Ten patients with medullary thyroid cancer and seven patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer will be treated on this protocol and descriptive statistics will be used for analysis of these patient groups. If no signal is detected, no conclusions can be drawn. However, if there are a few responses (i.e. one or more), a case for a larger, multi-institutional effort to analyze this fully could be made.   
 Since we expect accrual of a relatively large number of medullary thyroid cancer cases based on the patient population that we see at DFCI, we wanted to make sure that the main group for which this trial is designed - papi[INVESTIGATOR_309941]- are sufficiently represented in the group of [ADDRESS_380320] HA.

RECIST: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors  Eligibility: To be eligible, subjects must have at least one uni-dimensionally measurable 
lesion.

 Lesions identified on physical exam and clinically measured by [CONTACT_309971]-target lesions. Lesion in a radiation therapy port will not be considered target lesions. 
 Non-measurable lesions Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions including small lesions9 longest diameter less 
that 20mm with conventional techniques or equal or more that 10-16mm with spi[INVESTIGATOR_25457]. Other examples of non-measurable lesions include bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218]. Additionally, the following will be considered non-measurable for this study: Non-measurable skin lesions, peritoneal carcinomatosis, military lesions, irradiated lesions and groups of lesions that are small and numerous.  
 Method All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. 
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than [ADDRESS_380333] whole body bone scans will be utilized to follow the non-measurable bony lesions for progression.

Updated: 1/28/[ADDRESS_380334] is required for lesion measurement.  
When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response evaluation, ultrasound should 
not be used to measure tumor lesions that are not clinically easily accessible. It may be used as a possible alternative to clinical measurements for superficial palpable lymph nodes, subcutaneous lesions and thyroid nodules. Ultrasound might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by [CONTACT_12148].  
Tumor markers will not be used to assess objective response for the primary study endpoint.   Baseline documentation of target and non-target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) 
and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by [CONTACT_14217]). 
A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
baseline sum LD. The baseline for sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_62441].  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also 
be recorded at baseline. Measurement of these lesions is not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted through follow-up evaluations.  
Response criteria Evaluation of target lesions Complete response Disappearance of all target lesions Partial response At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the

Progressive disease (PD)  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD 
of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  
Stable disease (SD) Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for a 
partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started

 Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at the time should be classified as having symptomatic deterioration. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment in the long term follow-up portion of the study. 
 In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete response status. 
 
Response confirmation 
To be assigned a status of PR or complete response, changes in tumor measurements must be 
confirmed by [CONTACT_3611] [ADDRESS_380335] met.  
Duration of Overall Response The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 
complete response or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or progressive disease is objectively documented, taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
Duration of Stable Disease SD is measured from the start of the treatmen t until the criteria for disease progression are 
met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

protocol accrual data so that they will be aware of imminent protocol closures. 
5.3 Informed Consent Requirements 
The Principal Investigator (PI) at each participating site will identify the physician members of the study team who will be obtaining consent and signing the consent form for therapeutic protocols. It is DF/HCC policy that Nurses and Fellows cannot obtain consent to greater than minimal risk trials.   
5.[ADDRESS_380340] be on file with the DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee prior to participant registration: 
xApproval Letter of the institution's IRB (An Expedited IRB first approval is NOT acceptable)
xIRB approval for all amendments 
Page 11
Version Date: October 2009 It is the individual institution's responsibility to notify its IRB of protocol revisions.  
Participating institutions will have 90 days from receipt to provide the DF/HCC Lead Institution 
or designee their IRB approval for Major Amendments to a protocol.    
DF/HCC defines a Major Amendment  as: A substantive change in the study which may 
increase or decrease the risk to study participants.  Major revisions require full IRB approval.  
The following criteria are examples of revisions to a protocol that are considered to be major amendments:  
x Change of eligibility (inclusion/exclusi on) criteria 
x Change in design of protocol 
x Change in statistical section 
x Change in sample size/accrual (e.g., doubling the sample size) 
x Change in informed consent 
x Change of estimated dropout rate 
x Change of treatment or intervention 
x Change of device 
x Change in primary objective evaluation process 
5.5 IRB Re-Approval 
Annual IRB re-approval from the Participating institution is required in order to register 
participants onto a protocol.  There is no grace period for a nnual re-approvals.
Protocol registrations will not be completed if a re-approval letter is not received by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Lead Institution or designee from the Participating Institutions on or before the anniversary of the previous approval date.   
5.[ADDRESS_380341] 14, 2002, which has modified the privacy rule in significant ways vis-à-vis research. 
In order for covered entities to use or disclose protected health information during the course of a 
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol the study participant must sign an Authorization.  This Authorization may or may not be separate from the Informed Consent.  The DF/HCC Multi-
Page 12
Version Date: October 2009 Center Protocol, with the approval from the DFCI IRB, w ill provide an Informed Consent 
template, which covered entities (DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol participating institutions) must 
use.  
The DF/HCC M ulti-Center Protocol will use all efforts to limit its use of protected health 
information in its trials.  However, because of the nature of these trials, certain protected health information must be collected per National Cancer Institute requirements. These are the primary reasons why DF/HCC has chosen to use Authorizations, signed by [CONTACT_89438], rather than limited data sets with data use agreements.   
5.7 Participant Registration and Randomization  
To register a participant, the following documents should be completed by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC M ulti-
Center Protocol p articipating site  and faxed to or e-mailed to the research manager at the Lead 
Institution: 
xCopy of required laboratory tests (coagulation test, hematology and blood chemistry, 
urinalysis, free T4, TSH, calcitonin/CEA (only MTC subjects), thyroglobulin/anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (only DTC subjects), and pregnancy test)xSigned informed consent form 
xHIPAA authorization form (if separate from the informed consent document)
xOther appropriate forms (e.g., Eligibility Screening Worksheet/Registration form, 
source documents confirming eligibility (pathology reports, radiology reports showing 
progression within6 months per RECIST criteria, treatment summary forms)) 
The research DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol p articipating site will then call ore-mail the Lead 
Institution or designee to verify eligibility. To complete the registration process, the Lead 
Institution or designee will: 
xVerify the patient meets all eligibility criteria through source documentation provided 
by [CONTACT_309978].  
xRegister the participant on the study with the DF/HCC Quality Assurance Office        
      for Clinical Trials (QACT).xFax or e-mail the participant case number, and if applicable the dose treatment level,  to 
the participating site 
xCall the research nurse or data manager at the participating site and  verbally confirm
registration.
Please fax all registrations to the research manager, Brian Davis, at the Lead Institution. The fax number is [PHONE_6468]. If you have any questions, please call [PHONE_6469].

confirmation memo for part icipants registered to DF/HCC M ulti-Center Protocol will 
be faxed or emailed to the registering institution within one working day of the registration. Treatment may not be initiated until the site r eceives a faxed or e-mailed
copy of the registration confirmation memo.  
5.9.4 Confidentiality:  All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the 
participant are strictly confidential. Any participant specific reports (i.e. Pathology Reports, MRI Reports, Operative Reports, etc.) submitted to the Lead Institution or designee must have the participant’s full name & social security number “blacked out” and the assigned DF/HCC QACT case number and protocol number
 written in (with 
the exception of the signed informed consent document). Participant initials may only be included or retained for cross verification of identification. 
5.10  Schedule of Data Submission 
The DF/HCC QACT develops a set of either paper or electronic case report forms, (CRF/eCRFs) for use with the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol.  QACT provides a web based training for eCRF users.  These forms are designed to collect data for each study. The schedule for submission of case report forms to the DF/HCC QACT is generally specified in each protocol. When not specified in the protocol, the DF/HCC QACT will require the forms to be submitted as follows:

Form Report from the DF/HCC QACT noting the missing forms.  These reports are compi[INVESTIGATOR_163871]/HCC QACT and distributed a minimum of three times a year.  
6.0 REQUISITIONING INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG
The ordering of investigational agent is generally specified in the protocol.  
Participating sites should order their own agent regardless of the supplier ([COMPANY_001]).  If the agent is commercially available, check with the local Director of Pharmacy and/or the 
Research Pharmacy to ensure that the agent is in stock. If the agent is not stocked, ensure that the agent can be ordered once the protocol is approved by [CONTACT_1036]. If the agent is investigational, ensure that the pharmacy will be able to receive and store the agent. The local IRB s hould be kept 
informed of who will supply the agent ([COMPANY_001]) so that any regulatory responsibilities can be met in a timely fashion.  
7.0  SAFETY ASSESSMENTS AND TOXICITY MONITORING 
All participants receiving investigational agents will be evaluated for safety.   The safety parameters include all laboratory tests and hematological abnormalities, physical examination findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported to the investigator by [CONTACT_4317].  All toxicities encountered during the study w ill be evaluated according to the NCI criteria 
(CTCAE v3.0) assigned to the protocol and recorded prior to each course of therapy.  Life-
threatening toxicities should be reported immediately to the Protocol Chair and Institutional 
Review Board (IRB).  
Additional safety assessments and toxicity monitoring will be outlined in the protocol. 
7.1 Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse drug experience at any dose that results  in any of 
the following outcomes: death, a life-threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309946] 19
Version Date: October [ADDRESS_380350] that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or abuse. 
[COMPANY_001] guidelines on serious adverse events 
Information about all serious adverse events w ill be collected and recorded. A serious adverse event is 
an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which: 
x      is fatal or life-threatening 
x results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
x constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
x requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], unless 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
x routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any               deterioration in condition (specify what this includes) 
x elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since the start of study drug 
x treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
x social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s general condition 
x is medically significant, i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
7.2 Guidelines for Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Guidelines for reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will be followed as is delineated in Section 3 of the protocol: 
In addition, the Participating Institutions must report the serious adverse events to the Protocol 
Chair and the Coordinating Center (Lead Institution) at the time SAEs are submitted.   
Participating investigators must report each serious adverse event to the DF/HCC Overall 
Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_874] 24 business hours of learning of the occurrence. In the event that the participating investigator does not become aware of the serious adverse event immediately (e.g., 
Page 20
Version Date: October 2009 participant sought treatment elsewhere), the participating investigator is to report the event 
within [ADDRESS_380351] awareness of the adverse event. Report serious adverse events by [CONTACT_309979]: 
DF/HCC Overall Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_309947], M D, M S Telephone: [PHONE_6470] Email: [EMAIL_6105] 
Within the following 24-[ADDRESS_380352] provide follow-up information on the serious adverse event. Follow-up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how the event was treated, and whether the participant will continue or discontinue study participati on. The Lead Institution w ill maintain 
documentation of all Adverse Event Reporting and be responsible for communicating all SAEs to all Participating sites.
[COMPANY_001] and FDA instructions for rapid notification of serious adverse events 
The p rincip al investigator has the obligation to rep ort all serious adverse events to the FDA, IRB, and 
[COMPANY_001] Pharmaceuticals Clinical Safety and Epi[INVESTIGATOR_066] (CS&E).

Version Date: October 2009 7.3 Guidelines for Processing IND Safety Reports  
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations require sponsors of clinical studies to 
notify the FDA and all participating investigators of any serious and unexpected adverse experiences that are possibly related to the investigational agent. In compliance with these FDA 
regulations, the Protocol Chair is responsible for reviewing all IND Safety Reports and forwarding the IND Safety Reports to the Participating Institutions.  The investigator’s are to file a copy with their protocol file and send a copy to their IRB according to their local IRB’s policies and procedures. 
8.0 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS AND DE VIATIONS 
Neither the FDA nor the ICH GCP guidelines define the terms “protocol violation” or “protocol deviation.”  All DF/HCC Protocol Chairs must adhere to those policies set by [CONTACT_89426], the definitions for protocol violation and deviation as described by [CONTACT_309982]/HCC M ulti-center Protocol.  
8.1 Definitions 
Protocol Deviation: Any departure from the defined procedures set forth in the IRB-approved 
protocol. 
Protocol Exception:  Any protocol deviation that relates to the eligibility criteria, e.g., 
enrollment of a subject who does not meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Protocol Violation: Any protocol deviation that was not prospectively approved by [CONTACT_143069].    
8.2 Reporting Procedures 
The Protocol Chair:
 is responsible for ensuring that clear documentation is available in the 
medical record to describe all protocol exceptions, deviations and violations.  The Protocol Chair will also be responsible for ensuring that all protocol violations/deviations are promptly reported per DFCI IRB guidelines.  
Participating Institutions
: Protocol deviations require prospective approval from DFCI IRB. 
The Participating institution must submit the deviation request to the Protocol Chair or 
designee, who will submit the deviation request to the DFCI I RB. Upon DFCI IRB approval the 
deviation should be submitted to the participating site’s own IRB, per its institutional policy. 
Page 22
Version Date: October 2009 A copy of the participating institution’s IRB report and determination will be forwarded to the 
DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee by [CONTACT_2319], facsimile, or via e-mail within [ADDRESS_380354] be sent to the DF/HCC Lead Institution Protocol Chair or designee 
in a timely manner.  
Coordinating Center:
  Upon receipt of the violation/deviation report from the participating 
institution, the DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee w ill submit the report to the Protocol 
Chair for review. Subsequently, the participating institution’s IRB violation/deviation report 
will be submitted to the DFCI IRB for review per DFCI IRB reporting guidelines.  
9.0 QUALITY ASS URANCE 
The quality assurance process for a clinical trial research study requires verification of protocol compliance and data accuracy. As the Coordinating Center, the DF/HCC Lead Institution or 
designee with the aid of the QACT provides quality assurance oversight for the DF/HCC Multi-center Protocol.
9.1 Ongoing Monitoring of Protocol Compliance
All data submitted to the DF/HCC QACT will be monitored for timeliness of submission,
completeness, and adherence to protocol requirements.  M onitoring will begin at the time of participant registration and will continue during protocol performance and completi on.  The Lead 
Institution or designee and if applicable QACT Data Analysts assigned to the Protocol will perform the ongoing protocol compliance monitoring with the support of the participating institution’s Coordinators, the Principal Investigators, and the Protocol Chair.  
9.[ADDRESS_380355]: Eligibility criteria are checked on a protocol-specific eligibility 
checklist and faxed to the DF/HCC QACT prior to registration on protocol.  The checklist and informed consent document are reviewed by a DF/HCC QACT Protocol Registrar before the participant can be registered on a protocol.  The DF/HCC QACT cannot make exceptions to the eligibility requirements. 
9.2.5  Accrual of Eligible Participants: Annual accrual rates for eligible participants enrolled 
onto therapeutic clinical trials is calculated for each instituti on. Institutions are expected to 
maintain the minimum annual average accrual as defined by [CONTACT_89444]. 
Page 23
Version Date: October 2009 9.3 On-Site Auditing
[IP_ADDRESS] DF/HCC Sponsored Trials
 Sites are expected to notify DFCI of all deviations and violations from the required data set based 
on the DFCI OHRS guidelines. The site is expected to comply with DF/HCC Lead Institution regulatory submission guidelines and should include IRB documents, CV’s, case report forms, and all institutional licenses and documents.  We will virtually monitor the external site monthly for 
source verification of case report forms and all regulatory documents. Some of these documents will include eligibility s ource documents (radiology reports proving progression, lab values, 
performance status, pathology reports, etc), prior treatment reports, bimonthly adverse event (toxicity) reports, laboratory hematology and chemistry reports (baseline, bimonthly, and end of treatment), serious adverse events supplementary documents, tumor measurement reports (baseline and bimonthly), and documentation of progression (if applicable).  
The participating institution may be subject to on-site monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC 
Lead Institution or designee. Sites will be monitored for compliance to the data collection guidelines found in the protocol under the section titled, “3.4 Visit Schedule and Assessments.” Participating sites should have source documentation for all data collected. 
9.3.2 Participating Institution: It is the participating instituti on’s responsibility to notify the 
DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee of all scheduled audit dates (internal or NCI) and re-audit dates (if applicable), which involve the DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol. All institutions willforward a copy of final audit and/or re-audit reports and corrective action plans (if applicable) to the DF/HCC Lead Institution or designee within 12 weeks after the audit date.  
9.3.3 Coordinating Center (Lead Institution or designee): The Protocol Chair will review all 
DF/HCC Multi-Center Protocol Final Audit reports and corrective action plans if applicable. The 
Lead Institution or designee must forward these reports to the DF/HCC QACT per DF/HCC policy for review by [CONTACT_57954]/HCC Audit Committee. Based upon the audit assessments the DF/HCC Audit Committee could accept or c onditionally accept the audit rating and final report. 
Conditional approval could require the Protocol Chair to implement recommendations or require further follow-up.  For unacceptable audits, the Audit Committee would forward the final audit report and corrective action plan to the DFCI IRB as applicable.
9.[ADDRESS_380356] Performance
  The Protocol Chair and DFCI IRB are charged with considering the totality of an institution’s 
performance in considering institutional part icipation in the DF/HCC M ulti-Center Protocol. 
Page 24
Version Date: October 2009 9.4.1 Corrective Actions : Institutions that fail to meet the performance goals of accrual, 
submission of timely accurate data, and adherence to protocol requirements will be recommended 
for a six- month probation period. Such institutions must respond with a corrective action plan and must demonstrate during the probation period that deficiencies have been corrected, as evidenced by [CONTACT_89445]. Institutions that fail to demonstrate significant improvement will be considered by [CONTACT_262974].
Appendix E: Correlative Studies Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_309948] 
1.Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks: In general, this is the preferred specimen and 
is especially important to submit in cases where tissues have been in formalin for 
a significant time.  Prolonged fixation (>2 weeks) may interfere with some immunohistochemical and molecular diagnostic assays.
2.Wet tissue:   If available, we also highly recommend that unprocessed tissues in 
10% neutral buffered formalin be submitted in addition to paraffin blocks.   
3.Unstained slides : Although not optimal, it may be possible to utilize unstained 
sections cut at 3-5 microns (40 slides per block) if paraffin blocks are unavailable.  
4.Fresh-frozen tissue:  (sent separately
 on dry ice)
Obtaining Biopi[INVESTIGATOR_309949] : Immediately place biopsy into biopsy bag and then into the 
histocassette. Place histocassette into formalin (completely submerged). 24 hours+  2 hours later, 
transfer histocassette containing the biopsy fixed in formalin and ship in vial with 30ml 70% 
ethanol. Formalin-fixed tissues should be thin (~1/4 inch) and fixed in 9 parts 10% buffered 
formalin to 1 part tissue. 
For fresh frozen tumor biopsy : Only in cases where a reasonable size biopsy (e.g. excisional 
biopsy, 5 mm punch, or 14G) could be collected for formalin fixation, a fresh frozen biopsy can be 
collected. Place tissue in cyrotube and let slide to bottom. Transfer tube into liquid nitrogen, 
Remove tube from liquid nitrogen with pair of tweeze rs and transport to freezer in liquid nitrogen 
or dry ice, and place in tube in a freezer of -70°C or below.  
General Guidelines for Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_309950] (dry-ice ) 
Formalin-fixed wet tissues. 
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks.* Glass slides with sections from paraffin-embedded blocks. Fresh frozen tissue. 
Formalin Fixed Tissues:
• To avoid shippi[INVESTIGATOR_309951], you may fix an appropriately sized sample 
for 24 hours, then ship with a smaller quantity of formalin; please indicate that the sample 
has been fully fixed prior to shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 
• Avoid putting large samples in narrow-mouthed containers; once these tissues fix, they can 
be difficult to retrieve.•DO NOT ship formalin-fixed tissues and cytology or hematology slides in the same 
container. Formalin fumes can compromise these results.  
• Formalin is a noxious volatile and toxic chemical and should be shipped with appropriate 
precautions.
• Submit specimens in leak-proof containers.  
• Surround this container with enough absorbent material to absorb any possible leakage.  
• Containers and absorbent material should then be enclosed in a second leak proof container 
(e.g., sealed plastic bag).  • Samples can then be enclosed in a sturdy and sealed container (cardboard box, styrofoam, 
plastic) for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
• Enclose the completed submission form in a separate sealed plastic bag, and place them 
between the inner sample container and the outer shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7788].  
•A completed submission form must accompany the sample. 
•Please clearly label each container with the tissue, number of sample (i.e. slides, 
blocks, etc), and patient initials and ID number.  
Unfixed Fresh Tissue 
(Only large specimens that are impractical for formalin fixation 
should be submitted fresh.) :
• Arrange for a delivery time to our facility, Monday through Friday only by [CONTACT_309983]. 
Lorch or calling the study manager at [PHONE_6469]. • Call our study team at ([PHONE_6473] when the specimen is on its way to our facility.  
• Double-bag the specimen in leak proof Bio-Hazard bags .
• Pack the specimen with sufficient, sealed ice packs in another, leak proof bag.  • Samples can then be enclosed in a sturdy and sealed container (cardboard box, styrofoam, 
plastic) for shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  • Enclose the completed submission form in a separate sealed plastic bag, and place them 
between the inner sample container and the outer shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7788].  
•A completed submission form must accompany the sample. 
•Please clearly label each container with the tissue, number of sample (i.e. slides, 
blocks, etc), and patient initials and ID number.

Amendment 1: February 26, [ADDRESS_677823] quality of life.  This radiation procedure is called stereotactic body 
radiotherapy (SBRT).  Traditional radiation therapy us ually includes at least 1-[ADDRESS_677824] significant improvement in pain 
and/or neurologic symptoms with traditional radiatio n therapy, as survival rates have improved patients 
are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_522597].  Traditional radiation therapy cannot be repeated 
at the same site in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], due to  the increased risk of in jury to normal tissue.  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522598], or  may not be an option due to prior surgery, other 
medical conditions or limited life expectancy.  Stereot actic body radiotherapy offers an alternative to 
surgery for management of recurrent disease, which can be  delivered in an outpatient setting with low risk 
of side effects.          Treatment of primary spi[INVESTIGATOR_522599], radiation therapy, or a combination of 
surgery followed by [CONTACT_69159].  As with spin e metastases, radiation therapy has been used to 
achieve tumor control, alleviate tumor-related pain, and improve neurologic symptoms such as weakness, 
numbness, and paresthesias.  The traditional radiation therapy course consists of daily treatment, Monday 
through Friday, for a period of approximately 3-[ADDRESS_677825] 
quality of life.  Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT ) allows the delivery of highly precise radiation in 
only 1-5 treatments.  Surgical management of patient s with primary spi[INVESTIGATOR_522600].  Some patients are not surgical candidates due to other serious medical 
conditions.  The advantage of SBRT over surgery is th at it is not painful, and does not require anesthesia 
or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  In addition, some of these benign tumors, such as meningiomas and schwannomas, 
also occur in the brain where radiosurgery has been  proven to produce local control rates similar to 
surgical resection.    
       Traditional fractionated radiation therapy for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522601].  A meta-
analysis of 16 randomized trials comparing various schedules of fractionated radiation therapy over 1-2 
weeks to single fraction radiotherapy demonstrated un satisfactory complete pain relief rates of less than 
30%.  Most studies analyzed used a single fraction of 8 Gy.  There was no difference between single fraction and multi-fraction radiotherapy in overall res ponse rate or complete response rate; however, the 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 4re-treatment rate was 2.5 fold higher for single fr action radiation therapy (1).  The dose that can be 
delivered safely in a single fraction of radiation to the sp ine is limited by [CONTACT_522646][INVESTIGATOR_1831].  
Standard radiation therapy commonly includes a relatively  long length of spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831], and delivers the full 
prescription dose to the cord.       Recent technological advances have made it po ssible to deliver high doses of radiation therapy with 
high precision over just a few days, while preserving function of surrounding critical structures.  This treatment modality, termed stereotactic body radiothe rapy (SBRT), is emerging as an expedient, safe, and 
effective radiation modality for a variety of malignanc ies.  SBRT was recently defined by [CONTACT_522647] (A STRO) as a “treatment method to deliver a high dose 
of radiation to the target, utilizing either a single do se or a small number of fractions with a high degree of 
precision within the body” (2).  Stereotactic radios urgery is a well-established treatment for intracranial 
metastases with local control rates of 80-90%.  Several institutions have investigated the use of SBRT for 
the treatment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522602] e tumors, and have reported excellent local tumor 
control, onset of pain relief and ne urologic improvement at least as rapid as traditional radiation therapy, 
with fairly low toxicity risk.  Many phase I and II tr ials of SBRT have now b een published demonstrating 
its efficacy and safety.  Although follow-up is variab le, the local control rates for metastatic disease have 
generally been in the range of 81-95%, at least pa rtial pain relief of 67-10 0%, and rates of late 
myelopathy of 0-4%.  No grade 3-[ADDRESS_677826] to other organs such as the 
kidneys, lungs, bowel, and esophagus (3).         Gerszten and colleagues from the University  of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_522603] a series of 393 patients with 500 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_522604] a maximum dose of 12.5-25 Gy 
(mean 20 Gy, or 16 Gy to the 80% isodose line) in a single fraction.  344 tumor sites had received prior 
fractionated radiation therapy (30 Gy in 10 fractions or  35 Gy in 14 fractions).  With a median follow-up 
of 21 months, 86% had significant long-term pain im provement and 88% had long-term tumor control.  
The rate of neurologic deficit improvement was 84%.   No tumor progression at immediately adjacent spi[INVESTIGATOR_522605].  There were no cases of  treatment-related myelopathy (4).   
 
       Some tumor histologies, such as renal ce ll carcinomas and malignant melanoma, are known to be 
relatively radioresistant, and thus standard RT may provide less than optimal clinical response.  The 
University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_522606] e metastases from renal cell cancer and malignant 
melanoma was reported by [CONTACT_522648] 2005.  Fort y-eight patients with 60 renal cell metastases were 
treated to 14-20 Gy (mean 16 Gy) prescribed to the 80% isodose line (maximum dose 17.5-25 Gy) in a single fraction.  Most patients had previously been  treated with fractionated external-beam radiation 
therapy.  With a median follow-up of 37 months, 89% of patients had durable pain improvement and 
there were no cases of radiation myelopathy or radicu lopathy (5).  Thirty-six melanoma spi[INVESTIGATOR_522607] 28 patients were treated with single fraction S BRT using the same dose regimen.  With a median 
follow-up of 13 months, 96% of patients had long-te rm pain improvement and there were no cases of 
neural toxicity (6). 
 
       Chang and colleagues published MD Anders on Cancer Center’s phase I/II experience using SBRT 
for spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278].  Seventy-four tumors in 63 patient s were treated to 30 Gy in 5 fractions or 27 Gy in 
3 fractions delivered every 2 days, with typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] 80-90% of the target volume receiving at least the 
prescription dose.  Thirty-five patients had previously received in-field radiation therapy, with the cord 
dose limited to < 45 Gy.  No chemotherapy was given within 30 days of radiosurgery.  With a median 
follow-up of 21.3 months, the 1-year local control ra te based on MRI imaging was 84%, and narcotic use 
decreased from 60% to 36% at six months.  Twenty -three percent of patients progressed radiographically, 
and the pattern of failure suggested that the pedicl es and posterior elements using a wide bone margin 
posterior to the involved vertebrae should be routinely included in the planning target volume.  The spi[INVESTIGATOR_522608] 1: February 26, [ADDRESS_677827] was limited to 10 Gy in 5 fractions or 9 Gy in 3 fractions.  No patient developed grade 3 or 4 
neurologic toxicity (7). 
 
       Yamada and colleagues from Memorial Sloa n-Kettering Cancer Center tr eated 103 spi[INVESTIGATOR_522609] 93 patients with SBRT to a median dose of 24 Gy (range 18-24 Gy), with the median percentage of the 
PTV receiving at least 95% of the dose being 95% (82- 100%).  No patient had received prior RT to the 
region of interest.  The maximum spi[INVESTIGATOR_522263] w as limited to 14 Gy and the cauda equina dose was 
limited to 16 Gy.  With a median follow-up of 15 months, 90% of patients experienced durable pain 
control and local control.  The median time to local fa ilure was 9 months.  Local control was dose-related:  
95% for 24 Gy compared to 80% for < 24 Gy (mean 20.8 Gy).  Treatment failure was defined as disease 
progression on MRI.  Acute toxicity was generally m ild (grade 1-2), and there were not cases of late 
myelopathy or radiculopathy (8).  
       The Stanford University experience was re ported by [CONTACT_522649].  Seventy-four patients 
with 102 spi[INVESTIGATOR_522610].  The majority (50 patients) had prior radiation 
therapy within or adjacent to the tr eatment site.  Patients were treated to 16-[ADDRESS_677828] Dmax > 10 Gy.  With a mean 
follow-up of 9 months, 84% had improvement or re solution of their symptoms and 3 patients (4%) 
developed clinical or radiographic signs of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522611] 6-[ADDRESS_677829] receiving a 
biological equivalent dose of 12 Gy in a single fraction (BED
3 of 58 Gy) was less than 0.[ADDRESS_677830] biologic equivalent dose to 10 Gy to < 0.3 cc and 12 Gy to < 0.15 cc in 1 fraction 
(9). 
        The Stanford University experience in treati ng benign tumors of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522612].  Fifty-
one patients with 55 benign extra-axial, intradural spin al tumors were treated with Cyberknife stereotactic 
radiosurgery, including 30 schwannomas, 9 neurofibro mas, and 16 meningiomas.  Only 4 patients were 
previously irradiated.  Eligibility criteria were contraindications for surgery due to medical co-
morbidities, underlying Neurofibromatosis I (7 patients)  or II (10 patients) resulting in multiple lesions 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_239559], or patient preference, with well-circumscribed lesions, no evidence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_522613].   The most common presenting symptom was 
pain, followed by [CONTACT_522650].  Pati ents were treated to 16-30 Gy in 1-5 fractions 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_424425] 80% IDL (most received 1-2 fractions ).  The median follow-up time was [ADDRESS_677831] stabilized (61%) or decreased (39%) in 
size.  Radiosurgery was not very effective at reversi ng mass effect.  Three tumors enlarged by < 10% at 6-
12 months, two were transient and one underwent su rgery for worsening pre-existing meylopathy.  
Schwannoma patients experienced 96%  local control, with 56% stable and 40% decreased in size on 
imaging.  The majority experienced stabilized clin ical symptoms, 50% had significant pain improvement, 
and 40% had decreased weakness or improved sensa tion; 18% experienced clinical worsening.  
Meningioma patients experienced 100% local control,  with 67% stable and 33% decreased in size on 
imaging.  Approximately 70% significant improveme nt in pain and 50% had improved strength, but 
without improvement in sensory loss.  Thirty per cent experienced minor worsening pain, numbness, or 
weakness.  Only 50% of neurofibroma patients we re symptomatically stable, and none had improved 
clinical symptoms.  However, 6 of 7 patients w ho underwent follow-up imaging had stable disease.  
Interesting, the surgical literature also reports poor  symptomatic control.  One patient with a meningioma 
(2%) experienced presumed radiation myelopathy 8 months after SBRT to a dose of 24 Gy in 3 fractions (maximum dose 3435 cGy); the volume of cord irradiated to 18 Gy was 1.7 cm

University on 15 patients treated to a mean prescrip tion dose of 20 Gy in 2-5 fractions.  With mean 
follow-up of 28 months, only 1 of 8 patients with fo llow-up angiography at 3 years showed complete 
obliteration; however, there were no further hemorrh ages or neurologic deterioration. The authors 
recommended not treating intramedullary lesions greater than 1.5 cm3 in volume, to minimize the chance 
of neural toxicity (9).           Sohn (from Korea) reported results at the Inte rnational Stereotactic Radiosurgery Society Meeting in 
July 2007 on the use of SBRT for 33 patients with  schwannoma or meningioma of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522614].  Patients received a single fracti on of 13 Gy (schwannoma) or 15 Gy (meningioma) 
prescribed to the 80% isodose line.  For patients with  spi[INVESTIGATOR_13377], fractionated stereotactic 
radiosurgery was utilized (24 Gy in 3 fractions).  W ith a mean follow-up of two years, there were no late 
toxicities. 
 
       Also at the International Stereotactic Ra diosurgery Society Meeting in July 2007, Sahgal (UCSF) 
reported the results of 16 patients w ith benign spi[INVESTIGATOR_522615] w ith Cyberknife radiosurgery.  Doses 
ranged from 12 Gy in 1 fraction to 5 Gy in 5 fracti ons.  With a median follow-up of 25 months, there 
were no late toxicities.  Three patients with Neur ofibromatosis I progressed.  The one year freedom from 
progression rate was 89%.   
  St. John’s Mercy has installed an Elekta Synergy-S
® linear accelerator at the David C. Pratt Cancer 
Center that is specifically designed to deliver hi ghly-precise SBRT treatments.  It has a tightened 
isocenter accuracy calibrated to a precision of within 1.5 mm diameter, a micro-MLC for treatment of small radiation ports, a specially designed Hexapod
® table top that can correct for patient misalignment in 
both translational and rotational directions, an onboa rd cone-beam kV CT for precise tumor localization 
immediately prior to treatment, four-dimensional CT (4D-CT) and 3D Line® which together allow for 
accurate monitoring of and compensation for tumor moti on during respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], activ e breathing control for 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_125344], and real-time continuous fluorosco pic capability for visual confirmation that the target 
remains in the treatment field. 
 
2.0 Objectives  
  This study will evaluate the local control rate as we ll as acute and late toxicity rates of stereotactic 
body radiotherapy (SBRT) for the treatment of  spi[INVESTIGATOR_522616]. 
 
 2.1 Hypothesis 
  2.1.1  For selected patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_522617], stereotactic body  
   radiotherapy (SBRT) is technically feasible with acceptable complication rates.   2.1.2  Local tumor control rate with stereotactic bod y radiotherapy (SBRT) will be at least as  
   good as standard fractionation radiation therapy. 
 
 2.2 Study Design  
  2.2.1  Single site, non-randomized, prospective, phase IV trial 
  2.2.2  Composed of 2 patient groups: 
        Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522618] 
  2.2.3  Data collected will include patient demo graphics, pathology data, tumor stage,  
   SBRT dose fractionation scheme, dose received by [CONTACT_522651],     tumor recurrence data, and acute and late toxicities.     2.2.4  Follow up data will be collected during th e patient’s standard office visits.  The 
    anticipated duration of this study is 5 years. 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 7 2.3 End Points  
  2.3.1  Primary endpoints will be symptom cont rol and local tumor recurrence rate.   
   -  Evaluation of pain relief will be assessed using a 10-point visual analog scale 
   -  Analgesic use will be documented to ensu re that pain improvement is not due to an  
       increase in the amount of analgesic usage.     -  Evaluation of neurologic improvement  will be assessed by [CONTACT_522652]    - Local recurrence is defined as tumor recurrence or progression within the planning  
    target volume.  
- Local control rate will be evaluated by [CONTACT_522653]/or clinical symptoms  
 (worsening or no improvement in pain or neurologic compromise).  If follow-up     imaging is available, a local recurrenc e will be defined as an increase of > 20% in  
   tumor size.   
  2.3.2  Secondary endpoint will be late toxicity rate.

6.0  Radiation Treatment Planning  
 
 6.1 Target Definition 
  6.1.1  Gross tumor volume (GTV) is contoured on the planning CT scan.  MRI images  
   will be registered to the planning CT da taset to assist in constructing the GTV.   
  6.1.2  Clinical target volume (CTV) will be equal to the GTV  
  6.1.3  Planning target volume (PTV) for vertebral metastases will be defined as the CTV    
   plus a 2-[ADDRESS_677842].  It is     recommended that consideration be given to including the entire involved vertebral  
   body plus the pedicles and posterior el ements of the involved vertebral bodies.   
 
Amendment 1: February 26, [ADDRESS_677843] (including the cauda equina when     appropriate) will be contoured for all cases.  The esophagus, stomach, bowel, kidneys,  
   liver, larynx, lungs, and heart will be contoured when appropriate. 
  6.2.[ADDRESS_677844] – Contours should extend from th e superior slice of the planning CT scan  
   or the foramen magnum (whichever is most caudad) to the inferior slice of the  
   planning CT scan or the terminal end of th e spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (whichever is most cephalad).  
   The volume may be expanded by 1-2 mm for setup uncertainty. 
  6.2.3  Cauda Equina – Contours should extend from th e superior slice of the planning CT  
   scan or the terminal end of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831]  (whichever is most caudad) to the inferior  
   slice of the planning CT scan or the termin al end of the cauda equina (which is most  
   cephalad), and includes the entire thecal sac.  The volume may be expanded by     1-2 mm for setup uncertainty. 
6.2.4 Esophagus – Contours should include the entire esophagus, from 2 cm above the  
 manubrium to the level of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction.  When possible, oral  
 contrast should be utilized to aid in volume definition. 6.2.5 Stomach – Contours should include the entire st omach, with the proximal limit at the

  following are a list of agents that have been suggested by [CONTACT_522654], and possibly prevent acute and/or late toxicity if used as  
  premedication prior to spi[INVESTIGATOR_522623].  
  7.1.1 Corticosteroids (Decadron 4-10 mg PO or equivalent) 15-60 minutes prior to each  
   fraction for the intended purpose of modulating immediate inflammatory effects.     7.1.2 Analgesic premedication to avoid general di scomfort during long treatment durations.  
  7.1.3  Prophylactic antiemetics (Zofran 4-8 mg PO or Kytril 2 mg PO) 45-60 minutes prior  
   to each fraction to possibly prevent acute nausea 
  7.1.4  Anti-anxiety medication for patient comfort during long treatment duration 
  7.2 Treatment  
  7.2.1  The medical physics staff will perform routine quality assurance checks on the  
   treatment machine to ensure that the mechanical isocenter stability is within  
   specification (ie. diameter < 1.5 mm).  
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 12  7.2.2  The medical physics staff will perform patient-specific quality assurance  
   measurements to ensure that the treatme nt plan is deliverable and that the dose  
   distribution is accurate.  
  7.2.3  The patient will be positioned in the cu stom immobilization device on the Hexapod®  
   treatment couch and aligned to 3-poi nt setup points with the in-room lasers. 
  7.2.[ADDRESS_677851].  Translational and rotational  
   adjustments of patient positioning are performed as indicated.  If adjustments are  
   required, an orthogonal (ex. AP and LATERAL) set of electron portal images or a     second cone-beam CT of the treatment area will be obtained prior to treatment 
   to confirm proper alignment of the is ocenter.  A third cone-beam CT may be  
   obtained following treatment deliver y to assess for intra-fraction motion.   
   Depending on the overall treatment time, an additional cone-beam CT scan may be  
   obtained during treatment at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist to     ensure accuracy of the isocente r alignment and target localization. 
  7.2.5  Either multiple coplanar or noncoplanar static  gantry angle intensity-modulated fields  
   or rotational arcs will be utilized. 
  7.2.6  Only photon (x-ray) beams will be used, preferably in energies of 6-[ADDRESS_677852] 2 weeks  
  after completing radiation.  In addition, it is not recommended to perform SBRT when  
  targeted anti-angiogenesis therapy is pla nned within 2 months of the procedure.

numbness, and/or paresthesias.  Other serious  late toxicities are rare and may include 
vertebral body collapse, persistent dysphagi a, esophageal stricture, bowel ulceration 
and/or perforation, impaired liver function,  reduction in kidney function, reduction in 
lung function, hypothyroidism, persistent hoarseness, and localized skin fibrosis 
edema and/or ulceration.

  - Premedication as described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_677859] / cauda equina compression.  Standard  
  fractionation radiation therapy consists of a daily treatment regimen for approximately 2-3  
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 15  weeks, and has demonstrated unsatisfactory comple te pain relief rates and tumor control rates.   
  Stereotactic body radiotherapy shortens the radiation course to only 1-5 sessions.  Non- 
  surgical treatment for recurrent spi[INVESTIGATOR_522626].  Traditional radiation therapy  
  cannot be repeated at the same site in the spin e, due to the increased risk of injury to normal

Informed Consent for a Clinical Research Study  
 
STUDY TITLE: PHASE IV TRIAL EVALUATING THE USE OF STEREOTACTIC BODY  
 RADIOTHERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF SPI[INVESTIGATOR_522634] a clinical trial (type of research study).  Cl inical trials include only patients who choose to take 
part.  This consent form may contain words that yo u do not understand.  Please ask the study doctor or the 
study staff to explain any words or information th at you do not clearly understand.  You may take home 
an unsigned copy of this consent form to think ab out or discuss with family and friends before making 
your decision.    WHAT SHOULD YOU KNOW ABOUT THE RESEARCH DOCTOR? 
 
You should know that your relationship with a resea rch doctor is different from your relationship with 
your personal doctor.  Your personal doctor is treating your specific problem with the hope of a benefit 
for you.  When a doctor is your research doctor, he/she  is treating all subjects under a specific protocol to 
learn about the results of a treatment, and with th e understanding that you may or may not benefit from 
your participation in the study.  Be sure to ask questio ns of the study doctor if you want more information 
about this relationship. 
 WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING PERFORMED?   Treatment of cancer that has spread to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (metas tases) and tumors that begin in the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (primary 
tumors) is challenging and the outcome is often di sappointing.  Treatment may consist of surgery, 
radiation therapy, or a combination of surgery followe d by [CONTACT_69159].  Radiation therapy has been 
used to improve local tumor control, alleviate tumo r-related pain, prevent spi[INVESTIGATOR_172707], and improve 
neurologic symptoms such as weakness and numbness. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_522635], or may not be an optio n due to prior surgery or other medical conditions.  
While a standard course of radiation therapy may take  2-[ADDRESS_677861] additional data on the effectiveness of 
stereotactic body radiotherapy for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522636].   
 HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THE STUDY?  Approximately 50 people are expected to participate in this clinical study.  
 
WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE STUDY? 
 If you wish to take part in this study, a series of t ests will be performed to determine if you qualify for 
participation in the clinical study.  Your physic ian will ask you a series of questions regarding your 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, [ADDRESS_677862] and their medical 
physics staff.  You will receive between 1-5 radia tion treatments.  Your physician will explain your 
treatment in more detail.  Each radiation session may ta ke an hour or longer to complete.  After the entire 
radiation course is complete, you will be  given follow-up instructions.    
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY?  We anticipate that you will remain in the study for a pproximately [ADDRESS_677863] year, then less 
frequently. 
 Your physician may decide stop your treatment if: 1) your disease becomes worse, or 2) side effects become very severe, or 3) new scientific developments occur that indicate the treatment is not in your best 
interest, or 4) your physician believes that this tr eatment is no longer in your best interest.  If your 
treatment is stopped, your doctor will discuss further treatment options with you.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  By [CONTACT_4907], you are at risk for sev eral possible expected and unexpected side effects 
associated with stereotactic body radiotherapy to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Some of these are described below; however, 
there also may be other side effects that we cannot pr edict.  Most side effects go away shortly after the 
radiation therapy is stopped, but in some cases side e ffects can be serious, long-lasting, or permanent.  
 Risks arising from the delivery of stereotactic radi otherapy to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522637], but are not limited to:   • Fatigue 
 • Nausea occurring within a few hours of treatment 
 • Loss of appetite  • Hair loss over the treatment area  • Skin redness over the treatment area  • Skin tanning over the treatment area 
 • Dry peeling of skin over the treatment area 
 • Moist desquamation over the treatment area  • Dry itchy skin  • Muscular pain over the treatment area  • Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)  • Dyspnea (shortness of breath) 
 • Hoarseness 
 • Diarrhea 
• Neurologic changes including motor weakness, numbness, and/or paresthesias  
 
 
Amendment 1: February 26, 2009 18Risks arising from the delivery of stereotactic ra diotherapy to the spi[INVESTIGATOR_522638], but are not limited to:  
 • Bleeding ulceration and/or perforation (hole)  in the stomach, duodenum, and/or small bowel 
 • Scarring, swelling, and/or ulceration of the skin over the treatment area  • Persistent dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) or esophageal stricture  • Persistent hoarseness  • Decrease in liver function  • Decrease in kidney function 
 • Dyspnea (shortness of breath) due to decrease in lung function 
 • Decrease in thyroid function  • Vertebral body collapse / fracture 
• Neurologic changes including motor weakness, numbness, and/or paresthesias 
 
I understand that all these side effects are possible.  I may experience no side effects, some of them, or 
most of them.  Although I will be closely monitored, not all side effects can be predicated and unforeseen 
problems can arise.  I understand that there may be some unknown or unanticipated risks or discomforts 
in addition to those specified here.  
Reproductive risks:  Because even very small doses of  radiation can affect an unborn baby, you should 
not become pregnant while receiving radiation treat ment.  You should also not nurse a baby [CONTACT_522656].   ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKI NG PART IN THE STUDY? 
 
If you agree to take part in this study, there may or ma y not be a direct medical benefit to you.  However, 
there have been several trials completed at other ins titutions that have shown high local control rates, 
improvement in pain and neurologic symptoms after stereotactic body radiotherapy for spi[INVESTIGATOR_522639].  It is also convenient, re quiring only 1-5 radiation sessions and no anesthesia or 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Toxicity risk has been reported to be fairly low. 
 
WHAT OTHER OPTIONS ARE THERE?  Other treatment options may include surgery, chemot herapy, standard-fractionation radiation therapy, or 
other investigational procedures or medications.  Anot her option is no further therapy.  Your doctor can 
provide information about your disease and the benefits of the different treatments for you.  You should 
feel free to talk with your doctor about your disease and expected outcomes.  The doctor involved in your 
care will be available to answer any questions you have about this program.  You are free to ask your 
doctor any questions concerning this program now or in the future.  
 You are free to seek care from a doctor of your choice at any time.  If you do not take part in, or withdraw 
from, the study you will continue to receive alternate care.   
 WHAT ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY?  Efforts will be made to keep your personal info rmation confidential.  We cannot guarantee absolute 
confidentiality.  This Informed Consent and anot her document called an “Authorization to Use and 
Disclose Health Information” control how your health  information may be used and disclosed during and 
after this study.  The results of this study may be published or presented at meetings but will not include 
your name [CONTACT_522661].  To participate in this study, you must sign both the Informed Consent and the Authorization to Use and Disclose Health Information.  Your personal information may be 
disclosed if required by [CONTACT_2371].

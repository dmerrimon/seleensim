FINAL 11OCT2018   1   STUDY INTRODUCTION 1.0This statistical analysis plan is based on the protocol “A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Safety, Tolerability, and Efficacy Trial of a Novel Botanical Drug Product, Containing East Indian Sandalwood Oil (EISO) For the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis”, Amendment No. 6, dated [ADDRESS_24685] one adverse event (AE) tabulated with respect to severity, duration, and relationship to the study drug.  1.1.2 Additional Objectives Additional objectives are to evaluate tolerability and preliminary efficacy. Tolerability will be assessed based on the number of subjects reporting discomfort during or immediately following application of study drug in the treatment areas. Discomfort will also be recorded as an AE.  Preliminary efficacy will be assessed based on the following summaries:  • Percentage of subjects who have a ≥25% reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at any point during the trial. • Number of subjects with an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of “clear” or “almost clear” at any time during the 28 days of treatment.  • Percentage of subjects who have a ≥50% reduction in the EASI at any point during the trial. • Percentage of subjects achieving at least a 1-grade improvement in IGA score.  • Percentage of subjects who have at least a 20% reduction in BSA affected by [CONTACT_25781].  STUDY DESIGN 2.02.[ADDRESS_24686] 18 years of age with atopic dermatitis. Subjects will enter the Screening Period once the informed consent and photographic consent process has been completed. Subjects with a total body surface area (BSA) of ≥2% and ≤ 15% atopic dermatitis involvement in the treatable areas, and who meet all of the inclusion, and none of the exclusion criteria, will be enrolled. The original protocol design is based on randomization of enrolled subjects to either 5% SAN007 cream or placebo cream in a 2:1 ratio. Amendment 6 of the study protocol added the randomization of 10% SAN007 cream or placebo cream in a 2:1 ratio. This new randomization is implemented at new sites and sites continuing enrollment once the 5%/Placebo randomization had been completed at the site. This will result in some sites with only the 5%/Placebo groups, some sites with only the 
Santalis Pharmaceuticals Protocol No. SAN007-02: Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document  
FINAL 11OCT2018   Page 2  10%/Placebo groups, and some sites with both 5%/Placebo and 10%/Placebo groups. Once subject eligibility is confirmed and the screening procedures completed, all enrolled subjects will start the Treatment Period of the study. All enrolled subjects will receive either 10% SAN007 cream, 5% SAN007 cream or placebo cream as described above with the first dose applied at Visit 1 Baseline. Subjects will be instructed on how to apply the study medication twice daily, ≥ 8 hours between applications, for 28 days. Subjects will return to the clinic for study-related assessments on Study Days 7, 14, and 28 for study-related assessments. On Study Days 21 and 35, subjects will receive a follow-up phone call.

FINAL 11OCT2018   Page 3  Although non-compliance is defined in the protocol as <90% compliance with study treatment, subsequent consideration of subject medication use evaluated prior to study data unmasking lead to a reduction in the threshold to <60% compliance. 3.4 Other Analysis Sets An Intent-to-Treat Analysis Set (ITT) is defined as all subjects enrolled and randomized into the study. However, there is no analysis specific to the ITT population and it will not be used in the generation of any tables or listings.  The Enrolled Population is defined as all subjects who signed the informed consent. The Enrolled Population is referred to in the generation of listings and tabulation of subject disposition.  3.[ADDRESS_24688] treatment will not be reassigned. These subjects will be noted in the clinical study report.  STATISTICAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS 4.04.1 Statistical Considerations Data listings and summary tables will be provided. Listings will include all data captured on the electronic case report form (eCRF) unless specified otherwise. Calculated (derived) variables will be listed as appropriate. Summary tables will be provided for select variables as described in Section [ADDRESS_24689] algorithm. 4.1.1 Quantitative Assessments Quantitative assessments (continuous data) will be summarized by [CONTACT_25783] (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum value, and maximum value.  4.1.2 Qualitative Assessments Qualitative assessments (categorical data) will be summarized by [CONTACT_25784] (count and percent) of subjects falling within the category. Unless specified otherwise for a particular assessment, the denominator for calculating a percentage will be the total number of subjects in the analysis population for the subgroup being analyzed; for example, within study arm, the number of subjects within the study arm in the analysis population will be the denominator. For overall summaries, the total number of subjects in the analysis population will be used as the denominator.  4.[ADDRESS_24690] unless specified otherwise; unscheduled visit data will be included in the carry forward procedure. No imputations will be made for missing safety data.   
Santalis Pharmaceuticals Protocol No. SAN007-02: Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document  
FINAL 11OCT2018   Page [ADDRESS_24691] disposition in terms of all randomized, completed or discontinued status, and reason for discontinuation will be summarized for each study arm and over all study arms by [CONTACT_25785]. Analysis populations (FAS, PP, and Safety) will be summarized for each study arm and over all study arms by [CONTACT_25785]. All percentages will be based on the Enrolled Population. Details of subject disposition and discontinuation status will be provided in a by-subject listing.   5.[ADDRESS_24692] compliance parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics for each study arm. These parameters include the following: • Number of applications missed (quantitative assessment) • Total weight of product used (quantitative assessment) • Average weight per application of product (quantitative assessment) • The number and percentage of subjects who received fewer than 60% of prescribed applications (and considered non-compliant with the treatment) at each visit, and over all study visits.   For the assessment of compliance to product use the number of missed applications will be summarized instead of the number of received applications (specified in the protocol). The number of missed applications is collected at each visit whereas the number of applications received would be calculated by [CONTACT_25786].  Compliance will also be based on information collected in the Treatment Medication Dispensation page. For any period, compliance (%) will be calculated as 100 x (weight of tube that was dispensed – weight of tube returned)/(number of days in this period x 2 x DOSE). DOSE will be calculated as initial weight of tube – weight of tube after first on site application (Day 1) since this is the dose application demonstrated to the subject.  This value may be greater than 100%. However, if the value is less than 60%, the subject will be considered non-compliant for that study treatment interval. Using these same calculations, compliance over all study visits will be calculated using available data from the medication dispensation log. Weight of drug used from a tube will be the difference of the last medication weight reported and the weight of the tube at dispensation. If multiple tubes are used, cumulative product weight will be calculated.   EVALUATION OF BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS 6.0Analyses in this section will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set by [CONTACT_25787].  
Santalis Pharmaceuticals Protocol No. SAN007-02: Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document  
FINAL 11OCT2018   Page 5  6.1 Demographics Demographic data will be summarized for the quantitative (or numerical) assessments (age, height (cm), and weight (kg)) and the qualitative (or categorical) assessments (gender, race, and ethnicity). If multiple races are reported for a single subject or if races are listed besides the ones being summarized the count will be ascribed to the ‘other’ category. Percentages will be based on the number of non-missing responses. Results will be presented in by-subject listings. 6.2 Baseline Disease Characteristics Disease characteristics at baseline will be summarized for quantitative assessments, percent of body surface area being treated and EASI, and the qualitative assessments, target treatment area and IGA score.  6.3 Medical History/Signs and Symptoms Medical conditions reported in the pertinent medical history will be mapped to preferred term (PT) and system organ class (SOC) using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA 19.0). Results will be provided in a by-subject listing.  EVALUATION OF SAFETY PARAMETERS 7.0All safety analyses will be performed using the Safety Analysis Set.  The safety parameters collected and monitored during this study include adverse events, treatment tolerability, and concomitant medications.  7.1 Adverse Events An adverse event (AE) means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the drug, without judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. Non-serious AEs will be captured through the last treatment application, Day 28/exit, and serious AEs will be captured up through 28 days following the discontinuation of therapy.  All AEs reported will be considered to be treatment-emergent. Verbatim adverse events will be mapped to PT and SOC using MedDRA 19.0.  Tabular summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in terms of number of subjects will be presented by [CONTACT_25788]: • PT presented in order of descending incidence in the SAN007 group then alphabetically • SOC and PT presented in order of descending incidence in SOC, then PT, in the SAN007 group, then alphabetically by [CONTACT_3592] § repeat presentation for subset of study-drug related events 
Santalis Pharmaceuticals Protocol No. SAN007-02: Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document  
FINAL 11OCT2018   Page 6  • SOC, PT, and maximum severity grade (mild, moderate, severe) presented alphabetically by [CONTACT_25789], probably, or definitely related to study treatment. Missing relationship will be treated as related. Subjects will be counted once within each level of summarization within each study arm for the calculation of incidence. A summary of count and percent of subjects with at least one event in the following categories will be tabulated: any TEAE, any mild TEAE, any moderate TEAE, any severe TEAE, any treatment-related TEAE, any serious TEAE, any TEAE that led to discontinuation of study drug, and any deaths. Note that any AE is only considered for its maximum severity. However a subject can have more than one AE and each may have a different maximum severity. Thus severity levels are not mutually exclusive.  A comprehensive listing of all AEs will be provided by [CONTACT_1130], which will include the duration of each event. Duration will be calculated as the stop date of the event minus the start date, unless the event is determined ongoing at exit. 7.[ADDRESS_24693] listing.  7.3 Prior and Concomitant Medication/Therapy All prior and concomitant medications will be coded with WHODrug (MAR2016) and results will be presented in a by-subject listing with prior or ongoing-at-baseline medication/therapy identified.    EVALUATION OF EFFICACY PARAMETERS 8.0Analyses in this section will be based on the FAS and the PP analysis set. The primary set for efficacy analyses will be the FAS; supportive analyses will be based on the PP. All analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_25790]. Throughout this section the term ‘follow-up visit’ will refer to any post-baseline visit, whether an office visit or a telephone contact. Only safety data and status of atopic dermatitis were to be collected at the Day 35 follow-up visit.  8.1 Investigator’s Global Assessment The IGA is a categorical assessment of the treated area made according to the following scale:   
Santalis Pharmaceuticals Protocol No. SAN007-02: Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document  
FINAL 11OCT2018   Page [ADDRESS_24694] perceptible population/infiltration Mild 2 Mild erythema and mild population/infiltration Moderate 3  Moderate erythema and moderate population/infiltration Severe 4 Severe erythema and severe population/infiltration  The incidence of clear/almost clear grading (score of 0 or 1) will be summarized by [CONTACT_6492]-up visit. A summary over all follow-up visits will also be provided and is defined as the number and percentage of subjects achieving clear/almost clear at any time point during the 28 days of therapy.  Improvement in scores will also be calculated as change from baseline score  (follow-up value – baseline value) by [CONTACT_6492]-up visit and over all follow-up visits; over all follow-up visits will be based on the best change from baseline (lowest value) at any time point during the 28 days of therapy. Improvement in score from baseline score will be assigned to the category of no improvement if either no change or a worsening score (positive change) occurs, or the category(ies) ≥1 grade improvement, ≥[ADDRESS_24695] EASI scores between 2 and 50, inclusive, at baseline. Scores will be summarized by [CONTACT_25791] n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Change from baseline will be calculated at each follow-up visit (follow-up value – baseline value) and summarized by [CONTACT_6492]-up visit. Change values that are negative represent an improvement. Percent change from baseline ((follow-up value – baseline value)/baseline value) x 100 will also be summarized by [CONTACT_6492]-up visit.  Percent change from baseline will be assigned to one or more of the following categories: 
Santalis Pharmaceuticals Protocol No. SAN007-02: Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document  
FINAL 11OCT2018   Page 8  Group  Percent Reduction Category Percent change from baseline values 1 < 25% Reduction > -25.0 2 ≥ 25% Reduction ≤ -25.0 3 ≥ 50% Reduction ≤ -50.0 4 ≥ 75% Reduction ≤ -75.0 These groups are not mutually exclusive; results that fall into group [ADDRESS_24696] (lowest value/greatest reduction) percent change at any time point during the [ADDRESS_24697] listing. 8.3 Body Surface Area Body surface area is a continuous measure of the percent of atopic dermatitis involvement in the permitted treatment areas. For this study the population inclusion criteria specified a body surface area between 2.0% and 15.0% inclusive. Values will be summarized by [CONTACT_25791] n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Change from baseline will be calculated (follow-up value – baseline value) and summarized by [CONTACT_6492]-up visit. Here, change values that are negative represent an improvement. Percent change from baseline ((study visit value – baseline value)/baseline value) x [ADDRESS_24698] a 20% reduction in BSA affected by [CONTACT_25792]. The results will be presented in a by-subject listing. 8.[ADDRESS_24699]’s date of informed consent and the date of birth. Specifically, if a subject’s birthday has been reached by [CONTACT_25793], otherwise age will be the difference in years minus 1.  Baseline Baseline is defined as assessments completed on Visit 1 (Day 1) prior to the administration of the study drug unless otherwise 
Santalis Pharmaceuticals Protocol No. SAN007-02: Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document  
FINAL 11OCT2018   Page 9  CONVENTION DESCRIPTION specified.  Study Day  Date of visit or evaluation – baseline date + 1 Percentage calculation Percentages are calculated as 100*numerator/denominator. Rounding is not necessary because rounding is handled by [CONTACT_25794]. Denominator is the total number of subjects in a column group unless otherwise specified.  AE counting: treatment emergence An AE will be considered treatment emergent if it begins on or after the time of the first study treatment application. If the start date is the same as the date of first application (Day 1), the times are not present, or there is no indication that the AE began before dosing, the event will be considered treatment emergent.  AE counting: general summary In summary displays, AEs are counted only once per subject within a category (e.g., over all and preferred term).  AE counting: summary by [CONTACT_25795] (e.g., causality or severity), AEs are counted once per subject at the worst level of the assessment (e.g., least complementary relationship or greatest severity). A missing or unknown value for the assessment will be considered worst.  Change from Baseline current visit value – baseline visit value Percent Change from Baseline ((current visit value —baseline visit value) / baseline visit value) x 100  SPECIFICATIONS FOR ANALYSIS DISPLAYS 10.0All headers, titles, footnotes, and footers specified in the table and listing shells will be displayed in the produced output. Notes to the programmer will not be included in the produced output. Any minor deviation will not necessitate a revision to the Statistical Analysis Plan Implementation Document (SAPID) nor will it be considered a deviation from planned analyses. Only major differences in the analysis methods or data handling will necessitate such documentation.

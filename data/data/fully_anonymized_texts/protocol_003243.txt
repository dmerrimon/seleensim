 6 Confidential (T3 ) Power analysis was conducted for the following variables using data from a previous 
study:  
 
•  
  
  
  
• Vision  
•  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  A one -sided power analysis for this 
variable, assuming an alpha of 0.[ADDRESS_840714] deviation of 28.4 units and a meaningful 
difference of 10 units (on a 100 unit scale) determined that [ADDRESS_840715] 0.80 power for all the variables listed above.  To allow for discontinuations, 55 subjects will be recruited.  
1.7 Risk analysis  
This study is considered to be a non -significant risk study based on United State Food 
and Drug administration (FDA) and International Standards Organization (ISO) guidelines due to the daily wear nature of the study.   With the potential benefit of this s tudy, the work 
is considered to be ethically justifiable.  Ethical approval will be sought from the University of Manchester Senate Committee on the Ethics of Research on Human Beings (hereafter referred to as Manchester UREC).  The work where practical wi ll be conducted in 
accordance with the ICH Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the international standard BS EN ISO [ZIP_CODE]:20 11 ‘Clinical investigation of medical devices for human subjects’.

2.3 Safety parameters, adve rse events and concurrent illnesses  
The key safety parameters are the serious and significant adverse events listed in 
adverse events are classified as ‘serious’, ‘significant’ or ‘non -significant’).  
Clinical assessment is made at the study vi sit(s) for these parameters.  The presence of 
any ocular adverse event will be reported on CVI report forms  and those ocular adverse 
events described as ‘serious’ or ‘significant’ will be detailed in the final report.  Similarly,

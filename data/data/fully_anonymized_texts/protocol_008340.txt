Project Summary:  
 
Investigating  the timing to lactogenesis stage II  (defined as the initiation of copi[INVESTIGATOR_165392])  in women who  obtain the contraceptive implant in delivery room versus 
the postpartum ward will add important data to the literature. If insertion in this time 
period is found to be without negative effects on breastfeeding  the study findings 
would  facilitate earlier insertion of the contraceptive implant, in the d elivery room . 
Gurtcheff et al. recently analyzed  time to lactogenesis in women  initiating the  
contraceptive implant prior to medical dis charge following delivery and  4-[ADDRESS_191794].   We propose  a non -inferiority randomized control led trial comparing  time to 
lactogenesis stage II in h ealthy women with immediate insertion (0 -2 hours following 
delivery) of the contraceptive implant in the delivery room  versus in women with 
insertion of the contraceptive implant  following delivery  in the postpartum room and 
prior to medical discharge  (24 -48 hours following delivery).  We hypothesize there will 
be no significant difference in time to lactogenesis with immediate  delivery room (0 -2 
hours following delivery)  vs. postpartum ward insertion (24- 48 hours) . In addition, we 
plan to follow women postpartum to evaluate breastfeeding continuation and exclusivity, discontinuation of the implant and any adverse events.  
 Description of the Project:  
 1.1 Rationale :   
Over half of the 6.1 million pregnancies each year in the [LOCATION_002] are reported as unintended. [1]  More interventions are needed to prevent unintended pregnancies , as 
they are associated with higher maternal and child morbidity and mortality. [2] Infants conceived by [CONTACT_165396]. [ 3] 
Additionally, both unintended pregnancy and a short inter -pregnancy interval are 
associated with delayed and insufficien t prenatal care. [ 4] Gemmill et al. (2013) 
investigated the prevalence and correlates of short inter -pregnancy intervals in the 
[LOCATION_002]. These authors documented that one third of pregnancies conceived in a nationally representative sample were within 18 months of a previous birth (n=2253). After adjusting for sociodemographic and childbearing characteristics, women were significantly more likely to have a short inter pregnancy interval if they were ages 15 -19 
years old. [5]  
 Further, pregnancies of adolescents (ages 10 -18) and young women (ages 19 -24) are 
very unlikely to be planned pregnancies. In fact, 82% of pregnancies were unplanned in 
the [ADDRESS_191795] repeat pregnancies than those who decline postpartum contraception [ 6]. 
 
A 2015 sur vey of postpartum women about future pregnancy intention and 
contraception plans  found  the majority (n=237, 96.7%) of women did not desire 
pregnancy in the next year.   [7]  
 
Many  women have already ovulated and resumed sexual intercourse by 6 weeks 
postpartum [ 8] and upwards of 40% of women do not return for postpartum care. [9] 
The majority of providers wait until the six  week postpartum visit to initiate 
contraception— this delay  in contraceptive uptake puts women at risk of an unintended, 
short interval pregnancy.  An opportune time to facilitate contraception initiation is in the immediate postpartum period following delivery and prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345]. Providing women with contraception they need during this time is convenient and cost effective for the patient, provider, and health care system. [ 10] In the 2015 survey of 
postpartum women,  42.8% (n=107) indicated that if the implant or intrauterine device 
could be inserted before they left hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , they would choose these methods 
(p<0.0001). [ 7]  
 
A 2009 CDC study analyzed the prevalence and types of contraception used by 43,887 
women 2 -9 months postpartum and found that 88% reported use of at least one 
contraceptive method, with 61.7% using a highly effective method , defined as : <10% of 
women experience an unintended pregnancy; includes sterilization, intrauterine device, 
shot, pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382], patch, and ring. [ 11]  
 
This same study  demonstrated that women with no prenatal care had  the  lowest rates 
of using at least one method (76.9%) and had a low rate of using highly effective 
contraceptive methods (54.5%) . Based on these  data, the promotion of highly effective 
contraception, especially among women with no prenatal care , should be prioritized 
and immediate postpartum initiation  of a highly effective method  could be  the 
solution. [ 11]  
 
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the CDC have distinct recommendations 
with regard to  early administration of the contraceptive implant.  By [CONTACT_165397], the etonogestrel implant is classified as a 
Category 2 method for breastfeeding women at less than 1 month postpartum, 
indicating this is a method for which advantages generally outweigh any theoretical or 
proven risks. [1 2] However, the 5th edition of the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for 
Contraceptive use classifies the implant as category 2, indicating “generally use, some 
follow -up may be needed” for women breastfeeding at less than 1 month postpartum. 
[13] These slightly different recommendations may have an impact on the availability of 
progestin -only methods for women in the postpartum period. More information is 
needed on the impact of the implant on breastfeeding immediately postpartum in 
order to inform improvements in service del ivery and family planning interventions , 
both domestically and internationally .  
 
In addition to this, a  barrier to initiating progestin contraceptives in the early 
postpartum period is the concern of  interference with breastfeeding, specifically 
lactogene sis. A study looking at lactation consultants ’ knowledge about postpartum 
contraception and impact on breastfeeding documented disconnect between the 
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [LOCATION_002] Medical Eligibility Criteria for 
Contraceptive Use (US MEC) guidance and lactation consultants' knowledg e regarding 
the safety of immediate postpartum contraception. [ 14] Providing different 
recommendations amongst health care providers and lactation consultants may lead to 
confusion for patients —conflicting opi[INVESTIGATOR_165393] a method of contraception .  
 
Duva n et al.  (2010)  showed that if women are well -informed regarding the side effects 
of the contraceptive implant, women find that it is an acceptable form of reversible 
contraception in the postpartum period. [15] The pharmacokinetic profile of the 
etonogestrel implant shows a peak serum concentration of approximately 1,000 pg/mL 
on day 4 after insertion. Thus insertion immediately postpartum should not interfere 
with lactogene sis, as there would still be a drop in p rogesterone that would allow for 
lactation induction to occur  following delivery. [ 16], Appendix A  
 
The initiation of the contraceptive implant at 4 -8 weeks postpartum has been studied in 
breastfeeding women ; no change in volume or composition of breast milk was found. 
[17] A study looking at growth of breastfed infants found that a t three year follow up,  
child growth and development was no different between users of implant and copper 
intrauterine device (IUD) . [18] Additionally, Brito et al. (2009) documented no 
diminished weight gain in infants of women who were exclusively breastfeeding and 
obtained a contraceptive implant at 6 weeks postpartum. [ 19] The literature 
demonstrates immediate contraceptive implan t insertion does not alter volume of 
breast milk intake by [CONTACT_165398]. Braga et al. (2015) evaluated breast milk volume when 
the ENG implant was inserted immediately postpartum and found no difference in the 
median breast milk intake by [CONTACT_165399] n who were randomized to have 
the implant inserted within 48 hours after delivery and those who obtained no method 
of contraception. The study also documented similar weights of newborns between 
both groups at six weeks following delivery, adding to safety  data on effects of 
immediate insertion on breastfeeding. [ 20] 
 
Objectives and hypotheses:    
 This is a non -inferiority randomized controlled  trial:  
 
Our  objective is to determine whether time to lactogenesis stage II differs between 
immediate  delivery room insertion (0- 2 hours following delivery) and delayed  
postpartum insertion (24- 48 hours following delivery) of the contraceptive implant in 
the postpartum ward prior to medical discharge.  We hypothesize there will be no 
significant difference in time to  lactogenesis  stage II  between the two groups.  
 Design & Methodology:  
 This is a  non- inferiority  randomized control led trial.  
 Peripartum wome n with healthy, term newborns who plan to use  the contraceptive 
implant  (etonogestrel implant , Nexplanon ) for postpartum contraception  and 
intend to breastfeed  will be randomized  to receive:  
 
• Arm 1: Immediate delivery room insertion (0 -2 hour s following delivery)   
• Arm 2: postpartum room insertion ( 24-48 hours following  delivery ) 
 The primary outcome  is time to lactogenesis stage II (defined as the initiation of 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_165394]) as  documented by [CONTACT_165400] a validated tool.  
[21]   
 Secondary outcomes include breastfeeding continuation and exclusivity , contraceptive 
continuation, patient satisfactio n, pregnancy rates,  timing and number of follow up 
postpartum care  visits.  
 Data will be collected on time of exclusive breastfeeding  in days , supplementation 
rates, side effects  (irregular menstrual periods, changes in appetite, nausea , acne, 
headache)  continuation or change of contraceptive method , dates of follow up 
postpartum care visits,  subsequent pregnancies  and user satisfaction . These data will 
be collected in the week following insertion, at 4- [ADDRESS_191796] in the clinical setting  through chart review and 
provider referral.  We will also  use flyers placed on public announcement boards on 
campus and wh erever permitted in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  
 Study Procedures:   Eligible women will be  screened and  identified via chart review, in the pre-natal 
obstetric  clinic , and  labor and d elivery ward (L&D) at Stanford University  by [CONTACT_165401].   If patients meet criteria , the treating physician will initially approach and 
inform patients about the study. If a patient is interested, the treating physician will notify research staff and  the patient will be approached by [CONTACT_165402]. If a treating physician has identified a patient who may be eligible 
for study recruitment and physician confirms that patient agrees to be contact[CONTACT_54407] , we will call the patient and conduct a telephone screening interview (please see 
attached materials) and will recruit the patient in person at their next prenatal visit or when admitted to Labor and delivery, prior to  delivery.  
 Patients will be counseled about risks and benefits of contraceptive options  and will be 
counseled appropriately regarding risks and benefits of subdermal contraception implant, as well as the unknown effects of early progestin administration on breastfeeding. Patients will not be eligible for the study unless they have been consented for a postpartum contraceptive implant prior active labor . If the  patients 
meet inclusion criteria they will be invited to participate  in the study  and consent will be 
obtained. When a study patient is admitted to L&D , they will be  met by [CONTACT_165403] . Participants will be randomized 
through block randomization— allocation will be sealed in an opaque envelope. The 
patient, provider, and research staff will be aware of arm allocation, this is not a blinded 
study . At this time, b aseline data will be collected on patient age, gravidity, parity, 
breastfeeding experience on REDCap with a designated  Ipad .  
 
Trained providers will use standard protocol to place the contraceptive implant  either in 
deliv ery room or in postpartum ward after delivery. We will collect information on the 
timing of delivery and the time of implant insertion.   A card indicating date of insertion 
and expi[INVESTIGATOR_165395]. Participants will be monitored daily by [CONTACT_16133], in the first seven  days 
postpartum, or until lactogenesis reported,  beginning at 24 -hours following delivery , to 
determine  time to lactogenesis stage II using a valida ted tool.  [21] Patients will be 
asked: “H as your milk come in yet ?” and  “When did your milk come in?” I f the patient 
answers yes to first question the r esponse will be recorded to the nearest hour.  
Participants will be asked: “How many times have you tried to breas tfeed before your 
milk came in? Delayed lactation will be defined as no lactation by [ADDRESS_191797] feeding, supplementation rates, side effects, continuation or change of 
contraceptive use (including abstinence or withdrawal) , dates of postpartum medical 
visits, pregnancy, satisfaction with the contraceptive implant , resumption of vaginal 
intercourse, and  infant weight . Once the participant completes the [ADDRESS_191798] completed the study.   Criteria for selection of subjects:   Exclusion criteria :  
 
Contraindication to implant insertion such as history of breast cancer .  Hypersensitivity 
to any components of implant. Women who  are not English or Spanish speakers  or 
fluent in either language. Women who delivery infants that are not healthy.  
 Inclusion criteria:  
 
• Pregnant women who are patients  of the Stanfor d University Obstetrics service  
• Pregnant women who delivery a healthy infant, regardless of gestational age.  
• Intend to breastfeed  
• Desire the contraceptive implant as their method of contraception  
• Agree to be randomized to delivery room vs. postpartum ward insertion    
 Description of th e drugs & devices to be studied:  
Not applicable.  
 Follow up procedure : 
Participants will receive  brief  telephone follow -up, including an interview at  4-8 weeks, 
3, 6, and 12 months from date of delivery.  
 Criteria for discontinuation : 
Participants who experience complications during labor and delivery or whose infants have medical problems will be discontinued. Patients who change their mind about contraceptive implant use will be discontinued. Intention to treat analysis will be employ ed.  
 Lab and other investigations:  
Not applicable.  
 Data Management  
Data will be collected on R EDC ap software, will be coded, monitored, and verified.   
 Data Analysis  
SPSS  version 23 will be used for data analysis.  
 
Number of  subjects and statistical power:  
Based on p revious reports of  women with uncomplicated vaginal deliveries, mean time 
to lactogenesis  stage II  is [ADDRESS_191799] deviation of 12 hours. [ 21] If there is 
truly no difference between immediate insertio n and delayed insertion of the 
contraceptive implant on time to lactogenesis  stage II, then 68 patients are required to 
be 80% sure that the lower limit of a one- sided 95% confidence interval (or equivalently 
a 90% two -sided confidence interval) will be above the non -inferiority limit of a mean 
difference of 12 hours (alpha 5%; SD 18 ). Sealedenvelope.com was used to calculate 
sample size based on these parameters. A non -inferiority margin of [ADDRESS_191800] been to delay stage II lactogenesis by [CONTACT_8622] 12 hours. [2 2] To account for p otential participant dropout, 8 2 participants will 
be recruited .   
 Study limitations:  This is not a blinded study ; appropriate blinding would require the use of placebo 
implants  and additional procedures . We do not anticipate our inability to blind 
participants and providers to impact our primary outcome of time to lactogenesis  stage 
II.     Our recruitment will be limited to the Stanford Obstetrics and Gynecology service. 
Thus i nternal validity will not be a concern, but this clinic’s population is not 
representative of the diversity of the female population in the [LOCATION_002] or of 
women giving birth in the [LOCATION_002] .    
 
Based on this study’s inclusion and exclusion crite ria, results cannot be extrapolated to 
women with some medical conditions, complications, during labor and delivery, or who have infants with medical problems.   Duration of project:  
Project completion is expected  in 21  months. 9 months for recruitment, enrollment, 
and data collection, 12  months for follow up phone call, data analysis , and manuscript 
writing. Estimated Start and End  date:  September 2016 – June [ADDRESS_191801] management :  
Project will be coordinated, conducted, an d monitored by  [CONTACT_3647].  The research 
mentors will be: Kate Shaw M.D., M.S , primary mentor,  and , MPH, 
secondary mentor .  
 Links with other projects :  
Not applicable.  
 Main problems anticipated:  Our recruitment site sometimes experiences low patient volumes that may contribute to slow recruitment. It is possible that enrolled patients may experience complications during labor and delivery  or after delivery  in which case, patients will no longer be  
eligible for study. Patients may change their mind and no longer wish to participate in study. In order to mitigate these potential challenges, we will chart review in advance on a weekly basis in order to approach all eligible patients. We will also coun sel and 
explain study thoroughly to ensure patients are able to make informed decisions regarding participation.  
 Expected outcomes of the stud y and dissemination of findings:  

We expect to find that timing to lactogenesis stage II is  not different between  women 
who obtain contraceptive implant in sertion in the delivery room versus in the 
postpartum ward. We hope to publish these results to contribute to body of literature 
that examines safety of immediate postpartum contraception, allowing for better delivery of postpartum contraception without ne gative effects to breastfeeding in the 
period of 1 -2 hours after delivery.

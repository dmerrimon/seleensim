Protocol 
number: CDX011-04 
Title:  A Randomized Multicenter Pi[INVESTIGATOR_801170]-011 (CR011- vcMMAE) in 
Patients with Metastatic, GPNMB Over -Expressing, Triple- Negative Breast Cancer . 
Investigational Treatment:  CDX -011 (Glembatumumab Vedotin; CR011- vcMMAE) : a fully -human IgG
2 
monoclonal antibody (CR011) against GPNMB coupled to MMAE via a protease-
sensitive valine- citrulline peptide linker.   
Control 
Comparator:  Capecitabine: an orally administered systemic prodrug of 5’-deoxy-5-fluorouridine which is converted to 5-fluoroura cil.  
Indication:  Patients with metastatic, GPNMB over -expressing, triple- negative breast cancer, who 
have failed taxane therapy and who have received anthracycline therapy or for whom 
anthracycline therapy is not clinically indicated.  
Number of 
Patients:  Approximately 300 patients will be enrolled (randomized 2:1 to CDX -011 or 
capecitabine). 
Number of Study Centers: Approximately 100-175 study centers will participate.  
Objectives:  
 Primary:  
• To evaluate the anti- cancer activ ity of CDX-[ADDRESS_1105947] cancer as measured by [CONTACT_801197]- free survival (PFS)  
Secondary:  
• To further assess the anti -cancer activ ity of CDX- [ADDRESS_1105948] cancer, as assessed by [CONTACT_565596] 
(ORR), duration of response (DOR) and overall survival (OS)  
• To further characterize the safety of CDX -[ADDRESS_1105949] cancer  
• To obtain pharmacokinetic parameters and to explore the relationships between 
patient -specific measures of exposure and safety and activity parameters  
 Exploratory: 
• To assess whether treatment with CDX -011 is associated with improvement in 
quality of life and/or cancer -related pain as reflected by [CONTACT_801198]: This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735], open-label, prospectively controlled, randomized study of CDX-[ADDRESS_1105950] cancer.  Eligible 
patients will be randomized (2:1)  to receive CDX -011 or capecitabine.  Enrollment 
will be stratified as follows:  
• 0-1 prior line of chemotherapy for advanced disease vs. 2 prior line s of 
chemotherapy for advanced disease.  
• Progression- free interval ≤ 6 months after receipt of taxane therapy vs. 
progression- free interval > 6 months after receipt of taxane therapy  
• Received anthracycline therapy previously vs. no prior anthracycline therapy   
Study treatment, and associated stu dy visits at 3 week intervals, will continue until 
disease progression or intolerance. Tumor assessments will be performed at six week 
intervals for six months and nine  week intervals thereafter, until disease progression.

Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Upon discontinuation of study tr eatment, patients will be permitted to receive 
appropriate alternate anti -cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801171] -free 
survival (if progression is not yet documented) and overall survival. 
The study analyses of PFS, ORR , and DOR  will be based on tumor response 
assessments performed by [CONTACT_801199] 1.1 
guidelines ( Eisenhauer, Therasse et al. 2009 ) (Appendix 3 ). The investigator’s 
assessment of tumor response (according to RECIST 1.1) will guide clinical 
management and eligibility for continuation of study treatment.  
An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review cumulative data on an 
interim basi s. The interim data reviews may include but are not limited to summaries 
of adverse events, laboratory values and vital signs. The IDMC will conduct reviews 
approximately every [ADDRESS_1105951] randomized patient. If a safety concern is identified, the IDMC 
may recommend modifying, halting or permanently stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_747291].   
Study Treatment 
Dosing and 
Administration  CDX -011 will be administered on Day 1 of repeated 21 day cycles.  The starting CDX -
011 dose is 1.88 mg/kg, given as a 90- minute intravenous infusion using a 0.22 µ m in-
line filter .  Treatment will continue until progression or intolerance. 
Capecitabine wil l be orally administered on Days 1- 14 of repeated 21 day cycles.  The 
recommended capecitabine starting dose is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily (equivalent to 2500 
mg/m2 total daily dose)  per the package insert, and subsequent treatment will be 
dictated by [CONTACT_801200] .

Criteria for Evaluation Safety evaluations:  
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_363588], clinical laboratory tests, ECGs, 
physical examinations and the incidence and severity of adverse events  (graded 
according to CTCAE v 4.0.).  
Anti-tumor activity evaluations:  
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed via PFS, ORR, DOR  and OS.  Tumor response 
and progression will be defined by [CONTACT_79029], according to 
RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
Immunogenicity: 
Patients will be monitored for the development of anti -CDX -011 and anti -CR011 
antibodies, and whether these antibodies are neutralizing.    
Pharmacokinetics : 
July 28, 2015    Page 12 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
Concentration of the antibody -drug conjugate (ADC), total antibody (TA) and free 
MMAE will be determined using GLP compliant enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA ) and liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) 
methods.  Population PK analyses  will be performed  to obtain pharmacokinetic 
parameters and to explore the relationships between patient -specific measures of 
exposure and safety and activity parameters ; the influence of key  intrinsic factors , such 
as weight and gender , on variability in PK  will also be evaluated.  The i mpact  of 
circulating GPNMB levels on pharmacokinetic parameters may  also be examined.  
Pharmacodynamics: 
Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated via assessment of tumor tissue obtained via 
voluntary biopsy or re -resection.  Parameters evaluated may include localization of 
CDX -011, CR011 or MMAE at the tumor site and/or GPNMB expression levels in 
tumor tissue, as w ell evaluation of tumor infiltrating leukocytes. Soluble GPNMB 
levels in the circulation may also be examined.  
Statistical 
Methods The primary efficacy analysis will be performed in accordance with the intention -to-
treat principle.  All randomized patient s will be included in the primary efficacy 
analysis according to their assigned study treatment, irrespective of the actual treatment 
received.  The primary analysis of safety will include all patients who receive at least 
[ADDRESS_1105955] 1.1 crit eria (Eisenhauer, Therasse et al. 2009 ).  Patients whom enter hospi[INVESTIGATOR_209934], or other such similar  end-of-life care, without prior objective evidence of disease 
progression will be considered to have disease progression for purposes of the primary analysis of PFS.  Unless specified otherwise,  all recorded PFS events will be included 
in the primary analysis regardless of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801174]
. Patients who 
initiate alternate anticancer therapy in the absence of documented progression will be 
censored at the latest disease assessment prior  to initiation of such therapy.  Patients 
who were last known to be alive and progression- free will be censored at the latest 
disease assessment.  Patients with no baseline or post- baseline disease assessments will 
be censored at the randomization date unl ess death occurred prior to the first planned 
assessment (in which case the death will be considered a PFS event).  A secondary 
analysis of PFS will be performed based on PFS events determined by [CONTACT_111871].  Sensitivity analyses will be perfor med to assess the impact of the 
different censoring mechanisms and deviations from the planned schedule of disease 
assessments.  PFS will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method.  
The primary inferential comparison between treatment arms will use the log -rank test 
stratified by [CONTACT_94487].  The hazard ratio for treatment 
will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
For patients with metastatic advanced GPNMB -expressing breast cancer in the 
treatment setting under investigation, median PFS of 4 months is anticipated following 
randomization to capecitabine.  It is hypothesized that CDX-011 will increase median PFS in such patients by 2.25 months (i.e., 4.0  vs 6.25 months).  Under the assumption 
of proportional hazards, such an increase corresponds to a hypothesized hazard ratio 
of 0.64.   
If this hypothesized hazard ratio is true, 203 PFS events (total of two arms) determined 
by [CONTACT_801202] 85% power w ith 2-sided type I error of 0.05. Under the assumption

of exponential distribution for each arm and uniform enrollment over 2 years , and 10% 
drop out rate (PFS events cannot be observed), 300 patients (200 in the CDX -011 arm 
and 100 in the capecitabine arm ) are needed, and it is anticipated that [ADDRESS_1105956] overall response of complete or partial 
response (CR or PR) according to RECIST 1.1.  Inferential comparisons between 
treatment arms will be made using the Cochran -Mantel Haenszel chi -square test, 
stratified by [CONTACT_94487].  
The duration of objective response will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -
Meier method.

Table 1 - Footnotes:  
1. A delay in study treatment or performance of study visits due to holidays, weekends, inclement weather or other unforeseen circumstances will be permitted and not considered 
a protocol violation. However, significant delays (i.e., greater than one week)  should be discussed with the study medical monitor to reach consensus on subsequent scheduling.  
2. No study procedures will be performed prior to receipt of signed Informed Consent. However, assessments performed according to standard of care prior to receipt of Informed 
Consent may be utilized to fulfill the screening requirement, if completed within the required window for screening.  
3. Patients will receive CDX -011 or capecitabine (on a three -week cycle) until intolerance or progression of disease.  
4. Disease assessments will be performed every six weeks (+/ - 1 week) for six months (i.e., weeks 6, 12, 18, 24), every 9 weeks (+/ - 2 weeks) thereafter (i.e., weeks 33, 4 2, 51, 
60, 69,  78, etc.), until progression.  Patients who discontinue study treatment without documented progression of disease as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1105959] Disease 
Assessment Visits until such criteria are met  (regardless of intervening therapy) . In the event that follow -up is discontinued without  a final disease assessment doc umenting  
objective disease progression, the reason must be supplied; in particular, any admittance to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801175]-of -life care must be reported .  If a partial or 
complete response is noted, a follow -up radiographic assessment must  be done no sooner than 28 days later to confirm response. If surgical intervention or localized radiation 
become indicated (either for palliation or down-staging of previously non-resectable tumor), these interventions should be avoided if clinically feasible until after the 12 week 
response assessment. Prior to any intervention (such as surgical resection, palliative radiation or alternate anti -cancer therapy), every effort should be made to perform a tumor 
response assessment in order to document progression and/or confirm an objective response. Patients who undergo surgical resection or radiation in the absence of progression 
may continue to receive study treatment until remaining lesions meet criteria for progression of disease.  
5. Subsequent to the End of Tre atment Visit, all patients will be followed at 12 (±2) week intervals until study closure. These visits may be performed by [CONTACT_756].  However, f or 
patients who discontinue study treatment in the absence of progression, s urvival assessments may be combined with Disease Assessment Visits, and conducted every 6 (±1) or  
9 (±2) weeks until progression, and then at 12 (±2) week intervals until study closure .   
6. The End of Treatment Visit should be performed within [ADDRESS_1105960] dose of study treatment and prior to initiation of a lternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
7. Assessments do not need to be repeated if completed within the previous 24 hours as part of the screening asse ssment.   
8. Assessment of GPNMB expression  (by [CONTACT_4658]) will be performed at a central laboratory . Additional analyses to be performed centrally may also include GPNMB expression by 
[CONTACT_937]-PCR, examination of tumor markers using IHC or other molecular analyses , evalu ation of tumor infiltrating leukocyte populations , biomarkers related to immune activation, 
and localization of CDX -011, CR011 , or MMAE at the tumor site. Sample collection, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_801176].   
9. Tumor specimen(s) submitted for screening must have been obtained in the setting of advanced disease.  Submission of additional samples from other collection dates, when 
available, is encouraged.  Tissue may be submitted and tested at any time prior to or during the 28 -day window for screening, provided that the patient has signed an appropriate 
consent (either a tumor tissue -specific consent or full study consent).  
10. In the event of a repeat resection or biopsy during treatment or following progression, submission of tissue sample for central analysis is strongly encouraged. 
11. Determination of triple -negative status will be done at a local laboratory.  Tumor sample(s) used to determine eligibility must be obtained in the setting of advanced disease.   
Laborator y reports will be required to provide quantitative results of sufficient detail to verify eligibility for all patients enrolled (see study entry criteria).  
12. Medical history includes demography, race, ethnicity, history of breast cancer, previous therapy, an d pre-existing diseases. At Cycle 1, Day 1, medical history is updated with 
any adverse events occurring prior to administration of study drug.  
13. Complete physical exam should be performed at screening; thereafter, symptom -directed exams are acceptable.

14. Vital signs to include height (at screening only), weight, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], pulse, temperature, and resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure. For patients receiving CDX -011, vital 
signs should be assessed pre-infusion, at 45 (±15) minutes during the infusion, and within one -half hour following completion of the infusion.  (Note: weight is only assessed 
once per visit.)   For patients receiving capecitabine, vital signs should be assessed once at the indicated visits.  
15. A second original copy of the ECG tracing should be retained for possible submission to Celldex.   
16. Serum or urine pregnancy test only for women of childbearing potential. Patients of non-childbearing potential include those who are ≥ [ADDRESS_1105961] 1 year. However, women <[ADDRESS_1105962] unless additional evidence 
(oophorectomy or serial measurement of FSH and/or estradiol) are available to ensure postmenopausal status.

18. Analyses will be performed by [CONTACT_801203]. Sample collection, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_801177].   
19. Samples drawn only for patients receiving CDX -011.  On CDX -011 dosing days, samples are collected prior to dosing.  
20. Samples for pharmacokinetic analyses  will be collected for CDX -011-treated patients only.   Analysis may also include circulating GPNMB  or other soluble mediators .  At each 
CDX -011 dosing day, samples will be collected prior to dosing and at end of infusion (at or within 15 minutes of completion of infusion) .    
21. PBMC collection will occur for up to  150 patients  enrolled at a subset of  study centers in the [LOCATION_002]  (regardless of treatment arm) . On CDX -011 dosing days, samples 
are collected prior to dosing.  Analysis will include examination of GPNMB expression on myeloid suppressor cells. Celldex will notify the sites when the requisite number of 
patients providing PBMC samples has been reached or that further data is not needed.  
22. Blood sample will be stored for retrospective BRCA1/2 mutation status  and other potentially relevant molecular markers .  
23. EORTC QLQ -C30 Questionnaire  (Appendix 6) completed only for patients who are fluent in a language in which the questionnaire is validated (information will be provided 
by [CONTACT_801204]) .  Each questionnaire must be completed by [CONTACT_801205]. It should be completed without assistance if 
possible. If the patient requires assistance to complete the questionnaire, the assistance should be provided by [CONTACT_801206], and the nature of required assistance should be documented.  If a scheduled questionnaire is missed, the patient should complete the questionnaire a t the next study visit 
24. Imaging -based evaluation per RECIST 1.1 should be performed in accordance with the Site  Manual provided by C elldex (or designee).  C ontrast -enhanced CT of the chest, 
abdomen, and pelvis, as well as all other suspected disease sites is required. MRI exams of the brain, abdomen, and pelvis can be performed in lieu of a CT; however MRI 
exams of the chest are not recommended.  In the event that a chest MRI is performed, a non -contrast chest CT is strongly recommended to evaluate the lung parenchyma. Brain 
and/or bone scans are required for any patients with a history of metastases to bone and/or brain or where symptomatology raises the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_801178]/or brain metastases. Lesions identified on bone scans should be confirmed by a CT or MRI at baseline, and, if identified as target lesions due to soft tissue component, they should continue to be

followed by [CONTACT_153262] (i.e., CT or MRI scan). However, bone lesions followed as non -target disease may be subsequently followed by [CONTACT_801207].  Lesions 
that cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_801208] a ruler (preferred method) or measured with calipers . Normally, 
all target and non -target disease sites should be evaluated at each assessment. However, for patients with non-target bone disease, bone scans need only be repeated every twelve 
weeks.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Target 
lesions selected for tumor measurements should be those where surgical resection or radiation a re not indicated or anticipated.  
25. Randomization may be performed up to [ADDRESS_1105963] been met.  
26. Unless otherwise specified, all study assessments should be performed prior to administration of study treatment, and may be performed up to 24 hours prior to treatment 
administration if assessments remain within the specified visit window .  
27. All concomitant medication will be documented in the CRF if taken within 28 days prior to Study Day 1, and either (whichever occurs sooner): a) [ADDRESS_1105964] dose of 
study treatment or b) initiation of alternate anti-cancer therapy. In addition, all anti -cancer medications and concomitant medications required to treat CDX- 011-related SAEs  
taken throughout the duration of study follow -up should also be recorded.  
28. For patients who develop grade 3 rash possibly related to CDX -011 and who provide appropriate consent, punch biopsies and photographs of the rash site, as well as  uninvolved 
skin, are strongly encouraged.  Samples may be submitted for central analyses including quantification of GPNMB expression; in these cases, collection, processing and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_801176].   
29. Adverse event monitoring  on Cycle 1 Day 7 and Cycle 1 Day 14 can be performed in person or by [CONTACT_801209].

Secondary  objectives are :  
• To further assess the anti -cancer activity of CDX -[ADDRESS_1105966] cancer, as assessed by [CONTACT_565596] (ORR), duration of 
response (DOR) and overall survival (OS). 
• To further characterize the safety of CDX -[ADDRESS_1105967] cancer . 
• To obtain pharmacokinetic parameters and to explore the relationships between patient -
specific measures of exposure and safety and activity parameters  
An exploratory obje ctive is:  
• To assess whether treatment with CDX -011 is associated with improvement in quality of life 
and/or cancer -related pain as reflected by [CONTACT_801210].  
7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1. Overall Design and Plan of the Study  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] , open-label, prospectively controlled, randomized study of CDX -[ADDRESS_1105968] cancer.  Eligible patients will be 
randomized (2 :1) to receive CDX -011 or capecitabine . Enrollment will be stratified as follows:  
• 0-1 prior line of chemotherapy for advanced disease vs. 2 prior line s of chemotherapy for 
advanced disease  
July 28, 2015    Page 26 of 86 

Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
• Progression- free interval ≤ 6 months after receipt of taxane therapy vs. progression- free 
interval > 6 months after receipt of taxane therapy  
• Received anthracycline therapy previously vs. no prior anthracycline therapy  
 Study treatment, and associated study visits at 3 week intervals, will continue until disease 
progression or intolerance. Tumor assessments will be performed at six week interva ls for six 
months and nine week intervals thereafter, until disease progression.  Upon discontinuation of 
study treatment, patients will be permitted to receive appropriate alternate anti- cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_801179]- free survival (if progression is not yet documented) and 
overall survival. 
The study analyses of PFS , ORR and DOR will be based on tumor response assessments performed 
by [CONTACT_801199] 1.1 guidelines ( Eisenhauer, Therasse 
et al. 2009 ) (Appendix 3 ). The investigator’s assessment of tumor response (according to RECIST 
1.1) will guide clinical management and eligibility for continuation of study treatment.  
An independent data monitoring committee will review cumulative data on an interim basis. The 
interim data reviews may include but are not limited to summaries of adverse events, laboratory values and vital signs. The IDMC will conduct reviews approximately every [ADDRESS_1105969] randomized patient. If a safety 
concern is identified, the IDMC may recommend modifying, halting or permanently stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801180].

(e.g., condom plus spermicide in combination with a female condom, diaphragm, cer vical cap, 
contraceptive sponge  or vaginal ring), intra -uterine device (IUD), implants, injectables, 
combined oral contraceptives, sexual abstinence (total abstinence from sexual intercourse as the preferred lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable), or sexual intercourse with only a vasectomized partner.  Patients and/or partners who are surgically sterile or postmenopausal are exempt from this requirement.  
10. Previously received capecitabine and discontinued due to progressive disease or intolerance; previously received CDX-011(CR011- vcMMAE;  glembatumumab vedotin ) or other MMAE -
containing agents. [criterion deleted]  
11. Active systemic infection requiring treatment. Infection controlled by [CONTACT_801201].  Note: microscopic examination of urinalysis is required during screening.  If urinary infection is suspected, then a negative urine culture is required prior to enrollment.  
[criterion deleted]  
12. Chronic use of systemic corticosteroid above the physiologic dose (5 mg per day prednisone or equivalent) within 7 days of enrollment, except for premedication. [criterion deleted]   
13. Significant cardiovascular disease including unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled hypertension, and congestive heart failure ([LOCATION_001] Heart Association class 3 or 4), a history of a serious uncontrollable arrhythmia despi[INVESTIGATOR_2391], ischemic or severe valvular heart disease, or a myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to the trial entry. 
14. Any underlying medical condition that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], will make the 
administration of study treatment (CDX -011 or capecitabine) hazardous to the patient, or 
would obscure the interpretation of adverse events.  
15. Other  malignancy except for adequately treated and cured basal or squamous cell skin cance r, 
curatively treated in situ disease, or any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for ≥ 5 years.  
7.2.3. Measures to Minimize Bias  
This is a randomized, controlled, open- label study.  In an effort to minimize bias in the 
interpretation of tumor response and progression -free survival, these analyses will be based on 
tumor response assessments performed by [CONTACT_52880], independent review committee according to standardized, objective response criteria (RECIST 1.1), blinded to treatment allocation and investigator  assessments.   
July 28, [ADDRESS_1105973] each patient 
complete the study.  As this study utilizes an Intent- to-Treat analysis, there will be no replacement 
of randomized patients.   
An explanation will be recorded for each patient taken off study treatment or discontinuing the 
study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation of Study Treatment  
Reasons for discontinuation of study treatment include:  
• Progressive disease, as assessed by [CONTACT_801212] 1.1 
criteria ( Appendix 3 ); 
• Symptomatic deterioration (clinical progression); 
• Note:  This category is applicable to patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment.  However, per RECIST 1.1 (See Appendix 3 ), 
symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response; it is a reason for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. Thus, every effort should be made to continue disease assessments per protocol until documented objective progression, regardless of any changes in therapy .   
• Receipt of alternate anti -cancer treatments; 
• Withdrawal r equest by  [CONTACT_12718]’s legal representative;  
• Note: Withdrawal of consent for continued treatment should be differentiated from 
withdrawal of consent for study follow -up, and every effort should be made within the 
bounds of safety and patient choice to have each patient complete the study follow -up.  
• Adverse Event, including the development of dose limiting toxicity (See Section 8.1.6);  
• Physician Decision ; 
• Non-compliance of the patient; 
• Pregnancy;  
• Death, otherwise not explainable by [CONTACT_801213]; 
• Patient lost to follow -up. (See below.)  
Patients who discontinue CDX -[ADDRESS_1105974] 1.1 should continue 
Disease Assessment Visits until criteria for disease progression are met.  ( SeeTable 1 .) 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Discontinuation from Study  
Reasons for patient removal from the study include:  
• Withdrawal request by [CONTACT_12718]’s legal representative (withdrawal of consent for the study follow-up); 
• Patient lost to follow -up. A subject should be consider ed lost to follow up only after multiple 
efforts have been made to contact [CONTACT_801214]/her health status after failure of the 
subject to attend scheduled visits.  If after [ADDRESS_1105975], a certified letter should be sent to his/her home for 
immediate response.  If there is still no response, the subject is to be considered lost to follow 
July 28, [ADDRESS_1105976] to follow up should be noted in the source do cuments 
along with the phone contacts and the returned certified mail (if sent back). 
7.2.5. Completion of Study  
It is anticipated that the enrollment period will be approximately [ADDRESS_1105977] to survival until death, discontinuation from study follow -up, or 
termination/completion of study.  Patients who die or complete the study follow -up through study 
closure will be considered to have “completed” the study.  The study will be declared complete 
when sufficient data is obtained to conclude the study.   
Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, drug 
safety issues, or at the discretion of Celldex. In addition, Celldex retains the right to discontinue 
development of CDX-011 at any time.

 Capecitabine  
8.2.1. Description, Packaging, Labeling, Accountability  and Storage 
Capecitabine will be obtained from commercial supply and handled/stored in a fashion consistent with package insert and institutional policies .  Generic capecitabine may be utilized. The following 
sections are based  on package insert recommendations  (Feb 2011) .  However, investigators are 
responsible for referencing the complete and most current package insert for full g uidance 
regarding potential toxicity and dosing of capecitabine.   
Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine carbamate with antineoplastic activity. It is an orally 
administered systemic prodrug of 5’ -deoxy-5- fluorouridine (5’ -DFUR) which is converted to 5-
fluorouracil.  Capecitabine is supplied as biconvex, oblong film -coated tablets for oral administration.  Each 
light peach -colored tablet contains 150 mg of capecitabine and each peach- colored tablet contains 
500 mg of capecitabine.   The inactive ingredients in capecit abine include: anhydrous lactose, 
croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium 
stearate and purified water. The peach or light peach film coating contains hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, talc, titanium dioxide,  and synthetic yellow and red iron oxides. 
8.2.2. Compliance  
Compliance with self -administered oral agents (i .e., capecitabine) will be assessed by [CONTACT_64477] .

Dosing and Administration  
Investigators are encouraged to follow the recommended dosing from the Capecitabine Package 
Insert  and NCCN  Guidelines ( available on -line at www.nccn.org) , as well as institutional standard. 
The recommended starting dose of capecitabine per the package insert is 1250 mg/m2 administered 
orally twice daily (morning and evening; equivalent to 2500 mg/m2 total daily dose) for [ADDRESS_1105978] period, given as 3- week cycles.  Subse quent treatment will be dictated 
by [CONTACT_801200] , with consideration to the guidance below . 
In patients with moderate renal impairment (baseline creatinine clearance = 40 to 50 mL/min 
[Cockroft and Gault ; Appendix 5 ]), a dose reduction to 75% of the capecitabine starting dose 
(from 1250 mg/m2 to 950 mg/m2 twice daily) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment is 
recommended as outlined in Table 6.  No adjustment to the starting dose of capecitabine is 
recommended in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance = 51 to 80 mL/min).  
Capecitabine tablets should be swallowed w hole with water within 30 minutes after a meal.  
8.2.4. Dose Modifications 
Capecitabine dosage may need to be individualized to optimize patient management. Patients 
should be carefully monitored for toxicity and doses of capecitabine should be promptly modified 
as necessary to accommodate individual patient tolerance to treatment.  Toxicity due to capecitabine administration may be managed by [CONTACT_188192], dose interruptions and 
adjustment of capecitabine dose. Once the dose has been reduced, it  should not be increased at a 
later time. Doses of capecitabine omitted for toxicity are not replaced or restored; instead the 
patient should resume the planned treatment cycles. 
Management of capecitabine toxicity, dosing, dose reductions  and supportive care should be 
consistent with the package insert recommendations, but should be dictated by  [CONTACT_801215].  Table 6 outlines

8.2.5. Potential Toxicity and Management of Toxicity 
Management of toxicity associated with the administration of capecitabine is  discussed below. 
Investigators should always refer to the current capecitabine package insert for further 
information and current guidance. 
The most common side effects of capecitabine are:  
• Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, abdominal pain, upset stomach, constipation, loss of 
appetite, and dehydration.  These side effects are more common in patients age 80 and older. 
• Hand-and-foot syndrome (palms of the hands or soles of the feet tingle, become numb, painful, 
swollen or red), rash, dry, itchy or discolored skin, nail problems, and hair loss 
• Tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, fever, pain (including chest, back, joint, and muscle 
pain), trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and taste problems  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Diarrhea  
Capecitabine can induce diarrhea, sometimes severe. Patients with severe diarrhea should be 
carefully monitored and given fluid and electrolyte replacement if they become dehydrated. In [ADDRESS_1105982] occ urrence of grade 2  to 4 diarrhea was 34 days (range from 1 to 369 days). 
The median duration of grade 3 to 4 diarrhea was 5 days.  
July 28, 2015    Page 40 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
National Cancer Institute of Canada (NCIC) grade 2 diarrhea is defined as an increase of 4 to 6 
stools/day or nocturnal stools, grade 3 diarrhea as an increase of 7 to 9 stools/day or incontinence and malabsorption, and grade 4 diarrhea as an increase of ≥10 stools/day or grossly bloody diarrhea or the need for parenteral support. 
If grade 2, [ADDRESS_1105983] antidiarrheal treatments (e.g. , loperamide) are recommended.  
Necrotizing enterocolitis (typhlitis) has been reported. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Nausea/Vomiting 
Patients experiencing ≥grade 2 nausea (food intake significantly decreased but able to eat 
intermitten tly) and/or ≥ grade 2 vomiting (2 to 5 epi[INVESTIGATOR_11630] a 24- hour period) should be instructed 
to stop taking capecitabine immediately. Initiation of symptomatic treatment is recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Cardiotoxicity 
The cardiotoxicity observed with capecitabine includes myocardial infarction/ischemia, angina, 
dysrhythmias, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, sudden death, electrocardiographic changes, and cardiomyopathy. These adverse reactions may be more common in patients with a prior history of coronary artery disease.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hand-and-Foot Syndrome 
Hand -and-foot syndrome (palmar -plantar erythrodysesthesia or chemotherapy -induced acral 
erythema) is a cutaneous toxicity. Median time to onset was 79 days (range from 11 to 360 days) with a severity range of grades 1 to 3 f or patients receiving capecitabine monotherapy in the 
metastatic setting.  
Grade 1 is characterized by [CONTACT_39132]: numbness, dysesthesia/paresthesia, tingling, painless swelling or erythema of the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort which does not disrupt normal activities. Grade 2 hand- and-foot syndrome is defined as painful erythema and swelling of 
the hands and/or feet and/or discomfort affecting the patient’s activities of daily living. Grade [ADDRESS_1105984] desquamation, ulceration, blistering or severe pain of 
the hands and/or feet and/or severe discomfort that causes the patient to be unable to work or perform activities of daily living.  
If grade 2 or 3 hand -and- foot syndrome occurs, administration of capecitabi ne should be 
interrupted until the event resolves or decreases in intensity to grade 1. Following grade 3 hand-and-foot syndrome, subsequent doses of capecitabine should be decreased.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Stomatitis  
Patients experiencing grade 2 stomatitis (painful erythema,  edema or ulcers of the mouth or tongue, 
but able to eat) or greater should be instructed to stop taking capecitabine immediately. Initiation 
of symptomatic treatment is recommended.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Fever and Neutropenia  
Patients who develop a fever of 100.5°F or greater or other evidence of potential infection should be instructed to call their physician.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Hyperbilirubinemia  
In [ADDRESS_1105985] one dose of 
capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 twice daily as monotherap y for [ADDRESS_1105986] 
period, grade 3 (1.5- [ADDRESS_1105987]) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 15.2% (n=133) of patients and grade 
4 (>[ADDRESS_1105988]) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 3.9% (n=34) of patients. Of 566 patients who had hepatic metastases at baseline and 309 patients without hepatic metastases at baseline, grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 22.8% and 12.3%, respectively. Of the 167 patients with grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia, 18.6% (n=31) also had post -baseline elevations (grades 1 to 4, without 
elevations at baseline) in alkaline phosphatase and 27.5% (n=46) had post -baseline elevations in 
transaminases at any time (not necessarily concurrent). The majority of these patients, 64.5% (n=20) and 71.7% (n=33), had liver metastases at baseline. In addition, 57.5% (n=96) and 35.3% (n=59) of the 167 patients had elevations (grades 1 to 4) at both pre -baseline and post -baseline in 
alkaline phosphatase or transaminases, respectively. Only 7.8% (n=13) and 3.0% (n=5) had grade [ADDRESS_1105989] -line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, 
the incidence of grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia was similar to the overall clinical trial safety 
database of capecitabine monotherapy. The median time to onset for grade 3 or 4 
hyperbilirubinemia in the colorectal cancer population was 64 days and median total bilirubin increased from 8 µm/L at baseline to 13 µm/L during treatment with capecitabine. Of the [ADDRESS_1105990] cancer who received a combination of capecitabine and 
docetaxel, grade 3 (1.[ADDRESS_1105991]) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 7% (n=17) and grade 4 (>[ADDRESS_1105992]) hyperbilirubinemia occurred in 2% (n=5).  
If drug -related grade 3 to 4 elevations in bilirubin occur, administration of capecitabine should be 
immediately interrupted until the hyperbilirubinemia decreases to ≤3.[ADDRESS_1105993].  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hematologic 
In [ADDRESS_1105994] or colorectal cancer who received a dose of 1250 mg/m
[ADDRESS_1105995] period, 
3.2%, 1.7%, and 2.4% of patients had grade [ADDRESS_1105996] cancer who received a dose of capecitabine in combination with docetaxel, 68% had grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 2.8% had grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, and 9.6% had grade 3 or 4 anemia.  
Patients with baseline neutrophil counts of <  1.5 x 10
9/L and/or thrombocyte count s of <  100 x 
109/L should not be treated with capecitabine. If unscheduled laboratory assessments during a 
treatment cycle show grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity, treatment with capecitabine should be 
interrupted. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drug -drug interactions  
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Anticoagulants 
Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding have been reported in patients taking capecitabine  
concomitantly with coumarin -derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and phenprocoumon. 
These events occurred within several days and up to several months a fter initiating capecitabine  
therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_397681]. These events occurred in 
July 28, 2015    Page 42 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
patients with and without liver metastases. In a drug interaction study with single -dose warfarin 
administration, there was a sig nificant increase in the mean AUC of S -warfarin. The maximum 
observed INR value increased by 91%. This interaction is probably due to an inhibition of 
cytochrome P450 2C9 by [CONTACT_397787]/or its metabolites. 
Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin- derivative anticoagulant therapy 
should have their anticoagulant response (INR or prothrombin time) monitored closely with great 
frequency and the anticoagulant dose should be adjusted accordingly.   
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Phenytoin (Dilantin®) 
The level of phenytoin should be carefully monitored in patients taking capecitabine and phenytoin 
dose may need  to be reduced . Post- marketing reports indicate that some patients  receiving 
capecitabine and phenytoin had toxicity associated with elevated phenytoin levels. Formal drug -
drug interaction studies with phenytoin have not been conducted, but the mechanism of interaction 
is presumed to be inhibition of the CYP2C9 isoenzyme by [CONTACT_397787]/or its metabolites.  [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1105997] been reported in elderly patients 
receiving weekly  leucovorin and fluorouracil. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_1105998] been conducted. Care should be exercised when capecitabine is 
coadministered with CYP2C9 substrates. 
8.2.6. Additional Warnings and Precautions  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Drug -Food Interaction 
Food was shown to reduce both the rate and extent of absorption of capecitabine.  In all clinical 
trials, patients were instructed to administer capecitabine within 30 minutes after a meal. It is 
recommended that capecitabine be administered with food. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dihydropyrimidine Dehydrogenase Deficiency  
Rarely, unexpected, severe toxicity (e.g., stomatitis, diarrhea, neutropenia and neurotoxicity) 
associated with 5 -fluorouracil has been attributed to a deficiency of dihydropyrimidine 
dehydrogenase (DPD) activity.   A link between decreased levels of DPD and increased, potentially 
fatal toxic effects of 5 -fluorouracil therefore cannot be excluded.  Patients with DPD deficiency are 
not eligible for this trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Renal Insufficiency  
Patients with moderate (creatinine clearance = 30 to 50 mL/min) and severe (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) renal impairment showed higher exposure for capecitabine, 5- FDUR, and FBAL 
than in those with normal renal function.  Patients with moderate renal impairment at baseline require dose reduction (see Section 8.2.2).  Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment at 
baseline should be carefully monitored for adverse  reactions. Prompt interruption of therapy with 
subsequent dose adjustments is recommended if a patient  develops a grade 2 to 4 adverse event as 
outlined in Table 6.  
July 28, 2015    Page 43 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Hepatic Insufficiency  
Patients with mild to moderate hepatic dysfunction due to liver metastases should be carefully 
monitored when capecitabine is administered. The effect of severe hepatic dysfuncti on on the 
disposition of capecitabine is not known. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Geriatric Patients  
Patients ≥[ADDRESS_1105999] or colorectal cancer who received capecitabine monotherapy, 
62% of the 21 patients ≥ 80 years of age treated with capecitabine  experienced a treatment -related 
grade 3 or 4 adverse event: diarrhea in 6 (28.6%), nausea in 3 (14.3%), hand- and-foot syndrome 
in 3 (14.3%), and vomiting in 2 (9.5%) patients. Among the 10 patients 70 years of age and greater 
(no patients were >80 years of age) treated with capecitabine  in combination with docetaxel, 30% 
(3 out of 10) of patients experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea and stomatitis, and 40% (4 out of 10) 
experienced  grade 3 hand -and-foot syndrome. 
Among the 67 patients ≥ [ADDRESS_1106000] two treatment cycles was higher than in 
the <60 years of age patient group. 
In 995 patients receiving capecitabine as adjuvant therapy for Dukes’ C colon cancer after 
resection of the  primary tumor, 41% of the 398 patients ≥ 65 years of age treated with capecitabine  
experienced a treatment -related  grade 3 or 4 adverse event: hand -and-foot syndrome in 75 (18.8%), 
diarrhea in 52 (13.1%), stom atitis in 12  (3.0%), neutropenia/granulocytopenia in 11 (2.8%), 
vomiting in 6 (1.5%), and nausea in 5 (1.3%) patients. In patients ≥65 years of age (all randomized 
population; capecitabine 188 patients, 5- FU/LV 208 patients) treated  for Dukes’ C colon canc er 
after resection of the primary tumor, the hazard ratios for disease -free survival and overall survival 
for capecitabine compared to 5- FU/LV were 1.01 (95% C.I. 0.80 – 1.27) and 1.04 (95% C.I. 0.79 
– 1.37), respectively. Physicians should exercise cautio n in monitoring the effects of capecitabine in the elderly. 
Insufficient data are available to provide a dosage recommendation.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pregnancy/Nursing Mothers  
Capecitabine may cause fetal harm  when given to a pregnant woman, and it is not known whether 
this drug is excreted in human milk. Pregnant and nursing mothers are not eligible for participation 
in this study.  Women of childbearing potential and their partners who are admitted to the cli nical 
study must take adequate contraceptive measures.   
9.  CONCOMITANT THERAPY 
While on study, when clinically appropriate, patients should strictly follow the study -prescribed 
treatment regimen.  Therefore, patients should not receive additional investigational agents or anti -
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], unless recurrence/progression of diseas e warrants discontinuation of study 
treatment and commencement of alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
The effect of CDX -011 on the absorption, metabolism, or excretion of other drugs has not been 
studied.  Drugs known to strongly inhibit CYP3A4 should be used with cauti on, and drugs known 
July 28, 2015    Page 44 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
to be potent CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided, if at all possible, while patients are exposed to 
CDX-011 (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   Drug -drug interactions of concern for capecitabine include 
anticoagulants, phenytoin, leucovorin, and CYP2C9 substrates.  See Section [IP_ADDRESS] for further 
information.   
Prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids above the physiologic dose ( 5 mg prednisone or 
equivalent) should be avoided during the study. Subjects may continue to use any ongoing medications not prohibited by [CONTACT_26141]/exclusion 
criteria.  During study treatment, patients may receive supportive care to include bisphosphonates, hematologic and anti -infectious support and pain management. Antiemetics and steroids for 
chemotherapy premedication are also permitted. Growth factor support is permitted and should be administered with consideration to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline on the use of hematopoietic colony -stimulating factors ( Smith, Khatcheressian et al. 2006
).  Efforts 
should be made to maintain stable doses of concomitant medications during the course of treatment with CDX-011. 
If surgical intervention or localized radiation become indicated (either for palliation or down-staging of previously non- resectable tumor), these interventions are permitted, but should be 
avoided if clinically feasible until after the 12 week response assessment. A tumor response assessment should be conducted prior to any intervention, in order to document progression and/or 
confirm an objective response.  Patients who undergo surgical resection or radiation in the absence of progression may continue to receive study treatment unti l remaining lesions meet criteria for 
progression of disease. 
All concomitant medication will be documented in the CRF  if taken within 28 days prior to 
randomization, and either (whichever occurs sooner): a) [ADDRESS_1106001] dose of study treatment 
(either CDX -011 or capecitabine chemotherapy), or b) initiation of alternate anti- cancer therapy.  
All anti- cancer medications taken throughout the duration of  study follow -up (including the 
initiation of anti- cancer medications representing the reason for discontinuation of treatment or 
study) should also be recorded, as should concomitant medications required to treat CDX-011-related SAEs.  
10. STUDY PROCEDURES  
10.1. Schedule of Investigations and Data Collection 
The study is divided into phases with associated evaluations and procedures that must be performed at specific time points, as described in the following sections. The Study Assessment Schedule ( Table 1 ) summa rizes the frequency and timing of various activity, safety, and other 
measurements.  
10.1.1. Screening Period  
Prior to the performance of any study -specific procedures, the patient will have the nature of the 
study explained to them, and will be asked to give written informed consent and, if applicable,  
HIPAA authorization. Informed consent/HIPAA authorization must be obtained prior to any study- specific procedures that do not form a part of the patient’s normal care. However, 
assessments performed according to standard of care prior to receipt of informed consent may be utilized to fulfill the screening requirement, if completed within the required window for screening. 
July 28, 2015    Page 45 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
The assessments outlined for the Screening Visit in the Study Assessment Schedule ( Table 1 ) will 
be completed for each patient prior to inclusion in the study, and results will be evaluated to verify 
entry criteria prior to study randomization  and treatment assignment.   
10.1.2. Study Randomization / Treatment Assignment  
Patients who are screened and do not meet all entry criteria will not be entered in the clinical 
database. Once assigned, numbers for any screening failures, non -treated, non- evaluable, or 
discontinued patients will not be re-used. 
Randomization should occur only after confirming all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion 
criteria have been met. The study center will randomize the patient to treatment according to instructions provided by [CONTACT_775797], Inc. (or designee).  
10.1.3. Treatment Phase  
Specific procedures to be performed at each visit during the treatment phase are illustrated in the 
Study Assessment Schedule ( Table 1 ).  
The End of Treatment Visit should be performed within [ADDRESS_1106002] study drug dosing and prior to initiation of alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  As described in Section [IP_ADDRESS], any abnormalities 
(adverse events) attributed to study drug dosing, including laboratory abnormalities, should be subsequently followed until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize. 
10.1.4. Disease Assessment Visits 
Disease assessments will be performed every 6 (±1) weeks for 6 months and every 9 (±2) weeks 
thereafter, until progression.   Patients who discontinue study treatment without documented 
progression of disease as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1106003] Disease Assessment Visits until 
such criteria are met , regardless of intervening changes in therapy.   
10.1.5. Survival Follow- up 
Subsequent to progression of disease, all patients will be followed at 12 week intervals until study closure.  
10.2. Methods of Assessment  
10.2.1. Activity  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Anti -tumor Activity  
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed via PFS, ORR, DOR , and OS.  Tumor response and 
progression will be defined by [CONTACT_351846], according to RECIST 1.1 
criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Immunogenicity  
Patients will be monitored for the development of anti- CDX-011 and anti -CR011 antibodies, and 
whether these antibodies are neutralizing.

Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations 
Concentration of the antibody -drug conjugate (ADC), total antibody and free MMAE will be 
determined using GLP compliant ELISA and LC- MS/MS method s.   Population PK analyses will 
be performed to obtain pharmacokinetic parameters and to explore the relationships between 
patient -specific measures of exposure and safety and activity parameters; the influence of key 
intrinsic factors, such as weight and gender, on variability in PK will also be evaluated.  The i mpact 
of circulating GPNMB levels on pharmacokinetic parameters may  also be examined.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated via assessment of tumor tissue obtained via voluntary biopsy or re-resection.  Parameters evaluated may include localization of CDX -011, CR011 or MMAE at 
the tumor site and/or GPNMB expression levels in tumor tissue, as well evaluation of tumor infiltrating leukocytes .  Soluble GPNMB levels in circulation may  also be examined.  
10.2.2. Safety Variables 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events: Definition  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnorma l laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study 
treatment, whether or not related to the study treatment.  All observed or volunteered adverse events regardless of suspected causal relationship to the study treatmen t will be reported as 
described in the following sections. For the purposes of this current study, “study treatment” is defined as either CDX -011 or capecitabine.  
For all adverse events, the investigator is responsible for obtaining information adequate t o 
determine:  
• The appropriate descriptive term: Adverse events should be reported using concise medical 
terminology, preferably referring to the syndrome/diagnosis rather than symptoms, when possible. 
• Severity: adverse event severity will be primarily asses sed using NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0. (CTCAE), Version 4.0, division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institute of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) published May 29, 2009 at  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
 
• Onset/resolution dates and outcome 
• Causality: the relationship of each adverse event to study drug will be defined as “unrelated” 
or “related” to study treatment:  
• Unrelated: There is little or no possibility that the study drug caused the reported adverse 
event; and other factor(s) including concurrent illnesses, progression and expression of 
the disease state, concurrent medications, or a reaction to concurrent medications appear to explain the adverse event.  
• Related: there exists at least a reasonable possibility that the study treatments caused or 
contributed to the adverse event; an inability to identify an alternate etiology for an 
adverse event should not, by [CONTACT_5071], justify a “related” attribution. 
July 28, 2015    Page 47 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
• Whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event (see Section 
[IP_ADDRESS]). 
The following study -specific points of clarification should be noted when considering adverse 
event reporting and recording: 
• Progression of neoplasia should not be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. 
Findings that are clearly consistent with the expected progression of the underlying cancer should not be reported as an adverse event, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801182] a serious adverse event. If there is any uncertainty about a finding or event being due solely to progression of neoplasia, the finding or event should be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event as appropriate.  Death due to disease progression occurring  within 28 days of study treatment should be reported to Celldex within 
24 hours of the site’s awareness of the event; however, these events should not be documented as AEs or SAEs.  If there is any uncertainty about the cause of death, the event should be  
reported as a serious adverse event.  
• Withdrawal due to an adverse event should be distinguished from withdrawal due to 
insufficient response, and recorded on the appropriate adverse event CRF page.  For example, 
if an AE due to recurrence/progression of disease necessitates discontinuation from the study, the primary reason for study discontinuation should be recorded as “Recurrence/Progression of Disease” (not Adverse Event).  
• Abnormal objective test findings should be reported as adverse events if the findings are 
associated with accompanying symptoms, require additional diagnostic testing or 
medical/surgical intervention, lead to dose modification/discontinuation of study treatment and/or are considered otherwise clinically significant.   
• Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not 
be reported as adverse events.  However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an adverse event.  For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the adverse event reporting period should be reported as the adverse event, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the adverse event.  
• Any AEs/SAEs resulting in death should be recorded with an end date equal to the death date, 
while other events ongoing at the time of death should be recorded with an outcome of “continuing”. If requested, a summary of available autopsy findings should be submitted as soon as possible to the sponsor (or sponsor’s designated representative). 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs): Definition  
An SAE is any adverse event from this study that results in one of the following outcomes: 
• Death (any AE that has a fatal outcome must be assigned CTCAE v. 4.0 Grade 5.) 
• Requires initial or prolonged inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (Any initial admission, even if less than 
24 hours, to a healthcare facility meets these criteria. As well, any event occurring while the 
patient is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801183]/intensive care unit should also be reported under this criterion.  This criterion would exclude hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149327] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_801184], such as admission for treatment of  a preexisting condition not associated with a

not considered “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602]” for the purpose of this criterion.) 
• Is life -threatening (that is, immediate risk of dying)  
• Is a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Other significant medical hazard (Medical and scientific judgment should be  exercised in 
determining whether an event is an important medical event.  An important medical event 
may not be immediately life -threatening and/or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  However, 
if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject and/or may require intervention 
to prevent one of the other adverse event outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.) 
The following study -specific points of clarification should be noted when considering serious 
adverse event reporting and recording: 
• Progression of neoplasia should not be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. 
Findings that are clearly consistent with the expected progression of the underlying cancer 
should not be reported as an adverse event, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_801182] a serious adverse event. If there is any uncertainty about a finding being due solely to progression of neoplasia, the finding should be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event as app ropriate.  Death due to disease progression 
occurring within 28 days of study treatment should be reported to Celldex within 24 hours of the site’s awareness of the event; however, these events should not be documented as AEs or SAEs.  If there is any uncertainty about the cause of death, the event should be reported as a serious adverse event.  
• The following, although not necessarily meeting criteria for an SAE, should also be reported 
to Celldex Therapeutics, Inc. (or designee) according to SAE reporting p rocesses:  
• If a female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant within 6 months of expos ure to the 
study treatments (maternal exposure)  or if a male has been exposed to the study 
treatments within 6 months prior to conception (paternal exposure). 
• Any follow -up to the above -referenced events, including outcome of pregnancy. 
Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis.  In the 
case of paternal exposure, the investigator must obtain permission from the subject’s 
partner in order to conduct any follow-up or collect any information. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. AE/SAE Reporting  
The investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse events spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_1177].  In addition, each study subject will be questioned about adverse events.  
Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) should be recorded on the CRF from 
the time the subject has taken at least one dose of study treatment (CDX -011 or capecitabine) 
through (whichever occurs first) either a) [ADDRESS_1106004] administration of study 
treatment, or b) initiation o f alternate anticancer therapy.  
July 28, 2015    Page 49 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
However:  
• Any SAE occurring any time after the reporting period must be promptly reported if a causal 
relationship to study treatment is suspected  
• For AEs or SAEs with a causal relationship to the investigational product, follow -up by [CONTACT_801216] ≤ Grade 1, or stabilize  for at 
least three months after the last administration of study treatment (whichever is sooner). 
All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the CRF, while SAEs will also 
be reported in an expedited fashion using the Serious Adverse Event Report.  The AE CRFs and SAE Reports must be completed in a consistent manner; for example, the same adverse event term, causality, severity, and onset/resolution dates should be used on both forms.   
In case of a serious adverse event (regardless of causality), a Serious Adverse Event Report must 
be completed and sub mitted to the sponsor (or sponsor’s designated representative) within 24 
hours of the site’s notification of the event, irrespective of the extent of  available adverse event information. This timeframe also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously 
forwarded serious adverse event reports. The investigator is obligated to pursue additional information required for thorough evaluation of each SAE as may be requested by [CONTACT_775797], Inc. (or designee).  
Serious adverse event rep orting to regulatory authorities and all participating investigators will be 
conducted by [CONTACT_775797], Inc. (or designee) in accordance with 21CFR312.32 and 
international regulations, as appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Safety Data 
The following clinical laboratory tests will be performed during this study to assess safety (see Schedule of Assessments Table 1  for specific tests):  
• Hematology  
• Serum Chemistries  
• Urinalysis  
Investigators must document their review of each laboratory report by [CONTACT_364670], as well as addressing the clinical significance and causality (for significant abnormalities). Section [IP_ADDRESS] provides further guidance as to when abnormal laboratory results 
are to be reported as adverse events.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Other Safety Data  
The following evaluations will also be performed during the study to measure the safety and tolerability of CDX -011 and capecitabine chemotherapy:  
• Vital sign measurements  
• Physical examination  
• ECGs  
• ECOG performance status ( Appendix 4) 
11. INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING  COMMITTEE ( IDMC) 
An independent data monitoring committee will review cumulative data on an interim basis. The interim data reviews may include but are not limited to summaries of adverse events, laboratory 
July 28, [ADDRESS_1106005] randomized patient.  If a safety 
concern is identified, the IDMC may recommend modifying, halting or permanently stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801180].  Further details will be described in the IDMC  Charter.   
12. STATISTI CAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be dated and maintained by [CONTACT_801204] (or designee).  
This documentation may modify the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 
12.1. Analysis Endpoints  
Primary  
• Duration of progression- free survival (PFS)  
Secondary 
• Objective response rate (ORR)  
• Duration of response (DOR)  
• Overall survival (OS)  
Safety 
• Incidence of adverse events  
• Deaths on study 
• Discontinuations of study drug due to adverse events 
• Changes in hematology, chemistry, and other laboratory paramet ers 
• Changes in vital sign parameters  
• Changes in ECG parameters  
12.2. Sample Size and Power Calculation  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be PFS.  For patients with metastatic advanced GPNMB -
expressing breast cancer in the treatment setting under investigation, median PFS of 4 months is 
anticipated following  randomization to capecitabine.  It is hypothesized that CDX -011 will 
increase median PFS in such patients by 2.25 months (i .e., 4.0 vs 6.25 months).  Under the 
assumption of proportional hazards, such an increase corresponds to a hypothesized hazard ratio of 0.64.  If this hypothesized hazard ratio is true, 203 PFS events (total of two arms) determined 
by [CONTACT_801202] 85% power with 2- sided type I error of 0.05. Under the assumption of 
exponential distribution for each arm and uniform enrollment over 2 years, and 10% drop out rate 
(PFS events cannot be observed), 300 patients (200 in the CDX- 011 arm and 100 in the 
capecitabine arm) are needed, and it is anticipated that [ADDRESS_1106006] patient is randomized. The sample size calculation 
is performed using SAS v9.4. 
12.3. Interim Analysis  
There will be no interim analysis of efficacy in this study.  
[Interim Analysis d eleted]  
12.4. Analysis Populations 
12.4.1. Efficacy Analysis 
The Intention- to-Treat (ITT) population will be the basis for the primary analysis of efficacy in 
this study, and constitutes all randomized patients.  Patients in the ITT population will be included 
in the tr eatment arm to which they are randomized.   Every effort will be made to ascertain 
outcomes for all randomized patients, irrespective of early discontinuation of protocol therapy.   
A supportive analysis using the Per -Protocol population may be performed for the efficacy 
analysis.  The Per -Protocol population excludes patients due to important deviations from the 
protocol that may substantially affect the results of the primary analysis.  In addition, a baseline 
measurement and at least one follow -up measurement obtained after at least one dose of study 
treatment may be required for inclusion in the analysis of a specific efficacy parameter. The final determination on protocol violations, and thereby [CONTACT_329950] -Protocol population, 
will be mad e prior to locking the clinical database and final analysis and will be documented in a 
separate memo.  Patients in the Per -Protocol population will be included in the treatment arm to 
which they are randomized. 
12.4.2. Safety Analysis 
The safety population will i nclude all patients who receive at least one dose of study treatment 
(either CDX -011 or capecitabine).  A baseline measurement and at least one laboratory, vital sign, 
or other safety -related measurement obtained after at least one dose of study treatment may be 
required for inclusion in the analysis of a specific safety parameter.  
12.5. Statistical Methods  
12.5.1. Efficacy Analysis 
Progression- free survival  
PFS is defined as the number of months from randomization to the earlier of disease progression 
or death due to a ny cause.  The primary analysis of PFS will be based on PFS events determined 
by [CONTACT_801217] 1.1 (Eisenhauer, Therasse et al. 2009 ).    Patients whom enter 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3677], or other such similar care, without prior obje ctive  evidence of disease progression 
will be considered to have disease progression for purposes of the primary analysis of PFS.  Unless specified otherwise, all recorded PFS events will be included in the primary analysis regardless of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801174].  Patients who initiate alternate anticancer therapy in the absence of documented progression will be censored at the latest disease assessment prior to initiation of such therapy.   Patients who were last known to be alive and progression- free w ill be censored at the 
latest disease assessment.  Patients with no baseline or post -baseline disease assessments will be 
censored at the randomization date unless death occurred prior to the first planned assessment (in which case the death will be considered a PFS event).   A secondary analysis of PFS will be 
July 28, [ADDRESS_1106007] to follow -up as of a data analysis cutoff date will be right -censored.  
The censoring date will be determined from th e patients’ date of last contact.  OS will be 
summarized descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier method.  Inferential comparisons between 
treatment arms will use the stratified log -rank test.  Stratification will be based on the stratification 
factors used fo r the randomization.  The hazard ratio for treatment will be estimated using a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
12.5.2. Protocol Therapy and Concomitant Medications  
The total number of doses and total dose administered will be tabulated for study treatments. The 
primary reason for treatment delays, dose reductions and permanent discontinuation of study treatment will be tabulated in a similar manner.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using WHO Drug Dictionary.  All medication data will be listed individually and summarized by [CONTACT_801218].  
12.5.3. Safety Analysis 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_12035], severity, and changes from baseline of all relevant parameters including adverse events (AEs), ECGs, laboratory values, and vital signs. 
AEs will be coded using the latest available version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of patients experiencing one or more AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939], re lationship to study drug, and severity.  Laboratory parameters 
will be summarized using descriptive statistics, by [CONTACT_447]- dosing shifts relative to baseline, and data 
listings of clinically significant abnormalities.  Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as AEs that 
start on or after the first day study drug is administered. AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_801219], according to system organ class and preferred term.  A patient reporting multiple cases of the same AE will be counted once within each system organ class and similarly counted once within each preferred term.  Unless specified otherwise, the denominator for these calculations will be based on the number of patients  in each 
July 28, [ADDRESS_1106008] one (1) dose of study drug, irrespective of the total number of 
doses administered.  AEs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_12134] -CTCAE severity grade and by 
[CONTACT_8792].  Additional summaries may also be provided for SAEs and events 
resulting in the permanent discontinuation of therapy.  All AEs will be included in individual 
patient data listings.  
Vital sign results (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], and temperature) and ECG parameters will be summarized descriptively.   Changes will be calculated relative to the 
assessments at baseline.  
The changes in hematology, chemistry, and other laboratory values will be summarized descriptively.  The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities (including neutropenia, throm bocytopenia, and anemia) will be provided.  The use of red blood cell and other blood 
component transfusions and/or growth factor support will be reported.  Similar analyses will be done for selected chemistry tests (including liver and renal function test s).  Data listings of all 
laboratory data collected during the study will be presented.  Laboratory values outside normal limits will be identified in data listings and will include flags for high and low values.  
13. DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
13.1. Data Quali ty Assurance 
Monitoring and auditing procedures defined by [CONTACT_801220], in order to comply with GCP guidelines. Each center will be visited at regular intervals by a monitor to ensure compliance with the study protocol, GCP and leg al aspects. This will include on -site checking of 
the case report forms (CRF) for completeness and clarity, cross -checking with source documents, 
and clarification of administrative matters.  
To ensure the safety of participants in the study and to ensure a ccurate, complete, and reliable data, 
the investigator will keep records of laboratory tests, clinical notes, and patient medical records in 
the patient files as original source documents for the study.  All the information required by [CONTACT_19827]; any omissions require explanation. 
Celldex (or designee) will provide Case Report Forms (CRFs) for the recording and collection of 
data.  The CRF will either be in paper or via an electronic data capture (EDC) system.  Entries made in the CRF must be either verifiable against source documents, or have been directly entered into the CRF, in which case the entry in the CRF will be considered as the source data.  The source data parameter to be verified and the identification of the source document must be documented. Corrections to CRFs and source data will be made only by [CONTACT_801221], clearly entered, initialed and dated. The investigator will sign the CRFs to indicate that, to his/her knowledge, they are complete and ac curate.  If further changes are made after this, the investigator 
will be made aware of the corrections and his/her approval will be documented by [INVESTIGATOR_1312] -signing. In 
cases where an EDC system is utilized, an electronic audit trail is maintained with similar information collected.  
The investigator will permit Celldex (or designee) direct access to source data/documents for trial-
related monitoring, audits, review, and inspection(s).  Through ongoing monitoring visits at the investigational sites, Celldex (or des ignee) will periodically check the patient data recorded in the 
CRF’s against source documents, to ensure accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the protocol, regulatory compliance, and the maintenance of comprehensive clinical records.

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
As well, the stu dy may be audited by [CONTACT_801204] (or designee) and/or regulatory agencies at any time.  
If requested, the investigator will provide Celldex (or designee), applicable regulatory agencies 
and/or applicable ethical review boards with direct access to original source documents. 
13.2. Archiving of Study Documentation 
To enable evaluations and/or audits by [CONTACT_801222], the investigator agrees to 
keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link 
records,  e.g., CRFs and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1097]), all original signed informed consent forms, copi[INVESTIGATOR_206813], serious adverse event forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (e .g., letters, meeting 
minutes, telephone calls reports).  The duration of record retention by [CONTACT_801223], local regulations, or as specified in the Clinical Study Agreement, whichever is longer. 
If the investigator becomes unable for any reason to continue to retain study records for the 
required period (e.g., retirement, relocation), Celldex should be prospectively notified.  The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Celldex, such as another investigator, another institution, or to an independent third party arranged by [CONTACT_801204].  The investigator must 
obtain Celldex's written permission before disposing of any records, even if retention requirements have been met.  
14. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1. Independent Ethics Co mmittee or Institutional Review Board  
ICH GCP guidelines require that all investigational drug studies be conducted under the auspi[INVESTIGATOR_18279]/EC.  This committee, the makeup of which must conform to federal, state, and local guidelines regarding such, will approve all aspects of the study, including the protocol and informed consent to be used and any modifications made to the protocol or informed consent.  The investigator will provide Celldex (or designee) with a copy of the communication from the IRB/ EC 
to the investigator indicating approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_801185].  All 
changes to the protocol or consent form must be reviewed and approved prior to implementation, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard s to human patients. 
The investigator will provide Celldex (or designee) with documentation of ethical review board 
approval of the protocol and the informed consent document before  the study may begin at the 
investigative site(s).  The investigator will a lso be responsible for obtaining periodic IRB/EC re -
approval throughout the duration of the study.  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_8268]’s periodic report to the 
IRB/EC and copi[INVESTIGATOR_3762]/EC’s continuance of approval must be retained in the site study files and f urnished to Celldex (or designee). 
The IRB/ECs must supply to Celldex (or designee), upon request, a list of the IRB/EC members involved in the vote and a statement to confirm that the IRB/EC is organized and operates according to GCP and applicable laws and regulations.  
14.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
The procedures set out in this protocol, pertaining to the conduct, evaluation, and documentation of this study, are designed to ensure that the sponsor and investigator abide by [CONTACT_801224] i n the Declaration of Helsinki.  The

study will also be carried out in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_39684](s) and regulation(s).  The 
investigator is responsible for complying with the protocol and all appropriate regulations and 
guidelines governing global c linical research. Additionally, he/she is responsible for ensuring that 
all participating staff members are adequately trained and competent to perform his/her assigned tasks.  
14.3. Patient Information and Informed Consent  
A sample Informed Consent Form will be  provided. Prior to the beginning of the study, the 
investigator must have the IRB/ECs written approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_801186]. The written approval 
of the EC/IRB together with the approved patient information/Informed Consent Forms must be filed in the study files. The Informed Consent Form must contain all elements required ICH Good Clinical Practices (GCP) Guidelines (E6) in addition to any other elements require d by [CONTACT_1032], 
state, local or institutional policy.  
The investigator will be responsible for obtaining an Informed Consent signed by [CONTACT_801225]/her legally authorized representative, prior to his/her participation in the study, in accordance with ICH GCP guidelines.  Informed Consent will be obtained from a patient or his/her legally 
authorized representative after a full explanation of the purpose of the study, the risks and discomforts involved, potential benefits, etc., have been provided by [CONTACT_1719], 
both verbally and in writing.  The investigator is responsible to see that informed consent is 
obtained from each patient or legal representative and to obtain the appropriate signatures and dates on the informed consent document prior to the performance of any protocol procedures and prior to the administration of study drug. Participation in the study and date of informed consent given by [CONTACT_801226]’s files. 
The original or copy of the signed copy of the Informed Consent must be maintained in the 
institution’s records, and is subject to inspection by [CONTACT_801204] (or designee) or regulatory agencies.  The patient or his/her legally authorized representative will also be given a copy of the signed consent form. 
As used in this protocol, the term "informed consent" includes all consent and/or assent given by 
[CONTACT_801227].  
14.4. Protocol Amendments  
Modifications to the study protocol will not be implemented by [CONTACT_801228]/IRB approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. However, the 
investigator may implement a deviation from, or a change of, the protocol to eliminate an 
immediate hazard(s) to the trial patients without prior EC/IRB/ sponsor approval/favorable 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. The implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it, and if appropriate, the proposed protocol amendment, should be submitted to the EC/IRB  and Celldex (or designee) as soon as 
practical .  
Any deviations from the protocol must be fully explained and documented by [CONTACT_093] . The 
circumstances, action taken and impact of the deviation on the trial must be communicated by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_801187] (or designee) . Any subsequent actions will be  assessed by [CONTACT_801229] (or designee) and documented.

Appendix 3: RECIST 1.1 Criteria 
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary to estimate the overall tumor 
burden at baseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. All baseline evaluations should be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging based evaluation should always be done rather than clinical examination, unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461]. (See “Methods of Lesion Measurement” for further guidance.)  
Only patients with measurable disease on baseline evaluations should be included in Protocol CDX011 -04.  (Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155]; 
see “Measurability of Tumor at Baseline” below.)  At baseline, lesions should be identified as either “Target” or “Non -Target” as follows:  
Target Lesions :  
• Up to a maximum of five measurable target lesions total (with a maximum of two target 
lesions per organ) should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured 
at baseline. (This means in insta nces where patients have only one or two organ sites 
involved a maximum of two and four lesions respectively will be recorded.) 
• Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest 
diameter), be representative of all invol ved organs, and should be those that lend themselves 
to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest 
lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  
• All target lesion measurements should be recorded in metric notation, using calipers if clinically assessed.  
• A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target le sions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor 
regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. (See “Tumor response evaluation”.) 
Non-Target Lesions : 
• All other measurable/non- measureable lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological 
lymph nodes should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. It is acceptable to record multiple non- target les ions involving the same organ as a 
single item on the case report form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or ‘multiple liver metastases’).  
• Non-target lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. (See “Tumor response evaluation”.) While some non- target lesions may 
actually be measurable, they need not be measured and instead should be assessed only qualitatively.

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
MEASURABILITY OF TUMOR AT BASELINE  
• Measurable: Tumor lesions must be accurately measu red in at least one dimension (longest 
diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:  
• 10mm by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm). 
• 10mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non- measurable).  
• 20mm by [CONTACT_13190] X- ray. 
Note: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be 
≥15mm in short axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (for lymph nodes, only the short axis is 
measured and followed). 
• Non-measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15mm short axis) as well as truly non- measurable 
lesions. Lesions considered truly non- measurable in clude: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of 
skin or lung, and abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by [CONTACT_87415]. 
Special considerations regarding lesion measurability: 
• Malignant lymph nodes: Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal 
anatomical structures which may be visible by [CONTACT_87418]. Nodal size is normally reported as two dimensions in the plane in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane; for MRI the plane of acquisition may be axial, saggital or coronal). The smaller of these measures is the short axis. At baseli ne and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. To be 
considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15mm in short 
axis when assessed by [CONTACT_3610] (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 
5 mm). All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10mm but <15 mm) should be 
considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis <10mm are considered non-
pathological and should not be recorded or followed. 
• Bone lesions : Bone scan, PET scan  or plain films are not considered adequate imaging 
techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic- blastic lesions, 
with identifiable sof t tissue components, that can be evaluated by [CONTACT_801234]. Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.  
• Cystic lesions: Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts 
should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non- measurable) 
since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts. ‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.

• Lesions w ith prior local treatment: Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or 
in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not considered measurable 
unless there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
METHODS OF LESI ON MEASUREMENT  
• Clinical exam: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
and ≥ 10mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g. skin nodules). For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_3606] a rul er to estimate the size of the 
lesion is suggested. As noted above, when lesions can be evaluated by [CONTACT_115199], imaging evaluation should be undertaken since it is more objective and may also be reviewed at the end of the study. 
• Chest X- ray: Chest CT is preferred over chest X -ray, particularly when progression is an 
important endpoint, since CT is more sensitive than X- ray, particularly in identifying new 
lesions. However, lesions on chest X- ray may be considered measurable if they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  
• CT, MRI : CT is the best currently available and reproducible method to measure lesions 
selected for response assessment. This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5mm or less. When CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans). If there is con cern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead of CT in selected 
instances.  
• FDG -PET: While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression. (See “Tumor Response Evaluation”.) 
• Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement. Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the next. If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confi rmation 
by [CONTACT_12154].  
• Endoscopy, laparoscopy: The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation 
is not advised. However, they can be useful to confirm complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained or to determine re lapse in trials where recurrence following 
complete response or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
• Tumor markers : Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumor response. If 
markers are initially above the upper normal limit, however, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete response.  
• Cytology, histology : These techniques can be used to differentiate between PR and CR in 
rare cases if required by [CONTACT_990] (for example, residual lesions in tumor types such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain). When effusions are known to be a potential adverse effect of treatment (e.g. with certain taxane compounds or angiogenesis inhibitors), the cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens during treatment can be considered if the measurable tumor 
has met criteria for response or stable disease in order to differentiate between response (or stable disease) and progressive disease.

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
• TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
Evaluation of target lesions:  
Target lesions will be assigned an overall response assessment at each evaluation time point 
according to the following definitions:  
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
• Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increa se in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
• Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters  while on study. 
Special notes on the assessment of target lesions  
• Lymph nodes: Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short 
axis measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even  if the nodes regress to below 10mm on study. This means that when 
lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the ‘sum’ of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of <10mm. For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions. 
• Target lesions that become ‘too small to measure’: While on study, all lesions (nodal and 
non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (e.g. 2mm). However, sometimes lesions or lymph nodes which are recorded as target lesions at baseline become so faint on CT scan that the radiologist may not feel comfort able assigning an exact measure and may report 
them as being ‘too small to measure’. When this occurs it is important that a value be recorded on the case report form. If it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the meas urement should be recorded as 0mm. If the lesion is believed to 
be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm should be assigned.  (Note: It is less likely that this rule will be used for lymph nodes since they usually have a definable size when normal and are frequently surrounded by [CONTACT_12156]; however, if a lymph node is believed to be present and is faintly seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5mm should be assigned in this circumsta nce as 
well). This default value is derived from the 5mm CT slice thickness (but should not be changed with varying CT slice thickness). The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible, therefore providing this default value will prevent f alse responses or 
progressions based upon measurement error. To reiterate, however, if the radiologist is able to provide an actual measure, that should be recorded, even if it is below 5mm. 
• Lesions that split or coalesce on treatment . When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest 
diameters of the fragmented portions should be added together to calculate the target lesion 
July 28, [ADDRESS_1106012] diameter for the ‘coalesced lesion’. 
Evaluation of non-target lesions: 
Non-target lesions will be assigned an overall response assessment at each evaluation time point 
according to the following definitions: 
• Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of 
tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10mm short axis).  
• Non- CR/Non -PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of 
tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
• Progressive Disease (PD):  Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of existing non-
target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression). 
Special notes on assessment of progression of non- target disease:  
• When the patient also has measurable disease: In this setting, to achieve ‘unequivocal 
progression’ on the basis of the non- target disease, there must be an overall level of 
substantial worsening in non- target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target 
disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy (see further details below). A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non- target 
lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for unequivocal progression status. The desig nation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non- target disease in the 
face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.  
• When the patient has only non- measurable disease:  The same general concepts apply here as 
noted above, however, in this instance there is no measurable disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non- target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]: if all lesions a re truly non-
measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing patients for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required 
to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e., an increase in tumor burden representing an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in a p leural effusion from ‘trace’ to 
‘large’, an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in protocols as ‘sufficient to require a change in therapy’. If ‘unequivocal progression’ is seen, the patient should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to have objective criteria to apply to non- measurable disease, the 
very nature of that disease makes it impossible to do so, therefore the increase must be substantial.  
New lesions:  
The appea rance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression; therefore, some 
comments on detection of new lesions are important.  
July 28, 2015    Page 68 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
• There are no specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions; however, the 
finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning 
technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumour (for example, some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions ). This is particularly important when the patient’s baseline lesions show 
partial or complete response. For example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, which it is not.  
• A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is the patient who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study has a CT or MRI brain ordered w hich reveals metastases. The patient’s brain metastases are considered to be 
evidence of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.  
• If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and 
follow-up evaluat ion will clarify if it represents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm 
there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the 
initial scan.  
• While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes  reasonable to 
incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible ‘new’ disease). New lesions on the basis of FDG- PET 
imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
a. Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. (A ‘positive’ FDG- PET scan lesion means one which is 
FDG avid with an uptake greater than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.)  
b.  No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG- PET at follow -up: If the positive FDG-
PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD. If 
the positive FDG- PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan). If the positive FDG- PET at follow -up corresponds to a pre- existing 
site of disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD. 
Evaluation of overall response: 
It is assumed that at each protocol specified time point, an overall response assessment occurs. The patient’s overall response assignment will depend on the findings of both target and non-target disease and will also take into consideration the appearance of new lesions.  
Table [ADDRESS_1106013] non -measurable (therefore 
non-target) disease only,  Table 2  is to be used. 
Special notes on evaluation of overall response:  
• Missing assessments and inevaluable designation:  
• When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the patient is 
not evaluable (NE) at that time point.  
July 28, 2015    Page 69 of 86 
Protocol CDX 011-04 Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.  
Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
• If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, usually the case is 
also considered NE at that time point, unless a convincing argument can be made that 
the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time point response. This would be most likely to happen in the case of PD. For example, if 
a patient had a baseline sum of 50mm with three measured lesions and at follow-up only two lesions were assessed, but those gave a sum of [ADDRESS_1106014] achieved PD status, regardless of the contribution of the missing lesion. 
• ‘Symptomatic deterioration’: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptomatic deterioration is not a descriptor of an objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. The objective response status of such patients is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease as shown in Table 1 and Table 2 . 
• In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) before assigning a status of complete response. FDG- PET may be used to upgrade a response to a 
CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought t o represent fibrosis or scarring.  
• For equivocal findings of progression (e.g. very small and uncertain new lesions; cystic 
changes or necrosis in existing lesions), treatment may continue until the next scheduled 
assessment. If at the next scheduled assess ment, progression is confirmed, the date of 
progression should be the earlier date when progression was suspected. 
• Confirmation of response: In the event of complete or partial responses, efforts should be 
made to obtain a confirmatory scan (no sooner than 28 days later).

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUE STIONS  
What should be done if several unique lesions at baseline become confluent at a follow -up 
evaluation? 
Measure the longest diameter of the confluent mass and record to add into the sum of the longest 
diameters.  
How large does a new lesion have to be to count as progression? Does any small sub- centimeter 
lesion qualify, or should the lesion be at least measurable?  
New lesions do not need to meet ‘measurability criteria’ to be considered valid. If it is clear on previous 
images (with the same technique) that a lesion was absent then its definitive appearance implies 
progression. If there is any doubt (because of the techniques or conditions) then it is suggested that treatment continue until next scheduled assessment when, generally, all should be clear.  Either it gets 
bigger and the date of progression is the date of the first suspi[INVESTIGATOR_2798], or it disappears and one may then consider it an artefact with the support of the radiologists. 
How should one lesion be measured if on subsequent exams it is split into  two?  
Measure the longest diameter of each lesion and add this into the sum.  
Does the definition of progression depend on the status of all target lesions or only one?  
As per the RECIST 1.1 guideline, progression requires a 20% increase in the sum of diam eters of all 
target lesions AND a minimum absolute increase of [ADDRESS_1106015] slice thickness is >5 mm?  
RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1106016] a maximum slice thickness of 5 mm and the minimum si ze 
for a measurable lesion is twice that: 10 mm (even if slice thickness is <5 mm). If scanners with slice 
thickness >[ADDRESS_1106017] when target le sions become so small they are below the 10 mm 
‘measurable’ size?  
Target lesion measurability is defined at baseline. Thereafter, actual measurements, even if <10 mm, should be recorded. If lesions become very small, some radiologists indicate they are ‘to o small to 
measure’. This guideline advises that when this occurs, if the lesion is actually still present, a default 
measurement of [ADDRESS_1106018] PD if the ‘disappeared’ lesion reappears?  
Unless the sum meets the PD criteria, the reappearance of a lesion in the setting of PR (or SD) is not PD. 
The lesion should simply be added into the sum. If the patients had had a CR, clearly reappearance of an absent lesion would qualify for PD. 
When measuring the longest diameter of target lesions in response to treatment, is the same axis 
that was used initially used subsequently, even if there is a shape change to the lesion that may have produced a new longest diameter?  
The longest diameter of the lesion should always be measured even if the actual axis is different from the one used to measure the lesion initially (or at different time point during follow-up). The only exception 
to this is lymph nodes: as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_1106019] been selected at baseline and followed but then one of these target lesions then 
becomes non -evaluable (i.e. different technique used). What is the effect this has on the other target 
lesions and the o verall response?  
What may be done in such cases is one of the following:  
(a) If the patient is still being treated, call the center  to be sure that future evaluations are done with the 
baseline technique so at least SOME courses are fully evaluable  
(b) If that is not possible, check if there IS a baseline exam by [CONTACT_801235]...in which case if you retrieve the baseline measures from that technique you retrieve the 
lesion evaluability  
(c) If neither (a) nor (b) is po ssible then it is a judgement call about whether you delete the lesion from all 
forms or consider the impact of the lesion overall is so important that its being non -evaluable makes the 
overall response interpretation inevaluable without it. Such a decision should be discussed in a review 
panel.  
It is NOT recommended that the lesion be included in baseline sums and then excluded from follow-up 
sums since this biases in favo ur of a response. 
What if a single non -target lesion cannot be reviewed, for whateve r reason; does this negate the 
overall assessment?  
Sometimes the major contribution of a single non- target lesion may be in the setting of CR having 
otherwise been achieved: failure to examine one non -target in that setting will leave you unable to claim 
CR. It is also possible that the non-target lesion has undergone such substantial progression that it would 
override the target disease and render patient PD. However, this is very unlikely, especially if the rest of 
the measurable disease is stable or resp onding. 
A patient has a 32% decrease in sum cycle 2, a 28% decrease cycle 4 and a 33% decrease cycle 6. Does confirmation of PR have to take place in sequential scans or is a case like this confirmed PR?  
It is not infrequent that tumour shrinkage hovers around the 30% mark. In this case, most would consider PR to have been confirmed looking at this overall case. Had there been two or three non- PR observations 
between the two time point PR responses, the most conservative approach would be to consider this case 
SD. 
A patient has a lesion measurable by [CONTACT_801236]. Which should be followed?  
CT scan. Always follow by [CONTACT_801237] . 
A lesion which was solid at baseline has become necrotic i n the cent er. How should this be 
measured?  
The longest diameter of the entire lesion should be followed. Eventually, necrotic lesions which are responding to treatment decrease in size. In reporting the results of trials, you may wish to report on this 
phenomenon if it is seen frequently since some agents (e.g. angiogenesis inhibitors) may produce this 
effect.  
If I am going to use MRI to follow disease, what is minimum size for measurability?  
MRI may be substituted for contrast enhanced CT for some sites, but not lung. The minimum size for 
measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm) as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of 
5mm and no gap. In the event the MRI is performed with thicker slices, the size of a measurable lesion at 
baseline should be two times the slice thickness. In the event there are inter -slice gaps, this also needs to 
be considered in determining the size of measurable lesions at baseline.

Can PET –CT be used with RECIST?  
At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET– CT is not always of 
optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements. However, if your site has documented 
that the CT performed as part of a PET –CT is of the same diagnostic quality as a diagnostic CT (with IV 
and oral contrast) then the PET–CT can be used for RECIST measurements. Note, however, that the PET 
portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially 
performed.

Appendix 7 : Summary of Changes  
The following changes have been made to protocol CDX011-04 as Amendment 4: 
SECTION(S) CHANGE/RATIONALE  
3. Protocol Synopsis,  
Number of Study 
Centers  Increased maximum  number of study centers  from [ADDRESS_1106036] 
Eligibility  In inclusion criteria 3 and 4  and Table 1 footnotes  9 and 11 , deleted “locally 
advanced/recurrent/metastatic” which are examples of advanced disease settings but 
are not intended to be strict criteria.  
The following statement was inserted based on the  recommendation following 
the change to Inclusion Criterion 4 in Amendment 3:  
“Patients with low hormone receptor expression (ER and/or PR 1- 9%) must be 
deemed appropriate candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy by [CONTACT_093].”  
For safety considerations  added exclusion criterion  10: “ Previously received 
capecitabine and discontinued due to progressive disease or intolerance; previously 
received CDX -011 (CR011- vcMMAE;  glematumumab vedotin) or other MMAE -
containing agents .” The original exclusion criterion 10 was deleted in amendment 2.  
For safety considerations added exclusion criterion 11:  “Active systemic infection 
requiring treatment. Infection controlled by [CONTACT_801201].  Note: microscopic examination of urinalysis is required during screening.  If urinary infection is suspected, then a negative urine culture is required prior to enrollment. ”  
The original exclusion criterion 11 was deleted in amendment 2.  
For safety considerations added exclusion criterion 12: “Chronic use of systemic corticosteroid above the  physiologic dose (5 mg per day prednisone or equivalent) 
within 7 days of enrollment, except for premedication. ”  The original exclusion 
criterion 12 was deleted in amendment 2.  
4. Schedule of Assessments  
Table 1  Added hematology and Adve rse event monito ring to Cycle 1/Day 7 and Cycle  1/Day 
14 as safety measures.  To minimize study burden, n oted in Footnote 29 that adve rse 
event monitoring on Cycle 1/Day 7 and Cycle 1/Day 14 could be performed in person or by [CONTACT_65859], thereby [CONTACT_801238] 29 to new Footnote 30. 
Shortened visit window of Cycle 2/Day 1 from +/ -5 days to +/ -[ADDRESS_1106037] 80 
patients to up to 150 patients  enrolled at a subset of  study centers .  The increase is to 
ensure that an adequate number of patients can provide samples from 3 time points 
(Cycle 1/Day  1, Cycle 2/Day 1, and End of Treatment) in order t o generate sufficient  
and meaningful  data.  
The following statement was also added:  
“Celldex will notify the sites when the req uisite number of patients providing PBMC 
samples has been reached or that further data is not needed.”  
Footnote 28. Clarified that rash biopsies are only encouraged from patients who received CDX -011 by [CONTACT_122442] “treatment -related rash” to “rash possibly r elated to 
CDX -011.”  
July 28, [ADDRESS_1106038] -20, and CDX011- 03 studies.  
Table 4. Updated table with final results from the CDX011 -03 study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management of 
Toxicity  
 A section has been added on “Infections and Sepsis” as potential and previously observed toxicities of glembatumumab vedotin.  
Additional information has been included on the signs and management of infection.  
9. Concomitant Therapy  For safety considerations added that p rolonged use of systemic corticosteroids above 
the physiologic dose ( 5 mg prednisone or equivalent) should be avoided during the 
study.

12.3 Interim Analysis  The following statements were deleted based on the  recommendation to remove the interim analysis of PFS:  
“In addition, an interim analysis of PFS will occur at 102 PFS events (50% 
information). The study may be stopped early if the futility boundary for PFS is met.” 
“…for a group sequential design with one interim analysis planned at 50% of target 
PFS events (102) using O’Brien Fleming alpha spending boundary.”  
“At the time of the interim analysis, futility will also be considere d with the non -
binding futility boundary for PFS defined as the observed hazard ration (HR) >0.90.  
The study may be stopped early if the futility boundary for PFS is met.  The interim analysis will be performed by [CONTACT_801239].” 
“The DMC will provide recommendations about stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_801192]…”  
The following section was deleted in its entirety: Section 12.3 Interim Analysis.  
Consequently, sample size  calculations now require only 203 events (rather than 204 
events) for PFS analysis  and this change is reflected in the protocol .

  To facilitate accrual, the study population is now described as, “ Patients with metastatic, 
GPNMB over-expressing, triple -negative breast cancer, who have failed taxane therapy 
and who have received anthracycline therapy or for whom anthracycline therapy is not 
clinically indicated.” 
The following eligibility criteria have also been revised accordingly :  
• Inclusion criterion 4: Minimal or no expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors 
will be defined by <10% of cells positive by [CONTACT_4658] (rather than <1%), consistent with 
current acceptable standards of care.  
• Inclusion criteria 6 and 7: The eligibility  restrictions requiring “resistance” to 
anthracycline and taxane therapy have been removed.  These eligibility criteria now read,

anthracycline therapy is not clinically indicat ed, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_44984]   
7. Prior receipt of taxane -containing chemotherapy, in any setting 
• Exclusion criterion  1: The required progression- free interval following neo/adjuvant 
therapy has been reduced from [ADDRESS_1106040] 
been changed from:  
• “Resistant” to anthracycline therapy (i.e., progression- free interval of ≤ 6 months 
after completing treatment) vs. “Exposed” to anthracycline therapy (i.e., 
progression -free interval of > 6 months after completing treatment).  
to:  
• Progression -free interv al ≤ 6 months after receipt of taxane therapy vs. progression-
free interval > 6 months after receipt of taxane therapy  
• Received anthracycline therapy previously vs. no prior anthracycline therapy

with Objective Response Rate now included as a secondary endpoint.  
The statistical section has therefore been revised as followed:  
• Sample size calculation is modified b ased on the primary endpoint of PFS with 
85% power and 2- sided 5% type I error. The number of subjects (300) remains 
the same, but the target number of PFS events at final analysis is modified to 204.  
• Interim analysis will be based on PFS (not ORR), and wi ll include superiority and 
futility considerations. The timing of the interim analysis is determined as 50% 
PFS events.  
• OS, as a secondary endpoint, will be analyzed at the interim and final analyses to 
support PFS and to demonstrate no detrimental effect  on survival. After final 
analysis of PFS, patients will continue to be followed for survival and updated OS 
analysis maybe performed as events accumulate.

The following changes have been made to protocol CDX011-04 as Amendment 1: 
SECTION(S)  CHANGE/RATIONALE  
Synopsis, Indication  
5.5. Study Rationale  Study eligibility have been  revised to ensure that enrolled patients are taxane -resistant; as 
such, the indication is now described as, “Patients with metastatic, GPNMB over- expressing, 
triple -negative breast cancer, who are taxane -resistant and have received an anthracycline -
contai ning chemotherapy regimen.”

SECTION(S)  CHANGE/RATIONALE  
Synopsis, Overview of 
Study Design  
7.1. Overall Design 
and Plan of the Study  As all enrolled patients will now be taxane -resistant, enrollment will be stratified by [CONTACT_801242].   
Synopsis, Eligibility Criteria  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Inclusion 
Criteria  Inclusion #2 added to ensure enrollment of patients with progressive disease; “Documented 
progression of disease after last anticancer regimen.”   
Inclusion #2 (now #3): Revised to exclude details regarding IHC for GPNMB.  Assay 
methodology will be included in separate study -specific documentatio n.     
Inclusion #4 (now #5): wording change for clarity.  Criterion changed from, “ No more than 
one chemotherapy -containing regimen…” now reads, “ 0 or 1 prior  chemotherapy -containing 
regimen for advanced (locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) breast cancer.”  
Inclusion #5 (now #6 and #7): revised to require taxane resistance and further clarify 
acceptable situations where additional anthracycline therapy would not be required for 
patients who have not received cumulative doses of 240 mg/m
2:  
6. Prior rece ipt of anthracycline -containing chemotherapy in any setting.   
a. If received as neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, there must have been a progression-
free interval of >  6 months after completion of neoadjuvant/adjuvant  therapy and 
no further anthracycline therapy should be indicated.*   
b. If received in the setting of advanced (locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) disease, there are no restrictions based on the subsequent progression- free interval; 
however, any patient who had a progression- free interval of > [ADDRESS_1106046] no further anthracycline therapy indicated.* 
* Patients in whom no further anthracycline therapy would be indicated include 
those with contraindicating cardiac conditions, prior intolerance to anthracycline therapy, or those who have received cumulative doses of 240 mg/m
[ADDRESS_1106047] one of the following:  
a. If received in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting, there must have been a progression-free interval of > 6 months after completion of neo/adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, 
if the progression- free interval was >12 months after completion of neo/adjuvant 
therapy, the patient must have received additional taxane -containing therapy (i.e., a 
taxane re -challenge) for advanced disease and had progression while receiving or 
within 6 months of completing the taxane -rechallenge therapy.   
b. If received in the setting of advanced (locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) 
disease, there must have been progression while receiving or within 6 months of 
completing advanced disease therapy.    
Inclusion #9 (now #11): Revised to remove inaccurate definition of target disease per 
RECIST 1.1. Now reads, “ Measurable (target) disease by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 criteria (Eisenhauer, 
Therasse et al. 2009) (Appendix 3). Target lesions selected for tumor measurements should be those where surgical resection or radiation are not indicated or anticipated.      
Inclusion #14 (now #16): Revised to include “if applicable” relative to HIPAA, as HIPAA is 
not applicable in countries planed for participation.    
Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments  
10.1.1. Screening 
Period  Consistent with the change to eligibility, “if applicable” has been inserted relative to HIPAA.

Amendment 4 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION  
SECTION(S)  CHANGE/RATIONALE  
Table 1.  Schedule of 
Assessments  Footnote #6 (stating that the assessments does not need to be repeated if completed within the previous 24 hours as part of screening) has been applied to the Cycle 1/Day 1 urinalysis.   
“BRCA mutation analysis” has been changed to “Molecular profiling” an d footnote #20 has 
been revised to more accurately describe the planned analyses; “Blood sample for BRCA1/2 
mutation status and other potentially relevant molecular markers.”  
Footnote #4: Frequency of survival follow -up for patients who discontinue study treatment in 
the absence of progression has been amended 6 (±1) or 9 (±2) weeks, consistent with Disease Assessment Visits.   
Footnote #8: wording corrected to specify that tissue for screening GPNMB analysis must have been obtained in the advanced disease (locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic) setting, rather than only in the metastatic setting, consistent with eligibility.  
Footnote #18: wording revised to specify that “other soluble mediators” may be examined in 
serum samples.  
Footnote #22: revised to reference the applicable Site Manual that will be provided by 
[CONTACT_801204] (or designee), and further clarify expected methodology for tumor evaluation as follows, “Contrast -enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, as well as all other 
suspected disease sites is required. MRI exams of the brain, abdomen, and pelvis can be performed in lieu of a CT; however MRI exams of the chest are not recommended.  In the 
event that a chest MRI is performed, a non- contrast chest CT is strongly recommended to 
evaluate the lung parenchyma. Brain and/or bone scans are required for any patients with a 
history of metastases to bone and/or brain or where symptomatology raises the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_801195]/or brain metastases. Lesions identified on bone scans should be confirmed by a CT 
or MRI at baseline, and, if identified as target lesions due to soft tissue component, they 
should continue to be followed by [CONTACT_153262] (i.e., CT or MRI scan). However, 
bone lesions followed as non- target disease may be subsequently followed by [CONTACT_801243].  Lesions that cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_801244] a ruler (preferred method) or measured with calipers.”  
Table 1.  Schedule of Assessments  
8. Concomitant 
Medicati ons Footnote #24: reporting of concomitant medications revised for consistency with safety follow -up, “…concomitant medications required to treat CDX -011-related SAEs taken 
throughout the duration of study follow -up should also be recorded.”  
8.1.6. Dose Modifications  Further detail provided regarding the management of neuropathy, as follows, “Patients that 
develop Grade [ADDRESS_1106048] treatment discontinued altogether.”  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Management 
of Toxicity  Cross -reference added to Section 8.1.[ADDRESS_1106049] changed to encourage prompt modification of capecitabine dose in the event of toxicity, to avoid attrition due to toxicity in the control arm.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. AE/SAE 
Reporting  Wording changed to clarify follow -up period for ongoing, treatment -related adverse events, 
“For AEs or SAEs with a causal relationship to the investigational product, follow -up by [CONTACT_801216] ≤ Grade 1, or stabilize for at 
least three months after the last administration  of study treatment (whichever is sooner).”

Doravirine for Persons with Excessive Weight Gain on I ntegrase Inhibitors and T enofovir 
Alafenamide (The Do IT Study)  
 
DESIGN A phase IV , 48-week, 3-arm, open-label, randomized study to assess 
whether an antiretroviral therapy (ART ) switch from bictegravir (BIC), 
dolutegravir (DTG), or raltegravir (RAL) with tenofovir 
alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC)  or TAF/lamivudine (TAF/3TC)  to 
either a regimen containing doravirine (DOR) with TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC  
depending on location), or DOR with tenofovir disproxil fumarate 
(TDF )/FTC  (or TDF/3TC depending on location)  results in reduced weight 
gain, or weight loss, as compared to continuation of current BIC-, DTG -, 
or RAL -containing ART.  
 DURATION   48 weeks  
 SAMPLE SIZE 222 participants (74 per arm)  
 
POPULATION  Persons living with human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) aged ≥18 years  
with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 on an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)  + 
TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC)  regimen for  at least 48 weeks prior to entry 
with maintenance of virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
or below the lower limit of HIV -1 RNA detection available at the site) . 
 STRATIFICATION  Enrollment will be stratified by [CONTACT_163385] (African 
American/Black vs. non- African American/Black). 
 REGIMEN  Participants on BIC, DTG, or RAL-containing ART with TAF/FTC (or 
TAF/3TC) for at least 48 weeks  prior to entry, will be randomized 1:1:1 to 
switch to DOR  + TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC ) (Arm 1 ), or DOR  + TDF/FTC  (or 
TDF/3TC ) (Arm 2 ), or to continue on their current INSTI +TAF/FTC  (or 
TAF/3TC ) (Arm 3). Total duration of study treatment in all arms will be 48 
weeks. 
 
DOR will be provided to Arms 1 and 2 participants through the study . 
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and INSTIs will not be 
provided by [CONTACT_1758] .

1.0 HYPOTHESIS AND STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Hypothesis  
 
Compared to continued bictegravir (BIC), dolutegravir (DTG), or raltegravir (RAL) + 
tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC)  or TAF/lamivudine (TAF/3TC) therapy  
(Arm 3), a switch to doravirine (DOR) + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) (Arm 1) will result in less 
weight gain or an overall weight loss at 48 weeks among obese persons (i.e., a BMI ≥ 30 
kg/m2). A switch from TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) to tenofovir disproxil fumarate (C)/F TC (or 
TDF/3TC)  (Arm 2) will result in further reduction in weight gain or overall weight loss  
compared to Arm 1. 
 1.2 Primary Objective  
 
To assess if an antiretroviral therapy ( ART) switch to DOR (either switch to DOR and 
remain on TAF/FTC [or TAF/3TC, Arm 1] or switch to DOR and TDF/FTC [or TDF/3TC , 
Arm 2]) results in differences in weight change over 48 weeks, compared to a strategy of remaining on current ART (INSTI + TAF/FTC [or TAF/3TC , Arm 3]). 
 1.3 Secondary Objectives  
 
1.3.1 To assess if a switch to TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC) from TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) results in differences in weight changes over 48 weeks by [CONTACT_163386] 2 
DOR -containing switch strategies (i.e., DOR+TAF/FTC [or TAF/3TC] versus DOR  
+ TDF/FTC [or TDF/3TC] [Arm 1 versus Arm 2]).  
 
1.3.2 To assess the effects of a switch from INSTI + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) to DOR  + 
TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC), or DOR  + TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC) over 48 weeks on:  
 
i. Safety and tolerability.  
ii. Maintenance of virologic suppression. 
iii. Minimum waist circumference.  
iv. Fasting cardiometabolic parameters: glucose and insulin, homeostatic model 
assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA -IR) and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805] (triglycerides, low-

 2.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 Background  
 
Early in the HIV epi[INVESTIGATOR_901], weight loss was a sign of more advanced disease, and 
weight gain following ART initiation was often regarded as a “ return to health” 
phenomenon. In the current era, however, a rising proportion of people with HIV (PWH) 
are obese (body mass index [ BMI] ≥30 kg/m
2), which increases the risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_163366]. In a multi-cohort analysis of over 14,000 PWH in the 
[LOCATION_002] and Canada, the percentage of obese individuals at ART initiation increased from 9% to 18% between 1998 and 2010, and 18% of individuals overweight at the start of treatment became obese within 3 years after ART initiation [1]. Other studies have confirmed increasing prevalence of obesity in 
PWH [2, 3, 4], which parallels similar  trends in the general population [5]. Women, 
minorities, and persons of lower socioeconomic status with HIV carry a disproportionate burden of obesity. The risk for metabolic diseases including diabetes mellitus, neurocognitive impairment, liver disease, and cardiovascular disease rises with increased body weight  [6, 7, 8, 9]. Furthermore, weight gain in 
PWH confers greater risk of metabolic disease compared with HIV -negative 
individuals [6, 10, 11]. 
 
Several prospective and retrospective studies report that PWH starting or switching to 
INSTI-containing ART regimens  have significantly greater weight gain compared to 
protease inhibitor (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) -
containing regimens, which may be further compounded by [CONTACT_163388] a second agent. At present, it is unknown whether obese PWH on INSTI + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) 
could either attenuate their rate of weight increase over time or reduce body weight with a change to a different ART regimen.  
 
In the prospective AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) study A5257, the use of RAL with 
TDF/FTC as an initial regimen was associated with greater increases in waist 
circumference and higher odds of a >10% weight gain at 96 weeks compared to ritonavir-boosted darunavir  (DRV/r) and ritonavir -boosted atazanavir, each in 
combination with TDF/FTC [ 12]. In a large analysis of >22,000 treatment-naïve PWH in 
the multi -site North American AIDS Cohort Collaboration on Research and Design (NA -
[ADDRESS_189660]), those initiating INSTI-
containing regimens gained an estimated 5.9 kg after 5 years of treatment, compared to 3.7 kg for 
NNRTI, and 5.5 kg for PI  [13]. However, 
most of this weight gain occurred in the 
first 2 years following ART initiation for all classes, and among INSTIs there was considerable heterogeneity: 
estimated weight gain at 2 years was 
7.2 kg for DTG, 5.8 kg for RAL, and 4.1 kg for elvitegravir (EVG) (Figure 2.1-1). The NA -ACCORD analysis period was 
2007-[ADDRESS_189661]- line regimens 
primarily contained TDF, abacavir (ABC), FTC, and/or 3TC. Smaller observational studies also report greater weight gain among PWH initiating INSTI-containing regimens, which generally has been greater among 
women, African American/Black people, 
and those with lower pre-ART weight 
and CD4
+ T cell counts  [13, 14, 15, 16]. 
 
A switch from an NNRTI - or PI -
containing regimen to an INSTI-containing regimen may also be accompanied by [CONTACT_163389]. In a single-site report, PWH with virologic suppression on efavirenz (EFV) -
containing regimens who switched to INSTI-containing regimens experienced significantly more weight gain compared to those who remained on EFV, and weight gain was greatest among those who switched to DTG  [17]. Similarly, in ACTG protocols 
A5001 and A5322, women, African American/Black people, and persons age ≥ 60 who 
switched from PI- and NNRTI-containing regimens to INSTI-containing regimens while virologically suppressed had significantly greater weight gain in 
the 2 years following the switch 
versus the 2 years prior to switch (Figure 2.1-2)  [18]. Figure 2.1-1: NA-ACCORD: Predicted weight at 2 -years 
of ART among PWH starting INSTI -containing regimens  
compared to those starting PI - or NNRTI -class regimens .
 
Figure 2.1-2: ACTG A5001 and A5322 : Change in weight 
before and after switch to INSTI -containing regimens.  
 

[ADDRESS_189662] compounding effects on weight gain. TAF, approved in the US in November 2015, represented a low proportion of nucleoside(tide) reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor  (NRTI ) use in the 
above ART-naïve observational studies, but use of this agent is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_163367]. In the ADVANCE study, ART-naïve 
South African women randomized to DTG/TAF/FTC gained an average of 10 kg at 96 weeks of treatment (representing an average 16% weight gain), as compared to 5 kg on DTG/TDF/FTC and 3 kg on 
EFV/TDF/FTC (Figure 2.1-3)  [19]. 
 
For men, average weight gain at 96 weeks was 
5 kg, 4 kg, and 1 kg, respectively, on the same 
regimens. Over the 96 weeks, weight 
continued to increase in women, while 
plateauing in men. Lastly, a pooled analysis of weight gain in 8 randomized controlled clinical trials of treatment-naïve PWH initiating ART between 2003-2015, comprising over 5,000 participants and 10,000 person-years of follow -
up, found greater weight gain over 96 weeks 
among those receiving TAF-containing regimens as compared to other NRTIs (Figure 2.1-4; error bars depi[INVESTIGATOR_163368] 95% CI, and asterisks are color -coded to denote p≤0.05 
compared to zidovudine [AZT]. At 96 weeks, mean weight gains by [CONTACT_163390]: TAF 4.25 kg [95% CI 3.94-4.56], ABC 3.08 kg [95% CI 2.36-3.81], TDF 2.07 kg [95% CI 1.84-
2.30]), and AZT 0.39 kg [95%  CI -0.57-1.34] after adjusting for age, race, sex, baseline 
clinical factors, and additional ART agents  [20]. 
 
Taken together, these studies suggest that NNRTI - and non-TAF-containing regimens 
are accompanied by [CONTACT_163391]  [13, 17, 20] , rais ing the possibility 
that a switch to this ART combination may offer a weight stabilization or reduction benefit 
among obese PWH on an INSTI/TAF regimen. DOR is an NNRTI  that was  approved by 
[CONTACT_2165] (FDA ) in 2018 on the basis of phase 3 studies 
demonstrating non-inferiority compared to EFV - or DRV/r -containing regimens, in 
addition to a superior neuropsychiatric profile compared to EFV  [21, 22, 23]. In the 
DRIVE -SHIFT trial, a switch to DOR with TDF/3TC among virally suppressed Figure 2.1-4: Analysis of pooled clinical RCT

participants demonstrated non-inferior maintenance of HIV -1 suppression compared with 
boosted PI, boosted EVG, and other NNRTI-containing regimens  [24]. Data presented at 
the 17th European AIDS Conference showed weight gain at 48 weeks among ART-
naïve persons initiating DOR was similar to those initiating DRV/r (1.0 vs. 0.6 kg, p=0.12) 
in pooled p hase 2 and 3 studies, but higher compared to EFV (1.0 vs. 0.0 kg, p<0.001). 
The difference in weight gain between DOR and EFV was smaller, though still 
significant, at 96 weeks (1.5 vs. 1.0 kg, p=0.02) [ 25]. 
 
This study will determine whether a switch to a DOR -based ART regimen results in less weight 
gain, weight stability or an overall weight loss at 48 weeks among obese persons currently on 
an INSTI + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) regimen, and whether cardiovascular and metabolic health 
biomarkers  improve. All study medications are FDA-approved for the treatment of HIV, but the 
study is not without risks to participants. Major risks include the potential for treatment failure on the new regimen, the development of side effects specific to the medications, and a 
reduction in bone density among those randomized to DOR + TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC). The protocol includes procedures to exclude persons at higher risk of these adverse events, and to monitor participants for the development of adverse events during the study. Participants in the study may also derive potential benefits, including a stabilization or reduction in body weight, and/or improved cardiovascular and/or metabolic health. The risks and benefits of this study are described in more detail in the informed c onsent. 
 2.2 Rationale 
 
Given that a 5% weight loss is associated with a substantial reduction in diabetes risk, a reduction in intrahepatic triglyceride content, and improved adipose tissue, liver , and 
muscle insulin sensitivity, interventions to reverse or attenuate weight gain among obese 
PWH exposed to INSTI/TAF regimens could improve cardiometabolic health outcomes. 
 3.0 STUDY DESIGN  
 
A5391 is a phase IV, 48-week, three-arm, open label, randomized study of an ART 
regimen switch from BIC, DTG, or RAL + TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC) to a DOR -containing 
regimen with TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC  depending on location) or TDF/FTC  (or TDF/3TC  
depending on location) versus continuation of current AR T. 
 
Persons aged ≥18 years with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2 and a minimum of 48 weeks of an 
INSTI  + TAF /FTC  (or TAF/3TC ) regimen will be randomized 1:1:1 to switch to DOR  + 
TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) (Arm 1) or DOR  + TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC) (Arm 2) versus 
continued current INSTI + TAF /FTC  (or TAF/3TC)  regimen (Arm 3).  
 
NOTE: TAF and INSTI do not have to have been initiated simultaneously  (see section 4.1.4). 
 
The proposed sample size is 222 participants (74 per arm).

For additional information on the protocol registration process and specific documents required for initial and amendment registrations, refer to the current version of the DAIDS Protocol Registration Manual. 
 
Once a potential participant has been identified, details will be carefully 
discussed with the participant. The participant will be asked to read and sign the approved protocol consent form prior to the initiation of study procedures . 
 
Participants from whom a signed informed consent has been obtained may be screened and enrolled, if they otherwise qualify. An

For participants from whom informed consent has been obtained, but who are deemed ineligible or who do not enroll into the initial protocol step, an ACTG Screening Failure Results form must be completed and keyed into the database. 
Participants who meet the enrollment criteria will be registered to the study 
according to standard ACTG DMC procedures.  
 4.4 Plans for Enrollment of Women  
 
Given the greater weight gain observed among women receiving INSTI-containing 
regimens, the study will  enroll a greater number of women (defined as female sex 
assigned at birth)  compared to men (> 50%). 
 
NOTE  A: Since the numbers of trans gender  men enrolling are expected to be small, 
requiring a minimum of 50% persons assigned female sex at birth at enrollment will 
guarantee the population of women in our study, which includes both cis and 
transgender  women, will be >50% of all participants. Enrollment based on sex assigned 
at birth was selected to account for study sites that do not record gender, or settings where participants may be hesitant to report gender.  NOTE B: The protocol team may assign study enrollment limits for sex assigned at birth 
as needed (see section 7.4). 
 4.5 Plans for Enrollment of Minorities  
 
Given the greater weight gain observed among persons of African American/Black race 
receiving INSTI-containing regimens, the study  will enroll a greater number of African 
American/Black participants compared to non-African American/Black participants 
(>50%) at US (i.e. , non-international) sites . The over-enrollment of African 
American/Black participants at US sites  (relative to their representation in the general 
US population) is justified as these individuals comprise > 40% of new HIV acquisitions 
in the US annually , and may disproportionately benefit from a switch to DOR . Increasing 
the representation of African American/Black participants in the trial will facilitate the 
assessment of race as a factor in the response to ART switch. 
 
NOTE: The protocol team may assign study enrollment limits for race at US sites  as 
needed (see section 7.4).

scheduling guidance for the DEXA scan at entry (baseline). 
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_189686] 8 hours  before the visit. If the 
study participant is not fasting, the participant should return to the clinic within the visit window per the SOE . 
 
If a participant experiences an acute inflammatory condition within 14 days prior to 
a scheduled visit, any scheduled blood collection evaluation should be postponed 
for an additional 7 days from the initial scheduled visit. Examples of inflammatory 
conditions that would justify delaying blood collection evaluation include an 
infection requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], a systemic viral illness such as an influenza-like 
illness, a severe drug hypersensitivity reaction, myocardial infarction, fever on the day of vis it (defined as T° >38.5°C ), and major trauma. Sites are encouraged to 
contact [CONTACT_941] A5391 CMC via email ( [EMAIL_3308] ) with any questions 
regarding whether a specific situation would require a delay in blood collection, and determination of whether the inflammatory condition has resolved.

Because of diurnal variations in values that may be measured on stored 
samples, all blood collections should be collected prior to 11:00 AM local time. If 
this is not possible, then participants ’ samples should be collected at 
approximately the same time of day (morning or afternoon) throughout the study.  
 
Evaluations at week [ADDRESS_189687] occur -3/+7 days of the target visit. 
 
NOTE : If treatment initiation was [ADDRESS_189688] occur ±14 days of the target visit. 
 
Study Completion  
The week 48 evaluations will be the participant’s final scheduled study visit. 
Participants must arrive fasting for the study completion visit. Fasting is defined 
as nothing to eat or  drink except for prescription medications and water for at 
least 8 hours before the visit. If the study participant is not fasting, the participant 
should return to the clinic for fasting evaluations within the visit window  (±14 
days). If additional HIV -1 RNA testing for virologic failure visit is not necessary 
(i.e., plasma H IV-1 RNA is determined to be ≤200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at week 48), 
participants should discontinue the study and study treatment once they 
complete their week 48 visit evaluations . Refer to the Discontinuation Log in the 
A5391 electronic case report form  (eCRF ) completion guideline.  
 
If additional HIV-1 RNA testing for virologic failure visit is necessary (i.e., plasma 
HIV-1 RNA is determined to be >200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at week 48 visit), participants 
should discontinue the study only after a repeat HIV-1 RNA is determined to be 
≤200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL or virologic failure is confirmed and a genotype is sent. In this 
circumstance, the participant should continue on his or her randomized regimen 
until HIV -1 RNA and/or viral genotype results are obtained. Additional DOR can 
be provided to participants  in Arms 1 and 2 to ensure continued administration 
until all required testing is completed. Refer to the Discontinuation Log in the A5391 eCRF completion guideline.  
 
6.2.4 Event-Driven Evaluations  
 
Confirmation of virologic failure  
• Participants with HIV -1 plasma RNA >200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL on a post-entry 
sample should receive repeat viral load testing within 2 weeks of site receipt 
of the initial result. A genotype can be drawn with the blood for the second viral load, but not sent to the lab until virologic failure is confirmed with a second viral load >200.  
• If virologic failure is confirmed with second HIV-1 plasma RNA >200, then the participants will undergo HIV -[ADDRESS_189689] be keyed for the period up to and including the entry visit.

The study will enroll >50% women and >50% African American/Black participants. For the purpose of enrollment limits, a woman is defined as someone assigned female sex 
at birth. The protocol team may assign overall study enrollment limits for sex at all sites 
and race at US sites, or  site-specific enrollment limits. 
 
The protocol team will monitor enrollment by [CONTACT_154329], with periodic updates issued 
to sites to inform on current study enrollment by [CONTACT_154329], as needed. At the outset 
of the study, sites will be encouraged to prioritize enrollment of women and African 
American/Black participants, and will be alerted that restrictions on enrollment may later be enacted to achieve enrollment targets. The protocol team, in consultation with the Statistical and Data Management Center, will review the sex  and race distributions after 
approximately 25%, 50%, and 75% of enrollment has occurred. 
 
The DAIDS Clinical Representative s will review and assess select EAE reports for 
potential impact on the study participant safety and protocol conduct per DAIDS policies, guidance documents, and Standard Operating Procedures  (SOPs), as applicable. 
Additionally, the DAIDS clinical representative s and the protocol monitoring team will

participant. An interim review may also be convened if a concern is identified by [CONTACT_163412] s, the study chairs, or study statisticians in consultation with the team. 
See section 10.0 for statistical and other considerations related to interim monitoring. 
 
Detailed plans for study monitoring are outlined in a Study Progress, Data, and Safety Monitoring Plan (SPDSMP) developed by [CONTACT_163413] 
(SDMC) prior to enrollment of the first participant.  
 8.0 CLINICAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES 
 8.1 Toxicity  
 
Only toxicities related to antiretroviral drugs (study -provided or participant- supplied) will 
be considered in the toxicity management section. The grading system is located in the DAIDS AE Grading Table, corrected Version 2.1, July 2017: https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research-sites/daids -adverse-event-grading-tables . 
 
The general guidelines presented in sections 8.1.1, 8.1.2, and 8.1.[ADDRESS_189706] the study leadership team (actg.cmc [EMAIL_3309] ), and the participant should be 
encouraged to stay in study follow -up until 48 weeks.  
 
NOTE: If participants discontinue study treatment due to experiencing Grade 1 or 
2 AEs, the AEs should be recorded as the reason for discontinuation.  
 
8.1.2 Grade 3 
 
Grade 3 AEs or toxicity should be evaluated and managed by [CONTACT_6962]. The A5391 CMC should be notified at [EMAIL_3310] regarding AEs or toxicities that result in a change of study treatment. If the site investigator has compelling evidence that the AE or toxicity was NOT caused by [CONTACT_104841], dosing may continue.  
If the study treatment is temporarily held, the participant should be re-evaluated 
frequently until the AE or toxicity returns to Grade ≤2, at which time the study treatment may be reintroduced at the discretion of the site investigator or according to standard practice.  
 
 45 A5391 
FINAL Version 2.0 
  19Aug2022 
 
If the site investigator determines that an isolated Grade 3 laboratory abnormality 
(lab abnormality without a clinical AE) is related to study treatment, the site has the option of confirming the AE or toxicity before holding the study treatment. 
 
If the same Grade 3 AE or toxicity recurs within 4 weeks of reintroducing the study treatment and is thought to be related to the study treatment (per the site investigator), the study treatment must be permanently discontinued. However, if the same Grade 3 AE or toxicity recurs after 4 weeks, and is not thought to be 
related to the study treatment (per the site investigator), the management 
scheme outlined above may be repeated. 
 
If a participant perm anently discontinues study treatment as a result of the Grade 3 
AE, the site should complete the premature study treatment discontinuation 
evaluations as defined in the SOE  as soon as possible and the participant should 
be followed frequently until resolution of the AE. See section 6.2.4 for management 
of participants who prematurely discontinue study treatment. Participants  should be 
encouraged to stay in study follow -up until week 48. 
 
8.1.3 Grade 4 
 
Participants who develop a Grade 4 symptomatic AE (clinical or laboratory) 
related to study drug will have all study treatment permanently discontinued. The 
study leadership team (actg.cmc [EMAIL_3309] ) must be notified by e-mail 
regarding these toxicities to discuss further management. If participants 
experience Grade 4 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of all study 
medications , the site should ideally complete the premature study treatment 
discontinuation evaluations  as soon as possible per the SOE  and the participants 
should be followed frequently until resolution of the AE . See section 6.2.4 for 
management of participants who prematurely discontinue study treatment. Participants should be encouraged to stay in study follow -up until week 48. 
 
The participant should be re-evaluated frequently until the AE returns to Grade ≤2 
or baseline.  
 
8.1.4 Creatinine Clearance  
 
Creatine clearance should be calculated at screening, entry, and weeks 4, 12, 24, and 48 weeks (or premature discontinuation). Any participant experiencing a calculated CrCl <50 mL/min should have the value repeated within 7 days. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] FTC/3TC  
 
All study participants will be on FTC or 3TC as part of their regimen. Participants 
who experience a confirmed ( two consecutive) reduction in CrCl to <50 mL/min 
should have their FTC or 3TC dose reduced as indicated on the package insert, 
at the discretion of the site investigator. 
 
 46 A5391 
FINAL Version 2.0 
  19Aug2022 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] TDF 
 
Participants who experience a confirmed ( two consecutive) reduction in CrCl to 
<50 mL/min on TDF should have their TDF dose reduced as indicated on the 
package insert, at the discretion of the site investigator.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] TAF 
 
Participants who experience a confirmed ( two consecutive) reduction in CrCl to 
<30 mL/min on TAF should have their TAF dose reduced as indicated on the package insert, at the discretion of the site investigator.  
 
8.1.5 Hyperlactatemia/Lactic Acidosis  
 
The following case definition of symptomatic hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis will be used in this protocol:  
 
New, otherwise unexplained and persistent (≥2 weeks) occurrence of one or more of the following symptoms:  
 
• Nausea and vomiting 
• Abdominal pain or gastric discomfort  
• Abdominal distention  
• Elevated liver function tests  
• Unexplained fatigue  
• Dyspnea 
• Concern for hyperlactatemia/lactic acidosis should be confirmed by [CONTACT_163414]. If 
a lactate level >[ADDRESS_189707] is confirmed , participants  should immediately 
discontinue their study medications and the team ( [EMAIL_3310]) 
should be contact[CONTACT_163415]. 
 
8.[ADDRESS_189708] access to an International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT) trial site, should be 
encouraged to enroll in appropriate IMPAACT studies .

The intrapartum complications, pregnancy, and pregnancy outcome will be recorded on 
the eCRFs. Pregnancies that occur on study should be reported prospectively to t he 
Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. More information is available at www.apregistry.com. Phone: [PHONE_3615]; Fax: 1-800- 800-1052. 
 
Pregnancy Reporting 
Participants who become pregnant while on study drugs and discontinue DOR  due to 
their pregnancy will be asked to remain on study, off study treatment. Sites will complete the premature discontinuation visit within 7 days  after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_056] (except for 
DEXA scan and any aspects deemed by [CONTACT_163416]). If a participant  has completed the study or chooses to discontinue from the study before 
the end of the pregnancy, then site staff should complete a study discontinuation visit within [ADDRESS_189709] the participant regarding pregnancy 
outcome at the end of the pregnancy. Any intrapartum complications, pregnancy, and 
pregnancy outcome for the participant and infant (if known) should be recorded on the eCRFs.

 10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 10.1 General Design Issues  
 
The study’s primary objective is to evaluate if a switch to either DOR + TAF/FTC (or 
TAF/3TC) or DOR  + TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC) results in a difference (less weight gain or 
overall weight loss) in weight change over  48 weeks compared to continued use of RAL, 
DTG, or BIC + TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC) . It is of secondary interest to compare the two 
 48 A5391 
FINAL Version 2.0 
  19Aug2022 
 
switch arms (DOR  + TAF/FTC [or TAF/3TC] versus DOR  + TDF/FTC  [or TDF/3TC]) to 
assess if there are additional weight benefits with a switch to TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC)  
from TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC) . 
 
10.2 Outcome Measures  
 
Primary and secondary outcome measures listed below will be addressed in the study’s 
primary Statistical Analysis Plan, which will define the content of the Primary Analysis Report. This report will form the basis for the primary study manuscript and resul ts

and FTC-TP, measured from DBS , from entry  enrollment to weeks 24 
and 48. 
 10.3 Randomization and Stratification  
 
All eligible participants will be randomized using a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three study arms: 
switch to DOR  + TAF/F TC (or TAF/3TC), switch to DOR  + TDF/FTC  (or TDF/3TC), or 
continued INSTI + TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC), using permuted blocks with institutional 
balancing. Participants will be stratified at randomization by [CONTACT_163417] (African American/Black vs. non-African American/Black). Participant enrollment targets are >50% participants  assigned female sex at birth across all sites and >50% 
African American/Black  participants at US sites . 
 10.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
 
The proposed sample size is 222 participants (74 per arm). It is anticipated that participants will accrue to the study at a rate of 20 participants per month at an estimated 
14 sites (12 US and 2 non-US ); at this rate, the study should fully accrue in 
approximately 11-12 months.  
 
A total of 222 participants will be randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to the three arms. Allowing 
for 15% loss to follow -up this will yield 189 evaluable participants (63 per arm). This 
sample size will provide 80% power to detect an absolute difference of 5% at week 48 
between each switch arm and the control arm (continuing INSTI), assuming the standard 
deviation (SD) of within-participant changes is 9%, using two-sided t-tests with 2.5% alpha level. Each switch arm will be compared to the control arm using a 2.5%  alpha 
level to control the overall type-I error rate. The study is powered to detect a 5% difference in weight between arms, as a 5% absolute difference is considered clinically 
meaningful. 
 
At present, prospective, randomized controlled trial data on weight changes on INSTI + 
TAF/FTC are only available from sub-Saharan African studies (ADVANCE trial, see above), which may differ from the majority of ACTG sites by [CONTACT_2085], social, behavioral, genetic, and other factors. There are also limited data on DOR aside from recent 
abstract data, which showed a median 1.0 kg (IQR -1.2 to 3.9) weight gain at 48 weeks 
among ART -naïve persons initiating DOR in pooled phase 2 and 3 studies  [25]. 
Therefore, the sample size, and specifically the assumed SD, for A5391 is based on 
ACTG A5257 trial data comparing INSTI + TDF/FTC vs non-INSTI  + TDF/FTC. 
 
 50 A5391 
FINAL Version 2.0 
  19Aug2022 
 
In A5257, among individuals who remained on RAL and who had BMI ≥ 30 at 48 weeks, 
the SD for the change in weight from week 48 to week 96 (i.e., approximately 48 weeks) 
was 7% (mean change - 0.03%). During the first 96 weeks, however, where larger 
changes in weight occurred, the SD for the change in weight was 11 %. The 9% SD 
chosen for this study is intermediate of the SDs observed from A5257 and is a 
conservative approach to ensure that A5391 is well powered to detect differences 
between arms. 
 
The table below provides a summary of statistical power based on a range of possible 
SD estimates.

96% 5% 7% 
80% 5% 9% 
61% 5% 11% 
 
10.5 Data and Safety Monitoring 
 
An ACTG -appointed Study Monitoring Committee (SMC) will undertake reviews of 
interim data to ensure safety of study participants and to possibly recommend termination or modification of the study. At SMC reviews, data will be considered as detailed in section 7.4. 
 
At each interim review, the SMC  will review unblinded summaries, by [CONTACT_141585], 
of study status and, including loss to follow -up (LTFU), treatment discontinuations and 
cross-over, and safety, including virologic failures and adverse events. Interim efficacy analyses are not planned. 
 
There are no pre-specified stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_163373], but the SMC should 
consider possible modificati ons or termination on bases of safety concerns or 
operational futility. With regards to safety, if 10% or more of participants on the DOR -
containing arms experienced virologic failure or treatment-related AEs, this would be concerning to the study team. However, the DRIVE -SHIFT phase 3, open- label, 
randomized noninferiority trial showed comparable maintenance of virologic suppression 
among ART -treated persons switched from INSTI-based regimens to DOR/3TC/TDF. 
With respect to operational futility the SMC  should consider the overall and within arm 
LTFU rates, and treatment cross -over rates (particularly those switching from DOR-
containing arm back to an INSTI-containing arm). As a benchmark, an overall LTFU rate 
of 20% or higher would be cause for concern, particularly if a higher rate is observed in 
the INSTI-containing arm where participants are not switched to DOR.  
 
 [ADDRESS_189711] each switch arm (DOR + TAF/FTC [or TAF/3TC] or 
DOR  + TDF/FTC  [or TDF/3TC]), separately, with the control arm (remaining on INSTI + 
TAF/FTC  [or TAF/3TC]). A secondary analysis will then compare the two switch arms 
with each other to determine if there are added effects of switching from TAF/FTC (or 
TAF/3TC)  to TDF/FTC  (or TDF/3TC); the switch arms will be compared regardless of the 
observed results for the primary comparisons. Figure 10.6-1 depi[INVESTIGATOR_163374]. 
 
 
Figure 10.6- 1: Planned comparisons . 
 
NOTE: Analyses will be conducted on the entire trial sample, irrespective of 
history of weight gain (i.e., protocol version at enrollment). History of  >10%  weight 
gain will be a prespecified subgroup, but this subgroup analysis could be limited by [CONTACT_163418], when this information is not required. 
 
10.6.1 Primary Analysis  
 
The primary analysis will compare the percent change in weight (kg) from entry 
to week 48. The mean percent change in weight at week 48 will be compared separately between each of the investigational switch arms and the control arm 
using linear regression adjusting for stratification factors, with a 2.5% type-I 
error rate; corresponding 97.5% confidence intervals (CIs)  will also be provided. 
It is of secondary interest to contrast the two switch arms (see below). The primary analysis will be conducted using intent-to- treat (ITT) principles, in which 
participants will be analyzed according to their randomized study arm, regardless of whether they changed treatment during study follow -up. A 
supplemental analysis will restrict the analysis population to only those who remained on their randomized regimens through week 48. 
 
In the event that participants discontinue the study prior to week 48, imputation methods will be used to estimate weight at week 48. Modern statistical methods to account for loss to follow -up will be considered, such as multiple imputation, 
global sensitivity analysis, or inverse probability of censoring weighting; specific 
details will be discussed in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
 

 [ADDRESS_189712] of TAF on weight gain, the two switch arms will 
be compared to each other. The mean percent change in weight at week 48 will 
be compared between the DOR  + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) arm and the DOR  + 
TDF/FTC (or TDF/3TC) arm using linear regression adjusting for stratification 
factors with a 5% type-I error ; corresponding 95% CI will be provided. 
 
Changes in weight from entry to week 24, changes in minimum waist circumference, and fasting cardiometabolic parameters from entry to weeks 24 
and 48, and changes DEXA measures from entry to week 48 will be analyzed in a similar manner as the analyses of weight changes. Sensiti vity analyses of 
changes in tri glycerides , LDL, and HDL will consider on-study use of lipid-
lowering medications by [CONTACT_4317].  
 
Safety , tolerability , and maintenance of virologic suppression will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_163419] 3 or higher AE or >10% reduction in CrCl, who prematurely discontinued study 
treatment, or who have confirmed post -entry plasma HIV -1 RNA > 200 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, and will be compared separately between each switch arm and the 
control arm via two-sided mid-p Fisher’s exact test, each evaluated with 2.5% type-I error.  
 
Additional longitudinal analyses will evaluate changes in  weight across all study 
visits. Details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
 11.0 PHARMACOLOGY PLAN  
 
DBS cards will be stored to measure concentrations of TFV -DP, both from TDF and 
TAF, and FTC -TP at entry, week 24, and week 48 (or at premature discontinuation).  
Interpretation of the FTC -TP levels requires information on the timing of ART doses over 
the preceding 3 days. Therefore, the date/time of INSTI, DOR, TDF, TAF, and FTC (or 
3TC) doses, depending on study arm, for the three days preceding the entry, week 24, and week [ADDRESS_189713] not be identified by [CONTACT_163420]. Participants will be identified by [CONTACT_163421] (PID) and study identification number (SID) provided by 
[CONTACT_163422]. 
 
 [ADDRESS_189714] of, or in addition to, 
onsite visits to ensure the safety of study participants and data integrity [27]. The 
site will make available study documents for site monitors to review utilizing a 
secure platform that is HIPAA and 21 CFR Part 11 compliant. Potential platform options include: Veeva SiteVault, site-controlled SharePoint or cloud-based portal, direct access to Electronic Medical Record (EMR), and Medidata Rave Imaging Solutions. Other secure platforms that are 21 CFR Part 11 compliant may be utilized, 
as allowed by [CONTACT_163423] (OCSO).

Doravirine for Obese Persons on I ntegrase Inhibitors and T enofovir Alafenamide 
 (The Do IT Study) 
FINAL Version 2.0, dated 19Aug2022  
 
 
 
SHORT TITLE FOR THE STUDY: The Do IT Study 
 
SUMMARY  
 
PURPOSE  This is a research study , and your participation in this study is voluntary.  
 
The purpose of this study is  to see whether obese (body mass index 
≥30 kg/m2) people living with HIV  who are receiving an antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) regimen that includes  an integrase strand transfer inhibitor 
(INSTI) in combination with tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine 
(TAF/FTC ) or tenofovir alafenamide/lamivudine ( TAF/3TC ) could gain 
less weight, or might lose weight, after an ART regimen switch. The study 
will also assess if a switch in ART leads to differences in metabolic  
conditions (i.e., how the body stores and uses energy), cardiovascular 
health (i.e., the heart and blood vessels), and bone health. 
 NUMBER OF  
PARTICIPANTS  There will be [ADDRESS_189727] for 48 weeks  (about 1 year) . Following the first visit, 
you will need to come back  to the clinic after about 4, 12, 24, 36, and [ADDRESS_189728] for 8 hours before a few visits . Each visit may 
take up to 3 hours. You will not need to stay overnight.  
 
STUDY  
TREATMENT Participants age ≥18 years on bictegravir (BIC), dolutegravir (DTG), or 
raltegravir (RAL) with TAF/FTC  or TAF/3TC (depending on location)  will 
be assigned by [CONTACT_3364] 1:1:1 (i.e., equally) to: 
• Doravirine (DOR) with TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC)  
 58 A5391 
FINAL Version 2.0 
  19Aug2022 
 
• DOR with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC)  (or 
TDF/3TC)  
• Continue on their current regimen 
 
DOR will be provided to study participants through the study but 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (TAF/FTC [or TAF/3TC] and TDF/FTC  [or TDF/3TC]) and the INSTI medications for those remaining 
on their current regimen will not be provided by [CONTACT_1758].  
 REQUIRED  
ACTIVITIES  Blood and urine collections  
At most visits, some blood (about 2 to 6 tablespoons) will be collected 
from a vein in your arm. 
At a few visits, you will be asked to provide a urine sample. 
 
Question naires  
At the Entry Visit, you will complete questionn aires on food security and 
physical activity. At each visit after entry you will complete a questionnaire on medication adherence. 
 
Special procedures  
You will have a d ual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at two 
visits to measure your lean muscle and body fat, and your bone density.  
 RISKS Risks of participating in this study include side effects from drugs used in 
this study  or the risk of loss of HIV -1 viral suppression (i.e., a rise in the 
level of virus in the blood, which may require a change in your HIV 
medications) . 
 
BENEFITS No direct benefits should be expected from participating in this study.  
 
You may have weight loss, but no guarantee can be made. 
 
OTHER CHOICES   Instead of being in this study, you have the option of continuing with your 
current treatment or starting a new treatment under the care of your 
regular doctor or other health care provider.  
 
 INTRODUCTION  
 
You are being asked to take part in this research study because you have HIV (the virus that 
causes AIDS), you have a body mass index that is in the obese range, and you are taking 
an antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen that contains an integrase strand transfer inhibitor 
(INSTI; a class of drug that includes bictegravir, dolutegravir, and raltegravir ) combined with 
tenofovir alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC)  or tenofovir alafenamide/lamivudine (TAF/3TC) .

This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH). The doctor in charge of this 
study at this site is: (insert name [CONTACT_789] ). Before you decide if you want to be a 
part of this study, we want you to know about the study.  
 
This is a consent form. It gives you information about this study. The study staff will talk with you 
about this information. You are free to ask questions about this study at any time. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will get a copy to keep.  
  
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
Weight gain after starting  ART is common, but recent studies have found that some people with 
HIV who are taking an INSTI  combined with TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC ) may gain more weight than 
people taking other drug combinations. Weight gain on ART can be healthy for persons who are 
underweight when they start treatment. However, an increasing number of people with HIV 
(PWH) are obese, which may increase their risk for cardiovascular (heart) and metabolic 
diseases (such as diabetes).  
 It is currently unknown whether people who are obese and taking an INSTI + TAF/FTC (or 
TAF/3TC)  regimen could either slow the rate of weight gain or could actually lose weight by 
[CONTACT_163429].  The primary purpose of this study is to see if obese PWH who are taking an INSTI + TAF/FTC 
(or TAF/3TC)  regimen could either slow their rate of weight gain or lose weight within about 1 
year if they switch to a regimen containing doravirine ( DOR ; a newer, non-nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor medication). The study will also try to see if participants changing from 
TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC)  to TDF/FTC  (or TDF/3TC) will experience less additional weight gain or 
a reduction in overall body weight at 48 weeks compared to persons continued on an INSTI + 
TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC)  combination. Additionally, the study will see whether a change in ART 
can affect things like waist circumference, metabolic and cardiovascular health, fat and lean 
mass body composition, bone health, and maintenance of virologic suppression. Finally, the 
study will look at the safety and tolerability  of DOR plus either TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC) versus 
TDF/FTC  (or TDF/3TC) . 
  WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO IF I AM IN THIS STUDY? 
 
When you enter this study , you will be randomized (assigned by [CONTACT_3364], as if by [CONTACT_163430]) to 
one of three study groups . Because the randomization is equal, you will have a 33% chance of 
being in any of the following study groups:  
1. Group 1: You will continue taking TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC) but will stop your INSTI and take 
DOR; your ART will be DOR  + TAF/FTC (or TAF/3TC)  for 48 weeks . 
2. Group 2: You will stop your INSTI and TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC)  and will switch to DOR  + 
TDF/FTC  (or TDF/3TC)  for 48 weeks . 
3. Group 3: You will continue your current ART of an INSTI + TAF/FTC  (or TAF/3TC)  for 48 
weeks .

DOR will be provided to study participants in Groups 1 and 2 through the study . Nucleoside 
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (TAF/FTC [or TAF/3TC] and TDF/FTC [or TDF/3TC]) will not be 
provided by [CONTACT_1758].  
 
The study will last 48 weeks  (approximately 1 year) . After the Entry Visit, you will return to the 
clinic  at 4, 12, 24, 36, and [ADDRESS_189729] (have nothing to eat or drink other than medications and water for at least 8 
hours) before the first visit. You will be asked to fast again before the visits [ADDRESS_189730] visits, some blood (about 2 to 6 tablespoons) will be collected from a vein in your arm, 
you will have a brief physical exam  including measurement of weight and waist circumference, 
and you will be asked a series of questions about your health, how you are taking your study treatment, what you have been eating and drinking while in the study, and your recent physical 
activity. At a few visits, you will be asked to provide a urine sample. At the Entry Visit you will also have a complete physical exam, medication and medical histories, and exercise and diet education. At the Entry Visit and then again after [ADDRESS_189731] a dual -energy X-ray 
absorptiometry (DEXA) scan to measure your lean muscle and body fat, and your bone density . 
This will take approximately [ADDRESS_189732] on everyone who is screened for an ACTG study. As part of your Screening Visit, some demographic (for example, age, gender, race), clinical ( for 
example, disease condition, diagnosis, height, and weight), and laboratory (for example, CD4 
cell count, viral load) information will be collected from you. We also will collect information on 
whether you use (or have used) injection drugs.  
  
We will collect this information even if you do not enroll in this study so that ACTG researchers 
may determine whether there are patterns and/or common reasons why people do not join a study.

CAN I CHOOSE THE TYPES OF RESEARCH THAT MY SAMPLES AND INFORMATION ARE 
USED FOR?  
 Some of your blood will be stored as what we call “samples” and used for study -required 
metabolic , cardiovascular, immunologic, study drug levels, and virologic  testing.  
Identifiers (for example, your name [CONTACT_18131]) will be removed from your samples and 
from any private information that has been collected about you. This means that no one looking at the labels or at other information will be able to know that the samples or information came from you.  
 
The tests described above are required by [CONTACT_15365]. If you do not agree to the storage or 
testing that has been described above, you should not join this study .  
  More information about the storage of extra samples and use in other studies are provided in 
Attachment A . 
 
 HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 About 222 people will take part in this study  (3 treatment groups of 74 people each).  
  HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THIS STUDY?  
 You will be in this study for about 48 weeks .  
  WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE ME OFF THIS STUDY EARLY?  
 The study doctor may need to take you off the study early without your permission if:  
 
• The study is stopped or cancelled  
• You are not able to attend the study visits as required by [CONTACT_163431]:  
 
• Continuing the study treatment may be harmful to you  
• You need a drug that you may not take while on the study  
• You are not able to take the study treatment as required by [CONTACT_1758]  
• You become pregnant  
• Your doctor (primary care provider) requests that you come off the study  because they 
think that the study is no longer in your best interest  
 
If you must stop taking the study treatment before the study is over, the study doctor may ask 
you to continue to be part of the study and return for some study visits and procedures. 
 
 [ADDRESS_189733] the study, how would 
that drug be provided?  
During the study:  
 
If you must permanently stop taking DOR  before your study participation is over, the study staff 
will discuss other options that may be of benefit to you.  
After the study: 
 After you have completed your study participation, the study will not be able to continue to 
provide you with DOR . If continuing to take this  or similar drugs  would be of benefit to you, the 
study staff will discuss how you may be able to obtain them  through your usual health care. 
  WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 Risks from participating in this study include risks from  the study procedures and risks 
associated with a switch to different ART. 
 Study procedures: 
• Blood collection: The study staff will use a standard-sized blood-drawing needle, but this 
may still cause pain, redness, soreness, bruising, or infection at the needle entry point. 
Rarely , some people faint. 
• Whole body DEXA scan: This test requires exposure to x -rays. The amount of exposure is 
approximately equal to the exposure you would receive over a period of about 9 days fr om 
natural background sources.  
 
Study medications:  
Participation in this study may include changing one or two of your current anti -HIV medications. 
All medications used in this study have obtained regulatory approval by [CONTACT_33438] (US sites) or appropriate national regulatory bodies (non- US sites). This means 
that regulators have reviewed the existing evidence and concluded that the medications’ clinical 
benefits (i.e., how much the medications improve health) for patients outweigh the risks. The 
drugs in this study may have side effects, some of which are listed below. Please note that these lists do not include all the side effects seen with these drugs. These lists include the more serious or common side effects with a known or possible relationship to the study drugs . It is 
very important that you tell your study doctor about any changes in your medical condition while 
taking part in the study. At any time during the study, if you believe you are experiencing any of these side effects, you have the right to ask questions about possible and/or known risks.  
 There is a risk of serious and/or life- threatening side effects when non-study medications are 
taken with the study drugs. For your safety, you must tell the study doctor or nurse about all medications you are taking before you start the study and you must ask for approval before 
taking any new medication while you are on the study. If you have questions about additional side effects, please ask the medical staff at your site.

Adverse Reactions R elated to All Co mbination Antiretroviral Drugs  
Treatment failure:  
When people with viral suppression switch to a different ART regimen, there is  a risk that the 
HIV virus will become detectable again in the blood. This is called “treatment failure,” and it is 
usually caused by [CONTACT_84096]’ resistance to the new drug. This type of resistance is usually 
caused by [CONTACT_89483] (or changes) in the virus that can be found by [CONTACT_163432]  (i.e., the molecular ‘code' which is copi[INVESTIGATOR_163375], 
and determines how a virus affects the body and respons es to treatment). This is known as 
performing an HIV genotype (i.e., a test that determines the molecular code of the HIV virus to 
predict which medications will be effective against it) . HIV genotypes are often performed when 
someone’s  ART regimen appears to fail . Some times, the genotype does not find a resistance 
mutation, but this is rare. Before enrollment, the study staff will review any prior genotypes in 
your record to check for mutations that are known to affect how well DOR or TDF might work for 
you. If any are found, you will be told about them. You will not be eligible for the study if you 
have any of these mutations. If you are at a site that does not perform routine HIV genotypes, 
the study staff will review your record for any suspected instances of treatment failure; if these are present, you will be informed that you do not qualify to participate in the study.  
 The drugs used in this study may have side effects, some of which are listed below. Please note that these lists do not include all the side effects seen with these drugs. These lists include the  
more serious or common side effects with a known or possible relationship. If you have questions concerning additional study drug side effects please ask the medical staff at your site.  
 
Use of Combination Antiretroviral Drugs:  
In some people with advanced HIV infection, symptoms from other infections or certain 
diseases may occur soon after starting combination anti -HIV treatment but can also occur later. 
Some of these symptoms may be life threatening. If you start having new symptoms, or notice that existing symptoms are getting worse after starting your antiretroviral therapy, tell your healthcare provider right away.   
Adverse Reactions R elated to all Nucleoside Analogues  
Lactic acidosis (elevated lactic acid levels in the blood) and severe hepatomegaly (enlarged 
liver) with steatosis (fatty liver) that may result in liver failure, and other complications and death 
have been reported with the use of antiretroviral nucleoside analogues alone or in combination. The liver complications and death have been seen more often in women on these drug 
regimens. Some nonspecific symptoms that might indicate lactic acidosis  include:  
• Unexplained  weight loss  
• Stomach discomfort 
• Nausea 
• Vomiting 
• Fatigue  
• Cramps  
• Muscle  pain 
• Cold or blue hands and feet 
• W eakness  
 64 A5391 
FINAL Version 2.0 
  19Aug2022 
 
• Dizziness  
• Shortness  of breath 
 
Please contact [CONTACT_163433].  Rarely, TDF, TAF, 3TC and FTC are associated with severe liver problems that can cause 
death. Some symptoms  associated with this include: 
• Skin or the white part of your eyes turns yellow  
• Dark “tea-colored” urine  
• Light-colored stools  
• Loss of appetite for several days or longer  
• Nausea, or stomach-area pain  
 If you are infected with both h epatitis B and HIV, the use of 3TC, FTC, TDF, and TAF have an 
additional risk related to liver problems. Your liver function tests may increase, and symptoms (listed above) associated with hepatitis (an acute inflammation of the liver) may worsen if these drugs are stopped. Although most of these cases have resolved without treatment, some deaths 
have been reported. 
 
Risks of doravirine (DOR), tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), 
emtricitabi ne (FTC), and Lamivudine (3TC)  
The most common adverse reactions reported with use of any of these drugs  are: 
• Nausea 
• Upset stomach 
• Headache 
• Fatigue or feeling tired  
• Diarrhea 
• Abdominal pain 
• Dizziness  
 
Less common adverse reactions reported with use of DOR, FTC, and 3TC  are:  
• Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_163376]  
• Elevation of liver function tests , which indicates some degree of liver inflammation  
 
Other Adverse Reactions Associated  with DOR  
• Abnormal dreams or nightmares  
• Distraction  
• Rash  
 
Other Adverse Reactions associated with TDF  
• Worsening or new kidney damage or failure  
• Bone pain  
• Bone changes such as thinning and softening (this may increase the risk of breakage )  
• Muscle pain and muscle weakness  
 
 65 A5391 
FINAL Version 2.0 
  19Aug2022 
 
Less common adverse reactions to TDF include:  
• Shortness of breath  
• Rash  
• Allergic reaction. Symptoms may include: 
o Fever 
o Rash  
o Upset stomach  
o Vomiting 
o Loose or watery stools  
o Abdominal pain 
o Body achiness  
o Shortness of breath  
o A general feeling of illness  
o Swelling of the face, lips, and/or tongue.  
 
Other side effects associated with Lamivudine (3TC) or Emtricitabine (FTC ):  
• Numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands or feet 
• Depression  
• Rash  
• Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), which may cause death. If you develop pancreatitis, you may have one or more of the following: stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting.  
• Abnormal pancreatic and liver function blood tests  
 
 ARE THERE RISKS RELATED TO PREGNANCY?  
 
Persons who are pregnant, intend to become pregnant during the duration of the study, or are 
currently breast-feeding are not eligible to enroll. Anyone who is  participating in sexual activity 
that could lead to the participant becoming pregnant must agree to use contraception while on DOR  (approximately 48 weeks) and for 8 weeks after the end of the study .  
 
Acceptable forms of contraception are: 
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Hormone-based contraceptive  
• Partner/s’s  sterilization (in other words , vasectomy, and sterilized partner must be the sole 
partner of the participant )  
 
If you become pregnant while on study, the study staff would like to obtain information from you 
about the outcome of the pregnancy (even if it is after your participation in the study ends). If you are taking ART  when you become pregnant, your pregnancy will be reported to an 
international database that collects information about pregnancies in persons taking ART. This 
report will not use your name [CONTACT_163436].

ATTACHMENT A  
 
When samples are no longer  needed for this study,  the ACTG may want  to use them  in other  
studies  and share them  with other researchers.  These samples  are called “extra samples.” 
The ACTG will only  allow  your extra samples  to be used in other studies  if you agree to this. 
If you have any questions, please ask.  
 
Identifiers will be removed from your samples and from any private information that has been collected about you. This means that no one looking at the labels or at other information will know that the samples or information came from you.  
 Extra samples are stored  in a secure central place called a repository.  Your samples  will be 
stored  in the ACTG repository  in the [LOCATION_002]. 
 There is no limit on how  long your extra samples  will be stored.  
[Site: Revise the previous  sentence to insert limits if your  regulatory authority  imposes  them.]  
 
When a researcher wants to use your samples and information, his or her  research plan must 
be approved by [CONTACT_163426]. Also, the researcher’s institutional review board (IRB) or ethics 
committee (EC) will review his or her plan. [Site: If review by [CONTACT_106954]’s IRB/EC/RE is also 
required, insert a sentence stating this.] IRBs/ECs protect the rights and well -being of people in 
research. If the research plan is approved, the ACTG will send your samples to the researcher’s location. This means that researchers who are not part of the protocol team may use your 
samples without asking you again for your consent.  
 
You will not be paid for your samples. Also, a researcher may make  a new scientific  discovery  
or product based on the use of your samples.  If this happens,  there is no plan to share any 
money  with you.  The researcher is not likely  to ever know  who you are. 
 You may withdraw your consent for research on your extra samples at any time and the specimens will be discarded.  Please choose the response that matches what you want by [CONTACT_163435]. Please ask the staff any questions that you have before you indicate your selection.  
 
Research without Human Genetic Testing  
If you agree, your extra samples may be stored (with usual protection of your identity) and used for ACTG -approved HIV-related research that does not include human genetic testing.  
 ____ (initials) I understand and I agree to this storage and possible use of my samples.  
 
OR 
____ (initials) I understand but I do not agree to this storage and possible use of my samples.  Research with Human Genetic Testing  
The ACTG has two different studies that collect samples for genetic testing.

If you live in the US, this study is called ACTG A5128, Plan for Obtaining Informed Consent to 
Use Stored Human Biological Materials (HBM) for Currently Unspecified Analyses.  
If you live outside of the US, this study is called ACTG A5243, Plan for Obtaining Human 
Biological Samples at Non-US Clinical Research Sites for Currently Unspecified Genetic 
Analyses.  
 Your site might ask you if you would like to participate in one of these studies if it is being done where you live. If you would like to participate, you will sign a separate consent form.  
 Your  extra samples will not be used for human genetic testing unless you sign and date 
a consent form for A5128 or A5243.

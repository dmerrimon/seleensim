TITLE An 8-Week Open-Label, Sequential, Repeated Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Alirocumab in Children and Adolescents with Heterozygous 
Familial Hypercholesterolemia Followed by [CONTACT_56404]. 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL 
LOCATION Multi-center, multi-national. 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT Phase 2. 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) Primary objective: 
• To evaluate the effect of alirocumab administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) or 
every 4 weeks (Q4W) on low-density lipopr otein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels 
after 8 weeks of treatment in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (heFH) patients aged of 8 to 17 years, with LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL  
(3.37 mmol/L) on optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy ±  other lipid 
modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (LMTs) or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of 
intolerance to statins, for at least 4 weeks prior to the screening period.  
Secondary objective(s): 
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab. 
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics profile of alirocumab. 
• To evaluate the effects of alirocumab on other lipid parameters  (eg, Apolipoprotein B (Apo B), non- high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(non-HDL-C), Total-Cholesterol (T otal-C), high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (HDL-C), Lipoprotein (a ) (Lp[a]), Triglycerides (TGs), 
Apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) levels after 8 weeks of treatment.  
• To evaluate the development of anti- alirocumab antibodies. 
STUDY DESIGN This study is an open-label, dose-finding,  sequential group, multi-national, multi-
center study with repeated dose of subcutaneous (SC) alirocumab injections administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) in children and 
adolescents aged of 8 to 17 years with heFH having LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL 
(3.37 mmol/L) despi[INVESTIGATOR_56346] ± other lipid 
modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (LMTs) or a stable dose of non-statin LMTs in case of 
intolerance to statins, for at least [ADDRESS_61517] 3 cohorts, and 12 weeks for Cohort 4. Each independent cohort below will 
include approximately 10 patients with no less than 4 patients in each body weight 
(BW) category: 
• Cohort 1 will receive 30 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg and 50 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg. 
• Cohort 2 will receive 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg and 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg. 
• Cohort 3 will receive 75 mg Q4W for BW <50kg and 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. 
• Cohort 4 will receive 150 mg Q4W for BW<50 kg and 300 mg Q4W for BW >
50kg. 
For each cohort, the study consists of a main phase and an optional extension phase.  The main phase is comprised of 3 periods: screening (including run-in, 
if applicable), open-label dose finding treatment, and follow-up only for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, and 2 periods: screening (including r un-in, if applicable), open-label dose

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 4 finding treatment, but no follow-up period fo r Cohort 4. The extension period is an 
open-label extension period that will be offered to all patients, whatever the cohort. 
STUDY DESIGN MAIN PHASE 
Screening Period: 
• An up to 6 week (+1 week) screening period to allow eligibility to be 
established. 
Patients already on a stable LMT(s) (ie, stable optimal dose of statin ± other stable LMTs or stable dose of non- statin LMTs in statin-intolerant 
patients for at least 4 weeks prio r to screening LDL-C being obtained) and 
with heFH diagnosis confirmed by [CONTACT_56405] 2 weeks if meeting all other eligibility criteria.   
The optimal dose of statin is defined as the dose prescribed based on 
regional practice or local guidelines or is the dose that is maximally 
tolerated due to adverse effects on higher doses. For patients not 
receiving maximally tolerated dose of statin, statin intensification should be carefully considered prior to inclusion in this study in order to ensure 
that the addition of a non-statin LDL-C lowering therapy (ie, alirocumab) 
would be the next appropriate step in the management of the patient’s hypercholesterolemia.  The highest dos e of statin should not exceed the 
maximum labeled dose of statin for pediatric patients as per the local prescribing information.    
Patients not already on a stable LMT(s), as defined above, for at least  
4 weeks, will perform a “run-in” period as required to meet this eligibility 
criterion.  Patients eligible for the run-in period are expected to fulfill the 
LDL-C eligibility criterion at the en d of the run-in period.  It is not 
authorized to select patients treated with statin de novo to avoid unstable 
LMT treatment during the screening period. 
Patients with suspected heFH but without confirmation by [CONTACT_56406] e criteria will be asked to undergo 
genetic testing.  If they do not consent to this testing, they will not be eligible to participate in this study. 
Laboratory testing and other assessm ents will be performed during this 
period, but not all assessments need to be completed at the same visit.     
• Of note, all patients who are successfully  screened for Cohort 1 and are 
not included in Cohort 1, due to the appropriate Cohort 1 weight group 
being fully enrolled, may participate in Cohort 2, but only after eligibility, 
including all safety assessments, is reconfirmed. Patients who are 
successfully screened for Cohort 2 but are not enrolled, due to the 
appropriate Cohort 2 weight group being fully enrolled, may participate in 
Cohort 3, without the need to repeat the run-in/screening period.  In such a 
circumstance, the run-in/screening per iod from Cohort 2 will substitute for 
the run-in/screening period for Cohort 3 if there is no more than 3 months 
between eligibility confirmation and inclusion. 
Open-Label Dose Finding Treatment Period: 
• An open-label dose finding treatment period of 8 weeks with alirocumab 
for Cohorts 1, 2 and 3, but 12 weeks for Cohort 4. Four independent cohorts (as described above) will be administered SC alirocumab 
injections Q2W or Q4W in a sequent ial enrollment. The DMC will review 
data on a regular basis during the dose finding treatment period. After Cohort 1 completes the open-label dose finding treatment period, the DMC 
will continue to review the safety data and make a recommendation on

Once enrollment is completed for Cohort 2, then this will immediately be 
followed by [CONTACT_56407] 3 (ie, sequential enrollment).  Cohort 4 
is an independent cohort with a later start date.  
• Cohorts 1 and 2 (Q2W): Alirocumab injections will be prepared from vials by [CONTACT_32335] (or equivalent).  Alirocumab injections will be 
administered at Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6.  The Weeks 0 and 4 alirocumab 
injections will be administered at the clinical site by [CONTACT_7893].  The Weeks 2 and 6 alirocumab injections will be administered at the clinical 
site by [CONTACT_56408]’s home by a health care professional, 
depending upon local arrangements and preferences of the 
investigator/patient.   
• Cohort 3 (Q4W): Alirocumab injections will be prepared from vials by [CONTACT_32335] (or equivalent).  Alirocumab injections will be administered at 
Weeks 0 and 4 at the clinical site by [CONTACT_7893].   
• Cohort 4 (Q4W): Alirocumab injections will be administered with pre-filled 
syringes by [CONTACT_7893]. Alirocumab injections will be administered at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 8 at the clinical site by [CONTACT_7893]. 
• The lipid results from specimens obtained during the open-label dose finding treatment period will be masked for the clinical site/Investigator and 
patients.  No attempts should be made by [CONTACT_56409]’s lipid va lues independently evaluated after entry 
into the open-label dose finding treatment period and until the final  follow-up visit for Cohorts 1 to 3, and the entry into the OLE period for Cohort 4 
Follow-Up Period, only for Cohort 1 to Cohort 3: 
• A follow-up period (off treatment) of 6 (Cohort 3) or 8 weeks  
(Cohorts 1 & 2) after the end of open- label dose finding treatment period 
visit.  For the first [ADDRESS_61518] injection for Cohorts 1 & 2 is Week 6 and for Cohort 3 it is Week 4.   
The daily optimal dose of statin therapy or of other LMT (if applicable) should be 
stable from screening through the end of the fo llow-up visit unless there is a safety 
concern, as per the Investigator’s judgment.   
At the end of the follow-up period of the main phase, patients enrolled in Cohorts 1-[ADDRESS_61519] entry into the Phase 3 study, depending on the 
time of site initiation.   
STUDY DESIGN EXTENSION PHASE 
Open-label extension period: 
• For Cohorts 1- 3, all doses / dose regimens of alirocumab administered 
during the open-label dose finding treat ment period of the main phase are 
expected to be efficacious.  Thus, the initial dose of alirocumab that will be 
administered Q2W or Q4W during the OL E period, will be a continuation of 
the same doses / dose regimens administered during the open-label dose finding treatment period of the main phase.  However, once the final 
optimal doses of alirocumab for the Phase 3 study are selected and device is available, treatment will be adjusted as needed to these final optimal 
doses, based on each patient’s body we ight at the time of the dose

• For Cohort 4: If patients enter the OLE phase, patients will continue on 
their doses from the main phase. If patients decline entry into the OLE 
phase, their treatment will stop. 
• For Cohorts [ADDRESS_61520] (or equivalent) or s upplied as prefilled syringes (PFS) 
depending on availability and additional considerations. Vials used for 
extension phase will be switched to PFS when available.  
- If the PFS is available in the extension phase, then patients may 
either switch from alirocumab inject ions prepared from vials to PFS or 
directly initiate PFS (depending on patient’s date of entry into the 
extension phase).  After appropriate training, the parent/guardian or 
patient (if appropriate) will adminis ter the PFS at home or another 
preferred location. In certain cases, alternative arrangements may be 
made for the administration of the PFS.   
- If the PFS is not available in the extension phase, then alirocumab 
injections prepared from vials will be administered at the clinical site 
(by [CONTACT_7893]) or at the patient’s home or another preferred 
location contingent upon alternative arrangements being made for such an administration.   
• The alirocumab administration during the OLE period will continue until at 
least 10 weeks (corresponding to the wash out period) before initiation of 
the pediatric Phase [ADDRESS_61521] alirocumab injection in December 2018. 
• The lipid levels will be communicated to the investigator during the OLE 
period. If there is a need to adjust the degree of LDL-C lowering, the daily 
dose of statin should NOT be decreased, except in case of medical 
reason. The investigator has the option to discontinue alirocumab, or to 
adjust other LMT (if applicable). Increases in dose of any background LMT 
are allowed throughout the OLE, if needed. 
Patients will be instructed to follow a diet in accordance with the American Academy 
of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines (1) or equivalent throughout the entire study (ie, both 
phases).

ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE MAIN PHASE 
Screening period: 
The screening period is up to 6 weeks (+ 1 week), with 1 to 2 visits that are 
anticipated, depending on the duration of  stable LMT dosing and the need for 
mandatory heFH genetic testing. 
Patients can be enrolled during this period as soon as eligibility is confirmed.   
Open-label dose finding treatment period: 
For Cohorts 1 to 3, visits schedule from entry into the open-label dose finding 
treatment period: baseline Visit (V2, Week  0) and then every 2 weeks (ie, Weeks 2, 
4, 6) until the end of the open-label dose findi ng period (Week 8). T he visits at Week 
[ADDRESS_61526] either at t he clinical site or patient’s home, depending 
upon local arrangements and preferences of the investigator/patient. 
For Cohort 4, visits schedule from entry into the open-label dose finding treatment 
period: baseline, Visit (V2, Week 0), and then every 4 weeks (ie, Weeks 0, 4, and 8) until the end of the open-label dose finding period (Week 12) will take place at the 
clinical site. Visits at Week 2 and W eek 6 will be a phone call and at Week 10 will be 
at the clinical site. 
Follow-up period, only for Cohort 1 to Cohort 3: 
Follow-up visits will take place [ADDRESS_61527] alirocumab injection 
administered during the open-label dose-finding treatment period.  This corresponds 
to Week 12 and Week 16 for Cohorts 1 & 2 or Week 10 and Week 14 for Cohort 3.  
The Week 10 or Week 12 visit will be conducted through a phone call if there is no 
safety concern by [CONTACT_093]. 
EXTENSION PHASE 
Open-label extension (OLE) period: 
After successful completion of Week 16 visi t for Cohorts 1 & [ADDRESS_61528] at Week 20, Week 24, Week  28 and then every 12 weeks thereafter for 
assessments for Cohorts 1 & 2.  Visits will take place at Week 18, Week 22,  Week 26 and then every 12 weeks thereafter for assessments for Cohort 3.  Depending on the clinical supplies and/or alternative contingency plans, more 
frequent visits such as every 2 weeks (for  Cohorts 1 & 2) or every 4 weeks (for 
Cohort 3) may be required. Visits will conti nue until visit end of OLE at least [ADDRESS_61529] alirocumab injection (with a follow-up phone call at least [ADDRESS_61530] alirocumab administration) before the initiation of the pediatric Phase [ADDRESS_61531] IMP of each cohort.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination: 
No power sample size calculations were performed for the main phase. A sample 
size of 10 patients per cohort is empi[INVESTIGATOR_56350] 1 studies (R727-CL-904 and R727-CL-1001) conducted in adults. No less 
than 4 patients with BW <50 kg and no less than 4 patients with BW ≥ 50 kg will be 
enrolled in 4 independent cohorts (Cohort 1,  Cohort 2, Cohort 3, and Cohort 4), 
which will allow the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) profile and safety of different alirocumab doses/dose regimen in each BW category 
and to compare with PK/PD profile and safety observed in adult patients. 
Analysis population: 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the m odified intent-to-treat (mITT) population 
defined as all patients receiving at least one dose or partial dose of alirocumab, with 
a baseline LDL-C available and with at leas t one LDL-C value available in the period 
from first alirocumab injection to last a lirocumab injection + 21 days (for Cohorts 1 
and 2) or + 35 days (for Cohorts 3 and 4) during the main phase. 
Safety analyses will be performed on Safety population which consists of patients 
receiving at least one dose or partial dose of alirocumab. 
Primary analysis: There will be no formal statistical test for the primary endpoint, efficacy analyses will 
be descriptive. 
The primary analysis will be based on an on- treatment approach, and will use LDL-C 
values collected during the efficacy treatm ent period. The efficacy treatment period 
is defined as the period from first alirocum ab injection to last alirocumab injection + 
21 days (for Cohorts 1 & 2) or + 35 days (for Cohorts 3 and 4) during the open-label 
dose finding treatment period. 
The percent change from baseline in calc ulated LDL-C at Week [ADDRESS_61533] model with repeated measures (MMRM) 
approach. All on-treatment data available at Week 4 and Week 8 will be used and 
missing data will be accounted for by [CONTACT_56412]. The model will include the 
fixed categorical effects of alirocumab dose/dose regimen 30 mg Q2W (<50 kg), 
40 mg Q2W (<50 kg), 50 mg Q2W ( ≥50 kg), 75 mg Q2W ( ≥50 kg), 75 mg Q4W 
(<50 kg) ,150 mg Q4W ( ≥50 kg), 150 mg Q4W (<50 kg) and 300 mg Q4W ( ≥50 kg), 
time point (Week 4, Week 8), dose-by-tim e point interaction, as well as, the 
continuous fixed covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baseline value-by-time 
point interaction. 
LS mean with 95% confidence intervals will be provided for each alirocumab dose. 
In addition, LS mean with 95% confidence intervals will be provided for each cohort 
using appropriate contrasts. 
Additionally, for Cohort 4 only, the percent  change from baseline in calculated LDL-C 
at Week 12 will be analyzed in the mITT  population using the same MMRM model 
as for the primary endpoint but including all on-treatment corresponding data 
available at Week 4, Week  8, Week 10, and Week 12. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints: 
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed using the same MMRM model as for the 
primary endpoint.

alirocumab injections prepared fr om vials will be administered at the site (by [CONTACT_7893]) or at the patient’s home or anot her preferred location contingent upon alternative arrangements being made for such an 
administration. Depending on the clinical supplies and/or alternative contingency plans, more frequent clinic visits such as ev ery [ADDRESS_61543] visit of the OLE period from the extension phase will overlap with the final visit of the follow-up period from the m ain phase.

e Alirocumab administration will occur every 2 weeks or every 4 wee ks.  Prior to each alirocumab administration, a local anesthet ic may be utilized (as per the Investigator). Alirocumab injections prepared from vials 
by [CONTACT_32335] (or equivalent) will be administered at the clinical site (by [CONTACT_7893]) or at the patient’s home or ano ther preferred location contingent upon alternative arrangements being made for such an 
administration. The last scheduled injection will take place 2 weeks or 4 weeks before the end-of-OLE visit for the Q2W regimen  or Q4W regimen, respectively.   
f Patients who will switch to or directly initiate prefilled syringes, will undergo trai ning prior to alirocumab administration. The parent/guardian or patient (if appropriate) w ill be trained to administer the injections with 
the use of open-label alirocumab injection. Additional visits for training can take place at the discretion of the Investigator or parent/guardian. Other rele vant training information will al so be provided such as storage 
of device, etc. Patients will also have t he option of dose admini stration at home by a health care professional, depending on l ocal arrangements and preferences of the investigator/patient. 
g Patients who will switch to or directly initiate prefilled syringes (PFS), should hav e a kit(s) dispensed c ontaining alirocumab  PFS.  Along with kit dispensation, the treatment administration package should be given 
as well as the patient diary and injection instruction manual, as needed. 
h Patients who will switch to or directly initiate prefilled syringes, will have alirocum ab administration every 2 weeks or every  4 weeks at home or another preferred location.  Prior to each alirocumab administration, a 
local anesthetic may be utilized that  has been provided by [CONTACT_779].  
i Prior to any laboratory testing, the site may ut ilize a local anesthetic as per the Investigator. 
j Hematology includes: complete blood cell count (CBC) including hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell c ount with differential count, and platelets. Chemistry includes: glucose, sodium, 
potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorous, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), tota l protein, albumin, and γGT.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism, characterized by 
[CONTACT_56416] w-density lipoprotein cholesterol (L DL-C) that lead to premature 
atherosclerosis and cardi ovascular disease (CVD) ( 2). This disorder has a high prevalence in 
Caucasian populations, where an estimated [ADDRESS_61565] 
3 different genes that code for proteins involved in hepatic clea rance of low density lipoprotein 
cholesterol (LDL-C) can cause FH. These include  mutations in the gene coding for the low 
density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) that re moves LDL-C from the circulation, and less 
commonly, in the gene for apolipoprotein (Apo) B, which is the major protein of the LDL-C particle. In rare cases, the gene coding for PC SK9, an enzyme involved in degrading the LDL-R 
(gain of function mutation), is mutated. Additionally, rare mutations in LDL receptor adaptor 
protein 1 (LDLRAP1), a protein which interacts with the LDL receptor or signal transducing 
adaptor family member 1 (STAP1) gene have been  noted.  In all cases, this results in an 
accumulation of LDL-C in the plasma from bi rth, and subsequent development of tendon 
xanthomas, xanthelasmas, atheromata, and CVD. 
FH is the most clearly documented to have im portant cardiovascular consequences beginning in 
childhood ( 3). Even though cardiovascular events are rare in childhood, children with heFH 
already have functional and morphological changes of the vessel wall as illustrated by [CONTACT_56417]-mediated dilatation of  the brachial artery ( 4) and an increased intima media thickness of the 
carotid artery (cIMT), with a progression rate fo r cIMT of approximately double to that observed 
in unaffected siblings ( 3, 5).  Both are surrogate markers for atherosclerotic vascular disease ( 6) 
and, thus, indicate that the athe rosclerotic process has already been initiated early in childhood. 
Indeed, there is now strong evidence that lesions  of atherosclerosis found in adults begin in 
childhood and are progressive throughout the life span (7, 8). These findings strongly suggest that 
to be effective at preventing Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), prevention must begin decades prior to the onset of symptoms (9). 
Because of the high risk of progression to premat ure clinical CVD associated with these findings, 
pediatric guidelines recommend LDL-C lowering intervention and specific lipid targets for 
children and adolescents with heFH. An LDL-C level of <130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) is considered 
acceptable and <110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) ideal for children with heFH ( 10, 11, 12, 1), or the 
achievement of ≥ 50% reduction in LDL cholesterol ( 10). 
Recently, the American Heart Association (AHA) has modified the guidelines, suggesting statins supplant bile acid sequestrants not only as first-line treatment but also at a younger age (8 versus 
10 years of age) ( 10). These revised recommendations were supported by [CONTACT_30255] (AAP) ( 1), as well as and in the recommendations from the National Lipid 
Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia, in which it is mentioned that statins are the preferred initial pharmacologic treatment in children with FH ( 13). The highest doses of 
statins tested in pediatric studies resulted in LDL-C reductions of 24% for pravastatin ( 14), 
27% for lovastatin ( 15), 40% for atorvastatin 
(16), and 41% for simvastatin ( 17). However, use of 
these statins generally does not result in the attainment of the stringent LDL-C target as illustrated by [CONTACT_56418] ( 16) where the highest dose tested (20 mg) 
resulted in only 60% of the patients who still did not achieve the optimal LDL-C goal of 110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L), reflecting the difficulty in meeting this target in many FH patients.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 41 Another 1-year study with rosuva statin conducted in children with FH aged 10 to 17 years showed 
a 50% reduction in LDL-C with the highest dose of 20 mg, and less than half (40%) of subjects 
reached the more stringent LDL-C goal of 110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) ( 18). Therefore, novel 
compounds that further reduce LDL cholesterol levels when added to statin therapy are of interest. 
Limited data are available for the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin ( 19) and are 
consistent with studies conducted in adults, showing an incr emental decrease of approximately 
15% in LDL-C levels compared with administration of simvastatin alone. With the highest dose of simvastatin (40 mg), significantly more s ubjects, achieved an LDL-C target of 130 mg/dL 
(3.4 mmol/L) and the optimal LDL-C goal of 110 mg/dL (2.85 mmol/L) in the coadministration 
of ezetimibe with 40 mg simvastatin group than  in the simvastatin 40 mg monotherapy group, 
77% vs 53% and 63% vs 27%, respectively (p <0.01 for both comparisons). However the therapeutic management of this  population requires a careful balance between increased dosing 
(administration of this high simvastatin dose) and potential side effects vs. achieving treatment goals. 
Very little information is available on statin intolerance in the pediatric population.  This is likely 
related to the small size or the limited duration of the studies conducted with statins, adverse 
events such as muscle symptoms, Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) increase, or elevations in 
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ Alanine a minotransferase (ALT) we re reported in some 
patients ( 20). Therefore statin intolerance in pediat ric population cannot be ruled out. This is 
acknowledged by [CONTACT_56419]-statin Lipid modifying therapy (LMT) for lowering LDL-C levels in children and young people with FH who are intolerant of statins ( 11). Presently available non statin LMTs 
commonly prescribed in the pedi atric population, more particular ly ezetimibe and colesevalam, 
appear less effective than statins on LDL-C lowering, and therefore similar issues are met with regard to achieving treatment goals. 
Introduction to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9): 
Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9 ) belongs to the subtilisin family of serine 
proteases and is highly expressed in the liver.  PCSK9 is involved in regu lating the levels of the 
low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) protein ( 21, 22). Once PCSK9 is secreted into plasma it 
directly binds to the LDL-R and promotes its de gradation.  The increased degradation of LDLRs 
leads to a reduced LDL-C removal and, therefore higher LDL-C circulatin g levels.  Experiments 
with mice have shown that increasing PCSK9 protei n levels decreases levels  of LDL-R protein in 
the liver while PCSK9 knockout mice have incr eased levels of LDL-R in the liver ( 23, 24).  
In humans, PCSK9 mutations have been identified: the gain-of-function mutations are rare and 
cause an autosomal dominant form of severe hy percholesterolemia and premature CHD, whereas 
loss of-function mutations are more common and are associated with reduced plasma levels of LDL-C and protection from CHD (25, 26).  
Therefore blocking PCSK9 binding to the LDL-R can potentially benefit patients with 
hypercholesterolemia by [CONTACT_56420]-C levels.  In addition, PCSK9 messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein levels are increased in response to statins, potentially attenuating their cholesterol-lowering effect ( 21).

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 42 Summary of adult clinical studies with alir ocumab selected for re levant information: 
All relevant information concerni ng the compound is available in the Clinical Investigator’s 
Brochure (CIB).   
In the Phase [ADDRESS_61566] been evaluated, every 2 weeks (Q2W) and every 
4 weeks (Q4W).  The doses of alirocumab include 75 mg Q2W, 150 mg Q2W, 150 mg Q4W, and 
300 mg Q4W. Dose adjustment sc hemes (initiation of alirocumab with 75mg Q2W, 150 mg Q4W 
or 300 mg Q4W, with a potential subsequent adju stment to 150mg Q2W) have been evaluated in 
Phase 3 studies. These studies evaluated heFH pati ents, non-FH patients, mostly at high/very high 
CV risk, including patients with mixed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_56360], and patients not 
taking statins including patients who are intolerant to statins due to skeletal muscle-related adverse effects. 
Phase 3 studies that evaluated the Q2W regimen: 
These studies demonstrated reductions in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 ranging from -42.7% 
to -50.6% in patients administered alirocumab 75 mg with po ssible up titration to150 mg Q2W, 
and from -45.7% to -61.0% in pa tients administered alirocumab [ADDRESS_61567] alirocumab dose (Week 4), and the LDL-C reduction observed at Week 24 was maintained 
through the treatment period (24, 52, 78 or  104 weeks, depending on the study). 
While reductions in LDL-C represent the primary goal of treatment in guidelines and the primary 
efficacy parameter in these studies, other lipid pa rameters are also associated with CV risk, for 
which alirocumab demonstrated a beneficial or at least neutral effect. Changes in Non-HDL-C, 
Apo B, and Total-C at Week 24 tend to correlate to some degree with LDL-C since LDL-C is the major component of non-HDL-C and Total-C. A consistent decrease in Lp(a) (ranging from 
-16.7% to -30.3%) was observed w ith alirocumab.  Trea tment with alirocumab was associated 
with modest but consistent changes in fasting TGs (decrease from baseline ranging from -6.0% to -15.6% overall, and from -14.4% to  -32.0% in patients with mi xed dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]) and HDL-C 
(increase from baseline from +3.5% to +8.8%). In st atin-treated patients, th e effect of alirocumab 
on TGs was significantly greater than placebo in most studies, but not significantly different from 
ezetimibe.  
Phase 3 studies that evaluated Q4W regimen
:   
Two studies EFC13786-DBTP and R727-CL-[ADDRESS_61568] evaluated 150 mg Q4W and 300 mg 
Q4W, respectively, as initiation dose regimen with a possible dose adjustment to 150 mg Q2W. 
For both studies, LDL-C reduction was observed at  Week 4, and was maintained over the whole 
duration of the study up to Week 24 for EFC13786-DBTP, and up to Week 48 for R727-CL-1308. 
As with Q2W dosing, changes in Non-HDL-C, A po B, and Total-C tended to correlate with 
LDL-C.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 43 The R727-CL-1308 study included patients with and without concomitant sta tin in two separate 
strata.  In both of these populations, there were  statistically significant effects in favor of 
alirocumab 300 mg Q4W with possible dose adjustment to 150 mg Q2W versus placebo for both 
co-primary efficacy endpoints (percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 24 and to averaged Weeks 21 – 24) and for all key secondary efficacy endpoints (except Apo A-1 for the concomitant statin popul ation). For LDL-C reduction, the LS mean treatment difference for 
alirocumab versus placebo at Week 24 was - 52.4% and -58.7% for the no concomitant statin 
population and concomitant statin population, respectively.  The results obtained at Week [ADDRESS_61569] assessed the 
sole contribution of the 300 mg Q4W dose regimen. 
The EFC13786-DBTP study included only patient s not receiving statin therapy (many on 
background ezetimibe), with a vast majority of statin intolerant patients.  At Week 24, the LS 
mean treatment difference for alirocumab ( 150 mg Q4W with possible up-titration to 150 mg 
Q2W) versus placebo of -56.4% was statistically significant for LDL-C reduction.  The results 
obtained at Week 12 showed a statistically significant LS mean treatment difference of  -44.9%, whereby [CONTACT_56421] [ADDRESS_61570] assessed the sole contribution of the 150 mg Q4W dose regimen.  The key secondary endpoint was statis tically significant up to Lp(a) reduction at 
Week 24. Favorable trends were re ported in HDL-C, TG and Apo A-1. 
Safety from Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies:
 
Alirocumab administration to date in clinical trials, has been associated with a favorable safety and tolerability profile in the completed clinical trials. The pooled safety analysis was performed in 5234 patients with hypercholesterolemia from the double-blind phase 2/3 studies receiving 75 mg Q2W or 150 mg Q2W dosing. Of these, 3340 patients were treated w ith alirocumab at a 
dose of 75 or 150 mg Q2W. Two pools were analyzed  based on the comparator arm in the study 
(placebo-controlled or ezetimibe-controlled).  
In the placebo-controlled and ezetimibe-controlle d pooled studies, no dose relationship was noted 
for any adverse events (AEs) and there was no evidence of a pattern in the type of AEs observed. The percentages of patients who experienced at least [ADDRESS_61571] 1 treatment-emergent SAE 
and any TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were similar between the alirocumab and control groups.  
Local injection site reactions, allergic reactions, neurologic events and neurocognitive disorders, 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increase, hepatic disorders, adjudicated CV events, and ophthalmologic disorders were evaluated as adverse events of special interest (AESI); diabetes 
mellitus, and skeletal-muscle related disorders were evaluated as other events of interest. There was no clinical concern with neurologic events and neurocognitive disorders, ALT increase and 
hepatic disorders, adjudicated CV events, diabetes mellitus, skeletal-muscle related disorders, and 
ophthalmologic disorders. However, neurocognitiv e events are considered a potential risk for 
alirocumab and conti nue to be monitored. 
No particular safety concerns  were observed in the group of patients with 2 consecutive LDL-C 
values <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L). However, in a post-randomization comparison analysis 
(global pool of phase 3 studies) cataract was report ed at a higher frequency (2.6%) in alirocumab-
treated patients who achieved 2 consecutive LD L-C values <25 mg/dL (<0.65 mmol/L) compared

(<0.65 mmol/L) (0.8%).  In the pool of placebo-controlled studies, the PT cataract was reported 
with a similar frequency in both the alirocumab and the placebo groups.   There is no mechanistic explanation to this finding. This analysis was exploratory in nature, and because of baseline 
differences in the post-randomization subgroups, it should be interpreted with caution. The sponsor will continue to monitor the events of  cataracts associated to low LDL-C to further 
evaluate this potential risk.  
Injection site reactions (including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, pain, tenderness), upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_56361] (including mainly oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing), 
pruritus, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis were identified as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for alirocumab. ADRs include AEs for which there is 
some basis to believe that there is a causal rela tionship between the drug and the occurrence of the 
AE. The most common adverse reaction in patients treated with alirocumab was local injection 
site reactions (6.3% patients in the alirocumab group versus 4.3% in control groups in the global 
pool). 
The analysis of pooled data from Q2W dosing as we ll as data from individual Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies demonstrated a favorable sa fety profile for alirocumab. Over all, the safety profile of the 
alirocumab Q4W dosing regimen was similar to alirocumab Q2W regimen, except for the 
frequency and onset of injection site reactions. Compared to those observed in the 75 Q2W with 
possible up titration to 150 Q2W regimen, local injection site reactions were more frequent, started earlier, and lasted longer with the Q4W dosing regimen, but were also transient, non-serious and not severe. 
Rationale for protocol design: 
This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of alirocumab in 
the pediatric population in order to support appr opriate dose selection of alirocumab for the 
Phase [ADDRESS_61572] of childre n and adolescents aged of 8 to 
17 years with heFH on stable LMT and LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L).  The stable LMT will 
consist of an optimal stable daily dose of statin therapy ± other LMT(s) for at least 4 weeks prior 
to screening period.  Optimal doses of statin are based on pediatric guidelines followed by [CONTACT_779] (27 or equivalent reference). 
Based on the final adult population PK model including Phase 3 data , simulations were performed 
to define the pediatric doses. The model included body weight (BW) as a covariate (on clearance) 
and allowed to perform simulations  with different BW. The targeted lower dose to be tested in 
pediatric patients was simulated to achieve drug exposure that corresponds to the lowest dose 
evaluated in adult patients, ie, 50 mg Q2W. This 50 mg Q2W dose in adult Phase 2 resulted in approximately 40% LDL-C reduction.  The higher dose was simulated to correspond to the lower 
adult therapeutic dose of 75 mg Q2W. Simula tions were also conducted to achieve an 
approximately 45-50% LDL-C reduc tion when alirocumab is administered monthly. Following 
these simulations, a fixed dosage was defined accord ing to BW categories, with staggered doses 
of 30 mg Q2W and 40 mg Q2W or 75mg Q4W for ch ildren with a BW below 50 kg, and doses of 
50 mg Q2W and 75 mg Q2W or 150 mg Q4W for children with a BW ≥50 kg.

main phase; followed by [CONTACT_3440]-label exte nsion period identified as extension phase. 
In Cohort 1, Cohort 2, and Cohort 3, where each  cohort will enroll [ADDRESS_61574] 4 patients will be required in one of the two BW categories. This will allow the evaluation of the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) profile in each BW category and to compare with PK/PD profile observed in adult patients. 
 
  At the end of the 8-week st udy treatment period followed by [CONTACT_941] [ADDRESS_61575]-treatment follow-up pe riod, patients enrolled in Cohort 1 will be offered entry into an open-
label extension study where the dose received during the study treatment period will be continued (ie, 30 mg for BW <50 kg and 50 mg for BW ≥50 kg, Q2W). Similar approach will be 
implemented for Cohort 2 (40 mg for BW <50 kg and 75 mg for BW ≥50 kg, Q2W) and Cohort 3 
(75 mg for BW <50 kg and 150 mg for BW ≥50 kg, Q4W).  However, once the final doses for the 
Phase 3 study are selected, then these final doses from the Q2W or Q4W regimens will be administered to the patients, based on their body weight (BW) at the time of the dose change, if needed and if the device is available.  This alirocumab administration during the open-label extension will continue until approximately [ADDRESS_61576] the opportunity to pa rticipate in the Phase 3 study. 
Cohort 4:  
The DFI14223 study has completed the 8-week do se finding treatment period in 31 pediatric 
patients enrolled in the 3 cohorts.  This study star ted with a fixed dosage according to body weight 
(BW) categories, with sequential  doses of 30 mg Q2W (Cohort 1), 40 mg Q2W (Cohort 2) or 
75 mg (Q4W) (Cohort 3) for patients with a BW <50 kg (ie, lower BW category, LBWC), and 
doses of 50 mg Q2W (Cohort 1), 75 mg Q2W (Cohor t 2) or 150 mg Q4W (Cohort 3) for patients 
with a BW ≥50 kg (ie, higher BW category, HBWC). Sequential approach was employed as a conservative safety approach in the first evaluati on of alirocumab administr ation in the pediatric 
population, starting with Cohort [ADDRESS_61577] reduction, overall, in Cohort 2 (LS mean  change from baseline in LDL-C of -46.1%). 
Patients in Cohort 1, overall, ha d a LS mean change from baseline in LDL-C of -21.2%.  
However, for the Cohort 3 using the Q4W dosing regimen, overall, the LS mean change from baseline in LDL-C was -7.7%, with  inconsistency between the 2 doses as per BW category (mean 
reduction of LDL-C of -17.5 % with 75 mg Q4W in the LBWC and an mean increase in LDL-C of + 4.0% with 150 mg Q4W in the HBWC). For all 6 dose groups, there were no patients with treatment emergent serious adverse event, treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) leading to death, or TEAEs leading to permanent treatment  discontinuation. There were also no adverse 
events of special interest (AESI) including, neurological events, neurocognitive events, increase in ALT, allergic drug reactions, or local injection site reactions or new and clinically significant 
adverse events for all of the 6 dose groups to date . Alirocumab was well tole rated in this pediatric 
population with no observed, pa rticular safety concern.

DFI14223 - alirocumab Version number: [ADDRESS_61578] anation is that the doses for both BW categories 
were not high enough to achieve larger and sustained reductions in the LDL-C over the entire 
dosing interval. This variability over the dosing interval, which was already identified in adults with this dosing interval, has also been reported by [CONTACT_56422]9 inhibitor, evolocumab ( 28), and is thought to be due to the subs et of patients with higher rates of PCSK9 
mediated clearance of alirocumab. 
Given these inconclusive results for the Q4W dos ing regimen evaluated in Cohort 3, the protocol 
is amended to include an add itional cohort (Cohort 4) that will evaluate the Q4W regimen at 
higher doses of 150 mg for BW <50 kg and 300 mg for BW ≥[ADDRESS_61579] on 
LDL-C closer to the therapeutic target of 50%  can be approached. The dose of [ADDRESS_61580] specifically endorsed this  more extensive effort to 
evaluate these higher doses with a Q4W admin istration of alirocumab, given the monthly 
convenience for children and adolescents and the favorable safety data to date. Cohort 4 will 
include a total of approximately 10 patients with 4 to 6 patients per body weight category and has 
an overall similar design to Cohort 3 except for a longer main phase (12 weeks) including 2 
additional visits (visit 7 at Week 10 and Visit 8 at Week 12), but without a post – treatment follow 
up period prior to entry into OLE.  
The addition to the higher doses in the Q4W cohort with extended 12 week study duration 
(including 2 new visits at Week  10 and Week 12) for the open label dose-finding period will more 
appropriately ensure that steady state has been re ached after 3 alirocumab injections (2 interdose 
intervals) in terms of PK and LDL-C and related parameter reduction efficacy.  An intermediate 
visit between the dosing interval (Week 10) is specifically introduced to better document the PK and LDL-C data from the Q4W dosing regimen that is known to show some peak-trough 
variability over the 4-week dosing interval, ie, a peak in the decrease at the mid dosing interval time point and trough reduction in LDL-C at the end of dosing interval time period. Thus, 
extending the duration of a higher Q4W dosing regimen to 12 weeks (an additional 4 weeks) will secure more comprehensively data on the LDL- C related profile reduction potential of a Q4W 
dosing regimen for alirocumab. 
Given the 12 week duration, only LDL-C and key related parameters (TC, non-HDL-C, and TG) 
will be measured at Week [ADDRESS_61581]-treatment 
follow-up period is no longer needed based on the data collected from the previous 3 cohorts.

Conclusion on the benefit risk  assessment with alirocumab: 
Based on the clinical data available to date in the adult population, treatment with alirocumab has 
demonstrated a significant LDL-C lowering effect in a population of patient s with non-FH or with 
heFH. The LDL-C lowering efficacy was associated with consistent decrease s in Total-C, Apo B, 
non-HDL-C, a decrease in Lp(a), and a favorable trend for HDL-C and triglycerides.  Maximum 
efficacy was observed as early as 4 weeks after the initial dose, and efficacy was well maintained 
up to 2 years. 
Alirocumab administration to date in clinical trials has been associated with a favorable safety and 
tolerability profile. 
Immunogenicity and systemic hypersensitivity are considered as identified risks. Injection site reactions (including erythema/redness, itching, swelling, pain, tenderness), upper 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_56361] (including mainly oropharyngeal pain, rhinorrhea, sneezing), 
pruritus, hypersensitivity, eczema nummular, urticaria, and hypersensitivity vasculitis are identified as adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for alirocumab. ADRs include AEs for which there is 
some basis to believe that there is a causal rela tionship between the drug and the occurrence of the 
AE. 
Monitoring of these AEs will be continued in all studies conducted in adult and pediatric patients. 
There was no safety signal observed with neurol ogic events, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increase and hepatic disorders, adjudicated CV events, diabetes mellitus, skeletal-muscle related 
disorders and ophthalmologic disorders in the alirocumab-treated group overall, but more 
cataracts (2.6%) were noted in patients treated with alirocumab who achieved 2 consecutive 
LDL-C values <25 mg/dL compared to 0.8% of al irocumab-treated patient s who did not achieve 
such low levels. Although limitation ha s to be consider with regard to this post-randomization 
comparison and there were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of cataracts in this subgroup of patients when compared to cont rol groups, cataract in patients with very low 
LDL-C levels is considered as a potential risk and the Sponsor will continue to monitor this 
potential risk. There was no safety signal observed for neurocognitive disorders, however, the Sponsor will monitor this potential risk as an adverse event of special interest in this study. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) dedicated to the pediatric clinical program 
conducted with alirocumab will meet periodically to review the safe ty data collected in this study. 
This specific study is undertaken to demonstrat e the safety and the reduction of LDL-C with 
alirocumab in the heFH pediatric population and to support appropriate dose selection for the 
Phase 3 study. Because of the rapid clinical prog ression of atherosclerotic disease in children and

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
This study is an open-label, dose-finding, sequential group, multi-nati onal, multi-center study 
with repeated dose of subcutaneous (SC) alirocumab injections administered every 2 weeks 
(Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) in children and adolescents aged of 8 to 17 years with heFH having LDL-C ≥130 mg/dL (3.37 mmol/L). A sequential en rollment into the 4 separate and 
independent Cohorts 1 to 4, is a pplied. Patients should be treated with an optimal dose of statin 
with or without other LMT(s), or non-statin LMT(s) if statin intole rant, at stable daily dose(s) for 
at least 4 weeks.  The optimal dose of statin is de fined as the stable daily dose prescribed based on 
regional practice or local guidelines or is the stable daily dose that is maximally tolerated due to adverse effects on higher doses. For patients not receiving maximally tolerated dose of statin, statin intensification should be car efully considered prior to inclusion in this study in order to 
ensure that the addition of a non-statin LDL-C lo wering therapy (ie, alirocumab) would be the 
next appropriate step in the ma nagement of the patient’s hypercholesterolemia.  The highest dose 
of statin should not exceed the maximum labeled do se of statin for pediatric patients as per the 
local prescribing information. Each independent cohort below will include 10 patients with no less 
than 4 patients in each BW category: 
• Cohort 1 will receive 30 mg Q2W for body weight (BW) <50 kg and 50 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg. 
• Cohort 2 will receive 40 mg Q2W for BW <50 kg and 75 mg Q2W for BW ≥50 kg. 
• Cohort 3 will receive 75 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg and 150 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg.  
• Cohort 4 will receive 150 mg Q4W for BW <50 kg and 300 mg Q4W for BW ≥50 kg. 
For each cohort, the study consists of a main phase and an optional exte nsion phase.  The main 
phase is comprised of 3 periods; screening (including run-in, if applicable), open-label dose finding treatment, and follow-up only for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, and 2 periods: screening (including run-in, if applicable) and open-label dose finding treatment for Cohort 4.These periods of the 
main phase are described as below. 
MAIN PHASE: 
Screening Period: 
• The screening period will last up to 6 (+1) w eeks, with patients to be enrolled as soon as 
all inclusion and no exclusion criteria are met.   
- Patients who consent to participate in the study, but who have not been on stable 
LMTs for at least 4 weeks or require statin intensification when initially seen, can 
participate in a run-in period until LMT dose(s) have been stable for [ADDRESS_61585] 4 weeks. Stable LMT refers to patients receiving either stable optimal daily dose of statin ±other LMT(s) or stable dose of non-statin LMT(s) if st atin intolerance for at least 4 weeks prior to screening.

testing for heFH-associated genes only.  All samples will be destroyed once testing is completed.  No additional genetic testing and no long-term storage will be done for 
these samples. 
- Special procedures, including procedures  for collection, handling, storage and 
shipment of DNA specimens for genetic te sting for heFH, are summarized in the 
genetic testing manual provided by [CONTACT_56425]. 
All patients who successfully screen for Cohort 1 and are not included in Cohort 1, due to the appropriate Cohort 1 weig ht group being fully enrolled, may participate to Cohort 2 
but only after eligibility, including safety assessments, is reconfirmed.  Patients who are successfully screened for Cohort 2 but are not  enrolled, due to the appropriate Cohort 2 
weight group being fully enrolled, may participat e in Cohort 3 without the need to repeat 
the run-in/screening period if there is no more than 3 months between eligibility confirmation and inclusion.  In such a circ umstance, the run-in/screening period from 
Cohort 2 will substitute for the run-in/screening period for Cohort 3. If there is more than [ADDRESS_61587] be reconfirmed.   
Safety and eligibility assessments noted above include all lab tests lis ted as exclusionary, 
based on specified results. 
Patients should be instructed to follow a diet in accordance with the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines ( 1) or equivalent throughout the entire study (ie, both phases). 
The dietician or site staff with appropriate training will review the patient’s diet at the 
screening visit and periodically throughout the study.

• An open-label dose finding trea tment period of 8 weeks with alirocumab for Cohorts 1 to 
3, and 12 weeks for Cohort 4. Four indepe ndent cohorts (Cohorts 1 to 4) will be 
administered SC alirocumab injections Q2W or Q4W in a sequential enrollment.   
• The DMC will review data on a regular basis during the dose finding treatment period. 
• After Cohort 1 completes th e open-label dose finding tr eatment period, the DMC will 
continue to review the safety data a nd make a recommendation on dose escalation to 
Cohorts 2 and 3.  Cohort 2 will initially begi n enrollment.  Once enrollment is completed 
for Cohort 2, then this will immediately be followed by [CONTACT_56407] 3 (ie, 
sequential enrollment).  Cohort 4 is an inde pendent cohort with a separate enrollment. 
• Cohorts 1 and 2 (Q2W): Alirocumab injec tions will be prepared from vials by [CONTACT_56426] (or equivalent). Deta iled instructions on preparation of injections from vials 
will be provided in a separate document.  Alirocumab injections will be administered at Weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6.  The Weeks 0 and 4 alirocumab injections will be administered at the clinical site by [CONTACT_7893].  The Weeks 2 and 6 alirocumab injections will be administered at the clinical site by [CONTACT_56408]’s home by a health care professional, depending upon local arra ngements and preferences of the 
investigator/patient.   
• Cohort 3 (Q4W): Alirocumab in jections will be prepared fro m vials by [CONTACT_32335] (or 
equivalent). Detailed instructions on preparation of injections from vials will be provided in a separate document.  Alir ocumab injections will be admin istered at Weeks 0 and 4 at

Open-label extension treatment period: 
At the end of the follow-up period of the main ph ase for Cohorts 1 to 3 and end of the 12 week 
open label dose-finding for Cohort 4, patients enrolled in all cohorts who suc cessfully complete 
(provided they have not experienced AEs leadin g to permanent discontinuation during the main 
treatment period, or had significant protocol deviations, in the investigator’s judgment) the main 
phase will be offered entry into an optional extension phase. The extension phase includes an open-label extension (O LE) period as follows: 
• All doses/dose regimen administered during th e open-label dose findi ng treatment period 
of the main phase are expected to be efficacious.  Thus, the initial dose of alirocumab that will be administered Q2W or Q4W during the OLE period, will be a continuation of the same doses/dose regimen administered during the open-label dose finding treatment period 
of the main phase.  However, once the final optimal doses for the phase 3 study are selected, then these final optimal doses from the Q2W or Q4W regimen will be administered to all patients during the OLE period, based on the patient’s body weight at the time of the dose change. For Cohort 4, pa tients will remain on their initial regimen 
given the planned study end date of December 2018.  
• For Cohorts [ADDRESS_61590]

- If the PFS is available in the extension phase, then patients may either switch from 
alirocumab injections prepared from vials to PFS or directly initiate PFS (depending 
on patient’s date of entry into the extensi on phase).  After appropriate training, the 
parent/guardian or patient (if appropriate) will administer the PFS at home or another preferred location. In certain cases, alternative arrangements may be made for the administration of the PFS,  
- If the PFS is not available in the extension phase, then alirocumab injections prepared 
from vials will be administered at the clinical site (by [CONTACT_7893]) or at the patient’s 
home or another preferred location conti ngent upon alternative arrangements being 
made for such an administration.

Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labelin g, expi[INVESTIGATOR_320], etc.) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by [CONTACT_429]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to re call IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allows the IMP to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_13129], or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
IMP administration data will be recorded by [CONTACT_56447] m vials during the extension phase and by 
[CONTACT_1962]/parents on a patient’s diary in case of self-injection with prefilled syringes during the extension period.   
Measures taken to ensure and document IMP compliance and accountabilit y (vials and PFS if 
available) are described below: 
• The investigator or designee will obtain via IVRS/IWRS the treatment kit number(s) and 
he/she will dispense the treatment kit(s) to the patient.   
• The accountability at site is to be perfo rmed at IMP kit re-supply visits only (see 
Section  10.1).  During the extension period in case of self-injections, the used and unused 
kit(s) should be brought back to such visits for accountability purposes.   
• The investigator or designee will complete  the corresponding treatment log form from 
patient’s diary.   
• The investigator/study coordinator will enter data in the appropriate e-CRF pages, 
according to data recorded in the treatment log form.   
• The monitor will check the data consistency between e-CRF pages, treatment log forms 
using patient’s diary, and returned unused syringes of a corresponding kit.   
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
A detailed treatment log of the destroyed IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by [CONTACT_3433] e Investigator and the monitoring  team.  The Investigator will 
not destroy the unused IMP unless the S ponsor provides written authorization.   
If the site is not able to destroy or destruction not allowed in the country , all treatments kits will 
be retrieved by [CONTACT_1034].

will be done under close and a ppropriate clinical/and or la boratory monitoring once the 
Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2).  All treatment 
interruption duration should be recorded by [CONTACT_56477].   
Treatment interruption is defined as one or more scheduled injections that are not administered to 
the patient as decided by [CONTACT_737].

Permanent treatment discontinua tion (also referred to as trea tment discontinuation) is any 
treatment discontinuation associated with the definitive decision from the Investigator or the 
patient not to re expose the patient to the IMP at any time.   
Patient withdrawal from the study treatment or study should be avoided as much as possible.   
10.3.[ADDRESS_61662] of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment if they d ecide to do so, at any time and irrespective of 
the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s d ecision. All efforts should be made to document the 
reasons for treatment discontinuation and th is should be documented in the e-CRF.   
Patients should discontinue the IMP for the following reasons: 
• Pregnancy, intention for pregnancy, or no lo nger with effective contraceptive method of 
birth control (females of child-bearing pot ential who are sexually active only).   
• Acute injection reaction of clinical concern.   
• Serious adverse event (or non-seri ous but severe in intensity) of hypersensitivity reaction 
considered related to alirocumab.   
• At patient/parents request (ie, withdraw al of the consent for treatment).   
• If, in the Investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], continuation with the administration of the IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well-being.   
• Intercurrent condition that requi res discontinuation of the IMP. 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor.  
• Patient receives treatment prior to inclusion.   
Any abnormal laboratory value w ill be immediately rechecked for confirmation (within 24 hours 
if possible), before making a decision of disc ontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient

A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which  hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_56385], or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Is a medically important event. 
 Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
 reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
 be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56386] (ie, specific measures or corrective 
 treatment) to prevent one of the othe r outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group- strictly confidential Page 99 [IP_ADDRESS] Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or non-ser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by [CONTACT_56481] e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added or removed dur ing a study by [CONTACT_12548]. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) are AEs (serious or non-serious) that need to be 
monitored, documented, and managed in a prespecified manner described in the protocol. Please 
see Appendix B for additional information.   
For these AEs, the Sponsor will be informed immediately (ie within 24 hours), as per SAEs notification described in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding screens in the e-CRF: 
The following AEs are considered as AESIs in the study: 
• ALT >[ADDRESS_61673] (Please refer to related flowchart in Appendix B ). 
• Allergic events: 
- Any general allergic events regardless of the cause’ and/or local injection site reactions 
deemed to be allergic (or have an allergic  component) that require consultation with 
another physician for further evaluation of hypersensitivity/allergy as per the Investigator’s medical judgment or as per Section  10.6.2, should be reported as an 
AESI.   
- All general allergic events, and/or all injection site reactions having an allergic component or deemed to be allergic, requi re completion of the specific e-CRF screen 
(see Section  10.6.2).   
• Pregnancy: 
- Pregnancy occurring in a female  patient or the partner of a male patient included in the 
clinical trial. Pregnancy will be recorded as a prespecified AESI with immediate 
notification in all cases. It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills the SAE criteria,   
- In the event of pregnancy of a female patie nt included in the trial, IMP should be 
discontinued,   
- The follow-up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female partner of a male participant will be mandatory until the outcome has been determined.   
• Symptomatic Overdose with IMP alirocumab: 
- An overdose (accidental or [intentional]) is an event suspected by [CONTACT_56453] (not based on systematic injection counts) and 
defined as at least twice of the intended dose within the intended therapeutic interval 
(ie, 2 or more injections from the treatment kit are administered in <7 calendar days for Q2W regimen or 2 or more injections from the treatment kit are administered in <14 calendar days for Q4W regimen) to be reported using the corresponding screens in 
the eCRF using the term “symptomatic overdose (accidental [or intentional])”. The patient should be monitored and appropriate symptomatic  treatment instituted if 
needed,

• Neurologic Events: 
- Neurologic Events that require additional ex aminations/procedures and/or referral to a 
specialist should be reported as an AESI. If the event does not require additional 
examinations/ procedures and/or referral to a specialist, it should be reported as a 
standard AE.   
• Neurocognitive events: 
- All neurocognitive events will be considered as AESI. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Local injection site reactions 
Local injection site reactions that are considered by [CONTACT_56482]-allergic events and 
that are related to the alirocumab injection, as opposed to another injectable agent, should be further characterized by [CONTACT_56483], pain, etc. If the patient experiences a local injection site reaction with no signs or symptoms except for erythema/redness, and/or swelling, and the diameter of the erythema/ redness, or swelling measure <2.5 cm, no AE for local injection site 
reaction needs to be reported as this is not ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_56388] a clin ically important finding. 
However, if the patient has a re action of swelling with a diameter <2.5 cm that interferes with 
activity, then it should be considered as a clinically relevant finding and should be reported as an AE with a corresponding grade of moderate or severe, in accordance with Appendix C . Special 
eCRF screens will need to be completed.  If such an AE were to occur, then do not report the individual components of the reaction but rather the term “local injection site reaction”, the individual components being described in the specific eCRF screen.  
If a local topi[INVESTIGATOR_56389] a lirocumab injection, the time  of local anesthetic

All AEs regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP, spanning from the signature [CONTACT_56534], until the end of the study (post study treatment follow-up visit), are to be recorded on the corresponding screen(s) included in the eCRF.   
Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms.  The 
Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP,

• Increase in CPK and suspi[INVESTIGATOR_56391].   
Use of local labs for follow-up testing should be considered.  In case the amount of blood needed 
to perform all follow-up testing noted in the algo rithms exceeds what can be safely drawn or 
exceeds local requirements, clinical judgment shou ld be used to prioritize tests obtained. In the 
algorithms, except when specified to be permanent, treatment discontinuation should be temporary, at least until a cause for the abnormality  is found.  Clinical judgment should be used to 
determine if and when study treatment should be resumed.

10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Local tolerability (local injection site reactions) 
In case the Investigator or the patient/parent recognizes any signs of local intolerability, then this 
should be treated and followed up as per th e Investigator’s medical judgment.  See Section  
[IP_ADDRESS] and Appendix C  for further information.   
10.6.2 Allergic adverse events  
Specific eCRF screens are to be filled in to assess allergic adverse events or allergic-like AE that may occur during the clinical studies conducted with alirocumab.   
Sometimes transient injection s ite reactions, irritant in nature, may occur, requiring no 
intervention and being of dubious significance.  Th ese reactions would not be considered to be 
allergic reactions.   Adverse events that may constitute an allergic reaction (eg, generalized itch, nasal itch, swelling 
at injection site, flushing, hives, swelling at lips, eyes, face, tongue, hands, feet, lump in throat, difficulty to swallow, hoarseness, change in p itch of voice, incapacity to speak, wheezing, chest 
tightness, stridor, etc.) should be considered to be reported on the General Allergic adverse event and/or Local Injection Site Reaction Complementary Form.   
Local injection site reactions deemed to be allerg ic should be recorded on the Local Injection Site 
Reaction Complementary Form. However, injection site reactions which 
progress/expand/worsen/etc should be evaluated as recommended in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] and General 
Allergic adverse event Complementary form should be completed.   
The IMP should be immediately interrupted (temporari ly discontinued) if there is a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_56392].  See Section  10.3.1 for further information on treatment 
interruption and Section  10.3.2 for criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic adverse event with cutaneous involvement 
Adverse events with cutaneous involvement which are obviously of allergic origin or injection 
site reactions which progress/ex pand/worsen/etc. should be evalua ted by a dermatologist as soon 
as possible, and preferably within one week of the site first becoming aware of the event.   
The Investigator should evaluate the patient for possible etiologies (new medications, etc.) and 
extracutaneous symptoms and signs.  An uns cheduled Central Laboratory assessment for 
hematology, chemistry, liver pane l, PK, and ADA should be obtained.  If it is possible, the site

patient's case, reason for consultation, and information being requested to the consulting 
dermatologist.   
A full consultation report should be sent by [CONTACT_56488].  The full report 
should contain, at a minimum, the following informa tion; a detailed descrip tion of the rash (such 
as the morphology [lesion type], shape of indivi dual lesions, arrangement of  multiple lesions [eg, 
scattered, grouped, linear], distribution, color, consistency, presence of pruritus or pain, and other 
clinical signs) and in case a skin biopsy (inc luding histopathology a nd immunofluorescence) was 
done (if it was deemed necessary as per the dermat ologist’s or Investigator’s medical judgment), 
the results of this investigation with, if a pplicable, a specific diagnosis of the AE.  The 
Investigator will fax the full report and the correct ed AE form if necessary, to the Monitoring 
Team Representative within 24 hours.   
[IP_ADDRESS] Acute allergic injection reactions 
Acute allergic injection reaction (w hich are considered under the category of general allergic drug 
reactions) is defined as any adverse event that o ccurs during or shortly after injection of the IMP 
(characterized by [CONTACT_56489], bronchoconstricti on, urticaria, edema, 
angioedema, nausea, vomiting).  Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential adverse effects (eg, antihistamines, bronchodilators, IV saline, corticosteroids, acetaminophen, and epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]) must be available for immediate use fo r the injections at the site 
visits.   
Patients will be observed at the investigational site for at least [ADDRESS_61677] at the inclusion visit.  Patients should be treated symptomatically if any AEs are observed.  Patients are to remain at the site until any acute injecti on reaction is assessed as stable, 
per the Investigator’s discretion.  General Allerg ic Reaction and/or Local Injection Site Reaction 
Complementary Form will have to be completed.   
10.6.3 Recommendations for managing and monitoring patients with very low LDL-C 
levels (ie, LDL-C<50 mg/dL [1.30 mmol/L]) during the OLE period 
If a patient achieves a very low LDL-C level (ie, LDL-C<50mg/dL [1.30 mmol/L] on one or more 
occasion) during the OLE period, then the Investigator will: 
• Call the patient / parent as soon as possible to  inquire about interval occurrence of AEs, 
particularly any AEs rela ted to visual problems. 
• Decide whether the patient should be requested to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_56395], 
or assessment could be done at the next scheduled visit. 
• At the site visit, plan for the following , based on Investigator’s medical judgment: 
- Assess the need to have blood drawn from the patient for a repeat lipid assessment in order to confirm the observation of very low LDL-C, 
- Assess the need for conducting clinical investigations, arranging specialist consultation(s) as needed, including with an  eye specialist in case of visual problems, 
as needed, and any rele vant additional work-up,

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
No power sample size calculations were performed for the main phase. A sample size of 
10 patients per cohort is empi[INVESTIGATOR_56396] 1 studies (R727-CL-
904 and R727-CL-1001) conducte d in adults. No less than 4 patie nts with BW <50 kg and no less 
than 4 patients with BW ≥50 kg will be enrolled in 4 independent cohorts (Cohort 1, Cohort 2, 
Cohort 3, and Cohort 4), which w ill allow the evaluation of the 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic s (PK/PD) profile and safety  of different alirocumab 
doses/dose regimen in each BW category and to co mpare with PK/PD profile  and safety observed 
in adult patients.

and recorded in the IVRS/IWRS database, regardle ss of whether the treatment kits were used or 
not. Patients treated without being included or treated with an open-label treatment kit before the 
inclusion will not be considered as included and will not be included in any analysis population. 
The safety experience of patients treated and not included will be reported separately. 
For any patient included more than once, only the data associated with the first inclusion will be 
used in any analysis population. The safety experi ence associated with any later inclusion will be 
assessed separately. 
The safety experience of patients treated and not included will be reported separately, and these 
patients will not be in  the safety population. 
11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
The primary efficacy analysis population will be the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population as 
defined below. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Modified intent-to-treat population 
Modified ITT (mITT) population is defined as a ll included patients who t ook at least one dose or 
part of a dose of IMP during the open-label dose-finding period and had an evaluable primary endpoint. The primary endpoint is considered as evaluable when both of the following conditions 
are met: 
• Availability of at least [ADDRESS_61680] open-label IMP (see Section  
9.1.1).

In addition:  
• Included patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will be 
included in the safety population as assigned by [CONTACT_21926]. 
• For patients receiving IMP from more than [ADDRESS_61682] duration. 
11.3.3 Other analysis population  
The PK analysis will be performed on all treated  patients (safety populatio n) with at least one 
evaluable blood sample for PK pos t first open-label IMP injection. 
The anti-alirocumab antibody analysis will be perf ormed on all treated pati ents (safety population) 
with a blood sample on Week 0 (baseline) and at least one evaluable blood sample for antibodies 
post first open-label IMP injection. 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
The following sections detail the analyses of  the open-label dose finding treatment period. 
Analyses of open-label extension period will be done separately and will be detailed in the SAP. 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by [CONTACT_56490]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The duration of IMP injection exposure in weeks will be defined as: (last dose of open-label IMP injection date - first dose of open-label IMP injecti on date +14)/7 (for Cohorts 1 & 2) or (last dose 
of open-label IMP injec tion date - first dose of open-label IMP injection date +28)/7 (for

Compliance will be assessed using the injection frequency defined for each patient as the average 
number of days between 2 injections, that is: (last injection date – first in jection date)/(number of 
injections -1) and will be summarized descriptively (N, Mean, SD, Median, Min and Max). 
11.4.[ADDRESS_61683] for the efficacy endpoints. All efficacy analyses will be descriptive. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint(s) 
The primary analysis will be based on an on-treatment approach, and will use LDL-C values collected during the efficacy treatment period. Th e efficacy treatment period is defined as the 
period from first alirocumab injecti on to last alirocumab injection +21 days (for Cohorts 1 & 2) or 
+ 35 days (for Cohort 3 & Cohort 4) during the open-label dose findi ng treatment period. 
The percent change from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Week [ADDRESS_61684] model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach to handle missing  data. All post-baseline data available during the open-label 
dose-finding treatment period and within analysis  windows will be used and the missing data will 
not be imputed. The model will include the fixed categorical effects of alirocumab doses/dose regimen (30 mg Q2W [<50 kg], 40 mg Q2W [<50 kg], 50 mg Q2W [ ≥50 kg], and 75 mg Q2W 
[≥50 kg]) and Q4W (75 mg Q4W [<50 kg] , 150 mg Q4W [≥ 50 kg], 150 mg Q4W [<50 kg] and 
300 mg Q4W ([ ≥50 kg]), time point (Week 4, Week 8), dose- by-time point interaction, as well as, 
the continuous fixed covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baselin e value-by-time point 
interaction. 
This model will be run using SAS Mixed procedure with an unstructured correlation matrix to 
model the within-patient errors . Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood 
method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Deno minator degrees of fr eedom will be estimated 
using Satterthwaite’s approxima tion. This model will provide ba seline adjusted least-squares 
means estimates at Week 8 for each alirocumab dose, with their corresponding SEs and 95% CIs. 
In addition, LS mean with 95% confidence inte rvals will be provided for each cohort using 
appropriate contrasts. 
Additionally, for Cohort 4 only, the percent chan ge from baseline in calculated LDL-C at Week 
12 will be analyzed using the same model as for the primary endpoint: All post-baseline data 
available during the open-label dose-finding treatment period and within analysis windows for Cohort 4 will be used and the mi ssing data will not be imputed. The model will include the fixed 
categorical effects of alirocumab doses/dos e regimen (150 mg Q4W [<50 kg] and 300 mg Q4W 
([≥50 kg]), time point (Week 4, Week 8, Week10, W eek 12), dose-by-time point interaction, as 
well as, the continuous fixed covariates of ba seline LDL-C value and ba seline value-by-time 
point. This model will provide baseline adjusted least-squares means estimates at Week 12 for each alirocumab dose of Cohort 4, with their co rresponding SEs and 95% CIs. In addition, LS 
mean with 95% confidence intervals will be provided for cohort 4 overall using appropriate contrasts.

Continuous secondary variables defined in Section  9.2 will be analyzed in the mITT population 
using the same MMRM model as for the primary endpoint with the corresponding baseline value 
as covariate. For TG and Lp(a) known to have non Gaussian distribution, the methodology that 
will be used will be described in the SAP. 
For binary secondary efficacy variables defined in Section  9.2, the methodology that will be used 
will be described in the SAP. Percent change, and when appropriate absolute change from baseline in calculated LDL-C, 
total C, HDL-C, TG, and non-HDL-C will be summarized at each time point in the mITT 
population (including Week 10 and W12 time points for Cohort 4). All measurements, scheduled or unscheduled, collected from screening up to 21 days (for Cohorts 1 & 2) or + 35 days (for 
Cohorts 3 & 4) after the last open-label IMP injection, will be assigned to analysis windows 
defined in the SAP in order to provide an assessment for these time points. Laboratory assessments other than the ones provided by [CONTACT_56491]. For TG, measurements on not fasting patients will be excluded. Same kind of tables (with either percent change from baseline or absolute change from baseline) and plots will be provided for other efficacy parameters: Apo B, Apo A-1, ratio Apo B/Apo A-1, Lp(a). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Multiplicity considerations 
Since there will be no formal statistical test for the efficacy endpoints, no adjustment for multiplicity will be made. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data  
The summary of safety results will be presented by [CONTACT_56492]. No formal inferential testing will be performed. Summaries will be descriptive in nature. 
All safety analyses will be performed on the Sa fety population using the following common rule: 
• The baseline value is defined as the last av ailable value before first open-label IMP. 
The following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters and vital signs: 
• The potentially clinically significant abnorma lity (PCSA) values are defined as abnormal 
values considered medically important by [CONTACT_56493]/thresholds based on lite rature review and defined by  [CONTACT_56494]. 
• PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the TEAE period, 
taking into account all evaluations pe rformed during the TEAE period, including 
unscheduled or repeated evaluations. The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the PCSA percentage. 
• Treatment period: the treatment period used for quantitative analysis is defined as the time from first dose of open-label IMP to the last  dose of open-label IMP injection +21 days 
(for Cohorts 1 & 2) or + 35 days (for Cohorts 3 & 4).

The incidence of liver-related AEs will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_1570]. The selection of 
preferred terms will be based on standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) Hepatic disorder. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) (sorted by 
[CONTACT_56496]), high-level group te rm (HLGT), high level term (HLT) and preferred 
term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE. Multiple occurre nces of the same event in the same patient 
will be counted only once in the tables w ithin a treatment phase. The denominator for 
computation of percentages is the safe ty population within each treatment group. 
Adverse event incidence table will be provided by [CONTACT_56497]: all 
TEAEs, all treatment emergent AESI (defined with a PT or a prespecified groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), all treatment emergent SAEs and all TEAEs leading to perman ent treatment discontinuation. If any clinically 
significant signal is detected and need further characterization or for AE of clinical interest, 
exploration of time to onset will be performed for these selected TEAEs.

Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Based 
Study to Determine Effect of Evening Alcohol on 
Sympathetic Neural Activity and Baroreflex 
Function in Binge Drinkers  
February [ADDRESS_329721] (ApneaLink, Resmed, San Diego, CA, [LOCATION_003]) to screen for 
sleep- disordered breathing. If eligible following the at -home apnea testing (apnea-
hypopnea index < 30 events/hour), participants were asked to report to the sleep laboratory at 9PM on a separate occasion to perform a familiarization overnight polysomnography (PSG) sleep study. This night was used to confirm the absence of sleep disordered breathing or other sleep disorders (i.e., restless leg syndrome, etc.) and to familiarize the participants with equipment and procedures.   After completing the familiarization night, participants were scheduled to return to the sleep laboratory on two occasions separated by [CONTACT_32205]. On each day of testing, meals 
throughout the day (i.e., breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner) were provided based on participant caloric needs following consultation with a registered dietitian. Participants were assigned to a fluid control or alcohol condition separated by 1- month using a 
randomized, fluid- controlled, crossover design. Random assignment was performed by 
[CONTACT_270454] a cup by a blinded experimenter. In either condition, participants were asked to arrive to the laboratory at 4PM to assess breath alcohol concentration (Intoximeters, Inc., St. Louis, MO, [LOCATION_003]) and hydration status via urine specific gravity (Schmidt Haensch, [LOCATION_010]). During the alcohol condition, alcohol administration began at 8PM. Alcohol doses were diluted in a 1:3 ratio of 95% ethanol to fruit juice (orange or cranberry juice based on participant preference). A total dose of 1g/kg for males and 0.85g/kg for females was used. These doses were separated into a total of 6 aliquots, 3 of which were administered every 5 minutes starting at 8PM and another 3 starting at 9PM. In the fluid control condition, the same volume of fluid (i.e., juice) was ingested at each time point, but beverages did not contain alcohol but were masked with an alcohol mist. Participants were provided ad libitum water. The volume of fluid intake and urine output was monitored throughout the duration of the experimental visit. Following final dose administration, participants were instrumented with overnight PSG equipment . Following  a venous blood 
draw and breathalyzer reading at 10PM for blood/breath alcohol concentration, participants entered bed at 10:45PM followed by [CONTACT_270455] 11PM. All participants were provided an 8- hour sleep opportunity.  
 Upon awakening at 7AM, participants’ urine specific gravity was once again assessed, and another venous blood draw was performed to ensure that blood alcohol concentration had returned to baseline. Next, participants were asked to lie supi[INVESTIGATOR_72301] a cushioned tilt -
table for autonomic and cardiovascular testing. Recordings of beat -to-beat blood pressure 
via finger plethysmography (NOVA; Finapres Medical Systems, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), heart rate (HR; electrocardiography), respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516] (pneumobelt), and muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) were established. After all autonomic and cardiovascular variables were obtained, participants rested for [ADDRESS_329722]. Following this non- recorded period, three supi[INVESTIGATOR_270450] (Omron HEM -907XL, Kyoto, Japan) 
after which 10- minutes of quiet, resting baseline data were obtained.  
 
 
Statistical  Analysis Plan 
All data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software (Version 29.0, IBM Corp.). Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152]- Wilk and skewness assessment were used to assess normality. Paired T -tests 
were utilized to assess differences  in cardiovascular and sympathetic measures at rest .

PURPOSE OF STUDY : 
Binge alcohol consumption can lead to negative health consequences. Our laboratory is 
interested in the impact of an evening binge alcohol consumption on overnight sleep and the nervous and cardiovascular systems the next morning.  
 To participate, you must be between the ages of 21- [ADDRESS_329730] not meet any 
of the following exclusion criteria:  
 
- Smoker  
- Body mass index >35 kg/m
[ADDRESS_329731] irregular menstrual cycles or are pregnant  
- Are female and taking hormonal contraceptives (within past 6 mo)  
- Have a moderate- to-severe Alcohol Use Disorder  
- Demonstrate substantial facial “flushing” after 1- [ADDRESS_329732] had prior cerebral spi[INVESTIGATOR_270451], abnormalities of the cribiform 
plate, prior history of head trauma, and/or pneumocephalus  
 
STUDY PROCEDURES & POTENTIAL RISKS:   
 Orientation:  
1. You will undergo an orientation to outline the study design and expectations. To do this, 
you will report to the Sleep Research Laboratory (CFT -5; Room 205) at Montana State 
University. You will be provided an oral overview of the research study, and we will 
answer any questions at this meeting. We will determine if you meet primary 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
2. If you meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, and remain interested after this orientation, you 
will complete and sign this approved IRB consent form.  
 
Study Design and Testing:  
1. You will be fitted with a wristwatch that will track your sleep -wake activity for 3 -5 
consecutive nights for baseline measurements (similar to a “FitBit”). You will also wear a 
device for [ADDRESS_329733] sleep apnea. You will be provided 
both verbal and written instructions on proper use of this equipment.  
 
2. Following these home sleep tests, you will be scheduled for three overnight visits to the 
Montana State Sleep Research Laboratory. Each day of testing, you will report to the 
Sleep Research Laboratory (CFT -5; Room 205) at 7:30AM, and we will give you breakfast 
and a to- go lunch box. You will then go about your normal daily routines.  
 
3. At ~4PM, you will report back to the Montana State Sleep Research Laboratory. Urine 
samples will be collected to determine your hydration status, and blood will be drawn to 
check for alcohol, testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol. We will also perform alcohol breathalyzer tests, which require blowing into a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. Measurements will be done to estimate blood pressure near your heart and how well your arteries stretch.  A ~5PM, you will be provided dinner.  
• Potential Risk : A needle will be placed in your arm for the blood draws. There 
is a very small risk of infection or bruising of the arm. To combat this, sterile techniques will be used. Some individuals can get lightheaded with blood draws.  If this happens, we will lie you down on the bed until you feel better.  We will also provide you the option to do the blood draw lying down as 
opposed to sitting position as this can also help.  
 
4. At 7:00 PM, you will complete questionnaires and computerized tests to assess your attention and reaction time. Devices to monitor your blood pressure and heart rate will be 
placed on your finger (i.e., finger cuff) and upper chest (i.e., surface electrodes. ) 
 
5. For the alcohol testing night, you will be provided a dose of alcohol known to mimic ‘binge’ drinking. This dose of alcohol is a “ 4-5 drink equivalent ”, and will be provided to 
you in two evenly divided doses at 8 and 9 PM. The alcohol beverage will be diluted in a 1:[ADDRESS_329734] of the cranberry or orange juice plus 1% alcohol added as a taste mask, in the same volume. All beverages will be sprayed with an alcohol mist that 
has a strong alcohol scent. Beverages will be served in opaque lidded cups. At both times 
(8 and 9PM), the drinks will be divided into thirds and you will have 5 min to consume each of the smaller (i.e., 1/3 size) drinks. A breathalyzer will be used every 15 min from 8 – 11 PM.  
• Potential Risk:  Mild intoxication levels will occur during the alcohol session. 
If at any time you are uncomfortable, or experience any negative side effects 
(e.g. speech problems, visual problems, dizziness, nausea, profuse sweating), the experiment will be stopped. Because alcohol will be consumed in the evening, and your heart rate will be monitored during the entire night with a laboratory technician, risks are minimal.  
 
6. At approximately 9:15 PM, various wires and electrodes will be placed on your head, 
face, thorax, abdomen, and legs measure your sleep from 11:00 – 7:00AM, a procedure 
called polysomnography. Wires and electrodes on your face will measure your brain waves. Breathing will be monitored from lightweight belts across your thorax and 
abdomen, and a nasal cannula (similar to what a person uses for oxygen) just under your nose for airflow. Leg movements will be measured from electrodes placed on your shin. You will repeat the questionnaires, arterial blood pressure measurements, and performance tests at 9:45 PM. A blood draw will occur at ~10:00PM to check for blood 
alcohol content. At ~10:[ADDRESS_329735] quietly in bed, with lights -out at 11:00 PM. 
From 11:00 PM – 7:[ADDRESS_329736] you with requested bathroom visits.  
 7. You will be woken at 7:[ADDRESS_329737] your heart rate using an electrocardiogram, blood pressure using a finger cuff, your nervous system using two small leg electrodes, and breathing rate using a belt 
around your stomach. The two leg electrodes will be inserted near the nerve at the back of 
your knee. You will be asked to perform three safe stress tasks designed to modestly increase your heart rate and blood pressure. These include forcefully blowing into a tube for 15 seconds (i.e., Valsalva maneuver), 2 min of your hand in a cold- water bucket (i.e., 
cold pressor test), and 5 min of mental arithmetic (i.e., mental stress test). An investigator will verbally explain and demo these three common tasks prior to beginning any of them.  
• Potential Risk : There is a very small risk of infection after insertion of the leg 
electrode. Sterile techniques will be used to help prevent infection. Also, about 7% of subjects experience some aching or “pi[INVESTIGATOR_5625]” 
sensations for a few days after the procedure. There is no specific treatment 
for these sensations, which are believed to be the result of tissue inflammation. In study volunteers who have experienced these sensations, they disappear spontaneously and completely without treatment within a few 
days. No reports of complications or infections have been reported after 
sessions. [CONTACT_157227] and his laboratory have safely performed over 400 successful sessions.  
 9. If your results show that alcohol increases the number of times you stop breathing at 
night, you will be invited for a fourth and final testing session in which you will repeat the alcohol treatment, and will be randomly (i.e., draw from a hat) assigned to either continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or “fake” CPAP.  CPAP is the typi[INVESTIGATOR_270452].  
• Potential Risk : Fake CPAP will not prevent the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_270453]. Thus, during fake CPAP these naturally occurring stops in 
breathing can potentially increase blood pressure, activate the nervous 
system, and increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. However, you will be continuously monitored throughout the entire night by a sleep technician who is trained to recognize severe and adverse cardiovascular events. In such cases, AASM guidelines will be followed and emergency medicine will be sought.   
 
COST TO PARTICIPATE ? There are no costs to participants.  
 
BENEFITS : There are no direct benefits to you as a volunteer for this study. However, 
you will be able to learn more about how your sleep is impacted by [CONTACT_270456].  
 
SUBJECT COMPENSATION: You will receive the following compensation for this project:  
1) $50 for the familiarization PSG night; 2) $[ADDRESS_329738] session, 
and $[ADDRESS_329739] udy. This compensation plan was approved through 
the National Institutes of Health.   
 
CONFIDENTIALITY : The data and personal information obtained from this study will be 
regarded as privileged and confidential with only the Project Director and research team  
having access to this information. Your right to privacy will be maintained in any ensuing 
analysis and/or presentation of the data by [CONTACT_270457]’s data. The self -report  questionnaires  that you provide will be retained within 
an encrypted computer folder  in our lab for 7 years (as required by [CONTACT_94081]), after which the 
document will be destroyed by [CONTACT_270458].  
 
FREEDOM OF CONSENT : You may stop testing at any time, or withdraw consent for 
participation in writing, by [CONTACT_270459] (as described above). Participation is completely voluntary . 
 In the UNLIKELY event that your participation in the study results in physical injury to you, the Project Director will advise and assist you in receiving medical treatment. No compensation is available from Montana State University for injury, accidents, or expenses that may occur as a result of your participation in this study. Additionally, no compensation is available from Montana State University for injury, accidents, or expenses that may occur as a result of traveling to and from your appointments at the MSU.

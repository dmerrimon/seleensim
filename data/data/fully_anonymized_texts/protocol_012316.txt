Confidential and Propri etary 7 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 2015Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1024262] 1 cycle of treatment.
The rando mization w ill be stratified by [CONTACT_27183] (non-squamous versus squamous).
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will be established to evaluate safety. 
Following the initial iDMC data review meeting, the iDMC will meet approximately every 6 
months per DMC charter (or more often if requested by [CONTACT_748986]) to assess safety data.  Details are outlined in the DMC charter.
The conduct of this trial will be overseen by a Steering Committee which will serve in an 
advisory capacity to the Sponsor.  
The study will be conducted in compliance wi th International Conference on Harmonisation 
(ICH) Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).
Study Population
Adult subjects with histologically confirmed d iagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic 
NSCLC, lacking anaplastic lymphoma kinase (A LK) or endothelial growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) mutations, who have been treated with [ADDRESS_1024263] that is 
required for primary, secondary and/or exploratory an alysis, as pre-specified in the protocol,
whichever is the later date.  
Study Treatments
CC-486/placebo w ill be administered at a dose of 300 mg orally daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day 
cycle. Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) i nfusion at a dose of 
200 mg (4 x 50 mg vials) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. 
Subjects may remain on treatment until radiologic  disease progression (for exceptions refer to 
Section 6.4.3 ), unacceptable toxicity, initiation of a new anticancer therapy, withdrawal of 
consent, subject refusal, physician decision, or death.
Overview of Efficacy Assessments
All subjects will be evaluated for tumor response and progression by [CONTACT_748987] 1.1 guidelines at screening and every 6 weeks (± 5 days) from 
randomization for the first 24 weeks, and every  9 weeks thereafter until documented disease 
progression (for exceptions refer to Section 6.4.3 ), start of new anticancer therapy, or 
withdrawal of consent. Subjects will also be ev aluated according to irRECIST guidelines in cases

Confidential and Propri etary 8 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 2015Response assessments will include computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) of the chest and abdomen/pelvis. Bone scans will only be  performed at baseline 
if clinically indicated. If the baseline bone scan is suggestive of metastasis, a CT or MRI should 
be performed and further follow-up of these lesions will follow the protocol schedule. Bone scans during the trial will only be performed if clinically indicated.  If suggestive of new lesions, 
a CT or MRI will be performed to confirm progression.
In the follow-up phase, anticancer treatmen t administered following the last dose of 
investigational product (IP) and survival will be followed every 8 weeks (± 5 days) until death, 
withdrawal of consent, or lost-to-follow-up, whichever occurs first, or the End of Trial.
Overview of Safety Assessments
All subjects will be monitored for adverse events, starting from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent form (ICF) until [ADDRESS_1024264] dose of either study drug. A thorough 
evaluation of medical conditions will be conducted during screening for eligibility. Documentedphysical examination (PE), vital signs, labor atory assessments, (eg, serum chemistry, 
hematology), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), urinalysis, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status will be monitored regularly. Preventative measures will be taken to avoid pregnancy in study subjects or their partners, and females of child-bearing 
potential will have regular pregnancy testing performed. The full schedu le of assessments is 
described in Table 2 and Section 6.
Overview of Statistical Methods
This is a doubl e-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase  2 trial designed to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety/tolerability of  CC-486 plus pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab plus 
placebo, in subjects with previously tr eated locally a dvanced or metastatic non-small cell l ung 
cancer. The primary endpoint is PFS based on Investigator review.
Sample Size
The primary goal of this study is to provide estimates of the difference in efficacy and safety 
between CC-486 + pembrolizumab and placebo + pembrolizumab. Approximately 90 subjects 
will be randomized 1:1 to receiv e CC-486 plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab. 
Primary analysis will be conducted when 70 PFS events occur. In this particular setting, a formal 
power calculation was not conducted.
Efficacy Analysis
Efficacy analyses will be performed us ing the intent-to- treat (ITT) population.
The median PFS in each stratum and treatment arm will be calculated based on Kaplan-Meier 
estimates along with corresponding two-sided 90% confidence interval (CI).  In addition, the 
Cox proportional hazards regression model with treatment and any stratification factors w ill be 
performed to obtain the point estimate of hazard ratio (HR) and two-sided 90% CI.  
The secondary efficacy endpoint of OS will be analyzed sim ilarly to PFS.  Ot her secondary 
endpoints of overall res ponse rate (ORR), and disease control rate (DCR) will be evaluated as 
well. A two-sided 90% CI of the difference in  ORR and DCR between the two treatment arms 
will be provided. &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21signs the signs the

Safety analysis will be performed using the safe ty population. Safety and tolerability will be 
monitored through continuous reporting of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events 
(SAEs), laboratory abnormalities, and inciden ce of subjects experiencing adverse events 
resulting in dose reductions, dose interruptions, and/or premature discontinuation of study drugs. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), TEAEs leading to death or discontinuation from 
treatment, events assessed as Grade 3 or Gr ade 4,  vital signs, weight, clinical laboratory 
information, and concomitant medications/ procedures will be tabulated and summarized.
All AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
All TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_6657], frequency, severity grade based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) (Version 4.0) 
and relationship to treatment. Serious TEAEs, TEAEs of interest, and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation, dose reduction, or interruption, or death will be summarized/ listed separately.DRA)DRA) . .

1.1. Disease Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men 
and women. Globally, approximately 1,825,000 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed in
2012, and 1,590,000 deaths occurre d due to this disease ( Globocan, 2012 ). The World Health
Organization (WHO) divides lung cancer into 2 major classes based on its biology, therapy, and prognosis: NSCLC and small cell lung cancer. NSCLC accounts for more than 85% of all lung 
cancer cases and includes 2 major types: (1) non-squamous carcinoma (including 
adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, other cell types); and (2) squamous cell (epi[INVESTIGATOR_015]) carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung cancer seen 
in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and is also the mo st frequently occurring cell type in nonsmokers 
(Speicher, 2000 ).
Cigarette smoking remains the most impor tant risk factor for lung cancer, although 
approxima tely 15% of all lung cancers are diagnosed in patients who never smoked.
One reason for the high mortality r ate of lung can cer is the advanced stage at diagnosis; only 25-
30% of new NSCLC cases are diagnosed with localized disease that is potentially curable with 
surgery ( Fossella, 2000 ; Lang-Lazdunski, 2013 ). The majority of patients are diagnosed with 
locally advanced or metastatic disease and are not candidates for surgery.
1.2. Treatment Options in Second-line Metastatic NSCLC
In patients with metastatic NSCLC who have experienced disease progression either during or after first-line therapy and have an Easte rn Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance 
score of 0-2, single agent docetaxel, gemcitabine, or erlotinib is recommended if not previously 
given. Pemetrexed is another option for the non-squamous subtype of NSCLC ( NCCN, 2014 , 
ESMO, 2014 ).  
Docetaxel was shown to be superior to best supportive care (BSC), vinorelbine and ifosfamide; 
nevertheless, using either the weekly or three-weekly schedule in multiple randomized studies 
the observed response rate with docetaxel ranged from 3% to 12%, progression-free survival (PFS) from 1.9 to 3.4 months, and overall survival (OS) from 5.4 to 9.2 months ( Shepherd, 2000 ; 
Fossella, 2000 ; Bria, 2006 ).
Recently, nintedanib, a triple angiokinase inhib itor, was approved in the European Union (EU) in 
combination with docetaxel as second-line therapy for NSCLC. The results showed that 
compared to docetaxel alone, nintedanib plus docetaxel significantly extended the median OS
from 10.[ADDRESS_1024276]-line 
chemotherapy (P=0.0359; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83) ( Reck, 2014 ). In addition, ramucirumab was 
approved in the US in combination with docetaxel  as second-line therapy. The phase 3 REVEL 
trial compared ramucirumab, a vascular e ndothelial growth factor (VEGFR)-[ADDRESS_1024277], plus 
docetaxel with placebo plus  docetaxel in NSCLC patients who experienced disease progression 
after treatment with platinum-based chemother apy for locally advanced or metastatic disease.
Median OS was better in the ramucirumab group than in the placebo group (10.5 vs 9.1 months; &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21nd d

2014 ).
Gemcitabine showed modest activ ity in a phase II study with a 6.2% partial response and [ADDRESS_1024278]-line cisplatin-containing therapy ( Sculier, 2000 ).  Another phase II study found a partial response in
19% of subjects treated with gemcitabine as a second-line agent, and a median duration of 
response of 29 weeks ( Crino, 1999 ).  In a third trial evaluating gemcitabine plus BSC versus 
BSC alone, tumor response was seen in 19% of gemcitabine-tr eated subj ects while response was 
not measured in subjects treated with BSC alone ( Anderson, 2000 ).  There was no difference in 
OS (5.7 versus 5.9 months, respectively).   The differe nce in the results between the trials may be 
due to the percentage of stage III versus stage IV subjects included in the trials.  In the study by 
[CONTACT_748988]. 96% of subjects had stage IV disease compared to 59% and 40% in Crino et al. and 
Anderson et al., respectively.
Erlotinib has been proven to be superior to BSC with significantly improved survival (6.7 vs. 4.7 
months), PFS (2.2 vs. 1.8 months), and delayed time to symptom deterioration ( Shepherd, 2005 ).
Gefitinib is approved in the EU for the treatment of advanced and metastatic NSCLC with 
activating mutations of endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) only. Although a higher 
response rate was in favor of gefitinib compared to placebo (8% vs. 1%), median time to 
progression (TTP) (3.0 vs. 2.6 months) and survival (5.6 vs. 5.1 months) were similar in the 2groups ( Thatcher, 2005 ). A non-inferiority trial compared gefitinib to docetaxel in NSCLC 
patients after 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy ( Kim, 2008 ). A similar median survival (7.6 vs. 8 
months) and TTP (2.2 vs. 2.7 months) were observed, but less toxicity and better quality of life favored the gefitinib arm.
Pemetrexed showed clinically equivalent efficacy  outcomes but better tolerability when 
compared to docetaxel in p atients with the non-squamous subtype of NSCLC ( Hanna, 2004 ; 
Peterson, 2007 ). 
An overview of the published data with the above described agents are summarized in Table 1 .

EGFR and/or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation(s) should receive targeted therapy.  
The EGFR mutation which results in the activat ion of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain has 
been reported in about 20-25% of non-squamous NSCLC cases and less than 5% in tumors with 
squamous histology.  Erlotinib and afatinib are EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) indicated 
for first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substituti on mutations, the most commonly f ound mutations in 
NSCLC ( Tarceva
®Package Insert ; Gilotrif®Package Insert ; NCCN, 2014 ).  Patients who 
progress after first-line therapy are still recommended to be continued on erlotinib or afatinib as 
part of second-line therapy ( NCCN, 2014 ).  Anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation, another 
key driver mutation, occurs in roughly 5% of NSCLC cases ( Shaw, 2013 ), and it is mostly 
associated with the adenocarcinoma subtype ( Bang, 2011 ; Xalkori Package I nsert ).  Tumors with 
this mutation are amenable to treatment with criz otinib, an ALK, MET, and ROS1 tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor, and thus, crizotinib is used in first-line therapy for metastatic ALK-positive 
NSCLC patients.  For patients who progress after first-line therapy, crizotinib or the recently approved ALK inhibitor, ceritinib, is recommended as part of second-line therapy ( NCCN, 
2014 ).  This trial will focus on second-line therapy for subjects who do not possess these 2 driver 
mutations.  Thus, EGFR-positive and ALK-positive subjects will be excluded from this trial.  
The reported response rate to second-line therapy has generally been less than 10% ( NCCN, 
2014 ), and many patients who respond to second-line therapy eventually develop resistance.  The 
limited effective second-line therapy options  available call for the investigation of novel 
approaches to drug therapy in advanced NSCLC.
1.3. Overview of CC-486
CC-486 is an orally bioav ailable formulation of a zacitidine (AZA).  A zacitidine, an analog of the 
pyrimidine nucleoside cytidine, has effects on cell differentiation, gene expression, and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis and metabolism, and causes cytotoxicity.
Vidaza® (azacitidine injection) is approved by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) for 
five subtypes of the French American British (FAB) classification system of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Vidaza is also approved by 
[CONTACT_748990], acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 
CMMoL patients who are not eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  Vidaza can be administered by [CONTACT_33980] (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) routes as designated by [CONTACT_72627].
After its incorporation into a cell’s DNA during the S-phase of the cell cycle, AZA forms 
covalent adducts with DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and depletes this enzyme required for 
the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns, thereby [CONTACT_748991][INVESTIGATOR_72594].   
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_72595] (DNA and histone proteins) that mediate the stable transmission of a gene’s transcriptional status through cell division.  One of 
the first recognized epi[INVESTIGATOR_72596].  The addition of a 
methyl group to cytosine in the dinucleotide CpG is catalyzed by [CONTACT_72629] (DNMTs) and is associated with tran scriptional suppresion of genes ( Miranda, 2007 ). Genomic 
methylation patterns are precisely regulated during normal embryonic development and &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21nib as nib as

Protocol CC-486-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 21 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: [ADDRESS_1024280] been found to be altered in specific ways in cancer.  Specifically, cancer 
cell genomes are typi[INVESTIGATOR_748955]1 as well as genes encoding proteins required for apoptosis, including caspase 8, DAPK and Apaf-1.  DNA methylation-based gene  silencing can thus contribute to the 
establishment and maintenance of the transformed state and limit the effectiveness of anticancer 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].
CC-486 entered clinical testing in 2006 in subjects with MDS, CMMoL, and AML.  The AZA 
PH US 2007 CL 005 study has shown that CC-486 is bioavailable and a maximum tolerated dose 
(MTD) of 480 mg daily for 7 days of a 28-day cycle was defined based on dose- limiting dia rrhea 
at the 600 mg dose ( Garcia-Manero, 2011 ).  As expected, reversible and manageable 
myelosuppression was observed.  Pharmacodynamic activity (DNA hypomethylation) and 
clinical responses were obse rved with CC-486, although the cros s-over design (with SC Vidaza 
administered during Cycle 1) confounded the interpretation of these responses in Part 1 of the 
study.
The second part of the AZA PH US 2007 CL 005 study explored both daily and twice daily 
extended dosing schedules of 14 and 21 days out of 28 days in a non-crossover design.  CC-486 
administered at 300 mg once daily (QD) for 14 or 21 days of a 28-day cycle produces cumulative 
exposures (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC] per cycle) that are approximately 40% and 60% of the exposure achieved with the labeled dose and schedule of Vidaza, 
respectively.  Daily doses of [ADDRESS_1024281] proven to  be tolerated on both the 14 and 21 out of 28-
day schedules with myelosuppression, gastroin testinal (GI) symptoms, and fatigue being the 
most common toxicities ( Garcia-Manero, 2011 ).
In the AZA PH US [ADDRESS_1024282] udy, DNA methylation levels in blood were measured as a 
pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint, to determine DNA hypomethylating activity of CC-486.  In summary, it was confirmed that CC-486 is biol ogically active, reducing DNA methylation when 
administered at low doses on extended schedules.
CC-486 is also under clinical investigation, either as monot herapy or in combination with other 
investigational products, for the treatment of ly mphoma, multiple myeloma, and relapsed or 
refractory solid tumors (eg, urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra; 
pancreatic carcinoma; breast cancer; ovarian cancer; nasopharyngeal carcinoma; cervical carcinoma; anal carcinoma; and merkel cell carcinoma).   
 There are 2 ongoing studies 
evaluating PK of CC-486 (AZA-ST-001 and CC-223-NSCL-001).
1.3.1. CC-[ADDRESS_1024283] atin or nab-paclitaxel, or as a single 
agent in subjects with relapsed or refractory so lid tumors (AZA-ST-001) was initiated on 30 Nov 
2011.  In Part 1 of this two-part study, CC-486 at escalating doses of 200 or 300 mg was 
administered on Days 1 to 14 of a 21-day cycle in three separate arms of the study (Arm A, Arm 
B, Arm C). 
In Arm A of AZA-ST-001, subjects received carboplatin (AUC = 4) on Day 8 of each cycle and

1.4. Overview of Pembrolizumab
The programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is an immune-checkpoint receptor expressed by T cells upon activation.  The normal function of PD-1 upon binding by [CONTACT_344752], programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, is to moderate ongoing immune responses and prevent 
autoimmunity ( Harvey, 2014 ).  Some tumor cells up-regulate the PD-1 ligands to evade active T-
cell immune surveillance. Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the PD-1 receptor and dir ectly blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its 
ligands, thereby [CONTACT_748992] (pembrolizumab
IB).  Pembrolizumab is being investigated in various oncology indications including melanoma, NSCLC, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), breast cancer , multiple myeloma (MM), microsatellite 
unstable tumors, and head and neck cancer. Pembrolizumab was recently approved in the US for 
the treatment of advanced, unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma, and for use in melanoma patients with dis ease progression after prior treatment with (a) ipi[INVESTIGATOR_90913] (b) a

1.4.1. Pembrolizumab Experience in Solid Tumors and Safety
An open-label phase 1 trial (Keynote 001) is being conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical 
activity of single ag ent pembrolizumab. The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three 
dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, admin istered every 2 weeks, in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors. All 3 dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities
(DLTs) were observed. Based on PK data showing a half-life of  21 days, the dosing frequency 
in the expansion cohort has been changed to every 3 weeks. 
The choice of the 200 mg every 3 weeks as an appropriate dose for the switch to fixed dosing is 
based on simulations performed using the population PK model of pembrolizumab showing that 
the fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks will provide exposures that 1) are optimally consistent 
with those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose every 3 weeks, 2) will maintain individual patient exposures in the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal efficacy 
response and 3) will maintain individual patients exposure in the exposure range established in 
melanoma that are well tolerated and safe. 
The ongoing expansion cohort in Keynote 001 is enrolling subjects with NSCLC.
Keynote 001, Part C enrolled 38 subjects with NSCLC (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell 
carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma) who experienced progression of cancer after initiation of their second line of systemic therapy to receiv e monotherapy pembrolizumab. By [CONTACT_10670]-
assessed immune-related Evaluation Criteria in So lid Tumors (irRECIST), the overall response 
rate (ORR) (confirmed and unconfirmed) was 24%. Similar results were obtained using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, yielding an ORR (confirmed and 
unconfirmed) of 21%. Most responses by [CONTACT_748993] 9. The median duration of response by [CONTACT_748994] a median duration of follow-up of 62 weeks. The median OS for all 38 patients treated with 
pembrolizumab was 51 weeks.
Pembrolizumab has been generally well-tolerated in  subjects with solid tumors at doses up to 10 
mg/kg every other week without DLTs.  Of the [ADDRESS_1024287] commonly reported treatment-em ergent AEs experienced were fatigue 
(43.8%), nausea (26.7%), cough (25.3%), pruritus (24.6%), diarrhoea (22.3%), and rash (21.5%).   466 subjects (97.3%) experienced treatment-emergent AEs of which 368 (76.8%) were 
considered drug-related. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in 30.1% of patients, but 
SAEs that were attributed as potentially (possibly, probably, or definitely) drug-related by [CONTACT_458526] 6.7% of patients overall. Five patients died within [ADDRESS_1024288] dose of pembrolizumab; none of the deaths were considered drug-related.
Preliminary results from Part C only (previously-treated NSCLC pa tients) reported the incidence 
of drug-r elated AEs to be 53%, usually Grade 1-[ADDRESS_1024289] commonly 
rash (21.1%), pruritus (18.4%), fatigue (15.8%), diarrhea (13.2%), and arthralgia (10.5%).

pembrolizumab is generally tolerable and AEs are generally manageable in NSCLC patients
(pembrolizumab IB).
In Part C of the study, 2 patients developed pneum onitis and 1 patient was reported with steroid-
responsive pulmonary edema. Two cases were Gr ade 2; the case of pulmonary edema was Grade 
3. These cases began as early as [ADDRESS_1024290] dose to several cycles (Week 18) after the 
first dose. It is not clear the role of prior thor acic radiation to the development of this AE. The 
Grade 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_748957], whereas the Grade 2 cases did not. The Grade 3
pulmonary edema and a case of Grade 2 pneumonitis were considered drug-related; the third 
case was considered not drug-related. All [ADDRESS_1024291] shown pro mising activity and acceptable tolerability in 
patients with relapsed or refractory NSCLC as detailed in Sections 1.3.1 and 1.4.1 .
The reported response rate to second-line therapy in NSCLC has generally been less than 10% 
(NCCN, 2014 ), and many patients who do respond eventually develop resistance.  The limited 
availability of effective second-line therapy options call for the investigation of novel approaches 
to drug therapy in advanced NSCLC.  One potential strategy is the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_366870], such as CC-486, to prime the tumor to become more responsive to immunotherapy. This approach is 
proposed by [CONTACT_748996]-[ADDRESS_1024292] shown that epi[INVESTIGATOR_748958] a role in  tumor progression in lung cancer ( Topaloglu, 2004 ).  
Importantly, unlike gene mutations, DNA methylation is reversible and can be inhibited by a 
DNMTi ( Zeng, 2013 ).  There are currently [ADDRESS_1024293] been 
approved by [CONTACT_748997], i.e., 2 DNMT inhibitors for 
myelodysplastic syndrome (azacitidine and decitabine) and 2 histone deacetylase (HDAC) 
inhibitors for cutaneous T- cell lymphoma (vorinostat and romidepsin).  A recent study using the 
combination epi[INVESTIGATOR_748959], an HDAC inhibitor, in subjects 
with recurrent metastatic NSCLC who had ex tensive prior systemic therapy yielded some 
interesting results ( Juergens, 2011 ).  Though only two of the [ADDRESS_1024294] responded to various subsequent therapeutic regimens ( Juergens, 2011 ). Five 
of these subjects received 1 of 2 investigational immunotherapy drugs, anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1antibody.  Preliminary data revealed that 3 sub jects experienced durable partial responses for 
over a year while the other two subjects had stab le disease on therapy for more than 6 months 
(Brahmer, 2013 ).  
Previous PD-1 immune-checkpoint targeting monot herapy studies in subjects with advanced 
NSCLC who received previous systemic therapy reported only a 16 to 17% response rate 
(Brahmer, 2012 ; Topalian, [ADDRESS_1024295] , Garon 2014 ). 
The results of the above study led to the hy pothesis that azacitidine may  prime the tumor to 
become more responsive to immunotherapy.  There are several possible mechanisms as to how 
this may occur ( Brahmer 2013 ): (&(/*(1(35235aa35,(7$5<,1)250$7,21d

6.3. Follow-up Period
6.3.1. Efficacy Follow-up
All subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, start of new
anticancer therapy, or withdrawal of consent from the entire study will be followed for tumor
response assessments and subsequent anticancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72602] 6.4.
6.3.2. Survival Follow-up
After the end of treatment (EOT) v isit, all subjects will be followed every 8 weeks (± 5 days) for 
survival until withdrawal of consent, death, or lost to follow-up, whichever occurs first, or until 
the End of Trial. Subsequent anticancer therapie s should be collected at the same schedule. New 
anticancer therapy includes (but is not limited to) any systemic or local medication, surgery, radiation, or any other therapy inte nded to treat the subject’s cancer.
Survival follow-up may be conducted by [CONTACT_72634] (including public records) and/or
telephone contact [CONTACT_1155], family, or the subject’s treating physician.
6.4. Response Assessments
Response assessments (tumor evaluations) shoul d be performed at Screen ing within 21 days 
before the start of IPs, and every 6 weeks (± 5 days) from randomization for the first 24 weeks, 
then every 9 weeks thereafter until disease progression (for exceptions refer to Section 6.4.3 ), 
start of a new anticancer therapy, or withdra wal of consent from the entire study. Tumor 
assessments should also be performed at any time, if clinically indicated.  Subjects with

Response assessments include computed tomography (CT) scan or MRI.  The regions to be 
imaged are the chest and abdomen/pelvis, including whole liver and kidney. In case of 
metastases to other organs not covered with these scans, the regions need to be included in the 
scans as well. If brain metastases are documented at baseline, brain imaging should be continued throughout the study. Bone scans will only be performed at baseline if clinically indicated. If at 
baseline, the bone scan is suggestive of bone lesi ons, CT or MRI will be used both at baseline 
and subsequent scans. Bone scans during the trial will only be performed if clinically indicated and if suggestive of new lesions, a CT or MRI w ill be performed to confirm the new lesion. Any 
skeletal lesions identified at baseline should be fo llowed at the same schedule. The same mode of 
imaging for lesion evaluation at Screening mu st be used consistently throughout the study. 
Adherence to the planned imaging schedule is critical regardless of dose delays or unscheduled 
or missed assessments; scans must follow the cal endar and not be adjusted for delays in 
treatment.
The CT imaging should include contrast unless medically contraindicated. Conventional CT 
should be performed with contiguous cuts of [ADDRESS_1024320] should be 
performed by [CONTACT_2363] a 5 mm c ontiguous reconstruction algorithm.
All subjects with evidence of objective tumor response (CR or PR) should have the response 
confirmed with repeat assessments at the next scheduled scan, but after no less than [ADDRESS_1024321] 1.1, tumor assessment should be repeated ≥4 weeks 
later in order to confirm PD (per irRECIST) with the option of continuing treatment per below 
while awaiting radiologic confirmation of progression.  If repeat imaging shows a reduction in 
the tumor burden compared to the init ial scan demonstr ating PD, treatment may be continued as 
per treatment calendar.  If repeat imaging confirms progressive disease, subjects will be discontinued from study therapy (exception noted in Table 3 ).  In determining whether or not the 
tumor burden has increased or decreased, Investigators should consider all target lesions as well 
as non-target lesions. Refer to Appendix B for additional information.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21ed d

At specific sites, for the first 10-12 subjects randomized to each Arm, mandatory 
pharmacokinetics will be collected. Blood samples for CC-486 PK assessment will be collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 prior to the dose administration of CC-486/placebo, known as 
predose, and over the 8-hour period following each dose administration of CC-486/placebo at 
0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, and [ADDRESS_1024322]-dose (see Table 4 ).  These samples will be

the clinic.
The Pharmacy Manual contains specific instructions for pembrolizumab dose calculation, 
reconstitution, preparation of the infusion fluid, and administration.
8.2. Treatment Administration and Schedule
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive CC-486 plus pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab plus placebo. CC-486/placebo will be administered at a dose of [ADDRESS_1024341] arrive to the clinic in the fasting state (ie, no food 
or drink [except water] for approximately 8 - 10 hours) for all predose safety laboratory 
evaluations. Dose administration should take place after all scheduled predose safety assessments 
are completed.
Subjects will ingest CC-486/placebo with approximately 240 mL (8 ounces) of room temperature 
water.  CC-486/placebo may be tak en on an empty stomach or with food (a light breakfast or 
meal of up to approximately 600 calories).
If following CC-486/placebo administration an emesis event occurs, subjects should not take 
additional drug on that same day. It is recommended that the subject receives an antiemetic 30 
minutes prior to all subsequent CC-486 doses.
Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30- minute IV infusion at a dose of 200 mg (4 x 50 mg

site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion t ime of 24-40 minutes).
Pembrolizumab should be co-administered with CC-486.
For subjects enrolled in the PK population, the treatment administration on PK days (i.e., Day 1 
of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2) is described below:
!After performing the required overnight fast, taking antiemetic premedication with 
240 mL of water for nausea and vomiting (eg, ondansetron), and completing the 
required predose assessments (including the pr edose PK sample), subjects will ingest 
CC-486/placebo with 240 mL of room tempe rature water in the clinic a pproximately 
30 minutes after antiemetic administration on each PK dosing day.  Each dose of   
CC-486/placebo should be given at approximately the same time each day.  The exact date and time of dosing will be recorded in the source docu ments and appropriate 
CRF.
!On Day 1 of Cycle 1 only, pembrolizumab will be administered as described above, 
but administration will start after the 6 hour CC-486 PK sample co llection time-point.
Dietary restrictio ns on PK days (i.e., Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2): 
!Subjects should be instructed to limit their coffee intake to one 8-ounce cup of black 
coffee (no cream or sugar) and to not consume alcohol, tea, chocolate, or cola beverages within 2 hours prior to collecting PK samples.
!Subjects should not ingest food for a minimum of 8 hours prior and 2 hours after CC-
486/placebo is administered.  Water can be allowed as desi red excep t for 1 hour 
before and after CC-486/placebo administration.  The only water permitted in the 1-hour period before CC-486/placebo administration is the 240 mL of water for 
antiemetic ingestion.
8.2.1. Dose Adjustment Guidelines
[IP_ADDRESS]. CC-486 (oral azacitidine)/Placebo
For CC-486/placebo, a maximum of 1 dose reducti on will be allowed from the original dose (eg, 
patients can dose reduce fro m 300 mg/placebo or al daily dose to 200 mg/placebo oral daily 
dose). Re-escalation to the higher dose is not permitted. If a subject requires more than 1 dose 
reduction for CC-486/placebo, they will be discontinued from CC-486/placebo, however, they may continue to receive pembrolizumab (and conversely, subjects who discontinue 
pembrolizumab may continue to receive CC-486/placebo) but must continue to undergo all 
safety and efficacy assessments as per  Table 2 .

9.1. Permitted Concomitant Medications and Procedures
9.1.1. CC-486 (oral azacitidine)
In general, the use of any c oncomitant medication/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_72608].
All concomitant treatments, including blood and blood products, must be reported on the CRF. 
Subjects may be administered supportive and palliative care (eg, pain control, anti-nausea, anti-
diarrheal) as clinically indicated throughout the study. 
Myeloid growth factors (granulocyte col ony stimulating factor [G-CSF] and granulocyte 
macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) should be administered according to 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines only for the treatment of neutropenic infections.
Antiemetics are not required during the study, except for subjects enrolled in the PK population; 
at the Investigator’s discretion, subjects not enrolled in the PK population may also receive prophy lactic antiemetic therapy (eg, a serotonin [5-H T3] receptor antagonist such as  
ondansetron) approximately [ADDRESS_1024353] sign of diarrhea.  Pre-
medication with antidiarrheal medication for subs equent doses of CC-486 may be appropriate at 
the Investigator’s discretion.
9.1.2. Pembrolizumab Supportive Care
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by [CONTACT_422515].  Suggested supportive care measures for the management of adverse events 
with potential immunologic etiology are outlined below and in greater detail in the events of clinical interest (ECI) guidance in Appendix C . Where appropriate, these guidelines include the 
use of oral or intravenous treatment with corticosteroids as well as additional anti-inflammatory 
agents if symptoms do not improve with administration of corticosteroids.  Note that several courses of steroid tapering may be necessary as symptoms may worsen when the steroid dose is 
decreased. For each disorder, attempts should be made to rule out other causes such as metastatic 
disease or bacterial or viral infection, which might require additional supportive care. The
treatment guidelines are intended to be applied when the Investigator determines the events to be 
related to pembrolizumab. 
Note: if after the evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the Investigator is 
instructed to follow the ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment 
guidance (as outlined in the ECI guidance). Refer to Table 6 for dose modification guidelines 
for pembrolizumab. 
It may be necessary to perform conditional procedures such as bronchoscopy, endoscopy, or skin 
photography as part of evaluation of the event. Suggested conditional procedures, as appropriate, 
can be found in the ECI guidance.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21CRF. CRF.

abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such 
as peritoneal signs and ileus).  
!All subjects who experience diarrhea/colitis should be advised to drink liberal 
quantities of clear fluids.  If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and 
electrolytes should be substituted via IV infusion.  For Grade 2 or higher diarrhea, 
consider GI consultation and endoscopy to confirm or rule out colitis.
!For Grade 2 diarrhea/colitis that persists greater than 3 days, administer oral 
corticosteroids. 
!For Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea/colitis that persists > 1 week, treat with intravenous steroids 
followed by [CONTACT_78018].  
!When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.

10.1. Overview
This is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, phase 2 trial designed to estimate the 
efficacy and safety/tolerability of CC-[ADDRESS_1024355] ical analysis methods will be documented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).
10.2. Study Population Definitions
10.2.1. Intent-To-Treat Population
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all randomized subjects.  All efficacy 
analyses will be based on the ITT population, unless otherwise specified.  The efficacy analyses will be performed according to treatment assigned at randomization.
10.2.2. Safety Population
The safety population will cons ist of any enro lled sub jects who received at least [ADDRESS_1024356] imates of the difference in efficacy and safety 
between CC-486 plus pembrolizumab and placebo plus pembrolizumab. 
Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized 1:[ADDRESS_1024357] occurred.

and follow-up phases.  A summary of subjects enrolled by [CONTACT_27707]. Protocol deviations will be summarized using frequency tabulations.
10.6. Efficacy Analysis
10.6.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary endpoint PFS will be defined as the time from the randomization date to disease 
progression assessed by [CONTACT_749006] 1.[ADDRESS_1024360] assessment prior to receiving the 
anti-cancer therapy. Subjects with 2 or more missing response assessments prior to a visit with documented disease progression (or death) will be censored at the last visit where the subject 
was documented to be PFS event-free.  A sensit ivity analysis will be performed with censoring 
rules that follow the principles of assigning the date of event based on the time of the first evidence of objective progression or death regardless of violations, discontinuation of IP or 
change of therapy.

any stratification factors as model covariates.  The Kaplan-Meier curve for PFS will be presented
for each treatment group and strata.
10.6.2. Secondary Endpoints
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Survival
Overall survival (OS) will be defined as the time from the date of rando mization to the date of 
death (any cause).  Subjects who are alive will be censored at the last time that the subject was 
known to be alive. The OS analysis may also be conducted at the time when 70 deaths occur, in 
addition to when the primary analysis is performed.
Medians of overall survival including two-sided 90% CI for each treatment group w ill be 
calculated.  The hazard ratio and a two-sided 90% CI will be estimated using Cox proportional 
hazard model with treatment, and all stratification factors in the model.  The Kaplan-Meier curve 
for survival will be presented for each strata and treatment group.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Overall Response Rate (ORR)
Overall response rate is the percentage of sub jects that achieve a confirmed complete or partial 
response as assessed by [CONTACT_749008] 1.1 guideline. This rate will be 
presented for each treatment group and strata.  The 90% CI of the response rates will be 
provided.  A two-sided 90% CI of the Response rate differences between pembrolizumab plus 
placebo and pembrolizumab plus CC -486 arm, with each strata and overall w ill be provided.

or discontinuation from treatment, events assessed as Grade 3 or Grade 4,  vital signs, weight, 
clinical laboratory information, and concomitant medications/procedures will be tabulated and 
summarized.
Treatment-emergent adverse events will be coded according to MedDRA. All TEAEs will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_14340], frequency, severity grade based 
on the CTCAE (Version 4.0) and relationship to treatment. Serious adverse events, events of interest, and events leading to discontinuation or death will be listed separately.
10.8. Pharmacokinetic Analysis
When appropriate, plasma PK samples collected will be analyzed for CC-486 concentration determination using a validated high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric method.
10.8.1. Plasma Concentrations
By-subject listing of pharmacokinetic blood sample collection times as well as derived sampling 
time deviations will be provided.  CC-486 plasma concentrations will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics (N, arithmetic mean, standard deviation, standard error, minimum, median, maximum, percent coefficient of variation, geometric mean, and geometric percent coefficient of 
variation) for each cycle, if/when appropriate.  Concentrations that are below the limit of 
quantitation (BLQ) will be treated as zero for th e computation of descriptive statistics. Missing 
concentrations and concentrations from blood samples collected more than ± 10% of nominal 
time will be omitted from the calculation of descriptive statistics.
Individual subject concentration-time data and mean concentration-time data for each cycle will 
be graphically presented on linear and semi-logarithmic scales.
Following single dose administration, predose samples that are BLQ or missing will be assigned 
a numerical value of zero for the calculation of AUC .  Any anomalous concentration values 
observed at predose will be identified in the clinical study report (CSR) and used for the 
computation of AUC.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be computed if the anomalous value is
not greater than 5% of the C
max.  If the anomalous value is greater than 5% of C max, the computed 
pharmacokinetic parameters for the given subject will be dropped from the pharmacokinetic 
analysis.  
Any other BLQ concentrations will be assigned a value of zero if they precede quantifiable 
samples in the initial portion of the profile.  A BL Q value that occurs between quantifiable data 
points, especially prior to C max, will be evaluated to determine if an assigned concentration of 
zero makes sense, or if reanalysis or exclusion of the data is warranted.  Following C max, BLQ 
values embedded between 2 quantifiable data points will be treated as missing when calculating 
AUC.  BLQ values occurring at the end of the collection interval (after the last quantifiable 
concentration) will be treated as missing data.  If consecutive BLQ concentrations are followed by [CONTACT_27712], these quantified 
values will be excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis by [CONTACT_27713] a value of missing, 
unless otherwise warranted by [CONTACT_27714]-time profile.  For the purpose of analysis, these 
trailing BLQ values may be designated as zero in the dataset if the pharmacokinetic program &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21tration tration

10.8.2. Pharmacokinetic Parameters
The following PK parameters will be calculated for CC-486:
AUC inf Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time 0 extrapolated 
to infinity, calculated as [AUC t+ Ct/∀z].  Ct is the last quantifiable 
concentration. No AUC extrapolation will be performed with unreliable 
∀z.  If AUC %Extrap is ≥25%, AUC inf will not be reported
AUC t Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from Time [ADDRESS_1024362] quantifiable concentration, calculated by [CONTACT_27715].
C
max Maximum observed plasma concentration, obtained directly from the 
observed concentration versus time data.
Tmax Time to C max, obtained directly from the observed concentration versus 
time data.
t1/2 Terminal phase half-life in plasma, calculated as [(ln 2)/ ∀z].  t 1/2will only 
be calculated when a reliable estimate for ∀zcan be obtained.  
CL/F Apparent total clearance, calculated as [Dose/AUC inf]. 
Vz/F Apparent volume of distribution, calculated as [(CL/F)/ ∀z].
The following PK parameters for CC-486 will be calculated for diagnostic purposes and listed, 
but they will not be summarized:
∀z Apparent terminal rate constant, calculated by [CONTACT_27716]-concentration versus time curve in plasma.  Visual assessment will be used to identify the terminal linear phase of the 
concentration versus time profile.  A minimum of three data points will be 
used for calculation.  
∀z will not be estimated if the terminal phase of the log-concentration 
versus time profile does not exhibit a linear decline phase, or if the 
regression coefficient < 0.8.  &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,210 extrapola0 extrapola

laboratory test values (as specified by [CONTACT_14540] 11.3), regardless of etiology. Any 
worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse ch ange in the frequency or intensity of a pre-
existing condition) should be cons idered an AE.  A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on 
the AE page of the CRF rather than the indi vidual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis or 
syndrome. 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity to an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated with an AE should be reported on the overdose CRF. (See Section 8.2.2 for the definition of overdose.) Any sequela 
of an accidental or intentional overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an 
AE on the AE CRF. If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on an SAE report form and on the AE CRF. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be 
identified as the cause of the event on the SAE report form and CRF but should not be reported 
as an SAE itself.
In the event of overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should receive 
supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for CC-486 and 
pembrolizumab overdose. Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician.
All subjects will be monitored for AEs during the study.  Assessments may include monitoring 
of any or all of the following parameters:   the subject’s clinical symptoms, laboratory, 
pathological, radiological or surgical findings , physical examination findings, or findings from 
other tests and/or procedures.
All AEs will be recorded by [CONTACT_292004] [ADDRESS_1024365]’s source documents.  All SAEs must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety  within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge 
of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form.
In addition, adverse events known as pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) must also 
be recorded on the Adverse Event CRFs and re ported within 5 days of the Investigator’s 
knowledge of the event, regardless of whether or not the Investigator considers the event related to the IP. If the event meets serious criteria (SAE), the event must also reported to Celgene Drug 
Safety within 24 hours by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or

Protocol CC-486-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 65 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: [ADDRESS_1024367] initiates a 
new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, whether or not related to pembrolizumab. 
See Section 11.5.1 (or Section 11.7) as well as Appendix C for detailed guidance on the 
reporting of pembrolizumab ECIs.  
11.2. Evaluation of Adverse Events
A qualified Investigator will evaluate all adverse events as to: 
11.2.1. Seriousness 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE occurring at any dose that:
!Results in death;
!Is life-threatening (i.e., in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE);
!Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27588] 
(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_19357], regardless of length of stay);
!Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions);
!Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;
!Constitutes an important medical event.
Important medical events are defined as thos e occurrences that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or disability, but may jeopardize the subject or 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5315]:
!A standard procedure for protocol therapy administration.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_493051] a comp lication of therapy administration will be 
reported as an SAE. 
!Routine treatment or monitoring of the studi ed indication not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.
!The administration of blood or platelet transfusion as routine treatment of studied 
indication.  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27589] a complication 
of such transfusion remains a reportable SAE.
!A procedure for protocol/disease-related investigations (eg, surgery, scans, 
endoscopy, sampling for laboratory tests, bone marrow sampling).  However, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27590] a complication of such procedures 
remains a reportable SAE.
!Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27591], practical, or social

Protocol CC-486-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 66 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 2015!A procedure that is planned (i.e., planned prior to starting of treatment on study); 
must be documented in the source document and the CRF.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_205271] d hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] a complication remains a reportable SAE.
!An elective treatment of or an elective pr ocedure for a pre-existing condition 
unrelated to the studied indication, that has not worsened from baseline. 
!Emergency outpatient treatment or observation that does not result in admission, 
unless fulfilling other seriousness criteria above.
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE page/screen of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.
For each SAE, the Investigator will provide information on severity, start and stop dates, 
relationship to IP, action taken regarding IP, and outcome.
11.2.2. Severity / Intensity
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator must assess the severity / intensity of the event. 
The severity / intensity of AEs will be gra ded based upon the subject’s symptoms according to 
the current active minor version of the Commo n Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE, Version 4.0); 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm#ctc_40
Adverse events that are not defined in the CTCAE should be evaluated for severity / intensity 
according to the following scale:
!Grade 1 = Mild – transient or mild discomfort; no limitation in activity; no medical 
intervention/therapy required
!Grade 2 = Moderate – mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be 
needed; no or minimal medical intervention/therapy required
!Grade 3 = Severe – marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; 
medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27594]
!Grade 4 = Life threatening – extreme limitati on in activity, signi ficant assistance 
required; significant medical intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27595]
!Grade 5 = Death - the event results in death
11.2.3. Causality 
The Investigator must determine the relationship between the administration of IP and the 
occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined below:
Not suspected: a causal relationship of the adverse event to IP administration is 
unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event.rm m

Confidential and Propri etary 67 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 2015Suspected: there is a reasonable possibility that the administration of IP 
caused the adverse event.  ‘Reasonable possibility’ means there 
is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the IP and 
the adverse event.
Causality s hould be a ssessed and provided for every AE/SAE based on currently available 
information.  Causality is to be reassessed and provided as additional information becomes 
available.
If an event is assessed as suspected of being related to a comparator, ancillary or additional IP 
that has not been manufactured or provided by [CONTACT_27718], please provide the name [CONTACT_208924].
11.2.4. Duration
For both AEs and SAEs, the Investigator will provide a record of the start and stop dates of the 
event.
11.2.5. Action Taken
The Investigator will report the action taken with IP as a result of an AE or SAE, as applicable 
(eg, discontinuation, interruption, or reduction of  IP, as appropriate) and report if concomitant 
and/or additional treatments were given for the event. 
11.2.6. Outcome
The Investigator will report the outcome of the event for both AEs and SAEs.
All SAEs that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until recovered (returned to baseline), recovered with sequelae, or death (due to the SAE). 
11.3. Abnormal Laboratory Values
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the abnormality:
!results in discontinuation from the st udy;
!requires treatment, modification/ interruption of IP dose, or any other therapeutic 
intervention; or
!is judged to be of significant clinical importance, eg, one that indicates a new disease 
process and/or organ toxicity, or is an exacerbation or worsening of an existing condition.
Regardless of severity grade, only laboratory abnormalities that fulfill a seriousness criterion 
need to be documented as a serious adverse event.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  If the abnormality was not a 
part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the labor atory abnormality should be recorded as the AE. If &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21IP P

abnormal laboratory result (eg, record thro mbocytopenia rather than decreased platelets).
11.4. Pregnancy
All pregnancies, suspected pregnancies and lactation occurring in  either a female subject of 
childbearing potential or partner of a male subject are immediately reportable events.
11.4.1. Females of Childbearing Potential
Pregnancies, suspected pregnancies (including elevated β-hCG or a positive pregnancy test in a 
female of childbearing potential regardless of age or disease state) and lactation of a female 
subject that occur during the trial or within 120 days of completing the trial (or longer if required 
by [CONTACT_5277]), or [ADDRESS_1024368] 
notify Celgene Drug Safety imm ediately about the outcome of the pregnancy (either normal or 
abnormal outcome) using the Pregnancy Follow- up Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
The female subject should be referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist, preferably one 
experienced in reproductive toxicity fo r further evaluation and counseling.
If the outcome of the pregnancy was abnormal (eg, spontaneous abortion), the Investigator 
should report the abnormal outcome as an AE.  If the abnormal outcome meets any of the serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE to Ce lgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event using the SAE Report 
Form, or approved equivalent form.
All neonatal d eaths that occur within [ADDRESS_1024369] to 
causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant d eath after 30 days that the Investigator suspects is 
related to the in utero exposure to the IP should also be reported to Celgene Drug Safety by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropri ate method, within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the 
event using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form.
11.4.2. Male Subjects
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant while the 
subject is receiving investigational product or within [ADDRESS_1024370] dose of IP (or longer if required by [CONTACT_5277]). The ICF will address any country-

Protocol CC-486-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 69 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 201511.5. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events
Any AE that meets any criterion for an SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report Form in 
addition to being recorded on the AE page/screen of the CRF.  Any serious adverse event, or 
follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any cause other than progression of 
the cancer under study that occurs to any subject from the time the consent is signed through [ADDRESS_1024372] 
initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, whether or not related to the Sponsor's 
product  must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, 
or approved equivalent form.  This instruction pe rtains to initial SAE reports as well as any 
follow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  
This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardle ss of relationship to study drugs) that occur during 
the study (from the time the subject signs informed  consent until [ADDRESS_1024373] dose of 
either IP) or any SAE made known to the Investig ator at anytime thereafter that are suspected of 
being related to IP.  SAEs occurring prior to treatment (after signing the ICF) will be captured.
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE and include a concise summary
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_27598].  If a subject died and an autopsy has been 
performed, copi[INVESTIGATOR_27599] d eath certificate are to be sent to Celgene Drug 
Safety as soon as these become available.  Any follow-up data should be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form, and sent to Celgene Drug Safety.  
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB/Ethics 
Committee (EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant init ial and follow-up 
information about the event. The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_748972]/EC.
11.5.1. Safety Queries
Queries pertaining to SAEs will be communicated from Celgene Drug Safety to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail.  The response time is expected to be no more than five (5) business days.  Urgent queries (eg, missing causality assessment) may be handled by [CONTACT_648].
11.6. Expedited Reporting of Adverse Events
For the purpose of regulatory reporting, Celgene Drug Safety will determine the expectedness of events suspected of being related to CC-486 based on the Investigator Brochure.
In the [LOCATION_002], all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) will be 
reported in an expedited manner in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32.
For countries within the European Economic Area (EEA), Celgene or its authorized 
representative will report in an expedited manner to Regulatory Authorities and Ethics 
Committees concerned, suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) in accordance 
with Directive 2001/20/EC and the Detailed Guidance on collection, verification and presentation of adverse reaction reports arising from clinical trials on investigational products for 
human use (ENTR/CT3) and also in accordance with country-specific requirements.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21orm, m,

Events of  disease progression for the disease under study (including deaths due to disease 
progression for indications that are considered to be fatal) will be assessed as expected adverse 
events and will not be reported as expedited safety reports to regulatory authorities.
Celgene or its authorized representative sh all notify the Investigator of the following 
information:
!Any AE suspected of being related to the use of IP in this study or in other studies 
that is both serious and unexpected (i.e., S[LOCATION_003]R);
!Any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for 
human subjects including reports of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
Where required by [CONTACT_19666], the Investigator shall notify his/her IRB/EC promptly of 
these new serious and unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects.
The Investigator must keep copi[INVESTIGATOR_748973]/EC.  (See Section 15.[ADDRESS_1024375] retention 
information).

Form Completion Guidelines or to the Pregnancy Report Form Completion Guidelines.
11.7. Pembrolizumab Events of Clinical Interest
Selected adverse events are also known as Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) and must be recorded 
as such on the Adverse Event CRFs and reported within 5 days of the Investigator’s knowledge 
of the event, regardless of whether or not the Investigator considers the event related to the IP. Ifthe event meets serious criteria (SAE), the event must also reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
within [ADDRESS_1024376] for this trial include, but are not limited to :
1. an overdose of pembrolizumab, as defined in Section 8.2.2 - Overdose, that is not 
associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. See Section 11.1 for a 
description of how overdoses of pembrolizumab are to be documented (with or without 
associated adverse events).
2. an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of 
normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper 
limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X 
the upper limit of normal, as determined by [CONTACT_453115]-specified laboratory testing or

of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an 
additional evaluation for an underlying etiology.  
There are additional ECIs identified in the Appendix C guidance document which also need to be 
reported to the Sponsor within 5 days of the Inve stigator’s knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_749014], regardless of whether or not the Investigator considers the event 
related to the IP, and if deemed serious (SAE), also reported to Celgene Drug Safety within [ADDRESS_1024377] additional 
testing to rule out other etiologic causes.  If lab results or symptoms indicated a possible immune-related ECI then additional testing s hould be performed to rule out other etiologic 
causes.  If no other cause was found, then it is assumed to be immune-related.
In addition, any pembrolizumab ECIs that become known to the investigator >30 days to ≤[ADDRESS_1024378] be reported to the sponsor within 5 days of the Investigator’s knowledge 
of the event by [CONTACT_749015]. If the event is deemed serious (SAE), it

13.2. Emergency Identification of Investigational Products
The blind must not be broken during the course of the study unless in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], it is absolutely necessary to safely treat the subject. IF it is medically imperative to 
know what IP the subject is receiving, IP should be  temporarily discontinued if, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15960], continuing IP can negatively affect the outcome of the subject’s treatment.
The decision to break the blind in emergency situations remains the responsibility of the treating 
physician, which will not be delayed or refused by [CONTACT_1034]. However, the Investigator may contact [CONTACT_81695], mainly in the 
interest of the subject.
The Investigator should ensure that the code is broken only in accordance with the protocol.  The 
Investigator should promptly notify the Medical Monitor of the emergency unblinding and the 
reason for breaking the blind, which should be c learly documented by [CONTACT_292054]’s source documentation.
Emergency unblinding should only be performed by [CONTACT_292055] (PIN), and the Investigator should call IRT 
for unblended dose information.

IRB/EC prior to commencement. The Investigator w ill conduct all aspects of this study in 
accordance with applicable national, state, and local laws of the pertinent regulatory authorities.
14.2. Investigator Responsibilities
Investigator responsibilities are set out in the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and in the local regulations.  Celgene staff or an authorized representative will evaluate and approve all Investigators who in turn will select their staff.
The Investigator should ensure that all persons assi sting with the study ar e adequately informed 
about the protocol, amendments, study treatments, as well as study-related duties and functions, including obligations of confidentiality of Celgene information. The Investigator should maintain 
a list of Sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified persons to whom he or she has 
delegated significant study-related duties.
The Investigator is responsible for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a record of all subjects who sign an informed consent 
document and are screened for entry into the study.  Subjects who fail screening must have the 
reason(s) recorded in the subject’s source documents.
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available during 
monitoring visits to review data, resolve queries and allow direct access to subject records (eg, 
medical records, office charts, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332], and study-related charts) for source data verification.  The Investigator must ensure timely and accurate completion of CRFs and queries.
The information contained in the protocol and amendments (with the exception of the 
information provided by [CONTACT_184689]) is considered Celgene confidential 
information.  Only information that is previously disclosed by [CONTACT_184690] a public registry 
website may be freely disclosed by [CONTACT_184691], or as outlined in the Clinical 
Trial Agreement.  Celgene protocol, amendment and IB information is not to be made publicly 
available (for example on the Investigator’s or their institution’s website) without express written 
approval from Celgene.  Information proposed  for posting on the Investigator’s or their 
institution’s website must be submitted to Celgene for review and approval, providing at least [ADDRESS_1024382] and/or their caregiver as agreed by [CONTACT_1560].

in the Investigator’s study files and a copy given to  the study subject.  In addition, if a protocol is 
amended and it impacts on the content of the informed consent, the ICF must be revised.  Study 
subjects participating in the study when th e amended protocol is implemented must be re-
consented with the revised version of the ICF.  The revised ICF signed and dated by [CONTACT_292058] s ubject must be maintained  in the Investigator’s 
study files and a copy given to the study subject.
14.4. Confidentiality
Celgene affirms the subject's right to protection against invasion of privacy and to be in 
compliance with ICH and other local regulations (whichever is most stringent). Celgene requires 
the Investigator to permit Celgene's representatives and, when necessary, representatives from 
regulatory authorities, to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in 
accordance with local laws.
Should direct access to medical records require  a waiver or authorization separate from the 
subject’s signed ICF, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate i ndividual.
14.5. Protocol Amendments
Any amendment to this protocol must be approved by [CONTACT_184693]/Medical Monitor.  Amendments will be submitted to the IRB/EC for written approval.  
Written approval must be obtained before implementation of the amended version occurs.  The 
written signed approval from the IRB/EC should specifically reference the Investigator name, protocol number, study title and amendment number(s) that is applicable. Amendments that are 
administrative in nature do not require IRB/IEC approval but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC 
for information purposes.
14.6. Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Review 
and Approval
Before the start of the study, the study protoc ol, ICF, and any other appropriate documents will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC with a cover letter or a form listing the documents submitted, their 
dates of issue, and the site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable) for which approval is sought. If applicable, the documents will also be submitted to the authorities in accordance with 
local legal requirements.

members of the IRB/EC and their occupation and qualifications. If the IRB/EC will not disclose 
the names, occupations and qualifications of the committee members, it should be asked to issue 
a statement confirming that the composition of the committee is in accordance with GCP. For example, the IRB General Assurance Number may be accepted as a substitute for this list. 
Formal approval by [CONTACT_1201]/EC should mention the protocol title, number, amendment number 
(if applicable), study site (or region or area of jurisdiction, as applicable), and any other 
documents reviewed. It must mention the date on which the decision was made and must be 
officially signed by a commi ttee memb er. Before the first subject is enrolled in the study, all 
ethical and legal requirements must be met.
The IRB/EC and, if applicable, the authorities, must be informed of all subsequent protocol 
amendments in accordance with local legal requirements. Amendments must be evaluated to 
determine whether formal approval must be sought and whether the ICF should also be revised.
The Investigator must keep a record of all comm unication with the IRB/EC  and, if applicable, 
between a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_72616] /EC. This statement also applies to any 
communicatio n between the Investigator (or Coordinating Investigator, if applicable) and 
regulatory authorities.
Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed by [CONTACT_27734]/EC prior to use.
14.7. Ongoing Information for Institutional Review Board / Ethics 
Committee

16.1. Study Monitoring and Source Data Verification
Celgene ensures that appropriate monitoring procedures are performed before, during and after the study.  All aspects of the study are reviewed with the Investigator and the staff at a studyinitiation visit and/or at an Investigator meeting.  Prior to enrolling subjects into the study, a 
Celgene representative will review the protoc ol, CRFs, procedures for obtaining informed 
consent, record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and reporting of AEs/SAEs with the Investigator.  Monitoring will include on-site visits with the Investigat or and his/her staff as  well as any appropriate 
communications by [CONTACT_2319], email, fax, or telephone.  During monitoring visits, the facilities, 
investigational product storage area, CRFs, s ubject’s source documents, and all other study 
documentation w ill be inspected/reviewed by [CONTACT_27738].
Accuracy will be checked by [CONTACT_12939] a direct comparison of 
the entries made onto the CRFs against the appropriate source documentation.  Any resulting 
discrepancies will be reviewed with the Investigator and/or his/her staff.  Any necessary 
corrections will be made directly to the CRFs or via queries by [CONTACT_11219]/or his/her staff. Monitoring procedures require that informed consents, adherence to inclusion/exclusion 
criteria and documentation of SAEs and their proper recording be verified.  Additional 
monitoring activities may be outlined in a study-specific monitoring plan.
16.2. Audits and Inspections
In addition to the routine monitoring procedure s, a Good Clinical Practice Quality Assurance 
unit exists within Celgene.  Representatives of this unit will conduct audits of clinical research 
activities in accordance with Celgene SOPs  to evaluate compliance with Good Clinical Pract ice 
guidelines and regulations.
The Investigator is required to permit direct access to the facilities where the study took place, 
source documents, CRFs and applicable supporting records of study subject participation for 
audits and inspections by [CONTACT_1744]/IECs, re gulatory authorities (eg, FDA, EMA, H ealth Canada) and 
company authorized representatives.  The Investigator should make every effort to be available for the audits and/or inspections.  If the Inves tigator is contact[CONTACT_72652], he/she should contact [CONTACT_27740].

Confidential and Propri etary 84 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 201519. APPENDICES
19.1. Appendix A: RECIST 1.1
The following information is extracted/summarized from Eisenhauer, 2009 , New response
evaluation criteria in solid tumors:  Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). Please refer to the 
primary reference for further information.
19.1.1. Definitions
At screening, tumor lesions/lymph nodes will be categorized as measurable or non-measurable.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Measurable Disease
Tumor Lesions: Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the 
plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
![ADDRESS_1024392] scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
!10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_461] (lesions which cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non-measurable)
![ADDRESS_1024393] X-ray
Malignant Lymph Nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be ≥ [ADDRESS_1024394] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed.
19.1.2. Tumor Response Evaluation19.1.2.1. Target Lesions
When more than one measurable tumor lesion is present at baseline all lesions up to a maximum 
of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of 2 lesions per organ) representative of all involved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will  be recorded and measured at baseline. Target
lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, but in addi tion should be those that lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements. Note that  pathological nodes must meet the measurable 
criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_1024395] scan and only the short axis of these nodes will 
contribute to the baseline sum. All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥ 10 mm but 
< 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions. Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are 
considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. At baseline, the sum of the 
target lesions (longest diameter of tumor lesions plus short axis of lymph nodes:  overall 
maximum of 5) is to be recorded.
After baseline, a value should be provided on the CRF for all identified target lesions for each 
assessment, even if very small. If extremely small and faint lesions cannot be accurately 
measured but are deemed to be present, a default value of 5 mm may be used. If lesions are too 
small to measure and indeed are believed to be absent, a default value of 0 mm may be used.&(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21asurabsurab le.le.

Protocol CC-486-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 85 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 201519.1.2.2. Non-target Lesions
All non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any measurable lesions over and above 
those listed as target lesions are considered non-target lesions. Measurements are not required 
but these lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed as “present,” “absent,” or “unequivocal progression.”
[IP_ADDRESS]. Response Criteria
Target and non-target lesions are evaluated for re sponse separately, and then the tumor burden as 
a whole is evaluated as the overall response.
[IP_ADDRESS].1. Target Lesion Response
Target lesions will be assessed as follows:
!Complete Response (CR).  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological 
lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
!Partial Response (PR).  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
!Progressive Disease (PD).  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum 
must also demonstrate an absolute increas e of at least 5 mm. (Note:  the appearance 
of one or more new lesions is  also considered progression).
!Stable Disease (SD).  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on 
study.
[IP_ADDRESS].2. Non-target Lesion Response
Non-target lesions will be assessed as follows:
!Complete Response (CR).  Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalisation 
of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
!Non-CR/Non-PD.  Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or 
maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits.
!Progressive Disease (PD).  Unequivocal progression (see comments below) of 
existing non-target lesions. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
When the Subject Also Has Measurable Disease:   In this setting, to achieve “unequivocal 
progression” on the basis of the non-target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial 
worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the 
overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy. A modest “increase” in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to quality for &(/*(1([ZIP_CODE],(7$5<,1)250$7,21as as

Confidential and Propri etary 86 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: [ADDRESS_1024396] Has Only Non-measurable Disease:   This circumstance arises in some 
Phase [ADDRESS_1024397] measurable disease. The same 
general concepts apply here as noted above; however, in this instance there is no measurable 
disease assessment to factor into the interpretation of an increase in non-measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non-target disease cannot be easily quantified (by [CONTACT_108]:  if all 
lesions are truly non-measurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subjects for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease: ie, an increase in tumor burden representing an 
additional 73% increase in “volume” (which is  equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a 
measurable lesion). Examples include an increase in  a pleural effusion from “trace” to “large,” 
an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as “sufficient to require a change in therapy.” If “unequivocal progression” is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD at that point. While it would be ideal to 
have objective criteria to apply to non-measurable disease, the very nature of that disease makes 
it impossible to do so: therefore, the increase must be substantial.
[IP_ADDRESS].3. Overall Response
Overall response should be assessed according to Table 8 for subjects with target lesions, and
Table 9 for subjects with only non-target lesions.

a“Non-CR/non-PD” is preferred over “stable disease” for non-target disease since SD is increasingly used as 
endpoint for assessment of efficacy in some trials so to assign this category when no lesions can be measured is 
not advised.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Symptomatic Deterioration
Subjects with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as ‘symptomatic deterioration’. Every effort should be made to document objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment. Symptom atic deterioration is not a descriptor of an 
objective response: it is a reason for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_12003]. The objective response status of such subjects is to be determined by [CONTACT_12157]-target disease.

Confidential and Propri etary 98 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 201519.3. Appendix C: Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) Guidance Document
19.3.1. Overview
The purpose of this appendix is to provide st udy sites with guidance on the identif ication and 
management of ECIs associated with pembrolizumab.
Based on the literature review, and considerat ion of mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, 
potential immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are the primary Event of ECI. Immune-related 
AEs are adverse events associated with the treatment of patients with immunotherapy treatments that appear to be associated with the immune therapy’s mechanism of action. Based on these 
potential irAEs, the Sponsor has defined a lis t of specific adverse event terms (ECIs) that are 
selected adverse experiences that must be reported to Sponsor within 5 days from the time the 
Investigator/physician is aware of such an occurrence, regardless of whether or not the 
Investigator/physician considers the event to be  related to IP. ECIs may be identified through 
spontaneous patient report and/or upon review of subject data. Table [ADDRESS_1024398] is not comprehensive for all potential 
immune-related events, it is possible that AEs othe r than those listed in this document may be 
observed in patients receiving pembrolizumab. Therefore any Grade 3 or higher event that the 
Investigator/physician considers to be immune-related should be reported as an ECI regardless of 
whether the specific event term is in Table 11 and reported to Sponsor within 5 days from the 
time the Investigator/physician is aware of such an occurrence. Adverse events that are both an 
SAE and an ECI should be reported on both the eCRF and also reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
within 24 hours by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form as outlined in Section 11.5.

Protocol CC-486-NSCL-001 Celgene Corporation
Confidential and Propri etary 100 CC-486-NSCL-001 Final: 15 May 2015Each of the events above is described within this guidance document, along with site 
requirements for reporting these events to th e Sponsor.  In addition, the guidelines include 
recommendations on the management of these ECIs. These guidelines are intended to be applied 
when the Investigator determines the events to be related to pembrolizumab. Note: if after the 
evaluation the event is determined not to be related, the Investigator is instructed to follow the 
ECI reporting guidance but does not need to follow the treatment guidance (below). Therefore, 
these recommendations should be seen as guidelines and the treating physician should exercise individual clinical judgment based on the patient.  For any question of dose modification or other 
treatment options, the specific language in the protocol should be followed.  Any questions 
pertaining to the collection of this information or management of ECIs s hould be directed to your 
local Sponsor contact. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Dose Modification/Discontinuation
The treatment guidance provides specific direction when to hold and/or discontinue 
pembrolizumab for each immune-related adverse event.   Of note, when the guidance states to 
“discontinue” pembrolizumab this is the permanent discontinuation of treatment with 
pembrolizumab. “Hold” means to stop treating with  pembrolizumab but resumption of treatment 
may be considered assuming the patient m eets the criteria for resumption of treatment.
19.3.2. ECI Reporting Guidelines
Events of clinical interest are selected non-serious and serious adverse experiences that must be 
reported to Sponsor within 5 days for NON-SERIOUS events
regardless of attribution to study 
treatment.  The AEs listed in this document and any event that meets the ECI criteria (as noted) in Table 11 or in the respective protocol (event term and Grade) must be reported regardless of 
physician-determined causality with IP and whether or not considered immune-related by [CONTACT_24201] (unless otherwise specified).   Physicians/study  coordinators/designated site personnel 
are required to record these experiences as ECIs on the Adverse Event CRF and to provide 
supplemental information (such as medical history, concomitant medications, investigations, 
etc.) about the event.  
NOTE:  Any event that meets the criteria for SERIOUS adverse event (SAE), must be 
reported to the Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate 
method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form as outlined in Section 11.5.
!Please refer to the CRF Completion Guidelines.

!Interstitial lung disease
!Acute interstitial pneumonitis 
If symptoms indicate possible new or worsening cardiac abnormalities additional testing and/or a 
cardiology consultation s hould be considered. 
All attempts should be made to rule out other cau ses such as metastatic disease, bacterial or viral 
infection.  It is important that patients with a suspected diagnosis of pneumonitis be 
managed as per the guidance below until treatment-related pneumonitis is excluded.  
Treatment of both a potential infectious etiology and pneumonitis in parallel may be warranted.  Management of the treatment of suspected pneumonitis with steroid treatment should not be delayed for a therapeutic trial of antibiotics.   If an alternative diagnosis is 
established, the patient does not require management as below; however the AE should be reported regardless of etiology.
NOTE:  Any event that meets the criteria for SERIOUS adverse event (SAE), must be reported 
to the Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form as outlined in Section 11.5.

additional anti-inflammatory measures upon symptom relief and initiate a prolonged 
steroid taper over 45 to 60 days. If symptoms worsen during steroid reduction, initiate a retapering of steroids starting at a higher dose of 80 or 100 mg followed by a more 
prolonge d taper and administer additional anti-inflammatory measures, as needed.
!Add prophylactic antibiotics for opportunistic infections.
NOTE:  Any event that meets the criteria for SERIOUS adverse event (SAE), must be reported 
to the Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form as outlined in Section 11.5.
[IP_ADDRESS]. Diarrhea/Colitis
The following AE terms, if considered ≥ Grade 2 or resulting in dose modification or use of 
systemic steroids to treat the AE, are considered ECIs and should be reported to the Sponsor on

(DKA) 
!Grade 3 or higher hyperglycemia, if associated with ketosis (ketonuria) or metabo lic 
acidosis (DKA).
Immune-mediated diabetes may present as new ons et of type 1 diabetes or an abrupt worsening 
of pre-existing diabetes associated with laboratorial evidence of beta cell failure. All attempts 
should be made to rule out other causes such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), T2DM decompensation, steroid-induced diabetes, physiologic stress-induced diabetes, or poorly 
controlled pre-existing diabetes (either T1DM or T2DM), but events meeting the above criteria 
should be reported as ECIs regardless of etiolo gy. The patients may present with hyperglycemia 
(abrupt onset or abrupt decompensation) with  clinical evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis or 
laboratory evidence of insulin deficiency, such as ketonuria, laboratory evidence of metabolic 
acidosis, or low or undetected c-peptide.
Course of ActionT1DM should be immediately treated with insulin.
Type 1 diabetes mellitus or Grade 3-4 hyperglycemia events:
!Report as ECI if appropriate (see Table 11 )
!Hold pembrolizumab for new onset type 1 diabetes mellitus or Grade 3-4 
hyperglycemia associated with evidence of beta cell failure, and resume 
pembrolizumab when patients are clinically and metabolically stable.

as possible. 
!Take digital photographs of: 
othe head (to assess mucosal or eye involvement), 
othe trunk and extremities, and 
oa close-up of the skin lesion/rash.
!If possible, a ruler should be placed alongside the site of a skin occurrence as a fixed 
marker of distance. 
!The time/date stamp should be set in the 'ON' position for documentation purposes. 
!Photographs should be stored with the subject’s study records. 
!The Sponsor may request copi[INVESTIGATOR_308612]. The local study contact (eg, clinical 
research associate [CRA]) will provide guidance to the site, if needed. 
B. Past Medical History:
Collect past medical history relevant to the even t. Any pre-existing conditions not previously 
reported (eg, drug allergy) s hould be entere d into the Medical History electronic case report form 
(eCRF). 
C. Vitals Signs and Standard Laboratory Tests:
Measure vital signs and record on the Vital Signs CRF.  Perform standard laboratory tests (CBC 
with differential and serum chemistry panel, including LFTs). 
D. Dermatology Consult
Refer the subject to a dermatologist as soon as possible. 
!For a “severe rash”, the subject must be seen within 1-2 days of reporting the event. 
!For clinically significant rash, the subject should be seen within 3-[ADDRESS_1024406] results.
NOTE:  Any event that meets the criteria for SERIOUS adverse event (SAE), must be reported 
to the Celgene Drug Safety within 24 hours by [CONTACT_6972], or other appropriate method, using the 
SAE Report Form, or approved equivalent form as outlined in Section 11.5.

!Any additional Grade 3 or higher event wh ich the physician considers to be immune 
related
All attempts should be made to rule out othe r causes.  Therapeutic specialists should be 
consulted as appropriate. However the AE should be reported regardless of etiology.
Course of Action
Grade 2 events or Grade 1 events that do not improve with symptomatic treatment:
!Withhold pembrolizumab.  
!Systemic corticosteroids may be indicated. 
!Consider biopsy for confirmation of diagnosis.
!If pembrolizumab held and corticosteroid required, manage as per Grade 3 below.
Grade 3 events:
!Hold pembrolizumab
!Treat with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent 
once per day.  
!When symptoms improve to Grade 1 or less, steroid taper should be started and 
continued over no less than 4 weeks.  
!Permanently discontinue for inability to redu ce corticosteroid dose to 10 mg or less of 
prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 weeks. Otherwise, pembrolizumab 
treatment may be restarted and the dose modified as specified in the protocol
Grade 4 events:
!Treat with systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg prednisone or equivalent 
once per day.  
!Discontinue pembrolizumab

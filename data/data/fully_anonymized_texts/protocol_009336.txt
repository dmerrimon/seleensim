Study Protocol 
The Barre stretching video sessions were available online, and students were instructed to 
complete each session in a quiet, comfortable setting. The trial aimed to create a relaxed session 
environment that minimally disrupted the student’s learning environment without affecting the 
study’s outcome. The Barre stretching intervention consisted of a 15-minute recorded video 
session with static and isometric movements focused on the hands, wrists, shoulders, and neck, 
combined with breathing exercises throughout each movement. A 15-minute Barre stretching 
video was selected to ensure each stretching movement could be held for 30-45 seconds, 
increasing blood flow and circulation, improving heart rate variability (HRV), enhancing muscle 
suppleness, and reducing stress levels through regulated breathing. Participants performed fifteen 
targeted stretching movements: five for the hands/wrists, five for the shoulders, and five for the 
neck region. 
 
Statistical Analysis Plan 
 
The data analysis was conducted using the Jamovi software program to perform 
descriptive statistics and paired sample t-tests for the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the 
Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS). The level of significance was established at p=0.05, 
allowing evaluation of the effectiveness of the Barre stretching intervention in reducing self-
reported stress and pain levels among first-year dental hygiene students.

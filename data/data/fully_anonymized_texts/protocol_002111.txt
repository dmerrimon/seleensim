Rationale:   Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be disproportionately 
affected by [CONTACT_10840]. The majority of HIV infections among MSM occur through exposure to 
the rectal mucosa during receptive anal intercourse (RAI). To aid in prevention, a new 
HIV prevention in tervention, called pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), recommends that 
MSM at risk of HIV infection take a daily anti -HIV medication called Truvada® 
(tenofovir/emtricitabine) which is shown to be highly effective. However, current 
tenofovir - based regimens ha ve shown to cause different side effects while taken.  To 
reduce these side effects, new formulations of anti -HIV agents are being developed, but 
the ability of these new agents to penetrate mucosal tissues and prevent HIV infection 
at sites of virus expos ure is unclear.    
 
Design:  To address the efficacy of the new formulated anti -HIV agents and their ability 
to penetrate the mucosal tissues in MSM, investigators at Emory University will 
collaborate with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC ) to conduct a 
randomized clinical trial of 90 MSM. Men will be randomized into a 2 -arm study (forty - 
five men assigned to each arm) as follows: (Arm 1) daily oral Truvanda® or (Arm 2) daily 
oral Genvoya®. Each study arm includes 3 phases: (1) pre -drug, (2 ) short -course, and 
(3) steady state. For phase I, there will be [ADDRESS_1024640] 20 men assigned to both arms. The study will entail 2 
study visits for phase I, 3 study visits for phase II, and 4 stu dy visits for phase III at the 
Emory University Hope Clinic. During phase I : visit 1, all men will be screened for 
eligibility and undergo written informed consent, physical examination, rapid HIV testing, 
phlebotomy for screening laboratories, and randomi zation. During study visit 2 (time 1 -6 
weeks after study visit 1), participant returns and a urethral swab, 2 pre - wet penile 
swabs, and a urine sample will be collected. Participant will then undergo a rectal 
biopsy via rigid sigmoidoscopy for establishme nt of baseline values. During  phase II : 
study visit 1, men will be screened for eligibility and undergo written informed consent, 
physical examination, rapid HIV testing, phlebotomy (will collect 4 tablespoons) for 
screening laboratories, and randomization . During study visit 2 (time 1 -6 weeks after 
study visit 1), men will be dispensed and instructed to take either one dose of Truvada® 
or Genvoya®. After 4 to 6 hours after dosing, a urethral swab, 2 pre - wet penile swabs, 4 
tablespoons of blood, and a urin e sample will be collected. During study visit 3 (time 24 
hours after drug dosing), men will return after [ADDRESS_1024641] use for repeat 
phlebotomy, urethral and penile swabs, collection of urine and rectal secretions, and 
rectal biopsy via rigid  sigmoidoscopy. For phase III : visit 1,

Version 6 04/21/17  4 
 men will be screened for eligibility and will undergo the informed consent process.  
Once informed consent is signed, a physical examination will be performed, rapid HIV 
testing, phlebotomy for screening labs, and  randomization will occur. During study visit 
2 (time 1 -6 weeks after study visit 1), men will be dispensed and instructed to take 
either Truvada® or Genvoya® for 10 days. After 3 to 5 consecutive days of dosing, 
participants will return for visit 3 where a urethral and penile swabs specimen, blood 
work, and a urine specimens will be obtained. During study visit 4 (time 10 days of 
consecutive drug dosing), men will return for repeat phlebotomy, urethral and penile 
swabs, collection of urine and rectal secre tions, and rectal biopsy.  After collection, 
biologic specimens will be immediately transported by [CONTACT_749267] (laboratory of 
Clyde Hart) for processing. Specimens will be processed immediately for ex vivo  
laboratory assays that will include Truvada® and/or Genvoya® drug concentrations, 
inflammatory cytokine levels, HIV target cell measurement and characterization by [CONTACT_8315], and in vitro  HIV infection assays. Comparison of assay results between the 2 
study arms will help in determining the ability of the new formulated anti -HIV drug to 
penetrate different body compartments at the site of possible HIV exposure.   
 Participants may particip ate in more than one phase; however, at least [ADDRESS_1024642] to repeat the 
screening visit (visit 1) whe n starting another phase; they will begin the new phase at 
visit 2.  
Duration: The duration of this study is 3 years. Participants will be considered ‘on -study’ 
for no more than 12 weeks.   
 
Sample size: For this protocol we will recruit 90 HIV -negative MSM or transgender 
women who are not taking hormone therapy who meet eligibility criteria outlined in the 
protocol.   
 
Population:  The population to be studied in this protocol is HIV negative MSM and 
transgender women who are not taking hormone therapy, who meet eligibility criteria, 
and are willing to perform study procedures. Participants will be recruited from existing 
databases at Hope Clinic and the Rollins School of Public Health who have agreed to 
be contact[CONTACT_7678], from community recruitment events conducted by [CONTACT_749268], and from internet and paper advertisements currently used routinely by [CONTACT_749269].  
 
LAY SUMMARY  
 
Men who have sex with men (MSM) and Transgender women (TGW) who have sex 
with men continue to be disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_10840]. Over 60% of new HIV 
infections in the US occur among MSM. The majority of HIV infections among MSM and

Version 6 04/21/17  5 
 TGW occur through exposure to the rectal mucosa during r eceptive anal intercourse 
(RAI).  Pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new HIV prevention method that is 
recommended by [CONTACT_703371].  PrEP entails taking 
an anti -HIV medication (Truvada®; tenofovir/emtricitabine) on a daily  basis to prevent 
HIV infection. However, current tenofovir - based regimens have shown to have side 
effects that researchers are hopi[INVESTIGATOR_749260] -HIV agents. This 
study is designed to examine the ability of these new agents to penet rate mucosal 
tissues and potentially prevent HIV infection during RAI exposure for MSM and TGW.   
 
For this protocol, we will recruit HIV -negative MSM and TGW who are not on hormone 
therapy aged [ADDRESS_1024643] visit for all phases ( phase I, phase II, and 
phase III)  will be a screening visit where eligibility is determined, written informed 
consent is obtained, screening tests are performed, and men will be randomized to one 
of two study groups: 1. Use of oral Truvada®; or 2. Use of oral Genvoya®. During the 
second s tudy visit (visit 2), men in phase I  will not receive product, but will come in for 
blood work, urine sample, [ADDRESS_1024644]  DESCRIPTION  
 
Public Health Relevance:  Information about new anti -HIV agents and how they 
penetrate through mucosal tissues will better inform scientists about the potential of new 
agents to be used for pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).  
 
Goal : To compare t he body compartment pharmacokinetics and mucosal inflammatory 
effects of Truvada® vs. Genvoya®.

Emory IRB00077593  
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_443754] F. Kelley, MD, MPH  
 
Version 6 04/21/[ADDRESS_1024645] approximately 20% of men will  
not complete all study visits, therefore the sample size of 90 men will likely result in 
study completion for 72 men.

RISKS AND HOW MINIMIZED  
 
HIV risk counseling  
 Participants that are tested for HIV to ensure eligibility will undergo HIV risk reduction 
counseling  (e.g. increasing condom use, reducing number of partners, addressing substance 
abuse, etc.)  by [CONTACT_9154] [INVESTIGATOR_749263].  HIV rapid testing will then be conducted with a CLIA 
waived product with finger -stick or whole blood from phlebotomy, depending on the test. Any 
participant who is found to be HIV positive on rapid testing will be referred for confirmatory 
testing to their local health department, AID Atlanta, or provider of their choice. We will also  
assist any HIV positive participant in accessing healthcare for HIV infection as needed. If a 
participant tests HIV positive prior to visit 2 or 3, they will be discontinued from the study and 
given the incentive for the contingency visit.  
 
Participants w ill also be educated about HIV pre -exposure prophylaxis during the study by [CONTACT_749281]/or study clinician. After completion of the study, all men who are interested in 
PrEP for HIV prevention will be linked to community services. A detailed listin g of PrEP services 
available for insured and uninsured clients in Atlanta can be found at www.preplocator.org . [CONTACT_749288] is active in PrEP implementation in the Atlanta community and can facilitate these 
linkages .    
 
Blood sample collection  
The most common risks of blood sample collection are pain at the puncture site, 
bruising, and a feeling of lightheadedness. To minimize these risks, blood draws will be 
performed by [CONTACT_21724], and will be performed in a secure environment with 
access to first aid equipment, bandages, and trained healthcare professionals.  
 
 
Risks of Truvada® for PrEP  
 
Truvada® is a combination pi[INVESTIGATOR_749264]. 
In clinical trials of PrEP for MSM, the drug was well tolerated6.  Nausea was more 
common among participants taking the medication than among those taking placebo 
(9% vs. 5%).  There were no differences in severe or life -threatening adverse laboratory 
events between the active and placebo group.  Adverse events associated with 
tenofovir can include a transient decrease in renal function and slight decreases in bone 
mineral density.  Both of these effects occur with prolonged use of the medication and 
are not expected to occur with the limited 7 -day dosing in this protocol.1  6 Nausea was 
more common among participants taking the medication than among those taking 
placebo (9% vs. 5%).  There were no differences in severe or life -threatening adverse 
laboratory events between the active and placebo group.  Adverse events associated 
with tenofovir can include a transient decrease in renal function and slight dec reases in 
bone mineral density.  Both of these effects occur with prolonged use of the medication 
and are not expected to occur with the limited [ADDRESS_1024666]: Truvada® vs. Genvoya®

Version 6 04/21/17  18 
 Risk of Genvoya® 
 
Genvoya® is a combination anti -HIV medication that contains the drugs tenofovir 
alafenamide, emtricitabine, elvitegravir, and cobicistat. Based on clinical trials previously 
conducted of Genvoya®, the drug showed to be well tolerated. According to participants, 
the most common side effect shown was nausea with diarrhea being the second most 
common side effect. Of those who reported this adverse event, 0.9% and 1.5 % 
discontinued treatment regardless of the severity.  Adverse events associated with 
Genvoya® can inclu de a transient decrease in renal function and slight decreases in 
bone mineral density. There is also a possibility of lactic acidosis, which can be hard to 
identify during early stages. These effects occur with prolonged use of the medication 
and are not expected to occur with the limited [ADDRESS_1024667] to Truvada®, there have been no clinical trials of Genvoya® for HIV pre -
exposure prophylaxis.  However, similar concerns wi th acquisition of HIV infection and 
development of HIV drug resistance as discussed above also apply to Genvoya®. 
 
Genvoya® can also cause flare -ups in those who have hepatitis B virus.  It can cause 
the Hepatitis B virus to suddenly return in a worse form  than before if treatment was 
provided. For this reason, it is important that participants not participate in the study if 
they are known to have Hepatitis B. Nonetheless, the maximum 10 day dosing regimen 
for this study is unlikely to cause flare -ups in H epatitis B even if not diagnosed.    
 
 
Acquisition of HIV drug resistance is a theoretic concern for those taking Truvada® or 
Genvoya® for PrEP.   However, clinical trials of Truvada® for PrEP have shown this to 
be a very rare event except in those who wer e ‘acutely’ infected with HIV at the time of 
study enrollment.  In the iPrex study, there was no drug resistant virus detected in 100 
MSM who became infected after enrollment.  Of the ten men who were identified 
retrospectively to be acutely infected with HIV at enrollment, drug resistance was 
detected in 2/2 of men in the active drug arm and 1/[ADDRESS_1024668] men for HIV at study entry and monitor clinically for high -risk 
behavior or any signs of acute HIV infection at study visits.  If high  risk behavior (e.g. 
unprotected anal intercourse with a man of unknown HIV status) or symptoms of acute 
HIV infection are reported, and HIV antibody test will be repeated and the participant will 
be counseled about the need for any follow -up testing.  Cli nical signs and symptoms of 
acute HIV infection that will be queried include: fever, fatigue, malaise, skin rash, 
swollen glands, oral/genital ulcers, myalgia/arthralgia1.  [CONTACT_26019] will review all reports 
of clinical signs/symptoms to determ ine appropriate follow -up and linkage to care as 
necessary.  If a diagnosis of acute HIV infection is thought to be possible or determined 
by [CONTACT_443794], the participant will be discontinued from the study.6.  For this 
protocol, we will test men fo r HIV at study entry and monitor clinically for high -risk 
behavior or any signs of acute HIV infection at study visits.  
 
Men will be asked to abstain from receptive anal intercourse while using drug during the 
study protocol in order to limit additional e xposures (e.g. semen, douching, additional

 lubricants) to the rectal mucosa. Men taking Truvada® or Genvoya® will be counseled 
that they should not expect to achieve protection from HIV infection by [CONTACT_749282], as they will be provided a  limited supply. All men included in the study 
that have an interest in taking PrEP for HIV prevention, will be referred to an area PrEP 
provider at the termination of the study. The Hope Clinic has compi[INVESTIGATOR_42602] a resource sheet 
of area providers that will be distributed to interested participants.   
  
Rigid sigmoidoscopy and biopsies  
Risks associated with lower gastrointestinal endoscopy include colitis from chemicals 
for endoscope sterilization, bowel perforation, bleeding, diverticulitis, and infection. All 
procedures will be performed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kelley or [CONTACT_749287] (FNP). Non -physician medical 
providers have performed endoscopic procedures for diagnostic and therapeutic 
procedures for years. Many of these require mastery of flexible sigmoidoscopes, 
detailed anat omy of the full colon, and familiarity with sedation procedures.[ADDRESS_1024669] performed >200 
simila r procedures for other IRB approved protocols with zero complications.   
 
All procedures will utilize disposable rigid sigmoidoscopes, forceps, and guides to 
reduce risk of infection and obviate the need for instrument sterilization between 
participants.  To minimize risks, rigid proctoscopy, rather than flexible sigmoidoscopy or 
full colonoscopy, will be used in this study and the number of biopsies taken will be 
limited to 12.  Colonoscopy has been shown to be associated with a still low, but 
significantl y greater risk of complications than rectosigmoidoscopy10.  The frequency of 
serious complications after flexible sigmoidoscopy is extremely low and complications 
from rigid sigmoidoscopy are presumably eve n lower, but unknown.  In two large 
studies10,11 including a combined 144,832 clinically indicated procedures, the incidence 
of serious complications ranged from 0.06 to 0.8% utilizing flexible sigmoidoscopy. 
Obtaining biopsies may be associated with an in creased risk of complications. The best 
available data on the risk of multiple biopsies comes from studies of dysplasia 
surveillance among patients with long -standing inflammatory bowel disease, in whom 
large numbers of “blind” biopsies are obtained throug hout the colon for early detection 
of malignant transformation. In two such studies12,13 including a combined 3,011 
procedures and a median of eight13 and 17 biopsies12, respectively, there was only one 
serious complication, for  an incidence of approximately 0.33%. More relevant to the 
present protocol, in a study of subjects undergoing endoscopic procedures exclusively 
for research purposes14, including 64 flexible sigmoidoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_749265] a mean of 25 
biopsies obtained from the rectosigmoid, there were no major complications. Thirteen 
subjects experienced minor symptoms (self -limited bleeding and pain), which were not 
related to the number of biopsies. Thus, the risk of serious compli cations from the 
proposed study procedures, even with up to [ADDRESS_1024670]: Truvada® vs. Genvoya®

 extremely low and complications from rigid sigmoidoscopy are presumably e ven lower, 
but unknown.  In two large studies including a combined 144,832 clinically indicated 
procedures, the incidence of serious complications ranged from 0.06 to 0.8% utilizing 
flexible sigmoidoscopy. Obtaining biopsies may be associated with an incre ased risk of 
complications. The best available data on the risk of multiple biopsies comes from 
studies of dysplasia surveillance among patients with long -standing inflammatory bowel 
disease, in whom large numbers of “blind” biopsies are obtained throughou t the colon 
for early detection of malignant transformation. In two such studies including a 
combined 3,011 procedures and a median of eight and 17 biopsies, respectively, there 
was only one serious complication, for an incidence of approximately 0.33%. Mo re 
relevant to the present protocol, in a study of subjects undergoing endoscopic 
procedures exclusively for research purposes, including 64 flexible sigmoidoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_101899] a mean of 25 biopsies obtained from the rectosigmoid, there were no major 
complicatio ns. Thirteen subjects experienced minor symptoms (self -limited bleeding and 
pain), which were not related to the number of biopsies. Thus, the risk of serious 
complications from the proposed study procedures, even with up to 12 biopsy 
specimens, is expecte d to be very low.  
 
There is theoretical risk of increased acquisition of HIV or other infection if a study 
participant is exposed soon after the rectal biopsy procedure (i.e. while the mucosal 
surface is damaged).  Therefore, study subjects will be counse led not to engage in anal 
intercourse for 1 week after the procedure.  
 
Biologic samples will be coded with a unique identifier prior to processing and storage 
for immunologic assays.  Therefore, lab personnel will be unable to link specimens with 
particip ants.  Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_413610] -investigators/study personnel will be able to 
access information to identify specimens of individual participants.   
 
 
 
BREECH OF CONFIDENTIALITY  
All measures will be taken to ensure information provided by [CONTACT_443796].  Identifying paper information will be kept in a separate locked office and 
only accessible by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_32528].  Electronic data will be stored on the 
Redcap server or the Emory School of Medicine HIPPAA compliant servers, which will 
be accessible to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_443765].  All study specimens will be labeled 
with a unique identifier prior to transport to CDC.  Identifying information wil l not be 
shared with laboratory collaborators at the CDC and they will be unable to link the study 
ID to any identifying information.  Any demographic data shared with CDC will also be 
stripped of HIPPAA identifiers prior to sharing.  In the event that con fidentiality is 
accidentally breached, the event will be reported to Emory IRB officials who are then 
required to report to the IRB director and/or the IRB Chair any instances of which they 
are aware that involve a use or disclosure of information in viola tion of the confidentiality 
obligations set forth in the Confidentiality and Non -Disclosure Agreement, HIPAA 
Regulations or HIPAA Privacy and/or Security Policies.  The IRB Director and IRB Chair

Version 6 04/21/[ADDRESS_1024674] PRIVACY AND DATA CONFIDENTIALITY  
 
All subjects will provide informed consent in a private room at  the Hope Clinic.  
 
Case report forms (CRFs) will be provided for each subject to collect demographic, 
behavioral, clinical, and laboratory data at study entry, and additional clinical data at the 
study visit. These data will be collected from the screening  clinical assessment, the 
study entry physical examination and screening laboratory tests, and rectal biopsy 
visits. Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_443799] (PID), which will 
be provided by [CONTACT_749283].  All laboratory specimens, 
evaluation forms, reports, and other records that leave the site will be identified by 
[CONTACT_191342]. All study samples will be kept in a 
secure area in a limited -access laboratory fac ility and only the research team will have 
access to the samples. The samples and data will be identified only by [CONTACT_63903].  
 
Any identifiable records will be kept locked accessible only by [CONTACT_443801]. Electronic data will be password pr otected and stored on the Redcap server 
or the Emory School of Medicine HIPPAA compliant server. Biologic samples will be 
coded with a unique identifier and no identifiable behavioral data will be shared with 
laboratory investigators at CDC.  Information a bout the subject’s participation will not be 
shared with individuals who are not directly involved with the research subjects.  Clinical 
information will not be released without written permission of the subject, except as 
necessary for monitoring by [CONTACT_1744], the FDA, the NIH, or the OHRP. Information about the 
subject’s participation will not be shared with individuals who are not directly involved 
with the research subjects or as identified in the HIPAA consent.  
 
PLANS FOR SUBJECTS AT THE END OF THE PROTOCOL  
Subjects will return to the standard of care at the end of the protocol.  Subjects who are 
interested in starting PrEP will be linked to care with a community provider.

Version 6 04/21/[ADDRESS_1024675] AVAILABITLITY  
The Emory University IRB, the OHRP, FDA, or other government regulatory authorities 
may perform clinical site monitoring.  Clinical research sites monitoring may include the 
review of the individual participant records, including consent forms, CRFs, supporting 
data, laboratory specime n records, and medical records (physicians’ progress notes, 
nurses’ notes, individuals’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1332]) to ensure protection of study participants, 
compliance with the protocol, and accuracy and completeness of records.  The monitors 
may also inspect site s’ regulatory files to ensure that regulatory requirements are being 
followed.  
 
The investigators will make study documents (e.g., consent forms, CRFs) and pertinent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443766].  
 
ADVERSE EVENT MONITORING AND REPORTING  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be reported on an expedited basis at the standard level 
during the protocol -defined expedited adverse event (EAE) Reporting Period, which is 
the entire study duration for an individual subject (from study enrollment until study 
completion or discontinuation of the subject from study participation for any reason).  
AE Reporting  
 
Any AE that is reported to either the investigators or their designated research 
associates by a study subject or by [CONTACT_749284].   
 
In addition, clinical investigators will monitor s ubjects for Serious adverse events (SAE) 
Unanticipated problems (UP) during each study visit. Any SAE that is judge related to 
study product or UP will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1024676] 
Emory IRB reporting guidelines for AE a nd SAE reporting, as documented at 
http://www.emory.edu/IRB/guidelines_adverse_event.php , will be followed.   
 
 
A SAE is an adverse drug experience that results in any of the following o utcomes:  
1. Death.  
2. Life-threatening situation - The subject was at risk of death at the time of the 
adverse event/experience.  It does not refer to the hypothetical risk of death if the 
AE were more severe or were to progress.  
3. Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_198297].  
4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity - Any AE having an outcome that is 
associated with a substantial disruption of the ability to carry out normal life

 functions, including the ability to work.  This is no t intended to include transient 
interruption of daily activities.  
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defects - Any structural abnormality in subject’s 
offspring that occurs after intrauterine exposure to treatment.  
6. Important medical events/experiences that may not r esult in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a serious adverse 
event/experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may 
jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above, i.e., death, a life -threatening adverse 
event/experience, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6929], a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  Exa mples of such medical events/experiences include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
7. Spontaneous and elective abortions will be reported to the Emory IRB as serious 
adverse events.  
 
8.  Severity of AEs will be rated according to the following definitions:  
 
Mild: The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated 
by [CONTACT_70579] t. 
Moderate : The adverse event causes the subject discomfort 
and interrupts the subject’s normal activities.  
Severe : The adverse event causes considerable 
interference with the subject’s normal activities and 
may be incapacitating or life -threatening.  
 
The following definitions will be used to assess the relationship of the AE to study drugs 
or procedures:  
 
 
 
Probably Related : An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study drug or 
recurs on re -challenge, and another etiology is unlikely or significantly 
less likely.

Emory IRB00077593  
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: [INVESTIGATOR_443754] F. Kelley, MD, MPH  
 
Version 6 04/21/17  25 
 Possibly Related : An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the study 
drug, and an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to 
the potential relationship to study drug.  
Probably Not 
Related : An adver se event has little or no temporal relationship to the study 
drug and/or a more likely alternative etiology exists.  
Not Related : An adverse event is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or 
effect of another drug and is not related to the study drug (e.g., has no 
temporal relationship to study drug or has much more likely alternative 
etiology).  
 
If the adverse event is in, the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], possibly or probably related, or not 
related to study drug or procedures, then an alternate etiology will be provided by [CONTACT_1275].  
It should however be noted that a severe adverse event /experience is not necessarily 
serious, as the term severe is a measure of intensity while a serious adverse event 
(SAE) is determined based on the aforementioned regulatory criteria.  
All AEs and laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the Division of AIDS 
Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events (DAIDS AE 
Grading Table), Version 1.0, December 2004, which can be found on the DAIDS RCC 
Web site: http://rcc.tech -res.com/tox_tables.htm .   
DATA SAFETY MONITORING  
Summaries of adverse events (Grades 3 or 4), and targeted AEs across study groups 
as well as study conduct will be reviewed regularly (in real time and summarized 
quarterly) by [CONTACT_2792]. Any SAE that is judge related to study product or UP 
will be reported to the IRB within [ADDRESS_1024677] Emory IRB 
reporting guidelines for AE and SAE reporting, as documented at 
http://www.emory.edu/IRB/guidelines_adverse_eve nt.php , will be followed.   
http://www.emory.edu/IRB/guidelines_adverse_event.php , will be followed.    
Additional safety monitoring will be performed annually by [CONTACT_443802].  Based on the [ADDRESS_1024678]. The safety report will 
summarize AEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_2060].  The DCC will work w ith the Medical Safety 
Monitor to complete a ‘final assessment’ following the review of each safety report.  As 
part of the final assessment the Medical Safety Monitor will conclude ‘the study can 
continue as no safety concerns have been identified at the time of the review’ or ‘the

A study participant may elect to discontinue participation in the study at any time.  The 
study may be discontinued at any time by [CONTACT_1201], the OHRP, or other government 
agencies as part of their duties to ensure that research subjects are protected . 
BIOHAZARD CONTAINMENT  
Blood -borne pathogens can occur through contact [CONTACT_83176], blood,

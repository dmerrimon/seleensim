PURPOSE OF STUDY 
The purpose of this clinical study is to determine the effectiveness of the Erchonia Violet 
ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  (manufactured by [CONTACT_259272] (the Company) , an over -the-
counter (OTC) laser device, in providing noninvasive body circumference reduction.  
 
STUDY DURATION 
The estimated total duration of the study is 2 weeks.  
 
INDICATION FOR USE 
The indication (claim) being sought through support of the results of t his clinical study is:  
 
“The Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  is indicated for use as a non- invasive dermatological 
aesthetic treatment for the reduction of body circumference.”  
 
The Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC is intended for Over -the-Counter (OTC) use.  
 
The indication for use and intended use of the Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  is identical 
to the predicate device,  the Erchonia ZERONA ® Z6 OTC , as FDA cleared under  K162578:  
 
“The Erchonia ZERONA  Z6 OTC  is indicated for  use as a  non-invasive dermatological 
aesthetic treatment for the reduction of body circumference.”  
 
It is cleared for Over -the-Counter (OTC) use.  
 It is intended that the results of this clinical study be used to support a 510(k) submissi on to 
seek FDA clearance to market the Erchonia Violet Z ERONA ® Z6 OTC  for the same  indication  
for use as that cleared for the predicate device, the Erchonia ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  (K162578 ), 
by [CONTACT_719225] ® Z6 OTC  is 
non-inferior to the efficacy of application of the Erchonia ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  (K162578) for 
the reduction of body circumference of the waist, hips, and bilateral thighs when applied in the 
over-the-counter setting. 
 
EXPECTED RESULTS 
Following completion of the study treatment administration protocol , it is anticipated that 
compared with the Erchonia ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  red diode laser,  application of treatment 
administration with the Erchoni a Violet Z ERONA ® Z6 OTC will yield non-inferior (equivalent  
or superior) results with respect to mean decrease in subjects’ combined waist -hips-bilateral 
thighs circumference measurements  relative to baseline.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Erchonia Corporation Violet ZERONA®  Z6 OTC  Efficacy Study  Protocol  
 
Version  1.[ADDRESS_981412] to  seek clearance for the Erchonia Violet ZERONA® Z6 OTC  
for the intended indication is through a 510(k) submission with supportive clinical data from the 
outcome of this clinical study protocol.  
 
The intended predicate device is the Erchonia ZERONA ® Z6 OTC , previously FDA cleared 
under K162578.  
 The Erchonia Z ERONA ® Z6  OTC  is currently FDA cleared under K162578 for use as a non -
invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment for the reduction of body circumference. It is cleared for Over -the-Counter (OTC) us e.  
 Preceding its clearance under K162578, the Erchonia Zerona® Z6 OTC received FDA 
clearance under  K143007 for use as a non -invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment for the 
reduction of circumference of hips, waist, and thighs.  K143007 was supported by [CONTACT_109972] a 
Human Factors Validation and Testing Study that evaluated the lay user’s ability to operate the 
device safely , correctly , and effectively  per the instructions in the User’s Manual . In that study, 
22 lay user subjects administered the treatment with the Zerona® Z6  OTC to 22 client subjects. 
The outcome of that study demonstrated that the lay user s successfully understood the 
information in the User’s Manual and were  able to follow the instructions to operate the device 
and administer treatments safely, correctly, and effectively. All treated subjects in that study 
received an active course of [ADDRESS_981413], hips and bilateral thighs for those subjects was 
-3.7 inches, a statistically significant finding of equivalency  to the precedent prospective 
randomized controlled trial ( RCT) evaluating efficacy of the Erchonia  ZERONA® for noninvasive 
circumference reduction of the waist, hips, and bilateral thighs . In that prior study, 67 males and 
females aged 18 to 65 years received the identical treatment protocol of 6 treatments with the 
Zerona® equally spaced across [ADDRESS_981414], hips , and bilateral thighs. The 35 subjects 
who received the active laser treatment attained an average total circumference reduction of 3.5 
inches compared with a mean decrease of 0.68 inches for the 32 subjects who received  the 
sham treatment.  
 In 2016, the above- mentioned predicate device, the Erchonia® ZERONA ® Z6 OTC, received 
FDA market clearance “for use as a non- invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment for the 
reduction of body circumference”, under 510(k) K162578.  
 
It is intended that the results of the current proposed clinical study be used to support a 510(k) 
submission to FDA for clearance to market the Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  for the same 
indication for use as for the Erchonia Z ERONA ® Z6 OTC  as cleared under K162578 by 
[CONTACT_719226] . 
 The current clinical study protocol evaluating efficacy of the Erchonia Violet ZERONA® Z6 for 
the reduction of body circumference is based on the efficacy protocol for the clinical study  
whose results were submitted in support of clearance of the predicate device, the Erchonia 
Zerona® Z6 OTC , under K143007.  
 The 510(k)  submitted under K143007 additionally included a successful evaluation of Human 
Factors Testing and Validation. It is determined that a Human Factors Validation and Testing

Version  1.0                Page  4      March 22, 20 22 
 
 
 study is not applicable for the Erchonia Violet Z ERONA ® Z6 OTC  as the Operational 
Instructions for Use for the Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  and additional safety and other 
information contained in the Violet ZERONA® Z6 OTC Installation and Proper Use Reference 
Guide are identical to those for use of the predicate laser , the Erchonia ZERONA ® Z6 OTC , 
with the only differences being the visible  light output (violet compared to red) and the duration 
of treatment administrations  (20 minutes compared to 40 minutes , which is automatically 
programmed into the device and cannot be altered by [CONTACT_28024] ), neither of which therefore 
impact s the user’s operation of the Violet Z ERONA ® Z6 OTC  versus the ZERONA ® Z6 OTC 
laser device,  and therefore has no impact on the user’s ability to understand or appl y the 
instructions for use contained in the Violet ZERONA® Z6 OTC Installation and Proper Use 
Reference Guide or to safely or effective ly apply treatments with the device relative to that 
demonstrated for the predicate device.  The study population and all elements of the device 
protocol and the Violet ZERONA® Z6 OTC Installation and Proper Use Reference Guide other than the pre- programmed administration timing duration (as explained above)  will be identical to 
that employed in evaluation of the  Erchonia Z ERONA ® Z6 OTC  device in support of K143007 . 
 
Both the predicate and the subject laser devices have the same treatment protocol as will be 
evaluated for the Violet ZERONA ® Z6  OTC  in this current study: 6 treatments occurring over 2 
weeks: 3 treatments per  week; each treatment every other day.  
 Therefore, as usability has already been established, and all other variables of device user, use, 
and application are held constant, the goal of this study is  solely  to demonstrate that efficacy of 
application of violet light over 20 minutes per treatment administration procedure using the 
Erchonia ZERONA® Violet Z6 OTC is equivalent to application of  red light over 40 minutes per 
treatment administration procedure using the Erchonia ZERON A® Z6 OTC  with respect to 
reduction in body circumference attained .  
 The rationale for evaluating efficacy of the application of violet diodes  in this current study  is that 
prior research and preliminary testing has demonstrated that non- inferior (equival ent or 
superior ) results  with respect to body circumference reduction can be attained with application 
of violet light compared with application of  red light using the same treatment administration 
protocol but with lesser treatment administration time per  treatment administration – 20 minutes 
versus 40 minutes, respectively, which is a significant time savings to the patient.

 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This clinical study is a n open- label  single -arm non-inferiority design to evaluate the efficacy of 
the Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  in providing noninvasive body circumference reduction.  
As such, all enrolled subjects will receive the active study treatment, and therefore, neither 
randomization to procedure group nor blinding of the subjects nor investigative parties is  
applicable.  
 STUDY BLINDING 
As all subjects in this study will receive the active procedure administration with the Erchonia 
Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC , it is not possible to blind either subjects or investigators (device 
users) .  
 However, there are two aspects of this study design that assist in supporting elements  of 
blinding:  
 
(i) The primary efficacy study outcome assessment of body circumference measurements is 
objective; and  
 (ii) As the outcome data from this current study will be comparatively assessed to that of the  
active treatment group in the  predicate device clinical study (the clinical data for the 
Zerona® Z6 OTC  submitted  in support of K143007), it is possible to blind t he study 
statistician as to which data set pertains to which study, as the variables for each will be 
identical. The data from each study will be de- identified and presented to the study 
statistician simply as ‘Group A’ and ‘Group B’ data. The statistician will not be aware of 
which group – A or B – contains the current study data and which contains the comparative 
data.  The study statistician will also not be made aware of sample sizes for either analysis 
group if there is a difference. In this way, study success analysis by [CONTACT_719230].  
 
INVESTIGATORS / DEVICE USERS 
The respective investigator /device user  sample population, defined as those who will be 
administering the treatments with the Erchonia Zerona® Violet Z6 OTC ,  will be repr esentative 
of the population of users (non- medical  professionals ) who may potentially purchase and 
operate the Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC device following clearance. The respective investigator s / 
device users  will be the identical user population as that enrol led in the study  evaluat ing efficacy 
and usability of  the Zerona® Z6 OTC device in the 2014 comparative study  (predicate) and for 
whom OTC market clearance of the device was subsequently attained through K143007.   
 SUBJECTS  
 
The study sample population, defined as those who will be receiving the study treatments with 
the Erchonia Zerona® Violet Z6 OTC, will be identical to the study sample population as defined 
and enrolled in the reference study and as intended to be the real -world patient population 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_719222].  
 
Subject Sample  
Subjects will be males and females 18 years or older who are potential candidates for receiving 
the course of treatment using the Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  device and who subsequently 
satisfy all criteria on the Client Qualification Checklist  as verified by [CONTACT_719231] .

 B. BODY MASS INDEX (BM I) CALCULATION:  
- BMI is 30 or less => the client qualifies for Violet ZERONA  Z6 OTC  treatment.  
- BMI is more than 30 => the client does not qualify for Violet ZERONA  Z6 OTC   
 
PRE-PROCEDURE STUDY MEASUREMENTS 
A subject who satisfies the criteria to receive the study treatment per the Client Qualification 
Checklist will complete the following pre- procedure study assessments:  
 
Circumference Measurements of the waist, hips, and thighs per the instructions contained in 
SECTION 3: VIOLET ZERONA® Z6  OTC  OPERATION of the Installation and Proper Use 
Reference Guide, under the MEASUREMENT PROTOCOL & MEASUREMENT AREAS  header 
on page 28.    
PROCEDURE ADMINISTRATION ACTIVITIES  
 The procedure administration phase of the study will commence immediately following 
completion of the  pre-procedure activities , on the same day.  The first treatment administration 
with the Violet ZERONA® Z6 OTC  will be administered that day.  
 
The investigator  / device user  is required to follow the instructions in SECTION 3: VIOLET 
ZERONA® Z6  OTC  OPERATION of the Erchonia Violet Z ERONA ® Z6  OTC  Installation and  
Proper Use Reference Guide to correctly administer a procedure.  
 
The procedure administration protocol in this current study is identical to that evaluated in the 
[ADDRESS_981422] on the user’s operation of the Violet ZERONA ® Z6  OTC  device 
compared with the ZERONA®  Z6 OTC device.  
 
Both the predicate and the currently evaluated laser devices have the same treatment protocol: 
6 treatments occurring over 2 weeks: 3 treatments per week; each treatment every other day.  
 
PROCEDURE ASSESSMENTS 
 After completion of the sixth and final scheduled Violet ZERONA ® Z6 OTC  treatment 
administration, the  investigator  / user  will again record the subject’s BMI and waist, hips and 
thighs circumference following the protocols in the Installation and Proper Use Reference 
Guide.   
 This is considered the study endpoint evaluation at which change relative to pre- procedure 
measurements will be assessed.  Evaluation for and recording of any observed or reported 
adverse events will be conducted at each study visit.

 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN 
 
 
STUDY POPULATIONS  
The following two study populations will be evaluated:  
 
1. M odified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population  
 
Primary analysis of efficacy will be according to the modified intent to treat (ITT) analysis, 
including all enrolled subjects who had a valid baseline visit and received at least the first study 
treatment with the Ercho nia Violet ZERONA® Z6 OTC.  
 
Missing data for the mITT population will be handled through Last Observation Carried Forward 
(LOCF) methodology. Sensitivity analysis may be applied if missing data is extensive.  
 
2. P er Protocol Population.  
 
Secondary analysis of efficacy to confirm the findings of the primary analysis will be conducted 
on the per protocol population, comprised of all subjects who completed the study per protocol 
through to the final treatment administration and outcomes measures recording visit.  
 
PRIMARY  EFFICACY OUTCOME  
The primary efficacy outcome for this clinical study is the mean change  in combined waist -hips-
bilateral thighs circumference measurement  at study endpoint (following completion of the sixth 
and final treatment administration procedure) relative to baseline (pre- procedure).  
 
PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOME EVALUATION  
To determine primary efficacy outcome success, the mean change across all subjects enrolled in this study in combined waist -hips-bilateral thighs circumference measurements  at study 
endpoint relative to baseline will be calculated and compared to the relative mean change 
attained for treated subjects in the reference study.  
 
As this s tudy is a non- inferiority design , the research hypothesis is that violet diode therapy with 
the Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6  OTC  is either equivalent to , or superior to , red diode therapy 
with the Erchonia Zerona® Z6 OTC in effecting a clinically meaningful reduction in body 
circumference.  
 
The selected equivalence margin (δ) is  ±5%. Therefore, non -inferiority will be established if the 
mean change in combined circumference measurement for subjects treated with the violet diode laser in the current study is n o more than 5% less than the subject group who received 
treatment with the red diode laser in the predicate reference trial that supported efficacy of the Zerona® Z6 OTC device (K143007). 
 
In the predicate reference study, the mean change in combined circu mference measurements 
across the same 6-treatment [ADDRESS_981423] group in the current study is    
-3.72±5% inches ( -3.53 to -3.91 inches). This is defined as the maximally  clinically acceptable 
difference for which the range of efficacy values ( ±5%) are “close enough” to be considered 
equivalent.

 Hypotheses  
 
• Null Hypothesis : Treatment application of the Erchonia Violet Z ERONA ® Z6  OTC  is inferior to 
treatment application of the Erchonia® Zerona® Z6 OTC in effecting a clinically meaningful reduction in body circumference. 
 Hₒ: µ < -3.53 inches  
 • Alternative Hypotheses : Treatment application of the Erchonia® Violet Z ERONA ® Z6 OTC  is 
NOT inferior to treatment application of the Zerona® Z6 OTC in effecting a clinically meaningful reduction in body circumference.  
 H
1: µ ≥ -3.[ADDRESS_981424] to statistical 
significance of change and/or against pre- determined non- inferiority success criteria.  
 
(i) T-test for independent samples will be performed to compare the mean change in combined 
circumference measurements across study evaluation (at endpoint relative to baseline) for subjects treated with the Violet ZERONA® Z6 OTC in the current study to the relative mean 
change for subjects treated with the ZERONA® Z6 OTC in the reference study treatment 
group. i.e., between device treatment groups. A finding of the difference being not 
statistically significant  (p>0.05) will provide statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
support for the equivalency of the efficacy of the two devices.  
(ii) Responder rate analysis will be conducted wherein i ndividual responder success is defined 
per the reference study as at least a 3.0- inch reduction (≥-3.0 inches) in combined 
circumference measurements for the waist, hips , and bilateral thighs from baseline to after 
study treatment completion. The maximally clinically acceptable difference for which the 
responder rate for the current study subject group is defined is (±5%) , that is, 73% +/ - 5% 
(68% - 78%), as the responder rate attained in the reference study was 73%.  
 
ADDITIONAL SECOND ARY EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
 
Additional secondary efficacy analysis will comprise descriptive only presentation of the mean, 
standard deviation, and range of circumference measurements (inches) for  each individual 
treatment area of the waist, hips, and right and left thighs, separately,  at baseline,  and endpoint, 
and the change between the two assessment points , in table format. As no additional claims are 
intended to be supported based on the additional secondary efficacy analysis, no statistical analysis of findings will be performed.  
 INDIVIDUAL TEST SITE EFFICACY ANALYSIS  
 Comparison of the primary efficacy outcome of  mean change in combined waist -hips-bilateral 
thighs circumference measurements at study endpoint relative to baseline for subjects treated in 
the current study with the Violet Zerona® Z6 between each of the two study test sites will be conducted to suppor t poolability of the study results .

 SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
Safety analyses will be based on all enrolled subjects and will be assessed by [CONTACT_719233]/or reported adverse events between subjects who received treatments with the Erchonia Violet ZERONA ® Z6  OTC  in the current 
study and subjects who received treatments with the Erchonia ZERONA®  Z6 OTC treatment  in 
the predicate reference study. A chi -square test with a continuity correction will be performed to 
compare the percentage of subjects who had adverse events between the two subject  groups.

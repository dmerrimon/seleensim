STUDY OBJECTIVES  Primary Objectives:  
•Further establish the safety and tolerability of the VXA -A1.1 oral vaccin e
•D
etermine the clinical efficacy  of VXA -A1.[ADDRESS_1275270] illness  caused by
[CONTACT_908334] A strain influenza virus challenge 3 months following a single
immunization in compa rison to placebo and QIV
Secondary Objectives:  
•Determine the ability of VXA -A1.1 to modify disease severity compared to QIV
and placebo
•Determine the correlation of immunogenicity parameters with clinical outcome
•Determine the quantity and duration of  influenza virus  shedding by [CONTACT_16641] -PCR
•Evaluate the immunogenicity of VXA -A1.1:
•Assess the ability of VXA -A1.[ADDRESS_1275271] the matched challenge strain in comparison to licensed
QIV
•Assess the ability of VXA -A1.1 to  elicit more broadly cross - reactiv e
s
erological immune responses in comparison to licensed QIV
Exploratory Objectives:  
•Determine the resulting vaccine specific immune response by [CONTACT_167054] (Mass flowcytometry) and antibody repertoire sequence analysis, comparing oral VXA -A1.
[ADDRESS_1275272] 
A/Cal ifornia/7/2009(H1N1)  pdm09 -like virus will be challenged with an influenza 
A/H1N1 human challenge strain approximately  90 days  (+30 day window)  after 
vaccination with a single dose of H1N1 HA Adenoviral -vector based seasonal influenza 
vaccine and dsRNA adjuvant (VXA -A1.1), an injectable QIV vaccine (Fluzone®), and/or 
placebo (double -dummy design).   
An independent  Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will convene at regular intervals during 
the influenza challenge period, and  also ad hoc  as needed  during the vaccination and challenge 
periods , to oversee the safety of the study.   
To accommodate the limited size of the  isolation unit that will be utilized for the challenge and 
post-challenge sequestration period, subjects will move through the study (enrollment, 
vaccination and challenge) sequentially in a total of 6 cohorts. Each cohort will randomize approximat ely 30 subjects to obtain approximately 25 subjects per cohort for the challenge phase. 
Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 (VXA -A1.1:  Fluzone
®: Placebo).

TUDY DESIGN, 
REGIMEN AND 
DOSING  (cont.) The study will be conducted in two parts.   
Part A : Subjects will be randomized in a double -blinded manner to receive a single 
administration of one of three treatment arms:  
•Arm 1:  VXA -A1.1 oral vaccine tablets [ 1x1011 IU±0.5 log] + placebo IM injection
(n=72 subjects)  
•Arm 2:  Fluzone® IM injection + oral placebo tablets (n= 72 subjects)
•Arm 3:  Placebo IM injection + oral placebo tablets (n=36 subjects)
S
ubjects will return to the site for ~8 visits and be contact[CONTACT_908335] A (see Study 
Schedule section below as well as Schedule of Study Events, Table 1).  
Part B: Following confirmation of eligibility, s ubjects will be challenged with a wild -type 
influenza A H1 virus strain (A/H1N1 pdm09) 90 days (+30 day window) follow ing 
vaccination (~25 subjects/ cohort). Blood samples will be collected to evaluate immunogenicity  at pre -challenge. Subjects will remain in the isolation unit for at least 6, 
and up to [ADDRESS_1275273] -challenge (see Study Schedule section below as well as Schedule of 
Study Events, Table 1).  
Following challenge, influenza symptoms will be systematically collected using the Flu -
PRO questionnaire, which will be completed by [CONTACT_908336] [ADDRESS_1275274] challenge. Additionally, signs of influenza will be assessed by [CONTACT_908337] a targeted physical exam during the sequestration period .  
Blood samples, nasopharyngeal swab samples and tissue paper weights will also be collected (Table 1). Vital signs will be measured a pproximately every [ADDRESS_1275275] -challenge for a final efficacy and routine safety (unsolicited 
AEs) follow -up visit.   
Part B will continue for purposes of collecting long term safety follow -up (SAEs and

The primary efficacy endpoint is the occurrence of illness (attack rate) caused by [CONTACT_908346] A strain influenza virus challenge at [ADDRESS_1275294] one day with:  
1)T wo  symptoms present of at least “A little bit”, “1 time” or “ Rarely ” or one  sympto m
present of at least “Somewhat ”, “2 times” or “ Sometimes ” among the acute influen za
s
ymptoms  on the Flu- PRO ( Appendix 2)
and 
2) l
aboratory -confirmed infection ( ≥2 positive quantitative RT -PCR results while
sequestered)Comparisons will be performed in:  
1)
al
l challenged subjects in each respective vaccine group; and then
2)i
nfected subjects (as defined by ≥2 positive quantitative RT -PCR results while
sequestered ) in each vaccine group

08 June 2017 (Amend. 3)  CONFIDENTIAL  14 laboratory tests; findings of vital signs; and findings of physical examination and 
pulmonary function compared to pla cebo and QIV.  
Secondary Immunological: 
IgA and/or IgG ASC at Day 8, T cell (IFN -γ and GrB) responses at Day [ADDRESS_1275295] matched strain compared to licensed QIV and 
placebo at Day 90 (pre -challenge)  for all challenged subj ects 
E
xploratory: 
Determine the resulting vaccine specific immune response by [CONTACT_167054] (Mass flow 
cytometry) and antibody repertoire sequence analysis, comparing oral VXA -A1.1 to the 
inactivated QIV vaccine for homing, memory, and activation of B and T cells.  
STATISTICAL 
CONSIDERATIONS  This is a proof -of-concept study to determine whether VXA -A1.1 may enhance efficacy 
and/or immunogenicity when compared with licensed QIV . All analyses will be descriptive 
in nature, in which results for various endpoints described above will be compared among VXA -A1.1, QIV and placebo groups. No formal evaluation of sample size was performed 
with respect to these endpoints. Group sizes of 60, [ADDRESS_1275296] any signals suggestive of improved efficacy or immunogenicity. No statistical adjustments will be made to account for multiplicity.  
In doing the analysis, any subjects who ha d elevated HAI titers greater than 1 :10 on the pre 
vaccination  (baseline)  blood sample should be excluded from statistical analysis and should 
be excluded from the challenge phase analysis if they are enrolled.

AESIs/NOCIs Diary Card  [ADDRESS_1275304] (Biofire or Luminex) performed the same day and the 
subsequent day.  Subjects will be discharged based on the Biofire /Luminex test results, their influenza signs and symptoms and any other available data at the discretion of the Investigator.  
Assessments will only be made once unless the subject is not fit to leave the unit. If subjects are not discharged on Day B6,  the same assessments will be performed on Days 7 through 9, 
except immunological testing. Subjects who withdraw consent prior to absence of viral shedding will be requested to remain in quarantine but will only undergo assessments to determine 
absence of viral  symptomology and shedding before discharge.   
2 In addition to the main Informed Consent Form (ICF), subjects will confirm consent prior to challenge in Part B  
[ADDRESS_1275305].  
5 Pre-challenge assessment.  May be completed at Day B -1 or Day B1 pre -challenge.
6 Anti-Ad5 assay is not performed on serum collected at Day 90 
7 Administration of challenge virus will be in the morning.  
8 Solicitation of acute influenza symptoms (Flu -PRO) will be completed by [CONTACT_908348] (after 3pm) and signs will be assessed by [CONTACT_1275]/study staff daily during the sequestration period. Subje cts will continue to complete the Flu -PRO once daily following discharge to Day [ADDRESS_1275306] -challenge.  
9 Nasopharyngeal swabs for viral shedding (qRT -PCR) will be collected twice daily approximately 12 hours apart from Day B1 to day of discharge. Swabs should be collected from 
alternating nostrils (left or right) at each collection time point. The initial swab at Day B1 will be collected pre-challenge.  
10    A second nasopharyngeal swab will be collected for testing by [CONTACT_908349]/Luminex at baseline visit.  Subseq uent testing by [CONTACT_908350] B5 with confirmation of 
negative results by [CONTACT_908349]/Luminex test starting at Day B6. Data will be reviewed before discharging subject from unit; subjects with 2 consecutive negative values by [CONTACT_908349]/Lum inex 
test may be discharged starting at Day B6.  
11    Pre-challenge  
12 Oseltamivir (5 -day course) will be administered to symptomatic subjects starting on day of discharge per the discretion of the investigator.  
13    AESIs/NOCIs Diary Card will be dispensed at the Day B30 Visit (end of active period/last efficacy visit) to assist subjects in recording symptoms of AESIs/N OCIs through Day 365.  Prior 
to Day B30. AESIs/NOCIs will be collected from Part A, Day 1 (vaccination) to Part B, Day B30 via site  visits and phone contacts.

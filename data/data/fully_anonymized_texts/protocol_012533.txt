Co-Medication: Dexamethasone
Dose: 8 mg
Mode of Administration: Oral, twice daily on Day –1, Day 1 (the day of dosing Rova-T), and 
Day [ADDRESS_104418]:Topotecan
Dose: 1.5 mg/m2(or per the local label)
Mode of Administration: Intravenous, on Days 1 – 5 of each 21-Day cycle.
Duration of Treatment:
Regimen of Arm A will be administered for 2 cycles unless earlier discontinuation is warranted due to 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or any other reason; up to two additional cycles of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94370] [ADDRESS_104419].
Follow up activities, including overall survival assessments, End of Treatment visits and AE/SAE 
reporting must occur no later than 12 February 2020.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Overall Survival (OS):   After the End of treatment, survival information will be collected at 
approximately 6-week intervals (or as requested by [CONTACT_26216]) continuing until the 
endpoint of death, the subject becomes lost to follow-up, [COMPANY_013] terminates the study, or until 12 February 2020.
Progression-Free Survival (PFS):   will be derived according to progressive disease per RECIST 
version 1.[ADDRESS_104420] scanning.Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO):   health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptom assessment 
will be assessed at baseline, during the treatment cycle, at the end of treatment visit and every 6 weeks 
thereafter until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy via the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C15-PAL (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL), EORTC 
QLQ-LC13, and EuroQoL Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaires.
Objective Response Rate (ORR):  will be derived per RECIST version 1.1.  Radiographic tumor 
assessments for response will be conducted by [CONTACT_26214], every 6 weeks for 30 weeks, then every 9 weeks until progression or death.
Safety:
Adverse events, laboratory profiles, physical examinations and vital signs will be assessed throughout 
the study.
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104421] 2016-003726-17
11
Criteria for Evaluation (Continued):
Pharmacokinetic:Serum concentrations of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94371]-drug conjugate (ADC) and the presence of 
anti-therapeutic antibodies (ATA) will be determined.
Biomarkers/Pharmacogenetics:
Biomarker assessments will include analyses of tumor material and circulating tumor cells for DLL3 
expression, blood samples for inflammatory, tumor and safety markers.  Samples may also be used for other nucleic acid or protein based exploratory biomarkers to understand the sensitivity or resistance to rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94372].
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
Following the fourth safety review by [CONTACT_31849], on [ADDRESS_104422] v1.1.
Overall survival (OS) is the primary efficacy endpoint.  OS is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of death from any cause (i.e., date of subject's death – date of randomization + 1).  For subjects who are alive at the time of the analysis, the data will be censored at the last date they were documented to be alive.  Subjects with no post-baseline information will be censored at the date of 
randomization plus [ADDRESS_104423], stratified 
by [CONTACT_94487], testing the null hypothesis (rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94373] (Arm A) is not superior to topotecan arm (Arm B) in OS).  The hazard ratio (HR) of Arm A over Arm B will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model.  The OS curves for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-limit method.  Two-sided, 95% confidence interval for 
median OS will be computed.  Landmark survival rate, defined as the survival rate estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach at pre-defined timepoints from randomization (e.g., 6, 12 and 18 months), will be summarized, presenting two-sided 95% CIs.  
Secondary time-to-event endpoints of PFS and DOR will be analyzed using the same statistical method 
described for the analysis of OS.  Analysis of categorical endpoints such as ORR and CBR will be performed for the randomized subjects with measureable disease at baseline.  Comparison of the categorical endpoints will be carried out using a one-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_94487]. 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104424] 2016-003726-17
12
Statistical Methods (Continued):
Testing Strategy:To meet global regulatory requirements, a multiple testing strategy will be implemented to control the 
family-wise type I error for comparisons of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94374].
The following null hypotheses are considered:
H1:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94375].H2:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94376].
H3:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94377] 
C2D1 for rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94378] C3D1 for topotecan arm.
H4:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94379].H5:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94380].
H6:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94381].
The family of null hypotheses will be tested using a hierarchical procedure, i.e., in a fixed sequence of 
{H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6}.  Hypothesis H1 will be tested first, and no further tests will be performed if H1 is not rejected.  Thereafter, each hypothesis will be tested in the order specified if and only if H1 and all preceding null hypotheses are rejected.  Otherwise testing in the hierarchical sequence will stop.  
Safety:
A safety analysis will be performed for all subjects treated with the study drug.  For the study as a whole, 
adverse events will be evaluated and summarized.  Laboratory test results and vital signs will be summarized as appropriate.
Sample Size:
Following the fourth safety review by [CONTACT_31849], on 04 December 2018 the IDMC recommended that 
enrollment in the study is discontinued due to overall survival concerns associated with the study drug.  444 subjects were enrolled in the study.  The following paragraph describes how the sample size was determined for the study.
The sample size of the study is primarily determined by [CONTACT_94488].  Approximately 600 subjects 
in total will be randomized to rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (Arm A) or topotecan (Arm B) in a 2:1 ratio.  It is assumed that median overall survival in the topotecan arm (Arm B) will be around 6.[ADDRESS_104425], at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 and a power of 85%, a total of [ADDRESS_104426] an increase in median OS to 8.67 months in rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94373] (Arm A), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.75 (i.e., a reduction in the hazard death of 25%).  It is projected that an observed hazard ratio of 0.829 or less, corresponding to 1.34 months or greater improvement in median OS, would result in statistical significance in the final analysis of OS.  
Interim Analysis:
No interim analysis is planned.  
Biomarkers:Biomarkers will be measured at baseline and post-treatment, with analyses performed to identify 
markers associated with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94382], sensitivity, pharmacodynamics, or safety.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Small Cell Lung Cancer
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an important unmet medical need, representing 15 –
20% of the 220,000 annual new cases of lung cancer.1,2  SCLC arises from epi[INVESTIGATOR_94384].  Historically, SCLC has been staged using Veterans Administration Lung Study Group (VA LG) classification as limited versus extensive stage disease, the former being defined as disease limited to the chest that can be encompassed by a radiation field while the latter includes all other cases.  Approximately one-third of newly diagnosed subjects will have limited stage disease while the rest will be extensive.  TNM classification is also used to stage SCLC.  Systemic chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of therapy for all stages of SCLC.  Standard initial chemotherapy for all subjects with a suitable performance status consists of a platinum salt (carboplatin or cisplatin) in combination with a second agent, usually etoposide or irinotecan.  For subjects with limited stage disease, concurrent or sequential involved-field thoracic radiotherapy is indicated.  Response rates to initial therapy are high, ranging from 70 –90% for limited stage and 60 – 70% for extensive stage; however, responses are typi[INVESTIGATOR_94385], leading to median survivals of 14 – 20 months and 9 –11 months, respectively.
3
Options for subjects with relapsed/recurrent SCLC disease are limited.  The only agent with several global regulatory approvals is topoisomerase I inhibitor topotecan, but its activity is less than impressive, and associated toxicity is significant.
4  Response rate with 
topotecan is approximately 14%, while median PFS and OS are 2.[ADDRESS_104443] predictor of topotecan efficacy is sensitivity to front line therapy:  subjects with relapse after more than 90 days from the completion of front line therapy (sensitive) have better results with topotecan compared to subjects that progress while receiving front line therapy or in less than 90 days of its completion (refractory/resistant).  Several other single agent or combination regimens used in second line SCLC offer efficacy similar to topotecan.

Therefore, exploration of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_94386], with the goals 
of extending disease control and improving overall survival.
3.2 Delta-Like Protein 3
Delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) is an atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], inhibitory ligand of the Notch receptor family, 
discovered by [CONTACT_94489] a novel therapeutic target in SCLC and other high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas.  It was identified by [CONTACT_94490] (TICs) isolated from SCLC and large cell neuroendocrine cancer (LCNEC) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), and found to be expressed in the majority of SCLC and LCNEC tumors, but with no detectable protein expression in normal tissues or non-neuroendocrine tumor types.
5  DLL3 has been 
implicated in the regulation of cell fate decisions during development, and likely acts as an oncogene in high-grade neuroendocrine tumors where it is a downstream transcriptional target of the achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) transcription factor in SCLC tumor cells, and acts to inhibit the Notch receptor pathway, thereby [CONTACT_94491].
5-7
3.3 Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94387] (SC16LD6.5) is a DLL3-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consisting of the humanized DLL3-specific IgG1 monoclonal antibody SC16; the DNA cross linking pyrrolobenzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (PBD) agent SC-DR002 (D6.5); and a protease-cleavable linker that covalently links SC DR002 to SC16.  The primary mechanism of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94388]3 on target-expressing cells, followed by [CONTACT_61831]-DLL3 complex and release of SC-DR002 via proteolytic cleavage in late endosomes.  Interstrand crosslinks of cellular DNA induced by [CONTACT_94492]-DR002 leads to cellular cytotoxicity.
In a Phase 1 study (Study SCRX16-001), rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94389] 0.2 –
0.4 mg/kg exhibited encouraging efficacy in recurrent SCLC, achieving a 31% (8/26) and 85% (22/26) central review-adjudicated confirmed objective response rate (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR), respectively, in subjects whose tumors expressed DLL3 in 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]

≥50% of cells. Median overall survival was 7.7 months in DLL3 ≥ 50% subjects at all 
dose levels, with a 1-year survival rate of 30% ([COMPANY_013] Stemcentrx, data on file).  
In a Phase 2 SCRX001-002 (TRINITY) study in patients with SCLC recurrent after at 
least two systemic chemotherapy regimens, rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94389] 0.3 mg/kg every 6 weeks for two cycles (with an option for additional two cycles upon progression occurring ≥  12 weeks after the second dose) had shown confirmed objective response rate 
of 16%, progression-free survival of 3.[ADDRESS_104446]-progression cycles of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] ([COMPANY_013] Stemcentrx, data on file).

related TEAE groups of Grade 3 is thrombocytopenia (10.3%), pleural effusions (6.2%), 
and anaemia (5.4%).  In addition, preclinical toxicology studies conducted in the rat and the cynomolgus monkey have identified bone marrow, lung, liver and kidney as potentialsources of clinical adverse events (AEs) ([COMPANY_013] Stemcentrx data on file).  Accordingly, safety assessments will include regular assessments at protocol-specified time points of routine physical examination, laboratory and imaging tests, echocardiograms, a fluid retention questionnaire, daily weights, and spot urine protein testing.
4.0 Study Objectives
The primary objectives of the study are to assess if treatment with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94359] (OS) compared to topotecan in subjects with advanced or metastatic DLL3
highSCLC who have first disease progression during or following front-
line platinum based chemotherapy.
The secondary objectives of the study are as follows:  to assess if the treatment with 
rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94360] (PFS) compared to topotecan; to assess the effect on patient reported outcomes (i.e., health-related quality of life and symptom assessment) between two arms; to assess if treatment with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94362] (ORR) and clinical benefit rate (CBR) compared to topotecan; and to compare the duration of objective response between two arms in subjects with advanced or metastatic DLL3
highSCLC who have first disease progression 
during or following front-line platinum based chemotherapy.
The exploratory objectives are to compare the safety and tolerability of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94393]; to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007]; to evaluate DLL3 expression in circulating tumor cells and to evaluate pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarkers for association with efficacy and safety.

5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
The study was designed to enroll approximately 600 subjects with advanced or metastatic 
DLL3highSCLC to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue 
number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  DLL3highis defined as 
≥75% tumor cells staining positive according to the VENTANA DLL3 (SP347) IHC 
Assay.
This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multinational, and multicenter study comparing 
the efficacy, safety and tolerability of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94394]3

laboratory.  Archived or fresh tumor material can be used for the DLL3 testing.  Testing for DLL3 status may occur at any time after initial diagnosis.
Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] 
(Arm A) or topotecan (Arm B):
●Subjects assigned to Arm A will receive 0.3 mg/kg rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] 
(IV) on Day 1 of a 42-Day cycle for 2 cycles, along with 8 mg orally (PO) of dexamethasone twice daily on Day –1, Day 1, and Day 2.  Regimen of Arm A

●Arm B subjects will receive 1.5 mg/m2topotecan (IV) on Days 1 – [ADDRESS_104454].
Subjects will be stratified by [CONTACT_94483] (yes vs. no), prior PCI (yes 
vs. no) for subjects with no prior history of brain metastases, sensitivity to first line platinum-based regimen [sensitive (OR/SD after first line therapy and progression/recurrence-free interval ≥ 90 days) vs. refractory/resistant (PD as best 
response or < 90 days
8progression/recurrence-free interval after first line therapy)] and 
LDH level (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) at screening.
Post-baseline radiographic assessments will be performed every [ADDRESS_104455] 30 weeks and then every 9 weeks until radiographic progression or death.  Radiographic information will be collected to determine response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1.  For subjects receiving post-progression doses of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94395] [IP_ADDRESS].
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved clinically significant laboratory result, the site will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory results or adverse event is achieved.
Subjects no longer undergoing clinical assessments will have survival information 
reported approximately every 6 weeks (or as requested by [CONTACT_26216]) beginning at the last clinical assessment and continuing until the endpoint of death, the subject has become lost to follow-up, or termination of the study by [CONTACT_26282].

serosal effusions (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), or other non-cancer-related symptoms including 
premedication for known hypersensitivity reactions to contrast agent for CT scans is allowed.
Routine prophylaxis with vaccines is permitted; however, vaccines used should not 
contain live micro-organisms.
If the subject is taking chronic suppressive anti-infectives (antiviral, antifungal, or 
antibacterial), appropriate investigation must be completed prior to randomization, and documentation must exclude active infection.  After exclusion of active infection, otherwise eligible subjects should complete or continue anti-infectives as prescribed.
If a subject requires palliative radiation during the study (e.g., symptomatic worsening of 
a bone lesion) diagnostic imaging has to be performed to assess for radiographic progression prior to radiation, and documentation of non-progressive status by [CONTACT_94498].  Any cancer-directed therapy a subject receives due to disease improvement will be subject to TA MD approval and must be discussed with the TA MD in advance.
In the event of isolated CNS progression during study treatment for subjects in Arm A, 
investigational product will be withheld while palliative treatment is administered (e.g., radiotherapy) in accordance with institutional practice.  During this time, the subject should be fully evaluated for other sites of progressive disease.  If progression is isolated to the CNS, investigational product may be restarted at least [ADDRESS_104474] event of progressive disease, scans will continue to be collected until second event of progressive disease.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Therapy
Subjects may not receive other investigational drugs, immunosuppressive medications, 
radiotherapy, or systemic anti-neoplastic therapy during the study, other than as allowed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Additionally, strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450 
3A4 (CYP3A4) should be avoided if a subject is randomized to Arm A (refer to Table 1).

5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Biomarker, Pharmacogenetic 
and Safety Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures described are listed in the following section of this protocol and are 
summarized in tabular format in Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Procedures
Unless otherwise stated, the baseline measurement for any given variable will be defined 
as the last value obtained for the variable prior to the first dose of investigational product.
The collection of tumor material for DLL3 testing may be done at any time after the 
informed consent is signed and prior to randomization.  Screening procedures and radiographic assessments (CT scan or MRI) must be performed within [ADDRESS_104481] in the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) may occur within [ADDRESS_104482] 2016-003726-17
40
Subsequent study procedures should be performed within 3 business days prior to the 
scheduled treatment visit.  For visits where no treatment is administered, procedures may be performed within ± [ADDRESS_104483]-treatment follow up, and survival follow up phase visits may occur within ± [ADDRESS_104484] laboratory samples redrawn to meet eligibility within the same 28 day screening window.  Subjects who meet the inclusion criteria and do not meet any of the exclusion criteria may be randomized. Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TAMD) review and approval is required in cases where a second rescreen is required.
Subjects receiving additional doses of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94407] [IP_ADDRESS] and Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_104485]'s legally 
acceptable representative before any study-specific procedures are undertaken or before any prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study.  Certain standard of care procedures (i.e., ECG) may be utilized as appropriate to prevent repeat protocol-required Screening procedures, but should be discussed with the sponsor.  Informed consent may be obtained before the 28-day screening window.  Informed consent is also required for tumor biopsy for subjects without archived tumor material at screening.  For the optional tumor biopsy at time of disease progression, informed consent must be obtained at the time of initial consent.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104486] 2016-003726-17
41
Subjects will be considered screen failures if the informed consent has been signed and a 
study-specific procedure has been performed (e.g., central laboratories drawn), but subject does not randomize into the study.  The reason for screen failure will be documented in the source documentation and will be captured in the eCRF.
Tumor Material at Screening
For all subjects, archived or fresh tumor material must be submitted to the [COMPANY_013] 
designated central IHC laboratory for determination of DLL3 expression prior to randomization, as per Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.
Tumor material testing for DLL3 status may occur at any time after initial diagnosis for subjects who provide consent.  These subjects must be registered in IRT.  Eligibility at the time of tumor progression will depend on DLL3 status (as determined at any time after initial diagnosis), as well as the fulfillment of all other inclusion and exclusion criteria and the trial status (whether the study is still open for accrual).
If archived tissue provided for tumor material testing is not DLL3
high, re-testing can occur 
once the subject is re-screened using a fresh tissue biopsy.
Medical and Oncologic History; Adverse Event and Prior/Concomitant Medication 
Assessment
The following will be collected during the Screening Visit:
●Complete medical history, including demographics and documentation of any 
clinically significant medical condition and surgical history
●History of tobacco and alcohol use: 
○current smoker [subject who has > [ADDRESS_104487] 12 months] Date of initial cancer diagnosis
○past smoker [subject who has > [ADDRESS_104488] 12 months]
○never smoked [subject with ≤ 100 smoking events in lifetime]
●Detailed oncology history including:

○Histology
○Date of initial cancer diagnosis
○Date of disease progression
○TNM Stage at diagnosis (if available)
○VALG Stage at diagnosis (Extensive vs. Limited)
○Category of best response to front line platinum-based therapy (PD, SD, 
PR, CR)
○History of CNS metastases
○History of malignant pleural effusions
○Mutational status, if performed
○Any surgical cancer-related procedures
○Anti-cancer treatments administered (including first and last dose dates and type of modality)
●Detailed prior medication usage including dates of usage and dosing information for all other medications and supplements taken
On Cycle 1 Day 1, any changes observed from  the Screening assessments (prior to 
dosing) will be recorded in the subject's medical history.  At each visit, including the End 
of Treatment (EOT) Visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and any changes from baseline will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF.
All medication (prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins and/or herbal 
supplements) will be recorded beginning with first study drug administration through the [ADDRESS_104490] on Day 1 of each cycle.
Physical exam will include cardiac, pulmonary (including cardiopulmonary exam for 
pleural or pericardial effusions), evaluation of extremities for peripheral edema, neurological (sensory, motor, cranial nerves), head and neck, lymphatic, hepatobiliary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skin evaluation per local standard of care.
Vital Signs
Vital signs will be performed per Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.  
Vital sign determinations include weight, sitting blood pressure, heart rate and body 
temperature.  If possible, blood pressure and heart rate measurements should not immediately follow scheduled blood collections.
Weight will be collected in the clinic prior to dosing at each cycle and the recorded actual 
weight will be utilized for dosing calculations.  For weight assessments, the subject should not wear shoes.
Vital signs should be collected prior to the infusion.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12-lead ECG will be performed per Appendix C and Appendix D , Study 
Activities Tables.  ECGs consist of a single 12-lead study performed within a 5-minute 
window after at least [ADDRESS_104491] in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  Additional ECG monitoring may occur as clinically indicated during the study.
A qualified physician will determine whether any findings outside of normal 
physiological variation are clinically significant (in consultation with a cardiologist if necessary).  The physician will document whether findings are clinically significant (CS) 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104492] 2016-003726-17
44
or not clinically significant (NCS) on the tracing and sign and date the tracing.  The 
original annotated ECG tracing containing the physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.
Echocardiogram
Subjects will have echocardiograms performed per Appendix C and Appendix D , Study 
Activities Tables to assess any pericardial effusion during Screening, and prior to dosing 
at every cycle for subjects on Arm A, if present, as well as cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF).  Additional echocardiograms may occur as clinically indicated during the study.
ECOG Performance Status
The ECOG performance status will be documented according to Appendix C and 
Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.  Refer to Appendix E , Performance Status Scales 
Conversion for details.Documentation of Non-Childbearing Status and Pregnancy Testing
For each female subject, the investigator will document non-childbearing status 
(surgically sterile or post-menopausal for at least 1 year) or potential childbearing status.
Should a female study subject become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while 
participating in this study, she should inform the treating investigator immediately (Section 6.1.6).
For female subjects of childbearing potential, pregnancy testing should be performed according to Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.  A serum pregnancy 
test will be performed at Screening and the results must be available prior to the administration of the first dose of investigational product on C1D1.  Subjects with borderline pregnancy tests at Screening must have a serum pregnancy test ≥ [ADDRESS_104493].
Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently surgically 
sterile as defined in Section 5.2.4) at Screening do not require pregnancy testing.  Postmenopausal female subjects ≤ [ADDRESS_104494] a FSH level > 40 IU/L and 
will have FSH performed at Screening and assessed by [CONTACT_093].
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples for chemistry, hematology, coagulation, and urinalysis will be collected per 
Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.  Specific laboratory assessments 
are outlined in Table 2 , Clinical Laboratory Tests.
If the Screening assessment is performed within 7 days of C1D1, it is not required to be repeated on C1D1 unless clinically indicated.  All laboratory samples will be assessed using a certified central laboratory and these results will be used for all data analysis.  The central laboratory will provide instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_26172].  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditation) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory analyses for treatment decisions as per standard of care.
Qualified medical staff at the site will review, initial and date all local and central 
laboratory results.  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_94499].  Clinically significant laboratory values will be recorded as adverse events if they meet the criteria as specified in Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_104495] 2016-003726-17

Disease/Response Assessment (Radiographic Imaging)
Treatment response will be assessed by [CONTACT_94500]-specified 
time points as outlined in the Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.  
Diagnostic quality, spi[INVESTIGATOR_94408]; other CT methods or MRI may be used if performed consistently throughout the study for each individual subject.  Scans of the chest and abdomen must be obtained; scans of the neck and pelvis must also be obtained if there is documented or suspected involvement in these regions.  Screening radiographic assessment must include brain MRI/CT.  Only non-CNS disease will be considered measurable.  Disease response will be determined by [CONTACT_94501] v1.1 (Appendix H , Response Evaluation Criteria for 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104496] 2016-003726-17
47
Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.1).[ADDRESS_104497] be scheduled so that 
the results are known prior to the treatment visit.  
Effusion (pleural, pericardial, etc.) assessments will be performed at each radiographical 
assessment and any new findings communicated to the investigator prior to the next dose of investigational product.  Effusions should contribute to disease status assessment per RECIST v.1.1 only if confirmed malignant by [CONTACT_94502]-related; if disease progression is suspected solely based on the appearance of new or increase of existing effusions, confirmation of malignant nature of such effusions is strongly recommended prior to making the decision on treatment discontinuation due to known adverse event profile of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007].  If collected, effusion fluid must be tested centrally and/or locally for cytology if disease progression due to appearance/worsening of effusion is suspected.
For subjects whose tumors meet the criteria of partial or complete response (PR or CR), 
tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_74324] [ADDRESS_104498] from therapy.  
Refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS], Allowed Concomitant Therapy for details associated with CNS 
only progression.
The EOT radiographic assessment may be omitted if the previous radiographic assessment 
was performed within the preceding 6 weeks.
Scheduled radiographic assessments will not be affected by [CONTACT_94503]/or drug 
holidays.  Subjects will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_94504] [ADDRESS_104499] 30 weeks from additional Cycle 3 Day 1 and then again every 9 weeks until the second event of progressive disease.  If clinically indicated, radiographic assessments may be performed at times other than those indicated in Appendix C and Appendix D .  
MRI/CT of the Brain
MRI of the brain will be assessed at protocol-specified time points as outlined in the Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.  Brain MRI may be substituted by 
[CONTACT_94505]-indicated or not available.  MRI/CT of the brain is required after screening only when clinically indicated (e.g., CNS metastasis history and if CNS progression is suspected).
Randomization and Subject Number Assignment
An Interactive Response Technology system (IRT) will be utilized to register subjects.
Subjects who complete all Screening procedures and meet the eligibility criteria will 
proceed to randomization.  Refer to Section 5.5.[ADDRESS_104500] 
assignment to treatment arms.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)
Health-related quality of life and symptom assessments will be performed per Appendix C
and Appendix D , Study Assessments using the EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, the EORTC 
QLQ-LC13, and the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L).
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL)11is a shortened version of the EORTC QLQ-
C30, a widely used instrument for measuring QOL in cancer research.  It was developed to ease the difficulty of completing long surveys in subjects who may have a high 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104501] 2016-003726-17
49
symptom burden and short life expectancy.  The QLQ-C15-PAL questionnaire contains 
four multi-item scales (physical & emotional functioning, fatigue and pain) along with six individual items (nausea & vomiting, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, and global quality of life).
The EORTC QLQ-LC13 is a lung cancer specific module which will supplement the 
EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL, resulting in a 28-item disease and cancer site-specific quality of life and symptom questionnaire.  The QLQ-LC13 module items evaluate symptoms such as cough, haemoptysis, shortness of breath, sore mouth or tongue, dysphagia, tingling hands or feet, hair loss, and pain.
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) is a generic preference instrument that 
has been validated in numerous populations.  The EQ-5D-5L is composed of 5 questions and a visual analog scale (VAS) assessing overall health that can be converted into a single health status or "utility" score for use in an economic evaluation to adjust life-years gained by [CONTACT_423]'s health-related quality of life.
Fluid Retention Questionnaire (Including Subject Daily Weight)
Throughout the treatment period as outlined in the Appendix C and Appendix D , Study 
Activities Tables, subjects will be asked about the development of any new or worsening 
peripheral edema or dyspnea ( Appendix J , Fluid Retention Questionnaire).  The Arm A 
assessments on Cycle Days 8, 15, [ADDRESS_104502] and reviewing the questionnaire.  
Starting on Day 1 through the EOT visit, subjects in Arm A will maintain a diary of daily 
weight (captured on the Fluid Retention Questionnaire).  Subjects should be instructed to use a consistent device throughout the study.  The site should advise the subjects in cases where sudden weight gain is observed; the subject should contact [CONTACT_94506].

Additional Two Cycles of Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354] (Arm A only) 
Up to two additional cycles of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94409], however the last 
dose on study must be administered no later than 04 December 2019 for subjects in Arm A who provide consent and who satisfy all of the following criteria:
●achieved clinical benefit defined as stable disease or better with two initial 
cycles of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] 
●have findings indicative of disease progressing (not limited to CNS) at least 
12 weeks after the second dose of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] 
●received no other systemic anti-cancer therapy after two initial cycles of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] 
●had no prior on-study serosal effusions (Appendix I) or edema of > Grade 2 or 
other non-hematological treatment-related AEs of ≥ Grade [ADDRESS_104504] resolved to Grade 1 or baseline 
●have no clinically significant symptoms or signs related to disease progression and/or indicating threat to vital organs and no disease progression at critical 
anatomical sites necessitating urgent alternative treatment
●have no decline in performance status as compared to the last radiographic 
assessment at which no progressive disease was identified 
Any new or progressing CNS disease of such subject must be definitively treated 
(radiotherapy or surgery) in order for the subject to be eligible for the two additional cycles of treatment.  Subjects remaining in rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94410]-progression not limited to CNS will be followed radiographically until the second event of progressive disease.  CT/MRI scan must be performed within one week prior to the 4
thdose of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007].  
Subjects who do not provide consent for two additional doses of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94411] (EOT) visit before continuing on to the Survival Follow Up period.

End of Treatment (EOT) Visit
The visit during which an investigator identifies radiographic disease progression or the
subject is not eligible for two additional doses of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (Arm A only), or a subject meets other criteria for study treatment discontinuation will be considered the EOT Visit.  The EOT visit is the last visit during the treatment phase before a subject enters the Post Treatment Follow Up and/or Survival Follow Up period.  The EOT visit should occur within 7 days of documentation of the decision to discontinue treatment and prior to subjects beginning any new anti-cancer therapy, if possible.  The reason(s) for the discontinuation from study treatment will be recorded and assessments will be performed per Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables.
Disease/Response assessment, including MRI/CT if clinically indicated, may be omitted if performed within the last [ADDRESS_104506]-Treatment Follow Up (PTFU)
For all subjects without disease progression (including those who discontinue study 
treatment for reasons other than disease progression), the first follow-up visit will occur at 6 weeks (± 1 week) after the last Disease/Response Assessment, then every 6 weeks (± 1 week) until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.  Refer to Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities Tables for details of 
required assessments.
At progression, an optional fresh tumor material sample may be collected from subjects 
who have provided consent (Section [IP_ADDRESS], Collection and Handling of Biomarker and 
Optional Exploratory Research has details regarding tumor material at Time of Disease Progression).

Survival Follow Up (OS)
After disease progression or if a subject stops treatment and declines further study 
radiographic assessments prior to the endpoint of disease progression, the subject enters the Survival Follow Up period.  During this period, the subject will be followed every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (dates and responses), and survival status until the endpoint of death, the subject becomes lost to follow-up, termination of the study by [CONTACT_26282], or until [ADDRESS_104508] withdraws from study follow-up, the study staff may use a public information source (such as county records) to obtain information about survival status only, as appropriate per local regulations.  Refer to Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities 
Tables for details of required assessments.
[IP_ADDRESS] Collection and Handling of Biomarker and/or Optional 
Exploratory Research Samples
Biomarker Samples
Blood, tumor material, and serosal fluid will be collected as noted in Appendix C and 
Appendix D , Study Activities Tables and may be utilized to evaluate known and/or novel 
markers (nucleic acids, peptides/proteins and/or metabolites) of disease status, related 
conditions or to evaluate the association with pharmacokinetics, safety or efficacy.  The biomarker rationale is discussed in the Biomarker Research Variables Section (Section 5.3.6).
All biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study-specific laboratory manual.
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the samples in a secure 
storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples may be retained while research on rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (or drugs of this class) or this disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than [ADDRESS_104509] 2016-003726-17
53
Tumor Material at Screening
Archived or fresh tumor material remaining after DLL3 IHC testing may be utilized for 
various biomarkers such as DLL3 expression by [CONTACT_94507], routine hematoxylin and eosin for morphology, IHC for confirmation of diagnosis (e.g., for synaptophysin, chromogranin-A, or CD56), or scoring of immune infiltrates (e.g., IHC for CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and Foxp3+ cells).  Tumor material may also be utilized for exploratory research that includes assessments of nucleic acid or protein based biomarkers of drug sensitivity, resistance, or disease biology and development of a companion diagnostic assay.
Blood (Plasma) for Inflammatory Markers and Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA)
At the indicated times noted in Appendix C , Study Activities, blood will be collected, 
processed to plasma for testing of inflammatory markers including erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antinuclear antibodies (ANA), rheumatoid factor (RF) and ctDNA.  Samples will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre-infusion).
Blood (Serum) for Tumor and Soluble Markers
At the indicated times noted in Appendix C , Study Activities, blood will be collected, 
processed as serum for possible testing of tumor-specific biomarkers that may reflect 
disease burden such as but not necessarily limited to neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and biomarkers that may be related to the pharmacodynamics effects of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94413]3, circulating chemokines, or cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), epi[INVESTIGATOR_5169] (EGF), interleukin (IL)-6, or IL-8.  Other biomarkers based on emerging science may also be assessed.  Samples will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 (pre-infusion).
Blood for Circulating Tumor Cells
At the indicated times noted in Appendix C and Appendix D , Study Activities, blood 
samples will be collected for assessment and characterization of circulating tumor cells 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104510] 2016-003726-17

(CTCs) as a possible reflection of disease burden and DLL3 expression.  Whole blood 
sample will be collected for CTC analysis during screening, and pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1.
Serosal Fluid
Any pericardial, pleural, and/or ascitic fluid collected as part of routine care (e.g., as part 
of a therapeutic thoracentesis, pericardiocentesis, or paracentesis) must be procured for possible PK, pharmacodynamic, and/or biomarker testing.  See the laboratory manual for additional details.
Pharmacogenetic Samples
Whole blood samples for DNA and RNA isolation will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 
(pre-infusion) (–3 business days window is permitted) from each subject.  
Pharmacogenetic samples should be collected at both timepoints unless precluded by [CONTACT_94508].
Samples will be shipped frozen to [COMPANY_013] or a designated laboratory for long-term 
storage.  Instructions for the preparation and shipment of the pharmacogenetic samples will be provided in a laboratory manual.
Optional Exploratory Research Samples
Subjects will have the option to provide samples for exploratory research.  Subjects may 
still participate in the main study even if they decide not to participate in this optional exploratory research.
[COMPANY_013] (or people or companies working with [COMPANY_013]) will store the exploratory 
research samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  The samples will be retained while research on rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007] (or drugs of this class) or this disease and related conditions continues, but for no longer than [ADDRESS_104511] 2016-003726-17

In cases of treatment delays of > [ADDRESS_104532] will be discontinued from treatment.  In cases where treatment benefit is observed, longer dose delays due to toxicity, if required, can be discussed with the TAMD.  
For subjects in Arm A, in the event of isolated CNS progression during Cycle 1 (see 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), Cycle [ADDRESS_104533] may be administered no sooner 
than 1 week after the completion of CNS disease-directed local therapy.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Dose Reduction Guidelines (Arm A, Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94439])
Investigational product dose reductions and discontinuation of investigational product for 
specific toxicities should occur as outlined in Table [ADDRESS_104534] (IP) and Table 6, Dose Reductions and 
Discontinuation for Unacceptable Toxicities.  Dose reductions for unacceptable toxicities described in Table 6 are mandatory.  Reduced dose levels are described in ( Table 5).  
Generally, if an unacceptable toxicity recurs after two dose reductions, treatment will be discontinued (for further details, refer to Table 6 ).  If the investigational product dose is 
reduced, no re-escalation will be allowed.  If different unacceptable toxicities occur in sequential treatment cycles (e.g., Grade [ADDRESS_104535] dose and Grade 3 thrombocytopenia lasting more than 7 days after the second dose), dose reduction will proceed to the next lower dose level.  If different unacceptable toxicities occur within one cycle, maximum specified dose reduction will be implemented.  Dose reductions and discontinuation are not allowed for dexamethasone.  If the full dose of dexamethasone cannot be administered due to an AE, the rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94440].

This is an open-label study where subjects will be randomized in a 2:[ADDRESS_104542] of care in this tumor type.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
In a recent Phase 1 study (Study SCRX16-001) with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007], the 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was established at 0.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks based on the incidence of Cycle 1 toxicities, while the recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) in SCLC was chosen as 0.3 mg/kg every 6 weeks for a total of two doses with the allowance to retreat at the same dose level and schedule upon progression.  The RPTD is based on the toxicity and efficacy profile during multiple cycles of dosing ([COMPANY_013] Stemcentrx data on file).
The chosen dose regimen, two doses of 0.3 mg/kg rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94448] 
6 weeks apart, is based on the safety and efficacy observed in Study SCRX16-001, where delayed and/or cumulative toxicities were observed with both q3wk and q6wk schedules and appeared to be related to total dose administered.  The dosing regimens of 0.2 mg/kg q3wk for a total of 3 doses (q3wk × 3) and 0.3 mg/kg q6wk for a total of 2 doses (q6wk × 2) were evaluated in expansion cohorts.
Both regimens were tolerated, but the 0.3 mg/kg q 6wk regimen demonstrated a trend 
towards lower rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAE), related TEAEs, Grade 3/4 TEAEs and related Grade 3/4 TEAEs.  In addition, although the 0.3 mg/kg regimen appeared to have a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, this AE was generally clinically manageable.  On the other hand, objective responses appear to be more durable in subjects treated with the 0.3 mg/kg q6wk regimen based on preliminary data.  Therefore, 0.3 mg/kg q6wk × 2 is the chosen dose regimen for this study.  The maximum dose of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94449] 0.3 mg/kg at each dose.

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, [meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.8 regarding toxicity 
management)] and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within [ADDRESS_104547]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events Expected Due to SCLC or Progression of 
SCLC
Adverse events that may be expected from primary SCLC lesions, compression of 
adjacent thoracic structures or distant metastases are presented in Appendix K, Adverse 
Events Expected Due to SCLC or Progression of SCLC of the protocol.
These adverse events may occur alone or in various combinations and are considered 
expected adverse events for regulatory reporting in SCLC subjects for this protocol.
The term "disease progression" should not be used when reporting AEs or SAEs, instead 
associated symptoms should be reported.  However, in cases of fatal events clearly related to the progression of disease under study the terms "malignant neoplasm progression" or "disease progression" are acceptable when the immediate cause of death is not known.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.0).
[ADDRESS_104549] the change in severity.
When CTCAE criteria cannot be used, the event should be graded as defined below:
Grade [ADDRESS_104550] (mild).
Grade [ADDRESS_104551]'s usual activities (moderate).
Grade 3/[ADDRESS_104552]'s usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening (severe). 
Grade [ADDRESS_104553] (severe).

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causality or deemed it not assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], an "Other" cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_26278].
6.1.4 Deaths
For SAEs with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be recorded on the 
appropriate case report form.
Deaths that occur during the protocol specified AE reporting period (Section 6.1.6) that 
are more likely related to disease progression will therefore be considered as an expected 
SAE and will not be subject to expedited reporting.  These events should be recorded on the AE eCRF as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  After the AE reporting period, deaths 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104555] event.  The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the AE eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be reported.  The term "sudden death" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre-existing heart disease, within [ADDRESS_104556] seen alive and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death" should be recorded on the AE eCRF.  If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by [CONTACT_25749].

6.1.6 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by [CONTACT_26280] (EDC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site having access to the RAVE
®system, or if RAVE is not operable, should be documented 
on the SAE Non-CRF forms and emailed (preferred route) or faxed to Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

[ADDRESS_104564] administration, then dose interruptions/holds with possible modifications as described below may be implemented.  Adjustments to these guidelines may occur based on the clinical judgment of the investigator with notification to the TA MD.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Serosal Effusions/Serositis
Serosal effusions (pleural or pericardial, or ascites) have been observed with 
rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94452]-threatening (e.g., cardiac tamponade).  Therefore, development of any of these events or worsening from baseline warrants prompt evaluation by [CONTACT_1719].  Alternative causes such as infection, congestive heart failure, or disease progression, should be ruled out.  When appropriate, a unifying diagnosis should be reported, e.g., "heart failure," not the signs and symptoms "pleural effusion" and "edema limbs."
When considered clinically significant (e.g., Grade [ADDRESS_104565]):
●Systemic corticosteroids, when initiated promptly, have been reported to be 
beneficial in some prior cases.  The investigator should consider a tapering 
regimen, such as dexamethasone up to 8 mg orally twice a day for 5 days, followed by 4 mg orally twice a day for 5 days, then 2 mg orally twice a day 
for 5 days.  Alternatively, nonsteroidal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_94453], such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, e.g., ibuprofen 400 – 600 mg orally three to four times daily) or colchicine 
(e.g., 0.6 mg orally two to three times daily) given for 1 – 2 weeks.
●Until clinical experience suggests otherwise, guidance for dose delay and/or 
reduction, as well as criteria for ongoing dosing, should follow Section [IP_ADDRESS]

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Skin Reactions
All cutaneous reactions which develop during treatment warrant prompt evaluation.  Skin 
toxicity with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94454]-plantar erythrodysesthesia or erythema multiforme.  As such, development of a cutaneous reaction during treatment warrants prompt evaluation by [CONTACT_1719].
Photosensitivity reactions may occur hours to days after sun exposure.  Patients should be 
advised to avoid direct and indirect sun exposure as much as possible from Cycle [ADDRESS_104567]-spectrum sunscreen and lip balm (SPF 30 or greater). 31 – [ADDRESS_104568] brimmed hat, protective clothing and sunscreen SPF 30 or higher
If clinically consistent with photosensitivity, the AE should be reported as such (using 
medically accurate and descriptive AE terminology), and managed as described in Table 7.  Photodocumentation of skin toxicity should be available upon request by [CONTACT_94524].  The investigative site will take measures to protect the identity of the patient.  These measures include taking the photograph very close to the affected skin region to exclude facial features, or if facial features cannot be excluded due to the location of the skin reaction, covering identifying features (such as the eyes) with a black rectangle.
Formal evaluation by a dermatologist, including possible skin biopsy, to rule out 
alternative etiologies such as erythema multiforme (which may warrant discontinuation of investigational product) and to facilitate the most appropriate terminology for AE reporting, is recommended.
All events of cutaneous toxicity should be monitored until resolution or return to baseline.  
Recommendations for management of photosensitivity reactions are outlined in Table 7.

Once a final dermatological diagnosis is verified, the AE eCRF should be updated to reflect the specific diagnosis.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Potential Drug-Induced Liver Injury
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of initial liver-related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) event.  All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs.
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104570] 2016-003726-17
87
A potential DILI is defined as:
●ALT or AST elevation > 3 times (3×) upper limit of normal (ULN) and
●Total bilirubin > 2 × ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated 
serum alkaline phosphatase) and
●No other immediately apparent possible causes of aminotransferase (AT) 
elevation and hyperbilirubinemia including but not limited to viral hepatitis, 
pre-existing chronic or acute liver disease or tumor(s), or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic
In general, an increase of AT to > 3 × ULN should be followed by [CONTACT_94525] 48 
– 72 hours of all four of the usual measures (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) to confirm the abnormalities and to determine if they are increasing or decreasing.  An inquiry regarding symptoms should also be made (e.g., fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash).  Subjects may be retested locally, but normal laboratory ranges should be recorded and results made available to the investigator immediately.  All data must be recorded in the CRF.  If symptoms persist or repeat testing shows AT > 3 × ULN for subjects with normal baseline measures or 2-fold increases above baseline values for subjects with elevated values before drug exposure, close observation should be initiated.  If close monitoring is not possible, investigational product should be discontinued.
Close observation includes:
●Repeating liver enzyme and serum bilirubin tests two or three times weekly.  
Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or less if abnormalities stabilize or the trial drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomatic.
●Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent 
diseases
●Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and special diets
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104571] 2016-003726-17
88
●Ruling out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or 
alcoholic hepatitis; non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); hypoxic/ischemic 
hepatopathy; and biliary tract disease
●Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents
●Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver function, as appropriate (e.g., international normalized ratio [INR], direct bilirubin)
●Considering gastroenterology or hepatology consultations
The investigational product will be discontinued if potential DILI is suspected and:
●ALT or AST > 8 × ULN
●ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and (TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5)
●ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia
All subjects showing possible DILI should be followed until all abnormalities return to 
normal or to the baseline state.
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring and Management of Edema
The majority of the edema events with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94456] 1 or 2 (mild or moderate); however, a small number of fatal events of generalized edema have been reported with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_33007].  Physical exams and monitoring of weight gain and signs or symptoms of fluid retention should be conducted during treatment.
Consistent with institutional guidelines or standard practice, the use of diuretics with or 
without albumin may be considered in subjects with clinically significant edema and hypoalbuminemia.  The selection and use of diuretics in subjects should be based on individual clinical characteristics and include monitoring of electrolyte status and signs or symptoms of intravascular volume depletion such as hypotension and impaired renal function.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pneumonitis
Pneumonitis has been infrequently reported with rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94458].  Although the causal role of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94459], the reports of pneumonitis had one or more confounders including underlying pulmonary disease/cancer, prior thoracic radiation, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or clinical evidence suggestive of an alternative diagnosis including pneumonia. 
Heavily pretreated SCLC patients and patients with a history of pneumonitis may be at 
increased risk, and careful monitoring for signs and symptoms of pneumonitis is important.  The risk of pneumonitis is increased with prior radiation to lung.
In general, signs and symptoms coinciding with or preceding pneumonitis may include 
new or worsening cough, chest pain and/or shortness of breath, fever, and radiographic changes (reticular markings, ground glass opacities).  Protocol defined disease assessments providethe opportunity for on study pulmonary monitoring with "gold standard" diagnostic method for detection of pneumonitis.  The protocol allows for additional imaging per physician discretion for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity.
The diagnosis of drug induced pneumonitis is one of exclusion.  Other etiologies 
including infection, which is a common cause of pulmonary infiltrates with clinical and radiographic appearance similar to drug-induced pneumonitis, need to be carefully considered and excluded before the diagnosis of drug induced pneumonitis can be established. 
If pneumonitis is suspected, close monitoring including additional laboratory and imaging 
investigation per institutional guidelines may be necessary.  Systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_94460].  For events of Grade 1 pneumonitis close monitoring is recommended; while dose modifications for Grade 2 or discontinuation of Rova-T for Grades 3 and 4 are required, please see Section [IP_ADDRESS] of 
the protocol.

8.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
This section describes the planned statistical analyses to be performed using data captured 
according to this protocol.  A complete statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing in more detail all planned analyses will be finalized prior to database lock.
The final analysis will be performed when at least [ADDRESS_104579] occurred, which is 
projected to be approximately 35 months after study initiation.
The following analysis populations are considered:
●Randomized Set:   It includes all randomized subjects, with subjects grouped 
according the treatment arm to which they are randomized regardless the 
actual treatment received, following intent-to-treat principle.  The randomized set will be the analysis set for the efficacy endpoints.
●Per Protocol Set:   It includes all subjects in the randomized set without any 
major protocol violations which may affect the evaluation of the primary efficacy endpoint.  Major protocol violations will be defined in the SAP prior 
to the database lock.  Subjects will be classified according to treatment 
assigned at the time of randomization.  This set will be used for supportive analysis of efficacy endpoints.
●Safety Set:   It includes all subjects who received at least one dose of study 
drug and subjects will be classified according to treatment received.
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]

●Pharmacokinetic-Evaluable Set:   It consists of all subjects who receive at 
least one dose of study drug, with subjects classified according to the actual 
treatment received.  A baseline measurement and at least one blood sample following a dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in this analysis.
8.1.[ADDRESS_104581] disposition includes the number of subjects for whom study drug was permanently discontinued (including the reasons for discontinuation), and the number of subjects who discontinued early from the study.

8.1.4 Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analysis
Overall survival (OS) is the primary efficacy endpoint.  OS is defined as the time from the 
date of randomization to the date of death from any cause (i.e., date of subject's death –date of randomization + 1).  For subjects who are alive at the time of analysis, the data will be censored at the last date they were documented to be alive.  Subjects with no post-baseline information will be censored at the date of randomization plus [ADDRESS_104583], stratified by [CONTACT_94487], testing the null hypothesis (rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94373] (Arm A) is not superior to topotecan arm

(Arm B) in OS).  The hazard ratio (HR) of Arm A over Arm B will be estimated using a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model.  The OS curves for each arm will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) product-limit method.  Two-sided, 95% confidence interval for median OS will be computed.  Landmark survival rate, defined as the survival rate estimated using the Kaplan-Meier approach at pre-defined timepoints from randomization (e.g., 6, 12 and 18 months), will be summarized, presenting two-sided 95% CIs.
8.1.5 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
●Progression-free survival (PFS) based on the CRAC per RECIST v1.1
●Patient reported outcomes (PROs) – physical functioning domain at C2D1 for 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94378] C3D1 for topotecan arm
●Objective response rate (ORR:  CR + PR) based on the CRAC per RECIST 
v1.1
●Clinical benefit rate (CBR:  CR + PR + SD) based on the CRAC per RECIST 
v1.1
●Duration of objective response (DOR) based on the CRAC per RECIST v1.[ADDRESS_104585] v1.1 or death from any cause (whichever occurs earlier).  For the analysis of PFS, data for subjects without disease progression or death will be censored at the time of the last radiographic assessment (or, if no radiographic assessment was performed after the baseline visit, subject's data will be censored at the time of randomization plus 1 day).  Data from subjects who are lost to follow-up will be included in the analysis as censored observations on the last date of radiographic assessment that the subject was documented to be progression free.  The PFS rates at 6 and 12 months and corresponding 95% CIs will also be estimated using KM estimates on the PFS curve for each arm.  Methods for PFS analysis are similar to those described for the OS endpoint.

Analyses of ORR and CBR will be performed for the randomized subjects with at least 
one measureable disease at baseline.  For subjects whose tumors meet the criteria of partial or complete response (PR or CR), tumor measurements must be confirmed by [CONTACT_74324] [ADDRESS_104587] met.
Objective response rate includes confirmed complete response (CR) and confirmed partial 
response (PR) assessed by [CONTACT_94531] v1.[ADDRESS_104588]-baseline radiological assessments will be considered as non-responder.  
Comparison of ORR will be carried out using a one-sided Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) test, stratified by [CONTACT_94487].  Odds ratio will be presented with two-sided 95% CI.  The difference in ORR will be provided with two-sided 95% CI.  Rates and corresponding 95% exact CI will be calculated by [CONTACT_94532]-Pearson method for each arm.  Sensitivity analysis based on investigator-determined ORR will also be performed. 
Clinical benefit includes complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable 
disease (SD) assessed by [CONTACT_94531] v1.[ADDRESS_104589] 2016-003726-17

A sensitivity analysis of ORR and CBR will be performed, accounting for subjects who 
initiated a new anti-cancer therapy.  Modified endpoints of ORR and CBR, defined as rates of response from the date of randomization until initiation of new anti-cancer therapy/procedure, disease progression, or death, whichever comes first, will be analyzed using the same methodology as that for the endpoints of ORR and CBR.
Only subjects with an objective response will be included in the analysis of duration of 
response (DOR).  DOR is defined as the time between the date of first response (CR or PR by [CONTACT_94533], whichever is recorded first) to the date of the first documented tumor progression (assessed by [CONTACT_94534] 1.1) or death due to any cause, whichever comes first.  If a subject is still responding (i.e., has not progressed nor died after CR or PR), then the subject's data will be censored at date of the last radiographic assessment by [CONTACT_94533].  Methods for DOR analysis are similar to those described for the OS endpoint. 
8.1.6 Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)
The EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL/LC13 scoring manual will be used to transform the raw 
scores into the domain scores (global heath, functional scales, symptom scales/items).  Physical functioning domain of the QLQ-C15-PAL PRO questionnaire is a secondary endpoint in the hypothesis testing hierarchy (see Section 8.3).  The other scales will be 
analyzed on an exploratory basis.  Change from baseline of the items and domains of the QLQ-C15-PAL/LC13 will be summarized by [CONTACT_94535].  The EQ-5D-5L manual and 
the published weights will be used to convert the individual items to the utility scores.  Change from baseline of the EQ-5D-5L utility score and VAS will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939].  
Treatment group differences will be evaluated by [CONTACT_94536] a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model.  Proportion of subjects with clinically meaningful worsening in physical functioning will be compared between the treatment arms.

8.1.7 Pharmacokinetic and Exposure-Response Analyses
Serum concentrations of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94461].  Serum concentration and ATA data from this study may be combined with data from other studies and analyzed using population pharmacokinetic methodologies.
The relationship between pharmacokinetics (e.g., exposure) and clinical trial findings 
including, but not limited to demographics, efficacy, and/or safety measures may also be explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful.  Results of the population pharmacokinetic and exposure-response analyses will be provided in a separate report.
8.1.8 Planned Sensitivity and Subgroup Analyses
Analysis of OS will be performed in the per protocol set.  The same methodology as for 
analyses specified in Section 8.1.4 will be applied.
For randomized subjects, analysis for OS will be performed in the following subgroups:
●Prior history of brain metastases (yes versus no)
○PCI (yes vs no) in subjects with no prior history of brain metastases
●Sensitivity to first line platinum-based regimen (sensitive [OR/SD after 
first line therapy and progression/recurrence-free interval ≥ 90 days] versus 
refractory/resistant [PD as best response to or < 90 days progression/recurrence-free interval after first line therapy])
●LDH (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) at Screening
●Overall VALG stage (Limited Disease vs Extensive Disease) at initial diagnosis
●Gender
●Race
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104591] ratios will be calculated by a Cox's model.  
8.2 Safety Analyses
Safety endpoints will be summarized using data from the Safety set.  Safety analyses will 
involve examination of the incidence, severity, and type of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported, changes in vital signs and laboratory test results from baseline (the assessment prior to first dose) to specified time points throughout the study, and concomitant medications used.  NCI CTCAE version 4.0 will be used in the grading of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities that are reported as adverse events.
8.2.1 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)
TEAEs reported during the study will be coded using a MedDRA
12dictionary.  Incidence 
of TEAEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_94537]:
●System organ class and preferred term
●System organ class, preferred term, and severity
These summaries will be presented for the following subsets:
●Serious TEAEs
●All TEAEs
●Drug-related TEAEs
For tables reporting AEs by [CONTACT_926], if a subject has multiple occurrences of an AE with 
the same organ class and preferred term, the most severe event will be presented.
8.2.[ADDRESS_104592]-baseline score may be tabulated.
8.2.5 Electrocardiogram
ECG status will be summarized for each scheduled visit by [CONTACT_2939].  Shifts from 
baseline may be tabulated.
8.2.6 Concomitant Medications
Concomitant medications will be classified according to the anatomical therapeutic 
chemical (ATC) codes in the World Health Organization Drug (WHODRUG) dictionary.  The incidence rate of each coded concomitant medication will be tabulated by [CONTACT_2939].  The table will be sorted by [CONTACT_94538].
8.3 Type I Error Adjustment Procedure for Multiple Testing
To meet global regulatory requirements, a multiple testing strategy will be implemented to 
control the family-wise type I error (alpha) for comparisons of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94462].

The following null hypotheses are considered:
H1:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94375].H2:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94463].H3:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94464] C2D1 for rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94378] C3D1 for topotecan arm.
H4:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94465].H5:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94466].H6:  Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94467].The family of null hypotheses will be tested using a hierarchical procedure, ie, in a fixed 
sequence of {H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6}.  Hypothesis H1 will be tested first, and no further tests will be performed if H1 is not rejected.  Thereafter, each hypothesis will be tested in the order specified if and only if H1 and all preceding null hypotheses are rejected.  Otherwise testing in the hierarchical sequence will stop.  All the testing at final analysis will be carried out at one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_104594] 2016-003726-17

(Arm A) or topotecan (Arm B) in a 2:1 ratio.  It is assumed that median overall survival in 
the topotecan arm (Arm B) will be around 6.[ADDRESS_104595], at a one-sided significance level of 0.025 and a power of 85%, a total of [ADDRESS_104596] an increase in median OS to 8.67 months in rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94373] (Arm A), corresponding to a hazard ratio of 0.75 (i.e., a reduction in the hazard death of 25%).  It is projected that an observed hazard ratio of 0.829 or less, corresponding to 1.34 months or greater improvement in median OS, would result in statistically significance in the final analysis of OS.  
8.5 Interim Analysis
No interim efficacy analysis is planned.  
8.6 Accrual/Study Duration Considerations
The total study duration and accrual duration are approximately projected to be 35 months 
and 24 months, respectively.  A total of 600 subjects are expected to enroll during the accrual period.
8.7 Randomization Methods
The randomization numbers of the study will assign to subjects in a 2:1 ratio to either 
receive 0.3 mg/kg rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94468].  Randomization will be stratified as follows: 
●prior history of brain metastases (yes versus no), 
●prior PCI (yes vs. no) for subjects with no prior history of brain metastases
●sensitivity to first line platinum-based regimen [sensitive (OR/SD after 
first line therapy and progression/recurrence-free interval ≥ 90 days) versus 
refractory/resistant (PD as best response to or < 90 days progression/recurrence-free interval after first line therapy)],
●LDH level (> ULN vs. ≤ ULN) at screening.

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and any other necessary documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval prior to implementation 
of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP and all other applicable regulatory requirements.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by [CONTACT_13125], will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by [CONTACT_427].  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by [CONTACT_427]) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].
9.[ADDRESS_104598] of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A .
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104599] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
Informed consent will be obtained for treatment post radiologic disease progression, and 
consent form should be signed at the time of progressive disease if treatment is to be continued (Arm A).
The tumor biopsy at the time of disease progression is an optional research sample and 
will only be performed if the subject has voluntarily signed and dated an informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  If the subject does not consent to the optional tumor biopsy at the time of disease progression, it will not impact the subject's participation in the study.  In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, stored biomarker and tumor material for exploratory research will continue to be used for research and analysis.  In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request that their samples be withdrawn.  Once [COMPANY_013] receives the request, remaining biomarker and tumor material for exploratory research will be destroyed.  If the subject changes his/her consent, and the

doses of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94473] [ADDRESS_104617] PTFU visit will oc cur at 6 weeks (± 1 week) after the last 
Disease/Response Assessment, then every 6 weeks (± 1 week) until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.
d. Subjects will be followed for subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (dates and responses), as well as survival status, every 6 wee ks* (± 1 week) until the endpoint of death, the 
subject becomes lost to follow-up or withdraws consent, or termination of the study by [CONTACT_26282], whichever occurs first (*or as r equested by [CONTACT_94542]).
e. Procedures performed at Screening (with the exception of vital signs) do not need to be repeated if performed within 28 days of randomization unless clinically indicated. 
Randomization may occur within 3 calendar days prior to C1D1.  Starting at C2D1, study assessments for Day 1 visits may be perf ormed within 3 business days prior to the 
visit.  Disease/Response Assessment may be performed within [ADDRESS_104618]'s legally acceptable representative before any study -specific procedures are undertaken or before any 
prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study.  Informed consent may be obtained be fore the 28-day screening window for DLL3 
testing.
g. Medical and Surgical History includes demographics and documentation of clinically significant medical condition, surgical hi story, and malignancy history.
h. Height will be collected at the Screening visit only.  For height assessments, the subject should not wear shoes.  The physical examination performed at screening does not 
need to be repeated on CID1 if performed within 7 days of C1D1.
i. Vital signs include weight, sitting blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature.  Weight will be collected in the clinic prior to dosing at each cycle and the recorded actual 
weight will be utilized for dosing calculations.  If possible, blood pressure and heart rate measurements should not immediatel y follow scheduled blood collections.  Vital 
signs should be collected prior to the infusion (including C1D1).
j. All laboratory samples will be assessed using a certified central laboratory.  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditat ion) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory 
analyses for treatment decisions as per standard of care.  Refer to Table [ADDRESS_104619] dose of study drug.  Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile as defined in Section 5.2.4 ) at Screening do 
not require pregnancy testing.  Post-menopausal female subjects ≤  [ADDRESS_104620] a FSH level > 40 IU/L and will have FSH performed at Screening and assessed 
by [CONTACT_093].
m. A resting 12-lead ECG will consist of a single 12-lead study performed within a 5-minute window after at least [ADDRESS_104621] 2016-003726-17

n. Echocardiograms are required at Screening, Day 1 of each cycle starting C2D1, and EOT.  Screening echocardiogram will be perfo rmed within 3 business days of 
randomization to assess for the presence of any pericardial effusion as well as cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF).  Subsequent echocardiograms should 
be performed within –3 business days of dosing visit to assess for the presence of any pericardial effusion.  Additional echoca rdiogram monitoring may occur as clinically 
indicated during the study.
o. Subjects will be asked about the development of any new or worsening peripheral edema or dyspnea ( Appendix J , Fluid Retention Questionnaire).  The assessments on 
Days 8, 15, 29, and [ADDRESS_104622] and reviewing the questionnaire.  Starting Day 1 (during the treatment period for Arm A) 
and through the EOT visit, subjects will maintain a diary of daily weights (captured on the Fluid Retention Questionnaire).  
p. Collection of SAE/AE and Concomitant Medications may be required at this visit in order to meet the collection window require ment of Day [ADDRESS_104623] treatment.  Any ongoing SAE/AE that require appropriate standard of care should also be conducted.  
q. Diagnostic quality, spi[INVESTIGATOR_94408]; other CT methods or MRI may be used if performed consistently throughout the study for each individual subject.  
Scans of the chest and abdomen must be obtained; scans of the neck and pelvis must also be obtained if there is documented or su spected involvement in these regions.  
Screening scans may be performed within [ADDRESS_104624] v1.1.  Effusion (pleural, pericardial, and etc.) assessments will be performed by a radiologist at each radiographical assessment and any new findings communicated to the Investigator prior to the next dose of investigational product.  Effusions should contribute to disease status only if confirmed malignant by [CONTACT_3973].  Scheduled tumor assessments will not be affected by [CONTACT_94503]/or drug holidays.  Subjects will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_94543].
r. May be omitted if assessment was performed within the preceding 6 weeks.
s. Radiographic assessments will occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 30 weeks then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) until progr ession or death.  If the subject qualifies to 
receive [ADDRESS_104625] 30 weeks and  then every 9 weeks until second progression 
or death.
t. MRI/CT of the brain is required at screening.  Subsequent MRI/CT of the brain post screening is required only when clinically  indicated (e.g., CNS metastasis history and if 
CNS progression is suspected).
u. PRO assessments are required at Screening and before infusion on C1D1. 
v. At each cycle, approximately 6 mL of blood will be collected by [CONTACT_94510] (PK), Anti-therapeutic antib ody (ATA), and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) 
testing.  The pre-infusion sample will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 (–3 business days window is permitted) and the seco nd sample will be collected 30 minutes 
(± 10 minutes) post-infusion.  Only one collection will be required at the EOT visit.  The date and time of each sample collected  will be recorded to the nearest minute.
w. Tumor material must be collected to confirm DLL3 expression.  Subjects that provide consent for DLL3 testing at any time afte r initial diagnosis must be registered in IRT. 
x. An optional tumor biopsy may be obtained at the time of disease progression, from subjects who consent to undergo biopsy proc edure.  Informed consent is required for the 
optional tumor biopsy at time of disease progression.  The sample can be collected at the EOT or at the time of disease progres sion
y. On Cycle 1 Day 1 (–3 business days window is permitted), the collection of blood for inflammatory markers, ctDNA, tumor and s oluble markers will be pre-infusion.

Appendix H. Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECIST) v 1.[ADDRESS_104647] (version 1.1).[ADDRESS_104648] (version 1.1).  Measurable disease is defined by [CONTACT_12155].  If the measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by [CONTACT_3973]/histology if possible.
Measurability
Measurable Lesions Lesions accurately measured in at least one dimension with a 
minimum size of:
•Longest diameter ≥ 10 mm (CT scan slice thickness no 
greater than 5 mm)
•10 mm caliper measurement by [CONTACT_26304]-Measurable LesionsAll other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter 
< 10 mm) as well as truly non-measurable lesions.  Lesions 
considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory 
breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung and 
also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by [CONTACT_15218].
Measurable Malignant Lymph NodesTo be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥  [ADDRESS_104649] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no 
greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the 
short axis will be measured and followed.
Non-Measurable 
Malignant Lymph 
NodesPathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < [ADDRESS_104650] 2016-003726-17
132
Special 
Considerations 
Regarding Lesion 
MeasurabilityBone lesions
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic-blastic lesions, with 
identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by 
[CONTACT_26305]/CT can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above.
Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable.
Cystic lesions
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined 
simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by [CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
'Cystic lesions' thought to represent cystic metastases can be 
considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.
However, if non-cystic lesions are present in the same subject, 
these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Lesions with prior local treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an 
area subjected to other loco-regional therapy, are usually not 
considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion.
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using calipers if 
clinically assessed.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and not more than 28 days before randomization.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize 
each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥ [ADDRESS_104651] or MRI should be made based upon discussion with the [COMPANY_013] medical monitor.
For accurate objective response evaluation, ultrasound (US) should not be used to 
measure tumor lesions.
The utilization of endoscopy and laparoscopy for objective tumor evaluation is not 
advised.  However, such techniques can be useful in confirming complete pathological response when biopsies are obtained.
Cytology and histology can be used to differentiate between partial response (PR) and 
complete response (CR) in rare cases.
Baseline Documentation of "Target" and "Non-Target" Lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104652] meet the criterion of a short axis of ≥ [ADDRESS_104653] in which the image is obtained (for CT scan this is almost always the axial plane).  The smaller of these measures is the short axis.  For example, an abdominal node which is reported as being 20 mm × 30 mm has a short axis of 20 mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurable node.  In this example, 20 mm should be recorded as the node measurement.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis ≥10 mm but < 15 mm) should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short 
axis < [ADDRESS_104654] diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as 
the baseline sum LD.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then as noted above, only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by [CONTACT_14218].
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence (stable, increasing or decreasing) or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-up.
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):
The disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to < [ADDRESS_104655] 2016-003726-17
135
Partial Response (PR):
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the 
baseline sum diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD):
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the 
smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started (baseline or after) or the appearance of one or more new lesions.  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
Stable Disease (SD):
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started (baseline or after).
Assessment of Target Lesions:
Lymph nodes identified as target lesions should always have the actual short axis 
measurement recorded (measured in the same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10 mm on study.  This means that when lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the 'sum' of lesions may not be zero even if complete response criteria are met, since a normal lymph node is defined as having a short axis of < 10 mm.  For PR, SD and PD, the actual short axis measurement of the nodes is to be included in the sum of target lesions.
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual 
measurements recorded at each subsequent evaluation, even when very small (< 5 mm).  However, sometimes target lesions or lymph nodes become too small to measure.  If it is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_26191], the measurement should be recorded as 0 mm.  If the lesion is believed to be present, but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned (as derived from the [ADDRESS_104656] slice thickness).  The measurement of these lesions is potentially non-reproducible; therefore 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104657] 2016-003726-17

providing this default value will prevent false responses or progression based upon 
measurement error.
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):
The disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non-PD:
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD):
Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.
In this setting, to achieve 'unequivocal progression' on the basis of non-target disease, 
there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of therapy.  A modest 'increase' in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually not sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status.  The designation of overall progression solely on the basis of change in non-target disease in the face of SD or PR of target disease will therefore be extremely rare.
New Lesions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression.  While there are no 
specific criteria for the identification of new radiographic lesions, the findings of a new lesion should be unequivocal; i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, timing of scanning, phase of contrast administration, change in imaging modality or finding thought to represent something other than tumor (e.g., some 'new' bone lesions may be simply healing or flare of pre-existing lesions).  A lesion identified on a follow-up 
Rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94354]
M16-[ADDRESS_104658]'s brain metastases are considered evidence of progressive disease even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal (e.g., too small to measure), continued therapy and follow-up 
evaluation will clarify if it represents truly new disease.  If repeat scans confirm there is a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.

doses of rovalpi[INVESTIGATOR_94473] [ADDRESS_104693] PTFU visit will oc cur at 6 weeks (± 1 week) after the last 
Disease/Response Assessment, then every 6 weeks (± 1 week) until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.
d. Subjects will be followed for subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (dates and responses), as well as survival status, every 6 wee ks* (± 1 week) until the endpoint of death, the 
subject becomes lost to follow-up or withdraws consent, or termination of the study by [CONTACT_26282], whichever occurs first (*or as r equested by [CONTACT_94542]).
e. Procedures performed at Screening (with the exception of vital signs) do not need to be repeated if performed within 28 days of randomization unless clinically indicated. 
Randomization may occur within 3 calendar days prior to C1D1.  Starting at C2D1, study assessments for Day 1 visits may be perf ormed within 3 business days prior to the 
visit.  Disease/Response Assessment and CRAC Review may be performed within [ADDRESS_104694]'s legally acceptable representative before any study -specific procedures are undertaken or before any 
prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study.  Informed consent may be obtained be fore the 28-day screening window for DLL3 
testing.
g. Medical and Surgical History includes demographics and documentation of clinically significant medical condition, surgical hi story, and malignancy history.
h. Height will be collected at the Screening visit only.  For height assessments, the subject should not wear shoes.  The physic al examination performed at screening does not 
need to be repeated on CID1 if performed within 7 days of C1D1.
i. Vital signs include weight, sitting blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature.  Weight will be collected in the clinic prior to dosing at each cycle and the recorded actual 
weight will be utilized for dosing calculations.  If possible, blood pressure and heart rate measurements should not immediatel y follow scheduled blood collections.  Vital 
signs should be collected prior to the infusion (including C1D1).
j. All laboratory samples will be assessed using a certified central laboratory.  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditat ion) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory 
analyses for treatment decisions as per standard of care.  Refer to Table [ADDRESS_104695] dose of study drug.  Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile as defined in Section 5.2.4 ) at Screening do 
not require pregnancy testing.  Post-menopausal female subjects ≤  [ADDRESS_104696] a FSH level > 40 IU/L and will have FSH performed at Screening and assessed 
by [CONTACT_093].
m. A resting 12-lead ECG will consist of a single 12-lead study performed within a 5-minute window after at least [ADDRESS_104697] 2016-003726-17
164
n. Echocardiograms are required at Screening, Day 1 of each cycle starting C2D1, and EOT.  Screening echocardiogram will be perf ormed within 3 business days of 
randomization to assess for the presence of any pericardial effusion as well as cardiac function (left ventricular ejection frac tion, LVEF).  Subsequent echocardiograms should 
be performed within –3 business days of dosing visit to assess for the presence of any pericardial effusion.  Additional echoca rdiogram monitoring may occur as clinically 
indicated during the study.
o. Subjects will be asked about the development of any new or worsening peripheral edema or dyspnea ( Appendix J , Fluid Retention Questionnaire).  The assessments on 
Days 8, 15, 29, and [ADDRESS_104698] and reviewing the questionnaire.  Starting Day 1 (during the treatment period for Arm A) 
and through the EOT visit, subjects will maintain a diary of daily weights (captured on the Fluid Retention Questionnaire).  
p. Collection of SAE/AE and Concomitant Medications may be required at this visit in order to meet the collection window require ment of Day [ADDRESS_104699] treatment.  Any ongoing SAE/AE that require appropriate standard of care should also be conducted.  
q. Diagnostic quality, spi[INVESTIGATOR_94408]; other CT methods or MRI may be used if performed consistently throughout the study for each individual subject.  
Scans of the chest and abdomen must be obtained; scans of the neck and pelvis must also be obtained if there is documented or su spected involvement in these regions.  
Screening scans may be performed within [ADDRESS_104700] 
v1.1.  Effusion (pleural, pericardial, and etc.) assessments will be performed by a radiologist at each radiographical assessme nt and any new findings communicated to the 
Investigator prior to the next dose of investigational product.  Effusions should contribute to disease status only if confirme d malignant by [CONTACT_3973].  Scheduled tumor 
assessments will not be affected by [CONTACT_94503]/or drug holidays.  Subjects will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_94563].
r. May be omitted if assessment was performed within the preceding 6 weeks.
s. Radiographic assessments will occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 30 weeks then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) until progre ssion or death.  If the subject qualifies to 
receive [ADDRESS_104701]'s disease assessment.  u. MRI/CT of the brain is required at screening.  Subsequent MRI/CT of the brain post screening is required only when clinically indicated (e.g., CNS metastasis history and if 
CNS progression is suspected).
v. PRO assessments are required at Screening, before infusion on Day 1 of each cycle starting C2D1, Day 22 of each cycle, EOT, a nd PTFU (if applicable). 
w. At each cycle, approximately 6 mL of blood will be collected by [CONTACT_94510] (PK), Anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA), and neutralizing antibodies (nAb) 
testing.  The pre-infusion sample will be collected prior to dosing on Day 1 (–3 business days window is permitted) and the sec ond sample will be collected 30 minutes 
(± 10 minutes) post-infusion.  Only one collection will be required at the EOT visit.  The date and time of each sample collected  will be recorded to the nearest minute.
x. Tumor material must be collected to confirm DLL3 expression.  Subjects that provide consent for DLL3 testing at any time afte r initial diagnosis must be registered in IRT. 
y. An optional tumor biopsy may be obtained at the time of disease progression, from subjects who consent to undergo biopsy proc edure.  Informed consent is required for the 
optional tumor biopsy at time of disease progression.  The sample can be collected at the EOT or at the time of disease progres sion

z. On Day 1 (–3 business days window is permitted) of each cycle, the collection of blood for inflammatory markers, ctDNA, tumor  and soluble markers will be pre-infusion.  A 
sample will also be collected once at the EOT or at the time of disease progression.
aa. Whole blood sample will be collected for CTC analysis during screening and pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1 (if a pplicable).  –[ADDRESS_104703] e to be collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1 only and is 
collected pre-infusion (–3 business days window is permitted).
cc. Any pericardial, pleural, and/or ascitic fluid collected as part of routine care (e.g., as part of a therapeutic thoracentes is, pericardiocentesis, or paracentesis) must be procured 
for testing, for any AE starting from C1D1 through [ADDRESS_104704] also be tested centrally and/or locally for cytology if disease 
progression due to appearance/worsening of effusion is suspected.
dd. Procedures for visits where no treatment is administered and phone contacts from Day 8 to Day 36 of each cycle may be perfor med within ± 3 day window relative to the due 
date.  Procedures will include symptom review for presence of neurotoxicity, neutropenic colitis, fever, interstitial lung dise ase, serosal effusions (including pleural and

a. EOT Visit occurs within [ADDRESS_104724] PTFU visit will occ ur at 6 weeks (± 1 week) after the last 
Disease/Response Assessment, then every 6 weeks (± 1 week) until disease progression or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurs first.
c. Subjects will be followed for subsequent anti-cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (dates and responses), as well as survival status, every 6 wee ks* (± 1 week) until the endpoint of death, the 
subject becomes lost to follow-up or withdraws consent, or termination of the study by [CONTACT_26282], whichever occurs first (*or as r equested by [CONTACT_94542]).
d. Procedures performed at Screening (with the exception of vital signs) do not need to be repeated if performed within 28 days of randomization unless clinically indicated.  
Randomization may occur within 3 calendar days prior to C1D1.  Starting at C2D1, study assessments for Day 1 visits may be performed within 3 days prior to the visit.  
Disease/Response Assessment and CRAC Review may be performed within [ADDRESS_104725]'s legally acceptable representative before any study -specific procedures are undertaken or before any 
prohibited medications are withheld from the subject in order to participate in this study.  Informed consent may be obtained be fore the 28-day screening window.  Informed 
consent is also required for the optional tumor biopsy at time of disease progression.
f. Medical and Surgical History includes demographics and documentation of clinically significant medical condition, surgical hi story, and malignancy history.
g. Height will be collected at the Screening visit only.  For height assessments, the subject should not wear shoes.  The physic al examination performed at screening does not 
need to be repeated on CID1 if performed within [ADDRESS_104726] pr ior to dosing at each cycle and recorded actual 
weight will be utilized for dosing calculations.  If possible, blood pressure and heart rate measurements should not immediatel y follow scheduled blood collections.  Vital 
signs should be collected prior to the infusion (including C1D1).
i. All laboratory samples will be assessed using a certified central laboratory.  A qualified (e.g., certification or accreditat ion) local laboratory may be used to perform laboratory 
analyses for treatment decisions as per standard of care.  Refer to Table [ADDRESS_104727] dose of 
study drug.  Females of non-childbearing potential (either postmenopausal or permanently surgically sterile as defined in Secti on 5.2.4 ) at Screening do not require pregnancy 
testing.  Post-menopausal female subjects ≤  [ADDRESS_104728] a FSH level > 40 IU/L and will have FSH performed at Screening and assessed by [CONTACT_093].
l. A resting 12-lead ECG will consist of a single 12-lead study performed within a 5-minute window after at least [ADDRESS_104729] in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  Additional ECG 
monitoring may occur as clinically indicated during the study.
m. Screening echocardiogram will be performed within 3 business days of randomization and results should be available prior to r andomization to assess for the presence of any 
pericardial effusion as swell as cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF).  Echocardiogram will then be performed every 6 weeks at alternating cycles starting 
C2D1 (–3 business days window is permitted).  Additional Echocardiogram monitoring may occur as clinically indicated during the  study.
n. Subjects will be asked about the development of any new or worsening peripheral edema or dyspnea (Appendix J, Fluid Retention Questionnaire).  Assessments will occur 
Cycles 1 – 4.  On Days [ADDRESS_104730] and reviewing the que stionnaire.  Starting Day 1 and through the 
EOT visit, subjects will maintain a diary of daily weights (captured on the Fluid Retention Questionnaire).
o. Collection of SAE/AE and Concomitant Medications may be required at this visit in order to meet the collection window requirem ent of Day [ADDRESS_104731] treatment.  Any ongoing SAE/AE that require appropriate standard of care should also be conducted.
p. Diagnostic quality, spi[INVESTIGATOR_94408]; other CT methods or MRI may be used if performed consistently throughout  the study for each individual subject.  
Scans of the chest and abdomen must be obtained; scans of the neck and pelvis must also be obtained if there is documented or su spected involvement in these regions.  
Screening scans may be performed within [ADDRESS_104732] v1.1.  Effusion (pleural, pericardial, and etc.) assessments will be performed by a radiologist at each radiographical assessme nt and any new findings communicated to the 
Investigator prior to the next dose of investigational product.  Effusions should contribute to disease status only if confirme d malignant by [CONTACT_3973].  Scheduled tumor 
assessments will not be affected by [CONTACT_94503]/or drug holidays.  Subjects will continue to be monitored by [CONTACT_94543]. 
q. May be omitted if previous assessment was performed within the preceding 6 weeks.
r. Radiographic assessments will occur every 6 weeks (± 1 week) for the first 30 weeks then every 9 weeks (± 1 week) until progr ession or death.

t. MRI/CT of the brain is required at screening.  Subsequent MRI/CT of the brain post screening is required only when clinically indicated (e.g., CNS metastasis history and if 
CNS progression is suspected).
u. PRO assessments are required at Screening, before infusion on Day 1 of each cycle, EOT, and PTFU (if applicable).
v. Tumor material must be collected to confirm DLL3 expression.  Subjects that provide consent for DLL3 testing at any time afte r initial diagnosis must be registered in IRT.
w. Whole blood sample will be collected for CTC analysis during screening and pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1 (if ap plicable).  –[ADDRESS_104734] e to be collected on Day 1 of Cycle 1 only and 
is collected pre-infusion (–3 business days window is permitted).
y. Procedures for visits where no treatment is administered phone contacts for Day 8 and Day 15 of each cycle may be performed w ithin ± 3 day window relative to the due date.  
Procedures will include symptom review for presence of neurotoxicity, neutropenic colitis, fever, interstitial lung disease, se rosal effusions (including pleural and pericardial), 
peripheral edema, cutaneous reactions (e.g., photosensitivity).

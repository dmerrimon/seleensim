Evaluation of Therapeutic Equivalence and Superiority  The primary analyses for evaluating the therapeutic equivalence of the Test and Reference treatments, and the superiority of each active treatment over the Placebo, will be based on the proportion of subject s with treatment  
success  (defined as " none , minimal  or mild disease, a score of 0,  1 or 2, 
within the treatment area") on the IGA  at Week 12  visit (Day 85  ± 4, End 
of Study). 
The statistical analyses for equivalence for binary outcomes for the primary 
and two secondary endpoints will be based on a Y ates’ continuity -corrected 
confidence interval on the Test minus Reference difference (T -R) in 
proportions. Superiority will be tested at the 5% significance level using a 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel exact test stratified by [CONTACT_179815] . 
Therapeutic Equivalence Analysis  
Therapeutic equivalence will be evaluated for both primary and secondary 
endpoints using the PP population , with results in the mITT population 
being supportive . For the dichotomized primary endpoint (proportion of 
treatment success), if the 90% confidence interval (with Yates’ Correction 
Factor) of the difference between the proportion of subject s considered a 
“treatment success” in the Test and the Reference treatment groups at Week 
12, compared to Baseline, is contained within the pre -defined equivalence

 limits [ -20%, +20%], then therapeutic equivalence will  be considered to 
have been supported for the endpoint. The same statistical approach will be 
conducted for  analysis of  the two dichotomized secondary endpoints  in the 
PP and mITT populations. 
To declare therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference 
product, therapeutic equivalence must be demonstrated for only the primary 
endpoint in the PP population . 
Superiority to Placebo Analysis 
The primary measure of superiority will be evaluated using the mITT 
population and last observation carried forward ( LOCF ) for missing 
efficacy values. The results in the PP population will be considered 
supportive. The superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placebo 
will be concluded for the primary endpoint if the proportion of treatment 
success at Week 12  is statistically superior to Placebo ( p < 0.05, two- sided) 
using the mITT population and LOCF . The same statistical approach will 
be conducted for analysis of  the two dichotomized secondary endpoints  in 
the mITT  and PP populations. 
To declare superiority  of the Test and Reference products over Placebo, 
their superiority  must be demonstrated for only  the primary endpoint  in the 
mITT population. 
Safety Analysis  Adverse events (AEs) will be classified using standard MedDRA 
terminology Version 18.[ADDRESS_211580], AE frequencies 
will be compared among treatments using Fisher’s exact test or a similar

 8.0 INTRODUCTION  
8.1 Disease Being Treated  
Psoriasis is an immune (T-cell)-mediated inflammatory skin disease that affects approximately 2% of 
the western  population.[ADDRESS_211585] commonly 
seen on the knees and/or elbows. Although there are reports implicating a genetic association with the 
disea se, there are also studies that have established a set of psoriasis triggers including stress, 
medications (such as lithium, antimalarials, indomethacin, quinidine  and beta blockers), injury or 
infection. The condition is considered chronic although the fr equency and severity of outbreak in an 
individual can fluctuate without apparent cause.1-[ADDRESS_211586] . For mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, topi[INVESTIGATOR_179797]. For more severe c ases, oral or injectable systemic 
therapy may be warranted; however, the side effect profiles of these products limit their use.  
Psoriasis is typi[INVESTIGATOR_179798], moderate or severe and by [CONTACT_179816]  (BSA)  affecte d and covered by [CONTACT_179817]. Several scale systems have been 
developed and many are in use in the clinical setting; however , a severity scale, despi[INVESTIGATOR_179799] a 
convenient scoring system, does not capture the true burden of psoriasis for many patients. Psoriasis is associated with a broad range of medical and psychosocial comorbidities that erode quality of life of 
the patients. Subjects selected for this study suffer from plaque psoriasis of at least moderate severity 
and an IGA of [ADDRESS_211587] . Psoriasis treatments historically include topi[INVESTIGATOR_142739], sprays, 
lotions and foams. Examples of marketed products include corticosteroids (Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179800]
®, Clobex™), 
Vitamin A & D derivatives (T azorac®, Dovonex®), NSAIDs (salicylic acid), etc. For more severe cases, 
systemic therapy (methotrexate, oral retinoids, UV light, biologics , etc.) may be warranted; however, 
the side effect profiles of these products limit their use.1,2,4-6 
Tazarotene is one of a class of drugs known as the acetylenic retinoids.  Psoriasis is a chronic immune -
mediated disease that is characterized by [CONTACT_179818]. The epi[INVESTIGATOR_179801] T lymphocytes and the release of cytokines in response to antigenic stimulation. Tazarotene is a retinoic acid receptor -specific retinoid with demonstrated efficacy in the 
topi[INVESTIGATOR_179802]. Tazarotene down- regulates markers of keratinocyte differentiation, 
keratinocyte proliferation  and inflammation. The drug also up- regulates three novel genes TIG -1 
(tazarotene -induced gene -1), TIG -[ADDRESS_211588] associated with disease improvement.

 8.3 Scientific and Statistical Considerations  
Tazarotene has low systemic absorption and rapid elimination from semi -solid topi[INVESTIGATOR_179803]®. In a multiple -dose study with a once  daily dose of tazarotene cream, 0.1% 
administered for [ADDRESS_211589] s, mean peak plasma concentrations 
of 2.31 ng/mL occurring 8 hours  after the final dose were observed for  the active metabolite of 
tazarotene (tazarotenic acid ).7 The 21 Code of Federal Regulations Sections 320.24 (Revised 
April  1, 2014) requires that in- vivo pharmacokinetic testing in humans is the preferred method in 
evaluating therapeutic  equivalence.  However , circumstances for which measurement of the active 
moieties in biological fluids is not possible  or provides low concentrations, a pharmacodynamic 
response study indicative of clinical safety and efficacy can be considered.8-[ADDRESS_211590] appropriate method to evaluate the therapeutic equivalence

drug- related side effects of significance occurring during the study is low, the risk is higher in the 
two active treatment groups than in the Placebo group.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_179804] -related effects, mainly affecting the application sites: skin itching, irritation, dryness and 
burning or pain sensation represent the most common side effects. 
All subject s enrolled in this study will receive Investigator  evaluation of their condition over [ADDRESS_211595], via the informed consent form (ICF).  
9.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this study are to:  
1. Evaluate the therapeutic equivalence of the Test product, Tazarotene Cream  0.05% (Fougera 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) to the Reference product, TAZORAC® (tazarotene)  Cream , 0.05% 
(Allergan ) in the treatment of stable plaque psoriasis. 
2. Demonstrate the superiority of the efficacy of the Test and Reference (active) products over that of 
Placebo in the treatment of stable plaque psoriasis . 
3. Compare the safety of  the Test, Reference and Placebo products in the treatment of stable plaque  
psoriasis. 
10.0 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
10.1 Study Design and Plan Description  
This multi -center , double -blind, randomized, vehicle -controlled, parallel-group, bioequivalence 
clinical  study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a generic tazarotene c ream  0.05% 
(Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) compared to the FDA Reference Listed Drug (RLD) TAZORAC® 
(tazarotene ) Cream  0.05% ( Allergan ) in subject s with a clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis  of 
at least moderate severity . Additionally, both the Test product and Reference (i.e., the RLD)  products 
will be tested for superiority to a Placebo. Subject s with confirmed  stable  plaque psori asis will apply 
the investigational product  (IP) once daily , in the evening , to psoriatic lesions for 84 ± 4 days (12 
weeks).  
Before any study -specific procedures are performed, all subject s will read and sign the IRB -approved 
ICF. 
Each site will develop an individualized recruitment plan to collectively enroll approximately  [ADDRESS_211596] s, 18 years of age and older , with a clinical diagnosis of stable plaque psoriasis and 
meet ing the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects  will be randomized to one of the three IPs as follows:  
• Test: Tazarotene Cream , 0.05% (Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) 
• Reference:  TAZORAC® (tazarotene) Cream , 0.05%  (Allergan , Inc.) 
• Placebo:  Placebo (vehicle) Cream  (Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. )

remaining from the tube(s) previously dispensed. Further, any empty tubes will be collected at these 
visits. At Visit 4, all tubes will be collected (used and unused). A subject may return for an Unscheduled 
Visit at any time, should they require a resupply of IP (i.e. , tube lost; all IP used between visits).  It is 
estimated that approximately  tubes, but up to  tubes may be needed to dose a subject with high BSA  
involvement (~20% B
SA) for the treatment period (depending upon their treatment response over the 
12 w
eeks). Subjects with less BSA  involvement will need significantly less IP (approxi mately  to  
tubes). 
The day 
that the subject administers their first dose of IP will be considered Day 1.  
 
 
 
For all other subje cts, the first dose (Day 1) of IP 
will be applied on the evening of Visit 1. The s ubject  will be instructed to apply  enough cream (2 mg/cm
2) to cover only the psoriatic lesions 
with a thin film  (2 mg/cm2) once daily, in the evening, until the evening befor e Visit 4 (Day 85 ± 4 
days).There will be no application of the product on the day of the End of Study visit. 
Efficacy evaluations will be based on dermatological assessments in the clinic. The primary statistical 
analysi s of interest is the (1) proportion of subject s with treatment success (defined as none, minimal  
or mild disease, a score of 0,  1 or 2, within the treatment area ) on the Investigator’s Global Assessment 
(IGA) at the Week 12 visit. The secondary analyses are (1) proportion of subje cts with disease severity 
at the Week 12 visit consistent with none or minimal , a score of 0 or 1, within the treatment area on the 
IGA, and (2) proportion of subjects with target site plaque elevation, scaling, and erythema sc ores of 
less than or equal to one on the PASI at the Week 12 visit. 
10.2 Selection of Study Design  
This protocol is designed based on studies conducted as a part of the NDA  (21-184) for TAZORAC® 
Cream, 0.05% and the FDA draft guidance for tazarotene cream 0.05%, released in April , 2011.14

10.4.1  Treatments Administration  
At Visit 1, eligible subj ects will receive  of 
randomized IP (Test , Reference o r 
Placebo).  may be dispensed to the subject at the discretion of the Investigator  if the 
subject has a high BSA affected with plaque psoriasis at the time of dispensation that would warrant 
. Enough IP should be dispensed to allow the subject to dose daily until the next 
scheduled visit.  
At Visit 
[ADDRESS_211609]'s current BSA and 
the amount of IP remaining from the tube(s) previously dispensed. Further, any empty tubes will 
be collected at these visits. At Visit 4, all tubes will be collected (used and unused). A subject may return for an Unscheduled V isit at any time, should they require a resupply of IP (i.e., tube lost; all 
IP used between visits ; tube significantly damaged [became punctured] ). 
The subject will be instructed on when to apply their first dose of IP, which will be considered Day 1. F
emales of childbearing potential must administer their first dose (Day 1)  
 
 
 For 
all other subjec ts, the first dose (Day 1) of IP will be applied 
on the evening of Visit 1. 
Subject s will be instructed to a pply enough cream (2  mg/cm2) to cover only the lesions with a thin 
film.  If a bath or shower is taken before application, the skin should be dry bef ore applying the 
cream. Subject s will be instructed to apply the medication once daily , in the evening  and to wash 
hands thoroughly before and after each application . The first dose will be applied  on the evening 
of Day  1. The subject will then continue to apply a thin film  (2 mg/cm2) of the product once daily, 
in the evening, to cover only psoriatic lesions until the evening before Visit 4 (Day 85 ± 4  days).  
The amount of IP required for each subject will vary greatly based on the subject's BSA affected 
with psoriasis at Baseline, as well as their rate of improvement or disease worsening  over the course 
of the study. For subjects with BSA involvement close to 20%  at Baseline , it is estimated that up 
to approximately  may be required for each subject to dose for the full 
duration of the study (84 days)  depending upon their treatment response . Significantly less IP would 
be required for subjects with BSA involvement close to 2%  (approximately ). Therefore, 
the amount of IP dispensed to each subject will be dependent upon their BSA involvement  at 
Baseline and as the study progresses, at the discretion of the Investigator . Subject kits will each 
contain  of IP and will be randomized using the  system. After initial 
assignment of the first kit, additional kits of IP may be assigned to the subject as needed for dosing 
and/or to replace a missing tube and/or significantly damaged tube (i.e., punctured), also using the 
 system.

The following products will be used in the study: 
• Test: Tazarotene Cream 0.05% ( Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) 
• Reference : TAZORAC® (tazarotene ) Cream  0.05% ( Allergan , Inc.) 
• Placebo : Placebo (vehicle) Cream  (Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc. ) 
10.4.3  Study Blind  
The sponsor, clini cal research organization ( CRO ), Investigator , staff at the study site, study 
monitors, and data analysis/management personnel will be blinded to the subject’s treatment  
assignment. The subject  will be requested not to discuss the appearance of the IP tube with the 
Investigator  or study staff outside of the . The 
tubes of Test, Reference and 
Place
bo products will be blinded with identical outer cartons and labels.  This will allow the study 
to be conducted under double -blind conditions (i.e., such that neither the subject  nor the 
Investigator  or study staff members will know the identity of the subject ’s treatment).  
Each study
 site will have an  is blinded to the 
treatment arm that each subject has been randomized to.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
To ensure that information that could potentially bias handling of data is not disclosed, access to 
the master randomization code will be extremely limited. A sponsor representative who is not 
involved in clinical development or the study conduct will provide initial approval of the final code 
to  upon code generation. A member of the sponsor Pharmacovigilence department will have 
access to the code in case of a safety emergency and in order to expedite FDA reporting, if 
applicable. Otherwise , the packaging company  will hold the master 
randomization code until after database lock.  No parties (CRO, clinical sites or sponsor) involv ed 
in the conduct of the study will have access to the master randomization code until after database 
lock.  
Breaking the blind  must be considered only when knowledge of the treatment assignment is deemed 
essential by [CONTACT_68574]'s care.  Whenever possible, if the Investigator  feels that

10.7.1  Definitions  
An Adverse Event / Experience is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laborato ry finding, for example), symptom  or disease temporally associated with the use of a 
medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
An SAE  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threate ning 
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148244] 
• results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly / birth defect  
• is medically significant: Medical and scientific judgment shou ld be exercised in deciding 
whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical 
events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_179810]. These should also usually be considered serious.  
These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time of the event. For example, regarding a life- threatening event, this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death 
at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
An Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)  is any AE for which the Investigator  or sponso r assess a 
reasonable possibility for a causal relationship to a medicinal product, s ee 10.7.[ADDRESS_211634],  the nature or severity of which is not 
consistent with the Reference Safety Information (Appendix D ). The term ‘severity’ is used here 
to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be distinguished from the term ‘serious’. Reports which add significant information on the specificity, increase of occurrence or severity of 
a known, already doc umented serious adverse reaction constitute unexpected events.  
Information about common side effects already known about the IP can be found in the Reference Safety Information ( Appendix D ) or will be communicated in the form of Investigator  
Notifications.  These common side effects are also listed in the informed consent . The common side 
effects will be discussed with the subject  prior to their signing of the informed consent. 
For further details, please refer to the “Quick Reference Guide for Completing th e SAE Form”  for 
completing the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form” ([COMPANY_001] form).

 10.7.2  Severity of A Es 
The term ‘severity’ is used here to describe the intensity of a specific event. This has to be 
distinguished from the term ‘serious’. In the course of the study, the Investigator  will determine 
whether any AE ’s have occurred and will grade their severity as follows:  
Mild:  Transient or mild discomfort (<  48 hours); no medical intervention/therapy 
required  
Moderate:  Mild to moderate limitation in activity - some assistance may be needed; no 
or minimal medical intervention/therapy required  
Severe:  Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical 
intervention/therapy required, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9841]  
10.7.[ADDRESS_211635] or Placebo  that is given during any phase of the study. 
The Investigator  should assess whether or not, in his/her expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], the AE is suspected to the 
drug according to the following considerations: 
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study treatment 
administration makes a  causal relationship possible , and other 
drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
Not suspected:  The temporal relationship of the clinical event to study treatment 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely , or other drugs, 
therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event. 
Causality assessments are critical and must be provided for each unique AE in relation t o each IP. 
Missing causality assessments will be handled as suspected to IP by [CONTACT_456].  
10.7.4  AE Documentation 
Any AE (non- serious and serious) occurring after the subject has provided study- specific informed 
consent, and until the last study visit of the su bject, has to be recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by [CONTACT_105]- directive questioning of the subject at each visit 
during the study. AEs also may be identified when they are volunteered by [CONTACT_179820], laboratory test or other assessments. All AEs should 
be given appropriate medical care. Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action 
taken (i.e. , further observation only); IP dosage adjusted/temporar ily interrupted; IP permanently 
discontinued due to this AE; concomitant medication given; non- drug therapy given, subject  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057] / subject ’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_18533]. The treatment of the AE should be documented 
in the eCRF. In addition, the action taken with the IP should be documented, and should be assigned 
to one of the following categories: not changed, withdrawn, reduced, increased, interrupted,

 unknown and not applicable. Concomitant medication, other treatments or changes in the 
administration of the IP should be specified and documented. 
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting IP are only considered AEs if they worsen after 
enrol lment. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical 
signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant  or require therapy.  
Once an AE is identified, the Investigator  should follow -up as specified below. Each time, the 
outcome should be documented and assigned to one of the following categories: not 
recovered/ unchanged, condition deteriorating, recovered/resolved, improving/recovering, 
recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal or unknown. The assessment of an AE should be made at each planned visit (or more frequently, if necessary). The Investigator  should document in the 
eCRF any changes in seriousness, severity, the suspected relationship with the IP, the interventions 
required to treat it, and the outcome. 
AEs occurring between informed consent and first dosing 
Any AE occurring between study- specific informed consent and first dosing will be documented 
as “screening event”, with a IP causality assessment “IP not yet administered”. 
AEs occurring after first dosing  
The Investigator  should follow all AEs which occurred from first dosing and during the course of 
the study to the last visit of the subject  until the AE has resolved or stabilized or the subject has 
been lost to follow -up. 
Ongoing SAEs  at the time of last visit  
For any SA Es still ongoing at the time of last visit, the Investigator  should continue to follow -up 
until the SAE has resolved or has stabilized / is judged permanent , for SAEs considered to be related 
to IP ( serious adverse drug reaction [ SADR ]), and for up to [ADDRESS_211636] 
for non- related SAEs. The Investigator  should send SAE follow -up reports to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_68558] 
‘SAE Reporting’ section 10.7.[ADDRESS_211637] to report any new SAE  (beyond the 
protocol observa tion period) that the subject, believes might reasonably be related to study 
treatment. The Investigator  must report the SADR to recipi[INVESTIGATOR_68558] ‘SAE Reporting’ section 
10.7.5 below. 
10.7.5  SAE Reporting  
It is vitally important that the Investigator reports immediately , (i.e., no later than 24 hours 
after awareness) , any SAEs  or updates to previously reported SAEs, even if the Investigator  does 
not consider the AE  to be drug -related.  
The Investigator  should send SAE reports on the “Serious Adverse Event Report Form” ([COMPANY_001] 
form), as initial or follow -up reports, via fax or email to the Local Person for Pharmacovigil ence 
(LPPV ) (listed below), and in copy to the responsible Medical Monito r/CRO Contact  [CONTACT_68584] (listed below) , to the email addresses provided in the table below.

 The Investigator  should also send all updates / new information on a new SAE Report Form as a 
follow-up to the previously reported SAE. The follow-up information should describe whether the 
event has resolved or continues, if a diagnosis is available, if and how it was treated, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation. 
Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841], complications or progression of the initial  SAE must be reported as follow-up 
to the original epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865], regardless of when the event occurs.  
Any new SAE (that is considered completely independent of a previously reported SAE) should be 
reported as a new and separate initial SAE report.  
Any queries from the LPPV, CRO or sponsor  regarding SAE reports should be answered by [CONTACT_68585] 24 hours. 
For more detailed information refer to the “Quick Reference Guide for Completing the SAE Form”.  
The Investigator  should retain a delivery notification for all recipi[INVESTIGATOR_68559].

Investigator Notification 
If an ADR is not listed in the Reference Safety Information (e.g., Package Insert ), the sponsor may 
urgently require further information from the Investigator  for Health Authority reporting.  
The sponsor may, if applicable, issue Investigator  Notifications of unlisted SADRs ( Suspected 
Unexpected S erious Adverse Reaction s [S[LOCATION_003]Rs] ) to all Investigator s concerned with any study 
with the same IP.  
The submission of these Investigator Notifications, if applicable, to IRBs is the responsibility of 
the Investigator or the CRO as stipulated in the study contract.  
Health Authority Reporting 
The sponsor will submit all reportable cases within the requested timelines to all concerned authorities.  
Under 21 CFR 320.31(d)(3), the sponsor  or CRO must inform other Investigator s involved in the 
study plus the FDA within [ADDRESS_211638] be reported. 
IRB Reporting  
AEs that are evaluated by [CONTACT_179821] "Serious" should be reported by [CONTACT_179822] 24 hours, and the IRB as soon as is practically possible, preferably 
within 24 hours, whethe r or not they are considered expected or drug -related.

 10.7.9  Reconciliation 
Reconciliation between the safety database of the sponsor and the clinical database at the CRO will 
be done periodically  and at the end of the study  by [CONTACT_68591].  
The e CRFs / the clinical database will be reviewed  for potentially unreported cases. For any 
reportable case, the following parameters need to match exactly between the clinical and the safety 
database: trial number, site number, subject  identification  num ber, investigational drug, 
seriousness, date of death (if applicable) and Investigator  causality. All other parameters only need 
to be plausibly and medically consistent. For any SAE  assessed as suspected, a more detailed 
reconciliation should be conducted, including also treatment dates and medical history.

11.6 Primary and Secondary Endpoint  Analys es 
Therapeutic Equivalence Analysis  
Therapeutic equivalence will be evaluated for both primary and secondary endpoints using the PP 
population, with results in the mITT population being supportive. For the dichotomized primary endpoint (proportion of treatment success), if the 90% confidence  interval (with Yates’ Correction 
Factor) of the difference between the proportion of subjects considered a “treatment success” in the 
Test and the Reference treatment groups at Week 12  is contained within the pre -defined equivalence 
limits [ -20%, +20%], then therapeutic equivalence will be considered to have been supported for the 
endpoint. The same statistical approach will be conducted for  analysis of  the two dichotomized 
secondary endpoints in the PP and mITT populations. 
To declare therapeutic equivalence of the Test product to the Reference product, therapeutic 
equivalence must be demonstrated for only the primary endpoint in the PP population. 
Superiority to Placebo Analysis 
The primary measure of superiority will be evaluated using the mITT  population and LOCF  for missing 
efficacy values. The results in the PP population will be considered supportive. The superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placebo will be concluded for the primary endpoint if the proportion 
of treatment success at Week 12 is statistically superior to Placebo ( p < 0.05, two- sided  a Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel  exact test stratified by [CONTACT_68566] ) using the mITT population and L OCF . The same 
statistical approach will be conducted for analysis of  the two dichotomized secondary endpoints in the 
mITT and PP populations. 
To declare superiority of the Test and Reference products over Placebo, their superiority must be 
demonstrated for only the primary endpoint in the mITT population.

12.3.9  Pre
gnanc y and Breastfeeding  
Tazarotene cream is designated as Pregnancy Category X; therefore there is a potential risk of 
teratogenicity. Therefore, all females of childbearing potential should be maintained on an appropriate method of contraception throughout the study to prevent pregnancy. Females that are 
lactating, breastfeeding or trying to become pregnant should not be enrolled in the study. The ICF 
will clearly outline the risk and this requirement.  
All females of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed at each clinic visit. The 
pregnancy test will have a minimum sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/ml for hCG. The results of all 
pregnancy tests (positive or negative) will be documented. A negative urine pregnancy result must  
be obtained at screening (Visit 1)  before  study participation. Subjects with a positive pregnancy 
result during screening will not be enrolled in the study. Before study enrollment, females of 
child bearing potential must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during study 
participation.

4.[ADDRESS_1271253] lenses accounted for over 90% of lens fits. 
(Morgan 2019). Furthermore, it was reported th at almost 32% of soft contact [CONTACT_905680] a dail y disposable modality . DDT2 is a new dail y disposable silicone hydrogel

of elasticity . The lens was rec ently approved b y the FDA  and will be marketed as 
Precision1™ (verofilcon A) Soft Contact [CONTACT_32993]. 
The rationale for this study  is the need to compare the objective and subjective performance 
of the new DDT2 lenses to an alread y marketed daily  disposable c ontact lens (Acuvue 
Moist).
The primary  endpoint for this study  was selected to fulfill the primary  objective. Procedures 
for measurement of these endpoints were selected based on common practice for these 
assessments. The design of this study is justified based upon previous preclinical and clinical 
testing, as described within the package insert. Moist contact [CONTACT_905681] .

TDOC-[ADDRESS_1271255] lenses are intended and marketed for daily  wear use under a daily  disposable 
wear modalit y; further details on any  known potential risks and benefits can be found in the 
package inser t. 
Neither the DDT2 nor the Acuvue Moist contact [CONTACT_905682] a 
cleaning/disinfecting solution, and the biocompatibility  with lens care solutions and any  
associated clinical ef fects are unknown. 
A summary  of the known potential risks and benefits associated with DDT2 can be found in 
the package insert. Risks are minimized by  [CONTACT_905683] y 
procedures, and through close supervision b y a licensed clinician during exposure to the 
study  lenses. The potential harms associated with on- eye exposure to the new lens materials 
include toxicity  response, blurred vision, and ocular discomfort. In general, the risks 
associated with the wear of DDT2 are anticipated to be similar to other marketed dail y 
disposable soft contact [CONTACT_13276].
There may  also be unknown risks to use of DDT2 contact [CONTACT_13276]. Any risk to subjects in this 
clinical study  will be minimized by  [CONTACT_905684], clinical oversight and monitoring.
The site p ersonnel will educate subjects on proper hy giene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact [CONTACT_13287]. Subjects should be instructed not to

non-adapted subjects. Moreover , the subjects will not be permitted to use artificial 
tears/rewetting drops during the course of th e study  as this may  confound the primary  
effectiveness variable. The study will exclude any habitual wearers of Moist or DT1 in order 
to reduce potential bias of wearers to their habitual contact [CONTACT_13276].   This study  will also

TDOC-[ADDRESS_1271278] questions:
“Have you had an yhealth problems since y our last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
Changes in any pr otocol -specific parameters evaluated during the 
study  are to be reviewed by  [CONTACT_737] . Any untoward (unfavorable and unintended) 
change in a pr otocol -specific parameter that is clinically  relevant, 
in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_2511] I nvestigator , is to be report ed as an AE. These clinically  relevant 
changes will be reported regardless of causality .
11.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject p rior to the start of the study  (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .
In addition, temporary  lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period. 
For each recorded event, the ADEs and SAEs documentation must include: date of 
occurrence, severity , treatment (if ap plicable), outcome, and assessments of the seriousness 
and causality . In addition, the I nvestigator must document all device deficiencies reported or 
observed with test and control articles on the Device Deficiency eCRF . The site must submit 
all available information on ADEs, SAEs, and device deficiencies to the Study  Sponsor 
immediately  as follows:
ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency  eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness. 
A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included with product returns. Refer to the 
MOP  for additional information on product returns.

Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.  
Document an y changes to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report, 
Certificate of Death ,etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Ef fect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system beco me non- operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device 
Deficiency Form. The completed form is faxed or emailed to the Study Sponsor at 1 -817-
302-1927 or MSUS.safety @alcon.com according to the timelines outlined above; 
however , the reported information must be entered into the EDC sy stem once it becomes 
operational.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contact[CONTACT_125603]
(page 1) .
Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copi[INVESTIGATOR_13271]
’s medical records. The 
Investi gator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE 
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based on 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective symptom(s), as defined below:
Intensity (Severity)
Mild An AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easily  tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.

TDOC-[ADDRESS_1271279] assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by [CONTACT_13302], as show n below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related  
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possib ility that 
the AE was caused by  [CONTACT_13303] y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor wi ll assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that is 
upgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelat ed to related.
11.[ADDRESS_1271280]
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the C omplaint # which will be provided by  [CONTACT_13304] ’s Global Product Complaint Management Sy stem 
(GPCMS).
11.4.[ADDRESS_1271281]
When study  products include non-Alcon marketed products, and such products are associated 
with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs, in the I nvestigator should report 
complaints directly  to the manufacturer as per the manufacturer’ s instructions or local 
regulatory  requirements, if applicable.
11.5 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Masked information on the identity  of the assigned medical device should not be disclosed 
during the stud y (see Section 9.4 ). If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of 
subject safet y, the Investigator is encouraged to contact [CONTACT_905685] - Business Use Only  Effective Date:

representative prior to unmasking the information if there is suf ficient time. Dependent upon 
the individual circumstances (ie, medical emergency), the code may be broken prior to 
contact [CONTACT_69211] . The Stud y Sponsor mu st be informed of all cases in which 
the code was broken and of the circumstances involved. Additionally , the Study  Sponsor may  
be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill expedited regulatory reporting 
requirements .
11.6 Follow -Up of Subjects wit h Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up procedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that are unresolved/ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock). 
Any additional data received up to [ADDRESS_1271282] be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor ’s req uest. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket 
vigilance procedures) and should be communicated to the medical device ’s manufacturer as 
per local requirements.
The Investigator should also report complaints on non -Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.
11.7 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study
Women of childbearing potential or women who are pregnant at the time of study  entry  are 
not excluded from participation. Pregnancy  should be included in the Medical History  section 
of the eCRF when a pregnant woman enters the study  or if a woman becomes pregnant 
during the stud y. Pregnancy  is not reportable as an AE; howev
er, complications may  be 
reportable and will be decided on a case -by-case basis.
12ANAL YSIS PLAN
Continuous variables will be summarized using the number of observations, mean, standard 
deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum, as well as confidence inte rvals (CIs) or 
confidence limits where applicable. Categorical variables will be summarized with counts

sequence assignment and locking the database, based upon the Deviations and Evaluability  
Plan (DEP).
12.2 Analysis Sets
12.2.1 Safety Analysis Set
Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y anal ysis set on a treatment- emergent basis. 
As such, the safety  anal ysis set will include all subjects/eyes exposed to any stud y lenses 
evaluated in this study , except for the lenses used at Visit 1 for the purpose of parameter 
optimization and fitting, as they  are not intended for the assessment of safety . For treatment -
emergent safet y anal yses, subjects/ey es will be categorized under the actual study  lenses 
expo sed in the corresponding lens sequence.
12.2.2 Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (F AS) is the set of all randomized subjects who are exposed to any  study  
lenses evaluated in this study , except for the lenses used for optimization and fitting.
12.2.3 Per Protocol Analysis Set
The per protocol (PP) analy sis set is a subset of F AS and excludes all data/subjects that have 
met any  of the critical deviation or evaluability  criteria identified in the DEP .
12.3 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by  [CONTACT_271460]. 
Counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables such as sex, age group, 
race, and ethnicity . Number of observations, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum

The primary  endpoint of distance VA will be tested at one -sided α=0.05 for noninferiority   
 
 
12.4.1 Analysis of Primary Effectiveness Endpoint (s)
The primary  objective of this study  is to demonstrate noninferiorit y in distance VAwhen 
wearing DDT2 contact [CONTACT_905686]. The primary 
endpoint is distance VA with study  lenses, collected separatel y for each eye in logMAR.
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Hypotheses
The null and alternative hy potheses are formulated in terms of the predefined margin of 0.05 
for noninferiority :
H0: µ(T) –
µ(C) ≥ 0.05
Ha: µ(T) – µ (C) < 0.05
where µ (T) and µ (C)denote the mean distance V A for DDT2 and Acuvue Moist, respecti vely, 
on the logMAR scale.
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Methods
A mixed ef fect repeated measures model will be utilized to test these hy potheses. The model 
will include terms for lens, visit, lens by  [CONTACT_23259], period, and sequence. Within-
subject correlation due to e ye and the crossover design will also be accounted for in the 
model. L ens dif ference (DDT2 minus Moist) and the corresponding one-sided 95% upper 
confidence limit will be computed. Noninferiorit y in distance V A will be declared if upper 
confidence limit is less than 0.05.

12.5 Handling of Missing Data
All data obtained in evaluable subjects/eyes will be included in the analy sis. No imputation 
for missing values will be carried out  
12.6 Safety Analys es
The safet y endpoints are:
AEs
Biomicroscop y findings
Device deficiencies
There are no safet y hypotheses planned in this study . The focus of the safet y anal ysis will be 
a comprehensive descriptive assessment of occurrence of adverse events as well as the other 
listed parameters.
All AEs occurring from the time a subject signs informed consent to study  exit will be 
accou nted for in the reporting. Safety  anal yses will be conducted using the safet y analysis set 
on a treatment -emergent basis. Descriptive summaries (counts and percentages) for ocular 
and nonocular AEs will be presented by  [CONTACT_69212] T erms. AEs leading to study  discontinuation, significant non- serious AEs, and 
SAEs will be identified. Individual subject listings will be provided, as necessary . 
Individual subject listings will be provided for AEs that occur after sign ing informed consent 
but prior to exposure to IP.
Each biomicroscop y parameter will be tabulated by [CONTACT_13296]. For each biomicroscop y 
parameter , counts and percentages of ey es that experience an increase of ≥ 2 grades from 
baseline (last assessment prior to study  lens exposure) to an y subsequent visit within the 
same period will be presented. A supportive listing will be generated which will include all

12.8 Sample Size Justification
Sample size calculation is based on a prior clinical study  (CLE383 -C004) which evaluated 
performance of DDT2 and [ADDRESS_1271285]. 
Primary  Effectiveness
To demonstrate noninferiority  (margin = 0.05 in logMAR; ½ line in Snellen) in distance VA 
as a one -tailed hy pothesis with α=0.05, and using a standard deviation of 0.068 for paired 
differences, 80% power can be attained with a sample size of 14 (7 per sequence).

The Study  Sponsor may  release anony mized study data to external researchers for purposes 
of future research directl y related to the study  objectives, or future research that is bey ond the 
scope of the current study objectives. The Informed Consent Form explains this to study  
subjects. Anon ymization means that all identifiable information will be removed from the 
datase t and all links to the subjects in the study  will be removed. Anon ymization of the data 
will maintain confidentiality  of the subjects who participate in the study  so that they  cannot 
be identified b y external researchers. The anon ymized data set will conta in records from all 
of the subjects in the current study , but the anonymization process might change the data set 
in some way s, so external researchers will be informed that they  might not be able to

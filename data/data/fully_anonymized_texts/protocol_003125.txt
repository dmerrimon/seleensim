Study Title  
Optimization of Spi[INVESTIGATOR_158389] (SMT) Protocols 
Objectives  
Primary Aims 
I. Identify SMT protocol components and interactions that independently predict SMT 
mechanistic outcomes (spi[INVESTIGATOR_608843]). We hypothesize that one 
or more combination of components will be ident ified that optimize improvement in SMT 
mechanisms.   
II. Identify SMT protocol components and interactions that independently predict SMT patient-
centered outcomes (function, pain). We hypothesize that one or more combination of components will be identified that optimize im provement in patient-centered outcomes. 
Secondary Aims 
I. Explore the moderating effect of responder status after 2 SMT sessions. We hypothesize 
that responder status after 2 sessions will moderate mechanistic and patient-centered 
outcomes.  
II. Define optimized SMT protocol(s) based on combined results of the primary and secondary aims. Optimized protocols will be considered as the combination of components that maximize improvement in pat ient-centered outcomes at [ADDRESS_807430] will recruit adults with non-specific low back pain (LBP). We will provide 2 sessions of SMT to all subjects. We will then assess responder status and randomize subjects stratified by [CONTACT_608876] a treatment group for an additional 3 weeks using a factorial design to evaluate different co mbinations of intervention components (muscle 
activation exercise, spi[INVESTIGATOR_608844], additional SMT) that influence pathways 
shown to modulate the effects of SMT. Outcomes will include spi[INVESTIGATOR_608845]-reported outcomes assessed at baseline, and after [ADDRESS_807431] week of participation. 
Subjects are then randomly assigned to receiv e an additional 3 weeks of treatment involving 
different combinations of exercise and/or additional SMT, or to receive no additional 
treatment. The final follow-up is conducted [ADDRESS_807432] to be “on study” is 3 months.

2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus 
Low back pain (LBP) is a major public health problem. An estimated 60-80% of individuals will experience an epi[INVESTIGATOR_138814], and prevalence rates have been increasing in the past decade. Considering the prevalence of LBP, it is not surprising that the condition imposes significant economic burden on individuals, the heal thcare delivery system, and society. Total 
annual direct healthcare costs in the U.S. for LBP were estimated at $90 billion in 1998, with an 
inflation-adjusted rate of 65% over the next [ADDRESS_807437] common symptom for which complementary and alternative medicine 
(CAM) is sought. In 2007,  18% of adult CAM users in the U.S. were seeking care for LBP, more 
than double the next most common condition. The most common CAM intervention sought by 
[CONTACT_608878][INVESTIGATOR_608846]  (SMT). Several professions use SMT, although it is 
most often provided by [CONTACT_608879]. Surveys in the U.S. suggest about half of those with chronic 
LBP have sought chiropractic care,  and LBP the reason for at least 40% of chiropractic visits. The 
Institute of Medicine identifies LBP as a top [ADDRESS_807438]-spectrum 
therapy, but one that preferentially benefits some individuals with  LBP (SMT-responders)  but not 
others (non-responders). This work has culminated  in the development of a validated model that 
has identified specific biomechanical signals (changes in spi[INVESTIGATOR_608847]) that relate to favorable clini cal response (improved function). The clinically 
important signals we have identified (stiffness and muscle activation) are modifiable with 
interventions other than SMT; thus SMT protocols may be optimized through the use of co-interventions that modulate these signals. Our team has also developed safe, valid and reliable procedures to measure these signals, and have demonstrated successful application of both SMT treatment and signal measurement procedures in clinical populations.  
Our goal in this proposal is to optimize SMT treatment protocols for LBP. Our optimization strategy 
will evaluate SMT combined with other treatments known to modulate the same signals that underlie the clinical effects of SMT (spi[INVESTIGATOR_608848]) using both mechanistic (stiffness, lumbar multifidus activation) and patient-centered (function and pain) outcomes. We 
have grounded our body of work in this area within the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) 
framework; which provides an efficient multi-step research strategy for optimizing multi-component interventions. In this project we will use innovative methodology to efficiently evaluate 
the effects of various individual treatment compo nents towards an overall effect; identifying which 
components are contributing to the target outcome s and which, if any, may be discarded. Results 
of this project will provide optimized SMT protocols that will be ready for application in future randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT.
   
3. STUDY DESIGN 
We will use a factorial design examining 3 int ervention components (additional SMT, mobilizing 
and multifidus activating exercise) provided in [ADDRESS_807439] session subjects will be 
categorized as SMT responders or non-responders based on our previously-validated threshold of 50% improvement on the Oswestry (ODQ).  Randomization to subsequent treatment will be 
stratified based on responder status. This will allow us to examine the moderating effects of early clinical response. In our prior studies 35%-45% of individuals with LBP are responders to SMT 
after 2 sessions. What is unknown is the persistence of the improvement observed in early 
responders and whether or not persistence can be augmented through additional SMT and/or co-interventions working on the same causal pathways as  SMT. Likewise, it is unknown from our 
prior work if early non-responders can be converted to responders with additional SMT and/or co-interventions. Therefore, we will randomly ass ign subjects to receive 6 additional sessions (or no 
additional treatment) provided over [ADDRESS_807440] difference in clinical outcomes in subjects receiving 9-12 sessions 
relative to 3-6 SMT sessions without co- interventions. Outcomes including assessments of

of phase  I), 4 weeks (primary outcome - end of phase II), and after 3 months (long-term outcome).  
4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.[ADDRESS_807441] satisfy all of the following eligibility criteria: 
I. Pain between the 12th rib and buttocks with or without symptoms into one or both legs, 
which, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1077], originate from the lumbar region. 
II. Age 18 - 60 years 
III. Oswestry disability score > 20% 
4.[ADDRESS_807442] meeting any of the following exclusi on criteria at baseline will be excluded from 
participation. 
I. No prior surgery to the lumbosacral spi[INVESTIGATOR_608849]. Not currently pregnant 
III. Not currently receiving mind-body or exercise treatment for LBP from a healthcare provider 
(e.g., chiropractic, physical therapy, massage therapy, etc.) 
IV. No neurogenic signs including any of the following: positive ipsi- or contra-lateral straight 
leg raise test (symptoms reproduced <450); reflex, sensory, or strength deficit in a pattern 
consistent with lumbar nerve root compression 
V. No “red flags” of a potentially serious condition including cauda equina syndrome, major or 
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_608850], fracture , cancer, infection or systemic disease 
4.3 Study Enrollment Procedures  
Participants will be enrolled at two sites: the Univ ersity of Utah and University of Alberta. At the 
University of Utah we will work within the Univer sity of Utah Health Care (UUHC) family practice 
and physiatry providers to encourage direct referra l of interested individuals consulting for LBP 
into the study. We will also develop IRB-approved recruitment materials to be integrated into our 
EPIC electronic health record, allowing providers to print and provide the information to 
potentially-interested individuals. We will also work with the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) Bioinformatics Core to us e the UUHC electronic data warehouse (EDW) to 
identify patients with specific characteristics based on demographic information and ICD-[ADDRESS_807443] we will identify patients with a family practice visit with an ICD-10 code related to non-specific LBP (M54.5, M54.9, M51.36) between the ages of 18-[ADDRESS_807444] been used in these clinics previously and c an be further distributed to potential participants 
through various approved electronic distribution services. We will also work with the various 
professional associations to identify patients with specific characteristics using established 
communication strategies (e.g. patient newsletters and social media postings). As is the case in Utah, potential participants informed by [CONTACT_608880]-10 code related to non-specific LBP (M54.5, M54.9, M51.36) between the ages of 18-[ADDRESS_807445]’s treatment group assignment throughout the study.
 Following baseline examination,  all subjects  will begin phase I treatment.  
All assessment and treatment sessions will be conducted at the Patient Wellness Center at the University of Utah  and in the Rehabilitation Robotics Sandbox at the University of Alberta.  
Treatment will be provided by [CONTACT_608881]
 (DC  or PT) and trained in study-
related procedures.   
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.[ADDRESS_807446] interlocks their fingers behind the head. The clinician rotates the subjec t, and delivers a high-velocity, low-amplitude 
(HVLA) thrust to the anterior superior iliac spi[INVESTIGATOR_105683] a posterior/inferior direction. The clinician notes 
if a cavitation (ie,
 a “pop”) occurred. If it does, SMT treatment is complete. If no cavitation occurs,  
the subject is repositioned  and SMT is performed again. If no cavitation  occurs on the second 
attempt, the clinician will manipulate the opposite side. A maximum of [ADDRESS_807447] been shown to be effective for activating the multifidus. Subjects will also perform lumbar extensor strengthening exercises shown to produce 20%-50% of multifidus maximum voluntary contraction.
 This dose is 
adequate to enhance multifidus activation, without imposing high loads that may exacerbate LBP. Subjects will continue to perform isometri c exercises throughout treatment. We have applied 
these exercises in prior research with no adverse events. 
Activity  Description   Initial Dose      Goals for Progression  
Preferential, isometric 
multifidus activation  exercises 1. Isolated multifidus contraction while 
prone, seated, standing 
2. Isolated co-contraction of multifidus and

Table.  Multifidus activation exercise protocol  
 
5.1.3  Mobilizing Exercises 
Subjects  randomized to  receive mobilizing exercises during phase II will be instructed in a 
program of repeated movements progressing into end-ranges of spi[INVESTIGATOR_608851]/or extension 
based on principles described by [CONTACT_608882], and shown in past studies to reduce spi[INVESTIGATOR_608852]. 
Subjects will be instructed in mid-range exercises and will be further assessed for a directional 
preference. A directional preference is present if movement in a particular direction decreases LBP intensity or causes symptoms to centralize towards the midline.
 Directional preference can 
be determined reliably and if present, matching the direction of mobilizing exercise to the directional preference improves outcomes. If a subj ect has a directional preference he or she will 
be prescribed exercises specifically in that di rection along with mid-range exercise.  Otherwise 
the subject will be assigned exercises moving into either flexion or extension based on the clinician’s discretion.  Subjects will perform t heir prescribed exercises following SMT at treatment 
sessions and will be instructed to perform the exercises daily on other days. We have applied these exercises in prior research with no adverse events.

5.2 Concomitant Interventions  
5.2.1 Allowed Interventions 
Interventions permitted during the study period include use of medication to control LBP 
symptoms (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, etc.) The use of various medications will be recorded at the baseline examination. Visits to health care providers for LBP are allowed during the study 
period (e.g., physician visits) as long as no interventional procedures are received (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_203577], massage, exercise therapy, etc.) 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations [ADDRESS_807450] forms in REDCap for each scheduled treatment session according to the participant’s 
randomized group assignment. Treatment session forms will permit an evaluation of the number 
of scheduled sessions attended by [CONTACT_20908]. For sessions that are attended, the treating clinician will information on the interventions provided and any reasons for non-adherence to protocols. The site study coordinator will monitor the forms at least monthly and discuss instances of non-adherence with the clinician. All off-protocol events will be recorded, such as the use of use of modalities (heat, cold, ultrasound, etc.), or application of manual therapy or exercise 
procedures not outlined in the protocol. For purposes of the data analysis per-protocol analyses we will define “adherence” as occurring when at least 80% of scheduled treatment sessions are attended. Attendance at <80% of scheduled sessions will be considered a protocol deviation.

*Oswestry is to be administered once between screening and baseline, or twice if needed at clinician discretion or if > [ADDRESS_807451] a baseline assessment will be scheduled to obtain informed consent, insure all eligibility criteria are met and schedule a full assessment 
to begin the study either at that time or within 7 days of the screening evaluation. Before the 
scheduled baseline assessment, the participant may complete the Oswestry Disability survey to determine if their score is ≥  20%. If the Oswestry score is < 20%, the participant will be 
notified that they are ineligible for the study and the assessment cancelled. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Consenting Procedure 
Interested individuals who are scheduled for a baseline assessment will begin the assessment by [CONTACT_608883] a form approved by [CONTACT_608884]. The consenting process will be conducted by a research assistant who is trained by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_608858] (CITI) which includes modules on human subjects research ethics and regulations related to informed c onsent. A copy of the signed informed consent 
document will be retained by [CONTACT_41314].  A single consent form will be used for the 
project. The research assistant consenting the participant will sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) checklist which will be retained by [CONTACT_41314]. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Screening 
Once informed consent is obtained the following screening procedures will be completed within 72 hours to insure eligibility: 
 Confirm age on the date of consent is between 18 – 60 years old. 
 Confirm that the participant is not aware that she is pregnant. 
 Confirm that the participant is not currently receiving other interventions for their LBP. 
 Confirm that the participant is experiencing LBP defined as pain between the 12th ribs 
and buttock with or without symptoms that extend into the buttock(s) or leg(s). without “red flags” suggesting a possible non-musculoskeletal cause (recent trauma, 
unexplained weight loss, night pain, systemtic illness)

6.2.2 Enrollment, Baseline, and/or Randomization 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Enrollment 
This study uses a single informed consent document for both screening and treatment purposes. Thus the enrollment date is the date on which the consent document was signed and eligibility was confirmed. We anticipate that screening will be completed on the same day for the majority of participants because of the relatively simple and quick screening procedures required. At the latest screening will be completed within 7 days.
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Baseline Assessments 
Assessments involve collection of both mechanistic and self-report outcomes. Self-report 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 16 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 measures will be collected via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), an NIH-
supported, browser-based, software solution that allows researchers to create secure 
online forms for data capture, management and analysis. At each assessment participants 
will input data directly into REDCap. If a participant is unable to directly input data using a computer paper forms will be available with data uploaded at a later time.  
The following assessments are collected at baseline: 
 Demographic  data  will include age, sex, race/ethnicity, employment status and general 
medical and LBP history. Current medication use for LBP will be recorded. This information 
will be used for descriptive purposes and possible covariates in analyses. 
 Physical examination will include spi[INVESTIGATOR_608859]-applied posterior-anterior force. 
 Oswestry Disability Index (OSW): a self-re ported LBP-specific measure of function 
assessed on a 0-100 scale, with lower numbers indicating better function.  
 Numeric Pain Rating Scale: a self-reported 0-10 rating of pain intensity ranging from ‘0’ no 
pain, and ‘10’ worst imaginable pain. 
 Psychosocial Covariate Measures : will include Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire will 
be used to measure patients’ beliefs about how physical activity and work may affect their 
LBP and perceived risk for re-injury. The Pain Catastrophizing and Pain Self-Efficacy short 
forms will be used to measure the extent to which people catastrophize in  response to pain 
and their degree of confidence in the ability to function with pain respectively. These 
variables may serve as covariates in the analys es to control for psychosocial risk factors. 
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_608860]: are obtained with a mechanically-assisted indentation device 
consisting of a motorized probe in an external frame. The probe contains a compressive-tension load cell. Displacement of the probe is measured
 by a linear variable differential 
transformer. Stiffness is assessed with the subject prone.  The indentation probe is 
positioned over the L 3 spi[INVESTIGATOR_18239]. Indentation involves advancement of the probe 
from 5 N pre-load to  60 N final load maintained for  1 second. Three trials are performed 
with mean values used for analysis. Indentation data are used to calculate global stiffness  
(GS) (N) as the slope of the force displacement curve and terminal stiffness  (TS)  (N/mm)  
as the peak  applied force  and resultant displacement of underlying tissue.  
 Lumbar Multifidus Activation Measures: ar e obtained with brightness-mode ultrasound 
images. The subject is prone with neck in neutral and arms overhead at about [ADDRESS_807452]  and submaximal  contraction. 
[IP_ADDRESS]   Randomization 
Following baseline assessment all participants will receive [ADDRESS_807453]. Greene, Director of the Study Design and Biostatistics Center
 (SDBC)  in 
the CCTS at the University of Utah. Blocked randomization with block sizes of 4 or 6 will be used. Randomization will be stratified based on site (Utah or Alberta) and responder 
status after 2 SMT sessions (based on re-assessment of the OSW) to balance these 
variables. At the 1-week assessment the study c oordinator or research assistant will look 
up the participant in the study database and open the Responder & Randomization Status  
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 17 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 form in REDCap. This form will display the Os westry score from the baseline assessment 
and the calculation of score change. The percent change between baseline and 1-week 
scores determines responder status (>50% improvement  = “responder”; <50% 
improvement=  “non-responder”). Once the responder status is entered the study staff will 
select the randomize button on the screen to trigger study assignment based on the 
allocation table provided by [CONTACT_46134], provided all of eligibility criteria are met and 
the participant has been assigned to one of the two study sites. If any of these criteria are not valid a warning message will be displayed indicating the criteria issue(s) and the 
randomization will not be completed. 
6.2.[ADDRESS_807454] or research assistant. Follow-up assessments will be performed by a research assistant who will be blind to participants’ treatment assignments. Participants will be reminded by [CONTACT_608885]. If a research assistant becomes unblinded during the course of a participant’s study participation, he or she will not be allowed to conduct 
additional follow-up assessments for that participant. The research assistant may participate 
in assessments for other participants for whom blinding has not been compromised. Instances of unblinding during an assessment will be recorded as an unexpected event.   
Clinicians providing treatment cannot be blinded. The use of standardized protocols for all 
treatments and clinician-compliance audits throughout the project will minimize potential bias related to differential treatment application.

7.3 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse events will solicited at each assessment (1 week, 4 weeks, 3 months). If an adverse 
event is identified unsolicited during a treatment session or other contact [CONTACT_608887], 
the event will be recorded and reported as outlined below. 
 Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical o ccurrence in a subject during participation in the 
clinical study or with use of the experimental agent being studied. An adverse finding can include 
a sign, symptom, abnormal assessment (laboratory test value, vital signs, electrocardiogram finding, etc.), or any combination of these regardless of relationship to participation in the study. 
Unanticipated Problems (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving 
risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets 
all of the following criteria: 
 Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that 
are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied; 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is 
a reasonable possibility that the incident, exper ience, or outcome may have been caused by 
[CONTACT_3459]); and 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social har m) than was previously known or recognized. 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that m eets one or more of the following criteria: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (places subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred) 
 Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
 Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect   
7.[ADDRESS_807458] submit all reports to their local IRB other entities using the following timeline:   
 Unanticipated problems that are serious adv erse events will be reported to the IRB, DSM 
committee and NCCIH within [ADDRESS_807459] Guidelines and Considerations 20 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018  
 Other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB, DSM committee, and NCCIH 
within [ADDRESS_807460] at each study visit the occurrence of any other adverse events (e.g., visiting the emergency room or medical provider for pain exacerbation, etc.) A report of all 
adverse events will be maintained by [CONTACT_608888].  
Characteristics of an Adverse Event 
Relationship to Study Intervention 
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used: 
1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite) 
a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention. 
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. 
c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued. 
d. The event reappears upon a re-challenge with the intervention. 
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related) 
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset. b. An alternate etiology has been established. 
Expectedness of SAEs 
The Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_608865].  An adverse event will be considered unexpected if the nature, 
severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for the intervention.   
Severity of Event 
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events: 
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL) 
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non-invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on ADL 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical attention, needs major assistance with ADL 
7.5 Followup for Adverse Events 
All adverse events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
7.6 Safety Monitoring  
The scope and the purpose of this study qualifies as a Phase III clinical trial, therefore a data and safety monitoring (DSM) board will be established based on the NIH guidelines and NCCIH 
input, and commensurate with the level of risk, size, and complexity of this study.   
 
Composition of the DSM:  The DSM Board will be composed of three individuals with expertise 
in disciplines relevant to the conduct of this  study who are not involved in the study, and have 
no conflict of interest or economic interest in the results of the study. 
 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations 21 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018  
Frequency and Character of DSM Meetings:  Because this study involves procedures with 
minimal risk, we propose to conduct DSM meetings via conference call on an annual basis. 
Each DSM meeting will begin with an open session that will be attended by [CONTACT_608889], Study Coordinators and representatives from  the NCCIH Program Office. Open session will 
review study procedures, plans for data and safe ty monitoring, recruitment and retention, 
gender and minority inclusion, protocol adherence, data management, the occurrence of any adverse events. The open session will be followed by a closed session that will be attended by 
[CONTACT_608890] s. The closed session will be used to 
discuss data to which the other Investigators must remain blinded.  
 
Content of DSMB Meeting Reports:  DSM report from each meeting will review the topi[INVESTIGATOR_608866], accrual and retention, data management, etc. The DSM report will include a recommendation concerning continuation of 
the study. Each DSM report will provide a tally of  all adverse events in each of the categories 
listed above in all treatment groups.  Blinding of  adverse event results will be maintained and 
will be broken only if the DSMB indicates a need to un-blind groups for serious safety reasons. DSMB reports will be submitted to the Principal  Investigator, the NCCIH Program Office, and 
the University of Utah ad University of Alberta Institutional Review Boards. 
8.   INTERVENTION  DISCONTINUATION  
The investigators will only discont inue a participant’s interventi on if the risk-benefit ratio 
for that participant changes substantially such that th ey would no longer meet the 
project’s eligibility criteria . Examples include development  of signs consistent with 
neurologic deficits or presentation of “red flag” symptom s. These circumstances will be 
identified by [CONTACT_608891]. If a 
participant is discontinued, we will conti nue to collect the self-report outcomes only. 
9.  STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues  
This study uses a factorial design examini ng 3 intervention components (additional SMT, 
mobilizing and multifidus activating exercise) provided in [ADDRESS_807461] 
session participants will be categorized as responders or non-responders based on a threshold of 50% improvement on the OSW.  Randomization to subsequent treatment is stratified by 
[CONTACT_608877]. We will randomly assign participants to receive 6 additional sessions (or no additional treatment) over 3 weeks with varied combinations of additional SMT and exercise co-interventions. It is important to distinguish the factorial design from an 8-arm trial. The factorial 
approach evaluates the main effects of the 3 additional intervention components (additional 
SMT, mobilizing and multifidus activating exercise) and interactions among components. It does not compare [ADDRESS_807462] treatment arms and thus is more efficient with a smaller sample size relative to an 8-arm randomized trial. 
Our primary hypothesis is that one or more co mbination of treatment components will optimize 
improvement in SMT mechanistic effects (reduct ion in spi[INVESTIGATOR_608867]) as well as improvement in patient-centered outcomes (LBP-related 
disability and pain intensity). Our secondary hypothesis is that responder status after [ADDRESS_807463] 95% retention at 4-weeks. We estimated standard deviations 
of each outcome based on patients in a similar project with analogous eligibility criteria, and conservatively estimated pre-post correlations to be 4%-7% smaller than the values in this study. Assuming a sample size of 316, of which 280 meet all eligibility criteria and 92% of enrolled participants are retained to [ADDRESS_807464] sizes for a) main effects of each protocol component, b) pairwise interactions between components, c) 
comparison of mean outcome between two levels of one component at a fixed level of another 
component, d) main effects of the 3 components in subgroup analyses involving half the participants, and e) pairwise interactions between [ADDRESS_807465] 80% power to detect the MCID or hypothesized effect sizes for the main effects of each component for all outcomes,
 and for analyses  of main 
effects  in subgroups and  conditional comparisons for each outcome except global stiffness. 
Power is more limited for secondary aims, such as pairwise interactions within subgroups.

9.2.[ADDRESS_807468]. Greene, Director of the 
Study Design and Biostatistics Center  at the University of Utah. Blocked randomization with block 
sizes of 4 or 6 will be used. Randomization will be stratified based on site (Utah or Alberta) and 
responder status after [ADDRESS_807469] 
or research assistant. Follow-up assessments will be performed by a Research Assistant who will 
be blind to subjects’ treatment assignments. Clin icians providing treatment cannot be blinded. 
The use of standardized protocols for all treatments and clinician-compliance audits throughout 
the project will minimize potential bias related to differential treatment application. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_608868]. 
9.3  Definition of Populations 
Intention-to-treat principles will be used with all participants analyzed in their randomized group regardless of compliance. We will compare compliance between groups and “per-protocol” secondary analyses may be considered if non-compliance is high or disproportionate between 
groups. A compliant treatment epi[INVESTIGATOR_608869] 80% of study sessions 
based on randomized group. 
9.[ADDRESS_807470] are each 
collected at baseline, 1-week, 4-week and 3-month assessments.   
Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (OSW): The OSW is a LBP-specific measure of function for 
patients with LBP assessed on a 0-[ADDRESS_807471] reliability (ICC
 = 0.90), good construct 
validity, and responsiveness to change for patients with LBP, with a minimum clinically important difference (MCID) of 6 points.   
Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS): A 0-10 NPRS (‘0’ no pain, and ‘10’ worst imaginable pain) 
will be used to assess LBP intensity.  The NPRS has excellent test-retest reliability. Our previous research has found the NPRS to be responsive to change with an MCID of 2 points for acute LBP.   
Spi[INVESTIGATOR_608870] : Spi[INVESTIGATOR_608871] a mechanically-assisted indentation device 
developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kawchuk and used in our previous research. The device consists of a motorized indentation probe supported by [CONTACT_608892]. The probe contains a compressive-tension load cell
 (Entran,  Fairfield,  NJ) connected in-series with the probe. Displacement of the probe is 
measured  by a linear variable differential transformer  (Honeywell  International Inc.,  Morristown,  
NJ) attached between the probe and its external  housing. Signals from the load cell and 
transformer are collected by [CONTACT_608893] (National Instruments, Austin, TX) at a collection rate of [ADDRESS_807472] Guidelines and Considerations 24 of 29 Version 1.5 
  May 2018 for analysis. Indentation data (force and displacement) are used to calculate stiffness variables.  
Global stiffness  (GS) (N) is calculated as the slope of the force displacement curve between 5  - 
60 N, representing stiffness of underlying tissues during indentation. Terminal stiffness  (TS)  
(N/mm)  represents peak  applied force  and resultant displacement of underlying tissues. We have 
found excellent  within-  and between-day reliability of stiff ness measures made with this device 
(ICC  = 0.98-0.99). A safety switch is provided to the subject and assessor that raises the 
indentation probe immediately if pressed, providing additional safety features.  
Lumbar Multifidus Muscle Activation:  Multifidus activation will be measured with brightness-mode 
ultrasound images using a 60mm, 2-[ADDRESS_807473] lifting the contralateral 
arm about 2 inches while holding a weight proportional to body weight.  Images are acquired at 
the end of exhalation to minimize effects of respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  Three images in each state are acquired 
and averaged.  Images are stored and measured offline by a blinded rater using NIH (Bethesda,  
MD) Image J software (V1 .38t). Offline  multifidus thickness measures are obtained from 
determining the distance between the posterior-most aspect of the facet joint inferiorly  and the 
plane  between  the multifidus  and thoracolumbar  fascia superior. Activation is calculated as the 
change in thickness from rest  to submaximal  contraction  (Thickness contract –Thickness rest)  / 
Thickness rest). Research has shown these measures of multifidus activation have good concurrent 
validity compared to EMG activity of the muscle.  
9.6 Data Analyses  
Primary Aim 1 : Spi[INVESTIGATOR_608872]-primary  outcomes for evaluating 
effects of SMT protocol components on SMT mechanisms. The effect of intervention components 
(A additional SMT; B multifidus activation; C mobilizing exercises) on each outcome will be 
evaluated using linear mixed models to relate mean levels of each outcome at 1-, 4-weeks and 
3-months to indicator variables to represent the main effects of each interventions  (A, B, C) as 
well as each pairwise interaction between the interventions (A  x B, A  x C, B  x C) and the 3-way 
interaction  (A  x B  x C). 1-week assessment, which occurs just before randomization, will serve as 
the baseline for these analyses and the model will be assumed equal between the randomized groups. This model, sometimes referred to as a constrained longitudinal model,
 leads to 
adjustment for baseline levels as in analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), which has been shown to 
remove conditional bias in treatment group co mparisons due to chance imbalances and improve 
statistical power over unadjusted comparisons. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to account for correlation of serially measured outcome scores in the same subject. By [CONTACT_608894], the model will constitute a special case of a general linear mixed 
model which avoids imposing specific assumptions concerning distribution of random effects. This modelling approach is recommended in randomized trials when the number of follow-up outcome assessments is small. Restricted maximum likelihood estimation will be used for estimation of parameters and their associated standard errors. 
 
Linear mixed effects analysis will provide estimates and CIs for the following quantities for each  
outcome  at both 4-week  and 3-month assessments: a)  Main effects evaluating effects of each of 
the 3 interventions while averaging over the levels of the other 2 interventions. b)  Three pairwise 
interactions  evaluating  if the  effect of  an intervention  differs between  levels  of another  
interventions, while averaging over levels of the 3rd intervention. Pairwise interactions will inform 
whether  the effects  of each intervention pair  are additive,  synergistic  or antagonistic. c)  3-way 
interaction evaluating if each pairwise interaction differs depending on the 3rd intervention. 
Study Product Guidelines and Considerations [ADDRESS_807474] of 
each intervention conditional on the presence or absence of the other intervention. To account 
for 2 primary outcomes, each of the hypothesis tests noted above will be performed with 2-sided 
α=0.025 and confidence intervals will be constructed using a confidence coefficient of 0.975. The 
indicated comparisons at 4-weeks will be given prim ary emphasis in evaluating the effects of each 
intervention. Comparisons at 3-months will evaluate  persistence of effects following intervention.  
Primary  Aim #2: The OSW and NPRS will be co-primary outcomes for evaluating the effects of 
the 3 SMT protocol components on patient centered outcomes. The same analytic approach described above will be used. To account for 2 outcomes, we will again apply a 2-sided α=0.05 
and 97.5% CIs for statistical inference. 
Secondary Aim #1: It is unknown how early SMT response may affect response to additional 
intervention. We will examine this question by [CONTACT_608895] [ADDRESS_807475] for responder status and interaction terms 
between responder status and the indicator variables for treatments (and treatment combinations) which are retrained in the final simplified models for the different outcomes developed using the BIC criteria for each of the co-primary outcomes for the primary aims [ADDRESS_807476] and/or interaction terms 
between treatment intervention components will be interpreted as suggesting effect moderation. 
Recognizing that tests for interactions have limited statistical power, we will also fit the simplified models developed in Aims 1 and 2 separately under the presence and absence of each factor (dichotomizing using a median split for continuous factors), and graphically display the estimated treatment effects at both levels of responder status. Recognizing the potential for lower statistical power, the results of Secondary Aim #1 will be interpreted as exploratory.   
Secondary Aim #2: In order to assess which intervention component combinations provide 
optimal outcomes, we will first simplify the fully saturated factorial analysis of variance model by 
[CONTACT_608896] (B IC) among all possible models including different 
combinations of main effects, pairwise interactions and the 3-way interaction which satisfy the hierarchical consistency constraint that the main effects corresponding to each term in a pairwise 
interaction are retained in models with pairwise interactions, and all component main effects and 
pairwise interactions are retained when considering the 3-way interaction. This will result in a more parsimonious model to increase statistical power. Then, using the simplified model, for each 
outcome we will use a simulation
 approach  to derive simultaneous 97.5%  CIs for all comparisons  
of estimated mean outcome under each possible treatment combinations (No further treatment, A, B, C, A
 x B, A  x C, B  x C, A  x B x C). After ordering the treatment combinations in accordance with 
the observed mean outcome, the simultaneous CIs will be used to identify which combinations are statistically indistinguishable from the optimum treatment, thus identifying a set of candidate options for the best combination of treatments. This process will be applied for both mechanistic and patient-centered outcomes. We anticipate that more than one combination will be considered optimal for different outcomes, and that the combinations that are optimal will differ for different 
outcome measures. Our interpretation of optimiz ed protocols will give preference to longer term 
outcomes (ie, 3-month scores) and patient-centered outcomes. We will also consider an 
application of the robust modelling approach to derive a model for the optimum combination of components as a multivariate function which jointly incorporates each the potential effect modification of week [ADDRESS_807477] Guidelines and Considerations 26 of 29 Version 1.5

10.1 Data Collection Forms  
Participant-reported measures will be collected via REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), 
an NIH-supported, browser-based, software solution that allows researchers to create secure online forms for data capture, management and analysis. At each assessment participants will input data directly into REDCap. If a participant is unable to directly input data, paper forms will 
be available with data uploaded at a later time. Self-report data will be downloaded from REDCap 
and integrated with mechanistic and physical examination data by [CONTACT_608897]. A research assistant blinded to the participant’s randomly-assigned treatment group will conduct the assessments to avoid bias. Confidentiality of participant’s records will be protected by [CONTACT_608898], password-protected computers. 
The database for this study will be kept on a server  supplied by [CONTACT_608899] (UUHSC). The UUHSC utilizes tec hnology from Hitachi Data Systems called the 
Universal Storage Platform for providing a virtualized storage area network. This network is maintained on a server by [CONTACT_608900]. All programming for the analyses will also be stored on the same server and coordinated through the University of Utah SDBC. 
Source documents not stored elec tronically will be maintained in locked cabinets within the 
personal offices of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_608873].  
10.[ADDRESS_807478] provides informed consent to participate 
in the study, the Study Coordinator will create a new Patient Profile in REDCap. The Patient Profile will be identified by [CONTACT_608901], and will not contain the patient’s name, Social Security number, or any other type of Pers onal Health Information data that could be used 
to identify the individual patient. The link between the Patient Identifier and the subject’s Personal 
Health Information will be maintained by [CONTACT_32366], and will be available only to the Study 
Coordinators and Investigators. After the Patient Profile is created, the subject will be able to input all self-report data directly into REDCap using a computer or laptop using a web-based interface. All
 data entered by [CONTACT_608902]. For 
participants who are unable to complete online data forms, paper forms will be provided. 
 
All self-report subject data will be collected using the REDCap data collection platform. Additional 
subject information (e.g., informed consent documents, demographic and physical examination 
forms completed by [CONTACT_19908] ) will be entered into REDCap by [CONTACT_608903]. The University of Utah Study Design and 
Biostatistics Center (SDBC) at the University of  Utah Center for Clinical and Translational Science 
(CCTS) will download study data monthly once enrollm ent begins. This information will not include 
any patient identifying information.

 1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1 Primary Objectives  
 To compare the overall survival  (OS) of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with stable 
disease on FOLFIRIN OX who then receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_132] -CSF t ransfected 
pancreatic tumor vaccine  to patients who continue to receive FOLFIRINOX. 
 1.2 Secondary Objectives  
 1.2.1 To evaluate safety  and characterize toxicities , specifically immune -related adverse events, 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_133] -CSF transfected pancreatic t umor 
vaccine in patients  with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  
 
1.2.2 To assess progression -free survival (PFS) , immune -related progression -free survival 
(irPFS), and duration of response in patients receiving treatment. 
 
1.2.[ADDRESS_112] and immune -related response criteria  in 
patients receiving treatment.  
 1.2.4 To measure tumor marker kine tics (CA 19 -9) in patients receiving treatment.  
 
 1.[ADDRESS_113] 
treatment samples may identify additional therapeutic targets.  
 1.4 Study Design  
 This study is a randomized phase II study to compare the overall survival of patients with stable  
metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma on FOLFIRINOX who then receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_134] (IPI) and 
the allogeneic GM -CSF transfected pancreatic t umor vaccine to patients who continue to receive 
FOLFIRINOX.   
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_114] the 
required  8-12 doses. If the patient has stable disease (SD) or better after the 8th dose, they can be 
considered for the study.  No more than 12 prior doses of FOLFIRINOX will be allowed.  Of note, 
the median number of cycles given in the FOLFIRINOX study was 10 cycles (range 1-47).  Patients will be stratified based on the number of cycles of FOLFIRINOX (8 cycles or > 8 cycles) and by [CONTACT_384]. 
 
Patients will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A ( Vaccine  + IPI) or Arm B (continue chemotherapy).  
Patients on Arm B will be encouraged to stay on FOLFIRINOX  every [ADDRESS_115] of care practice.   
 
Patients who are randomized  will be considered in the final analysis . Subjects who drop out of the 
study due to reasons other than disease  progression, death, or toxicity may be replaced  at the 
discretion of the sponsor .  Subjects whose death is unequivocally accidental and unrelated to 
cancer or its treatment may also be replaced.  
 
Trea tment and Assessment Plan. Patients on Arm A will receive Vaccine + IPI [INVESTIGATOR_135] 3 weeks x 4 
doses then Vaccine + IPI [INVESTIGATOR_135] 8 weeks.  Patients that begin treatment on study after approval of 
protocol version 6.0 will receive IPI [INVESTIGATOR_136] a dose of 3 mg/kg given intravenously (IV).  Arm A patients 
that received  treatment  prior to approval of protocol version 6.0 will continue to receive IPI [INVESTIGATOR_136] a 
dose of 10mg/kg. The Vaccine contains 5 x 10
8cells and will be administered intradermally ( see 
schema ).  Arm A treatments will be administered at Weeks  1, 4, 7, and 10.  Disease status will be 
assessed at Weeks 1, 10, and 18.  Patients who are clinically stable may stay on study.  At the Week [ADDRESS_116] had evidence of a response or stabilization of disea se will 
be offered a continuation of therapy where they will receive IPI [INVESTIGATOR_137] 8 weeks  until 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients that are required to stop treatment with IPI [INVESTIGATOR_138] 
(200 mg/m
2) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients on Arm A will not receive 
concurrent chemotherapy.  Patients on Arm B will continue to receive FOLFIRINOX on day [ADDRESS_117] protocols and continue based on response and tolerability.  If patients choose to resume care with their primary oncologists, this will be allowed but data on treatments, response, and survival will continue to be collected.  
 
On Arm A, p eripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and serum will be c ollected with each treatment 
for evaluation of immune responses (e.g. mesothelin- specific T cell responses).  On Arm B, PBLs 
and serum will be collected at bas eline and after [ADDRESS_118] treatment tumor biopsies 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017

 will be collected ( if a patient’s tumor is thought to be reasonably safe and easy to biopsy) to assess 
tumor characteristics and immune infiltrates.  Additional optional biopsies may be obtained later 
in the course of therapy in responding patients.  Biopsies will be considered optional in Arm B.  Furthermore, given that the patients will be responding to chemotherapy on enrollment, it may be difficult to find tumors that can be easily biopsied. 
 
For purposes of determining unacceptable toxicity during the initial  18 week treatment phase, 
patients  on Arm A  will be followed for drug related > grade 4 AEs or grade 3 AE including IRAEs 
not improving to < grade 2 under therapy within 2 weeks.  In additi on, > grade 2 eye pain or 
reduction of visual acuity that does not respond to topi[INVESTIGATOR_139] < grade 
1 severity within 2 weeks of starting therapy, or requires systemic therapy is an unacceptable toxicity.  The unacceptable toxicit y rate will be continuously monitored and should not be > 33%.  
Patients that are receiving a continuation of therapy every 8 weeks will also be continuously 
monitored for unacceptable toxicities. If the rate of unacceptable toxicities in these patients is  
greater than 33%, then the continuation of treatment will be extended to [ADDRESS_119] will occur every 12 weeks (or until study termination) to evaluate OS, PD, subsequent 
cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and AEs . Adverse events [ADDRESS_120] dose of investigational agent (Arm 
A) will only be recorded if deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent.  Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  2. BACKGROUND

aggressive chemotherapy regimen, FOLFIRINOX (5 -flourouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin), median 
survival is 11 months  (Conroy et al , 2011).  Novel approaches, such as immunotherapy, are 
showing promise in this very difficult cancer.    2.2 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_140] (MDX -010, MDX -CTLA4, BMS -734016) is being developed by [CONTACT_385]- Myers -Squibb (BMS) .  On March 25, 2011, the 
FDA  approved ipi[INVESTIGATOR_141] (YERVOY, BMS) for the treatment of unresectable or 
metastatic melanoma.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_142] a human IgG
1κ monoclonal antibody (mAb); it is specific 
for human cytotoxic T lymphocyte -associated antigen -4 (CTLA -4, CD152) expressed on activated 
T cells.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_143] (CHO) cells.   
 
CTLA -4 is a negative regulator of T -cell responses following T -cell stimulation (Thompson and 
Allison, 1997; Kuhns et al., 2000).  CTLA -4 knockout mice suffer from a fatal lymphoproliferative 
disorder, supporting the idea that CTLA-4 functions as a negative regulator of T- cell responses in

 vivo (Tivol et al., 1995; Waterhouse et al., 1995; Chambers et al., 1997).  Disrupting CTLA -4 
interaction with its ligands B7 -1 (CD80) and B7- 2 (CD86), which are expressed on antigen-
presenting cells (APCs), with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], augments immune responses (Investigator Brochure, 
2011).  In vivo  blockade of CTLA -4, utilizing anti -CTLA -4 mAb, induced regression of 
established tumors and enhanced antitumor immune responses in several murine tumor models.  Blockade of CTLA -4-mediated signals is effective in inducing re jection of immunogenic cancers 
in mice.  Moreover, when anti -CTLA -4 mAb is used in conjunction with granulocyte macrophage -
colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF) -secreting tumor vaccines, poorly immunogenic cancers in 
mice are rejected.  These findings suggest  that CTLA -[ADDRESS_122] with CTLA -4 in non-human 
primates including cynomolgus monkeys.  Blockade of CTLA -4/B7 interactions enhanced T -cell 
responses to CD3 / CD28, peptide antigens, or superantigens in mice (Walunas,  et al., 1994; 
Kearney, et al., 1995; Krummel and Allison 1995; Krummel, Sullivan, and Allison, 1996).  CTLA -
[ADDRESS_123] spontaneously activated T cells evident at approximately 1 week after birth, followed  by [CONTACT_386].  These mice die at 
approximately 3 weeks of age, either as a result of polyclonal T -cell expansion and tissue 
destruction or as a result of toxic shock resulting from lymphokine production.  Genetically engineered mice heterozygous for CTLA -4 (CTLA -4+/-), appeared healthy and gave birth to 
healthy CTLA -4+/- heterozygous offspring.  Mated CTLA -4+/- heterozygous mice also produced 
offspring deficient in CTLA -4 (homozygous negative, CTLA -4-/-).  Since thymoc yte 
differentiation and selection proceed normally in CTLA -4-deficient mice, the rampant T -cell 
expansion that occurs in the mice indicates that CTLA -[ADDRESS_124]- thymic T -cell responses in the periphery following stimulation of naïve, memory, and 
effector T cells (Krummel, Sullivan, and Allison, 1996).   
 
Pharmacokinetics  
 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_144] 499 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received doses of 0.3, 3, or 10 mg/kg administered once every 3 weeks (q3w) for four doses.  Peak concentration (Cmax), trough concentration (Cmin), and area under the curve (AUC) of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_145].  Upon repeated dosing of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_146] q3w, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_147] -invariant, and minimal systemic accumulation was observed as evident by [CONTACT_387] 1.5- fold or less.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_148]- state concentration was reached by [CONTACT_388].  The f ollowing mean (percent coefficient of variation) parameters were generated 
through population PK analysis: terminal half -life of 14.7 days (30.1%); systemic clearance (CL) 
of 15.3 mL/h (38.5%); and volume of distribution at steady- state (Vss) of 7.21 L (10.5%).  The 
mean (±SD) ipi[INVESTIGATOR_149] -state with the 3 -mg/kg regimen was 21.8 
mcg/mL (±11.2).

Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_152]; however, no dose  adjustment of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_153] a mg/kg basis. 
 
The following factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the CL of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]: age (range 26 to 86 years), gender, concomitant use of budesonide, performance status, HLA -A2*0201 status, 
positive anti -ipi[INVESTIGATOR_154], prior use of systemic anticancer therapy, or baseline 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels.  The effect of race was not examined as there were insufficient numbers of patients in non- Caucasian ethnic groups. 
 
Renal Impairment: Creatinine clearance at baseline did not have a clinically important effect on 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_155] 29 mL/min or greater.  
Hepatic Impairment : Baseline AST, total bilirubin, and ALT levels did not have a clinically 
important effect on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_156].

In a study using cynomolgus macaques, anti -melanocyte responses  were observed in animals given 
up to four doses of 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_157] a melanoma cell vaccine ( Keler  et al., 
2003).  Depi[INVESTIGATOR_158]  (Hara et al., 1995; Naftzger  et al., 1996; Bloom et al., 1997; 
Overwijk  et al., 1998; Weber et al., 1998; Overwijk  et al., 1999) .  The symptoms in animals appear 
to resemble vitiligo observed in clinical immunotherapy trials of melanoma patients and may be 
an unavoidable consequence of treatment (Rosenberg and White, 1996). 
 
Additional repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted using cynomolgus macaques demonstrated that the IV administration of ≤30 mg/kg every 3 days for three doses, 10 mg/kg weekly for 1 month, 1 
mg/kg weekly for 10 weeks, or 10 mg/kg monthly for 6 months was generally well tolerated, without significant clinical, immunotoxicological, or histopathological findings (Investigator Brochure, 2011).  However, when ipi[INVESTIGATOR_159] (BMS -663513, a fully human anti -CD137 mAb) and simian 
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) DNA , two immune -related adverse events (irAEs) were observed:  
severe colitis requiring euthanasia in one monkey and re versible dermatitis/rash in the inguinal 
area and peripheral lymphadenopathy in another monkey.

 Renal cell carcinoma (RCC)  
Yang and colleagues presented data on a phase 2 study of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_161] (Yang et al., 2007).   Sequential cohorts received either 3 mg/kg followed by 1 
mg/kg or all doses at 3 mg/kg q3w.  One of 21 patients receiving the lower dose had a PR.  Five 
of 40 patients at the higher dose had PRs (95% CI, cohort response rate 4 to 27%) and responses were seen in patients who had previously not responded to IL -2.  Thir ty-three percent of patients 
experienced grade 3 or 4 irAEs.  There was a highly significant association between autoimmune events and tumor regression (response rate = 30% with AE, 0% without AE).  The authors concluded that CTLA -4 blockade with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b induced cancer regression in some patients with 
metastatic clear cell renal cancer, even if they had not responded to other immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].   
 
Melanoma (ipi[INVESTIGATOR_163])  
At the 2011 ASCO meeting Hodi and colleagues presented results on 21 evaluable patients (22 patients enrolled) with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma treated with the combination of 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164] 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab on a phase 1 study (Hodi et al ., 2011).  AEs  
included giant cell arteritis (1), hypophysitis (3), thyroiditis (4), grade 3 -4 hepatitis (2), bilateral 
uveitis (2), and grade 2 colitis (2); 5 patients required systemic steroids and stopped treatment.  All toxicities were resolved.  Eight PRs and 6 SDs were observed.  All responses were durable  (>6 
months).  Post -treatment biopsies in 12 patients revealed activated vessel endothelium with 
extensive T -cell trafficking non- productive central angiogenesis, and peripheral blood monitoring 
revealed a marked increase in CD4/CCR7/CD45RO central memory cells in the majority of 
patients,  not seen with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165].  The authors concluded that the combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_166].  
 
Bladder cancer  
Carthon and colleagues  reported immunomo dulatory effects following a brief exposure of anti -
CTLA -4 in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder requiring surgery (BMS study 
CA184027) ( Carthon et al., 2010).  12 patients were enrolled (6 patients  received 3 mg/kg/dose of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_167] 6 patients received 10 mg/kg/dose for two doses prior to surgery).  The treatment was found to be tolerable in the cohort of patients with [ADDRESS_126] common drug- related AEs.  The 
only noted grade 3 irAEs were ischemic papi[INVESTIGATOR_168], which were both responsive to treatment with steroids.   
 
Liakou and colleagues found that CD4 T cells from peripheral blood and tumor tissues of all bladder cancer patients treated with anti -CTLA -4 antibody had markedly increased expression of 
inducible costimulator (ICOS) ( Liakou et al., 2008).  These CD4
+ICOShi T cells produced 
interferon -gamma (IFN -γ) and could recognize the tumor a ntigen NY -ESO -1.  Increase in 
CD4+ICOShi cells led to an increase in the ratio of effector to regulatory T cells.  The authors 
indicated that these immunologic changes were reported in both tumor tissues and peripheral blood as a result of treatment with anti- CTLA -4 antibody, and they may be used to guide dosing and 
scheduling of this agent to improve clinical responses.  A sustained increased frequency of CD4
+ICOShi T cells may serve as a biomarker of anti -CTLA -4 activity and/or of clinical benefit 
for patients who are being treated with this novel agent ( Carthon et  al., 2010).

 Pancreatic cancer  
Royal and colleagues presented the results on 27 patients (metastatic disease: 20 and locally advanced: 7) (Royal et al ., 2010).  Three subjects experienced ≥ grade 3 irAEs (colitis:1, 
encephalitis:1, hypophysitis:1).  One subject experienced a delayed response after initial 
progressive disease.  In this subject, new metastases after 2 doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_169].  However, continued administration of the agent per protocol resul ted in 
significant delayed regression of the primary lesion and 20 hepatic metastases with normalization of tumor markers and clinically significant improvement of performance status.  The investigators concluded that single agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3.0 mg/kg/dose was ineffective for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.  However, a significant delayed response in one subject of this trial suggests that immunotherapeutic approaches to pancreatic cancer deserve further exploration. 
 
CTEP -Sponsored Studies  
 
The DCTD, NCI, has sponsored nine studies with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_171] (NCI #5744, lymphoma), three phase 1 studies (5708 [ovarian], 6082 [solid tumors], and 7458 [solid tumors]), one phase 1/2 study (6359 [non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma]) with single agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], 
two phase 1 combination studies in prostate cancer with GM -CSF (6032) and with prostate -
specific antigen (PSA) -TRICOM vaccine (7207), one phase 2 combination study of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_172] -CSF (E1608, melanoma) and one phase 3 study (E1609) of adjuvant ipi[INVESTIGATOR_173]-dose interferon alpha-2b in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.   
 
Results from 11 patients (colon, n=3; non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma, n=4; prostate, n=4) who received 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_174] 5744 included tumor regression in 2 patients with lymphoma; 1 of whom (follicular lymphoma patient) had a partial response (PR) of 14- month duration (O’Mahony et al., 
2007).  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_175] 1/2 toxicities.  One drug -related 
grade 3 A E was observed.  Tregs, as detected by [CONTACT_389]4
+CD25+CD62L+, declined at 
early time points but rebounded to levels at or above baseline values at the time of the next infusion.  The investigators concluded that ipi[INVESTIGATOR_176] -specific 
CD8+ T -cell responses in these patients previously treated with a variety of investigational 
anticancer vaccines.   
 
Hodi and colleagues reported preliminary results on 20 patients (11 metastatic melanoma patients and 9 metastatic ovarian carcinoma patients) on study 5708 ( Hodi et al., 2008).  None of the 11 
patients from the metastatic melanoma cohort manifested grade 3 or 4 inflammatory toxicitie s; 
however, all subjects revealed mild inflammatory pathologies associated with low -level 
constitutional symptoms.  The most common toxicity (10/11 subjects) was a grade 1- 2 reticular 
and erythematous rash on the trunk and/or extremities that arose between 3 days and 3 weeks after 
antibody administration and then gradually resolved without specific intervention.  Biopsies of involved skin revealed low -grade interface dermatitis, minor to moderate mononuclear infiltrates 
surrounding the superficial dermal vasculature, and increased mucin deposition in the papi[INVESTIGATOR_177].  These pathologic features resembled those observed in mild cutaneous forms of systemic lupus erythematosis.  Three PRs (range, 21- 34+ months) and five events of stable 
diseas e (SD) (range, 4 -25 months) were observed.  One PR and three SDs (2, 4, and 6+ months) 
were observed in the ovarian carcinoma group.  The investigators concluded that selective

 targeting  of antitumor regulatory T cells (Treg) may constitute a complementary strategy for 
combination of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_178]- CSF-based antigen tumor cell vaccine therapy.  
 
Results from 29 patients with malignancies that were recurrent or progressive after allogeneic  
hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo -HCT) demonstrated that drug was well tolerated at single 
doses up to 3 mg/kg ( Bashey  et al., 2009).  Four patients experienced organ- specific irAEs of 
reversible grade 3 arthritis, grade 2 hyperthyroidism, dyspnea, and grade 4 pneumonitis.  Three 
patients had objective responses: one PR lasting for 2 months, and two durable complete responses 
(CRs).  Two additional patients with Hodgkin’s disease who had evidence of rapid disease progression prior to ipi[INVESTIGATOR_179] 3 and 6 months, following infusion at the 3 mg/kg dose level.  Median OS was 24.7 months.  At a 3.0 mg/kg dose, active serum 
concentrations of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_180] >30 days following a single infusion.  Zhou and 
colleagues r eported immunophenotypes of peripheral blood T cells, including T -cell 
reconstitution, activation, and Treg expression, in 29 patients before and after a single -dose 
infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (Zhou et al., 2011).  CTLA -4 blockade by a single infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_181]4
+ and CD4+HLA- DR+ T lymphocyte counts and intracellular CTLA -[ADDRESS_127] dose level (3.0 mg/kg).  There was no significant change in Treg cell numbers after 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_182].  These data demonstrate that significant ch anges in T -cell populations occur 
on exposure to a single dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].   
 
Harzstark and colleagues reported results on 36 patients  with hormone refractory metastatic 
prostate cancer (Harzstark  et al. , 2010) .  Of six patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] a dose of 3 
mg/kg, three patients had confirmed PSA declines of ≥50%, with a time to progression (TTP) of 22, 26, and 103 weeks.  One of these patients had a PR in hepatic  metastases.  Grade 3 IrAEs 
consisted of rash in five patients, panhypopi[INVESTIGATOR_183],  temporal  arteritis  in one 
patient, and diarrhea in three patients.  Non- irAEs  included grade 3 and 4 cerebrovascular events 
(one patient each), grade 3 angina (one patient), grade 3 atrial fibrillation (one patient), grade 3 fatigue (four patients), and grade 5 pulmonary embolism (one patient).  One patient treated at 10 mg/kg had a PSA decline of ≥50% with a TTP of 39 weeks.  Higher doses of treatment with MDX -
010 + GM -CSF induced the expansion of activated circulating CD25
+, CD69+, and CD8+ T cells 
more frequently than was seen in patients who received the same doses of either MDX -010 or 
GM-CSF alone (Fong et al ., 2009).  The sera screening with protein arrays showed that the 
treatment can induce antibody responses to the testicular antigen NY- ESO -1.   
 
Patients with metastatic prostate cancer were treated with ProstVac vaccine and  ipi[INVESTIGATOR_184].  The median OS for all patients on study was 31.8 months with a 74% survival probability at 24 months ( Madan  et al., 2010).  The median Halabi predicted OS for all patients 
was 18.5 months.  There was no significant difference in OS at different dose levels of antibody (range 1 -10 mg).  A unique effect of the vaccines on the rate of tumor growth may be a novel 
method to evaluate the anti- tumor effects of the vaccine ( Stein et al., 2011).  The authors suggested 
that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibition may augment the clinical benefit of vaccines.  
 
Ansell and colleagues reported data on 18 treated patients with NHL (Ansell et al., 2009).  Two 
clinical responses were observed:  one patient with diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (BCL) had an 
ongoing CR (>31 months), and one with follicular lymphoma had a PR lasting 19 months.  In 5 of 16 cases tested, T -cell proliferation to recall antigens was >2 fold increased after ipi[INVESTIGATOR_185] #: 9478

esults and Clinical Efficacy  
The clinical efficacy of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_188] a single agent at a dose of 3 mg/kg administered q3w for 4 doses has been established in MDX010- 20 (a randomized, controlled study in second line, 
locally advanced/metastatic melanoma), which led to approval of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_189].  In study CA184024, the addition of 10 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_190] a prolongation of

 overall survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma.   In melanoma studies, disease stabilization in subjects receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_191]-tumor activity.  Stable disease, sometimes of long duration, or slow steady decline of tumor 
lesion size over long periods of time, has been observed.  Some subjects demonstrate initial tumor volume increase before response, possibly due to T -cell infiltration as shown by [CONTACT_390].  Consequently, an initial determination of progressive disease and consequently PFS may not capture all patterns response and may underestimate the clinical activity of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  Please see section “ Considerations for Using Immune -Related 
Tumor Assessment Criteria (irRC).”  
 
MDX010 -20 (Phase 3, 3 mg/kg, previously treated melanoma) 
MDX010 -20, a randomized (3:1:1), double -blind, double -dummy study included 676 randomized 
subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma previously treated with one or more of the following: aldesleukin, dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, or carboplatin.  Of these 676 subjects, 403 were randomized to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg in combination with an 
investigational peptide vaccine with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (gp100), 137 were randomized to receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 3 mg/kg, and 136 were randomized to receive gp100 alone.  The study enrolled only subjects with HLA A2*0201 genotype; this HLA genotype facilitates the immune presentation of the investigational peptide vaccine.  The study excluded subjects with active autoimmune disease or those receiving systemic immunosuppression for organ transplantation. 
The OS resul ts are shown in the table below.

NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_131] not yet been determined, in proposed 
proof of principle studies demonstration of efficacy at 10 mg/kg would allow future studies to explore biologic and clinical efficacy at lower doses with reduced toxicity. For most studies in new combinations or settings, a short phase 1 component at 3 mg would be appropriate with a 5 or 6 mg/kg dose added as an additional cohort if needed.     
A recommended dose of 10 mg/kg is proposed by [CONTACT_391][INVESTIGATOR_125].  In melanoma, a similar survival benefit was demonstrated in phase 3 trials at the 3 mg/kg and at 10 mg/kg with DTIC.  However, the incidence of grade >3 toxicity was 15 and 25% respectively.   
 Based on Phase 2 studies, response rates of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_192] 10 mg/kg.   Exposure- response analyses [C
minss Analysis of PK data from patients treated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_170] 
0.3 mg/kg (N=47), 3 mg/kg (N=60) and 10 mg/kg (N=311)], showed that the target C minss target 
threshold of 20 mcg/ml was exceeded in 0%, 30% and 95% subjects respectively.  The slope of 
change in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) correlated with clinical benefit and T -cell activation 
markers such as HLA -class II expression may also be dose dependent.  Responses have not been 
compared systematically in randomized phase [ADDRESS_132], ipi[INVESTIGATOR_193] a dose of 10 mg/kg given concomitantly or following

 initial paclitaxel/carboplatin.  When used in the phased schedule, 10 mg/kg significantly improved 
irPFS and mWHO defined responses but not PFS determined by [CONTACT_392] (RECIST).  There also was a trend for an improvement in OS in both indications.  
Doses less than 10 mg/kg have not been evaluated in either NSCLC or SCLC.   Studies comparing doses in non- melanoma and combinations have not been widely done.  There 
are also no clear data that peak levels, Cmin, AUC, exposure and number of doses given, or the occurrence of autoimmune events, predict responses in individual patients.  We note that the incidence of specific events such as hypophysitis may vary from study to study and with different combinations of agents.  The severity and possibly time to onset but not necessarily the frequency of events increases with dose.  In addition, there are rare but serious events such as toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194] (TEN) for which a dose relationship has not been established. Case report forms should include data on the prior treatment, timing, number of doses, duration of event, response to 
treatment, and complications to allow comparisons among studies.    Considerations in Using Immune -Related Tumor Assessment Criteria (irRC)  
 New end point definitions for trials of immunologic agents have been proposed based on novel patterns of clinical activity in malignant melanoma ( Wolchok, et al. 2009; Hoos, et al.   2010) . 
These alternative definitions allow time for immunologically  mediated effectors to develop that 
may result in late tumor responses even after initial progression by [CONTACT_393].  Also, in some patients, tumors necrosis and inflammation may increase tumor size radiographically prior to response.  Changing the definitions  of OR and PD may alter (increase) the number patients 
achieving responses and the duration of PFS.   On a protocol by [CONTACT_394], we would consider allowing study treatment to continue during initial progression up to the 12- [ADDRESS_133] definitions of progression and response, we would allow new lesions and some progression beyond 20% increases in tumor measurements during the initial treatment period to allow time for responses to develop (these delayed tumor responses may be seen in 10- 20% of melanoma patients who initially progress during the initi al 
treatment cycles and evaluation).We do not have experience with response patterns with combination therapy nor in diseases other than melanoma.    Note that the proposed irRC have been incorporated as secondary end points in addition to standard 
criteri a and evaluate alternative patterns of response in various disease setting and treatment 
regimens.  A copy of the proposed criteria is presented in Appendix A.  
 Patients who demonstrate mixed responses, stable disease, or objective responses by [CONTACT_395] “delayed SD, PR, or CR”.    Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 The unique immune -based mechanism of action is reflected in the clinical patterns of anti -cancer 
activity in some patients.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_195], and measurable clinical effects

 emerge after the immunological effects.  Tumor infiltration with lymphocytes and the associated 
inflammation (documented by [CONTACT_396]) is likely the cornerstone of the effect of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_196].  In some cases, response may be preceded by [CONTACT_397]/or the 
appearance of new lesions, which may be mistaken for tumor progression on radiological evaluations.  Therefore, in subjects who are not experiencing rapid clinical deterioration, confirmation of progression is recommended, at the investigator’s discretion, to better understand 
the prognosis as well as to avoid unnecessarily initiating potentially toxic alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_197].  Immune -related (ir) response criteria were 
developed based on these observations to systematically categorize novel patterns of clinical activity and are currently being prospectively evaluated in clinical studies.  In metastatic diseases, stabilization is more common than response, and in some instances is 
associated with slow, steady decline in tumor burden over many months, sometimes improving to partial and/or complete responses.  Thus, the immune -based mechanism of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_198], sometimes with novel patterns of response, which contribute to its improvement in OS.  
 The immune -based mechanism of action is also reflected in the safety profile.  The most common 
drug- related AEs are immune- mediated, consistent with the me chanism of action of the drug and 
generally medically manageable with topi[INVESTIGATOR_199]/or systemic immunosuppressants.  As previously discussed, the immune -mediated adverse reactions primarily involve the GI tract, skin, liver, 
endocrine glands, and nervous sys tem. 
 The early diagnosis of immune -mediated adverse reactions is important to initiate therapy and 
minimize complications.  Immune -mediated adverse reactions are generally manageable using 
symptomatic or immunosuppressive therapy as recommended through detailed diagnosis and management guidelines, as described fully in the current IB.  The management guidelines for general immune -mediated adverse reactions and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]- related GI toxicities, hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy, and neuropathy are provided in the appendices of the current IB.   2.[ADDRESS_134] been identified that are over expressed in 
pancreatic cancer such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), mutated k -ras, mucin -1 (MUC1) and 
gastri n (Hruban, et al, 1993; Apostolopoulos, et al, 1994; Hammarstrom, et al, 1999; Harris, et al, 
2004) . However, these antigens are relatively non-i mmunogenic. Strategies have included 
immunization with co -administered immune modulating agents such as GM -CSF or alternative 
delivery mechanisms such as antigen -pulsed dendritic cell s (Marshall, et al, 2005). Significant 
clinical responses have not been d emonstrated. This may be due to immune tolerance mechanisms,

effective in inducing anti -tumor immunity (Dranoff, et al, 1993) . GM -CSF is an important growth 
and differentiation factor for dendritic cells, which are potent antigen- presenting cells.  
 The use of allogeneic tumor cells for vaccine development over  autologous tumor cells is attractive 
for several reasons. Autologous tumor cells are not always available and the production of an autologous vaccine is technically difficult, costly, and inefficient. Supporting the use of allogeneic tumor cells is the ch aracterization of tumor -associated antigens in melanoma, which revealed that 
regardless of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type, 50% of tumors share common antigens (Cox, et al, 1994; Kawakami, et al, 1994). In addition, both preclinical and human data support that the 
antigen -presenting cells important in GM- CSF based vaccination are host -derived suggesting that 
the vaccine cells and the host do not have to be HLA compatibl e (Huang, et al, 1994; Huang, et 
al, 1996).
 
 
Three clinical trials have been completed , with s even  clinical trials ongoing  or under analysis ,

other targeted interventions in patients with resected and metastatic pancreatic cancer. Altogether, 400+ patients have been treated , the majority at doses of 5x10

pancreatic cancer, and its safety given alone and in combination with a number of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy. Immunized lymphocytes from treated patients are being used as an approach for identifying “immune relevant” pancreatic cancer antigens. Below is 
a summary of the [ADDRESS_137] the hypothesis that the allogeneic GM -CSF transfected 
pancreatic t umor vaccine can prime a systemic immune response in subjects with resected 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Jaffee, et al , 2001). Fourteen subjects  with stage II or III disease

vaccination. Toxicities were limited to grade I/II local reactions at the vaccine site, and self -limited 
systemic rashes, including one documented case of Grover's syndrome.  Systemic GM -CSF levels 
were evaluated as an indirect measure of the longevity of vaccine cells at the immunizing site. As was observed in pre -clinical studies, GM -CSF levels peaked at 48 hours following vaccination.  In 
addition, serum GM - CSF levels coul d be detected for up to 96 hours following vaccination. These

vaccination DTH responses to autologous tumor cells were observed in 1 of 3 subjects receiving 1X 10
8 and in 2 of 5 subjects receiving 5X108 vaccine cells.  
 
2.3.3 Follow- up phase II study integrating the whole cell vaccine with chemoradiation for 
resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma  
 Johns Hopkins has also completed a follow -up phase II study of 60 patients with resected 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma based on the results of their phase I experience (Lutz, et al, 2011) . The 
highest dose of vaccine from the phase I study (5 X 10
8 vaccine cells) was  used and the adjuvant 
chemotherapy regimen given in sequence with the vaccine was modified to eliminate mitomycin-C as this drug was thought to depress immune function as measured by a decrease in vaccine induced mesothelin specific T cells following chemoradiation.  The common toxicities associated with the vaccine in this study included: local vaccine site skin reactions and systemic rashes similar in severity (grade 1 -2) to what was observed in the phase I trial. A full description of toxicities is 
provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. The results from this study include the following:  
 
• The administration of the whole cell vaccine is safe and well -tolerated. Treatment related side 
effects included transient vaccine injection site reactions.  
•  Systemic GM-CSF levels were evaluated as an indirect measure of the longevity of vaccine cells 
at the immunizing site. As was observed in the phase I study, GM -CSF levels peaked at [ADDRESS_140] the possibility that the potency 
of an allogeneic vaccine is diminished with repeated monthly vaccinations, but returns to pre -
treatment levels with an extended time interval between boosts.  
•  As recently reported, (88% node (+), 30% margin (+)) the median survival was 24.8 months. 
•  Post- Immunotherapy induction of mesothelin- specific CD8+ T cells with higher avidity and 
increased mesothelin epi[INVESTIGATOR_200] (T cell repertoire expansion) correlates with disease free survival (DFS).  
 The data also support additional boost immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_201].  
2.3.4 Phase II Trial of The GM -CSF Secreting, Allogeneic Vaccine Alone And in 
Sequence with Immune Modulating Doses of Cy in Patients with Stage 4 Pancreatic 
Cancer  
 Immune tolerance remains a major barrier to effective vaccine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. In particular, regulatory  
T cells (CD4
+CD25+) have been shown to play a role in inducing CD8+ T cell tolerance. 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
26 
 Manipulating the regulatory T cells may result in more effective vaccine strategies. In mouse 
models, immune modulating doses of Cyclophosphamide (Cy) in combination wit h GM -CSF 
based cell vaccines have been shown to improve tumor rejection from 0% to 10 - 30% in the HER -
2/neu transgenic mouse model. The addition of Cy allowed the activation of high-avidity 
RNEU 420-429-specific CD8+ T cells in the mice, which rejected tumor. This effect was abrogated 
by [CONTACT_398]4+CD25+ T cells derived from neu -N transgenic mice suggesting that Cy before vaccination 
may block T  regulatory cells allowing for recruitment of latent high- avidity neu- specific CD8+ 
T cell s (Ercolini, et al , 2005). 
 
A feasibility study of the GM -CSF-secreting, allogeneic vaccine administered alone or in sequence 
with Cy in patients with stage 4 pancreatic cancer, has been completed. This study was an open label study sponsored by [CONTACT_399], Inc. consisting of two cohorts:  Cohort A - 30 patients 
administered a maximum of six doses of vaccine using our two pancreatic cancer cell lines (2.5X 
10
8 of each cell line) intradermally at 21 day intervals; Cohort B - 20 patients administered Cy 250 
mg/m2 IV one day prior to each vaccination (administered as in Cohort A). The primary objective 
was to evaluate safety and efficacy of the vaccine administered alone or in sequence with Cy. 
Secondary objectives included:  time to disease progression (TTP), median overall survival (OS), and assessment of the feasibility of detecting mesothelin -specific T cell responses in pancreatic 
cancer patients with advanced disease (Laheru, et al, 2008). 
 First, the administration of a GM -CSF-secreting, allogeneic pancreatic tumor vaccine either alone 
or in sequence with Cy is feasible, safe, and tolerated by [CONTACT_400], 
the majority of which had received ≥ [ADDRESS_141] , 
stable disease lasting a median of 18 weeks was observed in 16.7% of patients treated in Cohort A and 40% of patients treated in Cohort B. Median survival in Cohort A and Cohort B were 2.3 
months and 4.3 months respectively in a patient population that had received > [ADDRESS_142] similar to GEM containing chemotherapy. In addition, mesothelin -specific 
CD8 + T cell responses can be detected in stage 4 patients treated with the vaccine and may 
correlate with time to progression and overall survival. Thus, these findings provide the scientific

Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_143] pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) include a multitude of immune tolerance mechanisms both at the systemic level and in the tumor microenvironment.  Combinatorial strategies aimed at priming tu mor antigen- specific T cells 
while simultaneously blocking negative immune checkpoints will be necessary to show an effect in PDA.  There is increasing interest in the role of immunotherapy in the treatment of cancers.  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (IPI, Yervoy), is an antagonist antibody to cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA -
4) which down- regulates T cell activation.   IPI [INVESTIGATOR_202] a 3.7 month improvement in overall survival (OS)  (Hodi, et al, 
2010).  Similarly, based on a 4.1 month survival benefit, Provenge vaccine has been approved for prostate cancer  (Kantoff, et al, 2010).  Another immune checkpoint blocker, anti -programmed 
death -1 (PD -1), is showing promising results in melanoma, renal cell, and lung cancer  (Topalian, 
et al, 2012).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_203], cancers like PDA are unlikely to respond 
to single agent therapy.  Unlike melanoma, few tumor infiltrating lymphocytes naturally develop in PDA, so that these agents have nothi ng to target.  Thus, vaccines are necessary to prime and 
expand tumor specific T cells at the time that these T cell activating agents are administered to cause PDA regression.  
 Pancreatic Tumor Vaccine Induces  Antigen -Specific T Cells.  The use of whole -cell vaccines is 
promising because it delivers a range of antigens without the need for specific knowledge of the relevant target antigens  (Dranoff, et al, 1993).  The vaccine consists of 2 allogeneic pancreatic 
tumor cell lines (Panc 6.03 and Panc 10.05) that have been modified with a plasmid vector encoding the cDNA for human granulocyte macrophage -colony stimulating factor (GM -CSF) and 
subsequently cultured and irradiated.  The GM -CSF simultaneously recruits and provides 
maturation signals to antigen- presenting cells (APC) to the local vaccine site.  APCs then 
orchestrate the immune response by [CONTACT_401].  A number of studies have been completed and are underway using the vaccine in the 
treatment of PDA  (Jaffee, et al, 2001; Laheru, et al, 2008; Lutz, et al, 2011).  The prior studies 
demonstrate that the vaccine is safe and that induction of T cell responses to the tumor antigen, mesothelin, correlates with survival.  For the purposes of this proposal, two of the most recent studies will be highlighted.  In an ongoing neoadjuvant study, the vaccine is given either alone or in combination with low dose cyclophosphamide (CY).  CY targets a population of regulatory T cells (Tregs) that inhibit tumor -specific T cell responses.  We have been able to demonstrate the 
influx of immune cells and formation of lymphoid aggregates within the tumor in a majority of patients.  We believe that for PDA, a vaccine is critically important to prime T cells  that can then 
migrate to the tumor.  Without the vaccine, pancreatic tumors lack significant inflammation and the T cells that exist are primarily Tregs.  In the neoadjuvant study, the vaccine is able to induce 
an influx of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes as early as 2 weeks after vaccine administration.

monocytes and PD -1 (right panel) staining on T cells within the same lymphoid aggregate.  
 Figure 1  is an example of a resected tumor with lymphoid aggregates consisting of a number of 
cell types including B and T cells (1A -C).   Upregulation of another important immune checkpoint 
pathway (PD -L1/PD -1) is also apparent (1D).  These lymphoid aggregates were seen in the 
majority of vaccinated patients but the number of aggregates range from 1- 35/HPF.  While the 
vaccine is able to generate tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, preclinical studies  suggest that 
combinatorial strategies will be necessary in difficult to treat tumors.  One strategy is to combine vaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti -CTLA -4, anti -PD-1, and anti -PD-L1.  In 
fact, the immune checkpoint inhibitors can release the brakes on vaccine -induced T cells. 
Concurrent administration of CTLA -4 antibody and GM -CSF-secreting tumor cells is synergistic 
in several mouse models (B16 melanoma, SM1 mammary carcinoma, and TRAMP prostate carcinoma)  (Van Elsa, et al , 1999; Hur witz, et al, 1998; Hurwitz, et al,  2000). 
 Studies combining IPI [INVESTIGATOR_204]  (van den Eertwegh, et al, 2012).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_205] -treated 
patients, both studies showed both CT scan regressions and tumor marker declines.  Twenty- five 
percent of men with prostate cancer had PSA responses and 2 men at the higher dose levels showed regressions on imaging.  The study in PDA is described below.

Phase 1b Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_206] P ancreatic Tumor Vaccine + Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_207].  Thirty patients with previously treated PDA were randomized 1:1 to IPI [INVESTIGATOR_136] 10mg/kg alone 
(arm 1) or in combination with vaccine (arm 2).  The higher dose of 10mg/kg of IPI [INVESTIGATOR_208] 3mg/kg in PDA had previously been reported and demonstrated a low but detectable response rate.  Studies in melanoma also suggested that the 10mg/kg dose was more efficacious.  Patients received 4 induction doses of IPI [INVESTIGATOR_209]/IPI [INVESTIGATOR_136] 3 -week intervals and then maintenance 
with the same treatment every 3 months.    
Baseline Characteristics and Safety.  Baseline characteristics  were similar among patients in each 
arm with the exception that arm 1 had fewer patients with > 2 prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (60 vs 100%, 
p=0.017).  The most common adverse event (AE) reported for IPI [INVESTIGATOR_210] -related 
adverse events (IRAE); the most commo n AEs reported for GM-CSF secreting  vaccines were 
localized vaccine reactions and self -limiting systemic rashes. The  rate of IRAEs (e.g. colitis, 
hypophysitis) attributable to IPI [INVESTIGATOR_211] 10 mg/kg dose.  Twenty percent of patients in both arms experienced Grade 3- [ADDRESS_144] response was stable disease (SD) in two patients in arm [ADDRESS_145] criteria (irRC), arm 2 had an 
additional patient with SD for 81 weeks.  Immune- related response criteria (irRC) account for the 
kinetics of both old and new lesions given the known for potential delayed responses with IPI.  The quality of the responses in the two arms was different. Patients with SD on arm 1 had continuous disease progression that did not reach the 20% growth cutoff for 7 and 22 weeks.  Arm 2 had three SD (1 regression starting at week 14 and maintained until week 31, one stabilization  
starting at week 22 and continued for 81 weeks, one SD continued for 71+ weeks). Figure 2A -C 
demonstrates CT findings of early tumor progression followed by [CONTACT_402] 14 and the corresponding CA19- 9 responses ( Figure 2D ).  This patient lived 12 months.  Figure 2E  
demonstrates interesting CA19- 9 kinetics in a patient who had stable local disease which continued 
for 71+ weeks.  The baseline elevated CA 19- 9 increased further du ring high dose steroid treatment 
of hypophysitis and then showed a gradual delayed normalization.  This patient lived 31 months.  Figure 2F shows the CA 19- 9 kinetics of a patient with early local progression and a new omental 
lesion at week 7 followed by [CONTACT_403] 22 and lasting until week 81. The CA19- 9 rise between the 12 week maintenance doses declined in response to treatments.  This 
patient is still alive and current survival is 30+ months.  CA19- 9 declines in association with 
Vaccine + IPI [INVESTIGATOR_212] 7/[ADDRESS_146], 0/15 patients receiving IPI [INVESTIGATOR_213]19- 9 declines. Median overall survival (OS) was 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.5 to 9.2) for arm 
1 and 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.3 to 14.7) for arm 2 (HR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.23 to 1.08, p=0.072).  The percent alive after one year also favored the combination arm (7% vs 27%) ( Figure 2G ).

repertoire size was similar following the initial treatment, but significantly larger following 
multiple treatments among patients with OS > 4.3 months (p=0.009).  Furthermore, expansion in the repertoire was observed in six of nine patients with OS > 4.3 months but not in any of the five patien ts with OS ≤ 4.3 months ( Figure 4B ) and was associated with longer OS (p=0.031).    
 
Figure 3. Longer survival is associated with an induction of CD8+mesothelin -specific T cell responses.  Mesothelin peptide -

frequencies measured at baseline, following the first treatment, and at the peak of induction in 19 HLA -A1+ and/or HLA -A2+

diversification of the mesothelin -specific T cell repertoire with additional treatments was seen in 
both arms. However, a greater number of patients in the combination arm exhibited these responses (4/7) compared to the IPI [INVESTIGATOR_215] (2/7) suggesting that the frequency of pre -existing mesothelin -
specific T cells are low and require a vaccine to induce larger pools of precursor T cells.  Consistent with a prior study, post -treatment expansion of the mesothelin -specific T cell repertoire was  
associated with longer OS. In this study, median survival for the six patients demonstrating an expansion in their mesothelin- specific T cell repertoires was 15.7 months compared to 4.1 months 
for the 8 patients whose repertoires were unchanged following treatment.

 Serum markers of response.  Unique to the vaccine arm was the induction of galectin -3 (gal -3) 
antibody responses.  Gal -3 was previously identified on a proteomics screen using immunized sera 
from patients vaccinated with the PDA vaccine.  Gal -3 is expressed by [CONTACT_405], regulatory 
T cells, and tumors and plays a role in T cell apoptosis and tolerance (Shimamura, et al, 2002; 
Peng, et al , 2008; Hsu, et al , 2009; Chen, et al , 2009).  Induction of gal-3 antibody responses was

therapy but may be administered during treatment when clinically indicated. Vaccination should be given when there is enough separation to distinguish any vaccine reactions from drug toxicity.  There is no experience using live attenuated vaccination during ipi[INVESTIGATOR_224], therefore  administration of  live vaccine is not allowed  for patients in Arm A  of 
this study during treatment.    Concomitant systemic or local anti-cancer medications or treatments are prohibited in this study while receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_225].  
 
Patients may not use any of the following therapi[INVESTIGATOR_226]:

 5.3 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
 
5.3.1 Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Immune- Related Adverse Events (IRAEs):  Definition, Monitoring, 
Treatment  
 Blocking CTLA -4 function may permit the emergence of auto- reactive T cells and 
resultant clinical autoimmunity. Rash/vitiligo, diarrhea/colitis, uveitis/epi[INVESTIGATOR_227], hepatitis and hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_228] -related, presumptive autoimmune events, 
now termed IRAEs , noted in previous ipi[INVESTIGATOR_229]. 
For the purposes of this study, an IRAE  is defined as an AE of unknown etiology, 
associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune phenomenon. Efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
41 
 causes prior to labeling an AE an IRAE. Sero logical, immunological, and histological 
(biopsy) data should be used to support the diagnosis of an immune -mediated 
toxicity. Suspected IRAEs must be documented on an AE or SAE CRF.  
Patients should be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of c linically 
significant systemic IRAE (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus -like diseases) or 
organ- specific IRAE (e.g., rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis or thyroid disease). If an 
IRAE is noted, appropriate work -up (including biopsy if possible) should be 
performed, and steroid therapy may be considered if clinically necessary (see 
Appendix C for suggested work-up and treatment of IRAEs).  
It is unknown if systemic corticosteroid therapy has an attenuating effect on 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_230]. However, clinical anti- tumor responses have been maintained in 
patients treated with corticosteroids and discontinued from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If utilized, corticosteroid therapy should be individualized for each patient. Prior experience 
suggests that colitis manifested as ≥ Grade 3 diarrhea requires corticosteroid 
treatment. See Appendix  C for additional details . 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Infusion Reactions Associated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_231], it is less likely that any allergic reaction will be seen in patients.  However, it is possible that infusion of 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_232] a cytokine release syndrome that could be evidenced by [CONTACT_411], chills, rigors, rash, pruritus, hypo- or hypertension, bronchospasm or other 
symptoms. No prophylactic pre-medication  will be giv en unless indicated by 
[CONTACT_412].  
Reactions should be treated based upon the following recommendations:  
For mild infusion- related symptoms (e.g., localized cutaneous reactions such as mild 
pruritus, flushing, rash) or CTC Grade 1 allergic reactions (transient flushing or rash, 
drug fever< 38°C):  
• Decrease the rate of infusion until recovery from symptoms, remain at bedside 
and monitor patient; 
• Complete the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_233] ;  
• Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician and patients may receive additional doses with close monitoring; 
• Premedication with diphenhydramine may be given at the discretion of the Investigator. 
 
For moderate infusion- related symptoms (any symptom not listed above [mild 
symptoms] or below [severe symptoms] such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, 
dyspnea, hypotension with systolic BP > 80 mmHg) or CTC Grade 2 allergic 
reactions (generalized rash, flushing, urticaria, dyspnea, drug fever ≥ 38°C):  
• Interrupt ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]; 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
42 
 • Administer diphenhydramine 50 mg IV;  
• Monitor patient closely until resolution of symptoms; 
• Corticosteroids may abrogate any beneficial immunologic effect, but may be administered at the discret ion of the treating physician; 
• Resume ipi[INVESTIGATOR_234]; 
• At the discretion of the treating physician, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_235], then increased incrementally to the initial infusion rate.  
• If symptoms develop after resumption of the infusion, the infusion should be discontinued and no additional ipi[INVESTIGATOR_236]; 
• The next dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_237] -medication (diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) and 
careful monitoring, following the same treatment guidelines outlined above;  
• At the discretion of the treating physician additional oral or IV antihistamine may be administered prior to dosing with i pi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
For severe infusion- related symptoms (e.g., any reaction such as bronchospasm, 
systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg, or angioedema) or CTC Grade 3 or 4 allergic 
reactions (symptomatic bronchospasm, angioedema, hypotension):  
• Immediately discontinue infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and disconnect infusion 
tubing from the subject; 
• Consider bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 0.3 - 0.5 mg IM (0.3 ml -0.5 ml of 1:1000 
solution), and/or diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, with solumedrol 100 mg IV, as needed . 
• Patients should be monitored until the Investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur; 
• No further ipi[INVESTIGATOR_239]; 
 
In case of late- occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance within one 
week after treatment of a localized or generalized pruritus), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  [IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_240], the Investigator must use clinical judgment to

If a patient experiences isolated drug fever, for the next dose, pre -treatment with 
acetaminophen should be instituted and a repeated antipyretic dose at [ADDRESS_172] dosing with an appropriate antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dosing

 should be decreased to 50% of the previous rate. If fever recurs following infusion rate change, the Investigator should assess the patient’s level of discomfort with the event and use clinical judgment to determine if the patie nt should receive further 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
5.3.2 Allogeneic GM -CSF Transfected Pancreatic Tumor Vaccine  
 
Local vaccine site reaction may be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_242] E gel or lotion. Significant local inflammation that is causing the research 
participant severe pain or is interfering with the activities of daily living may be treated with cold packs and oral analgesics. Local toxicities of pruritus at the vaccine sites and systemic pruritus may be treated with topi[INVESTIGATOR_243] (Benadryl) or topi[INVESTIGATOR_244]. If oral diphenhydramine hydrochloride is used the recommended dose shall be 25- 50 mg every four to six hours as needed 
for pruritus, not to exceed 300 mg/day. Cases of local ulceration should be manageable with local wound care, with or without antibiotics. Severe local inflammation or significant clinical autoimmunity will be managed on a case by [CONTACT_413].  
 
5.3.3 FOLFIRINOX  
 
General concomitant medication and supportive care guidelines for FOLFIRINOX are recommendations and at the discretion of the treating physician. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti-emetics  
 Patients should be pre -medicated prior to the FOLFIRINOX treatment with anti-
emetics per institutional guidelines. Agents  that may be considered include, but are 
not limited to: promethazine,  prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, haloperidol, 
droperidol, lorazepam and serotonin- antagonists (e.g. ondansetron, granisetron, 
dolasetron).  
 
Delayed emesis, should it occur, will be treated for future FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy doses with a delayed emesis regimen.

treating physician.  However, these agents are not recommended. 
 
5.4 Duration of Therapy 
 
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event (s), treatment may continue 
indefinitely or until one of the following criteria applies:  
• Clinically significant disease progression  (Section 5.6). 
 
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment,  
 
• Pregnancy  
 
• Unacceptable adverse event(s) requiring temporary or permanent stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_250] (see also Section 6 ).  
 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or 
 
• General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
• Termination of the study by [CONTACT_414]-Myers Squibb (BMS) , CTEP, or the sponsor. 
   
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_174] will occur approximately every 12 
weeks (or until study termination) to evaluate OS, PD, subsequent cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and 
AEs.  Adverse events [ADDRESS_175] dose of investigational agent (Arm A ) will only 
be recorded if deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational agent. 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event (s) will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.  Any patients that have received the 
pancreatic tumor vaccine (Arm A) will also have annual evaluations (+/ - 2 months) either 
at Hopkins or locally until study termination.  If consent is granted, patients who received 
vaccine will continue to be followed annually after study termination  via a separate 
protocol entitled “Long -term follow -up of patients who receive lethally irradiated 
allogeneic pancreatic tumor cells transfected with the GM -CSF gene.”  Consent for this 
long-term follow up may be obtained at any point in the protocol.

increase of tumor lesions or other disease parameters (based on study indication, i.e., hematologic malignancies) within (specific 12 -24) weeks following the start of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251].  Such patients may not have had sufficient time to develop the required immune activation or, in some patients, tumor volume or other disease parameter increases may represent infiltration of lymphocytes into the original tumor or blood.  In conve ntional 
studies, such tumor volume or relevant laboratory parameter increases during the first [ADDRESS_177] developed > [ADDRESS_178] or immune -related response criteria (irRC). In the 
case that the RECIST or irRC report is not complete by [CONTACT_415], t he

 The following criteria will be  used to determine dose holding, restarting doses, or discontinuing 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
It is necessary to avoid study drug dosing and initiate appropriate evaluation and/or 
treatment for the following adverse events:  
• Any ≥ grade 3 skin related adverse event regardless of causality.  
• Any ≥ grade 2 non- skin related adverse event (including immune -mediated adverse 
reactions), except for easily correctly laboratory abnormalities that do not reflect underlying organ pathology. 
• Any ≥ grade 3 laboratory abnormality. 
• Any ≤ grade 2 cardiac toxicity.  If both troponin and symptoms return to baseline and 
myocarditis is ruled out, treatment may be resumed. 
• Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued dosing. 
• It may be necessary to hold study drug to evaluate Grade [ADDRESS_185] ongoing or incipi[INVESTIGATOR_257], diarrhea, pancreatitis, hepatitis, pi[INVESTIGATOR_258], early evidence of neurologic events, skin toxicity until diagnosis 
and progression are determined.

• If the adverse event has resolved to ≤ grade 1 , ipi[INVESTIGATOR_261].  Please 
follow guidelines for specific events. Please n ote that re -initiating treatment may be 
associated with recurrence or exacerbation of autoimmune or inflammatory events.  In some instances clinical resolution of events such as colitis may be associated with residual pathologic changes and should require evaluation of complete resolution prior to restarting therapy.  
• Events which require intervention with immunosuppressant therapy, steroids, surgery, or hormone replacement generally require permanently stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_262].  Consult guidelines for exceptions and specific events.   
• Autoimmune/inflammatory events are presumably related to the mechanisms of action of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_263] a therapeutic effect.  The incidence and severity of these events may be dose related, but once initiated, ther e is no evidence that lowered doses can 
be administered without continued autoimmune activity and there has so far been no demonstrable benefit to continuing ipi[INVESTIGATOR_264] #: 9478

o Endocrinopathies where clinical symptoms are controlled with appropriate 
hormone replacement therapy. Note:  Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_276].  
o Asymptomatic lipase elevations of any grade may be retreated once resolved to patient’s baseline grade.   
 
6.4.3 Immune- Related Adverse Events (irAEs) Reactions and Immune -mediated Adverse 
Reactions: Definition, Monitoring, and Treatment 
 
For the purposes of this study, an immune -related adverse reaction is defined as an adverse 
reaction of unknown etiology associated with drug exposure and consistent with an immune phenomenon. Efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an event an irAEs.  Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data should be used to support the diagnosis of an immune- related 
toxicity. Suspected immune -related adverse reactions must be documented on an AE or 
SAE form. Another term for an irAE is an immune -mediate adverse reaction, as it is termed 
in the Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_277] . Both terms may be used in this protocol 
document.   Patients should be informed of and carefully monitored for evidence of clinically significant systemic immune -mediated adverse reactions (e.g., systemic lupus 
erythematosus- like diseases) or organ- speci fic immune -mediated adverse reaction(e.g., 
rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis or thyroid disease). If an immune- mediated adverse reaction 
is noted, appropriate work- up (including biopsy if possible) should be performed, and 
steroid therapy may be considered if clinically necessary.   
 It is unknown if systemic corticosteroid therapy has an attenuating effect on ipi[INVESTIGATOR_230]. However, clinical anti- tumor responses have been maintained in patients treated 
with corticosteroids and discontinued from ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. If utilized, corticosteroid therapy 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017

 should be individualized for each patient. Prior experience suggests that colitis manifested as ≥ grade [ADDRESS_186] the PI [INVESTIGATOR_278].  
 
 
6.4.4 Other Guidance  
 The following guidance is provided for the management of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_279].  These recommendations, treatment algorithms in Appendix C , and further 
information in the IB, should be considered in the context of appropriate medical treatment for each pat ient.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Infusion Reactions Associated with Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_231], it is less likely that any allergic reaction will be seen in patients.  However, it is possible that infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_232] a cytokine release syndrome that could be evidenced by [CONTACT_411], chills, rigors, rash, pruritus, hypotension, hypertension, bronchospasm, or other symptoms.  No prophylactic pre -medication should be given unless indicated by 
[CONTACT_412]. Reactions should be treated based upon the following recommendations.  
 
• For mild symptoms ( e.g., localized cutaneous reactions such as mild pruritus, 
flushing, rash): 
o Decrease the rate of infusion until recovery from symptoms, remain at bedside 
and monitor patient. 
o Complete the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_233].  
o Diphenhydramine 50 mg IV may be administered at the discretion of the treating physician and patients may receive additional doses with close monitoring. 
o Premedication with diphenhydramine may be given at the discretion of the investigator for subsequent doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
• For moderate symptoms (any symptom not listed above [mild symptoms] or below [severe symptoms] such as generalized pruritus, flushing, rash, dyspnea, hypotension with systolic BP >80 mmHg):  
o Interrupt ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
o Administer diphenhydramine [ADDRESS_187], but may be  
administered at the discretion of the treating physician. 
o Resume ipi[INVESTIGATOR_234]. 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
51 
 o At the discretion of the treating physician, ipi[INVESTIGATOR_235], then increased increment ally to the initial 
infusion rate.  
o If symptoms develop after resumption of the infusion, the infusion should be discontinued and no additional ipi[INVESTIGATOR_236]. 
o The next dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_280] d time and 
may be given with pre -medication (diphenhydramine and acetaminophen) and 
careful monitoring, following the same treatment guidelines outlined above. 
o At the discretion of the treating physician additional oral or IV antihistamine may be administe red prior to dosing with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
• For severe symptoms (e.g., any reaction such as bronchospasm, generalized 
urticaria, systolic blood pressure < 80 mm Hg, or angioedema): 
o Immediately discontinue infusion of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], and disconnect infusion 
tubing from the subject.  
o Consider bronchodilators, epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1 mg IV or subcutaneously, and/or 
diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, with solumedrol 100 mg IV, as needed.  
o Patients should be monitored until the investigator is comfortable that the symptoms will not recur.  
o No fu rther ipi[INVESTIGATOR_239].  
• In case of late -occurring hypersensitivity symptoms (e.g., appearance within one 
week after treatment of a localized or generalized pruritus), symptomatic treatment may be given (e.g., oral antihistamine, or corticosteroids).  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Treatment of Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -Related Isolated Drug Fever  
 
In the event of isolated drug fever, the investigator must use clinical judgment to determine if the fever is related to the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_241].  If a 
patient experiences isolated drug fever, for the next dose, pre -treatment with 
acetaminophen or non- steroidal anti- inflammatory agent (investigator discretion) 
should be instituted and a repeated antipyretic dose at [ADDRESS_188] dosing with an appropriate antipyretic, the infusion rate for subsequent dos ing 
should be decreased to 50% of the previous rate.  If fever recurs following infusion rate change, the investigator should assess the patient’s level of discomfort with the event and use clinical judgment to determine if the patient should receive further ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Monitoring and Management of Immune- mediated Adverse Reactions  
 
Immune- mediated Enterocolitis  
The clinical presentation of GI immune -related AEs included diarrhea, increase in the 
frequency of bowel movements, abdominal pain, or hematochezia, with or without fever. However inflammation may occur in any part of the GI tract including esophagitis and gastritis.  Fatalities due to GI perforation have been reported in clinical 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
52 
 trials of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. Patients should be carefully monitored for GI s ymptoms that may 
be indicative of immune -related colitis, diarrhea, or GI perforation.  Diarrhea or colitis 
occurring after initiation of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_281]. In clinical trials, immune -related colitis was 
associated with evidence of mucosal inflammation, with or without ulcerations, and lymphocytic infiltration.  
 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus or blood in stool, with or without fever) and bowel perforation (such as peritoneal signs and ileus).  In symptomatic patients, rule out infectious etiologies and consider endoscopic evaluation to establish etiology and for persistent or severe symptoms.  C. difficile  toxin has been detected in several patients with colitis and may 
be an independent entity or may co- exist with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_282].   
 Withhold ipi[INVESTIGATOR_283]; 
administer anti-diarrheal treatment and, if persistent evaluate with colonoscopy and initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent.  Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_284] a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent. Upon improvement to grade [ADDRESS_189] be evaluated before each dose of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_285] -related hepatitis/ pancreatitis and 
elevations in liver function tests (LFTs) may develop in the absence of clinical symptoms.  Increase in LFT or total bilirubin should be evaluated to exclude other 
causes of hepatic injury, including infections, disease progression, or other medications, and monitored until resolution.  Liver biopsies from patients who had immune -related hepatotoxicity showed evidence of acute inflammation (neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, and macrophages).  
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
53 
 Monitor liver function tests (hepatic transaminase and bilirubin levels, lipase) and assess patients for signs a nd symptoms of hepatotoxicity/ pancreatitis before each dose 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125].  In patients with hepatotoxicity, rule out infectious or malignant causes and increase frequency of liver function test monitoring until resolution.  Withhold ipi[INVESTIGATOR_286] 2 hepatotoxicity.   Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_286] 3 –5 
hepatotoxicity/pancreatitis and administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  When liver function tests show sustained improvement or return to baseline, initiate corticosteroid tapering and continue to taper over [ADDRESS_190] persistent severe hepatitis despi[INVESTIGATOR_287] -dose corticosteroids.  
 
Immune- mediated Dermatitis  
Skin immune -related AEs presented mostly frequently as a rash and/or pruritus.  Some 
subjects reported vitiligo associated with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288].  Fatal toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_289].  
 Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of dermatitis such as rash and pruritus.  Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptoms of dermatitis should be considered immune- mediat ed.   
 Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_290] -Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], or rash complicated by [CONTACT_417], or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations.  Administer systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  When dermatitis is controlled, corticosteroid tapering should occur over a period of at least 1 month.  Withhold ipi[INVESTIGATOR_291].   For mild to moderate dermatitis, such as grade 2 localized rash and pruritus, treat 
symptomatically. For persistent grade 2, grade 3, or greater, topi[INVESTIGATOR_292].  Administer topi[INVESTIGATOR_293] 1 week.  
Immune- related Neurological Events  
Fatal Guillain -Barré syndrome has been reported in clinical trials of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
Patients may present with muscle weakness and myasthenia gravis, cranial nerve palsy (n VII Bell ’s palsy), and aseptic meninigits, encephalopathy.  Unexplained motor 
neuropathy, muscle weakness, or sensory neuropathy lasting more than 4 days should be evaluated and non -inflammatory causes such as disease progression, infections, 
metabolic syndromes, nerve entrapment, and medications  should be excluded as 
causes.  
 Withhold ipi[INVESTIGATOR_294].   
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
54 
  Monitor for symptoms of motor or sensory neuropathy such as unilateral or bilateral weakness, sens ory alterations, or paresthesia. Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_295] (interfering with daily activities) such as Guillain -
Barré -like syndromes.  Institute medical intervention as appropriate for management 
of neuropathy and other neurologic events.  Consider initiation of systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe neuropathies.   
Immune-mediated Endocrinopathies 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_296] t hyroid 
(Hashimoto’s thryroiditis with positive antibodies) and adrenal glands, hypophysitis, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], and resulting thyroid and adrenal insufficiency, low ADH, prolactin, FSH, LH. Hyperthyroid with Graves’ disease and positive antibody has been reported. Patients may present with subtle and nonspecific symptoms.  The most common clinical presentation includes headache and fatigue.  Symptoms may also include visual field defects, behavioral changes, and electrolyte disturbances including hyponatremia  
and hypotension.  Adrenal crisis as a cause of the patient’s symptoms should be excluded.  Based on the available data with known outcome, most of the subjects symptomatically improved with hormone replacement therapy.  Long- term hormone 
replacement therapy with HC and synthroid will typi[INVESTIGATOR_298]/hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_299].  Some patients have regained partial function following steroid treatment.   Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency (including adrenal crisis), and hyper - or hypothyroidism.  Headache is often the first 
symptoms of hypophysitis.  Patients may present with fatigue, headache, mental st atus 
changes, loss of libido, abdominal pain, unusual bowel habits, and hypotension, or nonspecific symptoms which may resemble other causes such as brain metastasis or underlying disease.  Unless an alternate etiology has been identified, signs or symptom s 
of endocrinopathies should be considered immune -mediated and drug withheld 
pending evaluation.  Patients may demonstrate both central (hypophysitis) and peripheral adrenal and thyroid insufficiency.  Evaluation of hypophysitis should include pi[INVESTIGATOR_300] I.  
 Endocrine evaluation, including TSH, should be performed at baseline prior to initial treatment.  Monitor thyroid function tests and clinical chemistries at the start of 
treatment and hold blood for possible evaluation should clinical events require determining baseline function and anti -thyroid antibodies.  A plan for evaluating 
endocrine function at each visit either by [CONTACT_418]. Endocrine evaluation, 
including TSH, should be performed at baseline prior to treatment, and the protocol

 Clinical monitoring is required for all protocols as above, and should include any requirements per protocol for laboratory evaluation, both periodically or as clinically indicated, consistent with good medical practice.  In a limited number of patients, hypophysitis was diagnosed by [CONTACT_419][INVESTIGATOR_304].    Withhold ipi[INVESTIGATOR_305] . Initiate 
systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent, and initiate appropriate hormone replacement therapy.   
Immune- mediated Cardiotoxici ty 
Evaluation of cardiac function, including EKG and echo cardiogram (ECHO), will be 
done for any patients with a history of CHF or at risk because of underlying cardiovascular disease or exposure to cardiotoxic drugs as clinically indicated. F or 
patients who develop evidence of CHF, MI, cardiomyopathy, or myositis while on 
study, cardiac evaluation including lab tests and cardiology consultations will be done as clinically indicated including EKG, CPK, troponin, and ECHO. Treatment with 
steroids should be started as clinically indicated.  Drug will be p ermanently 
discontinued for grade 3 or 4 cardiac dysfunction and grade 2 events that do not recover to baseline or that reoccur . See table below for additional guidelines for 
management of cardiac toxicities.

 Note: The optimal treatment regimen for immune mediated myocarditis has not been 
established.  Since this toxicity has caused patient deaths, an aggressive approach is 
recommended.   
  
Other Immune -mediated Adverse Reactions, Including Ocular Manifestations  
Ocular inflammation, manifested as grade 2 or grade 3 epi[INVESTIGATOR_308], was associated with concomitant diarrhea in a few subjects (<1%) and occas ionally 
occurred in the absence of clinically apparent GI symptoms.  Other presumed immune -
related AEs reported include, but were not limited to, arthritis/arthralgias, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, autoimmune (aseptic) meningitis, autoimmune nephritis, pure red cell 
aplasia, noninfective myocarditis, polymyositis, and myasthenia gravis, of which were individually reported for <1% of subjects.   The following clinically significant immune -mediated adverse reactions were seen in 
less than 1% of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -treated patients in Study 1: nephritis, pneumonitis, 
pulmonary granuloma resembling sarcoidosis, meningitis, pericarditis, uveitis, iritis, ITP, neutropenia and hemolytic anemia.  Across the clinical development program for ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], the following likely immu ne-
mediated adverse reactions were also reported with less than 1% incidence: myocarditis, angiopathy, temporal arteritis, vasculitis, polymyalgia rheumatica, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_227], scleritis, leukocytoclasticvasculitis, erythema multif orme, psoriasis, pancreatitis, arthritis, and autoimmune thyroiditis.   
 Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_309] -
mediated adverse reactions.  Initiate systemic corticosteroids at a dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent for severe immune- mediated adverse reactions.  
 Administer corticosteroid eye drops to patients who develop uveitis, iritis, or epi[INVESTIGATOR_227].  Permanently discontinue ipi[INVESTIGATOR_310] -mediated ocular disease 
that is unresponsive to local immunosuppressive therapy. 
 Overall, immune -related AEs commonly started within [ADDRESS_191] instances by [CONTACT_420], discontinuing dosing, and/or through administering symptomatic or immunosuppressive therapy, including corticosteroids, as mentioned above.  Immune -related AEs generally resolved within 
days to weeks in the majorit
y of subjects.  
 
6.4.5 Precautions  
 Combination therapy may result in unexpected toxicity especially in novel combinations with other immune modifying agents.  A striking example involving fatal pancreatitis in 
macaques is presented in Vaccari , et al. 2012.

previously been administered ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], particularly in patients who experienced ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] -related diarrhea/colitis.  Colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy with biopsy may be 
advisable prior to IL -2 administration once the patient is no longer receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] .  
The management guidelines for general inflammatory AEs and ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]- related GI 
toxicities, hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy, and neuropathy (Investigator Brochure, 2011) are provided in Appendix C . 
 Patients who have received ipi[INVESTIGATOR_311], hypophysitis or adrenal insufficiency. 
 
 
6.4.6 Study Procedures by [CONTACT_421] (that is, all chemistry and all hematology results) must be obtained and reviewed before ipi[INVESTIGATOR_288], as applicable. All laboratory results must be within the established range before ipi[INVESTIGATOR_162] b is 
administered. All induction period laboratory samples must be collected within a window of up to [ADDRESS_193] be performed and the result examined by [CONTACT_422][INVESTIGATOR_125].  
 7. ADVERSE EVENTS:  REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
This study will use the descriptions and grading scales found in the revised National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 for adverse event reporting that can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.   
 Information about all adverse events, whether volunteered by [CONTACT_423], discovered by [CONTACT_424], or detected through physical examination, laboratory test or ot her 
means, will be collected, recorded, and followed as appropriate.   All adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_425] A will be collected and reported from the 
first dose of the investigational agent, throughout the study, and will only be followed for [ADDRESS_194] an ongoing adverse event related to the study procedures and/or medication(s) may continue to be periodically contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the study staff until the event is resolved or determined to be irreversible by [CONTACT_093].  
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
58 
 Laboratory abnormalities:  Laboratory abnormalities present at the screening visit will be 
recorded as  pre-treatment signs and symptoms. After study treatment administration, all grade 
3 and 4 clinical laboratory results that represent an increase in severity from baseline will be reported as adverse events. A grade 1 or 2 clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported as an adverse event only if it is considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_093].  
7.1 Definitions  
 
7.1.1 Adverse Event (AE)  
 
Adverse event is defined as any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug (or therapy) even if the event is not 
considered to be related to the study. An undesirable medical condition can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the study treatment are only considered adverse events if they worsen after starting the study treatment (any procedures specified in the protocol). Adverse events occurring before starting the study treatment but after signing the informed consent form will be not recorded. 
Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms or require therapy. 
 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
 
A serious adverse event is an undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition which:  • Results in death  • Is life threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see note below for exceptions) for ≥ 24 hours 
• Results in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (note: reports of congenital anomalies/birth defects must also be reported on the Pregnancy Supplemental Form)  • Is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not  be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention [eg, medical, surgical] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definition above.). Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].)   Events not considered to be serious adverse events are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_314]:  
• Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
59 
 • Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, routine colonoscopy)  • Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state and 
was planned prior to entry into the study. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases  
• Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic inadequacy, care- giver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).  
 
7.2 Relationship  
 
Definite  – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment.  
Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
Unlikely  – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
Unrelated  – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study treatment.  
 7.3 Expectedness  
 
Unexpected adverse event:  An adverse event, which varies in nature, intensity or frequency 
from information on the investigational drug/agent provided in the Investigator’s Brochure, package insert or safety reports. Any adverse event that is  not included in the informed 
consent is considered “unexpected”.  
 
Expected (known) adverse event:  An adverse event, which has been reported in the 
Investigator’s Brochure. An adverse event is considered “expected”, only if it is included in the informed consent document as a risk. 
 7.4 Handling of Expedited Safety Reports  
 
In accordance with local regulat ions, CTEP (or Sponsor) will notify investigators of all 
SAEs that are unexpected (ie, not previously described in the Investigator Brochure), and definitely, probably, or possibly related to Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (or the Pancreatic Tumor Vaccine) . 
This notification will be in the form of an expedited safety report (ESR) that is to be faxed 
to [CONTACT_497] and the study coordinator within [ADDRESS_195] review and retain the notice with the Investigator’s Brochure and where required by [CONTACT_427] , the investigator  will 
submit th e ESR to the appropriate IRB/IBC. The investigator and IRB/IB C will determine 
if the informed consent requires revision. The investigator should also comply with the IRB/IB C procedures for re porting any other safety information. Where required, 
submission of ESRs by [CONTACT_428]. [CONTACT_497]  will also be responsible for notifying all other 
investigators participating in  the study of these adverse events.

Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_206] (s) will be reported to RAC in the Annual Report. Upon receipt of the report of the adverse event by [CONTACT_436], follow-up information will be provided to RAC within 15 days. 
 7.6 Secondary Malignancy 
 
A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous malignancy ( e.g., 
treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary 
malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm.  CTEP requires all 
secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP -AERS .  Three options are available to describe the event.  
 
• Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy ( e.g., a cute myelocyticl eukemia 
[AML])  
• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)  
• Treatment -related secondary malignancy  
 Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol.  
 
7.7 Second Malignancy  
 
A second malignancy is one unrelated to the treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine 
reporting via CDUS unless otherwise specified .

 8.4 Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 
 
Mode of Action: Cyclophosphamide is a synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related 
to the nitrogen mustards. Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxidase system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapi[INVESTIGATOR_321]. The mechanism of action is thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA.  
 
Product description:  CYTOXAN® (cyclophosphamide for injection, USP) is a sterile 
white powder containing cyclophosphamide monohydrate and is supplied in vials for single-dose use.  
 Storage and Dispensing: Cyclophosphamide  (prepared for either direct injection or 
infusion) is chemically and physically stable for 24 hours at room temperature or for six  
days in the refrigerator; it does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and thus care must be taken to assure the sterility of prepared solutions.  
 Preparation: Parenteral  drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter 
and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Add the diluent to the vial and shake it vigorously to dissolve. If the powder fails to dissolve immediately and  completely, it is advisable to allow the vial to stand for a few minutes. 
Use the quantity of diluent shown below to constitute the product:

 1. CYTOXAN constituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride may be infused without further dilution. 2. CYTOXAN constituted with 0.9% sterile sodium chloride may be infused following further dilution in the following: 
Dextrose Injection, USP (5% dextrose) Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (5% dextrose and 0.9% sterile sodium chloride) 5% Dextrose and Ringer’s Injection Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (0.45% sterile sodium chloride) Sodium Lactate Injection, USP (1/6 molar sodium lactate)  
 Route of administration: Cyclophosphamide is administered  by [CONTACT_441] 30 minutes.  Patient Care Implications:  
During treatment, the patient’s hematologic profile (particularly neutrophils and platelets) should be monitored regularly to determine the degree of hematopoietic suppression. 
 The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide reportedly are increased by [CONTACT_442]. The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving cyclophosphamide even though cyclophosphamide has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other cytotoxic drugs. Cyclophosphamide treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity, potentiates the effect of succinylcholine chloride.  If a patient has been treated with 
cyclophosphamide within [ADDRESS_212] should be alerted.  
 Cyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing.  Availability : Cyclophosphamide is commercially available.

9.1 Biomarker Studies  
 N/A 
 
9.[ADDRESS_213]- vaccination induction of mesothelin- specific T cell 
responses will be measured and correlated with OS.  PBL will be collected  at baseline and with 
each treatment in the vaccine arm.  In the chemotherapy arm, PBL will be collected at baseline and at 6 weeks.  PBL are isolated and stored frozen until use in assays as previously described  
(Thomas, et al , 2004) .  CD8
+ T cells will be enriched by [CONTACT_443] #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_214] reported on to assay mesothelin -specific T cell 
responses in patients with HLA -A1, A2, A3, and A24 alleles.  We also previously reported our 
prediction and validation methods for new peptides  (Laheru, et al, 2008).  Quantification of 
mesothelin -specific T cell responses and changes in T cell repertoire  will be performed using IFN γ 
ELISPOT assays.  CD8+ T cells specific to each MHC class I restricted mesothelin peptide will be 
individually quantified in each PBL sample.  T2 cells will be used to present epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. We have genetically modified T2 cells to express A1, A3, and A24.  The cells naturally express HLA -A2.  
The CEF (CMV, EBV, influenza) pool will be used as positive control peptides and HIV, renal cell, or melanoma epi[INVESTIGATOR_323].  Similar to our other reported studies, a > 2-fold induction of mesothelin-specific T cell responses will be considered positive.  The size 
of the mesothelin- specific T cell repertoire is the total number or percentage of epi[INVESTIGATOR_324].  Evaluation of avidity changes in the mesothelin- specific T cell 
repertoire will be performed using dilutional tetramer staining.  Tetramers are manufactured by 
[CONTACT_444] 6 HLA -A0201- binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_325] 7 HLA -A0101 epi[INVESTIGATOR_322].  Based on our published studies, tetramer dilutions 
ranging from 1:10 to 1:[ADDRESS_215] method currently in clinical use.   The 
method relies on a combined flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization which used diagnostically in genetic syndromes associated with telomere dysfunction (Armanios, et al , 2007; 
Alder, et al, 2008; Armanios, et al, 2012) .  The CLIA -approved assay will be performed by [CONTACT_445]. 
 Galectin -[ADDRESS_216] vaccine induced galectin -3 antibody responses.  EIA/RIA plates (Corning) are coated with 
purified recombinant proteins at 5 μg/ml at 4°C overnight. The prote in-coated plates are incubated 
with ELISA Blocker Blocking Buffer (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_326]) for 1 h at room temperature, and then with 30 μl/well of serial dilutions (1:100, 1:200, 1:400, and 1:800) of sera (duplicates for each dilution) for 2 h at room temperature  and with 30 μl/well of 1:200,000 dilution of goat antihuman IgG (γ-
chain specific) peroxidase conjugate (Sigma, A8419) for 1 h at room temperature.  The wells are washed with TBS -T between incubations. The plates are color developed with 3,3’5,5’ -
tetramet hylbenzidine liquid substrate (Sigma, T0440) and incubated in the dark for 20 min at room 
temperature. The color development is stopped with 1 N sulfuric acid. Absorbance at 450 nm (with a reference wavelength of 570 nm) is measured on a PowerWave 340 micr oplate reader (BioTek). 
A galectin -3 antibody control curve is performed in advance with a positive serum sample (based 
on Western blot analysis) to have an OD450 of about 1.000 at serum dilution of 1:100.

annexin A2 are therapeutic in a mouse model (Zheng, et al , 2011).  We are now using an updated 
proteomics approach to improve on our selection of purified proteins isolated from our vaccine cell lines, with a goal of isolating the less abundant sero- reactive surface proteins and proteins in 
native conformation that are more likely to represent important functional PDA -associated proteins 
for therapeutics development. Our approach involves a strategy that couples the use of immuno-precipi[INVESTIGATOR_327]  (Gronborg, et al, 2006). SILAC is a quantitative proteomics method 
incorporating in vivo labeling of the proteins in the cell lysate followed by [CONTACT_446]. We adapted SILAC for our studies because it “subtracts” out the proteins recognized by 
[CONTACT_094]-vaccination sera from those recognized by [CONTACT_447] -vaccination sera, thereby [CONTACT_448]. A vaccine cell population is cu ltured  to incorporate 
nonradioactive “heavy” isotopes of lysine and arginine into its proteome instead of the usual “light” versions present in conventional growth medium. In parallel, another aliquot of cells are 
grown in “light” medium containing normal amino acids. After passaging , cultures are processed 
into “heavy” and “ light”  lysates , respectively. The pre -vaccine sera are  used to immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_328] -vaccination sera from each patient are used to 
immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_329]. Both precipi[INVESTIGATOR_330] (1:1 ratio mixture) and by [CONTACT_449]. Protein identified in bands that are higher in the post -vaccine sera immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_331].  Figure 8A shows an example of the global changes in recognition of the pre - versus

increase in post -vaccine sera.  Galecti n-[ADDRESS_218] -

 Whole- exome sequencin g to identify immune responsive genotypes.  We are collaborating with 
the Ludwig Center for Cancer Genetics (PIs: Vogelstein and Diaz) to perform whole -exome 
sequencing using next -generation sequencing on DNA from the primary tumors and matched 
normal tiss ue from a subset of patients on the phase 1 study to compare long- term survivors versus 
non-responders in our cohort using methods previously described  (Jones, et al, 2008) .  The data is 
not yet available but sample collection and similar analyses are plan ned for the proposed phase [ADDRESS_221] a subset of patients will respond to immunotherapy 
and there may be genetic determinants that define this response.  These studies will define the 
genetic landscape of these tumo rs and may determine an ‘immune responsive’ phenotype.  
Furthermore, since each mutation is a potential neo -antigen that may drive an immune response, 
we will evaluate each mutation for antigenic potential in our model (Segal, et al, 2008).   
 
Immunohistochemistry to characterize tumors and immune infiltrates. Tumors will also be 
tested for PD -L1 expression at baseline.  We will collaborate with pathologists, Robert Anders and 
Janice Taube, to perform PD -L1 IHC.  They have been instrumental in the development of this 
assay in completed and ongoing anti -PD-1 studies.  Their work suggests that PD -L1 expression 
predicts response to anti -PD-1 (Brahmer, et al, 2010; Topalian, et al, 2012).  However, PD -L1 is 
also upregulated in response to IFN -γ released by [CONTACT_454] T cells and could potentially be a 
predictor of response to any active immunotherapy.  Pre and post -treatment tumor biopsies will 
also be analyzed for PD -1 and PD -L1 expression as well as infiltration of immune cells (effector 
T cells, Tregs, B cells, dendritic cells, etc).  Emerging data suggest that CTLA -[ADDRESS_222] effects on Tregs.  Characterization of immune checkpoint expression as well as immune 
infiltrates may be predictive of response to therapy and may also give insight into next generation 
combinatorial approaches.  Preliminary data from the neoadjuvant study suggests that induction 
of a T h1and T h17 phenotype at the tumor itself predicts response.  Furthermore, upregulation of 
other inhibitory molecules such as PD-1, PD -L1, IL -10, and TGF- β may identify other targets for 
combinatorial strategies.

[Appendix A] .  Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor 
lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.   
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_237] their response classified accor ding to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Patients who exhibit 
objective disease progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)  
 
Evaluable Non- Target Disease Response.  Patients who have lesions present at baseline 
that are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable for non- target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, 
absence, or unequivocal progression of the lesions.  
 
11.1.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
 All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_238] slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  MRI is also acceptable in certain situations ( e.g. for body scans).   
 Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_239], the modality used at follow -up should 
be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scann ers, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the 
same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans  should be performed with breath-hold 
scanning techniques, if possible.  
PET- CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET -
CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET -CT is of  identical 
diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with 
conventional CT in accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_240] one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >[ADDRESS_241] 
x-ray or as >[ADDRESS_242] be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
 
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be >[ADDRESS_243] scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only 
the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non- measurable.  
 
Target lesions.   All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 
lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesio ns with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but 
in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproduci ble 
measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions,

 short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable d imension of the disease.

[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph 
nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
 
Partial Response (PR) :  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative incre ase of 20%, the sum must 
also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions). 
 
Stable Disease (SD) :  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions 
 
Complete Response (CR) :  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization 
of tumor marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm 
short axis). 
 Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s)  and/or maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) :  Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not 
normally trump target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status

 change, not a single lesion increase.      Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_343], and the progression status should be confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response 
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

11.1.5 Duration of Response  
 
Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date 
that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
 The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met 
for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
 
Duration of stable disease :  Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until 
the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started, including the baseline measurements.  
 
11.1.6 Progression-Free Survival (PFS)  
 PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or 
death, whichever occurs first.  
12. DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS  
 Adverse event guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7.0 (Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).  12.1 Data Management 
 
All information will be collected on study- specific case report forms (CRFs) by [CONTACT_464]. 
These data will be reviewed for completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_079] . 
The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Research Office will mo nitor 
JHU study patients, while UCSF will use its internal CRO to monitor its study patients. Eligibility for both sites will be monitored by [CONTACT_465].  
 External sites  are responsible for submitting CDUS data and/or data forms to the 
Coordinating Center quarterly by [CONTACT_466] 31, March 30, June 30 and September 30 to allow time for Coordinating Center compi[INVESTIGATOR_344], Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_345], and timely submission to CTEP (see Section 12.11).  For trials monitored by [CONTACT_467], the monthly data su bmission to CTEP from Theradex should be copi[INVESTIGATOR_346]. 
 
The Coordinating Center is responsible for compi[INVESTIGATOR_347] #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_245] weekly and will include the protocol principal investigator, study coordinator(s), data manager(s), sub- investigators (as appropriate), 
collaborators (as appropriate), and biostatisticians (as appropriate) involved with the conduct of the protocol. During these meetings matters related to the following will be discussed: safety of protocol participants, validity and integrity of the data, enrollment rate relative to expectation, characteristics of particip ants, retention of participants, adherence 
to protocol (potential or real protocol violations), data completeness, and progress of data for objectives. 
 
12.3 Monitoring  
 
This is a DSMP Level III study under the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center (SKCCC) Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP, 12/6/2012, Appendix J). 
The protocol will be internally monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Dung Le. External data monitoring will be performed by [CONTACT_468] (CRO QA) at least quarterly, but may occur more or less frequently depending on the rate of accrual (per the DSMP). Additional data and safety monitoring oversight will also be performed by [CONTACT_469] (SMC - as defined in the DSMP) 
and a Medical Expert [INVESTIGATOR_493] (MEC) as detailed below.  
 This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_470] (CDUS) version 3.0.  Cumulative CDUS data will be submitted  quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_471].   Reports are due January 31, April 30, July 31, and October 31.  Instructions for 
submitting data using the CDUS can be found on the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov
).   
 Authorized representatives of the Coordinating Center may visit the satellite site (UCSF) 
to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The purpose of these audits or inspections is to systematically and independently examine all tri al-related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and any applicable regulatory requirements.  
 The Med ical Expert Committee (MEC) for this clinical study contains three medical 
oncologists from other disciplines who are not affiliated with this clinical trial protocol. The MEC will review safety data on at least a semi -annual basis. The MEC will provide a 
written summary of each assessment to the IND Sponsor -Investigator after each meeting. 
In turn, the study team will forward these summaries to the JHU  and UCSF  IRB, and JHU 
SKCCC SMC. The operating plan of the MEC will be as follows:  
• Meetings will be held at least semi-annually, and potentially more frequently if needed.  
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
89 
 • Meetings will be conducted in- person or via video/teleconference, with a 
participant sign -in sheet collected at each meeting.  
• Approximately one week prior to each MEC meeting, the study team will submit the following items to MEC personnel for review and discussion at the meeting (The PI [INVESTIGATOR_348]):  
o A summary of the clinical trial’s progress to date;  
o The latest IRB -approved consent document;  
o A summary of all adverse events, serious adverse events, deaths, and withdrawals to date; 
 
Note that the MEC reserves the right to halt trial accrual or all study activity if, after review, serious safety concerns warrant this action. If the MEC halts study accrual or all study activity, then the study team must notify the JHU SKCCC SMC, JHU and UCSF IRB, and 
the FDA immediately.

 13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 13.1 Study Design/Endpoints  
 
Primary objective:  To compare the overall survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with stable disease on FOLFIRINOX who then receive ipi[INVESTIGATOR_132] -CSF transfected pancreatic t umor vaccine to patients who continue to 
recei ve FOLFIRINOX.  
 Secondary objectives:  To evaluate safety and  characterize toxicities, specifically immune -
related adverse events, of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_353] t umor vaccine in 
patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, to assess p rogression- free survival 
(PFS) and immune -related PFS, and duration of response in patients receiving treatment, 
to assess the objective response rate by [CONTACT_478] -related response criteria in 
patients receiving treatment, and to measure tumor marker kinetics (CA 19 -9) in patients 
receiving treatment.  
 Exploratory objectives:  To collect peripheral blood lymphocytes and serum to identify potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers and predictors of response and autoimmune toxicity.  We will correlate induction of antigen specific T cell responses to mesothelin and 
changes in mesothelin- specific T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_354].  We will test if telomere 
length of lymphocytes can serve to help predict response.  Induction of galectin- [ADDRESS_250] treatment samples may identify additional therapeutic targets.  
   13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
Sample size . OS will be measured from the time of randomization after approximately [ADDRESS_251] known visit.  In the FOLFIRINOX study, approximately 53% of those alive at 6 
months survived an additional 6 months. Assuming an accrual period of 24 months with a 
minimum follow -up of 12 months, 92 patients (4 6 per arm) provide 82% power to detect 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
92 
 an HR of 1.65 from the null rate of 53% at 6 months with a 1- sided type 1 error rate of 
10%, i.e. an increase in the percent alive at 6 months from 0.53 for the FOLFIRINOX  arm 
to 0.68 for the I PI/Vaccine arm. The projected accrual rate is 3.8 patients per month .   Based 
upon these rates, a total of 75 deaths (34 in the  IPI/Vaccine arm  and 41 in the  
FOLFIRINOX  arm) are needed.    
 13.3 Stratification Factors  
 
Patients will be stratified based on the number of cycles of FOLFIRINOX (8 cycles or > 8 cycles) and by [CONTACT_384] . 
 13.[ADDRESS_252] 95% confidence intervals.  Continuous outcomes will be summarized using means with standard deviations and 95% confidence intervals (or medians and inter -quartile ranges if appropriate).  Comparisons between 
groups will be made using logistic regression and linear regression for binary and continuous variables.  Non- parametric alternatives (e.g. Fisher’s exact test or Kruskal -
Wallis tests) will be considered as needed. Specific toxicities will tabulated  by [CONTACT_479]. 
 For correlative studies, continuous variables will be summarized with means or medians and standard deviations. Dichotomous and categorical variables will be summarized using proportions with exact 95% confidence intervals and counts, respectively. These summaries will be computed for each patient both pre and post administration of each treatment. Plots will be used to show the changes in immune response over time both for each individual and for each arm. For each treatment, comparisons in the  pre and post -
treatment responses will be compared using paired t -tests (or Wilcoxon signed rank tests if 
appropriate) for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact tests for dichotomous or categorical variables. Associations between immune parameters will b e explored 
graphically (e.g. scatterplots, boxplots) and numerically (e.g. correlations, χ2 tests). Regression techniques (linear, logistic, linear mixed effects) will be used to explore the differences between the treatment arms.  
 We plan to examine the entire cohort as a whole as well as within the ipi[INVESTIGATOR_355] (10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg).  We will use a test of interaction to determine whether or 
not the relationship between the two treatment arms differs  significantly for the 10mg/kg 
and 3 mg/kg dose cohorts.  If the test of interaction is not significant, then the primary 
analysis will pool both cohorts.  If the test of interaction is significant, then the primary 
analysis will examine the  cohorts separately.    However, it should be noted that  we have 
limited power to detect such an interaction with the current sample size.  Therefore, it will 
be important to summarize the behavior within  each ipi[INVESTIGATOR_356].  
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_253] be assessed for response to treatment, even if there 
are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one of the following categories:  1) complete response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not assessable, insufficient data).  [Note:  By [CONTACT_480], category 9 usually designates the “unknown” status of any type of data in a clinical database.] 
 All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of those who received no study medication) should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories [ADDRESS_254] a t reatment failure (disease 
progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise definitions for categories [ADDRESS_255] been identified ( e.g., early death due to other reasons, early discontinuation 
of tre atment, major protocol violations, etc.).  However, these subanalyses may not serve 
as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.  The 95% confidence  
intervals should also be provided. 
 13.6 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_130]  
 
A single interim futility analysis will be performed once 50% of the information is collected, i.e. once [ADDRESS_256] ratio comparing the IPI/Vaccine arm to the 
FOLFIRINOX  arm will be calculated.  If the hazard ratio is greater than 1, i.e. the 
IPI/Vaccine arm is superior, then the trial will continue.  If the hazard ratio is less than or 
equal to 1, i.e. the IPI/Vaccine arm is not superior, then consideration will be given for 
terminating the trial early for futility.  Under the null hypothesis (i.e. both treatments are equally effective), the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_357] 50%.  The probabi lity for 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_358] 1.65 and 1.80 would be 6% and 3.5%, respectively.

APPENDIX A IMMUNE RELATED RESPONSE CRITERIA (irRC)*  
                            
*Note that the proposed irRC have been incorporated as secondary end points in addition to standard 
criteria and evaluate alternative patterns of response in various disease setting and treatment regimens.     
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
102 
 Immune Related Response Criteria  
 
For all patients who experience disease progression on study, the date noted for of disease 
progres sion is the time of the scan where it is originally detected, and not the following date of the 
confirmatory scan.  
Definitions of measurable and non- measurable disease  
Measurable disease: Neoplastic masses that can be precisely measured in [ADDRESS_259] a short -axis line -length of ≥ [ADDRESS_260] perpendicular.  
Non-measurable disease : Non -measurable lesions are those that are not suitable for quantitative 
assessment over time. These include:  
1) Neoplastic masses that are too small to measure, because their longest uninterrupted diameter 
or longest perpendicular are less than 10 mm. 
2) Neoplastic masses whose boundaries cannot be distinguished.  This includes masses which cannot be demarcated  from surrounding tissue because of inadequate contrast, masses with 
overly complex morphology, or those with highly heterogeneous tissue composition.   
3) Other types of lesions that are confidently felt to represent neoplastic tissue, but difficult to quantify in a reproducible manner. These include bone metastases, leptomeningeal metastases, malignant ascites, pleural/pericardial eff usions, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, ill- defined abdominal masses, etc.  
For irRC, only target lesions selected at baseline and measurable new lesions are taken into account.  
At the baseline tumor assessment, th e sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular 
diameters  (SPD) of all index lesions (five lesions per organ, up to 10 visceral lesions and five 
cutaneous index lesions) is calculated.   At each subsequent tumor assessment, the SPD of the index lesions and of new, measurable lesions 
(≥ 5 X 5 mm; up to 5 new lesions per organ: 5 new cutaneous lesions and 10 visceral lesions) are 
added together to provide the total time-point tumor burden.  
  
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, 2017 
 
103 
 Overall response using irRC:  
 Complete Response (irCR): Comple te disappearance of all tumor lesions (whether 
measureable or not, and no new lesions).  CR must be confirmed by [CONTACT_491], consecutive 
assessments made no less than [ADDRESS_261] documented.  
 Partial Response (irPR): Decrease in SPD of 50% or  greater by a consecutive assessment 
at least [ADDRESS_262] documentation.  
 Stable Disease  (irSD): Failure to meet criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD.   
 Progressive Disease (irPD): At least 25% increase in SPD relative to nadir (minimum 
recorded tumor burden) Confirmation by a repeat, consecutive assessment no less than [ADDRESS_263] documented.

Please note other key differences between irRC and the original WHO criteria:  
New measurable lesions will be incorporated into the SPD  New non measurable lesions do not define progression but preclude irCR Non-index lesions contribute to defining irCR (complete disappearance required). 
NCI Protocol #: 9478  
Version Date: February 10, [ADDRESS_264] Overall Response Using irR C (irBOR)  
  
irBOR is the best confirmed irRC overall response over the study as a whole, recorded between the date of 
first dose until the last tumor assessment before subsequent therapy (except for local palliative radiotherapy 
for painful bone lesions) f or the individual subject in the study. For the assessment of irBOR, all available 
assessments per subject are considered.  
 irCR or irPR determinations included in the irBOR  assessment must be confirmed by a second 
(confirmatory) evaluation meeting the criteria for response and performed no less than [ADDRESS_265] met.

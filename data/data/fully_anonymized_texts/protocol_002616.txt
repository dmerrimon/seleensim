Title: Prospective Study Comparing Brand and Generic Immunosuppression on Transplant 
Outcomes, Adherence, & Immune Response  in Kidney Transplant Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577880]: 4 
Study Phase: 4  
Research Hypothesis: Kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_317328] d generic tacrolimus will have 
outcomes that are not inferior to those who received brand tacrolimus during the  one-year study 
period.   
Primary Objective: To analyze the effects of use of brand tacrolimus versus generic tacrolimus , 
on a composite event of either acute rejection, or graft failure, or subject death.  
• Acute Rejection  will be  defined according to the Banff 2007 classification  
• Graft failure will be  defined as a return to dialysis, re -transplant, or death  
Secondary Objectives: To analyze the effects of use of brand tacrolimus versus generic 
tacrolimus on acute rejection, graft failure, subject  death, individual rates of infection, 
immunologic markers  of immunosuppression, subject  compliance , and subject acceptance . 
Study Design: Phase IV prospective, randomized, open labeled, multicenter, 2-group , parallel, 
observational study.  
Duration of Study:  1 year   
Number of Subjects: 200. Study Population: Kidney recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]; no  more than [ADDRESS_759278], Dose, Mode of Administration, and Duration of Treatment:  Brand 
tacrolimus, dosing to be determined by [CONTACT_577895] s’ study 
file, to be administered orally (tacrolimus level to be 4-11ng/dL)  for a duration of [ADDRESS_759279], Dose , Mode of Administration, and Duration of Treatment: Generic tacrolimus , 
dosing to be determined by [CONTACT_12682] n and recorded in subject s’ study file, to be 
administered orally (tacrolimus level to be 4-11ng/dL)  for a duration of 1 year.  
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Primary outcome measures:  
Time to a composite event, which is defined as the time to first occurrence of  acute rejection, 
failure, death.   
 
Secondary Outcome Measures:  
• Graft rejection at 1 year  after transplant  
• Graft failure at 1 year  after transplant   
• Incidence of infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 1 year  after transplant  
• Incidence of malignancy at 1 year  after transplant   
• Death or loss -to-follow -up at 1 year  after transplant   
• Adherence with medication regimen  
Version: 10Dec2019  ii  
Statistical methods: The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed as time -to-event, with follow -
up time measured in days from the date of transplant to  the date of composite endpoint.  
Statistical testing of time until composite event will be done for the intention -to-treat population, 
with adjustment for center (Cox regression).  Data will also be collected on subjects who are lost 
to follow up.   The in tention -to-treat population will consist of all randomized patients who 
received at least 1 dose of investigational drug (brand or generic tacrolimus).  
 
 
Version: 10Dec2019  1 1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Research Hypothesis  
 
Primary hypothesis:  
Kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577881]-year study period.    
1.[ADDRESS_759280]  death through a 
randomized trial of 2 parallel groups: Brand tacrolimus versus Generic tacrolimus . Given that 
kidney transplantation is the most commonly performed transplant with well -defined measures 
of rejection and graft failure, this organ will be studied in a four-center  study designed to accrue 
the target number of transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577882] 12-month  study period.  
1.[ADDRESS_759281]’s treating physician to approximate a real -world dos ing scenario. Please see protocol 
guidelines for trough level in Section 6.[ADDRESS_759282] 
report to the study staff any side effects or symptoms that he/she experiences.  
The potential risks and discomforts related to the subject’s participation in this study are listed 
below.  There may be other possible risks and discomforts, w hich are currently unforeseeable.    
 
 
 
Version: 10Dec2019  [ADDRESS_759283] common 
side effects of tacrolimus are infection, tremor, hypertension, abnormal kidney function, 
constipation, diarrhea, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, insomnia (difficult y falling asleep), 
weakness, urinary tract infection, pain, anemia, swelling of the arms, legs, or feet, decreased 
magnesium levels in the blood, decreased phosphate levels in the blood, increased lipid levels 
in the blood, and increased potassium levels i n the blood.  
Mild increases in potassium levels usually don’t cause any symptoms but very increased 
potassium blood levels can cause heart arrhythmias  (abnormal heart rhythm).  Heart arrhythmias 
can sometimes caus e the heart to stop beating , which may lead  to death. The potassium levels 
in the blood will be monitored during the study and if the level is elevated it can be treated with 
medications.  
Subjects treated with tacrolimus may develop swelling in the brain called posterior reversible 
encephalopathy ( PRES). Symptoms of PRES are headache , confusion , seizures, high blood 
pressure , and vision changes. PRES can be treated by [CONTACT_577896], with improvement of symptoms.  
Taking tacrolimus in any form can caus e diabetes , even in persons who never had diabetes 
before. Symptoms of diabetes can be increased thirst, urination and hunger. Diabetes can be 
treated with medications including insulin and the condition can improve after the tacrolimus is 
discontinued. Th e laboratory testing during the study will watch for this, but subject s will be 
instructed  to report to the study staff if they experience frequent urination or increased thirst or 
hunger.  
All anti -rejection medications may result in infections of the blood, body organs , or tissue s. 
These infections may be caused  by [CONTACT_577897], fungi (yeast and molds), or 
viruses, especially cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes viruses . There is an increased risk for 
opportunistic infections, including activa tion of latent viral infections , such as  BK virus 
associated nephropathy and JC virus associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. 
These and other types of infections in patients taking immunosuppressive drugs such as 
tacrolimus can be severe or fatal. The subject should avoid people with contagious diseases 
(including colds and flu) and keep cuts and scratches clean. Subjects will be instructed to  notify 
their study doctor right away of any new or unusual symptoms that they may experience.  
Immunosuppressive medications also increase the risk of cancer, which could be fatal. The 
most common cancers in a transplant patient are skin cancers and lymphomas or post- 
transplant  lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Lymphoma and PTLD  are disorders of the 
lymphocytes (one of the body’s white blood cells that can cause rejection). The development of 
lymphomas and cancers appear s to be related to the overall extent of immunosuppression, 
rather than to any specific drug. The overall risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_577883] 1% 
in transplant patients.  
Tacrolimus may cause other side effects. The subject should call the study doctor if he/she has 
any unusual problems while taking this medication.  
BLOOD DRAW RISKS  
Some people have disc omfort or pain when blood is collected. Insertion of a needle into the arm 
can cause some pain, swelling, bruising , and occasionally fainting reactions . Fainting reactions 
Version: 10Dec2019  [ADDRESS_759284] of their knowledge that they are  not 
currently pregnant and that they do  not intend to become pregnant during the study. Females of 
non-childbearing potential are defined as women who are postmenopausal (have not had a 
period in the pa st 12 months) or surgically sterile. For women who can still have children and 
who are not abstinent, [ADDRESS_759285] is not abstinent  and unable or 
unwilling to use 2 types of birth control during the study, she will not be allowed to enter the 
study. Women who use hormonal contraceptives  will be informed  that the medications used in 
this study may reduce the levels of the hormones in t he blood, which could make that form of 
birth control not work as well. For this study, acceptable forms of birth control are double -barrier 
methods (a condom plus a diaphragm or a condom plus a cervical cap, always used with a 
spermicide), hormonal contra ceptives (injected, implanted, or birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382]) used with another 
method, or an intrauterine device (Copper T, IUD) used with another method.  
Male participants in this study must be willing  to use the double -barrier method of birth control 
with thei r partners.  
Subjects will be instructed  to notify their study doctor immediately if they become pregnant  or if 
their female partner becomes pregnant.  If a subject becomes pregnant  during the study , she will 
be immediately withdrawn  and s tandard of care wil l be determined by [CONTACT_577898] , 
based on her condition and medical need . The subject or the subject’s  partner will be asked to 
sign a new consent form so the sponsor can collect follow -up information. The pregnancy will be 
monitored by [CONTACT_577899].  
 
1.4.2. Overall Benefits: Subject s may or may not receive a direct health benefit from 
participating in this study. They may learn more about what they think and feel about their 
transplant and medications and be able to track how those feelings and attitudes change over 
time during the study.  Participation in this study will help to gather information about generic 
tacrolimus, which  may be used in the future to improve the care o f transplant patients .

rejection, or graft failure, or death in brand versus generic  arms.   
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
Will compare in the brand versus generic  arms: 
• Graft rejection at 1 year  after transplant  
• Graft failure at 1 year  after transplant  
• Death at 1 year  after transplant  
• Loss -to-follow -up at 1 year  after transplant  
• Incidence of infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] 1 year  after transplant  
• Incidence of malignancy at 1 year  after transplant  
• Adherence with medication regimen  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN AND EVALUATION  
3.1 Study Design  
A prospective, randomized, open -label, multicenter, parallel, observational  study to compare the  
safety and efficacy of brand versus generic tacrolimus in 200 kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_228732] a 
one-year follow up period. All subjects will receive other im munosuppressive medications 
including induction therapy (thymoglobulin, basiliximab, or no induction) and maintenance , 
including mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroid therapy as directed by [CONTACT_38183] -of-care at 
each center. Their medication information w ill be recorded in their study files.   
The Phase [ADDRESS_759287] of 2 Arms : 
Arm 1: Brand Tacrolimus (Prograf) for entire study duration (12 months)  
Arm 2: Generic Tacrolimus for entire study duration (12 months)  
Additionally, the study consists of 2 Phases:  
Phase 1 : Subjects  have been  randomized into either Arm [ADDRESS_759288] been enrolled onto Phase 1 , Phase 2 will commence . 
Phase 2 : Subjects  will no longer be randomized. All subjects will be enrolled onto generic 
tacrolimus  because they have elected to receive generic tacrolimus  (standard of care from the 
subject’s insurance ). 
3.2 Study Population  
The study population includes recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577884] , no more than  14 days after 
transplantation and prior to discharge.  
3.3 Criteria for Evaluation  
Primary efficacy endpoints:  
Version: 10Dec2019  [ADDRESS_759289] occurrence of acute rejection, or g raft failure, or death.  The definition of graft failure 
includes re -transplant , return to dialysis, and/or death . The definition of acute rejection will be 
based on the Banff 2007 classification. For power considerations, it is assumed that overall 13% 
of subject s will experience this endpoint by [CONTACT_235850]-transplant.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
Secondary efficacy endpoints will include individual analyses of graft rejection, failure, death, or 
loss-to-follow-up at 1 year after transplantation . The cause of graft failure and death will also be 
analyzed. In addition , these individual endpoints and the composite endpoint will be evaluated 
by [CONTACT_551] (adult and elderly (>65) and ethnicity. Other endpoints will include,  rejection 
severity , death due to organ failure , and medication adherence . Adherence will be measured 
with daily medication diaries, and with the coefficient of variation of tacrolimus in subject s’ blood.  
 
 
Secondary safety endpoints : 
Secondary safety endpoints will include the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] , infectious epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] 
(bacterial , fungal , and viral ), development of malignancy, and development of new -onset 
diabetes after transplantation . 
3.4 Sample Size Determination  
The total number of subjects (200) is based on statistical calculation to have more than 80% 
power to detect a non -inferiority margin of 26 percentage points  of the composite endpoint of 
acute rejection, graft loss and death over the baseline of 13% in the  brand tacrolimus at one 
year post -transplantation. (See details in next paragraph.)   
For power considerations regarding the primary objective, the following assumptions are made:  
1. Subjects will be uniformly enrolled over 1 -year accrual period  
2. Primary anal ysis will be done via non -inferiority, log -rank tests on an intention -to-treat 
basis comparing generic recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Arm 2) with brand recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (Arm 1)  
3. Data will be also collected from standard -of-care records on subjects who are lost to 
follow -up 
4. Overall,  13% of subjects are expected to experience the primary endpoint by [ADDRESS_759290] rate for the reference group of –log (0.87) = 
0.14 
Given th ese assumptions, 200 subjects (if 50 and 15 0 in brand and generic groups, 
respec tively) are needed to observe 25 events (6 and 19 in brand and generic groups, 
respectively).  These numbers achieve >80% power at a 0.[ADDRESS_759291] ratio is 1.0.   PASS  statis tical software 
(version 13 .0) was used for calculation.  For completeness, we acknowledge that the study has 
80% power only for the specific set of conditions listed above and may lack canonical power 
when analyzing hypotheses involving secondary endpoints .

biotechn ology companies (e.g., stockholder, consultant), and any other relationship s that could 
be perceived as a conflict of interest related to the study objectives.   Members of the Board will 
include experts in subject  education, cultural tailoring, randomized controlled trials, and kidney 
transplantation.  
The Board will be instructed to review the study and its educational components to look for any 
component of the design or education that could result in harm of study participants. Data will 
be presented in a blinded manner during the open sessions of the DSMB. At DSMB meetings, 
data and discussion are confidential. There will be no DSMB for Phase [ADDRESS_759294] 
(DSMB)  for Phase 1 of the study . Safety endpoints and SAEs will be monit ored on a continuous 
basis.  
4 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
4.1 Dataset descriptions  
For all subjects enrolled in the study, d ata sets will be generated and updated at each study visit 
based on information collected during routine clinical care visits. Data  to be collected from 
routine clinical care will include:  
Donor variables: Age, sex, race, ethnicity, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) data, Blood type, 
Cause of death (if applicable), Cold ischemic time, Donor crossmatch results, Donor serologies 
(CMV, EBV H epatitis B and C), DCD and ECD donor status, Cadaveric or living (related or 
unrelated) donor  
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577885]: Age, sex, race, ethnicity, HLA data, Blood type, Transplant date, Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577886] (CMV, EBV Hepatitis B and C), Medical history includi ng presence of diabetes 
mellitus, PRA , single antigen testing , and  generic drug supplier . 
Medications: induction immunosuppression, maintenance immunosuppression, treatment for 
rejection and concomitant medications.  Kidney

Version: 10Dec2019  [ADDRESS_759295]-transplant follow -up: Rejection diagnosis (grade and method of confirmation) and date, 
Graft status and date of failure (if applicable), Cause of graft failure (if applicable), Death and 
Cause of death (if applicable), Dates of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], Biops y results and dates, Single 
antigen testing results and dates,  as well as Epi[INVESTIGATOR_496421] , including type of infection, 
type of organism, treatment, and response to treatment ..  
 
4.2 Statistical Analyses  (Aim 1 only)  
The primary research hypothesis s tates that subjec ts receiving generic tacrolimus (Arm  2) 
would exhibit a 1 -year survival rate non -inferior at a 26% margin to the rate amon g subjects 
receiving brand tacrolimus  (Arm 1).  The primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed as time -to-
event, with  follow -up time measured in days , from the date of transplant to the date of 
composite endpoint.  Statistical testing of time until composite event will be done for the 
intention -to-treat population.  A Cox regression analysis (adjusting for transplant cen ter via 
indicator variables) will be used to test the null hypothesis that H0: HR ≥ HR 0  versus the 
alternative hypothesis H1:  HR < HR [ADDRESS_759296] ratio of the generic group over the 
brand group at the margin set at 3.54 (i.e., a 26% non -inferiority margin).  The null hypothesis 
will be rejected if the upper bound of the 90% 2 -sided confidence interval (corresponding to a 
5% one -sided significance level) for HR is less than 3.54. 
Secondary analyses are described next but all are cons idered exploratory since formal testing 
of hypotheses is considered dubious given the small sample sizes of stratified subjects.   
Additional Cox models that incl ude indicator functions for the  generic arm (with brand serving as 
baseline) and/or stratifica tion based on age/race covariates will be used to estimate specific 
hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals to evaluate diff erences among recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577887] [ADDRESS_759297] ratios (graft rejection,  
failure, death) as well as point and interval estimates of group -specific survival rates at 1 -year 
(via Kaplan -Meier and Greenwood methods) are planned without adjustment for multiple 
comparisons.  
Standard descriptive summaries will also be used to report  and compare adherence (as 
measured with daily medication diaries, and with the coefficient of variation of tacrolimus in 
subjects’ blood) and immunologic endpoints (measured by [CONTACT_577900]).  
5.[ADDRESS_759298] SELECTION CRITER IA 
Recruitment: No recruitment flyers will be used in the study, as subject s will be recruited in 
person during their primary hospi[INVESTIGATOR_577888] -transplant visit . For 
entry into the study, all subjects must meet the follow ing criteria.

6.2 Study Therapy  
6.2.1  Clinical Sites : Kidney  recipi[INVESTIGATOR_577890] , UCSD , UCI, UC Davis Medical 
Centers. Mechanistic studies will be performed utilizing specimens collected from all sites.  
Adherence will be measured with daily medication diaries, and with the coefficient of variation of 
tacrolimus in subject s’ blood.   
 
6.2.2  References and comparator arms : During phase [ADDRESS_759304]-transplant.  During phase 2 of study, generic tacrolimus  will only be prescribed as part of 
their regular care upon discharge but no later than 1 4 days after transplant .  
6.2.3 Provision of investigational dru gs:  We anticipate that brand and generic tacrolimus will 
be provided for the entire study period  for Phase [ADDRESS_759305] through their insurance  for Phase 2 only .   (See letters from Astellas - 
Appendix 5)  
6.2.[ADDRESS_759306] s and sample size justification : We plan to enroll a total of [ADDRESS_759307] 20 will be African American 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  40 randomized subjects will be on Brand and 160 subjects will be on generic .

Eligible and consent ed subject s will be randomized into the 2 groups below : 
Arm 1 (n= 40) will receive brand tacrolimus for the entire study  
Arm 2 (n=160) will receive generic tacrolimus for the entire study  
According to their standard practice and attending physi cian and surg eon recommendation,  
subject s should also be on a maintenance regimen consisting of any of the following 
medications: mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolate sodium, corticosteroids, azathioprine . 
Concomitant belatacept administration is not permitted. To minimize confounding factors, efforts 
will be made between UCSD, UCI , UC Davis , and UCLA to synchronize a  similar  organ specific 
maintenance immunosuppr essive regimen  across  the four sites. However , each subject’ s 
maintenance regimen  will ultimately be at the discretion of the treating physician . The t acrolimus 
level will be maintained between 4-11 ng/dL during the duration of the study .

7.3 Details of Procedures  
Study Drug Dispensing:  
Drug Supply  
The investigator, or an authorized designee (e.g.,  a licensed pharmacist), will ensure that all 
investigational product is stored in a secured area, under recommended storage conditions, and 
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.  Drug supp ly will be received at the sites 
from Astellas in the form of bulk bottles, with the pharmacist or designated study staff allocating 
the necessary units to standard 30, 40, [ADDRESS_759324]’s insurance from their local pharmacy or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] . 
Compliance  
The diary will be used to verify compliance. If subjects demonstrate continued noncompliance of 
study drug dosing , despi[INVESTIGATOR_693] , the investigator may withdraw  the subject from 
the study.  
 
Local Labs:  
Local laborator ies at each study site  will be used for all standard -of-care (including tacrolimus 
trough levels) .  
 
Version: 10Dec2019  16 Safety Assessments : 
Safety assessments include AEs, clinically significant changes in vital signs, physical 
examination, and laboratory test abnormalities. The investigator will  determine the severity of 
each AE as mild, moderate, severe, or very severe in accordance to the Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE )1. In addition, the investigator will determine the 
relationship of the AE to the administration of the study drug.  
 
Urine or serum pregnancy tests will be performed prior to the first dose for all WOCBP. If any 
female subject becomes pregnant, she will be  immediately discontinued from study medication. 
Standard of care for a pregnant woman will be determined by [CONTACT_577901]. In addition, for women who become  pregnant while using MMF 
or within [ADDRESS_759325] ’s healthcare 
practitioner will report the pregnancy to the Mycophenolate Pregnancy Reference Registry  
([PHONE_2009]) and will strongly encourage the subject  to enroll in the pregnancy registry. 
The subje ct will also be apprised of the potential hazard of mycophenolate products to the fetus. 
The risks and benefits of MMF will be discussed with the subject . In certain situations, the 
subject  and her healthcare practitioner may decide that the maternal benef its outweigh the risks 
to the fetus.  
 
Trough level Monitoring:  
In case of study dose adjustments , transplant coordinators and study coordinator will collect and 
record subjects’ trough levels and dose adjustments from their medical records. Subjects will s ign 
a separate HIPAA ( Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) Form  to allow 
access to their medical record information.  
 
 
[ADDRESS_759326]  
Astellas will supply brand tacrolimus:  
Oblong, hard capsule for oral administration contains anhydrous tacrolimus USP as follows:  
• 0.5 mg, light -yellow color, imprinted in red “0.5 mg” on the capsule cap and “logo607”* 
on capsule body  
• 1 mg, white color, imprinted in red “1 mg” on the capsule cap and “logo617”* on capsule 
body 
• 5 mg, grayish -red color, imprinted with white “5mg” on the capsule cap and “logo657”* 
on capsule body

9 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING IN CLINICAL TRIALS  
 
1 http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf  
Version: 10Dec2019  [ADDRESS_759328] medical 
occurrence, thereby [CONTACT_17155]: (1) protection of the safety of study subjects; (2) a greater 
understanding of the overall safety profile of the drug products; (3) recognition of dose -related 
toxicity; (4) appropriate modification of study protocols; (5) improvements in study design or 
procedures; and (6) adherence to worldwide regulatory requirements.  
 
9.2 Adverse Events : Adverse events will be recorded using the current definition of National 
Cancer Institute common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE).  
 
Definitions:  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Adverse Event (21 CFR 312.32(a): An adverse event (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, and does not imply any 
judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise with any use of the drug (e.g., off -label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and with any route of administration, formulation, or 
dose, including an overdose.  
Serious Adverse Event:  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening 
adverse event, in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or 
significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ab ility to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate 
medical judgment, th ey may jeopardize the patient  or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Life-Threatening Adverse Event:  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life -threa tening” if, in the view of 
either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the subject  or subject at immediate risk 
of death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might ha ve caused death.  
 
 
9.3 Collection of Safety Information  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre -existing medical condition in a subject  or clinical investigation subject administered an 
investigationa l (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associate d with the 
use of investigational product, whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
Version: 10Dec2019  [ADDRESS_759329]. Subjects will be a sked to report any AEs to the study 
team.  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event;  it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe)  
• requires in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312] (see 
note below for exceptions)  
• results in persistent or significa nt disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
An important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based on appropriate medical and scientific 
judgm ent, may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to 
prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but 
are not limited to intensive treatment in an emergency department or at hom e for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (e.g., any organism, virus or infectious particle, 
pathogenic or non -pathogenic) via the study drug is an SAE . 
Although pregnancy, overdose and cancer are not always serious by [CONTACT_8661], these 
events must be handled as SAE s (See Section 9.4 for reporting pregnancies).  
NOTE: The following hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8609]:  
• a visit to the emer gency room or other hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8610] 24 hours 
that does not result in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a 
life threatening event)  
• elective surgery planned before signing consent  
• admissions as per protocol  for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
• routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status 
(e.g., routine colonoscopy)  
• medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state that was 
planned bef ore study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
• admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g., lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respi[INVESTIGATOR_040], family circumstances, administrative).  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examinati on, or evaluation of a subject . If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or 
Version: 10Dec2019  19 disorder should be recorded, rather than its individual symptoms. The following information 
should be captured for all AEs: onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to 
investigational product , action taken, and treatment required. If treatment for the event was 
administered, it should be recorded in the study file. The investigator must supply the IRB with 
any additional information requested, notably for reported deaths of subjects.  
If an ong oing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information 
becomes available, a follow -up SAE report should be sent using the same procedure used for 
transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs and AEs should be followed to res olution or 
stabilization.  
The collection of non -serious adverse event (NSAE) information should begin at initiation of 
study drug. NSAE information should also be collected from the start of period or other 
observational period intended to establish a base line status for the subjects. NSAEs and AEs 
should be followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. 
Follow up is also required for NSAEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug, or 
those that are pres ent at the end of study treatment as appropriate. All identified NSAEs must 
be documented appropriately.  
Adverse Events will be reported to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) according to regulations.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting to the Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA)  
• Adverse Event Reporting  
o Within 10 working days of discovery: PI [INVESTIGATOR_577893] /SAE  to the 
FDA Project Office r (PO) (Murewa Oguntimein)

Version: 10Dec2019  [ADDRESS_759332] be  
reported on the AE/SAE CRF (refer to Section 9.4).Pregnancy follow -up should describe  
the outcome of the pregnancy, including any voluntary or spontaneous termination, details of 
the birth, the presence or absence of any congenital abnormalities, birth defects, maternal or  
newborn complications and their relations to the study drug.  
 
10 ADMINISTRATIVE SECTION  
 
10.1 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions  
 
The investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior 
review and documented approval/favorable op inion from the IRB  of an amendment, except 
where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) t o study subjects. Any significant 
deviation must be documented.  
 
If a deviation or change to a protocol is implemented to eliminate an immediate hazard(s)  
prior to obtaining IRB approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], as soon as possible the deviation or change 
will be submitted to:  
 
• IRB for review and approval/favorable opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]

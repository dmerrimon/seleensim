Title DOSE OPTIMIZATION TRIAL OF AUTOLOGOUS T CELLS 
ENGINEERED TO EXPRESS ANTI-CD19 CHIMERIC ANTIGEN 
RECEPTOR (CART-19) IN PATIENTS WITH RELAPSED OR 
REFRACTORY CD19+  CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LE[LOCATION_006]EMIA (CLL) 
Short Title  CD19 redirected autologous T cells 
Protocol Number s , UPCC [ZIP_CODE],  
Phase [ADDRESS_1261734] relapsed or refractory CLL  or SLL (3rd line)  
Methodology  This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to determine the 
optimal dose of CART -19 cells (autologous T cells expressing CD19 
chimeric antigen receptors expressing tandem TCRζ and 4 -1BB 
costimulatory domains)  of the two dose levels being assess ed (1-5x108 
vs. 1-5x107 CART-19 cells). This trial will be conducted in two 
stages.  
 
In Stage I, s ubjects will be randomized into one of the two dose 
cohorts with 1:1 ratio as below:  
1) Arm 1: Target dose of 1  x108 to 5x108 CART-19 transduced 
cells  
2) Arm 2: Target dose of 1  x107 to 5x107 CART-19 transduced 
cells  
 
In Stage I, approximately 30 subjects are expected to be randomized 
to ensure a total of 24 subjects (approximately 12 evaluable subjects  
in each arm ) are evaluable for primary efficacy analysis. Safety, 
tolerability, and clinical response rates will be evaluated to determine 
a dose cohort  for expansion.    Subjects with cell doses less than the 
stated range will receive their cells, but will be scored as 
“manufacturing failures”.  They will be evaluated for safety endpoints  
and followed in the same way as subjects that have received the target 
dose, but will not be evaluable for primary endpoints  and will be 
replaced for the purposes of the study.  We will target the upper dose 
level but accept t he lower dose range as a “successful” manufactured 
product.  Anything below the lower limit will be considered a 
manufacturing failure, will follow the study protocol and will be 
monitored for safety and disease response, but will not be evaluable 
for the other endpoints (other than feasibility ) on this protocol.  
Subjects with cell doses less than cell doses above will be replaced for 
analysis. No more than 20% of the total enrollment may be 
manufacturing failures. If this is exceeded a separate modificati on will

may be explored prior to the start of Stage 2.  
 
In Stage 2, t he selected dose cohort will be expanded to enroll 
additional  subjects, to ensure that  a total of 20  evaluable subjects are 
treated at that dose level.  Based on t he Stage 1 analysis performed in 
November 2014 , Arm 1 was chosen for expansion in Stage 2. 
Therefore, the Stage 2 dose will be 1 -5x108 transduced CART -19 
cells.  The dose of 1 -5 x 108 T-cells in Stage 2 will be administered 
via split dosing: 10% on Day 1  (1-5x107), 30% on Day 2  (3x107-
1.5x108), 60% on Day 3  (6x107-3x108). 
 
Evaluable subjects are defined as those who were able to receive the 
viable product at the intended dose level and have completed at least [ADDRESS_1261735] a sufficient dose 
remaining, subjects will be remanufactured under Stage 2 conditions 
and receive th e split dose. Subjects orig inally treated under Stage 2 
will also receive the split dose for retreatment.  
 
 
Study Duration  Enrollment:  
 Stage 1: A pproximately 18 months* 
 Stage 2: Approximately 12 months*   
Follow-up: 12 months 
Total study duration: approximately 42 months 
* Assumes adequate manufacturing and clinic capacity  
 
Safety and clinical response will be assessed every month for the first 
six months, followed by [CONTACT_899972] a total of [ADDRESS_1261736]-study follow -up: annual follow -up for lentiviral vector safety will 
continue under a separate destination protocol for [ADDRESS_1261737] 
infusion in accordance with FDA guidelines for retroviral vectors.

Based on t he Stage 1 analysis performed in November 2014 , Arm 1 
was chosen  for expansion in Stage 2. Therefore, the Stage 2 dose will 
be 1-5x108 transduced CART -19 cells.  The dose of 1 -5 x 108 T-cells 
will be administered via split dosing: 10% on Day 1  (1-5x107), 30%

 Adequate organ system function in cluding: 
o Creatinine < 1.6  mg/dl 
o ALT/AST < 3x upper limit of normal  
o Total Bilirubin <2.0 mg/dl  
 Any relapse after prior autologous SCT will make patient eligible 
regardless of other prior therapy  
 Patients with relapsed disease after prior allogeneic SCT 
(myeloablative or nonmyeloablative) will be eligible if they meet 
all other inclusion criteria and:  
o Have no active GVHD and require no immunosuppression

or PR) to therapy , but have subsequently progressed  within [ADDRESS_1261743] <5% CART19 cells in the CD3+ population by [CONTACT_899974]  
3. Subjects have recovered from any toxicity attributed to the initial 
CART19 infusion, such as CRS.  
 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1261744] 9 0% 
confidence interval (CI) will also be computed. Data from the two 
dose groups will be analyzed separately.   All evaluable patients per 
arm will be included for the analysis. If [ADDRESS_1261745] infusion (i.e., an 
observed 3 -month CR rate of 33%), then the lower bound of the 90% 
CI will exclude 10%. Specifically, the 90% exact CI would be (12%, 
61%). At the end of the expansion cohort, the  width of the exact 90% 
CI will be less than 20% based on  20 patients. For an observed 3 -
month CR rate of 30% (i.e., 6 out of 20 had CR  or CRi), the 90% 
exact CI would be (14%, 51%).  
 
Analysis of other  secondary or exploratory endpoints will be 
descriptive and may include summary statistics such as means and 
standard deviations or Kaplan -Meier curves f or time-to-event survival 
information  if appropriate .   
 
Safety and efficacy a nalyses for patients  in retreatment cohort  will be 
exploratory and used to generate hypotheses for future studies.  
Feasibility endpoints will be analyzed using a ll patients who are 
evaluated for cell expansion.

Figure 1b-Study Design Schema –  Stage [ADDRESS_1261746] common leukemia in Western countries accounting for approximately 30 percent 
of all leukemias in the [LOCATION_002]1. CLL is considered to be mainly a disease of the elderly, with 
a median age at diagnosis of 70 years2; however, it is not unusual to make this diagnosis in younger 
individuals from [ADDRESS_1261747] never curative.  About 60% of first-line patients will go on to receive second-line therapy 
including ~ 20% of patients who do not respond to first-line therapy (the refractory pool) and those 
patients who relapse after achieving a response. About one-half of second-line patients will either 
die before receiving the next line of chemotherapy or may be alive and not receive the next line of 
therapy either due to age, comorbidities or lack of available options4.  
 
CLL is a B-cell neoplasm. In most cancers, tumor-specific antigens for targeting are not well 
defined, but in B-cell neoplasms, CD19 is an attractive target. CD19 is a 95kDa glycoprotein 
present on B cells from early development until differentiation into plasma cells5-7. It is a member 
of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily and a component of a cell surface signal transduction 
complex that regulates signal transduction through the B cell receptor7-9. Mice lacking CD19 have 
a decreased number of B cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, a decreased B cell response to oral 
vaccines and mitogens, and decreased serum Ig levels7, 10.  
 
CD19 is not present on most normal tissues, other than normal B cells, including pluripotent blood 
stem cells11, which makes CD19 a relatively safe target presenting a minimal risk of autoimmune 
disease or irreversible myelotoxicity. Anti-CD19 antibodies and scFvs either native or conjugated 
to radioisotopes or toxins are currently being developed and have demonstrated promise in both

vectors can be constructed because the scFv bind to native cell surface epi[INVESTIGATOR_899942]. The tumor binding function of CAR is usually accomplished by

joined by a peptide linker of about [ADDRESS_1261750] generation CARs contain 
further advancements such as triple costimulatory modules comprised of CD28, 4-1 BB, and TCRζ. 
See reviews of CARs for details33-35. 
 
Autologous T cells will be engineered using a lentiviral vector to express an extracellular single 
chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for CD19. This will be expected to redirect specificity of 
the transduced T cells for cells that express CD19, a molecule that is restricted in expression on 
the surface of the malignant cells and on normal B cells. In addition to the CD19 scFv, the cells 
will be transduced to express an intracellular tandem signaling domain comprised of 4-1BB and 
TCRζ signaling modules. Clinical grade CD19 TCRζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector will be manufactured 
at the Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6684] (CHOP) and City of Hope Center for Applied 
Technology Development. The extracellular single chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for 
CD19 was previously reported21. The scFv is derived from a mouse monoclonal antibody using 
hybridoma cell line FMC63 described in Nicholson et al.21. The signaling domains are entirely of 
the native human sequences36, 37. 
 
The CART-19 cells will be manufactured in the Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility at 
the University of Pennsylvania. CART-19/4-1BB cells are resuspended in cryopreservation media 
containing 31.25% Plasmalyte-A, 31.25% Dextrose 5%, 0.45% NaCl, 10% Dextran 40, 20% 
Human Serum Albumin, and 7.5% DMSO. Cells are frozen in bags using a controlled-rate freezer. 
Cryopreserved CART-19 products are stored in a monitored freezer at ≤-130°C.  The target dose 
of CART-19 cells is calculated based on the scFv percent transduction efficiency (see section 5.4  
for unthawing and infusion instructions). 
 
Absorption, distribution and metabolism. Lymphocytes have complex trafficking and survival 
kinetics, and after adoptive transfer several fates have been demonstrated: 1) margination; 2) exit 
from the peripheral blood trafficking to lymphoid tissues; and 3) death by [CONTACT_20983]. Following an 
intravenous dose, retrovirally modified and adoptively transferred T cells have been shown to 
persist in the circulation for at least [ADDRESS_1261751] an elimination half life from the 
peripheral blood of about 8 days, and this increases to about 16 days when low doses of IL-2 are 
given72. In patients with HIV infection, we found that the mean half life of lentivirally modified 
CD4 T cells in the circulation of 5 patients following a single infusion was 23.5 (± 7.7) days in 
patients. Adoptively transferred human T cells have been shown to traffic to tumor and secondary 
lymphoid tissues38-41.   
 
Drug interactions. CART-19 cells are expected to retain many of the properties of natural T cells. 
As such, they will be expected to be susceptible to immunosuppressive agents such as 
corticosteroids, immunophilins such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, methotrexate, mycophenolate 
mofetil, mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin, alemtuzumab, daclizumab, denileukin difitox, and

are commonly administered for hematologic malignancies such as cyclophosphamide and 
fludarabine. 
 
Immune elimination. An important consideration is that the CAR can be immunogenic, either 
because foreign sequences such as antibiotic selection genes or mouse antibody sequences are 
expressed, or because of novel epi[INVESTIGATOR_834407]. Immunogenicity of the CAR can lead to the rejection 
of the adoptively transferred T cells. The basis for this supposition is that human retrovirally-
modified CTLs expressing a fusion protein consisting of hygromycin:HSV thymidine kinase were 
eliminated by [CONTACT_729307]42; importantly, this immune 
mediated elimination was not accompanied by [CONTACT_729308] 6 to 8 weeks to occur. 
There is one report where CAR containing a scFv with mouse sequences has been given to cancer 
patients. Following a single dose of CAR T cells (0.6 to 4 x 109 T cells), the CAR T cells were 
detected in circulation from 23, 32, and [ADDRESS_1261752] two decades has documented that 
maximal activation, proliferation and persistence of T cells responding to antigenic stimuli is 
dependent on receipt of two discrete signals mediated by [CONTACT_614179]. The primary 
“activation” signal is generated by [CONTACT_729296] (typi[INVESTIGATOR_729257] I molecules) and the second signal by [CONTACT_614181] a 
costimulatory molecule with its cognate ligand. T cell costimulatory molecules which have been 
identified to date include members of the immunoglobulin super-family (CD28), members of the 
tumor necrosis factor (TNF) super-family (e.g. CD40L, CD134 [OX-40], CD137 [4-1BB]44. 
 
One issue that needs to be addressed with CARs is that signaling through the cytosolic domain of 
the usual scFv-TCRζ single chain construct does not fully replicate the multichain TCR signaling 
complex45, 46. Chimeric receptors bearing TCRζ signaling modules are sufficient to trigger 
sustained proliferation in T cell hybridomas and clones but are not sufficient to drive proliferation 
or cytokine production in peripheral T cells45. 4-1BB is a T cell co-stimulatory receptor induced 
by [CONTACT_614182], and evokes various T cell responses47. We and others have observed that 4-
1BB signals are critical for long term proliferation of CD8 cells, and that CD28 is essential for 
sustained CD4 cell proliferation48, 49. We have begun to investigate the requirement for 
costimulation in our CD19-CAR by [CONTACT_899976]. Our preclinical data are in accordance with the results from other 
laboratories50, 51, and indicate that “bipartite receptors” comprised of TCRζ and either CD28 or 4-
1BB signaling modules substantially improve the function and proliferation of T cells.  The 
coalescence of improved T cell culture methods and lentiviral vector technology have made it 
possible to test this novel CD19 CAR- T cell concept, as we have done so in 3 patients and plan to 
continue to evaluate in this protocol with additional patients.

with bulky CLL and extensive prior therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. The patient received autologous T cells modified to 
express a CD19-targeted CAR at a dose of 3 x 107 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with high-dose 
cyclophosphamide. This patient developed fever, hypotension, and dyspnea [ADDRESS_1261754] likely trigger in this heavily 
pretreated immunosuppressed patient66. The other adverse event occurred in a patient with colon 
cancer who received a high dose (> 1010 ) of CAR T cells modified with a CAR targeting HER2 
containing two costimulatory moieties (CD28 and 4-1BB) after intensive lymphodepletion. The 
subject developed pulmonary toxicity within [ADDRESS_1261755] died from 
an on-target cytokine storm resulting from high numbers of cells localizing in the lung after 
infusion and recognizing low levels of the antigen on lung tissue67. Another example of on -target, 
off-organ toxicity occurred in a clinical trial in which patients were given T cells engineered to 
express a chimeric antigen receptor that was specific for carbonic anhydrase IX (cAIX), a 
transmembrane protein that is overexpressed by [CONTACT_899977]67. In all three patients, 
severe liver toxicity ensued within [ADDRESS_1261756] greater success than previous CAR constructs, since in vivo  these cells 
proliferate more and persistent longer, and retain effector functions, therefore amplifying and 
sustaining effective anti-tumor responses. For recent reviews of CAR T cell trials, see PMID 
22818942, 22308288 , 22538493 , 22262649 , 21358705, 22781680 . 
1.5 Rationale for the study design 
This is a randomized, open-label, parallel group study to determine the optimal dose of CART- 19 
cells of the two dose levels being assessed (1 -5x108 vs. 1-5x107). This trial will be conducted in 
two stages. In the first stage, approximately 30 patients are expected to be randomized to ensure a

efficacy analysis. Randomization will allow for a greater degree of comparability between the two 
arms than if there were two independent trials. Safety, tolerability, and clinical response rates will 
be evaluated to determine a dose cohort with a minimum of 30% three-month complete response 
(CR) rate for expansion. If appropriate, an additional dose level may be explored.   
 
In the second stage, t he selected dose cohort will be expanded to enroll additional subjects to 
ensure that a total of [ADDRESS_1261757] 20 
evaluable subjects treated at the same dose level will provide enough confidence in the estimated 
efficacy and safety assumptions that will be used in future trials for patients with refractory or 
relapsed CLL. 
1.6 Rationale for dose and regimen selection 
Based on the current manufacturing limitations and recent clinical experience from ongoing trials 
(UPCC , UPCC  and UPCC ), the target dose levels of 1-5x108 and 1-5x107 
CART-[ADDRESS_1261758] a significantly lower percentage of CD3+ 
cells in leukapheresis products than subjects with other types of hematologic malignancy.  
Lentiviral transduction and expansion therefore could be limited in the setting of fewer CD3+ cells. 
As was observed in clinical protocol UPCC , manufacturing success rates declined to 
approximately 50% when targeting [ADDRESS_1261759] likely because the 
CAR T cells are able to proliferate extensively in the patients, and thus the actual in vivo amount 
of CART-19 T cells after engraftment and expansion will vary from patient to patient.   
 
The upper range of the target dose was chosen because it is anticipated to be safe based on recent 
clinical experience from the ongoing trials as mentioned above, and because it will permit 
sufficient engraftment in order to evaluate the primary and secondary endpoints of this study. 
 
Based on the Stage 1 interim analysis performed in November 2014,  Arm 1 (1-5x108 CART-19 
cells) was chosen for expansion in Stage 2. At the beginning of Stage [ADDRESS_1261760] treated in Stage 2 ([ZIP_CODE]-51), 
experienced early CRS within [ADDRESS_1261761]’s clinical status improved 
in response to anti-cytokine therapy.   
 
Based on this clinical experience and efforts to improve subject safety, the subsequent CLL 
subjects enrolled in Stage 2 of this study will be treated with the selected dose of 1-5 x 108 T-cells 
administered via split dosing: 10% on Day 1, 30% on Day 2, 60% on Day 3.  Our initial pi[INVESTIGATOR_899944] T cells in CLL (UPCC ) gave a similar dose of T cells split over 3 days. Additional ly,

“cytokine sinks”, enhancing the availability of cytokines such as IL-7 and IL-15 72. This hypothesis 
has been tested clinically in patients with metastatic melanoma refractory of conventional 
treatments39. The patients received a lymphodepleting conditioning regimen consisting of 
cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg x 2 days) and fludarabine (25 mg/m2 x 5 days) prior to adoptive 
transfer of T cells. We have treated patients with myeloma and lymphopenia after lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy, and observed improved engraftment73, 74.  
 
In this protocol CART-[ADDRESS_1261763] conditioning is more than simply “making room” because the 
quantitative recovery of adoptively transferred T cells in mice reveals that in vivo proliferation 
following adoptive transfer is identical in mice with or without previous irradiation.   
1.8 Benefit and Risk Assessment 
General safety. Participation in this study will expose the patient to genetically engineered 
autologous T cells. The risk of the cells alone is low based on clinical experience. The unknown 
risk is that of the signaling domains in the CAR. T cell proliferation could be uncontrolled; 
however we have not observed this in our pre-clinical models. In this case, corticosteroids and 
chemotherapy would be given to eradicate the CAR cells; this has worked in previous cases43.  
At the University of Pennsylvania we have treated >[ADDRESS_1261764] received a single i.v. 
infusion of 1x1010 lentiviral modified T cells; in the second protocol, each subject received up to 
[ADDRESS_1261765] the scFv; this has not had clinical consequences in previous 
trials. If an immune response to the cells occurs, it is possible that the cells will be rejected. Three 
of [ADDRESS_1261766] B cell depletion is also a potential risk 
with CART-19 cells, since normal B cells express CD19.  This is expected to resolve when the 
CART-19 cells are cleared. In the meantime, patients may require periodic infusions of 
immunoglobulin.

Transformation. There is a risk that people who receive gene transfer may develop new tumors 
derived from their genetically modified cells. This risk is primarily associated with viral gene 
transfer vectors that integrate into the cellular DNA where they may dysregulate genes controlling 
proliferation. Transformation has not been observed following adoptive T cell transfer in hundreds 
of cancer and HIV patients receiving gamma retroviral modified T cells treated on multiple 
protocols at many academic centers34, and in the 21 HIV patients treated with lentiviral modified 
T cells treated at University of Penn sylvania77.    
 
Risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) related to cytoreductive chemotherapy or CAR T cells.  The 
risk of TLS is dependent on the disease and burden of disease, but in most cases, this risk will be 
low. These are not front line CLL patients. Patients will be closely monitored both before and after 
chemotherapy and CART-19 infusions including blood tests for potassium and other relevant 
chemistries.  Patients will receive hydration and allopurinol or rasburicase to minimize any toxicity 
should signs of significant acute tumor lysis begin to occur. 
 
Cytokine release syndrome and Macrophage Activation Syndrome.  Patients treated with CART-
19 may experience a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which has correlated with disease response.  
Clinical manifestations have included high fevers, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, headache, 
rash, hypotension (occasionally requiring pressor support), tachypnea,  hypoxia (occasionally 
requiring ventilator support), delirium and confusion (in several patients), evidence of disseminate 
intravascular coagulation as well as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).  In some cases CRS, 
TLS and hypotension have led to acute kidney injury and several patients have required at least 
transient dialysis.   The CRS has been effectively abrogated with an ti-cytokine directed therapy 
including tocilizumab in most patients.  As of July 2014, three patients on another CART-[ADDRESS_1261767] been observed in patients treated with CART 19, 
coincident with clinical manifestations of the CRS.  MAS appears to be a reaction to immune 
activation that occurs from the CRS, and therefore should be considered a manifestation of CRS.  
 
Macrophage activation syndrome is similar to Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH); it is a 
reaction to immune stimulation by [CONTACT_80601], autoimmune diseases or other precipi[INVESTIGATOR_32895], but is 
distinguished from familial or genetically mediated HLH.  There are no definitive diagnostic criteria 
for MAS, but it is typi[INVESTIGATOR_834410]. 
 
Some but not all features of MAS are typi[INVESTIGATOR_218206].  The clinical syndrome of MAS is 
characterized by [CONTACT_834450]-remitting fever, cytopenias affecting at least two of three lineages, 
and hepatosplenomegaly.  It is associated with biochemical abnormalities, such as high circulating 
levels of serum ferritin, soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sCD25), and triglycerides, together with a 
decrease of circulating NK activity.  Other findings include variable levels of transaminases up to 
signs of acute liver failure and coagulopathy with findings consistent with DIC. A pathologic 
feature of MAS is the presence of hemophagocytic CD163+ macrophages (HPC) in bone marrow 
or lymph-node aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026].

autosomal recessive disorders (familial HLH, fHLH).  
 
A diagnosis of non -familial HLH/MAS is made by [CONTACT_7661] 5/8 criteria: 
 Fever 
 Splenomegaly 
 Cytopenias (affecting 2 or more lineages in the peripheral blood; hemoglobin <9 g/dL, 
platelets <100,000/ L, Absolute neutrophil count <1000/ L) 
 Fasting triglycerides >265 mg/dL , Fibrinogen   < 1.5 g/L 
 Hemophagocytosis in bone marrow or spleen or lymph nodes  
 Low or absent NK-cell activity 
 Ferritin  > 500 g/L 
 Soluble CD25R > 2400 U/L 
Supportive clinical criteria include neurologic symptoms and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_1304] ﬂuid pleocytosis, 
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and transaminitis, hypoalbuminemia and hyponatremia. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_899945], cytopenias, and when performed hemophagocytosis in the bone marrow is observed 
(though marrow specimens at the time of the reaction are not often taken). Soluble CD25R and NK 
cell activity are not standard tests, though samples are taken for retrospective CD25R analysis.  
Therefore, patients may not meet strict definition of HLH/MAS, but given the constellation of 
findings, and the consistent dramatic elevation in Ferritin, this is indeed the reaction associated with 
the CRS.   
 
At this time it is still unknown wheth er CRS/MAS is beneficial or harmful to the antitumor 
response.  Research monitoring data showed that IL6 levels were extraordinarily high during the 
CRS, prompting us to use an anti-IL6 receptor antibody tocilizumab to treat the CRS/MAS. Four 
adult patients have been treated with tocilizumab for CRS and MAS.  The majority of patients 
treated with tocilizumab for CRS and MAS had rapid (within hours) resolution of dramatic fevers, 
and continuous improvement in hypotension and hypoxia over hours to several days, and showed 
improvement in biochemical evidence of CRS and MAS within 48 hours.  Adult patients were 
treated with tocilizumab 4mg/kg or 8mg/kg.   It is unclear if early treatment will negate the 
antitumor response.  Treatment and timing of treatment of this toxicity will be at the discretion of 
the patient’s physician and the study investigator, and occur in the setting of hemodynamic 
instability.  
 
Pediatric ALL patients treated with CART-[ADDRESS_1261768] experienced a similar CRS and 
MAS. CHP959-100 experienced a severe CRS and had high fevers, hypotension, acute vascular 
leak syndrome and acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506]. The patient was treated with etanercept and 
tocilizumab, as described in Grupp et al., NEJM, 2013 , and all associated adverse events resolved. 
CHP959-104 and CHP959-105 received the 10% dose only and experienced CRS. CHP959-103 
received the 10% and 30% doses, respectively, and experienced a mild CRS after the 10% dose, 
with no CRS experienced after the 30% dose. None of these patients experienced were severe 
enough CRS (i.e. there were no instances of more than transient oxygen requirements, or 
hypotension requiring pressor support) requiring treatment with steroids or cytokine blockade.

with malignancy.  Brentjens et al designed a retrovirally-transduced CAR against the CD19 
molecule for patients with B cell lymphoma. The CD19 CAR was the second generation design 
containing CD28 and CD3ζ signaling domains. A total of [ADDRESS_1261769] received pre-T cell conditioning with 
1.5g/m2 of cyclophosphamide followed 2 days later by [CONTACT_899978]19 
CAR T cells at 1.2-3x107 cells/kg. Twenty hours following T cell infusion, the patient developed 
persistent fever (transient fever was observed in the first 3 subjects on the study too) and 
hypotension that was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_899946] x-ray,

Analysis of serum cytokines revealed elevated levels of IL-2, IL-7, IL-15, and IL-[ADDRESS_1261770] likely cause of 
death and attributed the etiology of the death as “possibly related” to CAR T cell infusion79.  
 
The second case of a fatal SAE related to CAR T cells was reported by [CONTACT_834455] (Morgan et 
al. 2010). This study attempted to treat cancer patients with overexpressing ERBB2 tumors with 
an anti-ERBB2 CAR  of 3rd generation (containing CD28, 41BB and CD3ζ signaling domains). 
The first subject in the study was a 39-year-old female with colon cancer metastatic to lungs and 
liver. The patient received lymphodepleting regimen (60mg/kg cyclophosphamide daily for 2 days 
followed by [CONTACT_453918] 25mg/m2 for the next 5 days) followed the next day by [CONTACT_899979]-
transduced 1010 ERBB2 CAR T cell (transduction efficiency 79%). At 15min post-infusion, the 
patient began to develop dyspnea and hypoxia with pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray. The 
patient progressed into hypoxemic respi[INVESTIGATOR_899947], 
vasopressor-dependent hypotension, and cardiopulmonary arrest. The patient was initially 
resuscitated and started on high dose steroids, but despi[INVESTIGATOR_834415], the patient

3 Study Design 
3.1 General Design 
This is a randomized, parallel group study to determine the optimal dose of CART-19 cells of the 
two dose levels being assessed (1-5x 108 vs. 1-5x107). This trial will be conducted in two stages.  
 
In Stage I, subjects will be randomized into one of the two dose cohorts with 1:1 ratio as below: 
1) Arm 1: Target dose of 1 x108 to 5x108 CART-19 transduced cells  
2) Arm 2: Target dose of 1 x107 to 5x107 CART-19 transduced cells  
 
In Stage I, approximately 30 patients are expected to be randomized to ensure a total of 24 subjects 
(approximately 12 patients in each arm ) are evaluable for primary efficacy endpoint analysis . 
Primary efficacy evaluable patients are those who have received CART-[ADDRESS_1261772] been randomized to (1-5x108 and 1 -5x107 CART -19 cells for 
Arms 1 and 2, respectively). These patients will be evaluable for primary efficacy endpoints. 
Safety, tolerability, and clinical response rates will be evaluated to determine a dose cohort with a 
minimum of 30% three-month complete response (CR) rate for expansion.  
 
Subjects with a manufactured cell dose that is less than the protocol-specified dose will be scored 
as a manufacturing failure. These subjects will receive their cell infusion, provided that the 
manufactured dose is above the CVPF minimum acceptable dose for infusion (2x106 CART-19 
cells) and all other manufacturing release criteria are met. The subjects that are infused with lower 
than the protocol specified dose for their randomized arm are primary efficacy non-evaluable 
patients. They will not be included in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. However, they will 
be included for secondary efficacy, safety, manufacturing, correlative and exploratory endpoint 
analyses. 
  
For the purposes of the study, primary efficacy non -evaluable patients will be replaced with primary 
efficacy evaluable patients. Both primary efficacy evaluable and non-evaluable patients will be 
followed in the same manner according to the Schedule of Study Procedures for all evaluations, 
including clinical, research (correlative) and safety. 
 
All patients receiving ≥2x106 CART -19 will be assessed for clinical response according to the 
criteria discussed in Section 7.  Again, patients scored as manufacturing failures and receiving 
less than the dose for their randomized arm will not be included in primary efficacy endpoint 
analysis (see Section 8.3 ). Table 3-[ADDRESS_1261773] has been 
released. The minimum CART-19 dose for this protocol that will be released from CVPF for 
infusion is 2x106; therefore, this is the lowest dose that will be administered to subjects under this 
protocol. Patients who choose to receive their released CART-19 dose that falls below the 
protocol-specified dose will be clinically followed for safety and efficacy exactly the same as those 
patients who receive their CART-19 dose that falls within the protocol-specified range (i.e. the 
primary efficacy evaluable patients). The only difference between the primary efficacy evaluable 
and non-evaluable patients is that only the primary efficacy evaluable patients will be used for 
primary efficacy endpoint analysis. Both primary efficacy evaluable and non-evaluable patients 
will be used in secondary efficacy, safety, manufacturing feasibility, correlative and exploratory 
analyses. The statistical analysis sets are detailed in Section 8.3.

retreatment with CART19 cells ranging from 2-12 months after the initial infusion(s) retreated 
with CART19 cells as of February 1, 2014. Given the currently available safety data, there is no 
suggestion that retreatment of these targeted subjects will pose risks to the subject greater than that 
of their original infusion. Additionally, [ADDRESS_1261775] experienced clinical 
benefit with few alternative treatment options available. Therefore, retreatment with additional 
CART19 doses carries potential benefit with no observable increased risk associated with the

Three types of subjects will be eligible for retreatment.  
 The first group are subjects initially treated in Stage 1 of this trial (who receive a one-time 
bulk dose infusion), who have previously manufactured cells available and meet criteria 
for retreatment.  These subjects will receive retreatment with a one- time dose of previously 
manufactured cells as described here.   
 The second group of subjects are those treated in Stage 2 on an amended version of the 
protocol (As of Protocol Version 12. 03-05 -2015) and will have received split dose 
infusions as described (10% on Day 1; 30% on Day 2; 60% on Day 3), and meet eligibility 
criteria for retreatment.  They will be retreated in the same manner as their initial treatment 
and receive split dose infusions as described.   
 The third group of subjects are subjects initially treated in Stage 1 of this trial (who receive 
a one-time bulk dose infusion), and who meet criteria for retreatment, but do not have 
previously manufactured cells available.  These subjects will undergo a new T-cell 
collection for manufacturing, and will receive cells split dosing fashion (10% on Day 1; 
30% on Day 2; 60% on Day 3). 
 
Up to one retreatment dose (either single or split) will be allowed per eligible subject.   The 
target dose for this retreatment cohort is 1-[ADDRESS_1261776] Selection and Withdrawal

Please see Section 6.[ADDRESS_1261778] an adequate number of T cells that can be successfully 
transduced and expanded with the CD19 TCRζ/4-1BB lentiviral vector (≥ 4-fold expansion 
needed), as determined from a sample of PBMC obtained by [CONTACT_899981] 
(~week -8). The purpose of this screening procedure is to exclude subjects from participation who 
would otherwise undergo a futile apheresis and restaging, without the possibility of having the 
source T cells obtained by [CONTACT_834461] T cells. There will be a minimum 
of 6-[ADDRESS_1261779] to determine 
eligibility. 
 
Female subjects of reproductive potential (women who have reached menarche or women who 
have not been post-menopausal for at least [ADDRESS_1261780] not undergone a sterilization procedure [hysterectomy or 
bilateral oophorectomy]) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within [ADDRESS_1261781] agree not to participate in 
a conception process (e.g., active attempt to become pregnant or to impregnate, sperm donation, 
in vitro fertilization). Additionally, if participating in sexual activity that could lead to pregnancy, 
the study subject must agree to use a reliable method of contraception during their participation in 
the study. 
 
Acceptable birth control includes one of the following methods: 
 Condoms* (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent 
 Diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide 
 Intrauterine device (IUD) 
 Hormonal-based contraception 
 
Subjects who are not of reproductive potential (women who have been post menopausal for at least 
[ADDRESS_1261782] undergone hysterectomy, salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and/or bilateral 
oophorectomy or men who have documented azoospermia) do not require the use of contraception.  
Acceptable documentation of sterilization, azoospermia, and menopause is specified below: 
 
Written documentation by [CONTACT_305680]’s staff through one of the following: 
 Physician report/letter   
 Operative report or other source documentation in the subject record (a laboratory report 
of azoospermia is required to document successful vasectomy)  
 Discharge summary of sterilization procedure or hysterectomy, and/or salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], 
oophorectomy  
 Laboratory report of azoospermia  
 Follicle stimulating hormone measurement elevated into the menopausal range

discontinued the study. The reasons for premature discontinuation (for example, voluntary 
withdrawal, toxicity, death) must be recorded on the case report form. Final study evaluations will 
be completed at the time of discontinuation.    
 
Potential reasons for premature discontinuation include: 
1. The subject is lost to follow-up.   
 
2. The judgment of the principal investigator. 
 
3. Patient noncompliance with study therapy and/or clinic appointments. 
 
4. Pregnancy: Withdraw patient if pregnancy occurs prior to the CART-19 T-cell 
infusion  
 
5. Voluntary withdrawal; a patient may remove himself/herself from the study at any 
time without prejudice. A patient may withdraw from the study at any time they wish 
to withdraw consent.   
 
6. Significant and rapid progression of malignancy, requiring alternative medical, 
radiation or surgical intervention including, but not limited to, the development of 
CNS metastasis  if this occurs prior to the CART- 19 T-cell infusion .

cancer therapy, and 3) survival until the time of death; until the patient withdraws consent for 
clinical data collection or the end of the study (Last Patient/Last Visit).  
 
Patients who are followed at other institutions or practices, because of preference or geographical 
concerns will have follow-up via notes from their local physician and/or phone interviews with 
periodic study assessments done at HUP.  An example would be a patient referred from out of state 
but cared for at another center.  We will obtain toxicity and other clinical assessments from the 
treating physician, and follow the patient as described in the table in Appendices 1 and 2. In 
numerous previous cell therapy trials at the University of Pennsylvania, loss of follow-up is 
estimated to occur in less than 5% of cases. Every effort will be made to contact [CONTACT_899982]-up in order to at least obtain survival data. In the event a subject fails 
to complete the follow-up requirements, documentation of all attempts to contact [CONTACT_899983] 3 telephone contacts (on different days and at different times of the day), and a 
certified letter. 
 
After subjects’ complete or premat urely discontinue participation in this study, subjects will also 
be asked to participate in a separate [ADDRESS_1261785] been engineered to express an extracellular single 
chain antibody (scFv) with specificity for CD19 linked to an intracellular signaling molecule 
consisting of a tandem signaling domains comprised of the TCRζ signaling module linked to the 
4-1BB costimulatory domain. The CART-19 cells are cryopreserved in infusible cryomedia and 
will be administered as one bag on Day 1. Each bag will contain an aliquot (volume dependent 
upon dose) of cryomedia containing the following infusible grade reagents (% v/v): 31.25% 
Plasmalyte-A, 31.25% dextrose (5%), 0.45% NaCl, up to 7.5% DMSO, 1% dextran 40, 5% human 
serum albumin.  
 
Expected toxicities associated with infusion of CART-19 cells include transient fever, chills 
nausea, rigors, hypotension, tumor lysis syndrome, and cytokine release syndrome.  In order to 
minimize these events, patients will receive premedication as instructed below.  Toxicities that 
could potentially occur but are unprecedented are primarily related to the gene transfer and are 
described in the Risk and Benefit section (refer to section 1.8).   These include generation  of a 
replication competent lentivirus ( RCL), insertional oncogene sis, and uncontrolled  proliferation  of 
the CART-19 cells.  
 
5.2 Patient Eligibility to Receive CART-19 Transduced T Cells 
Day 1 CART-19 Infusion: 
1. All patients must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] (RVP ) within [ADDRESS_1261786] planned CART -19 infusion. If the patient is positive for influenza, Tamiflu® 
or equivalent,  should administered for [ADDRESS_1261787] safety or t he subjects’ ability to 
receive CART -[ADDRESS_1261788] resolved. Note:  If 
patients CART -19 infusion is delayed > 4 weeks from cy toreducti ve chemo therapy, 
the cytoreductive chemotherapy should be repeated. The specific toxicities warranting 
delay of T cell infusions include:  
a. Pulmonary: Requirement for supplemental oxygen to keep saturation greater 
than 95% or presence of radiographic abnormalities on chest x-ray that are 
progressive 
b. Cardiac: New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management 
c. Hypotension requiring pressor support 
d. Active Infection(s) : as evident by [CONTACT_560589], fungus, 
or virus  within 48 hours of CART-19 cell infusion . 
 
Day 2 CART-19 Infusion: 
1. Patie nt should not exp erien ce a signifi cant change in performance or clinical 
status compa red to their previous study visit th at would, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_899948], increase the risk of experimental cell infusion. 
2. Patients experiencing new laboratory abnormalities, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_899949]’ ability to receive CART-[ADDRESS_1261789] their infusion delayed until both the treating investigator and PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_899950]-19 infusion.  
 
Day 3 CART-19 Infusion: 
1. Patie nt should not exp erien ce a signifi cant change in performance or clinical 
status compa red to their previous study visit th at would, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_899948], increase the risk of experimental cell infusion. 
2. Patients experiencing new laboratory abnormalities, that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_899951]’ ability to 
receive CART -[ADDRESS_1261790] CART-19 infusion will be scheduled to occur approximately 1 to 4 days 
following lymphodepleting chemotherapy but may be delayed as outlined above (Section 5.2). 
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug 
Cell manufacturing is done according to Figure 3  und er  at the University of 
Pennsylvania Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility (CVPF) . The CART -19 T cells are 
prepared in the CVPF and are not released from the CVPF until FDA approved release criteria for 
the infused cells (e.g., cell dose, cell purity, sterility, average copy number of vectors/cell, etc.) are 
met. Upon release, the cells are administered at the bedside.  
 
Cell thawing   
The cells will be transported by [CONTACT_899984]’s bedside.  The cells will be thawed 
at the bedside or in the CVPF by [CONTACT_899985] a water bath maintained at 36 C to 38C.  
The bag will be gently massaged until the cells have just thawed.  There should be no frozen 
clumps left in the container by [CONTACT_899986] I.V. tube. If the CART-[ADDRESS_1261791] a damaged or leaking bag, or otherwise appears to be compromised, it should not 
be infused, and should be returned to the CVPF.  
 
Premedication 
Side effects following T cell infusions include transient fever, chills, and/or nausea. It is 
recommended that the subject be pre-medicated with acetaminophen (650 mg) and 
diphenhydramine hydrochloride (25-50 mg IV/PO) at least [ADDRESS_1261792] fever 
not relieved by [CONTACT_58086]. Patients should not receive systemic corticosteroids such as 
hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone (Solu-Medrol) or dexamethasone (Decadron) at any 
time, except in the case of a life-threatening emergency, since this may have an adverse effect on

Packaging and Labeling 
CART-19 transduced T cells will be administered at a dose of 1-5x108 given via split dosing on Days 
1, 2 and 3.  Each infusion bag will contain an  aliquot (volume d ependent upon  dose) o f cryomedia 
containing the following  infusible grade reagents (% v/v): 31.25% plasmalyte-A, 31.25% 
dextrose (5% ), 0.45% NaCl,  up to 7.5% DMSO,  1% d extran 40, 5% human serum albumin. 
 
Each infusi on bag will have affixed  to it a label containing information regarding the dose, the 
method of manipulation, the vector and “FOR AUTOLOGOUS USE ONLY .”  In addition the 
label will have the following unique identifi ers patient name, study ID, and patient birth d ate. 
Prior to each infusion, two  individuals will independ ently  verify all unique identifier 
information in the p resence of the patient and  to confirm that the information is correctly matched 
to the p atient.

5.[ADDRESS_1261797] Compliance Monitoring 
The investigator- initiated phase I/II trials at the UPenn Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) are 
subject to routine auditing  in accordance with their high risk policy.  Ongoing monitoring of e ach 
patient is performed by [CONTACT_729332].   
6 Study Procedures 
The study consists of 1) a screening phase, 2) a randomization and arm assignment stage (Stage 1 
only), 3) an intervention/treatment phase consisting of apheresis, chemotherapy (to be determined 
according) to the investigator and dependent on the patient’s disease burden and histology), 
infusions of CART-[ADDRESS_1261798] scans and tumor collection by [CONTACT_57925][INVESTIGATOR_899952] (optional, depending on availability), and 4) follow up. Schedule of evaluations and 
infusion are included in Appendix 1 . 
6.1 Pre-Entry Evaluations (Screening) and Subject Number Assignment (Week -8 to -
12) 
Each subject is identified in the study by a Subject Number (Subject No.), that is assigned when 
the subject is first enrolled for screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the subject  
throughout his/her entire participation in the trial. The Subject No. consists of the Center Number 
(Center No.) (as assigned by [CONTACT_258418]) with a sequential subject number 
suffixed to it, so that each subject is numbered uniquely across the entire database. Upon signing 
the informed consent form, the subject is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available to 
the investigator. Once assigned, the Subject No. must not be reused for any other subject and the 
Subject No. for that individual must not be changed, even if the subject is re-screened. 
If the subject fails screening for any reason, the reason will be entered into the Screening 
Disposition page. 
 
After informed consent and demographic information are obtained, blood te sts to determine 
eligibility are performed, and a blood sample is sent to the CVPF to determine T cell manufacturing 
feasibility.  Adverse events and concomitant medications will be recorded beginning from the time 
the patient’s informed consent has been obtained. In approximately [ADDRESS_1261799]’s PBMC are likely to be adequate for large scale CART-[ADDRESS_1261800] expansion. During the screening period, inclusion and exclusion criteria will be 
assessed. Also, subjects will be tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

6.4 Apheresis (Week -4) 
Subjects will undergo the additional following assessments: 
 
a) Current medical conditions  
b) Concomitant medications 
c) Adverse events 
d) Leukapheresis (as mentioned below) 
e) Research  labs: Cytokine assessments  
 
A large volume (12-15 liters or ~2-3 blood volumes) apheresis procedure is carried out at the 
apheresis center. PBMC are obtained for CART-[ADDRESS_1261804] 5 x 109 white blood cells to manufacture CART-19 T cells. Baseline blood 
leukocytes for FDA look-back requirements and for research are also obtained and cryopreserved 
(1 x 108 cells from apheresis to TCSL). The cell product is expected to be ready for release 
approximately 4 weeks later. Baseline cytokines will be measured.  If T cells were previously 
collected on another research study, and are acceptable to use to manufacture T cells for this study, 
they may be used in lieu of repeating apheresis.   
6.5 Cytoreductive chemotherapy (Week -1) 
In preparation for cytoreductive chemotherapy (detailed below), the subjects will undergo the 
following assessments: 
 
a) Current medical conditions   
b) Concomitant medications 
c) Adverse events 
d) Cytoreductive chemotherapy (as mentioned below)

It is anticipated that many patients have been receiving chemotherapy for relapse or resistant 
disease. Patients referred with stable disease on no recent therapy will be eligible.   Prior to the 
first CART-19 cell infusion, an additional chemotherapy cycle for lymphodepletion is planned if 
clinically indicated.  The regimen of chemotherapy will be at the discretion of the investigator and 
dependent on the patient’s disease burden and histology. The preferred chemotherapy and 
lymphodepletion is fludarabine [ADDRESS_1261805] a medical contraindication to either of these drugs, or a

initiation therefore depends on the length of the regimen. The purpose of the chemotherapy is to 
induce lymphopenia in order to facilitate engraftment and homeostatic expansion of CART- 19 
cells.  In addition, chemotherapy can potentiate the ability of T cells to kill tumor cells91, 92. The 
chemotherapy is not investigational and may be given by a patient’s local oncologist within the 
specified time frame. 
 
All patients must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] (RVP) within [ADDRESS_1261807] planned 
CART -19 infusion. If the patient is positive for influenza, Tamiflu® or equivalent, should 
administered for [ADDRESS_1261808] 7 days to be sure 
clinical symptoms of a viral infection do not develop.  If clinical symptoms develop, the infusion 
will be delayed until resolution of these symptoms. 
6.6 CART-19 Pre-Infusion (Day -1) 
Subjects will undergo the following work-up including: 
 
a) Current  medical conditions and physical examination (including vital signs, height, 
weight, body surface area as clinically indicated) 
b) Performance status assessment 
c) Concomitant medications 
d) Adverse events 
e) Hematology (complete blood count, differential and platelet count) 
f) Chemistry panel (Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Total 
Protein, Albumin, Total Bilirubin, Alk Phos, AST, ALT, Mg, Phos, LDH, Ferritin, CRP 
and Uric Acid) 
g) Urine pregnancy test  
h) Baseline screens for HLH/MAS:  triglycerides and haptoglobin 
i) Baseline screen for coagulation factors:  PT, PTT, INR, fibrinogen, D-dimer 
j) Research labs:  Molecular (including VSV- G), cytokine and cellular assessments   
6.7 CART-19 Infusions (Days 1, 2, and 3) 
The first CART-19 infusion  should begin 1 to 4 days after completion of cytoreductive 
chemotherapy.  The dose will be administered as a split infusion of 1 to 5 x 108 total CART -19 
transduced cells: 10% on Day 1 (1-5x107), 30% on Day 2 (3x107-1.5x108), 60% on Day 3 (6x107-
3x108). Patients will be infused and premedicated as described in Section 5.4.  
 
Prior to each infusion, patients will undergo the following assessments:

The cells are thawed at the patient’s bedside or in the CVPF by [CONTACT_21724]. The thawed cells 
will be given at an infusion rate as quickly as tolerated so that the duration of the infusion will be 
approximately 2 -20 minutes. In order to facilitate mixing, the cells will be administered 
simultaneously using a Y-adapter. Subjects will be infused and premedicated as described in 
Section 5.4. Vital signs (temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation 
by [CONTACT_406]) will be measured within [ADDRESS_1261810]’s 
vital signs are not satisfactory and stable three hours post- CART -[ADDRESS_1261811] each infusion for 
cytokine assessment and molecular persistence testing (and sent to the TCSL- please refer to 
Section 6.8).  
 
Patients experiencing toxicities from their preceding cytoreductive chemotherapy will have their 
infusion schedule delayed until these toxicities have resolved. The specific toxicities warranting 
delay of T cell infusions include: 1) Pulmonary: Requirement for supplemental oxygen to keep 
saturation greater than 95% or presence of radiographic abnormalities on chest x-ray that are 
progressive; 2) Cardiac: New cardiac arrhythmia not controlled with medical management. 3) 
Hypotension requiring pressor support. 4)  Active Infection: Positive blood cultures for bacteria, 
fungus, or virus within 48-hours of T cell infusion. 
 
A serum sample for potassium will be collected before each  infusion (as part of the chemistry 
panel) as well as approximately two hours after each infusion (separate blood sample).

6.13 Long-term Follow- up Protocol 
After subjects’ complete or prematurely discontinue participation in this study, subjects will be 
asked to participate in a separate 15 year long-term follow-up destination protocol.  This long-term 
follow-up protocol includes evaluations p erformed for up to 15 years on all subjects as 
recommended by [CONTACT_614207].  Evaluations will 
include:  physical exam and medical history (including concomitant medications and adverse 
events) with careful attention to features possibly related to onco-retroviral diseases such as cancer, 
neurologic disorders or other hematologic disorders. In addition, labs will be drawn to evaluate 
engraftment, CART19 PCR and research labs.  Blood for a VSV-G DNA test will be drawn yearly 
in order to detect RCL. If all VSV-G DNA tests are negative during the study period to the first 
annual evaluation, then future plasma samples may be archived for analysis on an as needed basis.

Three types of subjects will be eligible for retreatment.  
 The first group are subjects initially treated in Stage 1 of this trial (who receive a one-time 
bulk dose infusion), who have previously manufactured cells available, and who meet 
criteria for retreatment.   These subjects will receive retreatment with a one-time dose of 
previously manufactured cells as described here.   
 The second group of  subjects are those treated in Stage 2 on an amended version of the 
protocol (As of Protocol Version 12. 03-05 -2015) and will have received split dose 
infus ions as described (10% on Day 1; 30% on Day 2; 60% on Day 3), and meet eligibility 
criteria for retreatment.  They will be retreated in the same manner as their initial treatment 
and receive split dose infusions as described.   
 The third group of subjects are subjects initially treated in Stage 1 of this trial (who receive 
a one-time bulk dose infusion), and who meet criteria for retreatment, but who do not have 
previously manufactured cells available.  These subjects will undergo a new T-cell 
collection for manufacturing, and will receive cells split dosing fashion (10% on Day 1; 
30% on Day 2; 60% on Day  3). 
 
The target dose for this cohort is 1-[ADDRESS_1261821] additional cells to

The above response criteria are consistent with NCCN Guidelines Version 2.2012 CLL/SLL, 
which is based on the 2008 International Workshop Group on CLL (IWCLL) revisions of the 
original guidelines for evaluating disease response released in 1996 by [CONTACT_899980] (NCI/WG)84.  
 
Group A criteria define the tumor load.   Group B criteria define the function of the 
hematopoietic system (or marrow). 
 
Complete response (CR):  all of the criteria must be met, and patients have to lack disease-
related constitutional symptoms attributable to CLL (ie. ≥10 percent unintentional weight loss 
within the previous six months, fatigue that interferes with work or usual activities, fevers greate r 
than 100.5ºF (>38ºC) for ≥2 weeks, or night sweats for >1 month). 
 
Complete response with incomplete marrow recovery (CRi): CR in the setting of hypocellular 
marrow. 
 
Partial response (PR): at least two of the criteria of group A plus one of the criteria of group B 
must be met.

Partial response with incomplete marrow recovery (PRi):  PR in the setting of hypocellular 
marrow. 
 
Stable disease (SD):  Patients who do not meet the criteria for a complete remission, partial 
remission, or progressive disease, have stable disease. Stable disease is therapeutically equivalent 
to a nonresponse.  
 
Progressive disease (PD): appearance of any new lesions; at least one of the above criteria of 
group A or group B have been met. Includes Richter's transformation (the development of an 
aggressive large-cell lymphoma) as documented by [CONTACT_9256]. Also, cytopenias that occur at least 
three months after the completion of therapy and are accompanied by [CONTACT_899993]. Isolated progressive 
lymphocytosis in the setting of reduced lymph node size or organomegaly of improvement in 
hemoglobin/platelets will not be considered PD. 
 
Calculating Tumor Burden: Tumor burden at baseline is calculated as the sum of the volume of 
bone marrow involved with CLL, the peripheral blood CLL burden and the volume of tumor 
masses in spleen and nodal masses as determined in volumetric CT scans. Tumor burden 
reduction is calculated from the tumor assessments done post therapy, and the best overall 
response calculated by [CONTACT_899994]. The estimates of total CLL mass are then converted to total CLL cell 
number using 1 kg = [ADDRESS_1261825] stage, subjects will be randomized into one of the two dose levels (ARM 1:  1 -5x108 
CART-19 transduced cells vs. ARM 2: 1 -5x107 CART-19 transduced cells) with 1:1 
randomization ratio. Approximately twelve (n=12) evaluable subjects will be enrolled into each 
arm.  Safety, tolerability, and rate of complete response by [ADDRESS_1261826] stage, the lower dose level associated with 3-month CR rate (including

higher dose level has a 16.7% higher CR rate, or equivalently having ≥[ADDRESS_1261827] 
reached an observed 3-month CR rate of ≥30%, the study may be stopped. 
 
Stage 2 
The Stage 1 analysis performed in November 2014 led to choosing Arm 1 for expansion in Stage 
2. Therefore, the Stage 2 dose will be 1-5x108 transduced CART-19 cells. The dose of 1-5 x 108

and starting no later than [ADDRESS_1261834] treatment date will be flagged in the listings. 
 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (new or worsening from baseline) will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term and maximum toxicity grade (based on CTCAE 
v4.03).  A patient with multiple CTC grades for an AE will be summarized under the maximum 
CTC grade recorded for the event.  The frequency of CTC grade 3 and 4 AEs will be summarized 
separately.   In addition, AEs related to study drug will be presented by [CONTACT_92869], 
preferred term, and maximum CTC grade.   Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be summarized 
separately.

The frequency of manufacture failure will be calculated. Associations between patient 
characteristics and the likelihood of manufacture failure will be evaluated.

infusion(s) . In addition, the incidence of CD19 escape mutants  will be determined in blood, bone 
marrow and lymph node aspi[INVESTIGATOR_899954]19 expression, as compared to base line tumor 
samples. These data will help inform on CART [ADDRESS_1261836] and in vivo persisting CART 19 cells may be 
further characterized by [CONTACT_59567], flow cytometry-based phenotypic and functional 
assays. These data will help to inform potential predictive markers of CART-19 efficacy but are 
not formal study objectives   
8.9 Retreatment Cohort Analysis  
Safety and efficacy endpoints for those subjects participating in the retreatment cohort will include 
frequency and severity of adverse events,  overall response, time to response, duration of response 
and time to alternative therapy, expansion and persistence of CART19 cells. Definition and 
statistical methods used for those endpoints will be the same as described in Sections 8.4 and 8.5 
but with the start of the observation time as time of the re-infusion. Data analyses for the 
retreatment cohort will be exploratory and performed separately from the analyses for the initial 
infused subjects. In particular, we will use statistical methods appropriate for paired data (e.g., 
paired t-test, McNemar test) to compare endpoints from the same subject between the first and re-
infusion.  Results from these analyses will be used to generate hypotheses for future studies.  
8.10 Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)  
EORTC QLQ-C30 and CLL16 raw summary scores will be generated by [CONTACT_899997]. Raw scores will be summarized using means and 
medians at each assessment time point and for each domain for each treatment group. Patients 
will be asked to complete the questionnaire at baseline, chemotherapy week, end of treatment 
(day 28), 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after treatment. 
 
EORTC QLQ-C30 
The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality of Life 
Questionnaire ( QLQ -C30) contains 30 questions that incorporates nine multi -item scales: five 
functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); three symptom scales (fatigue, 
pain, and nausea and vomiting); and a global health and quality -of-life scale. Several single -item 
symptom measures are also included (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, diarrhea, and 
financial impact).  [Aaronson NK, et al.  J Natl Cancer Inst 85: 365 -376, 1993]

9 Safety and Adverse Events 
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_899998] C riteria (CTCA E) version [ADDRESS_1261837] symptoms if a diagnosis can 
be assigned.  
9.1 Definitions 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others 
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  
 Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency   (i.e. not described in study-related documents 
such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators brochure, etc) 
 Related or possibly related to participation in the research (i.e. possibly related means there 
is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome may have been caused 
by [CONTACT_3459]) 
 Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm). 
 
Adverse Event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illne ss or experience that develops or worsens in 
severity during the course of the study that occur after the patient has signed the informed consent.  
Intercurrent illnesses or injuries should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal laboratory values 
or test results of diagnostic procedures occurring after the informed consent are considered to be 
adverse events if the abnormality: 
 results in study withdrawal 
 is associated with a serious adverse event

ENTIAL 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530].   is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
 leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests 
 is considered by [CONTACT_899999] (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, "reasonable 
possibility" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and th e 
adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
 
Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction  (21 CFR 312.32(a))  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the 
investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an 
investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. 
For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as 
occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
Serious Adverse Event 
Adverse events are classified as serious or non-serious.  A serious adverse event  is any AE that is:  
 fatal 
 life-threatening 
 requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], unless hospi[INVESTIGATOR_062]: 
o Routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with 
any deterioration in condition, such as preplanned study visits and preplanned 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_899956] 
o Elective or pre-planned treatment for a pre-existing condition that is unrelated 
to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed 
consent 
o Treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the 
definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_063] 
o Social reasons and respi[INVESTIGATOR_064]’s 
general condition 
 results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
 a congenital anomaly or birth defect 
 an important medical event 
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, but are clearly of 
major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the subject, and may require intervention to 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1261838] resolved.  
 
Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition 
should be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition 
worsens during the study period.  
 
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition 
on the medical history eCRF.  During the course of the study if any pre-existing conditions worsen 
or 
require additional intervention than these should be recorded as adverse events and indicated as 
worsening events.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities 
that meet the definition of an adverse event must also be recorded and documented as an adverse 
event.  
 
 
Post-study Adverse Event 
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by [CONTACT_1374], 
the subject is lost to follow-up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled 
visit, the investigator should instruct each subject to report any subsequent event(s) that the subject, 
or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this 
study.  The investigator should notify the regulatory sponsor of any death or adverse event 
occurring at any time after a subject has discontinued or terminated study participation that may 
reasonably be related to this study.  The sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should 
become aware of the development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently 
conceived offspring of a subject that has participated in this study.   
 
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if any one of the 
following conditions is met:   
 The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to confirm the 
abnormality

Version 12.03-05 -2015 
CONFID
ENTIAL 
This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530].   The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity 
 The abnormality is of a degree that requires active management; e.g. change of dose, 
discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow-up assessments, further diagnostic 
investigation, etc. 
 
Laboratory abnormalities that meet the criteria for Adverse Events should be followed until they 
have returned to normal or an adequate explanation of the abnormality is found. When an abnormal 
laboratory or test result corresponds to a sign/symptom of an already reported adverse event, it is 
not necessary to separately record the lab/test result as an additional event. Laboratory 
abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an adverse event, should not be reported as adverse 
events. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe) as per CTCAE does not automatically indicate a SAE unless 
it meets the definition of serious as defined below and/or as per investigator’s discretion. A dose 
hold or medication for the lab abnormality may be required by [CONTACT_107], by 
[CONTACT_108], an adverse event. 
 
Laboratory abnormalities due to underlying disease and chemotherapy regimen are expected and 
will not be reported as adverse events (e.g. abnormal hematology values, mucositis, etc.). 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_37022] a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this 
protocol.  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an adverse event if the 
condition meets the criteria for and adverse event. As was noted above, events related to the 
cytotoxic chemotherapy will be excluded from adverse event reporting.   
 
Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an 
adverse event in the following circumstances: 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5110] a preexisting condition.  Surgery should not be reported as an outcome 
of an adverse event if the purpose of the surgery was planned, elective or diagnostic and 
the outcome was uneventful. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233696]. 
 Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_16458], unless it is a worsening or increase in frequency of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_633964]. 
9.[ADDRESS_1261839], or other assessments. Information on all adverse events 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event 
module of the case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal 
diagnostic procedures results should recorded in the source document, though should be grouped 
under one diagnosis.   To the extent possible, adverse events should be recorded as a diagnosis and 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1261840] symptoms 
if a diagnosis can be assigned.  
 
All adverse events occurring during the adverse event reporting period (defined in Section 9.1 
above) must be collected, however only the highest grade of the AE will be recorded in the CRF 
if there is a change in grade.  Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent 
should be recorded in the Medical History CRF.  Any condition listed in a subjects’ Medical 
History for which the severity of the grade increases at the time of, or post CART19 infusion, 
should be captured as an adverse event.  
 
Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a 
diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underlying signs and symptoms. When a clear 
diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate Adverse 
Event. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until 
it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.   
 
As far as possible, each adverse event should be evaluated to determine: 
1. The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1-5)- only the highest grade of the AE will be 
recorded in the CRF if there is a change in grade 
2. Its duration (start and end dates)  
3. Its relationship to the study treatment (Is there a reasonable possibility that the AE is 
related to the study treatment: No (unrelated) or Yes).  If yes- is the event possibly, 
probably or definitely related to the investigational treatment (CART-19 T-cells) or the 
non-investigational treatment (i.e. lymphodepleting chemotherapy)?  
4. Action taken with respect to study or investigational treatment (none, dose adjusted, 
temporarily interrupted, permanently discontinued, unknown, not applicable) 
5. Whether medication or therapy taken (i.e. no concomitant medication/non -drug therapy, 
concomitant medication/non-drug therapy) 
6. Whether it is serious as defined as in Section 9.1. 
 
All adverse events should be treated appropriately. If a concomitant medication or non-drug 
therapy is given, this action should be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.  Once an adverse event 
is detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and 
assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of any changes in 
severity, the suspected relationship to the study treatment, the interventions required to treat it, and 
the outcome.  Progression of malignancy (including fatal outcomes), documented appropriately in 
the medical records, should not be reported as a serious adverse event.  
 
Adverse events that occur concurrently with the progression of malignancy but that are not related 
to disease progression (i.e. deep vein thrombosis or hemoptysis) will be reported as an adverse 
event as described above.   
 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the adverse event reporting period must 
be followed to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse event that occurs after the 
adverse event reporting period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or 
study participation, should be recorded and reported immediately.

Modification of CTC Grading scale for Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) 
The current CTCAE grading system developed to capture cytokine release syndrome (CRS) relates 
to acute infusional toxicity, within [ADDRESS_1261841]-infusion. A proposed CTC grading system specifically to capture toxicity for protocols using 
CART -19 cell is described below ( Table 9 -1) and should be used to evaluate CRS events.  
 
Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_899957]-[ADDRESS_1261842] also been observed to correlate with the clinical 
CRS syndrome. 
 
Symptoms usually occur 1-14 days after cell infusion, but the syndrome is not defined by [CONTACT_900000]. Patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_899958] a CRS. Symptoms may include.  
 High fevers 
 Rigors 
 Sweating 
 Nausea 
 Vomiting  
 Anorexia 
 Fatigue 
 Headache 
 Myalgia/arthralgia  
 Hypotension 
 Dyspnea  
 Tachypnea 
 Hypoxia 
 Altered mental status 
 End organ dysfunction 
 Signs of macrophage activation syndrome including hemophagocytosis and 
hemolysis 
For the purposes of reporting and grading on clinical trials using CART-19 cells, the following 
grading system is proposed. The start date of CRS is a retrospective assessment of the date of 
onset of persistent fevers and/or myalgia consistent with CRS and not explained by [CONTACT_834466] (i.e. sepsis). The stop date of CRS is defined as the date when the patient has been 
afebrile for 24 hours and off vasopressors for 24 hours.

IRB requires expedited reporting of those events related to study participation that are unforeseen 
and indicate that participants or others are at increased risk of harm.  The IRB will not acknowledge 
safety reports or bulk adverse event submissions that do not meet the criteria outlined below.  The 
IRB requires researchers to submit reports of the following problems within 10 working days from 
the time the investigator becomes aware of the event:

Reporting Deaths:  more rapid reporting requirements 
Concerning deaths that occur during the course of a research study, the following describes the 
more rapid reporting requirement of the Penn IRB for specific situations: 
 Report the event within 72  hours when the death is unforeseen (unexpected) and 
indicates participants or others are at increased risk of harm 
 
For reportable deaths, the initial submission to the IRB may be made by [CONTACT_350368]. The AE/Unanticipated Problem Form is required as a follow up to 
the initial submission. 
 
Other Reportable events: 
For clinical drug trials, the following events are also reportable to the IRB: 
 Any adverse experience that, even without detailed analysis, represents a serious 
unexpected adverse event that is rare in the absence of drug exposure (such as 
agranulocytosis, hepatic necrosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome) 
 Any adverse event that would cause the sponsor to modify the investigators brochure, 
protocol or info rmed consent form, or would prompt other action by [CONTACT_85400] 
 Information that indicates a change to the risks or potential benefits of the research, in 
terms of severity or frequency. For example:  
– An interim analysis indicates that participants have a lower rate of response to 
treatment than initially expected  
– Safety monitoring indicates that a particular side effect is more severe, or more 
frequent than initially expected 
– A paper is published from another study that shows that an arm of your research 
study is of no therapeutic value 
 Change in FDA safety labeling or withdrawal from marketing of a drug, device, or 
biologic used in a research protocol 
 Breach of confidentiality 
 Change to the protocol taken without prior IRB review to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard to a research participant 
 Incarceration of a participant when the research was not previously approved under 
Subpart C and the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject to remain 
on the study

9.3.3 Reporting obligations to the DSMC of the Abramson Cancer Center 
The Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) has developed a detailed data safety and monitoring 
program.  The Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee (CTSRMC) serves as 
a rigorous scientific peer review mechanism for all cancer protocols conducted within the 
University of Pennsylvania.  The CTSRMC’s focus is the scientific merit, priorities, and progress 
of Cancer Center clinical research. The Data Safety and Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is 
responsible for the overall quality control and quality assurance of all cancer related studies 
conducted within the University, including data quality and subject safety monitoring and auditing. 
The guidelines governing both committees have been adapted from the NCI/NIH policies.  
 
All events that meet the DSMC definition of reportable AE’s must be promptly entered into Velos.   
 
The DSMC requires AE/SAE submission as follows:  
 
On-Site subjects  (this includes any subjects enrolled at other sites on an in-house study) 
 
 All grade 3 or higher events within 5 business days of knowledge of the adverse event .  
Grade 3 and 4 events that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_834425], with the exception of 
those that could be symptoms/early indicators of any of the toxicities defined in the 
Toxicity Management section of the protocol, signs/symptoms of an allergic response,

discontinue the development of the intervention to be used in this study. 
 
The study will be paused if:  
 The protocol will be paused pending submission of the protocol pause to the FDA and 
review by [CONTACT_1201], ACC DSMC, ACC CTSRMC, Medical Monitor and the DSMB if 
any patient experiences any of the following events within two weeks of the first CART-
19 infusion   
 Life-threatening (grade 4) toxicity attributable to protocol therapy that is 
unmanageable, unexpected and unrelated to chemotherapy and attributable to 
protocol therapy. High fevers, hypotension, possible ICU admission and  even 
mechanical ventilation are expected. These side effects can result in grade 4 liver 
toxicity, nephrotoxicity, and other organ involvement 
 Death 
If the study is paused for the reasons above, the PI, members of the study team and Protocol 
Advisor will meet in person or by [CONTACT_900002] [ADDRESS_1261850] a thorough 
discussion of the event. These types of events will not be vetted via e-mail. The sponsor should 
not be involved in discussions about attribution. Meeting minutes capturing the review of any 
ongoing investigations, including next steps in the management of subjects and any proposed 
changes to the protocol will be forwarded to the FDA, IRB, ACC DSMC, Medical Monitor, and 
DSMB. If all parties are in agreement as to the event resolution, then the pause will be lifted. 
 
The protocol manufacturing will be paused to review the manufacturing process should there be 
>20% manufacturing failures [i.e. the manufacturing process fails to meet the protocol-specified 
dose range according to the protocol stage and randomized dose arm (as applicable)] . 
If the study is paused for manufacturing reasons, the PI, members of the study team, Protocol 
Advisor, Clinical Operations and Cell Manufacturing will meet to identify manufacturing failure. 
The team will make recommendations for process improvements to be implemented. Pending 
successful completion of a process validation run, the manufacturing pause will be lifted.  
9.5.2 Toxicity management considerations 
Replication-competent lentivirus (RCL) may be generated during the CART-[ADDRESS_1261851](s), and therefore, monitoring for RCL will be conducted during the course of the trial. 
 
Regulatory agencies and the gene therapy community have previously discussed measures to be 
taken should an RCL be confirmed in a subject. However, because the probability of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007], 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1261852] 
becomes clear. Some considerations are  
 Intensive follow-up of subject in consultation with gene therapy experts, study 
investigators, FDA and NIH.  
 Inform local public health officials and CDC. 
 Identify sexual partners and provide appropriate counseling and intervention. 
 
RCL will be monitored by a suitable Q-PCR assay for the detection of the lentivirus (VSV-
g DNA) . If a positi ve VSV-g DNA a ssay result is obtain ed, the Investigator will be informed 
and the patient rescheduled for a rete st for the DNA test.  If the s econd DNA test is positive, then 
infusions will be tempo rarily halted.  The  patient will und ergo a blood d raw for isolation  of HIV 
from his/h er cells.   The virus will be sequence d and  compa red to se quences of the transfer 
vector and p ackaging construct s, as we ll as to available HIV sequ ences to determine the o rigin 
of the virus.  De termin ation  of the orig in of the virus can be easily perfo rmed by [CONTACT_900003] a ccesso ry genes such  as vif, vpr and  vpu which  are not present in  the p ackaging construct s. 
If the sequ ence is derived  from wt-HIV then infusions for a ll patients can resume, and the p atient 
will be refer red to treatment fo r HIV.  If an  RCL is confirmed,  or the virus can not be isolated 
from the blood  draw, the patient will be scheduled  for aph eresis and  will undergo  a full 
biolo gical RCR/L testi ng for d etection  and/or ch aracterizati on of the RCRL. 
 
Clonality and insertional oncogenesis.  Four of nine treated patients in a gene therapy trial for 
X-linked Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID) developed T cell leukemia 31-[ADDRESS_1261853]-treatment. The T cell leukemias were attributable to clonal expansion conferred by 
[CONTACT_900004]34+ bone marrow stem cell modification94. This 
represents the most severe adverse event caused by [CONTACT_708895]. However, there is also 
evidence for retroviral vector integration site dominance in a gene therapy trial of -thalassaemia 
without malignancy95. The lentiviral vector used for CART-[ADDRESS_1261854] developed a new 
malignancy, T cell or otherwise, related to lentiviral vector integration. Subjects will be monitored 
for evidence of unexpected CART-19 expansion by [CONTACT_288479]-19 transgene quantitation by [CONTACT_900005] ( CBC) as part of the study design. 
If an unexpected pattern of CART-19  expansion is observed (i.e. CART-19 expansion in the 
absence of CD19+ target), subjects will be closely monitored clinically for new malignancies, 
particularly T cell, and further studies, including insertion site analysis, will be considered to 
investigate the molecular basis of the expansion. Investigators should consult with the Regulatory 
Sponsor if an unexpected pattern of CART-19 expansion and/or a new malignancy arises. Subjects 
will continue to be similarly monitored for clonality and insertional oncogenesis when enrolled on 
the long term follow-up protocol.

infused cells.  
 
Toxicity associated with allogeneic or autologous T cell infusions has been managed with a course 
of pharmacologic immunosuppression. CAR T cel l associated toxicity has been reported to 
respond to systemic corticosteroids43.  If uncontrolled T cell proliferation occurs (grade 3 or 4 
toxicity related to CART-19 cells), subjects will be treated with corticosteroids. Subjects will be 
treated with pulse methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg i.v. divided q8 hr x 2 days), followed by a rapid 
taper.  
 
B cell depletion.  It is possible that B cell depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia will occur. This 
is common with anti-CD20 directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]97. In the event of clinically significant 
hypogammaglobulinemia (i.e. systemic infections), subjects will be given intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIG) by [CONTACT_900006], as has been done with Rituximab. 
 
Infusion reaction. Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine hydrochloride may be repeated every [ADDRESS_1261856] can be retested for sterility using archived sa mples that are stor ed in the CVP F.  
Consideration of a cytokine release syndrome (see below) should be given.   
 
Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) / Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)  
CRS has been observed in patients after treatment with CART-19. Patients with clinical responses 
exhibited some level of CRS that ranged from mild to severe consisting of fevers, hypotension, 
capi[INVESTIGATOR_7946], hypoxia or other symptoms (See Section 1.5.2 and 8.2).  All patients who have 
responded to CART-[ADDRESS_1261857] experienced a CRS.  
 
Cytokine production is required for the activation, expansion and cytolytic function of T cells and 
for CART-19 T cells.  Therefore some degree of CRS may be a desired clinical outcome. 
Premature or early intervention with anti-cytokine therapy may therefore abrogate the anti-tumor 
efficacy of CART-19. Subsequent to this experience, selective tocilizumab (an anti-IL6 -receptor 
antibody), therapy has been utilized (described below) with effective toxicity management and 
successful ongoing CART-[ADDRESS_1261858] managed with administration 
of tocilizumab. 
  
Tocilizumab should be used as a single, weight-based dose of 8  mg/kg at the time of hemodynamic 
instability. This management approach is designed to avoid life-threatening toxicities, while 
attempting to allow the CART-19 cells to establish a proliferative phase that appears to correlate 
with anti-tumor efficacy. Thus, the timing of the tocilizumab should be individualized, in close 
consultation with the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or expert consultants for the trial.  Steroids have 
not always been effective in this setting and may not be necessary given the rapid response to 
tocilizumab. Because steroids will interfere with CART-19 function and efficacy, if used, they 
should be rapi[INVESTIGATOR_333379].  
 
Upon developi[INVESTIGATOR_379185]-persistent fevers following CART-19 infusion, patients 
should then be followed closely. Infection and tumor lysis syndrome work up should be 
immediately undertaken.  The pharmacy should be notified of the potential need for tocilizumab.  
Patient management in an intensive care unit may be required and the timing is dependent upon 
local institutional practice. In addition to supportive care, tocilizumab may be administered in 
cases of moderate to severe CRS, especially if the patient exhibits any of the following: 
 Hemodynamic instability despi[INVESTIGATOR_834426] 
 Worsening respi[INVESTIGATOR_1506], including pulmonary infiltrates, increasing oxygen 
requirement including high-flow O2, and/or need for mechanical ventilation.  
 Any other signs or symptoms of rapid deterioration despi[INVESTIGATOR_834427] 8 mg/kg i.v. single dose. Not all Grade [ADDRESS_1261859] been immediately treated with tocilizumab and decisions are, 
in part, based upon the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_899962]. 
 
Other anti-cytokine therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as repeat administration of tocilizumab or use of siltuximab or 
etanercept, may also be considered if the patient does not respond to the initial dose of tocilizumab.  
If the patient experiences ongoing CRS despi[INVESTIGATOR_560509]-cytokine directed therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], 
anti T -cell therapi[INVESTIGATOR_614151], ATG, campath may be considered.   
 
CRS has been associated with biochemical and physiologic abnormalities consistent with MAS.  
Moderate to extreme elevations in serum C -reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin have been seen with 
CART -19 associated CRS, however the magnitude and kinetics vary greatly between individual 
patients.  CRS management decisions should be based upon clinical signs and symptoms and 
response to interventions, not these laboratory values per se .

GVHD: The chance of GVHD occurring is low, but it is a potential risk with CTL019 therapy. A 
prior study of activated donor lymphocyte infusions (ex vivo activated cells collected from the

show high rates of GVHD (2/18 patients with grade 3 GVHD and none with grade 4).  Eight ALL

9.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations 
 
 
 
Exception  
A one time, intentional  action or process that departs from the IRB and CTSRMC approved study 
protocol, intended for one  occurrence. If the action disrupts the study progress, such that the study 
design or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety and 
welfare of study subjects, advance documented IRB and DSMC approval is required.    
 
No exception would be granted i f the action disrupts the study progress, such that the study design 
or outcome (endpoints) may be compromised, or the action compromises the safety and welfare 
of study subjects, advance documented IRB and DSMC approval is required.  
 
Exceptions will be approved by [CONTACT_900007].  Documentation of approval by [CONTACT_900008].  All 
exceptions require advance documented IRB and ACC DSMC approval. 
 
No exceptions to eligibility of any type will be granted for this study. 
 
Deviation

compromises the safety and welfare of the subjects, the deviation must be reported to the ACC 
DSMC within 5 business days and the IRB within 10 business days.  
 
Any departure from the protocol that meets the following criteria should be submitted to the 
regulatory sponsor, ACC DSMC and IRB: 
 Impacts subject safety 
 Impacts the integrity of the study design or outcome 
 Based on the PI’s judgment is reportable 
Deviations identified retrospectively pertaining to manufacturing, treatment, eligibility  or safety 
reporting will result in suspension of enrollment until the DSMC is satisfied with the corrective 
action plan. 
 
Other deviations should be explained in a memo to file (such as a subject missing a visit is not an 
issue unless a critical/important treatment or procedure was missed and must have been done at 
that specific time).  
 
Include the following information on the Sponsor supplied exception/deviation form:  protocol 
number, subject study number, description of the exception/deviation and rationale.  Ensure all 
completed exception/deviation forms are signed by [CONTACT_079] (or a sub-
investigator) and submitted to the Sponsor Project Manager and Medical Monitor for review.

The Sponsor Project Manager wi ll submit the exception and/or deviation  request to the Regulatory 
Sponsor fo r review and  appro val.  Once approval of the exception request or acknowledgement of 
the deviation has been granted by [CONTACT_900009], the exception or 
deviation will be submitted to the IRB, ACC DSMC and all other applicable committees for review 
and approval.  
 
Protocol adherence 
Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations.  Under no 
circumstances should the investigator contact [CONTACT_900010], if any, 
monitoring the study to request a protocol exception, as no authorized exceptions are permitted.  
If the investigator feels a protocol exception would improve the conduct of the study, this must be 
considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by [CONTACT_900011]/IEC/REB it cannot be implemented.  All significant protocol deviations 
will be recorded and reported in the CSR.   

CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1261863] be approved by [CONTACT_1034], Health Authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC/REB.  Only 
amendments that are required for patient safety may be implemented prior to IRB/IEC/REB 
approval.  Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator 
is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any patient included in this 
study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol.  In such cases, the Sponsor 
should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC at the study site should be informed to the local 
regulations (e.g., [LOCATION_006] required the notification of urgent safety measures within 3 days) but no later 
than 10 working days.   
9.7 Medical Monitoring 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_16462]/her site.  
This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events 
as noted above, as well as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety-monitoring 
plan (see section 11  Auditing, Monitoring and Inspecting).  Medical monitoring will include a 
regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events. 
 
A protocol-specific independent medical monitor with appropriate expertise and experience has 
been recruited in addition to the DSMB to review subject safety data and ensure the safety of 
participants.  The Medical Monitor will receive real-time reporting of any events that could 
potentially  impact subject safety (including dose-limiting toxicities).  The Medical Monitor will 
also receive all of the following: 
 
 All Serious Adverse Events (regardless of expectedness/relatedness).  The SAE will be 
reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAE. 
 Deviations reported to the regulatory sponsor, ACC DSMC and IRB as they occur  
 Exceptions prior to submission to the IRB and ACC DSMC 
 IRB Continuing Review Reports  
 All queries issued by [CONTACT_6802] (including those related to grading, attribution and 
expectedness of adverse events). 
 
 
The Medical Monitor will correspond via email to communicate: 
 SAE acknowledgement and inquiries 
 Deviation acknowledgement, inquiries, recommendations 
 Exception acknowledgement, inquiries and approval/disapproval 
 Continuing review acknowledgement, inquiries  
 
The Medical Monitor will review and acknowledge the above, and make recommendations 
whether to continue with the study,  amend the study, and/or stop/pause the study as needed. In 
addition, the Medical Monitor and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_899963] [ADDRESS_1261864] (DSMB) will be constituted prior to the 
randomization of the first patient. Please note that the DSMB is separate from the DSMC (refer to 
section 9.3.3).  The DSMB will be comprised of a minimum of four individuals including 
physicians with experience in oncology and/or gene transfer therapy and a statistician.  The DSMB 
will 
be assembled and will work under a charter specifically developed for safety oversight of this 
study. The DSMB will be responsible for reviewing available safety data. The DSMB will provide 
advice to the investigators, and consult with regulatory sponsor as necessary. The DSMB will 
evaluate patient-subject safety as specified in the Data Safety and Monitoring Plan.  There will be 
a meeting with the DSMB describing their roles and responsibilities and discussing potential data 
format and process issues prior to the finalization of the interim analysis plan. 
 
The results of the analysi s following Stage I will also be presented to the DSMB for review and 
recommendations. The analyses will address efficacy and key safety data. 
 
If necessary, additional meetings of the DSMB may be held if safety issues arise in between 
scheduled meetings. 
 
It is envisioned that the DSMB may make four types of recommendations, namely: 
• No safety or efficacy issues, ethical to continue the study as planned 
• Serious safety concerns precluding further study treatment, regardless of efficacy 
• Overwhelming evidence for futility, recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10098]. 
• Recommendation to continue the study but proposing an amendment to the protocol 
(e.g., incorporate an additional safety assessments) 
 
If the study is recommended to continue by [CONTACT_4318], no details about the results of the current 
interim analysis will be revealed prior to the next scheduled analysis.  A Regulatory Sponsor 
representative will submit the DSMB report to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_899964] [ADDRESS_1261865] maintain source documents for each patient in the study, consisting of case and 
visit notes (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5320]) containing demographic and medical information, 
laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All 
information recorded on eCRFs must be traceable to source documents in the patient's file. The 
investigator must also keep the original signed informed consent form (a signed copy is given to 
the patient). 
 
Periodic monitoring visits throughout the study provide the Sponsor with the opportunity to 
evaluate the progress of the study and inform the Sponsor of potential problems. The clinical field 
monitors will assure that submitted data are accurate and in agreement with source documentation; 
verify that investigational products are properly stored and accounted for, verify that subjects’ 
consent for study participation has been properly obtained and documented, confirm that research 
subjects entered into the study meet inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assure that all essential 
documentation required by [CONTACT_20148] (GCP) guidelines are appropriately filed. 
 
The investigator must give the clinical field monitor access to all relevant source documents to 
confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries. The monitoring standards require full verification 
for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 
documentation of SAEs. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs 
are performed according to the study-specific monitoring plan. 
 
At the end of the study, monitors will conduct a close-out visit and will advise on storage of study 
records and disposition of unused investigational products.   Further details about clinical 
monitoring can be found in the Sponsor Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP). 
 
 
Data Collection 
A [COMPANY_003] electronic database system will be used for data collection in this study.  The designated 
investigator staff will enter the data required by [CONTACT_5374]

Registration, and Adverse Event/SAE CRF. 
 
[ADDRESS_1261867] ensure anonymity of the patients; patients must not be identified by [CONTACT_834474].  Signed informed consent forms and patient 
enrollment log must be kept strictly confidential to enable patient identification at the site.   
 
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those 
regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following: 
  
 What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
 Who will have access to that information and why  
 Who will use or disclose that information 
 The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by 
[CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject 
authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should 
be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the subject is alive) at the end 
of their scheduled study period. 
 
The data collection system for this study uses built-in security features to encrypt all data for 
transmission in both directions, preventing unauthorized access to confidential participant 
information. Access to the system will be controlled by a sequence of individually assigned user 
identification codes and passwords, made available only to unauthorized personnel who have 
completed the prerequisite training.  
 
If country rules or ethics committee standards do not permit collection of patient initials and the 
exact date of birth, generic initials will be used and only the year of birth will be collected.

This material is the property of the University of Pennsylvania.  Do not disclose or use except as authorized in writing by [CONTACT_4530].  § Lab tests specified on the infusion day will be drawn prior to infusion.  A blood draw for potassium will be drawn [ADDRESS_1261898] infusion. The 
Investigator will review all pre-infusion lab (day -1) results to determine that it is appropriate to proceed with the infusion.  Any abnormal Cr, Ca, K, 
Phos or uric acid result that is a change from the prior value should be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_899966].  Any new lab abnormalities that are 
also a change from the prior value will be reviewed by [CONTACT_431]. Additional Research Sample Collection: In the event something unexpected 
occurs the protocol, the research team may request an additional sample collection be performed to collect additional blood or marrow/LN samples 
for research analysis. This is being done with the intention of evaluating the likely effects from the investigational products received. The total 
amount of extra blood that will be collected will be [ADDRESS_1261899], ALT, Mg, Phos, LDH, Ferritin, CRP and Uric Acid.  A separate sample for serum K+ is taken approximately [ADDRESS_1261900] be reported from the time the patient’s informed consent has been obtained to end of the study. 
d. CT scans should be performed within [ADDRESS_1261901] (quantitative) for female only. 
h. Blood for CD3, CD4, CD8 Lymphocytes  taken at mo nths 3 and 6 only. 
i. Autoimmune screen (ANA, ESR)  
j. Viral Serology includes CMV, EBV, and Hepatitis B and C 
k. Serum immunoglobulins will be collected at months 3, 6, 9 and 12 and as clinically indicated. 
l. Chemotherapy as appropriate for disease type. See section 6.5 
m. 12-15 liter apheresis to go to CVPF. 1 x 108 cells to be delivered to TCSL. 
n. 100 mL peripheral blood draw (Lavender EDTA 10mL tubes) to be delivered to TCSL.  
o. TCSL has requested labs samples for research be sent to TCSL as soon as collected. If required to keep research labs after hours, please 
keep red tops upright,   lavender tubes should be room temperature on rotating platforms.  In the event that something unexpected occurs, 
additional research sample collection may be done as necessary. Blood collects are not to exceed 3 tablespoons of blood twice in one 
week  time window. Marrow/LN collections would not exceed more than one procedure per month.  This would be at PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. 
p. Two 10 ml green tops to CVPF

§ Lab tests specified on the infusion day will be drawn prior to infusion.  A blood draw for potassium will be drawn [ADDRESS_1261914] infusion. The 
Investigator will review all pre-infusion lab (day -1) results to determine that it is appropriate to proceed with the infusion.  Any abnormal Cr, Ca, K, 
Phos or uric acid result that is a change from the prior value should be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_899966].  Any new lab abnormalities that are 
also a change from the prior value will be reviewed by [CONTACT_431]. Additional Research Sample Collection: In the event something unexpected occurs 
the protocol, the research team may request an additional sample collection be performed to collect additional blood or marrow/LN samples for research 
analysis. This is being done with the intention of evaluating the likely effects from the investigational products received. The total amount of extra 
blood that will be collected will be [ADDRESS_1261915], ALT, Mg, Phos, LDH, Ferritin, CRP and Uric Acid.  A separate sample for serum K+ is taken approximately [ADDRESS_1261916] (quantitative) for female only. 
h. Blood for CD3, CD4, CD8 Lymphocytes  taken at mo nths 3 and 6 only. 
i. Autoimmune screen (ANA, ESR)  
j. Viral Serology includes CMV, EBV, and Hepatitis B and C 
k. Serum immunoglobulins will be collected at months 3, 6, [ADDRESS_1261917] additional cells to manufacturer a sufficient dose for retreatment,  and CART19 T cells will be administered via split dosing based 
on the Retreatment Cohort Schedule of Events for Split Dosing Administration below.   
n.  100mL peripheral blood draw (lavender EDTA 10mL tubes) to be delivered to the TCSL. 
o. TCSL has requested labs samples for research be sent to TCSL as soon as collected. If required to keep research labs after hours, please 
keep red tops upright,   lavender tubes should be room temperature on rotating platforms.  In the event that something unexpected occurs, 
additional research sample collection may be done as necessary. Blood collects are not to exceed 3 tablespoons of blood twice in one 
week time window. Marrow/LN collections would not exceed more than one procedure per month.  This would be at PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
p. The research blood collection is split on infusion day:  20 mL EDTA (lavender) and 2 mL serum (red) are collected pre-infusion for 
cytokines, qPCR and cellular assessments; 5 mL EDTA (lavender) and 2 mL serum (red) are collected 20-120min post-infusion for 
cytokines and qPCR only (cellular assessments only done pre-infusion).  
q. Required on Day [ADDRESS_1261918] infusion assessments will be performed monthly from month 2 to month 6. 
s. After year 1, patients will be enrolled into a destination protocol (IRB# /UPCC ) for follow-up by [CONTACT_900015] 
[ADDRESS_1261919]-infusion.  5 ml in lavender top (DNA) and 2 ml in red top 
(serum) to be delivered to TCSL. 
u. At months 3 and 6 only. 
v. CART19 , tumor, and B cells enumerated by [CONTACT_900016]-gating using CD3+/CAR19+, CD5,CD19/kappa or lambda 
and CD19+ expression respectively. 
w. All patients must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] ( RVP ) to test for influenza within 10 days prior to the planned CART-19 infusion.

§ Lab tests specified on the infusion day will be drawn prior to infusion.  A blood draw for potassium will be drawn [ADDRESS_1261933] infusion. The 
Investigator will review all pre-infusion lab (day -1) results to determine that it is appropriate to proceed with the infusion.  Any abnormal Cr, Ca, K, 
Phos or uric acid result that is a change from the prior value should be reviewed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_899966].  Any new lab abnormalities that are 
also a change from the prior value will be reviewed by [CONTACT_431]. Additional Research Sa mple Collection: In the event something unexpected occurs 
CD19 CART-[ADDRESS_1261934] additional blood or marrow/LN samples for research 
analysis. This is being done with the intention of evaluating the likely effects from the investigational products received. The total amount of extra 
blood that will be collected will be [ADDRESS_1261935], ALT, Mg, Phos, LDH, Ferritin, CRP and Uric Acid.  A separate sample for serum K+ is taken approximately [ADDRESS_1261936] (quantitative) for female only. 
h. Blood for CD3, CD4, CD8 Lymphocytes  taken at mo nths 3 and 6 only. 
i. Autoimmune screen (ANA, ESR)  
j. Viral Serology includes CMV, EBV, and Hepatitis B and C 
k. Serum immunoglobulins will be collected at months 3, 6, [ADDRESS_1261937] additional cells to manufacturer a sufficient dose for retreatment.  If apheresis is required: 12-15 liter apheresis to go to CVPF. 1 x 
108 cells to be delivered to TCSL. 
n. 100 mL peripheral blood draw (Lavender EDTA 10mL tubes) to be delivered to the TC SL.   
o. TCSL has requested labs samples for research be sent to TCSL as soon as collected. If required to keep research labs after hours, please 
keep red tops upright,   lavender tubes should be room temperature on rotating platforms.  In the event that something unexpected occurs, 
additional research sample collection may be done as necessary. Blood collects are not to exceed 3 tablespoons of blood twice in one 
week time window. Marrow/LN collections would not exceed more than one procedure per month.  This would be at PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106].  
p. The research blood collection is split on infusion day:  20 mL EDTA (lavender) and 2 mL serum (red) are collected pre-infusion for 
cytokines, qPCR and cellular assessments; 5 mL EDTA (lavender) and 2 mL serum (red) are collected 20-120min post-infusion for 
cytokines and qPCR only (cellular assessments only done pre-infusion).  
q. Required on Day [ADDRESS_1261938] infusion assessments will be performed monthly from month 2 to month 6. 
s. After year 1, patients will be enrolled into a destination protocol (IRB# /UPCC ) for follow-up by [CONTACT_900015] 
[ADDRESS_1261939]-infusion.  5 ml in lavender top (DNA) and 2 ml in red top 
(serum) to be delivered to TCSL. 
u. At months 3 and 6 only. 
v. CART19 , tumor, and B cells enumerated by [CONTACT_900016]-gating using CD3+/CAR19+, CD5,CD19/kappa or lambda 
and CD19+ expression respectively. 
w. All patients must undergo a Respi[INVESTIGATOR_4450] ( RVP ) to test for influenza within [ADDRESS_1261940] planned CART-19 
infusion.  The Respi[INVESTIGATOR_834436]: Influenza A, Influenza B, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_14250] A, Respi[INVESTIGATOR_14250] B, 
Parainfluenza Virus Type 1, Parainfluenza Virus Type 2, Parainfluenza Virus Type 3, Adenovirus.  If the patient is positive for influenza, 
oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu®) or equivalent should be administered for 10 days as preventative treatment (see Tamiflu® package 
insert for dosing information). The patient must complete this course of preventative treatment prior to receiving the first CART- [ADDRESS_1261941]’s relapse and survival status every [ADDRESS_1261942] CART-19 infusion until the end of the study (Last Patient/Last Visit).  
Once subjects’ relapse or they begin a new cancer therapy, additional follow-up for relapse will not be required, and subjects will be 
followed for survival only. 
y. Secondary follow-up will take place in Stage 2 only.

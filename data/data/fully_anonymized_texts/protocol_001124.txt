Version #:   3.3 Version Date:  [ADDRESS_854204] 2019 Page 2 of 17
HRP-593 /  v011017OBJECTIVES AND  HYPOTHESIS:
The overall  aim of the present study is to prospectively investigate the impact of two 
maintenance CNI immunosuppressive regimens (both prednisone-free, with MMF) on 
subpopulations of T and B cells and alloreactive T cells as well as on renal allograft function at 
week 2, [ADDRESS_854205]-transplantation.
1.To  compare renal toxicity of once-daily LCP-Tacro/Envarsus XR vs. twice/day Tacrolimus by 
[CONTACT_638672].
2.To  compare the effect on T and B cell subpopulations of once-daily LCP-Tacro/Envarsus XR 
vs. twice /day Tacrolimus.  Specific studies to include prospective, serial flow cytometric 
analysis of T and B cell subpopulations, as well as high throughput sequencing T cell 
receptor repertoire analysis monitoring for presence or absence of donor-reactive T cells.
Our hypothesis  is that that more consistent exposure with LCP-Tacro/Envarsus® XR avoiding 
under immunosuppression will prevent the emergence of alloreactive T cells, development of 
effector memory T cells, and a reduced incidence of immunologic allograft injury. We also posit 
that avoidance of the peaks associated with conventional twice daily tacrolimus will spare the 
renal allograft from drug induced nephrotoxicity. 
BACKGROUND:
Kidney transplantation  is the treatment of choice for most patients with end-stage renal disease. 
Lifelong immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_638653]. However, long 
term exposure to immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation can place patients at 
risk for multiple adverse events. The optimal immunosuppressive therapy is not well 
established. Tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) is highly effective in preventing acute 
rejection after organ transplantation (2). It is used as part of the immunosuppression regimen for 
the majority of kidney and liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (3). However, treatment with current 
formulation of Tacrolimus generates high peaks and low troughs in drug concentrations in the 
blood. It is known that high exposure to CNI is associated with renal toxicities and adverse 
events (4).  New once-daily dosage formulations are now developed with the hope of minimizing 
side effects while maintaining excellent outcomes (5-8). 
LCP-Tacro/Envarsus® XR,  a new once-daily formulation of tacrolimus, was approved by [CONTACT_78121]  1 Mean  whole-blood tacrolimus concentration in patients  on days  7, 14 & 21 vs time

prolonged-release tacrolimus formulation, utilizing a MeltDose drug delivery technology 
designed to improve the bioavailability of drugs with low water solubility (1). Recent clinical data 
demonstrated that once-daily LCP-Tacro/Envarsus XR has improved pharmacokinetic 
bioavailability, rapid achievement of therapeutic trough levels, less fluctuation and swing in 
whole blood concentration, non-inferior efficacy and similar safety,  with lower tacrolimus dose 
than other tacrolimus formulations (1, 9-13). (Figure1).

Blood Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007] . 
The approach  will be to conduct a multi-parameter flow cytometric immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_638659] [ADDRESS_854222]-transplant to analyze cellular 
changes. 
Methods (14-16):  Our well-established 5-color flow cytometric analyses is performed 
using whole  blood to delineate the cellular makeup in terms of both percentages and 
absolute numbers (Table 1). RBCs are lysed before flow acquisition. The analysis is 
for defining the T cell subsets, monocytes and natural killer cells (Tube 2), the B cells 
including naïve,  transitional, memory and effector-memory subsets (Tube 3) and the 
dendritic cells including immature, monocytoid and plasmacytoid fractions (Tube 4). 
In addition  to the whole blood analyses, PBMC are isolated from heparinized 40 cc 
blood samples by [CONTACT_138789]-Hypaque gradients. Surface markers are identified with 
indicated monoclonal antibodies, and after fixation and permeabilization the 
intracellular protein ligands are detected with antibodies shown on the bottom row 
(Table 2). This panel delineates expression of markers for activated, effector, 
memory, anergic and exhausted cell fractions as well as myriad sub-sets of 
regulatory T and B cells. 
Donor-reactive TCR repertoire  analysis The approach will be to identify and estimate 
the total T cell clonal repertoire that a patient is capable of mounting against the donor 
by [CONTACT_638676] (17) 
prior to transplant. Then after transplant, monitor for the absence, presence or 
amplification of the pre-identified T cell clones in the post-transplant biopsies, blood 
and/or urine samples. This is a novel innovative technology that we have developed for 
profiling recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]’s immune status against the donor to correlate with the status of the 
graft. The methodological approach is follows:Table 1:  Whole blood immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_638660] 1 Tube 2 Tube 3 Tube 4

HRP-593 /  v011017Selection of  donor-reactive T cells: Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_24428]-transplant peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be labeled with CFSE dye and then stimulated with 
PKH266-labled donor irradiated PBMC in MLR. After [ADDRESS_854224] diluted the CFSE are flow-sorted (at NU Flow Core) as shown in Figure 3 
(top middle). Based on previous results, it is expected that the proliferating cells will be 
>90% CD3+ T cells, distributed into CD4+ or CD8+ cells, with minimal contamination with 
CD19+ B cells or CD14+ monocytes but some CD56+ NK cells. Both the CD3+CD4+ and 
CD3+CD8+ cell subsets are sorted out separately and is shipped to Adaptive 
Biotechnologies in Seattle.
ImmunoSEQ analysis of donor-reactive  T cells:  At Adaptive Biotechnologies total 
genomic DNA is purified from the flow-sorted CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ cell subsets 
from each culture using Qiagen DNeasy Blood extraction Kit following the 
manufacturer’s protocol. Then, a multiplex PCR assay that is capable of specifically 
amplifying rearranged 
TCRB genes from a 
complex background 
followed by [CONTACT_638677] (Figure 4). 
The data is analyzed 
measuring clonality, 
proportion and 
diversity of the T cell 
repertoire (18-20). 
These represent the 
total T cell repertoire

HRP-593 /  v011017Enumeration of donor  reactive T cell clones in post-transplant kidney biopsies, 
blood and urine: 
The transplant  biopsy represents a sampling of the allograft and rejection is manifested 
as cellular infiltration, mostly of donor reactive T cells and B cells, classically detected 
through immunohistopathological staining and microscopic examination. An alternate 
approach that we have developed is to monitor the graft for infiltrating donor-reactive 
clonotype identified through AlloSEQ (17). This would entail isolation of total genomic 
DNA from the biopsies, performance of immunoSEQ analysis as above and monitoring 
for the presence and copy number of donor-reactive clones identified through the pre-
transplant AlloSEQ, and then correlating with the severity of rejection monitored through 
immunohistopathological examinations. 
We had  proposed that transplant rejection can more easily be diagnosed through the 
sampling of the urine pellet or peripheral blood for clonal frequency and abundance of 
donor-reactive T cells pre-identified through AlloSEQ. This is to monitor rejection in a 
non-invasive manner.
We have  already established the technology (17) and other investigators have used it to 
show that donor reactive clones are reduced or deleted in tolerant kidney transplants 
(21). Therefore, these proposed studies monitoring post-transplant graft rejection or its 
absence can be greatly leveraged to innovatively assess the relative efficacies of the 
drugs being compared. 
Analysis of  HLA and Donor-Specific B cells 
Measurement of  B cells in the peripheral blood with potential to make HLA antibodies 
against graft donor antigens might provide a way of analyzing antibody formation and 
shed light on the balance between production, inhibition and sequestration at any given 
time in the post-transplant period. Perry and coworkers have recently reported HLA 
antibody production in vitro by B cells from the bone marrow of sensitized kidney 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. T and B-cell ELISPOT have also been used to measure HLA 
specific B cell frequency against a given antigen. ELISPOT assay does not measure the 
frequency of cells that actually bind the antigen and only measures biological events 
such as cytokine release or production of immunoglobulin after differentiation in vitro. 
Furthermore, the estimated frequency is restricted to the cells that are able to be 
selectively stimulated by [CONTACT_638679]-out and thus may lead to an 
underestimation of the actual frequency of committed cells. Another approach based on 
the structural similarity between B cell receptor and immunoglobulin binding sites, it is 
postulated that HLA-specific B cells (HSB) should bind to HLA molecules with specificity 
comparable to that of the secreted immunoglobulin. Identification of HLA specific B cells 
by [CONTACT_638680] B cell receptor using fluorescently labeled tetramers of 
identified HLA class I specificities has been described. A solid-phase assay utilizing

main multiplex assay used for the detection of allo-specific antibodies against donor 
antigens. Its multiplexing power enables the analysis of the antibodies directed to all 
available synthetic HLA class I and class II alleles in one assay. Utilizing these single 
antigen HLA beads (SAB) Degauque et al. described a novel assay to identify HLA-
specific B cells in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (22). We have further developed this novel 
multiplex bead-based assay to identify HSB (schematically described in Figures 5 and 
6), and propose here to study the circulating HSB in kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_638663].

including regulatory T cells and B cell subpopulations as well as immune functions at [ADDRESS_854230] kidney transplant. 
The secondary  endpoints of the study include 1) incidence of acute rejection, graft loss, and 
death at [ADDRESS_854231] kidney transplant; 2) allograft immunohistopathology profiles 
at [ADDRESS_854232] kidney transplant.
We will  run univariate and bivariate analyses for all variables prior to our main analyses. We 
will evaluate continuous variables using t-tests or F-tests and categorical variables using 2. 
We will examine data distributions and test all variables for linear relationships or non-linear 
relationships.
Descriptive statistics  (means, standard deviation, frequency) and correlations (both Pearson 
and Spearman) among variables will be calculated for preliminary data assessment.
Necessary transformation  and imputations will be carried out based on the raw data 
distribution.
As missing  data are inevitable in a longitudinal study, we will determine whether missing 
data are MCAR (data are missing completely at random), MAR (data are missing at 
random), or NMAR (not missing at random). If missing data are MCAR or MAR, it is likely 
that the standard multivariate computations using PROC MI (multiple imputations) will not 
result in biased standard error estimates. However, if missing data are NMAR, we will use 
the "pattern mixture" approach to compute a weighted average of the parameters that are 
associated with the missing data to estimate what the data would have been.
For the  primary objective, we hypothesize that subjects receiving LCP-Tacro/Envarsus® XR 
will exhibit significantly greater graft function and lower frequency / abundance of AlloSeq 
pre-identified donor-reactive T cell clones in the graft, peripheral blood and /or urine at [ADDRESS_854233] of care tacrolimus group. A variety of 
covariance structures (first order regressive, compound symmetry, Toeplitz, variance 
components, unstructured) will be carefully examined and compared using the best fitting 
statistics, such as Akaike’s Information (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). These 
statistics are likelihood functions and can be compared across models. If, in spi[INVESTIGATOR_638667], distributions of subjects’ baseline characteristics are found to be different 
between the two experimental groups, these variables will be entered as covariates in the 
statistical analysis.
For the  secondary endpoints, we will use logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox 
proportional hazards models to analyze time-to-event outcomes (acute rejection, graft 
failure, and death). For allograft immunohistopathology outcomes, we will first develop a 
comprehensive immune profile of each participant by [CONTACT_638683] T 
and B cell subsets and function. We will examine how these correlate with 
immunohistopathology and alloantibody production using Pearson or Spearman 
correlations. We will compare correlation coefficients between the two experimental groups 
using Z -tests to determine the distinct effects of each treatment arm. We will also compare 
the trajectory changes in cell populations and antibody production over [ADDRESS_854234] models. All tests will be

analyses will be performed using SAS 9.2 statistical software (SAS Inc., Cary, NC).
Sample size and  power:  
This proposal  bases its sample size calculations on published data demonstrating increased 
peaks and troughs with conventional tacrolimus and absence of such peaks and troughs 
with LCP-Tacro/Envarsus® XR (1) and correlation with high doses and nephrotoxicity with 
conventional tacrolimus (4). Using a two-tailed α of 0.05, the anticipated effect sizes 
corresponding to each specific aim between the two treatment arms were calculated using a 
minimum of 80% statistical power and assumed 10% attrition at 12 months.
For the  sample size of n= [ADDRESS_854236] size of 1.0 and 2.0 for graft function and immune activation (in 
terms of T cell clonal repertoire change), respectively, between the two treatment arms. 
Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we do not consider the statistical power of secondary 
outcomes; It is anticipated that a much larger sample size will be needed in order to achieve 
statistical power for the secondary endpoints in this proposed study.

PROVISIONS TO  MONITOR THE DATA TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PARTICIPANTS:
Safety:
Safety Endpoints:  The primary safety endpoints will be assessed on the AEs and SAEs that 
are observed throughout the trial. For the purpose of this clinical trial, the National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 3(CTCAE), dated June 14,

HRP-593 /  v0110172010, will  be used to grade all adverse events. The collection of AE’s and SAE’s is limited in 
this study to those Grade [ADDRESS_854238], the investigator/member of investigator’s team will seek 
information on adverse events by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. 
Information on all adverse events will be recorded in the source document. All clearly related 
signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the 
source document, though should be grouped under one diagnosis.
All adverse  events occurring during the study period that meet the criteria above will be 
recorded. The clinical course of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, 
or until it has been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause. 
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed 
up to determine the final outcome. Any serious adverse event that occurs after the study 
period and is considered to be possibly related to the study treatment or study participation 
will be recorded and reported according to IRB requirements.
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_638669]-transplant infections (i.e., UTI, CMV, HSV, EBV, HCV, HBV, HIV, 
PCP), that in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_606917]/her 
participation in this research trial, will be stopped from participating in this study (even 
though these adverse events expected to be lower in the experimental arm of the study).
Patient Authorization: This  study is to be conducted according to US and international 
standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on 
Harmonization guidelines), applicable government regulations and Institutional research 
policies and procedures.
This protocol  and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted independent 
Institutional Review Board (IRB), (Northwestern University Institutional Review Board), in 
agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study conduct. The 
decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the 
investigator and a copy of this decision will be provided to the investigator/sponsor before 
commencement of this study. The investigator will place a list of IRB members and their 
affiliate in the regulatory binder for the clinical trial. All subjects for this study will be provided 
with a printed consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for 
subjects to make an informed decision.
WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS:
Subjects may  be withdrawn from the trial at any time for any reason, either by [CONTACT_638684]. Subjects who are non-compliant with study guidelines, medications and 
clinic examinations will be withdrawn from the study. The IRB may also discontinue the study at 
any point. The subjects will be fully informed of these actions. If participants are withdrawn 
prematurely, they will still be followed through the follow-up time period of the study as per 
standard medical care. These data are important to collect to determine differences in this group 
compared to those who completed the study. 
RISKS TO PARTICIPANTS:
The risks  to the subjects are limited to the risks related to venipuncture and at least two passes 
of renal biopsies. Also, the routine risk of rejection with either of the drugs is expected; in fact, 
lower risk of nephrotoxicity is anticipated with LCP-Tacro/Envarsus® XR.

HRP-593 /  v011017The National Cancer  Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03 
(CTCAE), dated June 14, 2010 will be used to grade all adverse (either serious or non-serious) 
events. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_133605]. 
This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse 
events as noted above. Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and 
type of serious adverse events. Information on all adverse events (signs, symptoms, abnormal 
diagnostic procedures, treatments) will be recorded in the appropriate adverse event module of 
the case report form (CRF).  The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, or until it has been determined that the study participation is not the cause.  
Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be followed to 
determine the final outcome.  
Serious adverse  events that are determined to be unexpected and at least possibly related to 
study participation will be submitted to the IRB within 5 business days of the investigator’s 
knowledge of the event. Follow-up information will be submitted to the IRB as required. The 
IRB/Office for the Protection of Research Subjects at NU is under the direction of Nathalia 
Henry, MS, CIP, CHRC, (312) 503- 2578.
POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO  PARTICIPANTS:
It is  expected that participants in the experimental arm of LCP-Tacro/Envarsus® XR treatment 
will have lower nephrotoxicity, immune activation and associated improved clinical outcomes. 
These may be direct long-term benefits for participants, if they happen to be randomized into 
the study arm.
ECONOMIC BURDEN  TO PARTICIPANTS:
None other than  their own routine SOC expenses. A parking voucher will be given to the 
participants at their study visits.  
VULNERABLE POPULATIONS:
None (Please  see Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria)
SHARING OF  RESULTS WITH PARTICIPANTS:
At the end  of the study, at the PIs discretion, the participants may be informed of the incidental 
findings. This study will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov.
PRIOR APPROVALS:
All required  approvals such as laboratory, radiation safety, or biosafety are already in place. 
SETTING:
Renal transplantations will  be performed by [CONTACT_22888]-I, [CONTACT_638689] and his surgical 
colleagues at Northwestern Memorial Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. The clinical follow-up will be conducted as 
standard of care by [CONTACT_978], [CONTACT_638687] and the transplant nephrologists including [CONTACT_638690] with the help of transplant nurse coordinator (TNC). The immune monitoring 
studies will be directed by [CONTACT_15957]-I, [CONTACT_638686] with the help of Drs. Jie He and Xuemei 
Huang, two senior technologists in the Immune Monitoring Core of the CTC. Blinded (de-
identified) samples will also be sent to Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle for ImmunoSEQ 
analyses. Leftover samples, if any, are expected to be discarded at the end of the study.

HRP-593 /  v011017RESOURCES AVAILABLE:
Successful completion of the  project requires the following: a) Team of dedicated investigators: 
Drs. Gallon  and Ansari are transplant nephrologists and [CONTACT_638691] is a transplant surgeon 
and they have dedicated their careers to translational research to refine the management of 
renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. They will actively recruit all patients and, assisted by [CONTACT_638685], perform all of the clinical assessments in this cohort. They will maintain 
the clinical database with help from the assistant coordinators. They will work closely with the 
co-I, [CONTACT_638686] and his trained technologists in the Immune Monitoring Core of the 
CTC performing and interpreting the assays. [CONTACT_638692] will perform the statistical analysis 
of the immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_638670]. Yashpal Kanwar will interpret the biopsies and IHC staining. 
Northwestern has formed a collaborative partnership with Adaptive Biotechnologies, Seattle for 
ImmunoSEQ analyses to identify TcR repertoire usage in donor-specific immune responses. A 
similar partnership has been established with Myriad-RBM for the analysis of  kidney injury 
markers using their KidneyMAP panel,  b) Ideal patient population: The Northwestern CTC 
transplant center  provide the ideal infrastructure and performs a high number (>220) of living 
and deceased donor kidney transplant procedures/year to conduct this prospective trial and to 
analyze fresh patient samples. This readily supports recruiting 50 patients within one year 
enrollment period, even when considering the inclusion/exclusion criteria and other concurrent 
studies; c) Institutional support: [CONTACT_638693], division head of the CTC will provide the 
full infrastructural  support to conduct all clinical and laboratory portions of the study. In 
summary, the investigators, patient availability, and environment afford the highest chance of 
success in this proposal.

 PRECIS  
Background:
• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can involve 
almost any organ and can range in severity from mild to life-threatening. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_257303] 20 years, a small but significant portion of patients still develop progressive therapy-refractory disease that impairs organ function and overall survival.   • Since 1996, more than [ADDRESS_312611] been treated worldwide in pi[INVESTIGATOR_257304] (autoHSCT) for autoimmune diseases, including about 80 patients with SLE.   • The rationale for autoHSCT in autoimmune disease is to ablate autoreactive immune effectors and allow reconstitution of a new self-tolerant immune system from the hematopoietic stem cell. Studies have demonstrated acceptable safety and promising short-term efficacy of high-dose cyclophosphamide-based (200 mg/kg) autoHSCT for about 60% of patients with advanced refractory SLE and reacquisition of sensitivity to conventional drugs have been demonstrated in many cases. However, these trials were designed to address the primary endpoint of safety and were inadequate for assessing the disease-response.  • Numerous questions about the true efficacy of autoHSCT, optimal transplant regimen, patient selection and mechanisms of action remain unaddressed.    
Objectives:  
• The primary objective is to assess the rate of continuous relapse-free complete clinical 
responses at [ADDRESS_312612]-transplant, with statistical power of 84% to detect, if greater than 70% of patients meet the primary endpoint.    • The long-term goal of this research is to develop a basis for future transplant protocols 
that would incorporate new cellular or other immunotherapeutic interventions to further improve results of transplants with the ultimate goal to cure SLE.  
 
Eligibility:  
• Subjects age 15-[ADDRESS_312613] 4 of  the 11 criteria for SLE as defined by [CONTACT_204172]  
• Have severe and active lupus, refractory to immunosuppressive therapy.  Included are subjects with nephritis, CNS lupus, pulmonary lupus or hematologic disease   
Design:
• Fourteen patients with active and standard dose cyclophosphamide-resistant SLE will be 
enrolled on this phase II pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  • Study design is intended to improve the efficacy of autoHSCT.  A lymphoablative conditioning regimen (rituximab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) is explored for the first time in autoimmune disease.  • The treatment schedule consists of two parts; the priming regimen prior to stem cell mobilization and collection, and the conditioning regimen with transplant.  • In contrast to other studies, this study has precisely defined eligibility and disease response criteria with strict schema of tapering immunosuppression that should allow accurate 
Page 3 of 115 
 interpretation of the treatment results.  
• The study includes a carefully chosen battery of laboratory research studies designed to investigate SLE biology and mechanisms of post-transplant responses.

1  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Study Objectives
1.1.1 Primary objective:  
To evaluate the rate of durable relapse-free complete clinical responses after using a 
lymphodepleting non-myeloablative regimen for autologous hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation (autoHSCT) in patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  
1.1.2 Secondary objectives:  
a) To evaluate toxicity of a lymphodepleting autoHSCT regimen in the setting of severe SLE.  
b) To evaluate biological markers of disease after autoHSCT for severe SLE.  c) To investigate immunological efficacy and mechanisms of responses after 
lymphodepleting autoHSCT for SLE.  
1.2 Background and rationale
1.2.1 Pathogenesis  
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the prototypic systemic autoimmune disease that can 
involve almost any organ and can range in severity from mild to life-threatening.  The 
pathogenesis of SLE is complex involving a spectrum of disease promoting mechanisms. A 
general model of pathogenesis is that in a genetically susceptible individual an initial breakdown 
in tolerance creates primary autoreactive effectors, which then propagate the autoimmune 
response by a variety of mechanisms that include positive-feedback amplification loops [1, 3]. 
Autoantibody production, complement activation, immune complex deposition, and leukocyte infiltration of target organs are key immunopathogenic events. There is a 24% concordance of 
disease between monozygotic twins, compared to only 2% between dizygotic twins [4] 
suggesting an important effect of the genetic background but at the same time implying an important role for environmental or stochastic factors. Although single gene defects can lead to 
lupus-like conditions in animal models, the genetic influence in humans is clearly polygenic and 
may be different from one patient to another. Elegant studies in mice that spontaneously develop lupus have demonstrated that different genetic loci are responsible for the initial loss of 
Page 9 of 115 
 tolerance, the amplification of the autoimmune process and the severity and specific organ 
involvement [5]. Most autoantibodies in human lupus are targeted against conserved nuclear 
antigens, such as DNA, nuclear proteins and nucleosomes [6]. The original inciting event leading 
to loss of tolerance is not known, but in both animal models and humans, central tolerance seems to remain intact [1]. In mice immunologic abnormalities can be detected well before the onset of 
clinical symptoms suggesting that the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are different at various 
stages of the disease. At the time of clinical presentation, the immune system of patients with 
systemic lupus is characterized by a myriad of abnormalities. These include abnormalities of T-
cells, B-cells, antigen presenting cells (APC) and the complement and cytokine network. At this 
stage it is difficult to determine what the primary abnormality was, but it is evident that there are 
mechanisms that form positive feedback loops that maintain the auto-inflammatory process and 
may prevent complete remission or cure with the currently used treatments. The T cell/B cell 
interaction is key in the amplification process, therefore targeting these cells is a reasonable 
approach of therapy. Presentation of autoantigens is also abnormal in SLE and modifying the 
way these antigens are presented to the regenerating immune system may lead to tolerance. At 
this point we cannot directly influence antigen presentation, but creating a non-inflammatory 
environment and deleting the potentially “autoreactive” APCs, such as B-cells, may achieve this 
goal.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_312618] an increased rate of 
proliferation and increased secretion of immunoglobulins, especially pathogenic IgG 
autoantibodies [7]. The increased B cell activity is T-cell dependent, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_257393] B-cells [8] [9] [10] [11]. Additional factors contributing to 
the increased activity of B-cells may involve decreased Fc receptor mediated inhibition or an enhanced activity of the mutational machinery [12] [13]. This may either reflect an intrinsic 
defect in the mutational machinery or, more likely, an altered state of B cell activation that 
effects the mutational process and may be associated with an escape of self-reactive B cells from 
the elimination process in the germinal center [13, 14]. Circumstantial evidence based primarily 
on clinical observations suggests that there may be at least two different types of autoantibody 
Page [ADDRESS_312619] is exemplified by [CONTACT_14181]-dsDNA antibody 
producing cells. The anti-dsDNA titer exhibits a correlation with disease activity, and responds 
to immunosuppression. It rises before and during disease flares and decreases after 
immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. This implies that this population of autoantibody producing cells may be proliferating lymphoblasts or early plasmablasts that are continuously replenished in a 
rapid and transient manner that is sensitive to antiproliferative agents. The second type of 
antibody producing cells includes B-cells secreting antinuclear antibody and autoantibodies to 
Ro, La, Sm/RNP and cardiolipin. Titers of these antibodies do not usually correlate with disease 
activity or therapy. These observations suggest that B-cells secreting antinuclear antibodies or 
autoantibodies to the nucleus, Ro, La, Sm/RNP may have fully differentiated to non-
proliferating, long-lived plasma cells that secrete immunoglobulins but do not proliferate and 
thus are not susceptible to antiproliferative agents. The conventional view of the role of B-cells 
in the pathogenesis of lupus has been that B-cells function solely as producers of autoantibodies. 
Emerging data have challenged this theory and indicate that B-cells may also play a role in the 
early events of the pathogenesis of SLE. B-cells are efficient antigen presenting cells for a 
variety of autoantigens [15] and may promote the breakdown of peripheral T-cell tolerance [16] 
[17] possibly by [CONTACT_257394] T cells with low affinity toward autoantigens [16].  B-
cells from patients with SLE produce higher levels of IL-10 [18] providing a positive autocrine 
feedback loop on B-cells for the production of autoantibodies. B cells may also produce other cytokines that could contribute to T-cell activation. The central role of B cells in the 
pathogenesis of lupus was demonstrated in a series of experiments in the MRL/lpr mouse model 
of SLE, that spontaneously develops a lupus-like autoimmune disease in an age-dependent 
manner [19].  First it was shown that B-cell deficient MRL/lpr mice do not develop 
glomerulonephritis (GN) [20] and more surprisingly, had a marked reduction in the number of 
activated memory T cells compared to B cell-intact controls [21]. The significant drop in 
activated memory T cell numbers correlated with the absence of cellular infiltrates in the kidney 
and skin suggesting a connection between T cell amplification and disease. Spontaneous T-cell 
activation was restored in mice reconstituted with B-cells that expressed membrane bound IgM but did not secrete soluble immunoglobulins [22]. These mice developed interstitial nephritis and 
vasculitis; histologically renal lesions were similar in appearance to the MRL/lpr animals. The 
presence of end-organ pathology in the absence of circulating antibodies supports the notion that 
Page 11 of 115 
 the role of B cells in promoting autoimmunity goes beyond the production of autoantibodies. 
This was further corroborated by [CONTACT_257395] B-cell deficient mice were infused with pooled 
serum from diseased MRL/lpr mice. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_257308], no 
renal disease was observed in B-cell deficient mice. Taken together, these data provided evidence that the physical presence of B-cells is essential for the clinical manifestations of lupus 
nephritis and T-cells are essential for tissue damage.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_312620] been isolated from lupus patients. The majority 
of these cells were CD4+, whereas a small fraction were Įȕ TCR+CD4-CD8- and Ȗį TCR+ [23] 
[24] [15]. Similarly, autoreactive T-cell clones that respond to nucleosomes have been isolated 
from lupus patients [25]. Spectratypi[INVESTIGATOR_257309] ȕ-chains revealed restricted CDR3 length 
polymorphism and oligoclonal CD4+ T cell activation in peripheral blood from SLE patients. 
These effects were more pronounced in active patients compared patients in remission [26].   
1.2.4 Hypothesis for the central role of T-cell-B-cell interaction in SLE  
Although the primary event in the initiation of autoimmunity is unknown, by [CONTACT_257396] B- and T-cells in the lymphoid 
organs in a self-perpetuating process ( Figure 1 ) [3] [1, 7].

Page 12 of 115 
 FIGURE 1. Central role of T-B cell interaction in SLE.  Autoantigens are presented to T 
cells in an inflammatory milieu by [CONTACT_22653] (a) and B cells. Once activated, 
they provide stimulation to hyper-responsive B-cells (b). These autoantigenstimulated B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation (c) and produce autoantibodies (d). Pathogenic autoantibodies (such as anti-dsDNA ab) deposit in the target organs and elicit an 
inflammatory response (e), leading to organ damage and release of self antigens (f) which are 
taken up by [CONTACT_257397] B cells (g) that leads to further T cell activation resulting in a positive amplification loop (h). Activated T cells will also migrate to the target organ (i) where they contribute to organ damage. Both activated B cells and T cells produce inflammatory cytokines that contribute to organ damage and provide an inflammatory milieu 
for abnormal presentation of auto-antigen by [CONTACT_85804] (j). Modified from [1, 2].  
Once activated, B cells can form memory cells; differentiate into auto-antibody forming plasma 
cells or plasmablasts; and present auto-antigen to T-cells, inducing proliferation of more activated T cells leading to amplification of this proc ess. Deleting B-cells when the disease is 
established may lead to a decrease in autoantigen presentation in the lymphoid organs that may in turn decrease the number of autoreactive T-cells and decrease both autoantibody production and activation of other effector cells.  Based on the animal data presented above, B-cell depletion 
may also reduce leukocyte infiltration at the sites of inflammation, and ameliorate tissue damage. 
Using agents that delete premature and mature B-cells, but not plasma cells, may decrease the 
 
Page 13 of 115 
 levels of pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibody levels, without reducing immunoglobulin levels 
globally, which could increase susceptibility to infections. Deleting activated T cells at the same time may be necessary to prevent activation of re maining precursors of autoreactive B cells and 
to prevent T cell help to naturally occurring low affinity autoreactive cells that may develop 
during the regeneration of the immune system.  
1.2.5 Epi[INVESTIGATOR_257310] 24 out of 100,000 individuals 
in the [LOCATION_002] [27].  The majority (90%) of patients is female and it is more common in 
minorities, particularly among African-Americans. Clinically, lupus is a heterogeneous disease 
ranging from a relatively mild condition to severe life-threatening disease involving major organs, such as the kidney, brain, lung or the hematopoetic system. Lupus nephritis is the most 
common major organ manifestation; about 80 % of patients have microscopic evidence of kidney 
involvement and about half of these develop clinically significant nephritis. Severe, potentially 
life-threatening major organ manifestations occur much less frequently.  
1.2.6 Factors associated with survival  
Overall 10-year survival rates range from 64-93% in North-American series published since 
1990. The standardized mortality rate (SMR), which compares mortality to the general population, was found to be four-fold increased in two different lupus cohorts [28], the increased 
mortality risk was higher in younger patients. Regarding the clinical and laboratory features of 
SLE, major organ involvement and persistent overall disease activity are by [CONTACT_257398] [reviewed in [29] [30].  
The presence of renal disease was associated with increased risk of mortality in all studies [31] 
[32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38]. Central nervous system involvement has also been associated 
with decreased survival in several studies [32] [39] [40] [41]. Lung involvement including 
pleuritis, lupus pneumonitis, pulmonary hemorrhage and pulmonary hypertension was found to 
be a predictive factor of mortality [34]. Anemia was an independent predictor of poor survival in 
one study even after adjustment for the presence of kidney disease [32] whereas 
thrombocytopenia was an independent predictor of poor survival in several studies [33] [34] [35] 
[42]. Overall disease activity has been shown to be a risk factor for mortality in a number of 
studies [36] [43] [44] [45] [46]. Greater overall disease activity, as measured by [CONTACT_257399] (SLEDAI) at the time of first visit to a lupus clinic 
and a high weighted SLEDAI score, depi[INVESTIGATOR_257311] a Canadian cohort [34], whereas a high weighted SLEDAI score 
was associated with decreased survival in another study [47]. 
1.2.7  Causes of Death  
The majority of fatalities among patients with SLE are attributable to active disease with major 
organ involvement, followed by [CONTACT_79422]  [30]. The infections most commonly occur in the 
Page 14 of 115 
 setting of active SLE and in patients receiving high dose corticosteroids and/or 
immunosuppressive therapy. Comorbid conditions and other complications of therapy account 
for the remainder of deaths. During the past decade, increasing attention has been directed 
toward a potentially preventable cause of mor tality: corticosteroidasso ciated coronary artery 
disease. In one study the incidence of myocardial infarction was nine-fold higher in SLE patients than in controls [48], while another study found that women with lupus in the 35-[ADDRESS_312621] a myocardial infarction than women of similar age 
in the Framingham Offspring Study [30] [2]. Several studies identified corticosteroid therapy as 
risk factor for cardiovascular disease in SLE patients [29]. Thus, in addition to controlling 
traditional risk factors of atherosclerosis, efforts should be made to minimize the life-long 
cumulative dose of corticosteroids.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_312622] of which were done at the NIH [49] [50] [51].  
The treatment of other potentially life threatening major organ manifestations, such as cerebritis, 
transverse myelitis, pneumonitis and pulmonary hemorrhage, is based on the experience gained in the treatment of severe lupus nephritis combined with organ-specific supportive therapy. 
Immune mediated hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia in SLE are treated as their idiopathic 
counterparts, AIHA and ITP [52]. The treatment of severe proliferative lupus nephritis will be 
summarized below. As mentioned above, the same principles apply to the treatment of most 
other major organ manifestations.  
There have been no controlled clinical trials proving the benefit of corticosteroids over 
supportive therapy in lupus nephritis.  Similarly, there have been no studies directly comparing 
conventional prednisone with methylprednisolone pulse therapy.  However, long clinical 
experience amply demonstrates the value of steroids and they remain the cornerstone of the 
management of patients with SLE and lupus nephritis.  
The current standard of treatment for focal and diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis has been 
established in a series of controlled studies of different regimens of cyclophosphamide and 
corticosteroids. The first of a series of controlled trials at the National Institutes of Health has 
shown that cyclophosphamide is superior to corticosteroids and azathioprine in preventing end-
stage renal disease (ESRD) [51]. The next study proved that a 6 month course of monthly bolus 
cyclophosphamide is effective in inducing renal response but prolonged courses (up to over 2 
years) of quarterly pulse cyclophosphamide are needed to maintain response [50]. The most 
recent study showed that renal remission was achieved somewhat more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_257312] [49]. Extended 
follow-up (median 11 years) of this study cohort, demonstrated persistent benefit of 
cyclophosphamide containing regimens compared to methylprednisolone alone. Indeed, the 
majority of the patients who initially received methylprednisolone eventually required 
Page 15 of 115 
 cyclophosphamide for the control of renal disease. At the end of the extended follow-up, eleven 
of the 82 patients died, 20 patients had doubled their serum creatinine and 15 of these progressed 
to end-stage renal disease [53].   
Approximately one-third to one-half of patients has a relapse of nephritis after achieving partial 
or complete remission of proliferative lupus nephritis. Since each major exacerbation is expected 
to leave residual and cumulative irreversible damage aggressive treatment is recommended for 
patients with moderate or severe nephritic flares. A kidney biopsy is strongly recommended in 
ambiguous situations [54].  
Alternatives to pulse cyclophosphamide induction therapy continue to be used at various centers 
around the world. Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil are among the most popular. 
Regarding azathioprine, most studies indicate that this drug adds marginally to the efficacy of 
prednisone alone. Thus, at the present time, azathioprine is used as primary therapy mainly in 
milder forms of lupus nephritis, in patients strongly opposed to use of cyclophosphamide and as 
maintenance therapy after induction of remission with cyclophosphamide. Mycophenolate 
mofetil (MMF) has been claimed to be equivalent to daily oral cyclophosphamide in a small 
study of 42 patients with diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis. All patients had significant 
improvement and there were no differences in response or early relapse rates between the two 
arms [55]. However, the flare rate in the mycophenolate group was significantly higher at the [ADDRESS_312623] in approximately 500 patients with autoimmune disease 
[56]. The majority of these transplants have b een performed in patients with high-risk therapy-
refractory multiple sclerosis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid 
arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The stage for 
these early studies has been set by [CONTACT_257400]-induced 
autoimmunity [57]. Additional impetus to the field was given by [CONTACT_257401] [58], [59] 
[60]. For the reasons of safety and clarity of initial trial results, international consensus 
guidelines in [ADDRESS_312624] in autoimmune disease should use 
autologous hematopoietic stem cell sources rather than allogeneic [61]. There are several 
theoretical mechanisms for how autoHSCT for autoimmune disease should work. First is the 
high-dose intensity effect by [CONTACT_257402]; dose-
intensified immunosuppression is supposed to overcome therapeutic resistance and result in 
Page [ADDRESS_312625] and decrease and delay in target-tissue injury. In that case 
hematopoietic stem cells source serves solely as a vehicle for hematopoietic rescue. The second 
presumed mechanism envisions restoration of self-tolerance by [CONTACT_257403]ïve immune system by [CONTACT_257404]-novo immune 
reconstitution from the hematopoietic stem cell. This favorable reconstitution would occur either 
in the absence of the initiating autoantigen or the tolerance would be acquired by [CONTACT_257405][INVESTIGATOR_257313]. Finally, high-dose therapy 
could be effective in eliminating cell populations which mediate complex and dysregulated 
immune circuits which are associated with the disease (concept of “resetting” the autoimmunity). 
Although there is indirect clinical evidence that at least some of these mechanisms are 
operational in the clinical autoHSCT, their relative contributions are unclear and may be 
different from disease to disease. Studies in monozygotic twins showed only a 15-30% rate of 
concordance for autoimmune disease, indicating that in spi[INVESTIGATOR_257314], 
environmental factors play a significant role in the development of autoimmunity. In fact, around 
70% of patients with autoimmune disease initially respond well to autoHSCT. About 2/3 
demonstrate durable remissions/stabilizations. Those patients who relapse frequently respond to 
salvage agents that were previously ineffective. Reasons for the recurrent autoimmune disease in 
patients after autoHSCT may include insufficient eradication of autoreactive lymphocytes during 
the transplant process or strong genetic component that could not be overcome by [CONTACT_257406].  
1.2.[ADDRESS_312626] in the 
treatment of a variety of severe, refractory autoimmune diseases. There are two types of animal 
models ( Table 1 ): 1. Autoimmune-prone animals that have genetic tendency to spontaneously 
develop either generalized autoimmunity such as the classic model of SLE in NZBxNZW F1 mice, or organ-specific autoimmunity, such as the model of diabetes mellitus in NOD mice; and 
2. antigen-induced models of autoimmune diseases such as adjuvant arthritis (AA) and 
experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). In cases of spontaneous autoimmune diseases, 
such as murine models of SLE, syngeneic bone marrow transplantation early in life has not 
prevented autoimmunity; however, allogeneic transplantation using autoimmune resistant strain has prevented, or in some instances when given early after the disease onset, ameliorated the 
autoimmune disease. In contrast, studies of antigen-induced autoimmune diseases in EAE and 
AA by [CONTACT_257407] [62] [57].  Application of findings from 
murine lupus-like models to clinical SLE must be done with caution since these mice originate 
from highly inbred strains raised in controlled environments. In outbred human populations, 
environmental exposure and regulatory cells may have a more significant role in modulating 
disease-associated processes. Therefore, antigen-induced models of autoimmunity may be a 
Page [ADDRESS_312627] lymphomyeloablative regimens [57]. By [CONTACT_257408] a human situation, 
the rate of cure could be increased by [CONTACT_257409] - unless the target cell specificity can be improved. Since most likely target cell 
candidates in overt autoimmune disease are T and B lymphocytes, a high priority is to search for 
agents or regimens that would increase the clinically effective window between lymphotoxicity 
and myelotoxicity. It is reasonable to expect that reinfusing T and B lymphocytes in the 
inoculum would add substantially to the residual population and should be avoided.

The majority of 29 published SLE cases (87%) responded to high-dose cyclophosphamide-based 
regimens and 20/29 (69%) maintained clinical remissions, 18/[ADDRESS_312632]-transplant ( Table 2 ). In spi[INVESTIGATOR_257315]-risk cases for these early 
trials, only one (3%) transplant-related death was reported in a hemodialysis dependent lupus-nephritis patient irreversible post-transplant marrow aplasia [71]. Publications of small case 
Page [ADDRESS_312633] activities related to BMT in autoimmune diseases and recently 
conducted a preliminary analysis of the reports in transplantation for SLE (David Jayne, personal 
communication). Fifty-tree out of [ADDRESS_312634] for SLE were 
analyzed. Cases were reported by 23 teams from 12 countries including Peoples Republic of 
China. Median patient age was 28 years (9-52). In 42/[ADDRESS_312635] common method of stem cell 
mobilization was a combination of cyclophosphamide and G-CSF. Conditioning regimens were 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_257316]-myeloablative, high-dose cyclophosphamide (n=32) or BEAM (BCNU, etoposide, 
cytarabine, melphalan) (n=4), with or without anti-thymocyte globulin. Eleven patients received 
TBI-based regimens and one a combination of busulfan and cyclophosphamide. Remission 
(defined as SLEDAI score <3 and prednisone < 10 mg/d) on an intention to treat basis occurred 
in 31 (58%) cases. At the median follow-up of two years, projected survival without evidence of 
disease activity was 59 +/- 17%. Eight out of 31 patients (26%) who achieved remission have 
relapsed and three have died of progressive SLE. There were seven (12%) transplant-related 
deaths in this multi-center series, three from septicemia, one from TTP, one from bleeding, one 
from secondary AML, and one from unknown causes. At the time of last follow-up steroids were 
successfully tapered only in 8 (15%) patients. Fourteen patients were still on steroids for disease 
control, and in additional individuals on post-transplant immunosuppression for disease control 
[(mycophenolate mofetil (n=12), cyclosporine (n=2) or cyclophosphamide (n=1)]. In summary, 
this EBMT experience demonstrated the feasibility of dose-intensification of immunosuppresion 
in patients with severe recurrent SLE many of whom had failed prior cyclophosphamide (70%) 
or other standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. Although some patients are able to stay in remission off steroids, 
durable immunosuppresion-free disease control remains a problem in most and the curative 
potential of this strategy remains uncertain. Transplant-related mortality remains difficult to 
interpret due to the insufficient details about patient clinical status at the time of transplant and 
due to the unknown center-effect typi[INVESTIGATOR_257317]-center registry analyses. The International 
Bone Marrow Transplant registry (IBMTR) started tracking activities in the transplants for 
autoimmune diseases more recently, in 2001, and no formal data analysis has been yet 
performed. By [CONTACT_14622] 2002, [ADDRESS_312636] been 
registered with the IBMTR from 8 teams in the United Sates (n=25) and one team from Europe 
(n=2). One patient received an HLA-identical allogeneic sibling transplant and all others 
received autologous transplants. According to the unofficial registry information, survival data 
are available for 16 cases, of which 13 are alive at 12 (3-30) months post-transplant. All deaths 
were within [ADDRESS_312637]-transplant, two due to unspecified infections (one of them after 
allotransplant) and one of idiopathic pneumonia. The only significant single center series of 
autoHSCT for severe SLE is by [CONTACT_257413]. Traynor et al 
published recently a five-year summary analysis of their data [73]. Fifteen patients with 
persistent and severe SLE, [ADDRESS_312638]. Stem cells were mobilized with cyclophosphamide 2.0 gm/m2

conditioning regimen used was cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg, horse antithymocyte globulin 90 
mg/kg, and methylprednisolone 3 gm. Outcome was evaluated by [CONTACT_257415], 
serum complement levels, serologic features, function of diseased organs and 
immunosuppressive medication requirements. Median follow-up is 36 months (12-66 mo) and no 
deaths occurred post-transplant. All patients demonstrated marked improvement and the 
SLEDAI score declined to < [ADDRESS_312639] follow-up, 8 patients 
are completely off immunosuppresion, one is receiving i.v. cyclophosphamide and six are on 
tapering prednisone doses of 5-15 mg/day. (After this follow-up was published one patient, who 
is now followed at the NIH and achieved complete clinical remission post-transplant, 
experienced a major lupus flare with pericarditis, rapi[INVESTIGATOR_103025], 
pneumonitis and severe hematologic manifestations.) An additional two patients were enrolled in 
to the Northwestern study, and underwent stem cell harvest but died before receiving the 
conditioning regimen. One died of Mucor  mycosis two weeks following chemomobilization and 
the other died of lupus cerebritis. Most common toxicities post-transplant included culture 
negative neutropenic fever (n=12), fluid retention necessitating dialysis (n=4), plantar 
dysesthesia or foot drop (n=4) and bacterial infection (n= 4), five patients required transient 
transfer to the intensive care unit. Patients at highest risk for more serious toxicities were those 
who had active glomerulonephritis with concurrent pulmonary or brain manifestations.   
1.2.[ADDRESS_312640] regimens 
demonstrates major clinical benefit in about 60% of standard-therapy refractory lupus patients, 
there are limitations associated with this procedure at its current stage. The first and major 
limitation is, assessment of the true magnitude of the benefit is obscured due to lack of 
standardization of study entry criteria, clinical response criteria, post-transplant 
immunosuppression schedule, and therapy of relapses. All these early studies were designed 
primarily as toxicity and feasibility trials, with disease response assessments being secondary 
endpoints. Patients enrolled in such studies were frequently too ill and were treated in numerous 
transplant centers, many of which had little experience in applying this treatment to SLE.  The 
second major deficiency of these early studies is the profound lack of the biological studies, so 
the immunological mechanisms that accompany disease responses in patients after autoHSCT for 
SLE are not clear. For example, relative contributions of the dose-intensification versus de-novo
establishment of immune tolerance post-transplant remain to be determined. Current clinical research strategies in HSCT for SLE are going in two general directions: One is to test high-dose 
cyclophosphamide-based regimens in the randomized phase III clinical trials as compared to the 
conventional NIH regimen of serial doses of intravenous cyclophosphamide [74]. If successful, 
this strategy may result in the establishment of autoHSCT as a new therapy standard for selected 
Page 21 of 115 
 patients with severe SLE. However, based on the current clinical experience in animal models 
and humans, high-dose cyclophosphamide alone may not be sufficiently immunodepleting to 
induce cures in the autologous transplant setting [75] [76].  The second clinical research strategy 
implies that the long term goals in autoimmune disease should be achievement of the 
immunological tolerance and cure rather than the delay of disease progression or attenuation of 
symptoms. To achieve these goals, it is critical to explore new approaches to autoHSCT. One 
proposed direction is based on the data from the animal experiments that suggest the use of more 
intense myeloablative preparative regimens to accomplish more effective depletion of the 
memory cells from the host [57]. Although this hypothesis still needs its formal testing in 
humans, the currently available data demonstrate that myeloablative regimens are the major risk 
factor for transplant-related mortality after autolo gous transplantation in autoimmune disease, 
and this hypothetical benefit may not be without serious increase in risks [57]. An alternative 
strategy to be explored includes the development of more specific immunodepleting regimens 
which spare patient from myeloablation. The main potential disadvantages of autoHSCT are its 
perceived toxicities and costs. On the other hand, in a genetically complex multifactorial disease 
such as SLE, HSCT procedure offers a unique potential of ablation of the disease process that 
could be theoretically followed by [CONTACT_257416] a functional 
immune system. Current conventional and novel biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_257318] a need for life-long 
pharamacological maintenance. Toxicities of long-term therapi[INVESTIGATOR_257319]-time costs associated with autoHSCT procedure. The situation 
may become even more complicated since biological therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (to be effective) may need to 
combine multiple agents with additional unpredictable compounding financial and toxic effects. 
On the other hand developi[INVESTIGATOR_257320]. 
Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a technology that has a one-time curative potential is a highly attractive therapeutic 
goal for patients with severe autoimmune disease. Study rationale  
1.2.[ADDRESS_312641] therapy resistant, active severe 
lupus with the potential of long-term response. The specific disease eligibility criteria are defined 
by [CONTACT_257417]:  
•  Eligible patients must have severe major organ manifestations associated with increased 
mortality or severe disability due to uncontrolled disease activity and/or anticipated toxicity 
associated with conventional immunosuppressive therapy.   
•  Subjects must have active disease manifestations that are known to respond to 
immunosuppressive therapy. Active disease must be differentiated from permanent damage (eg: proteinuria would be only regarded as active if the activity is supported by [CONTACT_257418] a 
biopsy).  
•  Treatment-refractory disease is defined as worsening of disease despi[INVESTIGATOR_257321] 22 of 115 
 immunosuppressive therapy or the inability to taper prednisone.  
•  The minimum length of prior immunosuppressive therapy is defined specifically for each 
organ involved.  
•  If a patient fulfills criteria on the basis of more than one major organ involvement, the 
primary target organ will be defined based on the degree of assessed risk for morbidity or 
mortality.   
B. Age criteria 
Patients eligible for this protocol will be 15-40 years old. The guiding criteria that 
determined the eligibility age range are the following:  
•  This age range captures most SLE patients who are potential candidates for this protocol.  
•  SLE in patients younger than 15 years of age has a different clinical course and there is no experience with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in this age group.   •  The upper age limit is based also on the studies from our laboratory on the recovery of 
thymic function after autologous-transplant, showing the lack of the TRECs and CD4
+
 cell 
number recovery in most patients older than [ADDRESS_312642]-transplant immune competence and autoantigen tolerance are dependent on functional thymus, patients older than 40 years of age will not be enrolled in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].   •  Age above 40 years was the main predictive factor for treatment failure in a large registry study of patients transplanted for autoimmune disease [77]. This supports the notion that 
age groups older than [ADDRESS_312643] regimen of steroid taper and successful 
tapering of corticosteroids a necessary element of response. Different grades of responses 
(complete, partial or no response) are defined for every target organ. All definitions will 
incorporate three aspects of response:  
1. Response in the primary target organ.  
2. Improvement in general disease activity.  
3. Ability to taper prednisone according to a predetermined schedule. Response will be 
evaluated at various time-points. Flares will be defined for all target organs and will be 
classified as severe and mild. At the end of the study patients will be classified as complete 
responders, partial responders or non-responders based on the degree and duration of response as defined for the primary target organ. The occurrence or absence of flares will be incorporated in the final classification of patients.  
Page [ADDRESS_312644] possible doses (200 mg/kg), cyclophosphamide 
does not sufficiently eliminate T-cells from the host and the recurrences of autoimmunity in the 
autologous setting or graft-rejections in the allogeneic setting are frequent problems. One 
strategy to address the insufficient lymphodepleting potential of cyclophosphamide is to use it in 
conjunction with total-body irradiation or high-doses of busulfan at myeloablative doses. 
Unfortunately, high-intensity myeloablative regimens correlate with a significant increase in the 
regimen-related mortality. An alternative strategy is to search for new regimens with better 
lymphotoxicity versus myelotoxicity ratio. In a separate line of investigation in B-cell chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, in vitro studies demonstrated a synergistic antitumor effects of 
fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and were first to support the use of this combination in clinical trials [78]. These studies in BCLL showed that patients resistant to either drug respond to 
the combination of the two with good tolerance, most common side-effects being 
immunosuppression and increased incidence of herpes simplex and varicella-zoster infections.  
In studies at the NCI in a murine F1-into-parent marrow transplant rejection model, a preparative 
regimen using the combination of daily fludarabine and cyclophosphamide showed much better 
selectivity in lymphodepletion and better efficacy in preventing the graft rejection than lethal 
total-body irradiation [79]. We took these experimental results into the clinic and incorporated 
this regimen in two NCI transplant protocols, 99-C-0143 (immunoablative allogeneic 
transplantation for hematologic malignancies) and CC 00-C0119 (immunoablative allogeneic 
transplantation and graft T-cell depletion for metastatic breast cancer). Sixty patients have been 
treated on these studies and pertinent findings demonstrated profound lymphodepletion after 
fludarabine/cyclophosophamide, excellent full engraftment rate and only 3% preparative 
regimen-related mortality (one sepsis and one cardiac arrhythmia) in a very high-risk group of 
allogeneic transplant patients, many of whom had advanced age or decreased organ function. 
This daily concurrent fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide regimen has been adopted as a current 
standard preparative regimen for allogeneic stem cell transplantation at the NCI for its excellent 
immunodepleting properties and good clinical tolerance [80]. The same will be used in the 
current autoHSCT protocol for SLE. Various other schedules and combinations of fludarabine 
and cyclophosphamide are the mainstay of preparative regimens for nonmyeloablative allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation worldwide; however, no study to date addressed its role as 
lymphodepletion in transplantation for autoimmune disease.   
1.2.15 Phase I/II lupus nephritis study of cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine at NIAMS  
For their immunosuppressive effects nucleoside analogs fludarabine and cladribine have been 
explored and shown activity in systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis and 
polymyositis [81] [82] [83] [84, 85].  Based on these experiences, we conducted a Phase I/II 
study to evaluate a short course of low-dose cyclophosphamide combined with fludarabine in 
patients with lupus nephritis (LN) (Illei et al, manuscript in preparation). Patients with active 
proliferative LN were treated with monthly oral boluses of low-dose cyclophosphamide (0.5 
Page 24 of 115 
 gm/m2
 on day 1) and subcutaneous fludarabine (30 mg/m2
 on days 1-3). Prednisone was 
aggressively tapered to a low-dose, alternate day schedule. Complete response (CR) was defined 
as stable creatinine, proteinuria < 1 gm/day and inactive urine sediment (<10 RBC/hpf and no 
cellular casts). Partial response was defined as > 50% reduction in 24 h proteinuria, if baseline > 
2 g/day, with persistently active urine sediment; or inactive urine sediment (if active at baseline) 
with proteinuria < 2 g/day if nephrotic at baseline or < 50% of baseline if non-nephrotic. The primary and secondary outcomes were determined at [ADDRESS_312645] 24 months to establish long-term effects of therapy. Thirteen patients were 
enrolled in the study; [ADDRESS_312646] disease (TA-
GVHD); two other patients had self-limited grade 4 neutropenia, not associated with any clinical 
sequelae. Three patients had mild leukopenia. In terms of efficacy, 8/[ADDRESS_312647]-treatment follow-up had sustained significant response: [ADDRESS_312648] persistent stable mild hematuria (n=2) or 
low grade proteinuria (n=1). Additional treatment was started in the 2 patients who had no 
significant response and in 1 patient with partial response who had a kidney biopsy at 24 months 
showing mild focal proliferative nephritis – much improved from her baseline. Prolonged CD4 
lymphocytopenia was noted in most patients (mean CD4: 98/uL at 7 months and 251/uL at 12 
months); this was not associated with an increased rate of infection.  
1.2.16 Rationale for Rituximab  
Rituximab is a chimeric IgG1 human/mouse anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody with human 
constant regions and mouse variable regions [86]. It is the first monoclonal antibody approved 
for clinical use in cancer and has become part of the standard therapy for patients with B-cell 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. To date more than 300,[ADDRESS_312649] been treated with rituximab 
worldwide where this antibody has been used alone or in combinations with cytotoxic agents or 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The monoclonal antibody is generally well tolerated up 
to single-infusion doses of 2,250 mg/m2
 [87]. Adverse events are typi[INVESTIGATOR_257322]-associated, 
mostly occur with the first dose and most commonly include chills, fever and rigor related to the 
release of cytokines. Rituximab treatment in lymphoma patients results in impaired secondary 
immune responses to recall antigens but does not result in decrease in immunoglobulin levels or 
increase in the number of infections [88]. Rituximab binds avidly to the CD20 antigen which is 
expressed on 95% of B-cell lymphoma cells and on normal B-cells and in much lower levels or 
not at all on plasma cells. Importantly, CD20 is not present on precursor B-cells or hematopoietic 
stem cells. The CD20 antigen is an appealing target for a selective immunotherapy for several 
reasons: CD20 does not circulate in the plasma, it is not shed from the surface of CD20+
 cells 
after antibody binding, and it is not internalized or down regulated [86]. Although the function of 
CD20 is not fully understood, factors such as complement-mediated lysis, effector cell-mediated 
Page 25 of 115 
 lysis, induction of apoptosis and interference with calcium influx into cell contribute to the 
cytotoxic activity. Infusion of rituximab to lymphoma patients results in selective depletion of 
CD20+ 
lymphocytes lasting 6-[ADDRESS_312650] infusion to 205.8 h after the fourth infusion 
[89]. Many autoimmune disorders and especially SLE are mediated in large part by B-cells and 
the elimination of autoreactive B-cell clones provides a rationale for the increasing use of 
rituximab in these diseases. Currently, the most promising information about the efficacy of 
rituximab is available from the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatomyositis, and type II mixed cryoglobulinemia, as 
well as in systemic lupus erythematosus [90]. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis a short 
induction dose of rituximab was well tolerated and resulted in durable responses in majority of 
patients as well as a significant additive effect if used in combination with a short course of 
relatively low-doses of cyclophosphamide or methotrexate [91].  In an ongoing study in the 
[LOCATION_002], Anolik et al reported on 18 patients with active but non-organ threatening SLE 
who were treated with three dose levels of rituximab, a single infusion of 100 mg/m2 (n=6), a 
single infusion of 375 mg/m2 (n=6) and a full course of four weekly doses of 375 mg/m2.  
Rituximab was well tolerated and it induced a dose-dependent depletion of CD19+ lymphocytes. 
Furthermore, the efficacy of B-cell depletion was influenced by [CONTACT_257419]-dose cohorts. The degree of B-cell depletion correlated with the 
clinical improvement in the symptoms of SLE, 7/12 patients who had good depletion of B-
lymphocytes (<1% CD19+ lymphocytes) had a statistically significant decrease in disease 
activity (SLAM) scores at 2-[ADDRESS_312651], those patients who did not 
achieve a good CD19+ cell depletion experienced a continuous increase in their SLAM scores 
during the same period of time [92]. Overall, the early data indicate promising safety and 
efficacy of rituximab in the treatment of patients with SLE warranting future larger trials.  
Another report from England by [CONTACT_257420]-label basis. During the two-
week period each patient received two 500 mg infusions of rituximab, two 750 mg infusions of 
cyclophosphamide, and high-doses of oral corticosteroids. No significant side-effects were 
observed during the follow-up. Five out of six patients had improved as evidenced by [CONTACT_257421] a median of 14 (range 9-27) at baseline to a 
median of 6 (range 3-8) at 6 months. Manifestations of SLE such as fatigue, arthralgia/arthritis, 
and serositis responded particularly well to this protocol. Disease parameters improved after 
rituximab in most patients as assessed by [CONTACT_257422], decrease in the erythrocyte 
sedimentation rate, increase in complement level, and in two cases by [CONTACT_257423]. At the follow-up of 6-18 months, two patients are still well enough 
without additional immunosuppression despi[INVESTIGATOR_257323], two patients relapsed at 7 and 8 months [93]. In another report from Europe, Perrotta et al reported a 
resolution of SLE related autoimmune hemolytic anemia after two doses of 375 mg/m2 of 
Page 26 of 115 
 rituximab that remained durable at 7 months after therapy [94].  These preliminary data on 
efficacy and safety of rituximab in SLE and its potent B-cell depleting activity provide the 
rationale for its use in combination with other cytotoxic and immunodepleting drugs for 
autologous stem cell transplantation. Immunodepleting regimens with high-dose 
cyclophosphamide or combinations of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine are more biased 
towards T-cell depletion than B-cell depletion and their use in combination with a potent anti-B-
cell agent is rational given the role of both cell populations in the pathogenesis of the disease.  
Rituximab sensitizes to and significantly enhances the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs on neoplastic 
lymphocytes in vitro [95]. Combinations of rituximab with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide 
have been shown in clinical trials to be very effective and safe in non-transplant therapy of B-
CLL, resulting in a dramatic increase of profound molecular remissions and clinical responses 
providing the rationale for further use of this combination for lymphodepletion. Khouri used with 
success a combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and fludarabine in a conditioning 
regimen for non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation in low-grade lymphoma [96]. 
The combination was extremely well tolerated with promising clinical anti-lymphoma efficacy 
and low-incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease, suggesting a potential clinical benefit of 
added depletion of malignant and non-malignant B-lymphocytes. Finally, a number of trials used 
rituximab in conjunction with autologous stem cell transplantation for patients with lowgrade 
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, showing promising safety and efficacy in this setting [86].  
1.2.17 Rational for priming regimen and stem cell support  
The priming regimen to be used in this study has several purposes: a) mobilization of 
hematopoietic stem cells, b) control of disease activity, c) in vivo graft-purging, and d) control of 
infusional side-effects. The addition of cyclophosphamide to G-CSF for hematopoietic stem cell 
mobilization in autoimmune disease results in better CD34+ cell yields, better control of the 
autoimmune disease and the elimination of G-CSF associated disease flares [97, 98]. The 2 
gm/m2 cyclophosphamide dose has been shown to be as effective in obtaining good CD34+ cell 
doses but is less toxic than 4 gm/m2 cyclophosphamide. The one-time bolus dose of high-dose 
methylprednisolone at the beginning of mobilization has been commonly used in autoimmune 
disease protocols to accomplish a rapid disease control, attenuate antibody-induced infusional 
side effects, and prevent flares. Several studies of autologous stem cell transplantation for B-
CLL and mantle cell lymphoma showed the efficacy and safety of rituximab when used for in 
vivo graft purging of malignant cells from the stem cell product [99-103]. Administration of 
rituximab resulted in dramatic reduction of B-cells from the graft, no interference with the 
engraftment and high-rate of long-term molecular remissions post-transplant in patients with 
advanced low-grade B-cell malignancies. In vivo administration of rituximab for B-cell depletion 
does not interfere with the procedures for the CD34 cell selection [100, 104]. There is an 
additional possibility that administration of G-CSF may enhance the effector cell function and 
improve killing of the target cells by [CONTACT_16682]-CD20 monoclonal antibody [105-107]. To 
minimize the reinfusion of memory T-cells, hematopoietic stem cell product will be further 
Page 27 of 115 
 depleted ex vivo of T-cells by [CONTACT_200970]34 cell positive selection. It is expected that such 
manipulation will provide about 4 log T-cell depletion from the graft with >90% CD34 cell 
purity. The hematopoietic stem cell support in the current protocol is given to minimize the 
myelotoxicity of the regimen and to build a foundation for the future graft engineering protocols.  
1.2.[ADDRESS_312652] patients. We doubled 
the single dose of rituximab in the conditioning regimen. The rationale for this higher rituximab 
dosing is for the sake of simplicity and also to be consistent with the intention of dose-
intensification during conditioning [108]. This is based also on the evidence from the dose 
escalation trial conducted by O’Brien et al where rituximab was given safely up to the six times 
higher single doses than prescribed by [CONTACT_257424] [87]. Since toxicities of rituximab are most 
common during the first infusion, we still decided to adhere to the standard dose during the 
initial administration in the priming regimen. Available information supports also a clear dose-
response effect of rituximab. The ultimate goal of this study is to evaluate if reeducation of the 
immune system and cure can be achieved with intensive immunoablative therapy approaches.    
1.[ADDRESS_312653] for 
patients with severe SLE. The primary goal is to assess the rate of durable complete clinical 
responses. It is expected that such transplant regimen with attenuated doses of cyclophosphamide 
would result in improved efficacy/toxicity ratio in treating patients with severe SLE. The study 
also incorporates tightly defined patient selection and clinical response criteria and precise 
definitions for the use of post-transplant immunosuppression and therapy of flares. Such strictly 
defined criteria should improve the interpretation of the results of the study. Major components 
of this research are the in-depth studies of SLE biology and transplantation immunology. The 
long-term goal is to develop a basis for future transplant protocols that would incorporate new 
cellular or other immunotherapeutic interventions to further improve results of transplants with 
the ultimate goal of cure for SLE.

Analgesics (except NSAIDs) including narcotics will be allowed if needed. Flares that occur before HSCT will be treated with 
corticosteroids. Prednisone will be tapered according to a predetermined schedule based on the 
dose at the time of transplant. The treatment of flares after HSCT is specified later in the protocol (section 5.2.5). The following treatments must be discontinued before mobilization;

before mobilization. Flares in disease activity before HSCT will be controlled with 
corticosteroids as clinically indicated. The daily dose of prednisone will be maximized 
at 1mg/kg with 80 mg/day being the maximal dose; if a patient requires higher doses, 
they will be treated with pulse methylprednisolone (1 gm methylprednisolone i.v. for 1-
3 days).  
[IP_ADDRESS]   Post-HSCT:  corticosteroids will be tapered according to Appendix C. Tapering can be 
started as early as clinically feasible as but not later than Day [ADDRESS_312671] transplant. The 
dose of prednisone will be decreased every two weeks by [CONTACT_225953] 10 mg/day 
for doses > 35mg/day and by [CONTACT_225953] 5mg/day for doses 35 mg/day. After 
reaching 20 mg/day a taper to alternate day dosing will be attempted. If patients show no clinical sign/symptoms of lupus activity, a more rapid taper can be attempted; if this 
results in reappearance of disease activity the dose can be increased to the dose shown 
in Appendix C  Table for that time point. This will not be considered a flare. The taper 
can be suspended in case of signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or severe steroid withdrawal. Stress doses of steroids can be used for intercurrent infections or 
other stressful situations, when clinically indicated.  The goal is to discontinue prednisone unless signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or severe steroid 
withdrawal develop.   
3.6  Off Study Criteria
3.6.1 Patients will be removed from protocol for any of the following reasons:  
a) Inadequate stem cell collection (Section 3.2.4).   
b) Irreversible non-hematologic toxicity (> grade 3) during the priming.  
c) The patient refuses to continue therapy or withdraws consent.  
Page 41 of 115 
 d) No response to therapy (see 5.2.6). Patient can still be followed every 6 months up to 
five years for survival and the SLE treatment history data.  
e) In addition, the patient may at any time be removed from protocol at the principal 
investigator’s discretion, if the PI [INVESTIGATOR_257341].  Reasons for this action may include (but are not limited to) disease 
progression with declining organ function/performance status before transplantation; 
inadequate family/caregiver support; noncompliance.

 3.7.3 Patient flow coordination between two institutes Candidates for this study will be 
identified through the NIAMS Lupus clinic. The eligibility will be assessed by [CONTACT_257435]. After confirmation of eligibility informed consent signature [CONTACT_257504]’ care will be transferred to the NCI primary team until the 
discharge from the transplant inpatient and da y-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_65273], which is anticipated to 
occur by [CONTACT_253898] [ADDRESS_312678] 
2x/weeks on the inpatient service and at least 1x/week on the outpatient service. All SLE-
specific clinical response evaluations will be conducted by [CONTACT_257436]. At the 
points when patients return to the NIH for the routine post-transplant long-term follow-up 
(beyond 100 days), evaluations will be scheduled in both NIAMS and NCI facilities. The 
NCI research team will hold the ultimate responsibility that all protocol-related data are 
collected, recorded on case report forms and stored as planned.  
3.[ADDRESS_312679]. Special emphasis 
will be put on the evaluating B- and T-lymphocyte and dendritic cell (DC) subsets and their 
functional status. Clinical correlations with lupus activity will be made. We will attempt to 
obtain a detailed and comprehensive pi[INVESTIGATOR_257342], such as lymph nodes 
and thymus either directly or indirectly. To achieve these goals, we will collect routine CBC at 
each time point TBNK assay and phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_257343]-specified 
time-points.  Bone marrow biopsy will be done at baseline and at 6,[ADDRESS_312680] small clones of abnormal myeloid progenitor cells.  
Specific research studies:  
1 T- and B-lymphocyte, NK and DC subsets and their activation status will be determined 
Page 46 of 115

specific antibodies from PBMCS, bone marrow and fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_257344].  
2 Detection of TRECs from PBMCs to assess the number of recent thymic emmigrants  
3 Assays of T- cell, B-cell and NK function.  
4 B-cells: ELISPOT assays to detect anti-dsDNA producing plasma cells.  
5 RNA isolation: mRNA from whole blood and B- and T-cell subsets will be isolated and 
tested with mRNA micro-arrays for change in expression of inflammatory molecules.  
6 Serum cytokine levels using multiplex cytokine assays.

Serum, urine, CSF , cells and RNA will be stored and may be used for future studies evaluating 
markers of lupus activity and/or imunnoregeneration.  A more detailed description of research 
studies is given in Appendix A . Please refer to Appendix M  for a description of the processes 
used in this study for the tracking and storage of human specimens.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_257345].  
4 SUPPORTIVE CARE  
4.1 Infection Prophylaxis
 See Appendix B  for detailed description. All patients will receive:  
4.1.[ADDRESS_312681] Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, prior to priming and continuing 
until transplantation, and resuming at the time of neutrophil and platelet recovery. PCP 
prophylaxis will continue until 12 months, steroids are tapered and CD4 counts >200/μL, 
whichever comes later. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the preferred regimen, but 
alternative regimens are available for patients with a history of adverse reactions to 
Bactrim.  See Appendix B, Section 9.1.[ADDRESS_312682] herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus 
infection/reactivation.  This therapy will start at the time of chemomoblization, 
continuing through transplantation until 12 months, steroids are tapered, and 
CD4>200/μL.  See Appendix B, Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details.  
4.1.4  If pre-transplant serology for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is positive, monitoring for CMV 
reactivation by [CONTACT_257438]. 
Positive antigenemia will be treated according to the schema in the Appendix B, Section 
Page 47 of 115 
 [IP_ADDRESS]. Weekly monitoring will continue through day +100 and until CD4 count 
>200/μL – see Appendix B).  
4.1.[ADDRESS_312683] Support
Patients will receive packed red blood cells and platelets as needed to maintain Hb > 8.0 gm/dl, 
and plts > 10,000/mm3
 (or higher, if clinically indicated).  All blood products with the exception 
of the stem cell product will be irradiated.  
4.3.1 Leukocyte-reduction filters will be utilized for all blood and platelet transfusions to 
decrease sensitization to transfused leukocytes and decrease the risk of CMV infection.  
4.4 Nutritional Support
When mucositis or other patient condition prevents adequate PO intake, parenteral 
hyperalimentation will be instituted and discontinued under the direction of the dietary service. 
Oral intake will resume when clinically appropriate under the supervision of the dietary service 
of the Clinical Center.  
Page 48 of 115 
 4.5 Anti-emetics   
Anti-emetic usage will follow Clinical Center Guidelines as well as recommendations from the 
Pharmacy service.  
4.6  Hematopoietic Growth Factor Support   
All patients will start filgrastim (GCSF) 5μg/kg/day on day +1. The dose will be given 
subcutaneously (SC). G-CSF will be continued until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is > 
500/μL, it can be resumed if ANC drops or stays below 1000/ μL per discretion of the attending 
physician if clinically indicated.  
5 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION 
5.1  Data Collection  
Data will be prospectively collected and entered into the Center for Clinical Research database. 
All laboratory adverse events will be collected from grade 2. Protocol-specific case report 
forms will be developed and filled out by [CONTACT_257439] (all lupus-specific evaluations such as SLEDAI will be 
performed exclusively by [CONTACT_257440]). Working relationships between the teams are 
described in section 3.7.2. NCI research team is ultimately responsible for the appropriate data 
collection and storage as defined by [CONTACT_760].

5.2.4  Organ-specific efficacy definitions:  
Renal:  
Complete response  
a. Stable or improved renal function: <30% increase in serum creatinine or <20% decrease 
in GFR and

nephritic sediment with biopsy proven proliferative nephritis or for patients where 
a biopsy is contraindicated: reappearance of sustained (repeatedly present at least 
1month apart) nephritic sediment with sustained > 30% increase in serum 
creatinine or > 20% decrease in GFR  
 
5.2.5 CNS Lupus

a. Stable or improved clinical exam: no more than a 5 point worsening on the NRS 
required on two consecutive exams (3 months apart). The presence and frequency of seizures before HSCT will be documented. If the seizures disappear, this will 
be considered a response. If seizures persist, but do not increase in frequency, it 
will be assumed that this is a response to treatment assuming that other objectives 
measure of CNS inflammation, such as MRI and/or CSF normalize. If the seizure 
frequency and/or severity increase, we will consider this a treatment failure. De 
novo occurrence of seizures will similarly be considered a failure.  
b. No objective signs of CNS inflammation: No signs of inflammation on MRI

b. Increase prednisone up to 0.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks, taper prednisone to baseline over 4 
weeks  
 
2. Major : treatment failure Treat as clinically indicated  
5.2.7  Assessment of response  
Response to therapy will be assessed every 3 months following transplant. At each time-point 
patients will be classified as   
xComplete clinical responders or  
xPartial responders or  
xNon-responders  
based on the criteria defined previously. The final outcome of the patients will be determined at 
24 months. They will be classified as  
xResponders, if they fulfill criteria for relapse-free complete clinical response  
xPartial responders: if they fulfill criteria for partial response and have maintained it for at 
least 3 months or they had one (1) epi[INVESTIGATOR_257346]/minor flare and maintained partial or complete clinical response for at least 3 months (as above)  
xNon-responders: if they never achieved partial or complete response criteria or they had a 
major flare or they had more than one indeterminate/minor flare that required increase in 
their prednisone dose.  
 
5.3 Toxicity Criteria
This study will use the CTC version 3.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting. A copy of the 
CTC version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov
). Known 
toxicities for each agent used in this protocol are listed in section 8.[ADDRESS_312685] from nQuery Advisor, if 14 subjects are enrolled, there is 
84% power to be able to detect the difference between a null proportion of 70% with success and 
a more desirable alternative as high as 95%, using a one-sided 0.[ADDRESS_312686].  In other 
words, if we conducted this study repeatedly, and if the true major response rate were 95%, then 
with 14 patients, 84% of the time, we would obtain the result that the lower bound of a one-sided 
95% confidence interval exceeded 70%. Since we are also concerned about the possible toxicity 
associated with the proposed therapy, this will also be closely monitored and used to determine 
the suitability of continuing to enroll patients onto th e trial. It would be expected that there is no 
more than a 5% probability of any individual patient experiencing an early non-lupus related death on the study. As such, the probability of observing 0 such deaths in 14 patients would be 
49% and 1 such death in 14 would be 36%. Thus, there is approximately 85% probability that no 
more than one such death would be observed in 14 patients if the true probability of this 
happening to any individual patient were 5%. If one such death occurs prior to accrual of the 14 
patients, then this would result in a re-evaluation of protocol procedures, but not termination of 
accrual. If there are two early non-lupus related deaths on the study, the trial will cease 
enrollment. This more likely indicates that the true probability of these events is perhaps 20% 
rather than 5%, since the probability of 2 or more events in 14 is 80% if the true probability were 
20%.   
The evaluation for continuous relapse-free complete clinical response at [ADDRESS_312687] 1.5 x 106
 
selected CD34+ cells/kg will be taken off study and considered inevaluable for response. 
However, the trial will terminate early due to toxicity if there are two early non-lupus related 
deaths in any enrolled patients, regardless of whether they are evaluable for response or not.  In 
order to assure [ADDRESS_312688] been proposed. All 
endpoints relating to time to an event will be analyzed via the Kaplan-Meier method. Other 
measures which involve baseline and then follow-up evaluations will be done by [CONTACT_257445]-up evaluation (see section 3.7.1 for details of the follow-up 
points), and using paired non-parametric tests to compare the changes. Since these evaluations 
will be considered secondary, the results will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons, and will 
be carefully stated as being the result of exploratory evaluations.  
It is expected that approximately one such patient per month may be enrolled onto this trial; thus 
accrual should be completed in 1.[ADDRESS_312689]. However, an independent 3-
person review committee has been established to review all deaths to determine if those 
are related to the underlying disease or to the experimental treatment. The committee 
consists of 2 lupus experts (Mark Gourley NIEHS, Peggy Crow, Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257347], NY) and 1 bone marrow transplant expert (Harry Malech, NIAID). In 
exceptional special circumstances (for example but not limited to - inability to serve on 
the panel, or in an unusual situation where the SLE expert is at the same time a referring 
physician), PI [INVESTIGATOR_257348] a substitute for a member of this committee and inform 
immediately the IRB about this change. Also it is anticipated that deliberations of this 
committe will be done by a conference call under provision that all necessary and requested documentation on the respective patient is provided in advance. The committee 
will provide its assessment to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_257349], as 
appropriate. If the death is considered to be at least probably related to the experimental 
therapy the protocol procedures will be re-evaluated but enrollment will not be 
terminated. If there are two early non-lupus related deaths on the study, the trial will 
cease enrollment.  
5.4.3 The PI [INVESTIGATOR_257350], close monitoring, with prompt 
reporting of unexpected or serious adverse events to the IRB and FDA (Section 7.1).  On 
a weekly basis, the PI, Clinical Chairperson, Protocol Research Nurse, and Transplant 
Coordinator will review clinical and laboratory data from each of the transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  A complete summary of patient outcomes will be provided annually to the 
IRB and FDA. Protocol Support Office of the Medical Oncology Clinical Research Unit, 
CCR, NCI will assist with annual internal auditing of subject case records. After accrual 
Page [ADDRESS_312690] to risk factors for toxic 
events renders these parameters impractical to evaluate in a statistical manner; 
accordingly, formal stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_257351].  
[ADDRESS_312691] selection  
Subjects with severe treatment refractory SLE will be enrolled. The gender distribution (F:M) for 
lupus is 9:[ADDRESS_312692] and fourth decade. SLE is ~[ADDRESS_312693] the appropriate study subjects and/or contact[CONTACT_257446]-, Hispanic-, or Asian-American 
subject recruitment.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_312694] experience with 
this age group. SLE in patients younger than 15 years of age has a different course and there is 
no experience with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide or rituximab in lupus patients in this age 
group, therefore patients under 15 years of age will not be included in the study. If the safety of 
this treatment is established, younger patients may be considered for future studies. 
6.2 Evaluation of Benefits and Risks/Discomforts 
The patient population eligible may benefit from this treatment by [CONTACT_257447]. It is expected that this benefit may occur in at least 
half of the cases, in this population of patients who failed all available standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
Achievement of durable responses is expected to result in improved survival, less disability, and 
better quality of life. This is however a more than standard risk procedure with estimated 
procedure-related mortality risk of up to 5%, there is also a theoretical but probably small risk of 
irreversible procedure-related injury to vital orga ns due to transplant-related complications such 
as unusual drug-induced side effects or infections or, in theory, a risk for bone marrow injury 
that would result in secondary myelodysplastic syndromes. Other more common risks would be 
Page [ADDRESS_312695] keepi[INVESTIGATOR_257352]. In case of the adverse 
effects of the study related therapy all medical intervention will be provided at the site by [CONTACT_58860]. 
6.3 Risks/Benefits Analysis 
The anticipated risks of this therapy are considered justifiable given the fact that for this patient 
population, no effective standard therapi[INVESTIGATOR_35734]. These patients are at a much higher risk for 
mortality and disability from their disease or its conventional treatments than of this therapy if 
the therapy provides the anticipated results. To ensure the anticipated risk/benefit ratio, the 
protocol has implemented careful monitoring of toxicities, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004], as well as a data safety 
monitoring plan. In addition to the potential benefit to the patients enrolled in this study, there is 
a strong potential for a broader benefit to future patients by [CONTACT_35947] a better knowledge of the 
systemic lupus disease process and ways to cure it. Some patients younger than 18 years of age 
(15-18 years) are anticipated to be enrolled in this study. Although the overall risk is considered 
to be greater than minimal, there is a strong potential for a therapeutic benefit and intent built in 
this protocol that is in accordance with federal guidelines for approvable research in children. In 
fact, due to the better prospects for complete immune reconstitution in younger individuals, 
children are those who are the most likely to have successful outcome with transplant therapy. 
6.[ADDRESS_312696]’s understanding that this treatment is investigational, that it may not 
result in the direct benefit, and that there is a short term risk form the procedure-related mortality 
of 5%. An informed consent document, and assent for individuals under age 18, will be obtained 
and signed from the patients by [CONTACT_978] (or one of his clinical associates), in the presence of a 
NIAMS and an NCI team representative and an independent monitor who is familiar with the 
ethical and regulatory requirements for informed consent. The independent monitor will 
ascertain that the subject understood that this is an experimental approach, which may not lead to 
direct benefit and may be associated with significant risks, including death. The independent 
monitors who agreed to observe and document the process of obtaining the consent are [CONTACT_257506] 57 of 115 
 Mildred Wilson, RN and Beverly Barham RN. Both are research nurses at NIAMS with all 
necessary training and both are currently doing the observed consent for the neurocognitive 
lupus study at NIAMS. Thereafter, the Principal Investigator (or his designee) and the subject 
(and/or his/her legal representative) will sign the consent document in the presence of an 
independent witness. The independent monitor will also assist the investigators to identify 
subjects for whom additional assessment of decisional capacity would be appropriate. Such 
participants will then be evaluated for their decisional capacity to participate in this protocol by 
[CONTACT_257448]. The original signed consent and assent documents 
will be kept with the patient’s chart. The Data Management Section will also retain a copy of the 
informed consent and assent documents. A copy of the informed consent and assent documents 
will also be given to the patient.  
7  DATA REPORTING  
7.1  Adverse Event Reporting
 This protocol is registered with the FDA under IND number 66,867 (Holder: [CONTACT_257507]). The IND was withdrawn from the FDA in May 2012.  Reports of adverse events will 
be made using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 for reference 
according to the guidelines published by [CONTACT_22688], NCI on June 10, 2003. A copy of the 
CTCAE v3.0 can be obtained from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Guidelines for 
AE reporting are summarized as follows:  
7.1.1  The protocol PI [INVESTIGATOR_10038]-IRB:  
All serious adverse events (SAEs) that are not in the consent form, but are possibly, probably or 
definitely related to the research.  An SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence 
that: resulted in a death ;
 was life-threatening; required or prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; caused persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity; resulted in congenital anomalies or birth defects; or required intervention to 
prevent permanent impairment or death.  All other deaths not included in the SAE category 
above.  
 All grade 3 and 4 (CTCAE) events that are not in the consent and that are possibly, probably or 
definitely related to the research, but not included in the SAE category above. All life-
threatening or disabling events (i.e., grade 4, except for myelosuppression), which may be due to 
administration of the study drug(s). Since hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257353]-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257354] a rule

eligibility form will be filled out before entering on the study. Study data will be reported 
as case-report forms and study summaries.  
8  PHARMACEUTICAL AND INVESTIGATIONAL DEVICE INFORMATION  
 
8.1  CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (CTX, Cytoxan, NSC-[ZIP_CODE])
8.1.1  Supply – Cyclophosphamide will be purchased by [CONTACT_257449] a lyophilized powder in various 
vial sizes.  
8.1.2  Preparation - will be reconstituted with sterile water for injection to yield a final 
concentration of 20 mg/ml as described in the package insert.  
8.1.3  Storage and Stability - The vials are stored at room temperature. Following 
reconstitution as directed, solutions of cyclophosphamide are stable for 24 hours at room temperature, or 6 days when refrigerated at 2-8° C.  
8.1.4  Route of Administration - The cyclophosphamide used in this regimen will be mixed in 
100 ml normal saline and given as an IVPB over 2 hours.  
8.1.5  Toxicities:  
a) Nausea and vomiting - variable; symptomatically improved with standard anti-emetics and/or 
benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] [e.g., lorazepam].  
b) Water retention – cyclophosphamide may rarely provoke the syndrome of inappropriate 
antidiuretic hormone secretion and resultant hyponatremia, usually manifested 12-48 hrs after IV 
administration, necessitating frequent accurate assessment [q 1-2 hrs] of intake, urine output and 
urine specific gravity.  This effect can be counteracted by [CONTACT_22691]. Fluid restriction is not 
feasible during administration of high dose cyclophosphamide.  
c) Cardiomyopathy -cyclophosphamide may cause severe, sometimes lethal, hemorrhagic 
myocardial necrosis or congestive cardiomyopathy. Patients may present with congestive cardiomyopathy as late as [ADDRESS_312700] dose of cyclophosphamide. The clinical 
syndrome has been observed in patients receiving the dose of cyclophosphamide in this regimen 
Page 60 of 115 
 in allogeneic transplantation patients. In an attempt to minimize this complication, patients with 
significant cardiac dysfunction are excluded from this protocol [see patient eligibility]. 
Congestive failure is managed according to standard medical therapeutics.  
d) Hemorrhagic cystitis – this is a serious, potentially life-threatening complication related to 
injury of the bladder epi[INVESTIGATOR_22618].  Although subclinical 
hematuria is not uncommon at this dose level, clinically significant hematuria or serious 
hemorrhage can usually be avoided by [CONTACT_117354] a high urine volume and frequent voiding and 
the administration of Mesna. Diuresis is maintained for [ADDRESS_312701] dose by 
[CONTACT_257450] 0.9% Sodium Chloride with potassium chloride, as specified in section 
3.2. Careful monitoring of serum and urine electrolytes is mandated.  Furosemide may be 
required to ensure this diuresis. Continuous bladder irrigation may be used for control of 
significant hematuria.  
e) Sterility after cyclophosphamide is a possibility and more commonly occurs in female patients 
above age 26-30 years.  
f) Less common but serious complications include pulmonary fibrosis and secondary 
malignancies. Less common but reversible toxicities include alopecia and skin rash.  
8.2  MESNA  (Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate, Mesnum, Mesnex, NSC113891)
8.2.1  Supply – Mesna will be will be purchased by [CONTACT_257449] a 100mg/ml solution.  
8.2.2  Preparation  
 Priming regimen: The Mesna should be prepared in 100 ml of either 5% Dextrose in Water, 
USP or 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP and infused over 15-30 minutes.  
 Conditioning regimen: Dilute up to 20 mg Mesna/ml fluid in D5W or 0.9% Sodium Chloride. 
Mesna should be started concurrently with the the start of cyclophosphamide at 1200 mg/m2
 in 
500 ml by [CONTACT_22694] 24 hour infusion for four doses (days -6, 5, -4, and -3).  
8.2.3  Storage and Stability – Intact ampules are stored at room temperature. Diluted solutions 
(1 to 20 mg/dl) are physically and chemically stable for at least 24 hours under 
refrigeration.  Mesna is chemically stable at room temperature for 48-72 hours in D5W, 
48-72 hour in D5W/0.45% sodium chloride, or 24 hours in 0.9% sodium chloride.  
8.2.4  Administration - To be administered intravenously as continuous infusion.  
8.2.5  Toxicities - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.  
Page 61 of 115 
 8.3  FILGRASTIM  (G-CSF, Neupogen®)  
8.3.1  Supply – Commercially available as filgrastim injection in a concentration of 300 μg/ml 
in 1ml (300μ g) and 1.6ml (480μ g) vials.  
8.3.2  Preparation – For subcutaneous administration, the appropriate prescribed dose is drawn 
up from the vial with no further dilution prior to administration. For intravenous 
administration, the commercial solution for injection should be diluted prior to 
administration.  It is recommended that the prescribed dose be diluted with dextrose 5% 
in water to a concentration greater than 5 μg/ml. Dilution of filgrastim to a final 
concentration of less than 5 μg/ml is not recommended at any time. Do not dilute with 
saline at any time; product may precipi[INVESTIGATOR_047]. Filgrastim diluted to concentrations between 
5 and 15μg/ml should be protected from absorption to plastic materials by [CONTACT_257451] (Human) to a final concentration of 2mg/ml. When diluted in 5% dextrose or 
5% dextrose plus Albumin (Human), filgrastim is compatible with glass bottles, PVC and 
polyolefin IV bags, and polypropylene syringes.  The dose may be “rounded down” to 
within 10% of patient’s calculated dose to use the drug cost-effectively.  
8.3.3  Storage and Stability – Filgrastim for injection should be stored in the refrigerator at 2o
 
to 8o
C (36o
 to 46o
F). Avoid shaking.  
8.3.4  Administration – Subcutaneous injection is preferred.  If clinically indicated, filgrastim 
may be administered as an intravenous infusion over 4 or 24 hours.  
8.3.5  Toxicities – Medullary bone or skeletal pain is the most commonly reported toxicity.  In 
addition, reversible elevations in uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline 
phosphatase are common laboratory abnormalities. Four cases of splenic rupture have 
been reported in healthy donors when given filgrastim or other myeloid growth factors 
for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization; [ADDRESS_312702] been reported in cancer patients undergoing 
chemotherapy or peripheral blood stem cell mobilization; splenic rupture may have 
contributed to deaths in 2 of these cases. One additional death due to splenic rupture after 
filgrastim therapy was reported to the manufacturer without additional information. 
According to the manufacturer, the reporting rate for splenic rupture with filgrastim is 
less than 1 in 486,000.  
8.4  FLUDARABINE  (Fludara, Berlex Laboratories)  
8.4.[ADDRESS_312703] the pH to 7–8.5. 
Fludarabine will be diluted in 100 to 125ml of either 5% dextrose in water or 0.9% 
sodium chloride, and infused IV over [ADDRESS_312704] be taken to assure the 
sterility of the prepared solution; for this reason, reconstituted FLUDARA IV should be 
used or discarded within 8 hours.  
8.4.4 8.4.4 Administration - Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for 
particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.   
8.4.5  Toxicities – Fludarabine toxicities include myelosuppression (dose limiting toxicity), 
fever, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, anorexia, edema, 
skin rashes, myalgia, headache, agitation, hearing loss, transient epi[INVESTIGATOR_257358], auto-immune hemolytic anemia, auto-immune thrombocytopenia, 
paresthesias, peripheral neuropathy, renal, and pulmonary toxicity (intersititial 
pneumonitis).  Severe fatal CNS toxicity presenting with loss of vision and progressive 
deterioration of mental status were encountered almost exclusively after very high doses 
of fludarabine monophosphate.  Such toxicity has only rarely been demonstrated at the 
25-30 mg/m2
/day dosage of fludarabine. Very rarely described complications include 
transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 
and liver failure. Tumor lysis syndrome following fludarabine administration has been 
observed, especially in patients with advanced bulky malignant disease. Opportunistic 
infections (protozoan, viral, fungal, and bacterial) have been observed postfludarabine, 
especially in heavily pre-treated individuals, and in individuals receiving fludarabine 
combined with other agents.  
8.5 PREDNISONE  
8.5.1 Supply – Prednisone will be purchased by [CONTACT_257452]. Prednisone is commercially available as tablets, in strengths of 
1, 2.5, 5, 20, and [ADDRESS_312705] labeling bears the manufacturer's expi[INVESTIGATOR_22622].  
8.5.3 Administration - Prednisone will be administered at a maximum dose of 1 mg/kg/day or 
at a maximum total daily dose of [ADDRESS_312706]-transplant 
tapering guidelines (appendix). In patients unable to tolerate oral medication, 
methylprednisolone can be substituted at an equivalent dosage, diluted in a small volume 
(e.g. 25-50ml) of 5% dextrose in water or 0.9% sodium chloride and infused over 15 
minutes. To reduce gastrointestinal side effects, prednisone should be taken with food.  
8.5.4 Toxicities -Prednisone frequently causes gastritis, immunosuppression, muscle wasting, 
fluid retention, and hyperglycemia.  
8.6 RITUXIMAB (Rituxan)
8.6.1 Supply – Rituximab will be obtained commercially and is supplied as a 10 mg/ml sterile, 
preservative-free solution for injection, in vials of 100 mg and 500 mg.  
8.6.2 Preparation – The desired dose will be diluted to a final concentration of 1 to 4 mg/mL in 
either 0.9% Sodium Chloride or D5W.  
8.6.3  Storage and Stability – Rituximab vials should be stored at 2–8°C (36–46°F) and should 
be protected from direct sunlight.  
8.6.4 Administration – First Infusion: The rituximab solution for infusion should be 
administered intravenously at an initial rate of 50 mg/hr. Rituximab should not be mixed 
or diluted with other drugs.  If hypersensitivity or infusion reactions do not occur, 
escalate the infusion rate in 50 mg/hr increments every 30 minutes, to a maximum of 400 
mg/hr. If hypersensitivity (non-IgE-mediated) or an infusion reaction develops, the 
infusion should be temporarily slowed or interrupted. The infusion can continue at one-
half the previous rate upon improvement of patient symptoms. If the first infusion is tolerated well, subsequent infusions can begin at a rate of 100 mg/hr and will be 
increased by 100 mg/hr increments at 30-minute intervals.  However, if the first infusion 
is not tolerated well, then the guidelines for the initial infusion should be followed for 
subsequent administration. Premedication will routinely be administered 30 to 60 minutes 
prior to the beginning of each rituximab infusion, consisting of acetaminophen 650 mg 
PO and diphenhydramine 50 mg IV.  
8.6.5 Toxicities – The most serious adverse reactions caused by [CONTACT_257453], tumor lysis syndrome, mucocutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, 
cardiac arrhythmias and angina, and renal failure.  
Page 64 of 115 
 a) Fatal and Severe Infusion Reactions:  Deaths within [ADDRESS_312707] been 
reported. Approximately 80% of fatal infusion reactions occurred in association with the first 
infusion.  Severe reactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_27803] [ADDRESS_312708] severe manifestations and sequelae include pulmonary infiltrates, acute 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation, and cardiogenic 
shock.  In the reported cases, the following factors were more frequently associated with fatal 
outcomes: female gender, pulmonary infiltrates, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia or mantle 
cell lymphoma.  Management of severe infusion reactions:  The rituximab infusion should be 
interrupted for severe reactions and supportive care measures instituted as medically indicated 
(e.g., intravenous fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, bronchodilators, diphenhydramine, and 
acetaminophen).  In most cases, the infusion can be resumed at a 50% reduction in rate (e.g., 
from 100 mg/hr to 50 mg/hr) when symptoms have completely resolved. Patients requiring close 
monitoring during first and all subsequent infusions include those with pre-existing cardiac and 
pulmonary conditions, those with prior clinically significant cardiopulmonary adverse events and 
those with high numbers of circulating malignant cells (= 25,000/mm3
) with or without evidence 
of high tumor burden.  
b) Severe Mucocutaneous Reactions: Mucocutaneous reactions, some with fatal outcome, have 
been reported in patients treated with rituximab.  These reports include paraneoplastic 
pemphigus (an uncommon disorder which is a manifestation of the patient’s underlying 
malignancy), Stevens-Johnson syndrome, lichenoid dermatitis, vesiculobullous dermatitis, and 
toxic epi[INVESTIGATOR_194].  The onset of the reaction in the reported cases has varied from 1 to 
13 weeks following rituximab exposure. Patients experiencing a severe mucocutaneous reaction 
should not receive any further infusions and seek prompt medical evaluation.  Skin biopsy may 
help to distinguish among different mucocutaneous reactions and guide subsequent treatment. 
The safety of readministration of RITUXAN to patients with any of these mucocutaneous 
reactions has not been determined.  
c) Infusion reactions and lymphopenia are the most commonly occurring adverse reactions. Mild 
to moderate infusion reactions consisting of fever and chills/rigors occur in the majority of 
patients during the first rituximab infusion.  Other frequent infusion reaction symptoms included 
nausea, pruritus, angioedema, asthenia, hypotension, headache, bronchospasm, throat irritation, 
rhinitis, urticaria, rash, vomiting, myalgia, dizziness, and hypertension.  These reactions 
generally occur within [ADDRESS_312709] infusion, and resolved with 
slowing or interruption of the rituximab infusion and with supportive care (diphenhydramine, 
acetaminophen, IV saline, and vasopressors).  In an analysis of data from 356 patients with 
relapsed or refractory, low-grade NHL who received 4 (N = 319) or 8 (N = 37) weekly infusions 
of rituximab, the incidence of infusion reactions was highest during the first infusion (77%) and 
Page 65 of 115 
 decreased with each subsequent infusion (30% with fourth infusion and 14% with eighth 
infusion).

diphenhydramine HCl injection may be diluted and given over 10-15 minutes (see 
Preparation).  
8.7.5 Toxicities – Sedation, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], dizziness, disturbed coordination, epi[INVESTIGATOR_22624], 
thickening of bronchial secretions. Diphenhydramine can provide additive effects with 
alcohol or other CNS depressants. Diphenhydramine can cause anticholinergic side 
effects (e.g. dry mouth, fixed or dilated pupi[INVESTIGATOR_8324], flushing, urinary retention). 
Diphenhydramine should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial 
asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or 
hypertension.

8.9.4 Administration – Oral.  
8.9.5 Toxicities – Nausea and/or vomiting, headache, dizziness, abdominal pain, 
dysmenorrhea, arthralgia, acute hypersensitivity reactions, elevations in liver enzyme 
laboratory values (e.g. AST).  Renal failure and CNS symptoms have been reported in 
patients with renal impairment who received valacyclovir or acyclovir at greater than the 
recommended dose. Dose reduction is recommended in this patient population (refer to 
the manufacturer's labeling for dose adjustment guidelines).  
8.10 CASPOFUNGIN (Cancidas®
)
8.10.1  Supply: Commercially available.  
8.10.[ADDRESS_312710] description: Caspofungin is available in 70mg and 50mg single-use lyophilized 
vials that require reconstitution with appropriate diluent and final dilution prior to 
administration.     
8.10.3  Preparation: For reconstitution, aseptically add 10.5ml of an appropriate diluent (see 
manufacturer’s package insert for suggested diluents) to either the 70mg or 50mg 
lyophilized vial. Then aseptically transfer 10ml of the reconstituted caspofungin to an IV 
bag (or bottle) containing 250ml of 0.9% sodium chloride injection or another suitable 
parenteral solution (see manufacturer’s package insert for suggested solutions). NOTE: 
DO NOT USE DILUENTS CONTAINING DEXTROSE AS CASPOFUNGIN IS NOT 
STABLE IN DILUENTS CONTAINING DEXTROSE. In fluid restricted patients 
receiving the 50mg dose, a volume of 100ml (instead of 250ml) of an appropriate 
parenteral solution can be utilized.  
8.10.4  Storage and Stability: The lyophilized vials should be stored refrigerated at 2o
 to 8o
 C 
(36o
 to 46o
 F). Reconstituted caspofungin may be stored at <  25o
C (< 77o
F) for one hour 
Page [ADDRESS_312711] (final patient 
infusion solution) in the IV bag or bottle should be stored at <  25o
 C (<  77o
F) for 24 
hours or at 2o
 to 8o
C (36o
 to 46o
 F) for 48 hours.  
8.10.5  Route of administration:  Parenteral. Parenteral doses should be administered by [CONTACT_257456].  
8.10.6  Toxicities:  
Fever, nausea, vomiting, flushing, infused-vein complications (e.g. phlebitis), and headache have 
generally been reported in clinical trials at an incidence >  2%. Possible histamine-mediated 
symptoms have been reported including isolated reports of rash, facial swelling, pruritis, sensation of warmth, or bronchospasm. Anaphylaxis has been reported during administration of 
caspofungin.  In post marketing experience, rare cases of clinically significant hepatic 
dysfunction has been reported. Elevations in liver transaminases (AST, ALT), total serum 
bilirubin, and serum alkaline phosphatase have been reported in clinical trials at an incidence 
usually >
 2%. Concomitant use of caspofungin with cyclosporine has been associated with a 
higher risk of liver tranasaminase elevations in healthy subject volunteers and concomitant use is 
not recommended by [CONTACT_3455].  
8.11 TRIMETHOPRIM/SULFAMETHOXAZOLE (TMP/SMX, Cotrimoxazole, Bactrim, 
Septra)
8.11.1  Supply – Commercially available as a single strength tablets containing trimethoprim 
80mg and sulfamethoxazole 400mg and a double strength (DS) tablet containing 
trimethoprim 160mg and sulfamethoxaole 800mg. It is also available in a oral suspension 
at a concentration of 40mg of trimethoprim and 200mg sulfamethoxazole per 5ml. 
Parenteral TMP/SMX is available in a solution for injection at a concentration of 80mg of 
trimethoprim and 400mg of sulfamethoxazole per 5ml.  
8.11.2  Preparation – For parenteral administration, the commercial solution for injection must 
be diluted prior to administration. It is recommended that each 5ml of the solution for injection be diluted with 100-125 ml or, if fluid restriction is required, in 75ml of 
dextrose 5% in water.  Normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride) may be substituted as a 
diluent but the resulting solutions have reduced stability. Consult with pharmacy for 
questions regarding diluent, volume, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516].  
8.11.3 Storage and Stability – Oral tablets and oral suspension should be stored at 15o
 to 30o
C 
(59o
 to 86o
F) in a dry place and protected from light. TMP/SMX for injection should be 
stored at room temperature between 15o
 to 30o
C (59o
 to 86o
F) and should not be 
Page 69 of 115 
 refrigerated. Stability of intravenous doses after final dilution is dependent on 
concentration and diluent. Consult with pharmacy for questions regarding stability and 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_22626].  
8.11.4 . Administration – Oral and parenteral.  Parenteral doses should be administered by [CONTACT_257457] 60 to 90 minutes.  
8.11.5 Toxicities – The most common adverse effects from TMP/SMX are gastrointestinal 
disturbances (nausea, vomiting, anorexia) and allergic skin reactions (such as rash and 
urticaria). Fatalities associated with the administration of sulfonamides, although rare, 
have occurred due to severe reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_194], fulminant hepatic necrosis, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and 
other blood dyscrasias.  For TMP/SMX injection, local reaction, pain and slight 
irritationon IV administration are infrequent. Thrombophlebitis has rarely been observed.  
8.12 BAXTER ISOLEX 300i Stem Cell Collection System, version 2.5
8.12.1 Availability - The Isolex 300i Stem Cell Separation System, version 2.5, is an automated 
cell separation system based on immunomagnetic methods to purify CD34+ 
hematopoietic progenitor cells.  It is manufactured by [CONTACT_257458]; however, use of this system in this protocol is considered 
an “off label” use. CD34+ cell selection is performed according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions and the DTM standard operating procedure based on those instructions.  
8.12.2 Preparation and Administration – A leukaphere sis concentrate of mobilized peripheral 
blood stem cells is incubated with human IVIgG, filtered through a standard blood 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_257360], and attached to the disposable set of the Isolex system. Using the Isolex 
closed system, the cells are washed to remove platelets and plasma, and concentrated for 
incubation with a murine anti-human CD34 monoclonal antibody. After washing, the sensitized cells are rosetted with paramagnetic microspheres coated with sheep anti-
murine antibody.  The rosetted cells are separated from the remaining cells by [CONTACT_257459].  A release agent is added to release the CD34+ cells from the 
paramagnetic microspheres coated with sheep anti-murine antibody.  The released 
CD34+ cells are washed, concentrated, and transferred to a plastic bag for infusion or 
cryopreservation.  
8.12.3 Toxicities – There are no significant toxicities associated with the infusion of autologous 
CD34+ cells that have been purified by [CONTACT_257460].  The cells will be 
cryopreserved and theoretically there may be adverse effects associated with the use of 
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as a cryoprotectant such as hives, flushing, chest tightness, or 
cardiovascular instability. However, these effects are unlikely to occur or would be

 relatively minor because the dose of DMSO is very low with elected CD34+ cells. The 
stem cell product will be additionally infused after premedication with diphenhydramine 
(Benadryl) 25-50 mg p.o. or i.v.

FDG-PET
8.13.1 Supply  
 Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an investigational new drug approved by [CONTACT_257461] a limited number of patients.  The current holder of this IND#[ADDRESS_312712]. Peter 
Herscovitch, Chief, PET Department. The FDG is produced as outlined in the IND. FDG is an analog of glucose labeled with F-18 (half-life is109 minutes). The FDG is taken up by [CONTACT_257462].  Once intracellular and  phosphorylated, it is 
not subject to the breakdown by [CONTACT_257463].    
8.13.2 Preparation  
The FDG in this protocol will be provided by [CONTACT_257464], CC, NIH or from a 
commercially available source in compliance with the FDG IND.  The formulations will be 
prepared on the day of use and injected within 9 hours of formulation. The FDG is typi[INVESTIGATOR_257361] a specific activity of > 1 Ci/mmol.  Radionuclide purity is analyzed periodically and 
to date no radionuclide impurities have been detected.  Preparation  
The FDG for human use is in sterile isotonic phosphate buffer and is passed over terminal 
millipore filter (0.22μ ). It has high specific activity and is isomerically pure. A sample of each 
FDG preparation will be tested for pyrogenicity by [CONTACT_257465]; sterility and radiochemical purity by [CONTACT_257466]. Quality control will be performed as outlined in the IND. Alternatively the FDG will 
be purchased from a commercial vendor who provides FDG for clinical use.  
8.13.[ADDRESS_312713] is in liquid form and will be administered intravenously.  
8.13.4 Dosimetry  
FDG dosimetry has been calculated using methodology of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose 
(MIRD) Committee of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. The cumulative radiation dosimetries 
with bladder voiding 1.5 hours after injection (for a total of 15 mCi) are summarized in the RSC 
form 88-23(A).  All radioactive drugs will be administered under the supervision of an 
authorized user. The dosimetry for FDG and transmission scans performed under this protocol is 
given in the NIH 88-[ADDRESS_312714] (By 
[CONTACT_257467])  
SLE-prone individuals may have an abnormality in the generation and/or    maintenance of their 
functional repertoire of B cells expressing specific Ig  genes and may have been subjected to 
conditions that bias specific  immunoglobulin variable region usage, thereby [CONTACT_257468] [113]. Intrinsic B cell over-reactivity may provide the drive for 
pathogenic autoAb formation by [CONTACT_257469]. 
AutoHSCT of  SLE patients will determine whether deleting a large percentage of memory B-
cells and effector plasma cells and replacing them with autologous stem cell-derived naïve cells 
in a non-inflamed environment will lead to long  lasting remission in systemic autoimmune 
disease. The goal of this research is to examine the extent of depletion of  memory B-cells and 
effector plasma cells as a result of the conditioning  regimen and the nature of the surviving cells 
and the cells reconstituted    from the autologous stem cells and to relate these parameters to the 
extent of clinical response and the length and quality of remission.  
The human B cell repertoire is generated following differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic 
stem cells in the bone marrow to immature B cells that migrate through the blood to finish their 
differentiation to mature B cells in the spleen. The techniques that can be used to monitor the 
nature and completeness of B cell depletion before transplantation as well as reconstitution of B 
cell subsets include multiparameter flow cytometry, single cell PCR of sorted B cell populations 
for Ig rearrangement, repertoire and mutational analysis, as well as microarray and the proteomic 
technique immunoaffinity capi[INVESTIGATOR_257362] (ICE) for analysis of genes and proteins that 
are not able to be detected by [CONTACT_257470].  
A-2. Reconstitution of regulatory and effector T cell populations
following autologous HSCT in systemic lupus (By [CONTACT_257471])
Page [ADDRESS_312715] been associated with a normalization of T cell populations, repertoire and 
function in a few patients studied [114]. Certainly the depletion of activated T cells associated 
with the disease process is a key element in remission. Recovery of naïve T cell populations 
through a renewal of thymopoiesis post transplant would also contribute to the recovery of a 
broad T cell receptor repertoire. T cell regeneration will be evaluated by [CONTACT_257472] 
T cell receptor repertoire and subsets of T cells by [CONTACT_257473]. The role of thymus 
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_257474].  
Special emphasis will be placed on studies of regulatory T lymphocytes (some of these studies 
will be done in [CONTACT_257508]’s laboratory). Little is known of the role of TR in the pathogenesis of 
systemic autoimmune disorders in man. The complete lack of TR in the scurfy  mouse results in 
an aggressive lethal autoimmune disorder that can be corrected by [CONTACT_257475]4+CD25+ TR cells [115]. On the other hand, depletion of TR by [CONTACT_257476]-prone (SWR x NZB)F1 mice increased levels of autoantibodies and organ specific 
autoimmunity, but also shifted the immunoglobulin isotype of the predominant autoantibodies 
and reduced glomerulonephritis [116]. Some of the immunological abnormalities present could 
be consistent with a reduction in TR, such as the common finding of an inability to make TGF ȕ, 
a key cytokine in generation and function of TR. We have recently shown that levels of CD4+CD25+ TR cells are abnormal in active lupus patients in contrast to those with inactive 
lupus [117]. Furthermore, the TR cells in lupus patients lack suppressive activity in vitro.  
One potential explanation for durable remission with auto-HSCT is the recovery of regulatory T 
cell populations. Immune reconstitution studies post transplant have focused on expansion of 
residual memory cells and generation of new naïve T cells. The ability of the adult thymus to 
reconstitute TR populations following transplant has never been examined. The severe reduction 
in lymphocyte populations produced by [CONTACT_257477]34 selected graft should provide optimal conditions for assessing the recovery of TR cells.  
We will assess the levels of Tr cells in at the pretreatment time point and  establish a time course 
of recovery of TR cells in the peripheral blood by [CONTACT_257478], 
functional analysis and quantitative  RT-PCR.  
 A-3. Feasibility of Th2-cell type differentiation (By [CONTACT_257479])  
As previously referenced, SLE is an autoimmune disease with a complex disease pathogenesis. 
With respect to the role of T cells in SLE, there is considerable debate whether the Th1/Th2 
paradigm of T cell cytokine biology applies to this disease. As such, we have generated the 
Page [ADDRESS_312716] inflammatory disorders, Th1-type immunity plays a role in SLE 
pathogenesis, and that Th2-type immunity present in SLE patients may represent an unsuccessful 
attempt at immune auto-regulation. Significantly, recent murine data would lend support to this 
hypothesis [118]. This biology would be analogous to that of GVHD, which is initiated by [CONTACT_78443]1-
type cells, yet after disease establishment, both Th1- and Th2-type patterns of T cells can 
contribute to disease pathogenesis.  However, in the allogeneic transplant setting, if Th2-type 
cells are predominant at initiation of the transplant, the initial Th1-type response is abrogated, 
and acute GVHD is prevented. By [CONTACT_257480], one would predict that in the 
setting of immune ablation and autologous transplantation for the therapy of SLE, that re-
establishment of an anti-inflammatory immune response that is devoid of Th1-type elements and 
enriched for Th2-type elements might prevent the re-development of an SLE autoimmune 
predisposition. Given this possibility, using established methods of T cell expansion we have 
developed, we will evaluate the feasibility of whether CD4+
 T cells from SLE patients (at the 
time of study entry) can be induced into a state of Th2-type differentiation. In the event that this 
is possible, such an autologous Th2-type product might be utilized in future studies to promote 
the reconstituting immune system to a Th2 phenotype after transplantation for SLE. 40 ml of 
peripheral blood will be harvested from SLE patients at the time of study entry. CD4+
 T cells 
will be enriched by [CONTACT_257481], and an initial CD4 cell cytokine phenotype will be 
determined by [CONTACT_257482]. Such CD4 cells will then be 
expanded under in vitro culture conditions in an attempt to polarize towards Th1- or Th2-
phenotypes.  In addition to this Th2 cell therapy feasibility evaluation, post-autoHSCT time 
points will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_26313]. These evaluations will be aimed at 
determining whether autologous transplantation resulted in a shift in the capacity of patient CD4 
cells to develop towards Th1 or Th2 phenotypes.      
B.Cytogenetics
(By [CONTACT_257483])  
A relatively rare but serious potential complication of autoHSCT is the  development of 
secondary, therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia 
(t-AML). Although documented most extensively inpatients transplanted for non-Hodgkin's 
lymphomas, t-MDS and t-AML have alsobeen reported following autoHSCT for non-
hematologic solid tumors and nonmalignant diseases [119] (D. Jayne personal communication). 
Both pretransplantation and transplant-related factors likely play a role in the occurrence of 
secondary malignancy, but the relative contributions of these various factors remain a matter of 
some controversy. Factors that have been implicated include dose, type, and duration of prior 
cytotoxic therapy; total body irradiation; number and source of hematopoietic stem cells infused; 
chemotherapy priming of peripheral blood stem cells; and older age. The preparative regimen for 
patients entered on this study has been carefully chosen to decrease myelotoxicity and optimize 
immunodepletion.  Nonetheless, we anticipate these patients will be at some risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_257363] 74 of 115 
 t-MDS or t-AML due, in part, to previous cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly the alkylating 
agent cyclophosphamide [120], and perhaps to cyclophosphamide and fludarabine in the priming 
and preparative regimens.  Recent studies have shown that small clones of abnormal myeloid 
progenitor cells, not evident by [CONTACT_59549] G-banding, can be detected prior to transplant using 
interphase fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) techniques in patients who go on to develop 
t-MDS or t-AML after transplant [121, 122]. The investigators suggest that pre-transplant FISH 
studies can potentially identify patients at increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_257364], therefore, permit more informed clinical management.To test the hypothesis that 
prospective interphase FISH analyses can detect small clones of abnormal myeloid progenitor 
cells prior to transplant, we propose to perform interphase FISH analyses using a carefully 
chosen panel of probes on bone marrow collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after 
transplant, as well as purified CD34+ stem cells collected for re-infusion on Day 0.  Based upon 
prior studies done in our laboratory and others, we anticipate the most common chromosomal 
abnormalities following alkylating agent chemotherapy will be loss or deletion of the long arms 
of chromosomes 5 and 7 (-5/5q-, -7/7q-).  Other common abnormalities include deletions of band 
13q14, the short arm of chromosome 17, and the long arm of chromosome 20; and trisomy of 
chromosome 8. We will therefore employ a panel of six probes to detect these abnormalities.   
Routine G-banded metaphase chromosome analysis will be performed on all bone marrow 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_257365]-accredited NCI/CCR/LP Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory under the 
direction of [CONTACT_257509]. Processing and analysis will be performed according to 
standardized laboratory protocols. Final reports will be issued to the patients' medical records, 
with copi[INVESTIGATOR_257366]. Pavletic. Interphase FISH analyses will be done on all bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], 
and also on purified CD34+ stem cells. These analyses will also be performed in [CONTACT_257510]'s 
laboratory according to procedures established and quality-controlled for each probe in her 
laboratory.  A panel of six probes purchased from Vysis, Inc. will be applied to each sample 
including LSI EGR1/D5S23, D5S721 Dual Color Probe, LSI D7S486/CEP 7 Dual Color Probe, 
LSI 13 (RB1) 13q14 SpectrumOrange Probe, LSI p53 (17p13.1) SpectrumOrange Probe, LSI 
D20S108 (20q12) SpectrumOrange Probe, and CEP [ADDRESS_312717]. Pavletic only.  
C . F-18 FDG Positron Emission Tomography to Assess the Distribution of Activated 
Lymphocytes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
(By [CONTACT_257484], M.D. Participating investigator: M. Whatley).   
Positron emission tomography (PET) is a physiology-based method of imaging based on the 
uptake and metabolism of radiopharmaceutical by [CONTACT_110040]. PET with FDG is a functional 
imaging technique that provides information about glucose metabolism. FDG has been used 
successfully to image a variety of tumors [123]. FDG accumulation in tissue is by [CONTACT_257485] a variety of infectious and inflammatory 
processes [124, 125]. Uptake in sarcoidosis has been reported and patients with AIDS often have 
hypermetabolic nodes.  Similar findings have been found in our study of patients with AIDS and 
Page 75 of 115 
 high viral loads at the clinical center (protocol 00-I-0109). Furthermore patients with 
autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder (ALPS) who have a defect in apoptosis and who 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_257367] (based on our experience here at NIH (02-I-0308).  
Patients who are receiving G-CSF typi[INVESTIGATOR_257368] a 
marked increase in bone marrow uptake and increase in splenic uptake.  
In patients with active SLE both T and B-lymphocytes express higher levels of activation 
markers compared to inactive patients and effective treatment leads to a decrease in activated 
lymphocytes [84]. The anatomic site of lymphocyte activation is unknown in humans.  
In a recently completed pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we compared the pattern of PET images in lymphoid organs 
between patients with active and inactive disease. There were two important findings of this 
study. First, both active (n=10) and inactive (n=9) lupus patients had increased FDG uptake in 
lymph nodes when compared to healthy volunteers, with no statistical difference between the 
two groups. This suggests that the metabolic and probably immunologic activity of lymphoid 
organs is enhanced, not only in active, but also in clinically quiescent SLE patients. It would be 
of interest to see whether achieving clinical re mission after the autoHSCT results in a more 
normal PET pattern. Second, thymic uptake, was demonstrated in 5/10 active patients compared to 0/[ADDRESS_312718], 3/5 patients with 
thymic uptake were 29 years or older. Thymic uptake was seen in only 1/[ADDRESS_312719], whereas the correlation between thymic uptake, changes in T lymphocyte subsets and 
disease activity will provide important information about the pathogenesis of lupus.

D . Ultrasound surveillance and fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_257369]
(By [INVESTIGATOR_120947] J. Wood, Ziv Neeman and Andrea Abati) For the lymph node specimen research 
sampling patients will undergo a limited superficial ultrasound survey at regular intervals during 
the protocol, including pre-transplantation (not to exceed 6 weeks prior to transplantation), and 6, 
Page 77 of 115 
 12, and 24 months following transplantation. This limited ultrasound will include a survey of 
bilateral axillae, groins (inguinal and femoral nodes), and the neck (cervical chains). Grossly 
abnormal nodes will be measured and recorded on the imaging datasheet ( Appendix K ). The 
largest node in each region (6 regions: left and right neck, groin, and axilla) will be measured in [ADDRESS_312723] location will be recorded in relation to nearby [CONTACT_257488]. Depth below skin surface will be recorded. Note will be made if no nodes 
are visible on ultrasound in a region.  
Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]: 
Fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_257370] 23 or 22 gauge needles 
(like Chiba cutting needle) using standard image guided technique with ultrasound. Clinical

adhered to. Standard laboratory studies will be pe rformed within 7 days of the procedures to 
include platelets and PT/PTT. History and physical will be on chart within 30 days of procedure. 
Research specimen paperwork will be used. Cytology staff will be available at the time of the

Patients will be prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion, and the subcutaneous tissues will 
be anesthetized with 1 – 2 % lidocaine along the chosen pathway. This should render the 
remainder of the procedure relatively pain-free following the mild burning sensation induced by

9.2 Appendix B : Guidelines for prophylaxis of infectious complications in 
lymphodepleting autologous stem cell transplantation for SLE  Note:
The practice guidelines included in this Appendix are based upon the best available clinical and 
circumstantial evidence and may change as additional data become available. Although the 
current protocol is in the autologous transplantation setting, this patient population of lupus 
patients is considered to be at an infection risk that is potentially higher than in a non-
lymphodepleting autologous transplantation protocol, therefore the whole infection prevention philosophy here is to err on the side of safety and at minimum matches the allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation protocol prophylaxis standards.   
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia
PCP prophylaxis will start prior to priming. After finishing leukapheresis and prior to starting the 
conditioning regimen, all patients, except those with lupus nephritis, will complete (as latest by 
[CONTACT_4475] -1) a 7 day course of trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg (TMP/SMX 160/800), 
one tablet PO BID. Lupus nephritis patients will continut the usual 3x/week prophyliactic 
schedule until day -1. The treatment will resume post transplant when ANC is >500/ μL and 
unsupported platelets >50,000/mm3
 at one tablet a day dosing three days per week (e.g., on each 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday). This will continue for [ADDRESS_312726] transplant and until 
CD4 count >200/μL and prednisone dose <  5 mg/day, whichever comes later.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The alternative regimens for PCP prophylaxis are less effective than TMP/SMX and 
include:  
-Pentamidine inhalation 300 mg every 4 weeks  
-Dapsone PO 100 mg/day  
-Atovaquone PO 1500 mg/day  
9.2.2 Fungal Infections  (including Aspergillus)  
Since majority of patients will be on long-term high doses of steroids, caspofungin usually at 50 
mg i.v./day will be used starting on day [ADDRESS_312727]-transplant ANC is >1000/ μL.  
9.2.3 Viral pathogens  
[IP_ADDRESS] Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV)  
a) All patients will receive valacyclovir 500 mg PO QD for suppression of HSV and VZV 
infection/reactivation.  This prophylaxis will begin when patients start the priming regimen and 
Page 79 of 115 
 continue throughout transplantation. Valacyclovir will continue for 12 months after 
transplantation, until CD4 count >200/μL and prednisone < 5mg/day, whichever comes later. If a 
patient cannot take oral medications, acyclovir 250 mg/m2
 IV q12h will be substituted for 
valacyclovir.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Preemptive Therapy:   Patients with positive pre-transplant 
serologies for CMV will undergo weekly monitoring of CMV antigenemia. 
Antigenemia monitoring will begin at the time of starting priming regimen and continue 
through day +100 or until CD4 count is > 200/ μL. Antigenemia will be assessed if 
clinically indicated independently of the pre-transplant CMV serology status, for example if fever of unknown origin, decreasing counts or pulmonary symptoms occur. 
If a patient has an ANC < 1000/μL or the specimen is obtained from a long distance 
CMV monitoring will be performed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) instead of 
antigenemia. If antigenemia becomes positive in two consecutive samples (expressed as 
the number of positive cells per 400,000 white blood cells) before day +100, then 
patients will be treated with oral valganciclovir, IV ganciclovir, or IV foscarnet according to the following schema:

 9.7 Appendix G: ANAM
The ANAM test will be administered by [CONTACT_257492] a room both quiet and 
confidential. The ANAM test is on a CD-ROM, available on a computer in the clinic. Each 
participant’s results will be stored on the NIAMS’s hard drive and will be labeled only with 
his/her unique identification number that will be assigned at his/her entrance to the study and 
will be kept in the participant’s research chart. Coded data will be exported to a CDROM and 
will be shipped to [CONTACT_257511] at the National Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_257379]. 
The following ANAM subtests will be conducted;  
xSimple reaction time (SRT)  
xSternberg memory (STN)  
xMathematical processing (MTH)  
xMatching to sample (MSP)  
xSpatial processing (SPD)  
xCode substitution (CDD)  
Conventional neurocognitive tests 
The whole test will take approximately [ADDRESS_312736] (memory)  
xRey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test Copy (Visual-Spatial Processing)  
xStroop Color-Word Test (interference) (Complex Attention/Executive Functions)  
xWechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) Digit Symbol Substitution Test 
(Psychomotor Speed)  
xTrail Making Test (Part B) (Complex Attention/Executive Functions)  
xControlled Oral Word Association Test (Language)  
xRey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test Recall (Spatial Memory)  
xGrooved Pegboard (Motor function)  
The whole procedure will take approximately 1.5 hours. Participants will be allowed to drink 
water and to take a break as necessary.  
Self-report instrument for depression  
Depression will be evaluated by [CONTACT_257493] – Second Edition (BDI-II), which 
will be administered to each participant by [CONTACT_257494]. The BDI-II constitutes the latest revision of the original Beck Depression Inventory 
(BDI), an instrument that was extensively used over a long period of time for measuring the 
Page 93 of 115 
 severity of depression. The BDI-II consists of 21 self-administered items that measure affective, 
cognitive, and somatic symptoms of depression. The BDI-II requires approximately 15 minutes 
to complete. Each item evaluates a category according to a scale of four possible responses of 
increasing severity, and the total score ranges from 0 to 63. In analyzing data, we will follow the 
cut score guidelines suggested for patients diagnosed with major depression. Thus, participants 
will be categorized into four levels based on the total scores: minimal (0-13); mild (14-19); 
moderate (20-28); severe (29-63).

9.13 APPENDIX M: Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch Preclinical 
Service Policy for Sample Handling  
9.13.1 Storage/Tracking  
Normal donor and patient blood and tissue samples, collected for the purpose of research under 
IRB approved protocols of the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch, may be archived by [CONTACT_257495]. All data associated with archived clinical research samples is entered into the ETIB Preclinical Service’s Microsoft Excel databases on frozen cells and plasma. These databases are stored on the NCI group drive in the ETIB Preclinical Service folder. Access to this folder is limited to ETIB clinical staff, requiring individual login and password. All staff in the Preclinical Service laboratory have received annually updated NIH/CIT training and maintain standards of computer security.  
The data recorded for each sample includes the patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, 
date drawn, treatment cycle/post transplant time point, cell source (e. g. peripheral blood, lymphapheresis, mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, marrow, pleural fluid) as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics that correlate treatment outcomes and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_257384]/ETIB clinical records. As of January 2007, all newly received samples will receive a unique bar code number, which will be added to the sample Preclinical Service database. Only this bar code will be recorded on the sample vial and the vials will not be traceable back to patients without authorized access to the Preclinical Service database. All non-coded samples previously archived will be stripped of identifiers prior to distribution for any use other than as a primary objective of the protocol under which they were collected.  
Samples are stored in locked freezers at -85°C (sera and plasma) or under liquid nitrogen (cells), 
according to stability requirements.  These freezers are located onsite at the Preclinical Service laboratory (12C216) (-85° freezer) or in ETIB common equipment space (CRC/3-3273). Access to samples from a protocol for research purposes will be by [CONTACT_79923] [INVESTIGATOR_257385]/her submission and IRB approval of the NCI IRB Authorization Form (appended) stipulating whether IRB review is not necessary or IRB approval 
is granted for the pursuit of this new research activity. All researchers are required to sign a form 
(attached) stating that the samples are only to be used for research purposes associated with objectives of the original protocol for which the samples were collected, or (using only unlinked or coded samples) for an IRB approved protocol as stipulated on the IRB Authorization Form, and that any unused samples must be returned to the Preclinical Service laboratory.  
9.13.2 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction  
Once primary research objectives for the protocol are achieved, researchers can request access 
to remaining samples, providing they have both approval of the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_257386] (see attached authorization form from the NCI IRB).  
Page [ADDRESS_312739] be returned to the Preclinical Service laboratory.  
The Preclinical Service staff will report to the Principal Investigators any destroyed samples, if 
samples become unsalvageable because of environmental factors (ex. broken freezer or lack of dry ice in a shippi[INVESTIGATOR_7788]), lost in transit between facilities or misplaced by a researcher. 
The Principal Investigators will annually report this information to the IRB.   
Page 107 of 115 
 9.13.3 ETIB Preclinical Service Form for Requesting Samples  
Please fill in the relevant information and initial and date the form below. Note that all unused 
samples or portions of samples are to be returned to the ETIB Preclinical Service laboratory.

department of the NIH Clinical Center where th ey will be secured and confidentiality will be 
protected under the standard procedures of these departments.   
Serum, plasma, and DNA samples will be stored in locked freezers in Building 10.  All stored 
biological samples and specimens will be coded with a study identification number only. Only NIH investigators associated with this study will have access to the secure database linking the study identification number with individual patients.  Research data and samples may be shared 
with additional investigators in the future.  Any data or samples sent to these investigators will 
be coded and will not include any patient identifying information.  Codes need to be retained to allow the possibility of adding new patient-derived information in the future.   
We do not plan to destroy research-related data or specimens at the completion of the 
protocol, as these data may be useful in the fu ture care of subjects.  The IRB will be notified 
at each annual review of any data or biological specimens lost or destroyed.

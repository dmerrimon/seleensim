 BACKGROUND AND STUDY RATIONALE  
This study will be conducted in full accordance with all applicable University of Pennsylvania Research 
Policies and Procedures and all applicable Federal and state laws and regulations including the use of a 
medical device (i .e., RianCorp LTU -904).

term in nature (usually up to 4 -8 weeks); however, lymphedema is a chronic condition and often worsens 
over time.  Therefore, alternative treatment modalities need to be investigated for effective and long -term 
management of lymphedema and associated late fibrosis in the head and neck cancer (HNC)  population . 
1.1 Background and Relevant Literature  
There has been an increase in the incidence of head and neck cancer (HNC) largely related to the 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_286980] (HPV) associated disease.1,2 HPV- associated HNC occurs in younger 
and middle -aged patients; cure rates in this population are markedly higher compared to other HNC 
groups.3,[ADDRESS_1006520] to assess lymphedema in HNC patients in a systematic manner.7,11 We demonstrated a prevalence 
rate of 75% in HNC survivors.7 We confirmed that lymphedema occurs both externally (e.g., face and neck) 
and internally (e.g., pharynx and larynx).7,[ADDRESS_1006521] on critical functions (e.g., swallowing, speaking, and breathing).13,14 Psychological 
effects (e.g., body image disturbance) were also correlated with lymphedema.13,[ADDRESS_1006522] HNC survivors’ ability to function in both home and work 
environments, resulting in both emotional and financial burden for these individuals, t heir families, and the 
healthcare system.11,[ADDRESS_1006523] of care for treatment of lymphedema is complete decongestive therapy (CDT), 
which consists of 4 main parts: manual lymphatic drainage, compression (bandaging or garments), 
exercise, and skin care. 10,19 -22 These treatments are expensive, time -consuming , and labor -intensive. 
Although CDT is routinely used in clinical settings, no level I evidence is available on the use of CDT for 
the treatment of HNC -related lymphedema.11 In addition, CDT provided by [CONTACT_2111][INVESTIGATOR_736728] -term in nature 
(usually up to 4 -12 weeks); however, lymphedema is a chronic condition and often worsens over time.10,19 
Therefore, alternative treatment modalities need to be investigated for effective and long -term management 
of lymphedema and associated late fibrosis in the HNC population.  
 
Among many alternative treatment options, low -level laser therapy (LLLT) is a promising, noninvasive 
modality for the treatment of lymphedema. LLLT, also named photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), has had 
a place in general medicine for more than 40 years.24 It has been used as a treatment option to stimulate 
wound healing and reduce inflammation, edema, and pain.24 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
accepted it as a treatment approach for breast cancer -related upper extremity lymphedema (BCRL) in 
2006.24 One recent systematic review evaluating 7 randomized clinical trials (RCT) concluded that available 
evidence supports LLLT in the management of BCRL, with clinically meaningful reductions in lymphedema -
related swelling and symptom burden (e.g., pain).25 Compared to other treatment modalities, LLLT is a 
noninvasive modality, repeatable, easily performed in outpatient setting s, and without any known long -term 
side effects. LLLT may be effective in treating chronic lymphedema in the HNC population , as it may reduce 
the generation of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor -alpha, TNF -α) and increase anti -
inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin -10, IL -10).31-33 This is particularly important because many HNC 
survivors develop both lymphedema and late fibrosis.7,15

lymphedema, symptom burden, functional status, and quality of life (QOL) in HNC survivors, through a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], 
randomized, wait -list controlled trial.   
1.[ADDRESS_1006525], Joy Cohn, who has had more than 20 years of experience treating 
individuals with lymphedema.   
1.2.1  Nonclinical Data  
Findings  from nonclinical data  indicate that LLLT  stimulates lymphatic vessels and lymphocytes, as well as 
increases local fluid circulation.34,35  
1.2.2  Clinical Data to Date  
Currently, only case studies  indicate the potential value of  the use of LLLT for treating head and neck 
lymphedema.36,37 No prospective trials are available to evaluate  feasibility,  prophylactic and/or therapeutic 
use of LLLT for lymphedema in HNC patients. However, a large body of evidence is available in supporting 
the safety and efficacy of LLLT for  the management of lymphedema in breast cancer patients. For instance, 
since 1995, the use of LLLT has been investigated in the treatment of breast cancer -related lymphedema 
(BCRL).38 A meta -analysis of 9 studies (7 of them were RCTs) provided evidence that LLLT alone or 
combined with other treatments was able to reduce the arm swelling and pain in women with BCRL.38-[ADDRESS_1006526] cancer 
population: oral mucositis, radiodermatitis, chemotherapy -induced peripheral neuropathy, and 
osteonecrosis of the jaw.[ADDRESS_1006527] range of side effects (e.g., lymphedema/fibrosis) of 
chemo -radiation therapy in patients with HNC.47,[ADDRESS_1006528] prospective trial in this area , that demonstrated it is feasible and acceptable to use LLLT for treating 
chronic lymphedema in HNC survivors.   
1.2.3  Clinical Studies in Children  
Not applicable . 
1.3 Dose Rationale (if applicable)  
We propose that participants will  receive LLLT twice a week for 6 weeks (12 sessions). This regimen was 
developed based on the evidence from  the literature  as well as the data from  our pi[INVESTIGATOR_86234] . 
2 Study Objectives  
The major objective  of this proposed research is to determine preliminary efficacy of the use of LLLT for 
HNC survivors with  chronic  lymphedema.  
2.1 Primary Objective  
• To determine the impact of LLLT, as compared to a wait -list control, on changes in severity of 
lymphedema.

 2.2 Secondary Objective  
• To determine the impact of LLLT, as compared to a wait -list control, on lymphedema -related 
symptom burden (e.g., tightness), functional impairments (e.g., range of motion in the jaw 
and neck) and QOL .  
2.3 Exploratory Objective  
• To explore the relationships among LLLT, the inflammatory biomarkers (e.g., TNF-α, TGF -β, 
IL-6), and the severity of lymphedema.   
[ADDRESS_1006529] controlled  trial to compare: Group 1 (laser therapy) and Group 2 
(wait -list control). Outcome measures include: 1) changes in severity of lymphedema [Primary aim]; 2) 
changes in lymphedema -related symptom burden, functional status, and QOL [Secondary aim]; and 3) the 
relationships among LLLT, the inflammatory biomarkers, and severity of lymphedema [Exploratory aim].  
 
3.1.1  Screening Phase  
We will recruit a minimum of 3-4 participants per month. The volume of HNC patients at Penn’s Clinic is 
sufficient to complete this trial without additional sites. The following recruitment procedures will be used: 
screening at HNC clinics and attendance at Head and Neck tumor board s and case conferences. All direct 
patient recruitment activities will be conducted at the Penn HNC clinics where private rooms are available 
to be used for conducting clinical research projects.   
3.1.2  Allocation to Interventional Group  
After completion of baseline measures, participants will be randomized via a computer -generated, 
permuted block program, conducted by [CONTACT_15957] -I Statistician Chittams , to one of 2 arms: Group 1 (laser therapy) 
and Group 2 (wait -list control).  Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_736745] (unilateral vs. 
bilateral) with a 1:1 allocation, which will allow us to balance potentially important subgroups equally among 
the two groups.  
3.1.3  Study Intervention Phase  and Follow Up Phase   
Group 1 (laser group) : After completion of the baseline measures, Group 1 participants will be scheduled 
for LLLT. The LLLT includes receiving LLLT twice a week for 6 weeks (12 sessions). After completion of 
the 12 -session s of LLLT , participants will be given a) contact [CONTACT_736746] b) a calendar outlining dates for the 4- and [ADDRESS_1006530]-LLLT follow -up data collection.  Group 
1 participants will need to complete 4 study assessment visits . 
 
Group 2 (wait -list control  group) : After completion of the baseline measures, G roup [ADDRESS_1006531]-laser  follow -
up data collection.  Group 2 participants will need to complete 7 study assessment visits .

with participants and be trained to report these to the PI's immediately. Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE v 5.0) will be used to document adverse events of the trial. All of the staff members 
who are involved in this study will be trained by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_736736] v 5.0.  
 
In addition, p articipants in this study will be screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
Participants will be educated regarding signs and symptoms related to adverse events (e.g., sudden 
increase in swelling) requiring urgent or emergent medical care.    
8.[ADDRESS_1006545], the trained staff  will seek information on adverse events by [CONTACT_28812], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148]. Information on all adverse events will be recorded 
immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event module of the case report 
form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should  be 
recorded in t he source document . 
 
All adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_976] [INVESTIGATOR_736737] s Lin/Lukens  (Co-Is), and the Medical 
Monitor , [CONTACT_736757] (see 8.6 Medical Monitoring section) , any contributing factors will be reviewed, 
and strategies to prevent further complications will be developed and implemented. [CONTACT_734610] will meet with  
the study staff monthly to evaluate any other safety concerns. Adverse events will be reported to the Penn 
IRB within the window required by [CONTACT_1201]. If the study staff identify the following unanticipated problems 
related to the research (e.g., infection in the treated area, sudden increa se in swelling), which occur during 
the study, Drs. Deng, Lin/Lukens , and study lymphedema therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] , as well as the Medical Monitor , [CONTACT_736758], will be notified immediately. Patients will be referred and receive appropriate and timely treatment . 
Deng and Lin/Lukens  will determine if participants with adverse event s or any unexpected issues will remain 
on the study based on safety consideration s. Deng and Lin/Lukens  as well as the Medical Monitor , [CONTACT_736758], will evaluate the relationship of each adverse event to the study procedures. Deng , Lin/Lukens , and 
the Medical Monitor , [CONTACT_736759], will make  the determination of the relationship of the adverse event to the 
study procedures (e.g., definitely related, probably related, possibl y related, unlikely or unrelated).  
 
The clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been 
determined that the study intervention or participation is not the cause.  Serious adverse events that are 
still ongoing at the end of the study period  will be followed up to determine the final outcome.  Any serious 
adverse event that occurs after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the study 
intervention or study participation will be recorded and reported immediately.

10 Ethical Considerations  
Although thi s is an interventional study, fo reseeab le physical, psychological, financ ial, legal, or other risks 
from study participation are believed to be minimal. 
10.1 Risks  
1) Physical: LLLT will be used in the trial. No physical risks (e.g., worsening lymphedema or fibrosis)  from 
using LLLT in individuals with breast cancer -related lymphedema have been  reported in the known 
current literature review. No physical risks from using LLLT were reported in the c ase studies conducted 
in individuals with head and neck lymphedema. Subjects will not have any burning sensation, warmth, 
or any other uncomfortable sensations on the sites treated with low-level laser.  Currently, there is no 
safety data in the population under study. Thus, we will inform participants of reporting any physical 
damages they have during the course of the study.  
2) Psychological: There are no known psychological risks associated with LLLT.  
3) Financ ial: The LLLT  will be provided free of charge. Patients may incur gas expenses  when driving to 
the Penn C linic.  
4) Le gal: There are no known legal risks.  
5) Other: There may be risks that are unknown at this time. 
Our planned  protections from the above -noted risks are as follows:  
1) Physical: Currently, there are no known potential physical risks for being in this study.  Given no safety 
data available in the population under study, the research may involve risks that are currently 
unforeseeable.  To minimize any potential physical risks, the following will be done: a) P articipants will be 
given the study contact [CONTACT_736753] ; b) if study staff identify any unanticipated 
problems, Deng, Lin/Lukens , and study lymphedema therap ists, as well as the Medical Monitor , [CONTACT_736759] , 
will be notified immediately.  Appropriate evaluation and timely therapy will be provided to the participant . 
Deng, Lin/Lukens , study lymphedema therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] , and the Medical Monitor  will determine if participants with 
significant unanticipated issues will remain on the study based on safety consideration; and c) if anyone 
experience s an adverse event directly related to the study activities that are done for research, they can get 
reasonable, immediate, and necessary medical care for their adverse events  at Penn.  
2) Psychological: If study s taff identifies participants with significant distress during the course of the 
study, PI [INVESTIGATOR_736733] , Co-Is Lin/Lukens , and the Medical Monitor , [CONTACT_736759] , will be notified immediately so that 
appropriate psychological evaluation and referrals will be made. Deng , Lin/Lukens  and the Medical Monitor , 
[CONTACT_736759] , will determine if participants with significant psychological issues will remain on study.   
3) Financ ial: The LLLT  will be provided free of charge. Patients will incur the expense  of gas when driving 
to the Penn Clinic  during study follow -up visits. To offset travel/gas cost, participants will be provided a 
financial token of appreciation for participation in the study.  
4) Legal: There are no known legal risks.  
5) Other: Should the team beco me aware of any additional risks, pa rticipants will be notified, and informed 
consen ts will be modified to reflect the new information. 
10.2 Benefits  
Potential benefits to the individual: Although the potential direct benefit to study participants is unknown, 
individual participants will be exposed to and have increased knowledge about lymphedema and fibrosis . 
Participants may have positive feelings about participation in a research program that may benefit others.  
Low-Level Laser Therapy in Head and Neck Chronic Lymphedema  Page 13

Potential benefits to humankind: Possible future benefits for HNC survivors are potentially substantial. If we 
are able to demonstrate that LLLT  is safe, feasible , and effective in HNC patients, we will be a dding to the 
armamentarium of an alternative intervention that can diminish the progression  of lymphedema and fibrosis , 
decrease symptom burden, increase function, and improve overall quality of life.  
10.3 Risk Benefit Assessment  
Currently, there are no known potential risks for being in this study. Given no safety data available in 
the population under study, the research may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable.  
As noted above, potential ben efits are reasonab le and substantial. Thus, based on the risk benefit 
assessment, it appe ars to be acce ptable for this research within human subjects. 
10.4 Informed Consent Process / HIPAA Authorization  
Once the study is approved by [CONTACT_736754], the trained study team members will meet with 
potential participants who  express interest in the study. Potential study participants will be provided one 
copy of the informed consent to read and review. Study team members will review the study proced ures 
and activities with potential pa rticipants. The informed consent  document will be written in lay language and 
cover all study activities participants will engage in during the study, define the length of time the study will 
be conduc ted, and  provide instructions for pa rticipant withdrawal from the study shou ld they choose  to do 
so. Study staff will review and, when necessa ry, read the informed conse nt document to potential 
participants. Participants will be given ample time and opportunity to ask  questions, and  all questions will 
be answered by [CONTACT_464]. The cons ent process  will take place in a private location, with a closed  door. 
Once participants have had an opportunity to ask questions, those questions have been  answered, and 
they indicate an interest in participation, they will be asked to sign a written informed consent docu ment as 
the study staff witnesses . In addition, the participant will be given a  copy of informed consent signed by [CONTACT_736755]. We will not seek waivers of the informed consent p roces s.

12 Benchmarks for Study /Publication Plan  
The key benchmark for success of this study is to complete recruitment goals and data collection as 
scheduled. The information gathered from this study will provide important data for designing a future RCT 
that tests the efficacy of LLLT on lymphedema in the HNC survivors. Additional b enchmarks for success 
include: 1) dissemination of preliminary findings at professional conferences and 2) submission of articles 
to peer -reviewed journals .

2. SYNOPSIS  
Title of Study:  
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo- Controlled Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of NBI -
[ZIP_CODE] in Adult Subjects with Tourette Syndrome 
Study centers:  
Approximately 40 study centers in the [LOCATION_002]. 
Objectives:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of 2 active doses of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] (40 mg  and 80 mg) administered once daily 
in adult subjects with Tourette syndrome (TS). 
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated daily doses of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] in adult subjects with TS. 
• To evaluate plasma exposure of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and its met abolite, NBI-[ZIP_CODE], following repeated daily 
doses of NBI -[ZIP_CODE]. 
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, pla cebo -controlled, parallel group study in a 
total of 90 male and female subjects, 18 to 64 years of age, with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 4th or 5th Editions (DSM- IV or -V) diagnosis of TS.   
After providing informed consent, subjects will be screened to deter mine eligibility within 21 days 
(Days -21 to -1) before the start of study drug dosing on Day 1.  On Day - 1 (baseline), eligible subjects 
will return to the study center for collection of baseline safety and efficacy assessments and collection of 
a blood sample for subsequent determination of their cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolizer status.  Subjects who continue to be eligible for the study will then be randomized (1:1:1) to placebo or 
1 of 2 active doses of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] (40  mg or 80 mg ).  Study drug will be administered in a double-
dummy fashion throughout the 8-week double-blind treatment period.  Beginning on Day 1, study drug 
will be administered at home once daily in the morning with a standard breakfast through Week 8.  The 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg dose will be titrated in a blinded fashion (subjects will receive [ADDRESS_389356] 
week followed by 80 mg  for the remainder of the 8 -week treatment period ). 
At any time, if the subject is unable to tolerate their current dose, the investigator may decrease t he 
subject’s dose.  The investigator is allowed to reduce the subject’s dose only one time during the study.  Subjects who have had a dose reduction and are unable to tolerate their new dose will be discontinued 
from the study.  To maintain the study blind, subjects receiving [ADDRESS_389357] a dose 
reduction will continue to receive their current dose an d subjects receiving 80  mg will be reduced to 
40 mg.  
During the double -blind treatment period, subjects will return to the study center at 2- week intervals 
(end of Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) for study assessments and dispensing of study drug (W eeks 2, 4, and 6 
only).  All subjects who have completed the 8- week treatment period will enter a 2 -week follow-up 
period with a follow -up visit at Week  10 (or ear ly termination).   
Efficacy, safety, and study drug exposure will be assessed at scheduled times throughout the study.

Study Population:  
Approximately [ADDRESS_389358] moderate current TS 
symptomatology, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression of Tics  (CGI-Tics) –Severity score of  
≥4 (ie, moderately ill) and a Yale Global Tic Severity  Scale ( YGTSS ), Total Tic Severity Score of at 
least [ADDRESS_389359] s with Tourette  spectrum diagnoses 
(eg, obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD], Attention- Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD], etc) must 
have a stable psychiat ric status . 
Duration of treatment and study participation:  
The expected duration of study participation for each subject is approximately [ADDRESS_389360], dose, and mode of administration: 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] will be supplied as capsules containing 40 mg  of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] (free base).  The NBI-[ADDRESS_389361].    
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] will be administered in a double-dummy fashion.  Subjects randomized to receive 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 40 mg  will receive one 40  mg capsule and one matching placebo capsule.  Subjects 
randomized to receive NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg will receive two 40 mg  capsules (except during the first 7 day s 
prior to dose titration when subjects will receive a 40 mg dose as one 40 mg capsule and one matching 
placebo capsule).  
Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration  
Matching placebo capsules are identical in appearance and will be orally administered in a double-blind, 
double-dummy manner according to randomization on an identical schedule to those receiving NBI-[ZIP_CODE].  The placebo capsules will be taken with a standa rd breakfast.   
Placebo will be administered in a double-dummy fashion.  Subjects randomized to placebo will receive two matching placebo capsules.  
Criteria for evaluation:   Efficacy:  
The following efficacy assessments will be administered at screening, baseline (Day -1), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 
and 8, and at the follow -up visi t (Week  10 or early termination): 
• Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ; primary assessment ) 
• Rush Video- based Tic Rating Scale (RT RS)  
• Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS)  
• Clinical Global Impression of Change-Tourette Syndrome ( CGI-TS)-Improvement  
• Clinical Global Impression of Tics  (CGI-Tics)-Severity  
The CGI-Tics-S everity scale will be used to rate the Investigator’s assessment of the severity of tic 
symptoms at screening and baseline.  Both the CGI -Tics-S everity and CGI-TS-Improvement scales will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_316495] 2, 4, 6, and 8; and at  the follow -up visit  (Week  10 or early 
termination) .

5. INTRODUCTION 
5.1. Background  
Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a movement disorder characterized by [CONTACT_316496] ( APA DSM -IV, 
1994;  APA DSM -V, 2013).  Tics are defined as rapid, non-rhythmic, stereotyped motor 
movements or vocalizations, and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_316486].  Simple tics are brief, meaningless actions (eg, forceful blinking of the eyes or 
grunting) and complex tics are slower, more purposeful behaviors (eg, gyrating or uttering 
phrases; Leckman et al., 1989; Cavanna and Nani, 2013; Shprecher and Kurlan, 2009).  The tics 
follow a waxing and waning course over time, and must be recurrent for a period of more than 
1 year to qualify for diagnosis.  In addition to tic phenomena, TS may also present with a 
constellation of symptoms that are part of a broader “TS spectrum,” which can include obsessive-compulsive behaviors, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and impulsive or 
antisocial behavior ( Chen et al., 2012; Felling and Singer, 2011).  
It has been well established that TS is predominantly a disorder of childhood with a mean or 
median age of onset of approximately 6 years of age ( Leckman et al., 1998; Robertson, 2011; 
Jankovic and Kurlan, 2011; Swain et al., 2007).  Tic symptomatology usually
 becomes the most 
severe ar
ound age [ADDRESS_389366] significa ntly improved (Leckman et al., 1998; 
Kurlan, 2010).  TS symptoms may also occur in adults and  these tic phenomena appear to be a 
re-emergence or an exacerbation of childhood onset TS ( Chouinard and Ford, 2000; Jankovic 
and Kurlan, 2011). 
Persistent tics ca n have a significant impact on patient quality of life and often lead to impaired 
psychosocial functioning.  Some of these problems include social isolation, bullying, physical 
discomfort (with pain or injury), and poor academic and/or work performance ( Roessner et al.,  
2013).  Psychosocial stressors can, in turn, exacerbate tic symptomatology.  
It is under these 
conditions that pharmacological interventions are often considered ( Chen et al., 2012; 
Shprecher & K
urlan, 2009; Roessner et al., 2013).  
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_389367] been proposed to explain the symptomatic features of TS, and 
converging lines of empi[INVESTIGATOR_316487]- basal ganglia circuitry ( Felling and Singer,  2011; 
Pourfar et al., 2011 ).  Functiona l neuroimaging studies have identified a pattern of prefrontal 
cortex hypermetabolism and reduced striatal activity in TS patients ( Baxter and Guze, 1993; 
Braun et al., 1993; Pourfar et al., 2011).  Pharmacotherapeut ic approaches aimed at blocking 
postsynaptic dopamine-2 receptors (eg, haloperidol and pi[INVESTIGATOR_3924]) have demonstrated efficacy 
in reducing TS symptoms.  In this regard, modulation of dopaminergic tone through the 
administration of a Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 ( VMAT2 ) inhibitor, like NBI -[ZIP_CODE], 
may also be an effective treatment option for tic suppression. 
Currently the only approved agent with VMAT2 inhibitory activity is tetrabenazine, a 
dopamine- depleting agent recently approved for the treatment of chorea associated with 
Huntington’s disease.  Use of tetrabenazine for the treatment of a variety of hyperkinetic 
movement disorders has also been described ( Ondo et al, 1999; 
Jankovic and Beach, 1997).  
The benefici
al pharmacologic effects of tetrabenazin e on the targeted hyperkinetic involuntary 
movements have been documented, as well as the adverse effects associated with excessive monoamine depletion, such as sedation, depression, akathisia and parkinsonism.  The 
occurrence of these adverse effects with  tetrabenazine have resulted in the need for 
individualized dosing, dose titration, and management of treatment- related side effects.  
5.2. NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] is an orally active valine ester of a VMAT2 inhibitor ( NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) and is currently 
under development a t NBI for the treatment of neuroleptic -induced Tardive dyskinesia ( TD), 
TS, and other involuntary movement disorders.  Metabolism of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] is characterized by 
[CONTACT_316497] -[ZIP_CODE] to NBI -[ZIP_CODE], and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/[ADDRESS_389368] 
potent and appears to be responsible for the majority of the observed pharmacological activity of VMAT2 inhibition.   
The intravenous and oral NBI-[ZIP_CODE] pharmacokinetics (PK)  has been studied in mice, rats, 
monkeys, dogs, and humans.  In animals, orally administered NBI -[ZIP_CODE] is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_316488] -[ZIP_CODE], such that animals are exposed to both 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and NBI -[ZIP_CODE].  Dose-dependent increases in exposure to both NBI -[ZIP_CODE] and 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] were seen in animal studies.  NBI -[ZIP_CODE] appears to cause little or no CYP enzyme 
inhibition or induction at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.  The elimination of 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] is in part catalyzed by [CONTACT_097]2D6.  Repeat-dose nonclinical toxicology studies 
conducted in mice, rats, and dogs (up to 9 months duration) have revealed no adverse effects at 
doses of 60 mg/kg/day in the mouse, 3 mg/kg/day in the rat, and 15 mg/kg/day in the dog.  
Radiolabeled absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion studies have confirmed that all 
abundant human circulating metabolites were identified as circulating metabolites  in both rat 
and dog providing justification for the use of these species for pi[INVESTIGATOR_11109]-[ZIP_CODE].  Additionally, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and CNS safety 
pharmacology studies have also been conducted, where the no observed adverse effect level 
(NOAEL) was equal to or exceeded the 15  mg/kg level seen in repeat -dose toxicology studies.  
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_389369] on rat fertility at 10 mg /kg/day (NOAEL of 
3 mg/kg/day).  The NOAEL for embryo/fetal deve lopment in rats and rabbits was 15 mg/kg/day 
and 50 mg /kg/day, respectively.  There was no evidence of teratogenicity in the rat or rabbits.  
Finally, NBI-[ZIP_CODE] was negative in in vitro mutagenicity assays (namely, Ames and 
chromosomal aberration) and an in vivo rat micronucleus test. 
Twelve clinical studies with NBI-[ADDRESS_389370] been completed to date; [ADDRESS_389371] evaluated the PK of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
administered as an oral solution or capsule formulation, PK  assessments including serum 
prolactin and cognitive performance,  and safety measures including evaluation of 
cardiovascular risk using triplicate 12- lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and [ADDRESS_389372] included an evaluation of efficacy in the treatment of 
symptoms of TD using the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). 
Clinical PK data indicate that when administered orally under fasted conditions, NBI -[ADDRESS_389373] that coadministration of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] with strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors is expected to 
increase the maxim um plasma concentration (C
max) and area under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve (AUC) of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] by [CONTACT_3450] 2- fold.  A similar approximately 
2-fold increase in NBI -[ZIP_CODE] was observed when NBI -[ZIP_CODE] was given to subjects with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment.  
Results from Phase 2 studies indicated an improvement in the AIMS score after 6 weeks of continuous dosing with either NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg  once daily, continuous dosing at NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
100 mg  once daily for 2 weeks followed by [CONTACT_316498] -[ZIP_CODE] 50 mg  once daily 
for 4 weeks ( NBI-[ZIP_CODE]), or 6 weeks of titrated doses from 25 mg  up to 75 mg  
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] once daily ( NBI-[ZIP_CODE]).  Results from an open- label safety extension with 
dosing out to 12 weeks ( NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) continued to show benefit in subjects continuing on 
with 50 mg  NBI -[ZIP_CODE] daily dosing and also in subjects originally assigned to placebo who 
went on to receive 50 mg  NBI -[ZIP_CODE] for the 6 weeks of open- label treatment period.  Results 
from the 6 -week dose-t itration study ( NBI-[ZIP_CODE]) showed a statistically significant 
reduction in AIMS dyskinesia total score in the NBI -[ZIP_CODE] group compared to placebo.  A 
statistically significant higher responder rate (ie, ≥50% improvement in AIMS dyskinesia total score from baseline) was also observed in the NBI -[ZIP_CODE] group compared with placebo. 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] has been generally well tolerated in single doses up to 300 mg  and in multiple doses 
of up to 100 mg .  Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) consistent with the 
pharmacological effects of monoamine reduction (eg, fatigue, insomnia, nervousness) occurred 
at a lower incidence in the NBI-[ADDRESS_389374] TEAEs were transient and considered mild or moderate in intensity.  Thirteen 
treatment -emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) among [ADDRESS_389375] been no TEAEs associated with hyperprolactinemia.  In general, depression, drug- induced akathisia and 
drug induced parkinsonism did not worsen during treatment with NBI-[ZIP_CODE]. 
5.3. Study and Dose Rationale  
The present study is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel 
fixed -dose study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of 2 doses of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
(40 mg and 80 mg) for the treatment of TS.  M edically stable adult subjects with a diagnosis of 
DSM -IV or -V of TS  will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to self- administer placebo, NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
40 mg , or NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg (approximately n=30 per treatment group) once daily for [ADDRESS_389376] moderate TS as determined by [CONTACT_316499] ( YGTSS ) and the CGI-Tics-Severity scale.  
Clinical data from subjects with the hyperkinetic movement disorder, TD, who were 
administered doses  of 12.5 mg  to 100 mg  per day in Phase 2 trials indicate that NBI-[ZIP_CODE] is 
generally well  tolerated and associated with dose -related effi cacy in this disorder.  
Exposure- response modeling of the Phase 2 data in TD patients indicates that a steady state C max 
of 20 to  40 ng/mL NBI -[ADDRESS_389377] ed minor incremental benefit , but at an increased risk of adverse 
events ( AEs).

6. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The objectives of this clinical study are as follows: 
• To evaluate the efficacy of 2 active doses of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] (40 mg  and 80 mg) administered 
once daily in adult subjects with TS.  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated daily doses of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] in adult subjects 
with TS.  
• To evaluate plasma exposure of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and its metabolite, NBI -[ZIP_CODE], following 
repeated daily doses of NBI-[ZIP_CODE]. 
7. OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN 
7.1. Study Design  
This is a P hase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group 
study in a total of 90 male and female subjects, 18 to 64 years of age, with a Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th or 5th Editions (DSM -IV or V) diagnosis of TS.   
After providing informed consent, subjects will be screened to determine eligibility within 
21 days (Days -21 to -1) before the start of study drug dosing on Day 1.  Subjects may also be 
asked to sign an optiona l release form to allow their Rush Video -based Tic Rating Scale 
(RTRS) video recordings to be used for educational purposes.   
On Day -1 (baseline), eligible subjects will return to the study center for collection of baseline 
safety and efficacy assessment s and collection of a blood sample for subsequent determination 
of their cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) metabolizer status.  Subjects who continue to be 
eligible for the study will then be randomized (1:1:1) to placebo or 1 of 2 active doses of 
NBI-[ZIP_CODE] (40  mg or 80 mg).  A [ADDRESS_389378] through Week 8.  The NBI-[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg dose will be titrated in a 
blinded fashion (subjects will receive [ADDRESS_389379] week followed by 80 mg ). 
At any time, if the subject is unable to tolerate their current dose, the investigator may decrease the subject’s dose.  The investigator is allowed to reduce the subject’s dose only one time during the study.  Subjects who have had a dose reduction and are unable to tolerate the new  
dose will be discontinued from the study.  To maintain the study blind, subjects receiving [ADDRESS_389380] a dose reduction will continue to receive their current dose and subjects receiving 80  mg will be reduced to 40 mg . 
During the double- blind treatment period, subjects will return to th e study center at  2-week 
intervals (end of Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8) for study assessments and dispensing of study drug (Weeks  2, 4, and 6 only).  All subjects who have completed the 8- week treatment period will 
enter a 2 -week follow-up period with a follow-up visit at Week 10 (or early termination).   
Efficacy assessments for TS symptomatology will be performed using the YGTSS (primary), 
the RTRS, the Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale (PUTS), the Clinical Global Impression o f

Change-Tourette Syndrome ( CGI-TS)-Improvement scale, and the Clinical Global Impression 
of Tics (CGI -Tics) -Severity scale.  The YGTSS, RTRS, and PUTS will be administered at 
screening, on Day -1 (the day before dosing), during the double- blind treatment period (Weeks 
2, 4, 6, and 8), and at the follow-up visit (Week 10 or early termination) .   
The CGI -Tics-Severity will be evaluated at screening and Day  -1 (baseline), and then both 
CGI-Tics-Severity and CGI -TS-Improvement scales will be administered at We eks 2, 4, 6, and 
8; and at  the follow-up visit (Week 10 or early termination) . 
Safety assessments will also be collected at scheduled times throughout the study including AE 
monitoring, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), vital sign 
measurements, physical examinations, ECG s, Columbia S uicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS), Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale -Abbreviated (ESRS- A), Structured Interview 
Guide for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale , 17-Item (SIGH -D-17), and the Yale- Brown 
Obsessive -Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS).  
Blood samples for plasma drug concentration and metabolite analyses will be collected during 
the treatment period (end of Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8), and on the follow-up visit (Week 10 or early 
terminatio n).

9.2. Screening and Baseline Assessments  
9.2.1. Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_263800] -1 (baseline), a blood sample will be collected from enrolled subjects for the analysis of 
CYP2D6 status (ie, extensive, intermediate, poor, or ultrarapid metabolizers).  Approximately 
4 mL of blood will be collected in tubes containing dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA  K
2).  After the sample is obtained, it should be thoroughly mixed.  The vials will be 
stoppered and labeled with the study barcode and  subject number.  The samples will be stored at 
approximatel y -20°C within approximately [ADDRESS_389394] adherence to professional 
standards of confidentiality.  Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_316489] a central laboratory for analysis.  
9.3. Efficacy Assessments  
9.3.1. Yale Global Tic Severity Scale 
The YGTSS will serve as the primary assessment of tic behaviors associated with TS (Leckman  et al., 1989).  The YGTSS is designed to rate the overall severity of motor and phonic 
tic s 
ymptoms across a range of dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and 
interference.   The scale also includes an impairment assessment.  The YGTSS will be 
administered by [CONTACT_093] (or qualified designee) using a computer- based structured 
clinical interview.  At each timepoin t, the YGTSS interview will be video recorded in its 
entirety.  The video recording will follow a standardized set of guidelines and the recorded video will be uploaded to a secure central server.  A blinded, external video reviewer will access 
the central  server to view the recording and (1) confirm the subject’s TS severity as at least 
moderate (at screening only), and (2) determine if the YGTSS interview program was 
administered properly.  The computer software system for the YGTSS administration, Rater 
Station
™ (Bracket Global LLC, Philadelphia, PA), will prompt the investigator (or a qualified 
designee), a trained and certified rater, to enter a score for each item of the scale based on 
subject responses during the structured clinical interview.  The software will also generate 
individual scores for each item of the scale (tandem rating) and will generate the TTS and the 
Global Tic Severity Score.   
The YGTSS will be administered at screening, baseline ( Day -1), during the double-blind 
treatment period (Weeks  2, 4, 6, and 8), and at the follow-up visit (Week 10 or early 
termination) .  A copy of the YGTSS is provided in Appendix 17.1.

9.3.2. Rush Video -Bas ed Tic Rating Scale 
A modified  RTRS will be used in this study that includes short video recordings to measure 
5 tic variables: number of body areas affected, frequency of motor and phonic tics, and severity 
of motor and phonic tics ( Goetz et al., 1999
).  Subjects must be video recorded while seated 
comfortably
 in a quiet room facing the camera with their hands in their lap and feet on the floor.  
If desired, subjects may read a book, as long as these activities do not block the camera’s view of their face,  neck and shoulders, arms, and legs.  Subjects should be video recorded for a total 
of approximately 10 minutes.  The investigator (or designee) should be present for 
approximately the first 2.[ADDRESS_389395] 
should then be video recorded alone for approximately 5 minutes.  The investigator (or designee) should then re-enter the room and remain seated quietly in a corner of the room for 
approximately the last 2.5  minutes of the video recording.  The R TRS videos will be reviewed 
and scored by a blinded central rater using a triple-blind scoring process. 
The RTRS w
ill be administe red at screening, baseline ( Day -1), during the double -blind 
treatment period (Weeks  2, 4, 6, and 8), and at the follow-up visit ( Week  10 or early 
termination) .  A copy of the modified  RTRS is provided in Appendix 17.2.  
9.3.3. Premonitory Urge for Tics Scale 
The Premonitory Urge  for Tics S cale ( PUTS ) is a valid and reliable instrument for quantifying 
the premonitory urge phenomena associated with tics ( Woods et al., 2005).  
Each of the 9 items 
in the PUTS i
s rated on a 4- point scale (1 = not at all true, 2 = a little true, 3 = pr etty much true, 
4 = very much true) and summed to yield at a total score reflecting the presence and frequency 
of pre -tic (ie, premonitory) urges along with relief that may be experienced after tics have been 
completed.   
The investigat
or (or designee) will administer the PUTS at screening, baseline (Day -1), during 
the double-blind treatment period (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8), and at  the follow-up visit (Week 10 or 
early termination) .  A copy of the PUTS is provided in Appendix 17.3. 
9.3.4. Clinical Global Impression of Tourette Syndrome 
The CGI -Tics – Severity and CGI-TS – Improvement scales will be used to rate the subject’s 
overall severity and overall improvement of TS.   
The CGI -Tics-Severity scale will be used to assess overall severity on a 7 -point scale (range; 
1=normal, not at all ill to 7=among the most extremely ill patients).  The CGI -Tics – Severity 
will be assessed by  [CONTACT_109481], baseline (Day -1), Weeks  2, 4, 6, and 8 and at 
the follow-up visit (Week 10 or upon early termination).  A copy of the CGI- Tics – Severity 
scale is provided in Appendix 17.4.  
The CGI-TS – Improvement scale will be used to assess overall improvement since the 
initiation of study drug dosing on a 7-point scale (range; 1=very much improved to 7=very 
much worse).  CGI -TS-Improvement scales will be assessed by [CONTACT_316495] 2, 4, 
6, and 8 and at the follow-up visit (Week 10 or upon early termination).  A copy of the 
CGI-TS-Improvement scale is provided in Appendix 17.5.

9.4. Pharmacokinetic Evaluations  
Blood samples to evaluate plasma concentrations of NBI -[ZIP_CODE] and the metabolite NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 
will be collected during the treatment period (end of Weeks  2, 4, 6, and 8) and the follow-up 
visit ( Week  10 or early termination).   The exact time of collection will be recorded on the 
eCRF.  
For each plasma sample, approximately [ADDRESS_389396] tube rack and kept 
on crushed ice.  Within 1 hour of collection, samples will be centrifuged at ap proximately 
2,000 g for 10  minutes, preferably under refrigerated conditions (2 to  8°C).  The separated 
plasma will be aspi[INVESTIGATOR_11117] a disposable pi[INVESTIGATOR_316490].  The vials will be stoppered and labeled with the study barcode, subject 
number, primary or back-up sample designation (PK  A and PK B, respectively), and nominal 
study date.  The samples will be stored at approximately -20°C within approximately 
15 minutes of centrifu gation.  The date an d actual 24 -hour clock time of each collection will be 
recorded on the eCRF.  The duplicate plasma sample at each timepoint will be stored and used 
as backup.  These samples (including a manifest with additional information) will be shipped to a central laboratory for analysis to be stored at approximately -70°C.  Plasma samples 
remaining at the end of the study may be used for exploratory assessments.  
9.5. Safety Assessments  
Concomitant medication use and AEs will be monitored throughout the study as described in Sections Section  9.8.[ADDRESS_389397] 
results obtained on the follow -up visit (Week 10) or at early termination, until the value returns 
to baseline (or within normal limits), or the investigator deems the abnormality to be of no clinical significance.  If the investigator determines that a subject has a clinically significant finding of treatment-emergent depression, suicidal ideation, psychiatric symptoms (based upon 
the C -SSRS, SIGH -D-17, Y-BOCS, or clinical assessment), the finding will be documented as 
an AE, and appropriate psychiatric evaluation and intervention will be provided. 
9.5.1. Vital Sign Measurements  
Vital signs will include orthostatic systolic and diastolic blood pressure, orthostatic pulse rate,

9.5.2. Medical History  
A medical history will be taken at the screening visit and updated on Day - 1.  The age at TS 
diagnosis will be documented for all subjects; if necessary, subject age at TS onset can be 
estimated by [CONTACT_263824].  
9.5.3. Physical Examination, Including Height and Weight  
The complete physical examination will consist of an ass essment of general appearance, skin 
and mucosae, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), lymph nodes, chest/lungs, 
cardiovascular, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurological system.  A complete 
physical examination including weight will be performed at screening, Day  -1, and Weeks  2, 4, 
6, 8, and 10 (or upon early termination).  Height will be measured at screening only.  Height and 
weight will be measured with subjects not wearing shoes.  
9.5.4. Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12- lead E CG will be recorded in triplicate (1 to 3 minutes apart) after the subject has 
rested supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 5 minutes.  The ECG parameters that will be assessed include heart rate (HR), PR interval, QRS duration, QTc interval, and QTcF (machine readings or c alculated).

9.5.6. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior 
(http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu).  There are versions of the questionnaire designed for use at screening (Baseline/Screening version) and at baseline and visits throughout the study (Since Last Visit version).  All versions of the C- SSRS include a series of screening questions related 
to suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of ‘yes’ to one or more screening questions will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior.  Subjects with an y lifetime suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of 
type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) in the 1 year  before screening based on the 
C-SSRS shou ld be excluded (see exclusion criterion #17 in  Section  8.2).  
The C -SSRS will be administered and scored by [CONTACT_263827], Day -1, and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 (or upon early termination).  Copi[INVESTIGATOR_316491] C-SSRS versions are provided in Appendix 17.6 and Appendix 17.7.

All returned study drug and study drug materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and 
returned according to applicable state and federal regulations and study procedures.  
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs, whether observed by [CONTACT_093], reported by [CONTACT_423], noted from laboratory 
findings, or identified by [CONTACT_11174], will be recorded from the time the subject signed the ICF 
until the subject’s follow-up visit (Week 10 or early termination). 
11.1. Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related.  During the study, clinically significant adverse changes in clinical status, ECGs, laboratory values (not associated with an AE or co ncurrent medical 
condition), or physical examinations are considered AEs.  Any subject complaint associated with such an abnormal finding will also be reported as an AE. 
Adverse events include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or 
frequency of conditions present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary 
illness; (3) intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction.  
If at any time after the baseline visit (Day -1), the subject’s response to the suicidal ideation 
section of the C- SSRS is worse than the baseline assessment; it will be documented as an AE.  
All suicidal behaviors will be documented as an AE. 
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any 
specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based 
on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and 
evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by [CONTACT_316510], must be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE eCRF .  Each AE is to be evaluated for 
duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the study drug.  
The following are not considered AEs: 
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before drug administration, unless it 
unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following drug administration 
• Recurrence of T S symptoms, unless worsened from baseline

11.2. Intensity of Adverse Events  
Adverse events must be graded for intensity.  An intensity category of mild, moderate, or 
severe, as defined in  Table 3, must be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be noted that the term 
“severe” used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.” 
Table 3: Intensity of Adverse Events  
Grade  Intensity  
Mild  An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
Moderate  An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  
The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research participant.  
Severe  An AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
 
11.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
The investigator will document his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_316492] 4.  An AE is deemed associated with the use of 
the study drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE” (otherwise referred to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event (Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a]). 
Table 4: Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
Relationship  Descriptio n 
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or in 
which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by [CONTACT_45452][INVESTIGATOR_11125], and reappearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure.  
Possible  An adverse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  
Reasonable possibility m eans there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event.  
Unlikely  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that 
follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could 
reasonably be explained by [CONTACT_11176]’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
11.4. Reco rding Adverse Events  
For randomized subjects, each AE will be listed as a separate entry on an AE eCRF.  Screen 
failure subjects will have AE information noted in the source documentation.  The investigator (or designee) will provide information on dates and times of onset and resolution, intensity, 
seriousness, frequency, action(s) taken, changes in study drug usage, relationship to study drug, 
and outcome. 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_389415] be reported within 24 hours to NBI or its designee: 
• Serious adverse event, including death (Refer to Section  11.6).  
• Pregnancy (refer to Section  11.7).  
• Events of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal ideation with 
some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific 
plan and intent) based on the C- SSRS.  
11.5. Post-Study Follow- Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs, including clinically significant changes in ECGs, physical examination findings, or isolated clinically significant laboratory findings must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  If 
resolved, a resolution date should be documented on the eCRF.   
Adverse events ongoing at the follow-up visit or early termination will be followed for as long 
as necessary to adequately evaluate the subject’s safety or until the event stabilizes or resolves 
or until the subject is lost to follow up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow 
up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, 
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care pro fessionals, as is 
practical.  
11.6. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be recorded from the time the subject has signed the ICF until [ADDRESS_389416] do se of study drug . 
11.6.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the fo llowing outcomes: 
• Death.  
• A life threatening adverse event.  Life threatening means that the subject was, in the view of 
the investigator or sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It 
does not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if it occurred in a more serious form.  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_263804] a preexisting  condition that did not worsen during the clinical 
investigation  is not considered an AE.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_316493].  Complications that occur during 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1084], and if a complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the event is considered serious.  Treatment in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11128] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.

• Important medical ev ents that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  These events may be considered serious when, based on appropriate 
medical judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Any other event thought by [CONTACT_316511], following the reporting requirements detailed in this section.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
11.6.2. Managing Serious Adverse Events 
Subjects experiencing an SAE  or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as 
soon as possible.  The physician in attendance will do whatever is medically needed for the 
safety and well -being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation as long as 
medically indicated.  Appropriate laboratory studies will be conducted until all parameters 
return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable.  The subject will be followed until the SAE resolves or until the subject is medically stabilized.  The investigator (or designee) will 
notify the m edical monitor (and the IRB, if necessary) immediately (within 24 hours) of the 
SAE and the outcome of the SAE. 
If within the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_389417] be documented and reported as described in Section  11.6.3. 
11.6.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Other Immediately Reportable Events  
Serious AEs and other immediately reportable events (defined in Section  11.4)  must be reported 
within [ADDRESS_389418] knowledge of the event by [CONTACT_316512] m edical monitor 
or NBI Clinical Drug Safety (CDS) Department.  Reports of SAEs or pregnancies should be 
followed by a fax or email of the SAE or Pregnancy Form.  It is important that the investigator 
provide his or her assessment of relationship to study drug at the time of the initial SAE report.  
For SAEs or Other Immediately Reportable Events, contact [CONTACT_11180]: 
 CDS telephone:  (866) 626- 7792 or ([PHONE_6620]

11.6.4. Expedited Safety Reports  
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. or its representatives will submit an Expedited Safety Report for 
any suspected adverse reaction ( as defined in Section  11.3)  that is considered both serious and 
unexpected within 15 calendar days and for any unexpected fatal or life threatening experience 
within 7 calendar days via telephone or facsimile; or accor ding to country specific regulations. 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_389419] be submitted to 
the appropriate IRB as soon as possible.  Documentation of the submission to the IRB and 
receipt by [CONTACT_1201] (if applicable) must be retained for each safety report.  
11.7. Pregnancy  
Pregnancy is neither an AE nor an SAE unless the criteria for an SAE are met.  However, all 
pregnancies in female subjects who received NBI-[ADDRESS_389420] be counseled at all visits to continue using two forms of 
nonhormonal contraception or hormonal contraception (see  inclusion criterion #10 in 
Section  8.1) until [ADDRESS_389421] be immediately reported 
to NBI (refer to  Section  11.6.[ADDRESS_389422] information), followed by [CONTACT_263839].  A first trimester ultrasound will be required for all confirmed pregnancies.  Pregnancies in subjects who received NBI -[ZIP_CODE] will be followed until resolution 
(ie, termination [voluntary or spontaneous] or birth). 
12. DOCUMENTATION OF DAT A 
12.1. Case Report Form 
The CRF data for this study are being collected with an electronic data capture (EDC) system 
(Rave®) provided by [CONTACT_263840], NY, [LOCATION_003].  The EDC system and the 
study-specific eCRFs will comply with Title [ADDRESS_389423] data in his/her own subject files.  These subject files will 
serve as source data for the study.  All eCRF data required by [CONTACT_41788], with the exception of data captured in an electronic format, which will be loaded electronically into the appropriate eCRFs.  All data 
entered into the eCRF will be supported by [CONTACT_26300].  The eCRF for each subject 
must be reviewed by [CONTACT_263842](s).  This should be done as soon as possible after the subject completes the study.   
The investigator or an authorized member of the investigator's staff will make any necessary 
additions/corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date, person performing the corrections, and reason for the change will be available via the electronic audit 
trail, which is part of the EDC system.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for 
completeness, legibility, and acceptability by [CONTACT_11148]  (or designee).  NBI will also be allowed 
access to all source documents and medical records pertinent to the study in order to verify 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI-[ZIP_CODE]-[ADDRESS_389424]- protected method of internet access.  Such access will be removed 
from investigator sites at the end of the site's participation in the study.  Data from the EDC 
system will be archived on appropriate data media (CD ROM, etc.) and provided to the 
investigator at that time as a durable record of the site’ s eCRF data.  Although not required, the 
investigator may make paper printouts from that media.  
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to GCP regulations.  This includes an inspection by [CONTACT_11185]/or health authority representatives at any time.  The Principal Investigator w ill agree to the inspection of study -related records by [CONTACT_41790]/or NBI.  
12.2. Data Capture, Review, and Validation  
Data entered in the EDC system will be verified against the source data by [CONTACT_11148] (or designee).  Any discrepancies will be corrected on -line by [CONTACT_1747].  After completion of 
the entry process, automated (computer-generated) logic checks will run in order to identify items such as inconsistent study dates.  In addition, manual review/checks may be performed by [CONTACT_11188].  Any inconsistencies/errors/omissions identified will be sent to the site (via an 
electronic query) for the necessary corrections to be made to the eCRF.  Once entered and saved 
in an eCRF, data immediately become part of the study database and are available to NBI.  
12.3. Coding Dictionaries  
Adverse events and medical history will be coded using the chosen version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Prior and concomitant medications will be 
coded using the chosen version of the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO 
Drug).  
13. STATISTIC AL AND ANALYTICAL PL AN 
Descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be used to evaluate and summarize the data 
from this study.  The term “descriptive statistics” refers to  the number of subjects (n), mean, 
median, standard deviation (SD), standard error of the mean (SEM), minimum, and maximum 
for continuous and ordinal categorical variables; and refers to the number and percentage of 
subjects for categorical variables.  The term “inferential statistics” refers to hypothesis tests 
which will be performed to assess differences between each NBI-[ZIP_CODE] treatment group and 
placebo for selected efficacy variables.  
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study is the YGTSS TTS mean change from baseline 
(Day -1) to Week 8.  Inferential statistics will be calculated for this endpoint as well as for other 
(secondary) efficacy endpoints, which include the YGTSS Global Tic Severity score mean 
change from baseline to Week  8, the RTRS total s core mean change from baseline to Week 8, 
the PUTS total score mean change from baseline to Week 8, and the CGI -TS-Improvement 
mean score change from baseline to  Week 8 , and the CGI- Tics-Severity mean score change

from baseline to Week 8 .  Exploratory anal yses of the Week  2, Week  4, and Week  6 values of 
these endpoints will be performed also.  Nominal two-sided p- values will be reported for all 
hypothesis tests (ie, without any adjustments for multiplicity).  
The analysis plan provided in this protocol represents a brief description of the planned 
analyses.  A comprehensive and detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be generated prior 
to final study database lock and treatment unblinding.  The SAP may include a number of 
additional analyses and data summaries not described in this protocol. 
13.1. Analysis Sets 
Three analysis sets will be defined for this study.  The safety analysis set will include all 
subjects who are randomized to a treatment group and receive at least one dose of study drug.  
The intent- to-treat (ITT) analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analysis set who have 
at least one evaluable TTS during the 8 -week double-blind treatment period.  The per-protocol 
(PP) analysis set will include all subjects in the ITT analysis set w ho have no efficacy- related 
important protocol deviations.  Additional PP analysis set criteria may be specified in the SAP.  
13.2. Sample Size  
The study sample size of [ADDRESS_389425] with a two -sided Type I error of 0.05.  This 
sample size provides 80% power to detect an effect size of approximately 0.75 and 90% power to detect an effect size of approximately 0.85.  Note that the e ffect size is defined as an 
NBI-[ADDRESS_389426] sizes for the TTS from published reports of placebo- contro
 lled TS trials generally range 
from approximately 0.6 to slightly greater than 1.0 ( Jankovic et
 al, 2010, Yoo et al, 2013, 
Clinic
alTrials [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  The effect sizes of 0.[ADDRESS_389427] one dose of study drug, who 
completed the 8 -week treatment period, and who completed the study.  The number of subjects 
who did not complete the study will be summarized also, both overall and according to the reason for early discontinuation. 
13.5. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic data (age, gender, race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (including 
height, weight, BMI, CYP2D6 genotype status, age at TS diagnosis, and baseline values for the 
TTS score) will be summarize d with descriptive statistics for each treatment group and for the 
overall study population.  Medical history will also be summarized.

13.6. Study Drug Dosing and Compliance  
The number of doses of study drug taken during the double-blind, placebo-controlled trea tment 
period will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765] (Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8).  The 
cumulative estimated number of doses taken through Week 8 will be summarized as well.  
Additionally, the number of dose reductions will be summarized. 
13.7. Pharmac okinetic Data  
The plasma concentrations of NBI-[ZIP_CODE] and the metabolite NBI -[ZIP_CODE] will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765] (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10).  Concentrations below the lower 
limit of quantification will be set equal to zero for all plasma concentration summaries.  
13.8. Efficacy Data  
The efficacy measures in this study include the YGTSS, RTRS, PUTS, CGI -Tics-Severity, and 
CGI-TS–Improvement.  A number of derived variables based on these measures (eg, the TTS) 
will be summarized with descriptive statistics by [CONTACT_765], and inferential statistics will be 
calculated for selected variables as described in the following paragraphs.  The SAP will provide a full description of the derived variables that will be summarized for these efficacy 
measures.  
The TTS changes from baseline (Day -1) and the Global Tic Severity score changes from 
baseline (Day  -1) at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 will be analyzed with a mixed- effects model repeated 
measures (MMRM) model which includes the baseline value as a covariate and treatment group 
(placebo, NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 40 mg, or NBI -[ZIP_CODE] 80 mg ), visit (Week 2, 4, 6, or 8), treatment group 
by [CONTACT_23259], and baseline by [CONTACT_263847].  Subject will b e included as 
a random effect.  
Least -squares (LS) mean differences between each NBI-[ZIP_CODE] treatment group and placebo at 
each visit will be tested for significance and summarized with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals.  
Nominal 2-sided p- values will be reported for all hypothesis tests.  Note that the primary 
comparisons of interest are those for the Week 8 visit; comparisons at Weeks 2 , 4, and 6 are 
considered to be exploratory.   
Similar MMRM analyses will be performed for the RTRS total score and PUTS total score.   
The CGI-Tics – Severity and CGI -TS-Improvement will be summarized by [CONTACT_316513] (using numeric scores which range from 1 through 7) 
and with frequency tables (based on the response category descriptors).  Additionally, the 
percentage of subjects who are “Much Improved” or “Very Much Improved” on the improvement scale will be summarized.   
Hypothesis tests comparing each NBI -[ZIP_CODE] treatment group to placebo at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 
will be performed for the numeric CGI- Tics – Severity and CGI -TS-Improvement scores using 
an MMRM model similar to the model described above for the TTS, but without a baseline 
covariate.  
The descriptive and inferential statistical summaries for the efficacy variables will be presented 
for both t he ITT a nd PP analysis sets.

13.9. Safety Data  
Treatment -emergent AEs, categorized by [CONTACT_9313] (SOC) and preferred term (PT) as 
defined by [CONTACT_165942], will be summarized in frequency tables.  The TEAE summary tables 
will include the number of events, number of unique subjects experiencing each event, and 
percentage of subjects experiencing each event.  
Summary tables will be presented including all TEAEs, only TEAEs that are considered to be 
possibly or definitely related to study drug, and TEAEs according to maximum intensity.  
Additional summaries will be presented for TEAEs leading to premature discontinuation from 
the study, SAEs, and deaths. 
Clinical laboratory, serum prolactin, vital signs, ECG, C- SSRS, ESRS -A, Y-BOCS, and SIGH -
D-17 data will be summarized  by [CONTACT_316514].  Clinically significant physical 
examination findings will be displayed in a data listing.  Prior and concomitant medications will 
also be summarized.  
13.10.  Software  
Statistical calculations and summaries will be generated using SAS software version 9.3 or 
later.  
13.11.  Interim Analysis  
An interim analysis is not planned for this study.

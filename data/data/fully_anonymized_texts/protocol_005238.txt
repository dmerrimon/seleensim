30 June 2020 Confidential Page 16 of 72Power and Sample
Size:Cohort 1 will include approximately 6 evaluable subjects, which is
deemed adequate for the purpose of evaluating safety and PK prior to
Cohort 2.
There are approximately 215 subjects planned for Cohort 2.
Approximately 61 subjects will receive ARQ-252 cream 0.3% QD,
approximately 61 subjects will receive ARQ-252 cream 0.3% BID,
approximately 31 subjects will receive ARQ-252 cream 0.1% QD,
approximately 31 subjects will receive matching vehicle cream QD,
and approximately 31 subjects will receive vehicle cream BID.
The randomization scheme will be 2:2:1:1:1 between these
5 treatment groups, stratified by [CONTACT_318264].
The primary statistical comparisons will be to assess the ARQ-252
cream 0.3% BID group versus the vehicle BID group, to assess the
ARQ-252 cream 0.3% QD group versus the vehicle QD group, and to
assess the ARQ-252 cream 0.1% QD group versus the vehicle QD
group.
A sample size of 55 per active arm and 28 per vehicle arm will
provide approximately 85% power at the 2-sided 5% significance
level to detect a difference in the percent of subjects with IGA clear or
almost clear at Week 12; for each ARQ-252-treated group versus
vehicle group within the same daily dosing frequency, assuming an
active treatment response rate of 45% and a vehicle response rate of
15%, with a two-sidedα= 0.1. This is based on a 2-group X2test of
equal proportions (without continuity correction). With a 10%
dropout rate, the sample size for the study is increased to 61 subjects
per active arm and 31 subjects per vehicle arm (215 subjects total).
The primary statistical comparisons and evaluation of the secondary
endpoints will not be adjusted for multiplicity.
Statistical Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be presented for the study endpoints. This
includes the number and percentage of subjects for binary
endpoints/categorical data, and mean, SD, median, minimum, and
maximum for continuous data.
The primary endpoint in Cohort 2 of ‘IGA clear or almost clear at
Week 12’ will be analyzed using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test
stratified by [CONTACT_318264]. The analysis will be
performed on the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population and missing
data will be imputed using multiple imputation.
Continuous secondary endpoints measured in Cohort [ADDRESS_391621] will be included in the safety
population.
Adverse events (AEs) will be summarized within each cohort by
[CONTACT_11702], system organ class, and treatment group (Cohort 2
only) for all treatment-emergent AEs, serious AEs, related AEs,
AEs leading to withdrawal from investigational product.
Safety laboratory parameters and vital signs will be summarized at
each visit using descriptive statistics or frequencies and percentages,
as appropriate. Changes from Baseline in laboratory values and vital
signs will also be summarized by [CONTACT_765]. In addition, changes from
Baseline in weight and laboratory values will be summarized using
shift tables. These summaries will be tabulated by [CONTACT_318265] 2.
All subjects who are enrolled and receive at least one application of
investigational product and have sufficient pharmacokinetic
assessments will be included in the pharmacokinetic population
(Cohorts 1 and 2). When possible, the exposure to SHR0302 will be
calculated based on plasma concentrations versus time profile data.

Protocol ARQ-252-[ADDRESS_391630] quality of life and cause significant costs, e.g., through inability
of patients to work. There is considerable unmet medical need for new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_318232]/or approved specifically for hand eczema
(e.g., no FDA-approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) and treatment is often unsatisfactory ( Diepgen 2009 ).
Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of intracellular nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that transduce
cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
pathway and have a plethora of effects on the immune system, inflammation, and hematopoiesis.
In humans, the JAK family includes JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). JAK1 is
a human tyrosine kinase which plays a critical role in initiating responses to multiple major
cytokines. It interacts with the common gamma chain of type I cytokine receptors to elicit signals
from the IL-2 receptor family, the IL-4 receptor family, the gp130 receptor family and other
cytokine receptor families. It is also important for transducing a signal by [CONTACT_24975] I and type II
interferons, and members of the IL-10 family via type II cytokine receptors. JAK2 has been
implicated in signaling by [CONTACT_318267]-CSF receptor family and controls various functions relating to
hematopoiesis. JAK3 is involved in signal transduction by [CONTACT_318268] I cytokine receptor family (e.g., IL-2R, IL-4R, IL-7R, IL-9R, IL-15R,
and IL-21R) ( Villarino 2017 ). Finally, Tyk2 is important for Th1 and Th17 responses,
transducing signals by [CONTACT_318269], IL-12, IL-23, IL-22, and IL-6 ( O’Shea 2019 ).
The first demonstration of the clinical efficacy of JAK inhibitors in eczema utilized a topi[INVESTIGATOR_318233]-JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib, which has been approved orally for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis ( Bissonnette 2016a ).
Subsequently, several topi[INVESTIGATOR_73209] (delgocitinib, ruxolitinib) ( Kim 2019;
Nakagawa 2018, Worm 2019 ) and oral JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, PF-04965842, baricitinib)
(Guttman-Yassky 2019a; Gooderham 2019; Guttman-Yassky 2019b ) have been reported to have
efficacy in the treatment of eczema. Oral JAK inhibitors can be accompanied by [CONTACT_318270], lymphoma and other malignancies, and
hematologic and lipid abnormalities. We are pursuing development of ARQ-252 cream, a topi[INVESTIGATOR_318234]1 selective inhibitor SHR0302, as a potential treatment for particular forms of
eczema aiming to maintain the efficacy of this class of agents in these diseases while minimizing
systemic exposure and undesirable side effects.
SHR0302 is in Phase 2 development as an oral therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s
disease, ulcerative colitis, and atopic dermatitis by [CONTACT_318271] (Hengrui) and Reistone Biopharma. Clinical safety data from these ongoing
programs, as well as extensive nonclinical studies, provide support for Arcutis’ dermal
(ARQ‑252) development program.

Nonclinical Safety Summary
In vitropharmacology data supports that SHR0302 is a strong JAK inhibitor, with
JAK1>JAK2>JAK3> Tyk2 inhibitory activity. Additionally, SHR0302 has demonstrated
activity comparable to tofacitinib in variousin vivomodels of inflammatory conditions,
including the imiquimod-induced murine model of psoriasis, the oxazolone-induced murine
model of atopic dermatitis, the rat and murine models of collagen-induced arthritis, the
adjuvant-induced arthritis rat model, and the murine dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis
model.
The nonclinical safety profile of orally administered SHR0302 has been well characterized
through the conduct of safety pharmacology, acute and repeat dose toxicity in rats and monkeys,
genetic toxicology (bacterial reverse mutation,in vitromicronucleus,in vivomicronucleus in
rats), and reproductive/developmental toxicology (fertility, embryofetal development) studies.
In safety pharmacology studies, SHR0302 did not cause significant changes in cardiovascular,
CNS or respi[INVESTIGATOR_263576]. After oral administration, SHR0302 was well absorbed and
distributed into many tissues.
During the oral dosing program of SHR0302 with dose levels up to 150 mg/kg/day in rats and
15 mg/kg/day in monkeys, the major target organs identified following repeated dosing were
immune system (lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus), bone marrow, reproductive organs and
digestive tract. As SHR0302 is a potent inhibitor of Janus kinases which are known to affect
cytokine-mediated signaling, the immunomodulatory effects observed (mainly in the rat) in the
toxicity studies are consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action of SHR0302.
The genotoxicity studies on SHR0302 indicate a lack of potential to induce point mutations,
chromosomal aberrations, or to interact with or damage DNA. Therefore, it is unlikely that
SHR0302 poses a genotoxic risk to humans.
Results of a rat fertility study with SHR0302 showed no effects on male fertility and disrupted
early embryonic development in female rats at 10 and 50 mg/kg. The no observed adverse effect
level (NOAEL) was 50 mg/kg for male fertility and 1 mg/kg for female fertility and early
embryonic development. Embryofetal development studies in rats demonstrated maternal and
fetal toxicity and fetal teratogenicity following oral dosing of SHR0302. The NOAEL for rat
dams was 10 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg for embryofetal effects. In the rabbit embryofetal study, no
maternal toxicity was noted at the high dose of 25 mg/kg/day (NOAEL). Rabbit embryo-fetal
developmental toxicity was noted with effects on fetal viability and development, including fetal
visceral and/or skeletal malformations and resulting in a NOAEL of 1 mg/kg/day.
The nonclinical safety profile of SHR0302 was also evaluated topi[INVESTIGATOR_318235]-daily topi[INVESTIGATOR_78086]. Dermal toxicology studies conducted to date
include 13-week mouse, 7-day tolerability in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], 4-week and 16-week toxicity in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107],
and local tolerance (ocular irritation, skin sensitization,in vitrophototoxicity). Planned studies
include 39-week toxicity in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_318236] a 104-week carcinogenicity study in mice.

30 June 2020 Confidential Page 26 of 72The dermal toxicity of ARQ-252 (SHR0302 cream) has been evaluated and no new risks have
been identified and no target organs were identified. In the 13-week dermal toxicity study in
mice and the 7-day and 16-week dermal toxicity studies in minipi[INVESTIGATOR_14107], no evidence of systemic
toxicity was observed, and no dermal findings were noted. The NOAELs in each of these repeat
dose dermal toxicity studies were the highest doses administered.
Local tolerance studies demonstrated ARQ-[ADDRESS_391631] study of topi[INVESTIGATOR_78424]-252 cream in the human population.
Oral administration of SHR0302 has been studied in three Phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies,
including two conducted in healthy volunteers and one conducted in subjects with rheumatoid
arthritis. Oral administration of SHR0302 has also been studied in a 24-week, Phase 2 study in
subjects with rheumatoid arthritis.
Oral Administration: Phase [ADDRESS_391632] duration of exposure was 7 days of 10 mg SHR0302 in rheumatoid arthritis
patients.
A study on human safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics was conducted on
SHR0302 following single dose oral administration in healthy subjects (SHR0302-101).
This was a randomized, double blind and placebo-controlled study with six dosage groups of
1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg. AEs were reported mainly from the high-dose groups (50 mg and
100 mg) in this single ascending dose study. The most common AEs involved the hematologic
system (neutropenia and high lymphocyte count). Adverse reactions included neutropenia in
7 subjects (10.9%), elevated lymphocytes in 6 subjects (9.4%), and leukopenia in [ADDRESS_391633]
(1.6%). At the 25 mg dose and below, there was no obvious difference between the active and
placebo arms. There were no serious adverse events.
Following single oral dose administration, SHR0302 was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_318237] T max
values of 1.0 hour across all dose groups. Geometric mean C maxvalues increased 105-fold over
the 100-fold increase in dose (1 to 100 mg), demonstrating dose proportional kinetics. Similarly,
the geometric mean AUC 0-24values increased 107-fold over the same 100-fold increase in dose.

30 June 2020 Confidential Page 27 of 72A multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of human safety, pharmacokinetics, and
pharmacodynamics was conducted on orally administered SHR0302 in subjects with rheumatoid
arthritis (SHR0302-102). This was a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study
with four planned dosage groups of 2, 5, [ADDRESS_391634] infection, two cases of lowered free thyroxine, and one case each of ear pain, conjunctivitis,
hypoesthesia, constipation and hematuria. Elevated TSH in blood (five cases), urinary tract

Following multiple oral dose administrations of SHR0302, the median T maxvalue was 1.0 hour
across the dose groups. Geometric mean C maxvalues increased 3.5-fold over the 5-fold increase
in dose (2 to 10 mg), demonstrating less than dose proportional kinetics. Similarly, the geometric
mean AUC 0-24values increased 4.1-fold over the same 5-fold increase in dose from
1130 hr*ng/mL for the 2 mg dose to 4620 hr*ng/mL for the [ADDRESS_391636] study of high-fat intake on the pharmacokinetics of SHR0302 has also been
conducted (SHR0302-103). In this study, SHR0302 (10 mg tablet) was safe and well tolerated in
healthy subjects, and administration of SHR0302 after a high-fat meal did not significantly
impact systemic exposure. Except for one AE (soft tissue contusion) unrelated to drug which
was moderate, the other AEs were mild and recovered without treatment. No SAEs were
reported, and no subject withdrew from the trial due to an AE.
Overall, SHR0302 was well-tolerated with no SAEs reported.
Oral Administration: Phase 2
Preliminary results are available from SHR0302-201, a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized study
evaluating 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, and 8 mg of SHR0302 as once-daily oral monotherapy for
adults with active rheumatoid arthritis who were naïve to any disease modifying anti-rheumatic
drug (DMARDs) or have had an inadequate response or intolerance to conventional synthetic
DMARDs. The study was placebo-controlled for 12 weeks, followed by a 12-week, open label
maintenance phase. The Primary Endpoint was the response rate of American College of
Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) at Week 12, which is a composite measure defined as 20%
improvement in the number of tender and swollen joints, and 20% improvement in 3 of 5 criteria

•SHR0302 was generally safe and well tolerated. A higher frequency of infections was
observed in SHR0302-treated subjects, particularly in the 8mg group. The most common
infections included upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_318238].
•Mean WBC, neutrophils, lymphocyte, HGB, platelet count, serum lipid level, liver
function, kidney function, and thyroid function parameters remained in the normal range
in all SHR0302 treatment groups.
•Mean platelet count did not increase during the study.
•Increases in LDL, HDL, total cholesterol and triglycerides were observed. However,
LDL-to-HDL remained stable.
•Increase in mean serum creatine kinase (CK) was observed in patients treated with
SHR0302 versus placebo but was within normal range. CK-MB remained stable.
•Most of the reported abnormal laboratory results were classified as CTCAE grade 1 or 2.
CTCAE grade 3 events included: 1 case of increased alanine aminotransferase (4 mg),
1 case of decreased neutrophils (8 mg), 1 case of decreased lymphocytes (4 mg) and
1 case of anemia (8 mg).
•From Baseline through Week 12, the most common AEs (≥5% across pooled SHR0302
groups) included upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416], hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], swollen joint, urinary tract
infection, hypercholesterolemia, joint pain, and cough. From Baseline to Week 12, other

Additional Studies
An open label, self-controlled study (SHR0302-105) evaluating drug interaction potential
between SHR0302 and methotrexate (MTX) in subjects with rheumatoid arthritis was recently
completed. Subjects were to take MTX 10 mg once daily on Day 1 and Day 8, and SHR0302
10 mg once daily on Days 3 to Day 8. Overall, 15 subjects were enrolled. A total of 18 adverse
events were reported in 8 of 15 subjects (53.3%). Of the 18 adverse events, 3 subjects (20.0%)
reported 5 adverse events after SHR0302 alone, 4 subjects (26.7%) reported 5 adverse events
after MTX alone, and 3 subjects (20.0%) reported [ADDRESS_391641] (6.7%). The adverse events
reported by [CONTACT_318272]0302 in combination included anemia, upper

Dose Selection
ARQ-252 cream 0.3% was selected as the high clinical dose because this dose remains in
solution when stored at controlled room temperature.
In Cohort 1 of this study, ARQ-252 cream 0.3% will be applied QD to approximately 4% BSA
in subjects with hand eczema. It is well known that cutaneous disease states can alter drug
permeability as compared to normal human skin. Since eczematous skin may have different drug
permeability characteristics than normal skin ( Ortiz 2009 ;Halling-Overgaard 2017 ), this study is
planned in patients with hand eczema rather than healthy volunteers. Administration of
ARQ‑252 cream 0.3% once-daily to approximately 4% of BSA at an application rate of
approximately 0.75 mg/cm2would result in 1.5 mg of total SHR0302 being absorbed per day,
assuming 100% absorption of applied drug, an amount well covered by [CONTACT_318273] ( Section 2.3.1 ). In the oral MAD, daily doses of 2 to 10 mg resulted in
signals for thyroid effects (elevated TSH, decreased free T4), mild LFT abnormalities, and a few
urinary tract infections. These are all easily monitored, and skin absorption is very likely to be
only a small fraction of 100%. Moreover, in the Phase 2 RA study, mean WBC, neutrophils,
lymphocyte, HGB, platelet count, liver function and kidney function remained in the normal
range in all SHR0302 treatment groups.

30 June 2020 Confidential Page 32 of 72Following a review of safety and PK data from Phase 1 (Cohort 1) of this study, Phase 2b
(Cohort 2) can commence. Phase 2b (Cohort 2) is a parallel group, double blind,
vehicle-controlled cohort in which subjects with chronic hand eczema will be randomized to
ARQ-252 cream 0.3% QD, ARQ-252 cream 0.3% BID, ARQ-252 cream 0.1% QD, vehicle
cream BID or vehicle cream QD.
Risks and/or Benefits to Subjects
The potential risks of ARQ-252 cream stem from what is known about the safety of the oral form
of this drug, and risks associated with the JAK inhibitor mechanism. These risks include serious
infections, other infections (e.g., upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_6014], opportunistic infections,
herpes), anemia, lymphopenia, natural killer (NK) cell reduction, neutropenia, platelet elevations
or reductions, malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders, gastrointestinal perforations, liver
function abnormalities, thyroid function abnormalities, lipid elevation, serum creatinine
elevations, creatine phosphokinase elevations, thrombosis, nausea, diarrhea, headache, and
hypertension. In general, topi[INVESTIGATOR_318241]. Previous nonclinical
research showed that the active ingredient in ARQ-252 can harm fetal development. Please refer
to the Investigator’s Brochure for detailed information.
Phase 1 (Cohort 1)
Subjects in Cohort 1 subjects may see an improvement in their hand eczema, although the study
duration of 2 weeks may limit this possibility.
Phase 2b (Cohort 2)
Subjects randomized to active treatment in Cohort 2 may see an improvement in their hand
eczema with the use of ARQ-252 cream. Those receiving vehicle cream may also see
improvement related to the moisturizing properties of the vehicle
The safety monitoring practices employed in this protocol (i.e., physical examinations,
application site reaction assessments, hematology, serum chemistry, TSH, T4, urinalysis, ECG,
and AE questioning) are adequate to protect the subjects’ safety and should detect expected AEs.

Subject participation involves a minimum of 7 clinic visits including Screening, Baseline/Day 1,
Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week [ADDRESS_391650] participation is 17 weeks.
Randomization
Phase 1 (Cohort 1)
Phase 1 (Cohort 1) is open label and all enrolled subjects will be assigned treatment with
ARQ‑252 cream 0.3% QD at the Baseline visit. Subjects will be enrolled at the Baseline visit
after the Investigator confirms that the subject meets all eligibility criteria listed in Section 4.7 .
Enrollment will be documented by [CONTACT_318275].
Phase 2b (Cohort 2)
Phase 2b (Cohort 2) is randomized. Randomization will take place at the Baseline visit after the
Investigator confirms that the subject meets all eligibility criteria listed in Section 4.7 . Subjects
will be randomly assigned to apply ARQ-252 0.3% QD, ARQ-252 0.3% BID, ARQ-252 0.1%
QD, vehicle cream QD or vehicle cream BID by [CONTACT_165904]
(IRT).
Assignment of treatment arm will be made at a 2:2:1:1:[ADDRESS_391651] may
receive more than one kit for the treatment period. The kits and tubes will be labeled with a
unique number, in a blinded manner.

Numbering of Subjects
Phase 1 (Cohort 1)
All subjects who sign informed consent will be assigned a unique six-digit subject ID number by
[CONTACT_779]. The first three digits will correspond to the site number (assigned by [CONTACT_1034]) and
the next three digits correspond to the sequential order in which the subject is screened for the
study.
Phase 2b (Cohort 2)
All subjects who sign informed consent will be assigned a unique six-digit subject ID number by
[CONTACT_82550]. The first three digits correspond to the site number (assigned by [CONTACT_1034]),
the next three digits correspond to the sequential order in which the subject is screened for the
study.
The clinical site is responsible for maintaining a current log of subject ID number assignments
and the kit number assigned to that subject. The subject ID number is required to be entered on
all clinical study documentation (e.g., case report forms, labeling of clinical materials and sample
containers, investigational product accountability logs, etc.).
Blinding
Phase 1 (Cohort 1) is not blinded.
Phase 2b (Cohort 2) is double-blinded, therefore neither the subjects nor the Investigator and
clinical personnel will be aware of which investigational product (ARQ-252 0.1% cream,
ARQ‑252 0.3% cream or vehicle cream) an individual subject receives. The subjects,
Investigator and clinical personnel will be aware of whether IP is to be applied QD (once daily)
or BID (twice daily).
Breaking Treatment Codes
Phase 2b (Cohort 2)
In the event of a medical emergency where breaking the blind is required to provide medical care
to the subject, the Investigator may obtain treatment assignment directly from the IRT system for
that subject. Refer to the current version of the IRT plan for details on unblinding. Treatment
assignment should, however, remain blinded unless the assignment knowledge is necessary to
determine subject emergency medical care. The rationale for unblinding must be clearly
explained in source documentation and on the CRF, along with the date on which the treatment
assignment was obtained. The Investigator is requested to contact [CONTACT_318276].
Blinding of study treatment is critical to the integrity of this clinical trial and therefore, if a
subject’s treatment assignment is disclosed to the Investigator, the subject will have the study
treatment discontinued. All subjects will be followed until study completion unless consent to do
so is specifically withdrawn by [CONTACT_423].

(once daily). The kits and tubes will be labeled with a unique number, in a blinded manner.
Phase 1 and 2b (Cohorts 1 and 2)
The Sponsor will supply sufficient quantities of the investigational product to each site to allow
for completion of this study.
Records will be made of the receipt and dispensing of the investigational product supplied.
At the conclusion of the study, any unused investigational product will be returned to the
Sponsor or designee, or destroyed, as per Sponsor instructions.
Refer to the most current version of the IP Handling Plan for details on accountability, storage,
and management of IP.
Protocol ARQ-252-[ADDRESS_391665] at
enrollment/randomization. Study site staff will demonstrate how two unit doses (two pea size
amounts of IP will cover approximately 4% BSA, i.e., both hands entirely) are properly squeezed
from the tube and applied as a thin film to cover both hands. IP will be applied to the front and
back of both hands, interlacing fingers, rubbing in thoroughly but gently, until the cream has
absorbed. The subject will then practice squeezing a similar amount and applying IP. The study
staff will confirm that the subject’s application technique is correct.
Subjects in Cohort 1 will be instructed to apply IP once daily (QD). Subjects in Cohort 2 will be
instructed to apply IP either once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), as determined at
randomization.
IP tubes must be returned by [CONTACT_180398], both empty and full, and will be
weighed. Re-training will be conducted at subsequent visits as needed (i.e., if the returned tube
weighs substantially different than the expected weight).
Subjects will be instructed to refrain from handwashing for 4 hours after IP application, if
possible. Subjects may use hand sanitizer within 4 hours of IP application, if necessary.
Hand washing and use of hand sanitizer within 4 hours of IP application will be recorded in the
subjects’ diary and CRF.
Treatment Compliance
Each IP tube will be weighed prior to dispensing at the Baseline visit and at each follow-up
clinic visit according to the Schedule of Visits and Assessments ( Section 1.3 ). When IP is
applied in the clinic, the IP tube will be weighed before and after IP application. If the subject’s
actual use is substantially different than the expected use (see IP Handling Plan), the subject will
be retrained on the investigational product application technique.
Subjects will complete a daily diary recording the date and time of each dose applied, any missed
doses, and a comment section should the subjects have a comment, e.g., record potential AEs,
handwashing or use of hand sanitizer within [ADDRESS_391666] administration schedule
(i.e., if subject forgets a dose they should wait until the next planned application and apply as
usual).
A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the subject applies at least
80% of the expected applications during the investigational product application period and does
not miss more than [ADDRESS_391667]

Compliance will be documented in source and in CRF.
5. STUDY PROCEDURES
Safety Assessments
The Schedule of Visits and Assessments ( Section 1.3 ) summarizes the clinical procedures to be
performed at each visit. Individual clinical procedures are described in detail below. Additional
evaluations/testing may be deemed necessary by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or the Sponsor for reasons related to
subject safety.
This study assesses the safety, efficacy, and PK of ARQ-252 cream 0.1%, ARQ-252 cream 0.3%
and vehicle cream. Safety will be determined by [CONTACT_63287], 12-lead
ECGs, vital signs/weight, clinical laboratory parameters, local tolerability assessments, and AEs
as outlined in the Schedule of Visits and Assessments ( Section 1.3 ). If deemed necessary,
additional safety assessments will be performed at the discretion of the Investigator.
Screening
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the Investigator is responsible for obtaining
written informed consent from the subject after adequate explanation of the study design,
anticipated benefits, and the potential risks. A subject is considered a participant of the trial once
the ICF is completely signed.
The following procedures/assessments will be performed at the Screening Visit (within 4 weeks
after signing the informed consent):
•Review of medical and surgical history, including any history of allergies and/or contact
[CONTACT_8748]
•Review of childbearing potential (subject or partner of male subject) and contraceptive
use (see Section 5.1.2 )
•Collection of demographic data including sex, age, race, ethnicity
•Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure
•Chronic Hand Eczema assessments (BSA, IGA, HECSI).
•Limited physical examination of skin, lungs, and heart

Adverse Events
Adverse Event Definition
An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans,
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended
sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with
the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal
(investigational) product.
AEs will be collected following informed consent of the subject through subject study
completion.
A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that started post application of
investigational product through study completion.
Application site reactions will be considered adverse events if they require intervention,
suspension or discontinuation of investigational product.
Serious Adverse Event Definition
The definitions and reporting requirements of Health Canada/the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)/ Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)/ICH Guidelines for Clinical Safety Data
Management, Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, Topic E2A will be adhered to.
If any AEs are serious, as defined by [CONTACT_78454], required procedures
will be followed.
All SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor (or delegate) via fax or e-mail within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the event, whether or not the serious events are deemed IP-related.
All serious event reporting will adhere to ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and
ICH E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited
Reporting.: The ERB/IRB will be notified of the Alert Reports as per HC, FDA, ICH and the
IRB/ERB’s policies and procedures. Refer to the Safety Reporting Instructions for SAE
reporting.
An SAE is any AE that in the view of either the PI [INVESTIGATOR_27362], results in any of the following
outcomes: Death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318251], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to
conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events
that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_318252], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and
Protocol ARQ-252-[ADDRESS_391679] caused death.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4592]:
•Rehabilitation facilities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78428] (e.g., caregiver relief)
•Nursing homes or skilled nursing facilities
•Emergency room visits
•Same day surgeries (as outpatient/same day/ambulatory procedures)
•<24 hour admissions for observation or evaluation
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4595] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_2505], clinical AE is
not in itself an SAE. Examples include:
•Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen
•Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_78429], social, and/or convenience admissions
•Pre-planned treatments or surgical procedures should be noted in the history
documentation for the individual subject.
•Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AEs;
however, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be
reported if it occurs during the reporting period and meets the definition of an AE. For
example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be
reported as an AE, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the
AE.
Unexpected is defined as an AE that is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the specificity or
severity that has been observed; or is not consistent with the risk information described in the
general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current study documentation.
If a SAE occurs to a subject on this study, contact [CONTACT_318288].
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R)
This is defined as a serious adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent
with the known study treatment information. A serious event or reaction is not defined as a
S[LOCATION_003]R when: ‘it is serious but expected’ or it does not fit the definition of an SAE, whether
expected or not.
Protocol ARQ-252-[ADDRESS_391680]
At each follow-up visit, subjects will be queried with an open-ended question such as:
‘How have you been feeling since your last visit?’ Additionally, the study staff will review
subject diaries and, if it appears that a potential AE was recorded, study staff will query the
subject and determine if an AE occurred.
AEs (whether serious or non-serious) and clinically significant abnormal laboratory test value(s)
will be evaluated by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_78430]/or followed up for up to one month after end of
treatment until the symptoms or value(s) return to normal, or acceptable levels, as judged by [CONTACT_51336].
Where appropriate, medical test(s) and/or examination(s) will be performed to document
resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal
or unknown (lost to follow-up).
Adverse Event Reporting
AEs will be collected following informed consent of the subject through subject study
completion.
The Investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to investigational product
treatment (unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, likely). Each sign or symptom reported will be
graded on the NIH NCI CTCAE (Version 5.0) toxicity grading scale 5-point severity scale
(Grade 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). The date and time of onset, time relationship to drug dosing, duration,
and outcome (resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown/lost to follow-up) of
each event will be noted.
The relationship of each AE to the investigational product will be assessed using the following
definitions:
Unrelated •The AE must clearly be caused by [CONTACT_423]’s clinical state, or the study
procedure/conditions.
•Definitely not related to drug.
•Temporal sequence of AE onset relative to administration of drug not reasonable.
•Another obvious cause of an AE.
Unlikely •Time sequence is unreasonable.
•There is another more likelycause for an AE.
Possibly •Corresponds to what is known about the drug.
•Time sequence is reasonable.
•Could have been due to another equally, likelycause.
Probably •Is a known effect of the drug.
•Time sequence from taking drug is reasonable.
•Ceases on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1478].
•Cannot be reasonablyexplained by[CONTACT_20612]’s clinical state.
Likely •Is a known effect of the drug (e.g., listed in Physicians' Desk Reference, Compendium of

AEs will be coded using the most current MedDRA®version available at the start of the study
(e.g., 21.0 or higher).
Reporting Pregnancy
During the study, all subjects should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_318289] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If pregnancy is
confirmed, Investigational Product must be discontinued immediately, the subject should be
referred to an obstetrician experienced in reproductive toxicity for evaluation and counseling,
and the subject should be followed until conclusion of the pregnancy. Subject may be required to
sign a separate informed consent form to obtain pregnancy follow-up information, per local
requirements.
The Investigator is responsible for reporting all available pregnancy information on the
pregnancy report and submitting to the Medical Monitor within [ADDRESS_391681] Research Organization’s Standard
Operating Procedures, which are written based on the principles of GCP.
Statistical Methods
The methodology presented below is a summary of the more detailed analysis plan that will be
presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The SAP will be finalized before the database
is locked and unblinded. Any changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be
described and justified in the clinical study report.
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS®(Version 9.4) unless otherwise stated.
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the safety, efficacy, and
pharmacokinetic results. For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of subjects in
each category will be presented. The denominator for percentage will be based on the number of
subjects appropriate for the purpose of analysis. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics
will include n (number of subjects), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum,
and maximum.
Missing efficacy data for IGA will be imputed using multiple imputation.
The primary statistical comparisons and secondary endpoints will be made at the
0.10 significance level and will not be adjusted for multiple comparisons.
Determination of Sample Size
Cohort 1 will include approximately 6 evaluable subjects, which is deemed adequate for the
purpose of evaluating safety and PK prior to Cohort 2.
There are approximately 215 subjects planned for Cohort 2. Approximately 61 subjects will
receive ARQ-252 cream 0.3% QD, approximately 61 subjects will receive ARQ-252 cream 0.3%
BID, approximately 31 subjects will receive ARQ-252 cream 0.1% QD, approximately 31
subjects will receive matching vehicle cream QD, and approximately 31 subjects will receive
vehicle cream BID. The randomization scheme will be 2:2:1:1:1 between these 5 treatment
groups, stratified by [CONTACT_318264].
The primary statistical comparisons will be to assess the ARQ-252 cream 0.3% group BID group
versus the vehicle BID group, to assess the ARQ-252 cream 0.3% QC group versus the vehicle
QD group, and to assess the ARQ-252 cream 0.1% QD group versus the vehicle QD group.
A sample size of 55 per active arm and 28 per vehicle arm will provide approximately 85%
power at the 2-sided 10% significance level to detect a difference in the rate of subjects attaining
an IGA score of clear or almost clear (for each ARQ-252-treated group versus vehicle group
within the same daily dosing frequency), assuming an active treatment response rate of 45% and
a vehicle response rate of 15%. This is based on a 2-group X2test of equal proportions
(without continuity correction). With a 10% dropout rate, the sample size for the study would be
increased to 61 subjects per active arm and 31 subjects per vehicle arm (215 subjects total).

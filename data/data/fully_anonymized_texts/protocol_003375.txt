Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  STUDY  SUMMARY    
 
Methodology  Phase  II exploratory  randomized  controlled  trial (RCT)  
Coordinating  Center  Center  for Evidence -Based  Orthopaedics  (CEO) , McMaster  
University,  Hamilton,  ON 
Clinical  Site R Adams  Cowley  Shock  Trauma  Center  (STC) , Baltimore,  
MD 
Primary  Aim The primary  objective  is to determine  the effect  of vitamin  D3 
supplementation  on fracture  healing  at 3 months . 
Secondary  Aim The secondary  objective  is to determine  if 25-hydroxy  vitamin  
D [25(OH)D ] serum  levels  are associated  with fracture  healing  
at [ADDRESS_182300]  to 
determine  the optimal  vitamin  D3 dosing  regimen  to reduce  re-
operations  for fracture  healing  complications  in healthy  adult  
patients.   
Diagnosis  and Main  
Inclusion  Criteria  Healthy adults  ages 18-50 years  with non-osteoporotic  
femoral or tibial shaft  fracture s who are treated  with 
intramedullary  fixation  will be enrolled . Only  acute  fractures  
will be eligible.  
Treatment  Groups  and 
Study  Products  Each  participant  will be randomized  to 1 of 4 treatment  
groups:  1) 150,000  IU loading  dose vitamin  D3 plus daily  dose 
placebo;  2) loading  dose placebo  plus 4,000  IU vitamin  D3 per 
day; 3) loading  dose placebo  plus 600 IU vitamin  D3 per day; 
or 4) loading  dose placebo  plus daily  dose placebo . All doses  
of vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be provided  in a 
blinded  manner.  The daily  treatment  will commence  within  1 
week  of injury  and will be taken  for 3 months.   The loading  
dose vitamin  D3 supplements/ placebo  will be given  within [ADDRESS_182301]-injury.  All doses  of vitamin  
D3 and the placebo  will be obtained  from  Bio-Tech  Pharmacal,  
Inc. (Fayetteville,  AK).  
Length  of Follow -Up  The primary  outcome  will be assessed  at [ADDRESS_182302]-
fracture.  Participants  will be followed  for 12 months.

  Study  Outcomes  Fracture  healing  (primary  outcome)  will be assessed  as 
follows : 1) clinical  fracture  healing  will be measured  using  the 
Function  IndeX  for Trauma  (FIX -IT), 2) radiographic  fracture  
healing  will be measured  using  the Radiographic  Union  Score  
for Tibial  fractures  (RUST),  and 3) biological  fracture  healing  
will be measured  using  serum  levels  of cross -linked  C-
terminal  telopeptides  of type I collage n (CTX)  and amino -
terminal  procollagen  propeptides  of collagen  type I (PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]).   
 
The secondary  outcome  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_35755]  
25(OH)D  serum  levels .  Correlations  will be assessed  between  
participants ’ 25(OH)D  levels  at enrolment , changes  in 
25(OH)D  levels  from  enrolment  to 3 months,  and 25(OH)D  
levels  at 3 months  and fracture  healing  as described  above . 
 
The other  secondary  outcomes  will include  assessing  
supplementation  adherence  between  daily  and loading  doses,  
confirming  participant  safety  as measured  by [CONTACT_157588]  
(AEs ) and serum  levels  of calcium  and parathyroid  hormone  
(PTH),  and assessing  protocol  adherence  (e.g. completion  of 
outcome  assessment  and participant  follow -up). 
Sample  Size [ADDRESS_182303]  therapy  is grounded  in the high hypovitaminosis  D prevalence  
rates  (up to 75%)  among  healthy  adult  fracture  patients,1 and the strong  biologic  rationale  
for the role of vitamin  D in fracture  healing.2–[ADDRESS_182304]  
demonstrated  that the concentration  of vitamin  D metabolites  is higher  at a fracture  callus  
compared  to the uninjured  contralateral  bone,3–[ADDRESS_182305],  the pre-clinical  data are 
compelling  and worthy  of further  investigation.  
 
With  modern  orthopaedic  surgical  care,  rates  of complications  following  tibia and femoral  
shaft  fractures  can be as high as 15%.  Complications,  including  delayed  union,  nonunion,  
or infection  often  require  secondary  surgical  procedures7–9 and result  in profound  personal  
and societal  economic  costs.10–[ADDRESS_182306]  biologic  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  such as vitamin  D.14–16  
 
A recent  survey  of 397 orthopaedic  surgeons  showed  that only 26% routinely  prescribe  
vitamin  D supplementation  to adult  fracture  patients.17 Of the 93 surgeons  who indicated  
that they routinely  prescribe  vitamin  D supplementation,  29 different  dosing  regimens  were  
described  ranging  from  low daily  doses  of 400 IU to loading doses  of 600,000  IU.17 This 
suggests  a high level  of clinical  uncertainty  surrounding  the use and optimal  dose of 
vitamin  D supplementation  in adult  fracture  patients.  If vitamin  D supplementation  
improves  fracture  healing  outcomes,  then there  is a large  opportunity  to increase  its use; 
however,  before  widespread  adoption  occurs,  research  is needed  to optimize  the dosing  
strategy,  establish  the dosing  safety  in the immobili zed fracture  healing  population,  and 
overcome  potential  medication  adherence  issues  among  the often -marginalized  patients  
that suffer  trauma.  
 
The long-term goal of our research  program  is to conduct  a large  phase  III RCT  to 
determine  which  dose of vitamin  D3 supplementation  optimally  improves  acute  fracture  
healing  outcomes  in healthy  adult  patients  (18-50 years).  The current  proposed  phase  II 
exploratory  trial will perform  important  preliminary  work  to test the central  hypothesis  that 
vitamin  D3 dose and timing  of administration  is critical  for improving  fracture  healing  at [ADDRESS_182307] . This trial is 
registered  at clinicaltrials.gov  (Identifier  number:  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

at 3 months .  Fracture  healing  will be assessed  as follows : 1) clinical  fracture  healing  will 
be measured  using  the Function  IndeX for Trauma  (FIX -IT),18 2) radiographic  fracture  
healing  will be measured  using  the Radiographic  Union  Score  for Tibial  fractures  
(RUST),19–22 and 3) biological  fracture  healing  will be measured  using  serum  levels  of 
cross -linked  C-terminal  telopeptides  of type I collagen  (CTX)  and amino -terminal  
procollagen  propeptides  of collagen  type I (PI[INVESTIGATOR_680]).23  
 
2.2 Secondary  Aim 
The secondary  aim is to determine  if 25(OH)D  serum  levels  are associated  with fracture  
healing  at [ADDRESS_182309]  to determine  the optimal  vitamin  D3 dosing  regimen  to reduce  re-
operations  for fracture  healing  complications  in healthy  adult  patients.   
 
2.4 Hypotheses  for the Primary  and Secondary  Objectives  
Primary  Objective:  Lower  extremity  shaft  fractures  heal via callus  formation  and 
secondary  bone  healing.  This seminal  process  begins  within  a few weeks  of injury  and 
vitamin  D metabolites  have  been extensively  implicated  in this stage  of healing.  During  
these  early  weeks,  circulating  vitamin  D levels  are most  likely  to be critical  to bone  healing;  
therefore,  we hypothesize:   
1) High  doses  (loading  or daily)  will increase  healing  compared  to low daily  dose. Using  
high doses  will rapi[INVESTIGATOR_157572]  D available  during  fracture  
callus  formation.   
2) High  loading  dose increases  healing  comp ared to high daily  dose.  Loading  doses  will 
overcome  medication  adherence  issues  and increase  circulating  vitamin  D even  more  
rapi[INVESTIGATOR_157573].   
3) Low daily  dose will increase  healing  compared  to placebo . While  the low daily  dose is 
not expected  to increase  circulating  vitamin  D as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_157574],  
this comparison  will determine  if rapid  serum  increases  are necessary  to improve  
fracture  healing.   
 
Secondary  Objective:  Based  on experimental  data and the role of vitamin  D on bone  
metabolism,  a correlation  between  circulating  vitamin  D levels  and fracture  healing  is 
expected;  however,  the efficacy  of various  supplementation  strategies  may be dependent  
on the patient’s  baseline  vitamin  D status  or other  related  changes.  For example,  it is known  
that the dose response  of supplementation  varies  depending  on the patient’s  serum  
25(OH)D  levels , with larger  increases  seen in patients  with serum  levels  <20ng/ml .

Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  3.0 METHODS  
 
3.1 Study  Setting  
This study  will be coordinated  jointly  by [CONTACT_157587],  R Adams  Cowley  
Shock  Trauma  Center  (STC),  Baltimore , MD and McMaster  University,  Center  for 
Evidence -Based  Orthopaedics  (CEO),  Hamilton,  ON. Patients  will be enrolled  from  the 
STC. The CEO will be responsible  for the protocol,  data management , and data analysis.    
 
3.2 Eligibility  Criteria  
The inclusion  criteria  are: 1) adult  men or women  ages 18-50 years;  2) closed  or low grade  
open  (Gustilo  type I or II) tibial or femoral  shaft  fracture ;24 3) fracture  treated  with a 
reamed,  locked,  intramedullary  nail; 4) acute  fracture  (enrolled  within  7 days of injury);  
and 5) provision  of informed  consent.  Fifty  years  was selected  as the upper  age limit to 
minimize  potential  confounding  with post-menopausal  endocrine  changes  that affect  bone  
metabolism.  For the purposes  of the study,  femoral  shaft  fractures  will be defined  as any 
injury  in which  the majority  of fracture  line is distal  to the lesser  trochanter  and proximal  
to the distal  metaphyseal  flare of the femoral  condyles  (Figure  1). Intertochanteric  
extension  or distal  articular  extension  is permitted.  Similarly,  a tibial  shaft  fractur e will be 
defined  as an injury  with a primary  fracture  line between  the proximal  meta -diaphyseal  
flare to the distal  metaphyseal  region  ending  one joint width  proximal  to the tibial  plafond  
(Figure  2). Intra -articular  extension  is permitted.  
 
The exclusion  criteria  are: 1) osteoporosis;  2) stress  fractures;  3) elevated  serum  calcium  
(>10.5  mg/dL);  4) atypi[INVESTIGATOR_157575]  (ASBMR)  criteria;25 5) pathological  fractures  secondary  to neoplasm  or 
other  bone  lesion;  6) patients  with known  or likely  undiagnosed  disorders  of bone  
metabolism  such as Paget’s  disease,  osteomalacia,  osteopetrosis,  osteogenesis  imperfecta  
etc.; 7) patients  with hyperhomocysteinemia;  8) patients  with an allergy  to vitamin  D or 
another  contraindication  to being  prescribed  vitamin  D; 9) patients  currently  taking  an over 
the counter  multivitamin  that contains  vitamin  D and are unable  or unwilling  to discontinue  
its use for this study;  10) patients  who will likely  have  problems,  in the judgment  of the 
investigators , with maintaining  follow -up; 11) pregnancy;  12) patients  who are 
incarc erated;  13) patients  who are not expected  to survive  their injuries;  and 14) other  lower  
extremity  injuries  that prevent  bilateral  full weight -bearing  by [ADDRESS_182310]-fracture.  
 
Patients  with multiple  injuries  or multiple  tibial  and femoral  shaft  fractures  will be eligible  
for inclusion;  however,  only the most  severe  eligible  fracture  will be included  (as 
determined  by [CONTACT_157589]26 and the Gustilo  classification  system  for open  
fractures).24    
 
3.3 Recruitment  Strategy  and Patient  Screening  
All patients  presenting  to participating  surgeons  between  the ages of 18 to 50 years  with a 
tibial  or femoral  shaft  fracture  will be screened.  Potentially  eligible  patients  will be 
approach ed to participate  in the trial. All screened  patients  will be classified  as included  or 
exclud ed.

Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018   
3.4 Randomization  Methods   
Each  participant  will be randomized  to 1 of 4 treatment  groups:  1) 150,000  IU loading  dose 
vitamin  D3 plus daily  dose placebo;  2) loading  dose placebo  plus 4,000  IU vitamin  D3 per 
day; 3) loading  dose placebo  plus 600 IU vitamin  D3 per day; or 4) loading  dose placebo  
plus daily  dose placebo . The daily  vitamin  D3 supplements/ placebo  will be provided  in a 
blinded  manner . The daily  treatment  will commence  within  1 week  of injury  and will be 
taken  for 3 months .  The loading  dose vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be given  within  
1 week  of injury  and at 6 weeks  (+/- 2 week s) post-injury.   
 
Allocation  to the 4 study  groups  will be concealed  using  a centralized  24-hour 
computerized  randomization  system  that will allow  internet -based  allocation.  The 
treatment  allocation  will be stratified  on the following  prognostic  factors  to ensure  balance  
between  the intervention  groups:  fracture  type (closed  vs. open)  and long bone  fracture  
(tibia  vs. femur) . 
 
3.5 Vitamin  D3 (Cholecalciferol)  Treatment  Groups  
3.5.[ADDRESS_182311]  of 3 capsules  that are identical  to the 50,000  IU capsules  
with no active  ingredient . The loading  dose vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be given  
within 1 week  of injury  and at 6 weeks  (+/- 2weeks)  post-injury  while  in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157576] .  
 
The daily  vitamin  D3 supplements/placebo  will be provided  in a blinded  manner  and the 
daily  treatment  will commence  within  1 week  of injury.   The daily  doses  (4,000  IU, 600 
IU, and placebo)  will be identical  and will be comprised  of one capsule .  Patients  will be 
given  a bottle  of either  active  vitamin  D3 or placebo  capsules  and will be instructed  to take 
one capsule  daily  for [ADDRESS_182312] no active  ingredients  and 
will be identi cal to the vitamin  D capsules.  To measure  supplementation  adherence,  
participants  will be asked  to bring their bottles  to their follow -up visits.  At the 3-month  
visit,  participants  will return  their bottle  to the clinical  research  coordinator .  If the 
participant  does not return  the bottle,  the clinical  research  coordinator  will provide  them  
with an enve lope to return  it via mail.   
 
All doses  of vitamin  D and placebo  will be obtained  from  Bio-Tech  Pharmacal,  Inc. 
(Fayetteville,  AK).  The unblinding  protocol  can be found  in Figure  3. Following  the 
completion  of the study,  participants  may be unblinded  their treatment  group  upon  request.   
 
3.5.2  Vitamin  D3 dose rationale  
The doses  selected  are based  on biologic  rationale,  current  practice  patterns,  and existing  
guidelines.  The goal of the high dose arms  is to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_157577]  D and 
serum  25(OH)D  during  the early  callus  fracture  healing  periods.  Conversely,  while  the low 
daily  dose is not expected  to increase  circulating  vitamin  D as quickly  as the high dose 
strategies,  this treatment  arm will determine  if rapid  serum  increases  are necessary  to 
improve  fracture  healing.  Finally,  the placebo  control  arm is needed  to demonstrate  the 
Page  [ADDRESS_182313]  trauma  centers  in North  America.   
• High  loading  dose:  150,[ADDRESS_182314]-operative  clinical  follow -up schedule.  This 
is important  for generalizability  and is likely  to overcome  potential  supplementation  
adherence  issues  within  the adult  fracture  population  that is often  predominantly  lower  
socioeconom ic patients.  This high loading  dose is also in the mid-range  of other  
previous  large  loading  doses  used safely  in fracture  patients  and is similar  to the total 
cumulative  3-month  dose of our high daily  dose group.   
• High  daily  dose:  4,000  IU D3 represents  an alternative  high dose strategy  and it 
corresponds  to the tolerable  upper  daily  intake  level  suggested  by [CONTACT_157590]  (IOM).27 While  this is the IOM’s  upper  limit, the Endocrine  Society  has 
recommended  adults  can safely  take up to 10,000  IU per day,28 further  suggesting  that 
our 4,000  IU dose should  be well-tolerated.   
• Low daily  dose:  600 IU D3 is a common  dose and approved  indication  for maintaining  
general  bone  health.  600 IU is also the IOM’s  Recommended  Dietary  Allowance  for 
all individuals  ages 1-[ADDRESS_182315] shown  its efficacy  for increasing  serum  25(OH)D  levels.  
• Placebo:  Finally,  we are including  a placebo  group  because  it is important  to include  
placebo -controlled  comparisons  to our active  supplements  during  this exploratory  
phase  of research.  Not only does placebo  reflect  our usual clinical  practice  of no 
supplementation,  this Phase  II comparison  will define  our rationale  and selection  of the 
control  group  for the definitive  trial. If there  are no preliminary  efficacy  differences  
between  low dose supplementation  and placebo,  then the low dose supplement  could  
be used as the control  group  in the Phase  III trial. This would  obviate  potential  
criticisms  for performing  a Phase  III placebo -controlled  trial in a population  with a high 
prevalence  of hypovitaminosis  D. Given  the small  numbe r of patients  receiving  placebo  
(n=24),  the Phase  II screening  design  of this trial, and the fact that receiving  placebo  
does not represent  an increased  risk of study  participation  since  it is our standard  
clinical  practice,  we do not believe  this poses  an ethical  concern.  We have used a similar  
rationale  to explain  the placebo  blinding  in the FAITH -[ADDRESS_182316]  operating  procedures  at the STC,  the study  supplements /placebo  will 
be stored  at room  temperature  in accordance  with the manufacturer’s  recommendations.  
The research  personnel  will maintain  an inventory  and temperature  log to ensure  the 
integrity  of the supplements.  Study  supplementation  will begin  within  [ADDRESS_182317]  previous  experience  administering  vitamin  D supplements /placebo  to study  patients  
at the recruiting  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307],  the STC. 
 
3.5.4  Potential  adverse  events  associated  with vitamin  D 
A recent  systematic  review  comprehensively  examined  the effectiveness  and safety  of 
vitamin  D supplementation  among  all ages of adult  fracture  patients.27 The majority  of 
research  has been  performed  in elderly  fracture  populations;  however,  the safety  of a wide  
range  of doses  is well established.  Studi es with doses  of 4,[ADDRESS_182318] been  used 
without  complication.29  
 
Since  vitamin  D regulates  PTH  and serum  calcium  levels,  it is theoretically  possible  that 
vitamin  D supplementation  could  lead to hypercalcemia.  Of the 1,088  patients  included  in 
the systematic  review,  4 cases  of hypercalcemia  were  reported  (0.4%).[ADDRESS_182319]  to observe  this adverse  event  (AE) in our [ADDRESS_182320] that supplementation  in the non-
osteoporotic  fracture  population  has not been extensively  studied  (highlighting  the need for 
the proposed  research),  or because  these  concerns  regarding  the risk of falls do not apply  
to healthy  adults  without  osteoporosis.   
 
3.5.[ADDRESS_182321]-Operative  Rehabilitation  
3.6.1  Surgical  technique  
The study  protocol  will not dictate  the surgical  technique.  Based  on the study’s  eligibility  
criteria,  all participants  must  receive  a reamed,  locked,  intramedullary  nail for their tibial  
or femoral  shaft  fracture.  The number  and orientation  of locking  screws is at the discretion  
of the treating  surgeon , as there  have been  no studies  that demonstrate  clinical  superiority

fracture.  
 
3.7 Primary  and Secondary  Outcome  Measur es 
3.7.1  Primary  outcome  
Fracture  healing  will be assessed  as follows : 1) clinical  fracture  healing  will be measured  
using  FIX-IT, 2) radiographic  fracture  healing  will be measured  using  the RUST,  and 3) 
biological  fracture  healing  will be measured  using  serum  levels  of CTX  and PI[INVESTIGATOR_680].  
 
Clinical  Healing:  FIX-IT is a standardized  measure  of weight -bearing  and pain in patients  
with lower  extremity  fractures,  specifically  tibia and femur  fractures.18 Prelimina ry 
validation  of the FIX-IT has demonstrated  high inter-rater agreement  and moderate  
correlation  with the physical  scores  of the Short  Form -36.18 It has been  used in other  studies  
to assess  clinical  fracture  healing.  
 
Radiographic  Healing : The RUST  score  assesses  the presence  of bridging  callus  or a 
persistent  fracture  line on each of 4 cortices.19–[ADDRESS_182324] greater  inter-rater reliability  when  compared  with surgeons’  general  
impression  of the cortical  bridging .19–[ADDRESS_182325]  has been  widely  used to assess  radiographic  
fracture  healing.19–[ADDRESS_182326]  score.  
 
Biological  Healing:  CTX  is a bone -resorption  marker  and previous  research  has found  that 
it rises [ADDRESS_182327]  the 1-year fracture  union  rate to be approximately  95% 
for the femur  fractures32 and 75% for the tibia fractures  (unpublished  data from  the SPRINT  
trial),7 improved  early  fracture  healing is biologically  plausible.  The median  time to 
fracture  union  for tibia fractures  is 4 months;  therefore,  many  patients  are still experiencing  
morbi dity from  their injury  at the 3-month  visit and decreasing  the time to union  would  be 
an important  patient  benefit.

Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  3.7.2  Secondary  outcome  
The secondary  outcome  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_35755]  25(OH)D  serum  levels.   
Correlations  will be assessed  between  participants ’ 25(OH)D  levels  at enrolment,  changes  
in 25(OH)D  levels  from  enrolment  to 3 months,  and 25(OH)D  levels  at 3 months  and 
fracture  healing  as described  above.  
 
3.7.3  Other  secondary  outcomes  
The other  secondary  outcomes  will include  assessing  supplementation  adherence  between  
daily  and loading  doses,  confirming  participant  safety  as measured  by [CONTACT_157591]  (PTH),  and assessing  protocol  adherence  (e.g. 
completion  of outcome  assessment  and participant  follow -up). 
 
Adherence  with vitamin  D supplementation  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_157592]-report,  by 
[CONTACT_157593] -up, and by [CONTACT_157594].  
 
Participant  safety  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_2695],  defined  as any symptom,  sign,  illness,  or 
experience  that develops  or worsens  in severity  during  the course  of this study .  Within  the 
AEs collected,  fracture  healing  complications  will be identified,  and will include  nonunion  
(defined  as failure  of the fracture  to progress  towards  healing  for [ADDRESS_182328]-fracture),  delayed  union  (defined  as a failure  of progression  of 
fracture  healin g beyond  the expected  median  healing  time of 4 months  with pain at the 
fracture  site),  hardware  failure  (defined  as broken  or bent nail or locking  screw),33 wound  
healing problems  (previously  published  criteria  by [CONTACT_157595]  2005),  and infection  (superficial  
and deep  as defined  by [CONTACT_157596]  (CDC)  criteria).  Wound  
healing  problems  and infection  are a part of the composite  fracture  healing  complication  
outcome  because  previous  animal  and infectious  disease  clinical  research  has suggested  
that vitamin  D can improve  wound  healing and reduce  infections.34–[ADDRESS_182329]  results  of the 
participants’  pre-operative  metabolic  profile.  These  data will be used to understand  the 
baseline  metabolic  health  of the participants  and will be used as needed  in the event  of 
suspected  AEs.   
 
Participant  adherence  with the protocol  will be assessed  by [CONTACT_157597] , including  clinic  assessments  (FIX -IT), radiographs  (RUST),  and blood  
work  (CTX,  PI[INVESTIGATOR_680],  25(OH)D,  calcium,  and PTH) , documentation  of AEs and re-operations,  
and completion  of follow -up to 12 months.    
 
3.7.4 Data  collection  and participant  follow -up 
Upon  providing  informed  consent,  baseline  demographics  will be collected  from  the patient  
and from  their medical  chart  (Table 1). This includes  demographic,  medical  history,  pre-
operative  blood  work -up details  (e.g. kidney  and liver function  tests,  calcium,  phosphate,  
and albumin),  injury  details,  fracture  characteristics,  details  on the surgical  management  of 
their fracture , and rehabilitation  details . Participants  will have blood  drawn  within  the 
fracture  clinic  that will be analyzed  for calcium  levels  and for CTX,  PI[INVESTIGATOR_680],  25(OH)D,  and 
Page  15 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  PTH  (See Section  3.7.5) .  Post-operative  x-rays will be taken  as per standard  of care (See 
Section  3.7.6).   
 
Participants  will be followed  at standard  clinical  visit intervals  for [ADDRESS_182330]-injury  
including  6 week s, 3 months,  6 months,  9 months,  and 12 months.   The Schedule  of Events  
(Table  1) details  the requirements  and procedures  for each visit.   Participants  will have  
blood  drawn  within  the fracture  clinic  that will be analyzed  for calcium , CTX,  PI[INVESTIGATOR_680],  
25(OH)D,  and PTH  serum  levels  at 6 weeks  and 3 months  (See Section  3.7.5).   Post-
operativ e x-rays will be taken  as per standard  of care at each follow -up visit (See Section  
3.7.6).   Participants  will be assessed  clinically  for FIX-IT at each visit.  All study  outcomes  
(as defined  above)  will be documented  on the case report  forms  (CRFs)  at each follow -up 
visit.  A 12-month  follow -up was selected  because  is a standard  follow -up period  for 
patients  with tibial  and femoral  shaft  fractures  and it is a commonly  used follow -up period  
for similar  fracture  trials.7,[ADDRESS_182331].   
 
3.7.5  Analysis  of blood  samples  
Serum  calcium  testing  will be performed  by [CONTACT_5035][INVESTIGATOR_157578].  The remainder  of serum  samples  (PTH , 
25(OH)D,  PI[INVESTIGATOR_680],  CTX)  will be analyzed  in a blinded  manner  at the end of the study.  
Laboratory  personnel  at the University  of Maryland’s  Muscle  Research  Laboratory  will 
process  the samples  for storage  in the -80 C freezer . Upon  completion  of all blood  work  
for the study,  the serum  samples  will be transferred  to the Institute  for Clini cal and 
Translational  Research  Clinical  Research  Unit Core  Laboratory  to be analyzed  as a single  
batch  to eliminate  inter-batch  assay  variability.   The results  of the analy ses will be sent to 
the CEO  to be added  to the REDCap  study  database  and included  within  the final data 
analysis.  The treating  surgeon  will remain  blinded  to these  results.  Participants  may request  
the results  of their blood  analysis  at the end of the study.  
 
3.7.6  Analysis  of radiographs  
The radiographs  will be stored  in the STC Pi[INVESTIGATOR_157579]  
(PACS)  at the STC and then sent to the CEO  for the review  of radiographic  fracture  healing  
(RUST)  by [CONTACT_157598].   
 
3.8 Participant  Retention  
Once  a participant  is enrolled  in the trial, every  reasonable  effort  will be made  to follow  
the participant  for the entire  duration  of the study  period.   The expected  follow -up rate for 
this study  is greater  than 90% based  on similar  fracture  trials.7,38–[ADDRESS_182332]  implemented  procedures  to improve  participant  
retention  (Figure  4).[ADDRESS_182333]  been exhausted.  
Page  16 of 30 
Version  2.0 12-Mar-2018  We will not remove  participants  from  the study  if the study  protocol  was not adhered  to 
(e.g. participant  received  wrong  treatment  arm, early  discontinuation  of supplement s, 
occurrence  of protocol  deviations,  missed  follow -up visits,  etc.).  We will document  the 
reasons  for participant  withdrawal  from  the trial (e.g. withdrawal  of consent  or lost to 
follow -up). 
 
4.[ADDRESS_182334] been carefully  chosen  to ensure  a 
reasonable  sample  size and meaningful  results.42 Consistent  with previous  
recommendations,  an  and  of 0.20 was chosen  with a target  mean  difference  of 17-20%,  
depending  on the fracture  healing  measure.  There  will be no adjustments  for multiple  
testing  given  the exploratory  nature  of the study  design.  
 
Based  on the original  instrument  development  and validation  in tibia and femur  fracture  
patients,  it is expected  that the low dose and control  groups  will have  a mean  3-month  FIX-
IT score  of 8 (standard  deviation  (SD) 3).18 Assuming  the high dose groups  will achieve  a 
mean  2 point  increase  (17%  mean  difference),  [ADDRESS_182335]  instrument  
based  on similar  assumptions  and recent  literature  (2 point  mean  difference,  8 vs. 6, SD

in a previous  study  of tibia fracture  healing,  Veitch  et al observed  concentrations  of both 
bone  turnover  markers  approximately  100%  greater  than baseline  values.[ADDRESS_182336]  a mean  
difference  of 20% (SD 30%).  Finally,  the sample  size will be increased  to account  for a 
10% loss to follow -up, for a total enrolment  of 24 patients  per allocation  group  (96 total).  
 
4.2 Statistical  Methods  
All outcome  analyses  will be exploratory  and adhere  to the intention -to-treat principle.   As 
treated  sensitivity  analyses  will also be conducted.  
 
4.2.1  Specific  Aim  
Each  measure  of fracture  healing  will be described  with its mean  and SD. For our primary  
analysis , comparisons  for the 3 hypotheses  (Section  2.4) will be made  using  an independen t 
t-test and significance  set at =0.20 (Table  2). Hypothesis  [ADDRESS_182337] this hypothesis,  we will combine  the two high 
dose groups  (loading  and daily)  for a 2:[ADDRESS_182338]  the low daily  dose group.  All 
other  comparisons  will be 1:[ADDRESS_182339] the hypotheses  of the Secondary  Aim,  univariate  analyse s will be used to explore

Significance  will be set at =0.20 . Additional  descriptive  analyses  will be performed  for 
serum  25(OH)D  at each time point  (Table  3).  
 
4.2.3  Other  Secondary  Outcomes  
All other  secondary  outcomes  will be presented  using  point  estimates  and appropriate  
measures  of variance  to describe  supplementation  adherence,  participant  safety,  and key 
aspects  of participant  complianc e with the protocol  (Table  4). Supplement  adherence  will 
be summarize d using  means  and 95% confidence  intervals  for participant  self-reporting  
and the mean  cumulative  dose taken  at [ADDRESS_182340] ications  in each group  will be described  with counts  and 
proportions.  Serum  levels  of calcium  and PTH  will be summarized  using  means  and 95% 
CIs. Participant  compliance  with the protocol  will be summarized  descriptively  with counts  
and proportions.

1. In the event  of a medical  emergency  that directly  affects  the health  status  of the 
participant,  it may become  necessary  to unblind  allocation  status  to determine  the 
specific  treatment  the participant  has received  while  enrolled  in the study.  A 
medical  emergency  is defined  as an event  which  necessitates  immediate  attention  
regarding  the treatment  of a participant.  
2. The clinical  research  coordinator  should  contact  [CONTACT_62674]  (or 
designee)  and provide  details  of the medical  emergency  as soon  as possible  after 
the event.  The principal  investigator  (or designee)  is responsible  for reviewing  and 
approving  all requests  for unblinding.   At no time will the participant’s  health  be 
compromised  or medical  treatment  delayed.   
3. Once  approved,  the clinical  research  coordinator  (or designee)  will contact  [CONTACT_157606]’s  treatment  allocation.   The 
unblinded  Project  Manager  will provide  the clinical  research  coordinator  with the 
participant’s  treatment  allocation.   This information  is to be provided  by [CONTACT_756].   
No information  regarding  treatment  allocation  is to be sent via email  or fax. 
4. The unblinded  personnel  are not to unblind  the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_157584] . 
5. Study  personnel  must  keep  all information  related to the individual  unblinding  
cases  confidential.  
6. All cases  of unblinding  must  be documented,  including:  study  ID, date of 
unblinding,  parties  unblinded,  and reason  for unblinding.

1) We will exclude  individuals  who are likely  to present  problems  with follow -up (see 
exclusion  criteria).   
 
2) At the time of randomization,  as well as their own address  and phone  number,  each 
participant  will provide  the name  [CONTACT_157608],  and the 
name,  address  and phone  number  of 3 people  at different  addresses  with whom  the 
participants  does not live who are likely  to be aware  of the participant’s  whereabouts.  The 
clinical  research  coordinator  will confirm  that these  numbers  are accurate  prior  to the 
participant’s  discharge  from  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].    
 
3) Participants  will receive  reminders  for upcoming  clinic  visits  from  local  study  
personnel.    
 
4) Follow -up schedules  will coincide  with normal  surgical  fracture  clinic  visits.    
 
5) Study  personnel  will contact  [CONTACT_157607]  [ADDRESS_182344]  and obtain  information  about  any planned  change  in residence.

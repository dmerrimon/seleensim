CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023 T-CL201 Amendment 1 
21 January  2015  
 
Protocol UX023T -CL201 (dated [ADDRESS_35120] 2014) has been modified by [CONTACT_11827] 1 to incorporate 
feedback provided by [CONTACT_3133] (FDA) and investigational study sites, 
and to clarify details/schedule of procedures to be conducted in th e study. The protocol changes are 
summarized below:  
1. Study Sites : The number of study sites has been increased from a single site to multiple  
sites.  
Rationale: Due to the rare nature of  TIO/ENS, additional sites may be necessary in order to 
identify enough subjects to fully enroll the study.  
2. Schedule of Events : Updates have been made to the frequency or timing of certain 
assessments as detailed in Table  2.1 and Table  2.2 (Schedule of Events).  In addition, the first 
telephone call was changed to a home health vi sit at Study Week 1 and a new home health 
visit (HHV10.1) was added at Study Week 21.  
Rationale:  Changes have been made to reduce the number of measurements for reasons of 
subject convenience or to clarify differences in specific assessments taken at clin ic visits 
versus home health visits. The sponsor believes the changes in assessment frequency and 
timing will not influence the ability to evaluate the safety and efficacy of study drug.  Home 
health visits 1 and 10.1 will ensure that phosphorus, 1,25(OH) 2D, and calcium will be 
adequately collected and measured throughout the study.   
3. Inclusion Criteria:  Inclusion Criterion #6 ( Section 7.3.1 ) has been modified to show that 
subjects with an  estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR) of ≥30 but <60  mL/min will be 
considered eligible so long as , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871] , the decline in renal function 
is not related to nephrocalcinosis.  
Rationale:  Older adu lt subjects may routinely have e GFR <60 mL/min without there being 
any indication of nephrocalcinosis.  
4. Exclusion Criteria  (Section 7.3.2 ):  
a. Exclusion Criterion #[ADDRESS_35121] shown adverse reactions to declomycin is no longer exclusion ary. 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201  
Amendment 1  
21 January  2015   
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 3 of 67 
Rationale:  Labeling with declomycin is no longer required. Labelling subjects with 2 
rounds of tetracycline HCL prior to each bone biopsy is sufficient to allow the biopsy 
to be read appropriately.   
b. Exclusion Criterion # [ADDRESS_35122] 
safety or difficulty with data interpretation  can be made by [CONTACT_31374].  
Rationale:  Many patients with ENS have a number of potentially confounding 
comorbid ities. To help ensure subject  safety and the integrity of the data collected 
in the study, both the investigator and the sponsor may decide to exclude subject s 
based on these potentially confounding comorbidities.   
5. Bone Biopsy Labeling : Section 7.5 has been modified to show that subjects will be labelled 
with 2 rounds of tetracycline HCL prior to each bone biopsy rather than 1 round of 
declomycine (or equivalen t) followed by 1 round of tetracycline.  
Rationale:  Labeling with declomycin is no longer required. Labelling s ubjects with 2 rounds 
of tetracycline HCL prior to each bone biopsy  is sufficient to allow the biopsy to be read 
appropriately . 
6. Bone Biopsy : Table  2.1 (Schedule of events) has been revised to note that a bone biopsy  is 
not required at the Baseline visit if a previous bone biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of 
osteomalacia, the subjects’ cli nical manifestations have not changed significantly since the 
time of the previous biopsy/diagnosis, and the tissue collected at that biopsy is made 
available for testing for this protocol.   A similar change has been made to Section  7.5. 
Rationale:  It is expected that there would be no significant change in untreated TIO/ENS 
subject s from the time that their original bone biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of 
osteomalacia ; there fore a historical sample can be used as the baseline comparator within 
this study.   
7. Clinical Outcome Measures:  Section [IP_ADDRESS]  has been revised to replace the 6MWT with the 
Sit to Stand (STS) test and the Weighted Arm Lift (WAL) test.  
Rationale:  The 6MWT has been removed because  some subjects  may not be ambulatory 
and thus not  able to complete the test.   
8. Tumor Imaging : Imaging of the tumor ( Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) has been incorporated at the request 
of the FDA. Imaging will be completed at the screening visit, and every 6 months thereafter 
for tumors that are visib le at screening.  
Rationale:  As part of the overall safety assessment of TIO/ENS patients, evaluation of overall 
change in tumor size and volume is being incorporated into this study.  
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201  
Amendment 1  
21 January  2015   
 
 
Proprietary and Confidential  Page 4 of 67 
9. Fasting Serum Phosphate Range : The synopsis and  Sections 7.1, 7.4, and 7.5 were updated 
to change  the target fasting serum phosph ate range from 2.5 – 3.5 mg/dL to 2.5 – 
4.0 mg/dL .  
Rationale:  The fasting serum phosphate range is being expanded to allow for additional 
flexibility . 
10. Bone Scan Assessment of Bone T urnover : Criteria for evaluation were updated ; the bone 
scan will not be utilized to assess bone turnover  and the number of central readers will be 
reduced from three readers to a single reader .  
Rationale:  Due to high sensitivity but low specificity and the undefin ed temporal appearance 
of pseudofracture healing by [CONTACT_15222], bone scan will be used to identify potential 
pseudofractures at BL, wk 24 and wk 48.  For this purpose , a single central reader is deemed 
appropriate. Exploratory analyses of change fro m BL wil l be defined in the SAP .

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023T-CL201 Amendment 2 
14 October 2015 
 
Protocol UX023T-CL201 Amendment 1 (dated 21 January 2015) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 2 to increase the sample size , modify the description of ENS, clarify 
details/schedule of procedures to be conducted in the study, and to make other minor 
modifications . Important protocol changes are summarized below:  
1. Sample Size : In Section 7.1, t he sample size has been increased from approximately 6 to 
approximately 15 adult subjects. 
Rationale: The Sponsor has become aware of additional subjects meeting eligibility criteria. 
2. Description of ENS: 
The description of ENS has been updated throughout the protocol 
to indicate that ENS is not merely a variant of TIO but a distinct congenital disorder of which one syndrome includes F GF23-induced hypophosphatemia and associated 
osteomalacia and  shares a similar biochemical and clinical profile to TIO.  
Rationale: Based on a recent literature review on ENS, it is apparent that unlike the mesenchymal tumors that typi[INVESTIGATOR_35617], epi[INVESTIGATOR_35618] -neoplastic 
hematoma. Further, FGF23 protein or FGF23 mRNA is not detectable in samples of ENS-associated osteomalacia. Both TIO and ENS share the underlying pathophysiology 
of elevated serum FGF23 which leads to hypophosphatemia and the associated metabolic bone disease. Unlike TIO, complete resection and surgical cure leading to removal of the source of excess FGF23 is less likely. Nonetheless, in older literature case reports, there has been documentation of improved phosphorus levels following skin debridement/excision surgery in some but not all cases. ENS lesions may be extensive, often covering 10-60% of the skin. Thus the protocol was updated with this new information. 
3. Primary Efficacy Evaluation
:  Section 7.[ADDRESS_35123] bone biops ies. 
Protocol Number: UX023T-CL201 
Amendment 2 
14 October 2015  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
Rationale: TIO and ENS -associated osteomalacia are clinically heterogeneous ; some 
patients experience substantial bone pain , and muscle weakness is common, but the 
frequency and intensity  of these symptoms vary significant from patient to patient. 
However, all subjects with these disorders have elevated FGF23 levels and consequent 
hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia. Moreover, when surgical treatment of TIO and 
ENS-associated osteomalacia is  successful, serum phosphorus levels normalize and 
osteomalacia resolves . Thus, improvement in serum phosphorus levels and improvement 
in osteomalacia as determined by [CONTACT_35654] e meaningful endpoints to evaluate the efficacy of 
KRN23 treatment in this population of subjects whose tumor or skin lesions are considered inoperable. 
4. Inclusion Criteria
: Inclusion criterion number 4 has been updated to indicate an iFGF23 
level ≥100 pg/mL as measured by [CONTACT_35655]. 
Previously the required FGF23 level was ≥2 times the upper limit of normal. 
Rationale:  A review of the FGF23 assay literature suggested that a normal level was not 
well established for T IO and ENS -associated osteomalacia. A study of FGF23 levels in 
patients with TIO or ENS found that 12 of 13 patients studied had FGF23 levels at or 
above 100 pg/mL  (Ito et al. 2005), thus the Sponsor has selected this level as a reasonable 
cutoff to ensure eligible patients do have elevated FGF23 consistent with TIO or ENS-associated osteomalacia.  
5. Previous Bone Biopsy
: Section 7.5.[ADDRESS_35124] bone biopsy as the Baseline 
bone biopsy assessment . A previous bone biopsy will be acceptable if it was obtained 
within 12 months of Screening, confirmed the diagnosis of osteomalacia, the subjects’ clinical manifestations have not changed significantly since the time of the previous 
biopsy/diagnosis, and the tissue collected at that biopsy is made available for testing for this protocol.  Evaluability of previous bone biopsy specimens must be confirmed by a central reader b efore Baseline.  Dosing may begin once evaluability is confirmed. 
Rationale:  Given that determining the effects of KRN23 on improvement in osteomalacia 
in trans-iliac crest bone bio psies is now a co -primary objective in the study , it is essential 
that a previously obtained bone biopsy is r eflective of a subject’s baseline disease and is 
evaluable for determination of the endpoint. Thus, it will now be required that the biopsy be taken within 12 months of Screening and that its evaluability is confirmed prior to baseline and dosing. 
6. Study Procedures and Assessments
: Section 7.5 has been amended to add or remove 
certain assessments.  
Functional Outcomes and PROs:  The Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT) has been added 
and will be administered at Screening (for practice), Baseline (Day -2), and Weeks 12, 
Protocol Number: UX023T-CL201 
Amendment 2 
14 October 2015  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 
24, and 48 (or Early Termination). The Timed Up and Go (TUG) and WOMAC 
assessments have been removed.  
Rationale:  Testing of initial study subjects has provided insights into the functional 
abilities and limitatio ns of subjects with TIO and ENS-associated osteomalacia leading to 
these changes. Screening data from the initial TUG administrations suggest that the test 
does not appear to be sensitive to the functi onal limitations experienced by  [CONTACT_35656] S-associated osteomalacia as all of the subjects were able to complete the test 
without difficulty.  The TUG has been replaced with the 6MWT, which is longer in duration and requires more energy expenditure for completion.  These features increase the likelihood that the 6MWT will capture the impact of the mobility deficits, bone/joint pain, and muscle weakness experienced by [CONTACT_35657] -associated 
osteomalacia. In addition to the TUG, the WOMAC has been removed due to issues identified during the initial administrations of the PRO measure. A standardized administration of the WOMAC, which was originally developed for use in osteoarthritis, requires the subject to complete all items based on the impact to the hips and/or knees or a single joint.  Subjects have reported difficulty with the identification of a target area 
given the impact of TIO on various bones and joints throughout the body, including the neck, back and upper and lower extremities. Subjects have reported difficulty with the identification of a single joint for assessment given the impact of TIO on various bones and joints throughout the body. The remaining PROs will continue to be administered in the protocol.   
Tumor Imaging:  In Section [IP_ADDRESS], changes have been made to clarify t he methodology 
related to tumor imaging.  Tumor imaging will be done for TIO subjects  only and not 
subjects with ENS -associated osteomalacia. (Assessment of skin lesions in ENS subjects 
is addressed below .) CT and MRI imaging will be performed with the capability of 
assessing tumor size if the tumor is localized. The radiologist will indicate  whether tumor 
size and volume have changed over time. If applicable,  RECIST measurements will be 
done. Rationale:  Many TIO tumors are difficult to localize because they are very small, slow 
growing, and often are in areas of bone or soft tissue which make them difficult to find 
using recommended imaging tools.  Common localization techniques involve the use of high resolution whole body CT or MRI often in combination with FDG PET scans and/or octreotide scans , which are both highly sensitive but not specific. A proportion of the 
patients who will be enrolled in the UX023T-CL201 may not have had their tumor localized. In instances where these tumors were previously localized, these patients may not have responded to surgical excision. I mages from CT/MRI assessments will be 
analyzed for assessment by [CONTACT_35658]. If a lesion is present it is measured and marked with an arrow. 
The radiologist will review and indicate whether tumor size and volume have changed 
over [ADDRESS_35125] scores will be assessed if applicable .

Amendment 2 
14 October 2015  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 5 
Dermatologic Assessment for Subjects with ENS-associated Osteomalacia : 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated to add that s erial photographs of skin lesions will be 
taken at Baseline and  post treatment at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 48 to assess progress in the 
skin lesions over time with KRN23 treatment (ENS subjects only). 
Rationale:  Serial photographs for dermatologic assessment has been added to formally 
capture progress in skin lesions over time as a safety assessment . 
7. Safety Contact [CONTACT_7171]:  The safety contact [CONTACT_35659] 8.5.[ADDRESS_35126] current information.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023T-CL201 Amendment 3 
17 February  2016 
 
Protocol UX023T-CL201 Amendment 2 (dated 14 October 2015) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 3 to extend the study duration by 96 weeks, to clarify assessments in the 
screening  skeletal survey;  to add routine lipase testing and reflexive testing for serum 
amylase isoenzymes if serum amylase levels are elevated ; to update a follow-up period for 
adverse events and duration of effective contraception after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_11743] ; to update an 
inclusion and exclusion criteria; to specify language for tetracycline labeling; to update that 
echocardiogram will be read centrally; and to update disease information for TIO/ENS and 
summary of overall risks and potential benefits of KRN23 to be consistent with the 
Investigator’s Brochure . Important protocol changes are summarized below: 
1. Overall Study Design and Plan: Section  7.1 has been updated to extend the study 
duration. After completing the initial treatment period of the study ( 48 weeks), subjects 
may continue into a planned Treatment E xtension Period  in which subjects will receive 
KRN23 treatment for up to an additional 96 weeks  or until one of the following occurs:  
the study drug is commercially available in the subject’s local territory, the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated.  
Rationale: The goal of the 96-week Treatment Extension Period is to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of KRN23  in patients with TIO /ENS. In eligible patients where  
tumors are considered inoperable due to the location of the tumor or extent of disease or an inability to localize the tumor , hypophosphatemia is a chronic disease. It is expected 
that the maintenance of phosphate control w ill allow for continued healing of 
osteomalacia in patients with TIO/ENS . The 96-week Treatment Extension Period  will 
provide long- term data on safety and efficacy to further characterize the benefit :risk 
profile of KRN23 treatment in this patient population. 
2. Clinical Assessments: Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated to clarify assessments in the 
screening  skeletal survey.  
Rationale: The protocol has been amended to provide clarification and alignment with central imaging requirements with regards to the skeletal survey of the lateral spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], AP chest, right and left hand/wrist, right and left humerus, right and left radius/ulna, right and 
Protocol Number: UX023T-CL201

Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
left femur/pelvis, right and left tibia/fibula, and right and left foot to be obtained at 
screening.  
3. Safety Measurements : Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated to add assessments of serum 
lipase in all subjects and to specify additional laboratory analyses that will be performed 
reflexively  on prospectively drawn specimens if serum amylase levels are elevated to ≥ 2x 
the upper limit of the reference range (ULRR).  
Rationale : Mild asymptomatic elevations in serum amylase have been observed in some 
subjects at baseline and d uring the study. Amylase is produced by [CONTACT_35660]. In ongoing and completed KRN23 studies 
at baseline, mild elevations of a mylase (<2x ULRR) have been noted. Post treatment mild 
shifts in amylase elevation (< 2xULRR) has been noted without association with GI symptoms. No adverse events of pancreatitis have been observed. The reflexive testing for serum amylase isoenzymes when  serum amylase levels are elevated will allow a 
determination of whether the elevations are from pancreatic or salivary gland sources.  
4. Pregnancy Testing and Reporting and Follow- up of Adverse Events : In Section 
[IP_ADDRESS] and Section  8.5, the follow-up period for adverse events (AEs) and duration of 
contraception after the end of the study ha ve been extended from 30 days to 12 weeks.  
Rationale:  Subjects will need to be follow ed for approximately [ADDRESS_35127] consen t to use two forms of effective method of contraception as determined 
by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_35619] 12 weeks (approximately 5 times t he elimination half -life) after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35620]. Language in the inclusion criteria has also been amended to reflect this 
change (see below).  
Additionally, a ll AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs informed consent 
through 12 weeks (approximately 5 times the elimination half -life) following the last 
dose of study drug.  
4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria : An inclusion criterion in Section  7.3.[ADDRESS_35128] been updated.  
Rationale : Inclusion criterion #9 was updated to cl arify that “ subjects must be willing to 
use two forms of effective methods  of contraception while participating in the study 
(sexually active subjects) and for [ADDRESS_35129] dose of study drug.” This change 
is intended to align with the revised Pregnancy Testing and Reporting language in Section [IP_ADDRESS] as described above. In addition, exclusion criterion #9 was updated to 
“Have a history of malignancy within [ADDRESS_35130] (Phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors of the mixed connective tissue type) 
Protocol Number: UX023T-CL201 
Amendment 3 
17 February 2016  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 
tumors or non-melanoma skin cancers such as basal cell skin cancer .” This criterion was 
amended to ensure that t he safety profile of KRN23 can be properly characterized in 
patients with classic TIO (PMT -MCT) before being studied in subjects with TIO- like 
syndrome, such as prostate cancer, lung cancer , etc. 
5. Study Procedures and Assessments : In Section 7.5 and throughout the document, the 
language for use of a tetracycline has been updated to provide clarity.  
Rationale : The current  language in the protocol was narrowly worded to allow use of 
tetracycline h ydrochloride (HCl) to facilitate histomorphometric analysis . To provide 
greater clarity and flexibility, this language has been revised to allow for use of “ a 
tetracycline (e.g., tetracycline hydrochloride ([HCl] and demeclocycl ine).” 
6. Echocardiogram : In Section [IP_ADDRESS], the procedure for assessments of echocardiogram s 
(ECHO) has been revised to central read ing.    
Rationale : ECHO results will be read centrall y rather than at local sites to ensure 
consistent criteria across the study are used to assess ECHO parameters by [CONTACT_31809]. C linically significant abnormalities detected following central ECHO reading 
will be promptly reported to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_35621] . 
7. Overview of the Disease and Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits:  In 
Section 5.2 and Section 5.4, the disease information for TIO/ENS and the summary of 
overall risks and potential benefits of KRN23 have been updated. 
Rationale : The disease description of TIO/ENS and the overall risks and potential 
benefits of KRN23 were revised to reflect the recently updated KRN23 Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) (19 November 2015).

SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023T-CL201 Amendment 4 
10 November 2017 
Protocol UX023T-CL201 Amendment 3 (dated 17 February 2016) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 4 to increase the duration of the Treatment Extension period and add safety 
follow-up telephone calls; update and  clarify the Schedule of Events;  update the clinical 
study background information; update the contraception requirements ; update the maximum 
injection volume of KRN23 ; update the safety reporting language;  and make administrative 
updates regarding the medical monitor and record retention language . Minor edits and 
typographical corrections have also been made. Important protocol changes are summarized 
below: 
1. Study Duration: Section 7.[ADDRESS_35131] been updated to extend t he 
treatment  duration from 140 weeks to up to 216 weeks or until June 30, 2019, plus an 
additional sa fety follow -up period.  
Rationale : The study is being extended until the approximate expected date of 
commercial drug availability  to allow continuation of treatment in these subjects . 
2. Investigational Product Administration : Section [IP_ADDRESS] has been updated to increase 
the maximum volume of KRN23 that may be administered in a single injection from 
1.0 to 1.5 mL and to indicate that rotation of injections may include rotation to a different 
quadrant of the abdomen.  
Rationale: This modification in dosing volume will allow more  flexibility in 
subcutaneous administration of investigational product and more specific info rmation 
about the dosing procedures. 
3. Introduction: In Section  5, Information on Previous and Ongoing Clinical Studies 
(Section 5.3.3) and Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits (Section  5.4) have 
been updated to incorporate t he most recent clinical trial data from the X-linked 
hypophosphatemia ( XLH) program.  
Rationale : Updated to reflect the current ly available clinical data on KRN23 use in XLH  
and TIO. 
4. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment : Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_35132] may be removed if she becomes pregnant during the study or if a 
previously unidentified causal tumor is identified and determined to be amenable to surgical removal.  
Rationale : Experience with KRN23 in pregnant women is limited  and the study drug may 
involve risks to a pregnant female or unborn baby [CONTACT_35661]. Therefore, 
use of a highly effective met hod of contraception is required during the study, and 
Protocol Number: UX023T-CL201 
Amendment [ADDRESS_35133] a tumor that is amenable to complete resection is cons istent with the inclusion criterion requiring a 
tumor that is not amenable to cure by [CONTACT_35662].  
5. Study Procedures and Assessments : Several changes have been made to Section  7.5 
and the Schedules of Events, and a new Schedule of Events  Table 2.4 has been added to 
describe assess ments during Weeks 145 through the End of Study (EOS) visit and the 
Safety Follow -up period . 
a. In Section 7.5 and the Schedules of Events for Screening and Baseline and the 
Treatment Period (Table 2.1 and Table 2.2) , the Day −21, −20, and −[ADDRESS_35134] been revised to  Days −20, −19, and −18 before those 
visits.  
Rationale : The time points for administra tion of the first course of tetracycline before 
biopsy have been made consistent with the Transiliac Bone Biopsy Manual .  
b. A Home Health visit has been added at Week 142 for collection of peak serum phosphorous levels. A dverse events  (AEs), vital signs, and concomitant medications 
will also be recorded.  In addition, peak serum phosphorus levels will be collected 
during the new portion of the extension period (Weeks 145 – End of Study) at Weeks 166, 190, and 214. 
Rationale : To obtain peak serum phosphorus levels at time points later in the study.  
c. Physical Examinations at Home Health visits have been removed during the treatment 
extension period. Physical Examinations will continue to be performed at all site 
visits. 
Rationale : Removing physical examination s will streamline Home Health visits as the 
physical exam is not needed at such frequency . 
d. Anti-KRN23 antibody assessments have been added at site visits (ie, every 24 weeks) 
during the treatment extension period. 
Rationale : The addition of anti- KRN23 antibody assessments will allow ongoing 
monitoring of potential anti-KRN23 antibody formation in subjects during the 
treatment extension period of the study. 
e. Serum KRN23 concentration assessments have been added  at site visits (ie, every 24 
weeks) during the t reatment extension period. 
Rationale : The addition of serum KRN23 assessments will allow ongoing monitoring 
of KRN23 concentrations during the treatment extension period of the study.

f. In Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the Schedules of Events the frequency of t umor imaging during 
the treatment extension period has been changed from once every 6 months to once 
every 12 months. In addition, language has been added to indicate that a historical 
tumor image obtained within 12 months of Screening may be used as the Screening image. The section has also been updated to indicate that when applicable, mint 
Lesion™ software, rather than RECIST, will be used to assess changes in tumor size and volume over time.  Rationale:  Reducing the frequency  of tumor imaging decreases subject burden and 
remains in line with standard medical practice of imaging every 6 -12 months. 
Similarly, use of a historical tumor image within 12 months is consistent with medical practice. Use of the mint Lesion software™ reflects a software update and is most 
applicable to the timing and location of tumor imaging in the study.  
g. Section [IP_ADDRESS]
 and the Schedules of Events have been updated to indicate that for 
subjects with tumor -induced osteomalacia (TIO)  in whom the tumor had not been 
located at baseline, yearly evaluation  will be performed  beginning at Week 120 in an 
attempt to locate the tumor . The preferred imaging technique is 68Ga-DOTATATE 
positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). O ctreotide- SPECT 
(SPECT/CT) or FDG-PT/CT may be used if DOTATATE PET/CT is not available . 
(If none of these methods is available, an other imaging technique may be used at 
investigator discretion .)  
Rationale:  The protocol previously did not specify ongoing attempts at tumor 
identification during the study in those subjects for whom tumors were not identified at baseline. This change clarifies that imaging for potential tumor identification will 
be ongoing during the study.  
h. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) assessment  of the wrist has been removed. 
Rationale:  Wrist DXA was added in Amendment 2 but not implemented so it is being 
removed. DXA of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_35622] 144. 
i. Ambulatory status has been added to the Schedule of Events and to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Ambulatory status at baseline will be retrospectively collected; prospective collection of ambulatory status will begin at the first scheduled site visit following implementation of and consent to this amendment and will continue at all subsequent site visits .  
Rationale : This addition will allow evaluation of functional disability in these 
subjects with TIO and any changes with KRN23 treatment.  
j. Serial photographs of skin lesions in subjects with epi[INVESTIGATOR_35623] 
(ENS)-associated osteomalacia have been removed  as an assessment . Dermatologic 
assessment will continue to be performed as part of the physical examination.  
Protocol Number: UX023T-CL201 
Amendment 4 
10 November 2017  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 5 
Rationale:  Administrative decision given only one subject with ENS- associated 
osteomalacia is enrolled in the study.  
 
6. Study Endpoints:  In Section 7.6.1 the wording of the co-primary endpoint regarding 
histomorphometry assessments has been updated to be: The change  from baseline in 
excess osteoid based on analysis of iliac crest bone biopsies after 48 weeks of KRN23 
treatment using the following  histomorphometric indices: O.T h, OS/BS, OV/BV, and 
MLt. Previously the endpoint had specified percent change  from baseline.  In addition, 
Secondary endpoints of additional measures to assess serum phosphorus levels over time have been updated to indicate that these reflect a Week 24 tim e point. In addition, in the 
synopsis, the description of exploratory endpoints was updated to align with the description of these endpoints in Section 7.6.1 and with the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
Rationale:  Wording was updated to align with the Statistical Analysis Plan v 1.0 (dated 
04 May 2016). 
7. Treatments : Sections 7.1, 7.4.1, and 7.4.[ADDRESS_35135] 
undergoes treatment of the underlying tumor ( ie, radiation therapy or excision) at any 
point during the study, KRN23 treatment should be interrupted. If the investigator 
determines , based on seru m phosphorus levels below the lower level of normal in the 
subject, that KRN23 treatment should be resumed, the dose should be restarted at 
0.3 mg/kg Q4W and titrated to a new maintenance dose based on peak and trough serum 
phosphorus levels, up to a maximum dose of 2.0 mg/kg.  
Rationale : Radiation therapy  or tumor excision has the potential to reduce tumor activity 
or tumor ability to produce FGF23, thereby [CONTACT_35663]23 levels. T herefore, 
resuming KRN23 treatment at a low dose and re- titrating to a new maintenance dose is 
being implemented as a safety measure.  
8. Prohibited Medications:  In Section [IP_ADDRESS], an exception has been added to allow use of 
oral phosphate and/or pharmacologic vitamin D metabolites in the case of a subject who 
needs to discontinue treatment with KRN23 for more than 4 weeks to undergo treatment of the underlying tumor. 
Rationale : This change has been add ed in conjunction with the requirement that a subject 
discontinues KRN23 treatment if they will undergo treatment for the underlying tumor 
(see Summary of Changes #7) as management of hypophosphatemia may still be needed in this circumstance .  
9. Anti-KRN23 Antibodies: In Section  [IP_ADDRESS], the term HAHA (human anti-human 
antibody) in reference to anti -KRN23 antibody testing has been replaced  with the term 
ADA (anti -drug antibody). The assay methodology has also been updated . 
Rationale : This change is a clarification. The immunogenicity of KRN23 is evaluated by 
[CONTACT_35664], independent of isotype, in human serum. While the study protocol previously used the term “HAHA” for this assessment, it has been replaced with the more correct and specific term, ADA.  The updated assay methodology language 
reflects the current assay.

10. Contraception Methods: In Section [IP_ADDRESS], the list of examples of highly effective 
contraception methods was updated. In addition, Section 7.3.3 was updated to indicate 
that subjects who become pregnant will be discontinued from study. 
Rationale: Th ese change was made to align the acceptable methods of contraception in 
compliance with the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guideline, 
“Recommendations related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” and 
to be consistent with clinical trials in adults with XLH.  
11. Data Quality Assurance and Record Retention:  Sections 8.4.[ADDRESS_35136] 25 years after the end 
of the trial or in accordance with national law  and the right of regulatory authorities, the 
IRB, and/or Ultragenyx or its designees to access these records will also be retained for at 
least 25 years or in accordance with national law . 
Rationale: This administrative change has been made to reflect regulations by [CONTACT_19397].  
12. Safety Assessments: In the Synopsis, electrocardiogram  (ECG) is now listed as a general 
safety assessment. Previously it was listed  within the safety assessments for ectopic 
mineralization.  
Rationale: ECG is performed to evaluate for changes associated with left ventricular 
hypertrophy. Ectopic mineralization is not expected to affect ECG parameters and ECG was inadvertently listed in  that section in the original protocol.  Ectopic mineralization in 
the heart will be assessed by [CONTACT_35665].  
13. Reporting and Follow- up of Adverse Events . Section 8.[ADDRESS_35137] information 
for the medical monitor.  
Rationale : These updates to AE reporting and follow up were made to align with current 
guidelines and clarify current practices. The update to the medical monitor contact 
[CONTACT_35666] n was an administrative change.

CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL AMENDMENT  
SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023T-CL201 Amendment 5 
27 April 2018 
Protocol UX023T-CL201 Amendment 4 (dated 10 November 2017) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] 5 to extend the study duration until December 2019, to clarify procedures for 
dose optimization in later stages of the study, to allow Q2W dosing in certain cases , to add 
and clarify study procedures , and to note US and EU approval of KRN23 for the treatment of 
X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH), a separate indication. Minor edits and typographical 
corrections have also been made. Important protocol changes are summarized below: 
1. Study Duration: Section  7.[ADDRESS_35138] been updated to extend the 
treatment duration from up to 216 weeks  or June 30, 2019 to up to 244 weeks or until 
December 31, 2019, plus an additional safety follow-up period. T hese additional study 
visits are reflected in  the Schedule of Events  Table 2.5. 
Rationale : The study is being extended until the approximate expected date of 
commercial drug availability to allow continuation of treatment in these subjects.  
2. Selection and Timing of Doses : Dose adjustment beyond the 16- week titration period is 
permitted during the study. Section  7.4.[ADDRESS_35139] been updated to 
clarify the procedures related to  these later  dose adjustments . Specifically, if fasting 
serum phosphorus levels at trough (i.e., 4 weeks after a dose and before the subsequent 
dose) remain below the lower limit of normal (< 2.5 mg/dL), the dose may be increased  
in 0.5 mg/kg increments up to a dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q4W. In addition, if trough levels of 
serum phosphorus remain  < 2.5 mg/ dL after the dose is increased to 2.0 mg/kg Q4W, the 
dose frequency may be increased to every 2 weeks (Q2W). In these subjects, Q2W 
dosing will be initiated at 60% of the Q4W total dose . Serum phosphorus levels  will be 
measured  every 4 weeks (prior to subsequent doses ) for 12 weeks and if levels remain 
< 2.5 mg/ dL, the dose may be increased to 2.0 mg/kg Q2W, the maximum dose. 
Rationale : Clarifying the procedures for dose adjustment later in the study will provide 
additional guidance for investigators to manage dosing in subjects. Allowing an increased dose frequency to Q2W in subjects who do not maintain a trough serum phosphorus within the normal range at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q4W will allow evaluation of whether 
more frequent dosing can maintain serum phosphorus levels within the normal range.  
3. Study Assessments:  (a) A supplemental Schedule of Events has been added ( Table 2.6) 
to identify additional assessments to be performed for subjects who have a dose optimization at or after Week 96. (b) The Sit to Stand (STS) test has been added to 
Table 2.[ADDRESS_35140] a dose optimization at or after 
Week 96. (c) H ome health visits at Weeks 166, 190, and [ADDRESS_35141] been changed to site 
visits to allow assessment of PROs and the STS. (d) Assessment of serum concentrations of KRN23  in stable samples  has been added at Weeks 8, 32, 36, and 40 in Table 2.2. 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment 5 
27 April 2018  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
(e) Section  [IP_ADDRESS] has been clarified to indicate that in subjects for whom a tumor was 
not identified at baseline but who have the tumor located by 68Ga- DOTATATE PET/CT 
imaging or another method while on study, MRI or CT should be performed within 
21 (±7 days) days  of tumor identification  to assess tumor size. Thereafter, tumor imaging 
should be performed using the same method (MRI or CT) according to the Schedules of 
Events. If the MRI/CT imaging following tumor identification has occurred within 
3 months of the next scheduled MRI/CT assessment, that assessment will be skipped and the Schedules of Events will be followed thereafter. (f) A radiographic skeletal survey has been added to the Schedule of Events at Week 144 in  Table 2.4. (g) Genetic testing to 
evaluate for mutations in PHEX , the gene responsible for XLH , in subjects with TIO 
symptoms  from childhood and for whom the tumor has not been identified has been 
added to the Schedule of Events in Table 2.3.  
Rationale : (a), (b), and (c) The additional assessments at the start of and following dose 
optimization include serum phosphorus measurements, PRO assessments (Brief Pain 
Inventory, Brief Fatigue Inventory , and SF-36), and functional assessments ( STS test). 
These assessments will allow evaluation of the new dose on how the subject feels and functions both at the mid -point (with Q4W dosing) and at the end of the dose cycle. 
(d) The assessment of serum KRN23 concentrations at Weeks 8, 32, 36, and 40 were 
included in a previous version of the protocol and removed in Amendment 3. The assessments are being reinstated  to enable retrospective evaluation of stable stored study 
samples collected at these time points  to allow a more complete assessment of the 
relationship between serum phosphorus, KRN23 dose, and KRN23 concentration. 
(e) This is a clarification that the MRI or CT to assess tumor size should be performed 
within 21 (±7) days of identification by 
68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging and then 
according to the Schedule of Events. Previously it stated imaging should be performed according to the Schedule of Events. 
(f) Addition of the skeletal survey at Week 144 will enable a full evaluation of fractures and pseudofractures at a time point when bone scans are also performed. This may allow a better assessment of the effects of KRN23 on fracture burden in these subjects with TIO or ENS.  
(g) Mutational analysis of the PHEX gene has been added to rule out a possible XLH diagnosis due to the similar clinical features of the diseases in specific subjects who have 
had clinical symptoms and hypophosphatemia since childhood and in whom the tumor has not been identified.  
4. Contraception Requirement : In Section 7.3.1, language regarding contraception in 
Inclusion C riteria #8 and #9 has been updated for consistency with changes made 
previously to other parts of the protocol.  
Rationale:  The definition of women not of childbearing potential was updated to align 
with the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guideline. The change to a single 
highly effective form of contraception had previously been made to Section [IP_ADDRESS] (Pregnancy Testing and Contraception)  but not to the Inclusion criteria because the study 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment 5 
27 April 2018  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 
was fully enrolled. The current update was made for the purpose of consistency 
throughout the protocol.  
5. Coordinating Investigator : [INVESTIGATOR_35624] 8.2,  language has been added to detail selection 
and roles of a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_25810]. [CONTACT_35722] has been named as the Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_35625]. 
Rationale:  This change was made to indicate that a Coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_35626]. 
6. Timing of Safety Foll ow-up Telephone Calls: In Section 7.[ADDRESS_35142] dose of study drug; previously it 
had been based on the timing of the EOS/ET visit. The Safety Follow -up Telephone Calls 
will now be performed at 6 weeks (+5 days) and 12 weeks (+ 5 days) after the subject’s 
last dose of study drug. In addition, the first safety follow up call will now be performed 
for all subjects , not only in those not continuing KRN23 treatment through commercial 
use or another mechanism upon completion of study.  
Rationale:  Changing the timing of the Safety Follow -up Telephone Calls to be based on 
the last dose of study drug was done to allow consistency of timing from last dose, given 
that some subjects may be receiving Q2W dosing. All subjects will be called as a conservative approach to ensure no safety data are missed.  
7. Regulatory Approvals of KRN23 (burosumab) for XLH:  In Section 5.1,  the FDA 
approval of burosumab for the treatment of XLH in adults and pediatric patients [ADDRESS_35143] been noted. 
Rationale : This change was made to update the Background section with the most current 
regulatory status of KRN23.

SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND RATIONALE  
UX023T- CL201 Amendment 6 
26 September 2019 
Protocol UX023T-CL201 Amendment 5 (dated 27  April 2018) has been modified by 
[CONTACT_11827] [ADDRESS_35144] also been made as needed .  
1. Study duration:  Section 7.1 and related sections were updated to extend the total 
treatment duration from up to 244 weeks or 31 December 2019, to up to 300 weeks or 
31 January 2021, or until commercial availability of KRN23 as prescribed by [CONTACT_1766]’ 
treating physician , whichever is sooner . Accordingly, the End of Study ( EOS) 
assessments were removed from Week  244, and the additional study visits along with the 
revised EOS assessments are now shown in the Schedule of Events Table  2.6.  
Rationale: The study is being extended to allow continuation of treatment in subjects 
until availability of another mechanism of KRN23 treatment, such as commercially available treatment . 
2. Timing of Safety Follow- up Telephone Call: The Schedule of Events  Table 2.6, 
Section 7.1, and related sections were updated to indicate that the Safety Follow-up 
Telephone Call (TC) will occur approximately 6 weeks (+ 5 days) after a subject’s last 
dose of study drug to collect information on any ongoing or new adverse events ( AEs), 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant medications. An additional Safety 
Follow-up TC will occur approximately 12 weeks (+ 5 da ys) after the sub ject’s last dose 
of study drug. If subjects have started receiving KRN23 (burosumab) via an alternative mechanism (eg, commercial treatment) by [CONTACT_35667] 6 -week Safety Follow- up TC, 
the 12-week Safety Follow -up TC may not be necessary.  
Rationale : To clarify  the timing of Safety Follow-up TC s with respect to subjects’ last 
dose of study drug. 
3. Supplemental Schedule of Events table: The supplemental S chedule of Events table 
that outlined the assessments to be performed following a dose optimization at or after 
Week 96, including serum KRN23, brief pain inventory  (BPI), brief fatigue inventory  
(BFI), 36-item short form health survey ( SF-36), and s it-to-stand (STS), was removed 
from the Schedule of Events and related sections throughout protocol.  
Rationale : To simplify the study assessments and minimize unnecessary repetition of 
assessments.  
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment 6 
26 September 2019   
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 3 
4. Schedule of Events Tables 2.4 and 2.5:  Visits at Weeks 142, 166, 192, and 214 were 
removed from the Treatment Extension Period.  
Rationale: These visits were i ncluded in the protocol when dosing every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
was added to the study. However, the previous version of the protocol did not indicate 
that these additional visits are only for subjects who are undergoing Q2W dosing. This change is a clar ification to avoid unnecessary site visits by [CONTACT_35668].  
5. Sit-to-stand assessments during the Treatment Extension Period:  STS assessments 
were removed from the Treatment Extension Period (Schedule of Events  Table 2.4 and 
Table 2.5) for subjects who have an upward dose or frequency adjustment at or after 
Week 96. 
Rationale: To simplify the study assessments in subjects undergoing dose optimization at 
or after Week 96 .  
6. Radiograph ic assessments:  Section [IP_ADDRESS], the Schedule of Events, and related sections 
were updated to clarify that targeted radiographs will be completed at the anatomical 
location where a fracture or pseudofracture was id entified at or after Screening  every 
24 weeks starting at Week 72, until resolution , or up to Week 240.  
Rationale : To clarify the timing of follow-up of fracture s or pseudofracture s identified at  
or after Screening . Previously, radiographic assessments were not included after 
Week 144. 
7. Tumor imaging and tumor identification : Section [IP_ADDRESS] and the related assessments 
in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.6
) were modified to clarify that f or subjects with 
tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), if the tumor is visible and localized at Screening, it 
will be imaged at Screening and every 24 weeks through Week 144, and then every 
48 weeks (or at next scheduled visit) for the remainder of the study . For subjects with 
TIO whose tumor was not identifiable at Screening, evaluations every 48 weeks (or in 
alignment with regularly scheduled clinic visits) will be performed beginning at Week 120 in an attempt to locate the tumor. The preferred imaging technique is 
68Ga-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). 
Imaging to locate the tumor may also be performed at unscheduled visits if there is 
clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_35627]. If the tumor is located and determined to be unresectable, magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) or CT imaging (at the discretion of 
the Investigator) should occur within 21 (± 7) days of identification to assess tumor size, 
at an unscheduled visit if necessary, and thereafter according to the Schedule of Eve nts.
 
Rationale : To clarify tumor imaging and tumor identification assessments throughout the 
remainder of the study. 
8. Definition of maintenance dose:  In Section  7.4.5 and related sections, a definition of 
maintenance dose was added (defined as a dose at which 2  consecutive trough serum 
phosphorous levels are within the normal range [2.5 – 4.0 mg/dL]). 
Rationale: To provide clarity on the criterion for a maintenance dose of KRN23 .  
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment 6 
26 September 2019   
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 
9. KRN23 dose titration schemes:   
 (a) Table [IP_ADDRESS] was revised to include only the initial KRN23 dose titration scheme; 
dosing procedures for  subjects undergoing treatment of an underlying t umor were 
removed and placed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Table  [IP_ADDRESS].  
 (b) Table [IP_ADDRESS] and related text were updated to clarify the criteria and dose titration 
scheme for dose adjustments and increases in dose frequency at or after Week 96. 
Criteria for dose adjustments based on trough serum phosphorous levels were added. For subjects increasing to a KRN23 dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q2W based on the criteria in Table [IP_ADDRESS], additional predose serum phosphorus measurements were added every 
4 weeks (Q4W)  for 12 weeks to ensure that subjects do not experience dose-limiting 
toxicity (DLT ) (Section [IP_ADDRESS]).   
 (c) Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Table  [IP_ADDRESS] were created to clarify dosing procedures and the 
dose titration scheme for subjects w ho undergo treatment of an underlying tumor. 
Language was added to clarify that serum phosphorus levels should be monitored every 4 weeks for 24 weeks following the resumption of KRN23 treatment through unscheduled blood draws at peak time points. The KRN23 dose will be titrated based on 
peak serum phosphorous levels as indicated in Table  [IP_ADDRESS]. Thereafter, dosing decisions 
will be made based on trough serum phosphorus levels as indicated in  Table [IP_ADDRESS], and 
serum phosphorus measurements will proceed according to the Schedule of Events. 
Rationale : (a, b, c) To clarify the study dosing procedures, dose titration schemes, and 
related assessments.  
10. Introduction:  Previous and Ongoing Clinical Studies (Section 5.3.3) , and Summary of 
Overall Risks and Potential Benefits (Section  5.4) were updated to reflect the current 
information from clinical studies of KRN23 . 
Rationale : To update the protocol with the most current clinical data for KRN23.  
11. Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]: Minor updates were made to the Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869] (Section [IP_ADDRESS]) to 
clarify the criteria  under which study treatment will be stopped, and/or the subject will be 
discontinued from the study. Rationale : To more clearly define the Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35628].  
12. Medical Monitor:  In Section  [IP_ADDRESS], the study Medical Monitor was changed to Mary 
Scott Roberts, MD. Rationale : This was a minor administrative change to update the safety contact 
[CONTACT_35669].  
13. Study safety review team:  References to the study safety review team in Section  7.1, 
Section [IP_ADDRESS], and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  were changed  to clarify that the Sponsor will 
perform these safety monitoring ac tivities. Key safety data will be reviewed by [CONTACT_35670].  
Rationale : To clarify the language regarding the safety monitoring activities performed 
by [CONTACT_1034].

TITLE OF STUDY:  
A Phase 2 open- label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of KRN23, an antibody to 
FGF23, in subjects with tumor-induced osteomalacia ( TIO) or epi[INVESTIGATOR_35623] 
(ENS)-associated osteomalacia

PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  
Phase 2 
RATIONALE FOR THIS STUDY:  
KRN23 is a fully human immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody ( mAb) that 
binds to and inhibits the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23), leading to an 
increase in serum phosphorus levels . There are multiple disorders (each with a unique 
underlying cause) that result in unusually high circulating levels of FGF23, which in turn 
result in renal phosphate wasting and reduced (or aberrantly normal in relationship to 
elevated FGF23) levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25[OH] 2D). Across these disorders 
the clinical symptoms are similar and often include osteomalacia (and, in children, rickets), muscle weakness, fatigue, bone pain, and fractures. KRN23 has been studied in 1 of these disorders, X-linked hypophospha temia (XLH). Positive results were observed in a 
nonclinical pharmacology model  of XLH. I n single- and repeat -dose clinical studies in 
subjects with XLH , subcutaneous ( SC) administration of KRN23 consistently increased 
and sustained serum phosphorus levels and tubular reabsorption of phosphate ( TRP) 
without a major impact on urine calcium levels or vitamin  D metabolism . KRN23 
(burosumab) was  approved by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA) on 17 April 2018 
for the treatment of XLH in adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older, and a 
positive European Commission conditional marketing authorization was received on 23 February 2018 for the treatment of XLH with radiographic evidence of bone disease in 
children 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons.

Proprietary and Confidential Page 6 
Similar to XLH, tumor -induced osteomalacia (TIO) , also known as oncogenic 
osteomalacia,  is an acquired condition in which tumors, whose pathology is usually 
phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMT) , cause excessive ectopic production of FGF23 
that leads to renal phosphate wasting and impaired vitamin D synthesis. The high levels of 
FGF23 result in a similar biochemical profile to XLH that includes low serum pho sphorus, 
phosphaturia, an abnormally low ratio of renal tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption rate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR), elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), normal

2D. In TIO, tumors that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_35629]23, and if the causal tumor can be completely 
removed, the syndrome remits. However, some tumors are considered inoperable because of the location of the tumor or extent of disease or an inability to localize the tumor.  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_35623] (ENS) are rare congenital syndromes characterized by [CONTACT_35671][INVESTIGATOR_35630] 1 or more other developmental abnormalities of other organ systems including the nervous, skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems. Hypophosphatemia may rarely be 1 of the skeletal manifestations of ENS presenting in children primarily as rickets and in adults as osteomalacia. In all ENS-associated osteomalacia (also known as cutaneous skeletal hypophosphatemia 
syndrome) cases in which serum FGF23 levels were assessed, they were found to be elevated. The source of the excess FGF23 in ENS -associated osteomalacia is unclear. 
While early studies suggested it may be from the skin lesions themselves, more recent studies suggest it may be skeletally derived.  Compared with TIO, complete resection and 
surgical cure leading to removal of the sourc e of excess FGF23 is less likely. Nonetheless, 
published case reports of ENS -associated osteomalacia indicate improvement with skin 
debridement surgery in some cases. In many cases, improvement, if any, is modest and 
transient.  
In both TIO and ENS -associated osteomalacia, when surgery is not curative or feasible,  
medical treatment compris es oral phosphate and/or active vitamin D replacement. Efficacy 
of these treatment s is often limited; it does not treat the underlying disease; and its benefits 
must be balanced with monitoring for potential risks such as nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria , and hyperparathyroidism. 
This is a Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) , and 
pharmacodynamics ( PD) of KRN23 in subjects with TIO whose tumor is inoperable 
(defined as ‘the inability to localize the tumor or the impractical nature of surgery due to the extent of disease or the location of the tumor’) or ENS -associated osteomalacia, where 
skin lesion removal therapy is not considered a valid treatment option . It is hypothesiz ed 
that KRN23 may provide clinical benefit in this patient population because of the common 
underlying feature in patients with TIO or ENS- associated osteomalacia and in patients 
with XLH: abnormally elevated FGF23 levels.

The safety objective of the study is to: 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment 6 
26 September 2019   
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 8 
• Assess the safety of KRN23 administration in subjects with TIO or ENS-associated 
osteomalacia, based on adverse events (AEs), laboratory assessments, cardiac 
imaging, renal ultrasound, and immunogenic response  
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY :  
UX023T-CL201 is a Phase [ADDRESS_35145] inoperable disease 
(defined by [CONTACT_35675]) or if they have ENS- associated osteomalacia 
and are not being considered for skin lesion removal treatment . Subjects who are eligible 
for Screening will discontinue oral phosp hate and vitamin  D metabolite therapy at least 
2 weeks prior to Screening and may not resume supplementation for the duration of the study. Subjects who are eligible for study entry will receive tetracycline  (eg, tetracycline 
hydrochloride [ HCl] and demecl ocycline) prior to the Baseline Visit to facilitate 
histomorphometric analysis of the Baseline trans-iliac crest bone biopsy  (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  
The Baseline Visit will be conducted over approximately 4 days, including overnight stay 
if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_737].  Baseline safety and efficacy assessments 
(excluding bone biopsy ) will occur on the first 1  to 2 days (Days −3 and −2). On the 
following day (Day −1), a trans-iliac crest bone biopsy will be pe rformed (refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]). On the next day (Day 0, Week 0), subjects will receive their first SC 
injection(s) of KRN23.   
All enrolled subjects will begin treatment with KRN23 every 4 weeks ( Q4W) at a starting 
dose of 0.3 mg/kg (Week 0). Doses of KRN23 will then be titrated in an effort to achieve a target fasting serum phosphorus range of 2.5 to 4.0 mg/dL ( Table [IP_ADDRESS]). All serum 
phosphorus asse ssments will be taken with subjects in the fasting state. If the subject’s 
peak serum phosphorus level at Week [ADDRESS_35146]’s dose may be increased at Week 4 to 0.6 mg/kg, at the discretion of the I nvestigator. Doses will 
then continue to be titrated in increments of 0.2 mg/kg at Weeks 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_35147] has not yet achieved the target range of serum phosphorus. 
The maximum dose allowed in this protocol is 2.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W). If needed, 
the final dose adjustment increment may be less than the specified increment to reach the 
2.0 mg/kg dose. If a subject undergoes treatment  of the underlying tumor ( ie, radiation 
therapy or excision) at any point during the study, KRN23 treatment should be interrupted 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS]
). If the Investigator with the study Medical Monitor determines, based on 
serum phosphorus below the lower limit of normal, that the subject  should resume KRN23 
treatment, the dose should be restarted at 0.3 mg/kg Q4W. Serum phosphorus levels 
should be subsequently monitored every 4 weeks for 24 weeks following the resumption of 
KRN23 treatment through unscheduled blood draws at peak (2  weeks postdose) time

points. The KRN23 dos e will be titrated based on peak serum phosphorous levels as 
indicated in  Table [IP_ADDRESS]. Thereafter, dosing decisions will be made based on trough 
serum phosphorus leve ls (4 weeks ± 3 days postdose and prior to the subsequent dose) 
obtained at the previous study visit as indicated in Table  [IP_ADDRESS], and serum phosphorus 
assessments will proceed according to the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, Table 2.2, 
Table 2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, and Table 2.6).  
Subjects will be enrolled consecutively. Key safety data will be reviewed periodically on 
an ongoing basis coincident with formal data snap shots. If a dose- limiting toxicity (DLT; 
a Grade ≥ 3 toxicity that is probably or possibly treatment related or a confirmed serum 
phosphorus level ≥ 6.5 mg/dL) is identified at any point, the study will be paused until all of the efficacy and safety data collected to date are reviewed to evaluate the ove rall 
risks/benefits of the study and to make a determination about whether it will continue. 
Screening, Baseline, and post -treatment PK, PD, efficacy, and safety assessments are 
shown by [CONTACT_35676] 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, and 
Table 2.6. 
Upon regulatory approval and commercial availability  of KRN23  for the treatment of TIO , 
subjects will  have their End of Study (EOS) Visit, and transition to prescription drug, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_24018]. Until commercial availability, subjects may 
continue treatment with KRN23  for up to 252 weeks in the Treatment Extension Period, or 
until 31 January 2021, whichever is sooner, and then undergo their EOS V isit. Therefore, 
the duration of the T reatment Extension P eriod will vary for individual subjects , and will 
be determined by [CONTACT_35677] 49 through their EOS V isit. Upon 
completion of study drug treatment (ie, EOS Visit) or early withdrawal from this study  (ie, 
Early Termination [ET] Visit), a  Safety Follow-up Telephone C all (TC) will occur 
approximately 6 weeks (+ 5 days) after a subject’s last  dose of study drug to collect 
information on any ongoing or new AEs, serious adverse events (SAEs), and concomitant 
medications.  An additional Safety Follow-up TC will occur approximately 12 weeks 
(+ 5 days) after the subject’s last dose of study drug. If subjects have started receiving 
KRN23 (burosumab) via an alternative mechanism (eg, commercial treatment) by [CONTACT_35667] 6-week Safety Follow-up TC, the 12- week Safety Follow -up TC may not be 
necessary.  The end of this study is defined as the last day protocol- specified assessments 
(including telephone contact) are conducted for the last subject.  
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS PLANNED :  
Approximately 15 adult subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects who withdraw or are removed from the study may be replaced on a case-by- case basis, at the discretion of 
Ultragenyx and the Investigator.

Proprietary and Confidential Page 12 
KRN23 will initially be administered Q4W. Doses will be titrated at Weeks  4, 8, 12, and 
16 in individual subjects to achieve a target peak serum phosphorus range of 2.5 to  
4.0 mg/dL. Doses may be titrated at later visits, at the discretion of the Investigator, if 
there are concerns about safety or suboptimal efficacy  or if a subject has not yet achieved 
the target range  of serum phosphorus. Dose frequency may be increased to Q2W if trough 
serum phosphorus levels remain < 2.5 mg/dL at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q4W. Doses should 
be interrupted and may be retitrated  if a subject undergoes treatment of the underlying 
tumor (ie, radiation therapy or excision) at any point during the study. The  maximum dose 
allowed in this protocol is 2.0 mg/kg Q2W . If needed, the final dose adjustment increment 
may be less than the spe cified increment to  reach a 2.0 mg/kg dose. Following a downward 
dose adjustment, the I nvestigator together with the Medical Monitor will determine how 
and when to dose titrate up. 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE  AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION :  
This is an open-label study in which all subjects will re ceive investigational product. 
No placebo or reference therapy will be administered.  
DURATION OF TREATMENT :  
The total KRN23 treatment duration on study will be up to [ADDRESS_35154] their EOS Visit, and transition to prescription drug, as recommended by 
[CONTACT_24018]. Subjects will undergo an ET V isit if 1 of the following occurs: the 
subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study  at the discretion of the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is 
terminated.

Table [IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_35164], additional samples ma y be obtained to perform further testing.  
17 24-hour urine collections for urinary phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and eGFR; fasting 2-hour urine collections for Tm P/GFR, TRP, and urinary 
calcium/creatinine ratio . 
18 Screening results will be treated as Baseline data.  
19 Ambulatory status at Baseline will be collected retrospectively  
20 Subjects with a TIO diagnosis only. If visible, the tumor will be imaged at Screening using the same radiologic imaging technique (eg, computed tomography  
[CT] or magnetic resonance imaging  [MRI]) used to identify the tumor. In cases where the tumor was initially identified using another imaging technology, a 
baseline CT scan or MRI (whichever is more clinically appropriate) will be performed. During follow up, the same imaging technique ( CT scan or MRI ) that 
was used at Baseline will be utilized  to assess the size of the tumor .  
[ADDRESS_35165] . 
22 All enrolled subjects will begin treatment with KRN23 at a starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg (Week 0 , Day 0, and no sooner than the day after the bone biopsy is 
performed).

1 During the Treatment Extension Period (Weeks 49 – 300), clinic visits will occur at approximately 24 -week intervals.  
2 Home health (HH) visits may also be conducted at the clinic depending on proximity of the subject to the investigational site  and local availability of home 
health care services. The visit window is ± [ADDRESS_35181] their End of Study (EOS) Visit, and transition 
to prescription drug, as recommended by [CONTACT_24018]. Until commercial availability, subjects may continue treatment with KRN23 for up to  
252 weeks in the Treatment Extension Period, or until 31 January 2021, whichever is sooner , and then undergo their EOS Visit. Subjects will undergo an

Early Termination ( ET) Visit if the subject withdraws consent and discontinues from the study, the subject is discontinued from the study at the discretion of 
the Investigator or Ultragenyx, or the study is terminated.  The EOS Visit or ET Visit may be up to 2 days in duration due to the  volume of testing; required 
blood draws may be split across 2 days . ECHO will not be performed at the EOS or ET Visit if the assessment was conducted within 3 months of 
termination . 99mTC bone scan  will not be performed at the EOS or ET visit if the asses sment was performed within 12 months of termination.  BPI, BFI, 
SF-36, anti-KRN23 antibody assessment, and serum iPTH will not be performed at the EOS or ET Visit if they were conducted within 4 weeks of 
termination.  
4 Blood and urine to be collected after a minimum overnight fasting time of 8 hours and prior to drug administration.   
5 Fasting 2-hour urine collections for TmP/GFR, TRP, and urinary calcium. Blood draw for serum creatinine should occur at 1 hour into the urine collection.  
6 Bone biomarkers will include serum measures of CTx, P1NP, BALP, and osteocalcin.

15 24-hour urine collections for urinary phosphorus, calcium, creatinine, and eGFR; fasting 2 -hour urine collections for TmP/GFR, TRP, and urinary 
calcium/creatinine ratio .  
16 Screening results will be treated as Baseline data.   
17 Subjects with a TIO diagnosis only. If visible at Screening , the tumor will be imaged every 24 weeks through Week 144  and then every 48 weeks for the 
remainder of the study  using the same radiologic imaging technique ( eg, CT scan or MRI) used to identify the tumor  in order to ass ess the size of the tumor . 
For subjects in whom the tumor is identified during the study by 68Ga-DOTATATE positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) or 
another method, tumor imaging (CT or MRI, at the discretion of the Investigator) should be performed within 21 (± 7) days of identification to assess tumor 
size, at an unscheduled visit if necessary, and thereafter every 48 weeks  per the Schedule of Events. If the MRI/CT imaging following tumor identification

has occurred within 3 months of the ne xt scheduled MRI/CT assessment, the scheduled assessment will be skipped . Tumor imaging will not be performed at 
the EOS/ET Visit if it has been performed within the past [ADDRESS_35185] a clinical indication of a possible new 
tumor every 48 weeks (or in alignment with regularly scheduled clinic visits) after Week 120. The preferred imaging technique is 68Ga-DOTATATE 
PET/CT. Octreotide -SPECT (SPECT/CT)  or FDG-PT/CT may be used if 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT is not available. (If none of these methods are 
available, another imaging technique may be used at Investigator discretion.) Tumor identification  will not be performed at the EOS  or ET visit if it has been  
performed within the past [ADDRESS_35186].  
21 After the starting dose, doses of KRN23 will be titrated in an effort to achieve a target fasting serum phosphorus range of 2.5 to 4.0 mg/dL  (see 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]). If the subject’s peak serum phosphorus level at Week [ADDRESS_35187]’s dose may be increased at Week 4 to 
0.6 mg/kg, at the discretion of the Investigator . Doses will then be titrated in increments of 0.2 mg/kg at Weeks 8, 12, and 16 in individual subjects to 
achieve a target peak serum phosphorus range. If needed, the final dose adjustment increment may be less than the specified increme nt to reach the 
2.0 mg/kg dose. Doses may be titrated at later visits, at the discretion of the  Investigator , if there are concerns about safety or suboptimal efficacy , or if a 
subject undergoes treatment of the underlying tumor (see Table [IP_ADDRESS] and Table [IP_ADDRESS]).  
[ADDRESS_35188] reaches a dose of 2. 0 mg/kg Q4W and serum phosphorus levels remain below the lower 
limit of normal on 2 consecutive trough measurements  (see Table [IP_ADDRESS]). Additional HH visits will be scheduled for Q2W dose administration if necessary.  
Vital signs, adverse events, and concomitant medications will also be collected at these additional HH visits.  
23 The site personnel will initiate a Safety Follow -up telephone call (TC) approximately 6  weeks (+ 5 days) after the last dose of study drug  to collect 
information on any ongoing or new AEs, SAEs, or concomitant medications. An additional  Safety Follow -up TC will occur at 12 weeks (+ 5 days) after the 
last dose of study drug (see footnote 24) . If subjects have started receiving KRN23 (burosumab) via an alternative mechanism (eg, commercial treatment) by 
[CONTACT_35667] 6 -week Safety Follow -up TC, the 12 -week Safety Follow -up TC may not be necessary .

5 INTRODUCTION  
5.1 Study Rationale  
KRN23 is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 ( IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb)  that binds 
to and inhibits the activity of fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23), leading to an increase in 
serum phosphorus levels . There are multiple disorders (each with a unique underlying cause) 
that result in unusually high circulating levels of FGF23, which in turn results in renal 
phosphate wasting and reduced (or aberrantly  normal in relatio nship to the elevated FGF23 
levels) levels of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin  D (1,25[OH] 2D). Across these disorders the clinical 
symptoms are similar and often include osteomalacia (and, in children, rickets), muscle 
weakness, fatigue, bone pain, and fractures. KRN23 has been studied in 1 of these disorders, 
X-linked hypophospha temia (XLH),  in which a mutation in the Phosphate- regulating gene 
with Homology to Endopeptidases located on the X chromosome ( PHEX; 
a phosphate-regulating gene with highest expression in bone cells) leads to elevated levels of 
FGF23. In the Hyp mouse model, a relevant murine model of XLH, treatment with a mouse 
anti-FGF23 mAb normalized or ameliorated many of the characteristic abnormalities 
associated with XLH (Aono et al. 2009; Aono et al. 2011) . In single- and repeat -dose clinical 
studies in subjects with XLH , subcutaneous ( SC) administration of KRN23 consistently 
increased and sustained serum phosphorus levels and tubular re absorption of phosphate  
(TRP) without a major impact on urine calcium levels or vitamin  D metabolism.  
KRN23 (burosumab) was approved by [CONTACT_2165] ( FDA) on 
17 April 2018 for the treatment of XLH in adult and pediatric patients 1 year of age and older, and a positive European Commission conditional marketing authorization was received on 23 February 2018 for the treatment of XLH with radiographic evidence of bone disease in children 1 year of age and older and adolescents with growing skeletons. 
Similar to XLH, t umor-induced osteomalacia ( TIO), also known as oncogenic osteomalacia,  
is an acquired condition in which tumors, whose pathology is usually phosphaturic 
mesenchymal tumors (PMT),  cause excessive ectopic production of FGF23 that leads to 
renal phosphate wasting and impaired vitamin D synthesis. The high levels of FGF23 result in a similar biochemical profile to XLH that includes low serum phosphorus, phosphaturia, an abnormally low ratio of renal tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption rate to glomerular filtration rate (TmP/GFR), elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), normal calcium, and low to normal levels o f 1,25(OH)
2D. In TIO,  tumors that are typi[INVESTIGATOR_35634]23, and if  the causal tumor can be completely removed, the 
syndrome remits. In patients for whom the tumor is inoperable, the current standard of care consists of oral phosphate and/or vitamin D replacement. Efficacy of this treatment is often 
limited; it does not treat the underlying disease; and its benefits must be balanced with monitoring for potential risks such as nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_35623] (ENS) are rare congenital syndromes characterized by [CONTACT_35684][INVESTIGATOR_35630] 1 or more other 
developmental abnormalities of other organ systems including the nervous, skeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular systems. Hypophosphatemia may rarely be 1 of the skeletal manifestations of ENS presenting in children primarily as rickets and in adults as

osteomalacia. In all ENS -associated osteomalacia (also known as cutaneous skeletal 
hypophosphatemia syndrome) cases in which serum FGF23 levels were assessed, they were 
found to be elevated  (Lim et al. 2014) . The source of the excess FGF23 in ENS- associated 
osteomalacia is unclear.  Although some previous studies had suggested that the source of 
excess FGF23 was from skin lesions, more recent studi es have failed to detect FGF23 protein 
or FGF23 mRNA from samples of skin lesions. Thus, it is possible that an as-yet unknown substance produced from the skin may induce FGF23 excess or that FGF23 excess in this 
syndrome may be from dysplastic bone or other skeletal lesion s that are often part of the 
constellation of congenital malformations associated with the underlying somatic mosaic 
mutation that  forms the basis of ENS-associated osteomalacia. Compared with  TIO, 
complete resection and surgical cure leading to removal of the source of excess FGF23 is less likely.  
Treatment  with oral phosphate and calcitriol as well as excision of these skin lesions have 
produced mixed reports of efficacy ( Olivares et al. 1999) . In many cases, improvement, if 
any, is modest and transient. 
This is a Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) , and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of KRN23 in subjects with TIO whose tumor is  inoperable (defined 
by [CONTACT_35685]) or ENS -associated osteomalacia, where skin lesion 
removal therapy is not considered a valid treatment option. I t is hypothesized that KRN23 
may provide clinical benefit in this patient population because of the common underlying 
feature: abnormally elevated FGF23 levels. 
5.2 Overview of the Disease 
TIO, also known as oncogenic osteomalacia, is an acquired condition in which typi[INVESTIGATOR_35635]23 that leads to renal phosphate 
wasting an d impaired calcitriol synthesis . The high levels of FGF23 result in a similar 
biochemical profile to XLH that includes low serum phosphorus, phosphaturia, an abnormally TmP/GFR , elevated  ALP, normal calcium , and low to normal levels of 
1,25(OH)
2D (Drezner 1999) . However, because the FGF23 levels observed in TIO far exceed 
those seen in XLH, the clinical syndrome resulting from the renal phosphate wasting is often more severe and characterized by [CONTACT_35686], fractures , and muscle and bone 
pain. The tumors characteristic of TIO  are typi[INVESTIGATOR_35636], slow-growing masses  that may be 
located in various areas, including long bones, soft tissues,  nasal sinuses, and the groin. 
Most tumors are benign, phosphaturic mesenchymal connective tissue tumors,  also known as 
PMTs, although a few cases of malignant tumors have been reported  (Folpe et al. 2004; 
Weidner et al. 1987) . TIO-related tumors  can particularly difficult to find, even with the use 
of high-resolution imaging techniques ( Jan de Beur et al. 2002) . When the tumor can be 
identified  and surgically removed, FGF23 levels decline dramatically and the clinical 
syndrome remits within days to weeks. If the tumor cannot be located , or if the tumor resides 
in an area that pre cludes surgical excision because of the risk of damage to neighboring 
structures, conventional therapy is the same as with XLH, ie, phosphorus supplementation in

combination with calcitriol. In some cases, calcitriol alone is administered 
(Geller et al. 2007). The efficacy of this treatment is limited given the magnitude of the 
FGF23 levels and the severity of the resulting phosphate wasting. I ts benefits should be 
weighed against the need for frequent monitoring to mitigate the risks of nephrocalcinosis, 
hypercalciuria , and hyperparathyroidism. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_35637], characterized by [CONTACT_35684][INVESTIGATOR_35630] 1 or more other developmental abnormalities of other 
organ systems including the nervous, skeletal, cardiovascular, a nd ocular systems 
(Stavrianeas et al. 2004 ). The epi[INVESTIGATOR_35618]-neoplastic overgrowth of various 
components of skin cells (eg, s ebaceous cells- linear sebaceous nevus) that  are usually 
distributed linearly along the lines of Blaschko, corresponding to the movement of skin cells 
during embryogenesis. While these epi[INVESTIGATOR_35638], the additional systemic abnormalities almost exclusively occur in the setting of extensive skin surface area involvement (10 – 60% of the  body surface area) consistent with early embryonic somatic 
mutation in multipotent progenitor cells. Specific genetic defects and timing of mutation during fetal development influence the varied phenotypes of ENS ( Lim et al. 2014) . 
Hypophosphatemia may rarely be 1 of the skeletal manifestations of ENS presenting in children primarily as rickets an d in adults as osteomalacia. In all ENS -associated 
osteomalacia cases in which serum FGF23 levels were assessed, they were  found to be 
elevated (Lim et al. 2014) . Standard of care with oral phosphate and calcitriol as well as 
excision of these skin lesions have produced mixed reports of efficacy (Olivares et al. 1999) . 
In many cases, improvement, if any , is modest and transient.

5.3.[ADDRESS_35198] mechanisms of action (Fukumoto 2008; Razzaque et al. 2007; Yamazaki et al. 2008) . The primary mechanism is to 
inhibit phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney. The secondary mechanism is to decrease phosphate absorption by [CONTACT_35687] 1,25(OH)
2D production in the kidney.

KRN23 has the potential to block or reduce FGF23 action and improve phosphate 
metabolism in patients  with TIO or ENS-associated osteomalacia. KRN23 binds the 
amino-terminal domain of FGF23 that interacts with the FGFR1 -binding portion of the 
combination FGFR1/Klotho receptor, preventing FGF23 from binding and signaling its receptor. Both intact and fragmented FGF23 polypeptides are immunoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_35639]23 (Yamazaki et al. 2008 ). By [CONTACT_35688]23, KRN23 restores the ratio of the 
tubular maximum reabsorption rate of phosphate to glome rular filtration rate (TmP/GFR ) in 
the kidney and increases the production of 1,25(OH)
2D, which also enhances intestinal 
absorption of phosphate. The action on both kidney reabsorption and intestinal absorption, improves serum phosphorus levels, which is expected to improve bone mineralization and reduce the diverse bone and non-bone manifestations associated with hypophosphatemia in patients with TIO or ENS-associated osteomalacia. 
5.3.2 Nonclinical Studies  
The Sponsor’s development partner, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma, Inc. ( KHK), has 
conducted a series of nonclinical pharmacology, PK, and toxicology studies in rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys to support the use of KRN23 in clinical studies. Findings of potential clinical significance and relevance to this protocol are summarized below; additional 
information is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
• KRN23 binds to human, rabbit, and monkey FGF23 with comparable affinities. In a 
Good Laboratory Practice study, KRN23 cross- reactivity was evaluated against a full 
panel of human, rabbit (32 tissues), and cynomolgus monkey (33 tissues) tissues by 
[CONTACT_9064]. No specific KRN23 staining was observed , thus no untoward 
direct-effects of KRN23 are expected in any tissues of normal humans, rabbits, or 
cynomolgus monkeys 
• In a 40-week toxicity study in male and female adult cynomolgus monkeys, KRN23 was administered every 2 weeks at doses of 0 (control), 0.03, 0.3, 3, and 30 mg/kg 
intravenously ( IV) and 30 mg/kg SC. The main observed histopathological change was 
metastatic mineralization of various soft tissues, including the kidney, eyeball, lung, 
manus, skeletal muscle, and submandibular gland in the 3.0 mg/kg IV and 30 mg/kg SC and IV groups. Mineralization in the kidney and eyeball did not show obvious reversibility  after a 13-week recovery period. The no adverse effect level ( NOAEL) was 
0.03 mg/kg for males and 0.3 mg/kg (IV) for females  based on the histopathologic 
finding metastatic mineralization; in males mineralization and hyperstosis of cortical bone were more  severe in males than females. The NOAEL in a 40 -week toxicity study 
in juvenile cynomolgus monkeys and a single-dose study in rabbits was 0.3 mg/kg KRN23 IV 
• Prolonged and excessive elevation of serum phosphate beyond normal levels was associated with soft  tissue and organ mineralization including the kidney where 
nephrocalcinosis was observed at the highest doses tested  (IV and SC) ; reversibility of 
mineralization could not be established

• The most prominent pharmacologic actions of KRN23 were dose-dependent changes in 
serum inorganic phosphorus and 1,25(OH) 2D in rabbits and in juvenile, adult, and 
pregnant cynomolgus monkeys  
• No gross or histopathological abnormalities were observed at the IV infusion sites or SC injection sites in the 40 -week repeat dose toxicity studies in adult and juvenile 
cynomolgus monkeys  
• KRN23 demonstrated consistent and predictable PK behavior in both rabbits and 
cynomolgus monkeys based on the results of single- and repeat-dose studies where 
exposure was by [CONTACT_35689]  
• The NOAEL was the same in juvenile and adult monkeys, suggesting no difference in sensitivity to the adverse effects of KRN23. The results from single- and repeat -dose 
toxicology studies in rabbits and in juvenile, adult , and pregnant cynomolgus monkeys 
suggest that  the primary toxicological effects of KRN23 are associated with prolonged 
and excessive antagonism of the normal regulatory actions of FGF23 on renal TRP  and 
vitamin D metabolism

5.4 Summary of Overall Risks and Potential Benefits  
The efficacy and safety of KRN23 in XLH has been established in a total of 13 completed 
and ongoing clinical studies (Section  5.3.3), which include a broad patient population 
ranging from [ADDRESS_35201] received KRN23  at various doses (up to 2 mg/kg every 2 weeks) and for durations up to 
[ADDRESS_35202] demonstrated that KRN23 treatment blocks FGF23 and leads to a sustained increase in serum phosphorus levels and restoration of phosphate homeostasis, 
thereby [CONTACT_35691]. In children with XLH, 
KRN23 treatment substantially improved rickets, growth, physical function, and pain. 
In adults with XLH, KRN23  treatment improve d skeletal health, including osteomalacia; 
improved the healing of fractures and pseudofractures; improved physical function; and 
reduced subject -reported stiffness and pain.   
Across all studies in XLH , KRN23 was well tolerated and  demonstrated an acceptable safety 
profile with no significant safety concerns. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in 
severity and no KRN23 -related deaths have occurred.  In the adult placebo-controlled study in 
XLH, most frequent adverse events related to KRN23 were injection-site reactions in 
children and restless legs syndrome ( RLS) in adults. Injection -site reaction  events were mild 
in severity and readily managed. RLS events were generally mild to moderate in severity and often occurred in the setting of medical or family history of RLS. In adults, serum phosphorus levels above the normal range occurred in < 10% of subjects and were transient, mild, and reversible. No clinically meaningful changes related to potential ecto pic 
mineralization were observed. Although ectopic mineralization is a known risk related to XLH disease, and is exacerbated by [CONTACT_35692]/or 1,25(OH)
2D supplementation, KRN23 does not appear to be associated with 
progression of cardiac or renal ectopic mineralization beyond the natural course of pre-existing disease.  
In conclusion, KRN23 inhibits the effects of FGF23, restoring phosphate, vitamin D, and bone metabolism homeostasis. By [CONTACT_35693]23 and correcting hypophosphatemia , it is 
expected that the underlying osteomalacia will be treated  in subjects with TIO and 
ENS-associated osteomalacia, leading to improved clinical outcomes including a potential 
reduction in pain, fatigue, and fracture ri sk, as well as the impact of these factors on the 
health-related quality of life of adult patients with TIO. To date, KRN23 has a favorable 
safety profile without evidence of increased ectopic mineralization or other safety concerns associated with excess FGF23. Overall, based on the scientific rationale, unmet medical 
need, and results from nonclinical studies and clinical studies to date, investigation of KRN23 is warranted in patients with TIO/ENS -associated osteomalacia for whom complete 
surgical tumor/lesion resection is not a viable treatment option.

7 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
7.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
UX023T-CL201 is an open -label, Pha se 2 study of KRN23 in adult subjects  with TIO or 
ENS-associated osteomalacia. Approximately 15 subjects with TIO or ENS-associated 
osteomalacia with inoperable disease (defined as ‘the  inability to localize the tumor or the 
impractical nature of surgery d ue to the extent of disease or the location of the tumor’ ), will 
be enrolled. The study will include an initial [ADDRESS_35203] 2  weeks prior to the Screening Visit and may not resume 
supplementation for the duration of the study. After Screening biochemistry parameters confirm eligibility, subjects will be provided a tetracycline  (eg, tetracycline hydrochloride 
[HCl] and demeclocycline) to take prior to the Baseline Visit to facilitate histomorphometric 
analysis of the trans-iliac crest bone biopsy (refer to Section  [IP_ADDRESS]). Note that the bone 
biopsy is not required at the Baseline Visit if a previous bone biopsy performed within 
12 months of Screening confirmed the diagnosis of osteomalacia, the subjects’ clinical manifestations have not changed significantly since the time of the previous biopsy/diagnosis, and the tissue collected at that biopsy is made available for testing for this protocol.  
The Baseline Visit will be conducted over approximately 4 days, including overnight stay if deemed necessary by  [CONTACT_737]. Fasting blood samples and urine collections (of 2 - and 
24-hour durations), as well as predose Baseline safety and efficacy assessments ( excluding 
bone biopsy ) will occur on the first [ADDRESS_35204] bone biops y will be performed  (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]). 
No other assessments are to be performed or any study drug administered on that day. On the 
day following the biopsy (Day  0, Week 0), subject s will receive their first SC injection(s) of 
KRN23.  
All enrolled subjects will begin treatment with KRN23  every 4 weeks ( Q4W) at a starting 
dose of 0.3 mg/kg (Week 0). Doses of KRN23 will then be titrated in an effort to achieve a target fasting serum phosphorus range of 2.5 to 4.0 mg/dL (details are described in 
Section 7.4.5). If the subject’s peak serum phosphorus level at Week 2 remains below the 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment [ADDRESS_35205]’s dose may be increased at Week 4 to 0.6 mg/kg, at the discretion of 
the Investigator. Doses will then continue to be titrated in increments o f 0.2 mg/kg at 
Weeks 8, 12, and [ADDRESS_35206] has not yet achieved the target 
range of serum phosphorus (refer to Section  7.4.5). Doses of KRN23 will be adjusted 
downward if serum phosphorous levels range from 4.0 to 4.5 mg/dL . Doses of KRN23 will 
be skipped if serum phosphorous levels exceed 4. 5 mg/dL. Doses will be interrupted and may 
be retitrated if a subject undergoes treatment of the underlying tumor ( ie, radiation therapy or 
excision) at any point during the study  (refer to Section 7.4.5 ).  
Subjects will be enrolled consecutively. The incidence, frequency, and severity of AEs and serious AEs ( SAEs); AEs leading to discontinuation; deaths; clinically significant laboratory 
parameters (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis); as well as serum intact 
parathyroid hormone  (iPTH), phosphorus, 1,25(OH)
2D, creatinine, calcium:creatinine ratio, 
and serum and urinary calcium will be reviewed periodically on an ongoing basis coincident 
with formal data snap shots. If a dose- limiting toxicity (DLT; a Grade  ≥ 3 toxicity that is 
probably or possibly treatment related or a confirmed serum phosphorus level ≥ 6.5 mg/dL) is identified at any point, the study will be paused until all of the efficacy and safety  data 
collected to date are reviewed to evaluate the overall risks/benefits of the study and to make a 
determination about whether it will continue.  
Upon regulatory approval and commercial availability of KRN23 for the treatment of TIO, subjects will have their End of Study (EOS) Visit, and transition to prescription drug, as 
recommended by [CONTACT_24018]. Until commercial availability, subjects may continue treatment with KRN23 for up to 252 weeks in the Treatment Extension Period, or until 31 January 2021, whichever is sooner, and then undergo their EOS V isit. Therefore, the 
duration of the Treatment Extension Period will vary for individual subjects, and will be determined by [CONTACT_35677] 49 through their EOS Visit. Upon completion of study drug treatment (ie, EOS Visit) or early withdrawal from study (ie, Early Termination 
[ET] Visit), a Safety Follow- up telephone call (TC) will occur approximately 6 weeks 
(+ 5 days) after a subject’s last dose of study drug to collect information on any ongoing or 
new AEs, SAEs, and concomitant medications. An additional Safety Follow- up TC will 
occur approximately 12 weeks (+ 5 days) after the subject’s last dose of study drug. If subjects have started receiving KRN23 (burosumab) via an alternative mecha nism 
(eg, commercial treatment) by [CONTACT_35667] [ADDRESS_35207] day 
that protocol -specified assessments (including telephone contact) are cond ucted for the last

In a Phase 1/2 multiple -dose, dose- escalation study (KRN23- INT-001), KRN23 was well 
tolerated following SC administration of [ADDRESS_35226] escalating doses (0.05 mg/kg → 
0.1 mg/kg → 0.3 mg/kg →0.6 mg/kg) administered Q4W  in subjects with XLH. The 
proportion of KRN23-treated subjects with serum phosphorus levels in the target range 
(> 2.5 to ≤ 4.0  mg/dL) increased with KRN23 dose level but did not exceed the upper limit of 
normal (4.5 mg/dL) in any subject at any time point. A direct PK-PD relationship between 
serum KRN23 concentrations and serum phosphorus levels was noted in the study.  
In an associated  extension study (KRN- INT-002), doses were individually selected for each 
subject (up to 1.0 mg/kg every 4 weeks)  based on serum phosphorus response (target range 
> 2.5 to ≤ 4.0  mg/dL) and safety considerations. Doses were relatively stable in the extension 
study and were generally either 0.6 or 1.0 mg/kg. Doses up to 1.0 mg/kg a dministered 
every 4 weeks were well tolerated over a period of 48  weeks.  
In the ongoing pediatric study in patients with XLH, KRN23 doses up to 2.0 mg/kg 
administered Q2W or Q4W are permitted.  
Based on these initial results in subjects with XLH, a starti ng dose of 0.3 mg/kg, with 
additional KRN23 injections Q4W , was selected for this study. Although the maximum dose 
administered to date in adults with XLH is 1.0  mg/kg Q4W , the maximum dose in this study 
is 2.0 mg/kg Q2W . This dose was selected because it is anticipated that doses > 1.0 mg/kg 
may be needed to bring serum phosphorus levels up to the lower end of the normal range in subjects with TIO . Compared to subjects with XLH, FGF23 levels are much higher in 
subjects with TIO  and ENS -associated osteomalacia and the associated hypophosphatemia is 
more severe. It  is important to note that dose escalation will be limited based on individual 
subject serum phosphorus response (see Section  7.4.5), and no off- target effects have been 
observed to date in nonclinical or clinical studies . Specific safety monitoring procedures, 
based on the target effects of KRN23, have been selected to mitigate safety risk to  subjects 
(see Section 7.5.6). 
7.4.[ADDRESS_35227] 
KRN23 will initially be administered Q4W. All s ubjects will receive a KRN23 starting dose 
of 0.3 mg/kg (at Week  0). Doses of KRN23 will then be titrated in an effort to achieve a 
target fasting peak serum phosphorus range of 2.5 to  4.0 mg/dL based on peak serum 
phosphorus samples obtained 2 weeks after drug administration  (described in Table  [IP_ADDRESS]). 
If the subject’s peak serum phosphorus level at Week [ADDRESS_35228]’s dose may be increased at Week 4 to 0.6 mg/kg, at the dis cretion of the Investigator. 
Doses will then continue to be titrated in increments of 0.2 mg/kg at Weeks 8, 12, and 16 in individual subjects to achieve the target peak serum phosphorus range.

Doses may be titrated at later visits,  following the initial dose titration phase , at the discretion 
of the Investigator, if there are concerns about safety, suboptimal efficacy, or if a subject has 
not yet achieved the target range of serum phosphorus. To optimize serum phosphorus levels throughout the dose cycle, Investigators may increase the dose of KRN23 in 0.5 mg /kg 
increments in those subjects whose trough serum phosphorus level ([ADDRESS_35232] prior to the next dose) is below the lower limit of normal (< 2.5 mg/dL) on 2 consecutive 
measurements performed at 4 -week intervals (Table [IP_ADDRESS]). Trough levels of serum 
phosphorus may be evaluated through unscheduled assessments, if  necessary , until a new 
maintenance dose is established  (defined as a dose at which 2  consecutive trough serum 
phosphorous levels are within the normal range [2.5 – 4.0 mg/dL]). Dose titration may continue up to a dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q4W, until fasting trough serum phosphorus is ≥ 2.5 mg/dL ( Table [IP_ADDRESS]).  
If, after a subject reaches a dose of 2.0 mg/kg Q4W, the trough serum phosphorus level remains < 2.5 mg/dL on 2 consecutive trough assessments performed at 4- week intervals 
beginning after the second administration of the 2 mg/kg dose, the dosing frequency may be increased to Q2W  (Table [IP_ADDRESS]). Subjects transitioning to Q2W dosing should initially

Proprietary and Confidential Page 67 
• Maintain serum phosphorus levels at the lower end of the age- appropriate normal range  
• Improve or heal osteomalacia, thereby [CONTACT_35702], including 
fractures, bone and muscle pain, and muscle weakness and loss of function. 
Thus, the primary efficacy assessments in the study are as follows: 
• Serum phosphorus:  KRN23 binds to and inhibits FGF23. FGF23 plays an important rol e 
as a specific regulator of serum phosphorus levels. Increasing serum phosphorus directly bears on the hypophosphatemia and consequent osteomalacia that characterize TIO and ENS-associated osteomalacia. Serum phosphorus levels will be measured pre- and 
post-treatment as indicated in the Schedule of Events (
Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, 
Table 2.4, Table  2.5, and Table 2.6). 
• Trans-iliac crest bone biopsy:  To assess O.Th, OS/BS, OV/BV, MLt  as well as other 
parameters, a bone biopsy will be performed pre- and post- treatment as indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1 and Table  2.2). Note that the bone biopsy is not required at 
the Baseline Visit if a previous bone biopsy performed within 12 months of Screening 
confirmed the diagnosis of osteomalacia, the subjects’ clinical manifestations have not changed significantly since the time of the previous biopsy/diagnosis, and the tissue collected at that bio psy is made available for testing for this protocol. Bone biopsy

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Outcomes Measurements  
Gross motor impairment, including diminished walking ability, pain, and muscle weakness 
are potential complications associated with TIO -related skeletal deformities. Endpoints to 
establish clinical outcomes associated with KRN23 treatment include upper and lower extremity strength and function, walking, and reaching ability and mobility.  
Hand-Held Dynamometry (HHD) : To assess muscle strength, HHD will be administered 
pre- and post- treatment as indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 2.1 and Table  2.2). 
Formal training will be conducted with the trained clinicians administering the HHD testing 
to standardize technique and minimize variability. The maximum voluntary isometric contraction against a dynamometer will be used to measure bilateral strength in the following muscle groups: elbow flexors, elbow extensors, knee flexors and knee extensors. Absolute values will be recorded, and the percent of predicted values will be calculated using 
published normative data based on age and gender ( Bohannon 1997; Peters  et al. 2011). 
Sit-to-stand (STS ): To assess lower extremity strength and mobility, the STS test will be 
administered pre - and post- treatment as indicated in the Schedule of Events (Table 2.1, 
Table 2.2). Formal training will be conducted with the trained clinicians administering the 
STS test to standardize technique and minimize va riability. Absolute values will be recorded.  
Weighted Arm Lift (WAL) : To assess upper extremity strength, mobility and reaching ability, 
the WAL test will be administered pre - and post-treatment as indicated in the Schedule of 
Events (Table 2.1 and Table  2.2). Formal training will be conducted with the trained 
clinicians administering the WAL test to standardize technique and minimize variability. Absolute values will be recorded. 
6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT): The 6MWT will be administered by a trained clinician 
(preferably a licensed physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) in accordance with general principles set forth in the American Thoracic Society guidelines (
ATS 2002) . Subjects will be instructed to walk 
the length of a premeasured course for 6 consecutive minutes. The total distance walked at 
the end of 6 minutes will be recorded in meters. The percent predicted values for the 6MWT will be calculated using published normative data based on age, gender, and height 
(Gibbons et al. 2001) . 
The 6MWT will be administered at Screening for practice purposes to minimize training effects. The 6MWT will also be administered at Baseline (Day –2), and Weeks 12, 24, and 
48. Assistive devices may be used; any use will be noted on the CRF.

[IP_ADDRESS] Ambulatory  Assessment  
To assess ambulatory status, subjects will be asked whether they typi[INVESTIGATOR_35644], need to use an assistive device (eg, cane, crutches, walker) , or cannot 
walk. Ambulatory status at Baseline will be recorded retrospectively. Prospective assessment 
of ambulatory status will occur at all site visits beginning from the first site visit after 
appropriate approvals and consents are obtained and then as indicated on the Schedule of Events (Table 2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, and Table  2.6).  
7.5.5 Pharmacokinetic Measurements  
To assess KRN23 concentration and possible accumulation, serum levels of KRN23 will be 
evaluated as a PK parameter in this study. Predose and postdose blood samples will be 
obtained as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4,

[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Tests for Safety  
A comprehensive serum metabolic panel (Chem -20), complete blood count, and urinalysis 
will be used as routine screens to assess KRN23 safety. Certain analytes ( ie, ALP and serum 
phosphorus) in the routine Chem- 20 panel are also designated as PD/efficacy parameters in 
this study ( Section 7.5.3). KRN23 biochemical parameters of interest include serum 
25-hydroxyvitamin D, lipase, amylase, total calcium, creatinine, FGF23, iPTH; and urinary 
calcium and creatinine.  Reflexive testing for serum amylase isoenzymes will be performed if 
serum amylase levels are elevated by ≥ 2x the upper limit of the reference range.  
Blood and urine samples will be collected at Screening, B aseline, and regular intervals 
throughout the study as indicated in the Schedul e of Events (Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, 
Table 2.4, Table  2.5, and Table 2.6). The local lab at the investigational site  will be used to 
measure labo ratory safety parameters required  for study eligibility  (except FGF23). Fasting 
for a minimum of 8  hours (overnight) is required prior to each blood draw; the duration of 
fasting will be recorded on the CRF. Twenty -four-hour urine collection is required to assess 
urinary phosphorus:creatinine and calcium:creatinine ratios; urinary phosphorus (a PD 
parameter, Section  7.5.3) will also be obtained from 24-hour urine samples.  
Clinical laboratory parameters to be assessed for safety are provided in  Table [IP_ADDRESS].1.

[IP_ADDRESS] Anti-KRN23 Antibody Screening  
To determine the immunogenicity profile of KRN23, blood samples will be obtained for 
analysis of anti- KRN23 antibodies (anti-drug antibodies [ ADA]) at predose and postdose 
time points as indicated in  the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table 2.3, Table  2.4,

[IP_ADDRESS] Renal Ultrasound and Glomerular Filtration Rate  
Renal ultrasounds will be conducted at pre dose and postdose time points as indicated in the 
Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table 2.5, and Table  2.6). 
Ultrasonographic findings of nephrocalcinosis will be graded on a 5-point scale 
(Verge et al. 1991). Central readings will be performed for all Screening and post- treatment 
renal ultrasounds to evaluate changes in calcifications and all other renal abnormalities from Baseline (ie, Screening assessment). Results obtained at Screening will serve as Baseline 
data. Central readers will be blinded to all other subject data.  
The eGFR will be calculated via urine collections at predose and postdose time points as 
indicated in t he Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, 
and Table  2.6). Results obtained at Screening will serve as Baseline data.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Echocardiogram 
ECHO will be performed at pre dose and postdose time points as indicated in the Schedule of 
Events (Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table 2.5, and Table  2.6). The goal is 
twofold: 1) assess for evidence of ectopic mineralization in the heart and aorta, and 
2) evaluate for signs of left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH) or cardiac dysfunction. Additional 
tests may be performed if any abnormalities are detected or if medically indicated. ECHO administration procedures will be standardized and results will be read centrally by a central 
reading procedure to ensure consistent criteria across the study are used to assess ECHO 
parameters by [CONTACT_21724].  Clinically significant abnormalities detected on ECHO will 
be promptly reported to the P rincipal Investigator for action as appropriate, including 
determining if an AE  should be recorded in the C RF. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram  
A standardized 12- lead ECG will measure PR, QRS, QT, and corrected QT intervals (QTc) 
at predose and postdose time points as indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, 
Table 2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, and Table  2.6). The goal is to evaluate both for 
LVH changes, as well as 
for changes i n conductivity and intervals. ECG administration 
procedures will be standardized , and results will be read centrally by a single central reader . 
The ECG results will be assessed for any clinically significant abnormality or relevant changes from Baseline, and these will be recorded as AEs on the CRF . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Imaging  
For subjects with TIO, if the tumor is visible and localized at Screening , it will be imaged at 
Screening and every 24 weeks  through Week 144 and then every 48 weeks (or at next 
scheduled visit ) for the remainder of the study (Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, 
Table 2.5, and Table  2.6) using the same radiologic imaging technique ( either CT scan or 
magnetic resonance imaging [ MRI]) used initially to identify the tumor. Screening images 
will be used as Baseline. If a subject has a historical scan obtained within 12 months of 
Screening, the historical scan may be used as the Screening image. In cases where the tumor 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment [ADDRESS_35255] scan or MRI 
(whichever is more clinically appropriate) will be performed. During follow -up, the same 
imaging technique (CT scan or MRI) that was used at Screening will be utilized  to assess 
tumor size . The radiologist will indicate whether tumor size and volume have changed over 
time. If applicable, tumor imaging will be assessed using the mint Lesion™ software.  
For subjects with TIO whose tumor was not identifiable at Screening, evaluations every 
48 weeks (or in alignment with regularly scheduled clinic visits) will be performed  beginning 
at Week 120 in an attempt to locate  the tumor ( Table 2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, and 
Table 2.6). The preferred imaging technique is 68Ga-DOTATATE positron emission 
tomography (PET)/CT. Octreotide -SPECT (SPECT/CT) or FDG -PT/CT may be used if 
68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT is not available. (If none of these methods are available, another 
imaging technique may be used at I nvestigator discretion.)  Imaging to locate the tumor may 
also be performed at unscheduled visits if there is clinical suspi[INVESTIGATOR_35627].  
If the tumor is located and determined to be unresectable, MRI or CT imaging (at the 
discretion of the Investigator) should occur within 21 (± 7) days of identification to assess 
tumor size , at an unscheduled visit if necessary, and thereafter according to the Schedule of 
Events (Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table 2.5, and Table  2.6). If the MRI/CT 
imaging following tumor identification has occurred within 3 months of the next scheduled MRI/CT assessment, that assessment will be skipped and the Schedule of Events will be 
followed thereafter. A subject whose tumor is identified and determined to be amenable to 
complete surgical resection may be removed from study (Section 7.3.3 ).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs  and Weight  
Vital signs will include seated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), heart rate in beats per minute, respi[INVESTIGATOR_11808], and temperature in degrees Celsius (°C). Vital signs measurements will be 
performed at pre dose and postdose time points as indicated in the Schedule of Events 
(Table 2.1, Table 2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, and Table  2.6) before any additional 
assessments are completed  and after the subject has rested for 5 minutes. At each site visit, 
weight (in  kilograms) will be obtained using a scale. Weight measurements will be used to 
calculate the appropriate KRN23 dose to be administered on a mg/kg basis. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations will be performed at pre dose and postdose time points as 
indicated in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, 
and Table  2.6). During the Treatment Extension Period, physical examinations will be 
performed at site visits only. Physical examinations will include assessments of general 
appearance; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; the cardiovascular, dermatologic, lymphatic, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems.

[IP_ADDRESS] Pregnancy Te sting and Contraception 
Female subjects of childbearing potential will have urine pregnancy tests at the time points 
specified in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2.1, Table  2.2, Table  2.3, Table  2.4, Table  2.5, and 
Table 2.6). Female subjects with a positive pregnancy test at Screening do not meet 
eligibility criteria for enrollment and will not be enrolled in the study. 
Additional pregnancy tests will be performe d at any visit in which pregnancy status is in 
question. A serum pregnancy test will be performed in the event of a positive or equivocal 
urine pregnancy test result, or can be performed if pregnancy test by [CONTACT_11864]. 
Pregnancy in subject or partner must be reported (Section [IP_ADDRESS]); pregnant subjects will be discontinued from the study.  
Experience with KRN23 in pregnant women is limite d. The study drug may involve risks to a 
pregnant female or unborn baby [CONTACT_35661].  
Female participants of child-bearing potential who have not undergone a total hysterectomy 
or bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_8936] -oophorectomy and are sexually active must consent to use a highly 
effective method of contraception as listed below from the period following the signing of 
the informed consent through Safety Follow-up (as described in Section 7.1). Sexually active 
male participants with female partners of childbearing potentia l must consent to use a highly 
effective method of contraception listed below from the period following the signing of informed consent through 12 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_35648]. Examples of highly effective methods (CTFG 2014)  include: 
• Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation (eg, oral, intravaginal, transdermal) 
• Progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (eg, 
oral, injectable, implantable)  
• Intrauterine device or intrauterine hormone -releasing system  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Male sterilization, also called vasectomy  
• Sexual abstinence (ie, refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject)

A DLT is defined as the occurrence of any of the following: 
• A Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_35256] 
• A confirmed serum phosphorus level of ≥ 6.5 mg/dL (defined as hyperphosphatemia) at 
any time after dosing 
If a subject experiences a DLT, the planned dosing for that subject will be evaluated by [CONTACT_429]. The outcome of this investigation will determine the subject’s continuation or withdrawal from the study , as described  in Section [IP_ADDRESS].  
7.5.7 Appropriateness of Measurements  
The assessments and timing of  assessments used in this study and the variables analyzed  are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_35649], hypophosphatemia, renal function, and 
vitamin D metabolism in patients  with TIO  and ENS -associated osteomalacia. The primary 
goal of treatment in TIO  and ENS -associated osteomalacia patients with inoperable  or 
incompletely resected  tumors/lesions is to normalize serum phosphorus levels and correct or 
minimize osteomalacia, fractures,  and bone and muscle pain.  
Trans-iliac crest bone biopsies will be performed at Baseline and at Week [ADDRESS_35257] bone biopsy is a well -established tool in research and clinical use for 
evaluating bone tissue in metabolic bone diseases such as renal osteodystrophy, 
osteomalacia, and osteoporosis. Cellular activity and the amount of bone can be accurately quantified by [CONTACT_35707], providing information that cannot be obtained through other imaging or biochemical studies ( Sullivan et al. 1992 ). Osteomalacia is characterized by 
[CONTACT_35708], reflecting a prolonged and defective mineralization process (Arnstein et al. 1967) . Specific histomorphometric parameters chosen to evaluate 
changes in osteomalacia with KRN23 treatment include osteoid thickness, osteoid surface/bone surface, and osteoid volume/bone volume, which are static parameters providing information about the amount of unmineralized bone ( Dempster et al. 2013) . 
In addition, mineralizat ion lag time, a dynamic modeling parameter representing the mean 
time interval between the formation of osteoid and its subsequent mineralization, will be evaluated ( Dempster et al. 2013) . In TIO, surgical resection of the tumor has been shown to 
lead to complete resolution of osteomalacia by [CONTACT_35709] (Shane et al. 1997) .

Proprietary and Confidential Page 78 
Hypophosphatemia is the cause of the consequent osteomalacia and other symptoms that 
result in clinical manifestations of TIO and ENS -associated osteomalacia. Serum phosphorus 
will be measured throughout the study to evaluate changes in response to KRN23 treatment. 
FGF23 plays an important role in phosphate homeostasis, and KRN23 binds to and inhibits 
FGF23; serum FGF23 levels will be monitored throughout the study.  
Additional assessments are included both as PD and safety indicators of potential secondary complications associated with treatment, including serum calcium, 1,25(OH)
2D, and urinary 
calcium and creatinine, as hypercalciuria may occur in the absence of hypercalcemia.  
Intact PTH  levels and TmP/GFR are routinely measured as a part of medical management of 
TIO. Biomarkers of bone formation (P1NP, ALP, BALP, osteocalcin ) and resorption (CTx) 
may provide an indication of treatment effect. The relatively extensive panel of biomarkers has been included in this study to provide the most information on relevant clinical laboratory parameters for endpoint confirmation and analysis. Where possible, timing of 
assessments has been coordinated with standard safety laboratory tests to minimize risk and discomfort and avoid unnecessary duplication of testing. 
Radiographs, DXA, and XtremeCT will be used to  evaluate healing of osteomalacia, prior 
fractures, and bone mineral density and bone mineral content . HHD, STS, WAL, and 6WMT 
will be used as performance measures and have been successfully used in other clinical 
development programs with similar diseases . BPI [INVESTIGATOR_35650]. BFI will be used as an  assessment of general fatigue.  The SF-[ADDRESS_35258] assessments such as 
recording of medical history, AEs and SAEs, physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistry, concomitant medications, and other routine clinical and laboratory procedures.  
Routine, non-invasive procedures will provide relevant indicators of possible renal and cardiac risk; renal ultrasounds and ECHO will be used to detect any calcinosis in susceptible organs. Tumor imaging will be used to assess any changes in localized tumor size in subjects with TIO. Since elevated free FGF23 has been associated with LVH in patients with chronic 
kidney disease, ECHO and ECGs will examine the potential risk in TIO  and ENS -associated 
osteomalacia subjects.  
7.6 Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size  
The completeness of the data affects the integrity and accuracy of the final study analysis. 
Therefore, every effort will be made to ensure complete, accurate, and timely data collection, and to avoid missing data. The procedures for handling missing, spurious, or unused data, and the detailed method for analyses will be presented in the Statistical Analysis Plan  (SAP);

7.6.2 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
[IP_ADDRESS] Analysis Populations  
Biopsy Analysis Set: The biopsy analysis set will include enrolled subjects with Baseline and 
follow-up ( either Week 48 or ET prior to Week 48) bone biopsy data.  
Full Analysis Set : All efficacy (except bone biopsy endpoints) , safety, and PK/PD  analyses 
will be performed on the set  of all subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_35259]. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Principles  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data. For continuous variables, the mean, the standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be provided. For discrete data, the frequency and percent distributions will be provided. Statistical tests will use 2 -sided 
alpha = 0.05 significance level. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals will also be presented. 
Analyses of the data will be performed whe n the first [ADDRESS_35260] -treatment bone biopsy and may occur at other time points. 
The final analysis will be performed at the end of the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Demography, Baseline Characteristics, and Disposition  
Demographics (age, sex , and race) and other baseline disease characteristics will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics for the Safety Analysis Set.  
The number of subjects screened, enrolled, treated, and completed will be summarized. 
Subject discontinuation from the study, and from treatment, will each be summarized including reason for discontinuation.

For parameters/assessments scheduled to be performed on the same day as the first study 
treatment, the Baseline value is the last value measured before the first administration of 
study treatment on that day. For parameters/assessments not scheduled to be performed (or scheduled but not performed) on the same day as the first administration of study treatment, the Baseline value is the value from the Screening Period measured closest to the 
day of first administration of study treatment.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Efficacy Analyses 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_35261] (2.5 mg/dL [0.81 mmol/L]), at 2 weeks after dosing ( between baseline and Week 24, on average) will be 
provided, along with the 2-sided 95% confidence interval. Additional analyses of serum phosphorus including observed values, change from B aseline, percent change from Baseline 
over time, and area under the curve will be summarized  from Baseline to Week 24 . 
Histomorphometric indices O.Th, OS/BS, OV/BV, and MLt at Baseline and Week 48, and 
their change from B aseline at Week 48 will be summarized.  
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Secondary and Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
Secondary and exploratory efficacy parameters will be summarized at Baseline and at each time point they are collected. The changes from B aseline (absolute and percent) will be 
described across subject s in terms of the mean and standard deviation and may be tested 
using the g eneralized estimating equation  method, if the model converges. The models for 
change from B aseline (absolute and percent)  will include B aseline, and time (weeks of 
treatment) as a categorical variable.  
Correlations among PD parameters and efficacy endpoints may also be assessed.  
The number and percent  of subjects with postdose serum phosphorus levels will be 
summarized by [CONTACT_35712]:  
• ≤ 2.5 mg/dL (0.81 mmol/L)  
• > 2.5 mg/dL (0.81 mmol/L) but ≤ 4.0  mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L) 
• > 4.0 mg/dL (1.13 mmol/L)  
Individual PD- time plots may be presented for each subject as well as mean PD -time plots. 
Additional analyses using statistical models may be performed. The relationship between 
various PD parameters as well as KRN23 concentrations may be examined.

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Analyses 
All subjects in the Safety Analysis Data Set will be included in all summaries of safety 
endpoints.  
The safety measures in this study are:  
• Incidence and frequency of AEs, treatment- related AEs,  and SAEs  
• Clinically significant changes from Baseline in vital signs, weight, physical examination 
findings, and clinical laboratory tests  
• ECHO, ECG, and renal ultrasound 
• Tumor imaging or dermatologic assessment of skin lesions 
• Concomitant medications  
• Anti-KRN23 antibodies 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Adverse Events  
All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by [CONTACT_1196], Preferred 
Term (PT), relationship to study drug, and severity. All reported AEs with onset during the 
treatment (ie,  treatment- emergent AEs) will be included in the analysis. For each AE, the 
percentage of subjects who experienced at least 1 occurrence of the given event wi ll be 
summarized. The numbers (frequency) and incidence rates of AEs and SAEs will be summarized. Special attention will be given to those subjects who died, discontinued treatment because of  an AE, or experienced a SAE (eg, summaries, listings, and narrative 
preparation may be provided, as appropriate). 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_35262]. Reference ranges 
and markedly abnormal results (specified in the SAP) will be used in the summary of laboratory data. Descriptive statistics will be calculated for each laboratory analyte at Baseline and at each scheduled time point. Changes from B aseline results will be presented 
in pre- versus post -treatment cross tabulations (with classes for below,  within, and above 
normal ranges). A listing of subjects with any markedly abnormal laboratory results will be provided. The frequency and percentage of subjects who experience abnormal clinical laboratory results (ie,  outside of reference ranges) and/or c linically significant abnormalities 
will be presented for each clinical laboratory measurement. A list of reference ranges standardized across clinical laboratories will be provided.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_35266] administration of study drug, including those 
reported before dosing at the Baseline (Day 0) study visit. Concomitant medications include medications that were taken at any time after the start of treatment within this study until the End-of-Treatmen t visit. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Exposure  
Exposure to KRN23 will be summarized using the number of doses and total amount of KRN23 administered to each subject during the study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti-KRN23 Antibody Assessment  
The anti-KRN23 antibody data, including ADA titer and neutralizing activity , will be listed 
and summarized by [CONTACT_35713]. 7.6.3 Determination of Sample Size  
Assuming the proportion of subjects with a phosphorus level above the lower limit of normal 
at 2 weeks after dosing, as averaged across dose cycles between Baseline and Week  24 is 
60%, a sample size of 15 subjects will provide a 95% confidence interval wit h the half width 
no greater than 24.8%. A reduction in excess osteoid is expected to be shown in all subjects with paired biopsies, with an estimated ≥ 50% reduction from B aseline in osteoid thickness. 
The sample size and study duration are believed to be sufficient to enable characterization of KRN23 effects on serum phosphorus levels, excess osteoid histomorphometric indices, and the safety profile of KRN23.

8.[ADDRESS_35275]. A validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for entry of the data 
into electronic CRFs. Data must be recorded on CRFs approved by [CONTACT_35714]. All information recorded on CRFs for this study must be consistent with the subject's source documentation.  
Initial data e ntry and any changes to the data will be made only by [CONTACT_11882]-
authorized users, and data entries and changes will be captured  in an electronic audit trail. 
An explanation of any data change should be recorded in the CRF . All data entered in to the 
CRF must be verifiable; therefore, CRFs will be routinely checked for accuracy, 
completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records by [CONTACT_11881]. 
The Investigator must allow direct access to all source documents.  
8.4.2 Data Quality Assurance 
Monitoring and auditing procedures developed by [CONTACT_11883]/or its designee will be implemented to ensure compliance with FDA and ICH GCP guidelines. Ultragenyx's designated representative (the Monitor) will contact [CONTACT_35715]. The Monitor will be expected and allowed to verify the Investigator's 
qualifications, to inspect clinical site facilities, and to inspect study records, including proof of IRB review, with the stipulation that subject confidentiality will be maintained in 
accordance with local and federal regulations,  including HIPAA requirements. The Monitor 
will also be responsible for confirming adherence to the study protocol, inspecting CRFs and source documents, and ensuring the integrity of the data. CRFs will be checked for accuracy, completeness, and clarity and will be cross -checked for consistency with source documents, 
including laboratory test reports and other subject records. Instances of missing or uninterpretable  data will be resolved in coordination with the I nvestigator.  
The Monitor will also investigate any qu estions concerning adherence to regul atory 
requirements. Any administrative concerns w ill be clarified and followed. The Monitor will 
maintain contact [CONTACT_35716] e-mail, telephone, facsimile,  and/or mail. The Investigator and all other site personnel agree

Proprietary and Confidential Page 87 
to cooperate fully with the Monitor and will work in good faith with the M onitor to resolve 
any and all questions raised and any and all issues identified  by [CONTACT_35717]. 
The Investigator understands that regulatory authorities, the IRB, and/or Ultragenyx or its 
designees have the right to access all CRFs, source documents, and other study 
documentation for on- site audit or inspection and will retain this right from the start of the 
study to at least [ADDRESS_35276] be notified should the Investigator/institution be unable to continue maintenance of subject files for the full [ADDRESS_35277] medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug- related. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) products.   
All AEs will be collected from the time the sub ject signs informed consent through up to 
12 weeks (approximately 5 times the elimination half -life) following the last dose of study 
drug (unless the subject starts treatment with commercial KRN23 [burosumab], see Section 7.1). In addition, the Investigator should report any AE that occurs after this time 
period that is believed to have a reasonable possibility of being associated with study drug. 
AEs ongoing at [ADDRESS_35278] a comment in the 
source document by [CONTACT_35718], recovered with sequelae, or stabilized.  
Suspected Adverse Reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possib ility that the 
drug caused the AE . For the purposes of expedited safety reporting, “reasonable possibility” 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. 
Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certaint y about causality than adverse 
reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment [ADDRESS_35279] caused death.  
SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that at any 
dose, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, results in any of the following 
outcomes:  
• Death 
• A life-threatening AE  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Persistent or si gnificant incapacity or disability ( substantial disru ption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions) 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Note that hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11818] (eg, for elective surgeries) are 
not considered SAEs. Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11819]- existing conditions that are 
scheduled after study enrollment are considered SAEs.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in the definition.   
8.5.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
Wherever possible, the severity of all AEs will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events  (CTCAE) version 4.0. The majority of AEs can be graded using 
this system. If an AE cannot be graded using the CTCAE criteria, it should be graded as mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening, or death using the following definitions: 
• Mild (Grade 1):  Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated and are of a minor 
irritant type, causing no loss of time from normal activities. Symptoms do not require 
therapy or a medical evaluation; signs and symptoms are transient  
• Moderate (Grade 2):  Events introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the 
subject and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually improved by [CONTACT_11884]; moderate experiences may cause some interference with 
functioning 
• Severe (Grade 3):  Events interrupt the subject’s  normal daily activities and generally 
require systemic drug therapy or other treatment; they are usually incapacitating  
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment 6 
26 September  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 89 
• Life-threatening (Grade 4):  Events that place the subject at immediate risk of death or 
are disabling 
• Death (Grade 5):  Events that result in death  
To make sure there is no confusion or misunderstanding of the difference between the terms 
“serious” and “severe,” which are not synonymous, the following note of clarification is 
provided. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific 
event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significa nce (such as severe headache). This is not the same as 
“serious” which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with 
events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as 
a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
8.5.3 Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator will assess the potential relationship of the AE to study drug using the 
following descriptions. For the purposes of reporting to regulatory agencies, AEs deemed as 
Definitely, Probably, or Possibly Related will be considered Related and those deemed Definitely Not or Probably Not Related will be considered Unrelated.  
Categories of attributions for “Not Relate d” events:  
• Definitely Not Related : This category applies to an AE that is clearly not related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure, beyond a reasonable doubt. That is, another cause of the event is most plausible; and/or a clinically plausible temporal s equence is inconsistent 
with the onset of the event and the exposure to study drug and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible 
• Probably Not Related:  This category applied to an AE that is doubtfully related  to the 
investigational ag ent/procedure. That is, an alternative explanation is more likely, eg, 
concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), known consequences of the disease under investigation or the relationship in time suggest that a causal relationship is unlikely  
Categories of attributions for “Related” events:  
• Possibly Related:  This category applies to an AE that may be related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is the AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug and that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors  
• Probably Related:  This category applies to an AE that is likely related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research int ervention, follows a known 
or suspected pattern of response, and is strongly associated with study drug exposure. 
Protocol Number: UX023T -CL201 
Amendment 6 
26 September  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 90 
An alternative explanation is less likely, eg, concomitant drugs(s), concomitant 
medication(s)  
• Definitely Related: This category applies to an  AE that is clearly related  to the 
investigational agent/procedure. That is, the AE is listed as a possible adverse reaction 
and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_4867], eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), known consequences of the disease under investigation or the relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed by [CONTACT_35719]) 
8.5.4 Adverse Event Reporting to Ultragenyx  
[IP_ADDRESS] General 
All AEs (ie , any new or worsening in severity or frequency of a preexisting condition) with 
onset after the subject signs consent for study participation must be promptly documented on the AE eCRF via the EDC system. The Investigator is responsible for evaluating all AEs, 
obtaining supporting documents, and ensuring documentation of the event is adequate. Details of the AE must include severity, relationship to study drug, duration, and outcome.  
All AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs informed consent through their 
EOS/ET Visit or final Safety Follow -up TC, as defined in Section 7.1. In  addition, the 
Investigator should report any AE that occurs after this time period that is believed to have a reasonable possibility of being associated with study drug.  
AEs ongoing at a subject’s EOS/ET Visit or final Safety Follow -up TC (Section 7.1 ) should 
have a comment in the source document by [CONTACT_35718], 
recovered with sequelae, or stabilized.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Drug Reactions, and Requirements for Immediate Reporting  
Any SAE that occurs at any time during the study, including a clinically significantly 
abnormal laboratory test result that is considered serious, must be reported within [ADDRESS_35280]'s treatment assignment or dosage. 
The reporting requirement for SAEs is from the time of signing of the ICF through the EOS/ET Visit or final Safety Follow -up TC, as defined in Section 7.1. 
SAEs will be reported by [CONTACT_35720]. Initial SAE reports must be followed by [CONTACT_3896]. These should include copi[INVESTIGATOR_11821]. Telephone reports must 
be confirmed promptly by [CONTACT_6972]. Follow-up SAE information must be submitted in a timely manner as additional information becomes available. All SAEs regardless of relationship to study drug must be followed to resolution or stabilization if improvement is not expected.

Amendment 6 
26 September  2019  
 
Proprietary and Confidential Page 91 
Any death occurring from signing of the ICF through the EOS/ET Visit or final Safety 
Follow-up TC (Section 7.1 ) must be reported to Ultragenyx or its designee within [ADDRESS_35281] notify the IRB/EC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, as 
soon as is practicable and in accordance with IRB/EC requirements and local law. A copy of this notification must be provided to Ultragenyx or its designee. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Urgent Safety Reporting  
The regulations governing clinica l studies state that the Sponsor and Investigator are required 
to take appropriate urgent safety measures to protect subjects against any immediate hazards 
that may affect the safety of subjects, and that the appropriate regulatory bodies should be notified according to their respective regulations. According to the European Union (EU) 
Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, “…in the light of the circumstances, notably the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the Sponsor and the I nvestigator shall take appropriate urgent safety measures to 
protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. The Sponsor shall forthwith inform the 
competent authorities of those new events and the measures taken and shall ensure that the Ethics Committee (EC) is notified at the same time.” The reporting period for urgent safety issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through the EOS/ET Visit or final Safety Follow-up TC, as defined in Section 7.1. Investigators are required to report any urgent 
safety measures to U ltragenyx within 24 hours. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting  
Ultragenyx or its designee will submit suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]R) to appropriate Regulatory Authorities (including Competent Authorities in all Member States concerned),  Ethics Committees, and Investigators as per local laws and 
regulations. Fatal and life -threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs will be submitted no later than [ADDRESS_35282] 
knowledge of the event.  
Principal Investigators are required to report any urgent safety matters to Ultragenyx or its 
designee within 24 hours. Ultragenyx or its designee will inform the Regu latory Authorities, 
Ethics Committees, and Investigators of any events (eg , change to the safety profile of 
KRN23, major safety findings) that may occur during the clinical trial that do not fall within the definition of a S[LOCATION_003]R but may affect the safety o f subjects participating in the clinical 
trials, as required, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The reporting period for urgent safety issues is the period from the signing of the ICF through the EOS/ET Visit or final Safety Follow -up TC, as defined in Section 7.1.

  1.0 INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND  
 
Brain metastases are the most common adult intracranial tumor, occurring in approximately 10% to 30% of adult cancer patients, and represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this population.
1 The risk of deve lopi[INVESTIGATOR_292503], with lung cancer accounting for ap proximately 
one half of all brain metastases.2 The prognosis of patients with brain metastases is poor.  
The median survival time of untreated patients is approximately 1 month.3  With treatment, 
the overall median survival time after diagnosis is approximately 4 months.4  The RTOG 
recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) describes three prognostic classes, defined by [CONTACT_654], Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS), and disease status.
[ADDRESS_356926] widely used treatment 
for patients with multiple brain metastases is WBRT .  The appropriate use of WBRT can 
provide rapid attenuation of many neurological symptoms, improve quality of life, extend median survival, and be especially beneficial in patients whose brain metastases are surgically inaccessible or when other medical considerations preclude surgery.
6,7  The use 
of adjuvant WBRT after resection or sterotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has been proven to be effective in terms of improving local control of brain metastases, and thus, the likelihood of neurological death is decreased.
[ADDRESS_356927] regimen used is generally at the 
discretion of the treating physician and often depends upon issues such as the severity of CNS symptoms, the extent of systemic disease, and physician preference.

 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292504] - 2 
More recently, a phase III randomized study (RTOG 9508) found that the combination of WBRT and SRS boost was superior to WBRT alone in selected patients.
[ADDRESS_356928] a stable or improved Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score at 6 months follow -up than were 
patients allocated WBRT alone.  Intracranial disease control and use of steroids were also improved with SRS in patie nts with multiple brain metastasis.
9  While the benefits of 
improved local control gained by [CONTACT_292515], many factors continue to limit the use of SRS.  This procedure is generally contraindicated in lesions larger than 3-4 cm in size.  In addition, while multiple lesions can be treated with SRS, the procedure 
can quickly become unwieldy as the number of lesions increases and dosimetric considerations may also start to increase the risk of toxicity.   
 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292505] (RA) (Varian Medical Systems , Palo Alto, CA) is a volumetric modulated arc 
technique that uses a single [ADDRESS_356929] using helical tomotherapy.  Generated plans demonstrated similar target coverage with improved critic al tissue sparing in patients with one to three metastatic brain metastases.
11  Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292506], highly conformal, radiation doses to different portions of the brain. With conventional WBRT, the entire brain is  treated to t he 
“macroscopic disease dose” due to the inability with conventional fields to selectively deliver dose to specific areas of the brain.  The conventional “macroscopic disease” dose is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_897] [ADDRESS_356930] indicated 
that patients at high risk of brain involvement, but without gross brain metastases, achieve high levels of intracranial control with lower “prophylactic disease” doses. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_292507] (PCI) dose for lung cancer is [ADDRESS_356931] 
definitive therapy to PCI or not.
12 These patients are known to be at high risk of brain 
metastases, up to 25% at 2 years. PCI reduced the 1 year incidence of brain metastases 
significantly from 18% to 8%. With Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292508], the whole brain at risk could be given a reduced PCI dose, while the gross disease seen on MRI can be boosted with higher doses known to lead to better local control. We feel that the reduced whole brain dose allowed by [CONTACT_292516], but with the possibility of reduced neurcognitive toxicity, as critical structures such as the white matter tracts and hippocampi [INVESTIGATOR_292509].     
 
Version: 3/22/2013 
 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292504] - 3 
Varian Medical Systems has notified and received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to use Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292510]. This technology is not considered an experimental dev ice. The standard of care for patients with 1 – [ADDRESS_356932] method, we believe that we can deliver increased dose to the gross disease , in a more convenient and time efficient 
manner, include patients who would not otherwise be SRS candidates,  and spare more 
normal brain tissue, which may translate into  improved local control and median survival. 
We believe that the risk:benefit ratio is favorable for patients who would be enrolled on this study due for several reasons: the current very poor prognosis of the condition, the use of an existing FDA approved technology, and the integration of a proven treatment into a more efficient regimen.   
 Given the limitations of the SRS boost technique, the purpose of our investigation is to evaluate an alternative strategy for giving WBRT with highly focal boost to gross visible lesions in patients with brain metastasis.  In this study, we plan to assess the tolerability of using volumetric modulated arc therapy (Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292505]) on patients with brain metastasis to simultaneously treat the entire brain with a concomitant focal boost to grossly identified lesions on MRI scan to try to improve local control and reduce neurocognitive toxicities.    This previous version of this study was a phase I dose escalation trial giving [ADDRESS_356933] (SIB) to a total of [ADDRESS_356934] experienced  a dose 
limiting toxicity (grade 3 or above) at least possibly due to study therapy. Also, no patients 
experienced local brain failure/progression at a site of treated metastatic brain disease. Based on this, we no longer feel that dose escalation to the gross brain disease is warranted and would proceed with a single arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_292511] [ADDRESS_356935] (SIB) to a total of [ADDRESS_356936] using an RA technique.  (see Section 11.4)

Global Function  Mini -Mental Status Examination  
Cognitive Function (self -report)  Medical Outcomes Cognitive Scale  
 
11.1.[ADDRESS_356945]- Revised (HVLT -R) 
The patient learns 12 words read to them 3 times; free recall is tested after each 
learning trial.  Delayed recall is evaluated after [ADDRESS_356946] requires about 5 minutes to complete.   
11.1.3 Mini- Mental Status Examination (MMSE)  
This is a brief, standardized tool to grade patients’ global cognitive function.  The MMSE begins with an assessment of orientation to place and time.  Next is a test of memory (immediate recall) by [CONTACT_292518] [ADDRESS_356947] is then asked to recall the three items previously repeated (delayed recall).  The final section evaluates aphasia and apraxia by [CONTACT_292519], repetition, compliance with a 3 -step command, comprehension of written words, 
writing, and copying a drawing.  The maximum score that can be obtained for the entire MMSE is 30 points.   
11.1.4 Cognitive Functioning Subscale of the Medical Outcomes Scale (MOS)(Self -
report)  
This [ADDRESS_356948] been reported for patients with cancer.  Scale is based on multip le 
choice questions asking about cognitive function where the item is present 1= all of the time to 6=none of the time.  Scored in five steps (data cleaning, changing out of range values to missing, item re -calibration and skip pattern recording, reverse 
scoring of items so that the highest score reflects the best health state, transforming

 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292504] - 8 
scores linearly to a common metric with a range of 0 -100, averaging across items 
in the same scale).  Completion time is estimated to be less than [ADDRESS_356949] 6 months, then 
every 6 months thereafter  (at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months).  A window period of 
+/- 6 weeks will be allowed to correlate with each study time -point visit.  
 
11.2 Quality of Life Evaluation 
11.2.1 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Brain (FACT -Br) 
This assessment is a commonly used instrument measuring general quality of life (QOL) reflecting symptoms or problems associated with brain malignancies across 5 scales: physical well -being (7 items); social/family well- being (7 items); 
emotional well- being (6 items); functional well -being (7 items); and concerns 
relevant to patients with brain tumors (23 items).  Patients rate all items using a five-point rating scale ranging from "not at all" to "very much."  The measure yields 
information about total QOL, as well as information about the dimensions of physical well -being, social/family well- being, emotional well- being, functional 
well-being, and disease -specific concerns.  Six additional experimental items 
request information regarding how much each dimension affects QOL, using a "0" (not at all) to "10" (very much so) rating scale.   
11.2.[ADDRESS_356950] 6 months, 
then every 6 months thereafter (at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months).  A window period of +/ - 6 weeks will be allowed to correlate with each study time -point visit.  
  
11.3 Toxicity and Outcome Assessments  
11.3.1 Imaging followup  
Patients will undergo brain MRI prior to study entry and at 1 month, 3 months and every 3 months thereafter or when otherwise indicated (eg. at onset of clinical deterioration).  A window period of +/ - [ADDRESS_356951] enhancing mass on MRI at baseline  using 
radiation oncology treatment planning software . This value will be recorded on the 
baseline form and every subsequent follow- up form.  The appearance (yes/no) of 
any new brain metastases will be recorded on all follow -up forms.   
11.3.[ADDRESS_356952] a volumetric measurement made at each study  
imaging follow -up using  the visit high resolution MRI scan and radiation oncology 
treatment planning software. Percentage change in volume from the original baseline volume will be calculated using the formula: [original volume – current 
volume] / original volume. Lesions with complete resolution will be noted as complete response (CR).  
11.3.4 Definition of CNS progression 
 
Version: 3/22/2013 
 Rapi[INVESTIGATOR_292504] - 9 
CNS progression will be defined as a > 25%  increase in volume for any tracked 
brain metastas is, or the appearance of any new brain metastasis on a follow -up 
MRI .  For lesions smaller than 1 cm in maximum diameter, a maximum increase 
of 50% in volume will be necessary to score as progression.  This caveat is included 
to account for potential variability in measurement, which will be most susceptible to proportiona te errors at smaller sizes.  For greater than 1 cm lesions, the definition 
will use a 25% rule for change.   
11.3.5 RTOG CNS toxicity determination  
Neurologic/brain toxicity assessment will be made during treatment and at each follow up (1 month, 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter) (See Appendix B  for 
definitions). 
11.3.6 Adverse Events (AEs)  
 Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is consi dered related to the medical treatment or procedure (attribution of unrelated, 
unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).  These events will be recorded for each subject and is subject to review by [CONTACT_292520] (D SMC).   
11.3.7 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Any adverse event that results with any of the following outcomes:  
• Death;  
• A life -threatening experience;  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081];  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity;  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or  
• Other medically important events.  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_64961], when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition.  These events will also be 
recorded for each subject and is subject to review by [CONTACT_292520] (DSMC).  In addition, these events will be reported to the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB).    
11.[ADDRESS_356953] been successfully 
generated in our department.  Therefore, the main question of feasibility is regarding whether the treatment setup and delivery can be accomplished in a “reasonable” period of time.  A typi[INVESTIGATOR_292513] 15 minutes.  We will define 2 treatment slots, or 30 minutes as a “reasonable” time for this treatment.  Therefore, this treatment will considered feasible if the treatment setup/delivery time is <30 minutes in >90% of treatment fractions.

machine is turned off to when the patient is released from the treatment couch.  This total time will need to be <30minutes for the treatment to be considered “reasonable.”   
 
12.0 DATA COL LECTION  
 
12.1 Data Fields  
The following data will be collected on each patient: name, date of birth, medical record number, tumor characteristics by [CONTACT_292521], radiologic results, performance status, radiation and chemotherapy treatment parameters, clinical outcome including local and regional control, overall survival, treatment complications, neurocognitive assessments, and QOL assessments.

12.3 Data Safety Monitoring 
12.3.1 Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
We will use the Winship Cancer Institute data safety monitoring committee chaired by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Suresh Ramalingam as an independent review. As per WCI policy, the DSMC monitors all investigator initiated studies and cooperative group studies at Winship. Each qual ifying study is reviewed at least once a year. Two of the first 5 
patients enrolled to investigator -initiated studies and 10% of total accrual is 
reviewed.  
 Once a chart is monitored, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_292514]. They have a 2 week period to respond to the findings. A summary report is submitted to the DSMC for committee review. Any serious unanticipated problem is reported to the IRB with due notice to the PI.  Included in the review: • Regulatory documents • Patient eligibility  
• Informed consent process  
• Accuracy and timeliness of data  
• Verification of source documents • Toxicity assessment process

13.[ADDRESS_356956] deviation, median and range.  Local control, regional brain control, progression- free survival and overall survival 
will be assessed using the  Kaplan -Meier method  with censoring as appropriate.  
Univariate and multivariate analysis will be performed with these endpoints to determine patient  factors that may influence outcome .  These curves will also be 
compared to previously published results as historical controls.  The results of the neurocognitive and quality of life surveys/tests will be plotted for each patient to assess for a general tr end over time.  The trend over time can also analyzed by [CONTACT_292522].  Each point in time can be compared with historical controls 
using a student’s t -test to determine whether there is a significant difference in the 
survey/test scores in patients on our study versus historical results.

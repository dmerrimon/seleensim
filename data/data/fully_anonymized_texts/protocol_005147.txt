STUDY DESIGN  This is a P hase 2 parallel - group, open label  study in  healthy adults 
18-65 years of age. A total of 
60 
subjects are planned to be  enrolled  
with 
up to 
30 at each of two sites.
 
This study has a screening period of 60 days, a treatment and 
observation period from Day 1  to Day 29, and a follow -up period 
through Day 182. Subjects enrolled at 
[LOCATION_003]MRIID
 will be matched 
by [CONTACT_654] ( ±3 years ) and gender  (both birth and self -identified)  with 
alphavirus naïve subject s enrolled at WRAIR .
  
This 
matching is done 
to ensure that demographic characteristics are comparable between 
the groups, not to pair data between two specific individuals. 
Details of visits, v isit windows, and procedures are  provided in the 
Schedule of Events (
Appendix A ). After signing the informed 
consent form, subjects will under go screening procedures up to [ADDRESS_704540] local 
injection site events (pain, redness, 
 swelling) and 
systemic events ( fever with oral temperature ≥ 100.4 º  F, chills, 
fatigue, malaise, headache, myalgia, arthralgia , and nausea).  Any 
other 
adverse events and
 medications used through 
Day 
29 
will also 
be reco rded. Blood will be collected at 
Day 1
 (before the injection) 
and Days 8, 22, 29, 57 
and 
182.

STATISTICAL 
METHODS  
 The primary immunogenicity analysis will compare prior alphavirus 
vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540541] -naïve controls on the proportion in 
each group 
 
who seroconvert at 
Day 
22 – three weeks after injection 
– where seroconversion is defined as a 4 -fold or greater rise over 
baseline in anti -CHIKV neutralizing antibodies as assessed by a 
luciferase - based assay. The statistical significance of the comparis on 
will be assess ed using a Fisher’s exact test. The percentage who 
seroconvert in each group will be presented along with its  95% CI 
calculated using the Wilson method. Similar methods will be used to 
compare groups on the percentage of subjects who achie ve 
a titer of 
at least 
40, 160, or 640 
 
at Day 22 (primary time point ) and on Days 
8, 57 and 182 
(secondary 
time
 points ). 
GMT will be assessed  using an analysis of co variance (AN COVA)  
with logarithmically -transformed, anti -CHIKV neutralizing titers 
(log 10) as the dependent variable and pre - exposure group , age, 
gender as fixed effect s and baseline titer as the covariate  in the 
model. The least square means and 95% CIs estimated from the 
model will be back -transformed and reported as the group GMT 
values.  The geometric mean ratio (GM R) of the two groups and its 
95% CI will be estimated from 
a
 model 
contrast
. 
Similar methods will be used to assess  neutralizing and total 
antibody titers to other alphaviruses (VEEV, WEEV, EEEV)  at other 
time points. Safety will be assessed 
primarily through the reporting 
of solicited and unsolicited AEs. S olicited AEs  will be summarized 
for the [ADDRESS_704542] day of its onset , the number of days 
the 
AE was 
reported, and the maximum severity of the AE. 
Groups will be 
compared on the incidence of each type of solicited AE using 
pairwise Fisher’s exact tests  
Unsolicited AEs will be su mmarized by [CONTACT_177346], by [CONTACT_540592].  Additional displays will summarize any SAEs or AEs that 
lead to withdrawal or death. 

 EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 9 of 81 Displays  of solicited and unsolicited AEs will present data separately  
for prior alphavirus vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] , alphavirus -naïve controls , 
and for all subjects combined. 
 
Sample Size and Power Considerations  
The sample size for this trial was based on the number o f subjects in 
the Fort Detrick Special Immunization/Special Procedures Program  
who are available for screening  at [LOCATION_003]MRIID .  Of the 
approximately [ADDRESS_704543] 95% of the alphavirus -naïve controls are 
expected to seroconvert in this t rial. Assuming that the alphavirus -
naïve group 
has
 a 95% seroconversion rate, a total sample size of 60 
subjects has 80% power to detect a significant difference between 
groups if the seroconversion rate in the prior alphavirus vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283289] 65% or  lower . Or, in other words, power is 80% to detect 
a difference between groups if the seroconversion rate in the prior 
alphavirus recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283289] 
[ADDRESS_704544] shown impaired immune respo nses to 
chikungunya vaccines in prior recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540542] .  The decrease in seroconversion in 
two of 
these trials was 
64% and 100% respectively
 (see section 1.3) . 
Therefore , this study i s adequately powered to 
detect 
immune 
interference on the order of one -half to one -third of what has  
previously been described.  
T
he power of other combinations 
of 
seroconversion rate and sample size can be seen in Table
 
[ADDRESS_704545] 80% 
power to detect a 30% difference between pre 
-
exposure groups 
in 
the incidence of any single or aggregate solicited adverse  event  
expected to occur in 5% of the subjects in one of the grou 
ps
. With a 
total of 60 subjects receiving  PXVX0317 , there is a 95% chance that 
an uncommon AE 
– 
one expected to occur in 5% of 
v 
accine
 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841] s – 
will be observed at least once in the trial.

1.1
 
Background  
1.1.1
 
Chikungunya Virus and 
Chikungunya Fever
 
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is  an arthropod 
-
borne alphavirus of the family 
Togaviridae
. The 
CHIKV  virion contains a positive -sense single -strand RNA genome with a long open reading 
frame coding for Capsid © and Envelope (E1, E2, E3 and 6K) structural proteins, together with 
four non 
-
structural proteins . Since the first  case reports of CHIKV in a 1952 
-
1953 outbreak in 
Tanzania (
Ross 1956 
)
, this disease has been endemic in Africa and parts of Asia with transmission 
occu rring through 
Aedes
 aegypti  and more recently via 
Aedes
 
albopi[INVESTIGATOR_40643]
 (
Powers 2007 
).
   
Beginning in 2014, 
CHIKV 
 
disease cases were reported among U.S. travelers returning from 
affected areas in the Americas and local transmission was identified in [LOCATION_012], Puerto Rico, and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. As of May 29, [ADDRESS_704553] been 
documented 
, as shown in 
Figure 
1
 
(
CDC 2018 
). Although mosquitoes are the primary mode of 
transmission of CHIKV, blood 
-
borne transmission via needle stick is possible. Maternal -fetal 
transmission has been documented during pregnancy (
Staples 2017 
).
 
Following an incubation period of 2 to 12 
 
days, acute clinical manifestations include high fever, 
rash, gastrointestinal complications, headache, muscle pain, nausea, fatigue, myalgia, and joint 
pain (
Borgherini 2007 
, 
Taubitz 2007 
, 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_269188] 2007 
). The most classic symptom of chikungunya 
is a debilitating polyarthralgia that is present in greater than 90% of cases. This acute phase 
resolves within several weeks, but joint pain and arthritis may persist for months or years in 
over 
30% of infected i ndividuals  (
Schilte 2013 
)
.  
There are currently n o approved vaccines to prevent  CHIKV infection or disease.  However, 
p
rotection against subsequent infection has been shown to correlate with the presence of anti
-
CHIKV antibodies 
that neutralize the virus 
in vitro
 (
Yoon 2015 
)
.  Such antibodies are readily 
induced by 
 
[CONTACT_540594].  But 
a 
major challenge stands in the way of  licensing 
any chikungunya vaccine : the virtual impossibility 
of conducting a field efficacy trial
, because 
outbreaks of chikungunya are so sporadic and short -lived.  From the time the first case is detected 
until the epi[INVESTIGATOR_540544] (
Beesoon  2008 
)
.

1.1.2
 
Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus and Vaccines  
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is an  alphavirus related to CHIKV (
Figure 2). 
Humans infected with  VEEV develop a febrile illness, often with severe headache, averaging 1 –5 
days after exposure. Dissipation of febrile illness coincides with the production of neutralizin g 
antibodies. The average case fatality rate of VEEV is <1%.  Children have more severe disease, 
are more likely to develop encephalitis and can be left with severe neurological complications.  
VEEV has been recognized as a potential biological weapon beca use of its high attack rate with  a 
debilitating illness and its adaptability to aerosol dissemination.  Accordingly, the US Army has 
invested  much research i n this pathogen and developed experimental vaccines to protect those who 
handle VEEV in the laborat ory ( Wolfe 201 3 ).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 21 of 81  Figure 2 : Phylogenetic tree of alphaviruses showing the relative positions of CHIKV and 
the IAB strain of VEEV from which the TC83 vaccine was made.  
 
Two vaccines for VEEV administered to laboratory workers at [LOCATION_003]MRIID under IND are a live  
attenuated virus vaccine  (TC83)  and an inactivated virus vaccine  (TC84).  TC-83 was created by 
[CONTACT_540595] E2 and the 5′ untranslated region are responsible for the attenuated phenotype of 
TC-83 (Taylor 2017 ).  TC83 is the most widely used but has a significant (26%) non- response 
rate.  Non -responders who require immunity are generally offered the inactivated TC84 vaccine.    
 
Laboratory workers at [LOCATION_003]MRIID may have also received  investigational formalin -inacti vated 
vaccines for Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEEV) and /or Western Equine Encephalitis (WEEV) 
Viruses  (Reisler 2012 ) . 
 

 / EBSI -CV-317-[ADDRESS_704554] demonstrated immune responses to an alphavirus vaccine may be impaired among 
individuals who previously received a vaccine for a heterologous alphavirus.  In one such study, 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540545] a GMT of neutralizing antibody 
of 300 (96.6% seroconversion) while those who received the TC83 vaccine a month prior 
developed only a GMT of 10 to CHIKV and only 36% seroconver ted (McClain 1998 ).  While the 
authors attributed this to impaired replication of the live attenuated CHIKV vaccine virus due to 
cross -reacting T cells or non-neutralizing antibodies, a similar phenomenon was also observed 
when a  formalin inactivated CHIKV vaccine was given to prior recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540546], EEEV and 
WEEV vaccines ( DeMeio 1979 ).  This phenomenon has been dubbed “alphavirus immune 
interference” . While antibody responses to chikungunya were impai red in these studies of prior 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540547]83, there is no evidence  that the non-responders were more susceptible to 
chikungunya.  Horses also demonstrate d impaired immune responses to the second of two 
sequential alphavirus vaccines ( Van der Wagen 1975 )( Calisher 1973 ).  Challenge studies, though 
not consistently showing cross -protection, also do not show  evidence that clinical outcomes are 
worse in prior recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540548] (Jochim 1974 ) or experimental 
infections ( By[CONTACT_7943]  1964 ). 
 
1.2 Name [CONTACT_540647]0317 is the Sponsor’s research name [CONTACT_540648] -Like Particle Vaccine 
(CHIKV -VLP vaccine) . PXVX0317 is a field -formulated vaccine with two components: CHIKV -
VLP and Alhydrogel® adjuvant .  The final dose of the CHIK -VLP  is 40mcg per vaccine dose. This 
dose was selected from preliminary data generated by [CONTACT_21639]-going PXVX -CV-317-001 P hase 2 
study [unpublished data].  CHIKV -VLP s are comprised of three recombinant CHIKV structural 
proteins derived from CHIKV Senegal strain [ZIP_CODE]: Capsid ( C, 35 kDa), E nvelope 1 (E1, 55 kDa), 
and Envelope 2 (E2, 50 kDa) in sterile aqueous buffer.  CHIKV -VLP is essentially identical to the 
VRC -CHKVLP059 -00-VP vaccine used in the studies described below. Alhydrogel is a 2% (w/w) 
aqueous  suspension of aluminum hydroxide.

All injections were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events report ed. The most common 
local reaction was mild injection site pain (36%) and the most common systemic reaction was mild 
malaise (24%). No moderate or severe reactogenicity was observed.  
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all dose groups after the second

The NIH’s VRC 704 was a Phase 2 trial conducted at 
multiple CHIK

controlled study with 200 subjects 
receiving 20 µg of CHIKV -VLP and 200 receiving placebo in a 2 
-
dose series at Weeks 0 and 4.  
The stu dy was initiated in 2016 and completed in 2018.  Approximately 20% of subjects 
demonstrated detectable anti -CHIKV neutralizing antibodies at baseline.  CHIKV -VLP appeared 
safe and well tolerated in subjects who were followed through Week 72, with no relate d SAEs or 
other safety concerns. CHIKV -VLP appeared highly immunogenic, with a GMT of 2004.5 and 
99.5% of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540549] 8.  A boosting effect of CHIKV -VLP 
was also observed in subjects with baseline anti -CHIKV neutralizi ng antibodies. 
Specimens from VRC 704 were also analyzed at 
Emergent

analysis was performed on subjects without pre -existing anti -CHIKV neutralizing 
activity.  Using a more stringent 80% neutralization cutoff (NT 80), the GMT was 123 at Week 4 
and 1701 at Week 8.  Although antibody levels declined with time, as would be expected, the GMT

Rationale  
for the Current Study
 
and Military Relevance
 
This clinical trial is designed to develop our understanding of immunologic cross -reactivity 
between alphaviruses as it pertains to this chikungunya vaccine candidate.  Specifically, this study 
will help us determine: (1) Does previ ous exposure to heterologous alphavirus antigens 
diminish 
or enhance the immune response to this chikungunya vaccine candidate? And: (2) Does this 
chikungunya vaccine candidate boost pre -existing or induce de novo immune responses to other 
alphaviruses?   
If alphavirus immune interference is seen with this chikungunya vaccine, interpretation of post -
vaccination titers in field studies will have to account for previous alphavirus exposure, and 
additional studies will be required to determine if this 
diminish
ed response leads to decreased 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 27 of 81  efficacy in preventing chikungunya disease.  The possibility of alphavirus immune interference is 
also of particular relevance to the US Department of Defense 
 
which has for years i nvested in the 
development of 
vaccines for VE
EV, EEE 
V
 and WEE V because of their potential use as biological 
weapons  (
Wolfe 2013 
)
.  If the entire force is to be vaccinated against these viruses, it will be 
important to know if and how concurrent or subsequent administration of  a chikungunya vaccine 
will be impacted.  
Regarding (2), the question of whether this vaccine candidate will boost or induce humoral and 
cellular immune responses to other alphaviruses is also relevant to the design of field studies.  
While conducting a fie ld efficacy study of a vaccine against CHIKV appears epi[INVESTIGATOR_540551], it may be possible to design a study of that same candidate to show 
whether it impacts 
immunity to related  alphavirus es that are considered  potential pandemic threats (
Hotez 2017 
)
 
(
Lwande 2015 
).
  
E
xperts have recommended Iquitos, Peru, as a suitable location for a field study 
of a chikungunya vaccine based on recurring epi[INVESTIGATOR_540552] , which shares the same 
mosquito vector  as CHIKV  (
Rezza 2019
). In addition, transmissi on of VEEV and Mayaro viruses 
occurs in some districts of Iquitos , making this a potential site for testing the vaccine’s impact on 
immunity to those viruses 
(
Forshey 2010
)(
Morrison 2008 
).
 
The population 
 
available to participate in this study at Fort Detrick 
([LOCATION_003]MRIID) 
provides a 
unique opportunity to study both whether pre -existing immunity to alphaviruses impacts the anti -
CHIKV immune response and whether the vaccine elicits cross -reactive immune respon ses to 
other alphaviruses. Researchers will have the opportunity to conduct in 
-
depth immune analyses on 
individuals serially exposed to antigens from multiple alphaviruses.  Serum 
w
ill
 
be collected for 
the determination of neutralizing, 
total 
, and cross
-reacting antibodies.  Resources are also available 
to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for comparison 
s
 of cellular immune 
responses to this vaccine  among those with and without prior alphavirus immunity.  
In addition, this study allows us to closely study the safety of this vaccine in individuals with 
previous alphavirus immunity.  This vaccine has already been 
 
used in several hundred individuals, 
including about [ADDRESS_704559] already received multiple alphavirus vaccines without any unique safety signal 
emerging.  Nevertheless, this study will provide additional safety data on this vaccine among those 
previously exposed to live at tenuated VEEV to better assure the investigators and inform the 
consent of participants who will receive this vaccine in areas endemic for VEEV and other 
alphaviruses.

The regimen of PXVX -0317 selected for 
this study is 40 mcg of VLP plus alum adjuvant 
administered in 
a single 
IM dose on Day 1.  This regimen was selected by [CONTACT_540597] -0317- 001 referenced above.  All regimens tested were given to groups of 50 to

%) 
at Day [ADDRESS_704561] glimpse at the safety and 
immunogenicity of this vaccine in the context of prior alphavirus exposure.  This data will be 
important to the design of field studies.  If, for example, the vaccine is less immunogenic in those 
with prior alphavirus immunity, field studies in areas where other alphaviruses are endemic 
should 
account fo
r this in determin ing appropriate  immunogenicity end- points.  In addition, the 
in-depth immune analyses planned for the samples collected in this study may yield insights 
relevant to the VEEV vaccine development effort.

Risks of Study Participation  
[IP_ADDRESS] 
 
Risks 
with 
PXVX0317
 
The injection of 
PXVX0317 
, like other injections, can cause pain, redness, or swelling at the 
injection site. These types of reactions are generally mild. Less commonly, it can cause itching, 
bruising, or infection.   
In an earlier study, the majority of side effects following any injection were mild (29.6%) or 
moderate (21%) and rarely were severe (7.2%). These types of reactions usually happen within a 
day after injection and typi[INVESTIGATOR_31228] [ADDRESS_704562] rece 
nt data on the incidence of adverse 
events following PXVX0317 are provided in Section [IP_ADDRESS].   
PXVX0317  does not contain any CHIKV virus and 
can
not cause CHIKV infection. There may be 
other side effects from PXVX0317  that are not common and that we do not yet know about. 
Participants will be advised to tell the study staff about any side effects they may think they are 
having. 
For the study population who will continue to require investigational vaccines for potential 
occupational exposures, there is a hypothetical risk that 
PXVX0317
 could influence the immune 

 EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 29 of 81  responses to subsequent alphavirus vaccines.  Whether this influence would be positive or 
negative is 
unknown 
.  Considerable experience has accumulated at [LOCATION_003]MRIID with repeated 
administration of multiple alphavirus vaccines in this population with no evidence yet of 
clinically significant adverse health effects (
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2289]  2004 
). 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] 
 
Risk of Allergic Reaction  
With any vaccine, there is a risk of severe allergic reaction.  Although such reactions have not been 
reported with this vaccine, they have occurred with other vaccines containing some of the same 
ingredients.  Symptoms o f allergic reaction include:  
• Rash  
• Wheezing and difficulty breathing  
• Difficulty swallowing  
• Dizziness and fainting  
• Swelling around the mouth, throat or eyes  
• A fast pulse  
• Sweating  
 
Participants will be directed to inform study staff immediately if experienci 
ng any of these 
symptoms.  
[IP_ADDRESS] 
 
Risks with Blood Draws  
Blood drawing may cause pain, bruising, feeling faint, fainting, needle site infections, swelling, 
and rarely other infections. Bruising at the site of blood drawing can be prevented by [CONTACT_540598]. To reduce the risk of infection, we will wipe the area clean with 
alcohol and use sterile (germ -free) equipment.

Risks of Positive Screening Test for HIV, Hepatitis B and C  
At the Screening visit, participants will be tested for hepatitis  B and C and HIV. If blood tests 
show that a participant has HIV or hepatitis B or C, study staff are required by [CONTACT_540599]. Participants will be informed of this.  The test 
results reported to Marylan 
d Health Department will contain the participant’s name, contact 
[CONTACT_3031], including address and telephone numbers, and the type of testing that was done. If 
the participant is in the military, study staff are required to report the same kind of informa tion to 
military preventive medicine service. As a result, this information may end up in the subject’s 
military medical record and may be reported to their chain of command.  
 
Receiving information that any health screening tests are abnormal or that tests for HIV and 
hepatitis B or C are positive may upset participants.  The study doctors will discuss their health 
results face -to-face (and notify their primary doctor at their r equest).  Counseling will be available 
to the study subject, if they wish. A positive HIV status could limit a participant’s ability to obtain

Risks to Pregnancy  
If potential participants 
are 
females who can become pregnant and want to take part in this study, 
they will be informed that 
PXVX0317
 has not been thoroughly evaluated for potential risks to 
unborn or nursing children.  Participants will be instructed not to get pregnant or breastfeed while 
taking part in this study. Female participants must have a negative pregnancy test at screening a nd 
again immediately before vaccination, however pregnancy tests are not 100% accurate.  
Participants will be advised that the only completely reliable methods of birth control are not 
having sex or surgical removal of the uterus.  Other methods, such as t he use of condoms, a 
diaphragm or cervical cap, birth control pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], IUD, or sperm killing products are not totally 
effective in preventing pregnancy.   
If a participant becomes pregnant or feels she might be pregnant, she will be advised to contact 
[CONTACT_540600] [INVESTIGATOR_37105].  If a participant becomes 
pregnant, the study team will ask permission to contact [CONTACT_540601].  
[IP_ADDRESS] 
 
Risks to Confidentiality  
Efforts will be made to keep participants’  personal health information confidential.  In order to 
maintain confidentiality, paper study records will be stored in a secure location such as a locked 
office or locked cabinet. Electronic data will be password -protected. Electronic study records and 
samples taken will be coded with a number, not the participants’ names. Records will only be 
shared with authorized personnel and only in connection with carrying out the obligations relating 
to the study.  
Although efforts are made to protect the research s tudy records, there is always a risk that someone 
could get access to the personal information in research records or other information researchers 
have stored about participants.

4.1
 
Recruitment and compensation for study participation 
 
Informed consent will be obtained prior to any study procedures. Prior to agreeing to participate 
in the study, volunteers at either site will participate in an information session about the study. The 
investigator or designee will explain the study, outline participation requirem ents, review the 
consent form in detail with volunteers, and then answer any questions. Volunteers will then be 
afforded ample time to read the informed consent form and ask questions. If a volunteer decides 
to participate , he/she will sign and date the informed consent document.  
  
The recruitment process will in general be similar for both military and civilian personnel. 
However, special effort will be made to ensure that military personnel are not unduly influenced 
or coerced into participating by [CONTACT_540603]. A signed copy of the 
informed consent will be provided to the volunteer before any study procedure is performed.  
 
 
4.1.1
 
Recruitment at [LOCATION_003]MRIID  
Recruitment will be done  via web -based advertising ([LOCATION_003]MRIID E -news), recruitmen t flyers and 
email blasts . The target population for this study is not in the chain of command of the study team, 
and also very few (if any) Alpha -virus vaccinated personnel are active duty military.  Thus, group 
briefings of military members (e .g. in formation), where influence of rank would possibly be of 
concern, are not planned.   
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_704577], Facebook , Instagra m or other social media websites. Web -
based advertising ( www. clinicaltrials. army.mil 
), word of mouth, and the 
WRAIR CTC database 
will be used to contact [CONTACT_540604]. Potential volunteers of 
any
 ethnic background, 
education, and income will be  residents of the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. An institutional 
review board (IRB) -approved recruitment script will be read during all phone and face -to-face 
contacts with potential study subjects. All recruitment materials will be submitted to the W RAIR 
IRB for review and approval prior to use. Recruitment will be by [CONTACT_105]- coercive means.  
 
 
4.1.[ADDRESS_704578] deposit for enrolled visits 
from the 
WRAIR CTC

an opportunity for question and answer from study investigators and staff . In order to participate 
in the study, volunteers must also sign a separate consent form for HIV testing.  
For further details 
on informed consen 
t, refer to 
S
ection [ADDRESS_704580] who signs an ICF will receive a sequential three -digit identificatio n number unique 
to the site 
(
e.g.

be assigned a subject 
identification 
number with the following format: C V317002- two-digit site 
number -three digit 
identification 
number, e.g., CV317002- 01-001. Subject numbers will also be 
sequential since screen failed subjects will be entered into the EDC system.  
Each site will maintain a screening 
enrollment 
log to record the enrollment or the reason(s) for 
screen failure for all subjects who receive a 
subject identification 
number. 
Reason for screen failure 
will also be captured in the EDC disposition eCRF.  
Re-screening : 
Subjects who 
meet exclusion criterion 
1 
(acute febrile illness) at the time of their scheduled 
enrollment may be re -screen ed after resolution of their acute illness . Subjects who meet exclusion 
criteria 6, 8, 14 
 
or 15 (prohibited travel, 
medications
, vaccines  or partic ipation in another clinical 
trial)  may be re -screened after the appropriate duration has passed.  
There may be situations in 
which an eligi ble subject is not able to be 
vaccina 
ted within [ADDRESS_704581] ID number .

Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation 
 
(PD) 
 
is defined as any occurrence involving a procedure that did not follow 
the study protocol , applicable procedures, and/or regulatory requirements.  The Investigator is 
responsible for conducting the study in accordance with the protocol. Any deviation from the 
protocol must be documented in the study file. In addition, deviations must be report ed to the IRB 
as applicable. Subject -specific deviations must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and 
in the subject’s protocol deviation eCRF. The  Sponsor  will review all protocol deviations on an 
ongoing basis and will be responsible for categorizing protocol deviations as Impor tant Protocol 
Deviations (IPDs) 
-
 the subset of protocol deviations that may significantly impact the 
completeness, accuracy, and/ or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a 
subject's rights, safety, or well -being. PDs will be promptly reported to the Sponsor in accordance 
with the Clinical 
Monitoring Plan.

6.1
 
Definition s 
6.1.1
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant , regardless of 
the suspected causal relationship with study vaccine .  
The definition of an AE includes : 
•
 
A 
new
-onset symptom or disease  
•
 
An exacerbation of a pre -existing symptom or disease  
•
 
A new -onset laboratory abnormality considered by [CONTACT_210699]  
•
 
A new -onset symptom or disease that occurs as a result of a protocol -specified procedure  
The definition of an AE does 
not
 include:  
•
 
A pre -existing 
symptom or disease
 that does not worsen during the study 
(even if 
first 
disclosed by [CONTACT_210700])  
•
 
A 
medical or surgical 
intervention 
such as 
surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, or 
transfusion (although the condition leading to the procedure or a complication from the 
procedure 
may be an AE)
 
•
 
An uncomplicated pregnancy  
•
 
A dosing error without any resulting signs or symptoms  
•
 
Any other 
situation w
here an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred ( e.g. 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_540558] ) 
The Investigator 
will 
 
attempt to establish a diagnosis based on signs, symptoms, and other clinical 
information. Whenever possible, 
the Investigator will report 
a
n AE as a 
 
diagnosis rather than one 
or more 
signs
 or symptom s. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality meets the definiti 
on 
of an AE, a diagnosis or clinical signs and symptoms rather than the abnormal laboratory finding 
should be report ed if possible. If no diagnosis is known and clinical signs and symptoms are not 
present, but the laboratory abnormality is 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_5071], 
then 
it should be report ed 
as the AE .  
6.1.2
 
Solicited Adverse Event  
A solic ited adverse event (solicited 
AE)
 is a protocol -specified AE about which the Investigator 
or designee proactively asks the subjects during a protocol -specified time period.  Solicited adverse 
events for this study are  local events of 
pain, redness, 
and 
swelling at the injection site and systemic 
events of fever with 
oral temperature ≥ 
100.4 F , fatigue, chills, malaise, 
headache,
 myalgia, 
arthralgia , and na usea.   

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 51 of 81  6.1.3 Unsolicited Adverse Event  
An unsolicited adverse event (unsolicited AE) is an AE that is spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_540608].  
6.1.4
 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is an AE 
(either solicited or unsolicited) which meets any of the following criteria:
 
•
 
Results in death  
•
 
Is life -threatening  
•
 
Requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_115765] 
 
•
 
Results in a persistent clinically significant disability or incapacity  
•
 
Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
•
 
Requires  medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes  
•
 
Important medical event  
The Investigator will evaluate all AEs for seriousness using  
the above criteria.
  
“Life-threatening ” means that , in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], 
the subject was
 at immediate risk 
of death from the event as it occurred. It does not mean that the event  might have caused death 
had 
it occurred in a more severe form.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5187] a pre 
-
existing condition that did not worsen during the 
study is not considered an S AE. 
 
Important medical events may be 
considered serious at the discretion of the Investigator
. 
These seriousness criteria also apply to the Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_540559] 
6.9 
. 
6.2
 
Severity 
Grading
 
The Investigator  will grade all adverse events for severity . Adverse event s listed in  the Toxicity 
Grading Scale in  
Appendix B
 will be graded according to the criteria in the table .
 
Adverse events 
not listed in the Toxicity Grading Scale will be graded as follows:  
•
 
Mild (Grade 1) 
– 
No interference with activity  
•
 
Moderate (Grade 2) 
– 
Some interf
erence with activity  
•
 
Severe (Grade 3) 
– 
Significant; prevents daily activity
 
•
 
Potentially Life -Threatening (Grade 4) 
– 
as determined at 
ER visit or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 52 of 81  6.3 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator will assess all 
 
AEs, including solicited AEs,  for c ausa
lity 
(relationship to study 
vaccine), assigning one of these three categories: Not Related, Possibly Related, and Probably 
Related.  
An AE will be considered “ Not Related ” to study vaccine 
 
if any
 
of the following 
conditions
 are 
met:
 
•
 
An unreasonable temporal  relationship between administration of the study vaccine and 
the onset of  
the AE (
e.g., the event occurred either before, or too long after administration 
of the study vaccine  
for it to be considered related);
 
•
 
A causal relationship between the 
study vaccine
 and the AE is biologically implausible 
(e.g. injury as a passenger in an a utomobile accident);  
•
 
A clear alternative causality  for the AE is present ( e.g. 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_540560] a 
concomitant medication ). 
An AE will be considered 
“Possibly 
related ” if there 
is a reasonable possibility that the 
AE
 may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_106365] . 
An AE will be considered 
“Probably 
related ” if there is evidence  that the AE was caused  by [CONTACT_106957] . 
6.[ADDRESS_704595] the Investigator (or designee) 
immediately
 in the event of 
a 
non-fatal SAE .  All subjects experiencing an SAE will be 
evaluated
 by [CONTACT_540609] . In the event of a fatal SAE, 
the Investigator must provide the 
Sponsor with any 
available post-mortem findings, including 
histopathology.  
Additionally, the Sponsor  may request that the Investigator perform or arran ge for the conduct of 
supplemental  investigations  for one or more AEs .

Reporting Periods  
The reporting period for solicited AEs begin 
s
 immediately after the injection and continue s for 7 
days. The reporting period for 
unsolicited
 AEs begins  immediately  after study vaccine 
administration on 
Day 1
 and continues for 28 days after wards . AEs that correspond to solicited 
 
AE terms 
but 
occur outside of (or continue past)  the solicited AE  collection peri od are also

at risk until proven otherwise) and by [CONTACT_540611] a S[LOCATION_003]R .  Immediate and prompt notifications should be in the form of 
email, phone, or fax.   
The SAE F orm should be completed as thoroughly as possible and signe d by [CONTACT_540612]
. 
The SAE Form must include an assessment of causality  and 
should include a preliminary diagnosis if possible .
  
All SAEs assessed as not related must include 
an alternate causality.  

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 54 of 81  In order to avoid delays  in initial reporting , additional information  rega rding the SAE may be 
provided as a follow -up report. The Investigator may 
also 
modify the diagnosis, seriousness, 
and/or 
causality 
assessment 
based on this information. 
The investigator should not wait to receive additional information to fully document th 
e event 
before notifying the HSPB/WRAIR IRB of a related 
SAE
. In addition to fax, the complete report 
can be delivered to the address of the WRAIR HSPB 
at

The MM will
 
make the determination 
whether an SAE is a
 “suspected  unexpected serious  adverse 
reac
tion” (S[LOCATION_003]R) as defined in 21 CFR 312.32. 
•
 
Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE.  
•
 
Unexpected adverse reaction  means an AE that is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure 
or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.    
 
The Sponsor will report adverse events to FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32. 
 
Specifically, 
the Sponsor will report fatal or life -threatening 
S[LOCATION_003]Rs 
no later than 7 
calendar 
days after ini
tial 
receipt of the information and will report non 
-
life-threatening S[LOCATION_003]Rs  no later than 15 calendar 
days after determining that the information qualifies for expedited reporting. 
The MM will notify the Investigator of S[LOCATION_003]Rs and any other events that mee t criteria for  
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. The 
Investigator
 will notify the applicable  IRB of 
these events and adhere to any other applicable local reporting requirements.

or designee within 24 hours 
of their awareness of the pregnancy, using the Pregnancy Report Form. All pregnancies will be 
followed to outcome. Additional information regarding the pregnancy may be provided as a 
follow -up report.  
An uncomplicated pregnancy is not considered an AE.  Complications of pregnancy m ay qualify 
as AEs or SAEs and would therefore be documented and reported as specified above.    
The following should always be considered as an SAE:  
•
 
  Spontaneous pregnancy loss, including:  
− spontaneous abortion, (spontaneous pregnancy loss before/at 22 wee ks of gestation)  
− ectopic and molar pregnancy  
− stillbirth (intrauterine death of f etus after 22 weeks of gestation).  
•
 
Any early neonatal death (i.e. death of a live born infant occurring within the first 7 days of 
life).  
•
 
Any congenital anomaly or birth defec t (as per  
CDC MACDP 
guidelines) identified in the 
offspring of a study subject (either during pregnancy, at birth or later) regardless of whether 
the fetus is delivered dead or alive. This includes anomalies identified by [CONTACT_540613], amniocentesis  or examination of the products of conception after elective or 
spontaneous abortion.  
Furthermore, any SAE occurring as a result of a post -study pregnancy AND considered by [CONTACT_540614](s)/product (s) will be reported 
to the sponsor . While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information from 
former study participants, he/she may learn of a pregnancy through spontaneous reporting.

DoD Research Monitor  
The DoD Research Monitor is a physician independent of the Sponsor who is responsible for 
serving as advocate for the medical safety of volunteers in accordance with Department of 
Defense Instruction (DoDI) 3216.02. As such, 
he/she may:
 
•
 
Perform oversight functions and report their observations to the IRB or other designated 
officials on recruitment/enrollment procedures, the consent process, other study 
interventions and interactions, data matching, data collection, and analysis. 
•
 
Review ‘unanticipated problem involving risk to subjects or others’ (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) reports.  
 
The DoD Resea 
rch Monitor is authorized to:
 
•
 
Interview and examine subjects and their clinical data.  
•
 
Remove individual subjects from the study. 
•
 
Stop the research protocol in progress.

required.  
• Take any other steps necessary to protect the safety and well -being of human subjects 
until the IRB can assess their report.  
 
The DoD Research Monitor must review all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects 
or others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_16104]), se rious adverse event (SAE) reports, and all subject deaths.   The 
Research Monitor will provide an unbiased written report of these events promptly (within 48 
hours) to the WRAIR IRB by [CONTACT_648] , or by [CONTACT_6968] (
), or by [CONTACT_6972] . The DoD Research Monitor or their 
approved alternate will then submit written reports within 10 working days to the WRAIR IRB at 
the following address:  
  All DoD Research Monitor 
reports for unrelated SAEs and deaths should be kept with the corresponding SAE reports at the 
study site. 
 
The DoD Research Monitor or their approved alternate at a minimum must comment on the 
outcomes of the event or problem and in case of a serious adverse event or death, comments on 
the relationship to participation in the study.  They must also indicate whether he/she concurs 
with the details of the report provi ded by [CONTACT_458]. 
 
The DoD Research Monitor or their approved alternate should review all initial, follow up, and 
final reports for SAEs, unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others, and all 
subject deaths in a timely mann er, and provide their own independent report to the study team.

8.3 Database  
Source data will be entered and stored i n a web -enabled Medrio EDC system.  The Medrio EDC 
System is an integrated Software as a Service (SaaS) platform with a fully hosted Electronic Data 
Capture (EDC) system. All data entered will be hosted in Medrio's hosting provider data center. 
This study was built in Version # R40 and the system version will undergo upgrades over the course 
of the study. 
Medrio is an approved Emergent Travel Health vendor under 
 Contract 
Service Providers Qualification Procedure. The system is compliant wit h 21 CFR Part 11.  
 
8.3.1 Database Quality Control  
The study database will be tested by [CONTACT_540620], data managers and other users prior 
to approval for production use.  All changes made to the database after the database is in production 

 / EBSI -CV-317-[ADDRESS_704604] as the official 
requester for any database changes. All changes are tested and documented by [CONTACT_3433] e requester (data 
manager/designee) prior to release into production. 
Documentation of the database structure is produced, in the form of data definition report, after 
the database is tested and approved by [CONTACT_540621]/Designee. This docu 
ment 
provides the definition of the database structure and SAS or variable names for programming. 
 
8.3.2
 
Data Entry and QC  
The Medrio EDC system will be accessed on government -issued computers at the clinical trial 
sites with compliant security systems and institutional firewall as specified by [CONTACT_540622]’s 
Information Management Directorate (IMD).  These CAC -enabled government computers have 
the most up to date McAfee antivirus software automatically uploaded and updated on an ongoing 
basis.  All devices  meet DoD 8570 and AR 25- 2 requirements to maintain data.  
Data Management will perform and document three types of Quality Control checks to ensure  
Study Database Accuracy : 
• Early database  QC 
• Ongoing database  QC 
• Query  QC  
 
All issues found during the 
quality accuracy assessment will be resolved for the database quality

9.1
 
Sample Size Calculation  
The sample size 
here was chosen based on the number of subjects in the 
Fort Detrick Special 
Immunization/Special Procedures Program  ([LOCATION_003]MRIID) who are available for screening .  Of the 
approximately [ADDRESS_704611] 95% of the alphavirus -naïve controls are 
expected to seroconvert 
in this trial 
. Assuming that the alph
avirus -naïve group 
has
 a 95% 
seroconversion rate, a total sample size of 60 
subjects 
affords  8
0% 
power to de tect a 
 
significant  
difference between groups if the seroconversion rate in the prior alphavirus vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283289] 
65% or 
less
. Or, in other word s, power is 80% to detect a difference  between groups  if the 
seroconversion rate in the prior alphavirus recipi[INVESTIGATOR_283289] 
30 
percentage points lower than in the 
alphavirus -naïve group.   Compared to the previously cited studies in which decrements in the 
propo 
rtion of seroconversion of 64%
 (
McClain  1998 
)
 and 100%  (
Harrison 1971 
)
 (
DeMeio 1979
) 
were seen, this study is adequately powered 
 
to detect  immune  interference on the order of one -half 
to one -third of what has previously been described. 
In the event that we have overestimated the willingness of this pool of eligible subjects to 
participate, the ability to detect differences in the proportion of seroconversion of the same order 
as was previously shown by [CONTACT_540623] (36% versus  95% seroconversion), [ADDRESS_704612] 71% power to detect a 
significant 
difference. The power of other combinations of 
seroconversion rate and sample size can be 
seen in 
Table [ADDRESS_704613] 81% power to detect a difference between groups if the seroconversion rate is a low as 30% 
in the prior alphavirus vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], while 20 subjects per group provide 89% power to detect 
a diff erence if the seroconversion rate is 50% or lower among prior alphavirus recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  
This is 
certainly less than ideal in terms of designing a field study in an area endemic for other 
alphaviruses.  The decision to conduct such a study will be dependent on many factors and the 
residual possibility that a lesser degree of immune interference may have gone undetected will 
have to be considered.  If, one the other hand, immune interference on the order of that reported 
by [CONTACT_540624] a neutralizin g antibody response is entirely abrogated, data from this 
study would be sufficiently compelling to avoid recruiting for field studies in areas co 
-
endemic for 
other alphaviruses.

With respect to safety as a study endpoint, this study will have 80% power to detect a 30 % 
difference between pre 
-
exposure  groups  in the incidence of any single or aggregate solicited 
adverse event  expected to  occur in 5% of the subjects 
in one of the groups
. With a total of 60 
subjects receiving 
PXVX0317 
, there is a 95% chance that an uncommon AE 
– 
one expected to 
occur in 5% of vaccinees 
– 
will be observed at least once in the trial.
 
9.2
 
Treatment Period  
The treatment 
and observation period begins at the time of 
vaccine administration 
and extends 
through the Day 
29 
visit. The 
f
ollow -up period spans the time following the Day 
29 
visit through 
the end -of-study visit on 
Day 
182 (±14)
.  
9.3
 
Treatment Groups  
Subjects will 
a
ll receive the same vaccine 
 
regimen in an open label fashion 
. 
  There will be no 
randomization and no blinding as the primary endpoint ( immune response 
at Day 
22 
) is not subject 
to subjective interpretation .  The participants themselves alrea 
dy know whether or not they have 
previously received another alphavirus vaccine as such vaccines have only been available through 
IND and their administration required informed consent .   
The safety profile of this vaccine is
 well-
established for a phase [ADDRESS_704614] without evidence of any clinically s ignificant 
adverse health effects (
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2289] 2004 
).  
 
Subject matching will be done by [CONTACT_654] ( ±3 years ) and gender, both of which have been shown to 
play roles in vaccine immunogenicity in general  (
Klein 2016 
)
 and alphavirus imm une interference 
in particular (

)
, (

All tests will be carried out at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05 and no adjustment for  multiplicity 
will be applied .
 
Seroconversion A nalysis:  
The primary immunogenicity analysis will compare prior alphavirus vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540570] -naïve controls on the proportion in each group who seroconvert by [CONTACT_14181] -CHIKV 
neutralizing antibody at  Day [ADDRESS_704618]
 the hypothes es: 
H0: P1 = P 2   vs.  H1: P1 ≠ P2   
where 
 P1 and P 2 denote the proportion of subjects who s eroconvert in the prior alphavirus vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540571] -naïve controls, respectively. 
The significance of the comparison of the pre -exposure groups will be assess ed using a Fisher’s 
exact test. The percentage who seroconvert in each group will be presented along with it
s
 
95% CI 
calculated using the Wilson method. A sensitivity analysis of the comparison will be performed 
using a logistic regression model that incorporates age , gender , and baseline titer  as potential 
predictive factors.  Fisher’s test comparing seroconversion rates at other time points may also be 
performed.   Similar analyses of the proportion who seroconver t will be conducted on Days 8, 
29, 
57 and 182 for 
anti
-CHIKV neutralizing antibody and on Day 
s
 22 and 29 
 
for total 
anti
-CHIKV, 
total anti 
-
VEEV  and neutralizing anti -VEEV antibod 
ies
 (secondary endpoints). 
Threshold analyses : 
The percentage of subjects achieving specified thresholds (e.g., 
≥ 
40
, 
160, and 640 anti-CHIKV 
antibo 
dy titers
), and associated Wilson  95% CI s, will also be calculated 
for 
 
Days 1,
 
8, 22, 29, 57 
and 182 for neutralizing antibody 
and 
at Days 1 , 22 and 29 for total anti 
-
CHIKV , total anti 
-
VEEV  
and neutralizing anti -VEEV antibod 
ies 
(secondary end 
-
points) . The groups will be compared 
by 
[CONTACT_540633]’s exact tests 
on the 
percentage 
achieving each threshold.  
GMT  analyses : 
For the secondary comparisons based on GMT, the hypotheses tested will be  
H0: µ1 = µ2     vs.  H1: µ1 ≠ µ2   
where 
 
µ1 and µ2 denote the GMT  for the prior alphavirus vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_540571] -
naïve controls, respectively. 
The GMT s on Days 22 and 29 
will be 
compared for differences between the pre 
-
exposure groups . 
The GMTs and Geometric Mean Ratio s (GMR s) will be analyzed via lin ear model. The primary 
model is an analysis of 
co
variance (AN COVA), with 
logarithmically
-transformed titers (log 10) as 

 / EBSI -CV-317-[ADDRESS_704619] square means 
estimated from the 
AN
C
OVA 
 
and their 95% C Is will be back -transformed and reported as the group GMT values.  
The GMR comparing the pre -exposure groups will be calculated by [CONTACT_3382] 
-
transforming the 
differenc e estimated 
from a linear contrast in
 the model. The 95% CI for the GMR will be 
calculated analogously.  
The 
GMT
s and GMRs based on antibody 
titers 
measured at 
all other protocol -specified time 
points will be analyzed as described above for Day 22. 
The
 
diff
erence in persistence of the 
antibody response induced after  
first vaccination at each time p
oint will be visually  
assessed.
 
Summaries of both seroconversion and GMT  
will be 
presented 
by [CONTACT_65634].

All informed consent forms also address the subject of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination 
Act of 2008 (Pub. L. 110 -233), also known as GINA.  Participants will be advised that GINA is a 
federal law that prohibits discrimination in health insurance coverage and employment based on 
genetic information. However, GINA does not apply to employers with fewer than 15 employees. 

 / EBSI -CV-317-002 Protocol V 4.0 25 JAN 2021  CONFIDENTIAL  Page 72 of 81  GINA's protections in employment do not extend to the US military. Nor does it apply to health 
insurance through the TRICARE military health system, the Indian Health Service, the Veterans 
Health Administration, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Lastly, the  law does 
not cover long term care insurance, life insurance or disability insurance.

to vaccines.  Using new technology, information about your DNA structure (genetic information) 
gained from your samples could be used to indicate your risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_493518].  This 
genetic information is unique to you and may indicate changes in your future health status or life 
expectancy, or that of your children and other relatives.  There is growing concern that such 
information could be used by [CONTACT_540635].  
However, if we do this sort of testing, we will not share the results with you or knowingly make 
your samples available to your future employers or insurance companies.”

is maintained
. On eCRFs and  other 
documents submitted to the Sponsor and/or its designee , subjects must be identified by [CONTACT_540636]. 
 
For d ocuments that are not  for submissio n to the Sponsor and/or its designee 
(e.g., 
signed ICFs) , the Investigator must maintain these documents securely and 
in compliance with 
all 
federal laws and regulations , and ICH GCP Guideline s.  
The Investigator  will be responsible for retaining sufficient information about each subject, i .e.
, 
name, address, telephone number, Social Security number, and subject identifier i n the study, so 
that the S ponsor’s representative, the WRAIR IRB, the FDA, employees of 
[LOCATION_003]MRDC
, or other 
regulatory authorities may have access to this information should the need arise.  
It is the policy of the 
[LOCATION_003]MRDC
 that data sheets are to be completed for all subjects participating 
in research (Form 60 -R, Volunteer Registry Data Sheet). Th 
e data sheets will be entered into this 
Command’s Volunteer Registry Database. The information to be entered into this confidential data 
base includes the subject’s name, address, and Social Security Number; study title; and dates of 
participation. The int ent of this data base is twofold: first, to readily answer questions concerning 
an individual’s participation in research sponsored by 
[CONTACT_540637]
; and second, to ensure that 
[LOCATION_003]MRDC  can exercise its obligation to ensure research subjects are adequately warned  (duty to 
warn) of risks and to provide new information as it becomes available. The information will be 
stored at 
[LOCATION_003]MRDC
 for a minimum of 75 years. The Volunteer Registry Database is a separate 
entity and is not linked to the study database.

All nonexempt research involving human subjects shall, at a minimum, meet the requirement of 
32 CFR 219.116(a)(6).   Namely, the Informed Consent document will not “ include any 
exculpatory language through which the subject or the legally autho 
rized representative is made 
to waive or appear to waive any of the subject ’s legal rights, or releases or appears to release the 
investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.”  
If a subject is injured because of participation in this research, whether or not they are a DoD 
healthcare beneficiary, the subject is entitled to medical care for that injury at a military hospi[INVESTIGATOR_52581]; medical care charges for care at a military hospi[INVESTIGATOR_540572] b e waived. It cannot be 
determined in advance which military hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284313]. If the subject obtains 
care for research -related injuries outside of a military hospi[INVESTIGATOR_7708], the subject or the subject’s 
insurance will be responsible  for medical expenses.  Transportation to and from DoD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_540573], except in emergencies or situations where a non 
-
DoD healthcare 
beneficiary requires a military escort for access to said hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50276]. No reimbursement 
 
is 
available if the subject incurs medical expenses to treat research -related injuries. No compensation 
is available for research -related injuries. The subject is not waiving any legal rights. The subject 
should contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_540574] o

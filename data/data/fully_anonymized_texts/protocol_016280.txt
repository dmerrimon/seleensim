1 P ROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
Trial objectives:
This protocol  is part of a pediatric development program that fulfills differing requirements of the 
Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency ( EU PDCO) and the Food and Drug 
Administrati on of  the Uni ted States of Ameri ca (US FDA) . For the EU PDCO, to assess the 
efficacy  and safety  of tapentadol  in the treatm ent of acute pain, subjects between 2 years and less 
than 18 years old will be evaluated . For the US FDA, subjects between birth and less than 17 years 
old will be evaluated .
The clinical hypothes isof this tri al is that tapentadol  oral solution reduces the total amount of 
supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388425] 12hours (primary object ive for US FDA) or 
24hours (primary object ive for EU PDCO) following init iation of invest igational medicinal product 
(IMP), compared to placebo, in children and ado lescents who have undergone surgery  that, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would reliably  produce m oderate to severe pain requiring opio id treatment.
The primary  efficacy  objective (ei ther 12 hours or 24 hours) for [ADDRESS_487000] ive in the other, for the different age range, as described below .
Subjects can be treated for up to 72 hours, and efficacy and safet y informat ion will also be collected 
throughout this time period .
Primary objectives:
For EU PDCO: To evaluate the efficacy o f tapentadol oral so lution, based on the total amount of 
supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388425] [ADDRESS_487001] undergone surgery that, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would reliably  produce m oderate to severe pain requiring opio id treatment.
For US FDA: To eval uate the efficacy of tapentadol or al solution, based on the total amount of 
supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388425] 12hours fo llowing init iation of IMP ,in 
children and ado lescents aged fro m birth to l ess than [ADDRESS_487002] igator’s opin ion, woul d reliably produce moderate to severe pain requiring opio id 
treatm ent.
For both EU PDCO and US FDA: To eval uate the safet y of tapentadol  oral solution in children and 
adolescents aged 2 years to l ess than 18 years (EU PDCO) and children and adoles cents aged from 
birth to less than 17 years (US FDA) who have undergone surgery that, in the invest igator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, woul d reliably  produce m oderate to severe pain requiring opio id treatment .
Secondary objectives:
To assess the efficacy of tapentadol oral solution using mult iple subjective and object ive measures 
of the subject’s response to treatment (see secondary  endpoints ).DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

Definition of endpoint s:
All endpoints compare the resul ts in the group of subjects treated with tape ntadol oral so lution to 
the group treated with placebo. As applicable and appropriate for the individual endpo int, these 
endpo ints will be analyzed in the age ranges of 2 years to less than 18 years for the EU PDCO and 
from birth to less than 17 years for the US FDA.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint for the EU PDCO is considered a secondary  efficacy  endpo int for 
the US FDA and vice versa .
The primary efficacy endpoint sare:
•EU PDCO: The total amount of  supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388426] (morphine 
equivalents in mg/kg body  weight) used wi thin the first [ADDRESS_487003] IMP intake.
•US FDA: The total amount of  suppl emental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388426] (morphine 
equivalents in mg/kg body  weight) used wi thin the first [ADDRESS_487004] IMP intake.
The secondary efficacy endpoints are: 
•The total amount of supplemental opio id analgesic medicat ion (morphine equivalents in 
mg/kg body  weight) used wi thin the first 12 hours (EU PDCO) or within the first 24 hours 
(US FDA) after first IMP intake.
•The tota l amount of  supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388427], assessed in 
12hour intervals from [ADDRESS_487005] dose of IMP.
•Palatabili ty and acceptabilit y of the IMP after the first and last doses of IMP in subjects 
aged 2 years to less than 18 years ol d (EU PDCO).
•Changes fro m baseline in pain intensit y over the Treatm ent Peri odusing age -appropri ate 
pain scales ( Face, Legs, Act ivity, Cry, Consol ability [FLACC] scale for ages birth to less 
than 6 years or in older children who are n ot abl e to report their pain using the other scales, 
Faces Pain Scale –Revised [FPS -R] for ages 6 years to less than 12 years, and visual analog 
scale [VAS] for ages 12 years to less than 18 years ).

Trial treatments :
The subject will undergo a scheduled surgery. This surgery  is not part of the trial, but would be 
perform ed as per standard of care. Subjects may start enrollment before or after surgery .
At som e time a fter the surgery , the subject m ust have been started o n NCA/PCA wit h morphine or 
hydro morphone , with or wi thout a background infusion, according to the standard of care. The
background infusio n (if any ) must be with a low dose infusio n of the same opio id as that used for 
the NCA/PCA, i.e., morphine or hy drom orphone .
When the subject is able to tolerate liquids, meets the inclusio n criteria, and does not meet any 
exclusio n criterion, the subject will be a llocated /randomizedto IMP (tapentadol oral solut ion or 
placebo) using a n interactive voice/web response sys tem (IVRS/IWRS). Doses of IMP will be given 
at intervals explained below.
The first dose of IMP is given when IMP is available on the ward and the invest igator determines it 
is medically appropriate for the subject to receive the IMP .
At the time of the first IMP administration, the background opio id infusio n (if any ) will  be 
discontinued.
After the first dose of IMP (see table below), NCA/PCA will be cont inued with the same opio id as 
used previously (i.e., morphine or hy drom orphone, defined as supplement al opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269]) ,
according to invest igator judgment and standard of care. 
Subjects m ust be carefully  observed, especially  during the first hour after the init iation of IMP .
Dosing wit h IMP will be stopped if:
•A switch to exclusively  oral opi[INVESTIGATOR_388430] m edicati on is indicated according to the local 
standard of care.
•Opi[INVESTIGATOR_388431]. 
•IMP has been administered for 72hours.
Investigational medicinal products
The 2 IMPsare:
•Tapentadol 4mg/mL oral solution and tapentad ol20mg/mL oral  solution.

• A ge 30 days to l ess than 6 months:0.3mg/kg .
• Age birth to less than 30 days old: 0.075 mg/kg .
Stratification
Allocat ion/rando mizat ion to IMP will be stratified by 7 age groups (bi rth to <30 days, 30 days to 
<6months, 6 months to <2 years, 2 years to <6 years, 6 years to <12 years, 12 years to <17 years, 
17years to <18 years) and by [CONTACT_388615].
Concomitant medication s/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] :
Allow ed prior and concomitant medications
Unless explici tly prohibited, all pri or and concomit ant medicat ions are allowed.
Benzodi azepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] m ay be used to treat muscle spasms or anxiet y, consistent wi th local standard of 
care. They shoul d be used wi th caut ion as theymay potentiate central nervous system depressio n
that may  occur wi th tapentadol  or other opi [INVESTIGATOR_2438].
Medicat ionsfor the treatm ent of adverse events are allowed according to the investigator’s 
judgment and post -operative s tandard of care . For example, clinically relevant respi[INVESTIGATOR_388432] n maybe treated with naloxone , and nausea/vo miting can be treated with ant iemetics, 
which may also be given prophylact ically according to the standard of care.
If the NCA/PCA intraveno us line fails for any reason, it should be restarted/repaired immediately. 
During the interim, morphine or hy drom orphone may be administered intravenously.
In exceptional cases, if a subject has unbearable pain despi[INVESTIGATOR_388433]/PCA, an addit ional bolus 
(defined as a clinician bo lus) of m orphine or hy drom orphone m ay be administered. The clinician 
bolus can be given eit her using the NCA/PCA pump system or by  [CONTACT_388616].

Trial duration :
Each subject is expected to be in the trial for up to about 42days (up to 28 days for enrollment , and 
a treatment and fo llow-up period of  up to 14 days).
Dosing o f IMP will be for up to 72hours.
Sample size rationale :
The sample size determinat ion was based on the primary  efficacy endpoint vari able for the 
respective Full Analysis Sets. Alinear relat ionship is assumed between the [ADDRESS_487013]- surgical 
pediatric subjects where supplemental opio id was measured. A value o f 0.20 mg/kg in 24 hours 
(0.10 mg/kg in 12 hours) for the between -treatm ent group difference and a more conservat ive value 
of 0.42 mg/kg in 24 hours (0.21 mg/kg in 12 hours) for the standard deviation were considered 
adequate assumpt ions.Assuming α =0.05 (two- sided), 80% power ( β =0.2), and a randomizat ion 
ratio of 2:1 (tapentadol  to pl acebo) resul ts in a sampl e size of [ADDRESS_487014] s will be treated with IMP in this trial.
Completion of trial enrollment
The tri al enrollment for the EU PDCO set (see Section 14.2.1 for the defin ition of the analysis 
popul ations) will co mplete when the fo llowing cri terionismet:
•At least 159 treated subjects in the age range 2 years to less than 18 years of age (EU 
PDCO).
The tri al enrollment for the US FDA s et will co mplete when the fo llowing 2criteria are m et:
•At least 159 treated subjects in the age range birth to less than 17 years o f age (US FDA).
• [ADDRESS_487015]

approximately  5% of  subjects ( approximately 8subjects) m ay discontinue prior to 
receiving [ADDRESS_487016] according to the protocol for the EU PDCO set ( last subject out -EU

•Time fro m the first dose of IMP to treatment discont inuat ion due to lack of efficacy.
Statistical methods :
The primary  efficacy  analysis will be based on the respective Full Analysis Set. The primary null 
hypothesis to be tested for the trial is that the tapentadol group is not different fro m the placebo 
group forthe primary efficacy endpo int. The alternative hypothesis is that the tapentadol group is 
different fro m the placebo group forthe primary efficacy endpo int. For the primary efficacy 
endpo int, descript ive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_388619] o f variance m odel (ANOVA), which includes treatment, b aseline age 
group, and the supplemental opio id analgesic used (morphine versus hydromorphone) as factors . 
Treatment effects will be est imated based on least -squares means of the difference. The 95% 
confidence intervals and p -value will be presented for tapentadol co mpared with placebo. The test 
for the primary  efficacy analysis will be 2 -sided at a 0.05 l evel of significance. Summary  statistics 
for the primary  efficacy endpoin t will  be provi ded by  [CONTACT_551] (bi rth to <30 days, 30 days to 
<6months, 6 months to <2 years, 2 years to <6 years, 6 years to <12 years, 12years to <17 years, 
and 17 years to <18 years, as applicable for the EU PDCO set and US FDA set ) and by  [CONTACT_388620][INVESTIGATOR_388441] (NCA vs. PCA) among other subgroup analyses.
Each secondary endpo int will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. There will be no 
multiplicit y adjust ments for any  of the secondary  endpoints.
Adverse events wil l be coded using the most current versio n of the Medical Dict ionary for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) used by [CONTACT_456]. For each adverse event, the percentage of 
subjects who experienced at least 1 occurrence of the given event will be summarized by  [CONTACT_103466]. The incidence, ty pe, intensi ty, onset, rel ationship, treatment, and outcome of TEAEs will be

Non-clinical pharmacology
In various animal models o f acute, chroni c, inflammatory , and neuropathic pain, tapentadol exerted 
potent antinocicept ive effects. This broad antinociceptive profile reflects its combined mode of 
action(mu-opi[INVESTIGATOR_388454]) . Both opio id and 
non-opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d properti es are rel evant for the m anagement of clinical pain. 
Effects in humans
Tapentadol has been given to adults as an oral so lution, intr avenous solut ion, immediate -release 
(IR) tabl ets or capsul es, and as prol onged -release (PR) tablets (including a tamper resistant 
formulation [TRF]). To date, tapentadol has been administered to children aged 2years to less than 
18years in the pediatric clinical program . The oral solut ion has been given to these children as a 
single dose in 2pharmacokinet ic trial s(KF5503/68 and KF5503/59) .
Pharmacodynamics in adults
Tapentadol showed dose -dependent effects in a model for mu -opi[INVESTIGATOR_388455] (pupil 
diameter) and in an experimental pain model (pain somatosensory  evoked potenti als fo llowing CO 2
[carbon dioxide] laser stimulat ion) in doses ranging fro m tapentadol IR [ADDRESS_487064] with 
tapentadol IR 43 mgwas l ess pronounced than wit h morphine IR 30 mg.
Pharmacokinetics in adults
Tapentadol was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_388456]. Mean 
absolute bioavailabilit y after single -dose administration (fast ing) was approximately 32%, m ost 
probably  due to an extensive first -pass metabo lism. Peak serum concentrations of tapentadol were 
observed at approximately 1.25 hours (tapentadol IR) and approximately  3 hour s to 6 hours
(tapentadol PR or tapentadol TRF) post -dose. The tapentadol terminal half -life was approximately 
4 hour s (tapentadol IR) and approximately 5 hour s to 6 hours (tapentadol PR). The serum  protein 
binding of tapentadol was approximately 20%.
After oral  administrati on, approximately  70% (comprising 55% as a glucuronide and 15% as a 
sulfate of tapentadol) of the dose is excreted in urine in the conjugated form. A total of 3% of the 
drug was excreted in urine as unchanged drug.
In humans, tapenta dol is mainly metabo lized via phase 2conjugation, and only a small amount is 
metabo lized via phase [ADDRESS_487065] ivity. As 
glucuronidat ion is a high capacit y/low affini ty system , clinically relevant in teracti ons at the l evel of 
phase 2 metabo lism are unlikely. Since in -vitro investi gations showed that tapentadol does not 
inhibit or induce cytochro me P450 enzymes, clinically relevant interactions mediated by [CONTACT_388636] e P450 system  are al so consi dered unlikely.
After intravenous administration, tapentadol was widely distributed throughout the body wit h a 
volume of distribut ion (V z) of 540 L. The terminal half- life was approximately 4.1hours and total 
clearance was 1530 ± 177 mL/min. Systemic exposure to tapentadol (area under the concentration -
time curve; AUC) and accumulation factors fo llowing m ultiple dosing were found to be consistent DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

Confid entialProtocol  KF5503 /[ADDRESS_487066] 
administration.
Systemic exposure (maximum concentration of analy te [C max] and AUC) to tapentadol showed 
dose-proporti onal increases over the therapeutic dose range. The accumulat ion rati o of tapentadol  
based on the maximum serum concentrations at steady -state (C max,ss) was consistent with linear 
pharmacokinet ics and close to the theoreti cally  expected val ue. 
The pharmacokinet ics of an oral  solution w assimilar to those of the immediate -release tablet 
formulation.
After oral  dosing, AUC and C maxof tapentadol  were higher in subjects with mild and moderate 
hepat ic impairment compared to healthy subjects. The rate of format ion of tapentadol -O-
glucuronide decreased wit h increasing liver impairment.
After oral  dosing, AUC and C maxof tapentadol  were com parable in subjects with varying degrees of 
renal funct ion (from normal to severely impaired funct ion). In contrast, increasing exposure (i.e., 
AUC) to tapentadol -O-glucuroni de was observed wi th increasing degrees of renal impairment.
In drug- drug i nteracti on tri als studying the possible influence of paracetamo l, naproxen, 
acetylsalicylic acid, and probenecid on tapentadol glucuronidat ion, there were n o clinically relevant 
effects on tapentadol serum concentrations. Also, there were no clinically relevant effects on the 
absorpti on of  tapentadol  in interact ion trials of tapentadol wit h metoclopramide and om eprazo le.
Pharmacokinetics in children
A population pharmacokinet ic model was devel oped by  [CONTACT_388637] -linear mixed effect 
approach using the data available fro m 2single- dose pharmacokinet ic trials in children aged 2 years 
to less than 18 years (KF5503/68 and KF5503/59). A 1 compartm ent m odel was found to describe 
the data adequately. The pharmacokinet ic parameters of the allo metrically scaled base model were 
as follows: CL/F = 172 L.h-1, V/F = 677 L (the CL/F and V/F are ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_388457] a subject 
with a body  weight of 45 kg), first order absorption rate constant (Ka) =2.01 h-1, time delay 
between drug administration and beginning of absorption (T LAG) =0.247h. The modeled 
pharmacokinet ic parameters in children aged 2 years to less than 18 years old are in line with the 
corresponding modeled pharmacokinet ic parameters in adults. The coefficients of weight on CL/F 
and V/F were est imated to be 0.635 and 0.853, respectively. The inter -individual variabilit ies on 
CL/F, V/F, and Ka were 22.4%, 17.3%, and 145.3%, respectively.
The addit ion of data fro m KF5503/72, i.e., adding data from children aged birth to less than 2 years ,
resul ted in minor changes to the m odel (comprising children fro m birth to 18 years ol d) and was 
best described by [CONTACT_388638] E maxtype m aturati on function. The pharmaco metric 
param eters changed to: CL/F = 155L.h-1, V/F = 533L (the CL/F and V/F are ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_388458] a
subject with a body  weight of 3 2.6kg), Ka = 2.44 h-1, TLAG=0.267 h, with the coefficients of 
weight on CL/F and V/F being est imated as 0.5 62and 0.827, respectively . The maturati on function, 
which describes the age at which half the maximum CL/F in the data set was estimated as 39weeks. 
The inter -individual variabilit ies on CL/F , V/F, and Ka remained virtually the same .
Safety in Phase I trials in adults (tapentadol intravenous, tapentadol oral solution, 
tapentadol IR, and tapentadol PR including TRF)
As studied in single -and mult iple-dose Phase I trials, tapentadol IR (single -dose: 200mgand 
multiple-dose: 175mgorally every  6hours) and tapentadol PR (single -dose: 300mgand DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

adverse event profile was consistent with that of centrally -acting analgesics. The most frequent 
TEAEs were dizziness, headache, so mnolence, nausea, fatigue, vomit ing, and dry  mouth. Most 
TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensit y. Overall , there were no clinically relevant treatment -
related or dose -related effects on laboratory parameters, vital signs, or ECG parameters. 
No effects o n the QT interval and other ECG parameters were sho wn after mult iple therapeutic 
(100 mg) and supra -therapeut ic (150 mg) doses of tapentadol IR in a thorough QT trial. Similarly, 
tapentadol had no relevant effect on heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, and T -wave or U -wave 
morphol ogy. In a second thoroug h QT trial, mult iple oral administration of 86 mgor 172 mg

A dedicated abuse liabilit y trial conducted in non -dependent healthy recreational users of opio ids 
showed a similar abuse liabilit y pro file to that of hydro morphone at estimated equianalgesic doses.
Safety resul ts from trials in which tapentadol was given as an oral solut ion or intravenously were 
generally consistent with those observed with tapentadol IR wi th the except ion of a stronger 
influence on the respi[INVESTIGATOR_388459].
Safety in Phase II trials in children (tapentadol oral solution)
In a single dose trial (KF5503/68) of 66children under going dental , ear, nose, or throat surgery , 
there were no deaths . There was 1 serious adverse event (post -operative bleeding 6days after a

considered a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3418]) .In a second trial (KF5503/59 [R33133PAI2005]) of similar design ,
but which included a greater variety  of surgi cal procedures ,in 45children, there were no deaths, 
serious adverse events, or discontinuations due to an adverse event.

1623 cases). Ove rall, the m ost frequent ly reported preferred terms for these events were (in 
descending order of frequency) nausea, drug ineffective, dizziness, somnolence, vomi ting, and 
headache.
Two important potential risks (serotonin syndro me with concomi tant use of s erotonergi c 
medicat ions, and suicidal ideat ion and behavi or) were included in the reference safet y information 
and the ri sk management pl an of tapentadol . Current ly, neither clinical nor post -authorizat ion safety  
data provide sufficient evidence to include these potenti al risks as adverse drug reactions of 
tapentadol.
Efficacy of tapentadol IR
The efficacy of tapentadol IR was shown in all Phase III tri als, encom passing several different pain 
models,including a visceral pain model, for all doses emplo yed i n the tri als, i .e., 50 mg, 75mg, and 
100mgtaken every  4hours to 6 hours. These trials examined subjects with moderate to severe pain 
following abdo minal hysterectomy , buni onectomy , hip replacement ( the treatm ent durati on was
3days for all 3 indication s), and in subjects with pain due to end- stage degenerative jo int disease 
(10days of treatment in an outpatient populat ion). 
Tapentadol IR showed a rapid onset of action (ranging fro m 24minute s to 46 minute s) that was at 
least as fast as the onset obser ved for the active comparators oxycodone IR and morphine IR.
The efficacy of tapentadol IR in the dose range of [ADDRESS_487070] ive comparator appeared similar to that of oxy codone IR in the dose range of 
10mgto 15 mgevery 4 hours to 6 hours in trials of pain fo llowing buni onectomy  (3trials), hip 
replacement (1 trial), and end -stage degenerat ive joint disease (1 trial). Tapentadol IR 75 mgand 
morphine IR 20 mghad similar efficacy in the trial of pain fo llowing abdo minal hysterectomy 
(1trial).
Efficacy of tapentadol PR
Efficacy of tapentadol PR (100 mgto 250 mgtwice daily ) for the treatm ent of m oderate to severe 
chronic pain was demonstrated in 3 representative pain condit ions: 2trials in chroni c painful

7 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
This protocol is part of a pediatric development program that fulfills differing requirements of the 
EU PDCO and the US FDA . For the EU PDCO, to assess the efficacy  and safet y of tapentadol  in 
the treatment of acute pain, subjects between 2 years and less than 18 years o ld will be evaluated. 
For the US FDA, subjects between birth and less than 17 years ol d will be evaluated.
The clinical hypothesis of this tri al is that tapentadol  oral solution reduces the total amount of 
supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388425] 12hours (primary object ive for US FDA) or 
24hours (primary object ive for EU PDCO) following ini tiation of IMP, compared to placebo, in 
children and ado lescents who have undergone surgery  that, in the invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, woul d

set.
Subjects can be treated for up to 72 hours, and efficacy and safet y informat ion will also be collected 
throughout this time period.
Primary objectives:
For EU PDCO: To evaluate the efficacy o f tapentadol oral so lution, based on the total amount of 
supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388425] [ADDRESS_487072] under gone surgery  that, in the 
investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would reliably  produce m oderate to severe pain requiring opio id treatment.
For US FDA: To evaluate the efficacy of tapentadol oral so lution, based on the total amount of 
supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388460] [ADDRESS_487073] igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, woul d reliably produce moderate to severe pain requiring opio id 
treatm ent.
For both EU PDCO and US FDA: To evaluate the safet y of tapentadol  oral solution in children and 
adolescents aged 2 years to l ess than 18 years (EU PDCO) and children and adolescents aged from 
birth to less than 17 years (US FDA) who have undergone surger y that, in the invest igator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, woul d reliably  produce m oderate to severe pain requiring opio id treatment.
Secondary objectives:
To assess the efficacy of tapentadol oral so lution using mult iple subjective and object ive measures 
of the subjec t’s res ponse to treatm ent (see secondary  endpo ints, Secti on8.1).DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

a treatment and fo llow-up peri od of  up to 14 days). Dosing of IMP will be for up to 72hours.
8.1 Definition of endpoint s
All endpoints compare the results in the group of subjects treated with tapentadol oral so lution to 
the group treated with plac ebo. As applicable and appropriate for the individual endpo int, these
endpo ints will be analyzed in the age ranges of 2 years to less than 18 years for the EU PDCO and 
from birth to less than 17 years for the US FDA.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint for the E U PDCO is considered a secondary efficacy endpo int for 
the US FDA and vice versa.
The primary efficacy endpoints are:
•EU PDCO: The total amount of supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_388426] (morphine 
equivalents in mg/kg body  weight) used wi thin the first [ADDRESS_487075] IMP intake.
•US FDA: The total amount of supplemental opio id analgesic medicat ion (morphine 
equivalents in mg/kg body  weight) used wi thin the first [ADDRESS_487076] IMP intake.
The secondary efficacy endpoints are: 
• The total amount o f supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388426] (morphine equivalents in 
mg/kg body  weight) used wi thin the first 12 hours (EU PDCO) or within the first 24 hours 
(US FDA) after first IMP intake.
•The total amount of supplemental opio id analgesic medicat ion received, assessed in 
12hour intervals from 24hours to96hours after the first dose of IMP.
•Palatabili ty and acceptabilit y of the IMP after the first and last doses of IMP in subjects 
aged 2years to less than 18 years ol d (EU PDCO).
•Changes fro m baseline in pain intensit y over the Treatm ent Peri od using age-appropri ate 
pain scales (FLACC scale for ages birth to less than 6 years or in older children who are not 
able to report their pain usin g the other scales, FPS -R for ages 6 years to less than 12 years, 
and VAS f or ages 12 years to less than 18 years). 
•CGIC by  [CONTACT_53953]/clinician after complet ion of double -blind IMP treatment.
•PGIC by  [CONTACT_1130]/parent/l egal guardian after completion of do uble-blind IMP treatment.

Based on the known efficacy of tapentadol in adult s, it is assumed that this efficacy will also be 
present in children and adolescents . Thus,it is expected that subjects treated with tapentadol will 
requi re less supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_388461](given via NCA/PCA) for addit ional pain
control thanchildren in the placebo group who ,because they should not experience more pain than
they woul d if not enrolled in a clinical trial, are expected to require more suppl emental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_172664] .Overall, there shoul d be no difference in the intensit y of pain measured between the 
2treatm ent groups. Hence, t he opio id sparing effect (i.e., lower expected use of supplemental 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_388462] -treated group ) can be 
considered a surrogate for more direct measures of analgesia, such as changes in pain intensity . The 
use of NCA/PCA will allow subjects on placebo to receive analgesia .DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

See Secti on14.1 for the sample size rationale.
Comparator and use of NCA/PCA
In thi s double -blind trial, the efficacy  of tapentadol oral so lution,compared to pl acebo ,will be 
evaluated based on the amount of supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388465] .All subjects will receive supplemental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_11595] m edicati on(via 
NCA/PCA) for additional pain control during the period of administration of IMP . Morphine or 
hydro morphone (via NCA/PCA) areallowed as supplemental opio id analg esic m edicati on. Both are 
frequently used in the clinical setting chosen for this trial , i.e., post -operative pain . Hence, d ue to 
the use of NCA/PCA as per usual  routine, children shoul dnot be subjected to more pain than they  
woul d otherwise experi ence in the selected post -operative setting. 
Thistrial will com pare the amount of supplemental opio id analgesic medicat ion given by

the clearance of morphine and paracetamo l, both of which undergo gl ucuronidat ion, is expected to 
be near the level o f adults by [CONTACT_14898] 3 years (Anderson and Holford 2009). Thus, it is not 
expected that there will be major differences in the pharmacokinetic profile o f tapentadol in 
children aged above [ADDRESS_487080] exclusively (99% ) via the ki dneys. A total  of 3% 
of the drug i s excreted in urine as unchanged drug. Renal funct ion has been predicted to reach 90% 
of adul t function between the a ges of 1 yearand 2 years (Rhodin et al . 2009, Hay ton 2002). 
Data from a mult iple dose trial in healt hy adult subjects (HP5503/13) using tapentadol film coated 
tablets indicated that the pharmacokinet ics of tapentadol at steady -state can be predicted fro msingle 
dose pharmacokinet ics. An accumulat ion factor for AUC in the range of 1.4 to 1.7 was observed 
which agreed well wit h the theoretical rat io of approximately  1.7 based on the dosing interval and 
terminal half -life. This provides evidence for time -independent pharmacokinet ics for tapentadol . By 
[CONTACT_388640], it is expected that the pharmacokinet ics of tapentadol in children will be 
predi ctable and time independent after both single and mult iple dosing.
Non-linear mixed effects modeling was perform ed to devel op a popul ation pharmacokinet ic model 
in the pediatric populat ion for tapentadol oral so lution. The data from 2dedicated single -dose 
pharmacokinet ic trials (KF5503/68 and KF5503/59 [R33133 PAI2005] ) were used for the 
popul ation pharmacokinet ic model and served as a basis for dose select ion in the current trial for 
children aged 2years to less than 18 years old .The doses for children aged from birth to less than 
2years arepredi cted from additional pharm acokineti c sampling in children of the s ame age group.
Simulations were performed to ident ify tapentadol doses that would produce total exposures (i.e., 
serum  AUC for tapentadol ) in pediatri c subjects that are similar to those reported in adults. The 
approved adult therapeutic dose range that is generally associated with efficacy  and good 
tolerabilit y in adult s, 50 mg to 100 mg, was used for comparison. These simulat ionsshowed that
tapentadol doses of 1.25 mg/kg every 4 hours in subjects aged 2 years to less than 18 years old are 
expected to pro duce exposures similar to those after administration of 50 mgto100mg every 
4hours, given as an immediate -release formulat ion in adults. The median steady  state simulated 
AUC safter a 50mg, 75 mg,and 100 mg dose in adults are 217 ng.h/m L, 325 ng.h/m L,and 
433ng.h/m L, respect ively. Incompar ison, the m edian simulated steady  state AUC in subjects aged 
2years to 17 years old receiving 1.25 mg/k g is 3 06ng.h/mL.
The populat ion pharmacokinetic model used for the pediatric dose simulat ions was updated wit h 
exposure data obtained fro m children aged birth to less than 2 years (KF5503/72), the simulat ions 
were then redone to determine the appropriate dose for the age group 6months to less than 2 years. 
The simulat ions specified that the dose of 1.25 mg/kg wo uld give similar exposures as that 
observed in the age group 2 years to less than 18 years .For the y ounger groups ,a lower dose is

Based on these results, adose regimen o f 1.25 mg/kg will be used f or the fi rst 24 hours of t reatment 
in this trialin children aged 6months to less than 18 years old . After 24 hours after the start of IMP, 
and based on clinical judgment, the dose may eit her be continued at 1.25 mg/kg or it maybe
decreased to 1.0mg/kg. A decisio n to m aintain or alter the dose will depend on the invest igator’s 
judgment of the effect iveness of the anal gesia and the adverse event profile observed in each child 
over the first 24 hour dosing period. For children aged 1 month to l ess than 6 months, and birth to 
less than 1 month old,doses of 0. 5mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg , respectively, are expected to produce 
similar exposures as that observed in the age group [ADDRESS_487081] ion12.4. In addit ion, the 
investigator/delegate or subject will record a pain intensit y score pri or to each NCA/PCA activation, 
whenever possible (as requested by  [CONTACT_55257]). Pain intensit y data collected for thi s purpose, i .e., 
directly before each NCA/PCA activation, will be used only for the purpose of exploratory  
descript ive analysis.
Blood sampling
The total withdrawn bl ood vol ume in this trial is given in Sect ion11.7, and this will not exceed the 
maximum safe blood loss that is recommended in a pedi atric popul ation (e.g., EMEA ad hoc 
working party  2008) .
Safety
The safet y of tapentadol  oral solution in the studied population will be assessed by [CONTACT_388641] y parameters listed in Sect ion12.3.
8.5 Benefit/risk analysis
Benefits
Tapentadol has been shown to be effect ive for the treatm ent of m oderate to severe pain in adults 
(Secti on6.2).Data on the efficacy of tapentadol in children are preliminary and limited . Itis not 
expected that the efficacy of tapentadol in children will deviate notably from thatobserved in 
adults.
Risks
Lack of efficacy
Tapentadol may not be as efficacious in children as in adults. In addit ion, some subjects willreceive 
placebo. Theriskof lack of  efficacy wit h tapentadol, or no efficacy wit h placebo, i s mit igated as all 
subjects in this trial will have access to suppl emental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388466]/PCA.
Due to the chosen trial design, subjects are not expected to experience undue pain. 
Safety -background procedures
All subjects will undergo a surgical procedure. The surgical procedure and anesthesia have inherent 
risks. However, these surgi cal procedure sand the need for opi [INVESTIGATOR_388467].DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

Risks to subjects also include disco mfort, inconvenience, and the number and volume o f blood 
samples required by  [CONTACT_388642] .These risks will be minimized by:
•Limit ing the number of venipunctures.
•Possibly obtaining blood samples at the same time as routine blood sampling.
•Permi tting t he use of analgesic patches , cream s, etc ., to reduce pain due to venipuncture .
•Use of laboratories wit h expertise in handling, monitoring, and analyzing bio logic samples 
using small vo lumes.
•Involving trial site staff experi enced wi th treating children.
Safety - tapentadol
Apotential  risk to subj ects in this tri al is the exp osure to tapentadol , with possible side effects.
Althoug h there i s a tapentadol  oral solution available for the adult populat ion, the assessment of risk 
for the tapentadol  oral solution for use in children is mainly based on the much greater experience 
with the solid oral formulat ions tapentadol IR and tapentad olPR (and a rel ated tam per resistant 
formulation). This experience is considered to be applicable to the tapentadol oral so lution as well.
The safet y profile of tapentadol has been well characterized through a completed clinical program 
in adults and post -market ing experience is now available. Furthermore, it is not expected that the 
safet y profile of tapentadol will deviate notably  from that in adul ts based on the pharmacodynamic 
and pharmacokinet ic properties of tapentadol already  observed in KF5503/68 a nd KF5503/59 
(R33133PAI2005) .
Safety -tapentadol multiple dosing
To optimize exposure to tapentadol, a weight-adjusted treatm ent dose of tapentadol oral so lution 
was chosen (see Sect ion8.4). Mult iple oral dose administration of tapentadol  in children is not 
expected to have an addit ional inherent risk above that seen in the adult populat ion.
Safety -monitoring
To assure proper safet y surveillance, the subjects will be kept in a monitored and well controlled 
environment as generally reco mmended when opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- naïve subjects are treated with strong opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438]. 
Subjects will be mo nitored for adverse events throughout the trial, and experts in pediatric 
inves tigations will be chosen to conduct the trial. Measures will be taken to ensure that all subjects 
will be closely  supervised for anti cipated si de effects known to occur with opi[INVESTIGATOR_388468]. Subjects will be confined to the trial sit e until co mpletion of Visit3 (End of Treatment 
Visit)assessments. 
Safety -selection of sites
The chosen invest igative trial site sand the investigator swillhave experience in the care of pat ients 
following pediatri c surgery  and the trial  siteswillbe properly prepared to conduct a clinical trial. 
The tri al site staff will be trained in the use of the scales and instruments included in this trial to 
ensure that trial procedures and evaluat ions are carri ed out according to GCP ,and in accordance 
with standard m edical pract ice.

The IMP does not require preparation unless very  small vol umes woul d need to be administered, in 
which case the IMP may be suitably  diluted. This may be necessary , for example, for subjects less 
than 6months old. The invest igators will be supplied with instruction sheets for the preparation of 
the IMP . 
Volumes of 1 mL or less will be given using a 1 mL syringe wit h 0.05 mL graduat ions. Volumes of 
more than 1 mL will be given using a 5 mL syringe with 0.1 mL graduat ions.
10.2.2 Total dos ing time and dosing interval
The IMP will be administered as an oral so lution. The dosing interval is 4 hours (range 
±15minutes). The reason for any delay in dosing beyond [ADDRESS_487101] is awake.
The administration of IMP is based on the inve stigator’s judgment of the subject’s condit ion and 
sedat ion level.
The dose of IMP may be reduced after [ADDRESS_487102] igator’s judgment, as fo llows:
•Age 6 months or m ore: 1.0 mg/kg. 
•Age 30 days to less than 6 months: 0.3 mg/kg.

Subjects will cont inue using the same pain scale that they  started wi th even if they change age 
group during the trial. The pain scales will be used in the fo llowing age groups:
•FLACC –birth to less than 6 years or in older children who are not able to report their pain 
using the other scales.
•FPS-R – 6years to less than 12 years o ld.
•VAS – 12 years to less th an 18 years old.
The sites will be supplied with a manual on how to implement the pain scales.
[IP_ADDRESS] Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability scale
The FLACC scale is a measurement used to assess pain in this trial for children aged from birth to 
less than 6 years, or in subjects unable to communicate their pain (Merkel et al. 1997). The scale 
has a range of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain, calculated fro m 5criteria (relat ing to the face, 
legs, activit y, crying, and conso labilit y) that are each assigned a score of 0, 1 or 2 (see example in 
Secti on19.2). The invest igator will record the results of these measurements in the subject’s 
questionnaire b efore recording the data in the CRF. The total score will not be captured by [CONTACT_388666]. Inter -rater reliabilit y will be evaluated for the 
FLACC as part of site training.
[IP_ADDRESS] Faces Pain Scale -revised
The F PS-R will be recorded in children aged 6years (if possible) to less than 12 years(see example 
in Section 19.3).The FPS -R is a validated self -reported [ADDRESS_487138]’s 
medical file before recording the data. It will be documented if help was given by a parent/legal 
guardi an.
[IP_ADDRESS] Visual analog scale
For children aged 12 years to less than 18years, the pain intensit y will be assessed by  [CONTACT_2363]  a VAS 
(see example in Sect ion19.4). The subject will be asked to draw a single line to indi cate the current 
level of pain intensit y at the time of assessment on a [ADDRESS_487139]’s medical file before record ingthe data. It will be documented if help was given by a

All adverse event swill be documented fro m the time of enrollment (i.e., the time the informed 
consent form is signed) up to the time of the last protocol scheduled contact [CONTACT_388667], i.e., date 
of last vi sit/contact (can be a phone call, e.g., in case of withdrawal).
All adverse event s will be classified as non-TEAEs or TEAEs by [CONTACT_4209]’s designee .
Definition of adverse events
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence, i.e., any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, in a subject enrolled in a clinical 
trial.Pre-exist ing diseases or condit ions occurring before enro llment are n ot considered to be 
adverse event s unless there is an untoward change in intensit y, frequency, or qualit y after 
enrollment. Lack of efficacy p er se i s not considered to be an adverse event .
Pregnancy
A newly diagnosed pregnancy of an enro lled female subjec twill not be considered an adverse event
itself unless it is suspected that the trial treatment interacted with a contraceptive method. In this 
case, the pregnancy will be considered a TEAE. A congenital ano maly as an outcom e of this 
pregnancy wil l be considered a serious TEAE.
All newly  diagnosed pregnancies of enrolled female subject swill be reported to the sponsor’s Drug 
Safety Departm entwithin [ADDRESS_487141]- parturit ion.
All pregnant subjects will be discont inued from the trial/trial treatment.
Definition of non -treatment emergent adverse events
All adverse event s occurring after e nrollment and prior to the administration o f an IMP are defined 
as non -TEAEs. Non-TEAEs are also those adverse events occurring after start of trial treatment, but DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

•Is considered medically  important . The m edical concepts included in Section19.[ADDRESS_487142] ive hospi [INVESTIGATOR_4073] n, e.g., for pre -planned surgery, w ill not be considered a serious 
adverse event if documented at enrollment. Short -lasting (<24 hours) hospi [INVESTIGATOR_76114], e.g., for 
clinical check- ups, not m eeting any o f the other above ment ioned criteria will also not be 
considered as serious adverse event s.
Special procedures for serious adverse events
If serious adverse events occur that are not tolerable, the invest igator will decide for that su bject 
whether to stop the trial and/or treatment of the subject .The invest igator should consider whether 
discontinuat ion from the IMP or trial is needed, based on the characteristics of a parti cular serious 
adverse event , e.g., if the serious adverse even tprecludes further safe participation in the trial.
If possible, after all serious adverse events , a bl ood sam ple for the central  laboratory  quanti tation of  
systemic exposure of tapentadol  and tapentadol -O-glucuronide shoul d be drawn in close tempo ral 
relationship to the serious adverse event .
Definition of unexpected treatment emergent adverse events
Expectedness will be assessed by [CONTACT_456].
An unexpected TEAE is one where the nature or intensit y is not consistent with the information in 
the invest igator’s brochure . 
Furtherm ore, reports that add significant informat ion about the specificit y or severi ty of a known, 
already docum ented adverse react ion constitute unexpected TEAEs . For example, a TEAE more 
specific or more severe than expected would be co nsidered “unexpected”. 
Definition of adverse drug reactions
Adverse drug reactions (synonymous with drug -related adverse events) are all untoward and 
unintended responses to an IMP independent of the dose administered. DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567
GRUNENTHAL
Confid entialProtocol  KF5503/[ADDRESS_487143] qualify as adverse drug reactions. The expression “reasonable 
causal relat ionship” m eans to convey, in general, that ther e is evidence or argument to suggest a 
causal relat ionship. For gui dance on the causal relationship, see the sect ion Classificat ion of 
causat ion.
A list of ad verse drug reactions seen for the IMP is given in the current version of the invest igator’s 
brochure.
Classification of causation
The causal relationship of an adverse event to IMP will be classified using the fo llowing 
termino logy. The given cri teria for each term are for consideration and are neit her exhaust ive nor 
requi red to be fulfilled in total for the selection o f the respect ive term: 
Terms for 
classification of 
causationCriteria for the selection of causality classification terms
Conditional/ 
Unclassified:Additional data for a proper assessment are under examination. 
Unassessable/ 
Unclassifiable:The available data cannot be judged because information is insufficient or contradictory, and 
cannot be supplemented or verified. 
Not related: Data with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to IMP 
administration (i.e., there is no temporal relationship to IMP administration or proved other 
cause). 
Unlikely: Data without sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal relationship to IMP 
administration, but also with no evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., 
the tempo ral relationship to IMP administration makes a causal relationship improbable, and 
other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease(s) provide plausible explanations). 
Possible: Data with limited evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship (e.g., there is a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but the adverse event could also be 
explained by [CONTACT_388669][s] or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug 
withdrawal may be lacking or unclear). 
Probable/ likely: Data with sufficient evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship ( e.g., there is a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, the adverse event is unlikely to be 
attributed to concurrent disease(s) or other drugs or chemicals, and a clinically reasonable 
response o n withdrawal [dechallenge]).
Certain: Data with clear evidence for a causal relationship (i.e., a clinical event, including laboratory 
test ab normality , occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration, and it cannot 
be explained by [CONTACT_9153]. The response to withdrawal 
of the drug [dechallenge] should be clinically plausible. The event must be 
pharmacologically or phenomenologically definitive, using a satisfactory rechallenge 
procedure if necessary).DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

Definition of intensity 
The clinical “ intensity ” of an adverse event will be classified as:
Mild: Signs and symptoms that can be easily tolerated. Symptoms can be ignored and disappear 
when the subject is distracted.
Moderate: Symptoms cause discomfort but are tolerable; they cannot be ignore d and affect 
concentration.
Severe: Symptoms which affect usual daily activity.
For adverse event s where the intensit y changes over time, the m aximum  intensity observed during 
the who le duration of the adverse event will be docum ented.
Definition of outcome at the time of last observation
The outcome at the time of last observat ion (see Section 11.1.3 ) will be class ified as:
•Recovered/ Resolved.
•Recovered/ Resolved wi th sequelae.
•Fatal .
•Recovering/ Reso lving.
• Not recovered/Not resolved.
•Unknown (unknown should only  be used, if at the time of the last visit for a subject in a 
trial, the outcom e of the adverse event is unknown to the invest igator, e.g .,because the 
subject is lost to fo llow-up).
In the event of irreversible congenital ano malies, the cho ice “not resolved” should be used. “Fatal” 
shoul d only  be used when death is possibly related to the adverse event (note: the causal 
relationship of the IMP to the adverse event is not to be considered for this decisio n). If there is 
more than 1 adverse event , only  the adverse event leading to death (possibly related) will be 
attributed with the outcome “fatal”.
Documentation of adverse events 
The subjec ts will  be quest ioned about possible adverse event s with non-leading quest ions before 
administration of the IMP and at regular intervals thereafter as defined in Section1.2.
All adverse event s reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_388670].
All adverse event s will be documented in the CRF with the following informat ion where 
appropriate:
•Descript ion (adverse event verba tim term).
•Start date/time.
•End date/time or continuat ion.
•Whether adverse event was serious.
•Intensit y.
•Outcom e.
•Action taken with IMP.

the timing of the primary  efficacy endpoint ( EU PDCO: 24 hours, US FDA: 12 hours) that impact 
the stati stical methods and are reflected in the fo llowing sect ions.
As applicable and appropriate for the individual endpoint, the endpoints will be analyzed in the age 
ranges for the EU PDCO and for the US FDA.
Two reports will be prepared for the trial. The first report will be p repared after the last subject out

[IP_ADDRESS] Primary efficacy endpoint
The primary  efficacy  endpoint sfor the EU PDCO and US FDA arethe am ount of supplemental 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_388426] (morphine equivalents in mg/k g body  weight) used wi thin the first 
12hours and [ADDRESS_487166]’s discont inuat ion. If 
a subject used a total of Xmg/kg of supplemental opio id through Hour T ( 24hours), cumulat ive 
use over [ADDRESS_487167] imated as (X/T)*24 mg/kg. If T is <12 hours, cumulat ive use over 
12hours will be estimated as (X/T)*12. This extrapolat ion assumes a constant use(in mg/kg per 
hour) of supplemental opio id over [ADDRESS_487168] emental  opi[INVESTIGATOR_388498] m g/kg of m orphine -equivalents. 
Hydrom orphone doses will be mult iplied by 5 to obtain the morphine equivalent. 
The primary  null hypothesis to be tested for the trial is that the tapentadol group is not different 
from the placebo group forthe primary  endpoint. The alternat ive hypothesis is that the tapentadol DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

endpo int, descript ive statistics will be presented by [CONTACT_1570] ,and the endpo int will be 
analyzed using an ANOVA, which includes treatment, b aseline age group , and the supplemental  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_388499] (m orphine v ersus hydromorphone) as factors. Treatment effects will be 
estimated based on least -squares means of the difference. The 95% confidence intervals and p -value 
will be presented for tapentadol co mpared with placebo. The test for the primary efficacy analysis 
will be [ADDRESS_487170] ive Per Protocol Set and analyzed using

18.2 Protocol Amendment 02
Amendment rationale
This amendment has been enacted for clarificat ion and to comply wi th US FDA requi rements:
•Not all endpo ints will be analyzed according to the regional age ranges (2 y ears to l ess than 
18 years for the EU PDCO and fro m birth to less than 17 y ears f or the US FDA). This has 
been clarified in the text, and will be elucidated in the statist ical analysis plan. In addit ion, 
the addi tional analysis of the primary  endpoint by  [CONTACT_388693].
•Based on a request from US FDA, the fo llowing data will be co llected: when possible, the 
investigator/delegate or subject will record a pain intensit y score prior to each 
administration of NCA/PCA. Pain data collected for this purpose, i.e., direct ly before each 
administration of NCA/PCA, whenever possible, will be used only for the purpose of 
exploratory  analysis.
•The definit ion of completers has been amended.
•The address of the internat ional coordinat ing investigator was updated. The operational 
lead’s ,and sponsor’s medically qualified person and signator ieswerechanged.
•Examples of suitable surgeries have been added to the population descript ions to assist 
investigators to ident ify suitable subjects.
•Subjects who are cognit ively impaired in the investigator’s judgment such that they  cannot 
comply with the protocol  are now excluded from participat ion in the trial.
•The age range of the palatabilit y and taste questi onnaire has been extended downwards 
from 3years to 2 years as the y ounger subjects will now start recruit ment and are capable 
of performing the assessment.DMS version:  ID:  10.0 1010567

•It is no longer necessary that any background infusio n to the NCA/PCA is at a “constan t”
low dose rate.
•The dose of tapentadol oral so lution for subjects between 2 years and less than 6 years has 
now been defined. 
•Instructi ons on whether to use a [ADDRESS_487185] been added.
•It has been clarified that dosing should take place as soon as possible after a subject is 
woken if dosing has been delayed because the subject was sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007].
•The list of prohibited medication taken within 14 days of allocation/rando mizat ion to IMP 
has been extended to include all serotonergic drugs, including select ive 
serotonin/norepi[INVESTIGATOR_5608], tricyclic ant idepressants, linezo lid, triptans, 
and St. John’s Wort (hy pericum perforatum ) for safet y reasons. The time medicat ion for 
sedat ion is prohibited has been extended to 6 hours bef ore all ocati on to IMP. The use of

•The use of IMP after [ADDRESS_487186] 48 hours .
•The use of the Universit y of Michigan Sedat ion Scale has been added for assessing 
sedat ion.
•Maximum blood sampling for subjects aged less than 2 years has been defined.
•The time span for recording opio id and non -opi[INVESTIGATOR_388505].
•The l ength of t ime the oxygen saturation is below 92% was m adeconsisten t across
descript ions in the protocol. The phrasing was al so ali gned in other sections.
•The primary  endpoint will also be evaluated using Bayesian statistics as a supportive 
analysis. The methodology  will be described in the statist ical analysis plan.
•The informat ion on safet y experience from post -marketing data in adults has been updated.
In addit ion, a number of discrepancies and inconsistencies have been corrected.

Section 1: Protocol Synopsis –Trial objectives :
Section 7: Trial objectives
The clinical hypothesis of this trial is that tapentadol oral 
solution reduces the total amount of supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_388508] [ADDRESS_487189] 
(IMP), compared to placebo, in children and adolescents 
who have under gone surgery that, in the investigator’s 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n, would reliably produce moderate to severe pain 
requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_2512].
The primary efficacy objective for 1 region is considered 
a secondary efficacy objective in the other.The clinical hypothesis of this trial is that tapentadol oral 
solution reduces the total amount of supplemental opi[INVESTIGATOR_388508] 12 hours (primary 
objective for US FDA) or 24 hours (primary objective for 
EU PDCO) following initiation of investigational 
medicina l product (IMP), compared to placebo, in 
children and adolescents who have undergone surgery 
that, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would reliably 
produce moderate to severe pain requiring opi[INVESTIGATOR_74456].
The primary efficacy objective (either 12 hours or 24 
hours) for 1 region is considered as the secondary 
efficacy objective in the other, for the different age 
range, as described below .

Non-linear mixed effects modeling was performed to 
develop a population pharmacokinetic model in the 
pediatric population for tapentadol oral solution. The 
data from 2 dedicated single -dose pharmacokinetic trials 
(KF5503/68 and KF5503/59 [R33133PAI2005]) w ere 
used for the population pharmacokinetic model and 
served as a basis for dose selection in the current trial for 
children aged 6 years to less than 18 years old. The doses 
for children 2 years to less than 6 years of age are still to 
be predicted, but w ill be based on further data accruing 
from these trials. The doses for children aged from birth 
to 2 y ears will be predicted from additional 
pharmacokinetic sampling in children of the same age 
group.
Simulations were performed to identify tapentadol doses
that would produce total exposures (i.e., serum AUC for 
tapentadol) in pediatric subjects that are similar to those 
reported in adults. The approved adult therapeutic dose 
range that is generally associated with efficacy and good 
tolerability in adults, 5 0 mg to 100 mg, was used for 
comparison. These simulations showed that tapentadol 
doses of 1.25 mg/kg ever y 4 hours in subjects aged 6 
years to less than 18 years old are expected to produce 
exposures similar to those after administration of 50 mg 
to 100 m g ever y 4 hours, given as an immediate -release 
formulation in adults. The median steady state simulated 
AUCs after a 50 mg, 75 mg, and 100 mg dose in adults 
are 217 ng.h/mL, 325 ng.h/mL, and 433 ng.h/mL, 
respectively. In comparison, the median simulated st eady 
state AUC in subjects aged 6 years to 17 years old 
receiving 1.25 mg/kg is 318 ng.h/mL .
Based on these results, a dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg 
will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment in this trial 
in children aged 6 years to less than 18 years old. After 
24 hours after the start of IMP, and based on clinical 
judgment, the dose may either be continued at 
1.25 mg/kg or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A 
decision to maintain or alter the dose will depend on the Dosing

18.4 Protocol Amendment 04
Amendment rationale
This amendment has been enacted to:
•Clarify  the defini tion for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_388575].
•Allow dosing with morphine or hy drom orphone for technical reasons if an NCA/PCA dose 
cannot be given.
•Allow a clinician bo lus or intravenous bolus of morphine or hydro morphone if the subject 
had unbearable pain in except ional cases. This has been enacted to ensure that the subjects 
are not exposed to mo re pain than would normally be the case.
•Add peri -or post -operative analgesia supplied by a continuous regional technique (e.g., 
nerve block, wound infiltrat ion catheter) or subject controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_388576] 6hours p rior to time of allocat ion/rando mizat ion to IMP until 
4hours after the last administration o f IMP.
•Exclude continuous positive airway pressure or mechanical vent ilation from time of 
allocat ion/rando mizat ion to IMP until [ADDRESS_487272] administrati on of  IMP.
•Modify 2 exclusi on criteria to:
−8. Subj ect is obese in the invest igator’s judgment. Obesit y can be determined based on 
appropriate BMI charts or tables; e.g., a BMI above the 97th percent ile for children 
based on the World Healt h Organization growth charts (see Section 19.9).
−16. Peri -or post -operative analgesia supplied by a continuous regional technique (e.g., 
nerve block, wound infiltr ation catheter) or subject controlled epi[INVESTIGATOR_388577] 6 hours before allocat ion/rando mizat ion to IMP.
•Add an exclusio n criteria of:Subject requi res continuous posit ive airway pressure or 
mechanical vent ilation, at the time of allocati on to IMP.
•Allow the use of non -sponsor supplied dosing syringes. This has been enacted for logist ical 
reasons and does not affect the outcome parameters.
•Specify  that the administrati on of  IMP m ust not be repeated if the subject vomits or 
regurgitates a com plete dose. If only part of the dose is vomited or regurgitated, the 
remainder of the dose may be administered at the investigator ’s discret ion.
•Allow the pregnancy test to be done on either a urine sample or a serum sample.
•Restrict CGIC and PGIC data to a descript ive analysis in the final report.
•Only list physical examinat ion findings in the final report.
In addit ion, a number of clarificat ions have been made, and discrepancies and inconsistencies have 
been corrected.

data obtained from children aged 1 month to less than 2 
years (KF5503/72), the simulations were then redone to 
determine the appropriate dose for the age group 6 
months to less than 2 years. The simulations specified 
that the dose of 1.25 mg/kg would give similar exposures

Section 8.4: Discussion of the trial design: Dosing
... 
The population pharmacokinetic model used for the 
pediatric dose simulations was updated with exposure 
data obtained from children aged 1monthto less than 
2years (KF5503/72), the simulations were then redone 
to determine the appropriate dose for the age group 
6months to less than 2 years. The simulations specified 
that the dose of 1.25 mg/kg would give similar exposures 
as that observed in th e age group 2 years to less than 
18years.
Based on these results, a dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg 
will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment in this trial 
in children aged 6 months to less than 18 years old. After 
24hours after the start of IMP, and b ased on clinical 
judgment, the dose may either be continued at 
1.25 mg/kg or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A 
decision to maintain or alter the dose will depend on the 
investigator’s judgment of the effectiveness of the 
analgesia and the adverse event p rofile observed in each 
child over the first 24 hour dosing period . The doses for 
younger subjects aged less than 6 months will be defined 
based on forthcoming pharmacokinetic data. Younger 
subjects will not be recruited into the trial until the dose 
has b een defined for them.... 
The population pharmacokinetic model used for the 
pediatric dose simulations was updated with exposure 
data obtained from children aged birth to less than 
2years (KF5503/72), the simulations were then redone 
to determine the app ropriate dose for the age group 
6months to less than 2 years. The simulations specified 
that the dose of 1.25 mg/kg would give similar exposures 
as that observed in the age group 2 years to less than 
18years. For the younger groups ,a lower dose is 
requi red.
Based on these results, a dose regimen of 1.25 mg/kg 
will be used for the first 24 hours of treatment in this trial 
in children aged 6 months to less than 18 years old. After 
24hours after the start of IMP, and based on clinical 
judgment, the dose m ay either be continued at 
1.25 mg/kg or it may be decreased to 1.0 mg/kg. A 
decision to maintain or alter the dose will depend on the 
investigator’s judgment of the effectiveness of the 
analgesia and the adverse event profile observed in each 
child over th e first 24 hour dosing period . For children 
aged 1 month to less than 6 months, and birth to less 
than 1 month old, doses of 0. 5mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg,

as that observed in the age group 6 months to less than

Faces Pain Scale - Revised (FPS-R)
In the following instructions, say "hurt" or 'pain" whichever seems right for a particular child.
"These faces show how much something can hurt. This face (point to left-most face] shows no pain. The faces show more and more pain [point to each from left
to right] up to this one [point to right-most face] - it shows very much pain. Point to the face that shows how much you hurt [right now]."
Score the chosen face 0, Z 4, 6, 8, or 10, counting left to right, so "0" = "no pain" and "10" = "very much pain". Do not use words like "happy" and "sad". This scale is
intended to measure how children feel inside, not how their face looks.

Actual Attempt:
A potentially self-injurious act committed with at least some wish to die, as a result of act. Behavior was in part thought of as method to kill oneself. Intent
does not have to be 100%. If there is any intent/desire to die associated with the act, then it can be considered an actual suicide attempt. There does not
have to be any injury or harm. just the potential for injury or harm. If person pulls trigger while gun is in mouth but gun is broken so no injury results,
this is considered an attempt.
Inferring Intent: Even if an individual denies intent/wish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example. a highly lethal
act that is clearly not an accident so no other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head jumpi[INVESTIGATOR_24608] a high floor/story). Also, if
someone denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred.

Potential Lethality: Only Answer if Actual Lethality
Likely lethality of actual attempt if no medical damage (the following examples, while having no actual medical damage, had potential for very serious
lethality: put gun in mouth and pulled the trigger but gun fails to fire so no medical damage; laying on train tracks with oncoming train but pulled away before
run over).

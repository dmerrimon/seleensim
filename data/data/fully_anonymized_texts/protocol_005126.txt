Study Instruments
Discuss the particulars of the research instruments, questionnaires and other evaluation instruments in 
detail. Provide validation documentation and or procedures to be used to validate instruments. For well 
know and generally accepted test instruments the detail here can be brief. More detail may be required 
for a novel or new instrument. For ethnographic studies identify any study instruments to be used (i.e. 
for deception studies) and describe in detail where, when and how the study will be conducted and who 
or what are the subjects of study. Note: For more information on how to conduct ethical and valid 
ethnographic research, follow the link For oral histories or interviews provide the general framework 
for questioning and means of data collection. If interviews or groups settings are to be audio taped or 
video taped describe in detail the conditions under which it will take place. Include a copy of any novel 
or new test instruments with the IRB submission. 
This protocol is for two "mega-studies", in which we will simultaneously test numerous behavioral 
science strategies to increase ¯u vaccination rates among Penn Medicine and Geisinger Health primary 
care patients (Trial A) and Walmart pharmacy customers (Trial B).  Our key dependent variable for both 
trials is whether participants receive a ¯u shot. For Trial A, Penn Medicine and Geisinger patients with 
routine (i.e., non-sick) primary care appointments during the Fall 2020 ¯u season will be randomly 
assigned to a treatment condition. Patients will be excluded if they: have opted out of text message 
appointment reminders, have a documented allergy or adverse event to the ¯u shot, or have already 
received their 2020 ¯u shot (documented in their medical record). Intervention content will be delivered 
via text message to participants from Penn Medicine and Geisinger Health up to four days prior to their 
scheduled primary care appointments. For Trial B, Walmart pharmacy customers will be included if 
Page [ADDRESS_1077445] received a ¯u shot from 
Walmart in the past. Intervention content will be delivered via text message to Walmart pharmacy 
customers at the start of the ¯u season. Between Trial A and Trial B, we plan to include at least 40 
different experimental conditions designed by [CONTACT_783582]®c Team 
(including researchers at Penn and other institutions), by [CONTACT_783583], and by [CONTACT_783584]. Interventions may vary the content and timing of text messages (including whether 
messages are interactive or provide links to surveys and videos). Interventions may also include 
incentives for behaviors of interest (e.g., receiving the ¯u shot or completing a survey), the details of 
which would be described in the text messages themselves. Details of each experimental condition have 
been included as a separate attachment as a modi®cation to this protocol. Text messages may include 
®rst name, appointment date and time, provider name, and practice/pharmacy locations. This is in line 
with the standard appointment reminders that Penn Medicine patients receive, which includes ®rst 
name, appointment date and time, and department information. Speci®cally, the Penn Medicine 
reminders say "PENNMED: (First Name) has an appt (APPT Date /Time )@(SMS Department 
Abbreviation). To con®rm txt YES. To decline txt NO. Txt Help 4help."  Any additional information 
that we include in text messages to participants beyond that does not include HIPAA information. All 
messages will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_783585].
Group Modi®cations
Describe necessary changes that will or have been made to the study instruments for different groups.
The content and timing of text messages and incentives will vary according to which intervention 
participants are assigned. Speci®c messages and incentive information has been added as a 
modi®cation.
Method for Assigning Subjects to Groups
Describe how subjects will be randomized to groups.
In Trial A, patients will be randomly assigned to experimental conditions using strati®cation that 
accounts for demographics (e.g., age), and recruitment site. Trial B will also randomly assign 
participants to experimental conditions, and may also use strati®cation that accounts for demographics 
(e.g., age).
Administration of Surveys and/or Process
Describe the approximate time and frequency for administering surveys and/or evaluations. For surveys, 
questionnaires and evaluations presented to groups and in settings such as high schools, focus group 
sessions or community treatment centers explain how the process will be administered and who will 
oversee the process. For instance, discuss the potential issues of having teachers and other school 
personnel administer instruments to minors who are students especially if the content is sensitive in 
nature. Describe the procedure for audio and videotapi[INVESTIGATOR_405567]/or focus groups and 
the storage of the tapes. For instance, if audio tape recording is to be used in a classroom setting, 
describe how this will be managed if individuals in the class are not participating in the study. Explain 
if the research involves the review of records (including public databases or registries) with identi®able 
private information. If so, describe the type of information gathered from the records and if identi®ers 
will be collected and retained with the data after it is retrieved. Describe the kinds of identi®ers to be 
obtained, (i.e. names, social security numbers) and how long the identi®ers will be retained and 
justi®cation for use. 
For Trial A, Penn Medicine and Geisinger Health patients with scheduled primary care appointments 
during the Fall 2020 ¯u season who receive SMS reminders about their appointments from their health 
system will be randomly assigned to receive one of our study©s SMS interventions.Text messages will 
be sent up to four days prior to patients scheduled primary care appointments. These messages will be 
sent via Penn Medicine©s WayToHealth Platform. All messages (including participants© responses to 
messages) will be stored on the HIPAA-compliant WayToHealth platform. Patient phone numbers from 
their Penn Medicine and Geisinger records will be shared with WayToHealth to deliver the text 
messages. Some messages will be personalized based on patient information (e.g., ®rst name) and Penn 
Medicine/Geisinger appointment information (e.g., practice name), All identi®able patient information 
will be removed from the dataset that is shared with researchers for analysis. For Trial B, Walmart 
pharmacy customers who have consented to receive SMS messages about their prescriptions and have 
received a ¯u shot from Walmart in the past will receive messages at the start of the ¯u season. 
Messages may be personalized based on customer information (e.g., ®rst name) and/or Walmart 
pharmacy information (e.g., pharmacy location). These messages will be sent via Walmart pharmacy©s 
text messaging platform. All identi®able customer information will be removed from the dataset that is 
Page 9 of 20shared with researchers for analysis.
Data Management
Describe how and who manages con®dential data, including how and where it will be stored and 
analyzed. For instance, describe if paper or electronic report forms will be used, how corrections to the 
report form will be made, how data will be entered into any database, and the person(s) responsible for 
creating and maintaining the research database. Describe the use of pseudonyms, code numbers and 
how listing of such identi®ers will be kept separate from the research data. 
For Trial A, intervention content will be delivered to participants via text messages from the 
WayToHealth platform. Penn Medicine and Geisinger will provide the patient data and appointment 
data needed for WayToHealth to deliver the interventions. This may include a unique identi®er, medical 
record number, ®rst and last name, address, appointment date, appointment time, appointment type, 
practice and physician information, patient town and zip code, date of birth, gender, phone number(s), 
documented allergy to the ¯u shot, and documentation of ¯u shot receipt for the 2020 ¯u season. Penn 
Medicine and Geisinger will also indicate which phone numbers have opted out of receiving text 
message reminders. WayToHealth will receive these data from Penn Medicine via a secure data feed 
and from Geisinger via a secure upload. There will be data use agreements in place governing the data 
sharing with WayToHealth and Wharton as required.  The Penn Medicine Academic Computing 
Services (PMACS) will be the hub for the hardware and database infrastructure that will support the 
project and is where the WayToHealth web portal is based. The PMACS is a joint effort of the 
University of Pennsylvania©s Abramson Cancer Center, the Cardiovascular Institute, the Department of 
Pathology, and the Leonard Davis Institute. The PMACS provides a secure computing environment for 
a large volume of highly sensitive data, including clinical, genetic, socioeconomic, and ®nancial 
information. Among the IT projects currently managed by [CONTACT_105473]: (1) the capture and organization 
of complex, longitudinal clinical data via web and clinical applications portals from cancer patients 
enrolled in clinical trials; (2) the integration of genetic array databases and clinical data obtained from 
patients with cardiovascular disease; (3) computational biology and cytometry database management 
and analyses; (4) economic and health policy research using Medicare claims from over 40 million 
Medicare bene®ciaries. PMACS requires all users of data or applications on PMACS servers to 
complete a PMACS-hosted cybersecurity awareness course annually, which stresses federal data 
security policies under data use agreements with the university. After the end of the intervention, patient 
and intervention data will be transferred from WayToHealth, Penn Medicine, and Geisinger to the 
Leonard Davis Institute©s Health Services Research Data Center (HSRDC), which is maintained at a 
high security level in accordance with federal regulations (e.g., HIPAA) governing secure computer 
systems. This will include all data used for study implementation (i.e., the full list included above), as 
well as additional data to be used in analysis. The additional data may include patient diagnosis, 
procedures, and prescription information from the previous [ADDRESS_1077446] children, race/ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity score, insurance type, a record of previous ¯u 
vaccinations from the previous [ADDRESS_1077447] for the ¯u, and primary care physician 
(PCP) specialty. Storage and analysis protocols for the data on the LDI HSRDC will be included in the 
data use agreement with Geisinger and Walmart. All identi®able data will be removed from this list as 
soon as possible, and will not be used for analysis.  The Geisinger investigators will have access to data 
on (1) any intervention(s) they design, and (2) intervention data for Geisinger patients across all 
interventions for the purpose of running internal analyses through the HSRDC. They will handle all 
data in accordance with Geisinger and IRB policies. For Trial B, Walmart pharmacy will deliver the 
interventions directly to eligible Walmart pharmacy customers via their own text messaging platform. 
At the end of the intervention, Walmart pharmacy will transfer intervention data (e.g., to which 
intervention each customer was assigned, text messages sent and received) along with customer 
pharmacy and medical data (e.g., whether they received a ¯u shot, previous medical diagnoses) and 
customer demographic data (e.g., age, gender) to the HSRDC for analysis. Identi®able data will not be 
shared.  For both Trial A and Trial B, collaborators at Penn and other institutions will access and 
analyze the non-identi®able data on participants assigned to the interventions they designed through the 
HSRDC. The server does not allow data to be copi[INVESTIGATOR_783574]. Access will only be 
granted to investigators at other institutions after a data use agreement with Penn has been executed.

Annually, the in¯uenza (¯u) causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and 
tens of thousands of deaths in the [LOCATION_002] (CDC, 2020). In this research project, the Behavior 
Change for Good Initiative (BCFG), Penn Medicine Nudge Unit (PMNU), and Geisinger Behavioral 
Insights Team (BIT) will conduct two mega-studies, which will simultaneously test multiple behavioral 
science strategies to increase ¯u vaccination rates and apply machine learning to identify which 
interventions worked best for whom. This research will test at least 40 different interventions, designed 
by [CONTACT_783589], PMNU, and BIT teams. Based on eligible patient appointments from the Fall 
2019 ¯u season, we expected that approximately 80,[ADDRESS_1077451] to increase ¯u vaccination uptake overall 
among Penn Medicine and Geisinger patients (Trial A) and Walmart pharmacy customers (Trial B) 
during the Fall 2020 ¯u season, and 2. Identify heterogeneous treatment effects, determining which 
messages are most effective at improving the health decisions of different subgroups (e.g., based on 
age, gender).
Primary outcome variable(s)
Trial A: The primary outcome is whether participants receive a ¯u vaccination at their primary care 
appointment.  Trial B: The primary outcome is whether participants receive a ¯u vaccination at any time 
in the fall of 2020 at a Walmart pharmacy.
Secondary outcome variable(s)
Trial A: A secondary outcome is whether participants receive a ¯u vaccination after their primary care 
appointment until March 31, 2021, after receiving the intervention. Trial B: A secondary outcome is 
whether participants receive a ¯u vaccination in the before March 31, 2021.
Background
Annually, the in¯uenza causes millions of illnesses, hundreds of thousands of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and tens 
of thousands of deaths in the [LOCATION_002] (CDC, 2020). The most effective way to combat the ¯u is 
with an annual vaccine, which can reduce the risk of contracting the ¯u by 50% and the risk of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88078] 80% (Thompson et al, 2018). The CDC recommends that everyone over 6-months 
old gets an annual ¯u vaccination, and estimates that in the 2017-2018 ¯u season alone (i.e., September

Study Design
Phase*
Not applicable
Design
Participants will be randomly assigned to the different study conditions. Randomization may be 
strati®ed by [CONTACT_654], clinical site, primary care provider role, and other factors.  Care providers will not be 
aware of the intervention received by [CONTACT_2299].
Page 14 of 20Study duration
Trial A: Penn Medicine and Geisinger Health patients with primary care appointments from September 
1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 will be included. These participants may receive intervention messages up to 
four days prior to their scheduled appointments. In some conditions, participants will receive additional 
communications after their appointment about incentives they earned.  Trial B: Walmart pharmacy 
customers will be assigned to an intervention and may receive intervention messages over the course of 
4 days at the start of the ¯u season. They may also receive additional messages about incentives earned 
after receiving a ¯u shot.
Resources necessary for human research protection
Describe research staff and justify that the staff are adequate in number and quali®cations to conduct 
the research. Describe how you will ensure that all staff assisting with the research are adequately 
informed about the protocol and their research related duties. Please allow adequate time for the

Accrual
Penn Medicine, Geisinger Health, and Walmart will provide patient and appointment information to 
WayToHealth to include patients in the research if they are eligible.  The estimated sample (i.e., 80,000 
Penn Medicine patients, 75,000 Geisinger patients, and 1 million Walmart pharmacy customers) is 
based on the number of appointments meeting the eligibility criteria during the 2019-2020 ¯u season at 
Penn Medicine and Geisinger and the number of Walmart pharmacy customers who have consented to 
receive messages about their prescriptions, received a ¯u shot at Walmart in the past and been selected 
for the study by [CONTACT_783590]. We will include at least 4,[ADDRESS_1077454] 
80% power to detect a 3% difference in vaccination rates across conditions.
Key inclusion criteria

Page 16 of 20Procedures
For Trial A, Penn Medicine and Geisinger patients with scheduled primary care appointments during 
the Fall 2020 ¯u season who receive SMS reminders of their appointments from their health system will 
be randomly assigned to receive one of the SMS interventions. For Trial B, all eligible Walmart 
pharmacy customers will be randomly assigned to receive one of the SMS interventions. In both trials, 
participants will receive text messages with the content and timing varying based on the intervention 
design.  For Trial A, patient and appointment data (including patient name, telephone number, zip code 
and town of residence, age, and gender, appointment date, time, and type, practice name [CONTACT_225458], 
information about the primary care physician, and a record of whether they received the ¯u shot) from 
Penn Medicine and Geisinger, will be shared with WayToHealth on a regular basis for study 
implementation (e.g., to randomize participants to condition, deliver intervention content and 
incentives).  After study completion, identi®able information will be removed from the data. 
WayToHealth will transfer the patient and appointment data, in addition to all intervention data (e.g., 
text messages sent and responses received), to LDI HSRDC for storage and analysis. Penn Medicine 
and Geisinger will also transfer additional patient information (e.g., records from previous 
appointments, comorbidities, additional demographic information) to LDI HSRDC for analysis. For 
Trial B, interventions will be implemented on Walmart©s own text messaging platform. Data will be 
shared with LDI HSRDC for storage and analysis after the end of the study. This data will include 
intervention data (e.g., intervention assignment, text messages sent and responses received) and 
pharmacy information (e.g., ¯u shot receipt, medical diagnoses) and customer demographic data (e.g., 
age, gender) from Walmart pharmacy records.

Analysis Plan
For both trials, the primary outcome will be whether participants receive an in¯uenza vaccination, as 
recorded in their medical records or customer data. For Trial A, this will include whether they tell their 
provider they received a vaccination prior to their appointment but after enrollment in our study, receive 
a vaccination at their appointment, or receive their vaccination at another appointment or location after 
enrollment in our study (if documented in their medical record). For Trial B, this will include whether 
they receive the ¯u shot at a Walmart pharmacy after enrollment in our study. We will use an ordinary 
least squares (OLS) regression of a binary vaccination receipt indicator at the individual level, adjusting 
for individual characteristics (e.g., demographics, comorbidities), and visit characteristics (e.g., doctor 
information, clinic site; Trial A only).

Paper-based records will be kept in a secure location and only be accessible to personnel involved 
in the study.
xComputer-based ®les will only be made available to personnel involved in the study through the 
use of access privileges and passwords.
Prior to access to any study-related information, personnel will be required to sign statements 
agreeing to protect the security and con®dentiality of identi®able information.
xWherever feasible, identi®ers will be removed from study-related information.
A Certi®cate of Con®dentiality will be obtained, because the research could place the subject at 
risk of criminal or civil liability or cause damage to the subject©s ®nancial standing, 
employability, or liability.
A waiver of documentation of consent is being requested, because the only link between the 
subject and the study would be the consent document and the primary risk is a breach of 
con®dentiality. (This is not an option for FDA-regulated research.)
xPrecautions are in place to ensure the data is secure by [CONTACT_71994], because 
the research involves web-based surveys.
Audio and/or video recordings will be transcribed and then destroyed to eliminate audible 
identi®cation of subjects.
Subject Con®dentiality
Wherever feasible, identi®ers will be removed from study-related information. Precautions are in place 
to ensure the data are secure by [CONTACT_71994]. Identi®able information that is 
required for implementation (e.g., names, telephone numbers) will be stored on WayToHealth and will 
only be available in order to ensure that the interventions are being implemented correctly. Study data 
will be transferred from the WayToHealth platform to the LDI HSRDC for storage and analysis (for 
Trial A) or directly from Walmart pharmacy to the LDI HSRDC (for Trial B). Both WayToHealth and 
the HSRDC are HIPAA compliant.  All analyses will be conducted on the LDI HSRDC. Access to the 
LDI HSRDC is limited to LDI-af®liated investigators and access is only granted to researchers with the 
necessary skills and training to analyze con®dential data. Requirements for accessing the LDI HSRDC 
are here: https://ldi.upenn.edu/ldi-health-services-research-data-center/access. Data use agreements will 
be executed prior to sharing access with any researchers outside of Penn Medicine. Identi®able data will 
be removed from the dataset before sharing the data with other researchers.
Sensitive Research Information*
Does this research involve collection of sensitive information about the subjects that should be excluded 
from the electronic medical record?
No
Subject Privacy
Privacy refers to the person©s desire to control access of others to themselves. Privacy concerns people, 
whereas con®dentiality concerns data. Describe the strategies to protect privacy giving consideration to 
the following: The degree to which privacy can be expected in the proposed research and the safeguards 
that will be put into place to respect those boundaries. The methods used to identify and contact 
[CONTACT_42148]. The settings in which an individual will be interacting with an investigator. The 
privacy guidelines developed by [CONTACT_153719], professional associations and scholarly 
disciplines (e.g., psychiatry, genetic counseling, oral history, anthropology, psychology). 
This research does not differ substantially from actions typi[INVESTIGATOR_783577]© health care 
providers or pharmacy. Participants will be excluded from the research if they have opted out of 
receiving reminders for their medical appointments. Interactions with participants will be limited to text 
messages and content sent via text message (e.g., links to websites sent via text message).
Data Disclosure
Will the data be disclosed to anyone who is not listed under Personnel?
Project collaborators on the BCFG Scienti®c Team at other institutions will be given access to the data 
via access to the LDI HSRDC (see subject con®dentiality for details). The list of such collaborators will 
be uploaded as a separate attachment in a protocol modi®cation before any data is shared with them.

Minimal Risk*
Participation in this study does not substantially differ from what patients typi[INVESTIGATOR_783578]-related communications from their health system (Trial A) or customers typi[INVESTIGATOR_783579] (Trial B).  For Trial A, Penn Medicine and 
Geisinger patients will receive text messages prior to their scheduled appointments about receiving a ¯u 
vaccination. As part of their normal operations, Penn Medicine and Geisinger Health send patients 
appointment reminders prior to their scheduled appointments and encourage their patients to get the ¯u 
vaccination. This project has received approval from the Penn Medicine privacy of®ce, Information 
systems committee, and Penn medicine executive leadership. The study has been socialized with the 
Geisinger Health Immunization Steering Committee, which has representatives from Marketing, the 
Care Gaps team, infectious disease, Pharmacy, and the Geisinger Health system CMO, and there were 
no concerns. For Trial B, Walmart pharmacy customers will be included if they already receive 
pharmacy text messages from Walmart.
Impact on Subject Rights and Welfare*
Subjects© rights and welfare will not be adversely affected by [CONTACT_783592]. Subjects are free to seek or 
forego ¯u vaccination at any time during or after the study, at their appointment, pharmacy, or any other 
vaccination provider.
Waiver Essential to Research*
It is not feasible to obtain informed consent from subjects in this study. It would be logistically dif®cult 
to obtain informed consent from subjects before texting them intervention messages. Furthermore, for 
many patients or customers, introducing the idea of research into their relationship with their health 
care provider or pharmacy would be the most negative part of the entire experience in the study. 
Patients expect to receive communications from their provider about their appointments and from their 
pharmacy about ¯u shots but do not expect to be communicating about research. Bringing up research 
could also cause the surprised patients to refuse -- possibly to the detriment of their health -- ¯u 
vaccination options that they would otherwise have accepted.

Risk / Bene®t
Potential Study Risks
This study poses minimal risks to health or well being. Flu shots are sometimes accompanied by [CONTACT_276932], but the subjects in this study would have access to ¯u shots in the absence of the intervention, 
and the bene®ts of becoming inoculated substantially outweigh the risks.
Potential Study Bene®ts
The current research is aimed at ®nding better methods for encouraging individuals to receive 
vaccinations to improve their health. We expect that our results will provide insights that health care 
providers can use to encourage vaccinations. In addition, participants may be more likely to receive a 
¯u shot, which will make them less susceptible to the ¯u. See https://www.cdc.gov/¯u/prevent/vaccine-
bene®ts.htm for the bene®ts of the ¯u shot.

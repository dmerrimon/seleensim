PRÉCIS
Background:
•Metastatic or refractory/recurrent small bowel and colorectal cancers are incurable and 
poorly palliated by [CONTACT_83925][INVESTIGATOR_014]. There is an unmet need for active treatments for 
these tumors.
•To date immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_311763]-[ADDRESS_384126] majority of these cancers. 
oIn microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (>95% of these cancers) the 
response rate to checkpoint inhibitors has been <5%.
oPreclinical studies suggest that the use of different combinations of multiple 
immunotherapy agents may improve anti-tumor efficacy. These studies have 
employed (1) a vaccine targeting a tumor associated antigen, (2) an IL-[ADDRESS_384127] (N-803, also known as ALT-803), (3) an anti-PD-L1 MAb or a 
bifunctional fusion protein targeting PD-L1 and TGFβ (M7824), and (4) a tumor 
targeted immunocytokine (NHS-IL12).
Objectives:
•To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria 
(RECIST 1.1) of the combination of (1) CV301, a poxviral based vaccine targeting CEA 
and MUC1, (2) N-803 and (3) M7824; and of the combination of (1) CV301, (2) N-803, 
(3) M7824 and (4) NHS-IL12 (M9241) in subjects with advanced checkpoint naïve MSS 
small bowel and colorectal cancers. 
Eligibility:
•Age > 18 years old
•Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic 
small bowel or colorectal adenocarcinomas. 
•Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the participant declines standard 
treatment after appropriate counseling has been provided.
•Subjects must have measurable disease.
Design:
•This is a phase II trial of combination immunotherapy, with a brief dose escalation 
portion for Arm 2.
•The trial will be conducted using a Simon optimal two-stage design in each Phase II Arm.
•Participants will be enrolled on the following arms in sequential order: (1) Arm 1: CV301 
+ M7824 + N-803, (2) Arm 2A and Arm 2B: CV301 + M7824 + N-803 + NHS-IL12; 
NHS-IL12 dose level will be evaluated in Arm 2A prior to further enrollment in Arm 2B.
•The first six participants on arm 1 will be evaluable for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) 
and accrual will only continue to [ADDRESS_384128] 6 
participants experience a DLT.  
•In Arm 2B, participants will receive 4 drug treatments (CV301 + M7824 + N-803 + 
NHS-IL12), but the dose level of NHS-IL12 will first be determined during a dose 
escalation portion, Arm 2A. Following determination of the MTD or highest safe dose

population’s prognoses. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Metastatic Colon Cancer
Each year, approximately 300,[ADDRESS_384134] received regulatory approval in recent years. However, the overall 
survival benefit seen in phase III studies with these agents is an additional 1-2 months [1-3]. With 
the exception of microsatellite unstable cases of mCRC, activity of ICI monotherapy is rare [4-6].
1.2.[ADDRESS_384135] majority of human carcinomas are characterized as “cold” tumors in that they do not 
respond to checkpoint MAb therapy. Preclinical studies are now revealing that an effective 
immuno-oncology strategy for so-called “cold” tumors such as colon carcinoma (MSS) is the use 
of multiple immune-mediating agents, each targeting different components of the immune system. 
These include: (a) induction of an immune response via vaccination directed against tumor-
associated antigens, (b) potentiation of the systemic immune response by [CONTACT_311799] (such as the N-803, an IL-[ADDRESS_384136] fusion protein) to enhance both NK 
and CD8+ T-cell responses, (c) potentiation of the immune response in the tumor 
microenvironment (TME) by [CONTACT_311800]-IL12 immunocytokine, and (d) 
reduction of immunosuppressive entities in the TME by [CONTACT_311801]-PD1/PDL1 MAb 
checkpoint inhibitors, and/or reduction of immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-β with the 
use of a bifunctional anti-PDL1/TGF-β2 “Trap” designated M7824.
The LTIB, in collaboration with the GMB, has been able to develop and/or co-develop these agents 
via a series of CRADAs. Each has been interrogated in a series of preclinical studies and in Phase 
I/II clinical studies in the CCR as well as by [CONTACT_127761]. Preclinical studies and early 
clinical studies are demonstrating the relative lack of additional toxicities with enhanced clinical 
benefit employing combinations of 2 of these agents. Preclinical studies are now demonstrating

Version Date: 03.25.[ADDRESS_384137] immune-mediated anti-tumor activities.
Avelumab (anti-PD-L1) and M7824 (anti-PD-L1/TGF- βR2)
Studies in the LITB were the first to describe [7, 8] avelumab, a fully human anti-PD-L1 IgG1 
MAb, and its ability to mediate ADCC for a range of human carcinoma cells employing NK cells 
as effectors. Avelumab (Bavencio) has since been approved by [CONTACT_311802] (the first drug approved for this indication) and second line urothelial carcinomas. 
We have also shown that endogenous IL-[ADDRESS_384138]-in-human 
clinical study of avelumab with over 1,700 patients was led by [CONTACT_311803] [8]. Because of the activity this study was amended 
to include multiple expansion cohorts internationally. Because PD-L1 is also expressed on some 
immune cell subsets, and because avelumab can mediate ADCC there was initial concern that 
Avelumab may lead to depletion of PD-L1 expressing immune cells. Our finding [9] that there 
were no adverse events in the patients treated with avelumab above that seen with other anti-PD-
L/PD-L1 MAbs (which did not mediate ADCC) was important for planning further studies with 
avelumab or M7824. 
TGF-β is a well-known inhibitor of immune cell function, especially in the TME [10-15]. Prior 
studies have indicated the advantage in the use of a TGF-β inhibitor in combination with 
checkpoint therapy [16, 17] In collaboration with our CRADA partner EMD Serono, we have co-
developed a bifunctional fusion protein aimed at bringing a TGF-β  TRAP to tumor cells via 
binding to PD-L1. M7824 is a novel fusion protein consisting of avelumab linked to the 
extracellular domain of two TGF-βR2 (serving as a TGF-β TRAP) (Figure 1). We were the first 
to report [18, 19] that M7824 (a) mediates ADCC, (b) increases tumor cell gene expression of 
molecules involved in T-cell trafficking to the tumor, (c) enhances TRAIL- and antigen-specific 
CD8+ T-cell lysis of tumor cells, and (d) reduces TGF-β‒induced immunosuppressive activity. 
We have also recently demonstrated [20] in in vivo preclinical murine carcinoma models 
(Figure 2A and B) that M7824 has the ability to decrease TGF-β‒ induced signaling in the 
TME.

Figure 1 M7824 (anti-PD-L1/TGFβR2): “TRAP”.
Specifically, phosphorylation of SMAD2 was significantly decreased in tumors following M7824 
treatment, and not with an M7824(mut) molecule, devoid of the PD-L1 binding site (Figure 2C). 
In both breast and colon carcinoma murine models, M7824 decreased tumor burden and increased 
survival, which required both CD8+ and NK cell activity (Figure 2D). Two recent studies [21, 22] 
demonstrated the advantage in anti-tumor activity in the use of the bifunctional agent vs. the use 
of a PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint in combination with a systemic TGF-β inhibitor. TGFβ is also known 
to alter human carcinoma cells from a more epi[INVESTIGATOR_311765] a more mesenchymal phenotype and such 
tumor cells are more resistant to a range of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Figure 3). In LTIB studies, TGF-β‒induced 
mesenchymalization of carcinoma cells was shown [23] to be reversed by M7824, rendering tumor 
cells more susceptible to chemotherapy and immune-mediated killing [18, 20, 23].

The first-in-human trial of M7824 (anti-PD-L1/TGF-βR2) was conducted at the CCR. Nineteen 
heavily pretreated patients with solid tumors (non-melanoma) were treated; the MTD was not 
reached. M7824 was shown to saturate peripheral PD-L1 and sequester all released (acid released) 
plasma TGFβ1, -β2, and -β3 throughout the dosing period at >1 mg/kg (recommended phase 2

dose is 1200 mg or about 10 mg/kg). There were signs of clinical efficacy across all dose levels 
(Figure 4, Figure 5), including one ongoing CR (cervical cancer), two durable PRs (pancreatic 
and anal cancers), one near PR (cervical) and two cases of prolonged stable disease [24]. In the 
Phase I study and a subsequent Phase II study, greater than 30‒40% of patients with HPV+ 
malignancies showed evidence of clinical response to M7824 therapy. Prior studies by [CONTACT_311804] 15-20% patient responses in this population employing checkpoint 
inhibition therapy.

N-803 (IL-[ADDRESS_384139])
IL-15 is a well-studied Th1 cytokine. Prior studies by [CONTACT_2312] [25-28] have shown, in both 
preclinical and clinical studies, the ability of prokaryotic rec. IL-15 protein to enhance the level of 
both NK and CD8+ T cells. Limitations in the use of rec. IL-15 center around issues of 
pharmacokinetics and toxicity, and the lack of the IL-15/IL-15R complex for optimal activity. Our 
interest in IL-15 was also pi[INVESTIGATOR_311766] M7824 to mediate ADCC. N-803 
is an IL-15/IL-15Rα-Fc superagonist fusion protein developed by [CONTACT_311805], Inc. (formerly Altor Bioscience and NantCell, Inc.). In a series of studies, we have 
shown [ 19, 29, 30] that N-803 can (a) significantly increase cytotoxic NK cells, showing enhanced 
NK lysis of tumor cells on a per-cell basis, (b) increase memory CD8+ T cells, (c) elicit anti-tumor 
effects in metastatic models of breast and colon carcinoma, and (d) inhibit TGF-β‒mediated 
reduced NK function, leading to increased NK lysis of a range of human carcinoma cell types.  
It has now been reported [31] that N-803 can re-induce objective responses to anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy after treatment relapse or failure. Historically, about 8% of patients with NSCLC 
treated past progression had partial responses with continued PD-1 monoclonal antibodies 
treatment. The objective responses to N-803-nivolumab combination treatment after PD-1 
treatment failure coincided directly with initiation of N-803 after progression in patients with 
relapsed disease treated with uninterrupted nivolumab [31]. Moreover, partial responses were seen 
in 3 out of 10 (30%) patients whose tumor lacked PD-L1 expression and in 3 out of 11 (27%) 
patients who had relapsed or refractory disease after previous anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. The level 
of toxicity observed in the combination was similar to (and perhaps less than) that observed with 
PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. These data suggest that N-803 represents a novel immunotherapeutic 

14
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.[ADDRESS_384140] approach based on the administration of a 
replicating-competent Vaccinia-based delivery vector followed by a Fowlpox vector. Both 
vectors encoded the transgenes for B7.1, ICAM-1 and LFA-3, together with the CEA and MUC-
1. In order to establish its therapeutic potential, several preclinical studies were performed, 
showing that PANVAC activates antigen-specific human T cells in vitro [32], elicits antibody 
and cellular immune responses in vivo, and shows significant antitumor efficacy against tumors 
expressing either human CEA or MUC-1 in mice, resulting in programmed death ligand 1 (PD-
L1) up-regulation within the tumor microenvironment. Subsequently, the clinical development 
program continued with the design of several clinical trials to further confirm the efficacy and 
safety of this intervention. Overall, the results of Phase I and II clinical trials in different cancer 
populations employing PANVAC monotherapy or in combination with GM-CSF or docetaxel 
demonstrate a good safety profile accompanied by [CONTACT_311806] [33, 34].
A second generation cancer immunotherapy strategy was developed, giving rise to CV301 
involving a modified vaccinia. CV301 is a recombinant non-replicating poxvirus based 
immunotherapy encoding the same 5 transgenes used in PANVAC (B7.1, ICAM-1, LFA-3, CEA 
and MUC-1) and thus designed to activate an antigen-specific response.  Therefore, tumors 
expressing these antigens, including colon cancer, qualify as a potential indication for CV301. 
Given the potential risks associated with the replicating capacity of the vaccinia-based PANVAC-
V construct, the next generation cancer immunotherapeutic candidate MVA-BN-CV301 was 
generated by [CONTACT_311807] a CRADA with the NCI (LTIB). It constitutes a 
recombinant non-replicating poxvirus- based immunotherapy derived from the MVA-BN 
construct. This novel viral vector was developed from the highly attenuated vaccinia virus known 
as MVA, which after more than [ADDRESS_384141] 
approximately 15% of the original vaccinia genome. Furthermore, MVA-BN differs from other 
MVA strains in its extensive plaque purification and propagation in serum-free conditions, and has 
already undergone extensive investigation as a new smallpox vaccine. Within this comprehensive 
clinical development program, MVA-BN has been administered to more than 7,[ADDRESS_384142] specific antigens.
The new CV301 strategy encodes the same 5 transgenes expressed by [CONTACT_311808]: CEA, MUC-1, B7.1, ICAM-[ADDRESS_384143] 
is expected to promote an antigen-specific targeted immune response for tumors expressing these 
15

regimen employing an MVA-BN-CV301 priming dose followed by a Fowlpox-based FPV-CV301 
boosting dose, thus replacing the former PANVAC-V and PANVAC-F components. Given the 
existing correspondences between the CV301 and PANVAC vectors, the clinical development 
program designed for CV301 will rely on the extensive nonclinical and clinical data currently 
available from PANVAC.
Clinical Safety Data
Analysis of safety data from a Phase 1/1b clinical trial of CV301 in 24 subjects showed no dose 
limiting toxicities at a dosage up to 1.6 × 109 Inf.U of MVA-BN-CV301. 
In both Phase 1b cohorts (CV301 plus nivolumab and CV301 plus pembrolizumab) the safety of 
the combination regimen was established. There was only one case of DLT reported due to 
immune mediated events in the nivolumab combination: one case of pneumonitis that further 
developed into a vasculitis, DIC and ultimately multi organ failure (fatal outcome). Overall, DLT 
and IMAE were below the pre-specified threshold to continue the trial based on the now 
established safety profile. In conclusion, there was no increased toxicity of the combination 
regimens CV301 plus pembrolizumab or nivolumab as compared to ICIs alone (per ICI 
prescribing information). 
The clinical safety data for the MVA-BN backbone vector and its recombinant products tested 
clinically to date are provided in Section 5.[ADDRESS_384145] received MVA-BN and MVA-BN 
based recombinant products in completed and ongoing clinical trials. 
Six of the seven clinical trials with CV301’s predecessor product PANVAC with data available 
have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for the vaccines. Across these clinical trials, the 
most common treatment-related AEs were injection site reaction (including injection site 
erythema, injection site pain, and injection site swelling), myalgia, fatigue, vomiting, nausea, and 
abdominal pain. Most treatment-related AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. SAEs related to study 
treatment, discontinuations due to AE, and deaths related to study treatment were rare (only 1 
death due to Grade 5 pulmonary infiltrate was assessed as possibly related to study drug).
Cardiac toxicity: 
A detailed analysis of the TEAEs reported under the cardiac disorders SOC in clinical trial TBC-
PAN-[ADDRESS_384146] been no reported observations of 
myocarditis or pericarditis in any of the PANVAC clinical trials. 
Based upon these data and the total clinical experience with poxvirus vectors for anticancer 
vaccines, including CV301’s predecessor product PANVAC, a causal relationship of cardio-
toxicity following treatment with CV301 and/or PANVAC is unlikely. Nonetheless, a proactive 
approach in pharmacovigilance will be applied prospectively, requesting from the investigators a

deeper characterization of every case with a cardiac AE with the working hypothesis that 
myocarditis/pericarditis may be the underlying cause. 
Further toxicities monitored during clinical trials: 
Immune-Mediated Adverse Events: Autoimmune diseases and immune-mediated clinical 
syndromes, emerging since the initiation of trial product, will be reported as potential IMAEs. So 
far, no signal has emerged from the diverse poxvirus constructs studied in the clinic, but the 
theoretical possibility exists that breaking the immune tolerance to self-antigens may induce 
autoimmune phenomena. This possibility deserves close monitoring.
CV-[ADDRESS_384147] completed at the NCI [35]. As expected, there were no grade 3 or 
greater toxicities reported in the study. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. Twelve patients 
enrolled on trial [dose level (DL) 1 = 3, DL2 = 3, DL3 = 6). Most side effects were seen with the 
prime doses and lessened with subsequent boosters. All treatment-related adverse events were 
temporary, self-limiting, grade 1/2, and included injection-site reactions and flu-like symptoms. 
Antigen-specific T cells to MUC1 and CEA, as well as to a cascade antigen, brachyury, were 
generated in most patients. Single-agent BN-CV301 produced a confirmed partial response (PR) 
in 1 patient and prolonged stable disease (SD) in multiple patients, most notably in KRAS-mutant 
gastrointestinal tumors. Furthermore, 2 patients with KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer had

NHS-IL12 is a tumor targeting immunocytokine that binds to DNA-histone in necrotic areas of

human tumors ( Figure 6) . Prior studies in the LTIB have shown the ability of this agent to elicit 
anti-tumor activity in multiple murine models, and in combination with anti-PD-L1 and with 
radiation and chemotherapy [36]. J. Strauss (LTIB), in collaboration with J. Gulley (GMB, 
CCR), conducted the Phase I dose escalation trial of the NHS-IL12 immunocytokine [36]. Due to 
known prior toxicities using a rec. IL-12 protein, multiple ascending dose levels were employed 
and the agent was administered every 4 weeks. Time-dependent increase in serum IFN-γ and 
subsequent rise in IL-10 increased with dose and varied greatly among patients (Figure 7A ). 
Increases in TCR diversity and TIL density in the TME following NHS-IL12 dosing were 
observed in those patients with elevated IFN-γ serum levels (Figure 7B). Toxicity was 
acceptable with an MTD of 16.8 mcg/kg. Although no objective tumor responses were seen, of

Our recent preclinical studies (Figure 8) have also shown that there is enhanced anti-tumor effect 
of avelumab when used in combination with NHS-IL12 (Figure 8) and that this effect is mediated 
via an IFN-γ‒dependent mechanism. Studies in NSG-β2m‒/‒ mice bearing a human carcinoma and 
reconstituted with human PBMC also showed the enhanced anti-tumor effect of the combination 
that coincided with increased NK and CD8+ in the TME. This further provided the rationale for an 
ongoing CCR led clinical study of avelumab in combination with NHS-IL12 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), 
currently evaluating safety and efficacy of the combination. In addition to the combination being 
found to be safe and well-tolerated, evidence of clinical responses has been observed. As an 
example, a patient with checkpoint refractory metastatic urothelial cancer with a large sacral mass 
and retroperitoneal adenopathy at enrollment has had an ongoing complete response for 21+ 
months and a patient with rapi[INVESTIGATOR_311768] 15+ months. 
Combination Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_311769] a consequence of the potential multi-functionality of M7824, we have conducted several 
combination studies employing this agent. We have previously shown [20] enhanced anti-tumor 
activity when M7824 is combined with vaccine in a metastatic carcinoma murine model (Figure 
9). While M7824 can mediate ADCC for a range of human carcinoma cells, it is not as potent as 
avelumab in this mechanism; the addition of N-803, however, enhanced the ADCC activity of both

avelumab and M7824, but more importantly, increased the tumor lytic ability of M7824 to that 
equivalent of avelumab with N-803 [29] (Figure 10). 
A series of preclinical studies have been carried out employing combinations of vaccine, M7824, 
N-803, and NHS-IL12. Combining M7824 with the NHS-IL12 molecule greatly enhanced anti-
tumor activity (Figure 11). Tumor challenge studies showed the presence of immune memory. 
This was shown in 3 different murine carcinoma models.

Safety data with the combination of Nivolumab and N-803 has been reported [31]. Twenty-three 
patients were enrolled and 21 patients treated at four dose levels of N-803 (6,10,15, and 20 mcg/kg) 
in combination with nivolumab at standard FDA approved dosing. No dose limiting toxicities were 
observed. And the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. The most common adverse events 
were injection site reactions (in 19 [90%] of 21 patients) and flu-like symptoms (in 15 [71%] of 
21 patients). The most common grade 3 adverse events, occurring in two patients each were 
lymphopenia and fatigue. A grade 3 myocardial infarction occurred in one patient (only case of 
treatment discontinuation due to AE). No grade [ADDRESS_384153] been treated with the combination of avelumab (anti PD-L1) and NHS-
IL12. 26 patients in four dose levels of NHS-IL12 (4, 8, 12, or 16.8 mcg/kg) in combination with

level which received NHS-IL12 at 16.8 mcg/kg in combination with avelumab 800 mg flat dosing

The level of toxicity observed with all of these combinations were similar to (and perhaps less 
than) that observed with PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy. 
1.2.4 Clinical Rationale for using M7824 over other anti PD-L1 agents in Immunotherapy 
Combinations
M7824 is being chosen over other anti PD-1/L1 agents as M7824 has been well tested in the CCR 
having had the first in human phase I trial done here and also having shown early promising 
efficacy in a number of tumor types often beyond the efficacy observed with avelumab or other 
anti PD-L1 agents. As an example in a subset analysis of patients treated within the dose-escalation 
cohort with human papi[INVESTIGATOR_28597] (HPV)-associated disease (n = 17), including patients with anal, 
cervical, and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, there was an ORR of 35.3%, and an 
ORR of 41.7% in patients with known HPV-positive disease (n = 12) which exceeded the expected 
ORR of 15-20% expected with single agent PD-L1 inhibition [41]. In another cohort of patients 
with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expressing tumors the confirmed ORR was 40.7% in patients 
treated at the recommended phase II dose (1200 mg every 2 weeks) which also compared favorably 
to the 15-20% expected response rate with single agent PD-L1 inhibition.  In patients with high-
PD-L1 expressing tumors, the ORR was 71.4% (n = 7) [ 42]. Based upon its potentially enhanced 
efficacy, M7824 is being used as the anti PD-1/L1 agent of choice in a number of combination 
trials either ongoing or planned in the CCR. In addition, once the safety profile of M6903 is well 
defined in combination with M7824 we plan to further expand on this combination by [CONTACT_311813][INVESTIGATOR_014].   
1.2.5 Dose Rationale
In the phase I dose escalation trial of combination N-803 and M7824, escalating doses of N-803 
were evaluated at 10 and 15 mcg/kg given with a standard flat RP2D of M7824 at 1200 mg.  No 
DLTs were observed. Therefore, a dose of 15 mcg/kg of N-[ADDRESS_384157] RP2D of M7824 at 1200 mg. In the phase I dose escalation 
trial of combination Avelumab (anti-PD-L1) + NHS-IL12, escalating doses of NHS-IL12 were 
evaluated at 8,12, and 16.8 mcg/kg given every [ADDRESS_384158] dose evaluated (16.8 mcg/kg 
given every 4 weeks) was found to be well tolerated. The only DLT observed on the trial was a 
transient grade [ADDRESS_384159]/ALT elevation at NHS-IL12 at 12 mcg/kg but otherwise no other DLT was 
observed and the MTD was not reached. On another trial (20C0045) evaluating the combination 
of a therapeutic cancer vaccine plus NHS-IL12 at 16.8 mcg/kg and M7824 no DLTs were observed 
in the six participant lead in safety cohort, although the majority of original participants (11/19; 
57.9%) treated on that trial needed dose reductions of NHS-IL12 when given in combination with 
the therapeutic cancer vaccine and M7824 due to grade 2 fever or flu like symptoms. After further 
evaluation a dose of NHS-IL12 at 8 mcg/kg was found to be very tolerable when combined with a 
therapeutic cancer vaccine and M7824 on that other trial. Therefore, based on that data we 
evaluated NHS-IL12 at a dose of 8 mcg/kg on both this study and the 20C0045 study. However, 
after evaluating a total of 39 patients on the 20C0045 study including 21 patients with starting dose 
of 16.8 mcg/kg and 18 patients with starting dose of 8 mcg/kg we observed what looks to be 
reduced efficacy in patients receiving 8 mcg/kg as a starting dose with only 3/18 patients 
responding with the 8 mcg/kg starting dose as compared to 11/21 with the 16.8 mcg/kg starting 
dose. Therefore, based on this observation that the possibility that a lowering starting dose of NHS-
28
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.2025
IL12 may reduce efficacy in combination with vaccine and M7824, we are amending to allow 
treatment (effective with Protocol Amendment Version 10.20.2021) with a limited number of 
doses of NHS-IL12 at 16.8 mcg/kg (four doses total) before reducing NHS-IL12 to 8 mcg/kg on 
both this study and the 20C0045 study. This is based upon responding patients in the first 21 
patients on the 20C0045 study which received anywhere between 1-4 doses of NHS-IL12 at 16.8 
mcg/kg before dose reductions were made. 
Although N-[ADDRESS_384160] potential overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685] (e.g., grade 1-2 flu like 
symptoms), it should be noted that no DLTs were observed in the six patient safety lead in 
combination of NHS-IL12 at 8 mcg/kg and N-803 at 10 mcg/kg.  The NHS-IL12 and N-803 doses 
are being given on alternating schedules to minimize overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_50685]. Additionally, it was 
noted that 3/6 patients on this dose level (NHS-IL12 at 8 mcg/kg + N-803 10 mcg/kg in 
combination with vaccine and M7824) had bleeding events which did not meet DLT criteria but 
nonetheless limited patients’ ability to receive further treatment with M7824 as part of this 
combination. Therefore, we are planning to dose reduce M7824 to [ADDRESS_384161] dose level on Arm 2A which also includes NHS-IL12 at 16.8 mcg/kg (for up to 
a total of 4 doses before reducing to 8 mcg/kg) + N-803 at 10 mcg/kg. A dose of M7824 at [ADDRESS_384162] been developed in the LTIB to better define the mechanism(s) 
involved in the use of specific novel agents, as monotherapy or in combination therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], both for 
preclinical and clinical studies (Section 5.1). In addition to analyses of biopsies, analyses of the 
peripheral immunome can provide valuable information in that multiple samples can be analyzed 
over the course of a given therapy vs. pre-therapy. The LTIB has now developed and employed 
[8, 9, 24, 43] a flow cytometry‒based assay that can analyze 123 immune cell subsets in human 
PBMC from one vial of processed PBMC (approximately 10^ 7 cells). This assay will be used in 
this clinical trial to detect multiple subsets of CD4+ T cells (n=32), CD8+ T cells (n=29), Tregs 
(n=7), B cells (n=5), NK (n=20), NKT (n=4), DC (n=10), and MDSC (n=16) to better understand 
the role of each agent. We also plan to evaluate changes in TCR clonal diversity both in biopsies 
and the periphery. One example involves an ongoing first-in-human trial of the NHS-IL12 tumor-
targeting immunocytokine. TCR diversity increased 6-14‒fold in biopsies of patients with a high 
or intermediate IFN-γ  response but were unchanged or decreased with a low IFN-γ response. These 
findings also correlated with TIL in biopsies. We are also currently employing NanoString 
analyses to identify a gene signature [CONTACT_311840], pre- and post-treatment. The GMB 
will conduct multiplexed, multispectral imaging of FFPE tissue to evaluate multiple immune 
parameters within the TME before and after treatment in patients with available tissue.

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
•This is a phase II trial of combination immunotherapy, with a brief dose escalation portion 
for Arm 2.  
•The trial will be conducted using a Simon optimal two-stage design in each Phase II Arm.
•Participants will be enrolled on the following two arms in sequential order: (1) CV301+ 
M7824 + N-803, (2) CV301 + M7824 + N-803 + NHS-IL12 (Figure 17).
•Given the known overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_311774]-IL12 and N-803 (e.g., flu like symptoms), 
as of the amendment dated 10.20.[ADDRESS_384176] dosing of vaccines and M7824 with N-803 at 10 mcg/kg and 
escalating doses of NHS-IL12 at 8 and 16.8 mcg/kg using a modified 3+3 design (six 
patients per dose level; if < 2/6 patients with DLTs may move up to higher dose level; if > 
1/6 patients with DLTs may move to lower dose level). Dose level 1 on Arm 2A (including 
N-803 at 10 mcg/kg and NHS-IL12 at 8 mcg/kg) was found to be safe without any DLTs. 
Therefore, we plan to escalate to dose level 2 on Arm 2A evaluating the combination of N-
803 at 10 mcg/kg and NHS-IL12 at 16.8 mcg/kg (for up to 4 consecutive doses followed 
by 8 mcg/kg thereafter) with standard dosed vaccine + M7824 at 300 mg). The maximum 
tolerated dose level deemed safe on Arm 2Awill be expanded to nine evaluable patients 
and used for the Simon optimal two-stage design. If dose level 2 on Arm 2A is determined 
to be the maximum tolerated dose and expanded to nine evaluable patients in Arm 2B as

Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.2025
part of the Simon two stage design then dose level 1 on Arm 2A may also be expanded up 
to nine evaluable patients for further immune correlative assessments. 
•The first six participants on arm 1 will be evaluable for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and 
accrual will only continue to [ADDRESS_384177] 6 pts 
experience a DLT. 
•In Arm 2A, participants will receive the combination of 4 treatments, but the dose level of 
NHS-IL12will be determined during a dose escalation using a modified 3+3 design (six 
patients per dose level; if < 2/6 patients with DLTs may move up to higher dose level; if > 
1/6 patients with DLTs may move to lower dose level). Following determination of the 
MTD or highest safe dose evaluated, the [ADDRESS_384178] stage of Arm 2B.
•There will be a minimum of 28 days between the sixth participant (last participant for 
determining safety) enrolled to Cohort [ADDRESS_384179] participant 
enrolled on cohort 2 and assigned to Arm 2A
•There will be a minimum of one week between the first three subjects enrolled in Arm [ADDRESS_384180] recent enrollee. 
Once a dosage combination has been determined to be safe in six participants further 
participants may enroll at any time to that dosage combination.  
•In the second stage of the Simon optimal two-stage design, if two or more out of nine 
participants have objective responses on a given arm that arm will be expanded to enroll 
20 evaluable participants 
•It is possible that the response rates observed with combination immunotherapy will be 
less in participants who have previously received checkpoint therapy and not be truly 
reflective of a population of participants who have not had prior checkpoint therapy. While 
checkpoint experienced participants will not be excluded from enrollment, the primary 
efficacy analyses will be limited to checkpoint naïve participants with MSS colon cancer 
and efficacy analyses in the checkpoint refractory participants will be only exploratory.
•Participants with small bowel cancers are being evaluated in this trial as well as participants 
with colorectal cancer but if efficacy is not observed in the first stage of the Simon II step 
design for either Arm 1 or Arm 2B than participants with small bowel cancer may be 
replaced with participants with colorectal cancer at the discretion of the investigator.

Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.2025
Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as any one of the following adverse events, possibly 
attributable to study drugs, that occur within 28 days of the start of therapy:
•Any Grade 3 or greater adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as defined by [CONTACT_3989] v5.0 and 
assessed as possibly attributed to an agent except for any of the following:
oGrade 3 flu-like symptoms or fever, as well as associated symptoms of fatigue, 
headaches, nausea, emesis which can be controlled with conservative medical 
management.  
oTumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites 
of known or suspected tumor.
oGrade 3 Hgb decrease (< 8.0 g/dL) not attributed to grade 3 or greater bleeding 
events that is clinically manageable with blood transfusions or erythroid growth 
factor use does not require treatment discontinuation. 
oGrade 3 laboratory values laboratory values that are asymptomatic or resolve to 
Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_384181] no clinical correlate (e.g., 
lymphopenia). 
oKeratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 
oAny endocrinopathy that can be medically managed with hormone replacement
oAny grade 3 adverse drug reaction which can be medically managed with minimal 
risk to the participant (e.g., placement of a pleural catheter for recurrent 
inflammatory pleural effusions) and resolves to at least grade one or baseline grade 
within [ADDRESS_384182] been treated on a given arm. If there 
are 5 or more of 20 (25.0%) who experience a response in a given arm, this would be sufficiently 
interesting to warrant further study. 
In the event that a participant develops a response (>30% decrease in target lesions as compared 
with baseline scan) following initial progression or “pseudo-progression”, this response will be 
considered as an objective response in the determination to expand accrual.

3.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
3.2.1 General Rule 
A window of +/- 14 days for a scheduled treatment is allowed in the event of scheduling issues 
(i.e., holiday, bad weather or other scheduling issues). The minimum time between administrations 
of a similar agent is 11 days.
3.2.2 CV301
The CV301 vaccine regimen consists of MVA-BN-CV301 (priming vaccine) and FPV-CV301 
(booster vaccine).
MVA-BN-CV301 is administered as four subcutaneous injections (4 x 108 infectious units/0.5 mL 
each) on D1 and D15. Starting on D29, FPV-CV301 (1 x 109 infectious units/ 0.5mL) is 
administered every 4 weeks on Arm 1 or every 6 weeks on Arm 2A and 2B for up to one year. 
MVA-BN-CV301 is administered as one injection in each of the following locations: upper left 
arm, upper right arm, upper left thigh and upper right thigh (i.e., four injection sites per dose). 
Alternate subcutaneous sites may be used with approval of the principle investigator.
FPV-CV301 is administered as a subcutaneous injection preferably in the upper arm (i.e., one 
injection site per dose). An alternate subcutaneous site may be used with approval of the principle 
investigator.
3.2.3 M7824
Subjects will receive M7824 via IV infusion over 1 hour (-10 minutes / +20 minutes, that is, over 
50 to 80 minutes) once every 2 weeks. M7824 will be administered as a "flat" dose of either 300 
mg or 1,200 mg independent of body weight depending on dose level. M7824 is administered as 
an intravenous infusion with a mandatory 0.2 micron in-line filter.
In order to mitigate potential infusion-related reactions, premedication with an antihistamine and 
with acetaminophen (for example, 25-50 mg diphenhydramine and 500-650 mg acetaminophen 
within approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to dosing of M7824 is optional and at the discretion 
of the Investigator.
3.2.4 N-803
N-803 will be given via subcutaneous injection at a dose of 15 mcg/kg every four weeks on Arm 
1 and 10 mcg/kg every four weeks on Arm 2A and Arm 2B.    
N-[ADDRESS_384183] dose. 
The dose will be re-calculated at the beginning of each subsequent cycle in the event of a 10% or 
greater weight change. If the weight at the beginning of each subsequent cycles is within 10%, the 
previous dose may be used or the dose may be re-calculated based on local site procedures. 
Injection should occur in the abdomen and injection sites should be rotated per institutional 
guidelines and each injection site separated by [CONTACT_2669] 1 inch. Depending on the injection volume 
required, the dose of N-803 may be administered as a single injection or multiple injections at the 
discretion of the investigator. 
39
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.2025
3.2.5 NHS-IL12
NHS-IL12 will be administered at a dose of 8 or 16.8 mcg/kg by [CONTACT_36128] [ADDRESS_384184]’s weight is 10% 
or less than the weight used for the last dose calculation. 
Note: Vital signs will be obtained prior to treatment and [ADDRESS_384185].
3.4 DOSE MODIFICATIONS
3.4.1 Discontinuation
Treatment with individual agents will be discontinued in the case of:
•Any Grade 4 or higher adverse drug reactions (ADRs) as defined by [CONTACT_3989] v5.0 and 
assessed as possibly related to that agent by [CONTACT_737], except for laboratory values 
that are asymptomatic or resolve to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline grade within 7 days without 
medical intervention”. 
•Any Grade 3 ADRs possibly attributed to an agent except for any of the following:
oGrade 3 flu-like symptoms or fever, as well as associated symptoms of fatigue, 
headaches, nausea, emesis which can be controlled with conservative medical 
management.  
oTumor flare phenomenon defined as local pain, irritation, or rash localized at sites of 
known or suspected tumor.
oGrade 3 Hgb decrease (< 8.0 g/dL) that is clinically manageable with blood transfusions 
or erythroid growth factor use does not require treatment discontinuation. 
oGrade 3 laboratory values that are asymptomatic or resolve to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline 
grade within 14 days. 
oKeratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. 
oAny endocrinopathy that can be medically managed with hormone replacement
oAny grade 3 adverse drug reaction which can be medically managed with minimal risk 
to the participant (e.g., placement of a pleural catheter for recurrent inflammatory pleural 
effusions) and resolves to at least grade one or baseline grade within [ADDRESS_384186] possibly attributed to that agent 
until resolution to Grade ≤ [ADDRESS_384187] in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_311775]. Should a clinically 
40
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.[ADDRESS_384188] for more than 4 weeks, consideration should be given to 
discontinuing treatment with that individual agent at the discretion of the investigator. 
For non-medical logistical reasons, unrelated acute illnesses, or palliative radiation, scheduled 
assessments and dosing can be delayed up to 2 months. Where at all possible, dosing should be 
restarted to keep in line with the original treatment schedule.     
N-803 may be held or delayed on the day of a planned dose for either of the following situations: 
•the participant has a fever of > 101°F (38.3 °C); 
•if in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_021], holding would be of benefit to the participant; 
•hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg). 
N-803 dosing should be held for hypotension (defined as systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm 
Hg) if in the presence of any clinically significant symptoms (in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_33398]), until the systolic blood pressure reading is stable. If mild dehydration is suspected, an 
IV fluid bolus may be used per standard of care.
3.4.3 Dose Modification 
Participants with dose modifications or skipped doses within DLT period (for first 6 participants 
in Arm 1 and all participants during dose escalation in Arm 2A) for reasons other than a DLT (e.g., 
logistical reasons) who do not experience a DLT within the DLT window will not be evaluable for 
DLTs and will be replaced for the DLT assessment.  Participants who have dose modifications or 
skipped doses within the DLT period for logistical reasons and nevertheless experience a DLT 
within the DLT period will be considered DLT evaluable. 
CEA/ MUC1 vaccines: Vaccine doses will not be modified but doses may be skipped per 
investigator discretion. 
N-803: Doses may be reduced to 4, 6 or 8 mcg/kg dose or doses may be skipped. On Arm1, if 
participants do not tolerate N-803 at 15 mcg/kg every 4 weeks, N-803 may be given on an 
alternative treatment schedule at lower doses every 2 weeks per investigator discretion.  
M7824: Doses may be reduced to a 200 or 300 mg flat dose or doses may be skipped.
NHS-IL12: Doses may be reduced to a 4,6, 8 or 12 mcg/kg dose or doses may be skipped.
Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_10020]: Any death at least possibly related to study regimen will prompt a suspension of 
accrual and reassessment of available safety information prior to reopening study to accrual.
As a general rule consideration should be given to holding doses of drugs when a toxicity greater 
than grade [ADDRESS_384189] 14 days between doses of this agent. 
Dose reductions for vaccine and M7824 are not allowed. If repeated grade 2 adverse events occur 
than consideration should be given to permanently discontinuing a given agent.

3.4.4 Guidelines for Management of Infusion Reactions
(In addition to the below guidelines, investigators may also use NCCN, ASCO, SITC or FDA 
guidelines for Immune Related Adverse Events) 
NCI-CTCAE Grade Treatment Modification for Infused Agent 
(M7824)
Grade 1 – mild
Mild transient reaction; infusion interruption not 
indicated; intervention not indicated.Consider decreasing the infusion rate of the 
particular agent by 50% and monitoring closely 
for any worsening.
Grade 2 – moderate
Therapy or infusion interruption indicated but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment (e.g., 
antihistamines, NSAIDs, narcotics, i.v. fluids); 
prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours.Consider temporarily discontinuing infusion of 
the particular agent.
Consider resuming infusion of the particular agent 
at 50% of previous rate once infusion related 
reaction has resolved or decreased to at least 
Grade 1 in severity, and monitor closely for any 
worsening.
Grade 3 or Grade 4 – severe or life-threatening
Grade 3: Prolonged (e.g., not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_77984]/or brief 
interruption of infusion); hospi[INVESTIGATOR_151465].
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent 
intervention indicated.Stop the infusion immediately and disconnect 
infusion tubing from the subject.
For grade 3 events:  Consider withdrawing 
immediately from treatment with that particular 
agent and not offering any further treatment with 
that agent based upon if the clinical condition can 
be safely managed.
For grade 4 events: Withdraw immediately from 
treatment and do not offer further treatment with 
that agent. 
If the infusion rate of M7824 has been decreased by 50% or interrupted due to an infusion reaction, 
keep it decreased for the next scheduled infusion. If no infusion reaction is observed in the next 
scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be returned to baseline at the subsequent infusions based 
on investigator’s medical judgment. 
If hypersensitivity reaction occurs, the subject should be treated according to the best available 
medical practice.

•The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_311820]/or should continue in the study.
•Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if 
necessary, an IRB approved certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address 
or local equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_21457]’s medical record or study file. 
•Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
Any medications (other than those excluded by [CONTACT_73326]) that are considered 
necessary to protect subject welfare or alleviate symptoms and will not interfere with the trial 
medication may be given at the Investigator’s discretion.
Palliative radiotherapy delivered in a normal organ-spearing technique may be administered during 
the trial. The assessment of PD will not be based on the necessity for palliative radiotherapy.

samples are available:
1. PBMCs may be analyzed for changes in standard immune cell types (CD4 and CD8 T cells, 
natural killer [NK] cells, regulatory T cells [Tregs], myeloid-derived suppressor cells 
[MDSCs], and dendritic cells) as well as 123 immune cell subsets, using multi-color flow 
cytometry.
2. PBMCs from selected subjects may be analyzed for function of specific immune cell 
subsets, including CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells, Tregs, and MDSCs using flow-based 
assays.
3. PBMCs may be analyzed for tumor antigen-specific immune responses using an 
intracellular cytokine staining assay. PBMCs will be stimulated in vitro with overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 
15-mer peptide pools encoding the tumor-associated antigens such as CEA, MUC-1 and 
Brachyury; control peptide pools will involve the use of human leukocyte antigen peptide 
as a negative control and CEFT peptide mix as a positive control. CEFT is a mixture of 
peptides of CMV, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, and tetanus toxin. Post-stimulation 
analyses of CD4 and CD8 T cells will involve the production of IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF, and the 
degranulation marker CD107a. If sufficient PBMCs are available, assays may also be 
performed for the development of T cells to other tumor-associated antigens.

delivery of the specimens.
All data associated with the participant samples is protected by [CONTACT_2329] a secure database. All 
samples drawn at the NIH Clinical Center will be transported to the Clinical Support Laboratory 
at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research by [CONTACT_251706].
Samples will be tracked and managed by [CONTACT_311827], where there is no link to 
personal identifiable information. All samples will be stored in either a -80ºC freezer or vapor 
phase liquid nitrogen. These freezers are located at NCI Frederick Central Repository in Frederick, 
Maryland.
NCI Frederick Central Repositories (managed under a subcontract) store, among other things, 
biological specimens in support of NIH clinical studies. All specimens are stored in secure, 
limited-access facilities with sufficient security, backup, and emergency support capability and 
monitoring to ensure long-term integrity of the specimens for research. 
Specimens are stored in accordance with applicable HHS and FDA Protection of Human Subjects 
Regulations in accordance with the subcontractor’s Federal-wide Assurance.  The subcontractor’s 
role limited to clinical research databases and repositories containing participant specimens. The 
subcontractor does not conduct or have any vested interest in research on human subjects but does 
provide services and support the efforts of its customers, many of which are involved in research

6.3 RESPONSE C RITERIA
6.3.1 Antitumor Response
Tumor assessments may include the following evaluations: physical examination (with photograph 
and measurement of skin lesions, as applicable); cross-sectional imaging using computed 
tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis 
(pelvis scan is optional unless known pelvic disease is present at baseline); nuclear bone scan for 
subjects with known/suspected bone lesions; and CT or MRI scan of the brain (only as clinically 
warranted based on symptoms/findings). The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with 
contrast. If CT with contrast is contraindicated, CT of the chest without contrast and MRI scan of 
the abdomen/pelvis is preferred. 
At baseline, tumor lesions will be selected and categorized as target or non-target lesions. Target 
lesions include those lesions that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension as ≥ 20 mm 
with conventional techniques or ≥ [ADDRESS_384218] scan. Malignant lymph nodes with a short axis 
diameter ≥ 15 mm can be considered target lesions. Up to a maximum of 2 target lesions per organ 
and 5 target lesions in total will be identified at baseline. These lesions should be representative of 
all involved organs and selected based on their size (those with the longest diameter) and their 
suitability for accurate repeated measurements. A sum of the longest lesion diameter (LLD) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum LLD. For malignant lymph nodes 
identified as target lesions, the short axis diameter will be used in the sum of LLD calculation. All 
other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions (including bone 
lesions).
All post-baseline response assessments should follow the same lesions identified at baseline. The 
same mode of assessment (e.g., CT) used to identify/evaluate lesions at baseline should be used 
throughout the course of the study unless subject safety necessitates a change (e.g., allergic 
reaction to contrast media).
For the primary endpoint antitumor activity will be evaluated with target and/or non-target lesions 
according to RECIST Version 1.1.
6.3.2 Disease Parameters
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as: 
•By [CONTACT_13190] x-ray: > 20 mm; 
•By [CONTACT_3610]: 
oScan slice thickness 5 mm or under: as > 10 mm
oScan slice thickness > 5 mm: double the slice thickness 
•With calipers on clinical exam: > [ADDRESS_384219] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
61
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.[ADDRESS_384220] be > [ADDRESS_384221] scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended 
to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will be measured 
and followed.
Non-measurable disease. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not 
followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable.
Note: Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if 
they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Target lesions. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that 
lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the 
largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next 
largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters 
(longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated 
and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then 
only the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline sum diameters will be used as reference to 
further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.
Non-target lesions. All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or 
in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
6.3.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical lesions: Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules). In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
62
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.[ADDRESS_384222] x-ray: Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776]. However, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based 
on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_384223] slice thickness greater 
than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is 
also acceptable in certain situations (e.g., for body scans).
Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; 
however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image 
quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable 
globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning 
sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, 
as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at baseline and the 
lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the 
RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body 
parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition 
protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed 
with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
6.3.4 Response Criteria
All the scans performed at Baseline and other imaging performed as clinically required (other 
supportive imaging) need to be repeated at subsequent visits. In general, lesions detected at 
Baseline need to be followed using the same imaging methodology and preferably the same 
imaging equipment at subsequent tumor evaluation visits.
Brain CT / MRI scan should be performed, if clinically indicated by [CONTACT_311828]. For each subject, the Investigator will 
designate 1 or more of the following measures of tumor status to follow for determining response: 
CT or MRI images of primary and / or metastatic tumor masses, physical examination findings, 
and the results of other assessments. All available images collected during the trial period will be 
considered. The most appropriate measures to evaluate the tumor status of a subject should be 
used. The measure(s) to be chosen for sequential evaluation during the trial have to correspond to 
the measures used to document the progressive tumor status that qualifies the subject for 
enrollment. The tumor response assessment will be assessed and listed according to the Study 
Calendar 3.5.
The foreseen treatment duration is until disease progression verified by a scan subsequent to the 
initial documentation of PD, unacceptable toxicity, or any criterion for withdrawal from the trial 
occurs (see Section 6.3). Before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_56220], progressive disease should be confirmed 
by [CONTACT_9661] 4 to 6 weeks (preferably 6 weeks, but not later) after progression has been diagnosed 
according to RECIST 1.1 [44, 45]. If progression is based on the occurrence of a new lesion in an 
area not scanned at Baseline, a further on-study scan [ADDRESS_384224] 1.1 at any time if:
• There are no new or concerning symptoms.
• There is no decrease in ECOG PS.
63
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.2025
• The Investigator does not consider it necessary to administer a salvage therapy. 
The treatment should be stopped immediately, if the subject does not tolerate M7824 or if 
therapeutic failure occurs, which requires urgent treatment with an additional drug or results in 
clinically significant progression / deterioration. 
Tumor responses to treatment will be assigned based on the evaluation of the response of target, 
non-target, and new lesions according to RECIST 1.1 (all measurements should be recorded in 
metric notation).
• To assess objective response, the tumor burden at baseline will be estimated and used for 
comparison with subsequent measurements. At baseline, tumor lesions will be categorized in target 
and non-target lesions according to RECIST 1.1.
Results for these evaluations will be recorded with as much specificity as possible so that pre  and 
post-treatment results will provide the best opportunity for evaluating tumor response. 
Any CR or PR should be confirmed according to RECIST 1.1. In the case of a PR or CR, a 
confirmatory CT or MRI scan should be done no sooner than 4 weeks (preferably at the scheduled 
6-week interval). 
The Investigator may perform scans in addition to a scheduled trial scan for medical reasons or if 
the Investigator suspects PD.
As an exploratory endpoint antitumor activity will also be evaluated according to iRECIST
Using iRECIST criteria the following will be incorporated into assessment:
1. An increase in the sum of target lesions of more than 20%, unequivocal increase in non-
target lesions or new lesions result in iUPD (unconfirmed progressive disease); iUPD can 
be assigned multiple times as long as iCPD (confirmed progressive disease) is not confirmed 
at the next assessment.
2. Progression is confirmed in the target lesion category if the next imaging assessment after 
iUPD (4–8 weeks later) confirms a further increase in sum of measures of target disease 
from iUPD, with an increase of at least 5 mm. Progression is confirmed in the non-target 
lesion category if subsequent imaging, done 4–8 weeks after iUPD, shows a further 
unequivocal increase in non-target lesions. Progression is confirmed in the new lesions 
category if at next assessment additional new lesions appear or an increase in size of 
previously seen new lesions is seen (≥5 mm for sum of new lesion target).
3. However, the criteria for iCPD (after iUPD) are not considered to have been met if 
complete response, partial response, or stable disease criteria (compared with baseline and 
as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1) are met at the next assessment after iUPD. The status is reset 
(unlike RECIST 1.1, in which any progression precludes later complete response, partial 
response, or stable disease). iCR, iPR, or iSD should then be assigned; and if no change is 
detected, then the timepoint response is iUPD.
6.3.[ADDRESS_384225] 1.1
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
64
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.2025
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest 
on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute 
increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered 
progressions).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Note: If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
participant to be considered in complete clinical response.
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression 
of existing non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion 
status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase.
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_62484], and the progression status should be confirmed at 
a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started). The participant's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Response
Duration of overall response: The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the 
criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the 
treatment started, including the baseline measurements. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-Free Survival
PFS is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of progression or death, 
whichever occurs first.

with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING PLAN
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure: 
•that the rights of the participants are protected; 
•that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and 
73
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.2025
•the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained. 
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) Good 
Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable regulatory 
requirements.
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non-compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates. 
OSRO SROS Monitoring visits and related activities will be conducted throughout the life cycle 
of each protocol. The first activity is before the study starts to conduct a Site Assessment Visit 
(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close-Out Visit (COV).
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will occur at the study site. 
Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action items or 
follow-up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations. Monitoring reports 
will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, coordinating 
center (if applicable) and the Sponsor regulatory file.
The site Monitor will inform the study team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. 
If unresolved, the Monitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR Protocol 
Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting to the Sponsor and as applicable per 
institutional and IRB guidance.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
10.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESIS
The primary objectives of this trial are to determine the objective response rate of combination 
immunotherapy in two separate arms evaluating triple or quadruple therapy in participants with 
checkpoint naïve MSS small bowel or colorectal cancer. A secondary hypothesis (objective) will 
be to obtain preliminary data on duration of response, PFS, OS and ratio of participants that are 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_311789]. An 
exploratory hypothesis (objective) will be to evaluate exploratory immunologic studies to 
understand and improve the administered treatment. 
10.[ADDRESS_384239] safe dose level (or MTD) 
74
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.[ADDRESS_384240] stage of the phase II evaluation of the quadruple therapy (Arm 2B) as 
described below. 
In participants with microsatellite stable small bowel or colon cancer, the clinical response rate to 
current single agent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_311790] (<5%). It would be desirable if by [CONTACT_2329] a combination 
of multiple agents, the response rate would be improved. To establish the efficacy of each of the 
proposed combinations (triple or quadruple therapy), the primary objective would be to determine 
if the proposed combination would rule out a 10% response rate and result in a response rate 
consistent with 40%. As such, participants on each arm (Arm 1 or 2B) will be treated in a trial 
conducted using a Simon optimal two-stage phase II trial design (Simon R, Controlled Clinical 
Trials 10:1-10, 1989) to rule out an unacceptably low PR+CR rate of 10% (p0=0.10) in favor of 
an improved response rate of 40% (p1=0.40). With alpha=0.05 (probability of accepting a poor 
treatment=0.05) and beta = 0.10 (probability of rejecting a good treatment=0.10), the first stage 
for each arm will enroll [ADDRESS_384241] been treated on that arm. As it may take up to several months to 
determine if a participant has experienced a response, a temporary pause in the accrual may be 
necessary to ensure that enrollment to the second stage is warranted. If there are 2 to 4 participants 
with a response out of 20 participants in a given arm, this would be an uninterestingly low response 
rate. If there were 5 or more of 20 (25.0%) who experienced a response, this would be sufficiently 
interesting to warrant further study in later trials in this disease type. Under the null hypothesis 
(10% response rate), the probability of early termination is 77.5%.
It is anticipated that 2-3 participants per month may enroll onto this trial. Thus, it is expected that 
the trial can enroll up to 46 evaluable participants (up to 12 for safety evaluation during dose 
escalation in Arm 2A, 40 for primary efficacy analyses in Arm 1 and Arm 2B together, minus 6 
included from the dose escalation Arm 2A) in approximately two years. To allow for a small 
number of screen failures and participants who will be inevaluable for the primary objective 
analysis (e.g., checkpoint refractory), the accrual ceiling will be set at [ADDRESS_384242] had their disease re-evaluated will be 
considered evaluable for response. (Note: Participants who discontinue treatment before the first 
scan due to treatment related toxicity or exhibit objective disease progression prior to first 
restaging will also be considered evaluable.)

Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial
Version Date: 03.25.[ADDRESS_384243] 6 participants on Arm 1 or during the dose escalation for NHS-IL12 
(Arm 2A), the participants will be evaluated with respect to the grades and types of toxicities 
obtained. The results will be presented descriptively and tabled if appropriate.
10.4.[ADDRESS_384244] Version 1.1 will be evaluated per arm (Arm 1 and 2B). If anti-tumor 
responses are observed, the 95% confidence interval of the response rate will be evaluated.  
It is possible that the response rates observed with combination immunotherapy will be less in 
participants whom have previously received checkpoint therapy and not be truly reflective of a 
population of participants whom have not had prior checkpoint therapy. While checkpoint 
experienced participants will not be excluded from enrollment, the primary efficacy analyses will 
be limited to checkpoint naïve participants with MSS colon cancer and efficacy analyses in the 
checkpoint refractory. 
10.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints
Data will be obtained on duration of response, PFS, OS and ratio of participants that are 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_311791].
[IP_ADDRESS] Duration of Response
The duration of overall response will be evaluated by [CONTACT_311831] a PR or greater in Arm 1 
and Arm 2B. The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that PD is objectively documented 
and is evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method .
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-Free Survival
PFS will be evaluated by [CONTACT_311832]-Meier methods. PFS will be defined as the time from 
the date of first treatment to the date of disease progression or death (any cause) whichever occurs 
first. Subjects who do not have disease progression or have not died at the end of follow up will 
be censored at the last known date the subject was progression free.
[IP_ADDRESS] Objective Response
Objective response is a complete or partial radiographic response as defined by [CONTACT_393] 1.1 
(Section 6.3.5).
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival
OS will be evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. OS will be defined as the time from the date 
of first treatment to the date of death (any cause). Subjects who are alive at the end of follow up 
will be censored at the last known date alive.
10.4.4 Safety Analyses
Safety endpoints will be analyzed as summary statistics during treatment and/or as change scores 
from baseline assessments.  AEs will be coded as defined in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA). All AEs will be recorded and tabulated following each treatment. AEs will 
76
Abbreviated Title: QuICC Trial

be recorded by [CONTACT_926], frequency, and relationship to the study intervention and will be presented 
by [CONTACT_1196] (SOC) designations and preferred term groupi[INVESTIGATOR_14839]. Information on each 
AE will include start date, stop date, severity, relationship, expectedness, outcome, and duration. 
Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation from the study intervention and serious 
treatment-emergent AEs will be presented either in a Table or a Listing. 
In addition, overall safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_311833] 5 within dose cohorts and for the overall study population in 
terms of treatment-emergent AEs, SAEs, and clinically significant changes in safety laboratory 
tests, physical examinations, ECGs, and vital signs. 
10.4.5 Baseline Descriptive Statistics
Baseline Characteristics will be described. 
10.4.6 Planned Interim Analyses
Interim assessment of efficacy will be made according to the Simon two stage Phase II designs of 
each arm described.
10.4.7 Tabulation of Individual Participant Data
Individual responses in a cohort may be depi[INVESTIGATOR_311792] a larger group using a waterfall plot or 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_311793]. 
10.4.8 Exploratory Analyses
The following are the planned exploratory objectives and endpoints:
To conduct exploratory immunologic studies to understand and improve the administered 
treatment, including:
•peripheral immune subset analysis before and on treatment;
•soluble factors circulation (e.g., sCD27 and sCD40 ligand) before and on treatment;
•tumor tissue PD-L1 expression and immune infiltration before and after treatment.
Where feasible, exploratory immune analyses will be conducted to evaluate anti-tumor immune 
responses. Immune response will be assessed among all subjects treated in each phase II cohort. 
The magnitude of immune responses will be described. A subject will be considered evaluable for 
immune response if they receive at least one dose of treatment. The percentage of subjects with a 
positive immune response will be evaluated separately by [INVESTIGATOR_216]. For flow cytometry analyses on 
PBMC samples, Student t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate will be performed on 
percentages of TNF- and/or IFN- expressing cells among the different cohorts to determine any 
significant differences in cell populations between arms For antigen specific T cell responses, a 
positive immune response is defined by [CONTACT_311834] a flow 
cytometric readout (cytokine production or CD107 expression). Antigen-specific peptide 
challenge assays require a readout of >250 reactive T-cells/million cells above the background 
[46]. In general, evaluations of soluble factors and tumor tissue immune infiltration will be 
compared before vs. after treatment using appropriate paired tests. Any statistical analyses 
performed on these exploratory endpoints will be done without formal adjustment for multiple 
comparisons but in the context of the number of tests performed [46].

12.4 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT
12.4.[ADDRESS_384248] of procedures and study interventions that are 
associated with risk.
[IP_ADDRESS] Study Drug Risks 
Risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed in  
Sections 14.1.2, 14.2.2, 14.3.[ADDRESS_384249] that an unexpectedly rapid 
progression of disease occurs in some patients receiving immunotherapy such as immune 
checkpoint inhibitors. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Optional Biopsies
All care will be taken to minimize risks that may be incurred by [CONTACT_62564]. However, there 
are procedure-related risks (such as bleeding, infection and visceral injury) that will be explained 
fully during informed consent.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of Exposure to Ionizing Radiation
This research study involves: [ADDRESS_384250] 
guided biopsies in this study will expose the research participant to 31.3 years’ worth of 
background radiation. This level of exposure results in an increased risk of cancer. 
[IP_ADDRESS] CT Scan Risk 
CT scans create low levels of radiation, which has a small potential to cause cancer and other 
defects. However, the risk associated with scan is small. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks Due to Contrast Agents for CT 
Contrast agents can cause allergic reactions and kidney damage. Allergic reactions can include 
mild itching associated with hives but can also result in a serious life-threatening emergency from 
difficulty breathing. If this occurs, it is treatable. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of MRI
People are at risk for injury from the  MRI magnet if they have some kinds of metal in their body. 
People with fear of confined spaces may become anxious during an MRI. Those with back 
problems may have back pain or discomfort from lying in the scanner.  The noise from the scanner 
is loud enough to damage hearing, especially in people who already have hearing loss. 
There are no known long-term risks of MRI scans.

Version Date: 03.25.2025
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Gadolinium Enhanced MRI
The gadolinium infusion may cause mild symptoms such as coldness in the arm during the 
injection, a metallic taste, headache, and nausea. There are risks of an IV catheter include bleeding, 
infection, or inflammation of the skin and vein with pain and swelling.  
Procedure-related risks from MRI and gadolinium enhanced MRI will be explained fully during 
informed consent.
[IP_ADDRESS] Risks of Blood Collection
Risks of blood draws include pain and bruising in the area where the needle is placed, 
lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting. When large amounts of blood are collected, low red blood 
cell count (anemia) can develop. 
The amount of blood that may be drawn from adult participants for research purposes shall not 
exceed 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any eight-week period. Specific volumes 
are also listed in table in Section 5.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Risks
Risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed in the

prophylax against infusions reactions. The following additionally significant immune-mediated 
adverse reactions have occurred in less than 1% of 1738 participants treated with BAVENCIO: 
myocarditis with fatal cases, myositis, psoriasis, arthritis, exfoliative dermatitis, erythema 
multiforme, pemphigoid, hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_297], uveitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and systemic 
inflammatory response. The above irAEs are all considered an anticipated risk of treatment with 
M7824 and thus will not be considered DLTs.
In a phase 1, open-label 3+3 dose-escalation study of M7824 in 16 participants, 3 participants 
experienced grade 3 drug-related adverse events including skin infection secondary to grade 2 
bullous pemphigoid, lipase increased, and colitis with associated anemia. There were no grade 4 –

occurred in approximately 3-5% of participants, and are well managed with surgical excision. 
These lesions have not been a criterion for treatment discontinuation, but thus far have all 
spontaneously regressed following treatment discontinuation.
In addition, after discussion among NCI investigators on multiple protocols using M7824, multiple 
bleeding events ranging from low grade gingival bleeding and epi[INVESTIGATOR_148332], GI bleeding and hematuria have been observed. Some of these events can be attributed 
to bleeding events related to cancer directly and others bleeding events can be attributed to colitis 
or cystitis which is a known toxicity of anti-PD-L1 agents including M7824. However, there 
remains the possibility that M7824 may increase the overall risk of bleeding in ways that may not 
be directly related to direct tumor bleeding or inflammatory bleeding events described with 
checkpoint inhibitors like M7824. It is hypothesized that this possible increased bleeding risk may 
be due to TGF beta inhibition which has an effect on angiogenesis; bleeding has also been observed 
in participants receiving M7824 and may be drug-related (e.g., gum bleeding, nose bleeds, 
coughing up blood, blood in their urine, or blood in the stool). Accordingly, participants will be 
notified of the same possible risk in the informed consent document for this study (e.g., gum 
bleeding, nose bleeds, coughing up blood, blood in their urine, or blood in the stool).

14.3.3 Formulation and Preparation 
N-803 is a soluble complex consisting of two protein subunits of a human IL-15 variant associated 
with high affinity to a dimeric human IL-15 receptor α (IL-15Rα) sushi domain/human IgG1 Fc 
fusion protein. The IL-15 variant is a 114 aa polypeptide comprising the mature human IL-15 
cytokine sequence with an Asn to Asp substitution at position 72 of helix C (N72D). The human 
IL-15Rα sushi domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein comprises the sushi domain of the human 
IL-15 receptor α subunit (IL-15Rα) (aa 1-65 of the mature human IL-15Rα protein) linked with 
the human IgG1 CH2-CH3 region containing the Fc domain (232 amino acids). Aside from the 
N72D substitution, all of the protein sequences are human. Based on the amino acid sequence of 
the subunits, calculated molecular weight of complex comprising two IL-15N72D polypeptides 
and a disulfide linked homodimeric IL-15RαSu/IgG1 Fc protein is 92.4 kilodaltons (kDa). Each 
IL-15N72D polypeptide has a calculated molecular weight of approximately 12.8 kDa and the IL-
15RαSu/IgG1 Fc fusion protein has a calculated molecular weight of approximately 33.4 kDa. 
Both the IL-15N72D and IL-15RαSu/IgG1 Fc proteins are glycosylated resulting in an apparent 
molecular weight of N-803 as approximately 113 kDa by [CONTACT_115571]. The 
isoelectric point (pI) determined for N-803 ranges from approximately 5.5 to 6.5. Thus, the fusion 
protein is negatively charged at pH 7. The calculated molar extinction coefficient at A280 for N-
803 is 116,540 M-1, or 1.26 OD280 for a 1 mg/mL solution of N-803, or one OD280 is equivalent 
to 0.79 mg/mL solution of N-803. 
The biological drug product, N-803, is formulated in a phosphate buffered saline solution. The 
drug substance is produced by a recombinant mammalian cell line and is manufactured using 
protein-free media.
N-803 is supplied at a concentration of 2 mg/mL and lot FG-16-0182-2 is administered undiluted. 
For lots other than FG-16-0182-2, the manufacturer will provide additional preparation 
instructions. 
14.3.4 Stability and Storage 
Study medication is provided in a 2mL vial containing 0.6 mL of N-803 at a concentration of 2 
mg/mL. Study medication must be maintained at a temperature between 2℃ and 8℃. The duration 
of time during which the product remains stable at room temperature will be obtained from Altor.

14.4.2 Toxicity 
Subjects (n=59) were treated subcutaneously with NHS-IL12 in a single ascending dose cohort 
followed by a multiple ascending dose cohort (n=37 with every 4-week dosing). The primary 
objective of this trial was to determine MTD as defined by [CONTACT_311838]. None of the 
subjects treated with single or multiple doses up to 12.0 µg/kg experienced a DLT. At 16.8 µg/kg, 
1/6 subjects had a DLT (grade 3 increase in alanine transaminase [ALT]). At 21.8 µg/kg, 2/6 
subjects had a DLT (grade 3 increase in aspartate transaminase [AST] and ALT; grade 3 increase 
in lipase without clinical signs of pancreatitis). MTD was 16.8 µg/kg. The most frequently 
observed treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was decreased lymphocyte count (27/59 
subjects; 45.8%). Other TRAEs included decreased white blood cells (WBCs) (24/59; 40.7%), 
fever and elevated AST (21 each; 35.6%), elevated ALT (20; 3.9%), and anemia and flu-like 
symptoms (18 each; 30.5%) (Tab. Among the cohort receiving 16.8 µg/kg, the most frequently 
reported TRAEs were elevated AST (75%), decreased WBCs and elevated ALT (68.8% each), 
and decreased lymphocyte count and fever (62.5% each). At least one grade ≥ 3 TRAE was seen 
in 12/59 subjects (20.3%). These included decreased lymphocyte count (5; 8.5%), decreased 
neutrophil count (4; 6.8%), elevated ALT (3; 5.1%), decreased WBCs (2; 3.4%), and hypokalemia, 
hyperhidrosis, elevated alkaline phosphatase, AST, and lipase (1 each; 1.7%). All grade ≥ 3 
TRAEs were transient; only hyperhidrosis was symptomatic. One grade 4 TRAE was observed 
(asymptomatic decreased lymphocyte count); no grade 5 TRAE was observed.

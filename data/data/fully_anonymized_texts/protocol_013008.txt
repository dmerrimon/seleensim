Study Phase:  
2 
Primary Objective(s) : 
In this Phase 2 study, the primary objectives are to evaluate:  
• The ocular hypotensive efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution relative to its placebo over a 
28-day period 
• The ocular and systemic safety of netarsudil ophthalmic s olution relative to its placebo over a 
28-day period 
Secondary Objective(s): 
None.  
Study Design:  
This will be a 28 -day, double -masked, randomized, multicenter, placebo -controlled, parallel group efficacy and 
safety trial evaluating reduction of elevated i ntraocular pressure (IOP) with n etarsudil ophthalmic solution. The  
purpose of this s tudy is to assess the efficacy and saf ety of netarsudil ophthalmic solution  (0.02% and 0.04% ) 
compared to its placebo in Japanese or Japanese- American subjects that are at  least 18 years of age with 
open -angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).  
All investigational products will be dosed in both eyes (OU) once daily (QD) in the evening (PM). Subjects 
eligible to be enrolled in this study will be those of Japanese ethnicity within the second generation, with a 
diagnosis of either OAG or OHT that are on treatment with a topi[INVESTIGATOR_748909]. 
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled in this study. Subjects who agree to participate in this study and are enrolled will attend a total of 6 study visits: a Screening Visit, Qualification Visit #1, Qualification Visit 
#2/Day 1 (baseline), Week 1 (Day 8), Week 2 (Day 15), and Week 4 (Day 29).  
Subjects currently using ocular hypotensive medications  will be required to washout of their pre -study ocular 
hypotensive medication for a prescribed period (i.e., [ADDRESS_1024151] 4 weeks, depending on the medication) 
prior to attending Qualification Visit #1. Subjects eligible to be enrolled in this study must meet all inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at each of the Screening Vis it and Qualification Visits #1 and #2. 
Subjects will receive a baseline eye examination including IOP measurements at the Screening Visit and Qualification Visits #1 and #2 and, if deemed eligible, will be enrolled at Qualification Visit #2 and assigned to  
placebo or 1 of 2 investigational products in a 1:1:[ADDRESS_1024152] in both eyes QD in the evening (between

Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy that causes characteristic loss of visual fields and 
can eventually lead to blindness.  A major  risk factor for glaucomatous visual field loss is 
elevated intraocular pressure ( AGIS 2000 ).  
The need for improved e fficacy of glaucoma medications is supported by [CONTACT_748926].  Studies such as the Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial ( Heijl 2002), the Ocular 
Hypertension Treatment Study ( Kass 2002; Kass 2010), and the Collaborative Normal 
Tension Glaucoma Study Group ( Collaborative Normal-Tension Glaucoma Study Group 
1998) support the general conclusion that every millimeter of reduction in intraocular pressure ( IOP) is significant for delaying disease progression.  This conclusion holds true not 
only for high risk ocular hypertensive and glaucoma subjects with elevated IOPs but also for glaucoma subjects with IOPs in the normal range.  Thus, the goal for treating subjects should be to lower IOP to the point that it prevents further damage to the optic nerve and ac hieve 
this without sacrificing safety or convenience.   
Inhibitors of Rho kinase (ROCK) have emerged as a new class of IOP-lowering agents and 
are currently being tested in the clinic ( Chen 2011; Kopczynski 2014).  Netarsudil mesylate 
(AR-[ZIP_CODE]) is a novel Rho kinase and norepi[INVESTIGATOR_748911], Inc. for topi[INVESTIGATOR_386058].  In both rabbit and monkey studies, netarsudil produces large reductions in IOP with a longer duration of action 
than reported for previously characterized Rho kinase inhibitors.  Netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution has been shown to provide significant IOP lowering when dosed once- daily (QD) in 
the evening (Clinical Study Reports  AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS202, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, 
AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS302, and  AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS304), and reduces IOP potentially through several 
mechanisms: increasing trabecular outflow ( Clinical Study Report AR-[ZIP_CODE]- CS102; 
Wang  2015) , decreasing aqueous humor production ( Clinical Study Report 
AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS102; Wang 2015), and reducing epi[INVESTIGATOR_76154] ( Clinical Study 
Report AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS102; Kiel 2015).  The ability to reduce aqueous production may be 
related to netarsudil in vitro  inhibitory activity against monoamine transporters, including the 
norepi[INVESTIGATOR_748912]. 
The present study is a Phase 2 efficacy and safety study comparing netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution 0.02% and 0.04% to its placebo administered QD over the course of 28 days. This study will run concurrently with a Phase 1 ocular and systemi c safety study comparing 
netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% and 0.04% to its placebo after a single dose and daily QD dosing over a 7- day period (Protocol  AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS104). Both studies will recruit 
subjects with Japanese ethnicity within the second gener ation in the US.

    1.2 Findings from Non- clinical and Clinical Studies  
Non-clinical 
Proof of concept for n etarsudil in lowering IOP was established in primary pharmacology 
studies in 2 species, rabbits and monkeys.  Safety pharmacology (central nervous system, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , and cardiovascular) of n etarsudil was investigated in rats and dogs. 
Pharmacokinetics/bio distribution of netarsudil was assessed after systemic and ocular 
administration of netarsudil . Ocular toxicity was investigated in studies up to [ADDRESS_1024173] range of genotoxicity tests. 
Clinical  
The clinical development of netarsudil ophthalmic solution includes pharmacokinetics, 
tolerability , and dose-response investigations. The assessment of the ocular and systemic 
safety  of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% in two Phase 1 clinical studies  (Clinical Study 
Reports  AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS101 and AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS102) has been completed.  Results from a 
previous Phase 2 study (Clinical Study Report AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS201) investigating a range of 
netarsudil concentrations (0.01%, 0.02%, and  0.04%) were used to select the appropriate 
concentration s of netarsudil ophthalmic solution  to be tested in the present study (0.02% and 
0.04%). Three well -controlled Phase 3 clinical studies  (Clinical Study Repo rts 
AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS302, and AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS304) evaluating the safety and 
efficacy netarsudil ophthalmic solution 0.02% have been completed.  
Detailed information on nonclinical and clinical studies completed with netarsudil 
ophthalmic solution is provided in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
1.3 Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects  
As no other compounds of this class are approved, and only early stage clinical experience is  
available, the risks and benefits are not well understood at this time.  Given the 
pharmacology of this class of agents and the results of previous Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 clinical studies by [CONTACT_1034] (Clinical Study Reports AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS101, 
AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS102, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS201, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS202, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, and 
AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS302, and AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS304) , it is expected that  transient hyperemia of the 
conjunctiva will be observed.  The reader should refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more detailed information on potential risks due to use of netarsudil ophthalmic solution .   
The majo r potential benefit from exposure to netarsudil ophthalmic solution is reduction in 
IOP in subjects with open angle glaucoma ( OAG ) or ocular hypertension ( OHT ).  A 
long- term benefit of reduced IOP could be slowing of disease progression and preservation 
of vision in subjects when measured over periods of months to years

3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Control Group 
In order to further evaluate the hypotensive efficacy of netarsudil ophthalmic solution 
relative to its placebo  in subjects with OAG or OHT  and to generate additional safety data for 
netarsudil , a double-masked, parallel group, 3- arm active- and  placebo -controlled study 
design was selected.  
As the intended route of administration for netarsudil ophthalmic solution is topi[INVESTIGATOR_31439], this is the route to be used in this study. The dosage regimen selected for this study is based 
on a previously completed Phase 2 study ( AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS202) and 3 completed Phase 3 
studies ( AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS302, and AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS304) .  
Efficacy and safety resu lts with netarsudil ophthalmic solution to date have been generated in 
a mostly non-Japanese population.  In order to ensure that similar results are observed in Japanese subjects, this study is being conducted in subjects of Japanese ethnicity.

    5. STUDY TREATMENTS  
5.1 Description of Treatments  
5.1.1 Study Drug  
Netarsudil  mesylate (AR -[ZIP_CODE]) Ophthalmic Solution  is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous 
solution containing netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%), boric acid, mannitol, w ater for injection, 
and preserved with benzalkonium chloride .   
   
5.1.[ADDRESS_1024183] acebo  is a sterile, isotonic, buffered aqueous solution 
containing boric acid, mannitol, w ater for injection, and preserved with benzalkonium 
chloride .  
5.2 Treatments Administered  
Subjects will be randomized to receive IP netarsudil ophthalmic solution  (0.02% or 0.04% ) 
or its placebo  administered OU.  Subjects will instill 1 drop into each eye  QD in the evening 
between 20:00 and 22:00 hours. IP doses will be administered by [CONTACT_174897].  For 
subjects deemed unable to self -administer the doses, a guardian or alternative caregiver  will 
be asked to administer the medication. All subjects will administer study treatment for 
approximately 28 days . 
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient 
The study drug doses and treatment period selected for this study are based on  one Phase 1 
study (AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS101)  and the positive outcomes seen for netarsudil in  2 previously 
completed Phase 2 studies ( AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS201 and  AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS202) and 3 completed Phase 
3 studies ( AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS302, and AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS304). Each dose is being 
administered QD OU in the evening (between 20:00 and 22:00 hours) in this study , since this 
dosing regimen was found to provide good efficacy and tolerability in the previous clinical studies.   
5.[ADDRESS_1024184] of the study. Subjects will be 
randomized using IWRS  in a 1:1:1  ratio to receive netarsudil ophthalmic solution (0.02% or 
0.04% ) or its placebo  and will stratify subjects by [CONTACT_3725] . 
5.5 Masking  
Treatment assignments will be masked to the Investigator, the clinical study team ( Sponsor, 
personnel involved in day to day study management, Monitors, Data Managers, and

    Statisticians), and the subjects for the duration of the study. Only in case of medical 
emergency or occurrence of AEs that warrant unmasking in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], will the treatment assignment(s) be unmasked and made available to the Investigator and the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee. Individual unmasking by [CONTACT_748928]. In the absence of medical 
need, the randomization code will not be available to the above personnel until after the study is completed and the database is unlocked.  
If the Investigator feels it is necessary to unmask a subject’s treatment assignment after an 
emergency situation, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_748929]. After consultation with the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee, a d ecision will 
be made as to whether or not the treatment should be unmasked. The treatment assignment will be revealed on a subject -by-subject basis, thus leaving the masking on the remaining 
subjects.  
If there is an emergency situation in which treatment of an AE requires immediate 
unmasking, and the Investigator is unable to contact [CONTACT_671600], the Investigator may unmask the treatment. The Investigator will perform the 
unmasking through the IWRS or other randomization system. In the case of such unmasking 
in an emergency situation, the Investigator should contact [CONTACT_748930], recording the date, time, and reason for unmasking the study drug treatment in the source documentation.   
5.6 Concomitant Therapy  
As noted in Section 5.7.1, subjects using ocular hypotensive medications at screening are 
required to undergo a washout of their current ocular hypotensive medications.  Intermittent 
use of over-the- counter (OTC) artificial tear lubricant products is acceptable, with a 
minimum of 10 minutes between OTC products and study medication.  However, concurrent therapy with any form of ocular hypotensive medications (prescription or OTC) is not allowed during the study. 
Disallowed  ocular medications include: 
• Miotics  
• Epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]- related  compounds 
• Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (ocular or systemic) 
• α-adrenoceptor agonists 
• β- adrenoceptor anta gonists 
• Muscarinic agonists (e.g.,  pi[INVESTIGATOR_1227])

    • Prostaglandin analogues  
• Any corticosteroid containing ocular or systemic drug is disallowed during the study 
regardless of route of administration  
Systemic therapy with agents other than corticosteroids that could have an effect on IOP is to 
be consistent in dose, regimen and agent within the [ADDRESS_1024185] them in their eye(s) until 30 minutes after instillation.  
Use of all medications should be documented on the appropriate case report form ( CRF ).  
Investigators are encouraged to contact [CONTACT_1034]/Sponsor representative for any questions regarding allowed medications. Judgment of continued study participation by [CONTACT_423], and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis will be made by [CONTACT_1034]. 
All medications which the subject has taken within 30 days prior to screening and duri ng the 
study will be recorded in the CRF. The name [CONTACT_18467], dose, route of administration, 
duration of treatment and indication will be recorded for each medication. For combination products (e.g., Contac
®), the brand name [CONTACT_60296].  For non-combination products, the 
generic name [CONTACT_245533]. The use of routine ophthalmic diagnostic pharmaceutical agents (e.g., fluorescein and local anesthetic) will be allowed, and individual documentation not required. Any change in dosing parameters should also be recorded in the CRF. 
5.7 Restrictions

6.9 Adverse Events Assessments  
6.9.1 Performing Adverse Event (AE) Assessments  
Qualified study staff responsible for assessing adverse events (AEs) will be lis ted on the 
Delegation of Responsibilities Log.  This includes assessment of AE severity and 
relationship to study medication.  A dverse event  information may be volunteered by [CONTACT_748933]-leading questions. 
All AE s occurring during the study, regardless of the assumption of causal relationship, must 
be documented on the respective CRF.  Adverse events should be documented from the time 
the subject receives the first dose of study medication until [ADDRESS_1024196] be 
followed-up and provided appropriate medical care until the event has resolved or stabilized.  
Documentation of AEs /adverse reactions includes start date and stop date, severity, action(s) 
taken, seriousness and outcome. 
6.9.2 Adverse Event Definition  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section: 
• Adverse event . Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
• Life-threatening AE or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction (SAR). An AE  or SAR  
is considered “life-threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an AE or SAR  that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ZIP_CODE] -CS205  Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
 
 
   
Confidential  Page 32 of 85  
    • Serious adverse event (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR) . An AE or 
SAR  is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life -threatening adverse event, subject 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or sig nificant 
incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect.  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in subject hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
• Suspected adverse reaction (SAR) means any AE for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the AE .  For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE .  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty 
about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
• Unexpected AE or unexpected SAR.  An AE or SAR  is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is 
not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at th e specificity or severity that 
has been observed.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_14214]) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or SARs  that are ment ioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
Note: Any medical condition present prior to administration of the masked study medication which remains unchanged or improved should not be recorded as an AE at subsequent visits. 
Note: If an event occurs during the washout period (prior to subject enrollment and the commencement of study medication), it should be recorded as part of the Medical History and not as an AE .  As noted in Section 7.3.1, any change in their Visit 1 (Screening) health 
status prior to enrollment should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF . 
Note: In the present study, Investigators are asked to use the verbatim term “conjunctival hyperemia” on the study AE form to describe observations of conjunctival redness if the ocular redness observation is increased from Visit 1 ( Screening ) observations and clinically 
meaningful.  Investigators are also asked to note all observations of conjunctival hyperemia on the biomicroscopy CRF  as well as on the study AE form.

    6.9.4 Severity  
Severity of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort or the 
degree of intensity of an AE as determined by [CONTACT_19577]/her by [CONTACT_1560].  The assessment of severity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or 
seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale: 
• 1 = Mild:  present and noticeable, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily 
activities  
• 2 = Moderate:  bothersome, discomfort sufficient to possibly reduce or affect normal 
daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
A change in severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous severity and a 
new start and stop date for the new severity.  For example, a change in severity may go from mild to severe or from severe to moderate.  In either case, the start and stop dates should be recorded.   
Please note: a severe AE is not the same as a serious AE.  Seriousness of an AE (NOT severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see Section 6.9.8 for further information on serious AEs [S AEs]). 
6.9.5 Relationship  
The study medication relationship for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by [CONTACT_60265]:  
• Not Related :  The event is clearly related to other factors such as subject’s clinical 
condition; therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease or therapy administered to the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the product. 
• Unlikely Related : The event is most probably caused by [CONTACT_219819]’s underlying condition, therapeutic intervention, or concomitant therapy; or the delay between administration and the onset of the AE is incompatible with a causal 
relationship. Therefore, there is not a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by [CONTACT_7860].  
• Possibly Related :  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication, but could have been produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject.  
• Related :  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study 
medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1024198]’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occurs immediately following study medication administration, or improves on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_219788], or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
6.9.[ADDRESS_1024199] frequently reported AE for netarsudil ophthalmic solution  in two Phase 2 and three  
Phase 3 studies ( Clinical Study Reports  AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS201, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS202, 
AR-[ZIP_CODE]-CS301, AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS302, and AR -[ZIP_CODE]-CS304) has been conjunctival 
hyperemia.  Other AEs seen in greater frequency with netarsudil than in active control 
treatment arms in these studies include instillation site erythema or pain, eyelid erythema, conjunctival hemorrhage, conjunctival vascular disorder, blurred vision, corneal deposits, eye irritation, increased lacrimation, and foreign body sensation. 
An AE or SAR  is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure or 
is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  “Unexpected,” as used in 
this definition, also refers to AEs  or SARs  that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure 
as occurring with this class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of netarsudil, and are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the IP.  The AEs that are both unexpected and serious should be reported in an expedited fashion to the Sponsor (see Section  6.9.8 for further details).  
6.9.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events 
Clinical laboratory values (other than pregnancy test results) that are noted as abnormal and clinically significant at study exit and that are changes from Visit 1 (Screening) values will be documented as AEs. 
6.9.[ADDRESS_1024200] immediately report any SAE or SSAR (see Section  6.9.2 for 
definitions) to the Sponsor or Sponsor representative (contact [CONTACT_31307]) , whether or 
not the SAE or SSAR is considered drug-related, including those listed in the protocol or 
Investigator’s Brochure.  The Investigator report must include an assessment of whether 
there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  The Investigator must report any SAE or SSAR that occurs during the study for a subject or any SAE or SSAR that occurs within 4  weeks (i.e. , 30 days) after the last administration of study medication . Study 
endpoints that are SAEs  (e.g., all-cause mortality)  must be reported in accordance with 
Section 6.9.2 of the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship 
between the drug and the event ( e.g., death from anaphylaxis).  In that case, the Investigator 
must immediately report the event to the Sponsor or Sponsor representative.  In case of 
incomplete information, the Investigator must provide follow-up information as soon as possible, again using the SAE report form.

representative for any questions regarding allowed medications.  Judgment of continued study participation by [CONTACT_423], and inclusion of this subject’s subsequent visits in the 
safety and efficacy analysis will be made by [CONTACT_1034].  
6.[ADDRESS_1024202] Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)  
Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) will be taken at visits as a measure of ocular function and will be measured at screening and frequently throughout the study. Visual acuity will be measured using ETDRS charts or their equivalents.  Accepted charts are those designed according to the principles described by [CONTACT_386103] ( Ferris 1982 ) and supported by 
[CONTACT_386104] ( Ferris 1996).  
See Appendix 2 for details of the procedures to be followed when determining BCVA. 
6.12 Biomicroscopy  
Biomicroscopic examination of the eyelids, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, lens, iris, and pupil of both lenses will be carried out at every study visit for both eyes of subjects.  Normal or abnormal status of these ocular tissues will be graded as described in Appendix 2. 
6.13 Gonioscopy/ Pachymetry  
Gonioscopy will be used to confirm the iridocorneal angle is open and to what extent.  Eligible subjects must have an angle of 3 or 4 (Shaffer grading scale; Stamper 2009) for 
participation in the study.  Gonioscopy may be performed up to [ADDRESS_1024203] be determined as automated threshold 
perimetry (e.g., 30-2 or 24-2 Humphrey). SITA Standard is preferred, SITA fast is also 
allowed.  Visual fields must be reliable, defined as those with a) fixation losses less than or equal to 33%, b) false positives less than or equal to 33%, and c) false negatives less than or equal to 33%.  Visual fields fixation losses should not be rounded up to the next whole 
number value. The gaze track and blind spot should be turned on for all visual fields assessments in order to calculate the fixatio n losses.  See Appendix 2 for further 
information.  
6.15 Dilated Ophthalmoscopy  
A dilated funduscopic examination including evaluation of the retina, vitreous, macula, 
choroid, optic nerve, and vertical cup/disc ratio will be performed.  Se e Appendix 2 for

(Sherwood 2006). 
Each Goldmann tonometry value is read as an integer. When calculating the mean or median, it is possi ble to have a fractional value; any non- integral mean or m edian IOP number will be 
reported to one decimal place. Note:  For purposes of determining eligibility of subjects to be enrolled, any non-integral mean IOP number should not be rounded. 
IOP should be measured by [CONTACT_748934] a calibrated Goldmann applanation 
tonometer.

    7. STUDY ACTIVITIES  
The schedule of study visits and procedures is shown in Appendix 1.  
7.1 Visit 1 ( Screening ) 
This visit may occur at any time of the day.  The Investigator  or a member of his/her staff will 
interview the individual as to their qualifications for participation in the study.  
Individuals will be asked to review the informed consent, discuss issues as needed, and to 
sign the form.  A signed written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to any study specific procedu res or assessments. The ICF process will be clearly documented in 
the subject’s source. 
Significant medical and ophthalmic history including concomitant  medication use will be 
taken, and demographic measures recorded (see Section  6.2).  
The following procedures will be performed (see Appendix 2 for procedure details) :   
• Heart rate and blood pressure 
• Pregnancy test:  All fema les of childbearing potential must have a negative urine 
pregnancy test result  
• Best Corrected Visual Acuity   
• Central corneal thickness will be measured by [CONTACT_78536] (taken at screening 
or within 1 week prior to the Screening Visit) 
• Intraocular pressure (before pupil dilation):  Medicated IOP must be ≥ 15 mmHg and < 30 mmHg in both eyes at the Screening Visit (this also applies to treatment naïve 
subjects)  
• Biomicroscopy 
• Dilated ophthalmoscopy (including vertical cup-disc ratio)  
• Visual fields and  gonioscopy may be taken up to 3 months prior to randomization in both 
eyes 
• Symptomatology: Individuals will be asked “How are you feeling?” 
Blood samples will be taken for clinical chemistry  and hematology , and a urine sample will 
be taken for urinalysis (Appendix 2). The results of blood work and urinalysis should be 
reviewed after this study visit in order to determine eligibility of the subject prior to undertaking the examination at Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1).

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1024210] blood drawn and urine collected for clinical 
labs at Visit 1 (Screening), the blood and urine sample may be drawn at Visit 2 (Qualification 
Visit #1) so long as the results of the clinical labs are available  and reviewed for eligibility 
for that subject prior to Visit 3 (Qualification Visit #2). 
The Investigator will evaluate the results of these examinations for possible enrollment of the 
individual into the study. 
7.1.1 Evaluation of Eye-Drop Instillation Perform ance  
Subjects (or legally authorized representative for subjects deemed unable to administer) will 
be provided a bottle of commercially available, multi-dose, non- medicated artificial tears in a 
room with access to water and soap. Medication instiller will be asked to instill a drop of the artificial tear in each eye under the observation of a member of the Investigator’s staff.  The 
staff will observe the subject, guardian , or alternative person to assure that they instill 1 drop 
of the artificial tear into each eye, without touching the tip of the bottle to their eye or face (Stone 2009) .  The staff member may work with the individual to improve their delivery 
technique to meet this standard. If the subject (guardian or alternative person) cannot demonstra te proper delivery of the eye drop, or if staff member feels that the individual will 
be unable to do so consistently, then the subject will be excluded from further study participation.  
7.1.2 Washout 
As noted in Section 5.7.1, a washout period is required for individuals currently using ocular hypotensive medications and who meet  the other qualifications for enrollment.   
7.2 Visit 2 (Qualification Visit #1, for 08:00 hours IOP and safety measurements) 
After the washout (if needed), individuals will return to the Investigator’s office in the early morning. The subject will be questioned regarding any changes in their health or concomitant medication use.  Any change in the individual’s Visit 1 health status should be recorded on the Medical History page of the CRF (e.g., the subject has been diagnosed with cancer). 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria will be reviewed again for the qualified individual. Results of the 
clinical laboratory tests from Visit [ADDRESS_1024211] blood drawn and urine collected  for the 
clinical labs at Visit 1, the blood and urine sample may be drawn at Visit 2 (Qualification 
Visit #1) so long as the results of the clinical labs are available for that subject prior to Visit 3 
(Qualification Visit #2).  
The following procedures will be performed:

    9. PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 General Considerations  
All continuous study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] 
(as applicable) using descr iptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, 
and maximum).  All categorical study assessments will be summarized by [CONTACT_12268] (as applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.   
Hypothesis testing, unless otherwise indicated, will be performed at a 2 -sided 
0.05 significance level.  When applicable, two -sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
reported.  All p- values will be displayed to four decimal places, with p -values less than 
0.0001 presented as '<0.0001' and p-values greater than 0.9999 presented as ‘>0.9999’.  
Differences between netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) and placebo will be calculated as 
netarsudil  – placebo .   
All study data will be listed by [CONTACT_3148], subject, and time point (as applicable).   
For diurnally- adjusted IOP, baseline will refer to the time -relevant measure at Visit 3.0 
through 3.2 (e.g., IOP at 08:00 hours at Visit 3.0 will be the baseline for 08:00 hours at 
Visit 4.0, Visit 5.0, and Visit 6.0; IOP at 10:00 hours at Visit 3.1 will be the baseline for 10:00 hours at Visit 4.1, Visit 5.1, and Visit 6.1; etc.).  For all other variables, baseline is defined as the last measurement prior to the first dose of study medication. An additional definition of baseline for conjunctival hyperemia will also be  used: baseline (pre-washout) 
will be defined as the conjunctival hyperemia measure at Visit 1.  
The unit of analysis for efficacy will be the study eye.  For a subject who qualifies, the study eye will be the eye with the higher IOP at 08:[ADDRESS_1024219] the same IOP at 08:00 hours on Visit 3, then the right eye will be the study eye. 
Data collected during the observation extension visits may be summarized separately from 
the data collected during the main portion of the study. 
Statistical methods will be more fully described in separate document(s) (i.e., the Statistical 
Analysis Plan).

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1024224] has 95% power to demonstrate superiority 
of netarsudil  (0.02% or 0.04%) to placebo . 
9.3 Analysis Populations 
9.3.1 Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population will include all randomized subjects who have received at least 1 dose of 
study medication.  This population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize all efficacy variables and will summarize sub jects as randomized.  
9.3.2 Per Protocol (PP) Population  
The per protocol ( PP) population is a subset of the ITT population, which will include those 
subjects who do not have major protocol violations likely to seriously affect the primary outcome of the study as judged by a masked evaluation prior to the unmasking of the study treatment.  This population will be the secondary population for efficacy analyses and will be used to summarize a subset of efficacy variables.  If the PP and ITT populations are exactly the same, then additional efficacy analyses on the PP population will not be performed.  The PP population will summarize subjects as treated.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_1024225] 1 dose of study medication.  This population will be used to summarize safety variables and will 
summarize subjects as treated.  
9.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, gender, or disease status will be summariz ed and listed.  Medical history, history of ocular surgery and procedures, glaucoma 
history and washout period (if needed) will also be summarized and listed. 
9.5 Primary Efficacy  
9.5.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint (s) 
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the compariso n of netarsudil ophthalmic 
solution (0.02% or 0.04%) relative to its placebo  for mean diurnal IOP within a treatment 
group at Week 4 (Day29) by [CONTACT_222795]. 9.5.[ADDRESS_1024226] squares mean differences

    Additionally, secondary analyses of the primary endpoint will be completed using individual 
2-sample t -tests and 95% t-distribution CIs for each comparison netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) 
versus placebo using the ITT population. 
The primary and secondary analyses will also be completed on the secondary endpoints: 
mean diurnal IOP at Weeks [ADDRESS_1024227] -treatment time point and 
visit (08:00, 10:00, and 16:00 at the Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 Visits), mean change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP at each post -treatment visit, and mean change from diurnally 
adjusted baseline IOP at each post -treatment time point and visit.  Models adjusting for 
baseline will only be performed on the mean IOP response variable as inference is identical between this response and the change from baseline IOP response variable in such a model. 
Additionally, for the mean IOP values at each time point, mixed model repeated measures 
will be run with baseline as the covariate; treatment, visit, time point, treatment by [CONTACT_765], treatment by [CONTACT_7206], visit by [CONTACT_7206], and treatment by [CONTACT_386111]; and subject as the random effect, repeated measure.  An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within subject, between visit and time point variances.  This allows for different variances and co -variances within and between time 
points and visits.  The treatment by [CONTACT_765], treatment by [CONTACT_7206], visit by [CONTACT_7206], and treatment by [CONTACT_386112] a different rate of change in IOP in the different treatment arms among visits and  time points.  This model will be run including the 
Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 visits.   
Mean percent change from baseline in mean diurnal IOP and mean percent change from 
diurnally adjusted baseline IOP at each time point will be analyzed using two- sample  t-tests, 
between netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) and placebo, at each time point and visit, including 
two-sample t -tests and 95% t-distribution confidence intervals on the difference 
(netarsudil  - placebo).   
Mean diurnal IOP values will be constructed by [CONTACT_748940] 3 diurnal IOP measurements 
on each of Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 visits.  Mean diurnal baseline IOP will be constructed as the average of the three Day 1 IOP measurements.  Mean change from mean baseline diurnal IOP will be created by [CONTACT_748941] 3 time points on each of 
Week 1, Week 2, and Week 4 visits and subtracting the single mean baseline diurnal IOP measurement.  
Sub-group analyses based upon pre- study characteristics such as site, demographics, or 
pre-study ocular hypotensive medications may be completed to further investigate the 
efficacy measures.   
Analyses of IOP will also include summarizing the number and percentage of study eyes achieving mean diurnal IOP reduction from baseline of ≥ 4 to_≥ 12 mmHg in 2 mmHg increments and percent reduction from baseline of ≥ 5% to ≥ 40% in 5% increments at 
Week  1, Week 2, and Week 4.  Additionally, the number and percentage of study eyes 
attaining a mean diurnal IOP of ≤ 22 to ≤ 14 mmHg in 1 mmHg increments will be summarized at Week 1,  Week 2, and Week 4.  Fisher’s exact test (2 -sided p- values) will be 
  
Netarsudil Ophthalmic Solution 0.02% and 0.04%   
Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1024228] differences between netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) versus placebo for each 
category at each visit.  These analyses will be presented for both the ITT and PP populations 
with observed data only.

for relation to Investigational Product and by [CONTACT_926].  Fisher’s exact test will be used to test the difference in proportions of subjects with each AE between treatment groups netarsudil (0.02% or 0.04%) vs placebo .   
Visual acuity data wil l be summarized at each time point using both continuous summaries 
(logMAR), including change from baseline, and discrete summaries, including change from baseline on an ETDRS chart (or equivalent) in the number of lines and the proportion of subjects with  a worsening of ≥ 3 lines from baseline.   
Slit lamp biomicroscopy and dilated ophthalmoscopy measures will be summarized at each measured time point using discrete summary statistics.  Conjunctival hyperemia will also be 
summarized using continuous summary statistics including change from baseline and change from baseline (pre-washout).

    Appendix  2 Procedures  
Procedures: Best Corrected Visual Acuity  
Best corrected visual acuity  (BCVA) is taken at all visits as a measure of ocular function.  
BCVA will be measured at screening and frequently throughout the study. 
Procedure : Distance visual acuity must be assessed using an Early Treatment of Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) or equivalent chart. Visual acuity testing should precede 
intraocular pressure measurement, the administration of topi[INVESTIGATOR_481202], or any examination requiring contact [CONTACT_748945].  
Distance visual acuity will be measured with best correction. 
The visual acuity chart may be either retro -illuminated (“back -lit”), or reflectance 
illuminated. If the latter  is chosen , then the illumination must be checked at regular intervals 
to be consistent with ETDRS guidelines. Standard charts for a distance from subject to chart 
of [ADDRESS_1024245] the Sponsor’s monitor. 
The subject should attempt to read each letter, line by [CONTACT_4548], left to right, beginning with line 1 
at the t op of the chart (20/200 line).  The subjects should be told that the chart has letters 
only, no numbers.  If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number. The subjects should be asked to read slowly, about [ADDRESS_1024246] identification of each letter.  He/she is not to proceed to the next letter until he/she has given a definite response.  
A maximum effort should  be made to identify each letter on the chart. When the subject says 
he/she cannot read a letter, he/she should be encouraged to guess.  If the subject identified 2 letters (e.g. , A or B), he/she should be asked to choose [ADDRESS_1024247] be performed consistently (e.g., the same lighting conditions, viewing distance, etc.) during the entire study.  
The number of letters missed is multiplied by 0.[ADDRESS_1024248] 1 letter.

Clinical Study Protocol: AR -[ADDRESS_1024249] clinical practice.  
The clinician will examine and grade the eyelid s of both eyes for evidence of erythema 
and/or edema. Observations will be documented on the appropriate CRF.  The clinician will 
examine the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, pupil, and lens of the eye with the aid of a slit lamp, which is a table -mounted binocular microscope, and report their gradings 
for these tissues .  Fluor escein dye will be instilled into the ocular cul- de-sac to facilitate this 
examination. The Sponsor recommends that the same examiner should conduct all biomicroscopy examinations at each time point and at each visit for a given subject.  
Biomicroscopic gra ding will be done as follows:

Score from 0.1 to 1.0 in 0.1 increments  
A priori, a change of 0.2 units in either eye is considered clinically significant.  
Procedures: Pachymetry - Central Corneal Thickness  
Central corneal thickness will be measured by [CONTACT_748946] (mean of 2 readings per eye).  The mean value will be used for enrollment criteria.  
For individuals with mean central corneal thickness greater than 620  μm, they may return 
either the same day, or within 7 days for another pachymetry measurement. If the mean of 
2 readings on that second pachymetry is ≤ 620 μm, then the individual may be considered for the study. 
Procedures: Gonioscopy  
The purpose of this examination is to confirm that the iridocorneal angle is open, and that the 
subject does not have narrow angle glaucoma, which is an exclusion criteria for study participation.  Gonioscopy may be perform ed up to 3 months prior to randomization. 
Gonioscopy will be performed at the slit lamp, bilaterally, using a goniolens  and grading will 
be by [CONTACT_748947] (Stamper 2009).  
Procedures: Symptomatology

    Procedures: Blood Pressure 
Blood pressure will be measured after heart rate (and thus the subject will already be in a 
resting s tate).  Blood pressure will be measured using a sphygmomanometer with appropriate 
size cuff and a stethoscope or with a measurement device. 
Procedures: Urine Pregnancy Test  
A urine hCG pregnancy test (only for females who are not diagnosed as postmenopausal or 
surgically sterile) will be used in this study and performed at the screening visit to immediately confirm non -pregnancy eligibility for females of child -bearing potential.   
The Sponsor will provide urine pregnancy tests to the sites.  Expi[INVESTIGATOR_748918]. 
If a female becomes pregnant during the study, the Investigator should notify the Sponsor 
immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed and the subject will be e xited from the study.

10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the doctor should be particularly cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship to him or her or may consent under duress. In that case, the informed consent should be obtained by a doctor who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship. 
11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal guardian in accordance with national legislation. Where physica l or mental incapacity 
makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with national legislation.

involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration  are 
complied  with.  
II. MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH PROFESSIONAL CARE (CLINICAL  
RESEARCH)  
1. In the treatment of the sick person, the doctor must be free to use a new diagnostic and 
therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgment it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering.  
2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomforts of a new method should be weighed  
against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods.  
3. In any medical study, all subjects - including those of a control group, if any, should be 
assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 
4. The refusal  of the patient to participate in a study  must never interfere with the doctor- 
patient relationship.  
5. If the doctor considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee. 
6. The doctor can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition  of new medical knowledge, only to the extent that medical research  is 
justified by [CONTACT_748951] o r therapeutic value for the patient.

Forms, and Case Report Forms of study subjects. 
3. A member of the Sponsor or designee will meet with the Investigator when all subjects have completed t he Final Visit of the study, in order to collect the Case Report Forms, 
unused study medications , and unused supplies and materials.  
4. Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultations will be done by [CONTACT_39613], as necessary, to ensure the proper progression and document of the study.

    Appendix  7 Sample SAS Code  
The following SAS code will be used for multiple imputations using the Monte- Carlo 
Markov Chain method, where a separate model will be fit for each time point at each visit.  
proc mi data = indata seed = 6876 out = outdata1; 
mcmc initial = em; 
var trt01pn baseline IOP ; 
run; 
 where  
- indata is the name [CONTACT_386139] 
- outdata1 is the name [CONTACT_386140] 
- trt01pn is the name [CONTACT_386141]  
- baseline  captures the baseline IOP for the given time point 
- IOP is the name [CONTACT_386142].  
Thirty complete data sets will be generated from the above code. Each complete data set will 
be used to analyze this primary efficacy endpoint separately using analysis of variance. Then, the SAS procedure MIANALYZE will be used to analyze the results from the 30 complete data sets to generate a combined inference. The following SAS code will be used:  
 
ods output diffs = outdata2; proc mixed data= outdata1; 
 by _IMPUTATION_ ; 
 class trt01pn; 
 model IOP = trt01pn baseline ; 
 lsmeans trt01pn /  cl pdiff;  
run;

4.1. Introduction  
The mortality of patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) remains high at 17% per year and 
similarly the 5 -year survival rate is low at only 42%  (United Stated Renal Data System, 2018 ), 
which is worse than for advanced colon cancer (O’Connell et al, 2004 ). Cardiovascular events 
are the leading cause of death  (United Stated Renal Data System, 2018 ), and an important but 
often unrecognized cause for excess cardiovascular mortality on HD is volume overload. 
Volume overload contributes to hypertension  (Agarwal et al, 2009 ) and left ventricular 
hypertrophy  (Hur et al, 2013 ), both of which are associated with cardiovascular events and 
mortality (Sarnak et al, 2003 ). Experimental objective measures of volume status have directly 
associated volume overload with mortality (Agarwal 2010 ; Wizemann et al, 2009 ). 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_662834], volume 
overload remains c ommon in the HD population. HD patients are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662835], with 
an average of 1.7 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662836] 30 days of discharge 
occurring in 38% of discharges  (United Stated Renal Data System, 2018 ), which is far in  excess 
of the general population. Volume overload conservatively contributes to over 10% of both 
initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662837] 30 days (United Stated Renal Data System, 2018 ), 
with 1 analysis finding a 14% yearly rate for acute dialysis performed for volume overload at a 
cost to Medicare of $266 million in 2010 dollars  (Arneson et al, 2010 ). 
The persistent morbidity and mortality attributable to volume overload is in part due to the lack 
of a validated objective measure of volume status f or the dialysis population  (Sinha 2011 ). In the 
absence of an objective method, the subjective dry weight method is used to manage volume 
status on HD. The dry weight method remains essentially unchanged since it was first described 
over [ADDRESS_894765] volume overload 
(Thompson et al, 1967 ). Unfortunately, the clinical exam is not sensitive for detecting small but 
clinically relevant volume overload  (Sinha and Agarwal, 2009 ), and changes in dry weight  of 
only 0.[ADDRESS_894766] been shown to be clinically significant (Agarwal et al 2009; 
Hur et al, 2013 ). 
There is a clear and longstanding need for a reliable objective measure of volume status for use 
in guiding volume removal in the chronic HD popu lation.  
4.2. Investigational Device Background  
The FAST PV and mGFR Technology is a direct measurement of PV and GFR  that relies on 
reading the intensity of fluorescent markers attached to different size d dextran molecules 
introduced into the bloodstream. The test is intended as an adjunct to current methods utilized to 
assess kidney function , intravascular volume and interstitial volume . 
The FAST PV and mGFR Technology includes intravenously (IV) administ ered fluorescent 
markers, timed blood draws, a validated fluorometric assay, and a computed algorithm to 
integrate the results and calculate the PV and GFR.  
FAST BioMedical  Clinical Protocol  
FAST PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894767] Background  
The bolus IV administered  visible fluorescent injectate  (VFI ) agent is comprised of a mixture of 
2 different molecular weight carboxymethyl dextran molecules (5 kD and 150 kD) with different 
fluorescent dye molecules attached. The 5  kD carboxymethyl dextran (FD001) is labeled with 
5-aminofluorescein and the 150 kD carboxymethyl dextran (FD003) is labeled with 
2-sulfohexamine rhodamine. These fluorescent labels are covalently attached to the dextran 
through th e carboxymethyl moiety. When combined in a 3:1 (mass) ratio of small to large 
molecules, these dextrans make up the VFI . 
The high molecular weight labeled carboxymethyl dextran , FD003,  is not rapi[INVESTIGATOR_627817]; therefore, its 
concentration in the blood stream after injection provides a direct measurement of the total PV. 
The low molecular weight labeled c arboxymethyl dextran , FD001,  is also not subject to rapid 
metabolism but is freely filtered by [CONTACT_8212]. The decline in the concentration of FD001  
combined with the PV measured b y FD003 provide s a rapid and accurate assessment of GFR.  
In previous studie s, the FD001 component of the FAST VFI was used to determine mGFR. In 
this study , the FD001 marker will be used to measure the volume of distribution or interstitial 
volume (ISV). Its distribution into the interstitial space, combined with the measurement of PV 
by [CONTACT_65791]003 will allow for the calculation of a true measured volume of distribution.  
While the VFI is a substantially modified dextran -based compound, other dextran products have, 
on rare occasions, been associated with mild to severe, acute anaphylact ic reactions including 
death. As a precaution, subjects will be closely monitored for signs of allergy and anaphylaxis, 
and an emergency resuscitation kit and team will be available throughout the performance 
period.

[IP_ADDRESS].  Summary of Clinical Findings  
FAST BioMedical has conducted [ADDRESS_894770] PV and mGFR 
Technology in healthy subjects (Study FAST_GFR -01.1), in healthy subjects and subjects with 
compromised renal function (Study Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] B/Phase 2a), in healthy subjects and patients with 
varying degrees of renal impairment (Study Phase 2b)  and in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662838] F patients (Study 
Phase 2c) . 
The Phase [ADDRESS_894771] 
PV and mGFR Tec hnology (Study FAST_GFR -01.1). In this study, 32 subjects divided into 
4 cohorts of 8 subjects (6 subjects receiving the VFI and 2 subjects receiving placebo) between 
the ages of 21 and 45 years co mpleted the study. Doses of the VFI evaluated in this study were 5, 
15, 75, and 150 mg adminis tered by [CONTACT_662851]. The placebo subjects received 0.9 % 
normal saline for injection. The components of the device used in the study included a catheter - 
-based fiber optic probe placed in the subject’s peripheral vein to allow the concentration of 
fluorescent markers to be monitored and an optical device to e xcite and detect the markers.  
Single -dose administration of VFI in a range of 5 to 150 mg was saf e and well tolerated. Overall, 
9 subjects (28.1%) experienced 15 treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs), which were 
considered reasonably related to the VFI  administration or study p rocedures by [CONTACT_093]. 
Most related TEAEs were observed after administration of 15 mg VFI (9 TEAEs reported by 
3 subjects). Two subjects (both receiving 15 mg VFI) reported 6 TEAEs (pruritus and 
gastrointestinal disorders) , which were considered related to VFI (mainly injection site pain and 
hematoma at the blood s ampling site). The most frequently reported TEAEs were nervous 
system disorders (10 subjects [31.3%], 10 TEAEs), which mainly included headache considered 
unrelat ed to the VFI or study procedures.  All TEAEs were of mild to moderate intensity and 
there were no serious adverse events ( SAEs); no subject discontinued the study due to an adverse 
event ( AE). No treatment -related TEAEs were observed after the highest dose . There w ere no 
adverse device effects. Safety laboratory parameters, vital signs, and electrocardiogram ( ECG ) 
parameters showed no clinically relevant time - or treatment -related differences.  
The Phase 2a clinical study was a prospective study evaluating t he FAST PV and mGFR 
Technology in subjects with preserved and impaired kidney function. In this study , 4 cohorts of 
8 subjects and 1 cohort of 6 subjects were planned to receive 75 mg of the VFI (50 mg FD001 
and 25 mg FD003). A total of 33 subjects were en rolled with 1 of 6 planned subje cts enrolled in 
the AKI group. Cohorts 1 and 5 had normal kidney function with GFR of ≥ 60 mL/min, Cohort 2 
GFR was estimated at 30  to 59 mL/min, Cohort 3 GFR was 15  to 29 mL/min, and Cohort 4 was 
planned to be AKI subjects with Scr  2-fold increase or eGFR > 50% decrease compared to 
baseline. Of the 33 subjects enrolled, 19 (57.6%) subjects experienced [ADDRESS_894772] PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894773] -HD_Protocol_Dec -2020 Version 1.2 Rev 3 FINAL  Page 17 of 52 Confidential  The Phase 2b study was a prospective, open -label study designed to evaluate the safety, 
tolerabil ity, pharmacokinetics ( PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of FAST PV and mGFR 
Technology in healthy subjects and patients with varying degrees of renal impairment. A total of 
32 subjects were planned to be enrolled in 4 cohorts of up to 8 subjects/patients eac h. Healthy 
subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 had an eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; patients with impaired renal 
function in Cohort 3 had an eGFR  30 and < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; and patients with impaired 
renal function in Cohort 4 had an eGFR  15 and < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Subjects in Cohort  1

iohexol ) on Day [ADDRESS_894774] igator to be p ossibly related to study drug. There were no other clinically significant 
abnormal clinical laboratory values.  There were no clinically significant abnormal ECG or vital 
signs measurements, nor were there clinically meaningful trends identifi ed in observed v alues or 
changes from baseline.  There were no clinically significant abnormal physical examination 
findings.  
The Phase 2c study was an investigator -initiated, human clinical trial designed to evaluate the 
safety and functionality of the FAS T PV and mGFR Technology in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_662839]. 
Patients enrolled in the study were administered VFI (Day 1) with a second dose occurring 48h 
(+/- 5h) after the initial dose (Day 3).  A total of 37/50 (74%) patients had a treatment -emergent 
AE (TEAE) while 21/30 (42%) had a treatment -emergent SAE (TESAE). One patient died 
during the study , but the death was deemed to be not related to the intervention. Further, there 
were no treatment related SAEs and 10/50 (20%) patients had a treatment related AE with 
maximal mild severity. In total, 4 patients (4/50, 8%) suffered from treatment related diarrhoea 
including 1 with a moderate severity while for all other related TEAES only 1 patient was  
affected each time (1/50, 2%). Of all 50 patients, 3 patients (6%) were affected by [CONTACT_135330], 
cardiac failure, and acute kidney injury each while 2 patients had endocarditis. All other SAEs 
occurred only in 1 patient each (1/50, 2%).

In the first -in-human clinical study (Study FAST_GFR -01.1), mean plasma concentrations of 
FD001 increased dose dependently with peak concentrations observed at 0.25 hours after 
admini stration (first blood sample). Therea fter, mean concentration decreased rapi[INVESTIGATOR_662840] (LOQ) observed at 48 hours postdose. Mean plasma 
concentrations of FD003 increased dose dependently with peak concentrations observed at 
0.25 (5 mg VFI) to 2 h ours (75 an d 150 mg VFI) after injection. Thereafter, mean concentrations 
decreased with a constant rate until 312 hours postdose. A slower elimination rate was observed 
until 480 hours after administration (en d of the observation period). At [ADDRESS_894776] order elimination 
manner with early -phase distribution apparen tly complete at 8 to 12 hours. The mean time at 
which the maximum plasma concentration was observed was approx imately 0.25 hours . Mean 
plasma elimination half -life estimates increased with decreasing renal function (5.64  hours in 
Cohort 5, 9.48 hours in Cohort 2 , and 18.3 hours in Cohort 3). In contrast, mean plasma FD003 
elimination half -life estimates were gener ally similar regardless of renal function (90.9  hours in 
Cohort 5, 123 hours in Cohort 2, and 125 hours in Cohort 3). Mean FD003 volume estimates 
indicated that FD003 appeared to occupy a volume space that  corresponds to PV. Mean FD003 
clearance did not ch ange with decreasing renal function.  
The Phase 2b clinical study showed that FD001 does not appear to accumulate in most healthy 
subjects with normal renal function whe n dosed at a [ADDRESS_894777] 6 hours, allowing 
repeat measurements of PV during that time period without redosing.  
The PV data showed good correlation and no bias when compar ed to Nadler’s estimat e 
(Nadler  et al, 1962) . A comparison of iohexol GFR to the FAST VFI mGFR showed excellent 
correlation through the entire range of GFRs measured. The FAST VFI method was able to 
accurately measure the change in PV within subjects due t o the administration of 350 mL of 5% 
albumin. The FAST mGFR technology delivered clinically meaningful results as demonstrated 
by [CONTACT_662852].  
Pharmacokinetics were not studied in the Phase 2c study.  
4.5. Iohexol Backgrou nd 
OMNIPAQUE 300 (hereafter referred to as iohexol) is indicated in adults for aortography 
including studies of the aortic arch, abdominal aorta and its branches, contrast enhancement for 
computed tomographic head and body imaging, cerebral arteriography, peripheral venography 
(phlebography), and excretory urography.  
FAST BioMedical  Clinical Protocol  
FAST PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894778] medium permitting radiographic visualization of the internal structures until 
significant hemodilution occurs.  
Approximately 90% or more of the injected dose is excreted within the first [ADDRESS_894779] hour after administration. Plasma and urine 
iohexol levels indicate that the iohexol body clearance is due primarily to renal clearance  (CL r). 
An increase in the dose from 500 to 1500 mgI/kg does not significantly alter the clearance o f the 
drug. The following PK values were observed following the IV administration of iohexol 
(between 500 to 1500 mgI/kg) to 16 adult human subjects: CL r = 120 (86 to 162) mL/min; total 
body clearance  = 131 (98 to 165) mL/min; and volume of distribution  = 165 (108 to 219) mL/kg.  
Renal accumulation is sufficiently rapid that the period of maximal opacification of the renal 
passages may begin as early as [ADDRESS_894780] occurring between 5 to 15  minutes. In nephropathic 
conditions, particularly when excretory capacity has been altered, the rate of excretion may vary 
unpredictably, and opacification may be delayed after injection. Severe renal impairment may 
resul t in a lack of diagnostic opacification of the collecting system and, depending on the degree 
of renal impairment, prolonged plasma iohexol levels may be anticipated. In these patients, the 
route of excretion through the gallbladder and into the small inte stine may increase.  
Iohexol displays a low affinity for serum or plasma proteins and is poorly bound to serum 
albumin.  
No significant metabolism, deiodination, or biotransformation occurs.  
Iohexol enhances computed tomographic imaging through augmentation of radiographic 
efficiency. The degree of density enhancement is directly related to the iodine content in an 
administered dose; peak iodine blood levels occur immediately following rapid IV injection. 
Blood levels fall rapi[INVESTIGATOR_83826] 5 to 10 minutes and t he vascular compartment half -life is 
approximately 20 minutes. This can be accounted for by [CONTACT_627845]. 
Equilibration with the extracellular c ompartments is reached in about 10 minutes; thereafter, the 
fall becomes exponential.  
Refer to the OMNIPAQUE ( iohexol) injection prescribing information (2010)  for additional 
details.  
4.6. Study Rationale  
4.6.1.  Rationale for Dose  Selection  
Each  anticipated  single  dose for a [ADDRESS_894781] of 35 mg of FD001 and 12 mg of 
FD003, diluted at 15.7 mg/mL, for a total injection of 3.0 mL VFI, equivalent to 0.78 mg/kg or 
28.9 mg/m2 for a [ADDRESS_894782] PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894783] VFI has not been given to dialysis patients before. In the Phase 2c s tudy, a patien t 
with a measured GFR of 16.7 mL/min/1.73m2 was dosed with VFI with no AE or SAEs related 
to the study drug observed . Although the patients in this study will receive [ADDRESS_894784] VFI, 
the initial doses of VFI and iohexol will be removed d uring the patient’s  dialysis session. The 
second dose of VFI and Iohexol will be removed between [ADDRESS_894785] 
follow -up dialysis session. The concentration the patients in this study will be exposed to is 
higher for longer than previo us studies due to the lack of kidney function; however, the FD001 
and iohexol, will continue to distribute into the extracellular fluid of the patient. The FD003 
exposure is unchanged from prior studies.

9.5.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital signs assessments will include oral temperature ( °C), respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (breaths per minute), 
systolic and diastolic BP (mmHg) , and pulse rate (bpm). Blood pressure and pulse rate will be 
measured after the subject /patient  has been resting quietly in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_662841] 5  minutes.  
Vital sign s abnormalities that (1) are considered clinical ly significant initially and on 
confirmation, (2) require a subject /patient  to be discontinued from the study, (3) require a 
subject /patient  to receive treatment, or (4) require a change or discontinuation from the study 
product (if applicable) will be rec orded as AEs.  
9.5.4.  Physical Examination  
Complete physical examinations ( including eyes, ears, nose and throat, cardiac, peripheral 
vascular, pulmonary, musculoskeletal, neurologic, abdominal, lymphatic, and dermatologic 
systems ) will be performed, and abnormal findings will be documented in the subject’s /patient’s  
CRF.  
An abnormal physical examination finding that is considered clinically significant and 
(1) requires the subject /patient  to be discontinued from the study, (2) requires the subject /patient  
to recei ve treatment, or (3) requires a change or discontinuation of the study product (if 
applicable) will be recorded as an AE.  
9.5.5.  Appropriateness of Safety Assessments  
Safety evaluations selected for this study are typi[INVESTIGATOR_662842] /patient  population 
and utilize widely accepted measures.  
FAST BioMedical  Clinical Protocol  
FAST PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894811].  Any 
worsening of the patient’s disease under study or other medical conditions wil l also be 
considered to be an adverse event, unless it is within the normal range of disease fluctuation for 
that patient.  
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life -threatening problem or de ath caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the 
investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for AEs, from administration of the first dose of 
VFI through the follow -up phone call /EOS visit . Adverse events that are identified at the last 
assessment  visit (or the early termination visit) as specified in the protocol must be recorded on 
the AE CRF with the status of the AE noted. All events that are ongoing at this time will be 
recorded as ongoing on the CRF. All (both serious and nonserious) AEs must  be followed until 
they are resolved or stabilized, or until attempts to determine resolution of the event are 
exhausted. The investigator should use his/her discretion in ordering additional tests as necessary 
to monitor  the resolution of such events.  
The procedures specified in Section 10.4 are to be followed for reporting SAEs.  
10.1. Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events are to be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. The following information will be 
recorded:  
• Assessment of whether or not the AE is an SAE (Section 10.2.1 ) 
• Assessment of AE intensity ( Section 10.2.2 ) 
• Assessment of AE relationship to study product (Section  10.2.3 ) 
• Action taken - categorized as none, study drug discontinued, dose modified, required 
concomitant medication, required procedure, or other.  
• Outcome - recorded as event resolved, resolved with sequelae, ongoing, or death.  
10.2. Assessment of Adverse Events  
The investigator will assess each AE for seriousness, intensity, and relationship t o study product . 
FAST BioMedical  Clinical Protocol  
FAST PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894812] -HD_Protocol_Dec -2020 Version 1.2 Rev 3 FINAL  Page 35 of 52 Confidential  10.2.1.  Serious Adverse Events  
The investigator is responsible for determining whether an AE meets the definition of a n SAE. 
An SAE is any AE occurring from ICF signing through the follow -up phone call /EOS visit  that 
results in any of the followin g outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3767] a n SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: SAEs require immediate reporting to the sponsor . Refer to “Reporting Serious Adverse 
Events” ( Section 10.4) for details.  
10.2.2.  Intensity  
The intensity of an AE will be graded according to the following definitions:  
• Mild: Any symptom of which the subject is aware, but which is easily tolerated; 
asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not 
indicated.  
• Moderate: Any symptom which is discomforting enough to cause interference with a 
subject's usual activity; minimal, local , or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).  
• Severe: Any symptom which causes a subject's inability to perform usual activity; severe or 
medically significant but no t immediately life -threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24599]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
It should be noted that a severe adverse event need not be serious in nature and that an SAE need 
not, by [CONTACT_108], be severe.  
FAST BioMedical  Clinical Protocol  
FAST PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894813] should be determined by [CONTACT_662858] c riteria:  
• Not related: The event is most likely produced by [CONTACT_1605]’s clinical 
condition, intercurrent illness, or concomitant drugs, and does not follow a known response 
pattern to the study product , or the temporal relationship o f the event to study product 
administration makes a causal relationship unlikely  
• Possibly related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response pattern to the study product , but coul d have 
been produced by [CONTACT_1605]'s clinical condition, intercurrent illness, or 
concomitant drugs  
• Related: The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of drug 
administration, and/or follows a known response patte rn to the study product , and cannot be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1605]'s clinical condition, intercurrent 
illness, or concomitant drugs  
10.3. Discontinuation due to Adverse Events  
Any subject who experiences an AE may be withdrawn at an y time from the study at the 
discretion of the investigator. Subjects withdrawn from the study due to an AE, whether serious 
or nonserious, m ay be followed by [CONTACT_627853]. The AE(s) should be noted on  the appropriate CRFs and the subject’s progress 
should be followed until the AE is resolved  or stabilized as determined by [CONTACT_093] . The 
sponsor  must be notified. If the AE relate s to overdose of study treatment, the Investigator ’s 
Brochure should  be consulted for details of any specific actions to be taken.  
10.4. Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
In the event of any SAE reported or observed during the study, whether or not attributable to the 
study drug, site personnel will report it immediately by [CONTACT_662859]. Any 
SAE attributable to study participation will be reported promptly to the IRB as required by [CONTACT_662860] L.  Roudebush  Veterans Affairs Medical Center.  
10.5. Documentation and  Reporting of  Immediately Reportable Adverse Events   
Any unexpected adverse event that could adversely affect the safety of the subjects or the 
conduct of the study and any serious adverse event, which occurs during the course of this study, 
will be reported to the sponsor immediately (ie,  within 24 hours).  
FAST BioMedical  Clinical Protocol  
FAST PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894814] the following data:  
• Name, address, and telephone number of the reporting investigator  
• Investigational product(s)  
• Study code  
• Subject identification number, initials, sex, and date of birth  
• Description of the adverse ev ent, measures taken and outcome (if resolved)  
• Likelihood of drug causation of the adverse event assessed by [CONTACT_662861], and in any case no later than  [ADDRESS_894815] knowledge by [CONTACT_456].   The sponsor will 
inform all investigators.  In accordance with IU policy, the study team will be responsible for 
informing the IRB of any promptly reportable events within 5 days of discovery including tho se 
listed below.  
The sponsor will inform as soon as possible,  but no later than  15 days after knowledge,  the FDA 
and the IRB about any event which necessitates reconsideration of the benefit -risk-ratio of the 
investigational drug.   These events are in part icular:   
• Single cases of expected serious adverse reactions with an unexpected outcome.  
• An increased incidence of expected serious adverse reactions which is considered clinically 
relevant.  
• Suspected serious unexpected adverse reactions occurring after a c oncerned person has 
completed the study.  
• Events related to the conduct of the study or the development of the drugs possibly affecting 
the safety of the concerned persons.  
All additional measures deemed necessary through new findings and taken by [CONTACT_662862].  
10.6. Pregnancy  
The investigator must report any pregnancy to the medical monitor and to the  Richard 
L. Roudebush  Veterans Affairs Medical Center  within 1 business day of becoming aware of the 
pregnancy.  An uncomplicated pregnancy will not be considered an AE or SAE; however, all 
pregnancies will be followed through birth and [ADDRESS_894816] PV and mGFR Technology™   [ADDRESS_894817] who received study drug will be 
reported as a SAE.  The outcome of any pregnancy and the presence or absence of any congenital 
abnormality will be recorded in the source documentation and reported to the medical monitor 
and sponsor.  
10.7. Drug -induced Liver Injury  
Subjects will be monitored for signs of drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Study product will be 
withheld in the event of potential DILI.  
Potential events of DILI will be defined as meeting all of the following criteria (as specified in 
the FDA Guidance for Industry Drug -induced Liver Injury: Premarket ing Clinical Evaluation, 
2009 ): 
• Alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >  3 × ULN  
• Total bilirubin >  2 × ULN without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum alkaline 
phosphatase)  
• No other reason can be found to explain the combination of laboratory value increases 
(eg, acute viral hepatitis; alcoholic and autoimmune hepatitis; hepatobiliary disorders; 
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis; c ardiovascular causes; concomitant treatments)  
Potential events of DILI will be reported as SAEs ( Section 10.4). All subjects with potential 
DILI will be closely followed until abnormalities return to normal or baseline or until all 
attempts to determine resolution of the event are exhausted.

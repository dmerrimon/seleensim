I. Purpose of the Study  
Brief Background and Rationale  
Over 35% of adults in the [LOCATION_002] are obese, with increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035] .
1,2  Howe ver, there are few primary care (PC) -based 
weight management interventions for this population. Modest weight loss improves health and prevents chronic disease, but healthcare teams often fail to counsel patients about their weight due to barriers such as competing demands and poor competency. Thus, PC-based weight management interventions are needed to address the needs of adults 
with obesity and support healthcare teams to improve care.  
With funding from a Career Development Award from the Veteran’s Affairs (VA) and rigorous formative research, we developed a technology -assisted weight management 
intervention, called Goals for Eating and Moving (GEM). This intervention is based on the 5As framework (assess, advise, agree, assist, arrange) as recommended by [CONTACT_426333]. The GEM intervention uses a tablet -delivered online tool to facilitate 
in-person and telephone- delivered health coaching by [CONTACT_105]- clinical st aff, provide tailored 
patient education materials, and activate patients to set behavior change goals and discuss weight management treatments with their healthcare teams. Preliminary data suggests that the GEM intervention is feasible and acceptable to Veterans and VA staff and facilitates 5As counseling. An ongoing RCT will determine if it promotes weight loss.  
The Patient -Centered Medical Home model is an expanded care model emphasizing 
patient -centered care delivered by [CONTACT_161047] -professional teams of individuals working to 
integrate evidence based approaches to improve individual and population health.
14,15  
However, it is unclear how the Patient -Centered Medical Home model can be used to 
address barriers to 5As implementation, improve weight management counseling, and increase participation in intensive weight management programs. We developed GEM (Goals for Eating and Moving), an innovative, technology -assisted 5As -based 
intervention for Medical Homes to promote weight loss, behavior change, and participat ion in intensive weight management programs. To establish the efficacy of the 
GEM intervention, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled 12- month intervention  
of 16 primary care teams at two urban healthcare systems with Medical Home models of care to compare the GEM intervention (intervention arm) with Enhanced Usual Care 
(educational materials; control arm).  
Specific Aims  
[ADDRESS_538581] of the GEM intervention on weight change, and clinical and behavioral 
outcomes.  
2. Identify predictors of weight loss in the GEM intervention arm related to: a) goal -
setting processes and b) intervention components  
3. Determine the impact of the GEM intervention on obesity -related counseling practices 
and attitudes in primary care providers.  
Hypothesis  
The patients within primary care teams randomized to the Goals for Eating and Moving 
(GEM) intervention will have greater weight loss than those who receive Enhanced Usual Care.  
Research Design  
a. We will conduct a cluster -randomized controlled trial of the GEM intervention at 
two healthcare systems in [LOCATION_001] City: The VA [LOCATION_001] Harbor Healthcare System (Manhattan campuse) and Montefiore Medical Groups (4 sites affiliated with [LOCATION_001] City Research and Improvement Networking practice- based 
research netw ork).  
 
b. We will conduct a RE -AIM (reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and 
maintenance) eval uation of the GEM intervention. 
[ADDRESS_538582]  weight loss (7%) via the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) can reduce the risk 
of diabet es in high -risk patients by 58%. 
3 Similarly, all Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical 
Centers offer the MOVE! program, a lifestyle- based program delivered in small group 
sessions. 4, 26, 27 One report found that patients who attended two or more MOVE! 
sessions we re more likely than matched controls to have clinically significant (>5%) 
weight loss ad less likely to gain weight . [ADDRESS_538583] strategies to increase 
participation in these effective programs.  
The primary care setting is critical to reducing the burden of obesity. Primary care (PC) is an important venue to promote weight loss through lifestyle behavior change, and effective PC -based interventions can potentially have a significant public health impact, 
4 
 
   
 since the majority of the 1 billion yearly ambulatory visits are made to primary care 
physicians. 9 Moreover, physicians’ and other providers’ counseling is associated with 
positive behavioral and weight -loss outcomes.31-34 The [LOCATION_002] Preventive Services 
Task Force end orses the use of the 5As framework (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, 
Arrange) to deliver obesity counseling within primary care.[ADDRESS_538584] (CDA) from the Veterans Affairs, we 
recently developed a technology -assisted, weight management  intervention called Goals 
for Eating and Moving (GEM) to deliver 5As weight management counseling within a patient centered medical home model of care (PCMH). Figure 1 illustrates how the intervention is delivered within PCMH and promotes goal setting and weight loss. Patients 
arrive early to their PC appointment to use an online goal setting tool (GEM tool) delivered on a tablet computer that generates a personalized binder of tailored materials. The patient then meets with a health coach to further refine weight loss and lifestyle goals, address barriers, and suggest other weight management resources. PC teams then endorse goals and provide brief motivational interviewing as needed. They can use a clinical reminder within the electronic health record to document 5As counseling conversations. Patients receive follow -up phone coaching calls from their health coach to 
document progress, adjust goals, and facilitate communication with the heath care team and weight management -related services.  
The GEM intervention has great potential to improve the delivery of obesity counseling within the PCMH model of primary care. Initial findings from an ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_426317] a VA medical center demonstrated that it was feasible and acceptable to Veterans and staff and facilitated goal -setting 
conversations (see Preliminary Studies). However, there is no standard by [CONTACT_426334] -Centered Medical Home model to provide weight management care. 
There is a need t o test weight management interventions within patient -centered medical 
homes that integrate and/or partner with effective, intensive programs such as MOVE! and DPP.  
Judith Wylie -Rosett, EdD, RD (Co -I) has over three decades of experience leading 
multicent er and investigator -initiated lifestyle trials for diet, obesity, and exercise whose 
work in Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), DDP -Outcomes Study and Women’s Health 
Initiative has shaped national health guidelines.

[ADDRESS_538586] circumference measurements, , and blood pressure measurements fr om patients at 
multiple time points throughout the study. We will also use questionnaires to measure dietary outcomes and physical activity outcomes. Finally, electronic health records (EHR) and surveys will be utilized to evaluate attendance to intensi ve weight management programs.

2. Identify predictors of weight loss in the GEM intervention arm related to: a) goal -
setting processes and b) intervention components.  
a. We will measure attainment of behavioral goals by [CONTACT_426335] . 
[ADDRESS_538587] of the GEM intervention on obesity -related counseling 
practices and attitudes in primary care providers.  
a. We will survey providers to measure 5As -related competency and 
attitudes about weight loss using validated survey items . 
13 The feasibility 
and acceptability of the intervention will be evaluated using RE -AIM 
analysis.  
 
II. Characteristics of the Research Population  
 Number of Subjects  
With an expected 20% participation rate (based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]) and a 75% retention rate 
(based on rates from another VA study and other technology -based interventions)
49,69, 
we will need to screen 2,615 eligible patients to enroll a baseline sample of 512 patients and end with 384 patients completing the study.   Gender of Subjects  
Both male and female patients will be recruited as part of the weight management study being tested, and the study is not intended to be gender specific.  Often, weight management studies include 70- 80% women,
96 and men are often under -represented.  
However, we anticipate that 52% of our sample will be women since the VA has only 8-
10% women.  
  Age of Subjects Subjects between the ages of [ADDRESS_538588] the inclusion and exclusion criteria for our study population.  
 Inclusion Criteria  
 Between the ages of 18- 69 years of age,

[ADDRESS_538589] a cluster -r
 andomized controlled trial of the GEM intervention at two 
healthcare systems in [LOCATION_001] City: The VA [LOCATION_001] Harbor Healthcare System 
(Manhattan campus) and Montefiore Medical Group (4 sites affiliated with [LOCATION_001] City 
Research and Improvement Networking  (NYC RING) practice -based research network . 
Participant s will be randomized at the team level (19 teams with approximately 28 
providers and 512  patients to achieve a sample size of 384 patients  at 12 month follow -
up for the primary outcome assessment ).  The primary care teams will be randomized 
using a random number generator (block randomization with block size of four) to either the GEM Intervention or Enhanced Usual Care arms. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_426336] (MMG and VA).  
 
Intervention Arm – GEM  
The GEM intervention leverages the patient -centered medical home model (see Figure 1 
below) by [CONTACT_426337], patient -centered care at the 
time of the primary care visit, promote standardized weight management counseling by [CONTACT_426338], coordinate care between teams and other weight management service providers/programs (e.g., dietitians, health educators, DPP),  and provide feedback to the provider and primary care team about patients’ weight 
management -related goals, progress, and care.   Patients in the GEM intervention will 
complete the following (items 1 –2 will be completed at the baseline visit). Average times 
to complete are included below based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_48124].  
1. Complete the GEM tool (20 minutes)  
2. Meet with a health coach and review tailored patient report and educational materials (30 minutes)  
3. Meet with their primary care team for regularly scheduled visit (varies 15– 45 
minutes, 1– 8 times/year)  
4. Receive 12 telephone coaching calls from health coach (20– 30 minutes each)  
5. Follow up as needed with primary care teams (varies)

   G
EM Tool:  If needed, 
health coaches will help patients to use the GEM tool. The online program is optimized for use on tablet computers and designed to support health coach and primary care team counseling. It assesses current behaviors, barriers, and facilitators to weight loss via a 16 -
item questionnaire, provides tailored advice, and guides patients to set weight loss (5 –10%)
10, diet, 
and physical activity (PA) goals . It 
identifies intensive weight management programs and self -m onitoring options, 
allowing patients to choose which to discuss with the health coach and primary care team. This tool also generates an individualized patient report, provides tailored educati onal materials, and produces a report for the primary care team through the 
EHR. Although developed initially for the VA, it can be customized for other healthcare systems with minimal programming.   
  B
aseline Health Coach Visit:  After completing the GEM tool, a Health Coach meets 
with the patient for 30 minutes (based on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]). Sessions will be audio-recorded for fidelity checks and health coach training.  The Health Coaches will perform the following tasks :  
 M
ake initial goals into SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Timely) 
goals63  
 Encourage participation (using MI) in MOVE, DPP, or community -based 
programs/gyms  
 Teach how to self -monitor weight, diet, and PA behaviors via pedometer, food log, 
and/or weight management apps (e.g. MOVE! Coach mobile70,71 on iPhones, My 
Fitness Pal72 on Androids)  Figure 1:  How GEM intervention fits within PCMH  
 

9 
 
   
  Provide brief MI and Brief Action Planning73 to address barriers and increase 
patient self -efficacy  
 Facilitate meetings with extended team members (e.g. health educators, diet itians , 
primary care physicians) if needed  
 Enter a report for primary care teams into EHR from the GEM tool  
 Communicate potential barriers/concerns to the team at baseline visit and as 
needed throughout the intervention period (e.g., via EHR notes, secure messaging system, telephone, and/or team meetings)  
  T
elephone Coaching:  To achieve sufficient intensity according to USPSTF 
guidelines,10 we will incorporate 12 telephone coaching calls by a health coach over 
12 months. Scheduled calls will occur every 2 weeks (biweekly) for months 1 –3, 
monthly for months 4– 6, and every other month (bimonthly) for months 7– 12. GEM 
Intervent ion arm patients will receive a reminder call or an electronic reminder via 
MyHealtheVet  or VA’s Annie texting service to self -monitor their weight, food intake, 
and PA for at least [ADDRESS_538590] that epi[INVESTIGATOR_426318],  consistent self -monitoring (for 3 days) reduce weight and may improve 
adherence.
74 Health coaches will use self -reported self -monitoring data  (from 
pedometers, food logs, and smart  phone apps) to determine goal adherence and 
counsel patients to encourage small changes.[ADDRESS_538591] health coaches via telephone for additional support.  Patients will be reminded to 
discuss their goals during their next primary care visit (if scheduled).  
  P
rovider Role:  Providers in the GEM arm will provide 3– 5 minutes of counseling, use 
clinical reminders to document this  counseling, provide brief MI to address barriers 
(depending on time and patient needs), and discuss GEM -generated weight 
management goals during future visits.   The GEM tool creates a report to 
communicate data to the participant’s primary care team and generates a clinical reminder which facilitates documentation of primary team goal setting conversations and counseling.  
 
Control Arm – Enhanced Usual Care  (EUC)   
Patients in the EUC arm will receive non- tailored weight management handouts by [CONTACT_426339] (Health Bulletins from the NYC DOHMH).79–81 Patients will follow -up with their 
primary care teams as needed.   Data Collection  
Patients: A
sses sment will occur at the following time points:  
 At Baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months, patients will meet in- person or over the phone (for 
follow -up) with a research assistant (RA) to complete surveys; measure weight, 
height, blood pressure, and waist circumference. Baseline surveys will include a pre-
surve y (completed before receiving GEM Intervention/Enhanced Usual Care) . 
Electronic chart review will also occur at these time points.  The RA will administer all surveys and enter the data directly into our REDCap database. To compensate for 
10 
 
   
 travel and time spent completing study measurements, patients will  be given $25 
dollars for the baseline study visit, $30 dollars for the 6- month study visit, $40 dollars 
for the 12- month study visit, and $50 for the follow -up 24- month visit  and $20 dollars 
for the optional one hour opi[INVESTIGATOR_426319] 2 follow -up phone calls . During the 
baseline visit we will encourage patients to sign- up for MyHealtheVet, if they haven’t 
done. In addition, we will inform patients about the VA’s secure Annie texting service 
and help them to sign up, if requested, as another option to receive reminder text 
messages for appointmentsIf patients are signed- up for MyHealtheVet, they can 
choose to receive reminders for their upcoming study visits or health coach phone calls electronically via myHealtheVet. Alternatively, patients can choose receive reminder phone calls from secure VA phones lines  or via the secure Cisco Jabber 
application. . Before upcoming phone coaching calls and study visits, we will send 
reminders via the secure messaging system MyhealtheVet , VA’s Annie texting service  
or make phone calls via secure VA phone lines  or via the secure Cisco Jabber 
application. 
 When performing telephone Coaching Calls (patients in GEM Intervention arm only), Health coaches will use a counseling tool that also facilitates data collection into REDCap database.  
 Chart reviews [ADDRESS_538592] -intervention

uture Directions: In future versions of the GEM intervention we would like to add a 
visualization technique called Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCI I) 
that is utilized through an exercise called WOOP (Wish, Outcome, Obstacle, Plan). MCII is a novel, practical strategy that was developed and tested through 20+ years of research to promote motivation and behavior change, particularly for challenging behaviors.
110-115 
In order to obtain data on feasibility and acceptability among Veterans without introducing the burden of an additional visit, we will invite up to 20 participants in either arm at the Manhattan VA site to participate in an optional one h our session  at their 24 month visit 
for an additional $20. Veterans that agree to this additional session will be reconsented with the revised consent form describing this session. During this session they will receive training on WOOP and will be shown how to use the free downloadable WOOP app.
[ADDRESS_538594] 
any information from the WOOP app and discussed this pi[INVESTIGATOR_426320] (Lindsay Dean and Chrissie Palividas ). In addition to this training, we will 
ask each participant a few brief questions related to goal commitment and stage of change before and after t he WOOP training. We will also ask permission to follow up via 
telephone at [ADDRESS_538595], all the variables will be summarized (intention- to-treat approach) using mean (with 
standard deviation) and median (with interquartile range for continuous variables and frequency table for categorical variables) overall and by [CONTACT_426340], respectively. Then, Mann- Whitney tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact tests for 
categorical variables will be used to check if both providers’ and patients’ baseline characteristics are balanced between the interventions arms.  
 Impact of the GEM intervention on weight change, and clinical and behavioral outcomes:  
The primary outcome is mean weight loss at 12 months.  Mann -Whitney tests for 
continuous outcomes (e.g., weight loss) and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical outcomes (e.g., whether or not patients achieve ≥ 5% weight loss) will be used to compare the two 
intervention arms at [ADDRESS_538596] for baseline 
characteristics (e.g. diabetes, gender), taking into account: a) the correlation among patients within providers, and b) the correlation among repeated measures within patients. Model -based adjusted confidence intervals will be provided to also measure the 
effects of the intervention on outcomes. Although the repeated measures modeling can address missing data automatically, assuming it is missing at random, we will further use a multiple imputation procedure to conduct sensitivity analyses under the assumption of missing data not at not at random. The sensitivity analyses will use pattern- mixture 
models to examine if the statistical findings are robust across several scenarios, including 
the least -favorable scenario where the missing data from the GEM intervention arm 
follows the same pattern as that of the observed data from the usual care arm.  
 Predictors of weight loss in the GEM intervention arm related to: a) goal setting processes 
and b) intervention components:  We will use visualization tools, such as scatterplots and 
descriptive analyses (e.g., Spearman correlation coefficients) to display the association between weight change and potential predictors. Multivariate regression models will be used to examine the effects of those predictors, which we suspect will be associated with 
weight loss in the intervention arm. Multivariate linear regression models will be 
considered for continuous outcomes and multiple logistic regression models will be 
considered for binary outcomes. Missing data will be dealt with using inverse- probability -
weighted methods.    Impact of the GEM Intervention on obesity -r
 elated counseling practices and attitudes in 
primary care providers:  We will use Mann- Whitney tests for continuous provider -level 
outcomes and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical provider -level outcomes to compare the 
two intervention arms at each survey.  Confidence intervals of the effects will also be 
computed.

Data
 Storage and Confidentiality  
Storage of Subject Data:  Al l subject  data collected  from the GEM  online tool  including 
survey  responses  and recording of  responses  while  using the tool, interviews,  focus 
groups,  pre/post  surveys,  and measurements  will be kept confidential  and anonymous  
through  de-identification. This signifies that subject names, dates of birth, and primary care 
provider names will be de -identified both in audio and written script during the transcription, 
segmentation, and coding process.  Study session data will be entered  into REDCap,  
which  is a password- protected  database.  Subjects  will each be given  a study  identification  
number,  which  will be stored  in the password- protected database.  Patient  identifying 
information  (e.g. subject name [CONTACT_426349]) will be maintained REDCap,  which  is a 
password -protected  database. All paper data will be kept in a locked,  fire-proof  file cabinet  
dedicated to the study  that is kept in one of the study team’s locked offices (15028BN , 
15028AN 15028CN, or 15161N  at the Manhattan VA).  
Access to Su bject  Data: Only  IRB-approved  study personnel,  including the Principal 
Investigator, Co-Investigators,  Research  Coordinator,  and other research  staff,  will have  
access to the data for entry  and analysis.  Healthcare providers  who are not key personnel  
will not be informed of  any responses  given  by [CONTACT_426342]. 
Retention  of Su bject Data : Subject  data will be kept throughout  the duration  of the study  
and after the study has concluded  to continue with  data analysis.  When data is  no longer 
needed  it will be disposed  of appropriately  via shredder in order to continue protecting 
subject  confidentiality  and anonymity.  
  IV. Risk/Benefit Assessment  
 Risk  
Any research study has possible risks and discomfort and on a rare occasion, unknown and unforeseeable (unanticipated) risks may also occur. Participation in the study poses no more than minimal risks to the subject’s physical and mental health as well as personally identifiable information. Subjects may experience frustration that is often experienced when completing surveys. Some questions may be of a sensitive nature, and subjects may therefore become distressed as a result. If, however, subjects become distressed by a question, subjects have the right to stop at any time or choose not to answer a question or certain questions.   
13 
 
   
 The research team understands that discussing topi[INVESTIGATOR_426323], diet, physical 
activi ty, and/or an individual’s experiences with these topi[INVESTIGATOR_426324].    Protection against Risks  
All members of the research team have been extensively trained in order to effectively 
facilitate conversations and minimize the level of discomfort that individuals may face when dealing with sensitive topi[INVESTIGATOR_426325]. In addition, any potential behavioral changes related to diet or physical  activity will be assessed and 
approved beforehand by [CONTACT_426343], which include the Principal Investigator, Co -Investigators, Research Coordinator, and other research staff.  
 To assure the minimization of any risks all aspects of the research study will be conducted in a private and safe setting. Subjects may withdraw from the study at any given point without having their regular care impacted at the VA or MMG.  Protection 
against the loss of confidentiality will occur through securing all  subject data in a locked 
study office and in a database that is on password- protected computer.  As for 
employees who are participating, this research involves minimal risk for physical, 
psychological, social, and economic harm.  
 Potential Benefits to the Subjects  
 Patients : The patients who participate in the study will  have the opportunity to 
receiv e weight management information and set lifestyle behavior change goals to 
improve their diet and increase physical activity, which may lead to weight loss and improved health outcomes. Even for patients who do not change their health behaviors,  talking about these topi[INVESTIGATOR_426326].  
 Providers, , and other VA or Montefiore employees :  Employees who participate 
in the study may gain improved obesity -related knowledge and patient counseling 
skills, which could enhance their career, job performance, and satisfaction.  Specifically, employees may have the opportunity to receive (additional) 
training in 5As weight management counseling and practice brief motivational interviewing. Training in these could help to facilitate and/or improve discussions around weight management and health behavior change with patients, as well as  
encourage the use of individualized techniques to improve diet and exercise and setting health behavior change goals with patients.  
 V. Investigator’s Qualifications and Experience  
 The CV for each key personnel involved in the study  is included in the IRB submission.  
Modifications will be made when Research Assistants and Health Coaches are on-boarded. All key personnel have (or will have)  completed online training in t he 
protection of human subjects.

VI. Subject Identification, Recruitment, and Consent/Assent  
 
Method of Subject Identification and Recruitment  
 Primary Care Teams  – Primary care teams at each site that meet the eligibility criteria 
below will be separately assigned a number using a random number generator, and the first seven  teams selected at each site will enroll in the study for a total of 1 9 
primary care teams ( 11 VA and 8 MMG).  Individual providers will be allowed to opt out 
of the study. We do not anticipate that providers will drop out once enrolled, based on the VA PROVE study where all 18 eligible teams and 51/52 providers participated for the duration of the study.
65 While pods (at MMG) and PACTs (at VA) have variable 
numbers of providers and patients, we will recruit 2- 3 providers from each team prior 
to randomization to ensure similar numbers of teams, providers, and patients in each arm. Table 2  (below) provides an overview of the staffing/patient population for each 
site.

  Patient Recruitment  (Figure 2 below ) – Using the Patients Health Information 
Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), the VA’s Health Information 
Technology system, and the Montefiore EPIC and Clinical Looking Glass systems, we will identify patients with upcoming primary care appointments who meet the eligibility criteria.  A Research Assistant (RA) will confirm eligibility by [CONTACT_426344].  One to two weeks before their baseline visit, eligible participants will be sent a letter signed by [CONTACT_31363] (PI) and giving them the opportunity to opt out (i.e., request to not be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]). The RA will call patients to recruit, screen for eligibility, and schedule the baseline. This allows enough time for all intervention components to be completed, and is responsive to patient scheduling preferences expressed in a similar recruitment strategy used in the VA PROVE study

 Figu re 2:  Recruitment and Eligibility Screening  

[ADDRESS_538598]/Representative Comprehension  
Research A ssistant s will be  intensively trained in consenting protocols. RAs  will assess 
comprehension by [CONTACT_426345]. The research assistant will be prepared to clearly summarize each section and will answer questions the subject may have about the consent forms. A copy of the consent form will  be available for the patient to take home 
with them  or will be  sent to them . 
 Debriefing Procedures  
For this particular weight management intervention study, no information will be purposely withheld from any of the subjects who are recruited and/or are actively enrolled in the study.  
 
Consent Forms  
For the patient participants,  two consent forms will b e used: the research subject 
informed consent and audio- video consent forms .  For provider participants, completion 
of the survey will serve as implied consent. On the first page of the survey, it will explicitly state that participation is voluntary and that completion serves as  consent . A 
waiver of documentation of informed consent was requested for the provider survey  
For provider participants, who chose to participate in qualitative interviews , we have a 
separate research subject informed consent form.  
 Documentation of Consent  
Written consent will be obtained from all patient subjects who are eligible and agree to 
participate in the study  and for provider subjects who chose to participate in qualitative 
interviews . Documentation of consent will be securely  stored in the research team’s 
locked office on 15 North (15028C N) at the Manhattan VA Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] .  
 
Costs to the Subject  
There will be no costs to the subjects for participating in this study. However, medical care and services provided by [CONTACT_1766]’ current health care facility that are not part of the study, which includes normal visits and prescription expenses, may require payment.  
 Payment for Participation  
To compensate for travel and time spent completing survey measures and basic measurements, study participants will be given cash or a ClinCard in the amount of [ADDRESS_538599] of Appendices

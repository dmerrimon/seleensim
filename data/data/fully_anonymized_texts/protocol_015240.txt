2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE   
While it is now recognized that pediatric feeding disorder (PFD) involves medical, nutritional ,feeding  
skill, and/or psychosocial domains [1], in early intervention (EI) in North Carolina, individual providers 
(speech language pathologists (SLPs) or occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (OTs), are tasked with individually assessing and treating infants with PFD. While trained in feeding skills and sensory processing, these professionals are also expected to screen the medical, nutritional, and psychosocial domains, and make appropriate external referrals, despi[INVESTIGATOR_807247]. The importance of a thorough, systematic evaluation and referral process is particularly important at the transition to solid foods, a critical developmental juncture as feeding demands increase and nutritional 
needs shift [15,16]. SLPs and OTs in EI need a to ol that facilitates timely referrals and communication 
with multidisciplinary feeding teams, or individual specialists, when assessing infants with PFD.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND   
Pediatric feeding problems fall within the scope of many professionals; speech- language pathologists 
(SLPs), occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437] (OTs), nurses, dietitians, gastroenterologists, pediatricians, and 
psychologists/behavior analysts may be involved in evaluation and treatment. In 2019, a consensus definition of pediatric feedin g disorder (PFD) was published, providing these professionals with common 
diagnostic criteria [1]. Preterm infants (1 in 10 live births in North Carolina), are particularly at risk for 
long- term PFD, representing up to 40% of children seen at feeding disor der clinics [2,3]. Th resulting 
economic impact is significant; even insured families report an average loss of $125,645 in income caring for their child with PFD  [4]. 
 While it is now recognized that PFD involves medical, nutritional, feeding skill, and/or psychosocial domains, in early intervention (EI) in NC, individual SLP or OT providers assess and treat infants with PFD. While trained in feeding skills and sensory processing, these providers are also expected to screen the medical, nutritional, and psychosocial domains and make appropriate referrals, despi[INVESTIGATOR_807247]. The importance of a multi- domain, systematic evaluation and 
referral process is particularly important for preterm infants. Preterm infants are  likely to present 
symptoms relevant to multiple professionals including gastroesophageal disorders, physiologic

  5 instability, nutritional deficits, and behavior problems into early childhood [5 –12]. This is particularly 
true at the transition to solid foods, a critical developmental juncture as feeding demands and 
nutritional needs shift [13,14]. EI SLPs and OTs need a tool to facilitate timely referrals and communication with other specialists when assessing preterm infants with PFD.  
 We propose the develo pment of a decision -making tool for the evaluation of preterm infants with PFD 
by [CONTACT_807269].  This tool is specific to children at the solid food level (6mo -3years) and is called the Clinical Feeding Guide (CFG). We have developed a list of 
observational items through examination of existing tools and a literature review. To achieve our goal of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a feasible clinical tool, we will pursue the following specific aims. Aim 1:  Establish content validation using the Delphi Technique to generate a screening and decision -making tool.  Aim 2:  
Complete pi[INVESTIGATOR_807248], acceptability, and change from current standard practice. 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT   
 
2.3.1  KNOWN  POTENTIAL RISKS  
 There are no known risks of using the intervention, as it is being used on mock case studies. There is the potential for participants to experience emotional distress or consequences of a breach of confidentiality. Although the likelihood  of a breach of confidentiality is low, the data collected could 
yield information about participants’ behaviors and demographics that could cause emotional distress if confidentiality were breached. Professionals may also experience fatigue, frustration, or stress will 
reading case studies. However mock case studies have been determined to yield the least stress over 
considering real cases or viewing videos of real children.

4 STUDY DESIGN  
 
4.1 OVERALL  DESIGN  
This is a randomized crossover pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. It will be conducted online through one site, UNC Chapel Hill. 
The study intervention is the ‘Clinical Feeding Tool’ also known as the decision support tool. Our 
hypothesis is that clinicians will change their recommendations for feeding therapy and specialist 
referral when using the tool compared to when they do not use the tool. Clinicians will be randomly assigned to respond to either Case A or Case B without using the tool (2 groups). Then, they will respond to the other case using the tool. Total participation time is estimated at [ADDRESS_1114660] meet all of the following criteria:  
1. Provision of signed and dated informed consent form  
2. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availab ility for the duration of the 
study  
3. Male or female, aged [ADDRESS_1114661] 5 years  
7. English proficiency  
8. Currently reside in NC  
 
5.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this study:  
 
1. Less than [ADDRESS_1114662] in  participating  in the clinical trial but 
are not subsequently randomly assigned to the study intervention or entered in the study. A minimal set 
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants , 
to meet the Consolidated Standards of Repo rting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to 
respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information includes screen failure details, eligibility criteria, and any serious adverse event (SAE).  
 
 
5.5 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
The target sample size is 56 participants with 28 SLPs and 28 OTs. We anticipate one site will be used – UNC Chapel Hill; although the study will be completed virtually by [CONTACT_4317]. Target enrollment will not be stratified for age, gender, or race/ethnicity for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], but future studies will control for these variables. Because participants are expected to be practicing in early intervention, participants will 
be recruited from private practices (which contract with early intervention) and from the early intervention system in North Carolina. Participants will be recruited through web search, the Child Developmental Services Agency, and word of mouth. Potential participants will be emailed through 
these groups and will be directed to an inter est survey where they will complete a screening. If eligible 
and interested, they will provide their name [CONTACT_320945]. In the order of entry, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_807256] a link 
to the survey.   Because the fields of occupational therapy and speech language pathology are majority female, specific female recruitment is not necessary. For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], participants will not be specifically selected for race/ethnicity, but this will be pursued in future, larger studies.  
 Participants who complete the full survey will receive a $[ADDRESS_1114663] as an incentive.  
 
6 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
6.1 STUDY INTERVENTION (S) ADMINISTRATION  
Evaluation of an Interdisciplinary Decision Guide for Infant Feeding Assessment  Version 1.[ADDRESS_1114664] contains four headings: gastrointestinal, nutritional, behavioral, and aerodigestive. Under each heading there is a list of observable symptoms that may warrant referral to a specialist provider in that area.  
 The main heading says , “Feeding Assessment Referral Guide”. The main subheading says , “Use the 
following checklist during the feeding evaluation to observe symptoms that may warrant referral to specialists.”  
 Under gastrointestinal, the observable symptoms are:  
• Frequent spi[INVESTIGATOR_322054]/vomiting during meal  
• Fussiness, crying, or arching during meal  
• Wheezing, stridor, cough, or hoarseness while eating  
• Gagging during meal  
• Burp s frequently while eating 
• Drools while eating  
• Avoidance or prioritizing of certain food textures  
Under aerodigestive, the observable symptoms are:  
• Gets red in the face while eating  
• Coughs during meal  
• Food/liquid comes out nose while eating  
• Gets tired and cannot finish eating  
• Breathes harder/faster while eating  
• Evidence of stridor v. stertor  
• Needs to pause during meal to catch breath  
• Watery eyes while eating  
Under behavioral, the observable symptoms are:  
• Refuses to eat  
• Whines, cries, or tantrums during meal  
• Insists on food being offered a specific way  
• Throws or pushes food away  
• Will not stay seated during meal  
• Throws or spi[INVESTIGATOR_807257]  
• Parent has to do something special to get child to eat  
• Parent and child have conflict during feeding  
• The parent appears stressed and overwhelmed during feeding  
Under nutrition, the observable symptoms are:  
• Appears underweight  
• Exclusion of entire food group 
• Eating only one texture of food during evaluation  
 At the bottom, the checklist says, “If the child has demonstrated any of these signs/symptoms while eating, referral to a medical specialist, in addition to your treatment, may be warranted.”

Providers will be sent the link to the version to which they are assigned.  
 Assignment will be based on the order of study entry. For example, the first SLP to enroll will receive case A first, the second SLP to enroll will receive case B first, etc. Similarly, the first OT to enroll will 
receive case A first, the second OT to enroll will receive case B first, etc.

8.2 SAFETY AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS  
While no obvious safety concerns are expected, provider responses to the survey will be monitored weekly for any concerning responses.  
   
8.3 ADVERSE EVENTS AND S ERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
8.3.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
 
Evaluation of an Interdisciplinary Decision Guide for Infant Feeding Assessment  Version 1.[ADDRESS_1114672] medical occurrence associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
8.3.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE ) or suspected ad verse reaction is considered "serious" if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse 
event, inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_512768], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the participant  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allerg ic bronchospasm 
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
8.3.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE E VENT  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERI TY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs ) not included in the protocol defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to describe severity.  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the participant’s daily 
activiti es.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe – Events interrupt a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or 
incapacitating.  Of note, the term  “severe” does not necessarily equate to “serious” .] 
  
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_807259] . The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. 
In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
 
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention and the AE.  
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
Evaluation of an Interdisciplinary Decision Guide for Infant Feeding Assessment  Version 1.0 
Protocol 20-2786 18 Feb 2022  
  16 The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_21190] ( AE) is expected or unexpected.  An 
AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with 
the risk  information previously described for the study intervention . 
8.3.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an adverse event (AE ) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during weekly review of survey responses.  All AEs will be captured on the appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes 
event description, date and time of survey response , PI’s asse ssment of severity,  and relationship to 
study product. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_807260] .  Events will be followed for outcome information until 
resolution . 
 
8.3.[ADDRESS_1114673] immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site 
investigator deems the event to be chronic or the participant is stable. Other supporting documentation 
of the event may be requested by [CONTACT_8704].

8.4.1  DEFINITION OF U NANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
Evaluation of an Interdisciplinary Decision Guide for Infant Feeding Assessment  Version 1.0 
Protocol 20-2786 18 Feb 2022  
  17 The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research  procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the 
participant population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a 
reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and  
• Suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
8.4.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems ( UPs) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) and t o the IRB and study sponsor . The UP  report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
number;  
• A detailed descr iption of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events ( SAEs) will be reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor 
within 7 da ys of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB and to the study sponsor within 7 days  of the 
investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
• All UPs should be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as required by [CONTACT_17347]’s 
written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head (or designee), and the Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) 7 days  of the IRB’s receipt of the rep ort of th e problem 
from the investigator.

9.2 SAMPLE SIZE  DETERMINATION  
This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Sample size was selected based on available funding and to achieve equal numbers 
in each group (group 1: case A then case B; group 2: case B then case A) as well as equal numbers of SLPs and OTs per group (group 1: 14 SLP, 14 OT. Gro up 2: 14 SLP, 14 OT).  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1114675] sizes will be 
reported.  
Covariates will be assessed to determine if they should be included in the statistical model. These will include years of experience and being an OT v SLP.  
Due to the small sample size and categorical variables, only nonparametric tests will be used.  
 
9.4.2  ANA LYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
For the following primary outcomes: degree of concordance between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ feeding therapy recommendations and degree of concordance between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ referral recommendations we have categorical data (2 groups – using tool and not using tool; 2 answers – yes or no). This is a repeated 
measure (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_807262] A and once for case B). Each case will be analyzed separately. Due to the categorical data and small sample, reporting will be descriptive. Chi square tests will also be run if determined to meet the required assumptions. For chi -square tests , p value and effect size will be 
reported. These will be independent and therefore, adjustment for multiple comparisons will not be 
pursued.  
 For the third primary endpoint, degree of concordance between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ specific specialist referral recommendations, descriptive statistics will be used due to the multiple categories, small counts, and 
small sample size. The percentage of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_807263] a particular provider will be compared among therapi[INVESTIGATOR_807246].  
 Across all analyses, missing data will be reported but not corrected for due to the small sample size. Participants who did not complete all survey items will not be included in analysis. Adjustment for multiple comparisons is considered unnecessary due to the small sample size and minimal use of inferential statistics.  
 
9.4.3  ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Evaluation of an Interdisciplinary Decision Guide for Infant Feeding Assessment  Version 1.0 
Protocol 20-2786 18 Feb 2022  
  20 For degree of concordance between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ feed ing therapy frequency recommendations we have 
categorical data (2 groups – using and not using the tool; 3 response categories – 1xweek, 2xweek, less 
than 1 time per week). This is a repeated measure (therapi[INVESTIGATOR_807262] A and once for case 
B). Each case will be analyzed separately. Due to the categorical data and small sample, reporting will be 
descriptive. Chi square tests will also be run if determined to meet the required assumptions. For chi -
square tests, p value and effect size will be rep orted.  
 For degree of concordance between therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ intervention target choices, descriptive statistics will be 
used due to the multiple categories (categorical data), small counts, and small sample size. The percentage of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_807263] a particular provider will be compared among therapi[INVESTIGATOR_807246]. This will be analyzed separately for case A and for case B.  
 For decision support tool acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, we have ordinal data (Likert scale). Ad ditionally, each score (acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility) has [ADDRESS_1114676] deviation will be calculated across participants to result in an overall mean rating fo r 
acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility.  
 Across all analyses, m issing data will be reported but not corrected for due to the small sample size. 
Participants who did not complete all survey items will not be included in analysis. Adjustment for multiple comparisons is considered unnecessary due to the small sample size  and minimal use of 
inferential statistics.  
 
9.4.4  SAFETY ANALYSES  
Survey responses will be monitored for any concerns responses and these will be reported.  
 
9.4.5  BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS  
Intervention groups will be compared on the basis of years of experience (in feeding, early intervention, and overall clinical practice), and years since graduation with their clinical degree. Due to the small sample size, inferential statistics will be trialed  (i.e. Mann -Whitney U), but may not be used if 
assumptions are not met for their appropriate use.

DMID Protocol 17- [ADDRESS_923663] frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the 
US. In 2015, approximately 1.5 million cases of chlamydia were reported to Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) from [ADDRESS_923664] of Columbia, but an estimated 2. 9 
million infections occur annually. Rectal Chlamydia trachomatis  (CT) infection  is the most 
common bacterial STI among MSM  in the US  [1], the population at highest risk for HIV infection. 
Therefore, effective treatment of rectal CT is a key  component of chlamydia control, and 
perhaps HIV prevention, for MSM. Studies in  diverse healthcare settings  have found  that 8 -12% 
of asymptomatic MSM  test positiv e for rectal CT [ 2-5].  
The 2015 CDC Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)  Treatment Guidelines for CT infection of 
any anatomic site recommend either a single dose of  azithromycin or a 7- day course of twice-
daily doxycycline. However, in practice, many clinicians  treat asymptomatic rectal CT with 
azithromycin rather than doxycycline due to the relative simplicity of a single -dose regimen, 
although this varies geographically across the US  [6]. The CDC’s  treatment recommendation is 
extrapolated from studies of azithromycin and doxycycline for the treatment of urogenital CT , 
but doxycycline may be more effective than azithromycin for the treatment of rectal CT . A well 
designed and conducted trial comparing the efficacy of the two recommended treatments could 
inform  CDC’s  STD Treatment Guidelines for chlamydia in MSM and clinical practice.  
2.[ADDRESS_923665] -
microbial interactions.  A study of chlamydial infection in mice found that doses of azithromycin 
that cured genital infections were ineffectual in eradicating gastrointestinal (GI) infections. This 
occurred despi[INVESTIGATOR_682139] . In contrast, 
doxycycli ne had similar efficacy in curing GI and genital tract infections  [7]. Second, some 
strains of CT may have evolved to be less susceptible to azithromycin. Although azithromycin resistance among CT has never been conclusively demonstrated, evolution of antimicrobial resistance remains a possibility. T hird, LGV, due to infection with L- serovar strains  of CT , 
differentially causes proctitis, and some studies suggest that LGV is under -detected [8]. 
Treatment with a single dose of azithromycin may be less effective than a 7- day regimen of 
doxycycline in the treatment of undetected LGV. Although these factors could explain the 
DMID Protocol 17- [ADDRESS_923666] [9]. Two potential explanations for the observed differences in observational studies 
include differential clinician prescription of azithromycin and doxycycline and different sexual behavior in patients who receive a single dose of medication v s. a 7-day course of medication.  
A placebo- blinded, randomized controlled trial is necessary to definitively compare the clinical  
efficacy of azithromycin v s. doxycycline for the treatment of rectal CT.  
 We hypothesize that doxycycline will be more effective than azithromycin in achieving microbiologic cure of rectal CT. T o test this , we will screen and enroll MSM diagnosed with 
rectal CT into a randomized, double- blinded, placebo- controlled trial of azithromycin vs. 
doxycycline. The primary study outcome will be microbiologic cure (negative  rectal CT NAAT  
result ) [ADDRESS_923667] 
therapy for chlamydial infections  and could include abdominal pain, allergic reaction, rash, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, photosensitivity , dysphasia, or other unforeseen events.  
The amount of lactose monohydrate that will be used for over -encapsulation and placebo is  less 
than the amount necessary to cause lactose intolerance symptoms in those with lactose intolerance.  Some subjects  may experience mild bloating.  
Potential risks due to collection of study rectal swabs may include temporary physical 
discomfort.   
The study procedures may inconvenience or cause discomfort in  subjects but will not add any 
substantial risk to health. Information concerning subjects ’ sexual history may provoke some 
minor psychological or emotional stress when requested.  
Participation in research may involve a loss of privacy. Subject  records will be kept as 
confidential as possible under the law. Individual identity will not be used in any reports or 
publications resulting from  this trial.

17 4 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a Phase 4 , multi-center , randomized, double -blinded, placebo- controlled trial  to compare 
the efficacy of azithromycin (Arm 1) vs. doxycycline (Arm 2) administered per CDC’s  STD 
Treatment  Guidelines for rectal CT in MSM. Subjects will be males aged ≥[ADDRESS_923670] 
12 months. Two types of subjects will be recruited:  
• Subjects  who have a confirmed positive rectal CT NAAT  result  detected through 
standard clinical screening and have not received  treatment will be offered initial 
information about the trial and, if consent is provided, will be screened for eligibility.  
• Subjects  identified as having high risk for rectal chlamydia, defined as either a)  having 
known contact [CONTACT_682157] 30 days 
or b) otherwise identified by a clinician as having an indication for empi[INVESTIGATOR_295894]. If pre-screened potentially eligible  (no antibiotics in the past 21 days), they will be asked to 
consent to defer empi[INVESTIGATOR_682140] N. gonorrhoeae (GC) are available. Subjects  who test positive for 
rectal CT and negative for GC will be asked to consent to continued study participation.  
 Subjects known to be HIV -positive will be in cluded. For this trial, HIV status will be based on 
subject report . Subjects who have not been previously diagnosed with HIV and who have not 
recently tested negative for HIV will be offered HIV testing per the standard clinical practice at each site. The trial will be conducted at two sites in  the US and will enroll up to 274 total 
subjects to achi eve 246 subjects  who contribute to the primary analysis .  
 
Eligible subjects who consent to participat e will be enrolled in the trial, which involves three 
scheduled visits over a 29- day period (Screening/Enrollment  on Day 1, Follow -up Visits on Day s 
15 and 29).  At Visit [ADDRESS_923671] ’s current rectal symptoms, sexual , 
STD and HIV history , and clinical and laboratory findings. Subjects will provide one baseline 
rectal swab for CT and LGV testing  (NAAT)  (clinician - or self-collected, to be obtained according 
to local clinic  standard operating procedures  (SOPs )). Subjects  who consent to collection and 
storage of swabs for future use will have two additional swabs collected by [CONTACT_15370] (one for 
storage in culture media and one frozen). All subjects  will be counseled on study drug side 
effects, randomized (1:1) to receive azithromycin and placebo doxycycline ( Arm 1 ) or 
doxycycline and placebo azithromyc in (Arm 2 ), and administered the full dose of azithromycin 
(or placebo)  plus one dose of doxycycline (or placebo)  in the clinic . Research staff will attempt 
to recruit the partners of enrolled subjects for screening visits by [CONTACT_682158] .  
 
At Visit 1, subjects wi ll be informed of the option to self- collect Visit 2 and/or Visit [ADDRESS_923672] 2019

18 those time points rather than return to the clinic (hereafter referred to as the mai l-in option). 
Subjects who opt for the mail -in option will receive supplies for specimen collection kit and 
instructions .   
 
Adherence to the study drugs will be assessed by  [CONTACT_682159] 1 ( or at retreatment within 48 hours, if applicable) , subject interview  at follow -up 
visit or phone interview, and pi[INVESTIGATOR_682141] (if any)  if the subject  returns to 
the clinic for  follow -up visits . At Visits 2 and 3, subjects will be asked to provide information 
about rectal symptoms, serious  adverse events  (SAEs),  concomitant medication use, and 
interim sexual, STD, and HIV history . Subjects  who return to the clinic will have  one rectal swab 
collected (clinician - or self -collected according to the subject’s preference)  for CT and LGV 
testing  (NAAT) .Those who consent to collection and storage of swabs for future use and return 
to the clinic for follow -up visits will have two additional swabs collected b y the clinician ( one for 
storage in culture media and one frozen) at each visit . Subjects who choose to self -collect rectal 
NAAT swabs outside the clinic will complete follow -up data collection by [CONTACT_682160] -up visits.   
 Subjects  with a positive or indeterminate rectal  CT NAAT result  from their final study visit (i.e., 
Visit 3  or Early Termination Visit) will be  contact[CONTACT_682161] a care provider in the general 
clinic for appropriate treatment. At that appointment, those subjects  will learn which treatment 
they received during the trial.  
 Oversight will be provided by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  that will review  data 
at specified times during the course of the study for subject and overall study progress  (as 
defined in the DSMB Charter ).  
 All laboratory testing performed after informed consent and enrollment will include NAAT for CT 
by [CONTACT_682162] 2® Assay (Hologic, Inc., San Diego, CA, [LOCATION_003]) and polymerase chain 
reaction ( PCR) assay for LGV at University of Washington (UW) Global Health STI Laboratory . 
 The duration of the trial for each subject  will be [ADDRESS_923673] 2019

participation in the trial 
5.3 Treatment Assignment Procedures 
5.3.1  Randomization Procedures  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive one of two active treatment s: azithromycin 250 mg x 
4 orally  as a single dose of 1 gram  (Arm 1) or doxycycline hyclate 100 mg orally  twice daily for 7 
days (Arm 2).  
The list of randomized treatment assignments  will be prepared by [CONTACT_682163] (SDCC)  and included in the enrollment module of the Emmes 
Corporation’s Internet Data Entry System (IDES) . Advantage eClinical® will assign each subject  
to a blinded treatment number from the list  after demographic  and eligibility data have been 
entered. Each site will have a supply of blinded study drug kits pre -labeled with treatment  
numbers, each containing sufficient doses to treat a subject  for [ADDRESS_923680] .  
Instructions for us ing the enrollment module are included in the IDES User’s Guide. Manual  
back -up randomization procedures are provided in the Manual of Procedures (MOP) for use in 
case the site temporarily loses Internet access, or the online enrollment system is  unavailable.  
The trial will use a site-stratified, permuted, blocked randomization scheme. Permuted block ed 
randomization is used to avoid the potential for serious imbalance in the number of subjects  
assigned to each group, which  can occur in simple randomization procedures.  
5.3.[ADDRESS_923681] to be 
completely unblinded to individual study drug assignments, as needed, to adequately assess 
SAEs . Refer to the MOP for unblinding procedures.  
Study drug will be prepared at the UW Harborview Medical Center (HMC) I nvestigational Drug 
Services (IDS ) in numbered, placebo- controlled  kits. All kits will look identical and contain an 
identical number of pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]. Emmes will provide an unblinded list identifying the active drug in each 
kit to the UW HMC IDS staff responsible for preparing study drug  kits. Clinicians, investigators, 
and all blinded staff will not have access to a list of treatment assignments receive d until after 
the trial has ended and analysis is completed.  
For any subjects who have a positive or indeterminate rectal CT NAAT result from their final 
study visit (i.e., Visit 3  or an Early Termination Visit ), a designated unblinded individual at each 
site will have access to an unblinded treatment report  that indicates the actual treatment 
received, which will be disclosed to the subject at an appointment with a care provider in the 
general clinic.  
5.3.3  Reasons for Withdrawal 
Subjects  may voluntarily withdraw their consent for further study participation at any time and for 
any reason without penalty or prejudice to future medical care. Subjects may be withdraw n from 
further study participation for the following reasons:  
• Medical disease or condition, or any new clinical finding for which continued participation, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_179262] (PI) or appropriate sub-
investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject , interfere with the subject ’s 
successful compl etion of th e trial, or interfere with the evaluation of responses  
• As deemed necessary by [CONTACT_7880]  [INVESTIGATOR_29353]- investigator for noncompliance 
or other reason  
• Termination of th e trial 
• The subject vomits within 2 hours of the initial dose and is not re- dosed within 48 hours  
• The subject vomits within 2 hours of  re-dosing azithromycin (or placebo) plus one 
doxycycline (or placebo)  capsule  
 Subjects may also voluntarily discontinue receiving any  study intervention for any reason. An 
investigator may also discontinue a subject  from receiving further study interventions.   
Withdrawal of subjects from analysis populations is discussed in Section [ADDRESS_923682] to follow -up after signing the informed consent form  (ICF) , 
randomization, and receipt of study drug  will not be replaced. Subjects who withdraw consent 
after signing the ICF  and randomization but before receipt of study drug  may be replaced.  
Subjects who withdraw their consent from further stu dy participation will not continue any study 
procedures and will no longer be contact[CONTACT_51095] -up. Subjects  who are withdrawn from 
further study participation by [CONTACT_7880] [INVESTIGATOR_29353]- investigator for any reason will not 
continue study procedures. However, if withdrawn after receiving at least one dose of study 
drug, subjects will be encouraged to complete the Early Termination Visit  (see Section 7.4) , 
including safety and efficacy evaluations.  
If symptoms of an SAE are continuing at the end of study participation, the subject will be given 
appropriate care under medical supervision outside of the trial and followed until the SAE is 
resolved or until the subjec t’s condition becomes stable.  
If subjects  fail to appear for a follow -up visit, extensive effort (e.g., three documented cont act 
attempts via phone calls, emails, etc., made on separate occasions and followed by a certified 
letter) will be made to locate or recall them or at least to determine their health status. Subjects  
who cannot be located after extensive effort will no longer be contact[CONTACT_51095] -up. These 
efforts will be documented in the subjec t’s records.    
5.3.5  Termination of Study  
Although the study sponsor has every intention of completing the trial, the sponsor reserves the 
right to terminate the trial at any time for clinical or administrative reasons. Reasons for study 
termination may include, but are not limited to, the DSMB ’s recommendation or DMID ’s 
discretion.

37 9 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
9.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Due to the safety profile of both drugs used in this trial, only SAEs (not non- serious  AEs) that 
occur during the subject’s participation in the trial will be collected.  
9.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing 
Safety Parameters 
9.2.1  Serious A dverse Events  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) :  
ICH E6 defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical  product regardless of its causal relationship to the study 
treatment. The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of study personnel during study 
visits and interviews of a study subject presenting for medical care.  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
• death,  
• a life-threatening AE*,  
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions, or  
• important medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12190], based upon appropriate medical judgment they may jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
DMID Protocol 17- [ADDRESS_923714] 2019 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________  
38 *An AE is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its 
occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
All SAEs will be:  
• Assessed for severity and relationship to study drug and alternate etiology (if not related 
to study drug) by a licensed study physician.  
• Recorded on the appropriate SAE form and eCRF . 
• Followed through resolution by a licensed study physician.  
• Reviewed and evaluated by [CONTACT_682182] (at one i nterim meeting 
and one final closeout meeting only, not ad hoc ) and the IRBs. 
Severity of Event:  All SAEs will be assessed by [CONTACT_19811] a protocol -defined grading 
system. For events not included in the protocol -defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to quantify intensity.  
• Mild: events require minimal or no treatment; do not interfere with subject’s  daily activities.  
• Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures ; may cause some interference with functioning.  
• Severe: events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug 
therapy or other treatment ; are usually incapacitating.  
Changes in the severity of an SAE should be documented to allow an assessment of the 
duration of the SAE at each level of intensity to be performed. S AEs characterized as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
Relationship to Study Drug : All SAEs must have their relationship to study drug assesse d 
using the terms: related or not related. In a clinical trial, study drug must always be suspect. To 
help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
• Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused the SAE. Reasonable 
possibility mea ns that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study 
drug and the SAE.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________  
40 9.4 Type and Duration of Follow -up of Subjects After Serious 
Adverse Events  
SAEs will be followed from the time of study treatment through resolution even if this extends 
beyond the study reporting period (i.e., the Day 29 visit). Resolution of an SAE is defined as the 
return to pretreatment status or stabilization of the condition with the expectation that it will 
remain chronic.  
Follow -up procedures, evaluations, and outcomes will be recorded on the appropriate DCF . 
9.5 Halting Rules  
Due to the safety profile  established by [CONTACT_682183] , the need for halting rules for 
safety outcomes is not deemed a requirement. Should the DMID Medical Monitor become aware of  any highly unusual , unanticipated patterns of rare events , he will be able  to stop 
enrollment and study treatments until the issue is fully resolved.  
9.6 Oversight by [CONTACT_682184] a DSMB , an independent group of experts that monitors su bjects 
and study progress  as outlined in the DSMB Charter and advises DMID appropriately . DSMB 
members will be separate and independent of study personnel participating in this trial ; should 
not have scientific, financial , or other conflict s of interest related to th is trial; and will have 
appropriate expertise to contribute to the interpretation of the data from this trial.  
The DSMB will operate under the rules of a DMID -approved charter that will be written at the 
DSMB’s organizational meeting. As defined in the charter, the DSMB will review data at 
specified times during the course of the study for subject and overall study progress . As an 
outcome of the efficacy review , the DSMB will make a recommendation as to the advisability of 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_587520] (due to compelling evidence that one of the treatments is more effective) 
or proceeding with study enrollment, and to continue, modify, or terminate the trial. 
DMID or the DSMB chair may convene the DSMB on an ad hoc  basis if there are immediat e 
concerns regarding observations during the trial. The DMID Medical Monitor will be responsible for reviewing SAEs in real time and determines if notification of the DSMB is required according 
to the protocol and the Charter .  
DMID Protocol 17- [ADDRESS_923716] at the 5% two-

10.[ADDRESS_923717] through the trial and the final analysis after the trial has been completed.  
O’Brien -Fleming boundaries will be used for the interim and final analyses to control the overall 
Type I error of the trial at 5% . The choice of O’Brien- Fleming is motivated by [CONTACT_682185], and to continue in the presence of a moderate or small interim difference. For the calculations, it was assumed that the interim analysis will occur when 50% of the planned number of primary analysis -eligible subjects have been enrolled and followed through Day 29.    
The sample size for the study was updated from the original target due to logistical and feasibility reasons.  The enrollment target is 274 subjects. Based on previous prospective 
studies of MSM recruited from the PHSKC STD clinic [ 10-13], it is anticipated that at least 90% 
of enrolled subjects will be eligible for the primary analysis population; therefore, it is expected that [ADDRESS_923718] generally ranged 95- 100% for doxycycline and 74-
92% for azithromycin [ 14-20]. The 246 primary -analysis -eligible subjects along with the O’Brien 
Fleming boundaries will provide 75- 80% power to detect a 10% difference in cure rates between 
treatments using conservative estimates of treatment -specific cure rates based on the literature 
(~95% cure rate for doxycycline and ~85% cure rate for  azithromycin). The study will have more 
than 80% power to detect a 10% difference across a range of cure rates of doxycycline and azithromycin consistent with rates calculated in a meta- analysis of the efficacy of azithromycin 
and doxycycline for the treatment of rectal chlamydia infection [9]. See Table [ADDRESS_923719] 2019 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

treatments detectable with total sample size of N = 246 and interim analysis at N = 123 
Cure Proportion

Doxycycline  Azithromycin  
95% 85% 75% 
96% 86% 79% 
97% 87% 83% 
98% 88% 87% 
99% 89% 92% 
    
As noted above, O’Brien Fleming boundaries are used to employ a conservative stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_682148]. Under a null hypothesis that the cure proportion of doxycycline and 
azithromycin are both 87%, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_682149] 1%. Under an alternative that the cure proportions of doxycycline and azithromycin are 
97% and 87%,  respectively, the probability of stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_682150] 23 %.  
It is important to note that the exact number of subjects eligible for the primary analysis at the 
interim and final analys es may vary from 123 and 246, respectively. It is expected that the 
actual variations from the assumptions made in the power calculations will be small. The overall Type I error of the O’Brien- Fleming methodology with only one interim look  is robust to small 
deviations in the timing of the interim  analysis and the exact number of subjects at the final 
analysis, though the attained power may drop slightly below 80%  [21, 22].  
10.3 Planned Interim Analyses 
10.3.1  Safety Review  
The DSMB will review SAEs at the interim  efficacy review (see below) . 
10.3.2  Efficacy Review  
 The DSMB will review a formal analysis of efficacy when approximately half (N= 123) of subjects 
have contributed primary outcome measure data. At this time, an unblinded analysis of the 
DMID Protocol 17- [ADDRESS_923720] 2019 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
 
_________________________________________________________________________________________________  
43 primary outcome measure will be performed by [CONTACT_682186] (details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP] ). This interim 
analysis is intended to inform  the DSMB ’s recommendation to the sponsor only whether the trial 
meets the criterion for stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_4428] (null hypothesis is or is not rejected).  
10.4 Final Analysis Plan 
A separate SAP document will be generated that will contain the details of the analyses. This 
section outlines the major components of the analyses.  
10.4.1  Analysis Populations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety Analyses 
Safety Population:  This analysis population includes all randomized subjects who receive at 
least one dose of study drug. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Efficacy Analyses 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population:  This analysis population includes all randomized subjects.  
Complete Case (CC) Population : This analysis population includes all randomized subjects 
who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria at enrollment, have a positive baseline rectal CT NAAT result, and have post -baseline microbiologic data available. For analyses at Day 15, 
microbiologic data must be available from the Day [ADDRESS_923721] be available from the Day 29 visit.    
The CC population will be the primary efficacy analysis population.  
Per-Protocol (PP) Population: This analysis p opulation includes all randomized subjects who 
meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria at enrollment, have a positive baseline rectal CT NAAT result, have post -baseline microbiologic data available, sufficiently adhere to the study drug 
regimen (defined below ), and do not experience any of the following after enrollment and before 
a particular visit (Day 15 for analys es at Day 15, and Day 29 for analyses at Day 29):  
• Receive treatment for a symptomatic STD other than CT  
• Exposure to an STD  
• Receive treatment with an antibiotic active against CT  
• Have condomless receptive anal sex  
DMID Protocol 17- [ADDRESS_923722] is considered sufficiently adherent with study treatment if he takes the initial dose of 
azithromycin (or placebo) and initial dose of doxycycline (or placebo) in the clinic ( or at 
retreatment within 48 hours, if applicable) and at least 9 additional doses  of doxycycline (or 
placebo) within 10 days (inclusive) of the initial completed dose (or of the completed retreatment dose, if applicable). Assessment of subject adherence to study treatment is described in Section 6.4. 
Alternative definitions of compliance and a nalyses of adherence will be explored; detail s will be 
provided in the S AP. 
Before unblinding, a blinded case review committee will review subjects with a reported 
concomitant infection/disease/procedure that may interfere with study drug, use of c oncomitant 
medications or products that may interfere with study drug, significant protocol deviations, and other events that may impact study drug effectiveness or study analyses. On a case- by-case 
basis, the case review committee will determine if each subject will be included in the PP 
population, if and when a subject should be censored or removed from PP analyses, and/or any 
other analytical requirements for the subject . The committee will be blinded to both treatment 
group and outcome status  for each  case. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Considerations for all Analyses 
In the unlikely event of an error in randomization or study drug administration, subjects will be grouped by [CONTACT_682187], CC, and PP analyses but will be grouped by [CONTACT_682188] I TT analyses.  
Subjects who receive treatment with an antibiotic active against CT  for any reason before a 
particular post -baseline visit (Day 15 for analys es at Day 15, and Day 29 for analyses at Day 
29) will be included in ITT and CC analyses as microbiologic failures and reviewed by [CONTACT_682189] . 
Other subgroup analyses may be performed; details will be provided in the S AP.

45 10.4.3  Safety Analysis Plan  
Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, severity, and type of SAEs . Safe ty variables 
will be tabulated and presented for all subjects in the Safety population, grouped by [CONTACT_3148].  
SAEs will be coded by [CONTACT_61132]® for preferred term and system organ class. The  proportion of 
subjects with SAEs in aggregate, as well as by  [CONTACT_61132]® categories, will be computed. The 
number of SAEs will be reported by a detailed listing showing the type, MedDRA® coding, 
relevant dates  (treatment dosing dates and S AE onset and resolution dates), severity, 
relatedness, and outcome for each SAE. 
10.4.4  Efficacy Analysis Plan  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Efficacy Analysis 
To compar e the efficacy of azithromycin vs. doxycycline for treatment of rectal CT in MSM , the 
number and proportion of subjects  with microbiologic cure at Visit 3 will be summarized overall 
and by [CONTACT_3148]. The point estimates for the treatment -specific proportions and difference in 
proportions as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals  (CIs)  will be reported. A test of 
hypothesis will be conducted using Pearson Chi -Square test at the 5% two- sided significanc e 
level to formally compare the treatment arms. The primary analysis will be performed in the CC analysis population and repeated as a secondary analysis in the ITT and PP analysis populations.  Additional subgroup analyses may be performed and will be specified in the S AP. 
Microbiologic cure will be determined from the rectal CT NAAT  result . For the primary analysis, 
microbiologic cure at Visit 3 will be defined using the criteria in Table 2 below.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________  
50 2. The Screening and Enrollment Informed Consent is for participation in the full study.  
Before any study procedures are performed, subjects will receive a comprehensive explanation 
of the proposed study procedures and study interventions/products, including the nature and 
risks of the trial, alternate therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], any known adverse events ( AEs), the approved status of 
the components, and the other elements that are part of obtaining proper informed consent. Subjects  will also receive a detailed explanation of the proposed use and disclosure of their 
protected health information, including specifically their specimens. Subjects will be allowed 
sufficient time to consider participation in the trial  and, after having the nature and risks of the 
trial explained to them, will have the opportunity to discuss the trial with their family, friends, or legally authorized representative, or think about it before  agreeing to participate.  
Depending whether the subject has a confirme d/unconfirmed diagnosis of rectal CT, they  will be 
given the appropriate form  of the  ICF describing in detail the study interventions/products, study 
procedures, risks, and possible benefits. The ICF  must not include any exculpatory statements. 
ICF will be  IRB-approved, and subjects  will be asked to read and review the appropriate 
document. Upon reviewing the appropriate document, the site PI (or designee) will explain the research study to subjects and answer any questions that may arise. Subjects must sig n the 
ICF before starting any study procedures/interventions being done specifically for the trial, 
including administering study drug . 
DMID will provide the site PI, in writing, any new information that significantly affects the subjects’ risk of receivin g the study drug. This new information will be communicated by [CONTACT_47808] [INVESTIGATOR_682154]. The 
ICF will be updated, and subjects  will be re -consented per IRB requirements, if necessar y. 
Study personnel may employ IRB -approved recruitment efforts before  obtaining the subject’s  
consent; however, before any study procedures are performed to determine protocol eligibility, an ICF must be signed. Subjects will be given a copy of the ICF(s) that they sign.  
By [CONTACT_682192] (if applicable) and Screening and Enrollment ICF , subjects agree to 
complete all evaluations required by [CONTACT_20767], unless the subject withdraws voluntarily or is

Populations) 
The study population in this trial will include male adults (defined as male sex at birth)  who meet 
the subject inclusion/ exclusion criteria, regardless of religion , race , or ethnic background. STD 
treatment guidelines recommend routine screening for rectal chlamydia in MSM. Routine 
screening in women and men who have sex with women only is not recommended or routinely done in practice.  Therefore, the study will exclude women and children. Should the outcome of 
this trial be deemed acceptable, additional trials may be initiated in other populations.

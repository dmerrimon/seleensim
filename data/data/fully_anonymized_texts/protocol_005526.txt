Protocol 9.0, 02/19/[ADDRESS_1197367] infection occurring in males (hereafter, male UTI) is a common infection 
among both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859200]. Most patients are treated in the outpatient 
setting, with only a minority  requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]1, 2. Data from the [ADDRESS_1197368] injury (85% male), [ADDRESS_1197369] of 
duration of treatment for male UTI on efficacy; accordingly, the conventional 
recommendation to treat for [ADDRESS_1197370] relevant antimicr obials ; consequently,  few reliably active oral 
agents are available for UTI therapy, which is often initiated empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675], before culture 
results are known. Second, Clostridium difficile  infection, which is almost invariably 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_859201] u se, is increasingly frequent and severe9, 10. 
Increasing antimicrobial resistance among Gram -negative bacilli.  Antimicrobial resistance 
among Gram -negative bacilli, a major public health threat, has attracted considerable 
attention from governmental organizations, professional societies, and leaders in the field of 
infectious diseases11. Perversely, as resistance among Gram -negative bacilli has increased, 
the development of new antimicrobials that target these organisms has decreased11.  
The problem of Gram -negative resistance is particularly relevant for treating UTI, because 
the vast majority of UTIs are caused by [CONTACT_859226] -negative bacilli, in particular 
Escherichia coli , but also Klebsiella species, Enterobacter  species, and others8, 12. Guidelines 
recommend t hat when the local prevalence of susceptibility to a particular drug among 
uropathogens falls below 80%, that drug should no longer be used as empi[INVESTIGATOR_859202]13, 14. Currently, many locations, including the MVAMC , have E. coli susceptibility rates 
of only 65 -70% for both ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim -sulfamethoxazole (TMP -SMZ) 
(MVAMC antibiogram, January 2012 through June 2012). These drugs are traditional 
cornerstones of UTI treatment in the ambulatory setting because of their excellent oral 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/[ADDRESS_1197371] inferior efficacy (β -lactams, 
fosfomycin)17, 18 and/or achieve low tissue drug levels (nitrofurantoin, fosfomycin)13, 18, 
limiting their appeal for UTI therapy, especially for patients with fever or clinical 
manifestat ions suggesting pyelonephritis13, 18.  
The rising prevalence of resistance to ciprofloxacin and TMP -SMZ has led providers to use 
broader -spectrum empi[INVESTIGATOR_138827], such as a parenteral dose of a more predictably active 
agent combined with empi[INVESTIGATOR_859203] -SMZ. This practice ad ds to the 
selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance, thereby [CONTACT_859227].  
Increased incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile  infection . Beginning in the early 
2000’s, an incre asing incidence and severity of C. difficile  infection was observed, first in 
Canada and subsequently worldwide9, 10, 19, 20. Multiple factors have been proposed to explain 
these increases, including increased antimicrobial use, emergence of a new fluoroquinolone -
resistant strain of C. difficile  during a ti me of increased fluoroquinolone use, increased 
sporulation and toxin production by [CONTACT_859228][INVESTIGATOR_498310], and better recognition and diagnosis 
of C. difficile  infection on the part of clinicians9, 10. Whatever the explanation, C. difficile  
now rivals methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus as the leading cause of nosocomial 
infections21, and is also increasingly prevalent in the community22. Thus, efforts to decrease 
its incidence, including through reduced antimicrobial use, are urgently nee ded.  
Relationship between antimicrobial use, antimicrobial resistance, and C. difficile  infection . 
The relationship between antimicrobial use and subsequent antimicrobial resistance is 
complicated. First, although some patient -level studies have demonstra ted the development 
of resistance during or after receipt of antimicrobial therapy23-25, in clinical practice the link 
between past antimicrobial u se and subsequent infection with a drug -resistant organism is 
difficult to prove. Additionally, most patients in whom a resistant organism emerges do not 
develop a subsequent drug -resistant infection, but rather become carriers of resistant 
organisms as pa rt of their normal bacterial microbiota. Because carriage of resistant 
microorganisms is a clinically silent phenomenon, this is an under -recognized harm of 
antimicrobial use. However, the fecal microbiota serves as the source of many infections, 
including  UTIs. In addition, microorganisms can spread easily among household contacts, 
thus increasing the population at risk for infection with a resistant organism26, 27. Countries 
with high levels of antimicrobial use typi[INVESTIGATOR_859204], as compared with countries with lower 
levels of use28, 29. Similarly, individual centers have documented a temporal relationship 
between antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance, with increased use being followed 
shortly thereafter by a corresponding increase in resistance30. 
Antimicrobial use is also closely linked to C. difficile  infection, almost a ll cases of which are 
preceded by [CONTACT_859229]. Increased antimicrobial use is associated with increased 
C. difficile  infection31, 32, and reduced antimicrobial use has been used successfully to combat 
outbreaks of C. difficile  infection33-35. Accordingly, a joint Clinical Practice Guideline for C. 
difficile  infection from the Society for H ealthcare Epi[INVESTIGATOR_859205] 9.0, 02/19/[ADDRESS_1197372] to decrease the incidence of C. difficile  infection36.  
In summary , antimicrobial use is associated with increases in antimicrobial resistance and C. 
difficile  infection; therefore, effective strategies to minimize unnecessary antimicrobial use 
are urge ntly needed. One potential method to decrease unnecessary antimicrobial use is to 
define the minimal effective treatment duration for various diseases, and to use this minimal 
duration routinely. This approach has been successfully applied  to other infecti ous diseases, 
including ventilator -associated tracheitis23, ventilator -associ ated pneumonia24, and 
cellulitis37. For these disorders, shorter -duration treatment performed as well as longer -
duration treatment, and in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_859206] -resistant microorg anisms, with or without a trend toward lower mortality -
-without any reduction in efficacy. For male UTI, if [ADDRESS_1197373] a 
randomized clinical trial to investigate whether 7 days of antimic robial treatment is non -
inferior to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment for men with a UTI.  
 
1.b. Preliminary studies and current status  
Historically, UTIs in both males and females were treated with longer courses of 
antimicrobials than are commonly used today, ranging from 7 days for simple cystitis  (i.e., 
bladder infection or lower -tract disease), to up to 6 weeks for pyelonephritis (i.e., kidney 
infection or upper -tract disease), which is more serious but also comparatively uncommon38. 
UTI treatment has been studied much more extensively in women than in men; consequently, 
optimal treatment durations are more clearly defined for wome n than for men13. In women, 
cystitis can be treated effectively with 3 days of a fluoroquinolone or TMP -SMZ, 5 days of 
nitrofurantoin, or a single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine; likewise, pyelonephritis can be 
treated effectively with [ADDRESS_1197374],  including the prostate gland, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_4046], and seminal vesicles, involvement of which is hypothesized to necessitate 
longer -duration therapy, since they may serve as sanctuaries or reservoirs from which 
residual bacteria can emerge and cause a recurrent in fection6. Also complicating efforts to 
identify the optimal treatment duration in men is the broader range of entities t hat constitute 
the full spectrum of male UTI. Such syndromes range from simple cystitis (manifested as 
voiding symptoms in the absence of constitutional manifestations, including fever), to febrile 
UTI (voiding symptoms with documented fever), to pyeloneph ritis (fever with flank pain, 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
6 
 with or without voiding symptoms). Finally, UTIs can be categorized as complicated vs. 
uncomplicated. Although consensus is lacking as to which specific conditions define a UTI 
as being “complicated,” the accepted underlying p rinciple is that these are factors that, when 
present, make UTI more likely to occur, more difficult to treat successfully, and less 
predictable as to microbiological etiology7, 8, 40. Published reviews have recommended 
longer -duration treatment for complicated male UTI, but because these recommendations are 
based largely on expert opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], and because of disagreement  as to what constitutes a 
complicated UTI, th ey confuse more than clarify the issue of optimal treatment duration.  
Previous clinical trials . The most robust evidence for treatment duration in the field of male 
UTI comes from a non -blinded Scandinavian trial of 114 men with febrile UTI who were 
random ized to receive 14 vs. 28 days of ciprofloxacin4. All patients experienced resolution of 
signs and symptoms of infection  during therapy, and cure rates (defined as remaining 
symptom -free for two weeks after treatment cessation) were not significantly different 
between groups (92% vs. 97%, respectively)4. Notably, however, treatment durations less 
than [ADDRESS_1197375] men diagnosed with UTI are afebrile, but instead  experience new onset of dysuria, 
frequency, and/or supra -pubic tenderness41. The presence of fever is thought to represent 
some component of invasive disease, which presumably can be localized within the prostate, 
kidney, or other tissues, although in practice the actual primary focus is rarely sought or 
define d, since such knowledge confers no known clinical benefit. Thus, the finding that [ADDRESS_1197376] injury patients, the 60 subjects (85% male, all without fever) were randomized to 
receive 3 vs. 14 days of c iprofloxacin 5. Although clinical cure (defined as resolution of 
symptoms by 19 -23 days after treatment initiation) was not s ignificantly different between 
the 3 and 14 -day treatment groups (63% vs. 53%, respectively), relapse was significantly 
more common in the 3 -day group (33% vs. 0%; P = .001)5. This suggests that [ADDRESS_1197377] injuries, and perhaps also --
although this has not been specifically studied -- in other men.  
Previous observational  studies . Observational data indicate that in practice the treatment 
duration used for male UTI varies significantly, and may influence the likelihood of both 
recurrence and adverse events. At the MVAMC,  we retrospectively examined the records of 
225 patie nts (90% male) diagnosed with UTI in 2007 -8 for (i) appropriateness of the 
diagnosis and the associated treatment duration and (ii) clinical outcome42. Treatment 
durations ranged from 3 to 14 days among men and women alike. Notably, among the 152 
men with complicated UTI, recurrence was significan tly more common among those treated 
for only 3 -7 days, compared with 10 -14 days (35% vs. 17%; P = .02)42. This indicates that 
for men with complicated UTI (75% of the study population), shorter -duration therapy may 
predispose to recurrent infection.  
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
7 
 In a separate study using VA administrative data for FY2009, we identified 33,336 unique 
male veterans treated for UTI, defined as having a diagnostic code for UTI combined with a 
prescription for an antimicrobial typi[INVESTIGATOR_859207] 3. Of these men, 35% received 7 or 
fewer days of treatment, whereas the remaining 65% received more than 7 days of treatment. 
Recurrence rates were not appreciably different between patients receiving shorter - vs. 
longer -duration treatment (3.9% vs. 4.2%, respectively, P = .16). However, subsequent C. 
difficile  infection was significantly more common among pati ents receiving longer -duration 
treatment. That is, whereas in the total population C. difficile  infection occurred in  144 
(0.4%) of the 33,336 UTI patients, it occurred in only 0.3% of patients receiving shorter -
duration (≤ 7d) treatment, compared to 0.5% of those receiving longer -duration (> 7d) 
treatment (P = .02). With multivariable adjustment for age, Charlson comorbidity score, and 
UTI-specific comorbidities (prostatic hypertrophy, urinary calculi, etc), a borderline 
significant trend persisted toward increased C. difficile  infection with treatment durations 
greater than 7 days (odds ratio 1.42, 95% confidence interval 0.97 to 2.07). Thus, longer -
duration therapy was not associated with a reduction in recurrence, but may be associated 
with increased C. difficile  infection.  
Adverse drug events . Adverse drug events are an increasingly recognized consequence of 
antimicrobial use. Using active surveillance, the percentage of antimicrobial -treated subjects 
who report adverse events has been as high as 30%15-17. Commonly reported adverse events 
are generally mild, and include nausea, diarrhea , headache, and dizziness.  However, more 
serious adverse drug events, including allergy, C. difficile  infection, and interactions with 
other medications also occur with antimicrobial use, and are frequent enough such that 
antimicrobials are the cause of u p to 20% of adverse drug events diagnosed in emergency 
departments43. Although some adverse drug events, such as anaphylaxis, are unlikely to be 
affected by [CONTACT_277798], many others, including nausea, diarrhea, C. difficile  infection, 
headache, and dizziness, conceivably could be reduced or avoided  by [CONTACT_859230] -duration 
therapy.  The issue of adverse drug events has become more important given th e recent 
warning by [CONTACT_859231] 
(http://www.fda.gov/Dr ugs/DrugSafety/ucm500143.htm ). Thus, determining the shortest 
possible treatment duration for male UTI, a common cause of fluoroquinolone use, is 
increasingly important.  
In summary, the available observational and clinical trial evidence indicates that for  male 
UTI [ADDRESS_1197378]

intestinal carriage of antimicrobial -resistant Gram -negative bacilli, recurrence of 
symptomatic UTI, and adverse drug events.  
 
2.b. Summary of s tudy description  
The study was initially proposed as a single site  study , conducted at the Minneapolis VA 
Health Care System , which includes the Minneapolis VA Medical Center and the affiliated  
Community Based Outpatient Clin ics(CBOCs) . To address slow enrollment, a second site 
(the Michael E. DeBakey Veterans Affairs Medical Center [MEDVAMC] and their affiliated 
CBOCs) has bee n approved by [CONTACT_859232]. Any changes to the protocol 
and consent will be initiated by [CONTACT_978], and MEDVAMC  IRB approval must be sought prior 
to implementing changes at that site, except when necessary to eliminate apparent immediate 
hazard s to the subject . To minimize the possibility that the decision to participate is 
influenced by [CONTACT_859233], every effort will be made to enroll 
patients prior to their being prescribed antimicrobial treatment.  This will be d one by [CONTACT_859234] -managers in the  clinic s and by [CONTACT_859235] . Additionally, because we are intervening only on treatment duration, 
and all enrolled patients will receive at least [ADDRESS_1197380] 
completed 7 days of treatment. Thus, although we plan to enroll the majority of patients at 
the time of initiating therapy, we will be able to recruit sufficient numbers of subjects without 
needing to maintain the multiple shifts of study personnel typi[INVESTIGATOR_859208], night, or weekend tours.  
Potential subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_859236] , and by [CONTACT_859237] /reports  from the pharmacy service  
regarding new UTI pres criptions  (if such reports are able to be generated) . Nurse managers 
or physicians will add study coordinator as a signer on CPRS record and give patient an “opt 
out” flyer when p atients with symptoms of dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, hematuria, 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/[ADDRESS_1197381] of 
patients newly assigned any of these codes, i.e., the p otential subjects, and their medical 
records to determine (i) the validity of the UTI diagnosis and (ii) whether the patient meets 
eligibility criteria, as detailed below.  
Patients who pass this screen will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], will receive a brief study descript ion, and 
will be invited to a study visit at which study participation will be further discussed. The visit 
must occur before the patient completes 7 days of treatment  and will be conducted in person 
at the participating study site or via mail . Patients wi ll be asked to bring their current 
antimicrobial with them , if they meet with study staff in person . At the visit, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be verified, any questions will be answered, and written 
informed consent will be obtained. Patients at the  MVAMC (and possibly later at the 
MEDVAMC) will also be invited to participate in a sub -study that investigates the effect of 
treatment duration on the intestinal carriage of antimicrobial -resistant Gram -negative bacilli 
(hereafter, resistance sub -study). After providing consent, subjects will be randomized to 7 
vs. 14 days of antimicrobial treatment (of the same agent their provider prescribed for them), 
and will exchange  days 8 -14 of  their current medication for a special medication supply 
provided by [CONTACT_138314]. All medications provided by [CONTACT_859238]’s research pharmacy for disposal  when possible . Patients who 
complete study visit via mail, will be instructed to dispose of days [ADDRESS_1197382] in it their UTI symptoms and any potential adverse drug 
events, to facilitate accurate recall during follow -up.  
The special medication su pply to be given to the subjects will be a 7-day pi[INVESTIGATOR_859209]  a sufficient supply of medication to complete a 14 -day course of treatment when 
combined with the clinically prescribed medication, which will be used for days 1 -7. For 
example, a patient with a study visit that falls on day 4 of treatment will take their clinically 
prescribed antimicrobials through day 7 , and will complete treatment using the 7-day supply 
of study medication  for days 8 -14. We will enroll only patients treated initi ally with 
ciprofloxacin and TMP -SMZ, which are used to treat over 90% of male VA patients with 
UTI 3. In addition to being the most frequently used medications for male UTI, both agents 
are highly bioavailable with oral administration, and achieve excellent penetration into the 
male genitourinary tract (6, 8 ). Study medications (both acti ve antimicrobial and placebo) 
will be different in appearance from clinically prescribed medication . Both subjects and 
investigators will be blinded to duration of active antimicrobial therapy.  Patients who cannot 
attend the  study visit in person will have the medication for days [ADDRESS_1197383] receive s the signed consent and HIPAA 
authorization  forms . 
After enrollment, subjects will be contact[CONTACT_859239] a bout the scheduled day of 
medication completion, and again at days 7, 14, and 28 (± 2) after medication completion. 
On the day of medication cessation, study staff will verify medication adherence (by [CONTACT_859240] 9.0, 02/19/2019  
10 
 report) and will inquire regarding the presence  of (i) UTI symptoms, (ii) signs or symptoms 
of C. difficile  infection, (iii) other adverse drug events, and (iv) possible infectious 
complications (retreatment, receipt of care outside the VA system, etc.). Adverse drug events 
will be elicited first via a n open -ended question, then by [CONTACT_859241] a 
list of typi[INVESTIGATOR_694802] -related adverse drug events symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, dizziness, rash, thrush, and headache. Similar assessments (excluding medication 
adhere nce) will be performed at 7, 14, and 28 days after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_14930].  
Resolution of UTI symptoms, the primary outcome, will be assessed 7 and 14 (± 2) days after 
completing medication. However, after study completion and unblinding of treatment 
allocation, the outcome assessment corresponding to [ADDRESS_1197384] -treatment call, subjects in the 
resistance sub -study will be reminded to obtain a s tool swab and to return it using the 
provided mailer. After the final (28d) follow -up call, subjects will have completed their 
participation in this study. If at any time subjects report new or unresolved UTI symptoms, or 
symptoms consistent with C. diffic ile infection or other adverse drug events, they will be 
directed to seek medical care from their primary care provider or the MVAMC or 
MEDVAMC Emergency Department.  
A 3-member data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will be formed to oversee the safety of 
this trial, assisted by a biostatistician with experience in clinical trials. Under the direction of 
the DSMB, the biostatistician will conduct 2 interim analyses, when approximately 33% and 
66% of the planned [ADDRESS_1197385] been evaluated for the primary endpoint. An alpha -
spending function approach as described by [CONTACT_290941] & DeMets is proposed44, testing for both 
non-inferiority and futility. Additionally, rates of adverse events in the treatment groups will 
be monitored by [CONTACT_4318], and reported to the MVAMC institutional review board.  
After enrollment and follow -up are concluded, an d laboratory testing complete, results will 
be analyzed using a per -protocol analysis, with subjects analyzed according to which 
treatment they received. An intention -to-treat analysis will be performed as a secondary 
analysis. We will test our primary hyp othesis that [ADDRESS_1197386] ive antimicrobial therapy. For the purposes of statistical power 
calculation, treatment inferiority is defined as >10% efficacy between treatment groups. A 
sample size of 290 subjects (145/group) was calculated, using a one -sided alpha level of 
0.025 and p ower of 85%, to allow detection of a minimum clinically significant absolute 
difference of 10% (e.g., 90% for 14 -day treatment, vs. 80% for 7 -day treatment). To adjust 
for potential loss of subjects to follow -up, we initially increased our enrollment goal by 10% 
(29 subjects), for a total sample size of [ADDRESS_1197387] since opted to remove this 10% margin 
as there has been no loss to follow -up to date.  
Both treatment groups will be assumed to be superior to no treatment, based on prior studies 
of UTI demonst rating that spontaneous cure occurs in a minority (7 -28%) of subjects45, 46. 
Accordingly, it would be unethical to include a placebo -only treatment group.

2.c. Details of specific study areas  
Selection of treatment duration . Our decision to compare 7 vs. 14 days treatment duration 
was based on prior studies4, 5, 15, the range of current expert recommendations7, 8, 47, and 
current practice within the VA system (unpublished data)4. The choice of [ADDRESS_1197388]. As outlined in the “prior 
clinical trials” section above, 14 days was the shorter duration arm in the Swedish stud y that 
found no significant efficacy difference between 14 vs. 28 days of treatment4. Also, 14 days 
frequently appears  in reviews as the upper -limit of recommended treatment duration for male 
UTI7, 8, 40, 47. Finally, among 33,000 male UTI epi[INVESTIGATOR_859210] 2009, only a small minority (8%) received more than [ADDRESS_1197389] injury patients showed a statistically significant 
increased risk of symptomatic recurrence among subjects receiving 3 days of treatment, we 
believe that there is not clinical equipoise between 3 and 14 days treatment duration. This 
belief is reinforced by [CONTACT_859242] -duration treatment (as discussed above), and the 
fact tha t experts typi[INVESTIGATOR_859211] 3 -day 
therapy (which is widely accepted as appropriate for women with uncomplicated cystitis) for 
treating male UTI, and even then only in young, otherwise healthy men with no complicating 
conditions40. 
Although [ADDRESS_1197390] on resistance selection, C. difficile  infection, and other adverse drug events of a 4 -day 
(29%) redu ction in treatment duration is likely to be less than with a 7 -day (50%) reduction. 
Therefore, we selected 7 days for the shorter -duration treatment arm.  
Blinding . Because our primary outcome is subjective (i.e., patient symptom reports), we are 
planning t o blind participants, investigators, and clinicians to the duration of active treatment, 
to minimize potential bias that could be introduced if patients knew that they were receiving 
shorter -duration treatment. There are difficulties inherent to this appro ach. First, since we are 
proposing to randomize subjects only to different treatment durations (not to different 
antimicrobials), we are not in control over which antimicrobials will be prescribed. 
Fortunately, 90% of diagnosed outpatient male UTIs in the VA system, both nationally and at 
the MVAMC, are treated with ciprofloxacin (65%) or TMP -SMZ (25%)3. The remaining 
10% are treated with a wide variety of agents, including nitrofurantoin, cephalexin, 
amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, etc. We opted to include only patients receiving 
ciprofloxacin and TMP -SMZ, since the other antimicrob ials are used so infrequently that no 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
12 
 valid outcome comparisons could be made, and some are dosed more than the twice -daily 
ciprofloxacin and TMP -SMZ, increasing the burden on our research pharmacy.  
To achieve double -blinding, all patients will take their clinically prescribed medications on 
days 1 -7. However, all patients will receive study medication for days 8 -14. Specifically, all 
patients will be given a supply of medication that is different in appearance from their 
clinically prescribed medication fo r days 8 -14. This different -appearing medication will be 
either:  
1) active antibiotic (ciprofloxacin or TMP/SMZ, based on what they were initially 
prescribed) from an alternate manufacturer, different in both color and imprint from the 
clinically prescrib ed drug, or  
2) a placebo tablet, similar in size to both the antimicrobials (approximately 1 gram), that 
will be provided by [CONTACT_859243], New Mexico.   
Thus, all subjects will receive pi[INVESTIGATOR_859212] [ADDRESS_1197391] the patient 
to use their clinically supplied drug for days 1 -7. Those for the shorter -duration subjects will 
contain placebo  for days 8 -14, with again the clinically supplied drug used for days 1 -7.  
The logistics of blin ding are as follows: at enrollment, the study coordinator will notify the 
pharmacy that a patient has been enrolled, and whether ciprofloxacin or TMP -SMZ is being 
used. Since we are stratifying based on catheter use (see below), the coordinator will inform  
the pharmacy to use the randomization schedule appropriate to the patient’s catheter status 
and antimicrobial received. Working from this randomization schedule, the pharmacy will 
send a prepared container with study drug for days [ADDRESS_1197392], which reviews all study -related 
serious adverse events. The effectiveness of blinding will be assessed by [CONTACT_859244] 7 days after completing the study medication.  
Randomization.  Randomization will be used to ensure that baseline characteristics, including 
any potential confounders, are equally distributed between the 2 treatment groups. To ensure 
relati vely equal sample size between the shorter and longer therapy duration groups, block 
randomization will be used. However, since the proposed sample size is 290 subjects, it is 
possible that uncommon factors may be unevenly distributed with a simple 1:1 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
13 
 randomization plan. Accordingly, we plan to stratify our randomization by [CONTACT_859245], a potential confounder that occurs in approximately 10% of male UTI 
patients at the MVAMC  (unpublished data). This will create [ADDRESS_1197393] opted to forego 
including patients with febrile UTI. Since less than 2% of subjects treated in the outpatient 
setting for male UTI a re febrile (unpublished data), this should not significantly affect our 
enrol lment.  
Sample size calculations . To determine an appropriate sample size, we first established the 
minimum significant difference in the primary outcome (resolution of UTI symptom s) that 
would be clinically relevant. Literature review identified UTI studies that used absolute 
differences of 10% to 20% for the minimum significant difference4, 15, 49. Separately, we 
queried four international UTI experts as to what difference in treatment success they would 
view as clinically significant. The range of their responses was also 10 -20%, with a mean of 
12.5%.  Using the conservative lower -limit (10%) as the minimum significant difference the 
propos ed study should be able to detect, and a percentage of subjects experiencing resolution 
of symptoms  with 14 days therapy of 90%4, we then calculated a total sample size of [ADDRESS_1197394] such a difference with 85% power, using a one -sided al pha of 
0.025. Accordingly, a group size of 145 subjects (290 total) would provide 85% power to 
detect a 10% absolute between -group difference  in the primary outcome (i.e., 90% vs. 80%). 
As mentioned, the  additional 10% of patients originally built in to ac count for loss to follow -
up is considered unnecessary, as there have been no losses to follow -up at the first interim 
analysis.  
The above calculation assumes a conservative 90% for the outcome of resolution of UTI 
symptoms. However, in the trial of men wit h febrile UTI, resolution occurred in 92% (14d) 
and 97% (28d) of subjects. If we were to assume that 95% of subjects will have resolution of 
symptoms, instead of the more conservative 90%, then the total number of subjects needed to 
achieve 85% power to de tect a 10% absolute between -group difference in the primary 
outcome would decrease. However, this may be an overly optimistic projection. Accordingly, 
we have planned our study using the more conservative assumption of a 90% symptom 
resolution rate, to min imize the risk of conducting an under -powered trial.  
For the resistance sub -study, based on anecdotal data we estimated that 40% of subjects 
receiving 14 days of treatment would acquire intestinal carriage of a drug -resistant Gram -
negative bacillus, compar ed to 20% of subjects receiving 7 days of treatment. Using a two -
sided alpha of 0.05, and 80% power, 91 subjects in each group (182 subjects total) will be 
needed. This is 57% of the planned total enrollment, which we believe is feasible based on 
our pre -trial planning . To simplify the logistics of adding a second site, the MEDVAMC will

2.d. Inclusion and exclusion criteria  
Inclusion criteria (must have all) . With the addition of the MEDVAMC as a second site, 
there will be significant efforts to ensure that enrollment there is consistent with enrollment 
at the MVAMC. This will include communication between study coordinators, investigator 
oversight, and weekl y calls during the study roll -out phase at the MEDVAMC. These are 
deemed necessary since there is some degree of judgement needed as to determining whether 
documented symptoms meet inclusion criteria (for instance, whether “pain in the lower back 
and side”  qualifies as “flank pain”.  
1- Male gender  
2- New -onset (within 7 days) of at least one of the following symptoms/findings: dysuria, 
urinary frequency, urgency, hematuria, perineal pain, supra -pubic pain, costovertebral 
angle tenderness, or flank pain  
3- Treated a s an outpatient (Primary Care Center or Emergency Department), with < [ADDRESS_1197396] 7 days, but not more than 14 days, of either 
cipro floxacin or TMP -SMZ  
Exclusion criteria (must have none)  
1- Admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (for > 24h) at the time of diagnosis  
2- Documented fever at time of initial evaluation (≥ 38.0 Celsius)  
3- Previous enrollment in the study  
4- Treatment for UTI in past 14 days  
5- Not ab le to give informed consent  
6- Unwilling to  either : 
a. return for study visit  
b. participate in a home visit  
c. participate via mail  
7- Symptoms thought more likely to be caused by a non -UTI diagnosis (e.g., urinary 
calculus, sexually transmitted infection, etc.)  
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
15 
 8- Other a ntimicrobial therapy (new or ongoing) prescribed for a non -UTI diagnosis (e.g., 
cellulitis, pneumonia, etc.)  
9- Treatment initiated with an empi[INVESTIGATOR_859213] -susceptible based on standard laborato ry criteria  
10- Treatment initiated with an empi[INVESTIGATOR_859214], based on 
current guidelines and reviews  
Inclusion criteria were selected to identify male patients with a symptomatic UTI, treated 
without hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Identifyin g patients with a symptomatic UTI (vs. asymptomatic 
bacteriuria) is crucial, since patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria cannot be expected to 
improve with antimicrobials, and thus their inclusion would bias the study towards finding no 
significant differ ence according to treatment duration. Although we anticipate that most 
subjects will have a urinalysis and urine culture performed, we have found that over 20% of 
subjects treated for UTI at the MVAMC  are treated without one or the other test being 
obtaine d42. Accordingly, although we will record the results of any urine testing obtained, 
performance of urinalysis or culture will not be required for inclusion, although the study 
coordinator will work closely to increase the rates of urine culture ordering as part of 
enrolling patients through the involved clinics. Since UTI is largely a clinical diagnosis, with 
the culture being obtained mainly to help providers identify the causative pathogen and 
potentially adjust antimicrobial treatment, we believe that including patients without such 
urine testing (which reflects everyday practice) is appropriate.  
 
Exclusion criteria were selected both to ensure patient safety and for statistical and practical 
reasons. Specifically, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_859215], 
including a higher likelihood of bacteremia, which may require longer treatment duration 
and/or parenteral therapy. Patients previously enrolled in the study were excluded to ensure 
statistical independence. Patients pres cribed less than 7 days of antimicrobial therapy are 
excluded since they will be difficult to identify before their treatment has ended. Patients 
prescribed more than 14 days of antimicrobial therapy are excluded because this generally 
indicates a patient being treated for suspected concomitant prostatitis, for which longer -
duration therapy is beneficial6. 
 
2.e. Method of identifying potential subjects  
Patients with UTI symptoms will be identified at the time of their initial clinic nursing visit, 
and the study coordinator will be notified  and patient given the “opt out” flyer . The 
outpatient clinic areas of the MVAMC  and MEDVAMC have been used for study 
recruitment in the past, with good results. The study coordinator s will regularly meet with 
clinic staff to remind them  of the UTI trial , and the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_859216]-investigator at the MEDVAMC will ask for cooperation form primary care clinicians 
through several methods, including emails, announcements at staff meetings, and other 
meetings . 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
16 
 For patients presenting in off -tour hours (evenings, nights, weekends, and holidays), we have 
established and pi[INVESTIGATOR_31219] a system for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_859217]. Using Vista, diagnostic codes relevant to UTI will be 
searched to identify potential participants. This is essentia l, since success of the trial will 
depend on identifying potential subjects, reviewing their eligibility status, contact[CONTACT_3018], 
and enrolling them before they have completed 7 days of treatment. Using an “Outpatient 
Diagnosis/Procedure Code Search” funct ion, we were  able to electronically search for these 
ICD-10 codes  among all outpatient encounters at the MVAMC,  and can limit our searches to 
specific dates and clinics.  In our pre -trial planning, we asked a sample of patients about 
participation in a hypo thetical study. Over 50% indicated that they would be willing to 
participate, in principle, and over 1/3 were reasonably certain that they would participate.  
 
Finally, we will ask the pharmacy service to generate a daily electronic report of 
prescriptions  for 7 -14 days of ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. This list will 
be used as an additional method for identifying potential subjects that are not found via the 
ICD-[ADDRESS_1197397] referral.  
 
Currently, recruitment at the MVAMC is at 4.6 subjects/month . Assuming a 30% higher rate 
at the MEDVAMC, based on 33% more male UTI epi[INVESTIGATOR_859218] 30% 
larger population served, we anticipate a recruitment rate at the MEDVAMC of 6/month. 
With a combined rate of 10.6/month, we a nticipate 16.[ADDRESS_1197398] (i.e., a man presenting with urinary symptoms) 
patients will be contact[CONTACT_47803] , either by [CONTACT_14223] a letter sent to them if 
unable to reach by [CONTACT_648] , and the study will be explained to them in detail. Eligible s ubjects 
willing to participate in the study will be consented and randomized to shorter vs. longer 
duration therapy, presuming that their provider subsequently ordered either ciprofloxacin or 
TMP -SMZ for [ADDRESS_1197399] reason for  not enrolling being time constraints of 
scheduling a visit at the MVAMC or difficulty arranging transportation.   
Home visits will be conducted in the greater Minneapolis/St. Paul or Houston metropolitan 
area by [CONTACT_859246], using 
methods used by [CONTACT_859247]. Any patient 
with a behavioral flag, history of inappropriate behavior, or other indications of a possible 
safety issue will NOT be eligible for home enrollment. The study coordinator will be 
reimbursed for mileage driven based on the current allowable federal reimbursement rate  per 
local facility policy . 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
17 
 Mail enrollment will be offered to eligible subjects who live outside of the greater 
Minneapol is/St. Paul  or Houston  metropolitan area, or who prefer to not have an in -person 
study visit. Such subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_9137], have the study 
explained to them in detail via telephone, and then have an informed consent and HIPAA 
authorization form sent to them. Subjects that were unable to be reach ed by [CONTACT_859248] 
a letter sent to them explaining that they may be eligible for a study. Study staff contact 
[CONTACT_859249]. 
To ensure there is no unnecessary time delay, the subje ct will also be sent the mail 
enrollment forms with the letter. Study staff will attempt to reach subject via telephone after 
sending the letter  and mail enrollment forms . After receiving the signed forms from the 
subject, the research pharmacist will rele ase the study medication to the subject . All 
shipments will be by [CONTACT_453482], with the study coordinator remaining in contact [CONTACT_859250]. 
Subjects not seen and evaluated on the day of treatment initiation will be contact[CONTACT_859251]. In order to avoid “cold -calling” patients, all men 
presenting to the involved outpatient clinics with urinary symptoms w ill be provided an 
informational sheet regarding the study, and informing them that they may be contact[CONTACT_89287]. A number to call to opt -out of such contact [CONTACT_478552].  
 
2.g. Sampling of the intestinal microbiota  (currently only offered at th e MVAMC)  
Subjects in the resistance sub -study will provide [ADDRESS_1197400] obtained via rectal swab performed by [CONTACT_859252]  (or self -collected at home for mail enrollment) , the sec ond collected and submitted 
by [CONTACT_2319] 1 week after completion of study medication. Subjects enrolled via home visit can 
enroll in the sub -study using self -collected swabs . Although obtaining a rectal swab is mildly 
invasive and may cause slight discomfort, i t has been performed in numerous research 
studies and is part of routine clinical activity in many U.S. hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]50. We  anticipated that 
only a minority of subjects would agree to this sampling; however, during our mock -
enrollment exercise we were surprised to find that 95% of the [ADDRESS_1197401], such that the time 
and space required for this su b-study will not be onerous. Swabs will be entered into a 
registry as they are received, with a study number used to link clinical and laboratory 
information. Swabs will be plated onto plain and antimicrobial -supplemented modified 
Mueller -Hinton agar plate s (i.e., Mueller -Hinton agar containing bile salts and neutral red), to 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/[ADDRESS_1197402] the lactose -fermentation characteristic of any Gram -negative 
bacilli in the specimen, both generically and specifically those resistant to the included 
antimicrobials (i.e., ciprofloxacin and TMP -SMZ).  
From plates yielding growth of Gram -negative bacilli, [ADDRESS_1197403] -
numerous colony morphologies per plate will be identified to the species level using the API -
20E system (BioMerie ux, Durham, NC). Susceptibility to 22 antimicrobial agents will be 
determined by [CONTACT_859253], using methods, control strains, and interpretive criteria as 
specific by [CONTACT_8105]. For each Gram -negative bacillus 
isola ted, a semi -quantitative measure of growth will be recorded. Specimens will be scored 
for presence of resistant organisms using four different endpoints: (1) any detectable Gram -
negative bacilli, (2) any Gram -negative bacilli resistant to ciprofloxacin (or  TMP -SMZ), (3) 
density of ciprofloxacin (or TMP -SMZ) -resistant Gram -negative bacilli, and (4) a Gram -
negative bacilli resistance score, which will be the sum of all unique resistance markers 
detected among the various Gram -negative bacilli isolated from th e specimen.  
 
 
2.h. Subject compensation  
Subjects will receive $40  at the time of enrollment in the parent trial to compensate them for 
their travel and time commitment, regardless of whether they choose to participate in the 
resistance sub -study. Subjects enrolling in the resistance sub -study will receive $[ADDRESS_1197404] fecal swab ( obtained at the study visit /after mail enrollment ), and an additional $30 for 
the second fecal swab. The higher compensation for the second swab reflects the extra effort 
and inconvenience subjects may experience with collecting and mailing  the sample. This 
yields a max imum possible compensation of $[ADDRESS_1197405] common adverse drug events associated  with antimicrobial 
therapy include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, and headache. Less frequently 
encountered adverse drug eve nts include allergic reactions (including rash, renal injury, and 
anaphylaxis), C. difficile  infection, and increased or decreased effect of other medications, 
including warfarin. Because subjects are not being assigned to specific antimicrobials by 
[CONTACT_3462], extensive discussion regarding the potential harms of the antimicrobial their 
provider prescribed is beyond the scope of the study. Instead, at the time of enrollment study 
personnel will briefly review potential generic harms of antimicrobials,  will inform patients 
that treatment duration may or may not influence the probability of experiencing any harms, 
and will remind subjects to report any adverse events to their primary care provider or the 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/[ADDRESS_1197406], with the details of any reported potential 
harms being recorded.  
 
2.j. Follow -up and outcome assessment  
Follow -up telephone contacts will occur at four time points, i.e. , (i) on or about the time of 
medication cessation, (ii) 7 (± 2) days after medication cessation, (iii) 14 (± 2) days after 
medication cessation and (iv) 28 (± 2) days after medication cessation.  
(i) The first contact [CONTACT_859254]. Study personnel will inquire regarding adherence and will screen for adverse drug 
events, both via an open -ended question and by [CONTACT_859255], vomiting, diarrhea, di zziness, headache, and drug allergy. Subjects will 
be encouraged to refer to their symptom diary to ensure accurate recall.  
(ii) At the second contact ([ADDRESS_1197407] 
dose of active antimicrobial), resolution of UTI symptoms (the primary outcome)  will be 
assessed. Additionally, adverse events will again be assessed, subjects will be asked whether 
there has been interval retreatment for UTI , and which treatment (active or placebo) they 
think they receiv ed. Subjects in the resistance sub -study will be reminded during this call to 
obtain and return a stool swab in the provided mailer.  
(iii) At the third contact ([ADDRESS_1197408] 
dose of active antimic robial), resolution of UTI symptoms will again be assessed, and 
subjects will again be asked about adverse events and interval retreatment for UTI. After 
unblinding, the assessment occurring [ADDRESS_1197409] dose of active antimicrobial will 
be used for analysis.  
(iv) The fourth contact (28 days after medication cessation) will again include an assessment 
of adverse drug events and an inquiry as to any retreatment for UTI. All subjects having 
reported initial resolution of their UTI symptoms will be assessed for the secondary outcome 
of recurrent UTI, defined as recurrence of UTI symptoms and receipt of antimicrobial 
treatment.  
If at any time subjects report new or unresolved UTI symptoms, symptoms consistent with C. 
difficile  infection, or any other  potential complication of antimicrobial therapy, they will be 
directed to seek medical care from their primary provider or the MVAMC or MEDVAMC 
Emergency  Department.  Severity of reported adverse events will be assessed and recorded 
(see section 2.m)  
 
2.k. Safety and monitoring  
Subject -specific safety monitoring will be performed via symptom review during the 
telephone contacts. Additionally, subjects will be given contact [CONTACT_859256] 9.0, 02/19/[ADDRESS_1197410] 
(IRB) per MVAMC and MEDVAMC policy , and each such event will be reviewed by [CONTACT_859257] -related. Monitoring to detect an excess of 
clinical outcomes or adverse events in  either arm (including treatment failure for the initial 
UTI, recurrence of UTI, and adverse drug events, including C. difficile  infection) will be 
performed by [CONTACT_859258]. 
Study records will be maintained within the MVAMC and MEDVAMC on secure research 
drive s, accessible only to the research team. Any paper records will be stored in a locked file 
cabinet in the principal investigator’s locked office (3B -126) at the MVAMC, and in the 
office of the co -investigator at the MEDVAMC . 
2.l. Definitions for safety and monitoring.  
Adverse event: an adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical  occurrence associated with 
the antimicrobial treatment , whether or not  the even t is considered related to the 
antimicrobial . 
Adverse reaction : any adverse event caused by [CONTACT_859259] . 
Suspected adverse reaction  (SAR): any adverse event for which  there is a reasonable 
possibility that the antimicrobial treatment  caused the  adverse  event. “Reasonable 
possibility” means there is evidence to suggest  a causal relationship between the 
antimicrobial treatment and the adverse event.  Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser 
degree of certainty  about causality than “adverse react ion,” which means any adverse  event 
caused by [CONTACT_859260].  
Serious adverse event  (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction : An adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is considered  “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator,  or 
the IRB, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
-Death  
-Life-threatening adverse event  
-Inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_272] ≥ [ADDRESS_1197411] and may require medical or surgical  intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
21 
 Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse  reaction : an adverse event or 
suspected adverse reaction is  consider ed unexpected  or unanticipated  if it is not listed in the 
protocol.  
Life-threatening : An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction  that places the subject at 
immediate risk of death. It does not  include an AE or SAR that, had it occurred in a more 
severe  form,  might have caused death.  
2.m. Anticipated advers e events  
The following list s anticipated adverse events , including some that are rare but serious : 
-Diarrhea  
-Nausea  
-Vomiting  
-Headache  
-Drug allergy  
-Pain at tendon insertions  
-Blood sugar fluctuatio ns among diabetic patients , including severe decreases leading to 
coma  
-Psychiatric side effects such as disturbance in attention, memory impairment, and delirium  
-Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture  
 
Note that failure to resolve UTI symptoms (i.e., not meeting the primary outcome), is not 
considered an adverse event, but rather will be recorded in the assessment of the primary 
outcome.  Severity of adverse events will be determined using a severity scale (grade 0 -5) 
adapted from the Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 , as listed 
below.

2.n. Statistical methods  
 
Primary outcome: resolution of UTI symptoms [ADDRESS_1197412] met the primary outcome . The proportion of subjects mee ting the 
primary outcome will be compared between the 2 treatment groups using a per -protocol 
analysis, with subjects analyzed according to which treatment they received. An intention -to-
treat analysis will be performed as a secondary analysis. Subjects re porting taking 7 or fewer 
days of study medication will be analyzed as having received shorter -duration therapy, 
whereas subjects reporting taking 8 or more days of study medication will be analyzed as 
having received longer -duration therapy. Non -inferiori ty testing of the differences in the 
group proportions of symptom resolution will be done using a z -statistic derived by [CONTACT_859261] -inferiority margin approach described by [CONTACT_859262]51, 52. 
Exploratory sub -group analysis using multiple logistic regression will be performed to assess 
outcomes stratified by [CONTACT_859263]: cathete r-
associated UTI, functional or mechanical urinary tract obstruction, and diabetes. We 
anticipate that the proposed study will be under -powered for these analyses, and thus they 
will primarily be used as pi[INVESTIGATOR_859222].  
 
Protocol 9.0, 02/19/2019  
24 
 Secondary outcome (1): recurrence rates at 28 days after completing study medication.   
The proportion of subjects reporting recurrence of symptomatic UTI (defined as for the study 
entry criteria, but occurring after the primary outc ome assessment) in each group will be 
calculated, along with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Between -group comparisons 
will be made using the Chi -square test.  
 
Secondary outcome (2): incidence of any adverse drug events in the 28 days after 
comple ting study medication.   
The incidence of adverse drug events, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, 
headache, drug allergy, and C. difficile  infection, both individually and in aggregate, will be 
compared between treatment groups. For subjective  symptoms, subjects will be asked to use 
their symptom diary to quantify the number of days they experienced each adverse event. 
Severity will be determined using a severity scale (grade 0 -5) adapted from the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events,  version 4.0. Adverse events will be analyzed first 
as whether a subject experienced any adverse drug event vs. none (Chi -square test), and then 
by [CONTACT_859264] (Mann -
Whitney U -test). Cases of suspected drug allergy will be reviewed by 2 Infectious Disease 
staff physicians (who are blinded to study group assignment) to assess: certainty of allergy 
diagnosis, relatedness to the prescribed antimicrobial, and clinical severity, based on 
information  collected by [CONTACT_859265]. Subjects 
having a history of prior C. difficile  infection will be recorded, but will not be excluded from 
analysis since these patients are a small but important subgroup, for which guidanc e 
regarding therapy duration is of particular interest. The randomization process should help 
ensure that there is no imbalance in such patients between treatment groups.  
 
Secondary outcome (3): intestinal carriage of antimicrobial -resistant Gram -negative 
bacilli after completing study medication, as compared to a baseline sample taken early 
in treatment.  
For the resistance sub -study, the outcomes of interest are (i) the proportion of subjects who 
develop newly detected intestinal carriage of antimicrobial -resistant Gram -negative bacilli 
between the baseline sample during treatment and the sample obtained 7 days after 
completing study medication (Chi -square test), (ii) the density of antimicrobial -resistant 
Gram -negative bacilli among samples with any growth  (t-test or Mann -Whitney U -test, 
depending on the frequency distributions), and (iii) the overall resistance score, defined as 
the total number of antimicrobials which at least one of the isolated Gram -negative bacilli is 
resistant to (t -test or Mann -Whitn ey U -test).

3. Summary  
We propose a single -center, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial of treatment 
duration for male UTI, which is a common but relatively understudied infectious disease in the 
VA population. The results of this study will allow clinicians to mak e an evidence -based 
treatment decision regarding an extremely common clinical condition among male veterans

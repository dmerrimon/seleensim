 1. Objective  
Our objective is to determine the effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g. automated reminder calls/text 
messages with or without personalized calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to children age 12 -14 months, 4 years old, 
or 6-17 years old who are due for a WCC visit and don’t have one s cheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes of 
appointment scheduling, appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
 
Background  
The Cincinnati Children’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_56038] 33,000  
children.  The Pediatric Primary Care Center (PPCC), Hopple Street Health Center (HPC) and Fairfield Primary 
Care (FPC) serves an underserved population.  Annually, these practices provide over 60,[ADDRESS_185043] included reminder phone calls and/or texts when patients were overdue for 
well child care (WCC).  These efforts were time and resource intensive, as they required personnel to manually 
complete and document attempts. Additionally, due to high resourc e needs to accomplish such efforts, there has 
been no outreach to those [ADDRESS_185044] speaking to the efficacy of automated reminder (i.e. notifying parents of needed 
immunizations) and recall (i.e. notifying parents of overdue  immunizations) systems, including text messaging 
systems.1,2,[ADDRESS_185045] effective and efficient.  Differences in the timing of reminders to schedule, as 
well as the message itself, has been shown to make a difference in the outcomes of reaching patients or scheduling 
appointments.4 However, there remains a need for research that identifies the degree to which combinations of 
patient reminder systems improve outcomes, especially the outcome of on -time immunization, and how these  
approaches differ by [CONTACT_56040].1 
 
Following the COVID -19 pandemic shut -down in which thousands of well child appointments were cancelled or 
delayed, the importance of a systematic outreach process became more critical.  The traditional process is non -
standardized and the efficacy of the work is both unknown and expensive.  Our objective is to determine the 
effectiveness of varied outreach methods (e.g. automated reminder calls/text messages with or without personalized 
calls/texts, MyChart messaging) to  children age 12 -14 months, 4 years old, or 6 -17 years old who are due for a 
WCC visit and don’t have one scheduled in the next 45 days on the outcomes of appointment scheduling, 
appointment completion, and receipt of the MMR vaccination.  
2. Design/Method  
To achieve our objective, we will conduct a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial.  Randomization is justified 
because 1) it is a rigorous approach to answer our question and 2) we do not have the resources or appointment 
availability t o personally contact [CONTACT_56041].

Automated Message : Parents indicate their preferred mode of reminder (e.g. call or text message) when they 
schedule appointments.  Cincinnati Children’s uses a HIPAA compliant platform called TeleVox to send automated 
calls and text reminders to parents ac cording to their preferences which are recorded in the Electronic Health Record 
(EHR).

texts)  
3. Parent with act ivated MyChart account (Y/N) (rationale: not dependent on calling scheduling center to 
make appointment)

 4. Access to appointment: Number of days to 3rd next available appointment at patient’s clinic at time their 
first automated message is sent  
5. Patient recei pt of any past immunizations (Y/N) (rationale: vaccine refusing parents will be unlikely to 
change even if they return for well child check)

Power/Sample Size  
 
Personal Contacts (12 -14 month & 4 -year -olds) Trial:  
We based our hypotheses (see table, below) on a systematic review’s pooled estimates of effect size for automated 
messages and personalized calls finding 37% and 40% of children, respectively, completed immunizations.[ADDRESS_185054] involved in making personal contacts, the minimal difference in outcome that would 
make it worth the effort i s high.

0 personal attempts  20% C 35% B 
1 personal attempt  50% A 65% AB 
 
We calculated sample size needed per group to detect a difference for each of the contrasts below with alpha of 0.05 
and power of 80%.

B vs C  136 
A vs. B  167 
A vs. AB  167 
B vs. AB  40 
C vs. AB  16 
 
To fully power the 2 X 2 factorial trail, we estimate needing 167 per group X 4 groups = [ADDRESS_185055] to far exceed 
the required sample size after 3 replications.  If needed, we could increase t he number of replications of the trial to 
reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not powered to precisely estimate any interactions 
between interventions.  
 
MyChart Trial:  
In hypothesis testing for [ADDRESS_185056] 2 messages vs. 1 message, thus the type I error rate of 
0.05 is retaine d. Since the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 0 message would be considered easier to achieve 
than the hypothesis testing of 2 messages vs. 1 message,  the power analysis for this trial should be based on the 
design of (standard message vs.   tailored me ssage) by (1 message vs. 2 messages). We based our hypotheses (see 
table, below) on previous work indicating approximately 20% WCC appointment completion on automated text 
reminders.  We anticipate that a tailored message increases the WCC appointment comp letion rate by [CONTACT_20904] 10%.

We assume no difference between A vs. B and thus not consider powering the comparison between these two 
groups, but we will explore non -inferiority analysis for this comparison in data analysis. To fully power the above 
contrasts, we estimate needing 293 per group X 4 groups = [ADDRESS_185058] to exceed the required sample size after 2 replications. If needed, we could 
increase  the number of replications of this trial to reach the targeted sample size.  We acknowledge that we are not 
powered to precisely estimate any interactions between interventions.  
 
Televox (6 -11yo) Trial:

size.

All identifying information will be removed once data collection is complete. Data will be kept securely on a 
CCHMC computer that is password protected. Any hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_56039]  a private office.  
 
Facilities and Performance Sites  
Data analysis will be done on the Main Campus of CCHMC and at the CCHMC primary care offices (PPCC, HPC, 
FPC, and SBHCs).  
 
Potential Benefits  
The results of this study will aid CCHMC pediatric primary ca re centers in improving and redesigning an outreach 
system to children behind on necessary preventative services who have gaps in needed primary care.  It will identify 
the most effective ways to reach, engage, and schedule patients for care when appropria te.  This will enable the 
primary care offices to allocate the appropriate amount of resource to outreach efforts moving forward, ensuring 
high risk children receive reminders for care.  
 
Potential risks, discomforts, inconveniences, and precautions  
Outreach Methods Study Protocol & SAP  
Version 1.1,  6/27/22 
pg. 11 
 The on ly significant risks are breach of confidentiality and potential discomfort/inconvenience associated with 
receiving texts or phone calls indicating that care gaps exist for a child.  As noted above, personal health information 
(PHI) will be obtained via th e electronic medical record.  After obtaining this information, patients will be de -
identified in the created database and securely stored.  
 
Risk/Benefit analysis  
While immediate benefit to any given individual or family is unknown, this study involves mi nimal risk.  
 
Cost of Participation  
 
There is no cost for participation.  
 
Payment for Participation  
There is no reimbursement for participation.  
 
Request for HIPAA Waiver  
The use or disclosure of the PHI involves no more than minimal risk to the privacy of individuals based on the 
presence of the following elements:  
-We plan to protect health information identifiers from improper use and disclosure by [CONTACT_56051].  
-We have an adequate plan to destroy identifiers at the earliest opportunity cons istent with conduct of the research.  
-We ensure the PHI will not be reused or disclosed to (shared with) any other person or entity, except as required by 
[CONTACT_2371], for authorized oversight of the research study, or for other research for which the use or discl osure of the PHI 
would be permitted under the Privacy Rule.  
•This research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver or alteration.  
•This research could not practicably be conducted without access to and use of the PHI.

 The results of the Outreach Methods  study will be assess ed as described in this document. This statistical analysis 
plan begins with an overview of the key components of the study, including its design, objectives, and outcomes 
measures. This is followed by a detailed description of the statistical analyses that will be utilized to address study 
hypotheses.  
1. Overview of study: This study used a multi -arm randomized control trial to test the impact of patient portal 
outreach messages , with and without tailoring , on the scheduling and co mpletion of well  child care visits  
(WCC) and completion of vaccinations . We randomized e ligible patients to the Standard Message group, the 
Tailored Message group, or the Control Group. We generated random allocation sequence stratified by [CONTACT_159343] (with a block size of 3). Based on sample size calculations, w e planned to 
enroll a minimum of [ADDRESS_185066] (EHR) from three academic pediatric primary care practices.  
1.1 Study Objective:  Test the effectiveness of  patient portal outreach messages , with and without tailoring , on the 
scheduling and completion of  well child care visit s (WCC) in children  due for preventative services.  
Working  hypothesis:  Twenty percent of patients in the Standard Message group, 30% of patients 
in the Tailored Message  group, and 2% of those in the control group will complete a  well child 
care visit  within 8 weeks.  
 
1.2 Outcome measure s 
Primary   
• Well child care visit completed within [ADDRESS_185067] intervention  
o Appointment completed (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
Secondary  
• Well child care visit scheduled within [ADDRESS_185068] intervention  
o Appointment scheduled (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
• Child receipt of COVID -[ADDRESS_185069] intervention  among eligible 
patients (age ≥12 years at the time of the study)  
o COVID -19 vaccine administered (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
 
1.[ADDRESS_185070]  
• Scheduled wel l child care visit (within [ADDRESS_185071] intervention)  
• Completed well  child care visit (within [ADDRESS_185072] interventi on) 
• Receipt of COVID -19 vaccine (within [ADDRESS_185073] intervention)

1.5 Interim Safety Analyses  
No interim analyses are planned for this study.  
2. Statistical Reports  
2.1 Report Generation  
2.1.1 Software  
All statistical analyses will be performed  using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, [LOCATION_003] ) under 
Microsoft Windows operating system  
Outreach Methods  SAP 
Version 1.1, 6/27/[ADDRESS_185075] completed the study on the  study end date on 8/5/21. 
2.2.2 Missing data  
We will use data obtained from patient’s electronic health record (EHR) to calculate our primary and secondary 
outcomes. Missing outcome data could occur for several reasons, such as errors  of medical documentation or the 
patient no longer in the primary care  registry.  
2.3 Statistical Report Contents  
The following section outlines the contents of the final statistical analysis. For all analyses,  subjects who are 
enrolled in the study and are eligible will be analyzed in the groups to which they were a llocated.  
2.3.1 Description of study population  
Sample size:  
The total number of subjects who are enrolled  will be given.  
Demographics and Clinical Characteristics, Patient and Parent:  
Demographic and clinical characteristics as measured at baseline will be summarized by [CONTACT_159344]. Variables to be 
summarized are: child age, child  sex, child  race, child  ethnicity, insurance, parent communication preference  
absence of past patient receipt of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or diphtheria, tetanus and acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccine as a proxy for childhood vaccine refusal, and patient lifetime historical institutional no -
show rate . Variables will be summarized using descriptive stat istics appropriate for each type of data item.  
Baseline c haracteristics with large differences between groups will be included in analyses  as covariates .  
2.3.2 Primary outcome analysis  
Primary  outcome: Well child care visit completed within [ADDRESS_185076] message sent or date of randomization for 
the control group.  
o Appointment completed  (yes or no) based on electronic health record documentation  
For the primary outcome, we will use a logistic regression model to examine appointment completion within [ADDRESS_185077] additional 
analyses adjusted for these variabl es.  
2.3.3 Secondary outcome analyses  
• Well child care visit scheduled within [ADDRESS_185078] additional analyses adjusted for these 
variables.  
• Receipt of 1st dose of COVID -[ADDRESS_185079] message 
sent or date of randomization for the control group

 1) Protocol Title  
Title:  Aromatherapy for management of pain, anxiety,  and nausea in 
the acute care setting  
Protocol Version Date: 2/20/20  
2) Objectives  
The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of aromatherapy on pain, 
anxiety, and nausea in patients on an acute care unit.  The primary objective of 
this project  is to determine whether Elequil aromatherapy tabs show a 
measurable benefit in  reducing patient reported pain , anxiety,  and nausea, thus  
reducing the use of anxiolytic , antiemetic,  or opio id medication s. The 
secondary objective is to identify  the effectiveness of aromatherapy on 
improved sleep  and i mproved patient sati sfaction  and well -being . 
Aromatherapy has been studied and shown effective for the decreased effects 
of pain, anxiety,  and nausea. We are hypothesizing that the use of 
aromatherapy has a positive effect in decreasing patient -reported pain, 
anxiety,  and nau sea, and increasing  sleep and  overall patient satisfaction.  
3) Background  
People are hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294936] , with many  of them experiencing ailments 
such as pain, nausea,  and anxiety , on top of the  symptoms that are related to 
their admitting diagnoses . As nurses, the  primary responsibilit ies are to 
function as  a caregiver to help manage physical conditions, treat illness,  and 
educate to prevent further worsening of health conditions . Assessing, 
managing,  and treating uncomfortable symptoms is an integral part of nursing 
care. Interventions for these primarily include  pharmaceutical interventions . 
The use of aromatherapy is an alternative  treatment that can be used in 
addition to medications . Clinical aromatherapy is the controlled and 
therapeutic use of essential oils in the clinical setting for specific, measurable  
outcomes  and is a natural therapy increasingly being used to improve 
symptoms and maintain health and well -being during a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].1 
The encouragement of alternative, non -pharmaceutical means to decrease 
symptoms is not a wide -spread practice . Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294937] . 
This study will try to expand upon the limited literature and studies regarding 
the use of aromatherapy and its effectiveness in decreasing the presence of 
pain, nausea,  and anxiety  in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] . 
There is limited evidence that shows that the use of aromatherapy is effective

 in decreasing somatic complaints . One study concluded that essential oils 
generally resulted in significant clinical improvements based on their intended 
use.2  Cho found that aromatherapy use resulted in reduced an xiety, increased 
sleep, and stabilized blood pressure.3  Moeini and colleagues demonstrated 
that the use of aromatherapy significantly improved the quality of sleep with 
the use of essential oils.4 While the majority of aromatherapy studies were 
done in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, or outpatient setting, all 
concluded that further studies needed to be done. In an effort to provide non -
pharmacologic adjunctive treatments for symptom management, 
aromatherapy has been explored in the inpatient setting.  
We will be using Elequil aromatabs® to determine the effectiveness of 
aromatherapy in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6885] . The following scents , their common uses  
and estimated  aromatab® duration of use  are: 
• Lavendar: P romotes relaxation, comfort,  and sleep.  Lasts 8 hours.  
• Lavendar -Sandalwood : Promotes relaxation , comfort,  and sleep.  Lasts 
8 hours or more . 
• Lavendar -peppermint:  Promotes relaxation during pain, calm  
anxiousness, and soothe queasiness . Lasts 8 hours.  
• Orange -Peppermint : Uplifts, energizes,  and soothe s queasiness. Lasts  
8 hours.5 
The chosen essential oils will be inhaled by [CONTACT_294942][INVESTIGATOR_105463] .

watch a short instructional video . https://vimeo.com/[ADDRESS_359188] for completion, asking them to rate their pain, anxiety and/or nausea 
using a Likert scale.  
Upon completion of these assessment tools, the subject will be asked to 
identify their highest priority among the symptoms ranked to which they will 
then be given the corresponding aromatherapy tab to treat that symptom.  
The research team member will then provide the tab that is identified to treat 
that symptom.  
• Lavendar: Promotes relaxation, comfort,  and sleep . Assists with 
decreasing anxiety.  
• Lavendar -sandalwood: Promotes relaxation, comfort, and sleep . 
Assists with aches and restlessness .  
• Lavendar -peppermint:  Promotes relaxation during pain, calm

 10) Withdrawal of Subjects  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time,  and they will be reassured that their 
clinical care will not be compromised if they were to withdraw. Subjects will be 
withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
• Subject changes their mind and decides to opt out of the study before utilizing 
aromatherapy.  
• Development of an allergic reaction (rash, indurations, increased discomfort, 
anaphylactic symptoms) to the use of aromatherapy  
o The aromatherapy tab will be removed and sequestered so as to not be 
used again.  
o Subject will be monitored with provider notification of patient’s 
allergic reaction.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_294940]  [ADDRESS_359190] will be asked to complete the survey,  and the time of 
completion (since aromatherapy initiated) will be noted.  
• Transferred off the unit (to ICU or a different unit)  
o Aromatherapy tab will be removed before transfer.  
o Subject will be asked to complete the survey,  and the time of 
completion (since aromatherapy initiated) will be noted.  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time upon request. Subject 
participation in the study may be stopped at any time at the discretion of the 
Investigator or Attending Physician. When a subject withdraws from the study, 
the reason(s) for wi thdrawal will be recorded by [CONTACT_737].  
11) Risks to Subjects   
Even though the products that will be used are diluted and we will not be 
applying concentrated solutions directly to the skin, the following  are 
identified risks  related to aromatherapy use:  
• Allergic reaction to the use of aromatherapy, inc luding the 
development of  
o Dermatitis  
PROTOCOL TITLE: Aromatherapy on Tower 4 (Non-Otolaryngology)  
Page 9 of 13  Aromatherapy Protocol   
 o Runny nose/nasal congestion (s inus issues ) 
o Rash  
o Red or bumpy skin (indurations)  
o Increased discomfort  
o Anaphylactic symptoms  
The rates of allergic reactions for each essential oil  that will be used for 
this study are  as follows:  
Sandalwood :  0.9%, orange and peppermint :  0.6% 6 
Lavender :  2.2% 7 
The patient will notify the nurse immediately if any of these symptoms 
appear.  
12) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
Subjects may experience relief of or decrease in their symptoms of nausea, pain, 
anxiety, and/or insomnia with the use of aromatherapy. They may resultantly use 
less medications and have fewer associated undesirable side effects from those 
medications.  
The results of this study may contribute to our knowledge about aromatherapy as 
a non -pharmacologic intervention  to relieve or minimize pain, anxiety, nausea, 
and/or insomnia. Future individuals who have suc h symptoms may benefit as a 
result.  
13) Sharing of Results with Subjects  
Results will be shared with subjects.  Any peer reviewed manuscripts that result 
from the study will be made available to the subjects on request.

 Assessment Tools  
Anxiety Likert Scale:  This one -item scale consisted of five evenly spaced 
numbers each anchored to a level of anxiety ( 0 = not at all anxious, 2 = a little 
anxious, 3 = moderately anxious, 4 = very anxious, 5 = extremely anxious).  
The Numerical Rating Pain Scale  measures pain experienced right now based 
on a 11-point Likert scale with choices of 0 = no pain, 5  = Moderate pain, 10 = 
Worst  possible pain . We will be utilizing this [ADDRESS_359193] commonly used pain scales that is used at the bedside.  
Nausea Scale:  0 -5 Nausea Scale

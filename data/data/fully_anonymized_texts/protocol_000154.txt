PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS (ALBUMIN GRIFOLS  + FLEBOGAMMADIF)  
 
STUDY TITLE  A multicenter, randomized, controlled study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of short -term plasma exchange followed 
by [CONTACT_7419] -term plasmapheresis with infusion of human 
albumin  combined with intravenous immunoglobulin in 
patients with mild -moderate Alzheimer’s disease.  
SPONSOR  Instituto Grifols, S.A. 
INVESTIGATIONAL 
PRODUCT AND FORMULATION Treatment Group : Albutein® 
                              Flebogamma® DIF 
Albutein® and Flebogamma® DIF are approved in [LOCATION_003]. 
Control group: Sham procedure. 
INDICATIONS  Probable mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease  
OBJECTIVES  Primary objective 
To evaluate the changes in the c ognitive, functional, 
behavioral and global domains based on the different 
applicable psychometric batteries and scales.  
Secondary objectives  
• To determine the changes in the concentration of beta -
amyloid peptide in plasma and cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) 
in the treatment group of patients with Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) .  
• To evaluate the structural changes in volume of the 
hippocampus, posterior cingulate  area, and other 
associated areas based on neuroimaging studies with 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) (variat ions versus 
baseline).  
• To determine functional brain functional changes 
through FDG -PET (fluordeoxyglucose -PET).  
• To determine whether plasma exchange with human 
albumin  combined with intravenous immunoglobulin  
(IVIG)  is safe, taking into account the following factors:   
- Type, severity and frequency of adverse reactions during and after the procedure and infusions. 
- Changes in vital signs  and clinically relevant 
changes, according to the laboratory test findings. 
- Control of epi[INVESTIGATOR_339734].  
METHODOLOGY  A clinical trial comprised of 364 subjects with probable mild 
to moderate AD will be conducted primarily to determine 
whether short -term followed by [CONTACT_7419] -term, low -volume 
plasma exchange with human albumin combined with IVIG 
is ab le to modify patient’s cognitive, functional, behavioral

and global domains. There will be 3 treatment groups and 
one control group. The subjects will be randomized in a 
1:1:1:1  proportion.   
After screening and randomization,  treatment groups will 
proceed as follows:  
• One month and a half (6 weeks) of intensive treatment 
with one plasma exchange per week . All 3 treatment 
groups are the same during the intensive treatment phase. 
• Two of the three groups will f ollow 12 months of 
maintenance treatment with on e low -volume plasma 
exchange every month combined with IVIG every 4 
months administered at the end of the corresponding 
plasmapheresis instead of albumin (that is, 9 
plasmapherese s with Albumin replacement and 3 
plasmapheres es with IVIG replacement). Durin g this 
year patients will follow  one of the  two different  pre-
allocated  treatment arms: 1) with the doses of albumin 
and IVIG needed to replace those removed during the 
plasm apheresis, 2) with half of the doses of albumin and 
IVIG , (see Investigational Product Dosage  below for 
specific dosage and schedule). 
• One of the three groups will follow the same schedule as 
the above two groups but with half of the doses of 
albumin  alone (without  IVIG ), that is, 12 plasmaphereses 
with half -dose albumin alone.  
Patient s in the control group will undergo sham procedures 
mimicking plasmaphereses but with neither fluid exchange 
nor albumin or IVIG administrations .

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT DOSAGE  During the treatment pha se, and after the screening visits, the 
subject will undergo the following plasma exchanges:  
• a maximum of six full replacements with albumin 5% 
(Albutein®, an approved medicinal product) within six 
weeks during the intensive treatment period (all groups)  
• a maximum of 9 plasmaphereses with albumin 20%  
(Albutein®, an approved medicinal product)  replacement 
plus 3 plasmapherese s with IVIG replacement during the 
maintenance period  (two groups) . 
• one group will undergo 12 plasmaphereses with albumin 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 14 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February 2018 
 
Confidential  
 
 
20%, without  IVIG  
The six full replacement sessions of the intensive treatment 
period will be completed in six weeks (one session per 
week). Conventional plasma -exchange devices will be used 
in this intensive period. 
The 12 low -volume replacement sessions (plasmapheresis + 
albumin or IVIG replacement) of the maintenance period 
will be completed in 12 months (one session per month). A 
prototype based on the Auto-CTM device (Fenwal Inc, Lake 
Zuric h, IL, [LOCATION_003] . FDA PMA approval  # BP850001) or the 
AuroraTM device ( Fenwal Inc , Lake Zurich, IL, [LOCATION_003] . FDA  
510(k) clearance # BK110072) will be us ed in all sites where 
the low- volume replacement sessions will be performed . 
The volume of plasma taken on each full plasma exchange 
during the intensive period will be approximately that of the 
plasma volume of the subject as calculated from body 
weight, height and hematocrit (approximately 35 -45 mL/kg, 
corresponding to a volume of 2500 -3000 mL). 
Approximately the same volume will be replaced with 
albumin 5%. 
 
During the maintenance period the volume of plasma taken 
on each low -volume replacement will be that of a regular 
plasmapheresis (maximun of 88 0 mL, depending on the 
patient weight) which will be replaced with albumin 20% or 
IVIG, according to the treatment arm, as follows:  
- 1st arm: a maximum of 200 mL of albumin 20% since this 
volume of albumin 20% contains approximately the same  
amount of albumin as that of 880 mL of plasma. When IVIG 
is used, 20 g of IVIG will be administered after 
plasmapheresis for the same reason as above.  
- 2nd arm: a maximum of 100 mL of albumin 20% and [ADDRESS_420326] arm: a maximum of 100 mL of albumin 20%  alone,  
without IVIG.  
Albumin  doses will be adjusted according to the actual 
volume of plasma removed (depending on the patient 
weight).  IVIG doses wi ll be fixed for each group.

MAIN STUDY PARAMETERS  Efficacy variables:  
• Change from baseline in the cognitive  scores as 
measured by [CONTACT_33341] -Cog (6  measurements: weeks -3, -2 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 15 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February 2018

or -1, and 7-8, months 6, 9, 12 and 14) within the 3 
treatment arms.  
• Change from baseline in ADCS -ADL inventory (6 
measurements: week s -3, - 2 or -1 and 7 -8; months 6, 9, 
12 and 14) within the 3 treatment arms.  
Secondary variables:  
• Change from baseline in the cognitive, functional and 
neuropsychiatric scores and overall development as 
measured by [CONTACT_157513], NPS battery, NPI , CDR -Sb, 
ADCS -CGIC, CSDD, C- SSRS. (6 measurements: week s 
-3, -2 or -1 and 7-8; months 6, 9, 12 and 14)  and QoL -
AD, RUD- Lite® (5 measurements: week s -3, - 2 or -1; 
months 6, 9, 12 and 14) . Moreover the optional 
questionnaires like OAS and ABS could be used at any 
visit in case any sign of aggression or restlessness.  
• Variation in levels of A β1−40 and A β1-42 in CSF in the 
period between baseline lumbar puncture (before the start of the Intensive treatment period
) and lumbar puncture 
immediately after the end of the last low-volume 
plasmapheresis (whenever this may be)  
• Variation in the levels o f Aβ1−40 and A β1−42  in CSF 
between the finalization and beginning of each of the two treatment periods.  
• Levels of β1−40 , A β1−42,  T-tau and P -tau in CSF 
throughout the study. 
• Plasma levels of A β1−40 and A β1−42 before and after 
each plasma exchange for b oth treatment periods. 
• Structural changes in volume of the hippocampus, 
posterior cingulate  area, and other associated areas by 
[CONTACT_9268]. Five measurements will be made (week s -3, -2 or -
1 and 7-8; months 6, 9 and 14). 
• Variation in FDG -PET patterns ( 4 measurements: weeks  
-3, -2 or -1 and 7-8; months 9 and 14). 
 
Safety variables: 
• The primary criterion of safety will be the percentage of plasma exchanges associated with at least one adverse event that may be related to the study procedure (adverse reactions)  withi
n 72h after infusion completion (or after

• Vital signs will be recorded before, during  and after each 
plasma exchange session, where required. Various 
laboratory test parameters (blood cell counts, platelet count, prothrombin time (Quick), aPTT,  fibrinogen, total 
proteins, and calcium) will also be assessed when

necessary.  
• During the treatm ent periods (before each plasma 
exchange) and on the days when there is no replacement, 
anxiety and restlessness tests will be made based on the 
Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) and the Agitated 
Behavior Scale (ABS), whenever considered opportune. 
• According to  the criterion of the investigator, all 
clinically relevant  changes in vital function, laboratory

evaluated.  
ANALYTICAL PLAN / STATISTICAL METHOD  A
ll subjects included in the study and subjected to at leas t 
one plasma exchange session (i.e., randomized and treated) 
during the intensive treatment phase (the six first weeks of 
treatment) will form part of the efficacy population. Control 
group subjects will also be included (without the plasma 
exchange) if th ey attended at least 1  of the 6 intensive 
treatment phase visits.  
A second efficacy analysis will also be carried out (per protocol analysis, PP ) with the subjects  
who complete the 
treatment without major breaches in the study protocol.  
The statistical tests will be performed with a 5% significance level and will be two -sided. In addition to the tests, two-
sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) will be reported. 
The analysis of tolerability will be based on description of 
the safety variables according to  their nature.  
The adverse reactions will be coded according to the adverse 
events classification of the World Health Organization 
(WHO)  (MedDRA current version), and will be described by 
a synonym (Lowest Level Term) and the affected organ / system, the intensity, causality and seriousness. 
The statistical analysis will be carried out by [CONTACT_339788] (United 
Biosource Corporation).

INTRODUCTION   
1.1 Rationale 
1.1.1 Characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease  and I ts Relation to  β-Amyloid Peptide 
Dementia, a mental condition that is related to aging, has become a major public health 
problem.  The proportion of elderly people is increasing in the population, and in future the 
number of individuals with dementia inevitably will increase as well.  This in turn will imply 
an increased burden for health care systems.  Over half of all patients with dementia suffer 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  At present, the prevalence of AD in Europe is 2% for the 65-69 
years age interval, 4% for the 70 -74 years age interval, and 8% in the 75- [ADDRESS_420327] to stabilize them to ensure maximum patient autonomy
1.  It is assumed that in the future treatment will not be based on a single 
management modality; rather, simultaneous interventions will focus on several therapeutic targets.  
At present it is only possible to evaluate progression of the disease on the basis of the clinical data, cognitive function scales and imaging and biochemical marker (i.e., subrogate marker) diagnostic tests.  
AD, as a neurodegenerative process, is expressed by [CONTACT_258559], which manifests in the  form of memory loss, speech alterations, visual -spatial deficits, impaired recognition 
capacity and attentional loss among the most relevant neuropsychological aspects.  The 
cognitive alterations are correlated to the evolutional stage of AD and the capacity of the 
affected individual to perform activities of daily living (ADL).  Non-cognitive symptoms or 
neuropsychiatric alterations often accompany AD , depression and behavioral disorders being 
the most prevalent manifestations in the early stages of the d isease.  The neuropsychological 
defects and the functional capacities and behavioral disorders or mood states are assessed by [CONTACT_339789] (designed ad hoc).  The differences in pre- 
and post -intervention al measures are the parameters used to evaluate the efficacy of the 
currently employed pharmacological treatments and the drugs being evaluated by [CONTACT_339790].  
On the other hand, the diagnostic utility of different neuroimaging techniques is being explored. Computed Axial T omography (C AT) is useful for detecting some causes of 
dementia, though it is unable to precisely distinguish between early AD and normal aging.  In 
a way similar to C AT, Single -Photon E mission Computed T omography (SPECT) may prove 
useful for establishing a differential diagnosis in dementia.  Lastly, Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (MRI) offers superior anatomical discrimination, and generates a more precise image 
of the affected brain areas.   Other technologies and other ways of evaluat ing the images 
obtained are also being investigated.  
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 18 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February [ADDRESS_420328] that the concentration of β-
amyloid 42 peptide (Aβ 1-42) and of tau protein (total , T-tau and phosphorylated, P- tau) in 
cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) may be of diagnostic value. Thus, the CSF concentration of T -tau 
and P -tau is known to be increased in AD patients, while Aβ 1-42 is lower than in health y 
subjects2,3. 
The accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) in the extracellular spaces of the brain and in the walls of the cerebral blood vessels is one of the most significant characteristics of AD, and presently constitutes one of the most important targets for the development of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]
4.  
Two predominant types of Aβ plaques are found in the brain of AD patients: neuritic plaques and diffuse plaques.  Neuritic plaques contain dense bundles of Aβ fibers surrounding the 
dystrophic neurites, astrocytes and microglia.  The diffuse plaques in turn contain non-
structured Aβ and are not surrounded by [CONTACT_339791].  It is believed that the neuritic 
plaques may develop from diffuse plaques
3.  The number of neuritic plaques has not shown a 
clear correlation to the severity of dementia in AD ; a high density of these structures has also 
been found in elderly persons without dementia3. 
A number of researchers  believe that some options for treatment may be to prevent the 
accumulation of such deposits, inhibiting binding of the Aβ monomers, favoring their clearance or reducing monomer production.  Unfortunately, there are no adequate animal 
models for  reproducing the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease
5,6.  Nevertheless, treatments are 
still being investigated to reduce the brain deposits of Aβ.  R ecently, studies have been made 
involving active and passive immunization in both transge nic mice and in patients - 
reductions in Aβ being achieved in both cases7,8,9,10. 
In humans, approximately 100- 150 m L of cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] ( CSF) circulates within the 
brain ventricles and subarachnoid space.  Each day , 400-500 mL of CSF are generated, 
resulting in  replacement of the total CSF volume four to five  times a day.  As to the 
composition of CSF, 99% is water, and approximately 20% of its protein content is 
synthesized in the brain. From the proteic per spective, CSF may be regarded as a window to 
the brain.  As a result, studies have centered on the changes in its composition.  If a protein 
quantified in CSF is also present in significant amounts in plasma, and the protein is able to cross the blood- brain barrier (BBB), then the concentration in CSF may be influenced by 
[CONTACT_339792] (CNS) and in plasma.  The concentration of a 
particular agent in CSF is a net effect of diffusion from blood, synthesis in the brain, clearan ce and degradation of the agent in the extracellular space, and its final dilution in the 
total volume of CSF. 
1.1.[ADDRESS_420329] reported high plasma levels of Aβ both after active immunization with Αβ7 
and after passive immunization with anti- Aβ antibodies8, 22. 
Taken globally, the above data, i.e., bidirectional flow and deliberate imbalance of the flow in 
one or the other  direction , support s the existence of a dynamic equilibrium between plasma 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 19 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February [ADDRESS_420330] of the world (WO 
03/051374 A3). 
Recently, Cleary et al.
[ADDRESS_420331] demonstrated that the soluble oligomers of A β that go on to 
form part of the amyloid plaques are already neurotoxic before the fibrillar forms are 
produced; as a result, they would play a relevant role in the early forms of AD. 
1.1.3 The Role of Plasma exchange with  Albutein® 5% in  Alzheimer’s disease  
The amyloid precursor protein (APP)  and Aβ itself are secreted during normal cell 
metabolism, with small amounts of both being found in CSF and plasma.  In both 
compartments, Aβ is associated to proteins3 that may contribute to maintain the solubility of 
Aβ.  One such protein is albumin, which is the most abundant protein in both blood and CSF.  
In this sense, albumin is able to bind to and transport a range of small molecules, including 
peptides and drugs.  Only 40% of body albumin is contained in plasma; the remaining 60% is 
found in the extracellular fluids .  The great majority of Aβ circulating in blood (89%) is 
bound to albumin in 1:1 proportion4, and only 5% is bound to high density lipoproteins 
(apoenzyme E , ApoE and apoenzyme J , ApoJ)26,27.  It has been shown that albumin is one of 
the most important binding proteins, a nd one of the most potent inhibitors of Aβ 
polymerization4. 
Plasma exchange is a process used to eliminate patient plasma and replace it with another 
solution maintaining normal volemia and osmotic balance.  To this effect, albumin or other 
colloids have been used, as well as  fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and crystalloids.  The purpose 
of this procedure is to eliminate toxic substances from patient plasma, such as: autoantibodies , 
alloantibodies, immune complexes, proteins, or toxins28.  The clinical efficacy of plasma 
exchange depends on many factors, including the volume exchanged, the number and 
frequency of sessions, the nature of the replacing solution, and the separation technique employed.  Data obtained in animal studies have shown human albumin to be neuroprotective 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 20 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February [ADDRESS_420332]  
volume and brain edema29. 
Plasma exchange is widely  used in treatment of different pathologies .   Specifically, the 
procedure has been applied to the following disorders: Guillain- Barré syndrome (acute 
treatment)30, multiple sclerosis (chronic treatment)28, inflammatory demyelinating 
polyradiculoneuropathy31, acute inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS32 and other 
peripheral neurological alterations33.  Since 2004, the Banc de Sang i Teixits (BST)  
(Barcelona, Spain) has carried out [ADDRESS_420333] been used, such as ventriculoperitoneal shunting, which is  a metho d involving 
implantation of a catheter connecting the brain ventricles with the peritoneal space for the 
drainage of CSF34,35. 
Albutein® 5% has  been marketed in [LOCATION_003] since 1978, though albumin had already been in use 
in different countries since the 1940s.  Since th en the product has been continuously used in 
application to different clinical conditions, and is even employed as placebo in many clinical trials.  
1.1.4 Previous Clinical Studies of Plasma exchange with Albutein
® 5% in Alzheimer’s 
disease  
In order to evaluate the effects of plasma exchange with Albutein® 5% in patients with mild to 
moderate AD, Grifols S.A. in [ADDRESS_420334]. M. Boada of the Service of Neurology of Vall d’Hebron Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339736]ó ACE in Barcelona, Spain.  T en patients were recruited, of which seven were subjected to plasma exchange, two 
received no treatment, and one was removed from the study upon personal request.  Of the 
seven subjects treated, three underwent five plasma exchanges , two patients received four 
exchanges , and two underwent three exchanges  during a period of three weeks.  The 
participants were subsequently followed-up on for a period of [ADDRESS_420335] important variables recorded were the following:  
• changes in the levels of Aβ 1-40 and Aβ 1-42 in plasma,  
• changes in the levels of Aβ1-40 and Aβ 1-42  in CSF,  
• changes in the neuropsychological test results (MMSE and ADAS-Cog), and 
• changes in the neuroimaging studies (MRI and SPECT). 
Results showed a consistent pattern of Aβ mobilization as we ll as a trend to stabilization in 
the MMSE and ADAS -Cog65.  
Based on these results a phase II clinical trial was conducted in 4 sites, 2 in Spain and 2 in the [LOCATION_003], with 42 patients recruited. The trial was a randomized, controlled, single -blind study in 
which 3 different plasma -exchange schedules were assessed: 1) 6 plasma exchanges in 3 
weeks, 2) 6 plasma exchanges in 6 weeks and 3) 6 plasma exchanges in 12 weeks. Therefore, patients that completed all cycles underwent a total of 18 plasma exchanges. The control group underwent sham  (simulations) procedures that mimicked the actual procedures. Interim 
results have recently been published and they show a consistent pattern of Aβ mobilization as well as an improvement of the MMSE and ADAS -Cog of 2.5 and 5.5 points, respectively, at 9 
months of follow -up. In terms of Aβ mobilization, the schedule of 6 plasma exchanges in 6 
weeks seemed to be more effective than 6 plasma ex changes in 12 weeks and of similar 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 21 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February 2018 
 
Confidential  
 
 
effectiveness as 6 plasma exchanges in 3 weeks65. Thus, 6 plasma exchanges in six weeks 
were selected as a potential load treatment for future trials.  
1.1.5 The role of intravenous immunoglobulin in Alzheimer’s disease  
In [ADDRESS_420336] time in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_339737]’s disease66. The study 
included [ADDRESS_420337] randomized clinical trial of IVIG in Alzheimer’s disease was performed 
on 8 patients67 during a follow up of 18 months and the results showed plasma Aβ 
mobilization after each IVIG administration as well as a trend to cognitive stabilization. A second randomized clinical trial involving 24 patients has been completed
68 and the 
preliminary results presented in the American Academy of Neurology 2010 meet ing showed a 
statistical significant improvement of 6 points in the ADAS -Cog scores. In addition, a phase 
III study involving 360 patients is currently ongoing69.  
On the other hand, Grifols S.A. has conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_339738] 4 patients that had previously participated in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_339739] 1.1.4 and the preliminary results showed a similar pattern of plasma Aβ mobilization as compared to that observed in 
the plasma -exchange study.  
1.1.6 Potential role of a combination of plasma exchange with Albutein
® with 
Flebogamma®DIF 
Taking into consideration the results of the clinical studies mentioned above, it can be conclu ded that both approaches, plasma exchange with albumin and IVIG infusion, act on the 
peripheral Aβ pool, as seen through the plasma Aβ mobilization observed, and that both approaches show a trend to cognitive improvement. Therefore, it seems reasonable to search 
for a synergy between the two treatments using lower doses of each of them which will also imply less concern about safety issues. In fact, for selected neurologic diseases, this combination approach has already been used
70, 71. 
We propose here a co mbination of monthly low -volume plasma exchanges (similar to regular 
plasma donation plasmaphereses) with IVIG every four months. Previously, there will be a load treatment with six plasma exchanges in six weeks to assure the baseline results obtained in previous studies. Albutein
® and Flebogamma®DIF, two approved products, will be used as 
albumin and IVIG, respectively.

3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.[ADDRESS_420338] udy Design/Developmental Phase 
The trial comprises a multicenter , randomized, controlled design.  The subjects included in 
the study will be controlled from the first screening visit up to fourteen  months after. Then, 
the maximum study duration for a given subject will be approximately one year and two 
months.  There will be two weeks for screening and randomization of both groups (treatment 
and control).  After these two weeks the treatment period will proceed as follows :  
• One month and a half ( six weeks ) of intensive treatment with one full plasma 
exchange per week  (all the three groups). 
• Two of the three groups will f ollow 12 months of maintenance treatment with one 
low-volume plasma exchange every month combined with IVIG every 4 months 
administered at the end of the corresponding plasmapheresis instead of albumin (that 
is, 9 plasmaphereses with Albumin replacement and 3 plasmaphereses with IVIG replacement). During this year  patients will follow  one of the  two different  pre-
allocated  treatment arms: 1) w ith the doses of albumin and IVIG needed to replace 
those removed during the plasmapheresis, 2) with half of the doses of albumin and IVIG . 
• One of the three groups will follow the same schedule as the above two groups but 
with half of the doses of albumin alone (without IVIG), that is, 12 plasmaphereses 
with half -dose albumin alone. 
Patients in the control group will undergo sham procedures mimicking plasmaphereses but with neither fluid exchange nor albumin or IVIG administration ( See Appendix 8). 
There wi ll be sites in  Spain and [LOCATION_003]. 
The site of the Coordinating Investigator (Fundació ACE/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_339735] d’Hebron, Barcelona, SPAIN) will be the first site to be included. The rest of the sites will be incorporated progressively after the first site. Several mo nths can elapse between the inclusion of the 
Spanish sites and the rest of sites. 
3.2 Randomization and T reatment Assignment  
After the  screening  period, the subjects will be randomized to one of the 3 treatment groups or 
the control group according to a [1:1:1:1] scheme.  
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 23 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February 2018 
 
Confidential  
 
 
3.3 Type of Control 
Control group: the subjects will be AD patients involving the same inclusion and exclusion 
criteria as the treated subjects  but will undergo sham procedures mimicking plasmaphereses 
but with neither fluid exchange nor albumin or IVIG administration . 
3.4 Blinding Techniques  
The control group will be subjected to simulated full plasma exchanges through a non-
invasive procedure. Specifically, the tip of a cut catheter will be stitched to an adhesive gauze  
dressing (acting as a “second s kin”) which will be placed on the subclavicular or jugular 
region. Then, a second adhesive gauze will cover the one with the catheter tip stitched to it. The cut catheter will be of characteristics similar to the catheters used in the treatment group.  
Also  simulated low -volume plasma exchanges will be performed. Likewise, these subjects  
will receive the same visits as the patients in the treatment group.  
This study is blind for patients, caregivers and raters. 
The study Sham manual guideline describes all t he sham procedures throughout the study 
(Appendix 9).  
3.5 Screening  Period (Pre-Randomization or Pharmacological Washout) 
There will be a two -week period for screening before the six weeks of intensive treatment. At 
the end of the screening  period subjects will be randomized to one of the three treatment 
groups or to the sham  group.

4.3 Planned Number of Subjects 
A sample size of 312 subjects ( 78 per each of the 4  groups ) will make it possible to detect 
with nearly 92% power for the first of the co -primary efficacy variable (the changes from 
baseline of the ADAS  -Cog scores) a difference in the mean  of [ADDRESS_420343] deviation (SD) to be 
5.55 (according to the data obtained in the phase II study65), with a level of significance of 
5%. This same sample size provides over 98% power for second of the co -primary endpoint 
variables (the changes from baseline of the ADCS -ADL inventory scores) a difference in the 
mean  of 6.[ADDRESS_420344] deviation (SD) to be 10.0 (according to the data obtained in the phase II 
study), with a level of significance of 5%. 
The study will have joint power for these co- primary endpoints of at least 90% (0.92*0.98 = 
0.90). The calculation makes the conservative assumption that these endpoints are 
independent. Since these endpoints may be positively correlated 90% should serve as a lower bound on power. 
Assuming a global dropout rate of approximately 15%, the study would have to enroll [ADDRESS_420345] will be withdrawn from the study if:  
• Prior to the first plasma exchange session, no plasma sample has been collected for 
possible future assays. 
• Any serious adverse event is recorded, advising removal of the subject . 
• The subject or his/her legal representative wishes to abandon the study and continue 
follow-up and normal treatment in the center.  
• The investigator is of the opi[INVESTIGATOR_339740].  
• The subject fails to adhere to the study protocol. 
The reason for withdrawal of the subject will be documented, and a final visit will be 
scheduled to obtain blood samples and to complete the pertinent tests.  Whenever possible, 
these tests will be made on the same day as the final visit.  No subject can be re- enrolled into 
the study after having been withdrawn from the study. 
4.[ADDRESS_420346]  will receive the following treatment : 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 26 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February 2018 
 
Confidential  
 
 
• One month and a half (6 week s) of intensive treatment with one full plasma exchange per 
week  (all the three groups) 
• Two of the three groups will f ollow 12 months of maintenance treatment with one low -
volume plasma exchange every month combined with IVIG every 4 months administered 
at the end of the corresponding plasmapheresis instead of albumin (that is, 9 
plasmaphereses with Albumin replacement and 3 plasmaphereses with IVIG replacement). During this year  patients will follow  one of the  two different  pre-allocated  
treatment arms: 1)  with the doses of albumin and IVIG needed to replace those removed 
during the plasmapheresis, 2) with half of the doses of albumin and IVIG .(See Appendix 
8). 
• One of the three groups will follow the same schedule as the above two groups but with 
half of th e doses of albumin alone (without IVIG), that is, 12 plasmaphereses with half -
dose albumin alone. 
 
Albutein® 5% (an approved medicinal product) will be used  during the intensive period (full 
plasma exchanges) . 
Albutein® 20% (an approved medicinal product) will be used during the m aintenance period 
(low-volume plasma exchanges) , together with Flebogamma® DIF (an approved medicinal 
product). 
5.1.2 Dosage and T reatment Regimen  
The six full replacement sessions of the intensive treatment period will be completed in six 
weeks ( one session  per week)  
The volume of each full plasma exchange will be approximately that of one plasma volume of 
the patient as calculated from body weight, height and hematocrit (approximately 35 -45 
mL/kg, corresponding to a volume of 2500-3000 mL).  
The 12 low- volume plasma exchange sessions (9  with albumin 20% and 3 with IVIG)  of the 
maintenance treatment period will be completed in 12 months (one session per month). 
The volume of each plasmapheresis during the low -volume plasma exchange period will be 
between 690 and 880 mL of plasma (depending on the patient body weight, following the 
nomogram for plasma donation used in the [LOCATION_003]. ( See Appendix 3 ). 
5.1.3 Method of Application 
Full plasma exchanges  (Intensive treatment period) 
Full p lasma exchanges ( FPE) can be carried out via peripheral access or centrally, according 
to the individual characteristics of the subject .  In the latter case, and before the first 
replacement session, a double -lumen catheter must be placed in the subclavian  or jugular  
vein.  Implantation and maintenance will be carried out according to the standard procedures 
used in each center  but it will be mandatory to perform a chest X -ray to confirm the correct 
placement of the catheter .  Removed plasma volume will be replaced with the same volume of 
Albutein® 5% during the procedure. 
The removed and replaced plasma volume will depend on patient’s characteristics (sex, height, weight and hematocrit). It will be approximately 35 -45 mL/kg, corresponding to a

For blinding the control group, adhesive gauze dressing will be placed on the subclavicular or  
jugular region, stitching a catheter of characteristics similar to the catheters used in the  
treatment group  (see Appendix 9). 
The central catheter has the advantage of increased convenience for the subject  during the 
process, since it allows greater flows and thus shorter session times  and obviates the need in  
each session to perform two peripheral venipunctures . The central line access also facilitates 
subject mobility during the procedure.  
Each session is carried out at a rate of 60 -100 mL/min., provided replacement is possible 
through a double -lumen catheter placed in the subclavian vein, with a continuous -flow cell 
separator.  Each of these sessions will last approximately two to three  hours. The control  
group will be subjected to simulated (sham) plasma exchanges during the same time as the  
subjects in the treatment group.  
Each subject must  remain in the facility  throughout the procedure and then for as long as 
necessary to ensure a safe return home. 
These details refer to the plasma exchange procedure performed through centrifugation (the 
most commonly used) although the procedure through filtration is also permitted. 
Albutein® 5% will be used according to the instructions of the Full Prescribing Information  
(Appendix 1).  The solution is normally clear to slightly opalescent.  Do not use the product 
if the  solution is cloudy or has precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162].  The product must be at body temperature before 
use.  Do not dilute with water for injections.  Once the container is open, the contents must be 
administered immediately.  Unused contents must be discarded.  No remaining product in an 
opened container can be stored in the refrigerator  and used at a later time. 
The vital  signs  of each subject ( blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature) are to be monitored 15- [ADDRESS_420347] be suspended 
and no further sessions will be carried out until the parameters return to adequate levels (see 
sections 5.2.1 and 5.2.2).  
Low-volume plasma exchanges (Maintenance treatment period)   
In all sites where the low -volume replacement session will be performed, a device based on 
regular plasma donation (Auto- C, Fenwal, Illinois, [LOCATION_003]  with FDA PMA approval  # 
BP850001 or Aurora, Fenwal, Illinois, [LOCATION_003] with FDA  510(k) clearance # BK110072) will be 
tested  (see Appendix 3 for device protocol ). The Auto -C (FDA PMA approval  # BP850001 ) 
or Aurora  (FDA 510(k) clearance # BK110072 ) based devices are used with the objective of 
offering the patient a procedure that is similar to a conventional plasma donation with the difference that albumin or IVIG will be infused at the end of the plasmapheresis.  
Low volume plasma exchange (LVPE) will be carried out through a peripheral line. The  
removed plasma volume will be similar to that of a plasma donation (690 to 880 mL)  and will 
depend on pa tient’s  weight. 
The control group will undergo simulated (sham) low volume plasma exchange which will 
last approximately the same time as the subjects in the treatment group .

Albumin  
Albutein® 20% will be infused at the end of the corresponding plasmaphe resis using Auto -C 
(FDA PMA approval  # BP850001)  or Aurora  (FDA  510(k) clearance # BK110072 ) based 
devices . During the Maintenance period the dosing will be as follows:  
• 1st arm: 200 mL (40 g, 9 plasmaphereses) 
• 2nd arm: 100 mL (20 g, 9 plasmaphereses) 
• 3rd arm: 100 mL (20 g, 12 plasmaphereses) 
 
Therefore, after the LVPE (690 to 880 mL of plasma removal), Albutein® 20% is infused 
depending also on patient’s weight and treatment arm (200 to 80 mL).  Due to the difference 
in volume  (removed/infused), it is advised to infuse saline solution  to avoid the risk of 
hypotension related events  (see Appendix 10 for guidance ).  
The main characteristics of the product can be found in the  Full Prescribing Information  
(Appendix 1 ).  The solution is normally clear to slightl y opalescent.  Do not use the product 
if the solution is cloudy or has precipi[INVESTIGATOR_135162].  The product must be at body temperature before 
use.  Do not dilute with water for injections.  Once the container is open, the contents mus t be 
administered immediately. Unused contents must be discarded.  No remaining product in an 
opened container can be stored in the refrigerator and used at a later time.  
Intravenous immunoglobulin infusions 
Flebogamma® DIF will be infused at the end of the corresponding plasmapheresis during the 
Maintenance period following the instructions of the Full Prescribing Information  
(Appendix 2 ). At the discretion of the invest igator, patients can be premedi cated with 
paracetamol and antihistamines.  
During the Maintenance period the d osing of IVIG will be as follows:  
• 1st arm: 20 g 
• 2nd arm: 10 g 
• 3rd arm: None (only albumin) 
 
5.2 Criteria for Treatment Modification or I nterruption  
5.2.1 Criteria for Modifying R egimens  
In the case of any relevant alteration in the coagulation parameters, full plasma replacement 
(Intensive period) is to be suspended and no further sessions will be carried out until the 
parameters return to adequate levels.  
Replacement is to be postponed 24 hours if fibrinogen <1 g/ L or the prothrombin time 
(Quick) <60% of the control value.  
Platelet depletion to below 100,000/ µL is also an indication for replacement suspension. 
Relevant alterations of coagulation parameters are not expected to occur with the low -volume 
plasma exchanges (Maintenance period).  
If any adverse event occurs during  the infusion of Flebogamma® DIF one of the following 
actions will be carried out taking into account the nature and severity of the event: 
- To stop the infusion. 
- To reduce progressively the infusion rate until the symptoms disappear. 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 29 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February 2018 
 
Confidential  
 
 
After re -evaluation th e adverse event, it can be proceed as follows:  
- To restart the infusion or to increase as of a tolerated rate (once the symptoms 
have disappear) or 
- To definitely stop the infusion. 
If a patient presents an adverse event two times with the same infusion rate, the following doses will be administered at the maximum tolerated rate.  
5.2.2 Special Warnings and Precautions for U se 
Full p lasma exchange is a safe technique that may induce very well -known and therefore 
preventable and controllable , adverse reactions, accor ding to the guidelines provided below.  
In any case, and considering the special vulnerability of the patients studied, a number of precautions (in addition to the habitual measures) have been taken to minimize the risks of the procedure: 
1. Plasma exchange  will be carried out by [CONTACT_339794], under direct and 
continuous supervision by [CONTACT_339795].  
2. Subjects will be required to remain in the center before and after the procedure for 
longer periods of time than usual.  
3. Vital signs  and labor atory test parameters will be monitored more frequently than 
usual. 
4. The treatment suspension / postponement criteria are clearly established.  
5. The person accompanying the subject should be present and/or in proximity  before, 
during and after the procedure  but not in the same room in order to maintain the blind. 
Exceptionally, agitated patients could be accompanied by [CONTACT_339796]’s anxiety. In this case it is mandatory the subject is scheduled for the tr eatment a different day than the rest of the patients . 
The patient will have direct, 24- hour access to the specialist (by [CONTACT_172377]) in both 
the replacement phase and during subsequent follow -up.  In the case of any incident, 
the physician will decide the actions to take.  
Adverse effects  (AEs) may be observed during the replacement procedure, due to the process 
of apheresis, the replacement fluid used, or as a result of the patient disease or idiosyncrasy .  
These AEs include hypocalcemia, hypotension, allergic reaction, coagulation disorders, adverse events related to vascular access, and other AEs such as headache, nausea and anxiety.  
The information contained in this and the following sections is also valid for  plasma removal  
(plasmapheresis ) during the  low- volume plasma exchange period but the expected AE rate is 
much lower. In fact, the p lasmaphereses performed within this period will be very similar to 
those performed for regular plasma donations (e.g., Grifols performs between 12,000 and 
15,000 plasm aphereses for plasma collection daily in the US).  
On the other hand, Albutein
® and Flebogamma® DIF are safe products that are widely used 
worldwide. For special warni ngs and precautions see the corresponding Full Prescribing 
Information (Appendix 1 and 2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypocalcemia 
The great majority of side effects associated with plasma exchange apheresis is  due to the 
administration of citrate and are related to diminish  ionic calcium availability . Although some 
 
Protocol IG 1002 Page 30 of 6 8 
Version 5.0 (IND version) / February 2018 
 
Confidential  
 
 
adverse reactions not explainable in terms of hypocalcemia, or not resolved by [CONTACT_339797], may be attributable to citrate interaction with magnesium (of characteristics similar to those of calcium).  
When volume replacement is performed with 5% albumin, the risk of hypocalcemia is considerably lower than when plasma is used for replacement ( seen historically in 
approximately 7.8% of sessions), and no important toxicity is detected. 
The factors predisposing to hypocalcemia may be patient -related (hypoalbuminemia, vitamin 
D deficiency ( malnutrition , malabsorption), hypomagnesemia, hyperphosphatemia, altered 
liver or kidney function or hypoparathyroidism) or related to the procedure (duration of citrate infusion >120 minutes, respi[INVESTIGATOR_339741]). 
All plasma exchanges produce tra nsient hypocalcemia that is usually well tolerated by [CONTACT_4677].  Occasionally, the decrease in ionic calcium levels can increase nerve cell membrane 
excitability, resulting in symptoms.  
The symptoms and signs of hypocalcemia to be assessed are:  
• paresthesias  
• headache  
• vision alterations (glinting)  
• nausea  
• cramps  
• chest oppression 
The degree of hypocalcemia is rated from 0 to 4 as follows:

calcium chloride solution is prepared and infused through the return catheter.  To calculate the 
infusion rate, the following must be applied:

[IP_ADDRESS] Hypotension 
Hypotension, presents as p aleness and perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], with lowered blood pressure and 
bradycardia.  This AE appears  as a result of a vasovagal response secondary to hypothalamic 
stimulation, and is very rarely attributable to volemia if the separator used is of the continuous 
flow type (seen historically in approximately 2.6% of all processes).  
The predisposing factors may be patient -related (low body weight, a history of vasovagal 
reactions, or a low hematocrit) or related to the procedure (equipment fatigue or 
extracorporeal volume >20% of patient volemia). 
The initial symptoms and signs  include :  
• perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]  
• bradycardia  
• hypotension  
The progressive manifestations comprise:  
• nausea   
• vomiting  
• syncope  
• involuntary defecation 
• seizures  
Treatment of hypotension consists of interrupting the process, opening the serum access, 
placing the patient horizontal or in the Trendelenburg position, recording blood pressure and 
pulse, and waiting for recovery while investigating the cause (disconnect in case of equipment leakage; if other cause is involved, assess continuation). Recommendations for preventing 
hypotension related events in low-volume plasma exchange procedures  have been captured in 
a study guideline. H ypotension epi[INVESTIGATOR_339742]- weight patients  (see Appendix 10). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Allergic reaction  
Allergic reactions are generally associated with the blood components and albumin, though they may also be due to ethylene oxide or other medication. 
The signs and symptoms include: 
• urticaria  
• dyspnea  
• wheezing  
• hypotension  
• tachycardia  
• facial reddening  
• palpebral edema  
In case the patient suffers from an allergic reaction the site should follow their standard 
procedures to manage the situation. As a recommendation, m ild allergic reactions could be 
controlled with antihistamines (diphenhydramine 25- 50 mg i.v.). In case the reaction 
continues, or in the event of anaphylactic manifestations, it could  be administer ed 0.3-0.5 mL 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:1000 s.c.  This dose may be repeated after 10 -15 minutes if no response is 
elicited.  It is also possible to add methylprednisolone 100 mg i.v.

[IP_ADDRESS] Coagulation disorders 
When the extracted plasma is replaced with al bumin, coagulation disorders may develop due 
to dilution of the coagulation factors , mainly lowered blood fibrinogen, since its half -life is 72 
hours .  During daily plasma exchange  sessions the fibrinogen concentration may drop to 
below 1 g/ L, requiring the infusion of plasma or fibrinogen.  When replacement is performed 
every 72 hours, such measures are not necessary. 
Minor bleeding associated with severe thrombopenia has been observed ( seen historically in 
approximately  2.2%). 
[IP_ADDRESS] AEs Related to vascular access 
The central catheter has the advantage of increased convenience for the subject during the 
process, since it allows greater flows and thus shorter session times, obviating  the need in 
each session to perform two peripheral venipunctures. As to the adverse effects if the catheter is placed in the subclavian vein, the risk of infection is 
minimal.  Thus, while the incidence of infections with all the catheters is <5 per 1000 days 
(<3% of all catheters), this incidence decreases considerably if only those p laced in the 
subclavian vein are considered
23,24.  Pneumothorax, he mothorax, bleeding at the time of 
placement and thrombosis in the case of indwelling catheters left in place for extended 
periods of time may be seen.  The recommendations for the t reatment and prevention of fever 
management and thromboembolic events have been captured in two study guidelines (see Appendix 11 and Appendix 12, respectively); nonetheless the sites should follow their local procedures.  
As to adverse events related to peripheral access,  the most commonly expected are: pain, 
phlebitis, infiltration and extravasation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Other AEs and their treatment   
Other potential AEs include headache, nausea and anxiety.  
• Headache: administer paracetamol  (acetaminophen) p.o. 1 g 
• Nausea: administer Primperan p.o. (Reglan)  5 mL  
• Anxiety: administer diazepam p.o. 5 mg  (for body weight <55 kg) or 10 mg (weight > 
55 kg), or alprazolam at doses of 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively 
• IG levels decrease: A decrease in the IGs levels could occur during the FPE period. IG 
levels will recover their normal range at the end of the FPE  period. Further 
investigations will be needed if the levels are not reestablished which  may suggest an 
underlying pathology  
• Anemia: Although not frequent ly, it is expected to observe anemia in patients with 
haematocrit in the low normal range after the first FPEs. In these cases, oral or 
intravenous iron therapy is recommended depending on the severity of the anemia and the investigator assessment 
 
The recommendations to treat those AE are described above; nevertheless, the sites should 
follow their local procedures.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Incidence of adverse reactions and mortality  
In a 1996 review of the adverse effects of plasma exchange  in patients with Guillain -Barré 
syndrome, involving albumin replacements, a decrease in immediate adverse effects from 
Protocol IG1002  Page 35 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February 2018

12% in 1986 to 7% in [ADDRESS_420351] 
frequent problems.  The estimated mortality was 1 -2 deaths per 10,000 sessions, or two deaths 
per 2000 patients.  
As stated earlier, the expected rate of AE s during the plasmaphereses of the low -volume 
plasma exchanges (Maintenance period)  is much lower  than that expected during the full 
plasma exchanges (Intensive period) . For the expected adverse reactions relative to Albutein® 
and Flebogamma® DIF see Section 9.1.3 and the corresponding Full Prescribing 
Information (Appendix 1 and 2 ). 
5.3 Concomitant Treatment  
Subjects  may continue to receive his/her usual medication.  In particular, the same 
acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or memantine treatment is to be continued, 
without modification during the study. If the subject develops adverse reactions related with 
the AChEI and/or memantine treatment, advising its withdrawal, the medication should be 
replaced by [CONTACT_339799].  
Regarding IVIG  administrations, the subject can be premedicated with paracetamol and 
antihistamines or corticosteroids at the discretion of the investigator.  There are some sites that 
include corticosteroids administration during immunoglobulin infusion. 
Treatment with angiotensin -converting- enzyme inhibitor s (ACEIs) is not allowed during the 
study. Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_339743]. 
Any medicat ion administered during the study  (including any blood products) will be 
recorded on the case report form (CRF).  
5.4 Special Guidelines for Study Drug Handling 
Albutein® and Flebogamma® DIF that are supplied for use in the trial are to be destined 
exclusively to the study.  Any unused material must be returned to the sponsor  or at the 
discretion of the sponsor, may be destroyed at the center according to their SOPs.  The investigator (or pharmacist)  or designated team member  is to keep all records of drug 
utilization.  The sponsor will provide specific forms to be completed by [CONTACT_093], 
pharmacist or designated team member, at the time of dispensation.  These forms can be 
replaced by [CONTACT_339800], provided they meet the requirements of the 
sponsor.  
Once the forms have been completed, they must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_339801].  
5.4.1 Storage of Albutein
® and Flebogamma® DIF  
Albutein® is to be stored at a temperature below 30ºC.  The shelf life is three years when 
maintained at this temperature.  
The product should not be frozen.  Once the container is open, the contents must be 
administered immediately.  Unused contents must be discarded  according to the Center’s 
SOP.  No remaining product in an opened containe r can be stored in the refrigerator and used 
at a later time.   This product must not be used beyond the expi[INVESTIGATOR_339744].  
The solution is normally clear to slightly opalescent. Do not use the IP if the solution i s

Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420352] be strictly limited.  
Flebogamma® DIF is a liquid product and then reconstitution is not necessary. Flebogamma® 
DIF should be stored below 2 5°C, should not be frozen and has a shelf -life of two years when 
stored at this temperature. It must not be frozen and the unused  contents of the vial should be 
kept separately until drug accountability has been completed. Vials must be inspected for 
particles and discoloration before administration. Solutions with evidence of turbidity should 
not be used because of the risk of bacterial contamination.  Flebogamma® DIF must not be 
mixed with other pharmaceutical products or intravenous  solutions, and a dedic ated sterile 
infusion line should be used to ensure proper  administration. Flebogamma® DIF must be 
brought to room temperature before infusion and administered intravenously through a

6.1.3 Safety Variables 
The primary criterion of safety will be the percentage of plasma exchanges (full and low -
volume exchanges, including the infusion of albumin and IVIG)  associated with at least one 
adverse event that may be related to the study procedure (adverse reactions).  In addition, 
consideration globally will be made of the percentage plasma exchanges (full and low -volume 
exchanges, including the infusion of albumin and IVIG)  involving some adverse eve nt, 
whether or not related to the procedure. 
Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_41351], and body temperature) will be 
recorded before, during and after each plasma exchange  session, where required. Evaluation 
will also be made (where required) of the different laboratory test parameters (blood cell 
counts, platelet count, prothrombin time (Quick), aPPT, fibrinogen, total proteins, and 
calcium).  
During the treatment periods (before each plasma exchange) and on the days when there is no 
replac ement, anxiety and restlessness tests will be made based on the Overt Aggression Scale 
(OAS) and the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), whenever considered opportune. 
According to the criterion of the investigator, all the clinically important changes in vital 
function, laboratory test parameters and neuroimaging findings will be evaluated. 
 
6.2 Conduction of the Trial. Study P rocedures . 
See Appendix 8 for the Study Summary Table and for the Study Flow Chart. 
6.2.1 Screening Visits (Weeks  -3, -2 and -1) 
After obtaining informed consent, the re will be  screening period  of up to [ADDRESS_420355] of multiple visits .  During the screening visit, a ll demographic data will be collected.  
Documentation will also include vital signs  (axillary temperature, heart and resp iration rate, 
and blood pressure) and physical examinations with ECG and a sample of blood for genetic 
markers  determination .  
Also at the  screening visit, the subject’s medical history , including AD, will be recorded 
together with the medication used in the preceding month.  The CRF will also register a brief 
history of AD and the prior treatments received.  However, on subsequent visits, recording 
will be limited to the abnormal conditions observed during the previous visit, along with the 
concomitant med ication and any adverse event that may have been detected.  
Sufficient blood will be collected for all the laboratory tests, and a plasma sample will be 
stored at -70ºC for any possible future analysis.  
The following parameters will also be evaluated: biomarkers of AD ( Aβ−40, Aβ−42, β-
secretase, γ-secretase, cholesterol,  LDL,  HDL , VLDL , C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, 
IL-1b, IL -6, ferritin, ΤΝ F-α), coagulation factors (prothrombin time (Quick), aPPT,  calcium

and fibrinogen), proteinogram ( total proteins, albumin, α1-globulina, α2-globulina, β-
globulina, γ-globulina and IgG), other liver or kidney biochemical markers ( AST , ALT , 
bilirubin, LDH and creatinine), troponin and serology (anti -HIV and HCV antibodies, and 
HBsAg antigen).  In addition, a blood cell count will  be performed, including: hematocrit, 
hemoglobin and erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes (if an abnormal leukocyte count is 
recorded, it will be obligate to specify neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes).  
All the inclusion criteria are to be confirmed again after obtaining the laboratory test results. 
If the inclusion criteria are not met, or if some exclusion criterion proves applicable, the patient may not be entered into the study. 
During the study period between week -[ADDRESS_420356] plasma exchange  (week 0), MRI and 
FDG -PET will be performed.  
At the same time, during this study period (from week -3 to week 0), the following tests will 
be administered to measure cognition, functionality, behavior, global evolution, impression  
and depression : MMSE, ADAS -Cog, NPS battery, ADCS -ADL, NPI, CDR -Sb, ADCS -
CGIC , CSDD,  CSSRS, QoL -AD and RUD- Lite
® which are to be administered as indicated in 
the corresponding section.  Likewise, anxiety and restlessness tests will be made based on the 
Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) and the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), whenever considered 
opportune. If the subject is to receive full plasma exchange s through a central venous access, a double -
lumen catheter will be placed  in the subclavian or jugular vein before the full  plasma 
exchange period. It is advisable to place the catheter a few days before the first plasma 
exchange session. For the low- volume exchanges peripheral access will be used.  
Furthermore, it is obligatory to perform lumbar puncture before t he first plasma exchange, to 
collect CSF samples and assess the levels of  Aβ−40, Aβ-42, P- tau, T-tau, β-secretase, γ-
secretase, cholest erol, LDL, HDL, VLDL , C-reactive protein , IL-1b, IL -6, ferritin,  TNF -α) 
and to perform standard CSF tests (cell counts, glucose, proteins and albumin). Time 
collection for the CSF must be between 8am and 12am.  If these procedures are not carried 
out in the days preceding plasma exchange, they will have to be done on the day of first 
plasma exchange  with the subject remainin g at rest until indication by [CONTACT_339802].  These evaluations are considered to be the baseline data.   
6.2.2 Weeks  1 to 6 - Intensive plasma exchange period 
Full Plasma Exchange (Window range +/- 1 day) 
Plasma samples  will be collected from the subject before and 15 -30 minutes after each 
procedure, to allow the pertinent tests.  Additional plasma samples will be collected each time  
for storage at -70ºC and possible future assays.  
The following tests will be made befor e each procedure: biomarkers of AD ( Aβ−40, Aβ−42,  
β-secretase, γ-secretase, cholesterol , LDL, HDL , VLDL, C-reactive protein , rheumatoid 
factor, IL-1b, IL -6, ferritin and  TNF -α), coagulation factors (prothrombin time (Quick), 
aPPT, calcium  and fibrinogen) and proteinogram  (total proteins, albumin, α1-globulina, α2-
globulina, β-globulina, γ- globulina and IgG ). In addition, a cell count will be made including 
hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes (if an abnormal leukocyte 
count is recorded, it will be obligate to specify neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes).  The samples obtained after plasma exchange will be used to 
evaluate the biomarkers of AD, cell count,  platelets, coagulation factors (prothrombin time

(Quick), aPPT, calcium), proteinogram , fibrinogen and troponin, as well as other 
bioche mistry parameters (AST, ALT, LDH and creatinine) . 
A maximum of six full plasma exchange  sessions will be made during this period: one per 
week .  
The subject will remain in the center  throughout the procedure and then for as long as needed 
to ensure a safe return home, under conditions similar to before plasma exchange.  
Before plasma exchange , a physical examination will be made, with the recording of any 
anomalies.  Concomitant medication is also to be reg istered, together with any adverse event 
detected since the last visit or since the last plasma exchange session.  The anxiety and 
restlessness tests, if necessary, will be performed before each plasma exchange process, and 
between [ADDRESS_420357] acement.  These tests will be carried out by [CONTACT_339803]. Vital signs  (axillary temperature, heart and respi[INVESTIGATOR_41351], and blood pressure) will be 
determined 15- 30 minutes before replacement during and again 15- 30 minutes after the 
proced ure, and as often as considered opportune by [CONTACT_093].  
Any adverse event during or after the procedure, will be recorded.  
Control group 
The control group will undergo simulated (sham) full plasma exchanges  and will follow the 
same schedule of assessments including the lumbar puncture. 
6.2.3 Weeks 7 to 8 – Intermediate visit (Window range +/- 2 days) 
Plasma samples will be collected from the subjects (control and full plasma exchange group)  
to allow the pertinent tests.  Additional plasma samples will be collected each time for storage 
at -70ºC and possible future assays.  
The following tests will be made : biomarkers of AD (Aβ−40, Aβ−42, β -secretase, γ-secretase,  
cholesterol, LDL, HDL, VLDL, and C -reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, IL -1b, IL -6, 
ferritin , ΤΝF-α) and plasma IgG.  
During the visit medical history will be checked with the recording of any anomalies.  
Concomitant medication is also to be registered, together with any adverse event detected 
since the last visit or since the last plasma exchange session.   
Central catheter will be also extracted during this intermediate visit.  
After the intensive plasma exchange period (weeks 1 to 6) and before Maintenance period, 
lumbar puncture will be performed to assess the levels of A β−40, Aβ−42 , P-tau, T -tau and 
other Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers together with standard tests (cell counts, glucose, proteins and albumin).  Time collection for the CSF must be between 8am and 12am.   
During this intermediate visit (weeks 7 to 8)  the fol lowing cognitive  impairment and 
behavioral tests will be made: ADAS -Cog, MMSE, NPS battery, ADCS -ADL, NPI, CDR -Sb, 
ADCS -CGIC , CSDD and CSSRS.  Likewise, anxiety and restlessness tests will be made 
based on the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) and the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), if 
considered opportune. During the study period between week 7 and 8, a FDG -PET and an MRI  will be also carried 
out. 
Control group

same schedule of assessments  as the treated groups  
6.2.4 Months 3 to 14 - Maintenance Period  
Treatment Group s: Maintenance Period (Plasmaphereses + albumin or IVIG) (Window 
range +/- 5 days) 
At months 6, 9, 12 and 14, the following cognitive impairment and behavioral tes ts will be 
made: ADAS -Cog, MMSE, NPS battery, ADCS -ADL , NPI, CDR -Sb, ADCS -CGIC , CSDD,  
CSSRS, QoL -AD and RUD- Lite®. Likewise, anxiety and restlessness tests will be made 
based on the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) and the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), 
whenev er considered opportune. 
The plasma samples of the pat ient will be collected before and 15 -30 minutes after each 
procedure, to allow the pertinent tests.  These plasma samples collected before and after the 
procedure will be stored at -70ºC for possible future assays.  
The following tests will be made before each procedure: biomarkers of AD ( Aβ−40, Aβ−42,  
β-secretase, γ-secretase, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, VLDL, C -reactive protein, rheumatoid 
factor,  IL-1b, IL -6, ferritin , TNF -α), coagulation factors (prothrombin time (Quick), aPTT, 
calcium  and fibrinogen), and proteinogram ( total proteins , albumi n, α 1-globulina, α 2-
globulina, β-globulina, γ- globulina and IgG). In addition, a cell count will be made including 
hematocrit, hemoglobin and erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes (if an abnormal leukocyte count is recorded, it will be obligate to specify  neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, 
lymphocytes and monocytes) . The samples obtained after plasma exchange will only be used 
to evaluate the biomarkers of AD  and, if necessary, to assess coagulation factors . A more 
intense monitoring is not considered mandatory since in this period the procedure is similar to 
a plasma donation plasmapheresis. However, the investigator  can decide to assess other 
parameters for safety reasons.  Other liver or kidney biochemical markers (AST, ALT, 
bilirubin, LDH , creatinine  and troponin), and serology (anti -HIV and HCV antibodies, and 
HBsAg antigen)  will be also done.. 
There will be [ADDRESS_420358] treatment group there will be 9 plasmaphereses with 
infusion of albumin 20% (200 mL, 40 g) at months  4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 and 3 
plasmaphereses with infusion of IVIG (20 g) at months 3, 7 and 11. In the second treatment 
group, the schedule will be the same as previous but with half of the dose of albumin 20% (100 ml, 20 g) and IVIG (10 g). The third treatment group will follow the same schedule but only half -dose albumin (100 ml, 20 g ) will be administered in each of the 12 plasmaphereses, 
that is, this group will not receive IV IG. The plasma removed and the albumin infused after 
the procedure depends on patient’s weight (see Table 1, Appendix 10). 
The subject will remain in the center  throughout the procedure and then for as long as needed 
to ensure a safe return home, under conditions similar to before the procedure. 
Before  each plasmapheresis , a physical examination will be made, with the recording of any 
anomalies. Concomitant medication is also to be registered, together with any adverse event 
detected since the last visit or  since the last plasma exchange session.  
The anxiety and restlessness tests, if necessary, will be performed before each plasmapheresis , 
and between 15 -30 minutes after the administration  of albumin or IVIG .  These tests will be 
carried out by [CONTACT_339804].

6.2.5 Final Visit (Month 14)  
During the final visit medical history will be checked with the recording of any anomalies.  
Concomitant medication is also to be registered, togethe r with any adverse event detected 
since the last visit or since the last plasma exchange session.   
Plasma samples will be collected from the subjects (control and treatment group)  to allow the 
pertinent tests. Additional plasma samples will be collected e ach time for storage at -70ºC and 
possible future assays. 
The following parameters will also be evaluated: biomarkers of AD (A β−40, Aβ−42, β-
secretase, γ-secretase, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, VLDL, C -reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, 
IL-1b, IL -6, ferritin, ΤΝF-α), coagulation factors (prothrombin time (Quick), aPTT, calcium  
and fibrinogen), proteinogram ( total proteins, albumin, α 1-globulina, α 2-globulina, β-
globulina, γ-globulina and IgG), other liver or kidney biochemical markers (AST, ALT, 
bilirubin, LDH and creatinine), troponin and serology (anti -HIV and HCV antibodies, and 
HBsAg antigen).  In addition, a blood cell count will be performed, including: hematocrit, 
hemoglobin and erythrocytes, platelets and leukocytes (if an abnormal leukocyte count is recorded, it will be obligate to specify neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes and monocytes).  
During the final visit a MRI and a FDG- PET will also be performed.  
The following tests will be performed  to measure cognition, functionality, behavior, global 
evolution, impression and depression: ADAS -Cog, MMSE , NPS battery, ADCS -ADL, NPI, 
CDR -Sb, ADCS -CGIC , CSDD,  CSSRS, QoL -AD and RUD- Lite
® which are to be 
administered as indicated in the corresponding section.  Likewise, anxiety and restlessness 
tests will be made based on the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) and the Agitated Behavior 
Scale (ABS), whenever considered opportune. 
Furthermore, it is obligatory to perform lumbar puncture, to collect CSF samples and assess 
the levels of A β−40, Aβ−42,  P-tau, T -tau, β-secretase, γ-secretase, cholesterol, LDL, HDL, 
VLDL, C -reactive protein, IL-1b, IL -6, ferritin, TNF -α) and to perform standard CSF tests 
(cell counts, glucose, proteins and albumin).  
These evaluations are considered to be the final  data. 
Control group 
The control group will undergo the same schedule of assessments. In case the final visit is conducted before completing the study, some assessments could be 
avoided. It will be decided case by [CONTACT_339805] a ssessments have

Protocol IG1002  Page 42 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420359] practice of the center for the obtainment 
of blood, plasma and serum.  The amount of blood and CSF to be collected for all the tests will correspond to the amount 
needed for the assays in each visit or procedure.  The precise amount of each sample will be 
established according to the requirements of the specific laboratory performing the analysis .  
As a recommendation, the minimum amounts are: 
• Plasma samples for frozen back -up (-70oC): 10 m L of blood which, once processed, 
will be divided into three equal plasma aliquots in three cryopreservation tubes . 
• From the plasma bag corresponding to each plasma exchange  (FPE and LVPE) , six 
samples will be obtained, with a maximum volume of two ml each, at each of the  
following time points: 30 minutes after starting replacement, after one hour, and at the 
end of the procedure. Thus, 18 plasma samples will also be obtained in each 
replacement session . The removed plasma bag from the FPE and LVPE will also be 
collected. These samples will  be collected in some selected sites.  
• Aβ and P -tau: 10 m L of blood (to obtain 5 m L of plasma) with EDTA (collection in 
polypropylene tubes is needed, since A β adheres to glass).  In addition, 10 mL of blood 
with EDTAK2 will be obtained separately to assess Aβ in blood. 
• Genetic markers : 4 mL of blood (approximately 2 mL of  plasma) with EDTA.  
• Coagulation parameters: 5 mL of blood (collected according to standard practice of 
the laboratory). 
• Hematological tests: 5 mL of blood (collected according to standard pr actice of the 
laboratory). 
• Proteinogram, biochemistry (kidney and liver function), and serology: 10 m L of blood  
(collected according to standard practice of the laboratory) .  
• CSF: At least a minimum of [ADDRESS_420360] technique employed in the center .  The sample will be 
divided into three aliquots: 3 mL for general tests (cell count, glucose, proteins and 
albumin), 3 mL for A β and P -tau (collected in polypropylene tubes), and 4 mL for 
frozen back- up (-70oC), stored in cryopreservation tubes.  
The CSF aliquot destined for general testing should not be frozen but kept at room 
temperature, with immediate analysis.  The other two aliquots can be immediately 
frozen , however, future testing cannot be done if >[ADDRESS_420361] for 
testing according to the course of the study and investigator criterion (e.g., during the 
Intensive treatment  phase the coagulation parameters are a greater priority than the

proteinogram; in contrast, during screening or the final visit, serology is the most important 
aspect).  
In the event of insufficient CSF volume, priority is to center on the A β and P -tau 
measurements, then reserving two mL for frozen  back -up, and the rest for general testing 
(particularly cell counts).  
During the visits, and after blood collection, processing of the samples to obtain the plasma and/or serum is to be made within two hours.  The blood and plasma and/or serum samples 
will be collected and taken immediately to the site  laboratory for processing.  
The serum and/or plasma samples can be analyzed on the same day (depending on the standard practice of the laboratory and test involved), or stored at -20ºC for analysis within no  
more than two months after collection. 
The routine hematological tests are to be made within a maximum of [ADDRESS_420362] 
to the nature of the study (pre -post condition).  Specifically, the following tests are will be 
performe d (see Appendix 7): 
 
7.1.1 Gold standards for the study of dementia  
Screening: Mini -Mental Status Examination (MMSE)36.  This test is widely used to assess 
cognitive alterations, and is the most commonly used brief s creening test.  The score ranges 
from [ADDRESS_420363] is required to yield 
a score of ≥18 and ≤26 points. 
For the evaluation of cognitive function in AD: Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale -
Cognitive (ADAS -Cog)37.  This is an instrument specifically designed to evaluate the severity 
of the fundamental alterati ons in cognitive and behavioral function that are characteristic of 
patients with AD.  The instrument consists of two parts (ADAS -Cog and ADAS -no Cog): the 
first measures cognitive function and the second (not to be applied in the present study) 
assesses n on-cognitive (behavioral) function.  The first part comprises 11 subtests that explore 
different areas: spoken language skills, test instructions recall, difficulty finding words, 
following instructions, naming objects, construction of figures, ideation praxis, orientation, recall and recognition of words.  Scoring is by [CONTACT_339806], and the total score ranges from 0 (no 
impairment) to 70 (maximum impairment).  
7.1.2 Specific neuropsychological battery (NPS battery)  
a) Processing speed  
Protocol IG1002  Page 44 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420364] (SDMT )38: developed principally for examining 
visual attention  and tracking, concentration and psychomotor speed.  The correct 
symbol-number pairs during 90 seconds are counted.  Maximum score = 110. 
b) Language (global measures)  
i. Semantic and phonetic verbal fluency (animals per minute )39,40: allowing 
voluntary access to a certain vocabulary assessing reduction in verbal spontaneity 
and fluency difficulties. 
ii. [LOCATION_011] Naming Test (BNT )41 reduced to 15 words:   This is an esse ntial test for the 
assessment of semantic memory in dementia evaluation protocols.  The total score 
is the sum of the correct answers given spontaneously, together with the correct answers after a semantic cue.  The first incorrect item is also reflected in the last 
section.  
c) Verbal memory (immediate/delayed)  - Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 
(RAVLT )42:  This is a test of [ADDRESS_420365] (deferred  memory ).  Scoring is based on the number of 
words recognized. 
In addition, the following instruments are included for the measurement of other variables : 
Functional ability  
Activities of daily living: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living 
(ADCS -ADL )43:  This offers detailed descriptions of each activity and requests the informer to 
describe the actions or behaviors observed.  The evaluator describes ability to carry out a 
series of activities of daily life (e.g., personal hygiene, using the phone, leaving home, etc.). The total sum is not calculated, though increased autonomy is associated with higher scores.  
Neuropsychiatric disorders  
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)44:  This evaluates the most frequent neuropsychiatric 
manifestations of dementia and also determines their frequency and intensity.  Generally, the 
NPI [INVESTIGATOR_339745] a given period of time.  The NPI [CONTACT_268016] 12 domains: delusions, hallucinations, dysphoria, 
apathy, euphoria, disinhibition, aggressivity and restlessness, irritability, anxiet y, aberrant 
motor behavior, appetite and eating disorders, and nocturnal behavior.  Each domain 
comprises an exploratory question, where an affirmative answer is followed by a series of seven to nine  follow- up questions relating to symptoms present or not in that particular 
domain.   
Frequency is scored as follows: 0 = none; 1 = occasional [less than once a week ]; 2 = often  
[more or less once a week ]; 3 = frequent [several times a week ]; 4 = very frequent [daily or 
continuously].   Severity is scored as 1 = mild; 2 = moderate [if possible to reconduct by [CONTACT_339807] ]; 3 = 
severe [if not possible to reconduct]. 
The NPI [INVESTIGATOR_339746] ; the total score of the NPI [INVESTIGATOR_339747] (frequency x severity) of all the inventory dom ains.  The score on the stress scale is 
not included in the total NPI [INVESTIGATOR_32005].

Measurement of depression in dementia:  Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia 
(CSDD )45.  This scale evaluates the signs and symptoms of major depression in patients with 
dementia.  The information is obtained from two semistructured interviews - one with the 
caretaker  and the other with the patient.  Each item is scored for inte nsity (0 = none; 1 = mild 
or intermittent; 2 = severe).  
Clinical grading of dementia, global evolution: Clinical Dementia Rating – Sum of boxes 
(CDR -Sb)46,47. This is a clinical test validated in patients with AD.  Impairment is scored as 
follows: 0 = normal; 0.5 = slight cognitive impairment or questionable dementia; 1 = slight 
dementia; 2 = moderate dementia; 3 = severe dementia. Six categories are contemplated: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, social and occupational activities, domestic activities and hobbies, and personal care. 
Clinical global impression of change:  Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical 
Global Impression of Change (ADCS -CGIC )
48.  This instrument offers a method for the 
reliable assessment of global change in a clinical trial from baseline, using a 7 -point Likert 
scale.  It is administered to the caretaker and to the patient.  
7.2 Method of Behavioral and Cognitive Testing

• ADCS -ADL  
• CSDD  
• QoL-AD 
• RUD- Lite 
Evaluators are blinded to patient treatment.  Importantly, the evaluators of the 
neuropsychological tests will not have access to any kind of information allowing them to identify patient assignment to treatment.   
An evalua tor will administer all the neuropsychological battery scales : MMSE, ADAS -Cog,  
NPS Battery, behavior scales  NPI [INVESTIGATOR_339748] -ADL.  
The second evaluator, also on a blind basis, will administer the CDR -Sb and ADCS -CGIC.  
Results fr om previous evaluations will remain unknown for both evaluators and they must not 
comment any result to each other or to other study members and they will be considered blinded evaluators and will sign a document to the effect.  
Anxiety and restlessness tests (during the replacement phase):   
In case any sign of aggression or restlessness during the procedure, the following instruments 
will be used: 
Measurement of overt aggression : Overt Aggression Scale (OAS)49. This instrument measures 
patient aggression and provides a global score as the sum of the scores assigned to each of the 
different items.  Increased severity is associated with higher scores.  
Measurement of restlessness:  Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS)50. This includes 14 items 
grouped into three factors (disinhibition, and liability). The global score is obtained from the 
sum of the scores assigned to the different items. Increased severity is associated with higher scores.  
Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS): 
The scale is currently being used in a variety of settings from clinical trials to clinical practice.  
The Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) was designed to quantify the severity 
of suicidal ideation and behaviour. 
The primary outcomes to evaluate are: suicidal behaviour categorical rating, suicidal ideation 
categorical rating and to estimate the rate of suicidality.  
We are going to use two versions of the scale that are currently being used in clinical trials:  
- The Baseline  version of the scale assesses lifetime suicidal ideation and behavior. 
This version is suitable as part of a patient’s first interview in a private practice or as 
part of a clinical study.  
Protocol IG1002  Page 47 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420366] Visit  version of the scale assesses suicidality since the patient’s last 
visit. This version is meant to assess patients who have completed at least one initial 
C-SSRS assessment, and should be used in every subsequent visit. The ‘Since Last 
Visit’ version of the C -SSRS is asking about any suicidal thoughts or behaviors the 
patient/participant may have had since the last time you have administered the C -
SSRS.  
Quality of Li fe AD Measure (QoL -AD): 
The Q oL-AD is a brief, 13- item measure designed specifically to obtain a rating of the 
patient's Quality of Life from both the patient and the caregiver. It was developed for 
individuals with dementia, based on patient, caregiver, and expert input, to maximize construct validity, and to ensure that the measure focuses on quality of life domains thought to be important in cognitively impaired older adults. It uses simple and straightforward language and responses & includes assessments of the individual's relationships with friends and family, concerns about finances, physical condition, mood, and an overall assessment of life quality. 
Caregivers complete the measure as a questionnaire about their patients’ Q oL, while patients 
complete it in interview format about their own Q oL. The measure consists of 13 items, rated 
on a four point scale, with 1 being poor and 4 being excellent. Total scores range from 13 to 52. It generally takes caregivers about 5 minutes to complete the measure about their patients; for patients, the interview takes about [ADDRESS_420367]  - the sum of all items; patient and caregiver reports can be 
evaluated separately and/or combined into a single score if desired. Patients with MMSE 
scores of 10 or higher can usually complete it with no problem; bel ow that caregivers can 
continue to complete it as proxies indefinitely.  
Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD -Lite©) Questionnaire:  
The Resource Utilization in Dementia (RUD) Questionnaire was developed as a 
comprehensive tool to assess the amount of resource use among demented patients, which in a 
further step can be calculated into costs. It has been used in pharmacoeconomical studies and 
it has proven to be a useful tool in the evaluation of dementia care. RUD Lite© has been 
developed as a new shorter version of the instrument RUD. 
RUD  assesses  both  formal  and  informal  resource  use of  patients  and  the  primary  
caregiver,  making  it possible  to  calculate  costs  from  a  societal  perspective.  It consists of two parts with a similar content,  but the wording is adapted to  a baseline situation  or follow -
up situation(s).  The questionnaire is divided in two parts, the first one is about the patients’ 
and the second one is about the caregivers’ health status and resource use.  
7.3 Method of Biochemical Marker Testing  
Aβ in plasma, CSF and withdrawn plasma and P -tau and T -tau in CSF: These determinations 
will be carried out using ELISA as detailed below:  
• Determination of plasma  and CSF Aβ1−40 (The Genetics Company) and A β1−42 
(Innogenetics and The Gene tics Company)  
• Determination of P-tau and T -tau in CSF  using the Innotest P-tau and Innotest T -tau 
(Innogenetics)  
• Determination of Aβ1−40  and A β1−42 pool in blood (Araclon Biotech).

• Determination of other biomarkers will be assessed from plasma removed sam ples. 
The plasma- EDTA samples will be collected in the course of the study and will be stored 
frozen. The assays will be performed at the same time and in parallel with pre -treatment 
(baseline) samples and post -treatment samples (coded), to avoid modifications related to day 
variations. 
7.[ADDRESS_420368].  
MRI  
MRI will be performed with a 1.5 Tesla magnet with a real -time acquisition sys tem (Real -
time fMRI). LX 9.1 M4 software will be used.  The gradient amplitude will be 40 mT/m, with 
a slew rate of 150 T/m/s.  A schematic representation of the process is provided.  The MRI scans will be examined by  [CONTACT_339809], who in turn 
will issue a safety report  for each subject. Any imaging anomaly will be communicated to the 
investigating team.  
Once all the study MRI scans have been obtained, they will be analyzed using a visual scale 
with the CVHS standards, based on adequate software (3D- SPGR ), including: 
• Brain reconstruction in the axial plane, aligning with a standard reference image 
(MNT T1 matrix)  
• Normal tracing of the hippocampus and of the anterior cingulate region using standard software  
• Analysis of the volume of the hippocampus and of the anterior cingulate region using the LOWI system

Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420371] co -primary efficacy endpoint is to compare the changes to baseline of the cognitive 
scores as measu red by [CONTACT_33341] -Cog between each of the three treatment arms and the control 
group and between the three treatment arms themselves. The second  of the co -primary 
efficacy endpoints  is to compare the changes to baseline of the ADCS -ADL inventory  scores 
between each of the three treatment arms and the control group and between the three 
treatment arms themselves . 
The secondary efficacy endpoint is to assess the variations in  other cognitive scores, AD 
biomarkers and other biochemical parameters. 
8.1 Efficacy variables  
Change from baseline in the cognitive scores as measured by [CONTACT_33341] -Cog (6 measurements: 
weeks -3, -2 or - 1, and 7-8, months 6, 9, 12 and 14).  
Change from baseline in the ADCS -ADL inventory (6 measurements: week s -3, -2 or -1 and 
7-8; month 6, 9, 12 and 14). 8.2 Secondary efficacy variables   
• Change from baseline in the cognitive, functional and neuropsychiatric scores and overall 
development as m easured by [CONTACT_157513], NPS battery , NPI, CDR -Sb, ADCS -CGIC, CSDD, 
C-SSRS. ( 6 measurements: week s -3, -2 or -1 and 7-8, month 6, 9, 1 2 and 14) and QoL -
AD, RUD- Lite® (5 measurements: week s -3, -2 or -1; months 6, 9, 12 and 14). Moreover 
the optional questionnaires  like OAS and ABS could be used at any visit in case any sign 
of aggression or restlessness.  
• Variation in levels of A β1−40 and A β1-42 in CSF in the period between baseline lumbar 
puncture (before the start of the intensive treatment  period) and lumbar punc ture 
immediately after the end of the last plasma exchange (whenever this may be) . 
• Variation in the levels of A β1−40 and A β1−42  in CSF between the finalizatio n and 
beginning of each of the 2 treatment periods.  
• Levels of Aβ1−40 , Aβ1−42, T-tau   and P- tau in CSF throughout the study. 
• Plasma levels of A β1−40 and A β1−42 before  and after each plasma exchange for both 
treatment periods.  
• Structural changes in volume of the hippocampus, posterior cingulate  area, and other 
associated areas by [CONTACT_9268]. Five measurement s will be made (week s -3, -2 or -1 and 7-8; 
months 6, 9 and 14).  
• Variation in FDG -PET patterns ( 4 measurements: weeks -3, -2 or -1 and 7-8; months 9, 
and 14).  
8.3 Safety variables 
The primary criterion of safety will be the percentage of plasma exchanges (full  and low -
volume exchanges, including the infusion of albumin and IVIG) associated with at least one adverse event that may be related to the study procedure (adverse reactions)  within 72 hours 
after infusion completion (or after the infusion stops).  In addition, consideration globally will 
be made of the percentage plasma exchanges (full and low -volume exchanges, including the 
infusion of albumin and IVIG) involving some adverse event, whether or not related to the 
procedure.

Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_339749]) will be recorded 
before, during and after each plasma exchange session, where required. Evaluation will also be made (where required) of the different laboratory test parameters (blood cell counts, platelet  count, troponin, prothrombin time (Quick), aPPT, fibrinogen, total proteins, and 
calcium).  
During the treatment periods (before each plasma exchange) and on the days when there is no replacement, anxiety and restlessness tests will be made based on the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) and the Agitated Behavior Scale (ABS), whenever considered opportune. 
According to the criterion of the investigator, all the clinically important changes in vital 
function, laboratory test parameters and neuroimaging findings wi ll be evaluated.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 
9.1 Adverse Events  
9.1.1 Information to specify  
Descriptions/Definitions : 
- Adverse Event (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necess arily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  
- Adverse Reaction (AR) is all untoward and unintended responses to an investigational 
medicinal product related to any does administered.   
- Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  or Serious Adverse Reaction (SA R) is any untoward medical 
occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life- threatening, requires 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], results in persistent or significant 
disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. 
Likewise, medical criterion will decide whether an event is serious in other situations such as those requiring intervention to prevent some of the aforementioned consequences. 
Medical and scientific criteria will decide whether ot her situations that have not led to the 
outcomes listed in the above definitions should be notified as SAE. By [CONTACT_81428] -threatening event, it is understood a situation which according to the investigator 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], would have led to the patient death in the abse nce of a timely therapeutic 
intervention.  - Unexpected Adverse Event : any adverse experience of a nature or severity that does not 
correspond to the information available in reference to the investigational procedure or study 
drug. Once the adverse event has been evaluated and reasonable bases are established for 
suspecting a causal relation to the study procedure and the SPC for the  study drug s, the event 
is to be classified as an adverse reaction  to the procedure or to the drug . 
Detection and recording:  
 - Method of Detection:  The AEs will be daily collected from a careful clinical observation of 
the patient, laboratory analyses, spontaneous communication from the patient  and also 
through and open questioning from  the investigator  
- Adverse events recordi ng: All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded in 
the patient’s medical records and in the CRF (Adverse Events Form). In addition, the adverse 
Protocol IG1002  Page 52 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February 2018

events related to the A uto-C (FDA PMA approval  # BP850001)  or Aurora  (FDA  510(k) 
clearance # BK110072 ) based devices used in the low -volume plasma exchanges 
(Maintenance period) will be recorded in the specific form attached to the A uto-C ( FDA PMA 
approval # BP850001)  or Aurora (FDA 510(k) clearance # BK110072 ) clinical protocol s 
(Appendix 3). 
In the context of this clinical trial, all incidents clearly related to progression of the disease 
will not be considered as adverse events, and will not be necessary to include them in the 
CRF.   
All adverse events occurring during the study are should be in cluded in the CRF of the 
corresponding patient. The minimum information to be supplied comprises the nature of the event, its time of appearance in relation to the administration, its duration, dose, seriousness, intensity, causality, the actions taken, and the course. If it is a preexisting AE that gets worse regarding intensity or frequency it should be indicated. 
Adverse events will be classified according to severity, depending on the intensity of the event, as follows:  
Mild , when well tolerated by [CONTACT_8130], causing only minimal discomfort, and without 
interfering with the activities of daily living (ADL)  
Moderate, when interfering with activities of daily living  
Intense or severe, when impeding activities of daily living  
Severity must be distinguish ed from seriousness, which is based on the consequence of the 
adverse event.  For example, a headache may be mild, moderate or severe, though rarely is it 
serious.  
9.1.[ADDRESS_420372], it will be considered the temporal relation ship 
between drug administration and the AE, possible alternative causes, evolution (complete 
remission, partial recovery, death and sequelae), persistence or not after drug discontinuation, reappearance with drug re- administration, or  the previous knowledge of the event matching 
up with the known or expected response pattern of the study drug. 
The following definitions will be used to establish cause- effect relationships:  
Definitive : the adverse event occurs after a reasonable time seq uence related to the study drug 
administration or study procedure, with a known response model, but cannot be explained by 
[CONTACT_339810], confirmed by [CONTACT_339811], and with relapse after reintroducing treatment.  
Probable: the adverse event occurs after a reasonable time sequence related to the study drug 
administration or study procedure, with a known response model, confirmed by [CONTACT_339812], and that cannot be explained by [CONTACT_339813]. 
Possible: the adverse event occurs after a reasonable time sequence related to the study drug 
administration or study procedure, with a known response model, but can be explained by [CONTACT_339810]. 
Unlikely : the adverse event occurs after a reasonable time sequence related to the study drug 
administration or study procedure, not following a known response model, and that cannot be 
explained by [CONTACT_339814].

Unrelated: Any other adverse event.  
9.1.3 Expected adverse events  
There are a series of expected adverse events  attributable to the plasma exchange procedure, 
with others that are inherent to the replacement fluid used (human albumin).  Lastly, other 
events are a consequence of patient disease or idiosyncrasy.  
The expected adverse events of plasma exchange are the following: hypocalcaemia 
(manifesting as paresthesias, headache, vision alterations, nausea, cramps and chest oppression) , anaemia and coagulation disorders secondary to coagulation factor dilution  
(mainly hypofibrinogenemia, with possible minor bleeding associated to severe thrombopenia).  Hypotension may occur  (accompanied by [CONTACT_339815], perspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], bradycardia, 
nausea, vomiting, syncope, sphincter relaxation and seizures); though the risk is minimal, since the infusion amount is equivalent to the extracted amount.  Allergic reactions  are also 
possible, with ur ticaria, dyspnea, wheezing, hypotension, tachycardia, facial reddening and 
palpebral edema.  Other events  may be of psychological origin or may be inherent to the 
process, such as for example pain after remaining immobile for several hours.  
As indicated b y the Full Prescribing Information  (Appendix 1 ), the Albutein® specific 
adverse events are mild reactions such as reddening, urticaria, fever and nausea. Such reactions are rare and normally subside when the perfusion rate is reduced or perfusion is suspended. Anaphylactic shock may be observed in isolated cases. In such situations, perfusion is to be suspended immediately with the provision of adequate treatment. 
Albutein
® is obtained from human plasma. The controls applied in the centers where the 
plasma is obtained, and in the fractionation plant, as well as the validated infectious agent 
inactivation/elimination procedures included in the production process, are all designed to 
minimize the risk of transmission of infectious disease. In any case, when dealing with blood products it is not possible to fully rule out possible transmission of infectious agents. This also refers to the possible transmission of unknown pathogens. 
In a 1996 review of the adverse effects of plasma exchange in patients with Guill ain-Barré 
syndrome involving albumin replacements, a decrease in immediate adverse effects from 12% 
in 1986 to 7% in [ADDRESS_420373] to Flebogamma
®DIF (see Full Prescribing Information , Appendix 2 ) Adverse 
reactions such as chills, headache, fever, vomiting, allergic reactions, nausea, arthralgia, low 
blood pressure and moderate low back pain may occur occasionally. Rarely human normal immunoglobulins may cause a sudden fall in blood pressure and, in isolated cases, anaphylactic shock, even when the patient has shown no hypersensitivity to previous administration. Cases of reversible a septic meningitis, isolated cases of reversible haemolytic 
anaemia/haemolysis and rare cases of transient cutaneous reactions, have been observed with human normal immunoglobulin. Increase in serum creatinine level and/or acute renal failure have been obse rved. Very rarely: Thromboembolic reactions such as myocardial infarction, 
stroke, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thromboses. 
In addition, there may be adverse events related to the concomitant medication provided. 
Thus, acetilcolinesterase inhibitors have been associated with diarrhea, muscle cramps, 
fatigue, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, headache, pain, accidents, common cold, gastrointestinal problems and dizziness. There have also been sporadic reports of syncope, bradycardia, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, seizures, liver dysfunction, psychiatric problems

(hallucinations, restlessness and aggressive  behavior), anorexia, gastric and duodenal ulcers, 
gastrointestinal bleeding, extrapyramidal symptoms, and a small increase in serum muscle 
creatine kinase (CK).  
9.2 Procedures for the immediate notification of serious adverse events  
Immediate notification of serious  adverse events (expected or unexpected) by [CONTACT_1275]:  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_339750]  (CRO)  all serious adverse events (SAEs)  regardless of the study drug causality. The 
notification deadline (whether expected or unexpected) will be 24h from the moment the investigator first receives news of the event..  
The initial submission  of the SAE (whether expected or unexpected) must be done in less than 
24h by [CONTACT_339816]  (Contact [CONTACT_6968] : 
[EMAIL_6575]
, fax number: 0800 24 25 26 27). 
Moreover, this information must be subsequently completed within a maximum of 3 days using the Serious Adverse Event Notification form. The form will be preferably sent via email 
or by [CONTACT_339817].  
In case of SAE (expected or unexpected), the investigator should provide to United BioSource 
Corporation Safety Team  all the information related to the event (additional laboratory tests, 
discharge report, etc).  
In case of death, the investigator should provide to United BioSource Corporation Safety 
Team  and to the Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board involved, all the additional 
information requested. Serious and unexpected adverse events potentially related to the study drug will be promptly 
reported to the Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board involved and to the Health 
Authorities in accordance with the applicable legislation. All adverse events will be reported tabulated in the final clinical trial report.  
 
10. 
STATISTICAL METHODS  
10.1.[ADDRESS_420374] one plasma exchange session (i.e., 
randomized and treated) during the intensive treatment phase (the six first weeks of treatment) 
will form part of the efficacy population.  
Control group subjects will also be included (without the plasma exchange) if they attended at 
least 1  of the 6 intensive treatment phase visits.  
A second efficacy analysis will also be carried out (per protocol analysis) with the patients who complete the treatment without major breaches in the study protocol.  
10.1.2 Missing Data  
Subjects with missing values for a given efficacy value at baseline of at the time  point 
analyzed will be treated as missing rather than using imputed values.  More details regarding 
handling of missing data will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
 
Protocol IG1002  Page 55 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420375] quartiles.  
All categorical variables will be summarized by [CONTACT_249615] y tables.  
Equality of the baseline characteristics between the treatment groups will be assessed by 
[CONTACT_339818]. 
10.2 Assessment of Efficacy 
10.2.1 General  
In general, t he statistical tests will be performed with a 5% significance level and will be two -
sided. In addition to the tests, two-sided 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) will be reported.  
Specifically, the null hypothesis for all inferential analys es, including the primary endpoint, is 
that all three treatment groups are equal to placebo. Specific doses  will be considered different 
from placebo if statistically significant following the Hochberg procedure described below . 
The study is considered positive if at least one dose group differs from placebo in the primary 
analysis. Subsequently, secondary endpoints are considered positive if at least one dose group differs from placebo. 
More details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  
10.2.2 Primary Endpoint 
The co -primary endpoints, changes from baseline of the ADAS -Cog scores and change from 
baseline in the ADCS -ADL inventory, will be assessed with the principal analytical objective 
being to determine whether there are differences between each of the 3 treatment groups and 
the control group. In addition, a comparison between the 3 treatment groups will be performed.  
Success of the study is determined by [CONTACT_339819] -Cog score 
at 14 months  and the change from baseline in the ADCS -ADL inventory score  ADAS -Cog 
and ADCS -ADL  scores at remaining time  points are considered to be secondary to the scores 
at month 14. Missing  
The mean change from baseline in both the ADAS -Cog and ADCS -ADL scores will be  
analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
 with adjustment for respective baseline as 
the covariate to  compare the differen ce between each treatment group and the placebo group 
in the efficacy population.   
If the data distribution assumptions are significantly violated, a non- parametric analysis will 
be used. If the test for either normality of error terms or equality of erro r variances fails at the 
significance level of 0.01, the rank ANCOVA procedure will be applied.  The standardized 
ranks for both covariate and the response variable will be produced for each stratum.  Then linear regression models will be performed on ranked data by [CONTACT_339820].  Finally the stratified mean score test using the value of the residuals as scores will compare the treatment groups using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel procedure.  
 
Protocol IG1002  Page 56 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420376] for the 
co-primary endpoints. However, to account for the three dose group comparisons to placebo 
and to maintain the overall significance level of 0.05, adjustment for α will be made for multiple dose groups according to the Hochberg procedure.
 The Hochberg procedure will be 
implemented as follows: For each endpoint the three dose group comparisons versus placebo 
will be ordered according to the p- value from the largest to the smallest.  If the largest p -value 
is < 0.[ADDRESS_420377] p -value is < 0.025 (0.05/2) then this dose and all doses wit h smaller p -values will be 
declared significant. Otherwise  if the smallest p -value is < 0.0167 (0.05/3) then this dose will 
be declared significant. Otherwise, no dose is considered significantly different from placebo. This procedure has been demonstrated to control the overall Type  I error at 0.05. Both co-
primary endpoints must be significant at a given dose to provide evidence of efficacy for that dose. 
A supportive analysis will be performed in per protocol analysis set for the primary efficacy 
endpoint applying the same respective methodologies, but without adjusting for Type I error.  
10.2.3 Secondary Endpoints 
All continuous secondary endpoints (Section 8.2) will be tested in a manner identical to the 
primary analysis, with the corresponding baseline used as the covari ate. 
10.3 Evaluation of T olerability  
The analysis of tolerability will be based on description of the safety variables according to their nature.  In addition, a comparison of Adverse Drug Reactions between the treatment and 
the control groups will be performed.  
The adverse reactions will be coded according to the adverse events classification of the World Health Organization (WHO ) (MeDRA current version), and will be described by a 
synonym (Lowest Level Term) and the affected organ / system, the intensity, causality and seriousness.  
10.4 Intermediate Analysis and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
A descriptive analysis is planned once half of the subjects are undergoing low -volume plasma 
exchanges.  
Serious adverse events related to full plasma exchanges (performed during the first six 
weeks), AEs leading to withdrawal of the study and additional safety measures if required will be monitored by [CONTACT_339821] a regular basis. Special focus will be put on those SAEs considered as related to the therapeutic procedure or I nvestigational Product(s) by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_339751]. Additional common side effects might also be analyzed if significantly higher proportions are found in any of the treatment arms. 
Under the following circumstances the inde pendent DMC will recommend to halt the trial 
partly (stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a specific treatment arm) temporarily (until modifications to the protocol are 
completed) or wholly (abandon all study activities):  
- If more than 30% of patients undergoing full plasma exchanges  experience an 
SAE as defined by [CONTACT_339822] “Definitively related to the therapeutic procedure” or “Probably related to the therapeutic procedure” or “Possibly related to the therapeutic procedure” and not attributable to the Investigational Prod ucts, as judged by [CONTACT_458].

SAE as defined by [CONTACT_339822] “Definitively related to the Investigational Product(s)” or “Probably related to the Invest igational 
Product(s)” or “Possibly related to the Investigational Product(s)” and not attributable to the therapeutic procedure or technique of application, as judged by [CONTACT_458].  
 
10.5 Conduction of the Statistical Analysis 
The statistical analysis will be carried out by [CONTACT_339823] (United 
Biosource Corporation). 
 
11. 
CHANGES TO THE PROTOCOL  
Any attached document or document related to the present study protocol must be considered 
as part of the latter.  
After protocol review and signing, neither the investigators nor the sponsor may introduce 
modifications or alterations without written approval from both parties.  
Any modification or alteration of the protocol after signing of the latter must be jointly 
discussed and approved by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_38107], and must be signed by [CONTACT_17588].  Protocol amendments are to be incorporated as part of the original protocol. The Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)  must be informed of all protocol amendments that may affect the safet y 
of the participating subjects or conduction of the trial. Amendment approval must be requested if considered necessary.  
 
12. 
ETHICS 
12.1 General Considerations 
The ethical standards adopted by [CONTACT_339824] (and subseque nt revisions) will be strictly observed  (Appendix 5).  The trial 
likewise will be performed in compliance with European Union standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP) relating to trials involving drug products64 (see Appendix 6 for the 
responsibilities of the sponsor, monitor and investigator). 
The study cannot begin until an Institutional R eview Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee and 
the health authorities (if necessary) have approved the protocol, the informed consent document, and the patient information sheets.  The study file is to include a letter of approval 
of the Institutional Review Bo ard or Ethics Committee before the trial is started.  The 
Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee must be informed of all protocol 
amendments that may affect the safety of the participating subjects or conduction of the trial.   
All serious or unexpected adverse reactions and other information that may alter the study design or entail patient risk must be reported to the Committee. The study file must also contain a list of the members of the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee, 
indicating those who participated in the discussion. 
An individual code  will be used for the identification of patients . A subject information sheet 
is to be elaborated and filed at the center.  
Protocol IG1002  Page 58 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420378]  will not be able to  participate unless both he/she  and the relative or legal 
representative sign the consent form. The informed consent document is elaborated in such a way that at least the relative / care 
taker is able to understand all the implications of patient participation in the study.  
According to the experts, since only mild- moderate disease cases are involved in the study, it 
is very likely that the patients themselves will have no difficulties understanding the implications of participation in the study.  
If the study hypothesis is confirmed, direct clinical benefit for the subject may be expected.  
The method explored is warranted by [CONTACT_339825]. 
12.2 Written Informed Consent and Information 
The study characteristics will be duly described to all subjects amenable to participation in the 
trial (or to the legal representatives in the case the patient is unable) - followed by [CONTACT_339826].  The subject and the accepted legal representative of the 
subject will be informed of the nature, purpose and procedures of the study, with a description 
of the possible risks involved. 
The subject (and representative) will be informed of the voluntary nature of participation, and 
of the right to withdraw from the study at any time, without this implying any negative 
consequences for the patient.  They must also be informed that the sponsor, its 
representatives, and the supervising authorities may hav e access to the subject’s information. 
If the subject (and relative/legal representative) agrees  to participation in the study, the 
consent document must be signed accordingly, and filed by [CONTACT_339827].  If the subject is unable, the legal representative must sign the consent form.  The 
subject should also do so as far as possible.  The subject will not be able to participate until 
he/she (and/or the legal representative) sign the consent form.  
Informed  consent must also be signe d by [CONTACT_339828] (when patient’s relative is not available ), who will serve as witness. This 
relative must receive the same information as the subject.  
 The investigator or the study personnel obtaining consent (if different from the investigator) 
will also sign and date the consent form, thus reflecting that informed consent has been 
obtained, and that the subject (and his/her representative) has had the opportunity to ask 
questions, and has received adequate answer s. 
The subject  and relative/legal representative will receive a copy of the informed consent form 
and of the subject information sheet.  The original will be filed along with the study 
documentation. 
12.[ADDRESS_420379] Records 
All data related to the procedure, medications, patents, scientific information and other data 
on materials will be considered confidential, and are the property of the sponsor. 
Protocol IG1002  Page 59 of 68 
Version 5.0 (IND version)  / February [ADDRESS_420380] participating in the trial, where the investigator is to 
include all the information relating to the patient and the treatment.  Data will be collected 
using specifically designed case report forms (CRF) that will be in an electronic version . The 
personal information of each subject needed for the study (age, sex, health data, etc.) is 
confidential, and the identity of the subject  will not be disclosed except for the purposes of the 
study and in the event of a medical emergency or if required by [CONTACT_2371].  The personal 
information obtained will be kept and processed by a computer system ensuring confidentiality.  
The investigator accepts that the sponsor may use the results of the clinical trial, including 
CRF database or their copi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or reports with or without comments, and with or without 
analyses, to submit them to the authorities in charge of granting the license, and may reveal them if need be to other investigators.  To allow use of the information obtained in the clinical 
trial, the investigator understands that he/she is obliged to supply the sponsor with full results 
of the tests and all the information developed during the study. 
12.[ADDRESS_420381] and Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
The present protocol and all the required documentation will be subject to evaluation by [CONTACT_339829] e, in order to 
obtain the required authorization before starting the study. 
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established for this trial in order 
to monitor its progress and enhance the safety of trial participants. Review of unblinded interim data will include comparison of adverse event rates occurring in each treatment arm and the control group with special attention given to serious events in order to perform a risk/benefit assessment. The committee will be responsible for making re commendations to 
the sponsor regarding continuation, early termination or modification of study activities based on the analysis of accumulating outcome data.  Aspects of study conduct such as protocol 
adherence, patient withdrawal, and timeliness  of data submission, eligibility rates and reasons 
for ineligibility will also be monitored by [CONTACT_1363].   
12.5 Responsibilities of the Participants in the Clinical Trial, and A pplicable

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
WARNING: THROMBOSIS, RENAL DYSFUNCTION, and ACUTE RENAL FAILURE
• Thrombosis may occur with immune globulin products, including FLEBOGAMMA 5% DIF. Risk factors may 
include: advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial 
thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk 
factors. Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors. (see Warnings and Precautions [5.4] and 
Patient Counseling Information [17])
• For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer FLEBOGAMMA 5% DIF at the minimum dose and infusion rate 
practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of 
thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patient at risk for hyperviscosity. (see Dosage and Administration 
[2.3] and Warnings and Precautions [5.4])
• Renal dysfunction, acute renal failure, osmotic nephrosis, and death
[ADDRESS_420392] been related to intravenous 
immune globulin (IGIV) products. Patients predisposed to acute renal failure include patients with any 
degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, 
paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs. 
• Administer FLEBOGAMMA 5% DIF at the minimum dose and rate of infusion practicable in patients at risk for 
renal dysfunction or failure.
• Reports of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure occur more commonly in patients receiving IGIV 
products containing sucrose as a stabilizer. They account for a disproportionate share of the total number of 
reported cases of renal dysfunction and acute renal failure. FLEBOGAMMA 5% DIF does not contain sucrose. (see Dosage and Administration [2.3] and Warnings and Precautions [5.2])
1 INDICATIONS AND [LOCATION_003]GE
Flebogamma 5% DIF is an immune globulin intravenous (human) solution indicated in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of 
age and older for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency (PI), including the humoral immune defects in common variable 
immunodeficiency, x-linked agammaglobulinemia, severe combined immunodeficiency, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. 
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
For Intravenous Use Only  
2.1 Dosage 
Treatment of Primary Immunodeficiency (PI)
Dose Initial Infusion Rate Maintenance Dose Rate 
(if tolerated)
300-600 mg per kg body weight (6.0-12.0 mL 
per kg) administered every 3-4 weeks0.01 mL per kg per minute (0.5 mg 
per kg per min)Increase to 0.10 mL per kg per 
minute (5 mg per kg per min)
As there are significant differences in the half-life of IgG among patients with PI, the frequency and amount of 
immunoglobulin therapy may vary from patient to patient. Adjust the dose according to the clinical response.
Adjust the dosage over time to achieve the desired trough IgG levels and clinical responses. No randomized controlled trial dat a 
are available to determine an optimum target trough serum IgG level.2.2 Preparation and Handling 
• Inspect Flebogamma 5% DIF visually for particulate matter and color prior to administration. Do not use the vial if 
particles are detected. Do not use if turbid. 
• Several vials of Flebogamma 5% DIF may be pooled into an empty sterile solution container by [CONTACT_301285], if large doses are to be administered.
• Do not dilute with intravenous fluids. Do not inject other medications into intravenous tubing being used for 
Flebogamma 5% DIF.
• Infuse Flebogamma 5% DIF through a separate intravenous line. Do not add any medications or intravenous fluids 
to the Flebogamma 5% DIF infusion container. Do not mix IGIV products of different formulations or from different 
manufacturers.
• Discard unused contents and administration devices after use.• Use promptly any vial that has been entered.• Discard partially used vials. Do not save for future use because the solution contains no preservative. • Do not use solution that has been frozen.
2.3 Administration
The recommended initial infusion rate of Flebogamma 5% DIF is 0.01 mL per kg body weight per minute (0.5 mg per kg per min). If the infusion is well-tolerated during the first 30 minutes, the rate may be gradually increased to a maximum of 
0.10 mL per kg per minute (5 mg per kg per min).
Monitor patient vital signs throughout the infusion. Slow or stop infusion if adverse reactions occur. If symptoms subside 
promptly, the infusion may be resumed at a lower rate that is comfortable for the patient.
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
Flebogamma 5% DIF is a liquid preparation containing 5% IgG (50 mg per mL).
4 CONTRAINDICATIONS 
• Flebogamma 5% DIF is contraindicated in patients who have had a history of anaphylactic or severe systemic 
hypersensitivity reactions to the administration of human immune globulin. 
• Flebogamma 5% DIF is contraindicated in IgA-deficient patients with antibodies to IgA and a history of hypersensitivity. 
(see Warnings and Precautions [5.1])  
5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Hypersensitivity  
Severe hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylactic reactions with a fall in blood pressure may occur, even in patients who 
had tolerated previous treatment with IGIV. (see Contraindications [4]) If hypersensitivity reaction develops, discontinue 
Flebogamma 5% DIF infusion immediately and institute appropriate treatment. 
Flebogamma 5% DIF contains trace amounts of IgA (less than 50 μg/mL). (see Description [11])  Patients with antibodies to 
IgA have a greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_339758]. Flebogamma 5% DIF is 
contraindicated in patients with antibodies against IgA and a history of hypersensitivity reaction. (see Contraindications [4])  
5.2 Renal Dysfunction/Failure
Acute renal dysfunction/failure, acute tubular necrosis, proximal tubular nephropathy, osmotic nephrosis, and death have 
been reported in patients receiving IGIV, particularly those products containing sucrose
2. Flebogamma 5% DIF does not 
contain sucrose.
Ensure that patients are not volume-depleted before administering Flebogamma 5% DIF. For patients judged to be at risk 
for developi[INVESTIGATOR_339759], including patients with any degree of pre-existing renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, 
age greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or patients receiving known nephrotoxic drugs, administer 
Flebogamma 5% DIF at the minimum dose and rate of infusion practicable3. (see Boxed Warning, Dosing and Administration [2.3])  
Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased risk 
of developi[INVESTIGATOR_1654]1. Assess renal function, including measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum 
creatinine, before the initial infusion of Flebogamma 5% DIF and at appropriate intervals thereafter. If renal function 
deteriorates, consider discontinuation of the product. 
5.3 Hyperproteinemia, Increased Serum Viscosity, and Hyponatremia
Hyperproteinemia, increased serum viscosity, and hyponatremia may occur in patients receiving Flebogamma 5% DIF therapy. 
It is clinically critical to distinguish true hyponatremia from a pseudohyponatremia that is temporally or causally related 
to hyperproteinemia with concomitant decreased calculated serum osmolarity or elevated osmolar gap, because treatment 
aimed at decreasing serum free water in patients with pseudohyponatremia may lead to volume depletion, a further increase 
in serum viscosity, and a higher risk of thrombosis. 
5.4 Thrombosis
Thrombosis may occur following treatment with immune globulin products, including FLEBOGAMMA 5% DIF . Risk 
factors may include advanced age, prolonged immobilization, hypercoagulable conditions, history of venous or arterial thrombosis, use of estrogens, indwelling central vascular catheters, hyperviscosity, and cardiovascular risk factors. 
Thrombosis may occur in the absence of known risk factors.
Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with cryoglobulins, 
fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies. (see Warnings 
and Precautions [5.10])  For patients at risk of thrombosis, administer FLEBOGAMMA 5% DIF at the minimum dose 
and infusion rate practicable. Ensure adequate hydration in patients before administration. Monitor for signs and symptoms of thrombosis and assess blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity. (see Boxed Warning, Dosage 
and Administration [2.3], and Patient Counseling Information [17])
5.5 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)
AMS has been reported to occur following IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission 
of AMS within several days without sequelae
4-7. The symptoms of AMS usually begin within several hours to 2 days 
following IGIV treatment.
AMS is characterized by [CONTACT_339837]: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, 
painful eye movements, nausea, and vomiting. (see Patient Counseling Information [17])  Cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) studies 
frequently reveal pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter, predominantly from the granulocytic series, 
and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological 
examination to patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.
AMS may occur more frequently following high-dose (e.g. over 1.0 g per kg body weight) or rapid infusion of IGIV.  
5.6 Hemolysis
Flebogamma 5% DIF may contain blood group antibodies that may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo  coating of red blood 
cells (RBCs) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) (Coombs’ test) result and hemolysis8-11. 
Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration and acute hemolysis, 
consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported12. Cases of severe hemolysis-related renal dysfunction/failure or 
disseminated intravascular coagulation have occurred following infusion of IGIV. 
The following risk factors may be associated with the development of hemolysis following IGIV administration: high doses 
(e.g., at least 2 g per kg), given either as a single administration or divided over several days, and non-O blood group13. Other 
individual patient factors, such as an underlying inflammatory state (as may be reflected by, for example, elevated C-reactive 
protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate), have been hypothesized to increase the risk of hemolysis following administration 
of IGIV14, but their role is uncertain. Hemolysis has been reported following administration of IGIV for a variety of indications, 
including ITP and PI11. Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis, particularly patients with risk factors 
noted above. Consider appropriate laboratory testing in higher risk patients, including measurement of hemoglobin or hematocrit  
prior to infusion and within [ADDRESS_420393] been observed, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing. If transfusion is indicated 
for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving IGIV, perform adequate cross-matching 
to avoid exacerbating on-going hemolysis. (see Patient Counseling Information [17])5.7 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) 
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema has been reported in patients following IGIV treatment15. TRALI is characterized by 
[CONTACT_339838][INVESTIGATOR_1506], pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_339760] 1 to 6 hours after transfusion. 
Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. (see Patient Counseling Information [17])  If TRALI is suspected, 
perform appropriate tests for the presence of antineutrophil antibodies and anti-HLA antibodies in both the product and 
patient serum. TRALI may be managed by [CONTACT_339839]. 
5.8 Infusion Reactions
Individuals receiving Flebogamma 5% DIF for the first time, or being restarted on the product after a treatment hiatus of 
more than 8 weeks, may be at a higher risk for the development of fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting. Careful monitoring 
of recipi[INVESTIGATOR_339761]. (see Dosage and Administration [2.3])  
5.9 Transmissible Infectious Agents
Because Flebogamma 5% DIF is made from human plasma, it may carry a risk of transmitting infectious agents, 
e.g., viruses, the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) agent and, theoretically, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) 
agent. This also applies to unknown or emerging viruses and other pathogens. No cases of transmission of viral diseases 
or CJD have been associated with the use of Flebogamma 5% DIF . All infections suspected by a physician possibly to have 
been transmitted by [CONTACT_339840] [PHONE_7059]. 
Before prescribing or administering Flebogamma 5% DIF, the physician should discuss the risks and benefits of its use 
with the patient. (see Patient Counseling Information [17])
5.10 Monitoring: Laboratory Tests
• Periodic monitoring of renal function and urine output is particularly important in patients judged to be at increased 
risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_1654]. Assess renal function, including measurement of BUN and serum creatinine, 
before the initial infusion of Flebogamma 5% DIF and at appropriate intervals thereafter. 
• Consider baseline assessment of blood viscosity in patients at risk for hyperviscosity, including those with 
cryoglobulins, fasting chylomicronemia/markedly high triacylglycerols (triglycerides), or monoclonal gammopathies 
because of the potentially increased risk of thrombosis.
• If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after an infusion of Flebogamma 5% DIF , perform appropriate 
laboratory testing for confirmation.
• If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of antineutrophil antibodies and anti-HLA antibodies 
in both the product and patient serum. 
5.11 Interference with Laboratory Tests  
After infusion of IgG, the transitory rise of the various passively transferred antibodies in the patient’s blood may yield pos itive 
serological testing results, with the potential for misleading interpretation. Passive transmission of antibodies to erythrocyt e 
antigens (e.g. A, B, and D) may cause a positive direct or indirect antiglobulin (Coombs’) test.
5.12   Hereditary Fructose Intolerance
Flebogamma 5% DIF contains sorbitol. The presence of sorbitol presents a risk to those with hereditary fructose intolerance (HF I). 
The incidence of HFI is estimated at 1 in 20,000 births and is usually diagnosed at the time of weaning when fructose or sucros e 
is introduced into the diet. Clinical symptoms include recurrent vomiting, abdominal pain and hypoglycemia. Flebogamma 5% DIF 
must not be administered to subjects with HFI. 
[ADDRESS_420394] common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of clinical trial adult subjects) were headache, pyrexia/fever, pain , 
infusion site reactions, diarrhea, rigors or chills, urticaria, and infusion site inflammation. 
The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of clinical trial pediatric subjects) were headache, pyrexia, 
hypotension, tachycardia, diastolic hypotension, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, pain, and vomiting. 
To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact [CONTACT_339836] 1-888-GRIFOLS ([PHONE_7059]) or FDA at 
1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.
6.[ADDRESS_420395] the rates observed in clinical practice.
Adverse reactions were reported in a study of 46 individuals with PI [INVESTIGATOR_339762] 3 to 4 weeks of 300-600 mg per k g 
body weight. Thirty-one subjects (67.4%) had at least one adverse reaction at some time during the study that was considered product-related. None of the [ADDRESS_420396] 5% on a per-subject basis are summarized in Table 1.

pain (not otherwise specified), and abdominal pain upper.
c.  include combined reported terms of infusion site inflammation and others such as injection site oedema and injection site s welling.
Other common adverse drug reactions reported in fewer than 5% of the subjects included hypertension, sinusitis, 
nausea/vomiting, positive Coombs test, arthralgia, myalgia, dizziness, bronchitis, and hypotension.
The total number of adverse reactions reported whose onset were within 72 hours after the end of an infusion of  
Flebogamma 5% DIF was 94. There were a total of 709 infusions, resulting in a ratio of 0.13 temporally associated adverse 
reactions per infusion (the upper bound of the 1-sided 95% confidence interval = 0.18). Of the 709 total infusions, 70 (9.7%, 
1-sided 95% upper bound CI = 12.4%) were associated with at least one adverse reaction that began within [ADDRESS_420397] 
one mild adverse reaction (8.2% [upper bound 95% CI=10.5%]), [ADDRESS_420398] one moderate adverse reaction 
(3.5% [upper bound 95% CI=5.2%]), and 1 infusion with a severe adverse reaction (0.1% [upper bound 95% CI=0.8%]). In 
this analysis, if a subject reported multiple events with different intensities during the same infusion (e.g., mild headache 
and moderate pyrexia), that infusion would be counted in all relevant categories. Therefore, the number of infusions counted 
is 84.
Three subjects (6.5%) experienced a treatment-emergent rise in AST (> 3x the upper-limit of normal), and [ADDRESS_420399] (2.2%) 
experienced a treatment-emergent rise in ALT (> 3x the upper-limit of normal). None of these abnormal lab values were 
long-lasting (i.e. they occurred at 1 or 2 infusions), and none of these subjects had a concomitant treatment-emergent rise 
in total bilirubin. 
A clinical study with Flebogamma 5% DIF for the treatment of PI [INVESTIGATOR_339763] 24 pediatric subjects aged 2-16 years 
to determine whether they respond differently from adult subjects. Pediatric subjects received intravenous infusions of 
262-625 mg per kg body weight every 3-4 weeks. Twenty subjects (83.3%) had at least one adverse reaction at some time 
during the study that was considered product-related. There were no deaths or serious adverse reactions. 
In 317 infusions, 20 pediatric subjects reported 159 treatment-related adverse drug reactions (ADR). Treatment-related 
adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of at least 5% on a per-subject basis included headache (42%), pyrexia 
(29%), hypotension (25%), tachycardia (25%), diastolic hypotension (21%), nausea (8%), abdominal pain (8%), 
diarrhea (8%), pain (8%), and vomiting (8%). Of these, [ADDRESS_420400] was headache. Tachycardia was defined as mild, moderate, or severe by [CONTACT_339841] 1.2-1.4, 1.41-1.6, or >1.6, respectively. Two epi[INVESTIGATOR_339764] 
[ADDRESS_420401] had no action taken, and all resolved. Hypotension 
was defined as mild, moderate, or severe by [CONTACT_339842] 10-15%, 16-25%, and >25%, 
respectively. Ten epi[INVESTIGATOR_12981]/diastolic hypotension were moderate and [ADDRESS_420402] (6.5%) experienced a treatment-emergent rise in ALT (over 2.5x the upper-limit of normal). This was considered 
a mild treatment-related AE and resolved without sequelae. All other lab values were within normal limits. One subject 
experienced one positive Coombs’ test result after baseline (experienced 14 days after the final infusion). No subjects 
experienced clinically significant abnormal lab values for LDH, bilirubin, serum creatinine. In addition, no subjects 
experienced positive test results for HBsAg, HCV, or HIV.

appropriate measures can be taken (see Patient Counseling Information [17])
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Ris
k Summary
There are no studies of Flebogamma 5% DIF use in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not been performed 
with Flebogamma 5% DIF . It is also not known whether Flebogamma 5% DIF can cause fetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Immunoglobulins cross the placenta from maternal circulation 
increasingly after 30 weeks of gestation. Flebogamma 5% DIF should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.
8.2 Lactation
Risk Summary
There is no information regarding the presence of Flebogamma 5% DIF in human milk, its effects on the breastfed infant, 
or its effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along 
with the mother’s clinical need for Flebogamma 5% DIF and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from 
Flebogamma 5% DIF or from the underlying maternal condition.
8.4 Pediatric Use
Flebogamma 5% DIF was studied in a multicenter clinical trial for the treatment of PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] 24 subjects aged 2-16 years 
(seven were 2-5 years of age, seven were 6-11 years, and ten were 12-16 years), and found to be efficacious for the 
prevention of acute serious bacterial infections. No pediatric-specific dose requirements were necessary to achieve the 
desired serum IgG levels.
Twenty subjects (83.3%) had at least one adverse reaction at some time during the study that was considered product-related. 
There were no deaths or serious adverse reactions. Treatment-related adverse reactions that occurred with an incidence of at 
least 5% on a per-subject basis included headache (42%), pyrexia (29%), hypotension (25%), tachycardia (25%), diastolic 
hypotension (21%), nausea (8%), abdominal pain (8%), diarrhea (8%), pain (8%), and vomiting (8%).
Safety and efficacy of Flebogamma 5% DIF in pediatric patients below the age of [ADDRESS_420404] not been established. 
8.5 Geriatric Use
Limited information is available for the geriatric use of Flebogamma 5% DIF . Clinical studies of Flebogamma 5% DIF did not 
include sufficient numbers of subjects over the age of 65 to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. 
Use caution when administering Flebogamma 5% DIF to patients age 65 and over who are judged to be at increased risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_339766]. Do not exceed recommended dose, and administer Flebogamma 5% DIF at the 
minimum dose and infusion rate practicable, and at less than 0.06 mL per kg per minute (3 mg per kg per min). (see Boxed 
Warn
ing, Warning and Precautions [5.2, 5.4], and Dosage and Administration [2.3])
10   OVERDOSAGE
Overdose may lead to 
fluid overload and hyperviscosity. Patients at particular risk of complications of fluid overload and 
hyperviscosity include elderly patients and patients with cardiac or renal impairment.
11   DESCRIPTION
Flebogamma 5% DIF is a ready to use, sterile, clear or slightly opalescent and colorless to pale yellow, liquid preparation 
of purified immunoglobulin (IgG) obtained from human plasma pools. The purification process includes cold ethanol 
fractionation, polyethylene glycol precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], ion exchange chromatography, low pH treatment, pasteurization, solvent 
detergent treatment, and Planova nanofiltration using 20 nanometer (nm) filters.
Flebogamma 5% DIF is a purified (at least 97% IgG), unmodified, human IgG. The distribution of the four IgG subclasses 
is approximately 66.6% IgG1, 28.5% IgG2, 2.7% IgG3, and 2.2% IgG4. Flebogamma 5% DIF contains trace amounts of IgA 
(typi[INVESTIGATOR_15120] 50 µg/mL) and trace amounts of sodium and IgM. 
Flebogamma 5% DIF contains 5 g human normal immunoglobulin and 5 g D-sorbitol (as stabilizer) in 100 mL of water for 
injection, and ) 3 mg/mL polyethylene glycol. There is no preservative in the formulation. The pH of the solution ranges from 
5 to 6 and the osmolality from 240 to 370 mOsm/kg, which is within the normal physiological range.
Screening against potentially infectious agents begins with the donor selection process and continues throughout plasma 
collections and plasma preparation. Each individual plasma donation used in the manufacture of Flebogamma 5% DIF 
is collected only at FDA-approved blood establishments and is tested by [CONTACT_8415]-licensed serological test for hepatitis B 
virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg), and for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/HIV-2) and hepatitis C 
virus (HCV) in accordance with U.S. regulatory requirements. As an additional safety measure, mini-pools of plasma are 
tested for the presence of HBV, HIV-1 and HCV by [CONTACT_8415]-licensed nucleic acid testing (NAT) and found to be negative. In 
addition, plasma is tested by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]-process NAT for hepatitis A virus (HAV) and parvovirus B19 (B19) on mini-pools and the 
viral load limit for B19 in the manufacturing pool is set not to exceed 104 IU/mL. NAT for the presence of HCV and HIV in 
the manufacturing plasma pool is also performed and found to be negative.To further improve the margin of safety, three dedicated, independent virus inactivation/removal steps have been 
integrated into the manufacturing and formulation processes, namely pasteurization at [ADDRESS_420405] been used to validate the capability of the manufacturing process to inactivate and 
remove viruses. T o 
establish the minimum applicable virus clearance capacity of the manufacturing process, these virus 
clearance studies were performed on seven steps of the production process (pasteurization, solvent-detergent treatment, 
nanofiltration, Fraction I precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], Fraction II+III precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], 4% PEG precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], and pH treatment for 4 hours 
at 37 ºC). 
The viral reduction data (in log10) from these experiments are summarized in Table 2.

Additionally, the manufacturing process was investigated for its capacity to decrease infectivity of an experimental agent 
of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), considered as a model for the vCJD and CJD agents. Several individual 
production steps in the Flebogamma 5% DIF manufacturing process have been shown to decrease TSE infectivity of an 
experimental model agent. TSE reduction steps include 4% polyethylene glycol precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332] [at least 6.19 log10] and Planova 
nanofiltration using a 20 nanometer filter [at least 5.45 log10]. These studies provide reasonable assurance that low levels 
of CJD/vCJD agent infectivity, if present in the starting material, would be removed.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
Flebogamma 5% DIF, immune globulin intravenous (human), is a replacement therapy for PI. It supplies a broad spectrum 
of opsonizing and neutralizing IgG antibodies against a wide variety of bacterial and viral agents. Flebogamma 5% DIF 
also contains a spectrum of antibodies capable of reacting with cells such as erythrocytes. The role of these antibodies 
and the mechanisms of action of IgG in Flebogamma 5% DIF have not been fully elucidated.
12.3 Pharmacokinetics 
In the clinical study assessing safety and efficacy in PI, Flebogamma 5% DIF was administered as an IV infusion 
(300-600 mg per kg) to subjects every 3 (n = 8) or 4 (n = 12) weeks for 12 months. The pharmacokinetics of total IgG 
was determined after the 7th infusion for the 3-week dosing interval and after the 5th infusion for the 4-week dosing 
interval (Table 3).

13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology
Acute toxicity studies were performed in mice and rats at doses up to 2.[ADDRESS_420409] dose, approximately 8 times the maximum infusion rate recommended for 
humans, showed a transient “reddish urine” sign which was not confirmed as a relevant toxicity-causing phenomenon 
after renal macroscopic and microscopic analysis. This phenomenon was ascribed to hemolysis when serum was 
analyzed, suggesting a possible relation to cross reactivity of rodent red cells with human antibodies. No “reddish urine” 
was detected in any mouse, a much smaller animal where the rate of infusion was comparatively much higher than in 
rats. The macroscopic inspection of all treated mice did not show any renal alteration.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
A multicenter, open-label, historically controlled study was conducted in the [LOCATION_002] to assess the efficacy, safety, 
and pharmacokinetics of Flebogamma 5% DIF in adult and pediatric subjects with PI. A total of 46 subjects aged 
15-75 years (63% male, 37% female) were enrolled and treated with Flebogamma 5% DIF at a dose of 300-600 mg per 
kg per infusion every 3-4 weeks for 12 months.
3048714 Instituto Grifols, S.A. Can Guasc, 2 - Parets del Vallès [ZIP_CODE] Barcelona - SPAINSince the subjects in the clinical study were assigned to two different treatment intervals (3-week vs. 4-week infusion 
schedules), the dosage had to be adjusted to ensure that the subjects received approximately the same dosage on an 
annualized basis. Therefore, subjects in the 3-week schedule received 75% of the monthly (4-week) dosage per infusion. 
This resulted in a mean annualized dosage of 451 mg per kg per month for subjects in the 3-week schedule (n=13, range 
288-588 mg per kg per month) and 448 mg per kg per month for subjects in the 4-week schedule (n=33, range 298-591 mg 
per kg per month).
During the study period, the annual rate of acute serious bacterial infection, defined as bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia 
or sepsis, osteomyelitis/septic arthritis, visceral abscess, and bacterial meningitis per subject per year, was 0.021 (with 
an upper 1-sided 98% confidence interval of 0.112). One subject had one epi[INVESTIGATOR_339768] (Table 4).

physicians or emergency rooms, other infections documented by [CONTACT_339843], and days on 
therapeutic and prophylactic oral/parenteral antibiotic use were also evaluated. These variables were annualized by [CONTACT_339844]-years exposure data of those subjects experiencing the events, but not the entire study cohort. With regard to 
the number of other validated infections, the mean rate was less than [ADDRESS_420410] per year (this calculation used all 
subjects, including those who had no infections). (Table 5)

is not counted in the denominator. All other endpoints are derived similarly.
A multicenter, open-label, historically controlled study was conducted in the [LOCATION_002] to assess the efficacy of 
Flebogamma 5% DIF in pediatric subjects with PI. A total of 24 subjects aged 2-16 years (79% male, 21% female) 
were enrolled and treated with Flebogamma 5% DIF at a dose of 262-625 mg per kg per infusion every 3-4 weeks for 
12 months.
The annual rate of acute serious bacterial infections, defined as bacterial pneumonia, bacteremia or sepsis,

Evaluation of the Autopheresis-C Plasma Exchange Procedure within a Clinical Trial 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL, . 
 Page 2 of 15   Protocol Number 931-PRO-010255 [7.0]  1. Purpose 
This protocol defines system evaluation for the Autopheresis-C Plasma Exchange Protocol, running complete 
procedures as part of a clinical trial conducted by [CONTACT_339848].  The tests defined herein are intended to satisfy system 
performance requirements that cannot be fully tested on bagged blood procedures.  Additionally, this document will 
provide the data sheet to be used during the procedures outlined herein. 
The following are the purposes for this protocol: 
xTo observe typi[INVESTIGATOR_339773] a mixture of blood and replacement fluid in Alzheimer’s patients, 
xTo compare replacement fluid volume delivered to the programmed volume to show that the delivered volume of 
replacement fluid is within +/-10% of the programmed target volume for 90% of completed procedures, and 
xTo provide a method for Grifols SA to communicate this data to Fenwal, Inc. 
 
The results of execution of this protocol are intended to satisfy, in part, 931-PLN-010004.  
 
2. Background 
The AUTOPHERESIS-C® (Auto-C™) system (Fenwal, Inc.) is an automated plasma collection system that has been 
in use in the [LOCATION_002] since its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in March, 1986.  It was 
classified at that time as a Class III PMA device (BP850001).  In February 2003, automated blood cell separator 
devices operating by [CONTACT_339849], 
including the Autopheresis-C, were re-classified by [CONTACT_339850].  This modified their regulatory 
review pathway from PMA (pre-market approval) to 510(k) (pre-market notification).   
The Grifols SA company is a Spanish holding company that performs research, development, manufacturing and 
marketing of plasma derivatives, IV therapy, enteral nutrition, diagnostic systems and medical materials.  It is 
currently in Phase II clinical trials using albumin as a plasma replacement fluid for the treatment of Alzheimer’s 
disease.  Grifols has requested that Fenwal design and develop a plasma exchange procedure and disposable set for 
the Auto-C plasmapheresis platform that could use albumin replacement with IVIG for treatment of patients with 
Alzheimer’s for use in their clinical trials. 
The testing described in this document will utilize Autopheresis-C instruments, investigational human-use software, 
along with investigational disposables to perform procedures on Alzheimer’s patients.  Testing is conducted under 
the clinical investigation conducted by [CONTACT_339848]. 
Features of the Autopheresis-C Plasma Exchange Protocol investigational human use software include: 
xOperator selection of a replacement fluid target of 160, 190, or 200 mL to correspond with a plasma collection 
volume of 690, 825, and 880 mL of collected plasma, respectively.  An editable option is also available. 
xReturn of the programmed volume of replacement fluid after collection of the target plasma volume via a series 
of phases in which patient blood is mixed with replacement fluid and then the mixture is returned to the patient. 
The purpose of this protocol is to investigate the use of the Autopheresis-C Plasma Exchange Protocol to return a 
20% human serum albumin (HSA) solution as the replacement fluid.  The disposable sets for use during this study 
are investigational (Fenwal Product Code FTX-3900); they include a fistula needle set attached at a luer, an attached 
1000 mL plasma collection container, a spi[INVESTIGATOR_339774], and a luer for connection 
to a transfer set supplied by [CONTACT_339851].

6.3.2. Sample Size 
This study will utilize a minimum sample size of [ADDRESS_420415]-procedure weight data.  This sample size, with zero failures, will provide 95% confidence that the 
delivered volume of replacement fluid is within ± 10% of programmed volume 90% of the time.  If fewer than 
29 samples are available, the study lacks the statistical power required to demonstrate that the acceptance 
criterion is met. 
6.3.3. Acceptance Criteria 
The acceptance criterion for this portion of G rifols’ clinical trial is that the delivered volume of replacement 
fluid (shown as Replacement Fluid Volume in the Equations section) is within +/-10% of the programmed 
target volume 90% of the time. 
 
7. Post Study Disposition 
7.1. Disposition of Samples 
Upon completion of a procedure, the disposable set and replacement fluid should be discarded.  Collected plasma 
may be retained for sampling and testing.  When testing of the plasma is complete, the plasma should also be 
discarded.  All biological material must be discarded as biohazardous waste. 
7.2. Original Data 
Original data will be recorded during the execution of the protocol on worksheets provided in Appendix B and other 
data forms, as appropriate.  This protocol, all original data, the final report, and all amendments will be archived in 
the appropriate Fenwal, Inc. archives. 
7.3. Hardware and Software 
The instruments will be retained by [CONTACT_339853], but the experimental software must be returned

CONFIDENTIAL 
 considers this protocol to be confidential and not subject to disclosure without the express written consent of . 
 Page 2 of 1 3 Protocol Number 938-PRO-039808  [A]1. Purpose  
This protocol defines system evaluation for the Aurora Plasma Exchange Procedure, and applies to completed 
proc
edures performed as part of the AMBAR clinical trial conducted by [CONTACT_339855] S.A.  The intent of this protocol is 
to outline how data and information will be obtained during the clinical trial to ensure that relevant systems level 
requirements are satisfied.   Additionally, this document will provide the data sheet to be completed for all the 
procedures performed using the Aurora Plasma Exchange System during the clinical trial.  
The following are the primary purposes for this protocol: 
•To document typi[INVESTIGATOR_339776]’s patients, 
•To compare replacement fluid volume delivered to the programmed volume to confirm the accuracy of volume 
delivery.  Specifically, the following requirements from 938-REQ-032960: 
oSYRS-567: Upon completion of a successful procedure, the system shall have infused to the 
patient at an actual replacement fluid (i.e. 20% albumin solution) infusion volume that is within 
+/- 15% of the Target RF Infusion Volume. 
oSYRS-1142: If selected protocol is REPLACEMENT_FLUID, the displayed replacement fluid 
(i.e. 20% albumin solution) volume infused to the patient shall be within +/- 15% of the actual 
volume of replacement fluid infused. 
oSYRS-336: If the selected protocol is a REPLACEMENT_FLUID procedure, the system shall 
display, via the operator visual/input interface, the infused volume of replacement fluid (i.e. 20% 
albumin solution) that is within +/- 15% of the Target RF Infusion Volume upon completion of a 
successful procedure. 
•To document any issues/observations related to Y-Junction Site (aka Injection-Y Site) when performing offline 
Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion 
•To document specific alerts/alarms/issues observed during execution of the Aurora Plasma Exchange Procedure 
•To provide a method for Grifols, S.A. to communicate this information/data to Fresenius Kabi [LOCATION_003], LLC 
2. Background 
The Aurora Plasmapheresis System (Fresenius Kabi [LOCATION_003], LLC) is an automated plasma collection system based on 
the A
utopheresis-C® system (Auto-C).  Aurora uses the same separation technology and many of the same 
comp o
nents of the Auto-C but also incorporates a touch screen and GUI interface, and updates to replace obsolete 
components.  The Aurora Plasmapheresis System was cleared under 510(k) BK110072, as a design update to the 
pre-ex
isting Auto-C System. The Aurora Plasmapheresis System became the foundation for the development of the 
Aurora Plasma Exchange System.
Grifols, S.A. is a Spanish holding company that performs research, development, manufacturing and marketing of 
plasma derivatives, IV therapy, enteral nutrition, diagnostic systems and medical materials.  Grifols has requested 
that Fresenius Kabi [LOCATION_003], LLC design and develop a plasma exchange procedure and disposable set for the Aurora 
platform to facilitate direct infusion of albumin as a replacement fluid, as well as to provide for infusion of IVIG 
through the venipuncture site when performing non-albumin protocols (accomplished by [CONTACT_1541] a disposable set 
interface for connection to an external infusion pump) for treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s for use in their 
clinical trial. 
The procedure described in this document will utilize Aurora instruments, investigational human-use software, along 
with investigational disposables to perform procedures on Alzheimer’s patients.  This protocol is to be conducted 
under the clinical trial investigation conducted by [CONTACT_339855], S.A. 
Features of the investigational Aurora Plasma Exchange System with investigational human use software include: 
•Configurable target replacement fluid infusion volume with presets of  half doses of 80, 95, 100, and full doses 
of 160, 190, or 200 mL to correspond with a plasma collection volume of 690, 825, and 880 mL, respectively. 
An editable option is also available. 
•Infusion of programmed volume of replacement fluid via direct infusion of replacement fluid at programmable 
target infusion rates from 5 to 20 mL/min after collection of the target plasma volume.

6.1. Acce ptance Criteria 
The acceptance criterion for this portion of Grifols’ cli nical trial is confirmation of the following system-level 
requirements:   
•SYRS-567: Upon completion of a successful procedure, the system shall have infused to the patient at an 
actual replacement fluid (i.e. 20% albumin solution) infusion volume that is within +/- 15% of the Target 
RF Infusion Volume. 
•SYRS-1142: If selected protocol is REPLACEMENT_FLUID, the displayed replacement fluid (i.e. 20% 
albumin solution) volume infused to the patient shall be within +/- 15% of the actual volume of 
replacement fluid infused. 
•SYRS-336: If the selected protocol is a REPLACEMENT_FLUID procedure, the system shall display, via 
the operator visual/input interface, the infused volume of replacement fluid (i.e. 20% albumin solution) that 
is within +/- 15% of the Target RF Infusion Volume upon completion of a successful procedure. 
Any sample size calculation/statistical analyses used to analyze the data will be included in the final report. 
Note that only completed procedures will be included in the data analysis. 
Instructions for calculating the residual albumin volume in the disposable set following a completed procedure is 
outlined in Attachment A, Calculating W RESIDUAL .  The remaining equations for determining total volume of albumin 
infus
ed are included in Section 7.2.1. 
7. Post Study Disposition 
7.1. Disposition of Samples 
Upon 
completion of a procedure, the disposable set and th e 20% Albutein container should be discarded.  Collected 
plasma may be retained for sampling and testing, but eventually when testing of the plasma is complete, the plasma 
should also be discarded.  All biological materials must be discarded as biohazardous waste. 
7.2. Original Data 
Original data will be recorded during the execution of t h e protocol on worksheets provided in Appendix B, 
Appendix E, and other data forms, as appropriate.  For every procedure, Appendix B must be filled out.  Appendix E 
shall be filled out when the Aurora system does not perform as expected.  This protocol, all original data, the final 
report, and all amendments will be archived in the appropriate Fresenius Kabi archives.  The Aurora Plasma 
Exchange Procedure Data Record (Appendix B) and the Product Performance Report (Appendix E) should be sent 
by [CONTACT_339856] (UBS) at [EMAIL_6576].  UBS will forward the 
appendices and relevant adverse event data to Fresenius Kabi Quality at [EMAIL_6577].  If 
further procedural data are required for analysis, an Authorized Service Personnel may manually retrieve the 
instrument data at the clinical site (see page 1-3 of the Operator’s Manual for description of an Authorized Service 
Personnel). 
7.2.1. Calculating Volume of Total Infused Albumin to the Patient 
The following sequences of equations outline the method for calculating the volume of infused albumin (V INFUSED ) 
in an
 Albumin Protocol. 
To calculate the volume, various weight measurements of the disposable set and Albutein containers are taken at 
different points in the procedure.  These measurements allows for derivation of the weight of residual albumin inside 
the disposable set after a completed procedure, and the weight of total albumin infused following completion of the 
procedure.  The weights are converted to a volume using the known density of albumin (1.06 g/mL).   
The variables/parameters of interest, necessary for this calculation, are outlined below: 
•WTOTAL  = weight of total albumin used for a procedure 
•WPRE = weight of Albutein bottles before procedure 
•WPOST = weight of Albutein bottles after procedure

 Page 6 of 1 3 Protocol Number 938-PRO-039808  [A]•WINFUSED  = weight of albumin infused to the patient 
•WSET, ALBUMIN RESIDUAL = weight of residual albumin in the disposable set 
•WCAP = weight of protective cap of the albumin container 
•VINFUSED  = volume of total albumin used for a procedure 
WTOTAL can be calculated by [CONTACT_339857] W PRE and W POST: 
1) W TOTAL = W PR E - W POST - W CAP
WTOTAL can also be expressed in terms of W INFUSED and W SET, ALBUMIN RESIDUAL . 
2) W TOT
AL = W INFUSED + W SET, ALBUMIN RESIDUAL
Combining 1) and 2) together, the following equation can be derived: 
3) W PRE
 - W POST – W CAP = W INFUSED + W SET, ALBUMIN RESIDUAL
which can then be rearranged to the equation for calculating W INFUSED 
4) W INFUSED = W PRE – W POST – W CAP - W SET, ALBUMIN RESIDUAL
WPRE and W POST are directly measured by [CONTACT_339858], and the values recorded as 
Albut
ein® container weight (Pre-Procedure) and Albutein® container weight (Post-Procedure), respectively, in 
Appen
dix B.  Steps for estimating W SET, ALBUMIN RESIDUAL  is provided in Attachment A, Calculating W SET, ALBUMIN 
RESID
UAL.   
Once 
WINFUSED (g) is calculated, the calculated weight can be divided by [CONTACT_339859] (1.06 g/mL) to 
conve
rt the weight into a volume (i.e. V INFUSED ). 
VINFUSED (mL) = (W INFUSED ) ÷ (1.06 g/mL) 
7.3. H
ardware and Software 
The instruments and the investigational software will be retained by [CONTACT_339860]/investigation only and not for commercial use.  Disposition of 
clinical inventory, including the clinical software, will be documented by [CONTACT_339861](s).

Page 1 of 2 General Guidelines: 
• The Subject No . (Which includes the site and subject number) must be completed on both pages of the 
form.   
• The SAE report must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_737].  However, if for some reason the 
investigator is not available to sign the report, DO NOT hold up sending in the report.  The report must be 
completed and sent to Grifols within [ADDRESS_420422] send in a signed copy of the original that was previously sent to Grifols and annotate 
next to the checked “Initial” or “Follow-up” box “signature” to indicate that the only thing changed was an 
added signature. 
• Send the completed Serious Adverse Event Report via E-mail to .  
Report Status (Initial or Follow-up):   
Check on the form header whether the report is an initial or a follow-up:

- Follow-up Report – Must be submitted when new information becomes available or previously reported 
information has changed.  
You can use a copy of the initial report and make the applicable corrections/updates or use a blank form. In 
the second case, DO NOT rewrite all the information from the initial report; provide only new information. 
A follow-up Report must  always have identifying information (Subject No.) completed on each page, event 
name (7), event onset date (11), Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_3670] (43 & 44).

09/09/2021  OBJECTIVE  
This study takes a population -based approach which aims to increase uptake of COVID -19 testing 
within a highly segregated and underserved African American ( AA) community in Chicago. The 
proposed project utilizes the Alive Church Network (ACN) infrastructure to create a network of 
church -based testing sites in our target area that will provide COVID -[ADDRESS_1208840] result.  
 
BACKGROUND/RATIONALE  
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_866537] 2019 (COVID -19) has caused an unprecedented public 
health crisis in the [LOCATION_002]. African Americans (AA) have been disproportionately impacted, as 
systemic inequities have contributed to increased exposure and  vulnerability to COVID -19. Evidence 
suggests that AAs are delaying testing and care for COVID -19, which increases risk of transmission 
and poor outcomes. In Chicago, segregated AA neighborhoods have experienced some of the 
highest COVID -19 mortality rates  in the city, yet large portions of these neighborhoods remain testing 
deserts. Providing trusted, accessible, community -based testing in underserved AA communities is 
critical to ensuring that AAs receive an early diagnosis, thereby [CONTACT_866539] f urther 
transmission and improving clinical outcomes. This study leverages the Alive Church Network (ACN), 
a long -standing, community -driven coalition of African American pastors and public health 
researchers that was developed as a sustainable infrastructu re to address health inequities in chronic 
disease in segregated AA neighborhoods in Chicago. The ACN COVID -[ADDRESS_1208841] COVID -19 testing sites in AA churches on the South Side of Chicago.  
 
TESTING INTERVENTION  
 
Study Subjects/Method  
 
Recruitment  
Recruitment efforts will be guided by a Pastor Advisory Board (PAB), which will recommend 
strategies for recruiting and engaging members of their churches and the surrounding communities. 
09/09/2021  The Pastors will distribute flyers to t heir church members and potentially use a multi -pronged 
approach to publicize their Coalition. The communication strategy may include: news releases in 
community newspapers, local media outlets (radio, TV and editorial) and social m edia on the church’s 
platforms.  
 
Study Inclusion Criteria  
All individuals who request a COVID -[ADDRESS_1208842] (either in person or on the phone) we tell 
them basic details about the study and request consent to put their information into Epic. Participants 
have the option of  doing the Covid -[ADDRESS_1208843] only, 
doing the resource survey only (if they are not eligible for the Covid -[ADDRESS_1208844]), or doing nothing at all 
and not registering. (see Registration Information sheet in portal sect ion 5.5).  
 
If a parent wants a child to be tested we will read the section of the Registration I nformation Sheet 
about children and ask for consent for the child. Children between age [ADDRESS_1208845]. Research staff will document participants’ 
consent and children’s assent on a separate document that will be maintained separately from the 
surve y responses. If the participant chooses not to consent they will be provided other locations 
where they can be tested.  
 
Participants who complete the Resource survey will be given a longer information sheet describing 
the test and the survey. They are aske d to consent at this point for the test and survey. (see Survey 
information sheet in portal section 5.5.)  
 
Participants who complete the test only and not the resource survey will be given a separate 
information sheet describing only the test.  (see Test o nly Information sheet in portal section 5.5.)  
 
If the participant chooses not to consent they will be provided other locations where they can be 
tested.  
 
For youth testing, a written registration form and a written consent form  will be given to  parents or 
legal guardians to provide general consent to regular COVID -[ADDRESS_1208846]. The survey will take 
approximately 15 minutes. If participants enroll over the phone, they will be sent an email with a  link 
09/09/2021  to the questionnaire in SNAP (HIPPAA compliant software) . If the participant enrolls on site, they will 
complete a paper survey  or complete the survey on a tablet.   
 
If the participant has already been tested with the ACN, they will not complete the survey if they have 
already completed it.   
 
If a social need is identified on the study questionnaire, which includes screening for social 
determinants of health, study staff will phone participants and use NOWPOW database to connect 
them to resources to address their needs. If the participant has two or more social needs, or housing 
needs beyond rental assistance they will be referred to a social worker or senior community health 
worker. If someone needs help finding a PCP or health insurance they are referred to a navigator with 
that type of exper tise. 
 
No participant will be identified individually. Rather, all data will be reported in aggregate and 
confidentiality will be protected. All participant information will be maintained and kept confidential as 
required by [CONTACT_2371].  
 
 
TESTING PROTOCOL  
 
Once t he participant is consented  and completes the survey , study staff will register participants in 
Rush’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System, Epic, if they are not already registered. Study staff 
will help participants enroll in the Rush patient portal, M yChart, if they are not already enrolled. Then 
participants will receive the COVID -[ADDRESS_1208847].  
 
COVID -19 testing  
For scheduled church testing and church -based event testing , security staff of churches, testing site 
staff and volunteers will assure that visitors to the testing site wear masks and follow social distancing 
guidelines.  Testing staff include a Community Health RN , two Community Health Workers  and a 
research assistant . The RN will oversee clinical operation s at the sites. The Community Health 
Workers (CHWs) will assist the RNs at the sites , including registering participants, consenting, data 
collection, and distributing educational materials.  
 
Prior to the testing event, labels for specimens for participants who preregistered will be printed at 
Rush by [CONTACT_3462] . If a person does not preregister , they will be enrolled on site by [CONTACT_3449].  
Samples taken from participants who were enrolled onsite will be given  a handwritten label. All staff 
doing on -site SARS -CoV-[ADDRESS_1208848] will be performed using a nasal swab . The nasal swab 
will be inserted shallowly into t he participant’s nose (less than one inch into the nostril). The swab will 
be broken off into a designated test tube. The tube will be placed into a specimen bag along with a 
label. Some children, depending on their age, will be allowed to self -collect the ir COVID -19 nasal 
swab depending on the manufacturer’s instructions. The parent or legal guardian will be allowed to 
09/09/2021  authorize another guardian (≥ 18 years of age) to assist their child with collecting the self -collected 
nasal swab on the consent form. A R ush staff member may also assist the child with collection of the 
self-collected swab.  
 
All specimens will be stored in a cooler until they  are transported the Rush University Medical Center 
Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, which is accredited by [CONTACT_84905] (CL IA Certificate Number 14D0696069) 
and by [CONTACT_9891] (CAP) (CAP Accreditation Number 1872203). 
Specimens will be transported to the lab daily.  
 
Communication of Results and Follow -up 
Test results will be entered into Epic. If a participant is enrolled in MyChart they will receive an email 
informing them that their results are available. For participants with negative results, they will receive 
their results via MyChart  and will receive  an email or text informing them that their results are 
available . If the participant does not have access to MyChart  they will be informed at the time of 
testing that if  they have not received a phone call within 3 days indicating that their result is pos itive 
(see communication procedure for positive participants below) then their result is negative. They will 
be provided with the toll free phone number for Rush Access to call for their results . 
 
In the case of a positive result, participants will receive  a phone call from a nurse or community health 
worker within [ADDRESS_1208849](s). Both the at home test box and tracking sheet will contain an identical label 
showing the individual test ID numbers for each test distributed to the participant for tracking 
purposes. The individual distributing the tests will be provided w ith a test for personal use  as well as 
tests to distribute to others in their social netwo rk. The registration and consent process for at home 
testing will be completed electronically using QR code technology. A QR code will be affixed to each 
at home test box and will provide access to the study information sheet using the participants smart 
phone. Participants will provide electronic consent before performing the test.  
 
Participants using the at home tests will also complete a short survey electronica lly with their smart 
phone using the QR code. The brief survey will assess basic demographic information , history of 
Covid -19, and vaccination status  and is to be completed before performing the test.  
 
The individuals distribu ting the at home tests  to thei r social network will receive  a $[ADDRESS_1208850] used and/or 
09/09/[ADDRESS_1208851] will be performed by [CONTACT_4859] a nasal swab into the no stril until a cap 
containing the swab touches the nose; rubbing the swab tip around the nose cavity 3 times; removing 
the swab and repeating in the other nostril. The nasal swab, a dropper, processing fluid, and a blue 
tooth connected analyzer are provided  with the testing kit to analyze the sample for Covid -19.

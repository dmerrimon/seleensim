Study Title: Developi[INVESTIGATOR_253212]: A 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_253214], one of the leading causes of death among adolescents,1 has tragically increased in recent 
years2 and is a national priority.3 However, there is a paucity of effective interventions for adolescent suicidal 
behavior.4-6 In particular, there is a critical need for developi[INVESTIGATOR_253215], many of whom are at a high risk for repeated suicide attempts, persisting suicidal ideation, emergency department (ED) visits, and rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_602].
7-[ADDRESS_308024], an adaptive intervention (AI) is a treatment design 
that individualizes the type, intensity, and timing of treatment.17-20 However, there currently are no AIs for youth 
suicide prevention. Moreover, despi[INVESTIGATOR_253216]’ preference for mobile communication,21,[ADDRESS_308025] a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) pi[INVESTIGATOR_253217] a te chnology-augmented AI for suicidal youth. The AI will 
focus on strengthening adolescents’ motivation and self-effi cacy to use their safety plans and adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_253218]-discharge. The proposed intervention (MI-SafeCope) will include three components: (1) a Motivational 
Interview (MI)-enhanced safety plan delivered during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], which incorporates an individual and a family meeting; (2) post-discharge MI-enhanced booster calls; and (3) personalized daily text messages delivered to adolescents for one month after discharge. Specific aims are:  
Aim 1.  To finalize intervention components, study implementation protocol, and fidelity assessment tools in 
preparation for the pi[INVESTIGATOR_253219]. Specifically, we will develop and refine the text message boosters. The message content will be iteratively refined based on consultation with experts and feedback from adolescent. 
 
Aim 2.  To conduct the pi[INVESTIGATOR_253220], including the sequencing of intervent ion components. Participants will be randomized to MI-
enhanced safety plan with and without text boosters (Phase 1 intervention) and then re-randomized to an 
added telephone booster call or no call (Phase 2 intervention). We will:  
 
2a) Evaluate feasibility of study procedures and impl ementation of intervention components and sequencing;  
 
2b) Assess intervention acceptability (i..e. participant satisfaction; rates of attrition and adherence);  
 2c) Define indicators of response to Phase 1 intervention by [CONTACT_253246]. 
 2d) Conduct exploratory analyses of intervention effect s on proximal /mechanisms (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_007], safety plan 
use, self-efficacy) and distal (suicidal ideation/behavior) outcomes.   
INTERVENTION COMPONENTS 
MI-Enhanced Safety Plan Developed at Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (all teens receive this component).   
Individual Meeting: An individualized safety plan, incorporating common elements of safety planning,
23 27 will be 
developed with the teen to use during a suicidal crisis . This “best practices” approach for treating suicidal 
individuals23-41 is augmented with MI28 as a core strategy to explicitly elicit adolescents’ motivation and 
commitment to behavior change (i.e. use safety plan; adapt ive copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]), address barriers or ambivalence, and 
strengthen self-efficacy. A 4-phase MI framework28 will be used, which includes engaging, focusing, evoking, 
and planning to guide the session.  
 3 
Family Meeting: Similarly guided by M I, the family meeting includes a focus on preparing parents, with input 
from the adolescent, for how they may support the adole scent in implementing the individualized safety plan 
after discharge and on strengthening parents’ commitment and self-efficacy to follow through with these recommendations. Parents’ roles are also crucial in maintaining adequate monitoring, securing lethal means, and providing general support to their adolescents. Involv ing parents in safety planning is thus essential. 
 
 
Post-Discharge Components (teens receive none, one, or both components; see Figure). Because 
heterogeneity in post-discharge functioning (e.g. suicidal ideation severity) and response to the  
MI-enhanced safety plan (e.g. copi[INVESTIGATOR_172510]) is expected, the safety plan may or may not need to be 
supplemented with additional follow-up components to further strengthen adolescents’ motivation and self-efficacy for healthy copi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. Because the highest risk for the relapse of suicide-related events is during the first month after discharge,
[ADDRESS_308026] critical risk period. 
 Text Message Boosters: The safety plan component may be followed with daily text message boosters for a 
month after discharge to further enhance adolescents’ self-efficacy and motivation to use adaptive copi[INVESTIGATOR_253221], which has the potential to incr ease the impact of the intervention. For example, the 
messages will be tailored to encourage use of individualized copi[INVESTIGATOR_253222]. Messages will also encourage accessing different types of support and introduce additional copi[INVESTIGATOR_125656] (e.g. copi[INVESTIGATOR_253223]) and reso urces (e.g. crisis lines, websites). The text message 
content and tone will be consistent with principles of MI (e.g. affirming statements; open-ended questions 
encouraging reflection and generating solutions; MI-consistent language to provide copi[INVESTIGATOR_253224]).   Booster Calls: The safety plan component may be followed with a booster call with the adolescent and the 
parent in week [ADDRESS_308027]-discharge needs, to further enhance adolescents’ motivation and commitment to use copi[INVESTIGATOR_4262], and to further support adolescents’ 
and parents’ self-efficacy to  manage suicidal crises.  
 
METHODS 
Eligibility and Enrollment of Participant Recruitment. Participants will include 80 adolescents (ages 13 to 
17) recruited from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry I npatient Program at the University of Michigan. Charts 
will be screened for eligibility based on either (1) past-month suicide attempt or (2) past-week suicidal ideation 
with method, intent, or plan (based on Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
29). Exclusion criteria will include 
(1) severe cognitive impairment or altered mental status (psychosis, manic state), (2) transfer to medical unit or 
residential placement, (3) no availability of a legal guardian, or (4) no cell phone with text messaging capability. Adolescents and parents will be approached during admission or visiting hours. Those who provide consent/assent will participate in Aim 1(text component development) or Aim 2 (pi[INVESTIGATOR_253225]).  
 
Aim 2 activities are described below.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_253226] . Eighty adolescents (ages 13-17) meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and their parents will 
participate in the SMART pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]. All participants who complete the baseline assessment will receive the in-
person intervention components (individua and family m eeting) on the inpatient unit and will subsequently be 
randomized as outlined below. 
The in-person MI-SafeCope intervention will be deliver ed during the inpatient stay and the adolescent’s 
condition (stabilization; e.g. likely not on the first day of being admitted) will be considered for the timing of intervention delivery. The meeting with the adolescent will take approximately 60 minutes, the family meeting 
approximately 30 minutes. The in-person intervention component will be guided by [CONTACT_253247][INVESTIGATOR_253227]-efficacy and motivation to use after discharge (a safety plan template will be used in the session) and by [CONTACT_253248]’s parent/guardian to supporting the adolescent’s copi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (Parent Crisis Card will be used in the session). Sessions will be tape recorded for clinician supervision purposes, and participants will be asked to provide a brief feedback survey.  
As shown in the Figure, adolescents will be randomized twice. The first randomization will be to either MI-
enhanced safety plan at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253228] (the in-per son intervention component described above) or MI-
enhanced safety plan at hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253229] (Phase 
 4+ 1). At the end of week 2, all participants will be re-randomized to two additional weeks of either: (a) 
continuation of Phase 1 intervention or (b) continuation of Phase 1 intervention with the addition of the MI-
enhanced booster call in week 3 (Phase 2) . Thus, participants will receive one of four treatment sequences (A-
D; see Figure).  
For those randomized to receive the MI-enhanced booster call, the study therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253230]. The booster phone call with adolescent and with parent, each conducted separately, will take approx imately 15 minutes. In the even that a teen is rehospi[INVESTIGATOR_253231], we will try to complete the follow-up call during the teen’s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_253232] 
(if appropriate, e.g. the teen has been stabilized) or approximately within one or two weeks following the new 
discharge. For participants randomized to receive text boosters, messages will be sent once a day (“pushes”) for a total of [ADDRESS_308028] (“pulls”). Thus, teens will receive two supportive text messages per day. The “bank” of these messages is based on feedback from teens obtained in Aim 1. 
Participants will receive the messages at a time that is identified by [CONTACT_4317]. Messages will be sent to 
participants’ phone using an automated and secure text message delivery system.

Primary Outcome Measures: 
1. Percentage of eligible participants recruited will be used to assess feasibility and acceptability.  
2. Percentage of randomized participants and who complete intervention components will be used to 
assess feasibility and acceptability.  
3. Percentage of participants who complete study assessments will be used to assess feasibility and 
acceptability.  
4. Satisfaction ratings will be used to assess acceptability.  
 All other measures are considered exploratory. 
 
Assessments:  
 
a. Baseline Assessments (adolescents and guardians/parents) 
Participants will be asked to complete baseline measures  using Qualtrics on Tablet computers. Participants 
will be provided the option of filling out the baseline measur es using a paper and pencil format if they prefer or 
if any technological difficulties are encountered that would prevent the completion of the surveys on a Tablet 
computer. In addition, parents who are not able to fill out baseline surveys in person, will have the option to 
complete these by [CONTACT_253249] (Qualtrics) surv ey link sent to their email or by [CONTACT_20815]. 
Participating adolescents and parents will be compensated $20 and $10, respectively, for completing the baseline assessment.

 5These assessments will be completed over the phone,  however, participants will have the option of 
completing all or some of these follow-up measures on line; they may also have the option to receive these 
measures online but provide their answers to a research staff member over the phone to facilitate the phone 
assessment. For each of the 1- and 3-month follow- up assessment, adolescents will receive $30 and parents 
will receive $[ADDRESS_308029] in person and follow-up compensation will be loaded after completing the follow-up assessments.  
 
c.  Daily Surveys) (adolescents) 
Participating adolescents will be asked to complete daily surveys for 4 weeks after discharge. Participants 
will be compensated up to $142 for completing daily su rveys ($4 x 28 days and an additional $30 if they 
complete 75% daily surveys). Online survey links will be sent via text message to participants’ phones once a 
day in the evening for a month. The Q ualtrics survey links (using the Univer sity of Michigan Qualtrics system) 
will be sent to participants by a text message. Participants will be able to complete these 2-5 minute surveys 
on their phone or by [CONTACT_253250] a computer browser (if they do not have a smartphone). Participants 
may be contact[CONTACT_253251]. We will assess suicidal ideation/behavior, copi[INVESTIGATOR_172510], self-efficacy, and other factors (affect, 
connectedness, hopelessness, etc.). Of note, the automated text message delivery system will not store identifiable information, including names, demographic info rmation, any other sensitive information, or data. 
The survey links themselves received by  [CONTACT_253252]. No identifying information will be collected via daily diaries using Qualtrics.  
 
Risk Management. 
a. Daily Diaries: 
Participant daily responses (particularly suicidal i deation questions) will be monitored very closely to 
determine if there is an increase in level of suicide risk. This will be achieved in several ways.  
 (1) An endorsement of an acute/high level of risk ( defined as an endorsement of current suicidal ideation 
together with current suicidal intent or plan OR an endorsement of a suicide attempt in the last 24 hours) on 
the daily questionnaire will result in an automated message displayed as part of the survey urging that the 
participant seeks support and providing phone numbers to the crisis line and emergency contacts. The PI, or 
the backup clinician on call, will also receive an autom ated message from Qualtrics that a participant with a 
specific ID number endorsed acute risk. To protect confidentia lity, this notification will only indicate a specific ID 
number associated with a participant endorsing this response. As the primary on-call psychologist, the PI, or backup on-call clinician, will initiate the Action Plan, which will involve calling the adolescent and parent/guardian as soon as possible on the same day. Once a participant is contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], an Action Plan will be 
filled out and recommendations will be made. If the adolescent and/or parent are not reachable after several 
tries to reach them, the PI, or backup clinician on-call, may contact [CONTACT_253253]. This will be described in the consent form and discussed with participants 
during the consent process. It is important to also not e that participant responses will be reviewed daily to 
safeguard against the unlikely possibility that acute/hi gh risk participants were missed via the automated alert 
process. 
 
(2) An endorsement of a moderate level of risk (defined as an endorsement of suicidal ideation within the 
last 24 hours but no current suicidal intent or plan) on the daily questionnaire will result in an automated 
message displayed as part of the survey urging that the participant seems support and providing phone 
numbers to the crisis line and emergency contacts.  
 b. Follow-up Assessments and Follow-up Phone Call: 
 Participants who disclose either a) current active suic idal thoughts (within the last week) or b) who disclose 
suicidal action (actual attempt, aborted, or interrupted suicide attempt) since last assessment will be asked 
follow-up questions, as per Action Plan, and appropriate recommendations – in consultation with an on-call 
clinician— will be provided. Risk management procedures will be reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with 
the protocol.  
 
 6Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253235] . Training and fidelity protocols/tools will be developed in Aim 1. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253236] a MI training workshop and will complete intervention-specific training that will be developed 
and provided by [CONTACT_978]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253237] y by [CONTACT_12550] a series of role-plays prior to 
delivering the intervention. To monitor fidelity, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253238]. Audiotapes will be reviewed by [CONTACT_978], and a randomly selected subset (25%) will be coded using the fidelity assessment tool. Regular supervision and booster trainings to reduce therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253239]. Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253240]’s risk management protocol. 
. 
 
Data Analysis . We will obtain data related to intervention feasibility and acceptability, including retention and 
adherence rates, participant satisfaction with intervention, and intervention fidelity/adherence. We will also 
explore candidate primary tailoring variables for Phase 2 re-randomization and estimate rates of respondents/non-respondents to Phase 1 intervention. Rece iver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analyses will 
be used to explore predictive validity and utility (sensitivity/specificity) of candidate primary tailoring variables collected via daily surveys within [ADDRESS_308030] dischar ge in predicting 1- and 3-month outcomes (e.g., suicidal 
ideation/behavior). Using multi-level analyses for c ontinuous (SAS PROC MIXED) and non-normally distributed 
(SAS PROC GLIMMIX) variables, explor atory analyses of the effect of the Phase 1 and 2 interventions on 
daily-level mechanisms (e.g., copi[INVESTIGATOR_172510], self-efficacy to  refrain from suicidal action, safety plan use) as 
well as the 1- and 3-month proximal (e .g., self-efficacy to cope with suicidal urges, parent self-efficacy) and 
distal (e.g., suicidal ideation/behavior) outcomes will be conducted. Using multi-level analyses, exploratory analyses of potential baseline moderators (e.g., attempt history) will be conducted to determine who might 
benefit more from Phase 1 and 2 interventions. Because pi[INVESTIGATOR_253241],
30 we will 
examine if the pattern of change is in the desired direction (e.g. increase in self-efficacy; decrease in suicidal ideation).

Title: Pragmatic Trial of an Electronic Health 
Record/Behavioral Economics Intervention 
to Reduce Pre -Operative Testing for 
Cataract  Surgery  
 
NCT Number : [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]  
Document Date : June 24, [ADDRESS_348763] ‘nudge’ alerts into the UCLA Health EHR. Each nudge will test a 
different behavioural economics framing strategy. Our second aim is to conduct a four -arm randomised 
pragmatic trial to compare the effectiveness o f the nudges to each other and to usual care. We 
hypothesise that exposure to the nudges will result in a reduction of pre -op tests ordered by [CONTACT_13922]. 
We will randomise providers who conduct pre -op visits for patients with cataract surgery to one of fo ur 
study arms: nudge 1, nudge 2, nudge 3 or no nudge (usual care) and measure the effect of the 
intervention on pre -op testing (see below).  
Trial design  
This is a pragmatic, parallel group, open -label, randomised controlled superiority trial. Groups are 
allocated 1:1 to the intervention arms (nudges) and control arm (routine care). This trial will be 
conducted between June [ADDRESS_348764] Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials statement.  In this pragmatic trial of 
a quality improvement intervention, neither patients nor physicians provide consent to participate in 
the trial. This protocol was approved by [CONTACT_4707] (IRB) of the University of 
[LOCATION_004], Los Angeles (IRB#18 –0 01 240).  
Methods  
Setting  
This study will take place at UCLA Health, a large urban academic health system located in Los  Angeles, 
[LOCATION_004] and surrounding communities. UCLA Health operates four hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285882] 
(Westwood and Santa Monica) and over [ADDRESS_348765] surgery  (3470, 
2135, 4040, 4263).  
Exclusion Criteria  
As this is a real -world pragmatic trial, all physicians who meet the criteria described above will be 
included in the study. Similarly, there are no exclusions for patients who present at a visit defined by [CONTACT_285886]. Patients with cataract surgery who do not have a pre -op evaluation with a 
UCLA physician, but have cataract surgery at UCLA, will not be included in this study.  
Study Intervention  
At UCLA Health, cataract surgery planning is initiated when a patient is evaluated by a UCLA 
ophthalmologist and deemed an appropriate candidate for the procedure. The patient is then asked to 
make an appointment for a pre -op visit with their primary care provider (PCP), cardiologist or another 
UCLA physician. The Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Jo int Commission require that 
a pre -op visit be completed within [ADDRESS_348766], Complete Blood Count (CBC), electrolytes and CXR. The ordering of these tests is left to the 
discretion of the physician completing the pre -op evaluation. The decision to order tests and procedures 
is influenced by [CONTACT_13917]’s previous experiences, preferences and in terpretation of the guidelines.  
The intervention will deploy one of the EHR nudge alerts (control, nudge 1, nudge 2 or nudge 3) such 
that each physician in the study will only get one o f the nudges (or none of them) for the duration of the 
study. These alerts will be triggered when a physician begins to order a pre -op test for patients during 
their pre -op visit. The full list of pre -op tests, informed by [CONTACT_285887],4, [ADDRESS_348767] 
nudges to highlight the following concepts7: patient safety,8 financial co sts to the patient and  9 the risk 
of psychological harm to the patient. Each of the three nudge reference guidelines from the American 
Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO)  10, [ADDRESS_348768] on  patients.  
Three Intervention Arms  
Nudge 1  will display as ‘UCLA Ophthalmologists and Anesthesiologists ADV ISE AGAINST routine pre -op 
tests, which do not increase the patient’s safety and are considered inappropriate per current evidence -
based recommendations (see UCLA Ophthalmology, UCLA Anesthesiology, ASA and AAO 
recommendations). The UCLA Pre -op Eval and Pl anning Center (PEPC) will order any necessary day of 
surgery labs ’. 12, 13  
Nudge 2 will d isplay as ‘UCLA Ophthalmologists and Anesthesiologists ADVISE AGAINST routine pre -op 
tests, which can increase the patient’s out -of-pocket costs and are considered inappropriate per current 
evidence -based recommendations (see UCLA Ophthalmology, UCLA Anest hesiology, ASA and AAO 
recommendations). The UCLA PEPC will order any necessary day of surgery labs’.  12, 13 , 14 
Nudge 3 (figure 3) will display as ‘UCLA Ophthalmologists and Anesthesiologists ADVISE AGAINST routine 
pre-operative tests, which can cause aggravation and psychological stress for the patient and are 
considered inappropriate per current evidence -based recommendations (see UCLA Ophthalmology, 
UCLA Anesthesiology, ASA, and AAO recommendations). The UCLA Pre -op Eval and Planning Center 
(PEPC) will order any necessary day of surgery labs’.  12, [ADDRESS_348769], they will need to type an explanation. This behavioural 
intervention is known as ‘accountable justification’, which has been shown effective in reducing low -
value care.15 Specifically, as part of the alerts, physicians can remove the orde r with a single click on 
‘Accept’. If they choose not to remove the order, they can click ‘Keep’ and will be required to click on 
the ‘Explain’ button and provide free text stating why they continued with placing the order after 
exposure to the nudge  
Control Arm  
Providers who are randomised to usual pre -op care will not receive an alert, or any special information 
about testing guidelines when they attempt to order a pre -op test.  All other aspects of the clinical 
encounter and documentation will be the same for both the intervention and control arms.  
Data collection methods  
All data will be collected from the UCLA Health EPIC EHR ‘CareConnect’ and from surveys  administered 
to providers. This data will be stored securely and only accessible to research personnel trained in 
confidentiality and privacy procedures. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will provide 
ongoing oversight and data audits. To compar e the cost of pre -op testing among study arms, we will use 
publicly available Medicare payment rates and UCLA Health commercial payment rates.  
Statistical Analysis Plan  
Randomisation Strategy  
The study statistician will randomise eligible physicians to one of the two study arms . The randomisati on 
will be stratified by [CONTACT_285888] -op encounters conducted in the pre -intervention period (0, 1 –2, 
3–5,>6) to ensure appropriate control of physician’s experience or preference to conducting pre -op 
testing.  
Primary and secondary outcome analysis  
We w ill measure and compare rates of testing in the 12 months before and 12 months after initiation of 
the randomisation (primary outcome) to determine whether the EHR -based intervention is successful in 
changing physician behaviour. We will also compare each of the three intervention arms and the usual 
care arm and will perform exploratory comparisons between nudge 1, nudge 2 and nudge 3 (secondary 
outcome) to determine whether certain behavioural economic framing techniques are more effective 
than others at r educing pre -op testing.  
Other secondary outcomes will include the percentage of patients who received specific categories of 
pre-op tests including labs, EKGs and CXRs, same -day surgery cancellations and physician -level 
experience measured by [CONTACT_285889]. We will also estimate co st savings associated with the intervention 
(described below). Evaluation of the primary and secondary outcomes will be performed using 
generalised linear mixed -effects models at the patient level. We will investigate the impact of all nudges 
versus contro l, which will require a threefold correction. As a secondary analysis, we will conduct 
pairwise comparisons of the nudges. Models will include fixed nudge 1, nudge [ADDRESS_348770] (postnudge intervention vs prenudge inter vention), second -order interactions 
between these effects, a fixed stratum effect (hospi[INVESTIGATOR_285883]) and random physician effects. 
Physician effects will account for clustering of patients by [CONTACT_5936]. Comparisons between changes in 
utilisation rates ac ross study arms will be estimated and tested using model contrasts. All pairwise 
comparisons of changes between study arms will be performed to identify the most effective nudge, 
and Bonferroni corrections will be applied to control the familywise type I e rror rate at 5%. Intervention 
effects will be summarised using ORs, 95% CIs and p values (with multiple comparison corrections). 
Differences between strata will be similarly summarised.  
These models will also be adjusted for patient -level covariates (age, r ace, ethnicity and Elixhauser 
comorbidities). Because serious complication rates are so low from cataract surgery (<0.1%), we will not 
have adequate power to determine whether the intervention is associated with a change in 
complication rates, but we will extract from the EHR all cardiovascular events occurring within 30 days 
of surgery and compare these in an exploratory fashion among the intervention and control groups. 
Analyses will be performed using SAS V.9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina).  
Power  
Preliminary analyses of UCLA Health data show that the ba seline rate of testing is 65%. In a prior quality 
improvement study conducted at a different health system,16 we reduced pre -op lab testing by 59% (a 
reduction from 90% to 31%). We conservatively estimate an effect half as large (30%) in each 
intervention arm.  
To calculate savings from reduced use of medical services, we will multiply the estimates of utilisation 
(ie, quantity) for each of the pre -op services measured by [CONTACT_285890] d on the coverage type for the patient (ie, Medicare and average commercial payment rates per 
service). We will then compare differences in spending overall and by [CONTACT_285891] (ie, lab testing, 
EKGs) between the control arm and each of the interventi on arms and a pooled estimate of the three -
nudge intervention arms. We will disaggregate the savings to measure the amount and proportion 
accrued by [CONTACT_73733]/payer versus the patient. An extension of this analysis will estimate how 
reducing the ut ilisation of pre -op testing affect different parties; we will disaggregate the savings 
estimates by [CONTACT_285892] (ie, capi[INVESTIGATOR_285884] -for-service(FFS)) to derive estimates of savings 
to the health systems versus the payer. Under capi[INVESTIGATOR_285885], the savings accrue to the health 
system, while under FFS payments, the savings accrue to the payer and represent revenue losses for the 
health system.  
We will extrapolate observed saving estimates to compute savings the Medicare FFS programme might 
expe ct to accrue if similar reductions in the utilisation of pre -op services for cataract surgery were 
observed in the Medicare population. To generate these savings estimates, we will compute the number 
of Medicare patients undergoing cataract surgery in a si ngle year and the fraction of patients who have 
these pre -op tests. We will then take our estimates of reduction in utilisation and apply these estimates 
to the current use of pre -op testing utilisation in the Medicare FFS programme to determine the number  
of services that would be reduced. We would then apply FFS payment rates to the number of services 
that would be reduced to estimate savings to Medicare. Finally, we will develop estimates of longer 
term savings in a year –year time range, applying a disco unt rate to costs, assuming that the observed 
reduced amount of services used remained similar after the 1 -year study period ended.

The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate  the performance of the truSculpt Radiofrequency Device 
for non-invasive  lipolysis of abdominal fat .  
2  BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 
Unwanted excess fat pockets/bulges have been among the top concerns expressed by [CONTACT_57835].  Although surgical interventions produce the most definitive results with body contouring, these invasive methods require significant recovery  time and come with inherent risks.   
 
As a non -invasive option, laser, intense pulsed light (IPL), RF, or a combination of these technologies 
have been developed to reduce cellulite and body circumference with minimal recovery time and risks 
[1]. The tigh tening effect of the thermal energy generated by [CONTACT_789803], abdomen, thigh, back and flanks [2 -14].  Although lasers and IPLs can target the deep dermal layers, the thermal effects of these 
devices are limited due to light scattering and energy absorption by [CONTACT_57837].  
 RF, which is the most studied device in the non -ablative category, uses electrical current rather than 
light energy.  Un like light energy, radio waves can penetrate deeper depending on the frequency of 
operation. RF can be used with all Fitzpatrick skin types without jeopardizing epi[INVESTIGATOR_57831] [15].

9.1 Sample Size 
The planned sample size of up to  approximately 14  subjects was determined based on clinical 
judg ement to provide sufficient information to evaluate  the performance  of RF treatment for lipolysis of 
abdominal fat . 
9.2 Analysis Sets  
The efficacy analysis set will include all enrolled subjects who complete the  RF treatment se ssion using 
the study device . 
 
The safety analysis set will include all subjects enrolled in the study who start the RF treatment session 
using the study device.  
 Missing data will not be imputed for efficacy or safety endpoints.  
9.3 Analysis of Efficacy  Endpo ints 
9.3.1 Primary Endpoint Analysis  
Formal hypothesis testing and statistical analysis are  not planned for this study. The primary efficacy 
endpoint data will be summarized descriptively  for the control and treatment areas .  
9.4 Safety Analyses  
Device -related and procedure -related adverse effects (AEs) and subjects who prematurely terminate 
from the study due to an adverse device effect, including the treatment- related pain ratings, will be 
tabulated and analyzed. For a given AE term, counting will be done by [CONTACT_1130], not by [CONTACT_15992], i.e. for a subject reporting the same AE more than once;  the event will be counted only once, at the most severe 
and longest duration.  The number and percentage of subjects experiencing each AE Term will be 
descriptive ly summarized. Subject pain ratings during treatment will also be summarized descriptively.

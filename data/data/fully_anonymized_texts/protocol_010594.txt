 1 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be 
conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (FDA 
Title 21 part 312 and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines), applicable 
governm ent regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  
1.[ADDRESS_379926] densely populated microbial habitats known on  earth .  The 
genome size of this pool of intestinal microbes is estimated to exceed the size of the 
human nuclear genome by [CONTACT_309700]1. There are far more total cells in 
the gut microbial population than human cells in our bodies --indeed, it has been stated 
that "there a re more of them in us than us"[ADDRESS_379927] bacterial species 
with single primer pairs, but diverse enough to allow  "f inger printing" of taxa to relatively 
fine taxonomic levels7.  Such studies have revealed that major bacterial phyla in the 
human gut include Bacteroidetes , Firmicutes , Proteobacteria and various minor groups . 
Other recent studies extended this analytical approach by [CONTACT_309701] 16S DNA3, 8-11.   Metagenomic 
analysis allows inferences to be made about the community taxonomy and the 
metabolic pathways in the intestinal microbiota inferred  from the genes present.  For 
example, the Gill et al. study10 disclosed that the intestinal microbiota contribute  unique 
pathways for metabolism of glycans , amino acids, xenobiotics, methanogenesis, 
vitamins, isoprenoids, and other compounds.   
When maintained in a stable manner, at an appropriately safe distance from gut 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], the microbiota provides benefits to the host, especially in terms of 
energy harvest, pathogen exclusion, and promotion of immune development. In 
contrast, disturbance of the microbiota -host relationship can drive chronic gut 
inflammation that can promote an array of chronic inflammatory diseases including 
metabolic syndrome .  While host genetics are an important determinant of the host -
microbiota relationship, the dramatic increase in incidence of numerous chronic 
inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic 
syndrome over the last [ADDRESS_379928] of these food additives are not well described, particularly

 their potential to influence microbiota composition and/or its interaction with the host.  
One particularly disconcerting class of compoun ds are synthetic dietary emulsifiers 
including polysorbate 80 (P80) and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC). These detergent -like 
compounds, which are incorporated into a variety of processed foods, are not well -
absorbed, thus allowing them to interact with the mi crobiota and gut mucosa. We have 
recently shown that, in mice, consumption of P80 and CMC, alters microbiota 
composition, have pro-inflammatory potential and promote microbiota encroachment 
into the colonic mucosa, low -grade inflammation, and metabolic syn drome ¹. However, it 
is not known whether these compounds have similar effects in humans.  Addressing this 
critically important question is the central goal of this study. Our initial focus will be on 
CMC, which, despi[INVESTIGATOR_309679], has "generally regarded as safe (GRAS)" status from the US FDA, allowing it 
to be widely and unrestrictedly used in a broad variety of processed foods.  
1.[ADDRESS_379929] -mid-20th century increased incidence of 
chronic inflammatory diseases of the intestine. Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, 
collectively referred to as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), are debilitating dise ases 
that may afflict up to 3 million Americans 12. Like many immune -mediated diseases, the 
incidence of IBD is increasing in the US and elsewhere at rates far in excess of that 
expected by [CONTACT_59566]. A milder but much more common form of gut inflammation 
referred to as "low -grade" inflammation, is defined by [CONTACT_309702] -inflammatory 
gene expression amidst a lack of histopathologically -evident inflammation 13. Such low -
grade inflammation associates with, and may promote, metabolic syndrome, which is  a 
group of interrelated metabolic disorders including obesity, insulin resistance, 
hyperglycemia, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], and h epatic steatosis 14. Humanity is facing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_309680], and its downstream consequences, including type 2 diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, and liver dysfunction that threaten to overwhelm the wor ld's 
healthcare systems and economies thus making it a top public health priority in dire need 
of investigation. Our research suggests that IBD, metabolic syndrome, and other chronic 
inflammatory diseases may share common underlying causes, including a dis turbed host -
microbiota relationship.  In accord with this notion, recent studies demonstrate that 
infections in infants increase likelihood of developi[INVESTIGATOR_309681] [ADDRESS_379930] impacted the microbiota (e.g. antibiotics, polymers such as BPA, pollutants, 
enhanced sanitation, etc.). Recent studies suggest that some commonly used dietary 
emulsifiers, which are detergent -like molecules that are incorporated into most processed 
foods to improve texture and stability, may be one specific contributor to the increased 
prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases 17, 18.  We repor ted that feeding mice CMC 
and P80 results  in a microbiota that encroaches upon the epi[INVESTIGATOR_309682] -inflammatory signaling 19. Such alterations promote

bakeries throughout the [LOCATION_002]. Thus, consumption of the study diet entails no 
greater risk than consumption of a typi[INVESTIGATOR_309683].  
Participants will undergo phlebotomy and sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. There is a 
small potential risk for complications of sigmoidoscopy, including bleeding  and 
perforation. The risks of these complications are estimated to be less than 1% for 
bleeding and less than 0.1% for perforation. Patients with contraindications to biopsy 
will be excluded. The risks of phlebotomy include bleeding, infection, phlebitis,  and 
fainting. As with all research, there is a small risk of loss of confidentiality. Participants  
may also experience some discomfort associated with eating a limited diet for 14 days.  
Participants may also feel tired and/or discomfort from staying in th e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309684] [ADDRESS_379932] benefit expected for the participants, the balance of the 
participants’ risk vs. the knowledge to be gained  is believed to be favorable.  
2 Study Objectives  
The specific aim s for our proposal are:  
 
1. Establish a tractable and physiologic means of administering and measuring 
CMC consumption and its metabolic impact in healthy volunteers.  
 
2. Examine extent to which CMC consumption impacts human gut microbiota 
composition, gene expression, and/or localization.  
 
3. Explore effects of CMC consumption on a range of inflammatory and 
metabolic parameters that characterize metabolic syndrome.

exposure in the diet on markers of metabolic syndrome including response to oral 
glucose tolerance testing and other plasma metabolite measurements.  
Healthy volunteers will be recruited for a 11-day in -patient study. All participants  
will rece ive 3  full days of freshly prepared emulsifier -free food to begin the study . This 
will be called the  “washout period”. Participants  will then be randomized into an 
“emulsifier -free” arm and a “CMC” arm.  
Both arms will continue  the same diet except that the “CMC” arm’s brownie and 
sorbet will have CMC added to achieve a level of 15 g m per person per day 
consumption , which are the levels of emulsifier consumption that can readily be 
achieved by [CONTACT_309703] a large amount of processed foods . If the average 
American eats 2kg of processed food per day containing 2% emulsifier (the limit of 
individual emulsifiers), this would amount to 40g of emulsifiers per day. Serial collection 
of fecal, blood , urine and mucosal biopsy samples will define ou r ability to reliably 
quantitate CMC consumption by [CONTACT_309704] m etabolism.  
3.[ADDRESS_379934] smoking has on the microbiome of the gut is 
unknown. Furthermore, because our h ospi[INVESTIGATOR_77690] a smoke -free environment, 
volunteers will not be able to smoke. Thus, inclusion of smokers would increase 
the risk of early withdrawal from the study.  
4. Body Mass Index (BMI) <18.5 o r >40 at screening . Volunteers with BMI below 
normal27 will be excluded to  prevent inclusion of participants  with a subclinical 
systemic disease that may influence the gut microbiome. Volunteers with severe 
obesity will be excluded as obesity may be associated with altered gut 
microbiome composition . 
5. More than two of the criteri a for metabolic syndrome:  
o A waist circumference greater than 35 inches (89 centimeters) for women 
and 40 inches (102 centimeters) for men  at screening.  
o A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or baseline HbA1c > 6.4% or a fasting 
glucose level of greater than 1 00mg/dL   
o Systolic blood pressure >130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >85 
mmHg or treated with medications for hypertension  at screening.  
o Fasting triglycerides >149 mg/dl or treated with medications for 
hypertriglyceridemia  
o Fasting HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dl  in men or <50 mg/dl in women or 
treated with medications for hypercholesterolemia  
6. Known substance abuse disorder  or consumption of illicit drugs or alcohol in the 
24 hours prior to admission to the Center for Human Phenomic Science  (CHPS) . 
7. Prior bowel resection surgery  other than appendectomy . It is unknown how prior 
bowel resection surgery may influence the microbiome composition, hence we 
will exclude these participants . 
8. Contraindication to flexible sigmoidoscopy and biopsies. Patients with 
supp ressed white blood count may be at increased risk of systemic infection 
following sigmoidoscopy with biopsies. As such, participants  with a WBC less 
than 3,500 or an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1,000 will be excluded. 
Patients with thrombocytope nia or with a coagulopathy may be at increased risk 
of bleeding complications after colonoscopic biopsies. As such, patients with a 
platelet count of less than 100,000 or an INR greater than 1.2 will be excluded 
from the study.  
9. Estimated GFR<60ml/min/1.73m2 based on measured s erum creatinine 
concentration  
10. Pregnant and lactating women. To avoid any risk to an unborn fetus  or new born 
baby  [CONTACT_309705]’s diet , pregnant and lactating women will be 
excluded.

17. Allergies or intolerance to the components of the study diets.  
18. Participant has experienced diarrhea within the two weeks prior to Visit 2 . 
Diarrhea is defined as a change in bowel habits with an increased frequency or 
loose stools such that the stool could not be lifted with a fork.  
19. Refusal to use a medically accepted method of birth control while participating in 
this study, such as a barri er method, hormonal contraceptive s, implanted birth 
control devices, permanent methods (such as a vasectomy), and/ or abstinence.   
20. Vegans and Vegetarians.  
21. Student or employee of any one of the investigators.  
22. Anyone who cannot receive study payment (ie: visa)  
23. Any condition that the investigator feels may limit the volunteer’s ability to 
complete the study protocol.   
4.[ADDRESS_379936] 16 participants complete this study; however, it is anticipated 
we may need to scre en up to [ADDRESS_379937] the 
research coordinator by [CONTACT_309706] (i.e.: craigslist). All advertisements will be approved by [CONTACT_309707].     
Potentia l participants will be pre -screened via telephone for eligibility prior to the 
screening  visit. At the screening visit, p otential participants will be screened for eligibility 
before being enrolled in the study. Potential participants will be d irectly quer ied 
regarding exclusion criteria. If there are questions regarding eligibility, relevant 
information from the participant’s medical record will be obtained, with appropriate 
permission for release of records as necessary to comply with HIPAA . In the absenc e of 
any concerns, the participant’s medical records will not be requested or reviewed as 
part of this study.

 4.4 Early Withdrawal of Participants  
4.4.1  When and How to Withdraw Participants  
Participants may be withdrawn from the study at any time if the investigat or or 
the participant believes that the participant’s safety will be jeopardized by [CONTACT_309708] , or if the participant does not follow study procedures . Likewise, 
participants will be withdrawn from the study if they withdraw consent.  
5 Study Intervention   
All foods will be prepared within the CHPS ’s metabolic kitchen without emulsifiers 
(unless specifically added) . All participants will follow the same W estern style diet (i.e. 
the only difference being portion size).  The macronutrient percentages of calories for 
the study diet will be 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein.  The diet will be 
composed of two menus that will be consumed on alternating da ys. Water, coffee and 
tea will be provided as desired.  Participants will have access to additional food outside 
of the meals provided, however, the entire serving of the previous meal must hav e been 
consumed.  The additional food provided outside of  the sc heduled meals will consist of 
the food from the same Western style diet provided for each meal.  
For the three days prior to admission, participants will be eating an emulsifier free 
diet at home.  Food will be provided by [CONTACT_309709].  After admission  to 
CHPS , no emulsifiers will be consumed prior to dinner on Day [ADDRESS_379938] 
approximately 80 hours of emulsifier free washout time prior to administration of the 
food containing CMC.  
Participants will be randomly assigned to receive 0 or 15 gm per day of CMC (8 
participants in each arm of the study ). Beginning with the dinner meal on Day 1, all 
participants  will consume one serving  of brownie or sorbet  (15 gm) per day that contain 
[ADDRESS_379939] the number of steps they take daily.  The study team will calculate  
the average number of daily steps the participant took during the 3 days prior to 
admission . During the inpatient stay,  participants will be required to attain within 10% of 
the average number of daily steps that they took in the [ADDRESS_379940]. During the inpatient 
stay, u rine samples will be collected daily prior to 09 :00h after an overnig ht fast . Up to  
15 mL of urine will be obtained for each sample, aliquoted into three 5ml aliquots, and 
frozen  at minus 8 0°C for use in metabol omic studies . 
6.1.[ADDRESS_379941] asma will be stored frozen at 
minus 8 0°C for use in metabol omic studies . Peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) will 
also be collected from the same samples and stored at minus 8 0°C for potential future 
use in cell phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_50391].  
Participants may be con tacted and  asked to r eturn [ADDRESS_379942] sample 
of each day will be  aliquoted and frozen.  Subsequent sample s (if available) will be 
weighed and the weight will be recorded.  Each stool specimen that is collected will be 
processed  in the same manner.  The participant will be provided with a collection device 
to be placed in the commode that allows for separation of urine and feces, and keeps 
the feces se parated from the toilet water.  After the y have  finished voiding  their first stool 
of the day , the specimen will be immediately processed according to the following 
protocol  by [CONTACT_309710] .  Using vials with small spoons attached to the lid, a small 
amount of stool will  be scooped on to the spoon from the surface of the stool sample 
and leveled off with a tongue depressor.  The w eight of the sample will be recorded.  A 
minimum of  seven samples will be obtained  from one stool  collection . All samples will 
be labeled with the subject ID #, and the date  of collection from the volunteer . The core 
sample will be labeled the same way.  The aliquoted samples and the core sample will 
be immediately frozen at minus 80°C .  The nurses will rate the sample based on the 
Bristol Stool Chart .  Residual stool samples wil l be stored into up to five 15m l coring 
vials. Subsequent stools will be weighed in the collection device, rated on the Bristol 
Stool Chart, and then discarded.  
In order to have a baseline stool sample prior to study diet,  participants will be 
required to collect a stool sample prior to  the post -screening visit .  Participants will also 
collect a stool sample on the day pri or to admission  to CHPS .  Study staff will provide 
the participant with collection materials and instructions for collecting the stool at home 
and bringing it in to study staff.  Immediately after voiding the sample, t he participant will 
put a small amount  of stool into a spoon -top vial containing ethanol.  They will label this 
vial and the collection device containing the remainder of the stool sample with the date 
of collection, and will rate the stool on the Bristol Stool Chart.  They will then arrange a  
drop-off time with the study coordinator  within 48 hours of sample collection .  The study 
coordinator will bring this stool sample to the study lab on the 9th floor Biomedical 
Research Building (BRB). Lab personnel will aliquot the stool  sample into a min imum of 
7 spoon -top vials .   
Participants may be asked to provide a stool sample 1 month after discharge. In 
addition, f ollow -up stool samples (which may be collected every 3 months for up to 5 
years after the participant’s last study day) may be collected  and will be  processed in 
the same manner as the inpatient samples . The collection kit may be shipped to the 
participant’s home and the participant will either return the stool sample to study staff or 
ship it to [CONTACT_309731]’s lab at the University of Penn sylvania.

served .  Participants will be given their meal at 12:30h and will finish eating their meal 
by 13:00h.  They will complete the questionnaire again at 13:00h . The questions should 
be asked in the participant’s room with all lights on and with no food in the room.  
 
Questions to be asked are as follows.  
1) How strong is your desire to eat (very weak to very strong)?  
2) How hungry do you feel (not hungry at all to as hungry as I have ever felt)?  
3) How full do you feel (not full at all to very full)?  
4) How much fo od do you think you could eat (nothing at all to a large amount)?  
5) How preoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_309685] (no thoughts to very 
preoccupi[INVESTIGATOR_530]?  
6) What is your urge to eat (no urge to strong urge)?

acclimatization to the catheter placement, baseline blood samples will be tak en at -5 
and -1 min prior to the ingestion of 75 grams anhydrous oral glucose over a 5 min 
period starting at t = 0 at ~08 :30h.  Subsequent blood samples will be collected at t = 
15, 30, 60, 90, and [ADDRESS_379947]. Glucose, free fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, and GLP-1/GIP will be the substances 
tested.

6.2.2  Screening ( Visit 1) 
Screening evaluation sh ould be completed no more than 60 days prior to 
admission to the CHPS . After providing informed consent, the participant’s medical 
history will be collected to assess for exclusion criteria, including vital signs and 
demographic data. Demographic data collected will include age, sex, race, ethnicity, 
lifetime weight history, current and recent medication use, and past medical and 
surgical history. A physical exam will also be conducted.   
In ad dition, blood will be drawn for CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid 
panel, Hba1c, coagulation parameters following an overnight fast. Women will complete 
a urine pregnancy tes t. 
During the screening process, participants will be presented with the study diets 
to assure that they are able to consume th is for a 14 day period. Screening will not 
proceed further unless participants agree that they can follow the study diet, regardless 
to which they are assigned.

immediately prior to Visit 2  can be completed on the same day as Visit 2 . 
Three day dietary recalls will be performed by [CONTACT_309713]. Dietary 
assessments are to be performed interactively using the Nutrition Data System program 
(University of Minnesota) that includes prompts for questions depending on the food 
item enter ed as part of the interview. Using this software , the diet information will be 
summarized according to the macronutrient composition (daily consumption of calories, 
protein, fat, carbohydrates and dietary fiber). Additionally, the data on fat and other 
macronutrients can be further subcategorized, such as according percent of calories 
from saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats.

6.4 Sample preparation , processing, and storage  at the University of 
Pennsylvania  
6.4.1  Aliquoting and processing of 
samples for archiving  
Stool samples are aliquoted into spoon -
capped vials labeled with a barcode that is a 
unique identifier, the date and a protocol 
number, usuall y 6 per sample, for archiving.  
Any residual stool is aliquoted for specific 
immediate demands by [CONTACT_167210]/or 
removed from the collection vessel into up to 
five [ADDRESS_379966] of where each sample has 
been stored which can then be matche d with 
other information that is collected on this 
sample in the LabVantage lab management 
system.  Blood samples are processed for either serum or plasma, depending on the 
preservatives added at the time of sampling.  Once in the lab, the blood is centrif uged to 
clear the plasma/serum and the supernatant is measured out in 300 -500 ul aliquots into 
polypropylene cryotubes.  Each aliquot is labeled in the same manner as the stool 
aliquots and immediately placed in a barcoded box in an -80oC freezer to be arc hived 
for later use.  Finally, when retrieving a stored sample the box and aliquot barcodes are

CMC and immediately preserved in Carnoy fixative, will be assayed by [CONTACT_309721][INVESTIGATOR_2130].  Specifically, for 
each specimen, we will examine [ADDRESS_379969] bacteria 
per field as illustrated in Figure 2. The 25 distances (5 per field x 5 fields) will then be 
averaged to produce the "average closest bacteria" and compared between groups as 
reported in our mouse -based studies 19, 38. 2) Microbiota composit ion. Each fecal 
sample will be subjected to 16S, metagenomics, and meta -transcriptomic sequence -
based analysis as previously described.  Sequencing via the Illumina platform (Miseq for 
16S, NextSeq500 for metagenomics/transcriptomic). Data will be processe d and 
analyzed via the Qiime platform and R software, in a manner similar to our previous  
publications 19, 38-40. 3) Microbiota pro -inflammatory potential . For each fecal sample 
collected, we will measure fecal levels of bioactive flagellin and LPS as reported in our 
previous  publications 19, 38, 40.  Briefly, for each sample, we will prepare a soluble surface 
extract to be generated by [CONTACT_309722] -beating followed by [CONTACT_7891]. Such samples will be 
diluted and then applied to cells engineered to express receptors for TLRs 4 or 5 and 
produce peroxidase under the control of a NF -B responsive promoter - our initial 
publication using this technique describe an extensive set of control studies we have 
utilized to validat e this approach 41. These assays, standardized with E. coli flagell in and 
LPS will report the levels of bioactive LPS and flagellin, which we have shown are broadly 
reflective of a fecal specimens ability to drive pro -inflammatory gene expression upon 
injection into mice 41. Compari son between groups will use t-test, repeated measures 
ANOVA or analogous non -parametric tests.   
6.4.4  Microbial DNA Sequencing  
DNA will be prepared in the PennCHOP Microbiome Center. Samples will be 
sent to the center de -identified and coded with a study number.  We will perform 16S 
rRNA and ITS gene sequencing to evaluate the bacterial and fungal mi crobiota, 
respectively, in  rectal swab samples. Isolated DNA will be quantified using the 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_309688] 50 ng of DNA will be amplified.  Pyrosequencing will be carried 
out using barcoded primers as previously described42.  For pyrosequencing of bacteria, 
primers annealing to the V1V2 region of the 16S bacterial gene will be used.  The 
development of the ITS1 fun gal primers is described in42.  For pyrosequencing, we will 
FRESH  
  Page 29 
V2.2.20190514   
 use the [COMPANY_002]/454 Genome Sequencer Junior.  Sequence data wi ll be processed using 
QIIME43. If warranted by [CONTACT_77886], we may analyze samples further using a 
metagenomic approach, in which DNA samples are nebulized, ligated to linkers, an d 
subjected to pyrosequencing (IlluminaHiSeq).  This allows enumeration of the types of 
genes present in a sample. To determine bacterial and fungal load, respectively, we will 
determine 16S and 18S gen e copy number from the  rectal swab samples. The qPCR 
methods including the details of the primers as well as PCR cycling conditions hav e 
been previously described44. 
6.4.5  Metabolic profiling based on plasma samples  
Fasting glucose  and oral glucose tolerance (on day 1 and 11 ), day [ADDRESS_379970] comprehensive metabolic panel (includes albumin, urea, 
calcium, creatinine, glucose, and liver enzymes AST/ALT) performed at Penn’s clinical 
lab. Additionally, sera will be assayed for a range of hormones and cytokines using a 
customized bead -based assay designed to include immune inflammatory and metabolic 
markers of obesity and type 2 diabetes (includes IL -8, IL-6, TNF
 , lipocalin -2, MCP1, 
insulin, leptin, ghrelin, ESR, CRP) all of which are known to be elevated in met abolic 
syndrome (performed at GSU).  Additionally, fecal samples will be assayed for lipocalin -
[ADDRESS_379971]. For aim 1, statistical power will depend on the 
prevalence of detectable CMC in the feces of participants at the end of fol low-up. We 
anticipate that in the CMC treated group, the prevalence will be 100% and in the 
untreated group the prevalence will be 0%. However, with [ADDRESS_379972] 89% power to detect a difference if the true prevalence of detectable CM C after 2 
weeks of a high dose CMC and CMC free diet are 90% and 10%, respectively. For aim 
2, power calculation were based on preliminary data in which the difference in mean 
distance of the nearest bacteria to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_309689] 19.[ADDRESS_379973] deviation (SD) for patients without 
diabetes was 7.17. The within group SD for those with diabetes was even smaller. With 
a sample size of [ADDRESS_379974] 90% and 80% power to detect a difference in the distance of the nearest bacteria 
to the epi[INVESTIGATOR_309690] (CMC vs. no CMC) that is 35% and 
44% smaller than the difference observed between patients with and without diabetes,  
respectively. In Aim 3, the study will have 80% power to detect a difference between

V2.2.20190514   
 groups equal to 1.51 units of SD. For paired analyses within treatment groups, there will

7.2 Overview of Statistical  Methods  
Descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, range, counts, and percentage) will be 
used to describe and compare (t -test or rank sum test for continuous variables and 
Fishers exact test for categorical variables) the baseline characteristics, usual d iet, and 
immediate pre -enrollment diet between the treatment arms.

8 Safety and Adverse Events  
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that 
develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses 
or injuries should be regarded as  adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic 
procedures are considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse event  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional tre atment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by [CONTACT_309724] (SAE)  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  A serious adverse 
event  is any AE that is:  
• fatal 
• life-threatening  
• requires or prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]  
• results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• an important medical event  
 
Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life 
threatening, but are clearly of major clinical significance.   They may jeopardize the 
participant, and may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes noted above.  For example, drug overdose or abuse, a seizure that did 
not result in in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309691].  
 
All adverse events that do not meet any of the crite ria for serious will be 
regarded as non-serious adverse events . 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
FRESH  
  Page [ADDRESS_379980] administration of study diet.  
Preexisting Condition  
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A 
preexisting condition shou ld be recorded as an adverse event if the frequency, 
intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings  
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a 
preexistin g condition.  At the end of the study, any new clinically significant 
findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an AE must also be recorded and 
documented as an AE.   
Post -study Adverse Event  
All unresolved AEs  that are categorized by [CONTACT_309725], the participant is lost to follow -up, or the AE is 
otherwise explain ed.  At the last inpatient evaluation , the investigator will instruct 
each participant to report any subsequent event(s) that the participant, or the 
participant’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to 
participation in this study.  The investigat or will notify the study sponsor of any 
death or AE occurring at any time after a participant has discontinued or 
terminated study participation that may reasonably be related to this study.  The 
sponsor should also be notified if the investigator should b ecome aware of the 
development of cancer or of a congenital anomaly in a subsequently conceived 
offspring of a participant that has participated in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse  
event if any one of the following  conditions is met:   
• The laboratory abnormality is not otherwise refuted by a repeat test to 
confirm the abnormality  
• The abnormality suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity  
• The abnormality is of a degree that requires act ive management; e.g. 
change of dose, discontinuation of the drug, more frequent follow -up 
assessments, further diagnostic investigation, etc.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], Prolonged Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_309692].  Any condition responsible for surgery should be documented as an 
AE if the condition meets the criteria for an AE.   
Neither the condition, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery 
are reported as an AE in the following circumstances:

AEs by [CONTACT_5147], as appropriate, by [CONTACT_5148].  Information on all AEs 
should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate 
adverse event case report form (CRF).  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and 
abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be recorded in the source document, 
though should be grouped under one diagnosis.  
All AEs occurring during the study period must be recorded.  The clinical course 
of each event should be followed until resolution, stabilization, o r until it has been 
determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  SAEs that are still 
ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up to determine the final 
outcome.  Any SAE that occurs after the study period and is co nsidered to be possibly 
related to the study treatment or study participation should be recorded and reported 
immediately.

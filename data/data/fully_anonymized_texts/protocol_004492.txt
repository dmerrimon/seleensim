Title of Study:  A phase 2b randomized, double- blind, placebo controlled, multi -center 
12-week study with an additional 40- week follow -up assessment of 
efficacy, safety and tolerability of M1095 in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. 
Protocol No:  AV002  
Co-ordinating 
Investigators: North America :  
 
Europe :  
 
Study centers:  Approximately 60 sites, in Europe and North America  
Study duration:  52 weeks Phase: 2b 
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of four dose regimens of M1095 compared to placebo on 
achievement of an Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 after 12 weeks of 
treatment in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of four dose regimens of M1095 compared to placebo during a 12-week treatment period on secondary endpoints: Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI) 75, 
PASI 90, PASI 100, change in PASI and shift  in IGA.  
• To assess the dose -regimen efficacy relationship for M1095 after 12, 24, 36, and 48 weeks of 
treatment.  
• To evaluate the longer -term efficacy of M1095 at Week 24 and at Weeks 36 and 48.

 Exploratory:  
• Assessment of the quality of life and health outcomes of subjects treated with M1095 over 
48 weeks via quality of life instruments evaluated every 12 weeks.  
• Assessment of the population pharmacokinetics ( PK) of various doses and dose regimens of 
M1095. 
• Assessment of the development of anti -drug antibodies for various doses and dose regimens 
of M1095. 
• Assessment of change in efficacy from Week 12 to Week 24 in subjects who undergo dose 
escalation.  
• Assessment of M1095 efficacy after being withheld in subjects with a n IGA score of 0 at 
Week 24. 
Study Design:  
This is a multi- center phase 2b study in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque- type 
psoriasis. Approximately [ADDRESS_498501] of a 4 -week screening period (Week -4 to Week 0), a 12 
week treatment period which is placebo -controlled (Week 0 to Week 12), a 12 week maintenance/  
escalation period where all subjects are on active treatment (Week 12 to Week 24), a 24 week 
response assessment/dose hold period where active treatment is withheld if subjects being treated with M1095 have a n IGA score of 0 at the beginning of the period (Week 24 to Week 48) and a final 
assessment period for safety follow up (Week 48 to Week 52). The study will be double-blind up to Week 24, with subject - and investigator-blind maintained throughout. 
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio, with approximately 50 subjects randomized into 
each of six treatment groups as shown below and in Figure 1: 
1. Placebo wk 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10 / M1095 120mg wk 12, 14, 16 and q4w. 
2. M1095 30mg wk 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and q4w.  
3. M1095 60mg wk 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and q4w. 
4. M1095 120mg wk 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and q8w. 
5. M1095 120mg wk 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and q4w.

 >88% for study drug and ≤7% for placebo. As this is a phase 2 study, there will be no adjustments 
for multiplicity.  
Exploratory analyses between the different dose regimens of M1095 will also be performed. The  
PASI 100 response rate offers more discriminatory potential for this. Phase 1 data and response 
simulations give a PASI 100 response rate at Week 12 varying from 45 to 72%. With the sample size 
of approximately [ADDRESS_498522] M1095 doses has approximately 79% power. 
Analysis sets:  
The Intent  to Treat (ITT) population includ es all subjects randomly allocated to a treatment. The 
Modified Intent  to Treat (MITT) population include s all subjects in the ITT Analysis Set who receive 
at least one dose of study drug, have a baseline, and at least one post baseline efficacy assessments. 
The Per -Protocol (PP) population include s all subjects in the MITT Ana lysis Set who have no 
important protocol deviations affecting the assessment of efficacy. Membership of the PP Analysis 
Set will be confirmed prior to unblinding the data. The ITT, MITT and PP populations will be 
analy zed per planned treatment.  
The Safety  population is all subjects who receive at least one dose of study treatment. The Safety 
population will be analyz ed per the actual treatment received.  
Primary analysis:  
The primary endpoint is achievement of an IGA score of [ADDRESS_498523] dose of study medication. Any missing IGA score  of 0 or 1 response 
will be imputed as a non-response. 
The primary analysis will be based on the ITT Analysis Set. The primary treatment comparisons will 
be made using the two -sided Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by [CONTACT_396360] 
(yes/no) and body weight stratum (≤ 90kg, >90kg.)  
Sensitivity analyses:  
The primary analysis will be repeated on the MITT and PP Analysis Sets. Furthermore, selected 
sensitivity analyses will be performed on the ITT Analysis S et, including multiple imputation and 
last-observation carried forward. 
Secondary analyses:  
Secondary efficacy and QoL endpoints will be compared between treatments at each visit up to Week 
[ADDRESS_498524] for binary endpoints and an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model for changes from baseline.  
Safety data will be summarized in the Safety Analysis Set by [CONTACT_396362], for each treatment period separately and overall.

 2.0 INTRODUCTION 
M1095 is a trivalent monomeric nanobody ® that neutralizes interleukin s IL-17A, IL -17F, and 
IL-17A/F. A strong scientific and medical rationale exists for the use of M1095 in the treatment 
of autoimmune disease, including psoriasis.  
2.1 Study Rationale   
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_396346], the development of new psoriasis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_396347]. M1095 is a viable investigational treatment of psoriasis  with the potential for a 
similar or improved risk/benefit profile compared to available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  This is a phase 2b 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of M1095 for the treatment of moderate to severe 
plaque- type psoriasis.  
2.[ADDRESS_498531] about 2 -4% of the population in western 
countries with a higher prevalence in Caucasians and approximately equal frequency in males and females .
1 The mos t common form is psoriasis vulgaris (plaque -type psoriasis) which is 
characterized by [CONTACT_396363], inflamed, red skin 
covered with silvery, white scales.  The disease can appear anywhere although it is most 
commo n on extensor surfaces such as elbows and knees, plus the scalp and lower back.  Mild 
severity disease can often be managed with topi[INVESTIGATOR_12969]. As the disease severity 
increases, phototherapy or systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_396348], methotrexate, cyclo sporine, 
apremilast, or biologic immune modifying agents are required for disease control.  
The understanding of the pathophysiology behind psoriatic plaques has expanded markedly 
during the past twenty years leading to an expansion in the armamentarium for disease 
treatment.  Cytokines which are known to play a role in psoriasis include, but are not limited 
to, TNF -α, IL -12, IL -23, and IL -17.[ADDRESS_498532] therapy targeting TNF -α was approved in 2004, a therapy targeting IL-12/IL- [ADDRESS_498533] continued development of new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. 
IL-17 is a known target for psoriasis treatment and three drugs that target this  mechanism are 
currently available.  Secukinumab is a human immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG1 ) monoclonal antibody 
that selectively binds IL -17A, ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that 
selectively binds IL -17A, and brodalumab is a human monoclonal IgG2 antibody that 
selectively binds to the IL -17 receptor inhibiting interactions with IL -17A, IL -17F, IL -17C, 
IL-17A/F and IL -25.

AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated [ADDRESS_498535] with IL -17A and it has been reported that IL -
17F also plays a role in psoriasis pathophysiology.  Brodalumab does target both IL -17A and 
IL-17F; however, it also blocks the IL -17 receptor from inter acting with several other 
cytokines (IL -17C and IL -25) which may account for additional untoward effects that are not 
related to its ability to treat psoriasis.  
M1095 has been evaluated in subjects with psoriasis in study EMR200574-003, “ A 
Multicenter, Pha se 1, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo- Controlled Trial to Assess the 
Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy of Multiple Ascending Doses of Subcutaneous M1095 (Anti -IL17A/F Nanobody) in Male and 
Female Subjects with Moderate to Severe Psoriasis. ” The phase [ADDRESS_498536] efficacy and a pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile 
suitable for long- term dosing on a 4 weekly or 8 weekly schedule. Furthermore, the efficac y 
results were suggestive that M1095 at the proposed doses may be able to deliver an improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index  (PASI ) 90 and PASI  100 responses 
compared to what has been described with currently approved IL -17 modulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. A  
full description of the results for this study can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure.  
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_396346], new psoriasis therapi[INVESTIGATOR_66039]. M1095 is a viable candidate treatment with the potential for a similar or improved risk/benefit profile 
compared to available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]. All subjects in this study will receive M1095 or secukinumab  
as those randomized to placebo will switch to M1095 at Week 12. 
In EMR200574- 003, subjects received three doses of M1095 at 2-week intervals over one 
month. Dose levels of 30mg through 240mg were tested. The study demonstrated that  
• M1095 administered up to a dose of 240mg q2w x 3 was generally well tolerated in a 
group of 33 subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis. 
• AUC and Cmax were dose proportional from 30mg to 240mg with a terminal half life 
of 11-12 days. 
• A dose-response relationship was observed with PASI 75/90/[ADDRESS_498537] common AEs (occurring in 2 or more of the 33 subjects treated with M1095) were 
pruritus, headache, hypertension, nasopharyngitis, somnolence and bronchitis. Two subject s 
discontinued due to AEs (an injection site reaction in a subject receiving 120mg and an 
elevation in aminotransferases in a subject r eceiving 240mg) and one SAE  occurred (acute 
vestibular syndrome, in a subject receiving 30mg, which was deemed unrelated to study drug).

minimal to mild reddish discoloration of the skin in the axillary and inguinal regions, 
associated with a histopathological diagnosis of superficial perivascular dermatitis, was 
observed. These findings improved but did not completely recover during the recovery period in these studies. The overall risk associated with these findings in human study subjects is low. If similar findings occur they will be observable on skin evaluation and managed appropriately.   
Subjects will be followed closely (weekly during the first month, biweekly for the second and third month and then at least monthly for the remainder of the study) and observed via standard assessments including queries about AEs, periodic examinations, and laboratory assessments. 
Subjects who experience notable study drug related AEs or lab abnormalities will be 
discontinued (see Section 7.1).

ensure a well -defined population where efficacy can be determined without introducing any 
unacceptable risks.  The study design incorporates frequent visits and evaluations to optimize 
assessment of endpoints and collection of safety data. 
4.3 Justification for Dose 
The M1095 doses selected for the study (30mg, 60mg, 120mg) are based on the results from 
the phase 1 multiple dose study EMR200574- 003 in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis  
(Figure 2). All doses in study EMR200574- [ADDRESS_498550] dose planned for this 
study, 120mg. This suggests that the doses selected are differentiated and will allow an 
understanding of the dose/exposure response relationship. It is notable that the dosing regimen 
employed in the phase [ADDRESS_498551] that PASI 100 scores at Week 12 will 
vary between approximately 45% to 60% in subjects receiving 30mg M1095 administered at Week 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12, and 72% to 85% in subjects receiving 120mg M1095 administered at Week  0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12. While comparison between each treatment arm will not 
necessarily reveal statistically significant differences , exploratory comparisons between the 
various dose arms will enable exploration of several  questions: (1) does the amount of drug 
significantly affect Week 12 response? (comparison of 30 mg, 60mg and 120 mg where drug 
is administered on an identical schedule); (2) does duration and schedule of loading affect Week 12 response? (comparison of 120mg administered as q2w x 7 and q2w x 3 followed by q4w x 2); (3) does frequency of administration affect longer term results? (comparison of Week 
24 response for the different 120mg dose regimens ). 
The highest dose planned in this  phase 2b study, 120mg , has shown adequate safety when 
administered q2w for three doses in the phase [ADDRESS_498552] not be used to support any marketing authorization application or any variation or extension of such application

 M1095 doses (in Arms 1 to 5) may be replaced by [CONTACT_396364] 24 as described in Section 
6.6.2.  
6.2 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
Further guidance and information can be found in the Study Drug Manual provided for the 
study.  
The investigator is responsible for study drug accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Study drug storage and 
accountability will be reviewed by [CONTACT_396365].  
Study drug will be provided as subject kits each containing 2 vials (A and  B) of M1095 of the 
appropriate strength (60mg or 120mg) to reconstitute the randomized dose  and/or matching 
placebo, and subject kits containing commercial s ecukinumab 2 x 150mg pre -filled syringes.  
M1095 and placebo will be supplied as a lyophilized powder in glass vials . The 30mg dose 
will be reconstituted from a 60mg vial with 1mL placebo and 1mL sterile water for injection 
(WFI), the 60mg dose will be rec onstituted from a 60mg vial with 1mL sterile WFI, and the 
120mg dose  will be reconstituted from a 120mg vial with 1mL sterile WFI. Secukinumab will 
be supplied as commercial pre-filled syringes, over-labelled and packaged for the study.   
All study drug mu st be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual 
or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions (2 to 8oC, 36 to 46oF) 
with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  The investigator or  designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all study drug  received and any discrepancies must be reported 
and resolved before the study drug is used. Investigators and site staff are reminded to check temperatures daily (i.e., manually or by [CONTACT_396366]) and ensure that temperature monitoring device(s) is 
(are) working correctly as required for proper storage of study drug . Any temperature 
excursions should be documented and reported to the sponsor, noting any actions taken. Once a deviation is identified, study drug must be quarantined and not used until the sponsor 
provides documentation of permission that the study drug can be used . 
All study drugs will be prepared for injection by [CONTACT_396367] 1mL 
volume. The syringes for injection will be provided to the site approved study drug 
administrator , who is also unblinded (see Section 6.3 for further details) . The unblinded 
preparer and the unblinded administrator may be the same person. 
Study drug will be administered via subcutaneous inject ion. All doses are comprised of two 
injections, each of 1mL, which should be administered at least [ADDRESS_498573] not be used to support any marketing authorization application or any variation or extension of such application

AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated [ADDRESS_498574] with 1ml of solution from vial A and 1ml of solution from vial 
B. Subjects assigned to secukinumab will be dosed with 2 x 150mg /mL pre-filled syringes, as 
directed.  Blinded study personnel should not be in attendance while study drug  is being 
prepared or administered . Used syringes should be placed immediately out of sight in a sealed 
sharps container.  
Subjec ts should be observed for approximately [ADDRESS_498575]  experiences symptoms indicative of an acute hypersensitivity reaction after 
an injection, this should be discussed with the Medical M onitor before the next study 
visit/injection . 
Regulatory agencies require accounting for the disposition of all study d rugs received by [CONTACT_396368]. The investigator is responsible for maintaining information related to drug 
disposition which at minimum consists of the date received, date dispensed, quantity dispensed 
and the subject to whom the drug was dispensed. 
At the end of the study, the investigator should return unused study drug and packaging to the 
sponsor’s representative.  Local destruction may be permitted with the sponsor’s approval.  
6.3 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding  
All subjects will be centrally assigned to randomized study drug using an Interactive Response 
Technology System (I RT). Before the study is initiated, the log in information and directions 
for the IRT (including the process for emergency unblinding)  will be provided to each site, 
plus a back up telephone number and call-in directions.  
Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits as summarized in the SoA  (Section 1.3).  
Any study drug that is prepared but not administered to a subject should not be re-dispensed. 
Unblinding will only occur during the study in the case of subject emergencies where it is 
necessary to determine the subject’s treatment assignment to ensure the best course of medical 
management is taken.  The I RT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case 
of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if the unblinding of a subject’s treatment assignment is warranted. Subject safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. While not required, it is recommended that the 
investigator should contact [CONTACT_396369]. If a subject’s treatment assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_498576] 
form (eCRF ), as applicable.

AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated 16 October  2018  
 The outer packaging of study kits will appear  identical, but as the M1095 and placebo doses 
require reconstitution , and secukinumab is provided as commercially available pre -filled 
syringes (PFS), it is not possible to blind the study completely. An unblinded study drug 
preparer will be responsible for the reconstitution and dispensation of study drug and will 
endeavor to ensure that there are no differences in the time taken to dispense each arm of the 
study.   
Once syringes for injection have been prepared, the y will be provided to the study drug 
administrator , who will also be unblinded.  
The study drug preparer and the study drug administrator may be the same person.  
 
Other than the study drug preparer and administrator, the study team (including the IGA and 
PASI assessors) will be completely blinded throughout the study and will be kept physically 
separate from the preparation and administration of study medication.   
The subject blind will be maintained by [CONTACT_2224] M1095 and matched placebo. The syringes 
used for all M1095 and placebo doses will be identical. All subjects will receive two injections 
of 1mL at each visit. There is also physical protection of the blind. Subjects will be asked to 
wear an eye -mask for all injections.  
An unblinded interim analysis of 12- week data will occur  at the completion of the 12- week 
period, while the  study is still ongoing.  This will be managed by [CONTACT_396370].  This data will be shared with firewalled 
individuals who are not directly involved in the conduct of the study.  
All members of the  sponsor’s study team  will be blinded to subject treatment assignments until 
all subjects complete 24 weeks and the database is locked, with all  queries through Week 24 
resolved. After Week 24 data has been cleaned and locked, the study statistician and designated 
sponsor team  members will be unblinded to perform analysis of key study endpoints. All other 
members of the sponsor’s study team,  site staff (except the unblinded preparer) and subjects 
will remain blinded until the end of study. An unblinded study monitor will be assigned by [CONTACT_396371] . The unblinded study monitor will not reveal any study detai ls that could 
unblind the study to the blinded study monitor. In the event of a Quality Assurance audit, the auditor(s) will also be allowed access to unblinded study drug records at the site(s) to verify that randomization/dispensing has been performed ac curately . 
Laboratory p erson nel performing the bioanalytical PK sample analysis m ay receive an open 
randomization list to enable analysis of relevant samples.  In addition, a PK analyst and 
model ling/simulation scientist may  receive an open randomization list to enable preparation of 
modell ing/simulation activities.  These individuals will not interact with site or CRO personnel .

DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL  
Subjects should be discontinued from study drug if any of the criteria described in Section 7.[ADDRESS_498581] (e.g. rebound assessments). The information to be collected is identical to the Early 
Discontinuation visit, as described in the SoA (Section 1.3) and Section 8.1.11. 
A subject  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contact[CONTACT_9298]. Such subjects will be 
considered to have discontinued the study. 
Subjects who are prematurely discontinued from study treatment, or who have chosen to

 The appropriate personnel from the study site and the sponsor or it’s designee  will assess 
whether study treatment should be discontinued for any subject whose treatment code has been 
broken inadvertently for any reason.  Subjects who discontinue study treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study. They will continue to be followed up for assessments . See the SoA, Section 1.3 and 
Section 8.1.11 for the required assessments of these subjects after study treatment 
discontinuation.  Subjects should be considered to still be on study unless any of the criteria for study withdrawal are met (see Section 7.2).  
7.1.1 Temporary Discontinuation  
Temporary discontinuations are not permitted in this study. Any missed doses should be 
discussed with the Medical Monitor.  
7.1.2 Rechallenge  
Rechallenge is defined as the re -introduction of study drug following a temporary withdrawal/ 
dose hold for safety related reasons.  Rechallenge is not permitted for any reason including after study  drug being withheld due to 
related/possibly related AEs; in these circumstances the Medical Monitors should be consulted 
prior to withholding study drug and the subject considered for permanent discontinuation.

withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator  or the sponsor  for safety, behavior al, 
compliance, or administrative reasons. 
 If the subject  withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain 
and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
 If a subject  withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken 
and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records.  
 
If premature withdrawal occurs for any reason, the investigator must make every effort to determine the primary reason for a subject’s premature withdrawal from the study and record this information on the applicable eCRF. The withdrawn subjects must return for a follow-up 
visit approximately [ADDRESS_498589] dose of study drug to assess their efficacy, safety , 
quality of life ( QoL), report any AEs and assess duration of effect (e.g. rebound assessments).

[CONTACT_762]. 
The following actions must be taken if a subject  fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_396373]. The subject should be counselled on the importance of maintaining the 
assigned visit schedule and it should be ascertained  whether the subject  wishes to 
and/or should continue in the study. 
• Before a subject  is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_1155]  (where possible, three telephone calls 
and, if necessary, a certified letter to the subject ’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_9300] ’s 
medical record.  
• Should the subject  continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
discontinued from the study.

 8.0 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA  (Section 1.3) . Study visit 
dates are scheduled relative to Week 0.  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. 
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the subject  should continue or discontinue 
study drug. 
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  
(Section 1.3), is essential and required for study conduct. 
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential subject s meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or reco rd reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) during any visit should be conducted before other 
tests, procedures, or consultations.  
• IGA, BSA  and PASI during any visit should be conducted after the PROs (if applicable)  
and before other tests, procedures and consultations. As far as possible, the same evaluator should perform the IGA, BSA and PASI at all visits for a particular subject, 
especially at Week 0 (randomization), Week 12, and Week 24. 
• The maximum amount of blo od collected from each subject  over the duration of the  
study, including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 565mL, 
with a maximum 50mL taken at any visit. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical issues with the samples.  
8.1 Study Procedures  
8.1.1 Screening  
Subjects will attend for a Screening Visit during the 4 weeks (28 days) prior to Week 
0/randomiz ation. This is designed to assess the inclusion/exclusion criteria and establish 
baseline characteristics.  
The approved consent form must be signed and dated by [CONTACT_396374]. AEs will be collected from 
the time that consent is signed.  
IGA, BSA  and PASI should be performed before any other study procedures, assessments or 
consultations. The following assessments will be performed and information collected:-

and the repeat test are both ‘indeterminate’, the subject must be referred for tuberculosis workup per local guidelines.  
o If any Quantiferon TB test is ‘positive’ or if the first test 
and the repeat test are both ‘indeterminate’, the subject is 
eligible for randomization if (i) they have a known history of latent TB and have completed a course of treatment or (ii) they have has received sufficient treatment for latent TB to allow concomitant treatment with a biological therapy as per local guidelines (note these subjects must continue their concomitant latent TB treatment to completion while partici pating in the study, and if these 
subjects are outside of the screening window (>28 days since consent ) when they become eligible to participate, 
they should be fully re-screened for the study). 
o If any Quantiferon  TB test is ‘positive’ or if the first test 
and the repeat test are both ‘indeterminate’, the subject is 
not eligible for randomization if either ‘active tuberculosis is present’ or if ‘latent tuberculosis is present and is untreated per local guidelines.’

state at the time of the assessments, and does not attempt a comparison with any of the subject’s 
previous disease states, whether at baseline or at a previous visit.  
The IGA mod 2011 score will initially be recorded on paper, and then entered in the I RT/eCRF.  
8.2.2 Assessment of Total Body Surface Area (BSA) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  
The total BSA affected by [CONTACT_109010] -type psoriasis will be estimated from the percentages of 
areas affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs ( see Section 10.6.2, 
Appendix 6).  
The PASI combines assessments of the extent of body -surface area involvement in 4 
anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of desquamation, erythema, 
and plaque  induration/ infiltration (thickness) in each region, yielding an overall score of [ADDRESS_498598] 75%, 90%, or 100%, respectively, in PASI score from baseline.  
The site will initially record  assessments on paper, and will then enter the data into the eCRF, 
which will auto-calculate the PASI score (no manual PASI calculations will be performed by 
[CONTACT_779]).

AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated 16 October  2018  
 The instrument essentially consists of 2 pages – the EQ -5D descriptive system and the EQ 
visual analogue scale (VAS). The EQ -5D descriptive system comprises the following 5 
dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, p ain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension has 3 response levels: no problems, some problems, severe problems. The subject 
is asked to indicate their health state by [CONTACT_396377] [ADDRESS_498599]’s self -rated health on a vertical, VAS  where the endpoints ar e 
labelled ‘Best imaginable hea lth state’ and ‘Worst imaginable helath state.’ This information 
can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by [CONTACT_112775]. 
The EQ -PSO questionnaire will be completed by [CONTACT_396378] (Section 
1.3). It will be completed using an electronic tablet device.  8.4 Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 1.3).  Safety assessment s will include collection of AEs, skin evaluation, laborator y values , vital 
signs, ECGs,  drug discontinuations, and instruments to assess depression and suicidality 
[electronic Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( eC-SSRS) and Personal Health 
Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ -8)]. Blinded data will be reviewed during the study.  An

The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. 
Laboratory reports must be filed with th e source documents. Clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_1173]'s condition. 
All laboratory tests with  values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study or within  eight weeks  after the last dose of study drug should be 
repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_396380] M onitor.

considers it important to monitor for such events before and during this clinical study. 
Subjects being treated in this study should be monitored appropriately and observed closely 
for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Consideration 
should be given to discontinuing study drug in subjects who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior.  
Families and caregivers of study subjects should be instructed to monitor for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior, and to report such symptoms immediately to the study  investigator.  
Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior  and treatment -emergent suicidal ideation 
and behavior will be assessed during the study using the electronic Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (e-C- SSRS).  Depression will be assessed  using the Patient Health Questionnaire -
8 (PHQ -8).

8.5 Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events  (SAEs) 
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section 10.3, Appendix 3. AEs will be reported by [CONTACT_423]  (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the 
subject 's legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording e vents that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that caused the subject to discontinue the study drug. 
Adverse events of speci al interest (AESI) include cytopenias, liver function test 
changes/enzyme elevations, infections, injection -site reactions, allergic/hypersensitivity 
reactions, cerebrocardiovascular events, malignancies, depression, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.   These events are based on Phase [ADDRESS_498607] not be used to support any marketing authorization application or any variation or extension of such application

AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated 16 October  2018  
 8.5.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information  
AEs will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form (ICF).  
Medical conditions that begin before the start of study drug but after obtaining informed 
consent will be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the 
eCRF , not the AE section , unless related to study procedures. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the s ponsor or designee with in [ADDRESS_498608]’s study participation . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a 
death, at any time after a subject  has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the 
event to be reasonably related to the study drug or study participation, the investigator must 
promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 10.3, 
Appendix 3. 
8.5.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open- ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.5.3 Follow- up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject  
at subsequent visits/contacts. SAEs  and AEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, 
the event is otherwise explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -up (as defined in S ection 7.3). 
AEs not considered serious or as an AESI will be considered ongoing if they have not resolved 
by [CONTACT_10585] 52. Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Section 10.3, Appendix 
3.

least 8 weeks (5 terminal half lives) after the last  study dose. 
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]R) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to 
investigators as necessary.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (e .g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then 
file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC if appropriate according to  local requirements.

If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform the sponsor within 24 hours  of 
learning  of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 10.4, Appendix 
4. 
Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e .g., spontaneous abortion, feta l death,  stillbirth, congenital  
anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs  and should be reported to the sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours. 
8.5.6 Cardiovascular and Death Events 
Cardiovascular AEs should be reported as AEs/SAEs as described in Sections 8.[ADDRESS_498611]-mortem findings including histopathology.

sponsor should be notified immediately. 
Medication errors are reportable irrespective of the presence of an associated AE/SAE, 
including: 
• Medication errors involving subject  exposure to the study drug.  
• Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating subject . 
Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by [CONTACT_1149], as determined by [CONTACT_093], the medication error, and, if applicable, any associated AE(s) is captured on an 
AE eCRF page.   
8.7 Pharmacokinetics  
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at the timepoints specified on the SoA  (Section 
1.3). 
Samples will be shipped initially to the study’s central laboratory and tested by [CONTACT_47662]'s designee. 
Serum M1095 levels will be assessed at trough ( i.e. before  study drug is given) at the following 
visits: Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 44, 48, 52 and Early Discontinuation. M1095 serum 
concentrations will be summarized at these timepoints.   
Drug concentration information will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel 
until the study has been unblinded. 
Details of the analysis will be provided either in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) , or in a 
separate PK P lan, prior to the analysis taking place.

and sent to a specialis t laboratory for analysis of genomic biomarkers, specifically the 
expression of inflammatory mediators  that characterize various immune reactions.  
8.10.1 Immunogenicity Assessments  
Antibodies to M1095 will be evaluated in serum samples collected at the timepoints specified 
on the SoA (Section 1.3)  
Samples will be shipped initially to the study’s central laboratory and tested by [CONTACT_47662]'s designee. Serum anti -drug antibodies will be assessed at trough (i.e. before study drug is given) at the 
following visits: Weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 44, 48, 52 and Early Discontinuation.   
Serum samples will be screened for antibodies binding to M1095 and the titer of confirmed 
positive samples will be reported. Other analyses may be performed t o verify the stability of 
antibodies to M1095 and/or further characterize the immunogenicity of M1095. 
The detection and characterization of antibodies to M1095 will be performed using a validated 
assay method by [CONTACT_43754]. All samples collected for detection 
of antibodies to study drug will also be evaluated for M1095 serum concentration (see Section 
8.7) to enable interpretation of the antibody data. Positive samples for anti-d rug antibodies will 
be evaluated to determine if the antibodies are neutralizing or non- neutralizing.    
If a subject’s final anti -drug antibody sample is positive (i.e. sample from W eek 52 or sample 
from an Early Discontinuation visit) then the sponsor may request an addition sample be 
collected approxim ately six to twelve months after completion of the study. Subjects will be 
informed of this in the consent form and will have the option to refuse this additional sample.   
With a subject’s consent, s amples may be stored following the last subject’s last visit for the 
study at a facility selected by [CONTACT_396381]

Statistical analysis of this study will be the responsibility of the sponsor or its designee.  
Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the number of observations (n); mea n; 
standard deviation and/or standard error of the mean, if applicable; median;  minimum; and 
maximum.  
Categorical data will be summarized in terms of the number  of observations (n), frequency 
count, and percentages. 
All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.05 unless otherwise 
stated.  
Any change t o the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment 
ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any ot her change to the data analysis 
methods described in the protocol, and the justification for making the change, wi ll be 
described in the clinical study report (CSR) . Additional exploratory analyses of the da ta will 
be conducted as deemed appropriate. Complete details of the planned analyses will be 
documented in the SAP.

(ITT) Analysis Set with an IGA score of 0 or 1 at Week 12  will be used to compare treatment 
arms . The following null hypotheses will be tested at Week 12: 
• H1: M1095 30mg q2w x 3, followed by 30mg q4w x 1, is not different from  placebo 
with respect to achievement of IGA scores of 0 or 1.

 9.2 Sample Size Determination  
A sufficient number of subjects will be screened, so that a total of approximately 300 subjects 
will be randomized  (approximately  50 per treatment group.) 
With this sample size, the study has >99% power to detect a statistically significant difference 
between any treatment arm and placebo in the IGA score of 0 or 1  rate at Week 12, with a two -
sided, unadjusted type I error of 0.05. These calculations assume IGA score of 0 or 1  rates of 
>88% for study drug and ≤7% for placebo.6 As this is a phase 2 study, there will be n o 
adjustments for multiplicity.  
Exploratory analyses between the different dose levels of M1095 will also be performed. The PASI 100 response rate offers more discriminatory potential for this. Phase 1 data and response 
simulations give a PASI 100 response rate at Week 12 varying from 45 to 72%.  With the 
sample size of [ADDRESS_498618] M1095 doses has approximately 7 9% 
power. 
Power calculations have been performed with  SAS v.9.[ADDRESS_498619] of equal proportions. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_396360] (yes, no) and weight (≤90kg, >90kg).  9.3 Populations for Analyses 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined: 
Population Description  
Enrolled  All subjects  who sign informed consent 
Intent  to Treat

 of the CSR, the results of this study will be either submitted for publication and/or made 
publicly available via the Eudr aCT database and www.Clinical Trials.gov.  
10.1.7 Data Quality Assurance 
• All subject data relating to the study will be recorded on an eCRF (printed pages are 
acceptable only if the eCRF is unavailable)  unless transmitted to the sponsor or 
designee electronically (e.g., laboratory data). The investigator is responsible for verifying that data entries are accurate and correct by [CONTACT_46388].  
• The investigator must maintain accurate documentation (source data) that supports the information entered in the e CRF.  
• The investigator must permit study -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and 
regulatory agency inspections and provide direct access to source data documents.  
• The sponsor or designee is responsible for the data management of this study including quality checking of the data.  
• Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by a uthorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and 
verifiable from source documents; that the safety and rights of subjects  are being 
protected; and that the study is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  
• Records and documents, including signed ICFs, pertaining to the conduct of this study 
must be retained by [CONTACT_1732] 15 years after study completion unless local 
regulations or institutional policies require a longer retention period. No records may 
be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of the sponsor. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor.  
10.1.8 Source Documents  
• Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the subject  and substantiate 
the integrity of the data collected. Source documents are filed at the investigator’s site.  
• Data entered in the eCRF that are transcribed from source documents must be 
consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained. The 
investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records. Also, current medical records must be available.  
• Definition of what constitute s source data can be found in the Source Data Agreement 
agreed with each investigator prior to site initiation.

AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated [ADDRESS_498630] been collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed. 
The investigator may i nitiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. 
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by [CONTACT_11004]: 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines 
• Inadequate recruitment of subjects  by [CONTACT_093] 
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development 
Study recruitment will be stopped at a site when the total requested number of subjects for the 
study has been obtained, irrespective of the specific site’s inclusion number. Investigators will 
be informed when recruitment is to ce ase. 
When study analyses are complete the investigators will receive information about the treatment allocation for the subjects randomised at their respective sites.  
The sponsor  may stop the study prematurely after consultation with the investigator, e.g. , if the 
subject recruitment is so slow that the study cannot be completed within a reasonable time 
frame. Such premature termination/suspension of the study  will be notified to Regulatory 
Authorities and IECs/IRBs as required.  
10.1.10 Publication Policy  
• The resu lts of this study may be published or presented at scientific meetings. If this is 
foreseen, the investigator agrees to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the sponsor 
before submission. This allows the sponsor to protect proprietary information and to provide comments.  
• The sponsor will comply with the requirements for publication of study results. In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the sponsor will generally support publication of multicenter studies only in their entirety and not as individual site data. In this case, a coordinating investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12992].  
• Authorship will be determined by [CONTACT_23531].

 10.4 Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance and Collection of Pregnancy 
Information 
Contraceptive guidance is given as per the Clinical Trial Facilitation Group recommendations 
related to contraception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials.[ADDRESS_498632] -
menopausal defined as 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) .  
Highly effective contraception must be used by [CONTACT_396386] [ADDRESS_498633] dose of study drug.  
 Highly e ffective co ntraception is defined as:  
i. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual 
lifestyle of the subject. [ Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not 
acceptable methods of contraception ]. 
ii. Female sterilization: have had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with 
or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before 
taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by [CONTACT_396387]. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post -vasectomy 
documentation of absence of sperm in the ejaculate). (For female 
subjects on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that subject ). 
iv. Use of established oral, intravaginal, transdermal, injectable or 
implantable hormonal methods of contraception associated with 
inhibition of ovulation.  
v. Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone- releasing system 
(IUS) . 
Male subjects must also use  contraception throughout the study and for [ADDRESS_498634] dose of study drug. The following methods of contraception are permitted for male study subjects. 
i. Condom 
ii. Sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of 
absence of sperm in the ejaculate).  
iii. Contraception taken by [CONTACT_396388].

 Page 89 of 103 
AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated [ADDRESS_498635] follow the 
study’s contraceptive guidance. This includes the final study visit, either Week 52 or the Early Discontinuation – Visit 2, when subjects will be reminded that they must follow the study’s contraceptive guidance for at least 4 more weeks, and that they should inform the investigator immediately should they or  their partner become pregnant in this time.   
Pregnancy Testing  
• Women of child bearing potential should only be included in the study after a confirmed 
menstrual period and a negative highly sensitive serum  pregnancy test, performed by [CONTACT_10748]’s central laboratory as part of study screening . 
• Local  pregnancy testing should be performed at the baseline (randomization) visit, and at 
Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 52, plus the Early Discontinuation 
Visit. Pregnancy testing will also be performed whenever a menstrual cycle is missed or 
when pregnancy is otherwise suspected. A  urine dipstick test will be performed locally by 
[CONTACT_396389].  
• If at any stage, a local pregnancy test  is positive , a highly sensitive serum pregnanc y test 
should be performed via the study’s central laboratory.  
Collection of Pregnancy Information: 
Male subjects  with partners who become pregnant  
• The investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male subject ’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject  is in this study.  
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the sponsor’s designee within 24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. 
The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, the foll ow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female subjects who become pregnant  
• The investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who becomes 
pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on the appropriate form and  submitted to the sponsor within [ADDRESS_498636] 's pregnancy. 
The subject  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The investigator 
will collect follow -up information on the subject  and the neonate and the information will 
be forwarded to the sponsor. Generally, follow -up will not be required for longer than 6 
to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.

AV002 – Final  protocol, Version 3.0, incorporating CZE -1, dated 16 October  2018  
 • Any female subject who becomes pr egnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study drug.  
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post -study pregnancy 
related SAE considered reasonably related to the study intervention by [CONTACT_55901] 8.5.4. While the investigator is not obligated to 
actively seek this information in former study subjects , he or she may learn of an SAE through 
spontaneous reporting.

achieves a score of 0 or 1.  
10.6.2 Total Body Surface Area (BSA) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 
(PASI) 
The total BSA affected by [CONTACT_109010] -type psoriasis will be estimated from the percentages of 
areas affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs (see below for PASI assessment).   
The site will initially record assessments on paper and will then enter the data into the eCRF, 
which will auto-calculat e the PASI score  (no manual PASI calculations will be required by [CONTACT_39722]).  
Rounding should occur (e.g. 9.49% = 9 and 9.5% = 10) except in any instance where the percentage is just above 0 (i.e. 0.25% should round up to 1, not down to 0). 
 
A PASI score will be derived as indicated in Table 4.11, 12 The head, trunk, upper limbs and 
lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration), and scaling (desquamation). The average degree of severity of each sig n in each of the four 
body regions is assigned a score of 0- 4. The area covered by [CONTACT_396390] a percentage of the total area of that particular body region. Further practical details help the assessment: 
• The neck is assessed as part of the head.  
• The axillae and groin are assessed as part of the trunk.  
• The buttocks are assessed as part of the lower limbs. 
• When scoring the severity of erythema, scales should not be removed.

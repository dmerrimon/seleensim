[ADDRESS_716042] : 
Almost two thirds of individuals in the [LOCATION_002] living with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are women  (Snyder et 
al., 2016 ). Several factors may account for the increased risk of AD in women, including genetic susceptibility  
(Chêne et al., 2015 ; Snyder et al., 2016 ), increased rates of heart disease  (K. A. Lin, Choudhury, Petrella, & 
Doraiswamy, 2015 ), stress and anxiety  (Burke, Cadet, Alcide, O'Driscoll, & Maramaldi, 2017 ; McLean & 
Anderson, 2009 ), premature “wearing out ” of brain connectivity  (Snyder et al., 2016 ), hormon al factors  (Manly et 
al., 2000 ; Viña & Lloret, 2010 ), as well as increased risk of insomnia (Burke et al., 2017 ; Ohayon, 2002 ), 
bereavement  (Martikainen & Valkonen, 1996 ), and depression  (Burke et al., 2017 ) in late life . Respi[INVESTIGATOR_547332] (Billinger, Vidoni, Honea, & Burns, 
2011 ; Burns et al., 2008 ; Sasano et al., 2002 ). While conscious control of the heart is difficult to achieve, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_547333]  (Bhavanani, 
Ramanathan, & Madanmohan, 2015 ). Preventative measures  such as mind -body interventions may help to 
reduce risk in women  at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314] (i.e., those with high cerebrovascular risk and subjective 
memory complaints ). Mind -body interventions may be particularly beneficial for improving quality of life, cognitive 
functioning , and cardiovascular health in women  at risk for AD. Previous research in our  lab has demonstrated 
the efficacy  of mind -body interventions in improvi ng cognition, mood, resilience , and quality of life  in older adults 
with amnestic mild cognitive i mpairment  (MCI)  (B. P. Acevedo, Pospos, & Lavretsky, 2016 ; Eyre et al., 2016 ; 
Eyre et al., 2017 ; H. Yang et al., 2016 ).  To date, no such studies have targeted women with increased  
cardiovascular  risk for AD . We propose to investigate the e fficacy and neurobiological mechanisms of response 
to a mind -body yogic meditation program for improving  cognition, mood , cardiovascular and respi[INVESTIGATOR_38324] , 
and overall quality of lif e in adult women at elevated risk  for developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314].  
 
Specifically, we aim to  investigate the neurobiological mechanistic  response  of women  to memory enhancement 
training (MET) compared to combined Kundalini  yoga (KY) and Kirtan  Kriya  (KK, a Kundalini yoga meditation ) 
through a randomized study targeting women with high AD risk .  For the purposes of this study, women with high 
risk for AD are defined as women with high cardiovascular risk  (Ho, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_23750], Kannel, & Levy, 1993 ; Truelsen, 
Lindenstrom, & Boysen, 1994 ) and subjective memory complaints . The  methodology  for this study  is based on 
our study  of individuals with MCI randomized to either combined KK+KY  or to memory enhancement training 
(MET)  (B. P. Acevedo et al., 2016 ; Eyre et al., 2016 ; Eyre et al., 2017 ; H. Yang et al., 2016 ). Compared to MET, 
KK+KY  demonstrated short - and long -term benefits in executive functioning, as well as broader effects on 
depressed mood and resilience. The positive outcomes of this study  suggest that KK +KY may be a promising 
intervention for reducing risk for AD in women. Our study sample will consist of  100 women  over the age of 50 
with high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314]. Participants will be randomized  to 12 weeks of either  KK+KY or MET.  The 
primary outcome is memory  performance. Secondary outcomes  include executive functioning , brain structure 
and connectivity . The benefit of interventions will be determined at [ADDRESS_716043] the mechanisms and efficacy of the proposed  intervention s to improve memory and 
cognitive performance, mood, resilience and quality of life  in older women, with the purpose of reducing AD risk 
in this population.  We will use the proposed model to develop preve ntive interventions for women at high-risk for 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314] . 
 
Introduction:  
 
Alzheimer disease (AD) is an increasingly widespread, fatal neurodegenerative disease that is largely resistant 
to current attempts to slow its progression. Substantial evidence points to a significant health disparity in rates 
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in women, suggesting that f emale gender may be an inherent risk factor for the 
development of AD . Currently, nearly two -thirds of individuals within the [LOCATION_002] living with  AD are women.  
In her 60s, a  woman’s lifetime risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_547334], compa red to a one in 11 risk for men. 
Furthermore, among adults with mild cognitive impairment, women’s cognitive abilities appear to decline roughly 
twice as fast as those  of their male counterparts  (Chêne et al., 2015 ). As such, it is essential that we characterize 
specific risk factors unique to women  and determine  whether these factors  are amenable to intervention. This

[ADDRESS_716044] women at particularly high risk 
for AD.  
 
Risk Factors  
For years, the observation that women develop AD in disproportionate numbers to men was explained by 
[CONTACT_31267]’s longer ( four to five years  longer , on average ), life spans - and that age is the number -one risk factor for 
the disease. As science progresses, several additional factors have been identified which likely contribute to this 
health disparity.  
 
First, neuroanatomy research suggests that  women have a higher ratio of  white matter  to grey matter  volume  
compared to men, which may lead to greater susceptibility to cognitive impairment  (van den Heuvel et al. , 2004 ). 
Rate of a ccumulation of beta -amyloid, a brain plaque proposed to play a role in AD, also differs between sexes, 
and may also contribute to the increased rates  of AD observed in  women  (Snyder et al., 2016 ). In addition , 
women may experience higher cardiovascular burden  than men in older age, potentially leading to 
microstructural differences in women that make their brains more vulnerable  to AD . Researchers further suggest 
that because men are more likely to die from heart disease in middle age than women, those who live past the 
age of [ADDRESS_716045] dementia  (K. A. Lin et al., 2015 ). Indeed, the 
Framingham Heart Study suggests that sex differences in cardiovascular risk among men and women in late -
life may in part explain the highe r rates of AD among women  (K. A. Lin et al., 2015 ). AD and cardiovascular 
disease share several risk factors, including obes ity, diabetes, and high cholesterol.  
 
Women may also have increased genetic risk  for AD compared to men. In a study of more than 8,[ADDRESS_716046] University found that women who carry the ApoE4 gene tic variant , which increases AD 
risk (as well as risk for cardiovascular disease), were more than twice as likely to go on to develop the disease 
than women without the gene. They found that male carriers, on the other hand, only had a slightly increased 
risk when compared with men who didn’t  have the gene  (Altmann, Tian, Henderson, & Greicius, 2014 ). Other 
studies have  shown that not only does ApoE4 increase a woman’s risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_201314], but that it also 
increases the severity of d ementia in those who develop it  (Snyder et al., 2016 ; van den Heuvel et al., 2004 ). On 
brain scans and tests of cognitive performance, women with the gene have shown greater brain atrophy and 
worse memory perform ances compared to men with the same gene  (Snyder et al., 2016 ).  
 
AD has further been associated with abnormal respi[INVESTIGATOR_547335]. For example, multiple  studies  have  found 
impaired blood pressure responses to the Valsalva maneuver and impaired heart rate responses to the handgrip 
task (challenges for the autonomic nervous system ) in AD (Jense n-Dahm et al., 2015 ). Other impairments 
included inspi[INVESTIGATOR_547336], increasing the risk for more severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_11800], and 
exercise -related c ardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_547335], including oxygen consumption and minute ventilation  (Billinger et 
al., 2011 ; Burns et al., 2008 ; Sanches et al., 2014 ). A 29 -year longitudinal study in originally healthy women 
found that poorer respi[INVESTIGATOR_547337]  (Guo et al., 2007 ). Moreover, studies in young, healthy participants have demonstrated that the presence 
of the APOE -e4 allele is associated with abnormal brain and neurovascular functioning, blood pressure, heart 
rate and end -tidal CO 2 (Filippi[INVESTIGATOR_49954]., 2009 ; Suri et al., 2015 ). Respi[INVESTIGATOR_547338], and can affect 
cardiovascular functioning  (Sasano et al., 2002 ). For instance paced breathing at 5.5 breaths per minute can 
increase heart rate variabil ity and enhance feelings of relaxation in healthy individuals  (I. M. Lin, Tai, & Fan, 
2014 ).   
  
It’s possible the APoE4 gene tic variant  may present an increased  risk for AD in women because of how it 
interacts with estrogen. Researchers believe that estrogen may have neuroprotective properties, as well as 
provide protection in the context of AD, particularly when it comes to defending cells a gainst amyloid -beta toxicity  
(Viña & Lloret, 2010 ). As women undergo menopause , they experience declines in their level of estradiol, a form 
of estrogen produced by [CONTACT_547388]. As such, cognitive changes and 
declines are common complaints during this time in a woman’s life  (Mitchell & Woods, 2011 ). In fact, data 
suggests that nearly half of all postmenopausal women report noticeable symptoms of cognitive decline,

4 
 including difficulties with memory, attention, and concentration. Women also share cognitive complaints during  
the transition itself. And it is  possible the loss of estrogen support at this time is responsible  (Morrison, Brinton, 
Schmidt, & Gore, 2006 ).  
 
One study, published in Neurology, looked specifically at the relationship between  estradiol level and AD. It found 
that women with AD were four to six times more likely  than women without AD  to have est radiol levels less than 
20 pg/mL. This finding  suggest s that estrogen levels decline more significantl y for women in whom AD develops  
(Manly et al., 2000 ). Additional studies have looked at a more general connection between menopause and 
incidence of AD. For instance, a study of [ADDRESS_716047] 
menopausal symptoms demonstrated reduced functional brain connectivity on fMRI  (Vega et al., 2016 ). In 
another study involving more than [ADDRESS_716048] estradiol levels also had bet ter memory performance  (Henderson, Watt, & Galen 
Buckwalter, 1996 ; Tang et al., 1996 ). 
 
In addition to health and biological factors, women tend to experience unique emotional stressors  in late life.  
While the prevalence of anxiety and depression in women is disproportionately higher than in men across the 
lifespan , because women live longer than men, they are at greater risk of losing  their spouse or partner.  
Becoming widowed is a risk factor for decreased physical health and depression (Newson, Boelen, Hek, Hofman, 
& Tiemeier, 2011 ; Wilcox et al., 2003 ), each of which in turn are risk fa ctors for dementia.  In addition, women 
are often the primary caregiver for a person with dementia. Women comprise around 60 percent of Alzheimer’s 
caregivers and a third of female  caregivers care report providing care around the clock. Importantly , nearly 40 
percent of female  caregivers say they had no choice in taking on the role, reporting a perceived lack of control  
which has been identified as an important predictor of  depression. N early half of all female caregivers report high 
physical and em otional stress  (Shriver ). Indeed, research has demonstrated that caregiv ing has a significant 
impact on all levels of physical and mental health, cognition, and well -being , including increased risk for AD.   
 
The unique emotional stressors to which women are exposed in late life may also make women more susceptible 
to cardiovascular events  compared to men . One recent study of women with stable coronary heart disease found 
that women are  more susceptible to mental stress -induced myocardial ischemia  (Vaccarino et al., 2016 ). Another 
study  showed that  women appear to be at greater risk for blood clots under stress than men  due to  greater 
collagen -stimulated platelet aggregation responses after stress  (Samad et al., 2014 ). In this same study, men 
were more likely than women to show changes in traditional physiological markers, such as blood pressure, 
suggesting that this added cardiovascular risk for women may not be captured by [CONTACT_547389].  
 
Proposed I ntervention  
Enhancing cognitive function, especially memory in women with high AD risk (i.e., high cardiovascular risk, 
subjective memory complaints ) may prevent or delay onset of  AD. Numerous studies have observed  that people 
who are physically active are less likely than sedentary persons to experience cognitive decline and dementia in 
later life. Weuve and authors  (Weuve et al., 2004 ) reported that higher levels of physical activity over two years 
was associated with improved cognitive scores  among the 18,766 women enrolled  in the Nurses' Health Study . 
Similarly, Abbott and authors  (Abbott, 2004 ) reported that men who walk at least [ADDRESS_716049] confirmed that physical activity is associated with reduced incidence  of dementia  (Larson et al., 
2006 ; Podewils, 2005 ) and demonstrated an association between physical activity and cognitive function even 
when exercise is limited to later life  (van Gelder et al., 2004 ).

executive function in olde r adults with or without cognitive impairments  (Angevaren, Aufdemkampe, Verhaar, 
Aleman, & Vanhees, 2008 ; P. J. Smith et al., 2010 ; van Uffelen, Chinapaw, van Mechelen, & Hopman -Rock,

general cognitive function, executive function and glucometabolic and hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117] -adrenal axis 
responses  (Baker et al., 2010 ; Lautenschlager et al., 2008 ; Scherder et al., 2005 ; van Uffelen et al., 2008 ).

for AD to  prevent  or delay of con version to dementia in this hig h- risk group.  
 
Background and Rationale:  
A look at current research makes it increasingly clear: the odds are stacked against women when it comes to 
risk for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). With one in six women in her 60s developi[INVESTIGATOR_6237]’s disease, identifying 
effective preventative interventions  is increasingly important. In addition, while modern biomedicine has made 
great strides in defining and understanding disease, the objective characterization of healthy aging, particularly

 among women, remains elusive. Health requires the integration – across multiple time and spatial scales – of 
control systems, feedback loops, and regulatory processes that enable an organism to function and adapt to the 
demands of everyday life. Aging can be associated with progressive multi -system declines, often leadin g to 
decreased physical and cognitive function and reduced adaptability to stress  (J. D. Lipsitz, Gur, Albano, & 
Sherman, 2011 ; L. A. Lipsitz, 2006 ). Because of the complex nature of aging processes, present reductionistic 
methods may not be adequate for defining good health or heal thy aging. Due to its capacity to characterize 
complex dynamics within and between physiological systems, the emerging field of complex systems biology 
and its array of quantitative tools show great promise for improving our understanding of aging, monitor ing 
senescence, and providing biomarkers for evaluating novel interventions, including traditional mind –body 
exercises, that treat age -related disease and promote healthy aging  (Goldberger, 2006 ). 
 
Aging, cognition, and the use of mind -body interventions for prevention of cognitive decline in women.  
The general consensus that cognitive abilities decline with advancing age is supported by [CONTACT_547391]  (Prakash et al., 2012 ). These differences appear to be particularly large for tests that 
emphasize executive functioning, as well as speed of response and attention  (Salthouse, 1996 ; West, 1996 ). To 
date, preventive measures against this cognitive decline have been mainly focused on dietary  (Hughes et al., 
2010 ; Krikorian et al., 2010 ; Scarmeas, Stern, Tang, Mayeux, & Luchsinger, 2006 ), physical  (Colcombe et al., 
2004 ; Kramer & Erickson, 2007 ), and lifestyle  (Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, & Dixon, 1999 ; Lövdén, Ghisletta, & 
Lindenberger, 2005 ) behaviors which may increase the ability of adults to maintain their cognitive abilities into 
late life. However, little research has focused on evaluating mind -body interventions such as yoga and 
meditation. In the current study, we extend upon observational research demonstrati ng superior cognitive 
performance in yogic meditators vs. non -meditators . 
 
Intervention s such  as yoga and meditation are multi -component mind -body exercise s grounded in the holistic 
model of traditional Indian and Ayurvedic medicine. The explicit goals of targeting multiple physiological and 
cognitive processes and integrating their dynamics make yoga and meditation particularly well -suited for 
evaluating the  effects on an intervention designed to enhance healthy aging within a systems biology framework. 
Prakash and colleagues  (2011) demonstrated in a cross -sectional study comparing the cognitive performance 
of medi tators ( N=20) and non -medi tators ( N=20)  older than 55 years old, using  six neuropsychological tests for 
assessment of short -term memory, perceptual speed, attention, and executive functioning  (Prakash et al., 2012 ). 
Vihangam Yoga meditators showed significantly better performances in all tests of attention ( p< .05) except for 
the digit backward test, where a trend ( p = .08)  was observed  compared to non -meditators .[ADDRESS_716051] cognitive benefit of m editation 
compared to relaxation  (Black et al., 2013 ; Lavretsky et al., 2013b ; Pomykala et al., 2012 ). Moss et al (2012)  
also used an 8 -week 12 minute a day Kirtan Kriya  meditation program in 15 older subjects with memory problems  
(Moss et al., 2012 ; A. B. Newberg, Wintering, Khalsa, Roggenkamp, & Waldman, 2010 ). The meditation training 
program resulted in notable improvement trends in mood, anxiety, tension, and fatigue, with some parameters 
reaching statistical significance. All major trends correlated with changes in cerebral blood flow ( CBF). These 
preliminary efforts point toward potential of using yoga and meditation as cognition enhancing interventions for 
women who are at high risk for AD.  
 
Kundalini yoga (KY) and Kirtan Kriya (KK) yogic meditation:  Kundalini Yoga is a mind -body intervention that 
has been t ested in several studies investigating effects on physical and mental health outcomes  (Khalsa, Khalsa, 
Khalsa, & K halsa, 2008 ; Krisanaprakornkit, Pi[INVESTIGATOR_547341], Kirkwood, Krisanaprakornkit, & Laopaiboon, 2004 ; 
Lynton, Kligler, & Shiflett, 2007 ; Pagnoni & Cekic, 2007 ; Shannahoff -Khalsa, 2004 , 2005 ). Kirtan Kriya (KK) has 
been studied in older adults with memory complaints  (Khalsa et al., 2008 ; Moss et al., 2012 ; A. B. Newberg et 
al., 2010 ). Our previous RCT  demonstrated  a significant effect of KK +KY on cognit ion and depression, 
suggesting that this is a useful approach that may be readily incorporat ed into future clinical practice  (Pagnoni & 
Cekic, 2007 ). KY and KK have  also been demonstrated to increase  regional brain blood flow  (Eyre et al., 2017 ; 
A. B. Newberg et al., 2010 ).

 Memory Enhancement  Training (MET):  Memory training is based on the notion that cognition is plastic in older 
age (A. Acevedo & Loewenstein, 2007 ). Traditional memory training interventions facilitate plasticity by [CONTACT_547392]  (Gross et al., 2012 ; Verhaeghen, Marcoen, & Goossens, 1992 ). A meta -analysis of 33 
clinical trials including data from over 1,500 older adults showed that gains on objective memory tests following 
memory training are large (i.e. on average, a standardized mean difference from pretest to posttest of  .73) 
compared to  the small -medium sized effects for  control (.37) and place bo (.38) conditions. A more recent meta -
analysis  (Gross et al., 2012 ) of [ADDRESS_716052] size  (the mean standardized difference in pre -post change 
between memory -trained and control groups)  was 0.[ADDRESS_716053]  deviations (SD);  the pre -post training effect for 
memory -trained interventions was 0.[ADDRESS_716054] for control groups was 0.06 SD.  Effective 
mnemonic memory enhancement methods involved visual imagery, verbal associations, story mnemonics, 
organizational encoding strategies, and the use of multiple techniques, and no specific strategy is better  than 
another  (Bjorklund, Schneider, Cassel, & Ashley, 1994 ; Gross et al., 2012 ; Stigsdotter & Bäckman, 1989 ; 
Verhaeghen et al., 1992 ; Willis et al., 2006 ). Benefits from memory training may last from six months to five years  
(Verhaeghen et al., 1992 ; Willis et al., 2006 ). Memory training can transfer to daily life when participants are 
given homework practice and  training in using techniques in daily life and novel situations  (McDaniel & Bugg, 
2012 ). Small group interventions, memory education, and relatively short sessions (e.g. 90 minutes or less) are 
other important components of training programs  (Verhaeghen et al., 1992 ). Memory training also improves 
subjective memory functioning but effect sizes are smaller (. 30) compared  to the effect on objective test 
performance  (Floyd & Scogin, 1997 ). We chose to implement mnemonic methods over computerized memory 
training programs because the for mer have a longer history of implementation in aging populations  and have 
more  empi[INVESTIGATOR_547342] . The MET program in the current proposal includes 
evidence -based techniques and approaches to facilitate transfer of new knowledge to participants’ everyday 
lives. 
 
Telomerase as a biomarker of stress in women with high AD risk: Telomere length  (TL) has recently been 
proposed as a useful ‘psychobiomarker’ linking stress and disease  (E. Epel, Daubenmier, Moskowitz, Folkman, 
& Blackburn, 2009 ). Shortened TL and reduced telomerase (the cellular enzyme primarily responsible for 
telomere length and maintenance) predict a host of health risks and conditions  (Blackburn, 2000 ; E. S. Epel et 
al., 2004 ; Serrano, 2004 ), and new findings suggest they may be regulated in part by [CONTACT_325837], stress 
appraisals, and well -being  (E. Epel et al., 2009 ; E. S. Epel et al., 2004 ; Ornish et al., 2008 ). Prolonged 
psychological stress and depression are also likely to affect telomerase activity, considered a predictor of long -
term cellular viability  (E. S. Epel et al., 2004 ). For women in particular, recent stressors (such as the death of a 
partner, or ongoing caregiver -related distress), may have a strong  impact on TL. One study (Putterman et al, 
2015) which followed women over the period of one year found an incremental impact of stress on TL, such that 
for every major life stressor, there was a significantly greater decline in TL. In addition, this study found that 
health behaviors moderated this relationship, such that women who maintained higher levels of health behaviors 
appeared to be protected when exposed to stress. In addition, a recent study  (Jacobs et al., 2011 ) linked 
meditation and positive psychological change t o increased telomerase activity, suggesting improvement in TL 
and immune cell longevity. Additionally, our study of yogic meditation in caregivers over [ADDRESS_716055] of MET versus 
KK+KY for women who are at high risk for AD. Our behavioral interventions may also offer benefits of reducing 
polypharmacy , improv ing physical health, and increasing global  well-being . We will investigate whether our 
interventions  affect  fMRI and cellular biomarkers  of stress , inflammation  and long -term cellular viability . 
Determining the mechanisms of response to KK+ KY may easily translate into community care especially 
designed for older women.

 Memory Enhancement Training  (MET): As observed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]  (K. J. Miller et al., 2012 ), MET appears 
broadly beneficial for enhancing memory function in older adults with memory complaints and associated 
symptoms, and may readily be incorporated into future clinical practice . MET was well accepted by [CONTACT_547393] . 
 
Image acquisition and analysis:  We will employ advanced multimodal imaging methods to identify 
neuro imaging markers linked with disease and treatment outcome to KK+KY. Imag ing data will be obtained on 
a Siemens 3T Prisma system using MRI sequences adapted from the NIH -sponsored Human Connectome 
Project (https://www.humanconnectome.org) designed for optimal trade -offs between acquisition time, spatial 
and temporal resolution, where each modality provides unique and complementary information to better evaluat e 
the neurobiological bases of treatment response. Further, we will apply advanced and innovative computational 
image analysis approaches for integrating data in a novel way , focusing on the aging of the female brain, 
cognitive decline  and plasticity, asso ciations with biomarkers of stress and cognition , and the application of 
resting state fMRI to examine changes in functional connectivity. The application of a comprehensive imaging 
protocol and biomarkers of stress/inflammation for evaluating treatment re sponse may not only advance 
understanding of the unique mechanisms underlying high AD prevalence among women and intervention -based  
brain plasticity, but have substantial future impact on clinical practice by [CONTACT_547394].   
 
Timeliness : The use of integrative medicine interventions will be shortly “in -demand” and highly beneficial for 
the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_547343] “baby -boomers,” most of whom are women (US Census Current 
Population Report -Baby [CONTACT_547395], [ADDRESS_716056] that KK+KY  may be well received in this population . Determining the efficacy of such 
interventions for improving cognitive performance in older women  at high risk for A D is a research priority.  
 
B. Approach.  
Overview: This proposal incorporates a multidisciplinary investigative team from several centers at UCLA 
includ ing the Semel Institute ([CONTACT_547428], PI), the Brain Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_547344]  ([CONTACT_547429]), and statistical expertise of 
other co -investigators from the UCLA Semel Institute ([CONTACT_547430] ). Below, we have incorporated preliminary 
data in areas germane to the proposed project : 1) cognition ; 2) physical functioning ; 3) inflammation; and 4) an 
fMRI study of the effects of KK in older stressed dementia caregivers.  
 
Preliminary data:  
1. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_547345], increased efficiency of brain metabolism, and 
decrease d gene expression in the inflammatory pathways compared to relaxation in dementia caregivers 
with mild depressive symptoms. In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_110307] 49 depressed family dementia 
caregivers (mean age 60.3 years  (SD=10.2)), 39 completed either KK meditation or listening to relaxation music 
for 12 minutes per day for 8 weeks.  Severity of insomnia, depressive and anxiety symptoms, caregiver burden, 
and copi[INVESTIGATOR_547346] t he study. The mean HAMD score at baseline was 
11.6 (SD=4.1). Telomerase activity was examined in the monocytes before and after the study (Fig 2). Post-
treatment, groups significantly differed on the health functioning outcomes (i.e., SF -36 role emotional and energy 
scale scores), global cognitive measure (MMSE) and measures of attention and executive function (Trails A/B) 
(p<.05), which was associated with decreased FDG -PET brain metabolism in right inferior frontal lobe (Fig 3).

 Table 1. Intervention effects in the meditation and relaxation 
study groups.  
 
Improvement in copi[INVESTIGATOR_547347] (43%) 
compared the relaxation group (8%), which was significant after controlling for age and the duration of stress 
(p=0.03 ) (Fig 2). We also performed genome -wide transcriptional profiling in PBMC samples (microarrays) and 
observed the pattern of increased NF -kappa -B-related transcription of pro -inflammatory cytokines and 
decreased IRF -related transcription of innate antivira l response genes. These findings suggest that KK can lead 
to improved copi[INVESTIGATOR_547348] a relaxation  intervention in distressed and mildly depressed 
caregivers . In addition, this effect was accompanied by [CONTACT_547396] e, down -regulation of 
inflammatory signaling pathways and cellular aging, and decreased FDG -PET brain metabolism in right inferior 
frontal lobe  (Lavretsky et al., 2013a ). Based on our experience with scheduling follow up with caregivers in the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], the emphasis will be on homework meditation time with additional 60 minute yoga classes provided 
weekly.  
 
2. A randomized trial of Kundalini yoga in mild cognitive 
impairment.  In our study investigat ing the effects of Kundalini yoga 
(KY) training , we randomized older participants (≥55 years of age) with  
MCI to 12 week s of either  KY or MET . Cognitive (i.e. memory  and 
executive functioning) and mood (i.e. self-reported measures of 
depression, apathy, and resilience) assessments were administered at 
baseline, 12 weeks and 24 weeks.  No significant baseline group 
differences  were observed  in clinical or demographic characteristics. At 
12 weeks and 24 weeks, both KY and MET groups showed significant 
improvement in memory; however, only KY showed significant 
improvement in executive functioning. Further, only the KY group 
showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms and 
resilience (at week 12 ).

We also explored the relationship between performance on  memory tests and resting -state functional 
connectivity before and after KY vs . MET . Resting -state  (rs-) fMRI  was used to map correlations between brain 
networks and memory performance changes over time. Default mode networks (DMN), language and superior 
parietal networks were chosen as networks of interest to analyze the association with changes in verbal and 
visuospatial memory performance. Fourteen KY and 11 MET participants completed the rs -fMRI portion of the 
study. We observed improved verbal memory performance correlated with increased connectivity between the 
DMN and frontal medial cortex, pregenual anteri or cingulate cortex, right middle frontal cortex, posterior cingulate 
cortex, and left lateral occipi[INVESTIGATOR_96067]  (see figure on right ). Improved verbal memory performance positively 
correlated with increased connectivity between the language processing netw ork and the left inferior frontal 
gyrus. Improved visuospatial memory performance correlated inversely with connectivity between the superior

 parietal network and the medial parietal cortex. Thus KY may be as effective as MET in improving functional 
connec tivity in relation to verbal memory performance.   
 
Study Design:  
a) Rationale for duration of interventions  and follow up:  
We propose a randomized controlled design for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 12 -week trial of the behavioral intervention MET 
compared to KK+KY for improving cognitive performance and health in women at high risk of AD. We hope to 
control for nonspecific factors by [CONTACT_2329] a gold standard active control condition that has demonstrated 
acceptability in this population.  
The proposed study will to tes t whether KK+KY is superior to MET for improving cognitive functioning, health 
(including cardiovascular factors), and mood in women with high AD risk.  All participants will be recruited from 
the UCLA Women’s Cardiovascular Center, UCLA outpatient clinics and the UCLA Longevity Center Program. 
All participants will be identified as having high AD risk including subjective memory complaints  and high 
cardio vascular risk based on the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk  (Goff et 
al., 2014 ). Follow up of  all enrolled subjects at  6- and 12-months  (52 weeks total) will allow detection of any 
continued cognitive or health benefits.  
 
b) Methods for reducing risk of bias:  
Participants  will be informed  prior to enrol lment  that they will receive one of two evidence -based interventions 
for improving memory. Descriptions of the study will be designed to minimize risk of possible between group 
differences resulting from differences in treatment expectancy . Differences in  treatment expectancy / credibility  
will be tested  for at baseline, week 12 , and week 24 as specified below. We will also control for the “instructor” 
effect if several instructors teach classes. The feasibility of weekly yoga/MET classes and homework time was 
assessed during previous studies and found reasonable for participants to complete  (Eyre et al., 2016 ; H. Yang 
et al., 2016 ). Behavioral raters will be blind to group assignment.  
 
1. Study Population:  We anticipate screening about 250 subjects to recruit 100 women with  subjective memory 
complaints  and high cardiovascular risk based on the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of 
Cardiovascular Risk. Participants  will be recruited from the women’s clinics  and geriatric clinics at UCLA  as well 
as the UCLA Longevity Center . 
Screening Procedures:  Potential participants will receive a telephone screening .. Only participants who are 
naïve to Kundalini Yoga and Kirtan Kriya or who have not practiced in the past year  will be included in the study. 
Only participants currently not taking psychotropic medications prior to the initiation of the study will be enrolled. 
A research coordinato r will assist with recruitment, screening, and scheduling . 
 
A member of  the research team  will obtain informed consent from participants  prior to the in -person screening . 
The in -person screening will include a questionnaire to collect demographic information, medications and 
medical  and reproductive  history. A physical exam a nd ECG for screening purposes will also take place at this 
time.  
 
The baseline visit will include  neuropsychiatric and physical examinat ions and laboratory tests . Though eligibility 
will be assessed at baseline, participation may be terminated if the subj ect stops meeting entry criteria.  Dementia 
is an exclusion criterion. We will screen for possible incipi[INVESTIGATOR_547349]. This will include reviewing an extensive history and mental status exam together with 
corroborating information with regard to functional skills. A MMSE s core of < 23 or an established dementia 
diagnosis will mandate exclusion. The evaluation for dementia includes: 1) an interview by a trained study staff 
to identify physical and cognitive limitations; 2) a standard battery of hematologic studies; 3) neurop sychological 
examination (detailed below); and 4) psychiatric evaluation as detailed above. Adjudication of dementia is based 
on DSM -5 criteria  (Knopman et al., 2001 ; Lyketsos et al., 2002 ).

in MET, which involves reading and writing and has a Flesch -Kinkaid school equivalency of 7th grade ) 
4) Capacity to provide informed consent  
 
Exclusion criteria  are: 
1) History of psychosis, bipolar disorder, alcohol/ drug dependence , or neurological disorder  
2) Clinically significant depressive symptoms as indicated by a BDI score  >17 
3) Recent (within three months) surgery, anticipated surgery within next year, or unstable medical condition  
4) Any disabilit y preventing participation in MET or KK+KY (e.g., severe visual or hearing impairment)  
5) Insufficient English proficiency  to participate in either MET or KK+KY  
6) Diagnosis of dementia  
7) Mini Menta l Health Examination score of 23  or below  
8) Currently taking any p sychoactive medication  (stable on antidepressant and not currently depressed is OK)  
9) Participation in a psychotherapy that  involves cognitive training  
10) Current yoga practice (frequency of once/week or greater)  
11) Myocardial Infarction within  the past [ADDRESS_716057] that demented patients will be referred for enrollment because 
referring physicians will be told that dementia is an exclusion criteria . However, in the course of screening, those 
with a Mini -Mental State Examination score of < 23 or an es tablished dementia diagnosis  will be excluded . 
Adjudication of dementia is based on DSM -5 criteria, as recommended  by [CONTACT_547398] (Knopman et 
al., 2001 ) as wel l as Lyketsos and authors (Lyketsos et al., 2002 ).  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_257333] a consensus conference  in 
cases where eligibility is unclear , where additional information will be reviewed. At the consensus conference, 
additional information will be reviewed (e.g., colla teral information, family history, drug use). If there are clinical 
features suggestive of dementia, the patients will be referred back to their primary care doctors . We will screen 
for possible incipi[INVESTIGATOR_547350], as verified by [INVESTIGATOR_124181]. This will inc lude reviewing an extensive history and 
mental status exam together with corroborating information with regard to functional skills. The evaluation for 
dementia includes: (1) an interview by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lavretsky or [CONTACT_547431] to identify cognitive limitations; (2 ) neurological 
examination (UPDRS); and (3) memory screening using two neuropsychological tests, as detailed below . 
Adjudication of dementia is based on DSM -5 criteria  (Knopman et al., 2001 ; Lyketsos et al., 2002 ).  If a diagnosis 
of dementia  is discovered , we will refer subjects to the appropriate clinics for dementia care (i.e. geriatric 
psychiatry and Alzheimer's Disease Center at UCLA ). We will offer to discuss the diagnosis with pat ients and 
their families, and will offer to discuss this with their physicians.    
 
Screening for MCI. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to explore whether the efficacy of our interventions is

 significantly different in those participants MCI vs. those with only subjective memory  complaints. MCI will be 
defined as follows:  
 Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score of .5 , OR 
 MMSE score greater than 1 SD below age and education -corrected norms (Crum, Anthony, Bassett, & 
Folstein, 1993 ), OR 
 MMSE score equal to [ADDRESS_716058] one of the items missed 
is a memory item  
 
Measures and Outcomes: All instruments provide a comprehensive assessment of cognition, mood, quality of 
life, well -being, mindfulness  and resilience. Diagnosis will be determined on study entry. All outcome measures 
will be administered at baseline, week 12, and [ADDRESS_716059] -Revised (HVLT -R)(Benedict, Schretlen, Groninger, & Brandt, 1998 ) delayed 
recall  will be administered at baseline to identify memory impairment.   
 
The Beck Depression Inventory  will be used to rule out current clinically -significant depressive symptoms.  
 
Inter-rater reliability for all instruments will be established at the beginning of the trial. Drs. Lavretsky and Ercoli 
will administer clinician -administered  instruments and will be trained to reliability (current inter -rater correlation 
coefficient (ICC) ≥ 0.9.).  
 
Assessment : Memory performance  as determined by [CONTACT_547399]  (described below) is  the 
primary outcome  of interest. Behavioral outcome assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_547400] .

 outcome will be an average of the participant’s z -scores on three tests. Two of these tests will be of 
verbal memory tests: 1) the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT) (total and delayed recall scores) 
(Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_70040]., 1999),  and (2) the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS -IV) (immediate and delayed)  and one will 
be of visual memory (the Rey -Osterreith Complex Figure 3 -minute delay recall)  . The secondary outcome 
measure of executive functioning will include Trail Making B and Stroop Color -Word Interference tests to 
estimate mental flexibility and inhibition/adjustment of behavior . Tests of language fluency will include Animal 
fluency and  CFL Letter Fluency to  assess strategic searching/organization of verbal knowledge , as well as the 
Bosto n Naming Test.  The battery will also include measures of attention/ processing speed  which are commonly 
impaired in the geriatric population according to prior research by [CONTACT_27156] (Schneider, Ercoli, Siddarth, & 
Lavretsky, 2012 ) and others  (Alexopoulos, Kiosses, Klimstra, Kalayam, & Bruce, 2002 ; Bhalla et al., 2009 ; 
Butters, 2004 ; Favrod et al., 2015 ; Lockwood, Alexopoulos, & van Gorp, 2002 ). These tests  place significant 
demand on mental operations that require speed, manipulation and monitoring of information that is in conscious 
awareness (T rail Making A ; Digit Span; Stroop Color and Word ). Most of the measures have 2 or 4 alternate 
forms so that unique forms may be administered to participants during repeat testing.  We include both traditional, 
standardized tests and computerized tests for e nhanced sensitivity of the battery to potential intervention effects 
and so that our results can also be compared with other findings in the literature. In addition to the cognitive 
outcome measures, we will include the TOPF  to estimate pre -morbid cognitive functioning.  
 
Secondary clinical outcome measures  will include the Clinical Global Impression - Severity and Improvement 
scale (CGI) (Busner, Targum, & Miller, 2009 ) to quantify overall severity and clinical im provement over time (2 
min). Subjective memory complaints will be assessed via the 10 -item Memory Functioning Questionnaire  scale. 
The Beck Depression Inventory  (BDI) (Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996 ; Beck, Steer, & Carbin, 1988 ), a self -
assessment scale of depression (5 min) , will also be administered , as will the Hamilton Anxiety scale.  
 
Perceived stress will be assessed via the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) , a validated measure of the degree to 
which situations in one’s life are appraised as stressful (5 min) (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1994 ).   
 
Resilience : the Connor -Davidson Resilience scale (CD -RISC) , a measure of resilience (Connor & Davidson, 
2003 )(5 min)  will be administered . We previously administered this measure in a sample of 337 adults over the 
age of 60 years; exploratory factor analyses identified the following four factors: grit, active copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -efficacy, 
accommodative copi[INVESTIGATOR_52497] -efficacy, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_25824].  
 
Emotion regulation  will be assessed via the 15-item Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) which is  
design ed to assess open or receptive awareness of and attention to what is taking place in the present (Brown, 
2003) , as well as a 5-item measure of self -kindness  (Neff, 2003 ) and a 6-item measure of rumination  (Trapnell 
& Campbell, 1999 ), both of which were found to significantly mediate the effects of 
6week  mindfulness  intervention on depressive symptoms (Boyle, Stanton, Ganz, Crespi, & Bower, 2017 ) (5 
min).  
 
Health -Related quality of life will be determined using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 -Item Health 
Survey (SF -36) (Ware & Gandek, 1994 ), which comprises 8 scales: physical func tioning, role limitations – 
physical, role limitations – emotional, energy, emotional well -being, social functioning, pain, and general health 
(15 min).  
 
The 11-item Duke  Social Support Scale (Koenig et al., 1993 ) will be used to assess subjective support (7 -item 
Subjective Support Subscale) and objective support (4 -item Social Interaction Subscale). Both subjective and 
objective social support have been associated with mental and physical health symptoms (sleep disturbance, 
depressive symptoms, and fatigue) in older adults (Choi, Irwin, & Cho, 2015 ). Existing research evidence 
suggests that yoga increases oxytocin (Jayaram et al., 2013 ); thus, it might be reasonable to expect that women 
assigned to yoga may experience greater decreases in subjective social isolation than women assigned to MET.

 Behavioral regulation/ impulsivity will be assessed via an abbreviated (9 -item) version of the Monetary Choice 
Questionnaire developed by [CONTACT_547401] (Kirby & Maraković, 1995 ). Because yoga is proposed to 
increase self -regulation, we expect that the yoga group will improve on this measure to a greater extent than the 
MET group. A recent study found that older adults with MCI showed significantly greater delay discounting than 
healthy controls at the small reward magnitude, leading the authors to propose de lay discounting as a candidate 
marker for early dementia  (Lindbergh, Puente, Gray, Mackillop, & Miller, 2014 ). Because these results were on ly 
significant at the small reward magnitudes, we are only using the small reward  magnitude items (i.e., items for 
which the delayed reward is less than or equal to $35).  
 
Measures of medical comorbidity . Comprehensive assessment of vascular and nonvascular medical burden 
will be provided using screening ECG and medical assessments and the review of medical documentation and  
will include the Stroke Risk Factor Prediction Chart (SRF) (Ho et al., 1993 ; Truelsen  et al., 1994 ) of the American 
Heart Association for rating cerebrovascular risk factors (5 min). This scale incorporates eight independent 
measures; age, presence and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, smoking, coronary vascular disease, atrial 
fibrillation and left ventricular hypertrophy and provides a score indicating overall risk for cerebrovascular disease 
and stroke. The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale -Geriatric (CIRS -G)(Salvi et al., 2008 ) is used for rating the 
severity of chronic medical illness and burden in 14 organ -systems (15 min).  
Family History of Dementia . Because family history of dementia is a known risk factor, this will be assessed in 
the form of a yes/ no question during the i n-person screening. This variable will be added as a covariate and 
investigated as a possible moderator of treatment effects.  
 
Physical Activity and Meditation Practice. Degree o f physical activity and meditation practice will be assessed 
and used as covariates in analyses of treatment effects . For physical activity assessment, we will be using the 
short International Physical Activity Questionnaire modified for the elderly (IPAQ -E) (Hurtig -Wennlöf, 
Hagströmer, & Olsson, 2010 ).  
 
Pain  will be assessed via the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form, a validated scale for rapi[INVESTIGATOR_547351] (Cleeland, 1989 ).  
 
Safety Evaluations:  All participants  will be interviewed about their recent history of psychiatric and medical 
illnesses, psychosocial stressors, and current medications. We will use the [LOCATION_006]U Side Effect Rating Scale  
(Lingjærde, Ahlfors, Bech, Dencker, & Elgen, 1987 ), a rating scale for monitoring adverse events which will  be 
completed at each assessment visit.

 Microarray -based genome -wide transcriptional analyses  will be used identify the molecular inflammation -related 
signaling pathways that are plausible candidates for molecular mediators of inflammation (e.g., NF -B) (Cole, 
2010 ; Irwin, Olmstead, & Motivala, 2008 ; Irwin, Wang, Campomayor, Collado -Hidalgo, & Cole, 2006 ) and 
glucocorticoid receptor -related signaling 
pathways that may underlie increa sed 
inflammatory signaling  (Cole et al., 2007 ; 
G. E. Miller et al., 2008 ) with measures 
performed at baseline, week 1 2, and at 6-
mont hs, as described previously  (Cole et 
al., 2007 ; G. E. Miller et al., 2008 ). 
Expression data will be subject to quantile 
normalization, with differentially expressed 
genes identified based on False Discovery 
Rate analyses controlling false positive 
errors at 5%, and subsequent TELiS 
bioinformatic s analysis of GR target motifs 
within the promoters of genes up -regulated 
in KK+KY vs. MET . Confirmatory RT -PCR 
analyses will be conducted on a subset of 
12 differentially expressed transcripts to 
confirm microarray indications  (Cole et al., 
2007 ; G. E. Miller et al., 2008 ). We will 
assess the activity of telomerase  level 
and TL  at baseline , weeks 1 2 and 6-
month  follow -up to monitor changes. The 
protocol will be the same as the one used 
previously by [CONTACT_186923]  
(Jacobs e t al., 2011 ). Quantification of 
telomerase activity will be measured from 
the extract using the telomeric repeat 
amplification protocol (TRAP) as 
previously described  (Kim & Wu, 1997 ) 
with a commercial kit (TRAPeze®, 
Chemicon, Temecula, CA). We will assess 
other factors related to inflammation  
during our baseline assessment and 
throughout the trial ( e.g., alcohol, smoking, 
BMI, physical activity; use of NSAIDs, and 
recent infections when samples are 
collected).  This will require 8 tables poons of blood to be drawn at 3 time points  (baseline, 12 weeks, and 6 -month 
follow up) .  
 
Imaging Biomarkers:  Imaging data will be acquired from each subject at baseline and at [ADDRESS_716062] 
60 minutes and include 1)  high-resolution T1 - and T2 weighted structural scans (0.8 mm3 voxel size) using 
protocols developed for the Human Connectome Project ( HCP ) Lifespan Project (www.humanconnectome.org ), 
which will be used for registration and to measure morphometric features as may be included as covariates and 
used for the detection and quantification of WMHs and  CSF; and 2 ) three separate multiband EPI [INVESTIGATOR_547352] s patial (2 mm3) and temporal (TR: 720 ms) resol ution and anterior -posterior/ posterior -anterior 
(AP/PA ) phase encoding to correct for anatomic distortions for the acquisition of rs- and task -related fMRI data

[ADDRESS_716063] with reduced distortion  (van der Kouwe, Benner, Salat, & Fischl, 2008 ). 
 
Functional Imaging:  Analysis of rs -fMRI data will determine whether KK+KY leads to plasticity in brain network 
activity . To address our hypothesi s that KK+KY versus MET will result in improved executive functioning (working 
memory) we will employ the N -back  task. During resting periods and tasks, we will also assess physiological 
measures, including respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (respi[INVESTIGATOR_547354]), GSR (electrodes on the hand), heart 
rate (pulse -ox), and end -tidal CO2 (nasal cannula).  
 
Working Memory Task.  We w ill use a well -established 2 -back versio n of the N -back task detailed by  [CONTACT_547403] (Barch, Burgess, Harms, Petersen, Schla ggar, Corbetta, Glasser, Curtiss, Dixit, & Feldt, 2013 ) 
to elicit neural activation linked with working memory. Participants indicate whether a stimulus presented in  the 
center of the screen is the same or different from the stimulus two trials ago.  Button presses record accuracy 
and resp onse time. This task elicits  activation in lateral fronto -parietal cortex and anterior cingulate (ACC)  
(Barch, Burgess, Harms, Peterse n, Schlaggar, Corbetta, Glasser, Curtiss, Dixit, Feldt, et al., 2013 ), regions 
implicated in emotion regulation and cognitive control. Though emotion regulation is not directly assessed in 
this task, activated regions may nevertheless be used as seed regions or reference points for subsequent 
connectivity analyses.  
 
Face -name [CONTACT_547424]. This task is a paired -associates memory task  assessing verbal and 
non-verbal memory (Zeineh, Engel, Thompson, & Bookheimer, 2003 ). A sequence of faces is presented on the 
screen together with names. Participants are asked to encode the names of the different face identities in a study 
period  and mentally recal l them in later blocks. During the recall blocks, each face is present ed together with a 
name. The subject  is asked to indicate by [CONTACT_7326] a button whether the association of face and name [CONTACT_547425] a novel pairing. Both  encoding - 
and retrieval -related neural processes  can be investigated using fMRI  (Klamer et al., 2017 ).  
 
Breath Counting Task.  The breath counting task will be used to assess interoceptive attention. During this task, 
participants are instructed to attend to their breathing by [CONTACT_547404] a one -minute 
timeframe. The accuracy of the report has been used as an indicator of interoceptive attention {Herrero, 2017 
#3478}. This task will involve [ADDRESS_716064] found that greater accuracy 
during interoceptive tasks is associated with increased activity in the right anterior in sular/ opercular cortex  
{Critchley, 2004 #3514}.  
 
Resting State -fMRI:  During acquisition of rsfMRI data, participants  will be asked to remain awake with their 
eyes open, viewing a static fixation cross . Though resting state connectivity is highly reproducible over time in 
healthy participants  (Damoiseaux et al., 2006 ), experience -based neural plasticity in resting state connectivity 
has been shown to occur over periods as short as 2 -9 days. To measure cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_32713], a 
pulse oximeter and respi[INVESTIGATOR_547355] f MRI sessions . Non-neuronal 
physiological artefacts (including cardiac and respi[INVESTIGATOR_229857]) will be eliminated.  
 
Preprocessing and Analysis:  Preprocessing of all fMRI data will follow similar workflows using adapted HCP 
minimal processing pi[INVESTIGATOR_32042] (www.humanconnectome.org ). Specifically, preprocessing steps incorporating FSL  
(Jenkinson, Beckmann, Behrens, Woolrich, & Smith, 2012 ; S. M. Smith et al., 2004 ; Woolrich et al., 2009 ) and 
custom processing module s will include: a) removal of non -brain tissue; b) rigid -body head motion correction; c) 
spatial smoothing (5 -6 mm FWHM); d) demising and high pass filtering using FSL’s MELODIC; and d) co -
registration of  the BOLD and T1 images using the matched bandwidth EPI [INVESTIGATOR_547356]. 
First-level analysis will include the modeling of activation between task conditions (e.g. 0-back vs. 2 -back) . 
Temporal derivatives and the [ADDRESS_716065] to improve 
statistical sensitivity . Second -level (fixed effects) and third -level (mixed effects) analyses will average runs within 
participants  and between groups, respectively . Longitudinal analysis:  In addition to subtracting changes in 
Reducing Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease in High -Risk Women through Yogic Meditation Training  
Principal Investigator (PI): Helen Lavretsky, M.D., M.S.  
 
[ADDRESS_716066] the structural 
template, to determine the effects of structural change, functional change, and their interaction. One sample t -
tests will determine whether  activation for each individual changes significantly over time. Task -related 
connectivity analysis : To investigate effective “functional” connectivity, we will determine differences in task -
dependent functional connectivity between regions -of-interest (ROIs). Using seeds for the hippocampus, ACC 
and DLPFC, w e will investigate within -ROI activity and seed -based connectivity across the brain for working 
memory load compared to no load (2 -back vs. 0 -back). Similarly, we will contrast ROI activity and functional 
connectivity of learned with novel  face-name [CONTACT_547426]. Additionally, encoding -related activity/connec tivity will 
be investigated while subjects study face -name [CONTACT_188234]. Group -level FSL FEAT analyses will produce statistical 
maps indicating voxels throughout the brain showing significantly correlated task -dependent activity with the 
ROI. Regressors include t he ROI (e.g., hippocampus  activity), the cognitive  variable ( 0-back vs. 2 -back  condition  
and learned vs. novel face -name [CONTACT_547426] ), and their interaction. Higher -level analyses will determine the 
degree of functional coupling among treatment groups. Resting state analysis:  After applying preprocessing 
steps similar to the described above, widely documented independent components analysis (ICA)  (De Luca, 
Beckmann, De Stefano, Matthews, & Smith, 2006 ; Greicius et al., 2007 ) using FSL’s MELODIC , will estimate 
the optimal number of components for each subject and to 
remove components 
representing artifacts. 
After low pass filtering 
(0.1-0.01 Hz) and 
transformation into 
atlas space, the best -
fit DMN, executive and 
salience , and fronto -
parietal and  dorsal attention networks implicated in working 
memory and cognitive attention  network components for a 
subject will be selected for higher -level group analysis. We will 
explore components of other networks (Damoiseaux et al., 2006 ; 
De Luca et al., 2006 ). We will also examine voxel correlation 
within particular networks in follow -up analyses of ROIs (Bluhm 
et al., 2009 ; Di Martino et al., 2008 ; Greicius et al., 2007 ). 
Changes in functional connectivity will be quantified by 
[CONTACT_547405] z -transf ormed correlation coefficients between 
ROIs.

Structural Imaging . Structural image analysis will incorporate methods refined and validated by [CONTACT_402755] -
investigators and include: 1) volumetric/cortical thickness analysis using automated and manual segmentation, 
and 2) refined shape/surface structure analyses. In brief,  widely used freesurfer 
(http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ) processing streams that include a) correction for magnetic field 
inhomogeneities; b) removal of non -brain tissue; c) tissue segmentation; d) sep aration of the hemispheres and 
subcortical structures; e) extraction of the white/gray and pi[INVESTIGATOR_547357] f) initial segmentation of  cortical 
and subcortical ROIs (with manual correction of errors , Figure 7 A ) will be used to estimate regional t issue 
volumes for comparison across treatment groups and time. These analyses will be followed by [CONTACT_547406]/surface structure of the hippocampus and other 
ROIs  as informed by [CONTACT_547407] (see below). Procedures include manual segmentation and the use 
of surface -based mesh modeling and skeletonization methods that have been used to assess local changes in 
the morphology of the hippocampus, the ACC, and  others in the fronto -striatal -limbic system  (e.g. amygdala, 
striatum , DLPFC) and  in several clinical groups including and across time in our prior studies (Ballmaier et al., Figure  6.

Diffusion tensor imaging : The acquisition of DTI data will be used to measure structural connectivity of white 
matter within  brain networks relating to emotion regulation and stress. We will use HARDI (High Angular 
Resolution Diffusion Imaging) with anterior -posterior and posterior -anterior phase encodi ng and 2 different b -
values (1500 and 3000) to correct for  anatomic distortion and provide greater precision for mappi[INVESTIGATOR_547358] (see Figure 7 B -D). These sequences will improve reliability and sensitivity for probabilistic 
tractograph y to estimate fiber trajectories from regions defined with our other imaging modalities ( structural, 
resting state  or task fMRI ).  
DTI processing:  The diffusion preprocessing  pi[INVESTIGATOR_547359], including 
equalizing int ensity of b0s across runs, removing EPI [INVESTIGATOR_547360] -current distortions, correcting for motion and 
gradient nonlinearities, and registration to T1w images. Tractography and other DTI post-processing  including 
tensor fitting (to obtain global and tract -specifi c measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean, axial and radial 
diffusivity (MD, AD and RD)) will occur separately, according to published protocols developed by [CONTACT_27156]   
(Lyden et al., 2014 ; Phillips et al., 2009 ; Reavis et al., 2017 )(Lyden et al., 2014 ; Phillips et al., 2009 ; Reavis et 
al., 2017 ) (Lyden et al., 2014 ; Phillips et al., 2009 ; Reavis et al., 2017 ) and others  (Sotiropoulos et al., 2013 ). For 
quality control of DTI data, we will utilize custom protocols that include automatic identification of signal drop out 
due to motion; each individual gradient map will also be inspected to flag other imaging artifacts and noise, and 
as for structural MRI data will be assigned a 1 -4 quality rating. I f >10 gradients  are assigned a poor quality rating, 
data will be determined as unusable and if possible, reacquisition will be scheduled.  
 
Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL): A state -of-the-art Simultaneous Multislice echo -planar imaging pseudo -continuous 
ASL (SMS EPI [INVESTIGATOR_547361]) will be used to acquire whole -brain regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and arterial transit 
time (ATT) m aps. RCBF is a marker of regional brain function and consists of non -invasive labeling of blood 
water using the magnetic properties of hydrogen protons to investigate blood volume flow (ml/min) and blood 
perfusion (ml/100mg of tissue/min). ATT denotes the time it takes for the blood to flow from the labeling region 
(in the neck area) to the region of interest. rCBF and ATT will be used here as markers for the antidepressant 
and cognitive enhancement effects of yoga vs. memory training. In particular, since patients exhibit 
cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive problems, the efficiency of arterial blood supply will be highly 
informative, both as a biomarker at baseline, and a marker of treatment change. The SMS EPI [INVESTIGATOR_547362] -label -delays (PLDs) with the following parameters: TR/TE = 3594/19ms, 60 slices 
(thickness = 2.3mm with 0.2mm gap in between), FOV = 215 x 215mm, voxel size = 2.5 x 2.5 x 2.5mm , matrix 
size = 86 x 86, slice  acceleration factor=6, PLDs= 200, 700, 1200, 17 00, 2200ms. Total scan time = 5min30s.  
 
ASL Processing: Image preprocessing involves motion correction with rigid head alignment and frame -wise 
displacement (FD) to identify and discard frames reflecting severe motion  (Power, Barnes, Snyder, Schlaggar, 
& Petersen, 2012 ). Subjects with >= 20% of images discarded will be excluded. A principal component analysis 
(PCA) -based algorithm will be performed to further rem ove residual motion artifacts and physiological noise in 
the remaining images. RCBF and ATT will be computed using two methods; weighted -delay (WD) and parameter 
fitting, described in detail by [CONTACT_547408] (Wang et al., 2013 ). The formula (Dai, Robson, 
Shankaranarayanan, & Alsop, 2012 ) to compute ATT( δ) from WD using WD is: 
1. Weighted -delay (WD):  
 
Whereby w(i) refers to the PLDs.  
 
2. Parameter fitting method:  

Reducing Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease in High -Risk Women through Yogic Meditation Training  
Principal Investigator (PI): Helen Lavretsky, M.D., M.S.  
 
22 
       
In the fitting method, f(i) is CBF at each individual delay  and the final CBF is the mean of the estimated CBF per 
PLD. The 5 PLDs allow us to estimate CBF and ATT simultaneously using parameters fitting (2). Resulting rCBF 
and ATT maps will then be co -registered with the T1 -weighted structural scan and normalized  to the MNI 
standard space template with subsequent spatial smoothing.  
 
WM Hyperintensities (WMH) .The 3D T2 -space images will be used to visualize WMHs by [CONTACT_18120] a semi -
automated WMH identifier  (Schwarz, Fletcher, DeCarli, & Carmichael ). Briefly, WMH burden will be assessed 
based on the signal intensities of co -registered 3D MEMPR and T2 -SPACE images , and population statistics on 
the spatial distribution and neighborhood structure of WM lesions. With every unit increase in WM burden, we 
will estimate % reduction in local brain tissue volume. GLM and multiple regression analyses will determine links 
between WM burden, clinical measures and vascular risk factors in each treatment group that may need to be 
controlled for.  
 
Integration with Mood and Neurocognitive Measures . To test hypotheses about the relationships between 
imaging metrics and change in mood and cognition, we will derive domain summary score s for the [ADDRESS_716068] – i.e., mood, memory, and executive function ing. Percent change in the mean Z scores will be calculated 
for each domain score and entered into analysis. We will first test the specific hypotheses described in the aims 
using separate  GLMs for each MRI method. Integration of Predictive Variables . After ana lysis is complete on the 
predictive validity of each MRI measure, those that significantly predict remission/relapse or cognitive decline at 
follow -up will be combined for regression analysis. We will use the best single predictor in each modality. The 
final analysis will include a step -wise multiple regression analysis of clinical outcomes.  
 
Autonomic nervous system (ANS) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_270023]. In order to link  genotype and neuroimaging 
data with respi[INVESTIGATOR_547363], we will perform a series of five tests : 1) rest; 2) paced breathing; 3) 
breath hold; 4) Valsalva maneuver; 5) hand grip. The se tasks will provide detailed information about 
cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_547364]. Continuous blood pressure will be asse ssed using a probe attached to two fingers 
of the same hand. An additional finger probe will be used to measure the Galvanic skin response (GSR) and 
chest electrodes will be applied for the electrocardiogram (ECG)  and on the hand for an electromyogram (EMG) . 
A respi[INVESTIGATOR_547365]’s chest will provide breath rate data and a small probe attached to the cheek 
will measure changes in face skin temperature. End-tidal CO2 will be measured using a capnomet er and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_547366]. Verbal instructions will be provided and a  
computerized task will indicate to the subjects when to begin and end each challenge, for example when to 
prepare for the breath hold (deep inhale followed by [CONTACT_547409]). Data will be recorded and time -locked using a BioPac system and associated software, which will also 
be used to process the data.  
 
Randomization and treatment schedule :  
After all screening and baseline test results are reviewed and eligibility criteria are confirmed, patients will sign 
the informed consent form. Next, participants will be randomized to either MET or KK+KY groups using a 
computer -generated random assignment scheme, which assigns participants in a 1:1 ratio to each group  using 
a customized module built into the centralized data system . All behavioral raters will be blind to the group 
assignment, and participants will be asked not to disclose their group assignment to the raters.  
 
Study intervention procedures:  
Participants will be randomized to: ( 1) MET class for 60 minutes per week  plus daily homework ; or (2) KY class 
for 60 minutes per week  plus daily KK homework . Participants will complete a questionnaire about the ir treatment 
expectations after their second class. Follow -up assessments imm ediately after the intervention (12 weeks) as 
well as at [ADDRESS_716069] of the interventions at both short - and long -term follow -up.

[ADDRESS_716070] 
detailed protocol for MET program is based on evidence based techniques th at use verbal and visual association 
strategies and practical strategies for memory compensation (Gross et al., 2012 ; Verhaeghen et al., 1992 ).  The 
MET program is manualized and includes components adapted from other effective memory training programs 
(Verhaeghen et al., 1992 ) such as: (1) Education ab out memory; (2) Preliminary instruction in the basic elements 
of memory strategies (i.e. “pre -training”); (3) Instruction in specific memory strategies; (4) Home practice with 
logs to track activity; (5) Addressing non -cognitive factors such as self -confid ence, anxiety, and negative 
expectations; (6) Small (i.e. 10 persons) groups and short (60 min) sessions. The curriculum is divided into [ADDRESS_716071] in which trainers: (1) Document attendance, collect 
homework com pletion logs and assess engagement in alternative treatments; (2) Review the previous session’s 
homework in order to reinforce home practice; (3) teach new techniques, reviews, and conduct in -class 
exercises, (4) assign homework for the upcoming week. Over all, in each session, roughly 15 minutes are devoted 
to reviewing the homework and 45 minutes is devoted to learning and practicing techniques. Specific techniques 
include: Visual associative learning strategies for learning faces and names (adapted from 
McCarty,1980) (McCarty, 1980 ), verbal associative techniques such as the use of stories to remember l ists; 
organizational strategies (categorizing items on a grocery list); forming good memory habits to recall where one 
places items, what one has done in the recent past (e.g. locking doors, turning off appliances); and how to 
remember future tasks (i .e., appointments).  [CONTACT_547431], a postdoctoral fellow supervised by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ercoli , or a

KK+KY intervention:  
Kundalini yoga (KY) class  will be scheduled for 60 minutes weekly and will be conducted by a certified yoga 
teacher. The content and structure of the class will be similar across weeks: 1) Tuning in (5 minutes); 2) Warm 
up (10 minutes); 3) Pranayam (10 minutes); 3) Kriya (20 minutes); 4) Meditation (12 minutes) 5) Shavasana (3 
minutes).  
Kirtan Kriya (KK) . Participants will be asked to engage in [ADDRESS_716072] ancient chanting meditation for the Kundalini Yoga practice as taught by [CONTACT_547410] (Andrew B. Newberg, Winteri ng, Khalsa, Roggenkamp, & Waldmanb, 2012 ). 
The meditation involves repetitive finger movements or mudras, as well as chanting of the mantra “Saa, Taa, 
Naa, Maa,” meaning “Birth, Life, Death, and Rebirth” first chanted aloud, then in a whisper, and silently for the 
total of 11 minutes with 1 minut e allocated to “tuning in” at the beginning and the final deep breathing relaxation 
accompanied by [CONTACT_547411].  
 
Alternate treatments.  All participants will be medically stable prior to entry into the study protocol. However, if 
participants engage in alternate treatments, they will be advised to inform the PI. Upon completion of the research 
procedures, yoga classes will be offered to participants who participate d in MET and vice versa.   
 
Treatment expectancy/ credibility.  Our s tudy has been designed to promote equal perception of treatment 
expectancy/ credibility between groups.  We will evaluate treatment credibility, expectation for change, and 
satisfaction after the 2nd session of treatment and at post -intervention using a [ADDRESS_716073] noticed that they attribute 
to the intervention. This data will be analyze through qualitative analysis at the completion of the study. Data 
analysis . Primary analyses will be carried out on an intent -to-treat basis; additional analyses considering dropout 
or other observable post -randomization outcomes will make use of an instrumental -variable analysis framework.

 Data will be analyzed using the SAS (v9. 4) statistical package. Data will be examined initially to identify issues 
such as departures from normality, which might suggest the need for transformation (e.g., logarithmic). 
Demographic variables (e.g., age, gender, etc.) will be compared by [CONTACT_547412]; this would define one possible set of appropriate covariates, if needed. Correlations (a) 
among outcome measures and (b) among potential covariates will be examined to eliminate redundancy via 
possible data reduction, e.g., formation of composite scores or selection of single measures from sets of highly 
inter-correlated variables. Cognitive domain scores will be obtained as follows: for each neuropsychological test, 
raw scores will be converted to stand ardized (Z) scores with a mean of [ADDRESS_716074] will be used to compare the demographic characteristics 
between the MET and KK+KY control group. The effect of intervention over time on the cognitive functions will 
be investigated in intention -to-treat (ITT) analyses. Measurements will be ana lyzed using linear mixed models; 
analyses will assume missing at random with missingness allowed. All models will include random intercepts to 
account for correlations between the repeated measures for each participant. The fixed components of the 
models w ill include effects  of group and time and a group X  time interaction, with post hoc analyses between 
times and groups. All statistical significance tests will be two -sided, and an alpha -level of 0.[ADDRESS_716075] hoc analyses.  
 
Primary outcome : The analyses for the memory domain Z scores will use general linear mixed model  (GLMM)  
analysis (e.g., SAS PROC MIXED). The two treatment groups will be compared for time course of cognitive 
domain z scores the initial endpoint EOT at [ADDRESS_716076] for this proposal is memory. A 
separate GLMM as above will be estimated using memory domain z -scores as dependent variables. Executive 
Function  will be examined as secondary outcome measure. Supplementary analyses of th e follow -up period will 
look at the cognitive domain scores by [CONTACT_547413] (p ost-treatment changes).  
Objective memory measures will be examined using a similar GLMM.  
 
Exploratory Hypotheses : GLMM models as described above  will be used to examine t elomerase activity 
(overall level and TL) and inflammatory measures  separately . Relationships between changes in markers of 
inflammation and telomerase activity to changes in cognitive scores, cognitive domain scores and fMRI 
meas ures will be examined using regression models within each group. Transformations of the measures will 
be performed as necessary.  
 
Power analysis : The power analysis is focused on the primary aim of the study to assess whether the KK+KY 
and MET groups  demonstrate comparable improvement in memory performance . We plan to enroll a total of [ADDRESS_716077] 10% based on our previous studies. Thus, we will 
most likely have a total of 90 completers. With a sam ple size of 45 per group, we achieve 80% power to detect 
equivalence within a margin of equivalence of 0.62, when the true difference between the means is assumed to 
be zero.  In the PI’s previous study using similar intervention s on older adults  with MCI , a between -group effect 
size of 0. 3-0.[ADDRESS_716078] size of 0.60 at a 
significance level of 0.05 and 80% power  for the secondary outcome measure (executive functioning) . We intend 
to test the secondary outcomes  adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini -Hochberg false discovery 
rate approach (which is more powerful than the simple Bonferroni correction). Further, w e will report results of 
all proposed analyses and conclusions will be based on the pattern of results .  
 
Data management : Data management and analysis support will be provided by [CONTACT_547414] (SI -Stat) ([CONTACT_547430]).  The SI -Stat will provide needed software and technical support with a 
data manager operating under the supervision of [CONTACT_547430]. The SI -Stat has a Dell PC computer network with

 automated CD R/W backup and is set up for medium to large -scale data process ing and analysis using available 
commercial database and statistical software. 1. Randomization.  Randomization schedules will be prepared in 
a masked manner by [CONTACT_30165]. 2. Data submission and quality control. Data forms will be delivered 
from the originating location to the central data unit within one week of being generated. When errors, omissions, 
or unclear information is detected on the paper forms, a copy will be returned for corrections. The data manager 
will generate monthly reports summari zing missing and incorrect data will be sent to the PI.  
Upon receipt of the data, each form will be visually scanned for obvious errors and logged in. The data clerk will 
perform the data entry and generate a daily and monthly report, and a quarterly pati ent accrual report. Data entry 
will be facilitated by 1) having visual screen formats similar to the actual forms; 2) having range boundaries on 
each field, where appropriate, to be checked automatically as data is entered; 3) having default values 
incorpo rated into the data entry system to minimize typi[INVESTIGATOR_007]. 3. Data confidentiality. All data including patient 
information will be carefully handled and securely stored. Patient study forms will be stored in locked file cabinets 
and will be accessible only to au thorized personnel. A shredder will be used to discard all unwanted study 
documents. A single computer will be dedicated to this study. Access to the system will be password protected 
with only authorized persons having knowledge of the password.  
 
Data Sha ring and Future Research:  
Data from this study  will be used  for other  ongoing  or future  research  projects  in the following  ways:  
-To perform  the research  
-Share  it with researchers  in the U.S. or other  countries  for data analyses  
-Use it to improve  the design  of future  studies  
-Share  it with the sponsor,  business  partners  of the sponsor  or  
-File applications  with U.S. or foreign  government  agencies  to get approval  for new drugs  or health  care products   
HUMAN SUBJECTS:  
Availability.   Participants will be recruited from several settings in order to obtain a representative sample. For 
previous  clinical studies we have successfully targeted recruitment efforts toward  elderly patients presenting at 
geriatric ambulatory care settings with an interdiscip linary focus and community dwelling patients who respond 
to our community outreach efforts. The vast majority of elderly participants  receive care for their mental and 
physical health in ambulatory care clinics: 1) Geriatric Medicine -Psychiatry clinics wit hin the UCLA Medical 
Center; 2) UCLA Women’s Cardiovascular Health Center 3 ) The UCLA Memory and Aging Center and the 
Longevity Center . In addition, we will conduct c ommunity outreach efforts and recruitment through advertising in 
newsletters and local new spapers.  
Each of these  methods  has significantly  contributed to ongoing recruitment for other studies in our laboratory . 
[CONTACT_547428] also has links to the local community of care providers for the elderly and to mental health 
professionals who could ser ve as a source of referrals. We anticipate having no competition with other studies 
for the same study populat ion (i.e., those 50 years and older).  
 
Recruitment.  Participants  will be recruited, assessed and randomized according to the scientific protocol and 
the consent procedures approved by [CONTACT_547415]. We project a recruitment p eriod of two years to a chieve recruitment of 100 participants . Our 
current rate of recruitment into antidepressant clinical trials for participants  55 years or older  averages about 4 -
5 participants /month. We anticipate that the  incentive to participate will be  sufficient since participation includes  
free MET and KK -KY classes.  Data analysis will be performed in year 2. We anticipate the dropout to be about 
10% ( 45 completers per group) in the first 1 2 weeks, and additional 10% at [ADDRESS_716079]  Activities

Year 1,

4-12  Continue recruitment ( 50 participants ).  
Year 2  Continue recruitment ( 50 participants ). Conduct inter -rater reliability sessions.  
 
Retention of participants . We have developed several  successful strategies for retention of elderly participants . 
These include an ongoing and continuous process of consent to study procedures, involvement of family 
members whenever possible, and use of co ncerned and empathic clinicians and staff. However, it is important 
to note that our data analytic approach is robust to attrition.   
 
Cohort maintenance.  The comprehensive evaluation of participants  prior to randomization and entry into the 
treatment tria l is designed to minimize attrition. The evaluation of weekly compliance questionnaires will also 
alert the PI [INVESTIGATOR_547367].  
 
Protection of human subjects and other human subject considerations.  The procedures involve minimal 
potential risks. One of the potential findings may be dementia. If dementia is documented during this study, one 
of the PI’s will counsel patients and their families about its significance and prognosis. Additionally, appropriate 
referrals for counseling and follow up will be made (e.g., UCLA Alzheimer's Center and the local chapter of the 
Alzheimer's Association). If participants  continue to demonstrate significant cognitive impairment despi[INVESTIGATOR_547368], we will refer them for a more complete neuropsychol ogical evaluation to the UCLA 
Geriatric Evaluation Clinic (Director  Gary Small), or the UCLA Alzheimer’s Disease Center ([CONTACT_547432]), 
or other qualified providers in the community in order to rule out the diagnosis of dementia. If a new physical 
illness is diagnosed, the participants  will be informed and their prima ry physicians will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530], or an 
appropriate referral in the community will be made. If the PI [INVESTIGATOR_547369], the primary physicians and/or psychiatrists will be contact[CONTACT_547416].  
 
Potential benefits  for participants  include diagnosis and treatment for memory dysfunction. For society, this study 
may provide a new strategy for improving memory dysfunction in women and may improve our understanding of 
the impact of other variables (e.g., medical burden and cerebrovascul ar risk factors) on treatment response.  
  
The MET program will offer the additional benefits of giving participants instruction in and tools for memory 
enhancement, which may improve their memory functioning. KK+KY will provide benefits of mindful exercise  
and socialization, which is usually appreciated by [CONTACT_547417].  
 
Testing procedures  also involve minimal potential risks.  Blood drawing, though a routine part of general 
medical examinations, entails a small possibility of such discomforts as blee ding, bruis ing, lightheadedness, 
fainting – or, rarely – infection.  Neuropsychological testing may induce feelings of failure, frustration, or anxiety.  
However, our psychometrist is highly experienced in assessing persons with memory impairment and conve ys 
a relaxed and confident attitude.  A minority of participants  experience anxiety and claustrophobia during MRI 
scanning. A potential risk of MRI scanning is if the patient has a non -magnet compatible device or if MR unsafe 
objects are brought into the s canner room. The UCLA Brain Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_547370], screening with an approved questionnaire, 
dual screening, and strict adherence to safety guidelines regarding devices. An other issue concerns how 
participants  are informed if their MRI scans show an unexpected  abnormality . The Brain Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_547371] a

[ADDRESS_716081]. Lavretsky , and the patient will be 
recommended to follow -up with their physician.    
 
The responsibility for medical, psychiatric, nursing, and social care of participants  will remain with the individual's 
primary physician and psychiatrist. All patients will be followed by a psychiatrist. Should the participant not have 
a physician in the area, a referral will be made to one in the patient's geographic area. With th e subject's consent, 
the results of their evaluation will be shared with the psychiatrist and primary physician. Subject identities will not 
be disclosed by [CONTACT_547418].  
 
COVID -19 Restrictions – Enacting March 2020.  As of March 2020, UC LA has enacted several restrictions on 
our campus to prevent COVID -19 contraction and spread. In order to align with these standards, we are giving 
participants the option to participate virtually through web -based and telephone meetings. This will be offe red for 
any appointment that is able to be completed remotely, as well as for both interventions the study is testing. All 
remaining portions that are not possible to obtain remotely (e.g., MRI, venipuncture) will be obtained as close to 
the proposed visit  date as possible.  
COVID -19 Questionnaire and Assessment . We will also instill a COVID -19 Questionnaire to all active 
participants to ensure optimal safety reporting and to correlate with current psychiatric measures. This will be 
administered as a survey,  with the responses coming verbatim from the participant. We will also remotely 
administer HAMA and BDI at the same time point. This visit will only be administered once, but will happen as 
soon as possible once approved.  
 
Compensation.  Because the procedu res are time -consuming, participants  will receive a $ 100.00 honorarium 
for their participation in the trial, which will be disbursed after completion of the 6 -month follow -up assessment. 
Participants will receive an additional $50 for completing the 12-month follow -up. Participants completing fMRI 
scans will receive $50 per scan. Thus, the maximum amount a participant will be paid for her participation in the 
trial is $250. In addition, w e will offer reimbursement for parking up to  $234.[ADDRESS_716082] Protection Committees (HSPC), as well as with the HSPC in 
all participating institutions, all legal and ethical safeguards for participants will be imp lemented. All participants 
will receive a copy of the Subject's Bill of Rights prior to giving consent to participate and will sign the Informed 
Consent form approved by [CONTACT_547419] -NPIH and affiliated institutions. They will receive a copy of the 
consent form .  
 
Potential a dverse effects of neuropsychological testing . Some study participants  may experience mild 
frustration or boredom during testing. Clinicians administering neuropsychological tests  are experienced in 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_547372].  
 
Discontinuation procedures.  Discontinuation from the study will be considered if participants  experience  
severe side -effects (rating of [ADDRESS_716083] Rating scale ). All severe adverse events will 
be reported to the participants , their psychiatrist and to their primary physicians and the UCLA IRB  
within one week of PI’s awareness, and within two weeks to the funder .  
 
All dropouts  will be analyzed by [CONTACT_547420]:   
1. a) Lack of eff icacy; b) Side -effects; c) Lost to follow -up; d) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; e) Death; f) Other  
2. Relation to the study intervention: a) likely; b) probable; c) unlike ly.

 Risk/benefit ratio.  Benefits from the proposed study outweigh its risks by [CONTACT_1541] a low-risk behavioral 
intervention for women with high AD risk factors. We will monitor participants  for side -effects. Neuropsychiatric 
tests carry minimal risk.  
 
The risk of breach of confidentiality is reduced by  [CONTACT_547421] : 1) storing records in a 
locked file, with access available only to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_547373]; 2) removing identifying information 
from all data during the data analysis phase of the project; and 3) removing identifying information from all data 
presented publicly in lectures, seminars, or publications.  
 
Data and Safety Monitoring plan.  We will assess safety in each individual case during each visit. The pati ents 
will be under continued care of their own physician for monitoring cardiovascular health,  mood and medication. 
In addition, ongoing monitoring of mood and cardiovascular health will be monitored by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Lavretsky and [CONTACT_547433] , respectively.  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_547374]. She 
will also ensure that  study coordinators a nd research assistants are collecting, storing, and disposing of  data 
properly.  Key personnel will provide pro gress reports to facilitate this review. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_547375]. The summary reports will provide data on enrollment and adverse events. 
Adverse events will be monitored using the UCLA Adverse Event and/or Inciden t Reporting forms (Forms HS -5 
& HS -6).  
 
Inclusion of women and minorities.  
This study will selectively recruit women as a population of interest. Women are adequa tely represented in the 
Memory C linic population and usually outnumber men (60%). Most participants  will not be minority members 
due to the composition of the population out of which our sample will be drawn. Patients of the Memory Clinic 
are primarily Caucasian (75%), followed by a minority of African -American (25%), Latino, and other ethni cities . 
The proportion of minority participants  recruited into our previous studies is as follows: Af rican -Americans, 9%; 
Hispanic, 6%; Asian, 3%; other, 4%. Recently, [CONTACT_547428] has been  active in providing outreach lectures, 
consultations, and adverti sing to the African -American and Hispanic communities in Los Angeles through the 
events by [CONTACT_547422]. At this time, we are confident in our ability to recruit 25% 
minority participants.  
 
Justification for including women only.  
Multiple factors lead us to conclude that a women -only participant pool will be ideal for the current  pi[INVESTIGATOR_93553]:  
 
1) As previously mentioned, women are at a significantly greater risk for AD than men.  
2) Our experience conducting previous trial suggests that women may be more comfortable participating in 
women -only yoga classes.  
3) Our previous study found that women were more interested in participating in a trial of  yoga vs. memory 
enhancement training (our previous sample was 66% female).  
4) fMRI data will be more interpretable if we limit our sample to one sex.  
5) The s ponsor of study is interested in focusing on women .

hypothesis, and the importance of the research.  
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the blood th at leads to severe morbidity and 
early mortality. It is the most common disease detected by [CONTACT_581747] (U.S.).1Between 80,[ADDRESS_764926]-known burden of SCD is the vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC). These acute, 
excruciatingly painful events are the leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581738],[ADDRESS_764927]

The Emergency Department ( ED) has been the standard location where patients with SCD go to 
seek care for the treatment of acute painful events.  ED care for SCD  is marked by [CONTACT_581748], 
lack of efficacy, and conflict . Nationally, forty percent of ED visits for SCD pain are concluded by

3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with proce dures, 
drug or device, and an y other relevant information to justify the research ) 
Sickl e cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder of the blood that leads to severe morbidity and early 
mortality. It is the most common disease detected by [CONTACT_581750] 
(U.S.).1Betwe en 80,000 and 100,000 individuals in the U.S. are affected by [CONTACT_487651].2 African -
Americans (AA) are most affected in the U.S., as [ADDRESS_764931]-known burden of SCD is the vaso -occlusive crisis (VOC). These acute, excruciatingly painful 
events are the leading cause of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_487630],[ADDRESS_764932] syndrome and stroke. Acute and chronic pain, 
psychiatric co -morbidity and disease severity are factors that likely contribute to extraordinarily high levels 
of unemployment and decreased productivity in this patient population , with estimates that 40% of adults 
with SCD  are unemployed.6 
The Emergency Department ( ED) has been the standard location where patients with SCD go to seek 
care for the treatment of acute painful events.  The purpose of this proposal is to demonstrate that, f rom 
the patient perspective, the ED is not the ideal site for the management of acute, uncomplicated VOC 
events. While SCD  is considered a rare disease in the US, the burden  of ED  care and subsequent 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581740] , and it is borne by [CONTACT_67022] . The number of ED visits by [CONTACT_581751], with a 28% increase since 2006 (the first year data is available from AHRQ). Sixty eight 
percent of these visits are coded as acute painful crises. In 2011, there were 317,557 ED  visits for peo ple 
with SCD, and 82% of these visits were by [CONTACT_581752] 18 and over. Of ED visits that resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_124021], for every 100 people estimated to be living with the disease in the US (2006), 68.[ADDRESS_764933] of any recorded diagnosis, at 
31.9%.[ADDRESS_764934] addiction i n patients presenting for VOC care.23  
A strong body of literature supports the assertion that a subspecialty infusion center (IC) , staffed by 
[CONTACT_581753], can improve c are quality while reducing costs. 
Benjamin et al. found that establishment of a dedicated SCD day hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581739] a 40% reduction in 
inpatient admis sions relative to ED management .[ADDRESS_764935] comparison  between  IC 
clinics and the ED setting .  The dearth of data has contributed to the lack of widespread adoption of this 
model of care. At this time there are less than 10 dedicated IC’s for adults with SCD, so few patients have 
access to such clinics and th us acute care in the US for painful epi[INVESTIGATOR_581741]. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that care provided in an Infusion Center is more 
patient centered and efficient than care provided in an Emergency Department f or adults with SCD and 
uncomplicated VOC.  
While VOC is the most common complication of SCD there are currently no evidenced based guidelines 
for the management of these events.29 (RQ-1) Using an expert panel, W ang et al [ADDRESS_764936] dose of 
analgesic. There are no similar studies in adults , but the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute  (NHLBI)  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_764937] similar recommendations 
for acute pain management for all people with SCD.  (RQ-1) Neither of these quality outcomes is routinely 
achieved in the ED setting .  While there is a lack of available national data on quality measures , data on 
the average wait time to see a physician for a patient with SCD in the ED  shows that it  is over an hour.31 
This wait is 25% longer than for patients in the  general ED population . As the physician must s ee the 
patient prior to writing an order for pain medication, it is clear that the average time to first dose of 
analgesia in this nationwide sample is well over an hour. Data from the Johns Hopkins ED  for [ADDRESS_764938] dose o f parenteral pain 
medication is  2 hours and 7 minutes.  In the Cleveland ED only 47% of the visits had any documentation 
of pain reassessment after medication was given  and in those where there was documentation it occurred 
on average [ADDRESS_764939] dose of pain medication.    
 
There continues to be a wide variation in how acute painful events are diagnosed and managed in the 
acute setting  because management of VOC has never been studied in a systematic fashion (RQ -1).  
There ar e no objective clinical or laboratory measures of the presence or severity of a crisis, and so the 
only way to confirm that a patient is having a crisis is to ask the patient (i.e., patient self -report). The 
current pain scales used for self -report have no t been validated in this patient population.[ADDRESS_764940]  shown similar outcomes to 
that of Benjamin24. The Johns Hopkins Sickle Cel l Infusion Center (SCIC) which opened in 2008 provides 
acute care solely for adults with SCD. In 2008 , 50% of all ED visits for VOC resulted in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581742] (JHH) . The SCIC initially was opened [ADDRESS_764941]. Lanzkron, who is the  medical director  and the proposed PI [INVESTIGATOR_72188] .  From the period 
February 2008 through December 2011 there were 3874 visits to the SCIC by 361 unique patients. On 
average , there were 3.8 visits to the infusion  clinic daily (range 0 -10). The average numb er of visits by 
[CONTACT_581754] 10 (range 1 -84) or 2.5/yr.  Eighty five percent  of visits ended with the  patient being 
discharged home. The remainder were either directly admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_581743]. The average tim e to receipt of first dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_581744] 57.7 minutes  
(95% CI 56.5 , 58.8 ). The average time that patients spent in the SCIC was 4 hours and 55 minutes. The 
average pain level on arrival using the numerical rating scale  (NRS) , which measures pain on a scale of 0 -
10,  was 8.4 (95% CI 8.3 , 8.4).  The average decrease in pain score from arrival to discharge was 2.62 
points on the NRS (95% CI 2.55 , 2.69) . Those who went home ha d a significantl y greater decrease in pain  
than those that remained for  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_10422] ( Δ-2.9 v s. Δ-1.2, p<0.001).  There was borderline statistical but 
no clinically significant difference in time to first dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_581745] (57.2 min v 60.3 min, p=0.0 6). In examining the 
association of changes in pain scores  with discharge disposition, we found that , after adjust ing for gender , 
patients were 2 times (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.85, 2.19) more likely to be discharged home for every 1 point 
decrease in their pain.  In comparing these outcomes to the JHH ED between 4/2010 -7/[ADDRESS_764942] dose of pain medication during this time period was 190 minutes (SD 129.8).  In a model controlling 
for acuity  in the ED , for every [ADDRESS_764943] dose of pain medication, the relative risk of 
admission increased by 0.7% (95% CI 1.00 1.01, p=0.024) .  Since the opening of the SCIC there has been 
a 22%  reduction in admissions and reduction in 30 day readmissions from 39% to 22%.  
A similar clinic  to the SCIC opened  at Froedtert Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_423957]  (FASCC)  in 2011 .  The FASCC 
clinic is open weekdays and serves the needs of 300 adults with SCD. The avera ge length of stay in the 
clinic is 3 hours and 96.5% of visits end with the patient being discharged home. Since this clinic opened 
there has been  a 38% decrease in admissions  and a decrease in 30 day readmissions from 61 to 28%.

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_764944] compari son of ED to IC, many argue that there is something different about the patients 
that receive care in an ED versus those that seek care in an IC. Further, the recent expansion in ICs has 
been driven primarily by [CONTACT_581755] (length of stay, read missions), rather than by [CONTACT_4676] -
centered outcomes, on which there is a lack of data. Demonstrating attainment of important clinical 
outcomes in ICs may increase their stability and viability. With this proposal we will demonstrate that 
the improved outco mes seen in an IC v. the ED are not due to differences in the type of patients 
seen for care but rather in the processes of care for VOC in these two sites.   
 
4. Study Procedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distingui sh research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
We will prospectively enroll patients that are seen in  participating centers into a study  cohort .  We will 
then capture data from their  acute visits . We will enroll participants from 4  sites: Baltimore, Cleveland , 
Milwaukee and Baton Rouge . When any participant is treated in either an ED or IC , data on clinical 
outcomes and patient experiences of care will be collected .  
Baseline d ata collection will include:  SCD  genotypes  and co-morbidities35  
a. AVN 
b. Gall bladder disease  
c. Sickle chronic lung disease  
d. Leg ulcer  
e. Priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] (male)  
f. Renal failure  
g. Retinopathy  
h. Stroke  
2. Self-reported number of acute care visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117259] 12 months  
3. Daily  chronic pain using the Numeric Rating scale (NRS).  
4. Prior and current treatments, including:  
a. hydroxyurea use  
b. chronic transfusions  
c. pain medications, (specific regimens used to treat chronic daily or intermittent pain)  
After participants  have consented they will be asked to contact [CONTACT_581756] s.  In addition, the research assistant will review the daily census for 
IC’s and ED’s at the local site to identify participants  with an acute care visit.  Furthe rmore, each 
participant  will be contact[CONTACT_581757].   
Once an acute care visit for an uncomplicated VOC has occurred , the following data will be collected:  
Time crisis started, Arrival time , Triage time , Pain level on arrival , Time to first dose of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] , Time from 
first dose to nurse reassessment of pain , Time in the ED/IC , Pain level at discharge from ED/IC , Change 
in pain scale from arrival to discharge , Disposition at time of discharge from ED/IC (home, admit, e tc.). In 
order to assess patient experiences of care in the acute setting , participants  will be surveyed either 
toward the end of their acute visit or by [CONTACT_581758] [ADDRESS_764945]  information and encourage participants to call us within 3 days of any 
acute visit. The survey tools that will be used include the Painful Crises Experiences of Care for SCD 
tool (PEPS) ; a survey of safety and a survey of patient satisfaction with ED pain  management.

7. Study Statistics  
Primary and secondary outcome variable s: This is an obs ervational study from which we will draw 
inferences about outcomes of care attributable to the treatment setting. As we are not randomizing 
patients to ED care or to IC care, we must control for confounders in the relationship between site of care 
and outc omes.  We note, however, that there may be regional differences that impact on outcomes: 
percentage of high utilizers in the region, duration IC has been functioning, and ED crowding. In our study, 
we have clustering of individual patients by [CONTACT_371930] (n=4) .  We will account for both known and unknown 
confounders at the level of the regions.   
 
Given the anticipated differences in patients who seek care in these settings, we propose using propensity 
score techniques to balance patient characteristics in the two treatment groups both within and across 
sites. We will use relatively new methods developed for use of propensity scores in the context of 
multilevel data.[ADDRESS_764949] stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)44, which states that the outcomes for each 
patient are unaffected by [CONTACT_581759], each patient has two potential 
outcomes corresponding to the two treatments (ED or IC care), onl y one of which is observed for each 
patient.  We believe the SUTVA assumption to be true in our setting. We aim to estimate the population 
average treatment effect, although we may also look at the population average treatment effect on the 
treated (ATT), which we expect will be very similar.  
Notation Let k = 1, 2, …, K denote number of regions and i=1, 2, …, n_k denote the number of 
participants  in region k.  Total sample size is n = 
 .  Each subject belongs to one of two groups, ED 
(control) o r IC (treatment) care.  Let Z ki be the binary variable indicating whether the subject is in the 
treatment (Z=1) or control (Z=0) group. Also, let U ki be a vector of subject -level covariates and V k be a 
vector of region -level covariates, and X ki = (U ki, Vk).  For each subject, an outcome Y ki is observed, which, 
in our study, can be continuous or binary.  The propensity score is defined as e(X ki) = Pr(Z ki=1 | X ki).   
Fitting a Propensity Model  Given the multi -region (clustered) data, we cannot use standard te chniques 
for propensity score modeling but instead  will use a random effects model  that accounts for clustering. We 
have chosen this model because we are uncertain about all of the cluster -level covariates that might 
impact on treatment effect. The few tha t we hypothesize to be regional -level confounders, as described 
above, we will include in the model. The individual level covariates will include: SCD complications, self -
reported number of acute care visits and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_117259] [ADDRESS_764950] 
arrival for care, distance from residence to site of care, and demographic variables.  The random effects 
model to generate the propensity score is as follows :   logit (e ki) = k + X ki  
This model includes individual level covariates, as well as cluster -specific intercepts due to measured and 
unmeasured cluster -level covariates, and a prior distribution for cluster -level main effects, k ~ N(0, 2). We 
expect that since  we will have many patients within each region (cluster), we should not have any difficulty 
in fitting the random -effects model.  The goodness of fit of this model will be checked by [CONTACT_581760], checking the overall and within -
region balance of the weighted distribution of covariates in the two groups . 
Estimating an Overall Treatment Effect  We will then use the inverse of the propensity score,  eki, 
generated from the random effects mo del described above, to weight the outcomes  for each individual. 
This will allow us to draw valid inferences about the differences between groups.  We propose using a non -
parametric clustered -estimator as our inverse -probabi lity-weighted estimator.

 Where  wk = 
 , w ki = Z ki/eki + (1-Zki)/(1-eki), and 
  is the inverse -propensity weighted treatment effect for 
the k -th region. This estimator accounts for clustering of the patients by [CONTACT_11338]. The standard error of the 
estimate will be generated by [CONTACT_63676][INVESTIGATOR_007].  
To test the first hypothesis (time to pain medication), we will use the observed time to first dose (a 
continuous outcome) in the two groups.  We do not need to use time -to-event models since there will be 
no censoring. We will evaluate whether the time needs to be log -transformed in order to be approximately 
normally distributed. To test the second hypothesis, we will describe the proportion of patients in each 
group that is reassessed in the first [ADDRESS_764951] model rather than a random effects model (Eq 
2).  We might also explore the use of a doubly robust estimator, where we would model the potential 
outcomes using a random effects model. The results are expected to be similar.  
We will also test whether our i nferences are sensitive to hidden biases from unmeasured confounders. We 
will estimate how strong an unmeasured confounder needs to be related to both exposure and outcome to 
affect the inference about difference in effect in the treatment sites. Potential  unmeasured confounders 
might be patient -preference for site of care, or local culture or climate regarding care of patients with SCD . 
a. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
We have based the needed sample size on t he outcome requiring the most participants, the admission 
rate from the ED v. IC. We hypothesize that we will observe an ED admission rate of 50%9, and  an IC 
admission rate of 27% (an absolute reduction of at l east 23%). We took the following design 
considerations into account in estimating the sample sizes needed to detect this difference: We have a 2 -
arm study (IC vs. ED) with 4 clusters (sites) per arm.  With a type I error of 0.05, a type II error of 0.20 
(power 0.80), and an estimated intracluster correlation coefficient (I CC) of 0.02, we  will require an average 
of 41 participants  in each cluster (site) per arm.  410 participants  total (205 per arm) are required to detect 
our hypothesized difference in admis sion rate.  We estimate we will observe a lost -to-follow -up rate of 18% 
so our total required sample size is [410/(1 -0.18)] = [ADDRESS_764952] protected computer.  The data 
put in REDCap will be de -ident ified.  As REDCap is a secure website and only deidentified data 
will be put in it the risk of loss of privacy is minimal.  Every attempt will be made to assure that 
all locally collected data is kept in a secure environment and that all identifiers will b e removed 
from primary data.  The spreadsheet with the identifying info linked to the unique identifier will 
be destroyed when  the REDCap database is finalized and locked.  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.  Any breach of patie nt 
confidentiality will be reported to the IRB.

comparison of the treatment of acute pain in SCD comparing ED’s and IC’s will result in a better 
understanding of where this treatment should occur.  The study will demonstrate how IC’s can 
provide more rapid and appropriate care for t his patient population and this should lead to greater 
access to these services for patients throughout the US who suffer from SCD.  
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, proposed bonus,

We will compensate participants for time and inconvenience associated with study participation.

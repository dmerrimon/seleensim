Tolerance in Renal Allograft Recipi[INVESTIGATOR_239977]:  II 
IND Sponsor: Allan Kirk, MD  PhD 
Participating Site:  Emory University  
Study Design:  Single-center, open -label, proof -of-concept study in non-HLA-identical 
live and deceased donor renal transplants.  
Duration of Study:  Subjects will be enrolled over a one -year period and followed for up 
to five years.   
Number of Subjects: Approximately 40 
Study Population:  Adult, EBV seropositive  patients who do not have evidence of DSA 
pretransplant and who are scheduled to receive a kidney transplant  at Emory University. 
Candidacy for transplantation will be determined using the standard methods of 
evaluation active at Emory during the study period . 
Primary Objective: To determine whether lymphocyte  depletion with alemtuzumab  
followed by [CONTACT_240054], and will allow for a general population of renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_239978] . The primary 
endpoint will be the number of patients successfully withdrawn from sirolimus for [ADDRESS_291349]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

1) Determination of the prognostic ability of assays based on surface phenotype 
changes seen during homeostatic repopulation, including Ki67 expression, T REG 
and BTRANS cell surface phenotypes, and T M to TREG/BTRANS balance, with regard 
to the anticipation of successful immunosuppressive drug wi thdrawal.

Alemtuzumab . At the time of transplantation patients will be given a single dose of 
methylprednisolone [ADDRESS_291352] of 
care.   
Belatacept . Belatacept will be given within 24 hours of transplantation via a peripheral 
intravenous catheter at a dose of 10mg/kg (actual body weight) infused over 30 mins. The dose will be repeated on study days 4 (post op day 3) and 8 (post op day 7), then every 2 weeks for 5 additional doses. Thereafter, belatacept will be given once every 4 weeks (+/ - 3 days) at 10mg/kg through 6 months then at 5mg/kg indefinitely.  
Sirolimus. Sirolimus will be started on postoperative day 1 at a dose of 2 mg per day 
orally. Doses will be adjusted to maintain 24-hour trough levels of 8-10ng /ml until the 
drug is weaned  as described below.  
Toxicity attributable to sirolimus (e.g., mouth ulcers, arthralgias) will prompt dose reduction to address clinical concerns in this regard. If sirolimus trough levels need to be reduced below 4ng/ml to control drug side effects, the patient will be considered 
intolerant to the drug and will be changed to MMF (1.0 gm twice daily) and prednisone (starting at 30mg  - 20mg daily tapered to off over 1-3 months depending on the time 
from transplantation).  
Prophylaxis. With the exception of the immunosuppressive drugs used, perioperative 
care, including vira l, bacterial and fungal infection prophylaxis will be administered in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_239980]. 
 
Weaning Schedule: Weaning of immunosuppression will begin for all patients meeting 
pre-defined criteria.  Patients will be first weaned off s irolimus over at least a 2 – 6 
month period by [CONTACT_240056]/or increasing the dosing interval.   After sirolimus is weaned, patients will remain on belatacept monotherapy indefinitely.

immunosuppression can be reduced by [CONTACT_240058] -transplant treatment with alemtuzumab, a 
monoclonal antibody that transiently depletes T -cells. Pre -clinical data have also 
indicated that, unlike conventional immunosuppressive therapy, drugs that inhibit T -cell 
costimulation, e.g. by [CONTACT_240059]80 and CD86, promote 
adaptation of the immune system such that immunosuppressive requirements diminish 
with time. In some animal models this has led to allograft tolerance, a condition in which 
a transplanted organ is accepted without the need for chronic immunosuppression and without recipi[INVESTIGATOR_239982] -incompetence. This process has been shown in animal models 
to be facilitated by [CONTACT_240060], and to be aided by [CONTACT_240061].

All patients will be given a single dose of alemtuzumab on the day of transplantation. All 
patients will then be treated with belatacept and sirolimus for 1 year. Patients who remain  
rejection-free for 1 year  and meet in vitro flow cytometric criteria indicating that their 
immune system has repopulated (Ki67 expression returns to baseline)  will be gradually 
withdrawn from sirolimus,  to determine if they  can maintain a rejection -free state on 
belatacept monotherapy. In addition to clinical outcome, immune reconstitution following T -cell depletion and the development of donor -specific immune 
unresponsiveness will be evaluated. If successful, the trial will present an immediately applicable method for organ transplantation without  dependence on chronic 
immunosuppressive drugs.

Approximately 17,600 patients undergo renal transplantation in the [LOCATION_002] each

the principal protagonists in cellular allograft rejection. A significant amount of allograft rejection, par ticularly that occurring late after transplantation, is attributable to the effects 
of B-cell mediated alloantibody production.
48-50 However, alloantibody production is also 
generally considered to be T cell dependent, relying upon the effects of T cell help. Thus, effective control of allospecific T cells generally prevents both antibody and cellular mechanisms of allograft destruction.
51 Indeed, a substantial cause of graft loss is 
attributable to late antibody mediated rejection driven by [CONTACT_105] -adherence with T cell -
specific drugs.52 Typi[INVESTIGATOR_239985] a

In an effort to reduce the need for maintenance immunosuppression, over 80% of North American transplant centers now employ induction therapy
59 with a brief course of an 
anti-T cell antibody preparation (daclizumab, basiliximab, alemtuzumab or rabbit anti-
thymocyte globulin,  RATG). Indeed, most centers (58%) opt for T cell depletion with 
RATG or alemtuzumab,4,7 driven by [CONTACT_240063]. One induction agent that is gaining attention is alemtuzumab.
32,33 Alemtuzumab is a CD52-specific humanized MAb indicated for the 
treatment of some lymphogenous malignancies and has been increasingly used off -label 
in transplant indications.4,7 Its advantages include a singular target (CD52) and 
monoclonal composition, both of which greatly reduce the batch -to-batch variation and 
side effects seen with polyclonal RATG. However, its use has been limited by [CONTACT_240064][INVESTIGATOR_239986], in that companies have opted for development in more profit able indications despi[INVESTIGATOR_239987].

4 CNIs inhibit T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in 
naïve, memory and effector T cells, and T cell dependent B -cell help through inhibition 
of calcineurin -calmodulin -dependent pathways,61-[ADDRESS_291366] common in clinical transplantation, being used in 
over 94% of patients through 2009.[ADDRESS_291367]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

and are expensive, costing over $17,[ADDRESS_291369] many non- immune side effects that hamp er their 
tolerability. Specifically, CNIs are nephrotoxic  and induce secondary renal failure in up

73 As such, methods of transplantation that lessen the 
dependence on and side effects of maintenance immunosuppression stand to reduce the risk and expense of transplantation.   
Belatacept is a new alternative to CNI -based maintenance therapy. Belatacept is a B7 -
specific fusi on protein that mediates CD28-B7 costimulation blockade (CoB).
34-41 Naïve 
T cells require CD28 costimulation in addition to TCR signaling to optimally activate; 
failure to receive costimulation at the time of TCR signaling not only inhibits activation, but also promotes antigen- specific cell anergy and/or apoptosis.
22-24,34,75-[ADDRESS_291371] already been activated and moved beyond the requirement for costimulation. Thus, CoB has the potential to more selectively and more permanently influence allospecific T cells compared to CNIs. Furthermore, its precise targeting of costimulatory pathways avoids many of the off- target side effects  associated with CNIs, 
MMF and steroids.
36-41 Unfortunately, belatacept appears less able to prevent early acute 
rejection than CNIs when used as indicated: in combination with basiliximab, steroids and MMF.

those generally associated with prolonged CNI use: nephrotoxicity, hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_239989] 2 diabetes.
36-41 Accordingly, belatacept has recently 
(June, 2011) been approved by [CONTACT_4760] a CNI repla cement. However, belatacept’s 
optimal use remains undefined. Its patients remain encumbered with the side effects of adjuvant agents, and accept a higher risk of rejection compared to CNI- treated patients.  
Depletional induction approaches have been  shown to reduce the risk of early rejection  
post-transplant, and perhaps to reduce the needs for maintenance immunosuppression. Most notably, T cell depletion with alemtuzumab has been shown in several phase [ADDRESS_291374]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539  
Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- [ADDRESS_291375] emerged, given the limited number of patients served and the remarkably low dose (generally a single dose) required in this indication. However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_239990], it is clear that T cell depletion alone is not sufficient to induce tolerance, as patients treated with alemtuzumab alone, or who have stopped taking their maintenance therapy following depletion have uniformly experienced acute , albeit 
reversible, allograft rejection .
[ADDRESS_291376] been investigated and moved into the mainstream 
over the same time period as CoB;[ADDRESS_291377] now shown that many patients 
treated with a combined depletional/CoB therapy have diminishing donor- directed 
alloimmune responses over time. As such, we have been able to successfully reduce the immunosuppressive burden in many patients, avoiding CNIs and steroids from the outset, and eventually arriving at a maintenance regimen that consists solely of a once monthly dose of belatacept. These data (described below) are the first in man to systematically pair readily available agents and arri ve upon a simple induction and maintenance regimen 
that prevents rejection (cellular and antibody medicated), avoids use of both CNIs and steroids, and delivers many patients to a regimen based solely on CoB. Importantly, our initial data suggest that the trajectory for these patients is towards lessening 
immunosuppressive requirements. Indeed, we have developed a means of assessing this process (see below) and now propose to incorporate this into the gradual move away from systemic immunosuppression.  
The biology of CoB-based immune adaptation to an existing allograft has been 
extensively studied in animal models of transplantation, but is yet to be translated into 
humans. Pre-clinical work has shown that interruption of the interaction between CD28 and its ligands at the time of antigen exposure can prevent allograft rejection and that continued exposure to antigen in the presence of CoB facilitates a gradual, donor- specific 
elimination of allospecific T cells.

be most effective as a protracted therapy.  Importantly, CoB is not effective in the absence 
of donor antigen.[ADDRESS_291379] time rigorously 
investigated the requirements regarding the source and amount of donor antigen; prospectively testing whether donor bone marrow is a mandatory requirement for this effect to occur in humans. As discussed below, we find that the allograft itself appears to be a sufficient source of donor antigen to mediate the desired effects. This novel finding, derived from the only randomized assessment of this effect as it relates to CoB in 
humans, greatly simplifies the logistical challenges to implementation of the proposed 
regimen, and eliminates the theoretical con cerns regarding bone marrow induced GVHD.  
This trial, forged upon the prevailing concepts shapi[INVESTIGATOR_239991], will continue to build upon the promising clinical results obtained during the first funding cycle of this grant, use mechanistic insights gleaned from the study of existing patients, and test a refined and more generalizable form of this therapeutic approach to transplantation. It will continue the clinical and mechanistic follow-up of the first 20 patients enrolled in the study, implement the study of a second cohort of patients that includes broader inclusion criteria (a critical factor when considering the design of a adequately powered registration trial), and prospectively test a rational and biologically based means of g uiding immunosuppressive reduction, ending in a reproducible approach 
to maintain kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_239992] a once monthly CoB-based monotherapy maintenance regimen, that progressively eliminates the risk of rejection and late DSA formation, and avoids the prevailing off- target side effects plaguing the field today. The 
resulting approach will be 1) feasible, based solely on available agents; 2) cost effective, eliminating drug burden with time; and 3) safer than chronic immunosuppressive drug exposure or induction regimens paired with rapid, empi[INVESTIGATOR_239993].

available in A ppendix C and in the IB. These data are summarized below. 
Pre-Clinical Safety  
Although belatacept has increased binding affinity for B7 molecules in primates and 
humans compared to CTLA4Ig, the binding affinity for murine CD80 and CD86 is lower. Since CTLA 4Ig binds more avidly than does belatacept in mice and it is very similar to 
belatacept in both its mechanism of action and its structure, CTLA4Ig is considered an acceptable homologue for belatacept for rodent toxicology assessments to support registratio n requirements. CTLA4Ig was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in 
mice but was shown to increase the risk of virally driven malignancies consistent with its known immunosuppressive properties.  
Non-clinical safety assessments of belatacept were perfo rmed in cynomolgus monkeys 
and showed that it was well tolerated when given intravenously to monkeys at doses up 
to 50 mg/kg every other day for 1 month (15 doses) or once weekly for 6 months. Belatacept was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in cynomolgus monkeys. The major non- clinical findings in monkeys with belatacept were reversible, related to the 
pharmacology of the drug, and consisted of minimal decreases in serum IgG levels and minimal-to-moderate lymphoid depletion of germinal centers in the spleen and/or lymph 
nodes at all dose levels. There were no solid or lymphoid malignancies noted in the 6 month toxicity study with belatacept or in a 1 year toxicity study with CTLA4 -Ig. 
Additional pertinent findings are summarized in Appendix C; a more  thorough 
description of these studies is available in the IB. 
Pre-Clinical Efficacy  
Belatacept shows greater binding avidity than its parent molecule CTLA4Ig for human CD80 and CD86.  It is approximately 10- fold more effective in vitro on a per -dose basis  
than CTLA4Ig at inhibiting T -cell proliferation, T -cell cytokine production, and 
CD28-dependent killing of target cells by [CONTACT_113921] -like cells.  In an in vivo primate 
immune response model, belatacept potently blocked a primary antibody response against sheep red blood cells. At equivalent doses, belatacept was 3- to 11-fold more potent (by 
[CONTACT_5883]
90) than CTLA4Ig at blocking specific humoral responses. 
Belatacept was found to be efficacious for the prevention of graft rejection in a 
cynomolgus monkey  model of renal transplantation.[ADDRESS_291386]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

stringent model.  A regimen of belatacept + MMF + corticosteroids and a regimen of belatacept + basilixi mab prolonged graft survival superior to belatacept monotherapy as 
well as that historically observed in monkeys treated with CsA + corticosteroids.  Analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data in monkeys suggested a relationship between trough serum drug concentrations and immunosuppressive efficacy. Additional pertinent findings are summarized in Appendix C; a more thorough description of these studies is available in the IB.   
1.3.2 Clinical Pharmacology 
Single-dose Phase 1 studies with belatacept were performed in 40 healthy volunteers 
using doses ranging from 0.1 to 20 mg/kg. No deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) 
were reported. All reported clinical AEs were of mild or moderate intensity. No histamine -like peri-infusional AEs were reported. There was no evidence for the 
development of anti -belatacept antibodies. Belatacept kinetics were found to be dose -
proportional between 1 and 20 mg/kg. The half -life was adequately characterized 
between the 5 and 20 mg/kg dose levels, and ranged between 176 – 210 hours (7-9 days). 
The steady -state volume of distribution (VSS) values were small, indicating that the drug 
(with high molecular weight) was confined mainly in the plasma and extracellular space. Overall, the PK of belatacept appears to be linear following i.v. administration in healthy 
subjects. Additional pertinent findings are summarized in Appendix C; a more thorough description of these studies is available in the IB. 
1.3.3 Phase 2 Study in Rheumatoid Arthritis  
Study IM103002 was a Phase 2 pi[INVESTIGATOR_239996] a ssessed the efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of multiple i.v. doses of belatacept, CTLA4Ig, and placebo in 
214 subjects with RA. Eligible subjects had a diagnosis of RA for ≤ [ADDRESS_291387] 1 disease- modifying anti- rheumatic drug therapy, including etanercept, and had 
active disease ( ≥ 10 swollen joints, ≥ 12 tender joints, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
≥ 28 mm/h, and morning stiffness ≥ 45 minutes). Overall, belatacept demonstrated 
dose-dependent efficacy in this subject population, as  evidenced by [CONTACT_240067]. With respect to safety, no deaths were reported during the 
treatment or follow -up period (through Day  169), and no SAEs were considered drug 
related by [CONTACT_473].  
1.3.4 Phase 2 Study in Solid O rgan Transplantation 
Study IM103100 was a 1 -year, partially -blinded, randomized, active -controlled, multiple -
dose, multicenter (including Emory) non- inferiority study in de novo renal transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] .
36 All subjects received basiliximab induction and  background maintenance 
immunosuppression with MMF and corticosteroids. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with belatacept (more intensive [MI] or less intensive [LI] regimens) or CsA. Belatacept was administered in a double -blind fashion, with the investigator and 
subject blinded to the identity of the belatacept dose regimen. The MI regimen most 
closely approximates that proposed in this trial.

Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- [ADDRESS_291388] appeared to be similar across the 3 treatment groups.  By [CONTACT_24473] 12, chronic allograft nephropathy (CAN) was approximately 30% -50% less 
common with belatacept that with CsA.  Death and/or graft loss occurred infrequently in 
all treatment groups, and was least frequently reported in the belatacept LI group.  Most graft losses occurred for technical, rather than immunological reasons.  With respec t to 
safety, the rate of AEs, including AEs resulting in discontinuation, was similar across the [ADDRESS_291389] conducted 
and preliminarily reported
1 a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether a single 
dose of alemtuzumab permits patients to avoid both CNIs and steroids, and instead be 
transplanted on a belatacept/sirolimus -based regimen. The trial was designed to offer 
patients the opportunity to wean from sirolimus at [ADDRESS_291390] to whe ther 
patients received a single dose of unfractionated donor bone marrow (10
8 nucleated 
cells/kg) on day 7. Enrollment was completed, with 20 participants participating. All were non-sensitized (crossmatch negative, PRA<20%) recipi[INVESTIGATOR_239997] s 
enrolled in an IRB-approved (IRB# 5064), prospectively registered (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) trial. Induction immunosuppression consisted of intraoperative alemtuzumab (30mg IV), with three daily doses of methylprednisolone (500mg) followed by [CONTACT_240068] 3. All patients received and tolerated the intended induction dose. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of belatacept (10mg/kg IV on days 1, 3, 7, 14, q2w x 4, q month x 3, 5mg/kg monthly) and sirolimus (adjusted to trough levels of 8-12ng/ml x 6 months, then 5- 8ng/ml). All patients tolerated belatacept. Four patients 
developed arthalgias, edema or mouth ulcers requiring conversion from sirolimus to MMF.  
Twenty patients (median 45 years, range 20 -69; 12 male:8 female,  16 Caucasian:4 
African American, all EBV seropositive) have been transplanted. In general, alemtuzumab induction followed by a belatacept- based maintenance regimen has been 
well tolerated and prevented rejection. With a mean follow -up of >700 days (102-1345 
days), all patients have excellent graft function Mean creatinine in mg/dl (range; n having reached that time point) at 6, 12 and 24 months is 1.1 (0.7-1.9; n=19), 1.1 (0.9-1.9; n=19) and 1.2 (0.6- 1.8; n=11) respectively. No patient was chimeric after bone marrow 
infusion, and there have been no differences in outcome attributable to the infusion

Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- 036 Page 18 of 93 (discussed below). There have been no malignancies, significant infectious illnesses, nor 
CMV viremia or disease (see discussion below regarding preservation of protective immunity). Asymptomatic BK viremia has been detected in nine patients and in all cases this responded to reductions in sirolimus and/or reduced belatacept dosing. Transient, low level, clinically insignificant EBV viremia was detected in four p atients. One patient has 
developed recurrent IgA nephropathy without a significant change in renal function. One patient has developed ulcerative colitis.  
Twelve patients have elected to wean to monotherapy belatacept; of these, five have been 
successfull y weaned from sirolimus and maintained from 3 to 15 months on monotherapy 
belatacept. Three patients failed sirolimus weaning. Two of these patients had subclinical rejection detected on protocol biopsy after sirolimus weaning and by [CONTACT_240069] a oral prednisone taper and were returned to belatacept/sirolimus maintenance. Follow -up 
biopsy at 3 months confirmed resolution of sub-clinical rejection in both cases. One patient developed a new DSA after being weaned from sirolimus without renal dysfunctio n or biopsy findings. The patient received a single dose of IVIg (2 grams/kg), 
and was returned to sirolimus/belatacept therapy. The DSA is currently undetectable. 
Five patients are in the process of sirolimus weaning. This includes two patients deemed 
ineligible for weaning due to recurrent IgA nephropathy or ulcerative colitis. Seven patients have declined weaning, opting rather to continue the well tolerated belatacept and low dose sirolimus indefinitely. One patient is less than [ADDRESS_291391] mechanistic data, discussed below, that form the basis of a specific testable hypothesis addressing patients’ individual capacities to wean to monotherapy belatacept, and the optimal timing to do so. These data will serve as a major theme of the continuation of this protocol. 
Two patients were weaned from all immunosuppression after successful elimination of 
sirolimus for over 6 months and re-consenting to the weaning process. Remarkably, both patients remained rejection free off all immunosuppressive medication for 4 and 7 months, respectively. One patient developed an asymptomatic DSA at 4 months. A biopsy showed no rejection. She was returned to belatacept maintenance and treated with a single dose of IVIg (2 grams/kg). The DSA resolved and she remains well >1 year after this event with normal graft function equivalent to her baseline serum creatinine of 0.7mg/dl. The other patient developed a DSA and a concomitant clinical mixed T cell mediated rejection (TCMR) and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) [ADDRESS_291392] CNI based immunosuppressive regimen. He remains stable on tacrolimus, MMF and prednisone with a serum creatinine of 1.5 mg/dl (baseline creatinine off all medication was 1.3mg/dl) over [ADDRESS_291393]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

It is important to point out that our approach in this situation is substantially different from that taken by [CONTACT_240070] a recently reported tolerance trial.
2,109-111 In this 
trial performed at the [LOCATION_005] General Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (MGH), several patients have been weaned from all immunosuppression. However, ABMR led to graft loss in [ADDRESS_291395] dose of sirolimus.“Successfully 
withdrawn” will be defined as a patient off sirolimus without clinical or biopsy evidence 
of rejection.   
2.2 Secondary Objectives

3 STUDY DESIGN AND EVALUATION 
3.1 Study Design  
This will be a single -center, open -label, non-randomized, proof -of-concept study  in 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_239998]  (DDRTs). Twenty  renal transplant 
patients will be enrolled , at least [ADDRESS_291398] one year. Patients’ absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) and percent 
expression T cell of Ki67 will be assessed monthly. After one year of therapy, 
participants may consent to and begin sirolimus withdrawal or continue therapy through 
study close. Patients wishing to withdraw from sirolimus will begin sirolimus weaning 
when their ALC has reached at least 80% of baseline and had two consecutive monthly assessments of their percent expression of Ki67 fall within at least one standard deviation of the Ki67 expression of a healthy control population. Weaning will be triggered of the Ki67 expression, with other surface phenotype assessments being followed observationally. Patients meeting these parameters will be  weaned off of sirolimus by 
[CONTACT_240056]/or increasing the dosing interval over at least a three-month period. 
Each dose reduction will require stable (within [ADDRESS_291399] deviation) peripheral Ki67 expression. After sirolimus is discontinued, patients will remain on belatacept 
monotherapy indefinitely.  Clinical and mechanistic observation will continue for the 
duration of the study to assess the efficacy and safety of this approa ch. Subjects will be 
followed for at least five years.  
Duration of Study  
Subjects will be followed for at least five years.  Belatacept is now approved by [CONTACT_1622] . 
Therefore, subjects remaining on belatacept at the conclusion of their  five-year 
participatio n would be eligible to continue this therapy. If at the conclusion of this study  
belatacept is not commercially available to patients, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_239999]. If subjects are successfully weaned from sirolimus as a result  of their 
participation in this protocol, there will be no need for consideration of alternative therapy.

Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- [ADDRESS_291401] year. However, with the liberalization of the inclusion criteria, it is anticipated that an acute reje ction rate 
prior to initiation of sirolimus withdrawal of up to 20% will exist, excluding up to four 
patients from eligibility for sirolimus withdrawal.  It also is anticipated that four 
additional patients will either not meet other criteria for withdrawal or will refuse to be withdrawn from immunosuppression.  The number of patients has therefore been chosen 
to have approximately [ADDRESS_291402] in whom withdrawal is atte mpted being successfully 
withdrawn from sirolimus for one year is 50%, a rate determined by [CONTACT_240057].  
Since there are no trials exploring monotherapy belatacept reported in the literature or 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, this cohort of patients  withdrawn successfully will 
represent a significant finding.  
3.5 Interim Analyses  
No interim analysis is planned. 
4 STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
4.1 Data Set Descriptions  
A summary of all patient data will be kept in a study database developed for this study. In 
addition to the experimental data, this database will include recipi[INVESTIGATOR_240000] (comorbidities, HLA type, etc.), graft functio n, immunosuppressive medications and levels, and a running summary of the 
patient’s post transplant course. Data will be recorded and reported in accordance with 
the standards required by [CONTACT_144012] (UNOS ). The data set 
will consist of all patients who are randomized and transplanted and will be used for al l

Efficacy Analyses 
No formal statistical hypothesis testing will be performed  for the primary endpoint.  All 
efficacy analyses will generally be descriptive in nature. The primary efficacy analysis 
will be to assess the proportion of patients successfully withdrawn from  sirolimus for one 
year.  The point estimate of this proportion and the exact two -sided 95% confidence 
interval (CI) will be provided for each treatment group.  A patient will be considered to 
be successfully withdrawn from  immunosuppression for one year if the patient has been 
administered only belatacept for a period of [ADDRESS_291405], two -sided 95% CIs by [CONTACT_1570]. Other secondary efficacy 
outcome measures will be descriptively summarized by [CONTACT_240071].

6   Study Therapy  
6.1 Transplant- specific therapi[INVESTIGATOR_240002] (in pre -op holding or the operating room) patients will be 
given a single dose of methylprednisolone [ADDRESS_291412]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539  
Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- 036 Page 25 of 93 engraftment. An 18- gauge needle core biopsy will be obtained from the allografted 
kidney 30 minutes to 1 hour after reperfusion. These will be divided for routine histology, 
immunohistochemistry (2/3 of biopsy) and RT -PCR analysis (1/3 of biopsy) snap frozen 
on site. Patients will be cared for perioperatively on the transplant unit. Technical aspects of the postoperative management (Foley catheterization, ureteral stenting, etc) will be according to the standard of care as determined by [CONTACT_17925].   
Belatacept  
Belatacept will be given within 24 hours of transplantation via a peripheral intravenous catheter at a dose of 10mg/kg infused over 30 minutes. The dose will be repeated on study days 4 (post op day 3) and 8 (post op day 7),  then every 2 weeks for 5 additional 
doses. Thereafter, belatacept will be given once every 4 weeks (+/ - 3 days) at 10mg/kg 
through 6 months then at 5mg/kg indefinitely . 
Sirolimus  
Sirolimus will be started on postoperative day 1 at a dose of 2 mg per day orally. Doses will be adjusted to maintain 24 hour trough levels of 8- 10ng/ml until the drug is weaned 
as described below.  Sirolimus has been associated with delayed graft function in organs 
affected by [CONTACT_240074].  Therefore, in the unlikely event that patients experience delayed graft function (<5% of live donor transplants experience delayed graft function), defined as inadequate renal function to avoid dialysis by [CONTACT_447] -operative day 7, 
maintenance therapy will be changed to mycophenolate mofe til (1.5 gm twice daily) and 
prednisone (30mg daily) until graft function improves.  Patients will then be converted to sirolimus.  
Toxicity attributable to sirolimus (e.g. mouth ulcers, arthralgias) will prompt dose reduction to address clinical concerns i n this regard. If sirolimus trough levels need to be 
reduced below 4ng/ml to control drug side effects, the patient will be considered 
intolerant to the drug and will be changed to mycophenolate mofetil (1.0 gm twice daily) 
and prednisone (30mg  – 20mg da ily tapered to off over 1-3 months depending on the 
time from transplantation). Patients on prednisone and mycophenolate will be considered for weaning based on the criteria described below.  
Prophylaxis 
With the exception of the immunosuppressive drugs used, perioperative care will be administered in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_239980]. This will include post -
operative viral (oral valganciclovir in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_240003] -operative 
donor and recipi[INVESTIGATOR_98354]), fungal (ora l nystatin or clotrimazole), and bacterial 
prophylaxis (perioperative surgical prophylaxis transitioning to oral Pneumocystis prophylaxis) dosed for [ADDRESS_291413] transplantation. All prophylaxis agents will be withdrawn at 6 months unless there are specif ic clinical indications otherwise.  
6.2 Maintenance Immunosuppressive Reduction  
Beginning any time after year 1 (week 53), participants who are deemed eligible for sirolimus withdrawal as determined by [CONTACT_240075]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539  
Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- 036 Page 26 of 93 (described belo w) may be withdrawn from sirolimus. Withdrawal will proceed at a 
maximum rate of 66% of the original dose for 4 weeks, 33% of the original dose for 
another 4 weeks, then discontinued. However, each reduction in dose will be predicated on stable flow cytome tric profile.   
Criteria for Sirolimus Withdrawal. Participants will be deemed eligible for withdrawal of 
sirolimus if they meet all of the following criteria:   
1. No epi[INVESTIGATOR_240004], and no epi[INVESTIGATOR_240005] 12 months.  
2. Stable renal function, as defined by [CONTACT_240076]: a. GFR, using calculated CrCl (Cockcroft- Gault) of > 40ml/min.  
b. Creatinine, which in the 12 weeks preceding withdrawal has not increased more than 20% with respect to the lowest creatinine observed during the same period. 
c.    Absence of histologic evidence of acute or chronic rejection on pre- withdrawal 
renal biopsy according to the Banff criteria for acute, chronic and humoral rejection. 
3. Absence of DSA reactivity, as measured by [CONTACT_240077]-donor- HLA antibodies. 
4. ALC at least 80% of the baseline ALC prior to alemtuzumab. 
5. Ki67 expression on CD3+ T cells that is within [ADDRESS_291414] deviation of the normal expression in untreated controls. Ki67 is typi[INVESTIGATOR_240006] <3% of lymphocytes in health controls and a value >5% exceeds the value accepted for purposes of this trial.  
For determining eligibility, a renal biopsy will be obtained and creatinine clearance will be estimated. Requisite blood samples will be obtained within t wo weeks before starting 
sirolimus withdrawal.  Results of laboratory asse ssments of immune status will be made 
available to, and reviewed by, the investigator.  These data will be reviewed with the knowledge of previous results of immunosuppression withdrawal obtained in the current trial up to the time of review.  
Maintenance Immunosuppressive Therapy 
Patients who are weaned from sirolimus will be maintained on belatacept 5mg/kg once per month +/ - [ADDRESS_291415]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

cataracts, osteoporosis, hypertension, hemolytic uremic syndrome, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], insulin requiring diabetes, and renal insufficiency and do not completely eliminate the risk of graft rejection. Organs transplanted from other individuals may carry infectious agents that may cause disease in the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. Organs are screened for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, EBV and CMV. Organs are not used if they are found to be positive for HIV or hepatitis. Prophylactic agents are used to limit infectious disease.  
All transplantation using treatment with alemtuzumab/belatacept/sirolimus instead of conventional immunosuppression will continue to be associated with the operative and general risks listed above. The experimental data suggest that the risk of wound complications may be less with steroid sparing protocols than with conventional therapy, 
but this remains to be proven and could still be significant or even increased in association with sirolimus.  
7.5 Risks for Women of Child- bearing Potential  
As of July of 2010, two healthy volunteers became pregnant at 12 months and 15 months, respectively, after a single dose of subcutaneous belatacept given in Phase 1 trial. Both pregnancies resulted in normal births. Only one woman with a kidney transplant had become pregnant after 7 years of belatacept treatment in a clinical trial. She has an induced abortion at approximately 8 weeks of pregnancy without complications.   All other pregnancies in the kidney transplantation trials were in partners of subjects, with a total of 15 pregnancies in 12 partners treated with belatacept (10 normal births, 2 spontaneous abortions, and 3 without neonatal outcomes reported).

Hypertriglyceridemia predominates.  HMG -CoA reductase in hibitors and fibric acid have 
been used and well tolerated to counteract the hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_240012].  Additionally, the unexpected finding of nephrotoxicity has been encountered but is likely attributable to sirolimus’ potentiation of CNI  nephrotoxicity and thus is likely to be 
inapplicable in this trial.  Other common events reported in trials include leukopenia, hypertension, anemia, nausea, vomiting, elevated liver enzymes, rash and acne  [37,38]  Other risks from the package insert for  sirolimus include possible development of 
lymphoma and other malignancies, particularly of the skin, increased susceptibility to infection including opportunistic  infections, fatal infections, and sepsis, and lymphocele, a known surgical complication of renal transplantation, occurring significantly more 
often in a dose- related fashion in sirolimus -treated patients.  
Belatacept  in Kidney Transplant Study  
Specific risks associated with belatacept may include those typi[INVESTIGATOR_240013].  
Over [ADDRESS_291431] received belatacept in clinical trials. Patients in these 
trials received belatacept or cyclosporine (a marketed drug for comparison), in addition to basiliximab,  mycophenolate mofetil (MMF  also known as CellCept ), which is an 
immunosuppressant, and steroids to prevent transplant rejection. In general, patients treated with belatacept had the same overall rate of side effects, including infections and cancers, as p atients who received cyclosporine. In the first [ADDRESS_291432] commonly reported side -effects 
(in ≥ 20% of subjects) among belatacept subjects were urinary tract infection, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, swelling, decrease in transplanted kidney function, fever, cough, high blood pressure, and low white blood cells count. Some side effects were s erious and 
required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  Some were fatal. Some side effects were serious and required hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Some were fatal.  
 
Post-transplant Lymphoproliferative Disorder  
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), a tumor of white blood cells that 
can occur after kidney transplantation, developed more frequently in patients who received belatacept (14 cases out of 949; 1.5% of subjects) than those who received cyclosporine (3 cases out of 476; 0.6%). In addition, more than half of the PTL D cases in 
belatacept patients involved the brain (9 cases out of 14; 65% of belatacept patients), which is a higher proportion than expected. A total of 11 of 17 subjects with PTLD died; 8 out of 14 in the belatacept group and 3 out of 3 in the cyclospori ne group.  
 PTLD is known to occur after transplant in approximately 1% of adults and is almost always associated with the Epstein -Barr virus (EBV). NULOJIX® (belatacept) is 
contraindicated in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_240014] -Barr virus (EBV) sero nega tive

disorder (PTLD), predominantly involving the central nervous system (CNS).  As the 
total burden of immunosuppression is a risk factor for PTLD, higher than the 
recommended doses or more frequent dosing of Nulojix and higher than recommended 
doses of concomitant immunosuppressive agents are not recommended. Physicians should consider PTLD in patients reporting new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms.   The risk of PTLD was higher in EBV sero negative patients compared to EBV seropositive patients. EBV seropositive patients are defined as having  evidence of 
acquired immunity shown by [CONTACT_234936] (VCA) and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA). Epstein -Barr virus serology will be 
ascertained before starting administration of Nulojix, and only patients who are EBV seropositive will receive Nulojix. Transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_240015], or with unknown serostatus, should not receive Nulojix.   Other known risk factors for PTLD include cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and T -cell-
depleting therapy. T -cell-depleting therapi[INVESTIGATOR_240016]. CMV prophylaxis is recommended for at least 3 months after transplantation.  Patients who are EBV seropositive and CMV seronegative may be at increased risk for PTLD compared to patients who are EBV seropositive and CMV seropositive. Since CMV seronegative patients are at increased risk for CMV disease (a known risk factor for 
PTLD), the clinical significance of CMV serology for PTLD remains to be determined; however, these findings should be considered when prescribing Nulojix.  The physician will perform tests to see if the patient has antibodies to EBV. If the patient  
does not have antibodies to the virus, they  will not be allowed to enroll in the study.  If 
they do have antibodies to the virus, the physician will counsel them about their risk of 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_240017].  Additional monitoring and the use of anti-viral medications may be 
prescribed by [CONTACT_240082]. 
Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is known to be associated with the 
degree of immunosuppression. It occurs in approximately 0.7% of adults and up to 4.5%  
of children following transplantation [39-42]. This condition can give rise to lymphoma 
in over 50% of those patients in which it oc curs. The relative risk of this condition 
compared to conventional therapy in humans is not known but  should be reduced 
substantially by [CONTACT_240083].  
PTLD Safety Surveillance 
Special surveillance for PTLD will be considered for all subjects in this study.  The PTLD safety surveillance should be implemented as soon as IRB/IEC approval and subject consent are obtained.  
Subjects with S uspected PTLD  
CNS imaging and/or neurologic consultation should be considered for any subject with a new or worsening neurologic finding.  For subjects who undergo biopsy for suspi[INVESTIGATOR_240018]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

EBER. Management of belatacept and other immunosuppressants in subjects with 
suspected PTLD should be discussed with the BMS Medical Monitor.  BMS should be informed of all confirmed cases of PTLD.     
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)  
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is an often rapi[INVESTIGATOR_240019], a human polyoma virus. In clinical trials with Nulojix, two cases of PML were reported in patients receiving Nulojix at higher cumulative doses and more frequently than the recommended regimen, along with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids; one case occurred in a kidney transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_240020] a liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841]. As PML has been associated with high levels of overall immunosuppression, the recommended doses and frequency of Nulojix and concomitant immunosuppressives, including MMF, should not be exceeded.   Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioral signs or symptoms. PML is usually diagnosed by [CONTACT_14548], cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF) testing for  JC viral DNA by 
[CONTACT_940] (PCR), and/or brain biopsy. Consultation with a specialist (e.g., neurologist and/or infectious disease) should be considered for any suspected or confirmed cases of PML.  
 If PML is diagnosed, consideration should be given to reduction or withdrawal of immunosuppression taking into account the risk to the allograft.

At the time of transplantation, donor samples will be obtained from 120 ml heparinized whole blood from live donors, and a similar amount of blood or spleen or lymph node from deceased donors. Lymphocytes will be procured and cryopreserved by [CONTACT_240085] (see Resources).  Lymphocytes will only be used for

least every two weeks until they reach their one-year evaluation. Lymphocyte 
repopulation and specific Ki67 and T REG and B TRANS phenotypes will be assessed 
monthly until 1 year after sirolimus elimination, and then every 3  months through 5 years 
by [CONTACT_227976] 7ml of heparinized blood by [CONTACT_4133].  
Biopsy Monitoring. A protocol biopsy will be performed following allograft reperfusion . 
Additional protocol biopsies will be performed at 6 months, and when the criteria for weaning to monotherapy belatacept  are met (generally this will be during the second post 
transplant year ) and again when the patient has been weaned to monotherapy belatacept 
for three months. An additional biopsy will be performed one year after weaning off 
sirolimus. It is assumed that histological acute allograft rejection is indicative of under -
immunosuppression. Since histological rejection has been documented to occur in the absence of clinical renal dysfunction (so -called sub -clinical rejection) in up to 30% of 
persons with stable allograft function, it is reasonable to assume that some patients studied in this trial will have sub -clinical reje ction, and thus be inappropriate for further 
immunosuppressive reduction. Protocol biopsies are thus clinically indicated to pre- empt 
inappropriate immunosuppressive weaning, as well as to detect other occult pathology

A follow-up biopsy will be performed in 3 months to assess resolution of subclinical rejection. Subclinical rejection, once resolved, will not in and of itself remove the patient from consideratio n of weaning, if it occurs during a period of homeostatic repopulation.  
Renal biopsies also will be performed if any sustained rise in serum creatinine of greater 
than or equal to 30% of the baseline creatinine is detected. Baseline creatinine will be defined as the mean of five stable serum creatinine values within the first three months 
post-transplant.  Stable is defined as a variance of +/ - 20% or less of any value.  Clinical 
suspi[INVESTIGATOR_240021] (urine cytology, pyur ia, 
proteinuria, etc.) also  will be considered grounds for biopsy at the discretion of the 
attending physician. An attending transplant physician or surgeon will perform all biopsies. The risks of transplant kidney biopsy will be included in the informed consent process for the protocol. At the time of each biopsy (protocol or clinically indicated), blood will be drawn for peripheral phenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_240022] (50ml heparinized). 
Patients will be evaluated for cellular alloreactivity, donor-specific hyporesponsiveness 
and viral specific responsiveness pre -operatively, at the time that sirolimus withdrawal 
commences, 3  months after sirolimus withdrawal, at the time of clinical rejections, and at 
study termination . This will require 50ml of heparinized blood to be drawn at these time 
points and cryopreserved for analysis.

other medical personnel with sufficient knowledge of transplantation to interpret the ongoing progress of the trial. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_240026], and data pertinent to patient recruiting and outcome. The Board will meet annually and convey its recommendations in writing to the Sponsor-
investigator and Principal Investigator .. DSMB reports will be submitted to the 
Institutional Review Board per IRB requirements  and meeting minutes will be 
disseminated to all necessary parties.  
All adverse events will be reviewed weekly in a multidisciplinary format that will involve review by a transplant surgeon, a transplant physician, and other members of the 
transplant staff. All Serious Adverse Events will be reviewed within the accepted guidelines and submitted to the appropriate regulatory bodies governing this study.  
Renal failure has many known complications. Pre -existing conditions, which progress in 
keepi[INVESTIGATOR_240027], will not be expeditiously reported. This protocol is not 
designed to influence those pre existing complications in any way. Therefore, only acute exacerbations that deviate from their natural history will be reported.  
11.3 Collection of Safety Information 
An Adverse Event (AE)  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a investigational (medicinal) product (IP), whether or not considered related to the IP.  
During clinical trials, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during 
open-ended questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent 
reporting bias, subjects should not be  questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one 
or more adverse events.)  
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all serious AEs should be collected, including those thought to be associated with clinical trial procedures. The 
collection of non- serious AE information should begin at initiation of investigational 
product. Non- serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo 
lead-in period or other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for the 
subjects. Following study completion, any SAE thought to be related to study drug or clinical trial procedures should also be reported. 
Certain adverse events occur commonly in this study population and will not be recorded 
as an adverse event, unless it is believed to be associated with the study medications 
(Alemtuzumab , Sirolimus , Belatacept) and/or it meets the definition of a serious adverse

• Isolated epi[INVESTIGATOR_119999], constipation, nausea, abdominal distention and 
vomiting.  
• Hypokalemia/hyperkalemia, hyponatremia/hypernatreima, hypocalcemia,/

• Peripheral edema  
• Hematuria, proteinuria, glycosuria and dysuria. 
• Headache, dizz iness, tremor, insomnia, anxiety, fatigue and depression.  
• AVF thrombosis and renal artery stenosis. 
• Incontinence, hydronephrosis, hematoma, lymphocele, musculoskeletal pain, and 
atrial fibrillation.  
• Acne, facial/body rash, and folliculitis.  
 
Data on concomitant medications will be collected only if they are related to the 
treatment of a serious adverse or adverse event  that is probably , possibly, or definitely 
related to study medications. All identified AEs must be recorded and described on the 
appropriate Non-serious or Serious AE page of the CRF. If known, the diagnosis of the 
underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather than its individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: date (and time) of onset and resolution, severity of the event (see definitions), Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_240028] (see definitions), treatment required for the AE, cause of the event (if known), and information regarding resolution/outcome. The 
Investigator shall supply the Sponsor and Ethics Committee with any additional 
requested information, notably for reported deaths of subjec ts. 
The following categories and definitions of severity should be used: 
•  
Grading Criteria  
The study site will grade the severity of adverse events experienced by [CONTACT_240089]’s Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version (CTCAE). This document (referred to herein as the NCI -CTCAE manual) p rovides a common language to describe levels of 
severity, to analyze and interpret data, and to articulate the clinical significance of all adverse events   
 
Adverse events will be graded on a scale from [ADDRESS_291453]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539  
Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- 036 Page 48 of 93 NCI-CTCAE manual:  
 
• Grade 1 = mild adverse event. (Awareness of event but easily tolerate.)  
• Grade 2 = moderate adverse event  (Discomfort enough to cause some interferences     
with usual activity)  
• Grade 3 = severe and undesirable adverse event . (Inability to carry  out usual activity).  
• Grade 4 = life -threatening or disabling adverse event..(Debilitating significantly 
incapacitates subject despi[INVESTIGATOR_4795]).  
• Grade 5 =Death  
 
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to study drug should be 
used: 
• Certain:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. 
The event responds to withdrawal of study drug (dechallenge), and recurs with 
rechallenge when clinically feasible.  
• Probable:  There is a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the 
AE. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not required. 
• Possible:  There is reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear.  
• Not likely: T here is a temporal relationship to study drug administration, but there is 
not a reasonable causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
• Not related :  There is not a temporal relationship to study drug administration (too 
early, or late, or study drug not taken), or there is a reasonable causal relationship 
between another drug, concurrent disease, or circumstance and the AE.  
Adverse Events Related to Study Conditions 
If the Investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the investigational product, but is 
potentially related to the conditions of the study, (such as withdrawal of previous therapy, or complication of a trial procedure), the relationship should be specified in the narrative 
section of the SAE page of the CRF.

follow-up as appropriate. If an ongoing AE changes in its severity or in its perceived 
relationship to study drug, a new AE entry for the event should be completed.

SAE which may occur after this time period which they believe to be certainly, probably or possibly related to investigational product.  Finally, all events of death, graft loss, malignancy, PTLD, and serious infections (i.e., otherwise meeting SAE reporting requirements) must be reported for all randomized subjects until the end of the study, irrespective of study drug discontinuation or investigator- deemed causality.  
11.7 Handling of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
A serious AE  or reaction  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• results in death,  
• is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the patient or subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hy pothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe),  
• requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], (refer to 
note for exceptions), 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
• is a congenital anom aly/birth defect,  
• is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313], based upon 
appropriate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the patient/subje ct or 
may require intervention (e.g., medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed in the definition above.)   
NOTE: 
• Pregnancy:   Incidence of pregnancy is not considered a SAE; pregnancy must, 
however, be reported immediately using the BMS Pregnancy Surveillance Form  
• Cancer/Overdose:  All cases of cancer and overdose must be reported immediately 
using the SAE Report Form.  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] (exceptions):  Criteria for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_240029]: 
o Planned as per protocol medical/surgical procedure  
o Routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status documentation (e.g., routine colonoscopy) 
o Medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state (planned prior to entry into study trial; appropriate documentation required)  
o Admission encountered for other life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (e.g. lack of

administrative)  
An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its status 
of seriousness. 
Adverse events classified as “serious” require expeditious handling and reporting to BMS to comply with regulatory requirements.  
All serious AEs whether related or unrelated to investigational product, must be 
immediately reported to BMS (or designee) by [CONTACT_204188].  If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required.  The original 
SAE form must be kept on file at the study site.  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND, any event that is both serious and unexpected must be reported to the FDA as soon as possible and, in no event, later than 7 days (death or life -threatening event) or 15 days (all other SAEs) after the investigator’s 
or institution’s initial receipt of the information.  Bristol- Myers Squibb will be provided 
with a simultaneous copy via facsimile of all adverse events filed with the FDA.  SAEs 
should be reported on the MedWatch Form 3500A, which can be accessed at: 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/MedWatch/
 
MedWatch forms should be sent to the FDA online at the above internet address or at: 
MEDWATCH  
[ADDRESS_291457] Rockville, MD  [ZIP_CODE] Fax:  1-800- FDA-0178 ([PHONE_176]) 
 
Cases of pregnancy must be reported on paper Pregnancy Surveillance Forms in lieu of SAE pages . 
Collection of complete information concerning SAEs is extremely important. Thus, follow-up information which becomes available as the SAE evolves, as well as 
supporting documentation (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_219475]), should be collected subsequentl y, if not available at the time of the initial report, and 
immediately sent using the same procedure as the initial SAE report.  
In accordance with local regulations, Investigators will be notified of all AEs that are serious, unexpected, and certainly, probably, or possibly related to the investigational product or serious reportable adverse events which could be associated with the trial procedures. This notification will be in the form of an Expedited Safety Report (ESR).  
Upon receiving such notices, the  Investigator must review and retain the ESR with the 
Investigator Brochure. Where required by [CONTACT_34342] a central 
Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) for the study, the Sponsor will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The Investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if the informed consent requires revision. The Investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other safety information.

Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- [ADDRESS_291458] Abnormalities 
At a minimum, the following laboratory abnormalities should be captured on the non-
serious or serious AE pages of the CRF as appropriate: 
• Any laboratory test result that meets the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event  
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject to have investigational product 
discontinued or interrupted 
• Any laboratory abnormality that requires the subject to receive specific corrective therapy, that is not seen commonly in the study population as previously defined. 
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical, rather than the laboratory term would 
be used by [CONTACT_72943] (e.g., anemia versus low hemoglobin value). 
11.9 Other Safety Considerations  
Any clinically significant changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not 
these procedures are required by [CONTACT_760], should also be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the CRF (i.e., NON- SERIOUS or SERIOUS).

• General Information  
• Informed Consent Form 
• Pregnancy Prevention Information Sheet 
• Drug Interactions with Hormonal Contraceptives 
• Contraceptives in Current Use 
• Guidelines for the Follow-up of a Reported Pregnancy 
Prior to study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding 
pregnancy during trial participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.

Pregnancy testing must also be performed periodically  throughout the study  and the 
results of all pregnancy tests (positive or negative) recorded on the case report form. 
In addition, all WOCBP should be instructed to contact [CONTACT_240090] (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.

Exceptions to investigational product discontinuation may be considered for life -threatening conditions only after consultation with the BMS 
Medical Monitor or as otherwise specified in this protocol. The Investigator must immediately notify the BMS Medical Monitor of this event and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Pregnancy Surveillance Forms are forwarded to BMS .  
Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
on the subject unless contraindicated by [CONTACT_8663] (e.g., x- ray studies). Other appropriat e 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. In addition, the 
Investigator must report to BMS, on the appropriate BMS pregnancy surveillance forms(s), follow -up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including 
perinatal and neonatal outcome. Infants should be followed for a minimum of eight weeks.

APPENDIX B: ASSAYS F OR THE DETERMINATION  OF ALLOREACTIVITY  
The following assays will be performed to asse ss the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]’ general ability to mount 
an alloreactive response, and the specific ability to mount a response toward the donor. 
The development of assays for determining alloresponsiveness is an ongoing process and other assays may be considered as they become available.  
We will use multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) panels (see table below) that we have established and standardized as part of the original trial, and also harmonized in support of the NIH-sponsored CTOT ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] and [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) and CTOTC-02 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) transplant consortia. Our standardization of these MFC panels allows our unique patients to be placed in the context of multiple other immunosuppressive regimens including standard CNI- based approaches. The panels are designed to  
determine the degree to which patients’ T cells are predominantly naïve (CD45RA
+, 
CCR7+), effector memory (T EM; CD45RA-, CCR7-), central memory (T C; CD45RA-, 
CCR7+), terminal effector (T EFF; CD45RA+, CCR7-), exhausted (T EX; CD57-, PD-1+) or 
senescent (T SEN; CD57+, PD-1-). In addition to phenotypic markers distinguishing naïve 
from more differentiated cells, our flow panels include surface and intracellular molecules that regulate T cell migration (CCR7 and CCR5), cytotoxic potential (perforin, 
granzyme), recent thymic emigration (RTE; CD103, CCR5), activation status (CD38, 
HLA-DR, CD45RA/RO, CD28), susceptibility to apoptosis (BCL- 2), proliferation (Ki -
67), association with regulatory functions (FoxP3 and CD103), and B cell maturation (IgD, IgM, CD19, CD27). T
REGS will be defined as CD3+CD4+,CD25+, FoxP3+ cells 
derived from the live cell, lymphocyte forward and side scatter gate. B TRANS will be 
defined as CD3-, CD19+, IgD+, CD38hi cells derived from the live cell, lymphocyte 
forward and side scatter gate. Perce
ntage data will be derived directly and absolute cell counts will be extrapolated using the simultaneously drawn complete blood counts with differential accessed through merger of the Laboratory Information Management Software (LIMS) file with data from the Clinical Data Warehouse (see Resources). Assessments of baseline and subsequent values will be based on percentage data rather than absolute cell count, hypothesizing that ratios are more relevant after [ADDRESS_291477]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

In addition to clinical parameters (rejection, viremia), we will continue to evaluate alloreactive potential against donor and third party alloantigens, and viral specific T cell reactivity against CMV and EBV in vitro at time points indicated in 
the experimental plan above. This is vital to gain insight into the antigen specificity of any treatment effect. As discussed in the Preliminary Studies section, we are beginning to see elimination of donor allo-responsiveness but maintenance of non-donor responsiveness and CMV responsiveness. Quantitative in vitro measures of this repertoire migration are vital to understanding the durability of any observed clinical phenotype that emerges.   
We will continue to measure the proliferation of CFSE-loaded CD4 and CD8 T cells responding to antigenic stimulation by [CONTACT_240094] (in the form of T cell depleted lymphocytes), and immuno-dominant peptide pools for CMV and EBV as shown in the Preliminary Studies. Briefly, frozen recipi[INVESTIGATOR_240042] (Renovar Inc., Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Responder CFSE- labeled PBMC will be co -cultured with mitomycin -c treated donor or

and RAKFKQLL peptides) to assess CD8 responses. By [CONTACT_240095], it is possible to determine the phenotype of the virus-specific T cells and quantify them to a sensitivity of 0.03% of CD8 T cells. Second, 
we analyze the function (CD107a/degranulation) and cytokine expression (IFN- γ, TNF-α 
and IL-2) of antigen -specific CD4 and CD8 T cells as we have previously 
described.

Transcriptional Studies. Peripheral blood (7.5 ml) will continue to be drawn into EDTA 
tubes at the times indicated in the protocol (Appendix A). Cells will be ficol separated and placed in 100 µl of RNAlater (Ambion) in a sterile, RNAase- free 2.5 ml freezing 
tube, placed on ice at 4°C and frozen at -80°C within four hours. We routinely process microarray -grade RNA from peripheral blood with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_240044] 5-10 mcg/2.5mls 
blood. Renal biopsies will be obtained at the times indicated in the protocol as two 18-gauge needle core biopsies. The cores will be split with two halves sent for histological processing and two halves immediately transferred into 100 µl of RNAlater in a sterile, RNAase-free 2.5 ml freezing tube, placed on ice at 4°C and frozen at -80°C within four 
hours. These samples will be stored for batched analysis. Two halves of the core biopsies will be processed locally for diagnostic purposes. Two stained (H/E, PAS) slides will be forwarded to pathology for centralized light microscopic analysis and quantitative Banff scoring. Four unstained slides will be forwarded to the Emory pathology lab for immunohistochemistry (CD3, CD20, CD56, and C4d).  
In the first iteration of the trial, we proposed transcriptional analysis of blood and biopsy material and indeed have collected samples that we will evaluate as described n the initial study. These assays have been batched for analysis at the completion of the study as batch variation markedly alters interpretation of array-type transcriptional analysis. We will continue collection of samples as per our established protocol. Briefly, clinical samples will be procured and processed to RNA and PCR LDAs will be performed in the PI’s lab. These arrays will be pros pectively evaluated for their ability to segregate clinical 
outcomes in protocol patients and related to previously studied patients transplanted under standard of care immunosuppression. We have ample published experience with RT-PCR (TaqMan) in transplantation.
124-126 Total RNA will be reverse transcribed to 
cDNA using TaqMan reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and amplified (50oC 
for 2min, 99oC for 10min, 40 cycles at 99oC for 15sec and 60oC for 1min) using 384- well 
LDAs (Applied Biosystems) or as individual target assays as necessary. Each 
amplification will be performed in quadruplicate and the mean values of quadruplicate assays will serve as the reported value. All samples will be compared to a pooled sample of cDNA from our established homogenous reference for normal kidney (pre-procurement live donor biopsy). Data will be analyzed and reported as described.

INVESTIGATIONAL PROGRAM  
Given that the investigational agent used in this trial is belatacept, comprehensive 
information is provided regarding its use to date. 
Preclinical Data  
Belatacept binds weakly to murine B7 molecules, and therefore, cannot be studied in 
rodent models of immune -mediated diseases or trans plantation. The parent molecule of 
belatacept, CTLA4Ig, was therefore utilized in various rodent, non- human primate, and 
ex vivo T -cell proliferation assay human experiments to determine the potency of 
belatacept compared with CTLA4Ig. A more extensive des cription of these studies is 
available in the IB; the pertinent findings are summarized below.  
Efficacy:  
• Belatacept shows ~ 2 -fold greater binding avidity than CTLA4Ig for human CD80 
and ~ 4-fold greater binding avidity than CTLA4Ig for human CD86 
• Belatacept is approximately 10- fold more effective in vitro on a per -dose basis than 
CTLA4Ig at inhibiting T -cell proliferation, T -cell cytokine production, and 
CD28-dependent killing of target cells by [CONTACT_113921] -like cells 
• In an allogeneic mixed -leukocyte cu lture assay under secondary allostimulation 
conditions, belatacept was approximately 5 - to 7-fold more potent than CTLA4Ig at 
blocking interleukin (IL)- 2, IL-4, and interferon-  T-cell cytokine production 
• In an in vivo primate immune response model, belatacept potently blocked a primary 
antibody response against sheep red blood cells. At equivalent doses, belatacept was 
3- to 11-fold more potent (by [CONTACT_5883] 90) than CTLA4Ig at blocking specific humoral 
responses 
• Belatacept was found to be efficacious for the prevention of graft rejection in 
cynomolgus monkeys, a non- human primate model of renal transplantation  
• Belatacept monotherapy was superior to a regimen of CsA + corticosteroids in the 
prolongation of graft survival in a stringent primate renal transplant model 
• A regimen of belatacept + MMF + corticosteroids and a regimen of belatacept + 
basiliximab demonstrated efficacy (ie, prolongation of graft survival) superior to belatacept monotherapy as well as that historically observed in monkeys treated with CsA + co rticosteroids  
• Analysis of pharmacokinetic (PK) data in monkeys suggested a relationship between 
trough serum drug concentrations and immunosuppressive efficacy 
• Treatment with belatacept, alone or in combination with basiliximab, did not result in long-term tolerance to the donor graft. Therefore, it appears likely that chronic 
intermittent dosing of belatacept is required for optimal long -term prophylaxis of 
rejection 
• In an islet cell transplant model, treatment of [ADDRESS_291485]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539  
Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- 036 Page 72 of 93 > [ADDRESS_291486], a control regimen of sirolimus and anti -IL-2 receptor yielded 
islet cell allograft survival of only 7 days.  
 
Safety: 
The nonclinical safety assessment of belatacept was performed in the cynomolgus 
monkey. As noted previously, belatacept is a 2- amino acid variant of CTLA4Ig. 
Although the mutations in belatacept increase binding affinity in primates compared to CTLA4Ig, the binding affinity for murine CD80 and CD86 is lower with belatacept than it is with abatacept, and belatacept has approximately 10% of the activity of CTLA4Ig in an in vitro murine spleen cell bioassay. Since CTLA4Ig, which is active in mice, binds more avidly than does belatacept in m ice and it is very similar to belatacept in both its 
mechanism of action and its structure, CTLA4Ig is considered an acceptable homologue for belatacept for rodent toxicology assessments to support registration requirements. A more thorough description of these studies is available in the IB; the pertinent findings 
are summarized below.  
• No drug-related toxicity was observed in a single -dose intravenous (i.v.) toxicity 
study using cynomolgus monkeys given belatacept at doses of up to 90 mg/kg 
• Belatacept was well tolerated when given i.v. to monkeys at doses up to 50 mg/kg 
every other day for 1 month (15 doses) or once weekly for 6 months (26 doses). The major nonclinical findings in monkeys with belatacept were reversible, related to the pharmacology of the drug, and consisted of minimal decreases in serum IgG levels and minimal- to-moderate lymphoid depletion of germinal centers in the spleen and/or 
lymph nodes at all dose levels. Similar observations were noted for CTLA4Ig when administered to monkeys at doses up to 50 mg/kg once weekly for 1 year (52 doses)  
• No adverse cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], or neurological effects have been detected in 
any of the single - or repeat-dose toxicity studies of belatacept when given to monkeys 
for up to 6 months. In addition, no belatacept -related changes were observed in 
plasma or serum levels of histamine, complement (C3a), tumor necrosis factor -α, or 
IL-6 (mediators associated with hemodynamic changes and anaphylactoid responses) 
• CTLA4Ig was not found to be mutagenic or cla stogenic when tested at maximum 
concentrations recommended by [CONTACT_240097]  
• In studies conducted with CTLA4Ig, the major safety concern identified relates to the 
potential for an increased incidence of virally -induced tumors in the presence of 
long-term immunomodulation. In a mouse carcinogenicity study, increases in the 
incidence of lymphoma and mammary gland tumors were observed at human 
exposure multiples of 0.8- and 1.9-fold, respectively. In mice, murine l eukemia virus 
and mouse mammary tumor virus have been reported to cause lymphomas and mammary tumors, respectively. The presence of these viruses was confirmed in mice from this study based upon electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Data collected from these studies strongly support the conclusion that the increased 
malignancies in this study are secondary to long -term CTLA4Ig -induced 
immunomodulation and the immunological control of these specific viruses

Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- 036 Page 73 of 93 • No evidence of lymphoma, other solid tumors, or preneoplastic morphological 
changes such as lymphoid hyperplasia were observed in the 6- month monkey toxicity 
study conducted with belatacept or in the 1- year monkey toxicity study conducted 
with CTLA4Ig despi[INVESTIGATOR_240045] e CTLA4Ig study, 
which could mediate these changes  
• In i.v. embryo- fetal development studies with CTLA4Ig, no maternal or embryo- fetal 
toxicity was observed at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day in rats, 300 mg/kg/day in mice, 
or 200 mg/kg/3 days in rabbits (human exposure multiple of 30- and 29-fold for rats 
and rabbits, respectively; human exposure multiples not determined for mice). In the rat and rabbit studies, CTLA4Ig was shown to cross the placenta, indicating that fetuses from CTLA4Ig -treated dams were exposed to drug. On the basis of these data, 
CTLA4Ig was considered not teratogenic in mice, rats, or rabbits, supporting the administration of CTLA4Ig and belatacept to women of childbearing potential (WOCBP)  
• In a fertility and early embryonic development study  with CTLA4Ig in rats, there 
were no effects on reproductive function in male or female rats, and no effect on early embryonic development at doses up to 200 mg/kg administered i.v. every 3 days (human exposure multiple of 11-fold) 
• In a pre- and post-natal development study with CTLA4Ig in rats, there were no 
effects on the F
0-generation dams at doses up to 200 mg/kg administered i.v. every 3 
days (human exposure multiple of 11- fold), and no effects on the F 1-generation rats at 
≤ 45 mg/kg (human exposure multiple of 3 -fold). At 200 mg/kg, drug- related changes 
in the F 1-generation were limited to females, and consisted of an increase (9 -fold) in 
the T-cell-dependent antibody response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and moderate 
diffuse inflammation of the thyroid gland of 1 rat. These findings are considered to represent the lower threshold limit for effects of CTLA4Ig on immune parameters in the F
1-generation rats, as these changes were either limited to only 1 sex or 1 animal, 
and no other immune parameters wer e affected (splenic-lymphocyte and natural- killer 
cell phenotypes, serum Ig levels, and presence of antinuclear antibodies). 
 
Clinical Pharmacology 
A single-dose Phase 1 study with belatacept was performed in 40 healthy volunteers. 
Subjects received single i.v. infusions of either 0.1, 1, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg belatacept. At 
each dose level, 6 subjects received active drug and 2 received placebo. Analysis of the 
safety data indicates that single i.v. doses were well tolerated. No deaths or serious adverse even ts (SAEs) were reported. All reported clinical AEs were of mild or moderate 
intensity. No histamine -like peri-infusional AEs were reported. No clinically significant 
changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters were observed. There was no evidence for the development of anti -belatacept antibodies. When the dose increased in a ratio of 
1: 5: 10: 20, the geometric mean area under the concentration- time curve from time zero 
extrapolated to infinity values increased in a ratio of 1: 4.6: 9.9: 18.5; therefore , 
belatacept kinetics were found to be dose -proportional between 1 and 20 mg/kg. The 
half-life was adequately characterized between the 5 and 20 mg/kg dose levels, and 
ranged between 176 – 210 hours (7- 9 days). Following a single i.v. infusion of

steady-state volume of distribution (VSS) values were small, indicating that the drug 
(with high molecular weight) was confined mainly in the plasma and extracellular space. 
Both CLT and VSS appeared to be dose independent between the 1 and 20 mg/kg dose levels. Overall, the PK of belatacept appears to be linear following i.v. administration in healthy subjects.  
Phase [ADDRESS_291487] udy that assessed the efficacy, safety, and 
immunogenicity of multiple i.v. doses of belatacept, CTLA4Ig, and placebo in 
214 subjects with RA. Eligible subjects had a diagnosis of RA for ≤ [ADDRESS_291488] 1 disease- modifying anti- rheumatic drug  therapy, including etanercept, and had 
active disease ( ≥ 10 swollen joints, ≥ 12 tender joints, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate 
≥ 28 mm/h, and morning stiffness ≥ 45 minutes). Overall, belatacept demonstrated 
dose-dependent efficacy in this subject population, as evidenced by [CONTACT_240067]. With respect to safety, no deaths were reported during the 
treatment or follow -up period (through Day  169), and 12 subjects reported SAEs, 
although no SAEs were considered drug related by [CONTACT_473].  
Phase 2 Study in Solid Organ Transplantation  
Study Design  
Study IM103100 was a 1 -year, partially -blinded, randomized, active -controlled, multiple -
dose, multicenter non -inferiority study in de novo renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. All subjects 
received basiliximab induction and background maintenance immunosuppression with 
MMF and corticosteroids. Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with belatacept (more intensive [MI] or less intensive [LI] regimens) or CsA (open -label dosed 
twice daily to achieve a specified trough serum concentration range). Belatacept was 
administered in a double -blind fashion, with the investigator and subject blinded to the 
identity of the belatacept dose regimen. 
Belatacept subjects were dosed with 10 mg/kg on Days 1, 5, 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 113, 
141, and 169 (MI regimen) or 10 mg/kg on Days 1, 15, 29, 57, and 85 (LI regimen). Subjects were reallocated on Days  85 (LI regimen) and 169 (MI regimen) to a 5 mg/kg 
dose of the drug every 4 or 8 weeks through Day 365. 
Evaluation Criteria  
The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinically -suspected and 
biopsy-proven acute rejection (CSBPAR) at [ADDRESS_291489] -transplantation. CSBPAR was 
defined as an increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of at least 0.5 mg /dL compared to the 
baseline value in the absence of other factors known to adversely affect renal function that led the investigator to suspect acute rejection, which was then confirmed by [CONTACT_240098]-assessed biopsy. Secondary efficacy variables were the incidence of all 
biopsy-proven acute rejections, including those without an increase in SCr of at least 
0.5 mg/dL, as well as the composite endpoints of CSBPAR or presumed acute rejection and biopsy -proven acute rejection or presumed acute rejection at [ADDRESS_291490]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539  
Version: 10Jul2015                            IM103- 036 Page 75 of 93 and death and/or graft loss at 1 year. ‘Presumed acute rejection’ was defined as an 
elevation in SCr (at least 0.5 mg/dL compared to the baseline value in the absence of other factors known to adversely affect renal function) that led the investigator to suspect 
and treat the subject for acute rejection without a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, or despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a biopsy that did not confirm acute rejection. All biopsies were assessed in a blinded fashion by a central pathologist. The primary cause of graft loss and death was also adjudicated.  
The safety evaluation included AEs (including infections), vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis). Topi[INVESTIGATOR_240046] ( glomerular 
filtration rate [ GFR], as determined by [CONTACT_240099], SCr, and calculated creatinine 
clearance or GFR at 1, 6, and 12 months), blood pressure (BP) parameters (systolic pressure [SBP] and diastolic blood pressure [DBP], presence of hypertension), fasting serum cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs), and the presence of post -transplant diabetes 
mellitus (PTDM).  
Efficacy Results  
The efficacy results for Study IM103100 study are presented in the following sections. Overall, the mean duration of exposure was comparable across all 3 treatment groups. Specifically, mean duration of exposure was 300, 308, and 294 days in the belatacept MI and LI groups and the CsA group, respectively. 
Acute Rejection  
The primary endpoint, CSBPAR at 6 months, occurred infrequently in all treatment groups (Table 1.3.4.3A). The incidence rate was slightly lower in the belatacept groups than in the CsA group. The criteria for non- inferiority to CsA were easily satisfied for 
both belatacept gr oups; however, the number of events was too small to support any 
further conclusions regarding the relative efficacy of the 3 regimens. The distribution of events by [CONTACT_926] (as indicated by [CONTACT_240100]) was similar across the [ADDRESS_291491] biopsy -proven 
acute rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_240047] (ie, not associated with an increase in 
SCr ≥ 0.5 mg/dL). These epi[INVESTIGATOR_240048], according to local practice, or for other reasons than an increase in SCr ≥ 0.5 mg/dL. 
Biopsy-proven acute rejection occurred most frequently in the belatacept LI group. As 
the rate of CSBPAR was comparable across treatment groups, the difference in the rate of 
biopsy-proven acute rejection was due to an increase in the number of subclinical 
rejection epi[INVESTIGATOR_240049]. Reallocation to [ADDRESS_291492]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

overlapped (belatacept MI:  1.0.%-12.5%; belatacept LI: 1.1%-13%; and CsA: 0%-6.5%).

Subject and Graft Survival  
Death and/or graft loss occurred infrequently in all treatment groups, and was least 
frequently reported in the belatacept LI group (Table 1.3.4.3D). Most graft losses 
occurred for technical, rather than immunological reasons. 
Five deaths (4 in the CsA group and 1 in the belatacept MI group) appear in 
Table 1.3.4.3D, which was analyzed according to the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle. Two 
of these deaths – both in the CsA group – occurred on therapy or within [ADDRESS_291495] dose of study therapy. Accordingly, these deaths also are counted under the prespecified safety conventions, and appear in the safety summaries in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. 
Three other deaths qualify under the ITT principle, but not under the safety conventions 
because they either never received study drug or the death was an event subsequent to the discontinuation of study drug + 56 days. These deaths appear in Table 1.3.4.3D, but not in the safety summaries in Section [IP_ADDRESS]. One death in the CsA group, and [ADDRESS_291496]-Depletion Revised  v.7.0  Protocol: 1FD003539

The rate of AEs, including AEs resulting in discontinuation, was similar across the 3 
treatment groups. The rate of SAEs was somewhat higher  for both belatacept treatment 
groups than for the CsA treatment group. As described below, this difference is due to an increased number of reports of AEs of transplant rejection, not subsequently confirmed as transplant rejection, in the belatacept treatment groups.

Transplant rejection was reported more commonly with both doses of belatacept than 
with CsA. Subsequent evaluation revealed that these reports  reflected epi[INVESTIGATOR_240050], as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_240051]. All reported AEs of transplant rejection that were subsequently confirmed by [CONTACT_240106]. AEs commonly observed during CsA treatment, such as anemia, leukopenia, hirsutism, tremor, hypomagnesemia, and hypertension, were reported less frequently with belatacept than with CsA in this study. Infectious complications occurred with comparable frequency. Pulmonary edema and proteinuria were reported more frequently with belatacept than with CsA. The significance of these events requires further evaluation. 
Serious Adverse Events  
The most frequent SAEs are summarized by [CONTACT_240107] 1.3.4.4C. As noted above, SAEs were reported somewhat more frequently in the belatacept treatment groups than in the CsA group. This difference is accounted for by [CONTACT_240108].

Renal Function 
Renal function was assessed by [CONTACT_240110] a plasma disappearance 
method. As iohexol is a true glomerular filtration marker, measurement of iohexol clearance may be regarded as a ‘gold standard’ technique. Because iohexol clearance measures are relatively difficult to perform, renal function was also assessed by [CONTACT_240111] -based formulas for prediction of 
renal function. Unlike iohexol, creatinine is not a  true glomerular filtration marker, and is 
relatively insensitive to changes in renal function in subjects with GFRs > 50 -60 mL/min. 
Iohexol clearance was greater in the belatacept treatment groups than in the CsA group at all time points (Table 1.3.4.5A). Data collection was not complete, however, and it is 
difficult to predict the impact of missing data on the observed results. SCr and creatinine -based estimates of renal function, which were obtained more consistently than 
iohexol clearance, also generall y favored belatacept, although to a lesser degree.

Renal Function Following Biopsy- proven Acute Rejection  
In general, based on the last available SCr values, renal function following biopsy -proven 
acute rejection (including clinically -suspected and subclinical events) was similar among 
subjects in the 3 treatment groups (belatacept MI: 1.9 mg/dL; belatacept LI: 1.6 mg/dL; 
CsA: 2.3 mg/dL). 
Mean SCr values for subjects who had recurrent acute rejections are summarized in 
Table 1.3.4.5B. Subjects with recurrent acute rejection had similar or better most recent mean SCr at last follow -up in the belatacept treatment groups as compared to the CsA 
treatment group.

belatacept LI group.  
Cardiovascular and Metabolic Effects  
Mean SBP was 3 -4 mm Hg higher with CsA than with belatacept by [CONTACT_43380] 12, despi[INVESTIGATOR_040] a 
somewhat higher rate of antihypertensive medication use in the CsA group (Table 1.3.4.5C). Tota l cholesterol was slightly lower with belatacept than with CsA, as 
were both the non- high-density lipoprotein (non- HDL) and HDL fractions 
(Table 1.3.4.5D). Lipid- lowering medications were used more frequently with CsA 
(53%) than with belatacept (32% -36%). HbA1c and the incidence of PTDM were slightly 
lower with belatacept than with CsA (Table 1.3.4.5E).

Exploratory Analysis in an Extended Criteria Donor Population or in Subjects with

ECD criteria were not prospectively defined in Study IM103100. An analysis of subjects 
who received an allograft with possible impaired renal function at the time of transplantation was explored in a retros pective fashion. Criteria for this analysis were 
donor age ≥ 60 years and CIT ≥ 24 hours. In addition, subjects who experienced either 
DGF (defined as dialysis treatment within first week of transplantation) or slow graft 
function (defined as SCr at Day 5 ≥ 3 mg/dL without dialysis) were also analyzed. 
Tables 1.3.4.6A and 1.3.4.6B show key efficacy and safety data, retrospectively, from 
these respective analyses.

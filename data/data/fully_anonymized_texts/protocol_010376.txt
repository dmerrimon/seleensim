Title of trial Randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled and parallel dose 
group trial to investigate efficacy  and safet y of multiple doses of oral 
BI 690517 over 14 weeks, alone and in combination with 
empagliflozin, in patients with diabetic and non -diabetic chronic
kidney  disease
Coordinating 
Investigator
[INVESTIGATOR_36113]: 
Trial site(s) Multi -centre trial conducted in approximately  30 countries
Clinical phase Phase II
Trial rationale The aim of this trial is to investigate the efficacy  and safet y of three 
oral doses of BI 690517 over 14 weeks, alone and in combination 
with empagliflozin, in male and female patients with diabetic and 
non-diabetic CKD. The results of this trial will be c rucial for the 
decision about further development of BI 690517 and will support 
the dose selection for future trials
Trial objective(s) The main objectives of the trial are to demonstrate the efficacy  of BI 
690517, alone and in combination with empagliflo zin, and to 
characterise the BI 690517 dose -response relationship in patients 
with diabetic and non -diabetic CKD b y assessing 3 doses and 
placebo
Trial endpoints The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in log 
transformed Urine Albumin Creatinine Ratio (UACR) measured in 
First Morning Void urine after 14 weeks.
Secondary endpoints:
UACR respon se I, defined as a decrease of at least 30% absolute 
change in First Morning Void urine of UACR from baseline 
to 14 weeks.
UACR respon se II, defined as a decrease of at least 15% absolute 
change in First Morning Void urine of UACR from baseline to [ADDRESS_885672] of three doses of BI 690517 
alone and in combination with empagliflozin over 14 weeks in

Statistical m ethods Amixed -effect model for repeated measures (MMRM) will be used 
to obtain adjusted mean change s from baseline for the treatment 
effects of continuous endpoints. This MMRM model will include 
fixed effect of treatment as categorical variable, and fixed effect of 
baseline at each visit as continuous variable. Visit will be considered 
as repeate d measures with an unstructured covariance structure for 
the within -patient variability . For dose -finding, predicted average 
response for each dose group and the estimated covariance matrix 
from the MMRM will be used in the multiple comparison 
procedures a nd modelling (MCPMod) analy sis. Several possible 
dose-response patterns will be evaluated in the MCPMod to identify  
the best -fitting model and optimal dose for further development.

1Additional visits may have to be scheduled -for example, in case of dose reduction due to potassium elevation or when an ACTH Challenge test is required for patients whose cortisol level is ≥3 µg/dL (82.8 nmol/L )
and< 11 µg/dL ( 303.5nmol/L )with suggestive signs or symptoms of adrenal insufficiency .
2As UACR and eGFR may not be regularly tested, where allowed sites may pre -screen patients by [CONTACT_5583] a spot urine sample to measure UACR and/or a blood sample to measure eGFR to their local lab. This is 
optional and requires a specific approved pre -screeni ng informed consent. Pre -screening results will not be collected in the CRF or used to determine final eligibility in this trial.  Pre -screening can be performed at any 
point prior to screening.  The full consent form must be signed before screening ( Visit 1) procedures are performed .The Screening Period should be no more than [ADDRESS_885682] been

Sc reening procedures may be repeated once during the screening period if the patient is not eligible for a 
transient medical condition (e.g. elevation of certain lab parameters due to an acute infection). 
If the patient currently does not fulfil all inclusion/exclusion criteria but may, in the op inion of the investigator, fit the criteria later on, the patient is allowed to be rescreened once, as long as screening into this 
trial is still open. Re -screening examinations will only be performed after a written informed consent has been taken again f rom the patient. I RT must be contact[CONTACT_195874] -screening and obtain a new 
patient number.
If screening is not completed within [ADDRESS_885684] the screen failure. I f appropriate th e patient may be re -screened (see above).
3Visit [ADDRESS_885685] be taken to obtain potassium and eGFR results needed to confirm eligibility for the Treatment 
Period.
4In case a patient needs or wishes to terminate all trial treatment prematurely and if the patient agrees, the patient should undergo the procedures for End of Treatment (EoT). Please see section 6.2.5 for details.
5Follow -up Visit 1 (FUp1) must always take place at least 7 days after the EoT visit.
6These visits can either be performed at the I nvestigational site or at the patient’s home. All local approvals for this must be in place and confirmed by [CONTACT_456].  Consent for home visits must also be o btained from 
the patient. See section 6.2.2 for further details.
7There are various ways that Telemedicine contacts (phone call or video call) can be used during this trial:
1. Telemedicine contact [CONTACT_195875]’s urine sampling. Before the patient does their first UACR sampling at home the investigational site staff should contact [CONTACT_657217]. The other timepoints marked as ‘(X)’ are suggested times to contact [CONTACT_195877][INVESTIGATOR_657198]. The site may, at their discretion, offer support with further home sampling accord ing to the individual needs of a patient. 
2. Visit [ADDRESS_885686] for all patients, unless they prefer to come to the trial site instead.
3. Phone/ video calls may also take place at any other time if needed to support the patient.
8Informed consent must be obtained before the f irst screening assessment. It can be obtained on the day of the screening visit or within [ADDRESS_885687] is required for all patients at screening , and for all patients whose morning serum cortisol level at EoT (or at the time of premature discontinuation of BI  690517 / placebo) is< 18 µg/dL (496.6
nmol/L ).  After the start of BI  690517 / placebo treatment at Visit 5 , if morning serum cortisol level is≥ 3µg/dL (82.8 nmol/L )and< 11 µg/dL  (303.5 nmol/L) and the patient shows suggestive signs or symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency , an ACTH Challenge test should be performed as soon as possible .  Serum cortisol basal sample must be performed before ACTH -injection (0.25 mg). I njection time must be recorded and has to 
be done within 4 hours of the patient’s usual waking time . Post -dose samples for serum cortisol must be taken 30 (± 5) minutes after the injection, to ensure patients have normal adrenal fu nction. The time for the post 
ACTH -injection blood samples must be recorded in the patient’s medical record . See section [IP_ADDRESS].
11Patients do not need to be fasted for the blood sampling for the safety laboratory. See section 5.2.[ADDRESS_885688] be collected within 4 hours of the patient’s usual waking time .
15Post-dose serum cortisol should be taken 1 hour (+/ -10 minutes) after drug administration.
16See  Flow Chart for samples and timings. For further instructions see section 6.1.
17The pharmacogenomics samples may be collected at Visit [ADDRESS_885689] is required for all women of child -bearing potential. This will be a serum pregnancy at Screening (Visit 1). Thereafter a urine pregnancy test will be performed . A home pregnancy test may be used 
at the Visit [ADDRESS_885690] can be done at a local laboratory. More frequent pregnancy testing should be done if required by [CONTACT_13308] /or 
authority or per investigator judgment .
20To confirm eligibility, at visit 1, UACR measured in spot urine (midstream u rine sample) by [CONTACT_195881]. Should the first test for UACR at screening not match inclusion criteria due to UACR 
variability, this can be repeated once. If the second result does not meet the eligibility criter ia the patient should be screen failed. 
21Please refer to FMV and [ADDRESS_885691] start and stop times for 24 -hour urine
samples in a paper diary before Visit 5 and EOT .

At all other visits, study medication should be taken from the 
kit dispensed at the visit.
24All AEs, SAEs and AESI  will be collected from informed consent until FUp1 (end of residual effect period). Please see section [IP_ADDRESS].1 .
25After FUp1 until the individual patient’s end of trial, the investigator should report any cancers of new histology and exace rbations of existing cancer, all trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESI s. 
Please see section [IP_ADDRESS].1.
26After the individual patient’s end of trial, the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but s hould report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment 
related AE SIs of which the investigator may become aware of by [CONTACT_23321], e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI  SAE form, but not on the CRF.
27In the case of premature discontinuation during the Randomised Run -in Period ,FUp1.1, FUP1.2 and FUp2 do not need to be conducted .  
28At Visit s 4and5, only compliance to Empagliflozin/placebo will be calculated.  At Visits 6, 7, 8, 9 and EOT, compliance will be calculated for both Empagliflozin/placebo and BI  690517/placebo.

1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Chronic Kidney  Disease (CKD) is the leading cause of kidney  damage and end-stage kidney  
disease (ES KD). The 5- year survival rate of dialysis patients is 35%, which decreases to onl y 
25% in diabetic dial ysis patients. As a result, CKD puts a large burden on healthcare s ystems 
worldwide, e.g. in the U.S. costs per patient exceed $75,[ADDRESS_885710] 
renal consequences, reduced kidney  function is also a major trigger for cardio- vascular 
events. Overall, around 12% of the general population in Europe have 
CKD stages 3 to 5 [ R19-1388 ], with considerable variation across countries, ranging from 
4.1% to 25.5% [ R19-1184 ].
Diabetes is the main cause of CKD in most countries, accounting for 40% or more of new 
cases [ R19-0901]. As glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declines, there is a linear increase in 
mortality , with 2- to 5-fold increases in patients with GFR <45 mL /min/1.73 m² compared 
with patients with GFR >60 mL /min/1.73m² [ R14-4475]. Declining kidney  function is 
associated w ith an increasing risk for coronary  heart disease, stroke, and heart failure [ R15-
5158 ;R15-2265 ]. Diabetic nephropath y is the leading cause of kidney  damage and end -stage 
kidney  disease (ES KD), a ccounting for >40% of patients on dialy sis. 
At present, onl y a limited number of therapeutic options are available to delay kidney  
function decline in patients with CKD. Angiotensin- converting enz yme inhibitors (ACEis) 
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) can reduce albuminuria and slow the rate of 
progression in proteinuric diabetic kidney  disease . However, in clinical trials in patients with 
diabetic nephropathy , the relative risk reduction for the composite primary  endpoint of all -
cause death, ES KD and doubling of serum creatinine in trials was only moderate (16% in the 
RENAAL trial and 19% in the IDNT trial) [ R02-0327 ; R02-2101]. 
Recently , the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT -2)inhibitor empagliflozin has been 
shown to reduce the risk of kidney  disease progression in people with ty pe 2 diabetes. An 
exploratory  anal ysis of the EMPA -REG OUTCOME trial indicated that empagliflozin 
reduced the incidence of the composite outcome of doubli ng of creatinine, the need to start 
kidney replacement therapy , or renal death by  46% (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.40 -0.75). These 
benefits were similar regardless of baseline ACEi or ARB use and there was no evidence of 
an increased risk of h yperkalaemia or acute k idney  injury [P16-[ZIP_CODE] )]. Inthe EMPEROR -
Reduced trial, which was conducted in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection 
fraction, empagliflozin reduced the risk of the exploratory  composite renal endpoint ( chronic 
dialy sis, kidney  transplant, or sustained reduction in eGFR) b y 50% in the overall trial 
population and was consistent on 
patients with and without CKD at baseline. Cardio- Kidney  
benefits of e mpagliflozin are currentl y being investigated in patients with CKD and a high 
risk for progression in the ongoing EMPA -KIDNEY study [P18-[ZIP_CODE]].
Increasing evidence is indicating that SGLT -[ADDRESS_885711] range of 
CKD phenotypes . The SGLT -2 inhibitor 
canagliflozin has received FDA approval for the treatment of patients with diabetic kidney  
disease and albuminuria >300 mg/g . In the CREDENCE trial, canagliflozin provided a

-06  Clinical Trial Protocol Page 20of 121
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_885712] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020relative risk reduction of 30% for the composite endpoint of doubling of serum creatinine, 
ESKD or renal/CV death on top of standard of care [ R19-1356 ]. A large -scale clinical 
outcome trial (DAPA -CKD) evaluating the SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients wi th 
CKD (with or without type 2 diabetes and albuminuria >200 mg/g ) was stopped earl y due to 
overwhelming efficacy . Data reported in August 2020 showed that dapagliflozin resulted in 
39% relative risk reduction (RRR) for the composite primary  endpoint ( ≥50% eGFR 
decline/ESKD/renal or CV death). Dapagliflozin also resulted in 39% RRR for composite 
secondary  endpoint of CV death and HF hospi[INVESTIGATOR_233335] 31% RRR for all- cause mortality
[R21-1080].
Current guideline recommendations have started to incorporate this new evidence b y 
recommending SGLT2i with proven benefits as an integral part of the treatment regimen for 
patients with ty pe 2 diabetes and CKD or CV risk [ P20-[ZIP_CODE]]. Recommendations for non -
diabetic kidney  disease are likely  to follow soon in the light of the new and upcoming 
evidence. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_657201], the residual renal and cardiovascular risks for patients remain 
unacceptabl y high for patients with CKD, warranting continued efforts to provide new 
treatments, particularly  for fast -progressing patients (with GFR reductions 
>3ml/min/1.73m²/y ear) that are at considerably  increased risk.

Empagliflozin is indicated for reduction of blood glucose in patients with Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus (T2DM), and for cardiovascular (CV) death risk reduction in patients with T2DM 
and established CV disease.
Mode of action
Empagliflozin is an orally available SGLT -2 inhibitor, promoting urinary  glucose excretion. 
Empagliflozin also reduces blood pressure, arterial stif fness and measures of my ocardial 
workload, likely  through various mechanisms, as well as improving other CV risk factors 
(e.g. uric acid, visceral fat mass, albuminuria; [ P15-[ZIP_CODE], P15 - [ZIP_CODE]]).
Key pharmacokinetic characteristics
In humans, empagliflozin predominantly  showed linear pharmacokinetics both after single
oral doses and at stead y-state. Empagliflozin was rapi[INVESTIGATOR_638262], reaching peak levels at
approximately  1.5 h, followed by  a biphasic decline with the terminal elimination half -life
ranging from 10 to 19 h. 
Drug interaction
!oclinically  relevant pharmacokinetic interactions areanticipated with BI 690517 (see
section 1.2.1 ).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_885716] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Residual Effect Period
The Residual Effect Period (REP) of empagliflozin is [ADDRESS_885717] 
dose with measurable drug levels and/or pharmacody namic effects still likely  to be present.
Data from clinical studies
Empagliflozin has been studied as part of a global development program including more than 
20,[ADDRESS_885718], dipeptidy l peptidase -4 (DPP -4) inhibitors, or insulin.
In the EMPA -
REG OUTCOME trial, empagliflozin was shown to be superior in reducing the 
primary  endpoint, a composite of CV death, non- fatal my ocardial infarction (MI), or non-
fatal stroke 
driven by  38% reduction of CV death compared to placebo on top of standard of 
care in patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease. An 
improved overall survival driven by  a reduction in CVdeath was also observed. 
Empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657202]. The risk of 
new or worsening nephropathy (including onset of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum 
creatinine, and initiation of renal replacement therapy  (i.e. haemodialy sis)) was reduced in 
the empagliflozin group compared to placebo. 
In the EMPEROR- Reduced study in patients with HFrEF with LVEF<40%, with or without 
T2DM , empagliflozin significantly  reduced the risk of cardiovascular death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657203]. Additionally , empagliflozin significantly  reduced 
the risk of recurrent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657204], and signific antly reduced the rate of 
eGFR decline .
In completed clinical studies, empagliflozin was well tolerated in non-diabetic healthy
volunteers, patients with ty pe 2 diabetes, and patients with heart failure (NYHA class II -IV) 
and reduced ejection fraction wit h or without diabetes mellitus. The frequencies of overall 
AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation and SAEs were similar to placebo. There was an 
increase in frequency  of genital infections with the use of empagliflozin. Empagliflozin 
treatment also i ncreased urination and thirst. There was a small increase in total cholesterol, 
low density  lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high -density  lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 
and no significant changes of LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio and in trigl ycerides. In addition, 
incre ases in haematocrit, haemoglobin and red blood cell were observed with empagliflozin. 
No clinically  relevant changes in electroly tes, including potassium, were observed with 
empagliflozin. No changes to heart rate and no QTc prolongation have been observed . The 
safet y profile of empagliflozin in patients with kidney impairment and decreased eGFR down 
to 15 mL /min/1.73m2was consistent with that reported in patients with normal kidney  
function; there is no experience in patients with end -stage 
kidney  disease and in patients on 
dialy sis.

Investigator’s Brochure [ c01678844].

The renin -angiotensin- aldoste rone s ystem (RAAS) play s a key  role in the development and 
progression of kidney  disease in patients with diabetic and non -diabetic CKD. Aldosterone is 
a key  element of the RAAS and exerts its effects primarily  via the mineralocorticoid receptor 
(MR). In patients with CKD and t ype [ADDRESS_885720] (MRA) 
finerenone in the FIDELIO DKD trial resulted in lower risks of CKD progression and 
cardiovascular events than placebo [ R20-3706 ]. However, use of MRAs, particularl y in 
patients with reduced kidney  function, is limited by  [CONTACT_657218].
BI 690517 is a potent and highl y selective inhibitor of human aldosterone sy nthase (ASI). It 
is under development f or the treatment of CKD in patients with and without diabetes.

result in decreased progression towards dial ysis or kidney  transplantation due to 
slowing /preventing the progression of kidney damage, which may  directl y translate into 
relevant improvements for patients’ morbidity , mortality , and quality  of life. Bey ond that, it

rationale for the riskMitigation strategy
Patients may  develop 
SARS -CoV -2infectionBased on the mode of 
action BI [ADDRESS_885730] on the 
susceptibility  to or the 
course of an infection.
Travelling to the site or 
being at the site for trial 
visits may  potentially  
increase the risk of 
contracting a SARS 
CoV -2 infection.
The underl ying disease 
studied in this trial and 
the expected higher age 
of the impacted 
population increase the 
risk of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657205] a SARS -CoV -2
infection . 
Contracting SARS -
CoV -2 infection, as with 
all acute illnesses, has 
the potential to increase 
the risk of ketoacidosis 
in patients treat edwith 
empagliflozinEven though the risks associated 
with BI 690517 treatment are 
considered low, patients with active 
or recent SARS CoV -2 infection 
will not be included in the trial (see 
section 3.3.3 ). In the case of severe 
SARS COV -2, the trial medication 
will be interrupted until recovery . 
Investigator and sponsor will 
closely  align on the appropriate 
measures for monitoring, treatment 
and quarantine.  Measures are in 
place to ensure continued patient 
treatment, monitoring, and safet y 
even if site visits are not possible 
(seesections 4.1and6.2). Physical 
visits to the sites may  be replaced 
with home visits or telemedicine 
andprocedures (including local lab 
testing) followed as far as the 
situation allows. Direct shipment of 
the trial medication will be managed 
by [CONTACT_657219] y 
as permitted by [CONTACT_427]. 
All decisions regarding the 
appropriate measures will be fully  
documented b y the Sponsor. 
These measures ensure the safet y of 
the patients throughout the trial.
Patients may  develop 
an analph ylactic shock 
or severe allergic 
reaction to 
tetracosactide 
(Synacthen®or 
equivalent for the

1.4.3 Discussion
Based on pre -clinical results, BI 690517 has the potential to slow progression of kidney  
damage, delay  end stage kidney  disease (ES KD) and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events 
such as cardiovascular death, my ocardial infarction, stroke and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_657206], in patients with CKD. Based on results of completed clinical trials, empagliflozin also 
has the potential to slow the progression of CKD and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.
A placebo arm for each treatment (empagliflozin and BI 690517) is needed to allow for a true 
assessment of the effects of BI [ADDRESS_885733] either ACEi or ARB, and patients will onl y be enrolled in the trial if treatment with 
SGL T2i is not required (see section 3.3.1), therefore the inclusion of placebo treatment is 
considered to be ethically  justifiable.
Patients will be carefull y monitored for side effects during the trial. The Sponsor will 
continuously  assess the risks and benefits of the trial based on accumulating clinical data 
from all clinical trials with BI [ADDRESS_885734] on progression of 
CKD in humans and based on the safety profile of BI 690517, the benefit- risk evaluati on of 
this compound, as well as empagliflozin, is considered favourable for the intended trial 
population.

after 14 weeks. The primary  objectives are (1) to demonstrate a non- flat dose response curve, 
evaluate the quantitative treatment effect size and evaluate the dose -response relationship, (2) 
to determine an optimal dose of BI [ADDRESS_885736] Morning Void urine after 14 weeks 
between the 3 doses of BI 690517 and placebo.
One set of secondary  objectives will be as above but in subpopulations of (1) placebo 
background therap y (2) empagli flozin background therapy.
These analy ses will include all data prior to BI690517 discontinuation, down- titration of BI 
690517, or death, regardless of change in concurrent SGL T2-inhibitor use .
2.1.2 Primary endpoint(s)
Change from

Run-in Period.  Patients will be randomised equally  to receive either empagliflozin 10 mg or 
placebo matching to empagliflozin 10 mg in a 1:1 ratio and will continue taking the assigned 
study  treatment f or 8 weeks.  After 8 weeks of treatment in the Run- in Period, patients will 
enter the Treatment Period. Patients who received empagliflozin in the Run -in Period will be 
randomised equall y into one of four parallel dose groups  in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (see Figure 3.1: 1) 
to receive one of 3 doses of BI 690517 (3 mg QD, 10 mg QD or 20 mg QD) in combination 
with empagliflozin, or empagliflozin alone (empagliflozin plus placebo matching to BI 
690517) .  Patients who received placebo i n the Run -in Period will be randomised equally  into 
one of four parallel dose groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of 3 doses of BI 690517 (3 
mg QD, 10 mg QD or 20 mg QD) or placebo. Patients will continue receiving the assigned 
treatment for 14 weeks .
The study  will be blinded to both empagliflozin and BI 690517.  As the BI 690517 film 
coated tablets of the different dose strengths (3 and 10 mg) and empagliflozin have different 
dimensions, in order to minimise possible observer bias and ensure the stud y is blinded 
across dose groups the patients will each take [ADDRESS_885742] to prognostic variables such as
eGFR and UACR .A target of approximately  30% of patients will be randomi sed during the 
run-in period in each of the disease t ypes: diabetic kidney  disease and non-diabetic kidney  
disease .  Patients with diabetes may  have diabetic kidney  disease , non- diabetic CKD
aetiologies , or a combination ; for the purpose of categorising diabetic status
,they will be 
class ified as having diabetic kidney  disease.
From the star t of the screening until the end of the trial, at various time points patients will 
collect their First Morning Void urine for UACR analy sis. These timepoints are listed in the 
FMV and 24-hour Urine Sampling Flow Chart .First morning void urine will be collected 
before the dail y dose of study medication. 24-hour urine samples will also be collected prior 
to the start of the Treatment Period and at EOT. T he patient will be equipped with urine 
collection containers to collect [ADDRESS_885743] Morning Void urine .
To decrease the burden on patients, where local regulations allow, samples taken at home 
between visits or when a home visit occurs will be shipped from the patient’s home to a 
central laboratory  for anal ysis. Where this is not possible alternative arrangements will be 
made, e.g. samples taken to the investigational site. Samples taken directly prior to a ph ysical 
visit at the site will be taken to the site to be processed b y the site staff. 
Beyond anal ysis for safety , urine and blood samples in this trial will serve for biomarker 
analysis including UACR.
Following the Treatment Period, or at the time trial treatment in the Run- in Period or the 
Treatment Period is permanently  discontinued, patients will ha ve an End of Treatment (EoT) 
visit.This will be followed by a 4-week follow -up period off-treatment . A first follow -up 
visit (FUp1) at least [ADDRESS_885744] Period (REP).

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_885745] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Until the end of REP all AEs and changes to concomitant medication need to be collected, 
documented and reported.   Patients who discontinue prematurel y during the Run -In Period 
must attend FUp1 at least.  All other patients should be encouraged to complete the full 
follow -up period.
During the follow -up period the patient will not be treated with trial medication, but should, 
if possible, continue with any  background treatment they  are on, and will collect additional 
urine at home. After the 4- week follow -up period the patient will have a final visit where 
again blood and urine samples will be collected. With the conclusion of this visit the trial 
participation is complete for the individual patient.
A rise in serum potassium and a drop in eGFR under treatment with BI 690517 cannot be 
excluded. Therefore ,patients will be monitored closely  (weekl yfor 2 weeks ) after starting 
treatment with BI 690517 or matching placebo , and regularl y thereafter . 
In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily  
donate biospecimens for banking (please see section 5.5). If the patient agrees, banked 
samples may  be used for future biomarker research and drug development projects, e.g. to 
identify  patients that are more likely  to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse 
event (AE), or to gain a mechanistic understanding of drug effects and thereby  [CONTACT_657220][INVESTIGATOR_014].
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING T HE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This trial has been designed to assess efficacy  and safet y of BI 690517 alone, and in 
combination with empagliflozin, as like ly initiated in clinical practice.  It also allows the 
opportunity  to find the optimal dose of BI 690517 to be used for future development, on its 
own and / or as a fixed dose combination with empagliflozin.
Patients will initially  start on [ADDRESS_885746] parallel group will investigate three 
different dose regimens of BI 690517 and placebo.  The second parallel group will

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_885747] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020investigate thre edifferent dose regimens of BI 690517, in combination with empagliflozin, 
versus empagliflozin+placebo . Placebo is used to control for observer and subject bias, and 
randomisation to control for assignment bias.
The study  design involves two randomi sations.  The first run-in randomi sation to 
empa gliflozin andplacebo is required for two purposes.  First ly, the run-in randomi sation
will ensure an equally  distributed patient population to the empa gliflozin and placebo groups 
followed b y second randomi sation to treatment groups.   Secondly , a staggered approach
starting empagliflozin during the run-in period, followed by [CONTACT_657221] [ADDRESS_885748] .
UACR was chosen as primary endpoint (First Morning Void collection) and secondary 
endpoint (responder rate) because it was shown in previous phase II trials by  [CONTACT_657222], differentiating different doses, broad in its dy namic range and reaching a 
stable plateau within a reasonable time after start of treatment. It has been accepted b y 
authorities as dose finding biomarker in CKD. 
Furthermore, the change in UACR correlates 
with long -term clinical and patient relevant outcomes.
Since U ACR is a parameter that varies intra- individually  over time, multiple measurements 
are required at treatment period baseline and during the treatment period especiall y towards 
the end of treatment where a stable response to the drug should be achieved. UACR 
measurements will therefore be collected on 2 consecutive days at 3 timepoints (6 
measurements in total) from Week -[ADDRESS_885749] and mitigate the potential risk of adrenal insufficiency  and Cushing’s 
syndrome, several measures will be implemented.  An ACTH Challenge test will be 
performed at screening to exclude patients with adrenal insufficiency .  Serum cortisol will be 
measured at all visits from Visit [ADDRESS_885750] prior to the start of BI 690517 treatment and at the e nd of BI 690517 
treatment to determine whether BI 690517 increases cortisol levels
. Patients with adrenal 
insufficiency  or Cushing’s sy ndrome will be discontinued from treatment with BI 
690517.
A data monitoring committee ( DMC) will be establis hed to review safet y data at regular 
intervals.  For further details see section 8.7.

Permanent Discontinuation
An individual patient will permanentl y discontinue all randomised trial treatment if:
1.The patient develops Acute Kidney  Injury  as per clinical judgement by  [CONTACT_1275] .
The Kidney  Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) d efinition 
[R17-2439 ](see section 3.3.3 )is going to be used for guidance .
2.The patient experiences a drop in eGFR1:
≥ 30% from the last measurement of eGFR before the first dose of 
empagliflozin / placebo up to Visit 6 ; and/or
≥ 40% at an y time since the last measurement of eGFR before the first dose of 
empagliflozin/placebo 
3.The patient progresses to end stage kidney disease defined by  [CONTACT_5640] a kidney  function 
decline below an eGFR1of <15 mL/min/1 .73 m2and/or requires renal replacement 
therap y by [CONTACT_207010].
4.The patient wants to discontinue trial treatment. The patient will be asked to explain 
the reasons but has the right to refuse to answer. 
5.The patient has repeatedly shown to be non -compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], the safet y of the patient cannot be guaranteed 
as he / she is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future. 
6. The patient needs to take concomitant medication that is not permitted, see section 
4.2.2 . However, if the patient needs to modify  a dose, where a stable dose is permitted 
only, this will not automatically require a discontinuati on. In this case the sponsor can
be consulted.
7.The patient can no longer receive trial treatment for medical reasons such as surgery , 
serious or severe Drug Induced Liver Injury  attributable to the trial drug (see section
[IP_ADDRESS].4 ), other adverse events, or other diseases. 
8.The patient requires treatment for cancer. Some exclusions apply  e.g. for Basal Cell 
Carcinoma –please discuss with sponsor.
9. A female patient becomes pregnant. The patient will be followed up until birth or 
otherwise termination of the pregnancy . The data of the patient will be collected and 
reported in the clinical trial report until last patient last visit and any  events thereafter 
will be reported in the BI Pharmacovigilance database. See section [IP_ADDRESS].3.
10.The patient does not meet the additional inclusion criteria (see section 3.3.2 ) or the 
additional exclusion criteria (see section 3.3.3 ) assessed before second random ization 
(start of Treatment Period).
An individual patient will permanentl y discontinue BI 690517 / placebo if:

4.1.2 Selection of doses in the trial anddose modifications
During the Randomised Run -in Period, patients will receive either empagliflozin 10 mg or 
matching placebo. This dose was selected based on the dose used in the ongoing phase II I 
empagliflozin in CKD trial (BI 1245 -0137).
During the Treatment Period, patients will receive either BI 690517 or matching placebo on 
top of empagliflozin or matching placebo. The target doses of BI 690517 used for this trial 
will be 3 mg QD, 10 mg QD and 20 mg ( 2 x 10mg) QD. 
In health y volunteer phase I trials, doses ranging from 0.[ADDRESS_885777] stud y 1378- 0008, three doses of BI 690517 (3 
mg, 10 mg and 40 mg QD) were tested over [ADDRESS_885778] 
less hy perkal aemia cases compared to 40 mg dose. Therefore, to enhance patient safet y 
during this trial, it is proposed to investigate 3, 10 and 20 mg (QD) doses. The other 
important factor in selection of 20 mg dose was supp ression of aldosterone.  The 40 mg dose 
resulted in a substantial suppression ofaldosterone, and it is expected that the lower 20 mg 
dose willresult in less aldosterone 
suppre ssion,reducing the risk of h yperkal aemia.
Down titration (dose reduction) may  be considered based on serum potassium levels (see 
section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
4.1.3 Method of assigning patient s to treatment groups
After the assessment of all in- and exclusion criteria at visit 2, each eligible patient will be 
randomised into the Randomised Run -in Period according to a randomisation plan.  Patients 
will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio via Interactive Response Tec hnology  (IRT) to either receive 
empagliflozin 10 mg QD or placebo matching to empagliflozin 10 mg QD in a blinded 
manner.

screen patients, perform drug assignment, manage initial/ re -supply  ordering of dru g supplies 
and handle emergency  un-blinding.
The investigator will receive all necessary  instructions from the sponsor to access the IRT. 
Detailed IRT functions and procedures will be documented in the User Requirement 
Specifications mutually  agreed b y the sponsor and the I RT vendor. Note that the medication 
number is different from the patient number (the latter is generated during screening via the 
IRT S ystem).

4.1.5 Blinding and procedures for unblinding
[IP_ADDRESS] Blinding
Patients, investigators and every one involved in trial conduct or analy sis or with any  other 
interest in this double -blind trial will remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment 
assignments until a snapshot after Last Pa tient Last Visit Primary  Endpoint (L PLVPE), with 
the exception of the Trial Pharmacometrician, PK programmer and Trial Bioanal yst. This 
snapshot will be taken after the last patient completes the EoT Visit, and will be used to 
obtain efficacy , safet y, and PK/PD results, to guide further development plans for BI 690517.
At the timepoint of unblinding of this snapshot, patients and investigators will continue to be 
blinded and will remain so until after database lock when the database is declared read y for 
final anal ysis according to the sponsor’s SOPs. Further details regarding the timepoint of 
unblinding the database for anal ysis are documented in the TSAP. The access to the 
randomisation code will be kept restricted until its release for anal ysis.
The randomisation codes will be provided to bioanalytics before the last patient completed 
the trial to exclude placebo samples from the PK anal ysis. Bioanal ytics will not disclose the 
randomisation code or the results of their measurements prior to the L PLVPE snapshot .
In order to expedite the population PK and PK -PD anal yses and ensure timely  delivery  of 
PK/PD results after database lock and to provide PK data to DMC for consideration when 
evaluating safety  of the trial , specific data must be unblinded and the treatment information 
must be made available to selected individuals. The unblinding procedure and logistics 
specific to this purpose will be provided in a separate document. It should be noted no PK/PD 
results wil l be communicated to the project and trial team prior to the LPLVPE snapshot .
[IP_ADDRESS] Unblinding and breaking the code
Emergency  unblinding will be available to the investigator via IRT. It must only  be used in 
an emergency situation when the identity  of the trial drug must be known to the investigator

the patient goes back to sleep after urinating earl yin the morning e.g. at 4am, this void does 
not need to be collected and this does not need to be documented. This applies also to an y 
urinations earlier during the night in patients who have nocturia. (However, if the patient is 
an earl y riser and gets up ‘for good’ e.g. at 4am, this would qualify  astheir FMV.) Of course, 
there may  be cases when a patient might go back to bed after their usual rising time. In those 
cases, the void after the usual rising time constitutes the first morning void.
After the s creening period, UACR will be determined on two consecutive days to average 
biological variability  at the timepoints indicated in the FMV and [ADDRESS_885797] be obtained from the patient’s FMV.

whether considered related or not.
The followin g shoul d also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -existing conditions 
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they

If such abnormalities already  exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE ,which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria :
-results in death,
-is life -threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have 
caused d eath if more severe ,
-requires in
patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]
- results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity ,
-is a c ongenital anomal y /birth defect,
-is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based 
on appropriate medical judg ement which may  jeopard isethe patient and may  require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
abov e definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_88796]. 
For Japan only : An event that possibly  leads to disability  will be handled as ‘deemed serious

defined above.
The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found in the eDC sy stem. A copy  of the latest 
list of “Alway s Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should alway s be 
reported as SAEs as described in section [IP_ADDRESS].
Cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be classified as a serious 
event regardless of the time since discontinuation of the drug and must be reported as 
described in section [IP_ADDRESS], subsection s “AE Collection” and “ AE reporting to sponsor and 
timelines”.
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_885817] (AESI) relates to an y specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern fo r prospective safet y monitoring 
and safet y assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from 
other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see

The following are considered as AESIs:
1)Potential Severe DILI
2) Events leading to lower limb amputation (LLA)
3)Ketoacidosis
4)Cushing’s s yndrome
5)Adrenal insufficiency
Potential Severe DILI
A potential severe Drug Induced Liver Injury  (DILI) that requires follow -up is defined by  [CONTACT_637456]: 
An elevation of AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) and / or ALT (Alanine 
Aminotransfe rase) ≥3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2-fold 
ULN measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn within 30 day s of each

Events leading to lower limb amputation (LLA)
Any event leading to a lower limb procedure of a mputation, auto -amputation or disarticulation 
as defined below is considered as an AESI.
Amputation is a resection of a limb through a bone. Disarticulation is a resection of a limb 
through a joint. Auto -amputation is a spontaneous separation of non -viable portion of the 
lower limb.
Not included in this definition are debridement (removal of callus or dead tissue), procedures 
on a stump (like stump revision, drainage of an abscess, wound revision etc.) and other 
procedures (e.g., nail resection or removal) without a concomitant resection of a limb 
(amputation or disarticulation). (International Working Group of Diabetic Foot, 2015).
Each lower limb amputation, disarticulation, or auto- amputation should be reported separately . 
The SAE report should include the date of the procedure, the level of amputation or 
disarticulation, the medical condition(s) leading to the procedure and if the patient had some of 
theknown risk factor(s) for lower limb amputation.
Ketoacidosis
Ifmetabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis or DKA is suspected further investigations should be
done according tomedical judgement andtheclinical course until adiagnosis ismade 
and/or the patient is recovered.
Due to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may potentially modify the clinical
presentation of ketoacidosis which may occur at lower plasma glucose levels in patients 
with DM and potentially also in non- diabetic patient population. Thediagnosis of
ketoacidosis inthese patients can be based on arterial pH ≤ 7.30, serum bicarbonate levels
< 15mmol/L andmeasurement ofserum beta-hydroxybutrate levels. Other diagnostic 
criteria which can support thediagnosis ofketoacidosis areurine ketones andanion gap
>10mmol/L .
Investigators should note that not all criteria mentioned above need toapply for the 
diagnosis of ketoacidosis, andclinical judgment should alsobetaken intoconsideration.
[IP_ADDRESS].5 Intensit y (severit y) of AEs
The intensity  (severit y) of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is / are easily  tolerated .
Moderate: Sufficient discomfort to cause interference with usual activity .
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities.

Medical judg ement should be used to de termine the relationship between the adverse event 
and the BI  investigational comp ound ( BI 690517 / empagliflozin / placebo ), considering all 
relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -
challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and 
relevant history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that there is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be :
The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the trial drug.
The event is known to be caused b y or attributed to the drug class.
A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced.
No medicall y sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre -
existing or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
The event is t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_1306] y drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may  sugge st that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days /weeks 
of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the trial 
drug concerned) .
Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
There is an alternative explanation , e.g. situations where other drugs or underly ing 
diseases appear to provide a more likel
y explanation for the observed event than the 
drug concerned.
Disappearance of the event even though the trialdrug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.

6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All visits should be scheduled according to the Flow Chart . Each visit date in the Randomised 
Run-in Period (with its window) is to be c ounted from Day  -56 ( first randomisation) . All 
visits in the Treatment Period and Follow -up Period are to be counted from Day  1 (second 
randomisation) . If an y visit has to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the 
original visit schedule. The tri al medication packs contain sufficient medication to allow for 
time windows.
All trial visits should be initiated preferentiall y in the morning. Patients should be instructed 
to not take their dose of the study  medication at home in the morning of schedule d visit day s 
as they  will be dosed whilst at the study  site.
Patients do not need to come fasted to study  visits, but their fasting status will have to be 
recorded in the CRF for  From the first  
the patient 
should only  drink water and eat no food unless it is medically  needed.
Unscheduled visits will be possible at the discretion of the investigator at any time in order to 
check the safet y of the patient or to provide trial medication e.g .following an interruption. 
If the reason for removal of a patient from treatment is an adverse event or a clinically  
significant laboratory  test result, the patient must be followed
-up until complete resolution or 
stabilisation of the event or until follow- up is agreed adequate b y the Investigator and 
sponsor.
In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war) the 
investigational plan as per this clinical trial protoc ol may  not be feasible at a site. With the 
consent of the patient, sponsor and investigator may agree on alternative, back -up or rescue 
methodology  which may  include but will not be limited to virtual (remote) patient visits and 
assessments, home healthcare nurse visits, and direct -to-patient shipments of trial treatment. 
Such alternative measures will be mentioned in the patient information leaflet. The 
implementation of these measures will depend on patient’s consent, operational feasibility ,

Blood draws including trough PK and plasma aldosterone –other PK and plasma aldosterone
samples are drawn after drug administration (see PK and aldosterone Flow Chart). Post dose -
serum cortisol at Visit 5 is also drawn after drug administration.
There will be h ome sampling without a visit at Week -4(‘Visit’ 3.1 during Randomised Run -

Weeks 16 and 17 (‘Visits’ FUp1.1 and FUp1.2 respectivel y, during the Follow -up Period
). 
The patient will be required to collect urine samples for UACR over two consecutive days 
according to the FMV and [ADDRESS_885836]. These contacts are used to help support patients with 
protocol procedures and compliance (see section 6.2.1 and 6.2.2):
Telemedicine Contact: [CONTACT_4838] 3 
Home Visit s: Visits 4, 6, 9, FUp2
All other visits must be performed at the Investigational Site. The only exception to this is in 
the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances where physical patient visits to 
the sites may  not be feasible or may  need to be restricted to ensure patient safet y. Based on a 
thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the following vi sits may  be performed at the 
patient’s home orremotely , e.g. via telephone and/or internet- based means of 
communication:
Visit 2 (first randomisation) – may be performed as a home visit only
Visit 5 (second randomisation) –may be performed as a home visit only

6.2.3 Screening and run -in period(s)
Screening Period
No trial procedures should be done unless the patient has consented to taking part in the trial. 
Once informed consent is obtained, the patient is considered to be enrolled in the trial. The 
patient should be recorded on the enro llment log and be registered in the IRT sy stem as a 
screened patient before any  other activities are performed. The screening period begins once 
the first screening procedure has been performed . Patients who do not start the Randomised 
Run- in Period should be registered as a screen failure in the IRT s ystem. Patients who do not 
fulfil all eligibility
 criteria for a reason that later resolves and allows eligibility  criteria to be 
met, may  be re -screened. Re -screening will only  be allowed once.
The footnotes to the Flow Chart provide details about when screening procedures may  be 
repeated and when re -screening is allowed.
During the screening visit, demographics information will be collected. This includes:
age on the day  of informed consent (in y ears)
Sex (male, female in order to describe the participant `s sex at birth), 
For women: confirmation of childbearing potential in order to cha racteri se the patient 
population and as a basis for contraception requirements 
Ethnicity  and race in order to sufficientl y characteri se the patient population ,to 
support possible subgroup anal ysesif needed and to support the calculation of the 
kidney  function via the CKD EPI  [INVESTIGATOR_14420], unless not acceptable according to local 
regulations.

which corresponds to two- sided α of 10% ). The pre-specified models and their parameters 
used for this test will be outlined in section 7.2.3.
7.2 PLANNED ANALYSES
7.2.1 General considerations
The following anal ysis sets will be defined for statistical analy ses:
Entered Set (ES): This patient set includes all patients who signed informed consent. The ES 
will be used for the anal ysis of patient disposition.
Randomised Set (RS): This patient set includes all entered and randomised patients based on 
the treatment groups they were randomised to at the randomisation prior to the Treat ment 
Period, regardless of being treated b y BI 690517 or not. The RS will be used for the analy ses 
of protocol deviations as well as demographics and baseline characteristics.
Treated Set (TS): This patient set includes all patients who received at least one dose of BI 
[ADDRESS_885847] received and 
will be used for safet y analyses.
Full Anal ysis Set (FAS): This patient set includes all randomised patients who had at least 
one baseline measuremen t of UACR at week 6, 7, or [ADDRESS_885848]- baseline 
measurement. The FAS will be the main anal ysis set for the analy sis of efficacy .
The pharmacokinetic set (PKS): This patient set includes all patients in the TS who provided 
at least one PK parame ter that was not excluded because of protocol deviations relevant to 
the statistical evaluation of PK endpoints as defined in section 5.3.
Further anal ysis sets will be defined in the TSAP, if needed.

The primary  approach will include all data prior to the intercurrent event, so any  data 
collected after the intercurrent event will be excluded from the primary  analy sisexcept for 
the use of SGLT2i as concomitant medication . Patients will be analy sed acco rding to their 
randomised treatment. The anal ysis period for the primary  approach starts from 
randomisation to the Treatment Period until either intercurrent event or EoT at week 14, 
whichever comes first. This approach is analogous to a hy pothetical appro ach with respect to 
BI690517.
Supplementary  1 approach will include all data collected even after intercurrent event, except 
for death. Every  attempt will be made to follow up with patients who discontinue treatment 
prematurel y until the end of their plan ned stud y participation. Patients will be anal ysed 
according to their randomised treatment. The analy sis period for the supplementary  1 
approach starts from randomisation to 
the Treatment Period until EoT at week 14. This 
approach is anal ogous to the treat ment policy  appro ach.
Handling of intercurrent events that are not listed will be decided b y blinded review based on 
the general principle outlined and will be documented in the TSAP.

performed on the FAS.
For dose finding, multiple comparison procedures and modelling techniques (MCPMod) will 
be applied. The primary  estimand of interest is the treatment effect using the primary

Treatment effect
The primary  anal ysis will first address a dose -response relationship between doses of BI

pre-specified dose -response models with respect to the one- sided t ype I error at 5% after 
multiple comparisons adjustment. 
Dose finding
The second primary  objective is to determine the therapeutic dose. The trial will characterise 
the dose -response curve for BI [ADDRESS_885856] Morning Void urine after 
14 weeks of treatment with BI690517 or matching placebo. Patients will be evaluated by  [CONTACT_657235] r andomisation for primary  anal ysis in the MCPMod 
analysis.
The anal yses for dose -finding will be performed using MCPMod whereb y several possible 
dose response models (patterns) will be evaluated to identify  the best -fitting model or subset 
of models (refer toFigure 7.5: 1). If efficacy is established, the statistically  significant (best 
fitting) model(s) from the candidate set will be refitted to the data to generate new estimates 
for all model parameters from the data. The final model will be obtained via model averaging 
across the significant models based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The target 
dose(s) can be estimated from that model by  [CONTACT_657236] y. Doses within the dose range investigated 
(0 to 20 mg, total dail y dose) will be considered.

may be unblinded, measures are in place to ensure the blinding for e veryone else involved in 
the trial. Regular DMC meetings will be held at specified intervals. The DMC will 
recommend continuation, modification or termination of the trial as detailed in the DMC 
charter. DMC recommendations as well as the final BI decision will be reported to the 
appropriate Regulatory  Authorities (RAs) / Health Authorities (HAs), IRBs / ECs, and to 
investigators as requested by  [CONTACT_1769]. The tasks and responsibilities of the DMC are 
specified in a charter.
Relevant documentation on the participating (Principal) Investigators (e.g. their curricula 
vitae) will be filed in the ISF.
The investigators will have access to the BI web portal Clinergize to access documents 
provided b y the sponsor .
BI has appointed a Clinical Trial Leader respons ible for coordinating all required activities, in 
order to 
- manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal SOPs,
-direct the clinical trial team in the preparation, conduct, and reporting of the trial,
-ensure appropriate training an d information of Clinical Trial Managers (CT 
Managers ), Clinical Research Associates (CRAs), and investigators of participating 
countries.
In the participating countries the trial will be performed by  [CONTACT_88847]-organisation (Opera ting Unit, OPU) in accordance with applicable regulations and BI 
SOPs, or by  a Contract Research Organisation (CRO ) with which the responsibilities and 
tasks will have been agreed and a written contract filed before initiation of the clinical trial. .
Data Management and Statistical Evaluation will be done by  [CONTACT_15640].
Tasks and functions assigned in order to organise, manage, and evaluate the trial are defined 
according to BI SOPs. A list of responsible persons and relevant local information can be

Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_885891] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Description of change Addition of serum cortisol sample at Visit 1, pre and post 
dose Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, Visit 9, EoT, FUp1 and 
FUp2.
Addition of ACTH Challenge Test (if required) at Visit 5, 
Visit 6, Visit 7, Visit 8, Visit 9 and EoT.
Addition of 24- hour urine samples at Visit 5 and E oT.
Added ‘and 24 -hour urine ’ to‘Train the patient on FMV 
sampling’ .
Addition of ‘Dispense urine container for 24 -hour sampling’ 
at 
Visits 4 and 9.
Footnote 1: ACTH Challenge Test added as an example of a 
reason for additional visit.
Footnote 10 : Clarification of when ACTH Challenge Test is 
required added . 
Footnote 14: added that lab samples for serum cortisol must 
be collected before 10am.
Footnote 15: added the timing of the post -dose serum 
cortisol sample relative to drug administration.
Footnote 22 (previously  #20): Added requirement to collect 
start and stop times for [ADDRESS_885892] added (if required based on cortisol 
levels ) to investigate potential adrenal insufficiency during 
the study .
24-hour urine samples collected to measure urinary  free 
cortisol to determine whether BI 690517 may increase 
cortisol levels (Cushing’s 
syndrome) . 24-hour u rine 
collection times need to be recorded b y the patient on a 
paper diary .

-06  Clinical Trial Protocol Page 99of 121
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_885893] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Rationale for change In some countries pregnancy testing is required more 
frequentl y.
Section to be changed Flowchart
Description of change The text in footnote 20 (previously  #18) about pre -screening 
for UACR has been moved to footnote 2.  In addition, eGFR 
has been added as a test that patients can be pre -screened for 
if consent is given.
Rationale for change The text about eGFR has been added as this is not alway s 
done regularly , and patients could potentially  fail screening 
for this.  Allowing pre -screening for eGFR means fewer
unnecessary  screening procedures for patients who would 
not be eligible due to eGF R.
The UACR pre -screening text has been moved as it is more 
appropriate to have all screening text together.
Section to be changed Flowchart
Description of change Addition of “post -dose” in the split column header of Visit 
5. 
Removal of plasma aldosterone sample at Visit 2, paper 
diary  handout at Visit EoT and FUp1 and collection / review 
of paper diary  at Visit FUp 1 and FUp2.
Footnote 4: add ed‘all trial’ to the sentence ‘In case a patient 
needs or wishes to terminate [all trial] treatment 
prematurel y…’
Footnote 3: added eGFR to potassium as another safet y 
parameter that must be repeated in case of an unexpected 
delay  of Visit 5.
Footnote 10: In the following sentence 'in the patient’s 
medical record' was added: The time for the post ACTH -
injection blood samples must be recorded in the patient’s 
medical record.
Rationale for change Clarifications and corrections to ensure consistency with 
other sections of the protocol.   
eGFR and potassium are both critical parameter s for start of 
treatment with BI 690517. 
There will be no requirement to record the time of post 
ACTH- injection blood samples taken in the clinical 
database, as there is no analy sis done with it. Instead 
adherence to the protocol is going to be monitored b y 
reviewing the medical records at the site.

Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change Added “ Patients who must or wish to continue the intake of 
restricted medications (see section [IP_ADDRESS] )or any  drug 
considered likel y to interfere with the safe conduct of the

-06  Clinical Trial Protocol Page 102of 121
Proprietary confidential information © [ADDRESS_885900] -03(19.0) /Saved on:05Nov 2020Description of change Addition of exclusion criterion number 6: Treatment with 
biotin (Vitamin B7, Vitamin H, or coenzyme R) at daily  
doses ≥ 5 mg (including food supplements) within 72 hours 
of Visit 1 or planned during the trial.  
Rationale for change Intake of higher biotin doses has an influence on certain lab 
results and may  display  false results, e.g. for serum 
pregnancy  tests and some hormone tests.
Section to be c hanged 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change For exclusion criterion 7 (previousl y #6) , instead of an 
increase in serum cortisol of 200 nmol/L  at [ADDRESS_885901] -
injection, an absolute cortisol value of < 18 µg/dL (496.6
nmol/L )will be used as the diagnostic threshold for adrenal 
insufficiency .
Rationale for change ACTH Challenge test to be performed in accordance with 
the Cosy ntropin label and current U.S. guidelines, where the
threshold for exclusion of adrenal insufficiency  should be an
absolute cortisol value of >18 µg/dL [ADDRESS_885902] -
injection.
Both c onventional and SI units are specified to align with 
central laboratory  reporting .
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change For exclusion criterion 10 (previousl y #9), ‘Serum cortisol < 
5µg/dL (138.0 nmol/L )’ added to ‘An y clinical significant 
laboratory  abnormality ’.
Rationale for change Patients with serum cortisol < 5 µg/dL are at greater risk of 
adrenal insufficiency
 and should not be included in the trial.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria
Description of change For exclusion criterion 16 (previousl y #15) , ‘at the time of 
screening’ added to ‘Any documented active or suspected 
malignancy ’and ‘confirmed’ added to ‘ history  of confirmed 
malignancy  within two years prior to Visit 1.’
Rationale for change To clarify  that the suspected malignancy  is at the time of 
screening and not within two y ears prior to Visit 1 , and that 
any history  of malignancy  is confirmed.
Section to be changed 3.3.3 Exclusion criteria and [IP_ADDRESS] Restrictions 
Description of change For exclusion criterion 21 (previousl y #20), removal of ‘for 
an oral agent which is not specified in any  other exclusion 
criteria, or less that 12 months prior to Visit 1 since ending 
another investigational device or drug trial(s) for a biological 
agent which is not specified in exclusion criteria or

Section to be changed [IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatment
Description of change An individual patient will permanentl y discontinue all 
randomised trial treatment if:
1.The patient develops Acute Kidney  Injury  as per 
clinical judgement by  [CONTACT_1755]/or 
according to t he Kidney  Disease: Improving Global 
Outcomes (KDIGO) definition [ R17-2439] (see

clinical judgement by  [CONTACT_093] . The Kidney 
Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 
definition [ R17-2439 ] (see section 3.3.3 )should be 
used for guidance .
Rationale for change The definition of AK I according to KDIGO cannot alway s 
be applied in an outpatient setting, therefore AKI should be 
primarily  judged b y the investigator based on clinical 
presentation, and KDIGO can be used for guidance.
Section to be changed [IP_ADDRESS] Discontinuation of trial treatment

performed. If cortisol levels are < 3 µg/dL (82.8 nmol/L) 
patient should be withdrawn. This is to detect and mitigate 
the potential risk of ad renal insufficiency .

‘24-hour urine sample not required at EOT if patient 
discontinues prematurel y prior to start of treatment with BI 
690517 / matching placebo ’
Rationale for change 24-hour urine sample is required to assess the effect of BI 
690517 on urinary  free cortisol, therefore this sample is not 
required at EOT if a patient discontinues prematurely  during 
the Randomised Run -in period .

causing impaired liver function according to investigator’s 
judgement.’ to be reviewed a t screening (exclusion #24) and 
also prior to the second randomisation (exclusion # 2 6).
Rationale for change  
No dedicated trial in patients with liver 
impairment has been done. Expe rience from other 
compounds metabolised mainly  by [CONTACT_15924]2B7 enz ymes show 
that in patients with cirrhosis and liver impairment the 
exposure may  increase up to 4 -fold, therefore these patients

a substantial suppression of aldosterone, and it is expected 
that the lower 20 mg dose will result in l essaldosterone 
suppre ssion,reducing the risk of hyperkalaemia .’
Rationale for change Clarification that the 40 mg dose causes substantial 
suppression of aldosterone instead of total suppression and 
that 20 mg dose causes less aldosterone suppression.

Was changed to: 
‘A target of approximately  30% of patients will be 
randomised during the run- in period in each of the disease 
types: diabetic kidney  disease and non -diabetic kidney  
disease. ’  
Rationale for change Based on the ty pe of sites (e.g. gener al practices to sites 
specialized in nephrology ) involved in this study , observed 
actual distribution of diabetic kidney  disease vs. non- diabetic 
kidney  disease is approximately  70% vs. 30%. Therefore,
the trial is unlikely  to reach 40% of non- diabetic kid ney 
disease patients within the required recruitment time, and 
reducing the minimum required from 40% to 30% will not 
affect study  primary  objectives or main outcomes since the 
study outcomes are combined for both disease t ypes.
Section to be changed 3.3 Selection of Trial Population
Description of change If a patient has been randomised in error (did not meet all 
inclusion criteria or met one or more exclusion criteria), the 
sponsor or delegate should be contact[CONTACT_15608] . Based 
on an individual benefit -risk assessment a decision will be 
made whether continued trial participation is possible or not.
Was changed to:
The investigator will make every  effort to avoid the 
inclusion of a patient who does not meet all the inclusion 
criteria and/or meet s at least one exclusion criterion. Should 
such an error nevertheless occur, this patient might be 
immediately  excluded from the clinical trial based on 
individual benefit- risk assessment by  [CONTACT_093]. The 
sponsor or delegate will be informed as soo n as possible.
Rationale for change It should be the investigator who determines the benefit -risk 
assessment in case a patient is randomised in error, and not 
the sponsor.

Rationale for change To allow an earlier start of anal ysis, data will be unblinded 
after the last EoT visit instead of database lock

Section to be changed 5.2.3 Safet y Laboratory  Parameters
Description of change Sentence added: Ineligible lab parameters may  only  be re -
tested once during the screening period.’
Rationale for change Clarification that screening procedures should not repeatedly  
be retested until an eligible result is obtained.
Section to be changed [IP_ADDRESS] ACTH Challenge test
Description of change Paragraph added: Alternative conduct of the ACTH test is 
allowed only if it is in accordance with the local practice of 
diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency . If adrenal insufficiency  is

report to the sponsor.
Rationale for change Clarification that alternative methods of diagnosing adrenal 
insufficiency  are accepted if it is in accordance with local 
practice since some countries do not use the S hort Sy nacthen 
test as standard.

Section to be changed 5.5 Biobanking
Description of change Paragraph added: ‘In some countries, for example China, 
biobanking samples will not be collected due to regulatory  
reasons.’
Rationale for change Correction.  This should have been added in Amendment 1 
(see Appendix 11.1) but was missed from the section in 
error. Since Amendment 1, other countries will not be 
collecting biobanking samples so the sentence h as been 
updated.
Section to be changed 6.2.3 Screening and run- in period(s)
Description of change ‘after discussion with the sponsor’ removed from the 
sentence ‘ Patients who do not fulfil all eligibility  criteria for 
a reason that later resolves and allows eligibility  criteria to 
be met, may  be re -screened after discussion with the 
sponsor .’
Rationale for change It is not necessary  to discuss with the sponsor before 
rescreening a patient.

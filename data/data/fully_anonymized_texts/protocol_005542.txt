Title:   Detection of sentinel lymph nodes in female lower genital tract 
cancer patients with contrast -enhanced ultrasound imaging  
Summary : This is an open -label, non -randomized trial that will be conducted at 
Thomas Jefferson University (TJU).  This study will compare the use 
of lymphosonography for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection to the 
standard of care for lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_509221]’s staging (lymph node (LN) dissection and/or sequential PET -
CT). The pati ents will undergo an ultrasound examination to locate the 
tumor where a baseline grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound scan of the lesion will be obtained. The ultrasound contrast agent Sonazoid 
(GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) will be administrated in 4 aliquots at 
12, 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions around the primary tumor, with 0.[ADDRESS_658443] 
enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUS) will then be performed to 
identify the number, location and course of the l ymphatic channels 
(LCs) drainage from the tumor to the SLNs. All LNs that demonstrate contrast -
enhancement will be considered SLNs and their locations, 
depth beneath the skin surface and size (measured in three 
orthogonal dimensions) will be recorded and c ompared to the 
standard of care (i.e., to blue dye, pathology or PET -CT). An Aplio 
i800 scanner (Canon Medical Systems, Tustin, CA) with a curvilinear 
(8C1), a linear (18L5) and endovaginal (11C3) probes with CEUS 
capabilities will be used during the study . 
 
Objectives:  
  
 • Primary:  To determine the concordance between 
lymphosonography and the standard of care in the 
identification SLNs in patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar 
cancer.  
 
• Secondary: To determine if lymphosonography can identify 
more SLNs  with metastatic deposits in patients with cervical, 
vaginal or vulvar cancer when compared to the standard of 
care.

cancer (cervical, vaginal and vulvar) in 2018 leading to an estimated 6,700 deaths for a mortality 
rate of 27 % or 21 % of all female genital cancer deaths [Siegel et al. 2016]. The treatment 
approach varies according to the stage of the disease, and in the majority of the cases, the 
treatment protocols are similar between all 3 types of cancer. Early stages of disease (stage Ia 
and Ib for cervical and vulvar cancers, stage I for vaginal cancer) are treated with surgical 
intervention, and prior to the surgery the patients undergo PET -CT to determine lymph node (LN) 
metastatic infiltration. This parameter is used to determine the necessity of surgical LN dissection. 
However, the majority of women are diagnosed with advanced disease (stages 2, 3 and 4), where 
the treatment of c hoice is chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, with the use of PET -CT to determine 
LN metastatic infiltration pre - and post -treatment.  
Detection of subclinical malignancy in draining LNs is important in the management of a variety 
of malignancies including melanoma, breast, colon and other cancers, where the most important 
LN to evaluate is the sentinel lymph node (SLN), the first node to  receive afferent lymphatic Total 40: Obtain informed consent. Screen potential subjects by [CONTACT_64466]; obtain history, document.

Based on SKCC Interventional Protocol Template v.20170209  page 14 of 46 drainage through lymphatic channels (LCs) from the primary tumor [Morton & Chan 2000]. 
Various techniques and imaging agents have been developed to map lymphatic drainage from 
tumors, including injection of blue dye, indocyanine green with near -infrared fluorescence imaging 
and injection of radiopharmaceuticals (radioisotopes) followed by [CONTACT_509248] a gamma 
camera (i.e., lymphoscintigraphy) or intraoperatively with a gamma probe (isotope mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) 
[Goldfarb et al. 1998, Gimenez et al. 2001]. These surgical resection techniques and also the use 
of PET -CT to diagnosis and monitor of female lower genital tract cancers are in general accurate 
techniques, but pi[INVESTIGATOR_509224]. For example, the use of blue dye to identify SLNs requires surgical 
dissection that, in some cases, can be extensive (and multicentric) and all surgical procedures 
have inherent potential complications [Gimenez er al. 2001]. Radioactive materials make use of 
small particles and due to their size they may actually pass through the SLNs resulting in drainage into secondary LNs potentially resulting in a more extensive resection than might otherwise be needed [Goldfarb et al. 1998,] or a change in the staging of the disease, upgrading to a more 
advanced disease t han the reality.   
PET-CT systems combine positron emission tomographic (PET) scanners and computed 
tomographic (CT) scanners, which provides images of both anatomic and functional information 
in a single study. However, this combination result in PET/CT examinations, especially those that 
include a diagnostic CT study, with increased patient radiation exposure compared to stand- alone 
CT or PET examinations (as the effective dose is a combination of the dose from PET and the dose from CT). Studies, such as Huang et al. 2009, were conducted to determine the potential 
risk from radiation exposure, and the risk -benefit ratios were assessed. The conclusion was that 
total effective dose from each PET/CT study was about five to thirteen times (12- 31 mSy) the 
world wide average effective dose from background radiation over 1 year, which is estimated to 
be about 2.4 mSv [Huang et al. 2009]. In addition, patients with cancer often undergo multiple 
PET/CT examinations for response assessment and treatment monitoring, and given that survival 
rates are markedly improved nowadays, this increases the concern that in time this cumulative 
radiation dose can increase the chance of radiation exposure induced cancer. Therefore, the 
development a non -radiation based imaging alternative is necessary.  
Diagnostic ultrasound (US) imaging has been used to evaluate LNs for benign disease as well as 
metastases, however conventional ultrasound cannot be used for lymphatic mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], since mappi[INVESTIGATOR_509225] a tracer. This paradigm changed with t he development of 
stable (i.e., encapsulated), gas -filled microbubbles as ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) 
[Goldberg et al. 2001]. UCA microbubbles have particle sizes of 2- 8 µm that, after intravenous 
administration, serve as vascular tracers typi[INVESTIGATOR_509226] 20- 25 dB of echo enhancement for 3-
10 minutes [Goldberg et al. 2001]. Also there are tissue- specific UCAs, which are taken -up by [CONTACT_509249] (RES) [Forsberg et al. 2002]. One such tissue- specific UCA is 
Sonazoid (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) composed of a lipid stabilized suspension of 
perfluorobutane microbubbles with a median diameter of 2.4 -3.5 µm [Sontum 2008]. This agent 
is taken up by [CONTACT_509250] 
[Forsber g et al. 2002].  
The initial proof of concept that some UCAs are taken up by [CONTACT_509251] (in rabbits) and can be localized 
using CEUS was reported by [CONTACT_509252], San Diego [Mattrey et al. 
Genital Cancer SLN   Version4.0

Based on SKCC Interventional Protocol Template v.20170209  page 15 of 46 1999]. Our subsequent investigations, using a  swine model with naturally occurring melanoma 
tumors and funded by [CONTACT_6812], established that the accuracy of SLN detection was 81.8% for 
lymphosonography, which was significantly higher than the 63.2% achieved with 
lymphoscintigraphy (p < 0.0001) based on  imaging 351 SLNs in 63 swine [Goldberg et al. 2011].   
The clinical translation of lymphosonography is being actively pursued in two different ongoing, 
NCI-supported clinical trials, one designed to investigate the diagnostic utility of 
lymphosonography f or SLN identification in women scheduled for surgical excision of a malignant 
breast mass and the other to investigate the diagnostic utility of lymphosonography for SLN identification in patients undergoing endoscopic ultrasound guided biopsy of esophageal cancer. 
By [CONTACT_44579] a UCA into the peritumoral tissues and following its uptake in the LCs using CEUS, 
our group can identify the specific location and number of SLNs draining from the primary tumor. 
The results will be compared to the established techniques currently in use. Lymphosonography 
used for SLN detection has several potential advantages. Lymphosonography does not require ionizing radiation (a growing concern in medicine) and has markedly better spatial resolution as 
well as anatomical informat ion, which would allow for more precise SLN localizations; also the 
portability of US equipment lends itself to use at the patient's bedside, within the surgical suite or 
elsewhere as necessary. Lymphosonography can be used to clearly delineate adjacent LN s and 
to identify tumor involvement using conventional US criteria [Goldberg et al. 2011], which is not 
possible with the use of a gamma probe or by [CONTACT_509253]. Finally, the improvement in 
SLN detection in patients with breast cancer (from 1.67 to 2.16 SLNs/patient) achieved by [CONTACT_509254]- specific lymphoscintigraphy agent Tilmanocept [Tokin et al. 2012], indicates that the 
much larger improvement seen with lymphosonography and the RES -specific UCA Sonazoid (3.2 
SLNs/patient) has the potential to change the clinical paradigm for SLN identification. Hence, this project is a natural translation of our experiences with lymphosonography in breast and esophageal cancer patients and it aims to shift the clinical paradigm on mappi[INVESTIGATOR_509227].  
The safety of subdermal injections of Sonazoid was determined in a safety study conducted by 
[CONTACT_27156] [Machado et al. 2018]. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of subdermal 
administration of t wo dosages Sonazoid (1 and 2 ml) in the breasts of healthy, female volunteers 
with screening and baseline assessments/procedures that included informed consent, medical 
history, demography, physical examination, vital signs and a focused physical exam as w ell as 
recording of any adverse events (AEs). Only minor local and insignificant adverse experiences 
confined to the injection site and surrounding area were encountered by [CONTACT_509255], local 
redness was seen in 83% of the cases, local pain in 33% of the cases and local bruising in 25% 
of the cases [Machado et al. 2018]. All adverse experiences (Table 1) were completely resolved 
without any intervention by [CONTACT_509256].

Sonazoid Intravenous Clinical Safety Trials 
Prior to the development of lymphsonography and the subdermal use of UCA, clinical trials were 
done to evaluate the safety of intravenous use of Sonazoid.  
Sonazoid was administered intravenous (IV) in clinical trials in 1699 patients.  In these patients 
404 (23.8%) reported at least one AE, while 12 of 62 (19.4%) of patients receiving a placebo 
reported AEs.  
Forty -three (2.5%, 43/1699) subjects experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), including [ADDRESS_658447] commonly noted AEs  were headache (3.6%, 62/1699), 
chest pain (2.3%, 39/1699), abdominal pain  (1.5%, 25/1699), diarrhea (1.5%, 25/1699), and 
nausea (1.6%, 28/1699). The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity (92.6%, 652/704).  
The proposed agent for the current study, Sonazoid® (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway), is a sterile non-pyrogenic su spension of lipid stabilized perfluorobutane microbubbles for contrast -
enhancement, with a median diameter between 2.4 and 3.5 µm [Sontum 2008].  The FDA has yet 
to approve Sonazoid for human use in this country.  Consequently, we intend to amend our current 
investigator initiated IND (#127,419) exemption from the FDA covering the subdermal use of 
Sonazoid to also cover female lower genital cancers. This IND was originally set up for breast 
cancer and was subsequently amended to also include esophageal canc ers. 
1.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study  
Women with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancers will undergo surgical resection and/or chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy of their cancer (depending on their staging). The SLN mappi[INVESTIGATOR_509228] -CT, for patients with 
stage I that undergo surgical resection there is an additional SLN mappi[INVESTIGATOR_509229]. The standard of care for the surgical group of patients is LN dissection usually bilateral given the midline anatomical location of the female lower genital tract. Patients with tumors of higher stages that undergo chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy undergo systematic 
PET-CT for the continuing SLN staging during treatment. However, each of these methods has 
potential limitations that can impact the detection of SLNs and the accuracy of disease staging.  
Our group has demonstrated that CEUS after subdermal administration of a tissue- specific 
ultrasound contrast agent such as Sonazoid, can be used to noninvasively map lymphatic drainage and localize SLNs (so called “lymphosonography”).  Our NIH funded investigations using 
the Sinclair swine model with naturally occurring melanomas have confirmed that CEUS is superior to radioisotope imaging; de tecting almost 20 % more SLNs.

care. 
1.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
The known risks from the subdermal administration of Sonazoid are minimal.  Only minor local 
and non- significant adverse experiences confined to the injection site and surrounding area were 
encountered by [CONTACT_509255], local redness was seen in 83% of the cases, local pain in 33% of 
the cases and local bruising in 25% of the cases.  
UCAs in general are very safe with serious anaphylactoid- type reactions reported for intravenous 
injection at a rate of less than 0.01% [Dietri ch et al., 2020].  
The use of an intravenous needle and the fluids given through the needle may cause minor 
discomfort, bleeding under the skin (bruise), and possible infection at the site of needle insertion 
(although that is extremely unlikely).  Clinical ly significant adverse effects from the administration 
of Sonazoid are unlikely.  Hence, the use of subdermal injection of contrast with the contrast -
specific ultrasound imaging technique is expected to provide significantly more information than 
conventional ultrasound techniques.  This may lead to a non- invasive method for identification of 
SLNs.  
The cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer treatment is being performed as a part of the patient’s 
clinical care and therefore, the risks that are associated with t he treatment are not related to the 
research.  The subjects’ alternative is not to participate in this study and have only the scheduled 
standard of care treatment performed.   
1.3.[ADDRESS_658449] study files will be stored in a secure file cabinet and maintained by [CONTACT_509258].  Study files will be kept for 7 years after the completion of the study.  The PI [CONTACT_403247] ([CONTACT_509290] berg) and his co- investigators have previous experience running ultrasound clinical 
trials and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_509230].  He will be responsible for ensuring all AEs are 
properly reported.  
The final data will be entered into a database implem ented in REDCap (Vanderbilt University, 
Nashville, TN). The investigators will be responsible for management of the database. The 
database will be maintained within an organized and secure directory system. Subject 
identification will be maintained with a study specific alphanumeric code (G YN), patient number 
(01 and onwards) and the patient’s initials.

care.  
Primary hypothesis: Does lymphosonography identify more SLNs in patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer than the standard of care?  The fundamental hypothesis is that 
on average lymphosonography will detect  20 % more SLNs than the standard of care.  
Secondary hypothesis: Does lymphosonography identify more SLNs with metastatic deposits in patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer compared to the standard of 
care?  The fundamental hypothesis is that approximately 20% more cancerous SLNs will 
be detected with CEUS.  
2.1.2  Primary Objectives  
The primary objectives of this trial are:  
1. To determine the concordance between lymphosonography and the standard of care in 
the identification SLNs in patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer.  
 
2. To determin e if lymphosonography can identify more SLNs with metastatic deposits in 
patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer when compared to the standard of care.   
2.2 Endpoints/Outcome Measures  
The findings of lymphosonography will be compared with other imaging and pathological findings 
when available; including vascularity as well as the clinical outcome as determined by [CONTACT_509259]4.0

4.2 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention 
Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient’s care treatment team, 
the investigator or a research team member.  Investigators will then screen the patient’s medical 
records to determine the subject eligibility for study participation and discuss the study with the patient and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Consenting patients will be screened based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria above.  
An investigator or research coordinator will explain the study to the pati ent. The patient will be 
given time to consider the risks and benefits of the study and ask questions about participation. The consent form will be reviewed with the patient and then the patient will be given the form to 
review. If consent interview is conducted by a coordinator, a study investigator will then discuss 
the study with the subject and answer any additional questions. The patient, person conducting 
study interview (if applicable), and a study investigator will all sign the consent form. The pat ient 
will be given a copy of the signed consent form for her records.  
Trial participants will have the presence of inclusion criteria and absence of exclusion criteria 
verified by [CONTACT_1541] a medical history. A full demographic profile, known drug allergies or 
intolerances, and a review of the subject’s medical/surgical hist ory will be recorded. If the subject 
is a woman of childbearing potential, she will have a urine pregnancy test (the results of which 
will be made available to the subject prior to study initiation).

7 Study Procedures and Evaluations  
7.1 Study Procedures/Evaluations  
As outlined in section 5.7:  
• Medical history  
• Lymphosonography  
8 Evaluation of Safety  
8.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
8.1.1  Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated problems (UAPs) include,  in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets the following criteria:  
• unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol -related doc uments, such as the IRB -approved research 
protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the participant  
population being studied;  
UAPs are considered to pose ri sk to participant s or others when they  suggest  that the research 
places participant s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, 
economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
8.1.2  Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical oc currence in a human participant , 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the participant ’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to the participant ’s participation in the research.  
The safety of subdermal injections of Sonazoid was determined in a safety study conducted by 
[CONTACT_27156] [Machado et al. 2018]. The study assessed the safety and tolerability of subdermal administration of two dosages Sonazoid (1 and 2 ml) in the breasts of healthy, female volunteers 
with screening and baseline assessments/procedures that included informed consent, medical 
history, demography, physical examination, vital signs and a focused physical exam as wel l as 
recording of any adverse events (AEs). Only minor local and insignificant adverse experiences 
confined to the injection site and surrounding area were encountered by [CONTACT_509255], local redness was seen in 83% of the cases, local pain in 33% of the cases and local bruising in 25% 
of the cases [Machado et al. 2018]. All adverse experiences were completely resolved without

Sonazoid was administered intravenous (IV) in clinical trials in 1699 patients.  In these patients 
404 (23.8%) reported at least one AE, while 12 of 62 (19.4%) of patients receiving a placebo 
reported AEs.  
Forty -three (2.5%, 43/1699) subjects experienced serious adverse events (SAEs), including [ADDRESS_658480] commonly noted AEs were headache (3.6%, 62/1699), chest pain (2.3%, 39/1699), abdominal pain (1.5%, 25/1699), diarrhea (1.5%, 25/1699),  and 
nausea (1.6%, 28/1699). The majority of AEs were mild to moderate in severity (92.6%, 652/704).  
8.1.3  Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is one that meets one or more of the following criteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (places the participant  at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred)  
• Is disabling or incapacitating 
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect

be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
8.[ADDRESS_658481] be documented for each AE occurring 
during the time period specified in Section 8.2  Safety Assessment and Follow -Up. If the patient 
has experienced AE(s), the investigator will record the following information in the AE log:  
• The nature of the event(s) will be described by [CONTACT_509268] (i.e. not necessarily the exact words used by [CONTACT_102]).  
• The duration of the event will be described in terms of event onset date and event ended data.  
• The intensity of the AE will be described according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE), for details see National Cancer Institute home page 
http:\ evs.n ci.nih.gov \ftp1\CTCAE \About.html
 of the AE. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 
through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general 
guideline:  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated.  
• Grade 2:  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self care activities of daily living.  
• Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
• Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
• The Causal relationship of the event t o the study medication will be assessed as one of the 
following: 
• Unrelated : There is not a temporal relationship to investigational product 
administration (too early, or late, or investigational product not taken), or there is 
a reasonable causal relationship between noninvestigational product, concurrent 
disease, or circumstance and the AE.  
• Unlikely : There is a temporal relationship to investigational product 
administration, but there is not a reasonable causal relationship between the 
investigational product and the AE.  
• Possible: There is reasonable causal relationship between the investigational 
product and the AE. Dechallenge information is lacking or unclear.  
• Probable: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE. The event responds to dechallenge. Rechallenge is not 
required.  
• Definite: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product and the AE.

Based on SKCC Interventional Protocol Template v.20170209  page 34 of 46 In addition to the PI’s responsibility for oversight, study oversight will be under the direction of the 
SKCC’s Data  and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The SKCC DSMC operates in 
compliance with a Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that is approved by [CONTACT_6812] .  
10 Clinical Site Monitoring and Auditing 
Clinical site monitoring  and auditing is conducted to ensure that the rights of human participant s 
are protected, that the study is implemented in accordance with the protocol and/or other 
operating procedures, and that the quality and integrity of study data and data coll ection methods 
are m aintained. Monitoring and auditing for this study will be performed in accordance with the 
SKCC’s Data and Safety Monitoring Plan ( DSMP) developed by [CONTACT_509273] (DSMC) . The DSMP specifies  the frequency of monitoring, moni toring 
procedures, the level of clinical site monitoring activities (e.g., the percentage of participant  data 
to be reviewed), and the distribution of monitoring reports. Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will take place at  the study site(s) . Appropriate staff will conduct 
monitoring activities and provide reports of the findings and associated action items in accordance 
with the  details described in the SKCC DSMP.
 
[ADDRESS_658488] of care is either blue dye injections (it the subject goes t o surgery) 
or PET -CT results (if the subject goes to chemotherapy) as part of their management.  
In this study we do not focus on whether an SLN is correctly identified, as there is no way of knowing that (unless the subject goes for surgery and the SLN has  metastatic deposits but his 
will only be the case for a small subset) and the number of SLNS not identified by 
[CONTACT_509274], for obvious reasons, be unknown. Hence, we 
presume all identified SLN are correctly identified.  
11.1 Study Hypotheses  
Primary hypothesis: Does lymphosonography identify more SLNs in patients with cervical, vaginal 
or vulvar cancer than the standard of care? The fundamental hypothesis is that on average 
lymphosonography will detect 20% more SLN s than the  standard of care . 
Secondary hypothesis: Does lymphosonography identify more SLNs with metastatic deposits in 
patients with cervical, vaginal or vulvar cancer compared to the standard of care?  The 
fundamental hypothesis is that approximately 20% more canc erous SLNs will be detected with 
CEUS.  
 H1: O n average lymphosonography will detect 20% more SLN than the standard of care  (blue 
dye or PET- CT). 
H10 The mean number of SLNs per subject identified by [CONTACT_509275] 
120% of thoset identified by [CONTACT_9518].

Based on SKCC Interventional Protocol Template v.[ADDRESS_658489] identified by [CONTACT_509276] 120% of those  identified by [CONTACT_9518].  
 H2: On average 20% more cancerous SLNs will be detected by [CONTACT_509277] y than by 
[CONTACT_9518] (i.e., blue dye) using pathology as the reference standard .  
H20 The % of metastatic SLNs identified by [CONTACT_509275]  120% of that 
identified by [CONTACT_9518].  
H2a The % of metastatic SLNs identified by [CONTACT_509278] 120% of 
that identified by [CONTACT_9518].

For the secondary hypothesis the percentage of SLNs with metastatic deposits  identified by 
[CONTACT_509280]- sample t -test or Wilcoxon test  (again after testing for 
normalcy). The histopatholog ical assessment of the surgically removed LNs will serve as the 
reference standard.  
11.3 Interim Analyses and Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_509239].

The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or an SAE.  
11.3.2  Efficacy Review  
See section 11.2  
11.4 Sample Size Considerations  
The sample size analysis is based on the primary aim of this study (i.e., on Aim 1) and  assumes 
that on average lymphosonography will detect 20% more SLN than the standard of care (blue dye 
or PET -CT]. Hence, a power analysis was performed using NCSS/PASS 2019  (NCSS, East 
Kaysville, UT ) and a  sample size of 40 patients achieves 86.9% power to detect the effect size of

11.5 Exploratory Analysis 
The statistical analyses above will be repeated split by [CONTACT_105975], but no firm conclusions are 
expected given this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_48505] a limited sample size.  
11.6 Handling Screen Failure/Subject Discontinuation  
Subjects will be free to discontinue trial participation at any time. The investigator will also 
discontinue any subject from the trial if, in the investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not safe for the subject 
to continue. The date the subject is withdrawn from a treatment and/or from the trial and the 
reason for discontinuation will be recorded on the CRF.   
If a subject's participation in the trial is interrupted for any reason (e.g., because of an AE) and 
the subject has met the criteria described above for completing the trial, the subject's trial participation will be considered completed. If a subject's trial participation is interrupted for any 
reason by [CONTACT_423]'s or investigator's choice and the subject has not met all of the criteria listed 
above, t hen the subject will be considered a discontinued subject.  
12 Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents  
Study staff will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this study, in compliance 
with ICH E6, and regulatory and institutional r equirements for the protection of confidentiality of 
participant  information . Study staff will permit authorized representatives of SKCC  and regulatory 
agencies to examine (and when required by [CONTACT_1289], to copy) research records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study safety, progress and 
data validity.   
Source Data Verification 
The investigator will be visited on a regular basis by [CONTACT_39613]. Monitoring will include 
source data verification (SDV) and discuss the progress of the study.  SDV is confirmed by [CONTACT_509281]’s research binder.

Whenever possible, an original recording of an observation should be retained as the source 
document.  However, a photocopy of a record is acceptable provided it is legible and is a verified 
copy of the original document.  
15.5 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH), Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and protocol -specific guidelines. The 
deviation (any activity conducted outside the parameters established by [CONTACT_760]) may be either on the part of the participant, the investigator, or the study site staff and may or may not 
pose a risk to participants or others or may affect the integrity of the data obtained from the study.    
The risk posed by [CONTACT_89629], to the study or the study participant gives rise to an Unanticipated 
problem (UAP). It is crucial to document the deviation/unanticipated problem in the protocol deviation log (Appendix D) and submitted to the IRB as per  the sites regulations.  As a result of 
deviations, corrective actions are to be developed and implemented promptly.   
UAPs and protocol deviations that pose risk  to participants or others, and that are not AEs, or that 
affect study integrity will be submitted to the IRB via the <eazUP system> within [ADDRESS_658503] be entered in the deviation log (Appendix D) and submitted to the IRB at the next continuing review.

Based on SKCC Interventional Protocol Template v.20170209  page 41 of 46 The relationship or association of the AE to the Sonazoid administration will be characterized as 
"unlikely," "possible," or "probable."  A relationship assessment will be performed by [CONTACT_509285] a data form.  The investigator will refer to the Sonazoid investigator brochure for assistance in determining AE 
relationship.  
An "unlikely" relationship indicates that there is little or no chance that Sonazoid caused the 
reported AE; other conditions, including concurrent illnesses, progression or expression of the 
disease state, or a reaction to a concurrent medication, appear to explain the reported AE.  
A "possible" relationship indicates that the association of the AE with Sonazoid is unknown.  
However, the AE is not reasonably attributed to any other condition.  
A "probable" relationship indicates that a reasonable temporal association exists between the AE 
and Sonazoid administration and, based upon the investigator's clinical experience, the 
association of the event with the trial medication seems likely.

 [ADDRESS_76811] of the mindfulness program on 
psychological well -being  for stroke survivors and caregivers to guide the development of a 
future intervention study.  
The process of development of the online mindfulness program will be iterative and will 
involve three phases: one development phase, one usability testing phase with end -users and 
one refinement phase.  
Phase 1) The 3-week online mindfulness program will b e adapted from the program developed 
for individuals with amy otrophic lateral sclerosis by [CONTACT_70508].  
Phase 2 ) A testing phase will be conducted remotely for both technic al and clinical verification 
with 5 -10 stroke survivors and 5 -10 caregivers.  Self-reported questionnaires about 
psychological well -being will be administered prior to and after the participation to the 
program and at a 1 -month follow -up. After the program,  a usability questionnaire and a semi -
structured interview will be conducted to assess the usability of the mindfulness program and 
gather  participants’ feedback. For each group, differences prior to and after the mindfulness 
program will be assessed using  a repeated measure analysis of variance . The transcribed 
verbatim of the semi -structured interview will be analyzed independently using thematic 
content analysis by 2 members of the research team.  
Phase 3 ) Based on the results from Phase 2, modifications will be made to the online 
mindfulness program. If warranted, the testing phase will be replicated with up to a second 
cohort of participants.  
 This project will lead to the development of an online mindful ness program suitable for 
stroke survivors and their caregivers to improve quality of life and psychological well -being. This 
project will help guide the development of a planned intervention study.  
 
  
 [ADDRESS_76812] 25.7 million, with the majority of global stroke burden being in low -income and middle -
income countries (Feigin et al., 2014) . Stroke is a complex and mu ltifaceted medical condition. 
The consequences of stroke and the severity of the symptoms are heterogeneous with possible 
sensorimotor, cognitive, perceptual, social and psychological sequelae, impacting activity and 
participation (Mayo et al., 2002) . At o ne-year post -stroke, evidence support that community -
dwelling stroke survivors have poor perceived physical health (Patel et al., 2006) , and high 
levels of dissatisfaction from life correlating with activity limitations and restricted participation 
(Hartma n-Maeir et al., 2007) . In the long -term, depression and cognitive impairments are 
strong predictors of reduced health -related quality of life (Haacke et al., 2006) . Depression is 
common after stroke, with an incidence of 29 -33% in different stages of strok e recovery and a 
cumulative incidence of up to 52% within 5 years (Ayerbe et al., 2013; Hackett et al., 2005) . The 
occurrence of anxiety disorders and anxiety symptoms is also frequent, affecting 20 -25% of 
stroke survivors (Campbell Burton et al., 2013) .  
 
The considerable psychosocial impact of stroke extends to  spouse and family members, and 
close friends taking the role of caregivers (Low et al., 1999; Rigby [CONTACT_2297]., 2009) . Caregivers play a 
crucial role in preserving rehabilitation gains  and levels of in dependence , and maintaining 
stroke survivors in the community  and the long -term well -being of stroke survivors  (Rigby [CONTACT_2297]., 
2009; Visser -Meily et al., 2006) . However, the caregiver burden, which describ es the weight or 
load carried by [CONTACT_70509] a res ult of adopting the caregiving role, is estimated to 25 -54% 
(Rigby [CONTACT_2297]., 2009) . In caregivers of individuals who have had a stroke , diminished general 
health, vitality,  and mental health are often reported (Anderson et al., 1995; Morimoto et al., 
2003) . The prevalence of depression  amongst stroke caregivers  is much higher than in older 
community -dwelling adults (Morimoto et al., 2003) . The caregiver strain can be attributed to 
the caregivers’ mood, increased patient disability, anxiety, and depression,  and caregivers’ 
negative affectivity  (Blake et al., 2003; McCullagh et al., 2005) . 
 
To date, some of the most promising clinical treatments for the reduction of distress, the 
improvement of psychological well -being and help for people trying to cope with a  chronic 
disorder are based on the concept of mindfulness  ([LOCATION_009]sco Pagnini & Philips, 2015) . 
Mindfulness is defined as the process of actively making new distinctions about a situation and 
its environment, or its current context , rather than relying on p revious categorizations (Langer, 
2018; Langer, 2014; Langer & Moldoveanu, 2000) . When mindful, we are actively engaged in 
the present and sensitive to both contexts (i.e., “What is our present situation?”) and 
perspectives (i.e., “How are we viewing the si tuation, and how might others view it?”). A 
mindful perspective denotes the ability to assume multiple views about the present context, 
and to be aware of the current contextual details, which itself encourages greater engagement 
– the essence of mindfulne ss itself. Mindfulness can be seen as a mental state that includes 
awareness, flexibility, openness, and creativity. By [CONTACT_22242], mindlessness occurs when one 
considers only a single perspective about an event or a situation and reflects a reliance on 
auto matic or repetitive thought processes, judgments and behavior. In this way, mindlessness is 
similar to being trapped in a rigid mindset and unaware of individual and contextual changes. 
 4 The mindless processing of information and experience does not allow f or reconsideration and 
reinterpretation, maintaining a pre -determined perspective  (Carson & Langer, 2006) . The 
tendency to approach situations as if they were unchanging may be particularly problematic in 
physical health (Giardino et al., 2000) , and particularly so in illnesses diagnosed as chronic or 
life-threatening. Previous studies indicate that many presumed physical or psychological limits 
are a result of mindlessness and may benefit by [CONTACT_70510]  (Langer, 2012) . While 
some explorati on has begun, there is significant clinical potential to be explored in the 
construct of mindfulness as it relates to chronic disease. Through the practice of mindfulness, a 
more serene and balanced emotional and affective state can be achieved, which is a  beneficial 
precondition for stress resistance and resilience (Teasdale et al., 1995) . Mindfulness increases 
one’s ability to cope with the challenges of the environment, and aids in developi[INVESTIGATOR_70500]’s own condition.  
 
In a number of studies, mindfulness programs based on Langer’s mindfulness theory have been 
shown to increase mindfulness in the general population or other cohorts (Alexander et al., 
1989; Grant et al., 2004; Langer, 1993, 2000, 2009; Langer & Moldoveanu, 2000) . One exa mple 
is an online mindfulness intervention program for individuals with amy otrophic lateral sclerosis 
(ALS)  and their caregivers.  Following the treatment, people with ALS who participated in the 
online mindfulness program reported higher quality of life an d a lower level of negative 
emotions, anxiety, and depressive symptoms , compared to the wait -list control group . Similarly, 
the caregivers reported lower levels of care burden, depression, and anxiety, and improved 
values of emotional well -being and social  functioning  (Pagnini et al., 2017) . Most of these 
differences remained stable over time, indicating a stability of the effect, at least for the few 
months after that. Recently, it also been adapted for individuals with multiple sclerosis (Pagnini 
et al., in preparation) . Given the favorable  results for individuals with other neurological 
conditions and their caregivers, an online mindfulness program is promising for individuals 
post -stroke and their caregivers to increase mindfulness, decrease anxiety and depression and 
encourage stroke survivors to change their beliefs about their disability.  
 
Aim 
The aims of this project are: 1) to develop an online mindfulness program for stroke survivors 
and their caregivers, 2) to pi[INVESTIGATOR_70501], ease -of-use, satisfaction, 3) to estima te the potential impact on 
quality of life, anxiety, depression and sleep quality in the short term, and 4) to obtain a final 
version suitable for individuals who have had a stroke with a wide range of impairments and 
their caregivers. It is hypothesized t hat the online mindfulness program will be well accepted 
and perceived as easy to use by [CONTACT_70511]. It is anticipated that 
minor modifications will be suggested to improve understandability and relevance for the 
participants.  
 
Methods  
The process of development of the online mindfulness program will be iterative and will involve 
three  phases : one development phase, one usability testing phase with end -users and one 
refinement phase. An online program was selected to provide the opportunity for individuals 
 5 who may not be mobile enough to attend face -to-face classes in a rehabilitation, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70502] a remote area to participate.  
 
Phase 1 – Development of the online mindfulness program  
The first phase  of the study focuses on the development of a three -week online mindfulness 
program, with distinct modules for individuals who have had a stroke and for caregivers. The 
modules are based on a mindfulness program initially developed for individuals with ALS and 
caregivers (Pagnini et al., 2017) . To ensure suitability and relevance for individuals with stroke 
with a wide range of impairments and disabilities, a group of experts consisting of experienced 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], stroke rehabilitation researchers, stroke  survivors and mindfulness experts revised 
and adapted the content of the program. Stroke -specific exercises were also incorporated into 
the program to ensure the exercises made sense  from stroke survivors’ and caregivers’ points 
of view. The purpose of th e online mindfulness program is to  increase participants’ mindfulness  
and improve psychological state. The mindfulness program also encourages stroke survivors to 
change their beliefs about their disability. For caregivers, the program is designed to help 
caregivers better accept themselves and the individual who has sustained a stroke as 
autonomous and unique human beings rather than as a caregiver and a stroke survivor.  
 
The online mindfulness will be hosted on the USC Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy  
continuing education platform named Desire2learn. Desire2learn is a user -friendly, commonly 
used platform in higher education. The content of the program will be access ible via a 
computer or a smartphone. Additional features of this platform include a dis cussion forum , 
exercise submission , ability to contact a member of the research team to ask  questions about 
the program or to report any adverse events , and flexibility and ease to modify the content for 
the instructors .  
 
For each of the three weeks, educational texts, exercises, audio recordings and videos will be 
available on the Desire2Learn platform. The general structure of the program will mix different 
mindfulness elements, with specific topi[INVESTIGATOR_70503]. The topi[INVESTIGATOR_70504]: attention to variability, positive and negative events, unpredictability, sense making and 
novelty seeking and novelty producing (for detailed description of each topic, see Appendix 1). 
Exercises related to practical mod ifications to daily life activities will be provided across all 
weeks. During the program, participants will learn to experience new ways to engage in the 
present, increasing self -acceptance and learning to reduce their focus on the negative aspects 
of the ir disability. Specific exercises will be used to introduce the concepts of “negative” and 
“positive” point of views. Moreover, exercises in acceptance and positive communications 
between participants and caregivers will be introduced, in order to create a  positive 
relationship between participants’ psychological wellbeing and that of others.  Each new 
concept related to mindfulness specifically targeted for stroke survivors living in the community 
and their caregivers will be introduce d. The participant’s acceptance of uncertainty will be 
addressed with reflections and exercises. To minimize the cognitive burden of reading while 
accomplishing the exercises, all exercises for the stroke survivors will have an audio track 
available, in addition to the written  text.  
 
 6 Phase 2 – Beta -testing of the online mindfulness program  
Data collection : A testing phase will be conducted for both technical and clinical verification. 
During this phase, we plan to recruit a convenience sample of 5-[ADDRESS_76813] had a stroke and caregivers  (wide range of impairments, fami liarity with computers, 
age, sex , gender, ethnicity , race  and socio -economic backgrounds ).   
  
Inclusion criteria:  
• Aged older than 18 years old  
• Diagnosis of stroke  (for stroke survivors)  
• Ability to access Internet using a computer, a tablet and/or a smartphone  
• Ability to provide informed consent  
• Fluent in English  
 
Exclusion criter ia:  
• Severe language impairments  
• Regular meditation or participation in a mindfulness program in past 3months  
 
The participation to this project will be done completely remot ely using the HIPAA compliant 
platforms Zoom and REDCap for informed signed consent  and patient -reported outcomes . The 
online mindfulness program will be offered continuously, so participants will be able to enroll in 
the study at any time during the data collection period. Prior to the start of the online 
mindfulness program, an online meeting will be scheduled with  each participant . Each meeting 
will be done separately for stroke survivors and caregivers, even if participants are living 
together  and are enrolled at the same time . During the first online meeting , participants will be 
informed of the procedures involved with the study and written consent will be obtained  using 
the REDCap platform . Basic socio -demographic , stroke or caregiving -relat ed information will be 
collected to characterize the study participants. A description of the mindfulness program and 
details on how to navigate the online platform will be offered. P articipants will be also 
instructed on how to share their computer screen  with the researcher  for beta -testing of the 
online program . 
 
While sharing their screen, participants will log in on the online mindfulness program website, 
watch the introductory videos and complete the exercises for the first day. A researcher will 
reco rd of any difficulties experienced with accessing  or navigating  the online platform, 
assistance provided, technical issues, spontaneous feedback reported by [CONTACT_4317], and time 
to complete the exercises (in minutes). Additional validated outcome measure s will be given 
before, after the online mindfulness program and at a 1 -month follow -up to guide a future 
intervention study (i.e. feasibility and preliminary effect of the online program). For stroke 
survivors, quality of life  and impact of stroke, anxiet y and depression, perceived stress , and 
sleep quality will be assessed: 1) Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) (Duncan et al., 2003) , 2) Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_70505] (HADS ; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) , 3) NIH Perceived Stress Survey, 
 7 and 4) Single -Item Sleep Quality Scale (Snyder et al., 2018) . For caregivers, quality of life, 
anxiety and depression, perceived burden , perceived stress  and sleep quality will be assessed: 
1)  World Health Organization Quality of Life -BREF (WHOQOL -BREF; World Health Organization, 
1998) , 2) HADS,  3) Zarit Burden Interview (Zarit et al., 1980) , 4) NIH Perceived Stress Survey, 
and 5)  Single -Item Sleep Quality Scale. All outcome measures will be administered remotely 
using the REDCap platform.  Specifically, a link  to access the REDCap questionnaires will be sent 
by [CONTACT_70512]. With the guidance from the researcher, participants will complete each self -reported 
questionnaire.   
 
For each week of the online mindfulness program (3 weeks total), participants will be instru cted 
to connect to the platform and accomplish daily exercises a minimum of [ADDRESS_76814] -Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ), will 
be administered to assess the usability of the mindfulness program. The adapted version of the 
PSSUQ consists of 5 questions on user’s perceived satisfaction of a website or software. Each 
question is scored on a 7 -point Likert scale ranging from Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree. In 
a semi -structured interview lasting up to 30 minutes, participants will also be ask ed to provide 
feedback about technical issues (e.g., whether the website is fully accessible), program content 
and their feelings, beliefs, reactions and adherence to the program. In particular, the clarity of 
the lectures and other exercise communications , the duration of the program and the 
perception of the utility of the exercises will be verified. The interview will be video recorded.  
 
Data analysis : See SAP   
 
Phase 3 – Modifications to obtain a final version  
Based on the feedback received by [CONTACT_70513], recommendations to modify the content of the 
videos or the exercises, or the website will be drafted. Based on those recommendations, 
modifications will be made to the online mindfulness program. If warranted, t he testing phase 
will be replicated with up to a second cohort of 10 participants (5 stroke patients and 5 
caregivers).   
 
Ethical considerations  
Informed consent  
Prior to providing informed consent, all  participants (stroke survivors and caregivers) will be 
fully informed of the procedures involved and requirements for participation in the study. 
Participants will also be informed of the voluntary nature of participation in the project and the 
option to withdraw at any time without jeopardy. At the fi rst online meeting , each participant 
will be asked to read the consent form at his or her own pace. A member of the research team 
will also explain every element of the consent form and answer any question or concern from 
the potential participant. Partici pants will be asked if they understand the nature of the study 
 8 and the procedures that will be employed. Then, participants will provide written consent on 
the REDCap platform should they agree to participate. A copy of the consent form will be 
printed, si gned by [CONTACT_458], scanned and return to each participant by [CONTACT_6968]. 
The HIPAA compliant Zoom platform will be used  for all meetings.  
 
Participant recruitment  
A webpage  was created using the Southern [LOCATION_004] Clinical and Translational S cience Institute 
(CTSI) Clinical studies directory . The link to this webpage will be shared on social medias using a 
recruitment flyer. Specifically, stroke survivors support group will be targeted  (e.g., Stroke 
Association of Southern [LOCATION_004], American  Heart Association Support Network) . Interested 
individuals will be encouraged to contact a member of the research team. A member of the 
research team will contact [CONTACT_70514], explain in more details 
the research project and answer questions. If difficulty arise with recruitment, participants will 
also be recruited by [CONTACT_70515] -approved database, Registry for Aging and 
Rehabilitation Evaluation -RARE (HS -11-[ZIP_CODE]). Phone recruitment will be done using a phone 
script.  
Participant privacy and data confidentiality  
All information collected during this study will be coded in order to assure confidentiality and 
each participant will be assigned a random unique identification code. Once transcribed and 
verifie d for accuracy, the recordings of the semi -structured interviews will be destroyed.  
Electronic data will be stored on a secured drive and access to the drive will be password 
protected. Data will be stored for a period of seven years following the end of t he study, after 
which, they will be destroyed. Only the members of the research team will have access to the 
data. The data identifier will be stored in a different location than the data generated during 
the study.  
Potential risks and procedures for mini mizing risks  
The risks associated with this study are minimal  and there are no expected adverse events . 
Risks include surveys or interview questions that may make participants feel uneasy or 
embarrassed, and a breach of confidentiality. During any self -reported or interview question, 
participants will be allowed to skip or stop answering any questions they wish not to. The 
HIPAA compliant REDCap platform will be used to obtain informed consent and collect all 
patient -reported outcomes  (coded surveys) . No id entifier will be collected  in REDCap. Study 
investigators will protect data against the privacy by [CONTACT_70516], in password 
protected computers and files, and by [CONTACT_70517].  If a participant scores over 11/21  
on the HADS sca le for depression and anxiety or if they experience any inconvenience  during 
the study , they will be directed  to their primary family physician to ensure they are receiving 
proper referral to mental health care . 
 
Plan to disseminate findings  
It is anticipated that the  results from this study will be disseminated in a peer -review 
publication  and at local , national  and/or international conferences. To facilitate the knowledge 
 9 translation for students doing stroke research, the results will be presente d at the 
Biok inesiology and Physical Therapy Division seminars at the University of Southern [LOCATION_004].

Structure of the mindfulness program  
 
• Attention to variability : The key concept is that world around us, and each one of us, is 
always changing.  If you are able to notice subtle changes in the external word, as well as in 
how you feel, you will find that negative feelings, whether psychological or physical, are not 
always present.  Thus, you can change the usual tendency to view t hings as if they are 
unchanging – a mindless construct of the world. Simple exercises can help to change this 
mindset.  Two simple examples are:  
 
o Try to find 5 ways in which the weather is different today than yesterday.  
o Move one of your fingers and notice  how it feels. Wait a minute and do it again. 
Think of 3 ways that it feels differently the second time.  
 
• Positive and negative events : The same event may be seen as either  positive or negative, 
depending on our perspective; that same event can be seen as both  positive and negative. If 
we change our point of view then our perception about what we were certain is a negative 
event can, from that different perspective, be viewed as positive. That is, we can reframe a 
negative perception of an event by [CONTACT_70518] g a simple question: “In what ways might this 
be good for me? Or “What about this situation could be seen as good?”  With the disability 
following a stroke, we can try to find a different perspective about the illness. We see that 
our experience of the ill ness is a reflection of the view we take rather than of the illness 
itself. This may seem counterintuitive at first, but we can find many individuals who are able 
to reframe their experiences of their own illnesses by [CONTACT_70519] (e.g., a focus on 
the important things they missed, whether it be family or philanthropy or art). This 
perspective shifting is a very mindful exercise and a very valuable copi[INVESTIGATOR_70507]. 
Examples of exercises could be:  
 
o You miss a bus to meet an important person in your life. Try to find [ADDRESS_76818] difficulty speaking or raising your arm or leg, think of 3 new positive 
opportunities that this diff iculty provides.  
 
• Unpredictability : a mindful view of the future acknowledges its ultimate unpredictability, as 
is the course of the participant’s disability. Such unpredictability opens up the possibilities 
for a more positive perception of the future th an had been conceived. For example:  
 
o Find [ADDRESS_76819] in 
which it is both positive and negative.  
 
• Sense Making : Disability and symptoms tend to be perceived as something that stays 
unchanging. However, it is unlikely that all symptoms are always present at the same 
 13 intensity or at the same level of impairment. Reflecting about symptoms and your ability to 
do thing s that are important to you allows for understanding their variability, and making 
sense of this can help develop an understanding that there are often many reasons for their 
variability. Once we can identify even a few reasons, feelings of increased contr ol and 
awareness follow. One example of this is:  
 
o Is today a better day than yesterday?  What about compared to last week?  In what 
ways is it better or worse?  Can you think of 3 reasons why?  
 
• Novelty seeking and novelty producing : The attitude of paying attention to new elements 
requires an open and curious orientation toward the world and towards oneself. Novelty 
producing actively creates new categories of thinking rather than relying on previously 
constructed categories and distinctions about the world  (Langer, 1989). Novelty seeking is 
also related to the concept of flexibility, or using feedback from the environment to make 
any responsive adaptations to one’s thinking and behavior. These attitudes may be 
improved in an effort to be more mindful.  Exam ples of exercises with this purpose may be:  
 
o Imagine taking a new route to get from your house to any places to which you go 
very regularly. What new reactions occur to you?  
o What are five ways you could change your bathroom – even slightly - in order for i t 
to make it easier for you to get in and out of the shower?

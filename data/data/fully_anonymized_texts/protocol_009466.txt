2.0 OVERALL OBJECTIVES  
 
The study will evaluate the outcome of nasal obstruction treated with the Vivaer  Stylus, and also 
attempt to use computational aerodynamics simulation and sensory measurement s to identify 
and predict patients’ treatment outcome. The ability to envisage variables  that will lead to best 
outcome may have potential to  assist patients and clinicians in pla nning effective, well -informed, 
personalized treatment/surgery strategi es. 
 
2.1 Primary outcome variables  
 
The primary symptom outcome variables include self -reported Nasal Obstruction Symptoms  
Evaluation (NOSE)  score  and VAS of nasal obstruction.  
 
The primary independent objective variables include several categories: 1)  variables that 
index general dise ase severity (Computerized Tomography (CT)  staging and endoscopic 
examination score), 2) peak inspi[INVESTIGATOR_147337].

3.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
 
The nasal valve area (V) represents the narrowest segment of the nasal airway. It is defined as 
the area bounded by [CONTACT_147350] (ULC), cartilaginous nasal 
septum (S) and head of the inferior turbinate (T) (Fig ure 1). The nasal valve angle is the angle 
between the upper lateral cartilage and the nasal septum.  Anatomical studies have shown that 
this angle classically ranges between 10° and 15° in the nose of Caucasian i ndividuals. The nasal 
valve is a critical site for nasal resistance and for nasal obstruction symptom s. One of the most 
common causes of nasal obstruction is internal nasal valve dysfunction wherein the upper lateral 
cartilage moves towards the septum, increasing airway  resistance and leading to nasal 
obstruction .  
 
Figure 1. Nasal Anatomy  
                                              (from Weaver [ZIP_CODE], Figure 1)  
 
Airway remodeling in the nasal valve region may have significant benefit for patients with a narrow 
nasal valve.  Over -the-counter remedies such as external breathing strips can provide patients 
with temporary  relief. However , a long-term solution to chron ic nasal airway obstruction 
associated with the nasal valve usually involves extensive surgery . One of the common  surgical 
procedures targeting the nasal valve is the implantation of alar batten grafts; i.e., curved cartilage 
supports placed into areas of the nasal valve area to enlarge and strengthen it. Although batten 
graft surgical outcomes are generally successful , the procedure requires the harvesting of a 
cartilage graft from another anatomic site, a difficult and time -consuming procedure.  Overall, 
current surgical therapy on the nasal valve is efficacious, but is invasive and associated with long 
recovery periods  and the risk of complications, e.g. , hemorrhage.  
 
The use of radiofrequency energy has been common  for decades in the fields of otolaryngology , 
neurosurgery, cardiology, urology and general surgery.   For instance , radiofrequency turbinate 
reduction (RFTR) uses radiofrequency to create heat within the submucosal tissue of the turbinate, 
reducing tissue volume with minimal impact on surrounding tissues . Numerous studies have 
demonstrated that radiofrequency therapy in the nasal passage can be safe and effective in 
improving nasal obstruction and in preserving nasal function.2,3  
 
The Aerin Medical Vivaer  System an investigational device that is capable of delivering bipolar 
radiofrequency energy to improve nasal breathing by [CONTACT_147351]. 
The System is comprised of the Vivaer Stylus (Figure 2), a disposable handheld device capable 
of delivering bipolar radiofrequency energy to tissue , and a radiofrequency generator  (Figure 3) . 
  

Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Vivaer Stylus  
 
 
The Vivaer  Stylus consists of a handle, shaft and treatment tip. An array of bipolar electrodes is 
positioned on a non -conductive tip which is attached to the handle via a non -conductive shaft. A 
temperature sensor (thermocouple) is located on the tip to monitor tis sue temperature. The Stylus 
is attached to a temperature -controlled radiofrequency generator via a flexible cable. The Vivaer 
Stylus modifies the soft tissues of the nasal valve through the use of low doses of radiofrequency 
energy. The low -power radiofreq uency generates heat within the submucosal tissue, creating a 
coagulation lesion. As the lesion heals, the tissue retracts and stiffens , slightly widening the nasal 
valve area . This decreases the nasal airflow resistance thereby [CONTACT_147352] (as demonstrated in earlier pre -clinical and pi[INVESTIGATOR_7602]). The procedure  requires local 
anesthesia only, and is much less invasive than current surgical approaches.  
 
This clinical study plans to use computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) and various sensory testing 
techniques to examine the factors contributing  to patients’ outcome after Aerin treatment . The 
efficacy and safety of the Vivaer Stylus treatment will be recorded.

department’s website / Facebook page.  
 
4.6 Measurement / Instrumentation  
 
Endoscopic Examination  
Patients will receive endoscopic examination as part of their standard clinical care. The 
severity of disease will be scored based on endoscopic examination  (Lund -Kennedy 
endoscopic scores) .   
 
Study Procedures  
Each visit is expected to last 2 -3 hours and may include the following procedures . (These 
procedures are routinely performed for research purpose s; however, none of them should be 
considered standard clinical care. The differences will be explained to the participants during 
the consent process.)  
 
Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
1.  All participants will be asked to fill out a medical history questionnaire , as well as the 
Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT -22) questionnaire , the NOSE score and the Visual 
Analog Scale for nasal obstruction.  The SNOT -22 and NOSE  are two commonly used 
validated outcome questionnaires to evaluate change in rhinosinusitis  and/or nasal 
obstruction symptoms in patients. The VAS is a self -rating of nasal obstruction on a 
linear scale (range 0-10; 0 being completely clear and 10 being completely blocked) 
using both nostrils and then with the left and right nostril separately.  
 
2. Peak nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] : A mask attached to a spi[INVESTIGATOR_147339]´s face without touc hing the nose. The subject is instructed to inhale as strong ly 
as possible, and the peak flow rate is then recorded. The test will be repeated three 
(3) times and the results averaged. For unilateral recording, one nostril is blocked with 
a tape, so that the subject can only inhale through the other nostril.  
 
3.  Research CT scans : The subject may receive a CT scan for non -clinical purpose s with 
a cone beam office CT scanner ( 3D Accuitomo 170, J. Morita [LOCATION_003], Inc.)  at the 
Department of Otolaryngology at The Ohio State University School of Medicine. This 
scan has a radiation dosage of roughly 12% that of a conventional head CT scan with 
a significantly lower associated health ris k, while retaining excellent air -mucus contrast 
for CFD modeling. The recruitment strategy will reduce the need for research CTs and 
unne cessary radiation by [CONTACT_147353] a sinus CT 
clinically, which will serve as the subjec t’s baseline CT. Furthermore, if a post -
treatment/surgery CT scan is clinically necessary for a patient after enrollment, it will 
be schedule d for the subject’s second study visit. Through these measures, the need 
for research CT  scans  will be reduced to limit the number of research CT scan s for all 
patients to one ( 1). 
 
4. CFD Modeling : 3D numerical nasal models that are suitable for numerical simulation 
of nasal airflow and odorant transport will be constructed based on each 
subject/patient ’s CT scan and according to the method described by [CONTACT_147354]8. In brief, 
first the interface between the nasal mucosa and the air is delineated (using AMIRA ) 
on the CT scans. Then, the nasal cavity air space is filled with tetrahedral elements 
(ICEMCFD ). A finer mesh (prism layer) is created near the mucosal surface to more 
accurately model the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_147340] -wall air velocity and odorant concentration. 
Next, inspi[INVESTIGATOR_147341] -steady laminar nasal airflow8,9 is simulated 
(Fluent©, Ansys Inc, [LOCATION_003]) by [CONTACT_2931] a physiologically realistic pressure drop 
between the nostrils and the nasal pharynx. By [CONTACT_147355], the total nasal resistance  can 
be determined , a numerical method of rhinomanometry. Through simulation, the 
following variables  will be obtained : numerical nasal resistance, nasal mucosal cooling 
rate, and nasal airflow distribution patterns . 
 
5. Adverse Event Evaluation  – Subjects will be asked abou t possible side effects or 
adverse experiences related to the study procedure. All events will be documented on 
the proper Adverse Event Log and Adverse Event Case Report Form.  Anticipated 
observations related to the study procedure will be tabulated, but  will not be 
categorized as adverse events unless they require mitigation by [CONTACT_147356], duration or degree of incidence than anticipated.  Refer to 
Table 2 for a listing of anticipated observations as well as anticip ated frequency, 
severity and duration.  
Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
 
7. Medications  – Updates to current medications or any new or changed medications will 
be requested at each follow -up visit.  The medication log will be updated to reflect any 
changes.  In addition, any medications r equired as a result of intervention related to 
the study procedure will be documented and will correlate with the Adverse Event 
Case Report Form.  
    
8. General Health Survey  Subject will be asked to complete t he SF -[ADDRESS_168579] widely used generic measures of health -
related quality of life and has been shown to discriminate between subjects with 
different chronic conditions and between subjects with different severity level s of the 
same disease. The SF -36 has also demonstrated sensitivity to significant treatment 
effects in a variety of patient populations.   
 
 
4.7 Study Phases  
The study will be conducted in three phases as subjects are consented and evaluated for 
eligibility, tr eated and followed until study exit:  
 
Phase 1 - Pre-Admission Evaluation/Patient Consent  
Phase 2  – Baseline /Treatment  
Phase 3  – Follow -Up 90 Day s (+/- 15 days ) Post -Procedure / Study Exit  
 
The assessments to be performed during each phase are listed in Table 1.  
 
Pre-Admission Evaluation/Patient Consent  
Patients presenting with symptoms associated with nasal airway obstruction will be 
approached with the study and asked if they are willing to volunteer participation.  Patients 
will initially be asked abou t duration of symptoms and conservative measures used for their 
condition.  Any known concomitant nasal conditions and past nasal surgeries will be discussed 
to understand if they are potential candidates for the study.

Informed Consent  
Informed consent will be obtained as outlined in 21 CFR Part 50 and the Good Clinical 
Practice: Consolidated Guidance (ICH, April 1996).  
 
A research study member at the approved study site will speak with the study candidate about 
the purpose of the study  and investigational research.  Explanation of the study back ground, 
study procedure, follow -up visit schedule, and study procedure risks and benefits will be 
Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
reviewed in detail with the patient.  Patients will be given the time they need to read through 
the study information and informed consent document and to ask as many questions as 
necessary to make them comfortable with the study and the requirements.  A patient  willing 
to participate after undergoing the informed consent process will then be asked to  sign the 
consent form  and given a copy .  The original will be kept on file.  
 
For those potential candidates who agree to participate in the study by [CONTACT_147357] (ICF), a baseline evaluation will be conducted.  Subjects 
will be considered enrolled once they arrive at the study clinic to undergo the procedure.  At 
this time a subject identification number will be assigned along with the subject binder.  
 
During the baseline and follow -up visits, the procedures listed below will occur   
1. Endoscopic examination (video and pi[INVESTIGATOR_499]), Lund -Kennedy endoscopic scores  
2. Peak nasal inspi[INVESTIGATOR_10229]  
3. Cone beam CT scan (clinical CT at baseline ; clinical or research CT at 90 -day follow -
up visit )  
4. Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) scale  
5. Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT -22) 
6. Visual analogue scale (VAS) rating severity of nasal obstruction  
7. Computational modeling of nasal airflow based on CT scan of each visit.  
 
During the baseline visit, data collection  will be performed first, and then the Aerin Vivaer  
Treatment will be provided in the clinic  by [CONTACT_099]. The styluses used in this st udy will 
be manufactured and supplied by [CONTACT_456] .  
 
During the treatment, 0.5 ml of local anesthesia  (lidocaine 1% with epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] 1:100,000) 
will be injected into the target tissue . The Vi vaer stylus will be inserted into the nose and the 
electrode -containing tip will be positioned against the target tissue.  
 
Subjects will have both nasal valves treated in a single study procedure session.  Each nostril 
will be treated at up to 3 non -overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_147342].  
 
Treatment settings to be used are:  
Temperature  ............... 60C 
Power  ....................  [ADDRESS_168580] with the target tissue.  
 
No repeat ("touch -up") procedures will be permitted during the [ADDRESS_168581] -Procedure Care (prior to leaving the clinic)  
At the discretion of the physician, the following care and instructions may be provided:  
• Apply petroleum jelly to the treatment area as needed.   
Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
• The patient should be instructed not to manipulate th e treatment site for 24 hours with 
the exception of any necessary hemostasis .     
 
Study subjects will be reminded of their next follow -up visit and will be scheduled within the 
study window  (90  15 days) .   
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment phase or during the follow -up phase.  
Adverse events occurring during the baseline assessment will be documented in the subject’s 
medical record but will not count as related to the device or procedure.  Each adverse event 
will be recorded and judged by [CONTACT_147358]/or procedure.  In addition, the Investigator will identify the date of onset, 
severity and duration.  All adverse events wi ll be monitored until they are adequately resolved 
or explained.

emphasize to all potential subjects/patients that whether or not they agree to participate will 
not have any impact on their continuing treatment and interactions at the Department of 
Otolaryngology, The Ohio State University School of Me dicine.  
 
4.9 Data Analysis  
 
Treatment effectiveness  
Outcome variables: patient’s ratings of nasal obstruction via a VAS and NOSE score  as well 
as the SNOT -[ADDRESS_168583]-treatment vs. baseline measurements and determine 
the effectiveness of the treatment.  
  
Hypothesis:   
Nasal valve region airflow and airflow induced cooling is critical for patients’ subjective nasal 
patency.  
 
Many publications suggest that sensory feedback is as important to perception of nasal 
obstruction as nasal resistance.  For example: Topi[INVESTIGATOR_147343]10. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_147344], presumably due to blocking of the trigeminal afferents11.  
 
The Ohio State University (OSU) staff  have published a series of studies6,12,[ADDRESS_168584]’s ratings (excellent, normal and moderately obstructed) with 89.3% 
success. It is likely that nasal valve width and shape may have an optimal range in order to 
achieve both low nasal resistance and high regional muc osal cooling  (see Fig. 5). This study 
will examine a broad list  of factors that may contribute to patients’ subjective outcomes, not 
just limited to nasal resistance alone, that include CFD simulation of nasal airflow, mucosa 
cooling and mucosa sensitivity  responding to that cooling.

b) low nasal cooling with moderate ratings of nasal obstruction  
 
Spearmen correlation and multiple regression will be used to  screen for independent 
variables that significantly correlate with dependent variables, as well as potential non -linear 
relationship s between the variables. Other potential confounding factors (e.g., age, duration 
of the disease, smoking history) will also be examined. The Holm  Bonferroni correction will 
be applied to control for multiple comparisons. Finally, statistical learning metho ds such as 
linear discrimination analysis (LDA) and logistic regression  will be applied  for classification 
and discrimination of patient symptom categories (e.g., symptom -free, moderate and severe 
nasal obstruction) based on significant independent variabl es.  
 
 
5.[ADDRESS_168585] REIMBURSEMEN T 
Subjects may be reimbursed for their time and travel and any expenses associated with each 
study visit, as allowed by [CONTACT_138546].  Subjects will not be reimbursed for those scheduled 
study visits that they do not attend.   
 
 
6.0 STUDY WITHDRAWAL  
Subje cts may be terminated or withdrawn from the study for the following reasons:  
• Voluntary withdrawal – the subject voluntarily chooses not to further participate in the 
study  
• *Lost to follow -up – the subject is more than one month late (beyond the late visit window) 
to a study visit and [ADDRESS_168586] to follow -up. 
• *In the physician’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], it is not in the bes t interest of the subject to continue study 
participation.  
• Subject death.   
 
*Where possible, subjects will be followed for safety to study completion.  Safety follow -up will 
include a review of adverse events (AEs).  A safety follow -up assessment may be p erformed 
either via a phone or email contact [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a physician visit.   
 
Any study subject who does not attend the scheduled follow -up visit should be contact[CONTACT_147359].  The reason for the missed visit 
should be determined and documented in the subject’s study records.  All subjects enrolled 

Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
(including those  withdrawn or lost to follow -up) shall be accounted for with appropriate 
documentation.  
 
 
7.0 ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse events (AEs) may occur during the treatment phase or during the follow -up phase.  
Adverse events occurring after the baseline assessment but before the treatment procedure will 
be documented in the subject’s medical record but will not count as rel ated to the investigational 
device or procedure.   
Each adverse event will be recorded in the corresponding subject’s CRF.  The Investigator will 
make a judgement as to its relationship and level of relatedness to the study  device and/or study  
procedure.  In addition, the Investigator will identify the date of onset, severity and duration of the 
AE.  All adverse events will be monitored until they are adequately resolved or explained.  If a 
subject reaches the 90-day follow -up visit and is experiencing a ne w or ongoing adverse event, 
the study sponsor should be contact[CONTACT_138544]/or methods for continued 
surveillance of the event.  
The Investigator must submit to the Sponsor a report of any Serious Adverse Event (SAE), 
Serious Adverse Device Ef fect (SADE) or Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) within [ADDRESS_168587]:   Scott Wolf, MD  
Telephone:    (650) 605 -3579  
Facsimile:      (650) 605 -3579  
Email:   [EMAIL_2873]  
 
 
In addition, the Investig ator will report adverse events to the reviewing IRB (as applicable)  
according to the local reporting requirements.  
 
 
8.0 RISK – BENEFIT ASSES SMENT  
8.1 Potential Risks  
Potential risks associated with the use of the Vivaer  System do not differ from those of the 
commonly used devices and procedures to treat nasal obstruction discussed previously, but 
due to the non -surgical nature of the therapy, small treatment area, low -power delivery and 
lack of need for general anesthesia, the overall risk to the patient may be less than from 
other procedures such as RF turbinoplasty, septoplasty and/or functional rhinoplasty.   
 
Potential risks associated with the use of the Vivaer  System and/or the associated local 
anesthetics are outlined below.  Subjects will be monitored closely as part of this study to 
allow for detection of symptoms, should they be present.  This, in turn, should allow for early 
treatment or intervention, if n ecessary.  
 
While there were no reports of these events in the previous feasibility study of this system, 
the following are adverse events or side effects that may occur as a result of the treatment:  
• Infection  
Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
• Bleeding (other than intra -treatment at treat ment sites and greater than anticipated 
by [CONTACT_093])  
• Mucosal changes  
• Scar formation leading to nasal obstruction  
• Sensory changes at treatment site  
• Vasovagal response secondary to the procedur e 
 
Table [ADDRESS_168588] of anticipated observations that are expected in and around the 
treatment area.  For reference, the incidence (reported as percentage of treated nostrils) 
observed in the previous feasibility study is also provided.  These observations will be 
assessed and recorded at st udy visits if they occur but, being anticipated as a result of the 
procedure, will not be considered adverse events unless they require mitigation by [CONTACT_147360], duration or degree of incidence than anticipated.  
If one of these types of observations is deemed to be an adverse event, it should be 
recorded on the study Adverse Event CRF.

8.2 Potential Benefit  
Potential benefit, associated with the use of the Vivaer System, is to offer a safe, minimally 
invasive treatment method to improve nasal breathing.  Improved nasal breathing may have 
a positive effect on quality of life and health.   
 
Aerin Medical Inc.   TP423  
8.3 Minimization of Anticipated Risks  
Risks associated with the Vivaer  System are minimized by [CONTACT_8345].  In addition, risks will 
be minimized through the use of an Investigator with a high degree of experience in nasal 
surgical and minimally invasive procedure s.  The Investigator will receive sponsor -led 
training in proper use of the device, prior to study initiation and as warranted throughout the 
study.  The sponsor will monitor the study for any trends that would indicate a safety issue.   
8.4 Potential Risks to  Patient Confidentiality  
In all clinical studies, confidentiality of protected health information may be breached due to 
study -related activities beyond those of routine clinical care.  This risk will be minimized by 
[CONTACT_147361] (CRFs) or other 
study -related documentation to be provided to the study sponsor.

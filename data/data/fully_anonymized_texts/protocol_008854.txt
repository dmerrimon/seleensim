 1.0 INTRODUCTION  
This document is a protocol for a human research study.  This study will be carried out in 
accordance with the applicable [LOCATION_002] government regulations and Mayo Clinic research 
policies and procedures.  This study will be coordinated at up to four additional sites in addition 
to Mayo Clinic [COMPANY_002]ster.  
 
1.1 IgA Nephropathy  Background : 
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is an immune -complex mediated glomerulonephritis 
characterized by [CONTACT_646062].[ADDRESS_865139] ion to development of endstage renal disease (ESRD) in up to 
50% of the cases.
8 Markers of poor prognosis include impaired kidney function at presentation, 
hypertension and persistent proteinuria > 1 g/24h.9,[ADDRESS_865140] (mesangial hypercellularity, endocapi[INVESTIGATOR_567464], 
segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy/ interstitial fibrosis) as an independent indicator 
of poor renal outcome.[ADDRESS_865141] effective therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646044] (ACE -I), corticosteroids, and omega- 3 
fish oil supplements that contain a high concentration of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA). Other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_646045]. 
12-18 In some patients renal disease 
progresses despi[INVESTIGATOR_646046] a search for additional f orms of therapy is ongoing.  
      
While  glucocorticoids and alkylating ag ents can successfully treat IgAN and other forms of 
primary glomerulonephritis, prolonged treatment with these agents is associated with significant clinical toxicities. Glucocorticoids are associated with steroid -induced diabetes, 
avascular necrosis of th e hips and shoulders, excessive weight gain, osteoporosis, and increased 
risk for infectious complications.
19-21 Cyclophosphamide has been used in combination with 
corticosteroids in  the treatment of  patients with IgA N with high- risk features .15 While alkylating 
agents allows clinicians to reduce the amount and duration of steroid therapy, only 20 -40% of 
patients achieve a complete or partial response. Moreover, repeated use of cyclophosphamide 
ACTH in the Treatment of Progressive IgA Nephropathy  
  Page 6/25 
 and other alkylating agents is associated significant  toxicity including premature ovarian failure 
and increased incidence of secondary malignancies.22-25      
 
1.2 ACTH Background : 
H.P. Acthar® Gel (ACTH) is obtained from processing of the porcine pi[INVESTIGATOR_646047]. The active 
ingredients in H.P. Acthar® Gel  are part of the family of structurally related peptides known as 
melanocortin peptides. Melanocortin peptides, which include adrenocorticotrophic hormone 
(ACTH) and the α -, β-, and γ -melanocyte stimulating hormones, are derived from the natural 
protein pro -opi[INVESTIGATOR_356092] (POMC) and bind to the cell surface G -protein co upled receptors 
known as melanocortin receptors (MCRs).26,[ADDRESS_865142] been cloned, each 
with different tissue distributions, affinities, and physiological roles. Although the functional 
roles of all the peptides in H.P. Acthar® Gel have not been fully elucidated, ACTH is known to 
have activity at all [ADDRESS_865143] immunomodulatory properties facilitated through interactions 
with melanocortin receptors found in immune effector cells and other tissues.  MCRs are  
expressed in glomerular podocytes and receptor stimulation has been demonstrated to reduce 
oxidative stress and improve glomerular morphology by [CONTACT_646063], injury 
and loss in the remnant kidney animal model.28 Inhibition of nuclear factor -kB (NF -kB) signaling  
is a key anti- inflammatory mechanism of melanocortin  peptides.[ADDRESS_865144] in healthy individuals,31 in steroid -treated 
patients with renal disease32 and in hemodialysis patients33, using a similar synthetic ACTH 
preparation that is not available in North America.  More recently, using H.P. Acthar® Gel 
(ACTH) we were able to demonstrate a significant benefit in patient with Membranous 
Nephropathy.34  Twenty patients received a subcutaneous dose of 40 or 80 IU twice weekly. 
Baseline characteristics included mean proteinuria (9.1±3.4 g/day), albumin (2.7±0.8 g/dL), 
estimate d glomerular filtration rate (77±30 ml/min) along with elevated total and LDL 
cholesterol. By 12 months of follow -up, there was a significant improvement in proteinuria in 
the entire cohort, decreasing to 3.87±4.24 g/day (p<0.001) with significant improvements in serum albumin, total and LDL cholesterol. A > 50% decrease in proteinuria was noted in 65% of  
the patients with a trend towards better outcomes among patients who received greater cumulative doses. No significant adverse effects were documented.  
ACTH in the Treatment of Progressive IgA Nephropathy  
  Page 7/25 
  
Similarly, a recent pi[INVESTIGATOR_646048]® Gel (ACTH) in the treatment of 
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) .35 Ten females (mean age = 49 y ear, disease duration = 7 
years, with SLE were treated with ACTH Gel 80 U for 7 -15 days and were assessed weekly for 28 
days. Outcome measures included Physician and Patient Global Assessments, SLEDAI -2 K, Lupus 
Quality of Life scale, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue (FACIT -Fatigue) 
scale, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C -reactive protein. Student' s t-test compared data 
obtained at days 7, 14, and 28 with those from baseline.  The primary endpoint of SLEDAI -2 K 
improvement was reached at all observation times (p < 0.05) and statistically significant 
improvements were observed for most other parameters. No treatment -related serious or 
unexpected adverse events were observed.  
 
These results suggest that ACTH G el may provide a novel anti -inflammatory and 
immunomodulatory  treatment option with possible mechanisms of  action beyond 
steroidogenesis.  Considering that IgA nephropathy is an inflammatory glomerular disease , we 
hypothesized that adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) therapy in the form of HP Acthar ®gel 
may reduc e glomerular  inflammation , improv e podocyte survival and  may prov ide an effective 
therapy in patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria.  
 
1.2.1 Safety Profile  
The Acthar Prescribing Information recommend s the use of 40 to 80 U administered 
intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 24 to 72 hours in adults and children ov er 2 years of 
age; with the specific dosage individualized according to medical condition.  Recent published 
use of Acthar in subjects with non- diabetic nephrotic syndrome included regimens of 80U 2 
times per week and 40U 2 to 3 times per week for 6 to 14 months. Bomback et al demonstrated 
promising efficacy results with the 6 month regimen of 80 U 2 times a week; the results were 
less impressive with a 6  month regimen of 40U 2 to 3 times per week.36 Tumlin and colleagues 
reported promising results in an Investigator -initiated clinical trial of Acthar in subjects with 
diabetic nephropat hy, which included Acthar regimens of 16U and 32U per day for  6 months, 
the original design for this present protocol planned to assess two Acthar regimens (40U 5 
times per week for 24 weeks and 80U 2 times a week for 24 weeks) in treatment -resistant iMN 
patients.[ADDRESS_865145] an acceptable risk/benefit ratio in this population.  
 
The Acthar regimen will be administered as the solely immunosuppressive therapy .  The d osing 
will begin and end with Acthar 80U 2 times per week and will continue through Week 24  (6 
months) . The 24 week regimen with a 24 -week follow up was selected based on additional  
controlled studies in which subjects with nephrotic syndrome treated with modified release 
synthetic fragment ACTH(1 -24).34,36-38  Data from these stud ies show that a 6 month regimen 
demo nstrated remission (partial or complete) af ter 6 months of dosing that was sustained after 
6 months of follow -up.

 1.3 Hypothesis and Rational for Study Design  
Hypotheses : In patients with progressive IgA nephropathy , ACTH gel injection at a dose of 80 
units subcutaneously twice weekly for 6 months  is effective in inducing improvement in 
proteinuria and renal function.

also means that the primary site (Mayo Clinic) will only be paying for the optional studies  (if the patient i s enrolled) and the 24 hour 
urine sample, which will be shipped.   
B. Each visit the following will be shipped to the Mayo Clinic : 24hour Urines - Creatinine Clearance and Volume measurements,  and 
optional research bloods for DNA and biomarker study.  All others including the Urinalysis and panels will be performed at local 
sites.  
C. Optional Research labs (including biomarkers in both urine and blood) will be from one10 ml red top tube which  the s erum  will be 
drawn and divided equally  into five 1 mL cryovials to be frozen and stored.  50 mL of urine will be drawn from a random urinalysis  
collection and then will be  processed and  aliquoted to be frozen and stored.  Two 10 ml EDTA tubes will be used for DNA extraction, 
and will be processed into 2 aliquots of white blood cells (buffy coat) and stored for future DNA extraction.    
D. The urine p regnancy test will be completed at screening, and baseline.  If the subject leaves the study early-  an additional pregnancy 
test will be requested as a safety assessment.  
E. The drug will be administrated by [CONTACT_646066] a training lesson for the patients.  The patient s are allowed to have a 
significant other take part in the lesson if the patient is unwilling or unable to administer the injection themselves.  
F. Please note the patients will be requested to wait with the training staff for 30minutes after the drug is administered-  i.e. a safety 
observation period.  
G. If the patient has had a HIV, Hep B & C test in the last two years - this will count towards the study.

  Page 14/[ADDRESS_865149]/identification number will consist of the patient’s initials (First Middle and Last) 
along with the medication kit number.  This number w ill be used to identify the subject 
throughout the study and will be entered on all study documents.  
 
The study number will not be assigned to more than one individual.  If a subject was not given a medication number , due to being excluded before a number had been assigned, the patient 
would be considered excluded with no issues in regards to number assignment .  However if the 
subject was later deemed in eligible to receive the treatment or needed to discontinue from the 
study, the subject would have been as signed a medication number and therefore once they 
discontinue on the study - that number cannot be used by [CONTACT_646067].   
 
4.5 Optional Research Lab (Biomarkers)  
4.5.1 Collection and Banking of Blood and urine for future testing at Mayo:  
There has been a common antibody found in patients with vasculitis (ANCA) and in some patients with the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy  (anti -PLA2R) , which are example of 
diseases affecting the kidney.   In the future similar antibodies may be found for in patients with

 4.5.2 Optional DNA Testing  
Recent data show that in a number of glomerular disease (e.g. membranous nephropathy) mutations in HLA alleles are associated wit h an increased risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_114928].
39 The 
same has been proposed for IgA nephropathy.40  Thus we would like to evaluate potential 
genetic mutations in this group of patients.   We will ask for the patients consent to further 
evaluate this linkage by [CONTACT_628134] (ICF).   The DNA sample would be taken at Baseline, but shipped 
with the additional biomarkers listed above.  
• Two 10 ml EDTA  tubes will be used for DNA extraction, and will be processed into 2 
aliquots of white blood cells (buffy coat) and stored for future DNA extraction.  
 [IP_ADDRESS] Quantitative gene expression analysis  
Quantitative gene expression analysis using real -time PCR a nd Microarray technology in 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells:   There is little information on global gene expression 
changes that occur during active nephrotic syndrome secondary to IgA nephropathy subsequent to remission of this disease.   Furthermore, t here is no information on how 
ACTH  affects gene expression of potentially pathogenic genes.   As part of this study, peripheral 
blood will be collected at Time 0, and 12 months after therapy.   Following treatment with 
ACTH, B -cell-specific genes will be as sessed to track the extent of treatment in the B -cell pool 
gene expression.   Both quantitative TaqMan real- time polymerase chain reaction and gene 
microarray (Affymetrix U133 chips) will be used to evaluate gene expression profiles.   Real -time 
PCR will be used only to confirm the findings of the gene chip for genes with statistical 
significance.  
 
 4.6 Optional Biopsy Review  
4.6.1 Histopathology  
Due to the expertise of the pathologists at each of the clinical centers and to the characteristic findings on the  renal biopsy in IgA nephropathy a review of the biopsy slides will not be 
required prior to en rollment at a Central Pathology Laboratory.   However, a report 
documenting the results of the histology review including, light microscopy, immunofluorescence an d electron microscopy results, as well as percentage of global and 
segmental glomerular sclerosis, tubulo -interstitial index, and immunofluorescence findings will 
be submitted and reviewed by [CONTACT_1758] P.I prior to enrollment into the study.

 7.0 Safety Assessments  
7.1 Specification of Variables and Procedures  
Safety outcomes will be assessed by [CONTACT_3148] -emergent adverse events; physical 
examinations; laboratory measurements including 24 -hour urine collections, glycemic status 
(HbA
1c), hematology, chemistry (include s serum glucose) and urinalysis , blood pressure 
(seated), and heart rate.  
The following will also be completed as per the Schedule of Procedures  
• A complete medical history;  
• A complete physical examination will be performed at certain visits and a limited 
physical examination will be performed at certain visits. The limited physical 
examination will consist of measurement of weight; evaluation of  lungs, heart, 
abdomen, and extremities  
• Vital signs (including heart rate and blood pressure); serum chemistry, Creatinin e 
clearance  (from 24 -hour urine), hematology, and urinalysis;  
• A urine pregnancy test will be completed at certain visits for women of childbearing 
potential;  
• Glycemic status (HbA 1c) will be assessed;  
ACTH in the Treatment of Progressive IgA Nephropathy  
  Page 18/25 
 •    Adverse events will be recorded and assessed.   
7.2 Report ing of Adverse Events  
7.2.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events: definitions, and guidance for reporting:  
• An adverse event  (AE)  is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient participating in an 
investigational trial or protocol regardless of causality assessment.  An adverse event can be 
an unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, synd rome or disease associated with or occurring during the use of an investigational 
product whether or not considered related to the investigational product.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Causality Assessment:  
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study medicatio n is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions:  
No: 
Not Related  - Onset of the event as relative to administration of the product is not 
reasonable; or, another cause itself can explain the occurrence of the AE between the administration of stu dy medication and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is 
consistent with a causal relationship and no other cause (concomitant medications, therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], complications, etc.) can be identified of the event.  
Unlikely to be related -  Onset of the event as relative to administration of the product 
is possible but another cause itself can explain the occurrence of the event or there are no reasonable grounds for suspecting that the product could have caused the event.  
Yes:  
Possibly related  - Onset of the event as relative to administration of the product is 
reasonable; however the event could have been due to another equally likely cause  
Probably related  - Onset of the event as relative to administration of the product is 
reasonable and is more likely explained by [CONTACT_646075].  
Definitely related  - Onset of the event as relative to administration of the product is 
reasonable and there is no other cause to explain the event; or a rechallenge (if feasible) is positive.  
 
• Serious adverse events  (SAE)  are adverse events occurring at any dose which meet one or 
more of the following serious criteria : 
 Results in death  (i.e. the AE caused or lead to death)  
 Is life-threatening  (i.e. the AE placed the patient at immediate risk of death; it does 
not apply to an AE which hypothetically might have caused the death if it were more 
severe)  
 Requires or prolongs inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (i.e. the AE required at least a 24 -hour 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_57891] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_646055]; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_86588]/surgical procedures, scheduled treatments, or routine check -ups are not SAEs by [CONTACT_44134])  
 Is disabling  (i.e. the AE resulted in a substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to  
carry out normal life functions)  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of 
a patient exposed to the trial drug prior to conception or during pregnancy)  
ACTH in the Treatment of Progressive IgA Nephropathy  
  Page 19/25 
  It does not meet any of the above serious criteria but may jeopardize the patient  
and may require medical or surgical intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above  
 
Expected  adverse events are those adverse events that are listed  or characterized in the 
Package Insert or current Investigator Brochure.  
  
Unexpected  adverse events are those not listed in the Package Insert (P.I.) or current 
Investigator Brochure (I.B.) or not identified.  This includes adverse events for which the 
specificity or severity is not consistent with the description in the P.I. or I.B.  For example, under 
this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the P.I. or I.B. only referred to elevated 
hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Reporting SAE:  
If considered a UPI[INVESTIGATOR_646056] (a Serious Adverse Events that is possibly due to the study medication) 
should be reported to the reviewing Institutional Review Board (IRB) according to individual requirements. A copy of that report must be retained at the investigative site and filed in the Investigator Site File.  
 The Investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided, or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment), or the subject dies. Within [ADDRESS_865157] update the 
SAE form and submit any supporting documentation, (e.g., laboratory test reports, patient 
discharge summary, or autopsy reports), to the [CONTACT_646081] M.D, Ph.D via email or fax.

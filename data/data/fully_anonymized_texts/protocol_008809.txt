B. Operational Guidance from Protocol CM # 1, dated [ADDRESS_1237654] the Protocol Team ([EMAIL_16818]) with any questions 
or concerns regarding this CM or manage ment of study participants.  
 
Visit Scheduling  
• Sites should utilize the allowable visit windows currently specified in the protocol V4.[ADDRESS_1237655] dose of study drug and at 
Week 96. Si tes should consider current or anticipated operational disruptions or closures when 
scheduling visits and should schedule visits early or late in the allowable window, as appropriate. 
Visits conducted outside of the allowable window would also be preferred  to completely missed 
visits.  
• Effective with the issuance of this CM, for Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237656] dose of study drug and prior to Week 96 (i.e., visits at Week 36, Week 
48, Week 60, Week 72, and  Week 84 for all Dose Group 5 Cohort 1 participants) are broadened to ±6 
weeks. The current V4.0 protocol -specified visit windows remain the target for these visits, and sites 
are encouraged to continue scheduling within these target windows whenever possi ble. 
Letter of Amendment # [ADDRESS_1237657] P1112  Protocol Version 4.0 • Effective with the issuance of this CM, for Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237658] dose of study drug and prior to Week 96 (i.e., visits at Week 48, Week 
60, Week 72, and Week 84 for all Dose Group 5 Coho rt 2 participants and also the visit at Week 36 
for Dose Group 5 Cohort 2 participants who do not receive a dose of study drug at Week 12) are 
broadened to ±6 weeks. The current V4.0 protocol -specified visit windows remain the target for these 
visits, and sites are encouraged to continue scheduling within these target windows whenever 
possible.  
 
Prioritization of Study Visit Procedures  
• Sites with full capacity to conduct in -person study visits at the study clinic through [ADDRESS_1237659] dose of stud y drug and at Week 96 (to confirm end -of-study HIV infection status) should 
continue to do so in full compliance with the protocol.  
• Sites with limited capacity to conduct in -person study visits at the study clinic through [ADDRESS_1237660] udy drug and at Week 96 should prioritize:  
− administration of study drug at Week [ADDRESS_1237661] not had 
complete cessation of breastfeeding, if the site is reasonably confident that the completion of the 
subsequent safety and other assessments will be possible.  
− conduct of laboratory evaluations per the “priority for blood samples” listings in the protocol 
Schedules of Evaluations. If it is not possible to perform these tests consistent with the site’s 
approved Protocol Analyte List (PAL), tests may be performed in alternative settings using 
alternate assays (alternate laboratories must adhere to local regulations for clinical laboratory 
testing).  
• Sites may also conduct study visits, in full or in part, beyond [ADDRESS_1237662] dose of study 
drug and prior to Week 96, off -site if permitted by [CONTACT_421555], health authority, and 
institutional policies. Where this option is permitted, site staff should communicate with 
parents/guardians to determine i n advance where and when such visits will take place, with adequate 
protections for safety, privacy, and confidentiality. Off -site visit procedures should be conducted by  
[CONTACT_421556], with a ttention paid to 
occupational health, biohazard containment, and specimen and data chain of custody. These staff 
should also be adequately trained and qualified to immediately manage any adverse events and/or 
social impacts that may occur during the visits . If adverse events requiring further evaluation or 
management are identified during an off -site visit, study staff conducting the visit should arrange for 
appropriate clinical management, in consultation with the IoR or designee, as needed.  
• Sites with no ability to conduct in -person study visits, either at the study clinic or off -site, should 
consider whether any study procedures can be conducted remotely (e.g., by [CONTACT_756]). Evaluations 
should be prioritized as follows (as applicable for the individual p articipant and scheduled study visit 
in question):  
1. Medical history taking  
2. Review of any injection site reactions  
 
Study Drug Supply  
• No changes in procedures for preparing, dispensing, or administering study product (VRC07 -523LS) 
are planned. These procedures must be performed on -site to ensure adherence to product temperature 
requirements. In addition, study product must be administered in a clinical setting to ensure 
appropriate management in the rare event of an acute hypersensitivity reaction.  
 
Documentation  
• Site-specific contingency plans, and the implementation thereof, should be documented in essential 
document files for IMPAACT P1112.  
Letter of Amendment # [ADDRESS_1237663] P1112  Protocol Version 4.0 • Documentation should be entered in participant study charts in real -time should any of the following 
occur:  
- Missed visits  
- Out-of-window visits  
- Off-site visits (document the location of the visit)  
- Incomplete or partial visits (document which procedures were performed and which were not)  
- Remote contacts performed in lieu of in -person visits (document method used to complete the 
contact [CONTACT_133165])  
- Any other participant contacts  
- Use of alternate laboratories or alternate laboratory assays  
- Non-standard provision of study drug  
• In consultation with the Division of AIDS, the IMPAACT Network is developi[INVESTIGATOR_515971]/or reporting protocol deviations that may occur due to limited site 
capacity to conduct study visits or procedures during the COVID -19 pandemic. Similar guidance will 
be provided for documentation of us e of alternate laboratories or alternate laboratory assays. Once 
this Network -level guidance is available, it will be provided in a separate communication to all sites.

implemented immediately upon issuance.  Consistent with [LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration 
guidance, institutional review board/ethics co mmittee (IRB/EC) approval of this CM is not required by 
[CONTACT_421553]. However, given the context of the COVID -19 pandemic 
and the importance of the guidance provided in this CM, sites should submit this CM to IRBs/ECs for 
their information or, if required by [CONTACT_1026]/ECs, for their review and approval.  
 
The purpose of this CM is to provide operational flexibility for conducting study visits and procedures 
when needed to ensure , when possible, completion of protocol -specified  study product dosing for 
participants in Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237665] P1112  Protocol 
Team will determine when, i n the future, the guidance provided in this CM is no longer applicable. When 
such a determination is made, study sites will be formally notified and instructed to inform their 
IRBs/EC s.

1.1 Background  
In the [LOCATION_002] and other resource rich countries, the risk of Mother to Child Transmission 
(MTCT) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus -1 (HIV) has  been dramatical ly reduced through the 
combination of wide scale testing for HIV during pregnancy, treatment of all pregnant HIV -
infected women with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), provision of cesarean 
section if the pregnant woman has active viral replicat ion, administration of antiretroviral 
therapy to the infant for the first six weeks of life, and formula  feeding.  With all these measures, 
1% or less of HIV -exposed infants will become HIV -infected .  However, in resource poor 
countries  prevention of trans mission is not so successful, resulting in continued MTCT of HIV to 
260,000  infants each year  [1].  A partial list of factors that contribute to ongoing transmission in 
this setting include late diagnosis of maternal HIV infection, sometimes as late as the intrapartum  
period; lack of universal access to HAART during pregnancy; continued need to breast feed  at 
least through the first year of life in most of the developi[INVESTIGATOR_19744]; and limited access to maternal 
HAART or nevirapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (NVP) for the breast feeding infant.  
 
In the [LOCATION_002], while transmission has been significantly reduced, HIV MTCT continues to 
occur .  Review of these transmission events allows identification of infants at highest risk of 
perinatal transmission and, therefore, the most likely to benefit fro m additional interventions that 
might further reduce the risk of intrapartum transmission of HIV .  Data on ongoing transmission 
in the US comes in part from the  US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Enhanced 
Perinatal Surveillance in 15 U.S. jurisd ictions .  In a study evaluating transmission risk in 2005 -
2008 in 8,054 births to HIV -infected mothers, 179 infants (2.2%) wer e diagnosed with HIV 
infection  [2].  The odds of having an HIV -infected infant were higher among HIV -infected 
women who were tested late, had no antiretroviral (ARV) medications, abused illicit substances, 
breastfed, or had lower CD4 cell counts .  In another report of nearly 8,600  births to HIV -infected 
women reported to the CDC, 8% of women did not receive prenatal care; of those with prenatal 
care, 3% did not receive HIV testing during pregnancy; of those with HIV testing, 6% did not 
receive ARV prophylaxis or treatment during pr egnancy; of those who received antenatal 
therapy, 5% did not receive ARV  drugs during labor and delivery [3].  In a study of 707 women 
receiving HAART during pregnancy, overall transmission was 1.6%; MTCT was directly 
correlated with HIV viral load nearest delivery and duration of HAART during pregnancy and 
CD4 count near delivery were correlated with viral load  [4].  A number of studies have 
demonstrated that duration of ARV prophylaxis during pregnancy is significantly associated with 
the risk of MTCT  [4, 5]; in the European Collaborative Study, MTCT was significantly related to 
insufficient antenatal HAART, defined as  no or <13 days of HAART  [4].  An additional 
important risk factor for transmission in the U.S. is acute HIV infection during pregnancy in 
women with initially negative HIV tests  [6].  Finally, the number of women with HIV infection 
giving birth in the U.S. has increased by [CONTACT_3450] 30% since the year 2000 to 
approximately 9,000 annually, which can result in increased perinatal transmission secondary to 
these missed opportunities for prevention  [3]. Thus, infants born to mothers with late diagnosis 
of HIV, receiving no antiretroviral drugs or short duration of HAART, or detectable viral load at 
delivery, are at particularly high risk of HIV transmission in the U.S. as well as in developi[INVESTIGATOR_18504].  
 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237713] feeding carries a significant risk of HIV transmission: without antiretroviral 
therapy to mother or infant, transmission risk over the first year of life is between 5 and 15%  [7-
9].  The risk can be reduced by [CONTACT_884766], rather than mixed feeding, in the first six 
months and provision of antiretroviral therapy during the time of breastfeeding to either mother 
or infant .  Recommended therapy to prevent breast milk transmissi on includes either HAART to 
the mother or NVP to the inf ant during the period of breast feeding .  However, even with 
treatment, breast milk transmi ssion occurs in approximately 2 to 3% of infants  [7, 8].   
 
Breast feeding continues in spi[INVESTIGATOR_884744] a 
substantial survival advantage in low resource settings.  In a meta -analysis conducted by [CONTACT_884767] (WHO) collaborative study  team , breast feeding in the first two 
months of life provided a 6 -fold reduction in infectious disease mortality  [10].  This benefit 
diminished over time but remained significant throughout the first year of life with a 1.[ADDRESS_1237714] opportunity for a child to remain alive  and HIV -infection free.  Therefore, it 
remains critically important to identify means whereby [CONTACT_884768].  
 
Administration of pre -formed antibodies, also known as passive immunization, can pro vide 
protection from infection or disease if protection is mediated through antibodies.  Evidence 
increasingly suggests that antibody, in particular neutralizing antibody, has the potential to 
prevent infection with HIV  [11-15].  Further, passive antibody has been successfully used to 
prevent disease caused by [CONTACT_884769].  Infants born to women with hepatitis 
B who receive a single dose of hepatitis  B immune globulin (HBIG) are protected against 
transmission in the intrapartum period  [16] and infants at risk for serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_489563] (RSV) who receive monthly doses of the monoclonal  antibody ( mAb ), palivizumab 
(Synagis®), have a reduced risk of serious RSV illness during the first few months of life  [17]. 
These two examples highlight viral infections that can be prevented with administration of 
polyclonal and monoclonal antibody and suggest the possibility that passive antibody might 
prevent mother to child transmission of HIV.  
 
While previous studies  of mono clonal antibodies  (mAb) to prevent MTCT of HIV have been 
proposed, the studies were not implemented because there was no antibody product with broad, 
cross clade neutralization ability that also lacked anti -self-reactivity .  Recently, i nvestigators in 
the Vaccine Research Center (VRC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have described a 
broadly neutralizing mAb, VRC01  [18, 19].  VRC01 is  a recombinant human immunoglobulin 
G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibo dy produced in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line that 
binds to the CD4 binding site of gp120 and neutralizes more than 90% of a diverse panel of tier 2 
viruses ( Table 1).  Antibody levels of 50 µg/mL neutralize (IC 50) 91% of isolates tested and more 
than 70% are neutralized by 1 µg/mL.  In comparison, the mAb b12,  [19-21]  which was the 
prior gold standard for broad neutralization, achieved a n IC 50 at 50 µg/mL against <50% of tier 2 
isolates.  Potency breadth curves (   
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 19 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  Figure 2) demonstrate broad and potent neutralization against a panel of 179 viruses.  Further, 
there is no evidence that VRC01 is auto - or poly -reactive as demonstrated by [CONTACT_884770] (ANA) reactivity, anticardiolipin assay, or prolongation of the activated partial 
thromboplastin time (aPTT)  [22].  Additional experiments, outlined in the  Investigator’s 
Brochure  (IB), detail extensive immunohistochemical studies performed on 38 types of tissue for 
adults and 21 types of tissue from ne onates demonstrating no cross reactivity with any tissue 
type (IB) .  Anti-self properties limited the development of earlier “broadly” neutralizing anti -
HIV monoclonal antibodies such as 2F5 and 4E10  [23].  Based on the potent and broad 
neutralizing activity as well as  the in vitro safety profile, V RC01 holds tremendous promise as a 
therapeutic agent to further reduce HIV transmission in infants.   
 
Two groups have evaluated the ability of monoclonal antibodies to neutralize early infant virus 
and both showed that V RC01 was a potent inhibitor, neutralizing 18/23 infant isolates in one 
study [24] and six of seven early infant isolates in a second study  [25], demonstra ting that 
VRC01 is capable of neutralizing early, transmitted virus.

determined plasma concentrations up to 28 days after IV or SC administration of 40mg/kg of 
pre-GMP VRC01 in female rhesus macaques.  The plasma concentration of VRC01 at day 14 
exceeded 50 µg/mL in 7/8 animals and 10 µg/mL in 7/8 animals ( IB).  In addition, detectable 
concentrations were measured in rectal, vaginal,  and nasal secretions .  The c hallenge -protection 
experiments were then completed in rhesus macaques using virulent chimeric SHIV which 
contains the HIV envelope in an SIV background.  The first experiment included groups of male 
rhesus macaques infused  IV with research -grade VRC01 5 or 20 mg/kg or control human IgG.  
At [ADDRESS_1237716] -infusion animals were challenged intrarectally with 300 tissue culture infectious 
doses (TCID) 50 of SHIV SF162P3.  All four animals infused with 20 mg/kg remained 
uninfected whereas two of four infused with 5 mg/kg had confirmed infection and three  of four 
animals in the control group became infected.   
 
A similar study was conducted in female macaques but fo r this experiment all animals received 
IV VRC01 20mg/kg or control human IgG and the challenge was performed via the intravaginal 
route.  Again, all four animals infused with VRC01 remained uninfected, whereas three of four 
animals infused with control hum an IgG were infected.  
 
To extend these findings another challenge -protection study was conducted using a different 
SHIV and a larger number of animals.  Groups of at least 4 male rhesus macaques were 
administered a single dose of research -gradeVRC01 IV at  20 (n=6), 5 (n=6), 1.25 (n=4) or 0.3 
(n=16) mg/kg .  Fourteen controlled animals received human IgG .  At day [ADDRESS_1237717] infusion, all 
animals were challenged intrarectally with 1mLof SHIV -Ba-L virus that had a TCID50 titer of 
12,800/ml in Tzm -bl cells .  All an imals infused with 20, 5 and 1.25 mg/kg VRC01 were 
protected from infection with SHIV -Ba-L; 7 out of 16 animals infused with 0.3 mg/kg were

challenge with SHIV -Ba-L.  One hundred percent protection from SHIV -Ba-L challenge was 
demonstrated at 20, 5 and 1.25 mg/kg dose of VRC01 administered IV .   
 
In the final challenge -protection experiment conducted by [CONTACT_884771] , seven newborn M. 
mulatta  received a single SC dose of VRC01 followed by a single high dose oral challenge with 
SHIV SF162P3 24 hours later.  This animal model was previously shown to result in acquisition 
of infection in 100%  of challenged animals.  In this experiment, one of fiv e animals that received 
5 mg/kg had breakthrough infection and zero of two animals that received 20 mg/kg were 
infected.    
 
Although there has been a great increase in the understanding of the biological events occurring 
during HIV transmission in humans,  there is much that is not yet known.   Non-human primate 
(NHP) models using various strains of SIV and SHIV have been developed, refined, and 
improved over years to more closely mimic the known events of HIV transmission  [26]. The 
NHP models provide important data about transmission and potential efficacy of prevention 
interventions.   However, a fully predictive an imal model is not available and animal data have 
sometimes failed to predict the results of human trial  [27].  On the other hand, careful design of 
animal models recapi[INVESTIGATOR_884745] a failed HIV candidate vaccine in a human trial 
indicating the potential to provide predictive results  [28, 29].  NHP transmission studies are the 
best available pre -clinical model but proof of efficacy must be determined in human trials  [26, 
27].   
 
VRC01LS was produced from VRC01 through modification by [CONTACT_3725] -directed mutagenesis to 
increase its binding affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) , and the resulting antibody was 
designated VRC01LS. The LS designation specifies methionine to leucine (L) and asparagine to 
serine (S) (M428L/N434S, referred to as L S) changes within the C -terminus of the heavy chain 
constant region far outside of the antigen -combining site [30]. Other than the two amino  acid 
difference, VRC01LS is structurally identical to VRC01. As a result of its enhanced FcRn 
function, VRC01LS has an extended half -life in both serum and mucosal tissue compared to 
VRC01 and improved protection against primate SHIV infection [31]. 
 
VRC07 -523LS was derived from VRC -[ADDRESS_1237718] SHIV infection in vivo in animal studies, suggesting a potential 
clinical advantage in humans for preventive and/or treatment of HIV. Like VRC01 and VRC01 -
LS, VRC07 -523LS is targeted against the HIV -[ADDRESS_1237719] amino acid residue of the light chain. The LS designation specifies 
methionine to leucine (L) and asparagine to serine (S) (M428L/N4 34S, referred to as LS) 
changes within the C -terminus of the heavy chain constant region. The LS mutation was 
introduced by [CONTACT_3725] -directed mutagenesis to increase the binding affinity for the neonatal Fc -
receptor (FcRn), resulting in increased recirculation  of functional IgG, thus increasing plasma 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237720] has significantly increased potency and breadth compared to 
VRC01 or VRC01LS ( Table 2).    
 
VRC07 -523LS is 5 - to 8-fold more potent than VRC01, with an inhibitory concentration IC50 
<50 mcg/mL against 96% of HIV -1 pseudoviruses representing the major circulating HIV -1 
clades and IC50 <1 mcg/mL against 92% of HIV -[ADDRESS_1237721] a prolonged half -life over VRC07 by [CONTACT_2902] 2 -

than VRC01 -LS in rhesus macaques  [32].

IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237722] occurred  in adults in the US. The 
studies are summarized in Table 3 below. T wo Phase I studies of VRC01 occurred in HIV 
positive and HIV negative adults, respectively, to confirm safety and PK in both populations  [33, 
34]. These were dose -escalating up to 40mg/kg. Similarly, safety and PK studies of VRC01LS 
[35] and VRC07 -523LS have been completed in adul ts. The studies were conducted at the NIH 
VRC and had data available prior to enrollment of infants into IMPAACT P1112. Additional 
studies are now enrolling large numbers of adult subjects into studies of each of these 
monoclonals in adults for prevention and treatment of HIV ( Table 3). 
 
The present study is the  initial infant study and it will be conducted at sites in the US and in 
Africa . Further  infant stud ies will be conducted through IMPAACT in settings where 
breastfeeding of infants remains the best  option for infants born to HIV -infected women .  This is 
a Phase I safety study that may position IMPAACT to conduct  a large efficacy study depending 
on the resul ts of an ongoing study in adults.

Preclinical:  
A series of experiments have been conducted to assess anti -self properties and toxicities 
in laboratory animals  of both study products .  These studies are described in detail in the  
respective  IBs.  To briefly summarize;  antiphospholipid characteristics were assessed by 
[CONTACT_65358].  The first method utilized a luminescent assay to measure binding 
of VRC01 to cardiolipin .  While another anti -HIV mAb demonstrated strong bind ing to 
cardi olipin, neither Synagis (an FDA -approved mAb), nor VRC01 reacted with 
cardiolipin.  In a separate experiment, anti -Phospholipid characteristics were evaluated by 
[CONTACT_884772] (aPTT).  Again, VRC01 wa s 
compared to 4E10 and Synagis and again, antiphospholipid activity was seen for 4E10 
but not for Synagis or VRC01 .   
 
Anti-nuclear antigen reactivity was assessed with a commercial lupus kit (anti -ANA).  
Unlike other anti -HIV neutralizing mAb, VRC01 does not react with nuclear antigens.   
 
In an additional experiment, binding to a human cell line was assessed via 
immunohistochemistry.  In this experiment, fluorescently -labeled VRC01 does not bind 
Hep-2 cells.   
 
In experiments to evaluate the potential for  human autoreactivity, VRC01LS was 
assessed for anti -phospholipid reactivity, anti -nuclear antigen reactivity, binding to a 
human e pi[INVESTIGATOR_114239] (HEp -2) by i mmunohistochemistry, and potential “off target” 
binding to protein arrays microchips precoated with 9400 full -length human proteins: all 
experiments showed no clinically significant autoreactivity.  In an assessment of potential 
“off target” binding in a human Tissue Cross -Reactivity study VRC01LS and VRC01 
variably stained cytoplasm and c ytoplasmic granules in epi[INVESTIGATOR_125515]/or decidual cells in 
several human tissues. The findings were judged of n o toxicologic significance for mAb  
as the cytoplasmic c ompartment is not available to mA b in vivo  [36, 37].     
 
As previously noted, VRC01  and VRC01LS differ by [CONTACT_884773]. As a result 
of these changes, binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is increased resulting in an 
extended half -life in both serum and mucosal tissue compared to VRC01 and improved 
protection against primate  SHIV infection [31]. VRC01LS has similar in vitro  
neutralization potency and breadth when compared to VRC01 (wild type). VRC01LS is 
found at higher concentrations in macaque rectal secretions, as well as rectal and vaginal 
tissues. When administered IV at a sing le dose of 10 mg/kg to rhesus macaques, 
VRC01LS persisted up to 70 days in rectal tissues , while VRC01 was no longer 
detectable after 28 days.  
 
In preclinical experiments in macaques, after a single dose of VRC01LS was 
administered intravenously (IV) at do ses from 0.02 to 20 mg/kg (n=26), or 
subcutaneously (SC) at a dose of 10 mg/mL (n=6), there was no indication of local 
reactogenicity, anaphylactoid reaction, or any systemic disease (based on clinical  
symptoms).  In a series of experiments, VRC01LS was co mpared to VRC01 in ability to 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237727] from challenge in male and female macaques.  In all experiments, VRC01LS 
demonstrated a longer half -life (increased about 3 -fold), persistent levels in GI tract and 
other mucosal surfaces, and improved ability to prote ct from infection.   
 
To summarize the VRC01LS preclinical data, VRC01 and VRC01LS are similar with 
VRC01LS displaying improved pharmacokinetics, identical or improved antiviral effects, 
and no unexpected cross reactivity in any of the neonatal human tissu es examined 
(VRC01LS IB, Version 3.0, dated [ADDRESS_1237728] 2017).  
 
In other pre -clinical safety studies, VRC07 -523LS demonstrated sli ght reactivity to 
phospholipi[INVESTIGATOR_1842]  a small subset of nuclear antigens, minimal reactivity with HEp -[ADDRESS_1237729] on aPTT by [CONTACT_884774][INVESTIGATOR_805]. In studies of potential “off 
target” binding in a GLP tissue cross -reactivity study with normal adult human and rat 
tissue, VRC07 -523LS staining of cytoplasmic and extracellular elements was similar 
between the human and Spra gue-Dawley rat tissues examined . According to ICH S6(R1) , 
monoclonal antibody binding to cytoplasmic sites generally is considered of little to no 
toxicologic significance. In further “off target” binding studies in human tissue, VRC07 -
523LS staining was o bserved in cytoplasm, cytoplasmic granules, and/or perinuclear 
cytoplasm of various neonatal human tissues. No membrane specific binding was 
observed suggesting that there is no cross -reactivity of toxicologic concern.  
 
Pharmacokinetics Study in Sprague -Dawley Rats :  
A single -dose IV and SC PK study (SRI Study No . M896 -11) was performed by [CONTACT_884775] (Menlo Park, CA) with VRC -HIVMAB060 -00-AB (VRC01) in male and 
female Sprague -Dawley rats in accordance with U.S. FDA “Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies. ” This study was conducted with a pre -GMP 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_269819]01 using a purification process similar to that of the GMP clinical -grade 
drug product.  For the PK study, a cohort of rats received VRC01 on day 1 at 4 mg/kg 
and 40 mg/kg by [CONTACT_700610] 40 mg/kg by [CONTACT_843123] . Each of these 3 groups contained 9 male and 9 female rats . VRC01 levels 
in serum were determined using an enzyme -linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) with 
samples c ollected pre -dose from each animal and from an additional 3 males and 3 
females to provide untreated control serum . Blood was collected from 3 rats/sex/PK 
group for a total of 4 –5 collections per PK animal at each of the following time points: 1, 
4, 8, 24,  48, and 72 hours and 7, 14, 21, and 29 days .   
 
VRC01 administration by [CONTACT_884776] a dose -proportional exposure . The 
terminal elimination phase half -life (t1/2) was about 10 days, with clearance (Cl) of 
approximately 20 ml/day/kg and volume of distribution (Vd) that was about 0.28 L/kg, 
indicating that the drug was distributed primarily in the serum and eliminated slowly . 
VRC01 administration by [CONTACT_884777] 7 days for 
males or 3 days for female animals . The maximum serum concentration (C max), and area 
under the concentration -time curve to the last time point (AUC last) values were lower 
when 40 mg/kg was administered by [CONTACT_269887] . The 
bioavailability of 40 mg/kg VRC01 administ ered by [CONTACT_269888]

VRC01 after SC administration that was observed in this study [10, 11].   
 
Repeat Dose Toxicity Study : 
A repeat dose IV and SC toxicity study (SRI Study No. M896 -11) was performed by [CONTACT_884778] (Menlo Park, CA) with VRC -HIVMAB060 -00-AB (VRC01) in male and 
female Sprague -Dawley rats in accordance with U.S. FDA “Good Laboratory Practice 
(GLP) for Nonclinical Laboratory Studies. ” This study was conducted with a pre -GMP 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_269819]01 using  a purification process similar to that of the GMP clinical -grade 
drug product .   
 
For the safety assessment, vehicle or 4 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, or 400 mg/kg VRC01 was 
administered by [CONTACT_884779] 1 and 8 to Groups 1 through 4, respectively .  
An additional group (Group 5) received 40 mg/kg VRC01 via SC administration to the 
dorsal scapular region on days 1 and 8 .   
 
Results obtained showed that both IV and SC routes of administration were well tolerated 
in the rats . All animals survived until thei r scheduled necropsy . No findings or changes 
were seen in clinical observation, body weight, food consumption, body temperature, 
injection site irritation, hematology, coagulation, or organ weight evaluations that are 
attributed to administration of VRC01 . VRC01 administration resulted in small, transient, 
dose-dependent increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) on day [ADDRESS_1237731] was up to 1.5 -fold 
when compared with prestudy leve ls; the increase in ALP was up to 2.[ADDRESS_1237732] and ALP are of minimal toxicological significance 
because of the following: (1) the  animals had recovered or were recovering by [CONTACT_2006] 30; 
(2) there were no corresponding histopathology findings in the organs typi[INVESTIGATOR_884746]/or ALP increases (liver, kidney, muscle, bone, or intestines); 
and (3) other biomarkers of liver or  kidney damage such as alanine aminotransferase, 
creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolytes were not meaningfully affected after 
administration of VRC01.  
 
Other than erythema red discoloration of the administration site in one male in the SC 
group o n day 9, there were no other gross necropsy observations attributable to VRC01 
administration . There were no histopathology findings considered related to IV 
administration of VRC01 . However, histopathology evaluation revealed subacute 
inflammation at the SC injection site on day 9, one day after injection, in all 10 SC 
administered rats; dermal inflammation was usually minimal or mild while SC

Clinical  Studies : 
Phase I clinical trials of VRC01 and VRC01LS are currently underway. Completed 
studies include first -in-humans dose escalation studies for safety, tolerability, and PK of 
VRC01 in HIV -1-infected (VRC 601) [33] and HIV -1-uninfected (VRC 602) adults  [34]. 
Both the IV and SC routes of admin istration have been evaluated. A clinical trial (HVTN 
104) evaluating serial dosing using several different IV or SC doses with different dosing 
schedules, for prevention of HIV -1 is completed [38, 39]. Studies of multiple doses of 
VRC01 to reduce markers of HIV -[ADDRESS_1237735] or completed (A5340, NIH 15 -I-0140, A5342)  [40], 
as is a study of the efficacy of VRC01 administration during ART interruption in adults 
(RV 397) [41] and another study of VRC01 for treatment during acute HIV -[ADDRESS_1237736]  (RV 398).   
 
VRC [ADDRESS_1237737] study of the VRC01 mAb in HIV -1-infected participants [33]. It 
was a dose -escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, dose, P K, and a nti-antibody 
immune responses. VRC 601 opened in September 2013 as a single -site study at the NIH 
Clinical Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and in total, 23 HIV -1-infected participants, 
including 15 aviremic ARV -treated participants and eight viremic no n-ARV treated 
participants received one or two doses of VRC01 IV or SC at doses ranging from 1 
mg/kg to up to 40 mg/kg . The eight viremic patients received a single dose of study 
product IV and at 40 mg/kg. The first infusion at 1 mg/kg IV was administered  in the 
VRC [ADDRESS_1237738] 40 mg/kg IV administration in 
this study occurred May 12, 2014, and the last infusion in VRC 601 occurred on April 6,  
2015. There were a total of 36  infusions in 23 participants. All IV and/or SC infusions 
were well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237739] -infusion 
included headache (7), myalgia (6), malaise (4), nausea (4), joint pain (3), and fever (1); 
all were mild [33].   
 
VRC [ADDRESS_1237740] . A single 40 mg/kg IV dose led to a 1.1 to 1.8 -
log 10 drop in plasma viral load in 6 of the 8 viremic participants not on ART [33]. Two 
viremic participants had only a marginal drop in plasma viral loads of 0.26 and  0.18 log 10 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, respectively; however, these two individuals were found to have baseline 
virus that was relati vely neutralization resistant. Two adults, who had baseline plasma 
viremia <1000 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL, had sustained suppression of viremia for over [ADDRESS_1237741] asma level of VRC01 decreased. The adults with higher baseline plasma viremia 
had evidence of outgrowth of escap e variants in rebound viremia. These data indicate that 
a single dose of VRC01 at 40 mg/kg IV given as monotherapy resulted in an average 
virus load significantly decreased between days 3 and 21 after infusion compared to 
baseline, with the nadir at day 9 . A 0.5 log 10 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL or greater decrease in plasma 
viral load is considered a positive antiviral response to a single anti retroviral drug.  
Among the ART -treated, virally suppressed adults, no change in proviral DNA load was 
observed after rec eiving two infusions of VRC01. However, the study demonstrated a 
VRC01 -mediated anti -viral effect, with preferential suppression of neut ralization -
sensitive strains  [33].   
 
VRC [ADDRESS_1237742] study of the VRC01  mAb in HIV -1-uninfected adults  [34]. It was 
a dose -escalation  study to examine safety, tolera bility, dose, and PK of VRC01. VRC [ADDRESS_1237743] 2014. There were three 
open -label, dose -escalation groups receiving intravenous doses at Week 0 and Week 4 
(5mg/kg, 20mg/kg, 40 mg/kg) and one double -blinded, placebo -controlled group f or SC 
administration (5mg/kg). Cumulatively, 23 participants received 43 doses of VRC01, 
including five partici pants who each received two SC 5mg/kg doses. As observed in VRC 
601, the IV and/or SC infusions were well tolerated with no SAEs or dose -limiting 
toxicity  [34]. There were only mild local reactions (5/23 partici pants) limited to redness 
and tenderness which were more comm on for the SC dose recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Similarly, only 
mild systemic reactions (nausea, headache, myalgia, malaise) were observed in a 
minority of participants. Anti-VRC01 antibody responses were not det ected, and the mAb 
retained its expected neutralizing activity in serum.   
 
Data from ACTG A5340 demonstrated maintenance of viral suppression for [ADDRESS_1237744] delay, 
overall, in th e return of viremia compared to historical controls  [40]. 
 
Further study of 88 adults at low risk for HIV infection (50% female) demonstrated 
favorable safety and PK profiles when the antibody was administered at varying doses 
over a prolonged period o f time in study HVTN 104 [42]. Participants were followed for 
[ADDRESS_1237745] been no SAEs related to VRC01 that 
required expe dited reporting to the FDA or other regulatory authorities and no study 
safety pauses for adverse events. In Phase 2 trials (still blinded), there have been 22 
related AEs of mild or moderate severity in 15 participants (two AEs of change in sleep 
pattern,  two AEs of hypogeusia (decreased ability to taste), five AEs of urticaria, and one 
event each of wheals and erythema -left upper arm/right calf/under right breast, urticaria 
of upper limbs, urticaria of the face, infusion site pruritus, generalized body it chiness, 
low neutrophil count, dizziness during infusion, lightheadedness, loose stools, dermatitis, 
headache, nausea and malaise). There has been one related severe (Grade 3) AE of 
urticaria in one participant (VRC01 IB, Version 8.0, dated [ADDRESS_1237746]  2017) .   
  
Given the potential for urticarial and/or allergic reactions after injections that may present 
with non -specific findings such as GI symptoms, c linicians should observe infants 
carefully following each injection and should manage any post -injection 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions per site standard of care. In particular , clinicians should 
pay special attention to gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g ., as part of post -injection 
observations and during contacts ). 
 
VRC [ADDRESS_1237747] in human dose -escalation study to examine safety, tolerability, 
dose, and pharmacokinetics of VRC -HIVMAB080 -00-AB (VRC01LS) monoclonal 
antibody in healthy adults [35]. The first 37 volunteers who received administrations of 
VRC01LS had no serious adverse events (SAEs) or dose -limiting toxicities. Mild malaise 
and myalgia were the most common adverse events (AEs). There were six AEs  assessed 
as possibly related to VRC01LS administration, and all were mild in severity and 
resolved during the study.  
 
Regarding local reactions, VRC01LS administrations have been generally well tolerated. 
There was one instance of Grade 1 injection site reaction with persistent 
hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_884747] 28 . Overall, three of 21 participants  
(14.3 %) who received VRC01LS IV and 14 of 18 participants  (77.8%) who received 
VRC01LS SC and completed diary cards reported solicited local reac tions in the week 
after product administration. These include 14 reports of mild local pain/tenderness. One 
participant  in Group 5 (5 mg/kg SC) reported moderate pain, two participants  (Group 5, 5 
mg/kg SC and Group 6, 20 mg/kg IV) reported mild bruising, two participants  in Group 5 
(5 mg/kg SC) reported mild swelling, and two participants  (Group 2 and Group 5, 5 
mg/kg SC) reported mild redness.  
 
Preliminary pharmacokinetic data from an ongoing clinical trial of VRC01LS in healthy 
adults shows increased persistence of antibody in participant sera with an elimination 
half-life of 71 +/ - 18 days.  The mean (+/ -SD) serum concentration 12 weeks after on e IV 
administration of 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg were 180 +/ - 43 mug/mL (n = 7) and 326 +/ - 35 
mug/mL (n = 5), respectively,  which supports the planned dosing interval of [ADDRESS_1237748] P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 32 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  Dose Group 4, breastfed infants. See Section 1.2 and Section 9 of this protocol for 
rationale used in dose selection.  
 
There is an ongoing study (VRC6 05) in adult participants to determine safety and PK of 
VRC07 -523LS when administered intravenously or subcutaneously. To date, [ADDRESS_1237749] been enrolled and received one or more doses of between 1 mg/kg and 
40 mg/kg. The preliminary PK results co nfirm the slower elimination and a longer half -
life than “non -LS” bNAbs, but the half -life of VRC07 -523LS is not as long as has been 
described for VRC01LS. However, due to the increased potency, the resulting ability of 
plasma to neutralize virus is simila r or even slightly better with VRC07 -523LS even at 
trough concentrations. The net result may be an antibody that can still be given very 
infrequently that has enhanced breadth compared to VRC01LS.   
 
Twenty -five (25) of [ADDRESS_1237750] 1 dose of VRC07 -
523LS (12 SC and 25 IV administrations). One participant  withdrew prior to receiving 
the study product. There have been no SAEs and no safety pauses for AEs. Overall, [ADDRESS_1237751] (60%) have ha d at least one AE with the 
maximum severity being Grade [ADDRESS_1237752] administration. 
Specifically, one participant  enrolled in the 40  mg/k g IV group experienced a moderate 
infusion reaction with chills, rigors, fever, myalgia, and headache beginning 15 minutes 
after completion of the infusion. All symptoms resolved within 12 hours. Another 
participant  in the 20  mg/kg IV group experienced three separate infusion reactions (n=2 
moderate, n=1 mild) after each product infusion. The participant  experienced nausea, 
chills, rigors, malaise, tachycardia, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia.  
 
Four (25%) participants  reported mild or moderate systemic r eactogenicity symptoms 
three  days after product administration. The reported symptoms were malaise (n=2 mild, 
n=1 moderate), myalgia (n=2 mild, n=1 moderate), mild headache (n=2), and moderate 
chills (n=2).  Five of 8 subjects (62.5%) receiving VRC07 -523LS SC reported mild 
systemic reactogenicity symptoms: malaise (n=3), myalgia (n=2), headache (n=3), chills 
(n=1), nausea (n=1), and joint pain (n=2).    
 
Based on the PK and safety data available to date, the dose to be used in the present study 
is 80 mg (birt hweight ≥ 2.0 to < 4.5 kg) and 100 mg (birthweight ≥ 4.5 kg), or 
approximately 18 -40 mg/kg, administered subcutaneously (SC) as a single injection as 
close to birth as possible. This will be followed by a second [ADDRESS_1237753] P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 33 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  1.1.5 Passive antibody safety  in infants  
Use of monoclonal antibodies to prevent infectious disease is a relatively recent 
development; however, passive polyclonal antibody products have been used for decades 
with excellent safety profiles. The following paragraphs will first outline data on 
polyclonal antibody products followed by [CONTACT_884780].   
 
Polyclonal products have been delivered to infants via the intravenous (IV), 
intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous  routes (SC)  to prevent transmission of infections . 
Perhaps the best established and most frequently used product is hepatitis B 
immunoglobulin (HBIG) which is recommended as a single IM dose for all infants born 
to Hepatitis B antigen positive women in th e US (and many other countries)  [43]. This 
has been administered to thousands of infants as part of studies and as part of clinical care 
with few reported side effects. There is only one case report of an anap hylactic reaction 
in the literature [44]. In one study, HBIG was given by [CONTACT_884781]  [45]. Other polyclonal antibodies used in infants include 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_228809]®, Cytogam®, HIVIg, and IVIG. In a trial in which 500 women and their 
newborns received either HIVIg  or IVIG, side effects in the women w ere uncommon and 
when they did occur, they were generally mild or moderate; only two women had severe 
side effects. In that trial, only two infants had toxicity thought to be related to study drug 
infusion, all graded a s mild  [46]. In a very large study of IVIG to prevent infection in 
preterm infants, the product was found to not decrease the risk of death or serious 
disability; however, product related adverse events were rare and no different in the IVIG 
group compared to placebo  [47].   
 
There is considerably less experience in the use of  monoclonal antibodies in neonates and 
infants ; however, the data that do exist  support the safety of monoclonal antibody 
products and provide some information that helps to guide initial dosing . Currently, there 
are only two monoclonal antibody products FDA -approved to prevent an infectious 
disease: Palivizumab  (Synagis®),  an anti -RSV monoclonal antibody; and Raxibacumab, 
an anti anthracis toxin. While the latter is FDA -approved for children, there are no 
pediatric data availab le. The most extensive safety data come from use of Palivizumab 
and several other products  which are not FDA -approved , outlined below .   
   
Palivizumab  is a humanized murine mAb directed agai nst the F glycoprotein of RSV. 
This product is administered as a monthly 15 mg/kg intramuscular (IM) dose to infants at 
high risk of serious RSV  disease during the RSV season.  During the time of peak RSV 
activity (October through March) premature infants and others at high risk of severe 
disease may receive up to [ADDRESS_1237754] frequently reported adverse events listed in 
the package insert are noted in Table 4; none occur more frequently in the Palivizumab  
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_884748] .

reported during Trial [ADDRESS_1237755] been rarely reported. Because the 
reporting systems are voluntary, the actual incidence of such reactions cannot be 
determined. None of the reactions were fatal . It is not known whether the chimeric nature 
of Palivizumab (CDR3 region retaine d from original murine mAb on human IgG1 
backbone) plays a role in these rare hypersensitivity reactions and whether treatment with 
a fully human mAb like VRC01 would result in similar reactions .   
 
One theoretical concern with use of monoclonal antibodies  is that the patient could 
develop their own antibody directed against the monoclonal and then either clear the 
monoclonal more rapi[INVESTIGATOR_75763] (resulting in decreasing serum levels) or develop 
immune complex disease as the patient’s antibody and the adm inistered monoclonal 
antibody formed complexes. This possibility was previously evaluated when Palivizumab 
was administered and found not to occur. Similarly, this has been evaluated for the 
products described below and not found to occur.   
 
Other monoclo nal antibodies that have been administered to neonates or infants include 
pagibaximab (a human chimeric anti -staphylococcal mA b) [48, 49]; SB 209763 (a mouse 
humanized anti -RSV fusion protein)  [50]; and motavizumab (a maturation variant of 
palivizumab)  [51]. The above agents have been studied in preter m and term infants.  In 
all cases , the mA b was generally well tolerated. The one safety concern that was raised 
was for the motavizumab which was administered to over 5 ,000 children. Nine of 3 ,000 
(0.3%) children in one study of this product required treatment discontinuation due to a 
skin reaction; all in the treatment group (0 in placebo) and there was overall a higher 
incidence of  skin AE in the treated group. A partial list of anti -infective monoclonal 
antibodies studied in adults includes KPBA -101 (anti Pseudomonas ), CDA1, CDB1 (anti 
C. difficile ) and others. The efficacy to prevent disease varies between the products but 
the safety profile is consistently good.   
 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237756] been developed to treat 
cancer and/or autoimmune disease. A review of the currently FDA -approved monoclonal 
antibodies ( http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines ) lists 39 total products; [ADDRESS_1237757] with an infecting agent, rather than comp onents of human tissue are consistently 
well tolerated and safe even  when used in neonates. Given VRC01 documented lack of 
reactivity to human tissue, it is likely to be safe and well tolerated.    
 
1.1.6 Monoclonal antibody dosing  
The half-life (T1/2) of antibo dies depends on a variety of factors including the isotype  
(IgG vs IgM or IgA), the subclass (IgG1), the ongoing transudative lo sses in a patient, 
and patient age. In general, IgG antibodies have a half-life (T1/2) in the range of 14 to 28 
days.  In a primate model, VRC01 has a T 1/2 of 10 days, and VRC01LS has a T 1/2 of about 
30 days; however, clearance of a human mAb is expected to be increased in another 
animal species, therefore, it is anticipated that the T 1/2 will be substantially longer in 
humans.  The T 1/2 of the human monoclonal  Palivizumab in infants is 20 days. An initial 
pharmacokinetic study to determine T 1/[ADDRESS_1237758] been 
published [33, 34] and are detailed in the IB. These results indicate that PK parameters 
are comparable in these two adult populations. The participants received one or two IV or 
SC doses at 28-day intervals.  
 
In healthy adults receiving VRC01 20 and  40 mg/kg IV, maximum serum concentrations 
were 940 ±320 (n=8) and 1600 ±230 (n=5) mcg/ml, respectively, after the first infusion, 
and 1100 ±360 (n=5) and 1500 ±400 (n=5) mcg/ml after the second dose, respectively. At 
20 and 40mg/kg, mean  28-day trough serum concentrations were 35 ±6.5 (n=8) and 
57±19 (n=5), and 56 ±19 (n=5) and 80 ±40 (n=5) mcg/ml after the second dose, 
respectively. T he overall clearance for all IV groups (n=18) was 0.016 ±0.0033L/h. In the 
HIV-infected participants at 20 an d 40 mg/kg IV, maximum serum concentrations were 
1000 ±340 (n=3) and 1500 ±340 (n=11), respectively, after the first infusion, and 
1000 ±510 (n=3) and 1700 ±460 (n=2) mcg/ml after the second dose, respectively. At 20 
and 40mg/kg, mean 28 -day trough serum conce ntrations were 33 ±15 (n=3) and 30 ±16 
(n=11) after the first dose, and 46 ±27 (n=3) and 65 ±57 (n=2) mcg/ml after the second 
dose, respectively. The overall clearance for the IV groups (n=20) was 0.024 ±0.006 L/h. 
There were not significant differences in the PK parameters for the viremic and non -
viremic infected adults.    
 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 36 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  Evaluation of the SC route of administration in adults has been limited to the 5 mg/kg 
dose due to limitation on the volume that can be administered SC to adults.  As expected, 
the peak con centrations are achieved later than IV, at 67 and 62 hours for the uninfected 
and infected adults, respectively. The C max in plasma is higher for IV than SC dose 
(240±42 vs. 34 ±5 mcg/ml at a dose of 5 mg/kg in the infected adults). H owever, the 
clearance an d terminal half -life are similar between IV and SC. For the uninfected and 
infected participants, the terminal half -life was 15 ±3.9 and 12 ±4.5 days for IV dosing and 
17±2.9 and 11 ±5 days for SC dosing, respectively. Clearance (CL) following IV 
administrati on and apparent clearance (CL/F) following SC administration were similar 
suggesting good bioavailability (F) following SC administration.  
 
For VRC01LS , the maximum serum concentrations in adults in VRC606 following IV 
administration of 20mg/kg and 40mg/kg were 1221 ±398 mcg/mL (n=8) and 2451 +626 
mcg/mL (n=3) , respectively,  with an overall half -life over 2 months. Following the single 
dose SC administratio n of VRC01LS 5 mg/kg, the C max is reduced to levels about 25% of 
those seen following IV administration but the SC  AUC is only reduced by [CONTACT_2902] 20% 
compared to IV.    
 
In preliminary PK studies of VRC07 -523LS, adults who received 20 mg/kg (N=8) had a 
mean (± SD) day 28 concentration of 195 mcg/mL (+63) and a mean day 84 
concentration of 37 mcg/mL (+5.5). While the levels at day [ADDRESS_1237759] majority due to mother to child transmission (MTCT). Measures to prevent 
transmission of HIV infection have improved dramatically leading to calls by [CONTACT_884782] 2015. In spi[INVESTIGATOR_884749], perinatal and breast milk tr ansmission continues to occur. A substanti al 
number of women are diagnosed and treated late in pregnancy resulting in higher rates of 
peripartum and early post -natal transmission even with maternal and/or infant 
antiretroviral  therapy . Even with effective treatments for infants born to women with 
known infection, in high seroincidence regions, women will continue to transmit due to 
new maternal infecti ons that occur after delivery. Studies show that acute maternal 
infection can occur in as many as 3% of women in high prevalence regions and the risk  
of transmission in the setting of acute infection is dramatically increased  [52-56]. 
Protection of all infants will only be provided by [CONTACT_884783];  however, a safe and effective vaccine capable of providing long -lasting 
protection is still not available. Recently, investigators at the [LOCATION_002] National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAI D) Vaccine Research Center ( VRC) at 
NIH have  discovered monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that have potent and broad 
neutralizing activity (<50 µg/ml) against  over 90%  of tier 2 (difficult to neutralize) 
viruse s from a multiclade panel. This broad and potent neutralizing ability has the 
potential to prev ent HIV transmission in a variety of settings but in particular, holds 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237760] to take into subsequent trials.  
 
Produc t availability  
Monoclonal antibody products currently available in the US are extremely expensive . 
Lower prices and ability to deliver in resource poor settings are made feasible by r ecent 
advances in technology which allow  produc tion of  clinical grade mon oclonal antibody 
products for dramatically reduced prices ; as low as $[ADDRESS_1237761] -of-goods 
depending on the scale of production . Thus, if the appropriate dose  of VRC01  is 40 
mg/kg initially followed by 20 mg/kg monthly, total cost -of-goods  for 6 months’  therapy 
is <$[ADDRESS_1237762] would be 
about $3,[ADDRESS_1237763] how products will be made feasibly available in resource -constrained settings; 
however, i t is clear that the technology can be adapted to low cost production and that a 
product which is sufficiently effective could be made available to populations that need 
it. These arrangements cannot be guaranteed or even planned until further evidence of 
product efficacy is in hand . 
 
Rationale for study population  
The greatest risk for MTCT of HIV occurs in Africa and India, among infants who are 
being breastfed; however, we are proposing this initial study to also include  non-breast -
fed neonates in the US  as well as at select international sites . In spi[INVESTIGATOR_884750] a safe and 
affordable option and PMTCT regimens are available , there continue to be high risk 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 38 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  infants. The high-risk group includes infants born to women who seek care late in 
pregnancy, even as late as in labor, and who are , therefore, not treated until the 
intrapartum period.  Risk of transmission in this setting, even with combination therapy 
to the infant is >5% [57]. Further, there are women who are known to be infected and on 
therapy but with ongo ing viral replication due to poor  adherence or resistant virus. These 
high-risk infants have the potential to benefit from a neutralizing monoclonal antibody.   
 
The study product has the potential to decrease mother to child transmission of HIV in a 
varie ty of settings and this study is an initial step in  the evaluation of the product.  
Ultimately, the target population that can benefit from a passive antibody would include 
infants both in the US and in resource poor countries. In the US, the target populat ion 
would include high risk infants: that is, infants born to women who have replicating virus 
late in pregnancy, either due to late diagnosis, late presentation for care, poor medication 
adherence, or resistant virus. W orldwide, the target population woul d include infants with 
ongoing breast  milk exposure who have a continued r isk during the period of 
breast feeding and around the time of weaning in spi[INVESTIGATOR_884751]. An added 
intervention such as this is necessary to eventually achieve a generat ion free of HIV.  
 
Risks and Benefits to Study Participants   
The potential benefit of the product is the potential for further reduction of MTCT of 
HIV, when given in addition to standard of care ARV therapy . This is particularly true 
for VRC01LS  and VRC07 -523LS , which – because of the long half -life – might be easier 
to implement as a public health measure in countries where risk of transmission from 
breastfeeding is common. The potential for this benefit is supported by [CONTACT_884784] 
(ability to  neutralize) and non -human primate experiments, both outlined in greater detail 
in the background section of the protocol .  
 
The potential risks of the product include risks of reactions at the local injection site or, in 
rare cases, systemic allergic reac tions , such as urticaria observed in several adult study 
participants . Given the persistence of MTCT in the high -risk populations we are enrolling 
in the protocol, VRC01 offers a potential for benefit and, based on the available data 
from in vitro studies,  animal studies, and studies of other monoclonal antibodies, appears 
to have an acceptable safety profile . VRC07 -[ADDRESS_1237764] potential for benefit – as thi s group has 
a significant ongoing transmission risk in spi[INVESTIGATOR_884752] – P1112 was opened.  Under Version 1.0, the study did not enroll infants born to 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237765]. In Version 2.0, with evidence of safety, the criteria for risk were 
modified for Dose Group 2 (Dose Group 1 had been fully enro lled), and Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237766] 
successfully completed prior treatment trials requiring enrollment within 48 hours of 
birth of infants born to HIV -infected women who presented a t near or at the time of 
delivery [57]. Conduct of P1112 has documen ted similar success with dosing within the 
protocol -specified timeframe for each dose group.  Dose Group 4  and 5  Cohort s 1 enroll  
at both domestic and African  sites to HIV -exposed non -breastfeeding infants; Cohort s [ADDRESS_1237767] good positive predictive value, especially 
when used in high risk populations. In a meta -analysis of Oraquick ®, a popular rapid 
test, performed on blood samples that was reported recently in Lancet Infectious Diseases  
[58], specificity of the test was 99.91% and the positive predictive value in high 
prevalence populations was 98.5% and in low prevalence populations was 97.7%; 
therefore, we believe it is appropriate to allow sites to enroll women with positive rapid 
tests who are being approached to discuss strategies to reduce mother to child HIV 
transmission. However, in the Manual of Procedures (MOP) , we will request that all sites 
work with their clinical and research labs to identify strategies to obtain confirmatory 
testing as rapi[INVESTIGATOR_884753] e and if that confirmatory testing can be obtained rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375], the 
sites are encouraged to review that test result before enrolling. However, requiring that 
second test result to be documented in all cases before enrollment will make it very 
difficult for the  babies who are most likely to benefit to receive the drug rapi[INVESTIGATOR_375]; at the 
time it is most likely to help.  
 
The women enrolled will likely have challenges with the burden of clinical care and 
study participation. The study sites are experienced in assistin g these women with access 
to care for both themselves and their infants. Further, since the infants are by [CONTACT_884785] , the infants will require very frequent medical evaluation for clinical care alone ; 
therefore, the added burden of study partici pation is relatively small. The sites will be 
required to coordinate research visits with clinical care visits and whenever possible 
facilitate transportation or even complete some study visits in the patient ’s home, if the 
woman finds such home visits to be desirable . Women will be enrolled in the study as 
some of the history data needed to confirm infant eligibility will be gathered from 
maternal medical records (viral load, viral resistance for example) and maternal  serum 
and PBMC will be collected and s tored so  that, if a transmission event occurs, we will be 
able to evaluate maternal virus transmitted and not transmitted with the infant isolate .  
However, women will not receive VRC01 /VRC01LS /VRC07 -523LS .

Consent  
Asking for consent during labor and reconfirmation of consent (and the right to 
withdraw) after labor is not without precedent, nor is it ethically necessarily problematic.  
However, the protocol team and investigators will take further steps (detailed in MOP) to 
bolster participants' ability to give informed consent during a particularly difficult period.  
We will include the following steps:  
1. The MOP will detail when and how women will be approached for consent 
antepartum and postpartum. Women who appear o verly fatigued, in severe pain, 
or too inwardly focused to converse about the details of study participation will 
not be approached during labor.  
2. Gatekeepers including the woman’s primary OB provider and/or family members 
may be approached to ask if it is  appropriate to approach a woman at that time; 
however, as family members may not be aware of the woman’s HIV diagnosis, 
this strategy will only be employed if family members are aware of the diagnosis.   
 
Whenever possible, women will be approached prior to onset of labor . For women who 
cannot be approached prior to labor (for whatever reason), consent will be obtained with 
great care and attention to the woman’s ability to understand and consent. Further, she 
will be provided an opportunity to withdraw co nsent after she delivers the infant and 
before the dose of study medication is administered,  if she chooses. There is a [ADDRESS_1237768] is more likely to work  the sooner it is 
administered after exposure (delivery).   
 
Sites th at intend to conduct home visits in lieu of clinic visits are expected to add detail 
about this to the site -specific informed consents.  
 
Rationale for VRC01 dose selection  in multi -dose groups  
Doses up to 40 mg/kg have been  tested in adults prior to the in itiation of this study.  
Based on data from the adult studies  (as described in “Clinical Studies” ), from 
Palivizumab  and other mAb, IC 50 of tier 2 isolates, and the challenge -protection 
experiments conducted in primates we are projecting VRC01 doses of 20 and 40 mg/kg 
as sufficient to achieve a target trough (day 28) concentration of 50 µg/mL. For the multi -
dose cohort  (Dose Group 3) , we have selected an initial (loading) dose of 40 mg/kg 
followed by [CONTACT_884786] 20mg/kg. Assessment of the PK of the ini tial infants 
receiving 20  mg/kg supports this approach. T he team also considered available data from 
adults (ACTG A5 340; 40/mg/kg IV first dose)  [40]). Figure 3 shows VRC01 
concentrations seen in P1112 infants (20mg/kg SC) and those seen in adults following 
40mg/kg IV. In A5340, the 40mg/kg IV dose was well tolerated and achieved VRC01 
concentrations approximately double those seen thus far in P1112 with the 20mg /kg SC 
dose. Thus, the team expects the Day 28 concentrations from P1112 Dose Group 2 
(40mg/kg SC) to be in the range seen in current adult trials of intravenous VRC01 
(40mg/kg) and, therefore, to the be appropriate starting dose for Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237769] and a safety profile simil ar to VRC01; however, given its 
dramatically improved half -life and preferential concentration at mucosal surfaces, it has 
the potential to improve delivery of the monoclonal antibody. Based on the adult PK data, 
modeling demonstrated that two doses ( at birth and age 3 months) in an infant should 
result in serum levels above target ( 50 µg/mL ) for six months or more. Because VRC01 
and VRC01LS are structurally so similar, the PK and safety data from studies of VRC01 
as well as studies ofVRC01LS (study VRC 606 ) have been considered in determining the 
dose for Dose Group 4. Based on the data available to date, weight -based dosing is 
planned: 80mg SC for infants weighing < 4.5kg at birth; 100  mg SC for infants weighing 
≥ 4.5kg at birth . If the infant is still bre astfeeding at Week 12, a se cond dose will be 
administered.  Figure 4 below shows that, when VRC01LS is administered as a single 
20mg /kg IV dose to healthy adults, avera ge levels at day 84 are approximately > 
180mcg/mL, well above the 30 -day trough target used for VRC01.   
 
Rational e for VRC0 7-523LS dose selection  
VRC07 -523LS demonstrates a shorter half -life than VRC01LS; however, much longer 
than that of VRC01 ( Figure 5). The shorter duration is balanced by [CONTACT_884787]; 
therefore, we anticipate that by [CONTACT_884788]01LS, we 
will have sim ilar ability of serum to neutralize susceptible virus at these later time points.  
Since VRC07 -523LS has greater breadth, then more viruses that the child is potentially 
exposed to should be neutralized.   
 
It should be noted, however, that the dose needed  to prevent infection is unknown, levels 
as low as 1 µg/mL neutralize more than 70% of tier [ADDRESS_1237770] s into la rger clinical trials.   
 
PK modeling, described in more detail in Section 9, demonstrates how the doses selected 
for the present study are anticipated to achieve t arget concentrations.  Briefly, based on 
preliminary adult data and data on VRC01LS PK in infants, modeling projects a median 
day 84 level in infants of 25 mcg/mL, assuming linear PK and no dose effect.  This 
suggests that all infants will achieve or surpa ss our target level of 10 mcg/mL on day 84 
(Figure 6).

Study duration  
The study duration of [ADDRESS_1237772], in other intervention studies in which the infants receive HAART (instead 
of just ZDV monotherapy), detection of a positive HIV DNA or RNA may be delayed.  
While most infected children have an initial positive test result by [ADDRESS_1237773] on time to diagnosis; it may be that first infant 
positive test may not be apparent until weeks after the antibody is gone. In addition, we 

 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 44 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  know that maternal antibodies to HIV may be present in exposed infants for as long as 
15 months and, in t he international setting, it is common to use EIA or rapid antibody 
testing to confirm an infant is HIV negative. It is possible, even likely that some 
antibody will remain and may interfere with the infants’ HIV antibody test s. Therefore, 
to confirm that infants who receive VRC01 become EIA and Western Blot  negative by 
12 months of age and to be certain that any infant infections are detected, the protocol 
team believes that 48 weeks of follow up is important  for the children receiving a single 
dose of VRC 01. If a child remains antibody positive on laboratory testing at 48 weeks, 
he/she will continue every [ADDRESS_1237774] negative on routine HIV antibody testing .  Infants in Dose Group s 3 
(multi -dose) , 4 and 5 will be followed for 96 weeks . 
 
Follow -up of infected infants  
Two recent studies [59, 60] have demonstrated rapid and prolonged viral suppression of 
SHIV in primates after receipt of single or multiple monoclonal antibodies, prompting 
interest in evaluating monoclonal antibodies as a potent ial “cure” strategy. A third study 
demonstrated eradication of SHIV with administration of two antibodies within 24 hours 
of oral inoculation of infant macaques [61]. While the present study is not design ed to 
test this potential, there is a possibility that one or more of the high -risk infants enrolled 
in this s tudy may be HIV -infected either in utero  or intrapartum. Therefore, it will be 
important to describe changes in replicating and integrated virus i n such infants after 
receipt of VRC01. All such infants will receive ARV therapy as part of standard of care 
as determined by [CONTACT_884789] 6.6 and APPENDIX IC :

3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is an open -label, dose -escalating, Phase 1, multicenter study to determine the  safety 
and pharm acokinetic parameters of subcutaneous VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -
523LS , three  potent anti -HIV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.  VRC01 is 
administered in a single dose in 26 HIV -1-exposed infants (between birth and 72 hours of 
life in Dose Groups 1 and 2 and between birth and 5 days of life in Dose Group 3)  and as 
monthly doses in 13 HIV -1-exposed breastfed infants. VRC01LS is administered in a 
single dose in 10 HIV-exposed non -breastfed infants  at risk of infection  between  birth 
and 72 hours of life (Dose Group 4, Cohort 1) and in a single dose in 10 HIV -exposed 
breastfeeding infants between  birth and five days of life  (Dose Group 4, Cohort 2).  A 
second dose  of VRC01LS is given at 12 weeks of life  in Dose Group 4, Cohort 2  if the 
infant has not achieved complete cessation of breastfeeding.  VRC07 -523LS  is similarly 
administered in a single dose in 10 HIV -exposed non -breastfed infants at risk of infection 
between birth and 72 hours of life (Dose Group 5, Cohort 1) and in a single dose in 10 
HIV-exposed breastfeeding infants between birth and five days of life (Dose Group 5, 
Cohort 2). A second dose of VRC07 -523LS  will be given at 12 weeks of life in Dose 
Group 5, Cohort 2 if the infant has not achieved complete cessation of breastfeedin g.   
 
Based on what is currently known about the pharmacokinetics of VRC01, the expectation 
is that this drug will be well tolerated in these infants  and that a  dose of 20 mg/kg will 
meet or exceed the target 28 -day trough of 50 µg/mL in 50% of infants, while 40mg/kg 
will result in 90% of  infants surpassing that trough level.  The percentages of infants who 
meet these criteria will be estimated with considerable uncertainty give n the small sample 
size. Table [ADDRESS_1237776] levels of 50 -100 µg/mL 
at Week 12 . Based on the its shorter half -life in adults, levels of VRC07 -523LS at 12 
weeks in infants in Cohort 5 are expected to be lower than th ose of Cohort 4, in the range 
of 10 -50 µg/mL .

international sites and is open to a population of infants  born to HIV -infected women at 
risk for intrapartum or postpartum HIV transmission. Factors that put the child at 
increased risk for mother -to-child HIV transmission include lack of or late maternal 
antiretroviral (ARV ) drug administration during pregnancy or inadequate antepartum 
ARV drug administration ( see inclusion criteria ), active viral replication near the time of 
delivery, an intrapartum event that might increase risk of transmission such as prolonged 
or prematu re rupture of membranes (PROM)  or exposure to breast milk (for Dose Group 
3 and Cohort 2  of Dose Group s 4 and 5 ). Participation in Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237778] sites  in Africa , where breastfeeding is 
recommended for mothers living with HIV. Specific requirements are listed in 
inclusion/exclusion criteria  (see S ection 4). Mothers may be consented prior to delivery 
or shortly after delivery of their infants, but enrollment  of the  mother -infant pair will not 
proceed until  the infant eligibility criteria have been confirmed . The first dose of the 
study product must be administered less than 72 hours  after birth  to infants in Dose 
Group 1, 2, 4 (Cohort 1)  and 5 (Cohort 1)  and before the end of Day 5 of life for Dose 
Groups 3 , 4 (Cohort 2)  and 5 (Cohort 2) .  
 
The approximate sample size of the study is 79 mother -infant pairs, 13 per Dose Groups  
1, 2 and 3 and 10 per each of the cohorts in Dose Group s 4 and 5 , to assure both that 30 
infants receive  VRC01  and 8 infants per cohort in Dose Group 4 receive VRC01LS  and 8 
infants per cohort in Dose Group 5 receive VRC07 -523LS  and that these infants 
complete:  
• Day 28 evaluations for Dose Groups 1 and 2  and Cohort 1 of Dose Group s 4 and 5  
• Week 24 for Dose Group 3  
• Week 1 6 for Cohort 2 of Dose Group s 4 and 5    
 
The mothers are enrolled as well, but only the infants receive the 
VRC01/VRC01LS /VRC07 -523LS  immunization and are followed on the study .  All 
infants receive prophylactic  ARV treatment per local standard of care , as prescribed by 
[CONTACT_137021] . Mothers are counseled on the importance of  their own adherence to 
antiretroviral therapy for the entire duration of treatment to reduce the risk of mother -to-
child transmission of HIV  and on the importance of their infants rec eiving all standard 
prophylactic ARV regimens . In particular, they are informed that the study drug is not 
known to reduce risk  of transmission .  See Error! Reference source not found.  for an 
overview of the study design.  
 
The t reatment regimen will be the following:  
 
Dose Group  1 
VRC01 (human monoclonal antibody) 20 mg/kg was given by [CONTACT_6567] (SC) 
injection one time t o infants ideally within [ADDRESS_1237779] been 
passed; then  
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 48 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018   
Dose Group 2 
An additional 13 infants were enrolled and receive d a single 40 mg/kg SC dose of the 
same monoclonal antibody ideally within 24 hours but always less th an 72 hours after 
birth.    
 
Dose Group 3  
After six infants in Dose Group 2 completed Day 28 safety assessments and safety 
criteria described in Section 8.5.1  had been passed, Dose Group 3  open ed and enroll ed 
concurrently with the remaining Group 2 participants . The 13 infants in this Dose Group 
receive d 40 mg/kg SC for the initial dose , then  20 mg /kg SC monthly for at least [ADDRESS_1237780] an 
ongoing breastmilk transmission risk.   
 
In all cases, the earlier the treatment is provided, the better; therefore, ideally  enrollment 
would have been completed and study drug administered prior to 24 hours of life. 
However, given the challenges of obtaining informed consent and appropriate screening, 
enrollment and dosing up to 72 hours of life was and will be  allowed  for Dose Groups 1 , 
2, 4 (Cohort 1) , and 5 (Cohort 1)  and through Day 5 of life for Dose Group s 3, 4 (Cohort 
2), and 5 (Cohort 2) . (In all dose groups, i f the dose is not administered within this stated 
window , the child may not receive the dose .)   
 
Under Version  1.0, Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237781] 6 i nfants in Group 2 receive d the 40mg/kg dose , completed Day [ADDRESS_1237782]  completed enrollment . 
We believe d this sequential enrollment would  be safe for the following reasons: 1) in 
adult studies to date, there have been no dose limiting toxicities even up to 40 mg/kg and 
2) all infants will have received the 20 mg/kg dose and will have undergone initial post 
immunization monitoring;  therefore, an y acute severe reactions will have been identified . 
While adults will not have received 40mg/kg via the subcutaneous route, adults have 
received larger SC volumes (2 -3 mL) and repeated doses without significant local 
reactions. In addition, we expect ed that if the SC dosing in the infants were to produce 
reactions not seen in adults, the events would most likely be acute reactions rather t han 
long term ( 28-day events). Finally, in addit ion to an initial review of data  through Week [ADDRESS_1237783] 6 infants t o be enrolled in Dose Group 3 , six-month reviews of all safety data 
from adult and pediatric protocols of VRC01 (from P1112 database and most recent 
safety reports available from the other protocols) commence d after the first infant 
enrolled into Dose Grou p [ADDRESS_1237784] six infants in Dose Group 4, Cohort 1 were  immunized and 
completed 28 days of follow -up, the team review ed all available safety data. There was 
no pause in Dose Group 4, Cohort 1 enrollment or immunization during this review. As 
the review of safety data reveal ed no signal, enrollment into Dose Group 4, Cohort 2 was 
opened .   
 
All 20 (10 per  cohort) of the  infants in Dose Group 4  receive d an initial dose of 
VRC01LS SC at birth  (within 72 hours for Cohort 1; within 5 days of life for Cohort 2).  
Infants in Dose Group 4, Cohort [ADDRESS_1237785] dose within 24 hours or as soon as possible, enrollment will be 
allowed through Day 5 of life. 
 
Dose Group 5 
Upon release of Version 4.0, the protocol team will review interim  safety and PK data 
(accrual data will not need to be reviewed, as Dose Group 4 was fully accrued as of 
February 1, 2018) . If the safety data reveal no signal, Dose Group 5, Cohort [ADDRESS_1237786] been immunized 
and completed  28 days of follow -up, the team will review interim  safety and PK data. 
There will be  no pause in Dose Group 5, Cohort 1 enrollment or immunization during 
this review. If review of safety and PK data reveal s no signal, enrollment into Dose 
Group 5, Cohort 2 will be  opened .   
 
All 20 (10 per cohort) of the infants in Dose Group 5 will receive an initial dose of 
VRC07 -523LS SC at birth (within 72 hours for Cohort 1; within 5 days of life for Cohort 
2). Infants in Dose Group 5, Cohort [ADDRESS_1237787] dose within 24 hours or as soon as possible, enrollment will be 
allowed through Day 5 of life.  
 
The description of the dose groups  is presented in the table that follows , (Table 5).

10 Cohort 1: Non -breastfeeding  
Single dose at birth of VRC07 -523LS to be administered SC; dose is based 
on weight:  
< 4.5 kg: 80 mg  
≥ 4.5 kg: 100 mg  
 
Cohort 2: Breastfeeding  
Initial dose at birth of VRC07 -523LS to be administered SC; dose is based 
on weight:  
< 4.5 kg: 80 mg  
≥ 4.5 kg: [ADDRESS_1237788]  vials of VRC01 are formulated at 100 mg/m L.  Thus, an average 3.5 kg 
infant would  receive a 0.7 mL dose if in the 20 mg/kg dose group or a 1. 4 mL dose if in 
the 40 mg/kg dose group. Doses > 1.0 mL may be administered as 1 or 2 separate 
injections, based on site preference . In Dose Group 4, VRC01LS is administered as an 80 
mg (or 0.8 mL) dose to all infants < 4.[ADDRESS_1237789] 
children. The small number of children with birth weight ≥ 4.5 kg receiv e 100 mg (1.0 
mL).  Modeling suggests that using this dosing approach will achieve target pl asma levels 
in 95% of infants. Infants in Cohort 2 of Dose Group 4 will receive a second dose of 100 
mg at Week 12 if complete cessation of breastfeeding has not be en achieved.   
 
Likewise, in Dose Group 5 , VRC07 -523LS will be administered as an 80 mg (or 0.8 mL) 
dose to all infants < 4.[ADDRESS_1237790] children. The small 
number of children with birth weight ≥ 4.5 kg will receive 100 mg  (1.0 mL).  Modeling 
suggests that using this dosing approach will achieve target plasma levels in 95% of 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 51 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  infants. For VRC07 -523LS, the target level at 12 weeks is 10 µg/mL  or higher in most 
infants ; 5-fold lower than that of VRC01LS. The lower target is a ppropriate considering 
the significant increased potency of the VRC07 -523LS product.  Infants in Cohort 2 of 
Dose Group 5 will receive a second dose of 100 mg at Week 12 if complete cessation of 
breastfeeding has not been achieved.

6 PARTICIPANT  MANAGEMENT  
 
6.1 Toxicity Management  
The DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult  and Pediatric Adverse Events, 
(DAIDS AE Grading Table), Corrected Version 2.1, July [ADDRESS_1237811] be used and is 
available on the R SC website at https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -research -sites/daids -
adverse -event -grading -tables  
 
Management of adverse experiences is done  according to the best clinical practice and the 
judgment of the site invest igator .  Alternate explanations for clinical and laboratory 
abnormalities must be sought .  Laboratory normals will be the institutional values .  However, if 
a site does not have an age -specific normal range/value for a particular lab, the site should use 
the latest edition of the Harriet Lane Handbook for normal ranges/values and document this for 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 60 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  monitoring purposes .  Abnormal clinical and laboratory findings should be followed until 
resolution to < Grade 2 , or no further change expected .   
 
This study inv olves a single or multiple dose(s) of VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  
antibody .  Safety data will be collected and reviewed by [CONTACT_884800] (twice 
a month)  study conference calls.   
 
Sites record and submit CRFs to the Data Management Center on all AEs from the time 
of the initial immunization as follows:  
 
For Dose Group s 4 and 5 (both cohorts), all laboratory events required by [CONTACT_884801]. See the CRF instructions 
for further de tails. For all other events:  
 
• For Grade [ADDRESS_1237812] , and all AEs grade 3 or 
higher  (regardless of their relationship to study product) : CRFs should be submitted 
through  the entire course of study.  
• For all  Grade 1  AEs (other than reactogenicity AEs), and Grade [ADDRESS_1237813] : CRFs should only 
be submitted for these AEs occurring up to 30 days after the single  immunization  for 
Dose Groups 1 and 2 and Dose Group s 4 and 5  (Cohort 1) or 30 days after the final 
immunization for Dose Group 3 and Dose Group s 4 and 5 (Cohort 2) .  After  that, 
sites will  not be required to record/submit these  AEs on CRFs .  Note that sites should 
continue to report – beyond the time periods specified above  – unresolved AEs  that 
began during the reporting period .   
 
The study Data Management Center report  the data described above  on a monthly basis for 
safety monitoring/review by  [CONTACT_876412] P1112  study team .  All infants who receive an 
immunization will be followed for safety assessment for the full length of the study.  
 
6.1.1 Toxicity Management  Multiple Doses - Dose Group s 3, 4 (Cohort 2) , and 5 
(Cohort 2)  
• After Grade 3 toxicities, subsequent doses should not be  administered until after 
consultation with the protocol team AND improvement of the event to < Grade 3.  
After approval by [CONTACT_138292], subsequent doses may be administered .  If the 
event recurs  and is deemed related to study product , no further doses may be 
administered.   
• After Grade 4 toxicities considered not related or probably not related , subsequent 
doses may be administered after improvement to < Grade 3 and consultation with the 
protocol team.  If the event recurs, no further doses may be administered.  
• After any Grade 4  toxicities considered possibly , probably, or definitely related  to 
immunization,  subsequent doses should not be administered.  
Sites should evaluate all AEs to determine if the AE meets criteria for expedited AE 
reporting to DAIDS (Section 7).

enrolled but there is a delay in administering the dose such that the infant is beyond the 
age cutoff, then the study immunization should not be administered and the infant should 
be withdrawn from the study.  If an infant receives the dose after the designated age , it 
will be considered a protocol violation and the site must notify the team by [CONTACT_884802] .  These infants will still be followed for the length of the study (up to 48 
weeks for Dose Groups 1 and 2 and 96 weeks for Dose Group s 3, 4 and 5 ). 
 
If maternal sample #2 testing is negative and the infant has received any VRC01 , 
VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  immunization s, there will be no subsequent immunizations 
and the infant will be followed for safety as part of the study .  If the infant has not 
received the VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  immunization, then the mother and 
infant will be removed from the s tudy.   
 
6.2.1 Dose Group  Management  
Dose Group  1 
Under Version 1.0, Dose Group 1 closed to enrollment on 28 January 2016 after meeting 
full accrual.  
 
Dose Group 2 
On 2 February 2016, upon review of available date and documentation that all infants 
who had reached Day 28 (N=10) had passed the safety criteria, Dose Group  [ADDRESS_1237815]  
been closed early (since assessments on 10 evalu able infants ha d been completed).  
However, as noted above, neither group closed early.  
 
Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237816] P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 62 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  infant enrolled into Dose Group 3 reaches the Week 24  milestone, the protocol team will 
review available safety data from adult and pediatric proto cols of VRC01 (from P1112 
database and safety reviews from other protocols ); there will be no pause in either 
enrollment or administration of VRC01 during this review.  Thereafter, all safety data 
will be reviewed every 6 months .     
 
Dose Group 4  
Upon release of Version 3.0 , the protocol team review ed available safety data from adult 
and pediatric protocols of VRC01 and VRC01LS (from P1112 database and safety 
reviews from other protocols) and Dose Group 3 accrual data.  There was  no safety 
signal , and t he team determined that Dose Group 4 , Cohort 1  could  open to enrollment  
as soon as study documents were  updated per protocol V3.0 and site approvals were  
obtained ; see Error! Reference source not found. . This occurred on [ADDRESS_1237817] six infants in Dose Group 4, Cohort 1 were  immunized and completed 28 
days of follow -up, the team review ed all available safety data. This review of safety data 
reveal ed no signal, and enrollment into Dose Group 4, Cohort 2 was opened  on 7 
December 2017 . 
 
Dose Group 5  
Upon release of Version 4.0, the protocol team will review available interim safety data 
from adult and pediatric protocols of VRC01 , VRC01LS  and VRC07 -523LS (from 
P1112 da tabase and safety reviews from other protocols). If there  is no safety signal, the 
team will determine Dose Group 5, Cohort 1 may open to enrollment as soon as study 
documents are updated per protocol V 4.0 and site approvals are obtained; see Error!

6.4 Criteria for Treatment Discontinuation  
For Dose Group s 1 and 2, who receive d a single dose of VRC01 , there were  no criteria to 
discontinue the treatment  for individual  participants .  For Dose Group 3  and Cohort 2 of 
Dose Group s 4 and 5 , refer to Toxicity Management (Section 6.1.1 ) for criteria for 
treatment  discontinuation .  In addition, treatment discontinuation will occur if an  infant is 
determined to be HIV -infected  before he or she is  12 weeks old  (see Section 6.6). 
 
6.5 Criteria for Study Discontinuation  
• Infant does not receive the first VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  immunization.  
• The mother or legal guardian refuses infant  follow -up evaluations.  
• The investigator determines that further participation would be detrimental to the 
participant ’s health or well -being.  
• The participant  fails to comply with the study requirements so as to cause harm to 
him/herself or seriously interfere with the validity of the study results.  
• The study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_18121] , Office of Human Research Protection 
(OHRP), U.S. Food,  and Drug Adminis tration (FDA), the IMPAACT Network, 
IRB/EC or local government regulatory agency.  
 
6.6 If an Infant is Determined to be  HIV -Infected  
If an infant enrolled in P1112 has a positive HIV -1 NAT result at any time point, sites 
should notify the Protocol Team at impa [EMAIL_16827]  as soon as possible .  
Infants in Dose Group 3 with a positive HIV -1 NAT will not continue to receive VRC01 
and will continue to be followed as per APPENDIX ID: Schedule of Evaluations (Dose 
Group 3)  per the columns “Observation Period: Every 12 weeks after BF Cessation, HIV 
Diagno sis, and/or at Weeks 84 and 96. ”  Likewise, an infant identified as HIV -infected  
before he or she is 12 weeks old  in Dose Group s 4 and 5  Cohort 2  would not receive a 
second dose of VRC01LS  or VRC07 -523LS  and would continu e to be followed per 
APPENDIX  IF: Schedule of Evaluations (Dose Group 4 , Cohort 2: bre astfeeding ) or

used for this study.  
 
The study agent for which expedited reporting is required are: VRC01, VRC01LS , and 
VRC07 -523LS . 
 
In addition to the EAE Reporting Category identified above, other AEs that must be 
reported in an expedited manner are:  immune complex disease.  
 
7.3 Grading Severity of Events  
The Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse 
Events (DAIDS AE Grading Table), Corrected Version 2.1, July [ADDRESS_1237820] P1112  may be found in the MOP.  The DAIDS AE 
Grading Table is available on the RSC website at . https://rsc.niaid.nih.gov/clinical -

7.4 Expedited AE Reporting Period  
The expedited AE reporting period for this study is as per the EAE manual, i.e., from 
enrollment of a trial participant to the end of trial follow -up for that participant . 
 
After the protocol -defined AE reporting period, unless otherwise noted, only S[LOCATION_003]Rs  as 
defined in Version 2.0 of the EAE Manual will be reported to DAIDS if the study staff 
become aware of the events on a passive basis (from publicly available information).   
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237821] a safe 
and PK -acceptable dose to be used in future ef ficacy clinical trials.  
 
The study population is the newborns of HIV -1-infected women, who are ≥ [ADDRESS_1237822] -natal HIV transmission (see 
Section 4.3.5  for definition of increased risk).  The women do not receive study  
immunizations.  After delivery, the mothers and their exposed neonates are checked for 
eligibility (see Section 4 for eligibility requirements for both mother and baby).  If 
eligible, both the mothers and infants are enrolled.  Only the infant is immunized  with a 
subcutaneous injection(s) of VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS .  Only the infants are 
assessed for safety and followed on the study.   
 
The study will enroll 79 infants, with the aim of having approximately 62 evaluable 
infants : 10 of 13 (77%) each in Dose Groups 1 -3 and 8  of 10 (80%) per  cohort  in Dose  
Group s [ADDRESS_1237823] received  the required immunization(s) and 
have completed the required follow -up for the primary safety outcome measure for the 
relevant group ( Day 28  evaluations for Dose Groups 1 and 2 and Cohort 1 in Dose 
Grou ps 4 and 5 ; Week 24 evaluations for Dose Group 3; and Week 16 evaluations for 
Cohort 2 in Dose Group s 4 and 5) .  .   
 
Safety will be monitored in real time throughout the study.  If none of the triggers listed 
in section 8.5.1  are met, the  accrual and immunizations will proceed continuously, with 
no pause, until enrollment in the dose group has been completed.  This will ensure that 
the study will remain open and a ll eligible infants will be enrolled and immunized in a 
timely manner.   
 
If any safety triggers are met, subsequent enrollment and immunizations will be paused 
until the safety data are reviewed by [CONTACT_133011] (SMC) (see 
Section 8.5.1 ) and they will advise the team on how to proceed.   
 
Dose Groups 1 -4 (Protocol Versions 1.0 - 3.0): 
 
1) Initially, only Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237824] 10 infants who received the immunization and 
completed study evaluations.   
 
The infants received a single SC dose of 20 mg/kg of VRC01, as soon as possible after 
birth, and in all cases, less th an [ADDRESS_1237825] 10 infants immunized in Dose Group 1 were evaluated (see Section 8.5.1 ).  After 
these infants had completed 28 days of follow up and had passed the safety criteria

completed, AND the adult cohort using the dose of 40 mg/kg of VRC01 had been fully 
enrolled and all participants in it had completed day 28 evaluation, then  
  
2) Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237826] 10 infants who receive d the immunization and study 
evaluations.  
 
The infants in Dose Group  2 receive d a single SC dose of 40 mg/ kg of VRC01, ideally as 
soon as possible after birth, but in all cases, less than [ADDRESS_1237827] 6 infants immunized in Dose Group 2 were  evaluated (see Section 8.5.1 ), After six

3) Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237828] 10 infants who 
receive d the imm unizations and study evaluations.  
 
The infants in Dose Group 3 receive d a SC dose of 40 mg/kg of VRC01, ideally as soon 
as possible after birth, but in all cases, not later than the 5th day of life, then doses of 20 
mg/kg SC monthly for at least 24 weeks a nd no more than 72 weeks while breastfeeding.  
 
Prior to opening Dose Group 4, all available safety data were  evaluated  (see Section 
8.5.1 ).   
 
4) Dose Group [ADDRESS_1237829] 8 
infants in each cohort who will receive the immunizations and study evaluations . 
Enrollment into the two Dose Group 4 cohorts occurred sequentially (see Error! 
Reference source not found. , Section 3, and Section 6.2.1 ). An additional mother -
infant pair was allowed to enroll because they had completed the screening when accrual 
limit was reached.  
 
Infants in Dose Group 4 receive d a SC dose of VRC01 LS as follows:  
• Cohort 1 (non -breastfeeding): a single dose ideally as soon as possible after birth 
and within the first 72 hours  of life . 
• Cohort 2 (breastfeeding): a single dose ideally as soon as possible after birth, but 
in all cases, not later than the 5th day of life .  A second dose of VRC01 LS was 
administered at Week [ADDRESS_1237830] P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 68 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018

Enrollment into the two Dose Group 5 cohorts will occur sequentially (see Error! 
Reference source not found. , Section 3, and Section 6.2.1 ). 
 
The infants in Dose Group 5 will receive a SC dose of VRC07 -523LS  as follows:  
• Cohort 1 (non -breastfeeding): a single dose ideally as soon as possible after birth 
and within the first 72 hours  of life . 
• Cohort 2 (breastfeeding): a  single dose ideally as soon as possible after birth, but 
in all cases, not later than the 5th day of life.  A second dose of VRC07 -523LS  
will be administered at Week 12 if the infant has not achieved complete cessation 
of breastfeeding.  
 
Serious toxicity is not anticipated.  However, safety will be monitored carefully, given 
that: a) study participants are newborns, b) they are born to women at increased risk for 
intrapartum HIV transmission and c) safety must be assessed before opening new 
cohorts .

• The neutralization sensitivity of the infant and maternal virus  
• The amount of HIV -1 provirus in PBMC and plasma HIV -1 RNA (measured in 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL)  
• Serum neutralizing titer   
 
8.3 Randomization and Stratification  
There will be no randomization or stratification of participants.  
 
8.4 Sample Size and Accrual  
Both mothers and infants are enrolled in the study, but only infants receive the VRC01 , 
VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  immunization(s) and are followed on the study.  The study 
will enroll 79 mother -infant pairs : [ADDRESS_1237832] receive d 
the required study  immun ization(s) and have completed follow -up for the primary safety 
outcome measure ( Day 28 evaluations for Dose Groups 1 , 2 and Cohort 1 from Dose 
Groups 4 and 5; Week 24 evaluations for Dose Group 3 ; and Week  16 evaluations for 
Cohort 2 in Dose Group s 4 and 5).  This assumes a maximum missing data rate of 23% in 
Dose Groups 1 -3 and 20% in Dose Group s [ADDRESS_1237833]  immunization will be replaced.   
 
Safety data will be assessed as described in Section 8.5.1 . If any of the safety criteria are 
triggered, enrollment and further immunizations will be temporarily stopped until the 
SMC reviews the data and advises the pr otocol team on how to proceed. Section 8.5.1  
discusses the error probabilities associated with the safety criteria and Section [IP_ADDRESS]  
discusses the precision that th e sample size will provide for estimating AE rates and PK 
success rates.  The sample size is based on target precision for the estimation of key safety 
and PK parameters. The calculations are located in Section [IP_ADDRESS]  for ease of discussion.   
 
We had anticipated that all participants in Dose Groups [ADDRESS_1237834], enrollment into both dose 
groups was more rapid tha n anticipated: taking less than [ADDRESS_1237835] infant enrolled into Dose Group 3 
reache d the Week 24 milestone, the team began  reviews of availab le safety data of adult 
and pediatric protocols of VRC01 (from P1112 database and most recent safety reports 
available from the other protocols) every [ADDRESS_1237836] is discussed on 
the team calls and the relationship determin ed by [CONTACT_3476], taking into account the 
site and the Medical Officer’s assessment of the event.  Interpretation of VRC01 , 
VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS relationship  to adverse events is based on the type of event, 
the relationship of the event to the time of immunization, the known biology of the 
monoclonal antibody and the investigators’ medical judgment .  Gradation of relationship 
uses the following terminology: “not related ,” “probably not related ,” “possibly related ,” 
“probably related,” or “definitely related.”   
 
In addition to regularly scheduled toxicity reviews by [CONTACT_133047], the study is 
monitored by [CONTACT_884803] (SMC) according to 
IMPAACT Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) on Study Data and Safety Monitoring.  
The committee meet s via conference call to review relevant data as described in the 
sections below.  
 
8.5.[ADDRESS_1237837] the study participants 
from unnecessary exposure to the monoclo nal antibody, should the safety profile prove 
unacceptable in this population.  The evaluation of safety for the purpose of applying 
these guidelines will be based on data : 
• through the first 28 days after immunization for Dose Groups 1, 2, and Cohort 1 
of Dose Groups 4 and 5;  
• on data through the first [ADDRESS_1237838] received more 
immunizations than Dose Groups 1 and 2;    
• on data through the first 28 days after the second immunization in Dose Group s 4 
and 5 , Cohort 2 (Week 16).  
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.[ADDRESS_1237839] four to five weeks of 
life, especially during breastfeeding, and that Grade 3 neutropenia and anemia are 
common in in fants on ARVs, these toxicities will not be counted in the safety evaluation 
algorithm presented below.  
  
NOTE: If at any time during the study the triggers below are met, the study will be 
paused for evaluation, as described below and an SMC review perfor med within [ADDRESS_1237840] 6 infants immunized and 
followed through Week 8.  The early safety of the multiple -dose regimen of VRC01LS in 
Dose Group 4 (Cohort 2) and of VRC07 -523LS  in Dose Group 5 (Cohort 2) will be 
assessed based on data from the first [ADDRESS_1237841] reached 28 days after the second 
dose (Week 16).  
 
• If any of the infants dies or has a life -threatening adverse event or any Grade 4 event 
that is possibly, probably or definitely attributable to the VRC01 , VRC01LS , or 
VRC07 -523L S immunization, or  
• If two or more of the six infants have a Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1237842] possibly 
related to the VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523L S immunization (excluding Grade 
3 neutropenia and anemia , and hyperbilirubinemia ), then future enrollment and 
immunizations will be stopped.   
 
If these triggers are met, the team will confer with the SMC, which will judge whether 
enrollment and immunizations can be continued.  Note: for deaths and grade [ADDRESS_1237843] occur within 7 days of the team’s awareness of the event.  
 
If the ongoing monitoring process reveals that a dose group has already f ailed the safety  
criteria, then further enrollment and immunizations will be suspended, and an SMC 
review will be performed immediately (within seven days).  
 
If the SMC decides that further enrollment and immunizations cannot be continued, the 
study will s top accrual but continue safety follow -up of all enrolled infants.  
 
Subsequent to the initial safety evaluation of each dose group, if the toxicity among the 
additional infants who have been immunized while waiting for the first 6 to reach the 
evaluation t ime point would increase the rate of Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1237844] 
possibly related to the VRC01 VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  immunization (excluding 
 
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 72 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  Grade 3 neutropenia and anemia) to over 30%,  then future enrollment and immunizations 
will be paused.  For example, if only one of the first 6 infants enrolled had a Grade ≥ [ADDRESS_1237845] a Grade  ≥ [ADDRESS_1237846] possibly related to the VRC01 , VRC01LS , 
or VRC07 -523LS  immunization , this would represent a 37.5% (3/8) rate of such events, 
and because this is higher than 30%, the study will be paused for safety.  The team will 
confer with th e SMC, which will judge whether enrollment and immunizations can 
continue.  
 
Given the relatively small sample size, the information available for preliminary safety 
decisions will be imperfect.  Two types of sampling errors are possible:  
 
1) In a group where  the true rate of toxicity is too high to warrant increased exposure to 
the current VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  dose, the sample data may pass the 
safety guidelines;  
2) In a group where the true rate of toxicity is low enough that further exposure to the 
current VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  dose is warranted, the sample data may 
fail the guidelines.    
 
The extent to which the safety guidelines protect against the errors described above can 
be assessed by [CONTACT_50796] "true tox icity" which could occur, 
if the study medication were used extensively among the participant population at the 
dose levels under question.  The hypothetical situations presented in Table [ADDRESS_1237847] P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 73 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  Table 6: Probability of Meeting Safety Review Trigger Under Potential Rates of 
True Toxicity (N=6)  
 
For example, Table 6 shows that there is a 94% chance of failing the safety guidelines 
under conditions in which the true rate of life -threatening toxicity is 5% and the rate of 
non-life-threatening toxicity is 50%.  Assuming that a dosing regimen associated with 
this extent of severe toxicity would be unacceptable, the 6% chance of passing the safety 
criteria under these conditions would represent sampling error.  Not e that the true rate of 
Grade [ADDRESS_1237848] registered, the team will assess accrual on a quarter ly True Toxicity Rates

team will identify problems in accrual and possibly amend the protocol accordingly.  
 
A full monitoring plan was developed before the study opened to accrual.  
8.6 Analyses  
 
8.6.1 Primary Analysis  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Safety  
 
Each participant’s safety data will be summarized as: the worst grade of adverse event 
experienced during the time period of observation for primary objectives  and the worst 
grade of adverse event judged to be at least possibly related  to the immunization(s) 
during the same time interval .  Descriptive analyses will consist of frequency 
distributions of these safety outcomes, broken down by [CONTACT_7169] /Cohort .  All available 
safety data will be used.  All infants who receive a n initial  VRC01 , VRC01LS , or 
VRC07 -523LS  immunization will be included in all analys es regardless of whether they 
receive  ARV prophylaxis or are HIV -infected.   
 
With the small sample size used in this study, there will be insufficient statistical power 
for a formal test of difference s between  dose groups with respect to safety.  With 
insufficient power, a finding of no significant difference would not provide acceptable 
evidence of no adver se dose effect.  Thus, estimates of Grade 3 or higher toxicity rates 
will be computed separately for each dose group  and bounded by 90% confidence 
intervals (CI), reflecting the precision of the estimates.  This will provide 95% assurance 
that the true rat e of severe adverse events is not higher than the upper limits of the CI 
around the proportion of participants with grade [ADDRESS_1237850] methods.    
[IP_ADDRESS]  Precision of Estimates  
 
The following table  (Table 7) illustrates the confidence intervals for a range of 
hypothetical proport ions of adverse events.  This table shows that a sample finding of no 
grade 3 or higher adverse events in a total sample of 10 participants would provide 95% 
confidence that the probability  in the population from which the sample was drawn is no 
greater th an 26%.

The proportions of infants in each dose group with adequate  PK levels  (see Section 9 for 
definition) and other PK results will be presen ted in a separate PK report,  
The table below ( Table 8) presents exact 90% confidence intervals around various 
potential rates of PK success which might be observed in a total sample of 10 
participants.  This table shows that a sample  finding of PK success in 6 of 10 participants 
would provide 95% confidence that the rate in the population from which the sample was 
drawn is no lower than 30%.

Should this occur, the number of infants in each dose group  who become HIV -infected 
will be reported.  The immunization is not expected to increase the rate of HIV infection.  
However, since these infants are born to women at increased risk of intrapartum HIV 
transmission, it is possible that a sm all percentage mi ght become HIV -infected, and any 
infections will be brought to the attention of the SMC.

The VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  antibody levels in oral secretions will be 
summarized  at each time point by [CONTACT_147572] 95% CI around the mean or median, 
depending on whether the data are normally distributed.  
 
Exploratory analyses will be performed in the infants who are determined to be HIV -
infected.  The neutralization sensitivity of the infant and maternal virus will be 
documented descriptively.  In addition, the changes from baseline to subsequent time 
points in the amount of HIV provirus in PBMC and plasma HIV -1 RNA (measured in 
copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL) over time will be presented.  HIV serum neutralization titer before and after 
the study immunization will be compared.

second dose and additional samples will be collected at Week s 14 and 16.  
 
Assay Site : Plasma pharmacokinetic samples collected will be sent  per the study -specific 
Laboratory Processing Chart  (LPC) and will be assayed for serum/plasma concentration 
of VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS .  
 
Methods to be used : All assay methods will be standardized with a filed Methods Report, 
under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) conditions .  The assay s will be performed using 
immune based method.  
Reporting of Assay Data : At a minimum, a ssays will be conducted in batch a fter receipt 
of all  samples through Week [ADDRESS_1237854] six participants are enrolled.  The designated lab  will ru n the 
assays for VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  levels  once per week as the trial 
begins and anti -drug antibody assays once per month .  All PK samples will be registered 
in the Lab Data Management System (LDMS) database .   
For the purposes of reporting in itial PK results to clinicaltrials.gov, the AUC 0- and 
concentration at the end of the first dose interval, C time will be provided.  For Dose 
Groups 1 -3 these are C D and AUC 0-28D while for Dose Groups 4 and 5 they are C D 
and AUC 0-84D. 
 
9.3 Study Design, Modeling and Data Analysis  
Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected as noted in Section 9.2 and Schedule 
of Evaluation Appendices : APPENDIX IB : Infant Schedule of Evaluations  (Dose 
Groups 1 and 2) , APPENDIX ID: Schedule of Evaluations (Dose Group 3) , 
APPENDIX  IE: Schedule of Evaluations (Dose Group 4 , Cohort 1: non -breastfeeding)  
APPENDIX  IF: Schedule of Evaluations (Dose Group 4 , Cohort 2: bre astfeeding ), 
APPENDIX  IG: Schedule of Evaluations (Dose Group 5 , Cohort 1: non -breastfeeding)  
and APPENDIX  IH: Schedule of Evaluations (Dose Group 5, Cohort 2: breastfeeding) . 
The samples will be 1 -2 mL whole blood to yield 0.4 -1.0 mL plasma.  Sample volume 
will be dependent on  infant weight (See  APPENDIX IB : Infant Schedule of Evaluations  
(Dose Groups 1 and 2) ). 
 
VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  concentrations will be presented by [CONTACT_53813] , 
dose group and dose number.  The frequency of achieving Day [ADDRESS_1237855] P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 79 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  than 50 µg/mL will be calculated.  For Dose Group 4, the frequency of maintaining 
VRC01LS concentrations > 50 g/mL at Week 12 will be determined ; likewise, for Dose 
Grou p 5, the frequency of maintaining VRC0 7-523LS concentrations > 15 g/mL at 
Week [ADDRESS_1237856] similar variability as those seen in infants with 
RSV monoclonal antibodies by [CONTACT_453913] [50]; CV=34% for apparent clearance 
(CL/F) and CV=33% for apparent volume (Vd/F).  With 10 completed participants 
planned from each dose group, it is expected that the 95% CIs for primary PK parameters 
for each dose group will be encompass a range o f less than + 25% of the point estimate 
values.   
 
While it is expected that the CL/F for VRC01LS will be substantially lower than for 
VRC01, we expect the overall variability (CV) for PK parameters to be similar.  Thus, 
the proposed study will generate a similar confidence interval in the VRC01LS 
pharmacokinetic parameters.  Recent findings from VRC605 found the CV for VRC07 -
523LS AUC to be < 25% for dosing groups receiving between 5 -40 mg/kg and including 
following subcutaneous administration  [62].  Based on these low variability values , the 
expected 95% CI will be tighter than those originally predicted for VRC01 based on RSV 
variability.  
 
The observed VRC01 , VRC01LS and VRC07 -523LS concentrations will be compared to 
those seen in adults.  Specifically, the geometric mean and 90% confide nce interval for 
the Day 28 (VRC01) and Week 12 (VRC01LS  and VRC07 -523LS ) concentrations will 
be generated.  Based on RSV mAb pharmacokinetics in infants, it is expected that 
VRC01 Day 28 concentrations will fall within the range of 20 -70 g/mL for the 20m g/kg 
dose (Dose Group 1) and 65 -115 g/mL for the 40mg/kg dose (Dose Group 2).  The 
predicted Week 12 VRC01LS  and VRC07 -523LS  concentrations following 80-100mg 
SC are expected to be between 40 -120 g/mL  and 15 -40 g/mL, respectively .  These are  
lower than the predicted levels in adults at Week 12 in part due to a "diluting" effect from 
the large increase in body weight expected in the infants during the first 12 weeks of life.

Individual Participant  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
 
A non -compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed using WinNonlin or a 
similar program on the VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  concentration data 
generated from each participant in Groups 1 , 2, 4, and 5.  Calculated pharmacokinetic 
parameters will include: area -under -the-curve (AUC), maximum concentration (C max), 
time to C max (Tmax), apparent clearance (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution ( Vdz/F) 
and terminal elimination rate constant ( z) and the terminal half -life.  C max and T max will 
be taken directly from the observed concentration -time data.  The terminal slope, z, will 
be determined from log - linear portion of the curve and the half -life (T 1/2) calculated as 
0.693/z. AUC 0-last will be determined using the linear trapezoidal method.  If the final 
sample s have measurable VRC01 , VRC01LS , or VRC07 -523LS  concentrations, the 
remaining AUC after the final concentration will be estimated as C last/z.  For the 
purposes of determining Vdz/F, it will be calculated as the ratio of (CL/F) / z.  Data will 
be summarized based by [CONTACT_884804]/F, Vd z/F and T 1/2.  The 
potential for non -linearity pharmacokinetics between Dose Groups 1 and 2 will be 
determined by [CONTACT_128179]-adjusted ratios for C max and AUC between study dose 
groups.  Additional compartmental analysis will be performed as warranted by [CONTACT_884805] 1, 2 , 4, and 5 .  For Dose Group 3, no intensive PK data is being 
collected; thus, the individual  participant specific pharmacokinetic analysis will be 
limited to estimation of potential accumulation or decline in pre -dose concentrations with 
repeated dosing.  For these calculations, the Day 28 pre -dose VRC01 concentration will 
serve as the reference with the pre -dose concentrations collected at later weeks divided 
by [CONTACT_48657] 28 pre -dose VRC01 concentration.  Both raw and dose adjusted (to 20mg /kg) 
concentration ratios will be calculated.   
 
Interim Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
 
Incremental pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed as data from Dose Groups [ADDRESS_1237858] order absorption model will be assessed to 
determine the structural pharmacokine tic model.  Additional drug absorption models will 
be evaluated if dictated by [CONTACT_26739].  The population analysis will generate estimates for 
initial and final apparent volumes of distribution (V1/F and V2/F), inter -compartmental 
clearance (Q/F), CL/F and absorption rate p arameters either KA or the zero -order rate 
constant (R1).  Given the small participant  numbers, the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis will not include an exploratory covariate analysis to assess clinical factors as 
fixed effects associat ed with VRC01 pharmacokinetic parameters with the exception of 
dose level (20mg/kg vs 40mg/kg) and repeat dosing as fixed effect s on F, KA/R1, CL and 
V1/V2.   
 
This population analysis will be used to quantify the unexplained between participant  
pharmacoki netic variability.  Final model selection will be based on changes in the 
objective function and graphically by [CONTACT_52631].  The final population model 
parameters will be assessed using bootstrappi[INVESTIGATOR_884755] 95% CIs for parameter 
estimates a nd by [CONTACT_884806] .  Post-hoc empi[INVESTIGATOR_884756] ’s pharmacokinetic parameters will be generated.  The population 
parameters and their variability will be used as the input model to assess different dos ing 
strategies .  Each VRC01 dosing strategy and its ability to achieve and maintain of target 
VRC01 concentrations will be performed using the final population pharmacokinetic 
model and Monte Carlo simulations with at least [ADDRESS_1237859] P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 83 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018   
9.4 Anticipated Outcomes  
VRC0 1 exposure (Day 28 concentrations) will be consistently above 50 mcg/mL for 
40mg/kg but a significant portion of participant s receiving 20mg/kg will have Day  28 
concentrations < 50 mcg/mL (Figure 8).  In Group 3, there will be modest accumulation 
from Day 28 (pre -dose) concentration to later pre -dose concentrations following repeat 
monthly dosing of 20mg/kg.  Accordingly , the ratio of pre -dose (repeat dosing)/pre -dose 
(Day 28) will likely be between [ADDRESS_1237860] 
majority of participants will maintain VRC01LS concentrations above 50 g/mL for at 
least 12 weeks , while Dose Group 5 concentrations will maintain VRC07 -523LS 
concentrations above 15 mg/mL for [ADDRESS_1237861] subjects.

1. Screening evaluations should be completed as soon as possible after birth .  The laboratory testing needed for inclusion/exclusion (CBC, ALT) 
must be completed and eligibility confirmed in time so that the VRC01 is administered at less than 72 hours after birth.   
2. The Entry/Day [ADDRESS_1237888] on the same day as the Screening Visit.  Blood for the  Entry/Day [ADDRESS_1237889] be drawn before the VRC01 immunization is administered.   
3. Hours (hr) after dose administration.   
4. Window permits visit to be done only 3 days after (not before) Day 14 and 28, and only 2 w eeks after Week 16 (not before) to assure the 
timing of HIV testing meets criteria for presumptive exclusion of infant HIV infection.  
5. An Early Discontinuation visit should be scheduled if participant comes off study after Day 14 and prior to Week 48.  
6. A complete history is required at birth  and includes date of birth, Race, ethnicity, gender, maternal risk factor meeting the inclusion criteria, all 
diagnoses, all signs and symptoms, all antiretroviral medications  (ARV)  with start a nd stop dates and doses, all injected medications (i.e. 
vitamin K, Hepatitis B vaccine) including location of injection.  A t subsequent visits the history should include ARV  doses with start and stop 
dates , other medications, diagnoses, signs and symptoms,  and vaccinations .  Results of HIV -[ADDRESS_1237890] be administered less than 72 hours after birth  (see MOP for administration instructions).

2. Infants will also be evaluated for local reactions and pain 1 hour (+/ - 30 minutes)  after the injection and results recorded on a study CRF . 
9. Hematology should include CBC with diff erential and platelet count .  (Not required at screening if collected clinically at birth and results are 
available).  
10. Chemistries should include AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and creatinine .  (Not required at screening if collected clinically  at birth and  ALT  
results are available).  
11. HIV-1 NAT (nucleic acid testing) by a method that detects DNA is required for diagnostic testing since VRC01 might suppress HIV -[ADDRESS_1237892] be run at a VQA -certified laboratory.   If the infant has a positive HIV -1 NAT at any time, confirmation and additional 
samples should be obtained as per APPENDIX IC : HIV-1 Infected Infant Schedule of Evaluations  (all dose groups)1; infant follow up 
on study should also continue to be as per APPENDIX IB : Infant Schedule of Evaluations  (Dose Groups 1 and 2) .  When possible 
APPENDIX IC : HIV-1 Infected Infant Schedule of Evaluations  (all dose groups)1 visits should be scheduled to coincide with 
APPENDIX IB : Infant Schedule of Evaluations  (Dose Groups 1 and 2) .  
12. Blood for HIV -[ADDRESS_1237893] be obtained prior to 48 hours of life AND prior to VRC01 administration.  It may be drawn 
with the Entry blood.  Results may be pending at  study entry.  If an HIV-1 NAT (DNA or RNA or combined) was collected clinically prior to 
  
IMPAACT P1112 V ersion  4.0 Page 93 of 144 06 Nov ember 2018  48 hours of life  and tested in a laboratory with CLIA approval (U.S. sites) or VQA approval (Non -U.S. sites), the test does not need to be 
duplicated for the study ; in this case, results will be abstracted for the study.  
13. Lymphocyte subsets include CD3/CD4/CD8 counts and percentages .  Results are not needed for study entry.  Draw with CBC .  Must be 
performed at CLIA -certified (or equivalent) laboratory.

volume at Day [ADDRESS_1237894] SOP .  See LPC for collection procedure, processing, 
storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931] . 
15. PBMC from the VRC01 plasma level sample  will be isolated  if site is capable of  PBMC storage .  PBMC will be  used for HIV characterization  
if there are infants with HIV infection.  Leftover PBMC will be stored per the LPC  for future HIV -related studies (possibly including genetic 
testing) per IMPAACT SOP .  See LPC for collection procedure, processi ng, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931] . 
16. Samples for VRC01 serum to be obtained prior to VRC01 administration .  Serum for VRC01 antibody levels  and neutralization assays  will be 
processed and batch shipped per the LPC .  Leftover serum will be stored per the  LPC for future HIV -related studies per IMPAACT SOP .  See 
LPC for collection procedure, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931] .  
17. For infants with birth weight <2.8kg: do not collect VRC01 serum samples  at Entry , Day 14, Day 28, or Week 8.   
18. Assay w ill be performed with plasma from VRC01 plasma level sample.    
19. Oral fluid is collected with Weck-cel Sponge  oral fluid collection device.  Sample at Entry should be collected prior to VRC01 administration 
as baseline.  Assay will be performed to detect VRC01 antibody level sample .  Leftover oral fluid will be stored per the LPC  for future HIV -
related studies per IMPAACT SOP .  See LPC for collection procedure, processing, storage, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_3931].  
20. For infants with birth weight <2.8kg lower sampl e volume will be collected .  See also Footnotes 1 2 and 17 .  Volumes equate to < 3ml/kg 
drawn within 24 hours and < 9.0 ml/kg drawn over 8 weeks.  These are below the NIH Clinical Center guidelines allowing a maxi mum of 
5ml/kg within 24 hours and 9.5ml/kg d rawn over an 8 -week period.    
21. HIV antibody t esting will be performed at Week 48.  I f the infant remains antibody positive, he/she will remain on study for repeat antibody 
testing every [ADDRESS_1237895] measurement upon evidence of h epatic -related clinical adverse events (jaundice, enlargement of the liver).

INTRODUCTION  
 
You and your baby [CONTACT_884810] (HIV) and there is an increased risk 
that the infection may be passed onto your baby [CONTACT_309115][INVESTIGATOR_884759] (medications against HIV).  You are being asked to allow your 
baby [CONTACT_884811] 72 hours after he/she is 
born that may protect against HIV transmission.  This study is sponsored by [CONTACT_66121] (NIH) which has been developi[INVESTIGATOR_884760].  
The doctor in charge of this study is [insert name] .  Before you decide whether you want 
your baby [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a part of this study, we want you to know about the study.  
 
This is a consent form.  It gives you information about this study.  The study staff will 
talk with you about this information.  You are free  to ask questions about this study at 
any time.  If you agree to allow you and your baby [CONTACT_678720], you will be 
asked to sign this consent form.  You will get a copy to keep.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The transfer of HIV to newborn b abies from HIV -infected mothers can occur at the time 
of birth.  You have been identified as a mother who may be at increased risk of passing 
the infection onto your baby.  Your baby [CONTACT_884812] g anti -HIV medications earlier in the pregnancy, or HIV can 
be measured in your blood, or you have had a prolonged rupture of membranes (greater 
than 12 hours) or the HIV virus that is in you is resistant to many of the anti -HIV 
medications available.  Thi s research is being done to help find a safe and effective 
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.[ADDRESS_1237973] certain diseases.  
 
The experimental study immuniz ations are monoclonal antibodies (mAb).  Antibodies are 
one of the ways the human body fights infection.  “Monoclonal” means that all the 
antibodies in the immunization are the same.  This type of immunization is temporary 
because the antibodies will go aw ay over time. There are three  very similar 
immunizations being used in this study.  The first two immunization s are called 
“VRC01 ” and  “VRC01LS. ”  The immunization your baby  [CONTACT_884813] 
“VRC07 -523LS .” The formal name [CONTACT_832] “VRC -HIVMAB075 -00-AB.”  In this consent 
document, and in scientific publications, this antibody is called “ VRC07 -523LS ”  
 
The VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  immunizations are human antibody that may 
be able to block HIV from infecting the baby.  VRC01 was originally discover ed in an 
HIV-infected person, but the immunization is not obtained by [CONTACT_128190] a person.  
All of these  immunizations are made using the same controlled, clean conditions used for 
making medications.  They  were developed by [CONTACT_84665] (NIH).   
 
The VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  have been shown to attach to and inactivate 
many HIV viruses in laboratory experiments.  VRC01 has been tested in adults and 
babies to look at safety and to see what dose (how much) produces the desir ed blood 
levels of antibodies.  VRC01 LS and VRC07 -523LS  have been tested in the laboratory 
and in adults.  VRC01 LS has also been given to  babies . We are using information from all 
of these studies to help us choose the correct dose of VRC07 -523LS  for babies.   
 
In this study, babies will receive a single dose of the VRC07 -523LS  immunization and 
will be followed for safety and have blood collected to measure the levels of VRC07 -
523LS  in the baby’s blood.  Another group of babies, who are breastfeed ing, will receive  
either one or  two doses of the VRC07 -523LS . 
 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO BE IN THE STUDY?  
 
If you decide that you want to be in the study, we will check to make sure you are able to 
enroll in this study.   
 
Screening to see if you can be in the study  
• We will ask for your permission to review your medical records to see if you have 
been diagnosed with HIV according to the study criteria.  If we do not find 
information about your HIV infection in your medical record, we  will collect a 5 mL 
(1 teaspoon ) sample of your blood to determine if you have HIV. We will also review 
the records for other illnesses that you may have had and that might have an impact 
on your baby’s health.  
• We will ask you questions about other studies you might have been in , and health 
conditions and treatments you might have received.  If your baby [CONTACT_884814], then you and your baby [CONTACT_884815] . 
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.0  Page 116 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  • The review of your medical history and the interview with you may be do ne while 
you are still pregnant or shortly after you deliver your baby.   If it is done while you 
are still pregnant you will also be asked some questions after your baby’s birth.  
• If you are able to be in the study, then we will check to make sure that your  baby [CONTACT_884816].  
 
Entry Visit or Day 0  
• If we have not already done so, we will ask for your permission to review your 
medical records to see if you have been diagnosed with HIV according to the study 
criteria.  We will also review the records for  other illnesses you may have had and 
that might have an impact on your baby’s health.  
• We will ask you questions about other studies you might have been in, and health 
conditions and treatments you might have received.  
• We will collect a 20  - 25 mL (1 and ½ tablespoon) sample of your blood.  Some of 
this blood will be used to determine if you have HIV (if it is not clear in your medical 
record) ..  The rest of the blood will be stored for future use.  The results of these tests 
will be used for research purposes only and will not be reported to you or your doctor.  
• Please note that the screening and entry visit maybe combined on the same day.  
 
WHAT DOES MY BABY [CONTACT_884817]/SHE IS IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you allow your baby [CONTACT_371715], your baby [CONTACT_884818] a one -time dose of the 
VRC07 -523LS  immunization within the first 72 hours of his/her life.  The dose of the 
immunization is based on your baby’s weight.  Depending on the dose of the 
immunization, the immunization will be given in either  one or two injections into the skin 
of the upper leg(s).  He/she will then be followed on the study for two years.  
 
All babies who are enrolled and immunized on the study will be seen and evaluated 
several times throughout a two -year study period.  If at any time  during this period, the 
safety assessments show that the immunization maybe unsafe, no new babies will be 
immunized and the babies already on the study will continue to have follow -up 
evaluations until the end of the two -year period.  
 
Study visits for you r baby  
[CONTACT_884819], there 
are 16 study visits.  If your baby [CONTACT_884820] -infected during the study, he/she will 
return for visits through Week 96; the number of visits will depend  on the age of your 
baby [CONTACT_884821].  If your baby [CONTACT_202043] 2. [ADDRESS_1237974] less blood than if your baby [CONTACT_884822].  If this applies to 
your child, the study doctor or nurse will inform you.  
 
[Sites that intend to conduct home visits should include detail throughout this section on 
the time study time points when home visits may be done in lieu of a clinic visit.]  
 
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.[ADDRESS_1237975] about 1 -2 hours.  At this visit, we 
will: 
• Ask if you are willing for your baby [CONTACT_884823].  
• Ask about  your baby’s medical history, which will include how your baby [CONTACT_884824], if he/she has been sick, conditions he/she may have and any 
medicines he/she has been taking.  This will also include your permission to 
review your baby’s medical records to ch eck for medical conditions and any 
treatment your baby [CONTACT_884825].  
• Collect some demographic data such as race, ethnicity and gender.  
• Do a physical examination that may include length, weight, head measurement 
and vital signs such as temperature, bl ood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_862] (how fast the baby [CONTACT_884826]).  
• Draw blood from either a vein (called a venipuncture) and/or from your baby’s 
heel (called a heel stick).  We will test your baby [CONTACT_884827]’s standard of care (the care your baby [CONTACT_884828]).  In addition, routine blood tests will be done to tell us 
well your baby’s liver and kidneys are working: again, these tests will only be 
performed for the study if the y were not already collected for your baby’s 
medical care.   The total amount of blood drawn at this visit will be 2-3 mL 
(about half a teaspoon).   
• In addition, study staff may contact [CONTACT_371721]’s doctor (if you have one) to 
inform the doctor about this s tudy.  
 
Entry Visit or Day 0  
If your baby [CONTACT_884829], Day 0 is the day that he/she receives the VRC07 -
523LS  immunization .  Because the immunization must be given to the baby [INVESTIGATOR_874] 72 
hours of his/her birth, the entry day or Day [ADDRESS_1237976] for a minimum of 4 hours.  
• If the entry day is on a different day than the screening day, we will ask about 
any medical history since the screening visit and will also do a physical exam.   
• In addi tion to the blood tests for screening , we will draw 2 -3 mL ( about a half 
teaspoon) of blood to measure a baseline of VRC07 -523LS  levels and anti -
VRC07 -523LS antibody levels to compare results at your baby’s next visit.  This 
will be drawn before your baby [CONTACT_884830]07 -523LS  injection.  If the 
screening visit and entry (or Day 0) visit are done on the same day, then we may 
draw all the blood, a total of 6-7 mL (about 1½ teaspoon) all at the same time.  
Some of this blood may be stored for future use.   
• We will also collect about 1 mL (¼ teaspoon) of saliva from your baby’s mouth 
by [CONTACT_1299] a small pad (about the size of a thumbnail attached to stick) between 
the gum and c heek of your baby.  After a minute or two we will remove the pad 
and put it in a container.  The pad will be tested to measure the amount of 
VRC07 -523LS  in your baby’s saliva.  
• Depending on your baby’s weight,  your baby [CONTACT_884831]07 -523LS  in the skin of the upper leg.  After your baby [CONTACT_884832] P1112 Version 4.[ADDRESS_1237977] four hours so that we can 
check the immunization injection site and to make sure that he/she is well.

Results of Tests  
Throughout the study, you will be informed of the results of the HIV testing and routine 
blood tests when they become available.  The results of the other blood tests and the 
results of the saliva testing will be used for research purposes only.  These res ults will not 
be reported to you or your doctor.   
 
Storage of Blood Samples   
Some of your and your baby’s blood and saliva  will be stored (with protectors of identity) 
and used for future IMPAACT -approved, HIV -related research.  Your baby [CONTACT_884847]/her blood 
stored for later testing.  
 
Your/your baby’s samples will be shipped to and stored at a special laboratory facility in 
the [LOCATION_002].  Only approved researchers will have access to them.  People who 
work at the facility will also have access to your/your child’s samples to keep track of 
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.0  Page 121 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  them.  These people won’t have information that directly identifies you/your child.  
Your/your baby’s samples will not be sold or directly used to produce commercial 
products.  All proposed research studies using your/your baby’s samples will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_475783] (NIH).  There is no time limit on how 
long your/your baby’s samples will be stored.  
 
The researchers do not plan to contact [CONTACT_884848]’s regular doctor with the results 
of studies done using your/your baby’s stored samples.  This is because research studies 
are often done with experimental procedures.  The results of such studies should  not be 
used to make decisions about your/your child’s medical care.  If the researchers decide 
that the result of a certain study provides important information for your/your baby’s 
medical care, your/your baby’s study doctor will be notified.  If you wou ld like to be

You may decide that you do not want your/your baby’s samples stored for future research 
studies.  You/your baby [CONTACT_884850].   
 
You may withdraw your consent for the storage and use of your/your baby’s samples at 
any time.  If you withdraw your consent, these stored samples will be destroyed.  
 
There are two types of testing that can be done with the specimens that are in storage.  
Please read the following statements carefully and then mark your initials and date in the 
appropriate space provided.  
 
1. Testing for General HIV -related studies  
 
Resea rchers would like to store your/your baby ’s specimens to understand how HIV 
causes disease and complications, and how best to treat or prevent HIV infection and its 
complications.  They need specimens from people who have HIV and from those who do 
not.  So metimes, too, the specimens can be used to learn something about new problems 
that people with HIV have like liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease.  These general 
studies would not include any genetic testing (looking at what makes up you/your child’s  
cells).  
 
Benefits:   There are no direct benefits to you/your baby.  You/Your baby [CONTACT_884851][INVESTIGATOR_884761].  
 
Risks: The specimens would be collected as part of you/your baby ’s study visits.  
Blood collection can cause bruising, pain and infrequently fainting or 
lightheadedness.  Once in storage, there are few risks.  You/your baby ’s name [CONTACT_884898].

2. Testing for Special HIV -related studies  
 
Researchers in this study would also like to store your/your baby’s specimens to 
understand how HIV c auses disease and complications, and how best to treat or prevent 
HIV infection and its complications through looking at how each person’s genetic 
makeup (you/your baby’s DNA or unique cell makeup) either protects them or puts them 
at greater risk.  It may  be that researchers use some of your/your baby’s blood to make a 
“cell line.”  That means the blood cells can keep dividing and give an endless supply of 
you/your baby’s DNA for tests to be done in the future.  This kind of information will be 
particularl y important as scientists work toward a vaccine that could protect people from 
AIDS.  They need specimens from people who have HIV and from those who do not.  
 
Benefits:   There are no direct benefits to you/your baby.  You/your baby [CONTACT_884851][INVESTIGATOR_884762].

IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.0  Page 123 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
About 39 mothers and t heir babies will be part of the VRC01 portion of this study.  
About 20 mothers and their babies will be part of the VRC01LS portion of this study.  
About 20 mothers and their babies will be part of the VRC07 -523LS  portion of this 
study.  
 
HOW LONG WILL I/MY CHILD/BABY [CONTACT_371729]?  
 
You will only be in the study for as long as it takes to screen you and determine that you 
are eligible for the study (about one day) and have your blood collected.  Your baby [CONTACT_884852] 96 weeks  (about  two year s).   
 
WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE MY BABY [CONTACT_884853]?  
 
The study doctor may need to take you/your baby [CONTACT_884854]:  
• Your infant does not receive the VRC07 -523LS  immunization.  
• You are unable to return for infant follow -up evaluations.  
• The investigator determines that further participation would be detrimental to you or 
your baby’s health or well -being.  
• You are unable to comply with the study requirements so as to seriously interfere 
with the validity of the study results.  
• The study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_18121], Office of Human Research Protection 
(OHRP), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the IMPAACT Network, an 
Institutional Research Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (EC) or local government 
regulatory agency.  An IRB or EC is a committee who watches over the safety and 
rights of research participants.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
This section describes the risks we know about.  There may also be unknown risks, even 
serious ones which we do not know about.   We will tell you if we learn anything new that 
may affect you/your baby’s health and/or  willingness to stay in the study.  
 
Risks of routine medical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures including taking blood and 
collecti ng saliva.  Blood collection can cause bruising, pain and infrequently fainting or 
lightheadedness.  The saliva pad may be slightly uncomfortable for a few minutes while 
in the baby’s mouth.  
 
Risks from subcutaneous (SC) injections  
It is possible that your baby [CONTACT_884855]07 -523LS  
injection.  General risks of an injection method include stinging, discomfort, pain, 
soreness, redness, bruising, swelling or a tiny cut at the needle insertion site and, rarely,  
local infection.   
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.[ADDRESS_1237980] been mild and brief local reactions such as redness, itching and swellin g and 
mild pain in about 14% of the adults receiving an injection of VRC01.  In those studies, 
about one half of the adults had one or more mild side effects such as a general feeling of 
discomfort, muscle aches, headache, nausea, rash and joint pain but m ost of these were 
mild.   
 
In this study, nearly [ADDRESS_1237981] four  hours after he/she has received the 
VRC07 -523LS . 
 
Side effects are expected to be ra re but may include fever, chills, shaking, nausea, 
vomiting, pain, headache, dizziness, trouble breathing, high or low blood pressure, 
itchiness, rash, hives, lip or face swelling, diarrhea, racing heart or chest pain.  These 
reactions may be related to ho w fast the antibody product is given.  The immunization 
will be given to your baby [CONTACT_844712].  
 
Monoclonal antibody products have a small risk of serious allergic reactions, including 
anaphylaxis.  Anaphylaxis may include difficulty breathing, low blood pressure, hives or 
rash, swelling in the mouth and face. These reactions are life -threatening .  Such reactions 
usually occu r quickly after the injection. T herefore, your baby [CONTACT_884856]07 -523LS .  The clinics are prepared to treat 
allergic reactions.     
 
Serum sickness is a delayed type of allergic reaction that may occur a week or two after a 
product is given.  This reaction may include hives or rash, fever, big lymph nodes (glands 
in the neck and along the body), and pains in the joints.  You will be contact[CONTACT_884857].  
 
In adults who have received VRC01  and VRC01LS , allergic reactions have been seen but 
they have been  rare and responded to treatment.  
 
Some women will be offered enrollment while a confirmatory HIV test is pending.  If this 
happens, there is a very small chance that your HIV infection will not be confirmed an d 
that you are not HIV -infected.  If so, your  baby [CONTACT_884858]07 -523LS  even 
though he/she is not at risk of getting HIV.

unknown effects on the course of your baby’s HIV infection (if he/she becomes infected).   
 
Risks of disclosure of your personal information  
We will take several steps to protect you and your baby’s personal information.  
Although the risk is very lo w, it is possible that you or your baby’s personal information 
could be given to someone who should not have it.  If that happened, you could face 
discrimination, stress, and embarrassment.  We can tell you more about how we will 
protect your personal info rmation if you would like it.

INTRODUCTION  
 
You and your baby [CONTACT_884810] (HIV) and you are breastfeeding.  
Even though you or your baby [CONTACT_884871] (medications 
agains t HIV), there is a chance your child could get HIV.  You are being asked to allow 
your baby [INVESTIGATOR_325057] a dose  of an experimental immunization within the first 5 days after 
he/she is born and a nother dose  at [ADDRESS_1237985] HIV transmission during the period that you are breastfeeding . This study 
is sponsored by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH) which has been developi[INVESTIGATOR_884763].  The doc tor in charge of this study is [insert  name] .  Before 
you decide whether you want your baby [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a part of this study, we want you to know 
about the study.  
 
This is a consent form.  It gives you information about this study.  The study staff will 
talk with you about this information.  You ar e free to ask questions about this study at 
any time.  If you agree to allow you and your baby [CONTACT_678720], you will be 
asked to sign this consent form.  You will get a copy to keep.  
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The transfer of HIV to new born babies from HIV -infected mothers can occur at the time 
of birth and during breastfeeding.  Your baby [CONTACT_884872].  This research is being done to help find a safe and effective 
immunization tha t will give babies protection against HIV infection.  Immunization is the 
process used to help strengthen the immune system against certain diseases.  
 
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.0  Page 130 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  The experimental study immunizations are monoclonal antibodies (mAb).  Antibodies are 
one of the ways the  human body fights infection.  “Monoclonal” means that all the 
antibodies in the immunization are the same.  This type of immunization is temporary 
because the antibodies will go away over time . There are three  very similar 
immunizations being used in this  study.  The first two immunization s are called 
“VRC01 ” and  “VRC01LS.”  The immunization your baby  [CONTACT_884813] 
“VRC07 -523LS .” The formal name [CONTACT_832] “VRC -HIVMAB075 -00-AB.”  In this consent 
document, and in scientific publications, this antibody is called “ VRC07 -523LS ”.   
 
The VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  immunizations are human antibody that may 
be able to block HIV from infecting the baby.  VRC01 was originally discovered in an 
HIV-infected person, but the immunization is not obtained by [CONTACT_128190] a person.  
All of these  immunizations are made u sing the same controlled, clean conditions used for 
making medications.  They were developed by [CONTACT_7681] (NIH).  
 
The VRC01 , VRC01LS , and VRC07 -523LS  have been shown to attach to and inactivate 
many HIV viruses in laboratory experi ments.  VRC01 has been tested in adults and 
babies to look at safety and to see what dose (how much) produces the desired blood 
levels of antibodies.  VRC01 LS and VRC07 -523LS  have been tested in the laboratory 
and in adults.  VRC01 LS has also been given to  babies .  We are using information from 
all of these studies to help us choose the correct dose of VRC07 -523LS  for babies.   
 
In this study, babies will receive either one or two  doses of the VRC07 -523LS  
immunization and will be followed for safety and have blood collected to measure the 
levels of VRC07 -523LS  in the baby’s blood.  Another group of babies, who are not 
breastfeeding, will receive a single  dose of the VRC07 -523LS .   
 
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO B E IN THE STUDY?  
 
If you decide that you want to be in the study, we will check to make sure you are able to 
enroll in this study.   
 
Screening to see if you can be in the study  
• We will ask for your permission to review your medical records to see if you have 
been diagnosed with HIV according to the study criteria.  If we do not find 
information about your HIV infection in your medical record, we  will collect a 5 mL 
(1 teaspoon ) sample of your blood to determine if you have HIV. We will also review 
the records for other illnesses that you may have had and that might have an impact 
on your baby’s health.  
• We will ask you questions about other studies you might have been in, and heal th 
conditions and treatments you might have received.  If your baby [CONTACT_884814], then you and your baby [CONTACT_884815] . 
•  The review of your medical history and the interview with you may be done while 
you are still pregnant or shortly after you deliver your baby.   If it is done while you 
are still pregnant you will also be asked some questions after your baby’s birth.  
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.0  Page 131 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  • If you are able to be in the study, then we will check to make sure that your baby [CONTACT_884873].  
 
Entry Visit or Day 0  
• If we have not already done so, we will ask for your permission to review your 
medical records to see if you have been diagnosed with HIV according to the study 
criteria.  We will also review the records for other il lnesses you may have had and 
that might have an impact on your baby’s health.  
• We will ask you questions about other studies you might have been in, and health 
conditions and treatments you might have received.  
• We will collect a 20 mL  (1 and ½ tablespoon) sample of your blood.  Some of this 
blood will be used to determine  if you have HIV (if it is not clear in your medical 
record) , how much HIV is in your blood and how much it may have affected your 
immune system.  The rest of the blood will be stored for f uture use.  The results of 
these tests will be used for research purposes only and will not be reported to you or 
your doctor.  
• Please note that the screening and entry visit maybe combined on the same day.  
 
WHAT DOES MY BABY [CONTACT_884817]/SHE IS IN THIS  STUDY?  
 
If you allow your baby [CONTACT_371715], your baby [INVESTIGATOR_229954] a dose of the VRC07 -
523LS  immunization within the first 5 days of his/her life and then again at 12 weeks of 
life if  you are still breastfeeding . The dose of the immunization is based on your baby’s 
weight.  Depending on the dose of the immunization, the immunization will be given in 
either  one or two injections into the skin of the upper leg(s).   
 
All babies who are enrolled and immunized on the study of VRC07 -523LS  will be seen  
and evaluated several times throughout a two -year study period.  If at any time during 
this period, the safety assessments show that the immunization maybe unsafe, no new 
babies will be immunized and the babies already on the study will continue to have 
follow -up evaluations until the end of the two -year period.  
 
Study visits for your baby  
[CONTACT_884874] .  If you breastfeed only a short 
time (less than 2 months), your baby [INVESTIGATOR_325058] [ADDRESS_1237986] P1112 Version 4.0  Page 132 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  [Sites that intend to conduct home visits should include detail throughout this section on 
the time study time points when home visits may be done in lieu of a clinic visit.]  
 
Scre ening visit to see if your baby [CONTACT_884875], we will do some tests to make sure 
your baby [CONTACT_884876].  This visit will last about 1 -2 hours.  At this visit, we 
will: 
• Ask if you a re willing for your baby [CONTACT_884823].  
• Ask about your baby’s medical history, which will include how your baby [CONTACT_884877], if he/she has been sick, conditions he/she may have and any medicines he/she 
has been taking.  This wil l also include your permission to review your baby’s 
medical records to check for medical conditions and any treatment your baby [CONTACT_884878].  
• Collect some demographic data such as race, ethnicity and gender.  
• Do a physical examination that may includ e length, weight, head measurement and 
vital signs such as temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] (how 
fast the baby [CONTACT_884826]).  
• Draw blood from either a vein (called a venipuncture) and/or from your baby’s heel 
(called a heel stick).   We will test your baby [CONTACT_884879]’s standard of care (the care your baby [CONTACT_884880]).  In addition, routine blood tests will be done to tell us how well your baby’s 
liver and kidne ys are working: again, these tests will only be performed for the study 
if they were not already collected for your baby’s medical care .  The total amount of 
blood drawn at this visit will be 2-3 mL (about half a teaspoon).    
• In addition, study staff may c ontact your baby’s doctor (if you have one) to inform 
the doctor about this study.  
 
Entry Visit or Day 0  
If your baby [CONTACT_884829], Day 0 is the day that he/she receives the first dose 
of the VRC07 -523LS  immunization.  Because the immunizati on must be given to the 
baby [CONTACT_884881] 5 days of his/her birth, the entry day or Day [ADDRESS_1237987] for a minimum of 4 hours.  
 
• If the entry day is on a different day than the screening day, we will ask about any 
medical history since the screening visit and will also do a physical exam.   
• In addition to the blood tests for screening we will draw 2-4 mL (about a half  
teaspoon) of b lood to measure a baseline of VRC07 -523LS  levels  and anti -VRC07 -
523LS antibody levels  to compare results at your baby’s next visit.  This will be 
drawn before your baby [CONTACT_884830]07 -523LS  injection.  If the screening visit 
and entry (or Day 0) visit are done on the same day, then we may draw all the blood, a 
total of 4-7 mL ( up to  1½ teaspoon) all at the same time.  Some of this blood may be 
stored for future use.   
• We will also collect about 1 mL (¼ teaspoon) of saliva from your baby’s mouth by 
[CONTACT_1299] a small pad (about the size of a thumbnail attached to stick) between the gum 
and cheek of your baby.  After a minute or two we will remove the pad and put it in a 
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.0  Page 133 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  container.  The pad will be tested to measure the amount of VRC07 -523LS  in your 
baby’s saliva.

Results of Tests  
Throughout the study, you will be informed of the results of the HIV test ing and routine 
blood tests when they become available.  The results of the other blood tests and the 
results of the saliva testing will be used for research purposes only.  These results will not 
be reported to you or your doctor.   
 
Storage of Blood Samp les  
Some of your and your baby’s blood and saliva  will be stored (with protectors of identity) 
and used for future IMPAACT -approved, HIV -related research.  Your baby [CONTACT_884893]/h er blood 
stored for later testing.  
 
Your/your baby’s samples will be shipped to and stored at a special laboratory facility in 
the [LOCATION_002].  Only approved researchers will have access to them.  People who 
work at the facility will also have access to  your/your child’s samples to keep track of 
them.  These people won’t have information that directly identifies you/your child.  
Your/your baby’s samples will not be sold or directly used to produce commercial 
products.  All proposed research studies using  your/your baby’s samples will be reviewed 
by [CONTACT_475783] (NIH).  There is no time limit on how 
long your/your baby’s samples will be stored.  
 
The researchers do not plan to contact [CONTACT_884848]’s regular doctor wit h the results 
of studies done using your/your baby’s stored samples.  This is because research studies 
are often done with experimental procedures.  The results of such studies should not be 
used to make decisions about your/your child’s medical care.  If the researchers decide 
that the result of a certain study provides important information for your/your baby’s 
medical care, your/your baby’s study doctor will be notified.  If you would like to be

any time.  If you withdraw your consent, these stored samples will be destroyed.  
 
There are two types of testing that can be done with the specimens that are in storage.  
Please r ead the following statements carefully and then mark your initials and date in the 
appropriate space provided.  
 
1. Testing for General HIV -related studies  
 
Researchers would like to store your/your baby ’s specimens to understand how HIV 
causes disease and complications, and how best to treat or prevent HIV infection and its 
complications.  They need specimens from people who have HIV and from those who do 
not.  Sometimes, too, the specimens can be used to learn something about new problems 
that people with HIV have like liver disease, diabetes, and heart disease.  These general 
studies would not include any genetic testing (looking at what makes up you/your child’s  
cells).  
 
Benefits:   There are no direct be nefits to you/your baby.  You/your baby [CONTACT_884851][INVESTIGATOR_884764].  
 
Risks: The specimens would be collected as part of you/your baby ’s study visits.  
Blood collection can cause brui sing, pain and infrequently fainting or 
lightheadedness.  Once in storage, there are few risks.  You/your baby ’s name [CONTACT_884898].

2. Testing for Special HIV -related studies  
 
Researchers in this study would also like to store your/your baby’s specimens to 
understand how HIV causes disease and complications, and how best to treat or prevent 
HIV infection and its complications through looking at how each person’s genetic 
makeup ( you/your baby’s DNA or unique cell makeup) either protects them or puts them 
at greater risk.  It may be that researchers use some of your/your baby’s blood to make a 
“cell line.”  That means the blood cells can keep dividing and give an endless supply of 
you/your baby’s DNA for tests to be done in the future.  This kind of information will be

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
About 39 mothers and their babies will be part of the VRC01 portion of this study.  
About 20 mothers and their babies will be part of the VRC01LS portion of this study.  
About 20 mothers and their babies will be part of the VRC07 -523LS  portion of this 
study.  
 
HOW LONG WILL I/MY CHILD/BABY [CONTACT_371729]?  
 
You will only be in the study for as long as it takes to screen you and determine that you 
are eligible for the study  (about one day) and have your blood collected.  Your baby [CONTACT_884895] 96 weeks  (about two  years) .   
 
WHY WOULD THE DOCTOR TAKE MY BABY [CONTACT_884853]?  
 
The study doctor may need to take you/your baby [CONTACT_884896]:  
• Your infant does not receive the VRC07 -523LS  immunization.  
• You are unable to return for infant follow -up evaluations.  
• The investigator determines that further participation would be detrimental to you or 
your baby’s health or well -being.  
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.0  Page 139 of 144 06 Nov ember  2018  • You are unable to comply with the study requirements so as to seriously interfere 
with the validity of the study results.  
• The study may be discontinued by [CONTACT_18121], Office of Human Research Protection 
(OHRP), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the IMPAA CT Network, an 
Institutional Research Board (IRB) /Ethics Committee (EC) or local government 
regulatory agency.  An IRB or EC is a committee who watches over the safety and 
rights of research participants.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
This section de scribes the risks we know about.  There may also be unknown risks, even 
serious ones which we do not know about.  We will tell you if we learn anything new that 
may affect you/your baby’s health and/or  willingness to stay in the study.  
 
Risks of routine me dical procedures:  
In this study, we will do some routine medical procedures including taking blood and 
collecting saliva.  Blood collection can cause bruising, pain and infrequently fainting or 
lightheadedness.  The saliva pad may be slightly uncomfortable for a few minutes  while 
in the baby’s mouth.  
 
Risks from subcutaneous (SC) injections  
It is possible that your baby [CONTACT_884855]07 -523LS  
injection.  General risks of an injection method include stinging, discomfort, pain, 
soreness, redness, brui sing, swelling or a tiny cut at the needle insertion site and, rarely, 
local infection.   
 
Risks of the VRC07 -523LS   
This study is the first time that VRC07 -523LS  is being given to babies, but to date, [ADDRESS_1237991] be en mild and brief local reactions such as redness, itching and swelling and 
mild pain in about 14% of the adults receiving an injection of VRC01.  In those studies, 
about one half of the adults had one or more mild side effects such as a general feeling of  
discomfort, muscle aches, headache, nausea, rash and joint pain but most of these were 
mild.   
 
In this study, nearly40 babies  have received VRC01  and [ADDRESS_1237992] four  hours after he/she has received the 
first dose of VRC0 7-523LS. If your baby [INVESTIGATOR_202916] a second dose of VRC0 7-523LSat 
Week 12, he/she will be observed for at least one hour after that dose.  
  
IMPAACT P1112 Version 4.[ADDRESS_1237993] one  hour after the second dose (if 
recei ved). T he clinics are prepared to treat allergic reactions.     
 
Serum sickness is a delayed type of allergic reaction that may occur a week or two after a 
product is given.  This reaction may include hives or rash, fever, big lymph nodes (glands 
in the ne ck and along the body), and pains in the joints.  You will be contact[CONTACT_884857].  
 
In adults who have received VRC01  and VRC01LS , allergic reactions have been seen but 
they have been rare an d responded to treatment.  
 
Some women will be offered enrollment while a confirmatory HIV test is pending.  If this 
happens, there is a very small chance that your HIV infection will not be con firmed and 
that you are not HIV -infected.  If so, your baby [CONTACT_884858]07 -523LS  even 
though he/she is not at risk of getting HIV.   
 
In addition to the possible risks that are listed above, VRC07 -523LS  may have other side 
effects that are not yet known .  It is also possible that the VRC07 -523LS  will have 
unknown effects on the course of your baby’s HIV infection (if he/she becomes infected).    
 
Risks of disclosure of your personal information  
We will take several steps to protect you and your baby’s personal information.  
Although the risk is very low, it is possible that you or your baby’s personal information 
could be given to someone who should not have it.  If that happened, you could face 
discrimination, stress, and embarrassment.  We can tell you more about how we will 
protect your personal informatio n if you would like it.  
 
ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
If you or your baby [CONTACT_884859], it is possible that the immunization may 
prevent the transmission of HIV to the baby [CONTACT_884860].  However, the studies of 
VRC07 -523LS  have not looked at whether VRC07 -523LS  is good at preventing 
transmission of HIV.  It is also possible that your baby [CONTACT_884861].  Information learned from this study may help others who are exposed to or 
infected with HIV.

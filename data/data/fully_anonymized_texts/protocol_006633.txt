Protocol Body
1.0 Objectives
1.1 To assess whether the time to progression for these high-risk patients can be prolonged to a median of 36 months, compared to the historical 
expectation of approximately 
24 months.
1.2 To assess the tolerance and efficacy of Y2B8 (Zevalin) after R-FND (rituximab, fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone) in patients with 
high-risk stage III-IV 
follicular lymphoma
1.3 To assess overall response, failure-free survival, and survival of this strategy compared to our historical experience with FND (fludarabine, 
mitoxantrone, dexamethasone)  
alone or R-FND
1.[ADDRESS_43096] therapy are COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone), CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, 
prednisone, and doxorubicin), and FND (fludarabine, mitoxantrone, dexamethasone (1,2)).  Increasingly, rituximab is being incorporated into front-line 
regimens, with promising results (3,4).
Prognostic models can identify  subsets who are less likely to attain complete response (CR), or whose remissions are likely to be relatively brief (3, 5-
7).  A large multi-institutional collaboration has recently led to a prognostic model that identifies high-risk patients based on the presence of 3 or more of 
the following features:  stage III-IV; age 60 or more; elevated LDH; Hgb < 12; and 5 or more involved nodal sites (8). 
2.2 bcl-2.  
The bcl-2 gene is rearranged in about 85% of patients with follicular lymphoma.  The small fraction without bcl-[ADDRESS_43097] a 
worse outlook 
(9).   For those with bcl-2 gene rearrangement, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) provides an excellent way to monitor these patients 
for subclinical residual disease (10,11).  Ultimately, a quantitative PCR technique may prove useful (12); currently, the literature that supports the use of 
PCR for bcl-2 is based on qualitative (positive or negative) PCR data.
2.3 Fludarabine and FND Combination
Fludarabine is an active agent for patients with indolent lymphomas; it has been used in the setting of relapse and up-front, and has been used alone and 
in combination (13,14).  The FND combination has been particularly effective and well tolerated (11-13), and is capable of inducing molecular remission 
(18).
Our sequential experience  with FND started with a phase I trial (15) that has defined a dose that has been adopted widely (16, 19-22).  We subsequently 
conducted a phase II trial in the setting of relapse (17), then front-line trials including one in conjunction with rituximab (6, 23, 24).  These latter trials (6, 
23, 24) provide the framework for the questions to be addressed in the current trial.  The FND front-line experience that has the longest follow-up is 
DM92-103 (23).  Based on that trial, we expect a CR rate of about 80%, and a 5-year failure-free survival of about 40%.  The R-FND experience (protocol 
DM97-261) has shorter follow-up; the DM97-261 experience provides the expectation of a molecular response rate of 80% (17,18).
2.4 Rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies
Rituximab is a chimeric  anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (25).  As a single agent, it has been effective and well tolerated (26-28).  In combination with 
chemotherapy, it has been well tolerated (24,29).  Ongoing trials suggest that rituximab can add to the impact of chemotherapy (30).  Rituximab is 
capable of inducing molecular remissions (31).
Zevalin is a radioimmunoconjugate that targets CD20, the same pan B antigen recognized by [CONTACT_4124].  It is a highly active single agent (32, 33). 
The safety  
profile of Zevalin in five clinical trials revealed that AEs are primarily hematologic with Grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia 
occurring in 30%, 10%, and 4% of patients, respectively.  Most nonhematologic AEs were Grade 1 or 2 and the incidence was comparable to that seen 
with rituximab.  Hematologic toxicity did not correlate with any of the dosimetric or pharmacokinetic parameters analyzed.  Patients were effectively 
screened for safe treatment using clinical selection criteria including percent bone marrow involvement with NHL (<25%), baseline platelet count (> 
100,000 cells/mm3).  Patients were treated safely using individualized dosing based on patient weight and platelet count.  The incorporation of Zevalin, in 
sequence with chemotherapy, in the front-line strategy proposed in this protocol is investigational.
3.0 Background Drug Information
3.1
Fludarabine is commercially available.  
3.2 Mitoxantrone is commercially available.
3.3 Dexamethasone is commercially available.
3.4 Rituximab (Rituxan®)  is commercially available.  Safety information is as follows:
Hematologic Events: In  clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 cytopenias were reported in 48% of patients treated with rituximab; these include: lymphopenia 
(40%), neutropenia (6%), leukopenia (4%), anemia (3%), and thrombocytopenia (2%).  The median duration of lymphopenia was 14 days (range, 1 to 588 
days) and of neutropenia was 13 days (range, 2 to 116 days).  A single occurrence of transient aplastic anemia (pure red cell aplasia) and two 
occurrences of hemolytic anemia following rituximab therapy were reported.

12/23/[ADDRESS_43099]-marketing reports of prolonged pancytopenia, marrow hypoplasia, and late onset n
(defined as occurring [ADDRESS_43100] dose of rituximab) in patients with hematologic malignancies.  In reported cases of late onset neutropenia 
(NCI-CTC Grade 3 and 4), the median duration of neutropenia was 10 days (range 3 to 148 days).  Documented resolution of the neutropenia was 
described in approximately one-half of the reported cases; of those with documented recovery, approximately half received growth factor support.  In the 
remaining cases, information on resolution was not provided.  More than half of the reported cases of delayed onset neutropenia occurred in patients who 
had undergone a prior autologous bone marrow transplantation.  In an adequately designed, controlled, clinical trial, the reported incidence of NCI-CTC 
Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients receiving rituximab in combination with fludarabine as compared to those receiving fludarabine alone 
(76% [39/51] vs.39% [21/53]).
3.4.1 Investigational  Drug Nomenclature
IDEC  Pharmaceuticals code designation IDEC C2B8
Generic Name: [CONTACT_41243]
IND Number: BB-IND 4904
3.4.2 Clinical Formulation
Clinical supplies for this study will be manufactured by [CONTACT_41222], CA.
Rituximab will  be provided to the clinical sites packaged in single use 10 mL (100mg) and 50 mL (500mg)Type I glass vials at a concentration of [ADDRESS_43101] is formulated in 7.35 mg/mL sodium citrate buffer, containing 7 mg/mL polysorbate 80, 9.0 mg/mL sodium chloride and
Sterile Water for Injection.  The pH is adjusted to 6.5.
Rituximab is  produced by a mammalian (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cell suspension culture in a nutrient medium containing 100 mg/mL of the antibiotic
gentamicin.  The antibiotic is not detectable in the final product.
3.4.3 Storage
Rituximab for clinical use should be stored in a secure refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius.
3.4.4 Reconstitution  and dilution of rituximab
Using a sterile syringe and a 21 gauge or larger needle, transfer the necessary amount of rituximab from the vial into a partially filled 
IV pack containing sterile, pyrogen-free 0.9% Sodium Chloride, USP (saline solution).  The final concentration of rituximab should be 1 
mg/mL.  Mix by [CONTACT_41223].  
Caution should be taken during the preparation of the drug.  Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate 
matter prior to administration.  Preparations of rituximab containing visible particles should not be used.  As with all parenteral drug 
products, aseptic procedures should be used during the preparation and administration of rituximab.
NOTE:  DO NOT USE A VACUUM APPARATUS to transfer rituximab from the syringe to the infusion pack.  DO NOT USE 
evacuated glass containers which require vented administration sets, because this causes foaming when air bubbles pass through the 
solution.
3.5 Zevalin:  Zevalin is composed of the following:  a murine IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody IDEC-2B8 (ibritumomab); the linker chelator 
tiuxetan (isothiocyanatobenzyl 
MX-DTPA); and the radioisotope 90Y that is securely chelated via the linker.  Like its unlabeled chimeric 
counterpart, rituximab, Zevalin targets the CD20 antigen present on 95% of B cell lymphomas.  IDEC-In2B8 is the 111Indium-labeled murine 
monoclonal antibody used for imaging and dosimetry.  Rituximab is given initially to clear peripheral B lymphocytes and optimize biodistribution of 
the radiolabeled antibody.  Dosimetry studies have shown that normal organ and red marrow radiation doses were estimated to be well under 
2000 cGy and 300 cGy, respectively. Estimated median tumor absorbed dose as determined by [CONTACT_41224] 18 tumors in 9 patients was 1712 cGy 
(range 575 – 6710).  In a specific analysis of safety, estimated absorbed red marrow radiation dose (performed by [CONTACT_41225]-derived and sacral 
image-derived methods), blood T 1/2, blood AUC, plasma T 1/2, and plasma AUC did not predict severity of hematologic toxicity as demonstrated by 
[CONTACT_41226].  In a multicenter phase II trial, adverse events were primarily hematologic, transient, and 
reversible.  The median nadirs were 34,000/mm3 for platelets, 60/mm3 for ANC, and 10.0 g/dL for hemoglobin.  Grade 4 neutropenia and 
thrombocytopenia occurred in 31% and 12% of patients.

4.0 Patient  Eligibility
4.1 Patients  with previously untreated Ann Arbor stage III-IV follicular lymphoma, grade 1 and 2, with high-risk features are eligible for this 
protocol.  High-risk is defined according to the FL-IPI (4), based on the presence of advanced stage, plus any additional 2 of the following 4 
features: age60 or more; elevated LDH; Hgb < 12; or number of involved nodal sites 5 or more.
4.2 Follicular lymphoma, grade 3 (follicular large cell lymphoma): If eligible for a current large cell lymphoma protocol, that alternative protocol is 
recommended, particularly grade 3b or FLCL patients characterized as large non-cleaved cell.  However, both FND and rituximab have 
established efficacy in FLCL, so if a patient is not eligible for a protocol for aggressive lymphoma (e.g., because of SCCL in the marrow), then 
registration on this trial is permitted.

5.1.[ADDRESS_43110]. Felipe Samaniego 
12/23/2019
5.1.4 Patients are recommended to receive fludarabine phosphate I.V. over 5-30 minutes daily for 3 days.  Mitoxantrone is recommended 
to be given I.V. over 5-30 minutes.  Rituximab will be given as in section 5.1.  Courses are recommended to be repeated every 4 
weeks.  Restaging on R-FND is recommended to be conducted after completion of 2 and 4 courses.
5.1.5 Patients achieving a stable partial response or demonstrating continued response after 4 courses may be given an additional 2 
courses.  Discuss with P.I.
5.1.6 Patients demonstrating progressive disease or no response after 2-4 courses will come off study. See section 9.1.
5.1.7 Dose adjustment to the next lower level will be made if pneumonia, septicemia, or other life-threatening infection occurs with any 
course.  If recovery of the WBC or platelet count to the level prior to treatment exceeds 35 days, the dose may be decreased 1 level.  If grade 3 
or 4 toxicities to other organ systems develops, the dose level may be lowered 1 or 2 levels respectively.
5.1.8 Four courses is the intended limit for R-FND.  For patients with substantial (>20%) ongoing shrinkage of measurable disease 
between courses 2 and 4 will receive additional R-FND, if their hematologic tolerance has been good. If such special circumstances warrant 
consideration of additional R-FND, please discuss with P.I. 
5.2 GUIDELINES FOR RITUXIMAB ADMINISTRATION:   
CAUTION: DO NOT  ADMINISTER RITUXIMAB AS AN INTRAVENOUS PUSH OR BOLUS
5.2.1 Recommended:  Premedication (two tablets [375mg or 500 mg] of acetaminophen orally and 25 to 100 mg diphenhydramine 
hydrochloride orally or intravenously) to be administered 30 to 60 minutes prior to starting each infusion of rituximab.  
5.2.2 The drug may be administered via a peripheral or central intravenous line.
5.2.3 Recommended:  During the rituximab infusion, the patient’s vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], temperature) are 
recommended to be monitored every [ADDRESS_43111] epi[INVESTIGATOR_41217], diphenhydramine hydrochloride for 
intravenous injection, and resuscitation equipment for emergency management of anaphylactoid reactions.
5.2.4 Recommended:  The initial dose rate at the time of the first rituximab infusion is recommended to be 50 mg/hr for the first half hour.  If 
no toxicity is seen, the dose rate may be escalated gradually (50 mg/hour increments at 30-minute intervals) to a maximum of 500 mg/hr.  If 
the first dose of rituximab is well tolerated, the starting flow rate for the administration of doses 2-4 will be 100 mg/hour then increased gradually 
(100 mg/hour increments at 30-minute intervals) not to exceed 600 mg/hr.
5.2.5 Patients may experience transient fever and rigors with infusion of chimeric anti-CD20 (rituximab) antibody.  When these side effects 
are noted, the antibody infusion is recommended be slowed or interrupted.  The patient should be observed and the severity of the side effects 
should be evaluated.  The patient should be treated according to the best available local practices and procedures.  Following observation, 
when the patient’s symptoms improve, the infusion may be resumed, initially at half the previous rate (see table below).  Upon resolution of all 
side effects and in the judgement of the investigator, the patient’s dose may be gradually escalated (50 mg/hr increments at 30 minute 
intervals) to a maximum rate of 300 mg/hr.  Following the antibody infusion, it is recommended that the IV line be kept open for medications, as 
needed.  If complications occur during the rituximab infusion, the patient should be observed for two hours after the completion of the infusion.
                                                                              Mucosal
                                                                           Congestion/             % Drop in

5.4.3 Schedule: Zevalin to start approximately 12-[ADDRESS_43114] course of R-FND, pending hematologic recovery as outlined 
above in 5.4.2
[IP_ADDRESS] The 90Y isotope order form must be completed and faxed to the designated isotope vendor preceding the initial rituximab 
infusion.  Patients will receive an initial infusion of 250 mg/m2 rituximab.  One week later, patients must receive a second infusion of 250 
mg/m2 of rituximab and 0.3 mCi/kg of ZEVALIN.  The exact dose of ZEVALIN will be based on the patient’s weight during the baseline 
evaluation.  The maximum dose is not to exceed 32 mCi of 90Y.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rituximab Administration (See 5.2)
[IP_ADDRESS] Zevalin Administration
The
 Zevalin phase of the treatment program is a coordinate schedule of two rituximab doses, a single therapeutic Zevalin dose, and 
an imaging 111 In Zevalin dose (see sections 5.4.31. and [IP_ADDRESS]).  The therapeutic dose of Zevalin will be administered approximately one 
week after the first 250 mg/m2 rituximab infusion (see [IP_ADDRESS] above), and following the second rituximab infusion.
Each patient will receive one therapeutic dose of ZEVALIN according to the dosing schema in Section [IP_ADDRESS], not to exceed [ADDRESS_43115] be on line between the 
syringe and the infusion port.  (The 0.22 micron filter is not provided by [CONTACT_41231]).  Flush the line with at least [ADDRESS_43116] 
PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES AT THE CLINICAL SITE.  
ALL DOSES WILL  BE CALCULATED USING ACTUAL BODY WEIGHT. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Indium-111 Imaging:
All 
patients will have imaging studies using 111In Zevalin antibody before the therapeutic course.  The plan is as follows:  
Day 1: A course of 250 mg/m2 rituximab infusion, followed by 5.0 mCi of 111In Zevalin (for details please see Appendix I).
First whole body imaging:  between 2-24 hours after infusion of
111In Zevalin  and prior to urination (for details refer to Appendix I).
Second whole body imaging:  48-[ADDRESS_43117] whole body imaging:  Only necessary if scan 2 showed a potential complication of biodistribution and would be used to make a 
treat or no treat decision.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluations During the 111In Zevalin Imaging Period
During the imaging period, vital signs will be obtained every [ADDRESS_43118] hour during the Rituxan infusion, hourly during the remainder of the 
infusion, and 
immediately following the indium labeled Zevalin infusion.  If vital signs are unstable, they will be monitored at 5-minute intervals until stable.
The purpose of the indium labeled imaging is two fold:
To evaluate biodistribution of whole body gamma camera images
To assess whether biodistribution is acceptable to proceed with 90Y Zevalin radioimmunotherapy.
The biodistribution of  111In Zevalin is to be determined from a visual evaluation of whole body gamma images during the first day (2-24 hours) and the 
second or third day (48-72 hours) after injection.
The expected biodistribution  is as follows:
Easily detectable uptake in the blood pool areas (including but not limited to the heart, major abdominal blood vessels, vascular areas of the head, lungs 
and pelvis) 
on the first day image, with less activity in the blood pool areas on the second or third day image.
Moderately high to high uptake in normal liver and spleen during the first day and the second or third day images.
Moderately low or very low uptake in normal kidneys, urinary bladder, and normal bowel on the first day image and the second or third day image.
Tumor uptake may be visualized in soft tissue as areas of the increased intensity, and tumor bearing areas in normal organs may be seen as areas of 
increased or 
decreased intensity.
Altered biodistribution would be as follows:
Diffuse uptake in normal lung more intense than the cardiac blood pool on the first day image, or more intense than the liver on the second or third day 
image.
Kidneys  
with greater intensity than the liver on the posterior view of the second or third day image.
Biodistribution of 111In Zevalin should be assessed on the first day image and second or third day image.  If desired, a third image can be obtained at 90 
- 120 hrs to support the decision.  If the patient has an altered biodistribution, the patient will be taken off study before proceeding to 90Y Zevalin 
radioimmunotherapy.  (See Appendix I for additional details regarding data acquisition for 111In Zevalin).
5.4.4 Subsequent monitoring:
For 
toxicity:  see sections 7.7 (CBC, etc) and 7.6 (marrow cytogenetics), and Appendices A and L.
For efficacy:  see section 7.2 and 7.3

5.5.2 Schedule:
 Rituximab: 375 mg/m2 IV, a single dose every other month for 12 mo (6 doses total).  Start 6-8 weeks after Zevalin, at approximately month 7.
NOTE:  Rituximab maintenance can and should start on schedule, even if there is delayed hematologic recovery after Zevalin.
5.6.Chemotherapy Dose Modification Guidelines
5.6.1 Recommended Guidelines for Hematological Toxicity:  for fludarabine and mitoxantrone (see 5.1.3):
Lowest granulocytes Lowest Platelets Modification
>200 > 20,000 No change
<200 for > 5 days and/or < 20,000 Decrease one level

Grade 
0-2 No change
3 Decrease one level
4 Stop Treatment
5.6.3
Duration of therapy and intervals between courses:
a) R-FND courses are recommended to repeated every 28 days, after verification of hematologic recovery.
b) Total length of R-FND treatment will be [ADDRESS_43120] patients.  Exceptions should be discussed with PI, e.g. give more if response is 
slow (see sections 5.1.5 and 5.1.8), or stop early if there is evidence of cumulative myelosuppression, with more than 6 weeks before recovery of 
granulocytes to 1000 or more or platelets to 100,000 or more.
5.6.4 Patients older than 60 years will receive full doses of chemotherapy. 
5.6.5 Anyone experiencing delayed recovery of granulocyte counts (>35 days) or neutropenic fever will be candidates for colony 
stimulating factor support, with the chemotherapy doses adjusted down one dose level.

ID03-[ADDRESS_43123]. Felipe Samaniego 
12/23/2019
7.1 Recommended:  Patients are recommended to be followed with CBC, platelet count and differential weekly for the first course, and q 2 wk 
thereafter.  An SMA is recommended every month during chemotherapy.
7.2 After two courses, after four courses, 6-8 weeks after Zevalin,(i.e. approximately month 8 and 9), and 3 months later (approximately month 
11-12), a 
full re-evaluation is to be performed, including:
7.2.1 Mandatory: CBC, differential, and platelet count, SMA-12, bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_22602], CT scan of abdomen and pelvis, chest 
x-ray, and any other studies that were positive at baseline, such as CT head and neck or CT chest.
7.2.2 Optional: quantitative immunoglobulins.  Surface marker studies on peripheral blood and bone marrow.
7.2.3 Prior to Zevalin therapy: 
CBC, chemistries, marrow, CXR; and
Optional:  Serum rituximab level
7.[ADDRESS_43124] 18 months, then every 6 months until month 36, then 
every 12 months.  PCR in the bone marrow will be followed at times of bone marrow sampling, (see Section 7.2.1 and Appendix E), i.e., baseline, 
before Zevalin, 6-[ADDRESS_43125] 3 years, and every 12 months 
subsequently.  
7.3.2 For patients who are still PCR positive after Zevalin:  proceed to rituximab and explore alternative (off this protocol) treatment options, 
especially stem cell transplant, which is recommended to be pursued at first evidence of progressive disease by [CONTACT_2085] (x-ray, marrow, physical 
exam) criteria.
7.4 Recommended:  Restaging after month 12:  every 4 months for 1 year (while on maintenance), then every 4-6 months for 2 years, then yearly 
(see Appendix E).  Beyond year 5, it is recognized that these recommended assessments may not be realistic (due to age, distance, or cost 
issues).  We will nonetheless strive to get this data.
7.5 Optional:  Peripheral blood lymphocyte surface markers and Ig’s every 3-4 months during therapy, and every 6-12 months off therapy until 
any abnormalities resolve.
7.6 Marrow cytogenetics:  after 4 courses R-FND (before Zevalin): and 12-18 months after Zevalin.
7.7 During  Zevalin phase:
CBC, diff, platelets weekly x 12 wks;
chemistries monthly x 3 mo;
urinalysis at  1 and 3 mo;
immunoglobulins at 3 mo;
HAMA at times of lab testing/clinic visits post-Zevalin (see Section 7.2), i.e., at about 6-8 weeks after Zevalin, and at months 9 and 12.
7.8 During 
rituximab maintenance: CBC with differential and SMA every 1-3 months during maintenance

d. An estimate of overall objective and subjective response will be made and recorded at each visit.
8.2 Response Definitions (34):
I. A molecular complete remission is defined as a patient with an initially positive peripheral  blood PCR who converts to negative on at least 2 
consecutive occasions 
no less than 2 months apart.  If, during the interval when 2 consecutive blood PCR’s are negative, marrow PCR is positive, 
such patients would not be considered a molecular complete responder.  (Such cases of discordance are infrequent but can occur).    
II. Clinical CR:  defined as those who achieve a normal state which includes no detectable evidence of disease on x-rays.
III. CRu:  defined as “CR unconfirmed” on the basis of minimal residual abnormalities on x-ray such as a residual mass <25% of original 
measurement, and or residual indeterminate bone marrow aggregates.
IV. PR:  a 50% or more reduction in the sum of the products of the diameters of the [ADDRESS_43130] measurable lesions.  No new sites of disease.
V. Minor 
response or failure includes < 50% tumor shrinkage or > 50%, but with tumor regrowth between courses.  Progressive disease (PD) is 
also defined by [CONTACT_41236], of other new or worsening sites of disease, such as > 50% increase in the size of liver and/or 
spleen, or a > 50% increase in absolute number of circulating lymphocytes.  An unimproved bone marrow, i.e., failure too attain the criteria for PR as 
defined above, will also be considered to be a failure/non-response (NR).
8.3 All toxicities encountered during the study will be evaluated according to the grading system (0-4) in Appendix B and recorded prior to each 
course of 
therapy.  Duration and treatment will be recorded. 
8.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Principal Investigator, the IRB and, if necessary, the FDA any serious or unexpected 
adverse event (including death) due to any cause whether or not related to the study drug(s) must be immediately reported to the principal 
investigator.
It is the responsibility of the Investigator-Sponsor as the IND holder to IMMEDIATELY REPORT ALL SERIOUS OR UNEXPECTED 
ADVERSE EVENTS IMMEDIATELY TO THE IRB CHAIR (AS PER INSTITUTION POLICY) AND, IF APPROPRIATE, TO THE FDA BY 
[CONTACT_41237] A MEDWATCH FORM (FDA FORM 3500A).  The Investigator-Sponsor must promptly provide a copy of the 
MedWatch form to IDEC Pharmaceutical Corporation at the same time it is submitted to the FDA.  Completed FDA 3500A reports should be 
faxed to the Pharmacovigilance Department of IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corporation ([PHONE_723]).  See Appendix A and M for additional 
information and a blank copy of the MedWatch form.
Serious adverse events occurring after initiation of other anti-cancer therapy do not need to be reported, unless the therapy is initiated and

Patients whose maximum response is only PR, particularly if there is biopsy-proven or metabolically active disease, should be considered 
strongly for alternative therapy, such as stem cell transplantation.  CR/CRu patients who do not attain molecular response after Zevalin and 3-[ADDRESS_43132].

10.[ADDRESS_43133] therapy in a multicenter study 
(including MDACC), the median time to progression (TTP) was 24 months (8).  The new regimen would be regarded as a success if median TTP 
can be prolonged to 36 months or greater.  A maximum of 50 patients will be entered on this single arm trial, at an expected accrual rate of 2 
patients per month.  The trial will require approximately 25 months for patient accrual and an additional 8 months for patient follow-up.  If the trial 
continues to maximum accrual and sufficient follow-up to observe 30 progression events, then a 95% credible interval for median TTP (assumed 
to be 36 months) would extend from 27.9 to 52.9 months.
 
10.2. Secondary objectives
Additional endpoints are achievement of response (CR + CRu + PR), as defined in Section 8, overall survival, and safety.  Toxicity will be 
recorded for all patients, separately by [CONTACT_479], type of toxicity, and chemotherapy cycle. For patients treated with Zevalin, subsequent toxicity, 
including HAMA, will be tabulated separately.
Concerning safety, the R-FND therapy program is known to be safe (24).  The use of Zevalin is safe (33,35).  The sequential use of Zevalin 
shortly after chemotherapy is innovative, but not unprecedented (P. Multani, personal communication).  The potential for marrow toxicity will be 
monitored carefully following Zevalin (see Section 7.7). 
Treatment related mortality  is expected to be rare.  Any such events will be reported (see Section 11.4); if [ADDRESS_43134]. Felipe Samaniego 
12/23/2019
The distribution of  TTP will be estimated by [CONTACT_41238], and accompanied by 95% confidence interval.  Summary 
statistics will be computed for response and toxicity endpoints.  All patients who receive any chemotherapy will be included in calculation of these 
endpoints.  Patients lost to follow-up are regarded as failures if response has not been measured, and as censored observations at date of loss 
for purpose of estimating TTP.  
10.4. Interim monitoring
The
 trial will be monitored as often as feasible and will be stopped early if, based on current data, it is unlikely that the median TTP following 
R-FND followed 
by [CONTACT_41239] [ADDRESS_43135] therapy (see section 
10.5).  The probability criterion is recomputed prior to each patient entry (or as often as possible) and requires updating of TTP information for 
each patient previously entered.  This will be accomplished through a web-based computer program and data entry screen provided by [CONTACT_41240].  In the event of insufficient evidence of the superiority of R-FND followed by [CONTACT_41241], the program will print a statement that no further patients should be accrued to the trial.
To obtain operating characteristics of these monitoring procedures, the trial was simulated using several assumed medians for time to 
progression, with 
computer generated patients arriving according to a Poisson process at the rate of 2 patients per month.  Results follow:
Median TP
(months)Pr (stop early) # of Patients Average trial length (months)
[ADDRESS_43136] 25 patients, to be conducted 13 months after 
registration of 
patient 25.
Preliminary reviews of safety  will also be done:  (a) after the enrollment of 10 patients; and (b) after the first [ADDRESS_43137] follow-
up if progression has not been observed for a patient.  At each interim analysis, we will apply a Bayesian method of updating prior information 
with TTP data observed to that time.  It is assumed that the TTP for each patient is exponentially distributed with median, NEW, for the R-FND 
followed by [CONTACT_41242] H for standard treatment.  Based on historical data, H is assumed to follow an inverse 
gamma distribution with mean [ADDRESS_43138] the little prior knowledge of NEW , we assume an inverse gamma distribution with 
the same mean and variance 100.  Since the goal of the study is to increase the median TTP by 12 months, the trial will be stopped early if, 
based on current data, Pr ( NEW >H + 12 month data) < 0.03.  The probability cutoff of 0.03 was chosen to obtain a 0.054 false negative (early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) probability if the true median TTP is 36 months.
11.0 Data and Protocol Management, and Reporting

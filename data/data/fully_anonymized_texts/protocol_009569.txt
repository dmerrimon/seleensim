Amendment 5Ver. 9/ 30/[ADDRESS_764963]  
 This protocol for human research study is conducted according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice  (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) 
Guidelines) and applicable government regulations (e.g. Title 45, Part 46 Code of Federal Regulations).  
 The development of radioembolization with microspheres represents a significant advance in the treatm ent of patients with metastatic disease to the liver. [1,2] This 
technique uses semi -empi[INVESTIGATOR_581761]. Moreover, dose is assumed to be uniformly distributed throughout the treated volume. Although the efficacy of treatment and limited side effects are evidence of high intratumoral doses with minimal radiation to normal liver, there have been few attempts to quantify the actual doses delivered. Knowledge of the se doses may allow more accurate determination of the effect of dose 
on response, improved algorithms for prescription of the safest and most effective dose for each patient, and safer integration of additional treatment to the area with either microsphere s or external beam radiation. Therefore, we are proposing a new technique to 
better characterize the dose deposition of radioactive microspheres. The research plan 
will be based on the recent publication of positron emission from Yttrium 90 (Y -90), 
which c an be utilized to image sphere distribution on a positron emission tomography 
(PET) scanner, without the administration of additional radiolabeled tracer. Three dimensional dose distributions will be generated and fused onto the CT data of patients to display doses to tumors and normal tissues.  
 
1.[ADDRESS_764964] patients  being either overtreated or undertreated. The 
development of a novel technique for defining actual dose delivered will better define the activity required to achieve specific doses, and begin to support the transition from a model of dose prescription bas ed primarily on body surface area to one that predicts the 
dose to both tumor and normal tissues.   The current formulae for determining the prescribed activity to patients to be treated with radiolabeled microspheres are crude and do not take into account  significant variations in 
tumor size, shape, or location. There are two radiolabeled microsphere products currently available for treating patients with liver tumors (metastatic or primary): SIR -Spheres 
(Sirtex Medical, North Sydney, Australia) and Theras phere (Nordion, Ottawa, Canada). 
The formula most commonly used for SIR -Spheres is largely driven by [CONTACT_581767]:

Amendment 5Ver. 9/ 30/2014 
 
ERP-RT-060 
A [GBq] = BSA – 0.2 + (TV/TLV)  
 
where A = activity, GBq = Gigabecquerels (units), BSA = body surface area, TV = tumor volume, and TLV = total liver volume. This may be multiplied by [CONTACT_581768] (fraction of the total liver volume being treated) for patients in whom whole liver treatment is not being pursued. The formula used for calculation of activity in Therasphere administration i s:  
 A [GBq] = (D [Gy] x m [kg])/49.38  where D is the desired dose in Gy, m is the tumor mass in kg. Dose is set to a nominal 100-120 Gy, based on an expected uniform distribution of microspheres over the treated 
region. However, there is no data availabl e to date that would definitely confirm this. 
Moreover, this should not be expected to be true. This is due to the existence of hypervascular malignancy with blood supply derived from the hepatic arterial system and normal tissue deriving its blood supply from the portal vein –all within the treated 
volume.  Neither one of these formulas, nor any others in routine use, takes into account the differences in expected dose based upon the size, shape, and location of tumors. In fact, the prescription is simply the total activity to be administered, without any calculation of the dose to be delivered from this activity. Additionally, there is almost no calculation of 
expected normal tissue doses, with the exception of the use of Tc -99m macro- aggregated 
albumin (MA A) in order to quantify the lung shunt at the time of angiography prior to 
treatment. These limitations in the current prescription methodology hamper the ability to move this treatment technique forward, because without doses to both normal tissues and tumors it is not possible to ascribe better responses or increased side effects to the doses 
received. Therefore, in the ten years since this treatment has become available, there has been little or minimal advancement in the treatment technique.  
 The emission of positrons from Y -90 has recently been used to generate positron 
emission tomographs of radiolabeled microsphere distribution [3]. A similar technique has been used to measure the absorbed dose in an anatomical phantom – a laboratory stand -in for a patient – after treatment with SIR -spheres [4]. However, to our knowledge 
this technique has not been routinely performed in patients.   With the availability of a new technique to quantify the dose to tumors and normal tissues, it will be possible  to correlate response and toxicity with actual dose delivered. A 
second potential application will be the correlation of the activity on the MAA scan with the actual dose deposition. It will be valuable to determine whether the MAA scan is a reliable pred ictor of dose distribution. With this relationship better defined, we may be 
able to escalate the dose delivered in many patients in order to improve the control rates and decrease doses in patients who are expected to have higher doses to normal tissues.   
1.2.1 Preliminary Data  
Copyright © 2014 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Extramural Research Program. All rights reserved.  
Amendment 5Ver. 9/ 30/2014 
 
ERP-RT-060 
The 3D dose absorbed in a patient is calculated by [CONTACT_581769] 
A(x, y, z) with the dose kernel for Y -90 source, according to the following expression.  
 
  
 where λ is the decay constant of Y -90 isotope and K is the dose kernel. The activity 
distribution in the equation above is due to electrons emitted by [CONTACT_581770], but the measured PET scan data is the activity distribution due to emitted positrons. As a result, one can rewrite the above equation in the following from,  
 
  where A
p is the measured activity due to positrons and γis the conversion factor. Since 
the PET scanner’s resolution is not sufficient to resolve individual spheres, the dose kernel is calculated for a volume element of the size equal to that of the PET scanner’s voxel size, which is 0.4 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The whole volume of the voxel is assumed to be filled with tissue, with uniformly distributed electron sources in it that emit electrons with energy spectrum corresponding to that of beta electrons of Y -90 [5]. The Fluka Monte 
Carlo code was used to calculate the voxel dose kernel (VDK) in tissue. All pertinent interactions were turned on during the simulations and up to 10
9 histories were simula ted 
to reduce the uncertainties.  
 
Care has to be taken in order to properly process the measured activity Ap (activity due to 
positrons). Current Siemens PET/CT scanners do not provide an option for specifying 
imaging -related parameters for Y -90 isotope. Therefore Y -86 template was used in our 
image acquisition procedure, which has its own tracer parameters that are different from those of Y -90. However, the Y -86 template can be used during image acquisition as long 
as one experimentally determines the cal ibration factor γ for Y -90 microspheres using the 
same PET scanner that is used for the subsequent in- patient dose reconstruction (one 
must use the same imaging template for determining the calibration factor as well as for 
patient scanning). It is interes ting to note that in this case the herein defined calibration 
factor γ is the ratio between the branching ratios of Y -90 and Y -86. 
 
The calibration factor γ for the Siemens Biograph 16 slice PET/CT scanner available at our center was determined by [CONTACT_271621] g 740 MBq of 
90Y-chloride into a 1 L water bag. 
Subsequently, the ”hot” water bag was scanned together with a ”cold” identical size water bag using the PET scanner (to account for the scanner’s noise). After the scan, the activity in the “cold” water bag w as subtracted from the activity value of the bag 
containing 90Y -chloride. The corrected measured activity was divided by [CONTACT_581771] (an average value for the calibration factor was o btained out of seven measurements) that will be used in dose 
calculations of every patient treated with microspheres.

7.1.1 Adverse Events (AE) is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) pro duct, treatment or procedure regardless of 
whether it is considered related to the medical treatment or procedure (NCI CTEP 
Guidelines March 28, 2011)  
 
7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is an AE that is fatal or life threatening, requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_157748] (for > 
24 hours), persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or is a congenital anomaly/ birth defect, or results in any important med ical event that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12475], based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of t he above outcomes.  A “life -
threatening” adverse event places the patient at immediate risk of death in the judgment of the investigator or sponsor.  
 
7.1.3 Severity Rating  
The investigator will evaluate the severity of each adverse event.  NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v.4.0) or study specific toxicity tables provided in the protocol define severity.  If not included in CTCAE v.4.0, severity is expressed in numerical grade using the following definitions:  
 
1. Grade 1: Mild -asym ptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic 
observations only; intervention not indicated. 
2. Grade 2: Moderate -minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age appropriate instrumental ADL.  
3. Grade 3: Severe- severe or medically significant but not immediately life -
threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
4. Grade 4: Life- threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
5. Grade 5: Death related to AE  
 
7.1.4 Attributi on/Relationship to study drug  
 
1. Definite – clearly related

related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol, any 
applicable investigator brochure, and the current IRB -approved informed 
consent document, and (b) other relevant sources of information, such as product labeling and package inserts: or  
 
2. The expected natural progression of any underlying disease, disorder, or condition of the subject (s) experiencing the adverse event and the subjects(s) predisposing risk factor profile for the adverse event.

1. Adverse events which meet all of the following criteria must be reported to all participating institutions for IRB submission within 2 weeks of notification of the event.   i. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the prot ocol-related 
documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
ii. Possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reas onable possibility that the incident, experience, or 
outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_3459]); and

(301) 827- [ADDRESS_764989] d ata.  The primary objective is to determine the relationship between radiation dose 
to 70% of the tumor volume and local control at [ADDRESS_764990] deviations to characterize the dosages received by [CONTACT_581781].  We will use percentages and frequency ta bles to evaluate other 
characteristics such at tumor histology, number of liver tumors per patient, and volume of liver tumors.  
We will determine the relationship between radiation dose and local control at 6 months using regression models with Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to account for within -
patient correlation. We will use logistic regression to adjust for potentially confounding factors such as tumor volume, primary histology, and SIR -Spheres versus Therasphere 
intervention.  We will also det ermine the relationship between radiation dose to healthy 
tissue, and side effects such as fatigue, nausea, pain and elevated liver function tests.  Each

MAA doses, and present the data graphically.  We wil l use the method proposed by [CONTACT_115525] & 
Altman (2007) to assess the agreement between the two methods.  Finally, in a subset of patients, we will explore the change in dose measured by [CONTACT_10052] -CT scan between day 0 and 
day 1.  The dose at day 1 will be adjusted t o account for the decay of the yittrium -90 using 
A=A0e -(0.693t/T1/2).  Observed changes in dose may be due to microsphere migration, and 
our main interest is to look for a systematic change in dose received based on this migration.  Sample size considerati ons 
We will power our study to detect a [ADDRESS_764992] deviation of doses will be 12Gy, and that approximately 60% of tumors will retain local control at [ADDRESS_764993] approximately 80% power to detect a difference of [ADDRESS_764994] a difference in the range of 12 -20 Gy (Day 0 –  
Decay -adjusted day 1).  Although we may not get a significant result, the point estimates 
may give an indication of whether the microspheres are moving. This level of certainty is felt to be appropriate for an exploratory aim.

APPENDIX I  
 
Tc-99m MAA scan protocol  
 
Purpose : To assess arteria l perfusion of the liver and the fraction of 
radiopharmaceutical tracer that will pass through the liver and lodge in the 
lungs.  
 
Agent:  Technitium -99m labelled MAA (Macro -aggregated Albumin)  
 Dose:  150- 200 MBq  
 Equipment:  Any large FOV gamma camera  
 Admi nistration:  The patient needs to have a trans -femoral catheter placed in the hepatic 
artery. The Technitium -99 labelled MAA is injected through the catheter 
into the hepatic artery by a qualified physician.  
 
Imaging:  The patient is positioned supi[INVESTIGATOR_581765].  
Analogue:  
• Anterior and posterior images of abdomen and thorax.  
Measure 700k - 1000k cts for abdomen and equivalent time 
for thorax.  
• Right lateral Abdo - same time acquisition as for Anterior.  
Digital:   
• 4 frames; 300”/ frame. [ADDRESS_764998] mode. 
• Image anterior and posterior abdomen  
• Image anterior and posterior thorax  
 
Analysis:  Draw ROI around whole of liver and whole of lung fields. Calculate G 
mean for liver region and lung region.  
 Calculate Lung/liver rat io 
 Interpretation: If lung/liver ratio is >10% then there is need for dose reduction of SIR -Spheres  
     
 
   
SPECT protocol:  
 
Copyright © 2014 Fox Chase Cancer Center® Extramural Research Program. All rights reserved.  
Amendment 5Ver. 9/ 30/[ADDRESS_764999] acquisition : 360 arc, using a body -contoured elliptic orbit, optimally obtaining  
120 (minimum of 60) projections at 15–25 s per projection (every  
3–6_angle), depending on the number of projections and sensitivity of the 
detector. The SPECT acquisition takes, on average, approximately 25 min. The images are acquired into a 128 x128 (16- bit) matrix, corrected for 
attenuation, a nd reconstructed using a 2- dimensional orderedsubset 
expectation maximization iterative technique (at least 10 subsets and 2 iterations are typi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], but the number may vary according to the manufacturer).  
 Processing : A 3-dimensional postprocessing filter, which should be specified in detail 
by [CONTACT_3455] (e.g., the Hanning postprocessing filter with a cutoff frequency of 0.85 cycles/cm) is typi[INVESTIGATOR_581766]. 
APPENDIX II  
 
PET/CT scan protocol  
 Purpose : To assess the treatment dose distribution, and potential calculation of dosimetry 
of Y-90 Sir -Spheres and/or Theraspheres.  
 
 Instrumentation: PET/CT scanner  (Siemens Biograph 16 in Fox Chase Cancer Center)  
  Postherapy Imaging: Within 5 hours after the a dministration of Sirsphere and/or 
Theraspheres, a PET/CT scan will be performed covering the liver area in order to verify 
localization of the Sirsphere/Therasphere in the targeted tumor.  A proof of concept for such a technique has been reported (3).   
 
 Parameters : The patient will be positioned on the PET/CT scanner with arms raised up, 
and a localization scout scan will be performed in the abdominal region.  A two- bed 
PET/CT acquisition will be set up centered on the liver.  A low dose CT scan will be 
performed followed by a 10 minute per bed PET acquisition. The PET data will be reconstructed using manufacturer recommended procedure, and the data will be analyzed to determine the hepatic localization of microspheres.  
 
 
For Subset of patients : Diagnostic (intravenous contrast) CT should be performed 
immediately after the PET scan without moving the participant, using portovenous phase for optimal visualization of the liver. The volume of IV contrast is per institution standard.

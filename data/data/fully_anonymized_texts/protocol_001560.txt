PRÉCIS 
Background:
Immune checkpoint inhibitors interfere with the immune system’s autoregulatory 
mechanisms, allowing for a potentially expanded and prolonged T-cell response with the 
possibility of greater antitumor effects.
Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-[ADDRESS_306083]-mediated inhibition of the immune 
response, including anti-tumor immune response. 
PROSTVAC (developed by [CONTACT_29630] [NCI] and licensed to Bavarian 
Nordic Immunotherapeutics, Mountain View, CA) is a therapeutic cancer vaccine for 
prostate cancer. Early studies have demonstrated immunologic efficacy and suggested 
clinical benefit.  A phase III trial has completed accrual.
A previous study combining the immune checkpoint inhibitor ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251649].  Additional studies have 
demonstrated the potential efficacy of immunologic combination therapy with the 
immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab.  
This study will aim to evaluate the impact of the combination of PROSTVAC and the 
immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab on the tumor microenvironment focusing on 
immune cell infiltration as the primary endpoint.  
US-MRI imaging technology will be employed to sample the tumor before treatment and 
after radical prostatectomy.  
The findings from this study could serve as the basis for future studies with this 
combination in this population of participants and more advanced disease.
Objectives:
Safety (For castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) lead-in cohort)
Evaluate changes in T-cell infiltration in the tumor after neoadjuvant treatment with 
PROSTVAC and nivolumab, relative to changes seen in a phase 2 trial with PROSTVAC 
alone in the neoadjuvant setting- [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] (For the neoadjuvant cohort). 
Eligibility:
Participants must have histopathological documentation of adenocarcinoma of the 
prostate prior to starting this study and evaluable biopsy tissue (e.g., unstained slides or 
blocks) available for analysis. 
For the castration resistant lead in cohort, if histopathological documentation is 
unavailable, a rising PSA and a clinical course consistent with prostate cancer would be 
acceptable.
Participants must have a performance status of 0 to 1 according to the ECOG criteria.
Hematological eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):

oGranulocyte count 1,500/mm3
oPlatelet count 100,000/mm3
oHgb ≥ 8 g/dL 
oBiochemical eligibility parameters (within 16 days of starting therapy):

bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/dL), AST and ALT ≤  2.5 times upper limit of normal.
oCreatinine ≤ 1.[ADDRESS_306084]
Design:
The primary focus of this study will be to evaluate PROSTVAC and nivolumab in the 
neoadjuvant setting. 
Lead-in cohort evaluating the safety and tolerability of this combination in the castration 
resistant setting (CRPC cohort)
Following this lead-in cohort in the CRPC setting, we will enroll a cohort in the 
neoadjuvant setting evaluating the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab. 
The lead-in safety cohort will require 10 participants and the neoadjuvant cohort will 
require 17 evaluable participants. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable 
participants, the accrual ceiling will be set to 29 participants.

1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE
It is expected that 26,120 men will die from prostate cancer in the US in 2016.[1-3] While some 
men are definitively treated for localized disease, many men will ultimately develop castrate 
resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and succumb to the disease; 2 this is due to the lack of an 
optimal treatment strategy. Treatment options typi[INVESTIGATOR_251650] (RP) or 
radiation therapy (RT) in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Following RP 
upwards of 50% of patients with high-risk disease will experience a biochemical recurrence at 5 
years, [4] and approximately 20% will die of their disease in 10-15 years. [5]  
1.2.1 Immunotherapy in prostate cancer
Vesalainen et al [6] found that the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary prostatic 
adenocarcinoma was independent of the tumor differentiation (Gleason score), and low numbers 
of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were an independently negative predictor of survival (n=325, 
P<0.05) suggesting a role the immune system may have in the control of this disease.
Several characteristics of prostate cancer make it an ideal target for immunotherapy.  Its 
relatively indolent disease course allows sufficient time to generate immune responses, which 
usually take weeks or months to mount. Therapeutic vaccines for prostate cancer offer a 
therapeutic approach and recent data have renewed interest in this form of treatment for 
metastatic prostate cancer.[7]  
The goal of therapeutic cancer vaccines is to generate a targeted immune response leading to 
immune-mediated anti-tumor activity.  Sipuleucel-T is a therapeutic cancer vaccine generated 
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from individual patients via leukapheresis. 
This vaccine is generated after a patient’s peripheral immune cells are collected via 
leukapheresis, transported to a regional processing center where they are exposed in vitro to a 
PAP/GM-CSF fusion protein. At the end of this process, the activated cellular product is re-
infused into the patient. A full course of therapy repeats this process 3 times every 2 weeks for 1 
month [8, 9].  A phase III trial (n = 512) demonstrated an overall survival benefit for the vaccine 
(25.8 months vs. 21.7 months; P = 0.032)[10]. Based on these overall survival findings, the FDA 
approved sipuleucel-T for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC, 
making it the first FDA-approved therapeutic cancer vaccine for the treatment of any 
malignancy. 
1.2.2 PROSTVAC
PROSTVAC, an off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine, offers an alternative strategy to 
enhance immune targeting of the tumor antigen, PSA.[11] PROSTVAC employs genetically 
altered poxviruses to deliver targeting information to immune cells and generate an immune 
response. Administered subcutaneously, the poxviruses deliver the transgenes for the tumor 
associated antigens (PSA) to cells including antigen presenting cells through cellular infection. 
Once these pox viruses are within the cellular cytoplasm, the transgenes are processed. The end 
result is an antigen presenting cell expressing a PSA peptide within the major histocompatibility 
complex, resulting in PSA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation.[11] (Figure 1) This 
approach does not require logistically complex, labor-intensive ex vivo preparation of patients’ 
peripheral blood. PROSTVAC is thus potentially more feasible and practical over the long-term 
than sipuleucel-T[12].

Early clinical trials demonstrated that PROSTVAC was well tolerated with common side effects 
including injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms.[13] PROSTVAC has subsequently been 
investigated in 2 phase II trials in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), both of which administered the 
vaccine at monthly intervals until disease progression. An industry-sponsored, placebo-
controlled, multicenter trial in 125 mCRPC patients randomized them 2:1 in favor of 
PROSTVAC; the placebo was an empty poxviral vector containing no transgenes. As was seen 
in the sipuleucel-T studies, patients receiving vaccine showed no change in progression free 
survival, yet had an overall survival benefit (25.1 months with PROSTVAC  vs. 16.6 months 
with placebo; P = 0.0061).[14]  (Figure 2) A second phase II study of PROSTVAC of [ADDRESS_306088] 
superior outcomes. [15]  
The immune impact induced by [CONTACT_251693].  Of 104 
patients tested for T-cell responses, 57% (59/104) demonstrated a ≥2-fold increase in PSA-
specific T cells 4 weeks after vaccine (median 5-fold increase) compared with pre-vaccine.  In 
addition, 68% (19/28) of patients tested mounted post-vaccine immune responses to tumor-
associated antigens not present in the vaccine demonstrating the ability of the immune response 
to expand once generated in vivo (antigen spreading).[16]  Based on the findings in these early 
trials, a phase III trial of PROSTVAC in mCRPC is currently underway ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).

1.2.3 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors 
[IP_ADDRESS] Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251651]’s autoregulatory mechanisms, 
allowing for a potentially expanded and prolonged T-cell response with the possibility of greater 
antitumor effects. [17]
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125], a fully human anti-CTLA-[ADDRESS_306089]-in-class immune 
checkpoint inhibitor. CTLA-4 is expressed on cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) after activation 
by [CONTACT_85804]. The CTLA-[ADDRESS_306090] to CD28/B7 binding, which acts as a 
costimulatory signal, the binding of CTLA-4 by [CONTACT_40105][INVESTIGATOR_251652], 
augmenting the immune response by [CONTACT_251694] B7.[17] Preclinical 
and clinical studies also suggest ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251653] T-cell avidity, decrease Tregs 
within tumor), and expand the T-cell repertoire. [18-20] 
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251654]-approved in 2011 for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma. The approval was based on a randomized (3:1:1) double-blind clinical trial that 
demonstrated an OS benefit in patients receiving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]; but, similar to the earlier trials 
involving sipuleucel-T and PROSTVAC, there was no short term change in disease 
progression.[21]  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_251655], because ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251656] a more non-
specific immune response, it characteristically has frequent immune related adverse events 
(irAEs).  IrAEs are mechanism-based adverse events and chiefly include skin and mucosal rash, 
diarrhea/colitis, hepatotoxicity, and hypophysitis.[21] Immunosuppressive agents such as 
systemic steroids are the standard treatment for many irAEs which are thus reversible.  For irAEs 
that impact endocrine glands, replacement hormones may be required.
Ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251657].  A recently completed phase III trial 
compared ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251658] (serving as an immune enhancing therapy) to limited 
radiation and placebo.  This study was conducted in advanced mCRPC, patients who had 
progressive disease on docetaxel and thus had only a limited expected survival (approximately 1 
year).  The study did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival, but results of this trial 
showed a median overall survival favoring ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251659] (11.2 vs. 10 months; HR 
0.85, 95% CI 0.72–1.00; p = 0.053.[22]  Interestingly PSA declines of ≥ 50% in evaluable

patients (13.1% vs. 5.3%) favored patients getting ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. In subset analyses, patients with 
more indolent disease features had a substantially improved survival if they were treated with 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251660] (22.7 vs. 15.8 months; n=142; HR 0·62, 95% CI 0·45–0·86; 
p=0·0038). These results support the concept that immunotherapy given earlier in the course of 
disease may yield greater benefit. [23]  An on-going second phase III trial of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251661]. 
placebo in chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC patients has completed accrual and results are 
anticipated in the next year ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Given that these patients have an earlier stage of 
disease, the results from this study will suggest whether this is indeed a more appropriate 
population of patients.
1.2.4 Anti-PD1 and Anti-PDL1
Agents blocking programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-ligand-1 (PD-L-1) 
are other examples of immune checkpoint molecules shown to have antitumor activity in solid 
malignancies. [24, 25]  These interventions represent a form of immune checkpoint inhibition 
disrupting the interaction between PD1 (e.g., on immune cells) and PDL1 (e.g. on tumor 
cells).[26] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Nivolumab
Nivolumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-[ADDRESS_306091]-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including 
anti-tumor immune response. 
Nivolumab was granted accelerated approval by [CONTACT_251695] 2014 for the 
treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and disease progression 
following ipi[INVESTIGATOR_164], if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Approval was 
based on objective response rate (ORR) and durability of response in the first 120 patients who 
were treated with nivolumab and had a minimum 6 months follow up from an ongoing, 
randomized, open-label trial in which 370 patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
received nivolumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks (n=268) or investigators choice of 
chemotherapy (n=102).  Patients were excluded from the trial if they had an autoimmune disease, 
a medical condition that required corticosteroids or immunosuppression, or a history of severe 
ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]-related adverse reactions. 
The major efficacy endpoints were confirmed ORR and response duration. The ORR was 32% 
(95% CI:23,41) with four complete responses and 34 partial responses. At the time of the FDA 
approval, five responding patients had progressed, while the remaining 33 patients (87%) had 
ongoing responses (range 2.6+ to 10+months).  Thirteen patients had ongoing responses of [ADDRESS_306092] common adverse reactions noted were rash in greater or equal to 
20%. Clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions included pneumonitis, colitis, 
hepatitis, nephritis, hypo and hyperthyroidism.[27] 
As of August 2021, nivolumab is FDA approved for 10 different cancers, some with multiple 
lines of approval [28]. As with all inhibitors of PD1/PDL1 signaling, nivolumab can cause 
inflammation in virtually any organ or tissue in the body. Per the Nivolumab Investigator

While there doesn’t appear to be significant activity of anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 targeted agents 
alone in prostate cancer outside of the ~5% of mCRPC that are MSI hi [29], it is likely because 
this is a T-cell poor tumor with little underlying immune response to unleash. [30] A vaccine 
could potentially turn this into a T-cell enriched tumor as described below.
1.2.5 Rationale to Combine Immunotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] 
[IP_ADDRESS] Immunogenic intensification 
One of the most compelling areas of study in immunotherapy is the effects of combining 
immunotherapeutic approaches, a process known as immunogenic intensification. Novel 
approaches such as combining vaccine with immune checkpoint inhibitors highlight the potential 
of immunogenic intensification, whereby [CONTACT_251696][INVESTIGATOR_251665] 
a greater immune response and enhance tumor-cell killing. [31] Previous clinical studies have 
shown evidence of enhanced clinical outcomes with manageable toxicity. 
A phase I study treated 30 patients with mCRPC with a fixed dose of PROSTVAC in 
conjunction with escalating doses of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251666]. No dose-limiting 
toxicities were seen and again side effects typi[INVESTIGATOR_251667].  Of the 24 
patients who were chemotherapy-naïve, 14 (58%) had PSA declines, six of which (25%) were > 
50%. The median OS of patients treated with this combination was 34.4 months.  This OS 
compares favorably to other studies with PROSTVAC and sipuleucel-T which employed vaccine 
alone in the same population with similar prognostic features. [32],[15],[14] 
As expected, the range of toxic effects identified exceeded those in single-agent studies 
involving PROSTVAC, where grade [ADDRESS_306093] common.  
However, the proportion of patients affected by [CONTACT_479] 3-4 toxic effects in this study (eight [27%] 
of 30 patients) was similar to previous phase I trials involving ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. [33],[34],[12]  These 
data suggest that the combination of a vaccine that enhances co-stimulation with an immune 
checkpoint inhibitor does not seems to be associated with increased immune-related adverse 
events compared with ipi[INVESTIGATOR_165]. [23]
A second phase I study that combined the whole tumor cell vaccine GVAX with escalating doses 
of ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125] (0.3 – 5 mg/kg) in patients with mCRPC.[35] Seven patients (25%) who received 
either 3 or 5 mg/kg ipi[INVESTIGATOR_251668] ≥ 50% while 2 patients showed a clear 
regression of bone metastases.  irAEs were similar in incidence and character to those that had 
been previously observed with single agent ipi[INVESTIGATOR_125]. 
15

Version Date: 01.10.2023
These findings provide a clinical proof of concept for use of an immune checkpoint inhibitor in 
combination with a therapeutic cancer vaccine in the treatment of mCRPC.  Given the limited 
toxicity profile of anti-PDL1 treatments, there may be stronger rationale for the use PROSTVAC 
and antiPDL1 in patients with prostate cancer, although randomized trials are required to 
estimate any potential clinical benefit of such treatments.
[IP_ADDRESS] Immune Response Can Drive PDL1 Expression in the Tumor
Preliminary data also suggests that an activated immune response, particularly those associated 
with increased INF-gamma in the tumor microenvironment can drive PDL1 expression on cancer 
cells, making it a relevant target for a PDL1 inhibitor.  Based on this rationale, not only would a 
therapeutic cancer vaccine potentially have a therapeutic anti-tumor impact, associated CD8 T-
cell activation and the ensuing production of INF-gamma could drive PDL1 expression on the 
tumor cells.  These data provide further rationale for the combination of a therapeutic cancer 
vaccine and anti-PDL1 therapy. [36]
Preclinical data with therapeutic vaccines suggests that one can give tumor associated antigen 
(TAA) based vaccines (where the TAA is a selfantigen and the tumor doesn’t express PDL1) and 
induce a response that leads to infiltration of activated T-cells and subsequent up-regulation of 
PDL1 expression (NCI preclinical data, not published).
1.2.[ADDRESS_306094] of these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_251669].  This proof of concept has been 
provided by a study of sipuleucel-T in untreated prostate cancer.  When given in the neoadjuvant 
setting prior to radical prostatectomy sipuleucel-t was associated with increased immune cells 
seen at the tumor/prostate interface (periphery of the tumor). [37]  A trial of PROSTVAC alone 
prior to radical prostatectomy ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has completed accrual and evaluation of the 
immunologic impact on the tumor is in progress. Data from that study will be used for 
comparison in this study.  
The data acquired from the tumor microenvironment in this study could provide the rationale for 
a larger clinical trial in this same population to determine if combination immunotherapy 
(checkpoint inhibitors and vaccine) could enhance cure rate or significantly impact time to 
disease recurrence.  In addition, data from this study could be extrapolated to more advanced 
disease and provide rational for combination immunotherapy in those patients as well.  The 
findings of this study could also contribute to biomarker development in the use of 
immunotherapy and immunotherapy combinations.

neoadjuvant immunotherapy.  This will provide an opportunity to evaluate qualitative and 
quantitative changes in the multiparametric MRI.  A previous study here at the NCI 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has demonstrated that immunotherapy combined with ADT led to substantial 
improvements in tumor density (i.e. decreased tumor density as measured by [CONTACT_251697][INVESTIGATOR_007]) in 
patients who received vaccine with ADT compared to ADT alone.  This will be prospectively 
evaluated in this trial.

1.2.7 MR-US Technology to Acquire and Compare Tissue prior to Treatment and after Surgery
The MR-US “fusion” approach pi[INVESTIGATOR_251670]. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_251671].  Such targeted biopsies will be evaluated in the men prior to 
neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy. All men will have a 3T MR examination and MR/US 
fusion guided biopsy will utilize custom biopsy probe with the embedded passive 
electromagnetic (EM) tracker that allows real-time tracking of the US image and needle location. 
3D reconstructed US volume will be registered and fused with the pre-biopsy MRI dataset. 
Continuous correction of rigid motion between the reconstructed reference 3D US volume and 
real-time 2D US images will enable tracking of the target lesions over the course of the biopsy 
procedure. The technical aspects and validation of this approach have been described earlier.[38] 
Biopsy targets identified in the MRI and re-identified in TRUS by [CONTACT_251698]-time US guidance. The EM tracking and fusion technology we plan to use for 
this procedure has been developed and thoroughly validated by [CONTACT_251699] 195 cases. [ 39, 40]  Data from these biopsies will establish baseline immunologic 
assessments of the tumor microenvironment.  
Custom made patient –specific MR based prostate gland molds : A 3D model of the prostate 
can be created in a novel technique developed and pi[INVESTIGATOR_251672] (Figure 
3), as described previously.[41] In brief it is a 3D model based upon MR images, which begins 
with manual segmentation of the MR T2W images.  The prostate is outlined and converted via 
software into a 3D object. This is then imported into SolidWorks (SolidWorks, Dassault 
Systèmes SolidWorks Corp., Concord, MA, [LOCATION_003]). There it is subtracted to create an internal 
cavity that precisely shapes the patients’ gland. Slots for slicing the gland at 6mm intervals are 
designed and orientation markings (Superior/Inferior, Right/Left etc.) are added and it is then 
created using a 3D printer

performed on the tissue from the index lesion(s).  This unique tool allows for the most accurate 
alignment of the prostate specimen to MR images that is available today. This resource available 
here at the NCI will be essential for the success of this proposal allowing for precise validation 
of in vivo imaging studies by [CONTACT_251700].

3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 STUDY DESIGN
3.1.1 Rationale for Serial Cohort Design
The primary focus of this study will be to evaluate PROSTVAC and nivolumab in the 
neoadjuvant setting. However, given the concern that treating with these agents prior to radical 
prostatectomy may delay or compromise definitive radical prostatectomy (due to systemic 
adverse events or local inflammation) we will have a lead-in cohort evaluating the safety and 
tolerability of this combination in the castration resistant setting.  
Participants in this initial cohort will be enrolled not more than 3 a week.
Following this lead-in cohort in the CRPC setting, we propose a cohort in the neoadjuvant setting 
evaluating the combination of PROSTVAC and nivolumab.

PROSTVAC-F (fowlpox) will be administered subcutaneously in an extremity (e.g., thigh) at a 
dose of 1x109 infectious units.
3.2.2 Nivolumab
Nivolumab is to be administered as a flat dose of 240 mg or 480 mg over approximately 30-
minutes via IV infusion, using a volumetric pump with a 0.2/1.2 micron in-line filter at the 
protocol-specified dose. Nivolumab injection can be infused undiluted or diluted so as not to 
exceed a total infusion volume of 160 mL. Nivolumab may be diluted with 0.9% sodium 
chloride injection, USP or 5% dextrose injection, USP. It is not to be administered as an IV push 
or bolus injection.  At the end of the infusion, flush the line with a sufficient quantity of normal 
saline.

assess levels of organ function required for eligibility (see Section 2.1) after each treatment in 
order to receive a subsequent treatment. Participants who experience irAE may continue 
PROSTVAC alone if irAE appears to be driven by [CONTACT_20382]. In such circumstances, 
investigator will discuss fully the potential risks with the participant and document that 
conversation appropriately. Any dosing interruption lasting > [ADDRESS_306108] dose will 
require participants to be removed from protocol with the following exceptions:
Dosing interruptions to allow for prolonged steroid tapers to manage drug-related
adverse events are allowed. Tumor imaging assessments should continue as per
protocol even if dosing is interrupted
Dosing interruptions > [ADDRESS_306109] dose that occur for non-drug-related 
reasons may be allowed 
For subjects with mCRPC who have stopped receiving nivolumab because of grade 3 
or higher irAEs, nivolumab could be re-started if the participant had partial response 
according Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG 3) and RECIST 1.1 criteria but 
subsequently develops PSA progression (by [CONTACT_43877] 3) while on PROSTVAC alone.

3.6, they will be seen at NIH, if logistically feasible, for a safety visit within 4-5 weeks for Lead-
in mCRPC cohort and 6-8 weeks for neoadjuvant cohort of drug discontinuation.  The safety 
assessments may be performed by a local physician and laboratory if participants unable to 
return to the NIH Clinical Center at this time. 
The following assessments will be performed at the follow up safety visit:
History and Physical Examination
CBC with differential and platelet count, prothrombin time/INR, activated partial 
thromboplastin time
Serum chemistries (Na+, K+, Cl-, CO2, BUN, creatinine, glucose, AST/ALT, bilirubin, 
calcium, phosphorous, albumin, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, ionized 
calcium, amylase, lipase, total protein, uric acid), TSH
Serum PSA level
Adverse event reporting  
After the safety visit, if there are no unresolved grade 3 or higher AEs, we will offer participants 
the opportunity to enroll on our long term follow up study.  If there are unresolved grade 3 – 4 
AEs, participants will be followed either at the NIH Clinical Center or by [CONTACT_250251].  
In the latter case, we will obtain the physician’s record of AEs.
Any scans performed outside of the NIH will also be obtained when possible.  
3.[ADDRESS_306115]-STUDY EVALUATION
In 2006, the FDA excluded pox virus based vaccine platforms from required long term follow-
up. Following this guidance in 2006 we haven't built in long term follow-up for our pox-viral 
studies as such vectors have not been shown to have a propensity to integrate or reactivate 
following latency and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, present a low risk of gene 
therapy-related delayed adverse events. Therefore no long term follow up is required with this 
study, though participants will be offered the opportunity to enroll on our long term follow up 
study.
4 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS/MEASURES
Subjects must inform the investigators of the current or planned use or all other medications 
during the study (including prescription medications, vitamins, herbal and nutritional 
supplements, and over-the-counter medications).

Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.[ADDRESS_306116] 
complete that course of therapy and be free of evidence of further infection before receiving any 
immunotherapy treatment. Antibiotics for prophylaxis are allowed while on treatment. 
Concurrent systemic corticosteroid use (daily or every other day for continued use > 14 days) 
should be avoided within [ADDRESS_306117] planned dose of PROSTVAC.  Use of inhaled 
steroids, nasal sprays, and topi[INVESTIGATOR_251677]. Limited use of steroids 
is allowed on study (e.g., for immune related adverse events or for premedication for imaging).
Symptomatic anemia should be treated with appropriate red blood cell or erythropoietin support.
Thrombocytopenia should be treated conservatively. In the absence of bleeding or a planned 
invasive procedure, platelet transfusions should be given for a platelet count below 10,000/mm3. 
If invasive procedures are planned or the participant develops bleeding, platelet transfusions 
should be administered in accordance with the standard of practice, usually maintaining a platelet 
count of > 50,000/mm3.
Any evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolytic uremic syndrome 
(HUS), or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) including thrombocytopenia, hemolytic 
anemia, renal failure, fever or neurologic changes should be thoroughly evaluated and closely 
monitored and supported as clinically indicated.
A standard of care radical prostatectomy will be performed between week 5 and week 12 to 
allow for logistical constraints, but ideally as close to week 9 as possible. This may occur at NIH 
or at an outside institution. Surgical specimens will be requested for research use (Section 5). 
5 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH
5.1 IMMUNE CELL INFILTRATE (TISSUE SPECIMENS)
Slides made from prostate biopsy specimens (collected at baseline) and prostatectomy specimens 
(collected at surgery performed after last dose of vaccine) will be stained for CD4 and CD8 cells 
and digitized for analysis of immune cell infiltrate. Other markers such as CD4/FoxP3 may also 
be stained for further correlative studies. These studies will be performed by [CONTACT_251704]. At a minimum, [ADDRESS_306118] with Dunn’s 
multiple comparisons, or alternative statistical models will be used as appropriate. Aperio 
ScanScope digital scanner systems with Aperio ImageScope software algorithms will be used. 
Manual quantitation will be performed in case of software malfunction. Isotype antibodies

negative controls will be included in all runs. Tonsil or lymph node tissue will be positive control 
for CD4 and CD8. Slides will be developed with primary and secondary antibodies per 
manufacturer specifications for visualization of cells.

5.1.1 Sera Antibody Analysis 
Serum will be stored at -80 degrees Celsius and there will be planned analysis for generation of 
antibodies to PSA, BCG, PAP, PSMA, PSCA, and/or MUC-[ADDRESS_306123]. Jeffrey Schlom.   
Unlike previous studies involving PROSTVAC, which evaluated immune responses to a single 9 
amino acid section of the 244 amino acid PSA protein, the immune analysis in this trial will 
evaluate overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_007] 15 amino acid sequences of the entire PSA protein. This more extensive 
analysis will provide a more thorough understanding of the immune response initiated by 
38
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
PROSTVAC and a greater opportunity for clinical correlations.   This type of analysis has not 
been previously prospectively performed in localized prostate cancer participants.  Advantages 
of this approach include the ability to assess both CD4 and CD8 T cells, identification of 
multifunctional T cells (those producing ≥2 cytokines), and identification of T lymphocytes with 
lytic potential (CD107a expression). (Table 1).
       
A positive “response” will be defined as increased CD107a expression or increased intracellular 
cytokine production for given antigen for CD4 or CD8 cells. For example, Participant #2 in 
Table 1 will be scored has having 5 responses (CD4: INFg, TNF and CD8: CD107a, INFg and 
TNF). 
In order to give added weight to the spread antigens (MUC1 and Brachyury) they will be 
weighted 150% higher than PSA antigens. Thus, the scoring will be as follows: 
For PSA: 
1 point each of the four CD4 parameters (CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) – max total of 4 
1 point each of the four CD8 parameters (CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α) – max total of 4 
Total possible score for PSA response is 8 
For MUC1: 
1.5 points each of the four CD4 parameters (CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α)  – max total of 6 
1.5 points each of the four CD8 parameters (CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α)  – max total of 6 
Table 1.  Preliminary Data from a trial of Prostvac in mCRPC.  This table shows how this multi 
peptide approach can be used in this proposal.  In this previous (unpublished) trial, 2 cohorts of patients 
were evaluated using the proposed methods.  (Responses are listed as absolute # of CD4 or CD8 T 
Lymphocytes Producing Cytokine or Positive for CD107a per 1x106 cells plated.)  This readout shows 
the breadth of this analysis as both CD4 and CD8 tell cells are evaluated using multiple parameters 
(cytokine production signifying activation – IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α)  and lytic potential as measured by 
[CONTACT_398]107a expression.  Had only one peptide been used to analyze this immune response it is likely that 
many of these immune responders would not have been identified. (unpublished).

Total possible score for PSA response is 12. 
For Brachyury: 
1.5 points each of the four CD4 parameters (CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α)  – max total of 6 
1.5 points each of the four CD8 parameters (CD107a, IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α)  – max total of 6 
Total possible score for PSA response is 12.
5.1.3 Flow Cytometry Analysis of Immune subsets (Biomarker Development)
As part of the extensive immune interrogation, peripheral immune cells will be evaluated by 30 
markers to assess 127 immune subsets. (Table 2)  This methodology has been previously 
described [43] . This added analysis will provide preliminary data to develop a Peripheral 
Immunoscore based on the frequency of specific pre-determined immune cell subsets in the 
blood of participants prior to therapy.  The score is calculated from the changes in frequency of 
certain immune cell subsets after vaccine treatment. The resultant panel of markers would reflect 
immune response to the vaccine.

slides and examined, cytokeratin-positive/CD45-negative cells with an intact nucleus and a 
malignancy-consistent morphology are identified as CTCs, and their exact positions on the 
slides recorded. This technology has the advantage of being able to identify cells that may be 
CTC but cytokeratin negative. Since positive or negative selection is not needed, all 
circulating cells are captured and analyzed via proprietary technology, to include multiplex 
analysis.
The evaluation of CTCs may give valuable insight into how treatment affects changes in 
CTC quantity and phenotype, such as AR splice variants, and how such changes are 
associated with clinical outcomes.
Blood collection:
At baseline and at one later timepoint (as close as possible to the time of planned prostatectomy 
or week 9 for initial safety cohort), one 10 mL Streck Cell-Free DNA (brown-black top) tube 
will be collected. [CONTACT_62583]’s lab will be paged at 102-[ZIP_CODE] for tube pi[INVESTIGATOR_251678]. These samples will be sent in ambient shippers 
provided by [CONTACT_195245]. Alternatively, PBMCs collected 
and stored at -80°C for immunology assays may also be shipped to Epic Sciences for CTC 
analysis. Samples will be shipped to the following address:
Epic Sciences
[ADDRESS_306125], Ste. 200
San Diego, CA  [ZIP_CODE]
  
5.2 SAMPLE STORAGE, TRACKING AND DISPOSITION
Samples will be ordered in CRIS and tracked through a Clinical Trial Data Management system.  
Should a CRIS screen not be available, the CRIS downtime procedures will be followed.  
Samples will not be sent outside NIH without appropriate approvals and/or agreements, if 
required.
5.2.[ADDRESS_306126]. Figg’s Blood Processing Core (BPC)
All samples processed by [CONTACT_251705] (BPC) will be barcoded, with data entered 
and stored in the Labmatrix utilized by [CONTACT_74908]. This is a secure program, with access to 
Labmatrix limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued individual user accounts. 
Installation of Labmatrix is limited to computers specified by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Figg. These computers all have 
a password restricted login screen. 
Labmatrix creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to participants without Labmatrix access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
participant ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material 
type, as well as box and freezer location. Participant demographics associated with the clinical 
center participant number are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated 
with the processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).

45
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20 or -80◦C 
according to stability requirements. These freezers are located onsite in the BPC and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are 
required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_79922]. Access to stored clinical samples is 
restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a researcher named on the protocol. All 
requests are monitored and tracked in Labmatrix. All researchers are required to sign a form 
stating that the samples are only to be used for research purposes associated with this trial (as per 
the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the 
responsibility of the NCI Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_251679] a manner consistent with IRB approval.
5.2.2 Samples Sent to Clinical Services Program (CSP)
All data associated with participant samples is protected by [CONTACT_2329] a secure database. All Clinical 
Support Laboratory Staff receive annual training in maintaining records’ confidentiality. All 
samples drawn at the NIH Clinical Center will be transported to the Clinical Support Laboratory 
at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research by [CONTACT_251706].
Samples will be tracked and managed by [CONTACT_195246], where there is no link 
to personal identifiable information. All samples will be stored in either a -80˚C freezer or vapor 
phase liquid nitrogen. These freezers are located at NCI Frederick Central Repository in 
Frederick, Maryland.
NCI-Frederick Central Repositories (managed under a subcontract) store, among other things, 
biological specimens in support of NIH clinical studies. All specimens are stored in secure, 
limited access facilities with sufficient security, back up and emergency support capability and 
monitoring to ensure long-term integrity of the specimens for research. 
Specimens are stored in accordance will applicable HHS and FDA Protection of Human Subjects 
Regulations in accordance with the subcontractor’s Federal-wide Assurance.  The 
subcontractor’s role is limited to clinical research databases and repositories containing 
participant specimens. The subcontractor does not conduct nor has any vested interest in research 
on human subjects, but does provide services and support the efforts of its customers, many of 
which are involved in research on human subjects.  The subcontractor’s IRB reviews policies 
and procedures for labeling, data collection and storage, access, and security. The IRB will 
review protection of privacy issues prior to acceptance of any new work and in the event of 
change impacting privacy issues in existing work.
It is the intent and purpose of the subcontractor to accept only coded, linked samples and sample 
information.  To the limit of our ability, every effort will be made to ensure that protected 
information is not sent electronically or by [CONTACT_251707]. 
Sample data is stored in the BioSpecimen Inventory System II (BSI). This inventory tracking 
system is used to manage the storage and retrieval of specimens as well as maintain specimen 
data. BSI is designed for controlled, concurrent access. It provides a real-time, multi-user 
environment for tracking millions of specimens. The system controls how and in what order 
database updates and searches are performed. This control prevents deadlocks and race 
conditions. For security, BSI has user password access, three types of user access levels, and 36 
user permissions (levels of access) that can be set to control access to the system functions. BSI

5.2.3 Protocol Completion/Sample Destruction
Once primary research objectives for the protocol are achieved, intramural researchers can 
request access to remaining samples, provided they have an IRB-approved protocol and 
participant consent.
Samples and associated data will be stored permanently unless the participant withdraws 
consent. If the participant withdraws consent the participant’s data will be excluded from future 
distributions, but data that have already been distributed for approved research use will not be 
able to be retrieved. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_138703] a 
deviation. Reporting will be per the requirements of section 7.2.1.
6 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION 
6.1 DATA COLLECTION
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_62482] a 21 CFR Part 11- compliant data 
capture system provided by [CONTACT_62550], consistency and 
timeliness. The principal investigator, associate investigators/research nurses and/or a contracted 
data manager will assist with the data management efforts. Primary and final analyzed data will 
have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an individual human subject participant.
All adverse events, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, 
regardless of severity, will be followed until return to baseline or stabilization of event.
Document AEs from the first study intervention, Study Day 1, through [ADDRESS_306128] study drug and through 
approximately 100 days, only adverse events which are serious and related to the study 
intervention need to be recorded.
An abnormal laboratory value will be recorded in the database as an AE only if the laboratory 
abnormality is characterized by [CONTACT_39132]:
Results in discontinuation from the study
Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms 
Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention

6.2.2 Genomic Data Sharing Plan
Unlinked genomic data will be deposited in public genomic databases such as dbGaP in 
compliance with the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy.
6.3 RESPONSE C RITERIA (A PPLICABLE TO CRPC COHORT)
Recent clinical studies evaluating checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors have shown that in a 
fraction of cases even if some new lesions appear at the beginning of a treatment or if the total 
tumor burden does not increase substantially, tumor regressions or stabilizations might still occur 
later. For the CRPC cohort of this trial, a modified immune related response criteria (irRC) based 
on RECIST 1.1 [44] will be used (See Appendix D, Section 16.4). Changes in the largest 
diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the 
case of malignant lymph nodes will be used as per RECIST 1.[ADDRESS_306129] 1.1 criteria (described below) except for 2 major 
changes:
1) require confirmation of progression by [CONTACT_62576] 4 weeks after initial imaging (evidence of 
progression of prostate cancer within the first 3 months on bone scan only should be interpreted 
with extreme caution due to risk of tumor flare) and
2) do not necessarily score the appearance of new lesions as progressive disease if the sum of
lesion diameters of target lesions (minimum of 10 mm per lesion, maximum of 5 target lesions, 
maximum of 2 per organ) and measurable new lesions does not increase by ≥ 20%.
6.3.1 Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity:  All participants will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first 
treatment 
Evaluable for objective response: Only those participants who have measurable disease present 
at baseline, have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated 
will be considered evaluable for response.  These participants will have their response classified 
according to the definitions stated below.  (Note:  Participants who exhibit objective disease 
progression prior to the end of cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)
Evaluable Non-Target Disease Response:  Participants who have lesions present at baseline that 
are evaluable but do not meet the definitions of measurable disease, have received at least one 
cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated will be considered evaluable for non-

target disease.  The response assessment is based on the presence, absence, or unequivocal 
progression of the lesions. 
6.3.2 Disease Parameters
Measurable disease:  Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in 
at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as:
By [CONTACT_13190] x-ray: >20 mm; 
By [CONTACT_3610]:
.1 Scan slice thickness 5 mm or under: as >10 mm;
.2 Scan slice thickness >5 mm: double the slice thickness
With calipers on clinical exam: >[ADDRESS_306130] be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).
Malignant lymph nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph 
node must be >[ADDRESS_306131] scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow-up, only the short axis will 
be measured and followed.
Non-measurable disease.  All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest 
diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered 
non-measurable disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses 
(not followed by [CONTACT_462]), are considered as non-measurable.
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
[CONTACT_108], simple cysts.
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non-cystic lesions are 
present in the same participant, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
Target lesions.  All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in 
total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions 
with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be 
those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which 
circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A 
sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diameters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable 
dimension of the disease.
50
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
Non-target lesions.  All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over 
and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be 
recorded at baseline.  Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, 
or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow-up. 
6.3.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 8 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging-based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by [CONTACT_460](s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by [CONTACT_461].
Clinical lesions:  Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers 
(e.g., skin nodules).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by [CONTACT_6775], including a 
ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest x-ray:  Lesions on chest x-ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by [CONTACT_6776].  However, CT is preferable. 
Conventional CT and MRI:  This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan 
based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is [ADDRESS_306132] slice thickness 
greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.  
MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (e.g. for body scans).  
Use of MRI remains a complex issue.  MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal 
resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly 
impact image quality, lesion conspi[INVESTIGATOR_3934], and measurement.  Furthermore, the availability of 
MRI is variable globally.  As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the 
scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease.  
Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up should be the same as was used at 
baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence.  It is beyond 
the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all 
scanners, body parts, and diseases.  Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the 
image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans.  Body scans 
should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible.
PET-CT:  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction CT portion of a combined PET-CT 
is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with RECIST measurements.  However, if 
the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET-CT is of identical diagnostic 
quality to a diagnostic CT (with IV and oral contrast), then the CT portion of the PET-CT can be 
used for RECIST measurements and can be used interchangeably with conventional CT in 
accurately measuring cancer lesions over time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT 
introduces additional data which may bias an investigator if it is not routinely or serially 
performed.  
51
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
Ultrasound:  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measurements will be taken from one assessment to the 
next.  If new lesions are identified by [CONTACT_12153], confirmation by [CONTACT_131811].  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be used instead 
of CT in selected instances.
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy:  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological 
response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence following 
complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint.
Tumor markers:  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are initially 
above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a participant to be considered in complete 
clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA-125 response (in recurrent ovarian cancer) 
and PSA response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have been published. [45-47] In addition, the 
Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA-[ADDRESS_306133]-line trials in ovarian cancer.[48]
Cytology, Histology:  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as 
germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease is 
mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side effect of 
the treatment) and progressive disease.
FDG-PET:  While FDG-PET response assessments need additional study, it is sometimes 
reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG-PET scanning to complement CT scanning in 
assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on the basis of 
FDG-PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm: 
Negative FDG-PET at baseline, with a positive FDG-PET at follow-up is a sign of PD 
based on a new lesion.
No FDG-PET at baseline and a positive FDG-PET at follow-up:  If the positive FDG-
PET at follow-up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by [CONTACT_4654], this is PD.  If the 
positive FDG-PET at follow-up is not confirmed as a new site of disease on CT, 
additional follow-up CT  scans are needed to determine if there is truly progression 
occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG-
PET scan).  If the positive FDG-PET at follow-up corresponds to a pre-existing site of 
disease on CT that is not progressing on the basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.
FDG-PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a biopsy in 
cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis or 
scarring.  The use of FDG-PET in this circumstance should be prospectively described in 
the protocol and supported by [CONTACT_4623]-specific medical literature for the indication.  
However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positive CR 
due to limitations of FDG-PET and biopsy resolution/sensitivity.
52
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
 Note:  A ‘positive’ FDG-PET scan lesion means one which is FDG avid with an uptake greater 
than twice that of the surrounding tissue on the attenuation corrected image.
6.3.4 Response Criteria
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progressions).
Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level.  All lymph nodes must be non-pathological in size (<10 mm short axis).
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a 
participant to be considered in complete clinical response.
Non-CR/Non-PD: Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor 
marker level above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesions.  Unequivocal progression should not normally trump 
target lesion status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.    
Although a clear progression of “non-target” lesions only is exceptional, the opi[INVESTIGATOR_12999], and the progression status should be 
confirmed at a later time by [CONTACT_463] (or Principal Investigator).
[IP_ADDRESS] Metastatic Bone Lesions
Disease progression is considered if a minimum of two new lesions is observed on bone scan.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The participant's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Duration of overall response:  The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that 
recurrent or progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR

treatment started, including the baseline measurements. 
6.3.6 Progression-Free Survival
[IP_ADDRESS] Serologic Response
PSA will be assessed at each visit during treatment and every 12 weeks thereafter.  Participants 
will be assigned response based on the following criteria.
Complete Serological Response:  PSA level less than 0.2 ng/ml measured for [ADDRESS_306135] 4 weeks apart.
Serological Partial Response:  decline of PSA at least 50% measured for [ADDRESS_306136] 4 weeks apart.
Serological Progression:  
Serological progression will only be measured once PSA has risen above 4 ng/ml 
and this value must be 50% above the PSA level before commencing ADT and;
Increase in PSA more than 50% of nadir (lowest PSA on ADT).  
Values must be measured for [ADDRESS_306137] 2 weeks apart.

62
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.[ADDRESS_306150] and the adverse event.  CCR will notify FDA and all participating investigators (i.e., all 
investigators to whom the sponsor is providing drug under its INDs or under any investigator’s 
IND) in an IND safety report of potential serious risks from clinical trials or any other source, as 
soon as possible, in accordance to [ADDRESS_306151] annually in a summary format.
8.7 SPONSOR PROTOCOL DEVIATION REPORTING
A Protocol Deviation is defined as any non-compliance with the clinical trial Protocol, Manual 
of Operational Procedures (MOP) and other Sponsor approved study related documents, GCP, or 
protocol-specific procedural requirements on the part of the participant, the Investigator, or the 
study site staff inclusive of site personnel performing procedures or providing services in support 
of the clinical trial.
It is the responsibility of the study Staff to document any protocol deviation identified by [CONTACT_83943] (PDTS) online 
application. The entries into the PDTS online application should be timely, complete, and 
maintained per CCR PDTS user requirements. 
In addition, any deviation to the protocol should be documented in the participant’s source 
records and reported to the reviewing IRB per their guidelines. OSRO required protocol 
deviation reporting is consistent with E6(R2) GCP: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1): 4.5 
Compliance with Protocol; 5.18.3 (a), and 5.20 Noncompliance; and ICH E3 16.2.2 Protocol 
deviations.
9 CLINICAL MONITORING 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure:
that the rights of the participants are protected; 
that the study is implemented per the approved protocol, Good Clinical Practice and 
standard operating procedures; and, 
the quality and integrity of study data and data collection methods are maintained.  
Monitoring for this study will be performed by [CONTACT_83944] (OSRO) Sponsor and Regulatory Oversight Support (SROS) Services contractor. 
Clinical site monitoring activities will be based on OSRO standards, FDA Guidance E6(R2) 
Good Clinical Practice: Integrated Addendum to ICH E6(R1) March 2018, and applicable 
regulatory requirements.
Details of clinical site monitoring will be documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP) 
developed by [CONTACT_62554]. CMPs will be protocol-specific, risk-based and tailored to address human 
subject protections and integrity of the study data. OSRO will determine the intensity and 
frequency of monitoring based on several factors, including study type, phase, risk, complexity, 
expected enrollment rate, and any unique attributes of the study and the site. The Sponsor will 
conduct a periodic review of the CMP to confirm the plan's continued appropriateness. A change 
to the protocol, significant or pervasive non-compliance with GCP, or the protocol may trigger 
CMP updates.

(SAV) (as warranted), followed by a Site Initiation Visit (SIV), Interim Monitoring Visit(s) 
(IMVs), and a study Close-Out Visit (COV).
Some monitoring activities may be performed remotely, while others will occur at the study 
site(s). Monitoring visit reports will describe visit activities, observations, and associated action 
items or follow-up required for resolution of any issues, discrepancies, or deviations. Monitoring 
reports will be distributed to the study PI, NCI CCR QA, CCR Protocol Support Office, 
coordinating center (if applicable), and the Sponsor regulatory file.
The site Monitor will inform the study team of any deviations observed during monitoring visits. 
If unresolved, the Monitor will request that the site Staff enter the deviations in the CCR 
Protocol Deviation Tracking System (PDTS) for deviation reporting to the Sponsor and as 
applicable per institutional and IRB guidance.
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
For the initial lead-in cohort, the primary objective is safety, especially detection of clinically 
important inflammation defined as a grade 3 diarrhea or colitis requiring steroids or anti cytokine 
therapy or not resolving to grade 1 or less within 28 days. If there are 10 participants evaluated in 
the lead-in cohort and if 0/[ADDRESS_306153] clinically important inflammation, then this will be 
considered acceptable for proceeding with the neoadjuvant cohort. On the other hand, if 1/[ADDRESS_306154] significant inflammation, then we will discuss with the IRB, FDA and sponsor 
amending the trial, since the upper one-sided 90% confidence interval on 1/10 is 33.7% which 
would be consistent with an excessive rate of inflammation.
After the lead-in cohort, participants on this study will be assigned to PROSTVAC and 
Nivolumab (neoadjuvant cohort) for [ADDRESS_306155] to the treatment groups.  The primary evaluation will be of a comparison of 
differences between the neoadjuvant cohort and participants treated on the 14-C-0112 protocol 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), of the changes of the CD3 + T cells, measured from baseline to the radical 
prostatectomy at 9 weeks on the present trial, and from baseline to the radical prostatectomy at 
12 weeks in participants treated on the 14-C-0112 trial.
With 17 total evaluable participants having both  CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T cell 
measurements from baseline to [ADDRESS_306156] 80% power to 
detect a difference between the cohort from this trial and that from the prior trial of a change in 
each type of CD3+ T cells from baseline to 9 weeks  (or baseline to 12 weeks in the 14-C-0112 
trial) equal to 1.0 SD of the change in the CD3 + T cells (1.[ADDRESS_306157] size) using a 0.[ADDRESS_306158] to allow adequate participants for a Bonferroni 
adjustment holding the overall significance level to 0.05 for both tests. In practice, a Hochberg 
adjustment may be used instead of the overly stringent Bonferroni adjustment. Also, if the 
distributions of the CD3 + T cells are not normally distributed (p<0.[ADDRESS_306159]), 
then a Wilcoxon rank sum test may be used instead of a two-sample t-test. The results from the

between the two trials.
Secondary objectives are to determine the change in peripheral PSA-specific T cells in 
participants treated with these vaccines; to document any intraprostatic Treg cell infiltration with 
CD4+FOX-P3 staining; to document any PSA changes secondary to vaccination, including rate 
of biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy; to document any MRI changes secondary to 
treatment; to evaluate changes in PDL-1 expression; and to document pathologic responses 
(including pathologic CR). When analysis is required, each of these endpoints will be analyzed 
using appropriate nonparametric methods when applicable and the results from these analyses 
will be presented without formal adjustment for multiple comparisons, but in the context of the 
number of such evaluations undertaken.
Slides made from prostate biopsy specimens (collected at baseline) and prostatectomy specimens 
(collected at surgery performed after last dose of vaccine) will be stained for CD4 and CD8 cells 
and digitized for analysis of immune cell infiltrate. Other markers such as CD4/FoxP3 may also 
be stained for further correlative studies. These studies will be performed by [CONTACT_251704]. At a minimum, [ADDRESS_306161] with Dunn’s 
multiple comparisons, or alternative statistical models will be used as appropriate. Aperio 
ScanScope digital scanner systems with Aperio ImageScope software algorithms will be used. 
Manual quantitation will be performed in case of software malfunction. Isotype antibodies 
negative controls will be included in all runs. Tonsil or lymph node tissue will be positive control 
for CD4 and CD8. Slides will be developed with primary and secondary antibodies per 
manufacturer specifications for visualization of cells. 
The lead-in safety cohort will require 10 participants and the neoadjuvant cohort will require 17 
evaluable participants. In order to allow for a small number of inevaluable participants, the 
accrual ceiling will be set to 29 participants. If 3-4 participants per month enroll onto this study, 
accrual is expected to be completed in one year.

12.6 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
This study involves clinical research with an experimental vaccine designed to generate an 
immune response against antigens found in prostate cancer. Participants will undergo multiple 
vaccinations.  Side effects of the vaccine are outlined elsewhere.  Whether the vaccine will have 
any clinical effect is unknown; therefore, benefit cannot be promised from vaccine in addition to 
standard of care, nor the chance of benefit accurately predicted.  
The aim of this study is to see if PROSTVAC vaccine in combination with nivolumab is safe for 
castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) participants and to evaluate changes in the immune 
cells in the tumor after treatment in all other cancer participants.  The study drugs may help to 
control the disease.  There is a possibility of benefit for participants in this study, though it can’t 
be certain.  
Participation in this study is voluntary, and refusal will not result in penalty or loss of benefit to 
which the participant is otherwise entitled.   
Participation may be discontinued at any time without penalty, and the participant will be 
encouraged to discuss any concerns or questions.

14 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
14.1 RECOMBINANT FOWLPOX-PSA(L155)TRICOM   
Other Names: PROSTVAC-F/TRICOM ; PROSTVAC-F
71
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
Classification:  Recombinant fowlpox virus vector vaccine of the genus Avipoxvirus.
Product Description:  Recombinant Fowlpox-PSA(L155)/TRICOM  is a recombinant 
fowlpox virus vector vaccine containing the genes for human PSA and three co-stimulatory 
molecules (designated TRICOM ): B7.1, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and 
LFA-3 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-3). The PSA gene coding sequence is modified to 
code for a single amino acid substitution [isoleucine to leucine at amino acid position 155 of the 
PSA antigen (designated L155)], which is designed to enhance immunogenicity. This modification 
occurs in a 10-mer, HLA-A2-restricted, immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_195197] [designated PSA-3 
(amino acids 154-163)]. An attenuated, live, plaque-purified isolate from the POXVAC-TC strain 
of fowlpox virus was used as the parental virus for this recombinant vaccine. A plasmid vector 
containing the modified PSA gene and the genes for the three co-stimulatory molecules is used 
for in vivo recombination between the plasmid vector and parental fowlpox virus genome. The 
recombinant vaccine is manufactured by [CONTACT_195255] (CED) 
cells with the recombinant fowlpox virus. Fowlpox virus can infect mammalian cells and express 
the inserted transgenes to stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity, but cannot replicate in 
non-avian species, making systemic infections unlikely. 
How Supplied: Recombinant Fowlpox-PSA(L155)/TRICOM is supplied by [CONTACT_135921], 
Inc. in vials containing 0.75 mL of the vaccine at a final viral concentration titer of 2 x 109 
infectious units/mL formulated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% glycerol.
Preparation: Thaw vials completely at room temperature. Ensure the thawed contents are at the 
bottom of the upright vial and vortex vigorously at high power for at least ten seconds prior to 
dose preparation. Withdraw 0.5 mL (1 x 109 infectious units) into a 1 mL syringe for 
administration by [CONTACT_22666].
Storage: Store intact vials of Recombinant Fowlpox-PSA(L155)/TRICOM at –70oC or colder. 
Stability: Shelf-life stability studies of the intact vials are ongoing. Once the intact vials are thawed, 
the vaccines maintain their potency for up to 4 days when stored at 2-8oC. Do not re-freeze thawed 
vials. Vials of Recombinant Fowlpox-PSA(L155)/TRICOM  are for single-use only and do not 
contain a preservative. Administer prepared doses as soon as possible following preparation ( i.e., 
within one hour). If necessary, store prepared doses at 2-8oC for up to 4 hours following 
preparation.
Route of Administration: Recombinant Fowlpox-PSA(L155)/TRICOM is administered by 
[CONTACT_22666]. 
Special Handling: Fowlpox virus is classified as a Biosafety Level [ADDRESS_306170] to 
personnel and the environment under ordinary conditions of use. Clinicians can use techniques 
generally acceptable for nonpathogenic material. The recombinant vaccine is a preparation of a 
live virus (infectious for birds) containing DNA sequences derived from the human genome. 
Handle the recombinant vaccine as a hazardous biological substance and dispose of waste 
materials as hazardous biological waste, with incineration according to local institutional policy

Preparation, Handling and Disposal Recommendations 
Strictly adhere to standard microbiological practices and techniques.
Limit/restrict access to preparation areas while dose preparation is in progress. 
Use appropriate infection control measures (e.g., thorough hand washing) after handling any 
materials.
Institute and follow policies for safe handling of sharps.
Perform all dose preparations in a certified Class II biological safety cabinet, generally using 
procedures, guidelines and personal protective apparel used during preparation of 
antineoplastic agents [e.g., minimizing creation of aerosols; no eating, drinking, handling 
contact [CONTACT_195257]; using appropriate personal protective 
apparel - gowns, sterile latex gloves (double-gloving is recommended), respi[INVESTIGATOR_195198], 
protective eye wear, hair cover]. 
Decontaminate the biological safety cabinet prior to dose preparation with sterile gauze 
soaked in 10% bleach solution (0.52% sodium hypochlorite solution), or other appropriate 
disinfectant suitable for decontamination, rinsing, then wipi[INVESTIGATOR_251685] 70% alcohol. Consult specific manufacturer’s recommendations with respect to 
disinfectant concentration, contact [CONTACT_195258]. 
Have all necessary supplies on-hand before beginning the preparation procedure. Develop a 
detailed worksheet outlining all supplies, dose calculations, and preparation procedures, and 
keep it available.
Place an empty biohazard sharps container lined with a leak-proof biohazard bag in or near 
the biosafety cabinet to dispose of all waste generated.
Transport the agent from the freezer to the work area in leak proof bag. 
Wipe or spray items used for dose preparation with 70% alcohol before placing in the 
biological safety cabinet. Disinfectants should remain in contact [CONTACT_195259]. Avoid exposing the virus to disinfectants.
Wipe the syringe containing the prepared dose with 70% alcohol before removing it from the 
biological safety cabinet; transport it in a leak proof bag or container labeled with a 
biohazard symbol.
Place all waste into the sharps container lined with the leak proof biohazard bag and 
decontaminate the biological safety cabinet again by [CONTACT_100411][INVESTIGATOR_195200] 10% bleach solution, or other appropriate disinfectant, rinsing, then wipi[INVESTIGATOR_195201] 70% alcohol. Following decontamination, dispose of 
personal protective apparel in the biohazard safety bag.

Patient Care Implications and Contraindications 
Cover vaccination sites with a sterile dry dressing (e.g., Telfa pad). Once the injection site is 
healed, no further barrier is necessary. As a precaution, protect injection sites that are exhibiting 
evidence of weepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], oozing or ulceration with a sterile dry dressing. In these circumstances, 
instruct patients to avoid direct contact [CONTACT_195260] (e.g.; 
those who may be immunocompromised by [CONTACT_195261]). Instruct patients to avoid 
fathering a child for at least [ADDRESS_306172] 72 hours after vaccination or while there are any visible lesions at the injection site.
Due to the method of manufacturing (virus grown in primary chicken embryo dermal 
cells), patients with a history of allergy to eggs or egg products should not receive the 
vaccine.

Product Description: Recombinant Vaccinia-PSA(L155)/TRICOM is a recombinant vaccinia 
virus vector vaccine containing the genes for human PSA and three co-stimulatory molecules 
(designated TRICOM ): B7.1, ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), and LFA-3 
(leukocyte function-associated antigen-3). The PSA gene coding sequence is modified to code 
for a single amino acid substitution [isoleucine to leucine at amino acid position 155 of the PSA 
antigen (designated L155)], which is designed to enhance immunogenicity. This modification 
occurs in a 10-mer, HLA-A2-restricted, immunodominant epi[INVESTIGATOR_195197] [designated PSA-3 
(amino acids 154-163)]. An attenuated, live, derivative of the Wyeth ([LOCATION_001] City Board of 
Health) strain of vaccinia virus is used as the parental virus for the recombinant vaccine. A 
plasmid vector containing the modified PSA gene and the genes for the three co-stimulatory 
molecules is used for in vivo recombination between the plasmid vector and parental vaccinia 
virus genome. The recombinant vaccine is manufactured by [CONTACT_251713] (CED) cells with the recombinant vaccinia virus. Vaccinia virus can infect mammalian 
cells and express the inserted transgenes, and is a potent immune stimulator, eliciting both a strong

Precautions for Healthcare Workers 
Recombinant vaccinia virus transmission risk to exposed healthcare workers is unknown. To 
date, no reports of transmission to healthcare personnel from vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_251686]. If appropriate infection control precautions are observed (such as covering the 
vaccination site and washing hands after contact [CONTACT_195262]), 
healthcare workers are probably at less risk of infection than laboratory workers because of the 
smaller volume and lower titers of virus in clinical specimens as compared with laboratory 
material. However, because of the potential risk for transmission, healthcare personnel who 
prepare or administer doses of recombinant vaccinia vaccine or have direct contact [CONTACT_251714]. Do not administer routine, non-emergency vaccination with the 
licensed vaccinia vaccine to healthcare workers, if they, or for at least three weeks after 
vaccination, their close household contacts (close household contacts are those who share 
housing or have close physical contact): 
1. have active eczema or a history of eczema or atopic dermatitis, or Darier’s disease.
2. have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions (e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella 
zoster, severe acne, or other open rashes or wounds), until the condition resolves.
3. are pregnant or intend to become pregnant within [ADDRESS_306174]-feeding.
4. are immunodeficient or immunocompromised (by [CONTACT_195261]), including HIV 
infection.
Additionally, do not administer routine, non-emergency vaccination with the licensed vaccinia 
vaccine to healthcare workers if the vaccinee:  
has a moderate or severe acute illness, until the illness resolves.
is less than 18 years of age, unless specifically indicated.
is undergoing topi[INVESTIGATOR_251687]; potential immune suppression increases risk for vaccinia-related 
complications. 
has a history of allergy or serious reaction to prior vaccinia vaccination or any of the 
vaccine’s components.

As a precaution, the CDC recommends that individuals with known cardiac disease (e.g., 
previous MI, angina, CHF, cardiomyopathy, stroke or TIA) or who have > 3 known risk 
factors for cardiac disease (e.g., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, first degree 
relative with onset of cardiac complications prior to age 50, smoker), not receive routine, 
non-emergency, prophylactic vaccination with the licensed vaccinia vaccine while a possible 
causal relationship between vaccination and cardiac events is being evaluated.
Avoid exposure to the recombinant vaccinia vaccine, any contaminated dressings, or other 
infectious materials from patients, or the patient’s inoculation site if you are pregnant or breast-
feeding; have a history or presence of active eczema or atopic dermatitis; have acute, chronic or 
exfoliative skin conditions; or, are immunocompromised. More information on vaccinia 
precautions for healthcare workers can be obtained from 
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5010a1.htm#tab2 and 
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5207.pdf.
The CDC is the only source of the licensed vaccinia vaccine. The CDC will provide vaccinia 
vaccine to protect laboratory and other healthcare personnel, whose occupations place them at 
risk of exposure to vaccinia and other closely related orthopoxviruses, including vaccinia 
recombinants. The vaccine should be administered under the supervision of a physician selected 
by [CONTACT_195264]. Revaccination is recommended every [ADDRESS_306175] Drug Services, National Center for Infectious 
Diseases, CDC at ([PHONE_4237].
Recombinant Vaccinia Vaccine Patient Care Implications, Contraindications and Potential 
Complications 
Patient Care Implications and Contraindications
Cover vaccination sites with a sterile dry dressing ( e.g., Telfa pad). Instruct patients on proper hand-
hygiene, sterile dressing care, bathing, laundering of clothing, etc. Treat patient bandages or 
dressings removed from the vaccination site as infectious waste and dispose in appropriate 
biohazard containers. Do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine if the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], or for at 
least three weeks after vaccination, their close household contacts (close household contacts are 
those who share housing or have close physical contact): 
have active eczema or a history of eczema or atopic dermatitis, or Darier’s disease.
have other acute, chronic, or exfoliative skin conditions ( e.g., burns, impetigo, varicella zoster, 
severe acne, contact [CONTACT_8748], psoriasis, herpes or other open rashes or wounds), until the 
condition resolves.
are pregnant or intend to become pregnant (due to the potential risk of fetal vaccinia); or are 
breast-feeding (due to the potential risk of contact [CONTACT_195265]). 
It is currently unknown if vaccinia virus or antibodies are excreted in breast milk.  Patients 
(i.e., vaccinees) should avoid fathering a child for at least 4 months following completion of 
therapy with the recombinant vaccine.
are in close contact [CONTACT_195266] 3 years of age (due to the potential risk of contact 
[CONTACT_195265]). 
are immunodeficient or immunocompromised (by [CONTACT_195261]), including individuals 
with HIV infection.

Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
Additionally, do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine if the vaccinee: 
1.has a moderate or severe acute illness, until the illness resolves.
2.is undergoing topi[INVESTIGATOR_195208], or undergoing therapy 
with systemic steroids; potential immune suppression increases risk for vaccinia-related 
complications.
3.At this time, until a more definitive causal relationship is determined, it is recommended that 
patients with known CHF or clinically significant cardiomyopathy, not be vaccinated with 
recombinant vaccinia-based vaccines, due to the potential for development of myocarditis 
and/or pericarditis. 
Although the CDC believes that there is no evidence to conclude that the licensed vaccinia 
vaccine used in the Smallpox Vaccination Program causes angina or heart attacks, it 
acknowledges a possible causal relationship between the vaccination and heart inflammation.  
The CDC continues to study the relationship, but in the meantime, recommends excluding 
individuals with underlying heart disease from participation in the current Smallpox 
Vaccination Program. Patients are being immunized with recombinant vaccinia vaccines with 
therapeutic intent and will be evaluated for cardiovascular risk factors and recent or 
symptomatic cardiac events per protocol eligibility criteria. Patients will be encouraged to 
minimize cardiovascular disease risks and encouraged to follow risk reduction according to 
standard medical practice.   
Due to the method of manufacturing (virus grown in primary chicken embryo dermal cells), do 
not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine to patients with a history of allergy to eggs or 
egg products. Do not administer the recombinant vaccinia vaccine to patients with a history of 
allergy or serious reaction to prior vaccinia vaccination (e.g., smallpox vaccination).
Potential Complications Associated With Recombinant Vaccinia Vaccination 
When vaccinia vaccine is administered by [CONTACT_251715], 
expected local reactions in individuals that have not previously been vaccinated with vaccinia 
include the appearance of a red papule in 3-[ADDRESS_306176] for weeks following healing of 
the skin lesion, considerable local edema, and intense inflammation from the vaccination (i.e., 
viral cellulites), which may be confused with bacterial cellulites. Systemic symptoms typi[INVESTIGATOR_251688] 8-[ADDRESS_306177] previously been vaccinated with 
vaccinia, expected local reactions include the appearance of a clear cut pustule 6-8 days 
following vaccination or the development of an area of definite induration around a central lesion 
that may be an ulcer or scab 6-8 days following vaccination. The response to re-vaccination 
depends on the degree of residual immunity following previous vaccination. Similar systemic 
symptoms may occur, but typi[INVESTIGATOR_22003] a lower frequency.

Information has been reported by [CONTACT_154437] (DoD) during the post-
vaccination surveillance assessment of adverse events in military personnel following 
implementation of a Smallpox Vaccination Program from the period of December 13, 2002 
through May 28, 2003. Although not directly comparable to historical numbers, due to 
differences in multiple population variables, estimated cases (number of cases per million 
vaccinations based on vaccination of 450,293 personnel, with a median age of 26 years and 
70.5% as primary vaccinees) of these same complications per million vaccinations were:

80
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.[ADDRESS_306180]-vaccinial 
encephalitis/encephalomyelitis. The complications of vaccinia vaccination may involve a number 
of different reactions:
Non-specific erythematous or urticarial rashes: These rashes can appear 
approximately 10 days after vaccination and may sometimes be confused with 
generalized vaccinia but are generally self-limiting. Patients are usually afebrile and these 
benign rashes usually resolve spontaneously within 2-4 days. Erythema multiforme can 
present as different types of lesions, including macules, papules, urticaria, and bull’s eye 
lesions (dark papule or vesicle surrounded by a pale zone and an area of erythema). These 
lesions may be extremely pruritic, lasting up to four weeks. Rarely, more serious bullous 
erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome) may occur, requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. 
Vaccinia Immune Globulin (VIG) therapy is not indicated to treat these rashes. 
Supportive care measures are warranted since these rashes are likely manifestations of an 
immune response or hypersensitivity reaction to the vaccine and are not likely to contain 
vaccinia virus.
Bacterial Infection: Vaccination site infection, most likely due to staphylococcus and 
streptococcus normal skin flora, is rare. Onset is approximately [ADDRESS_306181]-vaccination 
and is more common in children. Appropriate antibiotic therapy is required.
Inadvertent Inoculation: This can occur in the vaccinee (autoinoculation) as well as in 
close contacts (contact [CONTACT_195269]). Accidental infection is the most common 
complication of vaccinia vaccination, accounting for approximately 50% of all 
complications associated with vaccination and revaccination. This usually results from 
autoinoculation of vaccinia virus transferred from the site of the vaccination. Sites 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_251689], eyelids, nose, mouth, genitalia, or rectum, but can 
also involve the arms, legs, and trunk. Contact [CONTACT_195270], with 
accompanying toxicities, may occur when a recently vaccinated individual has contact 
[CONTACT_4490] a susceptible individual.  In a [ADDRESS_306182] commonly was in children  [ADDRESS_306183] transmission may result in a more severe syndrome than 
that seen in vaccinees, perhaps because of multiple simultaneous inoculations. About 
30% of eczema vaccinatum cases reported in the [ADDRESS_306184] transmission would 
be greater in today’s population, due to a largely unvaccinated patient population against 
smallpox. Contact [CONTACT_251716]. Most cases of inadvertent inoculation usually resolve without specific therapy 
and resolution of lesions follow the same course as the vaccination site in 
immunocompetent individuals. VIG can be used for severe cases involving extensive 
lesions or if comorbid conditions exist. VIG is contraindicated in the presence of isolated 
keratitis due to the risk of increased corneal scarring. VIG use can be considered in cases 
of ocular implantation, with keratitis, if vision-threatening or if other life-threatening 
vaccinia-related complications exist that require VIG therapy.  
81
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
Generalized vaccinia: Generalized vaccinia (GV) is characterized by a disseminated 
maculopapular or vesicular rash of varying extent on any part of the body and typi[INVESTIGATOR_195211] 6-[ADDRESS_306185] serious underlying 
immunosuppressive illnesses.
The differential diagnosis of GV includes eczema vaccinatum, erythema multiforme, 
inadvertent inoculation at multiple sites, and uncommonly, early stages of progressive 
vaccinia or other vesicular diseases (e.g. , severe chickenpox or disseminated herpes). 
Several publications have investigated the reporting of GV among those individuals who 
received smallpox vaccinations during 2003.  Out of 38,440 vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], 29 reports 
of possible GV during January 2003–December 2003 were identified but only 2 reports 
met the case definition. More than 75% of the reports received a final diagnosis of 
hypersensitivity reaction or nonspecific rash after review by [CONTACT_195272].  Of 74 cases 
investigated in 753,226 smallpox vaccinations administered in December 2002 to 
December 2004, 50 (67.6%) met the case definition of possible GV.  Cases occurred 
more frequently in primary vaccinees (rate, 81 per 1 million vaccinees) than in those 
revaccinated (rate, 32 per 1 million vaccinees).  However, none met the case definition of 
probable or confirmed GV, including 15 with virologically negative laboratory 
evaluations (e.g., culture, polymerase chain reaction, or skin biopsy).  Twenty-one reports 
of postscab lesions were made between January and August 2003 among 37,542 
smallpox vaccinees.  The lesions (scab and/or fluid) of seven patients were tested for 
vaccinia virus by [CONTACT_251717]/or immunohistochemistry; all 
were found to be negative.  In addition, the postscab lesions of four of the patients were 
biopsied.  The results from two of the biopsies suggested an allergic contact [CONTACT_8748], 
and results of one each demonstrated chronic dermatitis and squamous cell carcinoma.  
None of the four biopsied lesions had histologic evidence of viropathic changes and no 
evidence supported smallpox vaccination as a cause for any of the lesions.  
Eczema vaccinatum: Eczema vaccinatum is a serious complication in persons with 
eczema and other types of chronic or exfoliative skin conditions. It can also occur among 
eczematous contacts of recently vaccinated persons. Vaccinial lesions (generalized 
papular, vesicular or pustular lesions) develop on areas of the skin that are, or had at one 
time been, eczematous. These areas become highly inflamed and lesions may spread to 
healthy skin. The rash is often accompanied by [CONTACT_195274]. 
The fatality rate for untreated cases (prior to availability of VIG) has been reported from 
30-40%. Following availability of VIG, mortality was reduced to approximately 7%. 
Early diagnosis and prompt treatment with VIG is necessary to reduce mortality. 
Progressive vaccinia: Progressive vaccinia  is the most serious cutaneous complication, 
occurring when the local vaccination lesion fails to heal and develops progressive 
necrosis, with destruction of large areas of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and underlying 
structures. Progressive lesions may spread to other skin surfaces and to bone and viscera.   
Progressive vaccinia is associated with a high mortality rate. This complication has been 
seen in patients with a compromised immune system due to a congenital deficiency, 
82
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.2023
lymphoproliferative disease, immunosuppressive treatment, or HIV infection. 
Management should include aggressive VIG therapy.
Post-Vaccinial Encephalitis/Encephalomyelitis: Vaccinial complications affecting the 
CNS are unpredictable. Post-vaccinial encephalitis typi[INVESTIGATOR_195212] < [ADDRESS_306186] ranged from 15-25%, with 25% of patients who recover being left with varying 
degrees and types of neurological deficits. VIG has not been shown to be effective in 
treating CNS disease and is not recommended. Post-vaccinial 
encephalitis/encephalomyelitis are diagnoses of exclusion and are not believed to be a 
result of replicating vaccinia virus.  Although no specific therapy exists, supportive care, 
anticonvulsants, and intensive care might be required. A review of vaccinia-related 
deaths (68) during a 9-year period (1959–1966 and 1968) revealed that among first-time 
vaccines, 36 (52%) patients died as a result of post-vaccinial encephalitis.    
Fetal Vaccinia: Fetal vaccinia is a rare, but serious complication following vaccinia 
vaccination during pregnancy or shortly before conception (e.g., within four weeks).  To 
date, fewer than [ADDRESS_306187] been reported and often result in fetal or neonatal death. 
Efficacy of VIG therapy in a viable infant or used prophylactically in women during 
pregnancy is unknown. The CDC has established a National Smallpox Vaccine in 
Pregnancy Registry. This registry will follow women during their pregnancies and their 
babies, after they are born, to determine the outcome of such pregnancies. The CDC can 
be contact[CONTACT_6811] ([PHONE_4238].
Myocarditis/Pericarditis:  The CDC has recommended a temporary medical deferral to 
the voluntary Smallpox Vaccination Program for persons with heart disease or 
cardiovascular risk factors (March 25, 2003) and issued “interim supplementary 
information” regarding evidence that smallpox vaccination may cause myocarditis and/or 
pericarditis (March 31, 2003) in people recently vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine. 
The cardiac events reported include myocardial infarction, angina, myocarditis, 
pericarditis, and myopericarditis. Although the CDC believes that there is no evidence to 
conclude that the licensed vaccinia vaccine causes angina or heart attacks, it 
acknowledges a possible causal relationship between the vaccination and heart 
inflammation.  The CDC continues to study the relationship, but in the meantime, 
recommends that individuals with underlying heart disease be excluded from 
participation in the current Smallpox Vaccination Program. While it is currently not 
possible to fully evaluate the risk of cardiac events or the risk of myocarditis, pericarditis, 
or myopericarditis associated with vaccinia vaccination, it is reasonable to inform 
patients participating in studies using recombinant vaccinia virus of these reports and 
provide relevant guidance for evaluating these events. Further investigation from the 
ongoing vaccine program may provide additional data regarding an association or lack of 
83

Version Date: 01.10.[ADDRESS_306188] of 
Health strain of vaccinia from December 2002 through December 2003, 67 developed 
symptomatic myopericarditis.  In the 61 ECGs that were reviewed, an identifiable 
abnormality was evident in 46 (75.4%).  The most common abnormalities included ST-
segment changes observed evident in 40 patients (65.6%); 5 patients (8.2%) had normal 
variant early repolarization, and T-wave abnormalities were noted in 11 patients (18.0%).  
In addition, cardiac enzymes were elevated in 60 of 61 (98.4%) patients evaluated with 
this assay.  On follow-up of 64 patients, all patients had objective normalization of 
electrocardiography, echocardiography, graded exercise testing, laboratory testing, and 
functional status; 8 (13%) reported atypi[INVESTIGATOR_2855], non-limiting persistent chest discomfort.  
Among 37,901 health care workers vaccinated with the identical strain, 21 
myo/pericarditis cases were identified; 18 (86%) were revacinees. Twelve met criteria for 
either myocarditis or myopericarditis, and 9 met criteria for pericarditis only (6 suspected 
and 3 probable).  The severity of myo/pericarditis was mild, with no fatalities, although 9 
patients (43%) were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].
14.3 NIVOLUMAB
Amino Acid Sequence:   4 polypeptide chains, which include 2 identical heavy chains with 440 
amino acids and 2 identical light chains.
Other Names: BMS-936558, MDX1106
Classification: Anti-PD-1MAb
M.W.:   146,221 daltons
Mode of Action:   Nivolumab targets the programmed death–1 (PD-1, cluster of differentiation 
279 [CD279]) cell surface membrane receptor. PD-1 is a negative regulatory receptor expressed 
by [CONTACT_93247] T and B lymphocytes. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands, programmed death–ligand 1 
(PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), results in the downregulation of lymphocyte activation. Nivolumab 
inhibits the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and PD-L2.  Inhibition of the interaction between PD-1 
and its ligands promotes immune responses and antigen-specific T-cell responses to both foreign 
antigens as well as self-antigens.
Description:   Nivolumab Injection is a clear to opalescent, colorless to pale yellow liquid; light 
(few) particulates may be present. The drug product is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, single-use, 
isotonic aqueous solution formulated in sodium citrate, sodium chloride, mannitol, 
diethylenetriamine pentacetic acid (pentetic acid) and polysorbate 80 (Tween® 80), pH 6.0.

room temperature and room light conditions includes the product administration period.
Toxicity: The following related adverse events have been reported with nivolumab monotherapy 
at an incidence of  > 5%: fatigue, rash, pruritis, diarrhea, nausea, hypothyroidism, decreased 
appetite, and musculoskeletal pain. Immune-related adverse events have also been reported and 
may be severe or life-threating. 
Route of Administration:    Intravenous infusion.  Do not administer as an IV push or bolus 
injection.
Method of Administration:   Administer through a 0.2 micron to 1.2 micron pore size, low-
protein binding polyethersulfone membrane in-line filter. 
Potential Drug Interactions:  No incompatibilities between Nivolumab injection and polyvinyl 
chloride (PVC), non-PVC/non-DEHP (di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate) IV components, or glass 
bottles have been observed.
Destruction of nivolumab provided by [CONTACT_20444]:
On-site destruction of unused vials of investigational nivolumab should be conducted according to 
institutional standards.  A copy of the drug destruction certificate must be maintained for provision 
to BMS at the end of the study.

1. What vaccination site reactions can you expect?
2. How should you care for the vaccination site? 
3. Are there any activities I should avoid?
4. What about contact [CONTACT_195277]?
5. Who do I contact [CONTACT_152561] I have a question?
 1. What vaccination site reactions can you expect?
A typi[INVESTIGATOR_195219] a patient who has been previously vaccinated with vaccinia includes the 
appearance of a small swelling in 2-[ADDRESS_306192] 
very little skin reaction.   Often the leg that received the vaccine may become swollen.  Swollen or 
tender lymph nodes (“glands”) in the groin may be felt. A fever to 100-101F may occur on the 
second or third day.  You may notice that you feel tired for 3 or 4 days. The vaccination site may 
itch for about 2 weeks while the scab is forming.  You can take acetaminophen ("Tylenol") if you 
have any aches or fever but you should avoid aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248].  If fever continues for more than a day or 
two, you should call to speak to the clinic nurse or the research nurse. 
In patients who have never received vaccinia or in some who received it a very long time ago, a 
red swelling is followed by a blisters on day 5 to 6 and then the formation of a pustule (or "boil") 
1-[ADDRESS_306193] week leaving a scar roughly 1/2 
inch in diameter.  Fever and malaise (the "blahs") may occur during the blister and pustular phases. 
Swollen and tender lymph nodes may persist for months. Many of the local toxicities described 
(e.g., pustule and scab formation) are typi[INVESTIGATOR_195220]. These reactions may be seen, but are usually not seen 
when administered via subcutaneous injection.
 2. How should you care for the vaccination site?
Live vaccinia virus is in skin cells at the vaccination site during the 1-2 weeks until healing has 
occurred.  Maximal viral "shedding" from the vaccination site occurs from days 4-14, but can 
continue until the scab falls off from the skin. After that there is no vaccinia virus in your body.  
You can spread the virus to other parts of your body or to other people by [CONTACT_195278], mouth, a cut or some other break in the skin.  You do not pass 
vaccinia virus by [CONTACT_195279].
92
Abbreviated Title: Prostvac-Nivo in prostate ca
Version Date: 01.10.[ADDRESS_306194] to prevent transmission of virus.  You should also use two types of barriers over 
your vaccination site at all times until the scab is gone.  These barriers are (1) the bandage and (2) 
clothing (pants or elbow length sleeves depending on the site of vaccination).  These barriers 
should remain in place until the scab has fallen off.
For dressing care you will have a bag with some no-stick "First-Aid" or "Telfa" pads, disposable 
gloves, and zip-lock plastic bags.  If you run out of supplies between visits, you can use a dry 
sterile bandage (gauze or "First-Aid" or "Telfa") from the drug store.
The no-stick pad ("First-Aid" or "Telfa" pad) dressing should be worn until the site has healed.  If 
it remains clean and dry and is not coming off, you do not need to change it.  If the dressing gets 
wet either from drainage from the vaccination or from water when you are showering or if it starts 
coming off, you should remove it and put on a clean bandage.  Wear the gloves when handling the 
old dressings.  Put the old dressing and the gloves in the zip-lock bag, then wash your hands, put 
on the new bandage, and wash your hands again.  You do not need to wear gloves for the new 
bandage.  You do not need to wash the vaccination site, but while the dressing is off, you may 
wash it lightly with a cloth, soap, and water.  If you do wash, blot the site dry with a towel (don't 
rub), then put the wash cloth and the towel in the laundry.  Do not let the shower run on the non-
bandaged site because live virus could be washed onto other areas of your body. Do not put any 
steroid cream, medicated creams, or other ointments on the vaccination site.
Before you throw away the zip-lock bag with the old dressing and gloves in it, pour a little bleach 
(about a quarter cup) in the bag to help kill any virus.
Wash your hands after each step.
 3. Are there any activities I should avoid or take special care?
You should not go swimming until the vaccination site has healed and you no longer need to wear 
a bandage on it. 
If you wear contact [CONTACT_13276], have removable dentures, have a colostomy or any other "open" area on 
your body that needs daily care, always wash your hands very well before handling your contact 
[CONTACT_13276], dentures, dressings, etc.  Take care of all of these procedures before changing your 
vaccination dressing.
4. What about contact [CONTACT_195277]?
Remember, frequent careful hand washing by [CONTACT_195281].  During the time you need to wear 
a bandage (for a minimum of 3 weeks after vaccination) there are several kinds of people with 
93

Version Date: 01.10.[ADDRESS_306195].  "Close contact" means that you sleep in the same bed with 
the person, give the person baths, and/or touch their bare skin to change their clothes (or diapers), 
apply ointments, or change their bandages. 
The individuals you should avoid include children ≤ 3years of age; pregnant women or nursing 
women; individuals with eczema, history of eczema or other skin conditions such as active cases 
of extensive psoriasis, severe rashes, generalized itching, infections, burns, chicken pox, or skin 
trauma; and/or immune suppressed individuals such as individuals with leukemia or lymphoma, 
with AIDS, or those receiving immunosuppressive treatment (for example, after organ transplant).  
 5. Who do I contact [CONTACT_152561] I have a question?
If you have any questions at any time, please call.  A nurse or a physician is available 24 hours a 
day by [CONTACT_756].  To speak with the research nurse, call the research nurse’s office during regular 
business hours; if your question is not urgent, you may leave a message for the research nurse on 
the answering machine.  If your question is urgent or if you have a question outside of the regular 
business hour, please contact [CONTACT_941] 3NW inpatient unit and speak with the charge nurse. 
In an emergency, call 911 or report to the local emergency room/urgent care center.  If you have to 
go to an emergency room, please ask the doctors to call NIH for more information.

16.4 APPENDIX D: IMMUNE RELATED RESPONSE CRITERIA
Because of direct clinical observations of immune cell influx into tumor causing enlargement in 
some patients prior to sustained response, recently it has been suggested that clinical trials 
involving the use of immunotherapy use alternative guidelines, called immune related response 
criteria (irRC) to determine radiographic response or progression after therapy[49].  These 
recommendations have been used in recent clinical trials.  One study of 227 subjects with 
metastatic melanoma showed that the approximately 10% of patients who had PD by [CONTACT_251719], PR or SD by [CONTACT_251720] a similar overall survival as those patients 
who had SD, PR or CR by [CONTACT_119580]. The irRC was created using bidimensional 
measurements (as previously widely used in the WHO criteria).  We have taken the concepts of 
the irRC and combined them with the recently revised RECIST 1.1[44] to come up with the 
modified irRC used in this protocol.  Consistent with the irRC, the main changes from RECIST 
1.1 are (a) a requirement for confirmation of both progression and response by [CONTACT_135004] 4 
weeks after initial imaging and (b) not automatically calling the appearance of new lesions 
progressive disease if the total measurable tumor burden has not met criteria for progressive 
disease.  
For immune-related response criteria (irRC), only index and measurable new lesions are taken 
into account.  At baseline tumor assessment on this trial, target lesions will be measured along 
the longest axis and the measurements will be summed, called sum of largest diameter (SLD).  
These lesions must be a minimum of 10mm per lesion, maximum of 5 target lesions, maximum 
of 2 per organ system.  At each subsequent tumor assessment, the unidimensional measurement 
of target lesions and of new measureable lesions are added together to provide the total tumor 
burden:  As per the modified definitions below, all responses and progression except stable 
disease (SD) require confirmation on a consecutive scan at least 4 weeks from the initial 
observation). 
Definitions of irRC:
Response irRC
New measurable lesions Incorporated into tumor burden
New non-measurable 
lesions Do not define progression (but precludes irCR)
Non-index lesions Contributes to defining irCR (complete disappearance required)
Overall irCR 100% disappearance of all lesions, whether measurable or not, and no new lesions, in 
two consecutive observations not less than [ADDRESS_306196] reduction in short axis to <10mm.
Overall irPR ≥ 30% decrease in SLD compared with baseline confirmed by a consecutive 
assessment at least [ADDRESS_306197] documentation
Overall irSD Not meeting criteria for irCR or irPR, in absence of irPD:  30% decrease in SLD 
compared with baseline cannot be established nor 20% increase compared with nadir.
Overall irPD At least 20% increase in SLD compared with nadir (minimum recorded tumor

burden) and an increase of at least 5mm over the nadir, confirmed by a repeat, 
consecutive observations at least [ADDRESS_306198] documented.
Overall responses derived from changes in index, non-index and new lesions as demonstrated in 
the following table:

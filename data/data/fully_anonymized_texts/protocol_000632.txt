Study Design  A multi -center, prospective, single -arm stud y with follow -up at discharge, 30 days (± 7 
days), 180 days (± 30 days) and 12 months ( + 60 days, -30 days ).  Data will be analyzed 
according to nominal visit, e.g . 30 days, 180 days, 12 months as opposed to actual date.  
The intent -to-treat (ITT) population as defined below will be the primary population for 
all efficacy analyses and the safety population for all safety analyses. One hundred forty -
five (145)  subjects  will constitute the ITT  cohort, which is identical to the Safety cohort.  
These subjects were enrolled and treated at 23 sites located in [LOCATION_002] and Japan . 
Subjects are included in study analyses consistent with the prospective literature control, 
with efficacy and safety obj ective performance criteria ( OPCs) used to determine sample 
size.   
Two OPC sets will be considered in support of efficacy and safety as per the original 
protocol (primary) as well as more strict (supportive)  OPCs as follows:  
• Primary: Original PG specified in the protocol (45% for efficacy and 25% for safety)  
• Supportive: Updated PG presented to FDA at the  Feb 2017 meeting (46% for 
efficacy and 15% for Safety) .  
Study success is defined as achievin g statistical significance for the primary OPCs.  
 
Primary Analyses:  The po wers will be 80% to rule out a 45% OPC  (efficacy)  margin  
(lower bound)  and 80% to rule out a 25% OPC (safety) margin  (upper bound)  using one -
sided tests .  The trial will be considered successful if the one -sided 95% credible lower 
bound of the efficacy rate exceeds the 45% OPC and the one -sided 95% credible upper 
bound of the safety rate is below the 25% OPC.   The use of one -sided testing is 
consistent with the protocol.  
Supportive Analyses: The powers will be 90% to rule out a 4 6% OPC (efficacy) margin 
(lower bound)  and 90% to rule out a 1 5% OPC (safety) margin (upper bound) using tw o-
sided tests.  The trial will be considered successful if the tw o-sided 95% credible lower 
bound of the efficacy rate exceeds the 46 % OPC and the tw o-sided 95% credible upper 
bound of th e safety rate is below the 1 5% OPC.   The use of two -sided testing is 
consistent with the PI[INVESTIGATOR_339010].  
Follow -Up Schedule  All enrolled and treated subjects had follow up scheduled at  30 day ( ± 7 days), 180 days 
(± 30 days), and  12 months ( + 60 days, - 30 days ). 
 
Interim Analyses  No interim analysis are planned.  
Final Analyses  This SAP covers analyses planned for the FRED trial, designed to investigate the saf ety 
and eff icacy  of the FRED  during the course of treatment and through [ADDRESS_419065] -hoc, or unplanned, analyses not identified in this SAP 
will be clearly  identified in the CSR . 
 
2 PROSPECTIVE STUDY OVERVIEW  
 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 8 of 21  
  FRED  is a single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_339011] .  Current common therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], such as surgical or endovascular 
approach es, are not able to treat intracranial aneurysms with wide necks  effectively . Currently in 
the US, there is one flow diverter, the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_339012] (PED) , approved by [CONTACT_339021] s for Pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189], SIL K and the NeuroEndoGraft. 
Subjects enrolled into the study and treated with FRED  shall be followed at discharge and [ADDRESS_419066] considered enrolled but not treated because of a failed 
FRED  deployment  because of issues related  to the procedure  shall be closely monitored for one 
(1) week.  If the device entered the blood stream and the subject has an Adverse Event, that 
subject will have the 30- day, [ADDRESS_419067] ream and cannot be deployed secondary to technical issues with the device 
itself (e.g., FRED Device malfunction or failure to  access the target site due to the FRED 
Device), the Subject will be counted as enrolled with intent -to-treat. This will be conside red as a 
secondary endpoint failure. The Subject will be maintained within the study and will not be 
replaced by [CONTACT_339022]. If the FRED device never entered the subject’s bloodstream that 
subject will be excluded from all the analysis populations.  No additional analysis is planned for 
data collected beyond 12 months study follow up period. 
 
This study incorporates the use of an independent blinded Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  
which reviewed and adjudicated all the primary and secondary safety out come measures of the 
study , as well as all the adverse events and technical events reported in the study.  In addition, 
independent blinded Data Safety and Monitoring Board which provided study safety and efficacy 
oversight reviewed all the site -reported an d CEC adjudicated clinical data of the FRED study , 
and an independent angiographic core lab oratory  determined aneurysm occlusion and the degree 
of device stenosis reported by [CONTACT_41166]. 
2.1 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
All s ubjects enrolled into the study  and treated with the FRED  shall be followed as stated in the 
study protocol, at discharge and 30 day s (± 7 days), 180 days  (± 30 days ), and 12 months  (+60 
days, -30 days ): 
1. Discharge interval  shall include a clinical and neurological evaluation  
2. 30-day foll ow-up shall include a clinical and neurological evaluation  
3. 6-month follow -up shall include a clinical, neurological and angiographic evaluation  
4. 12-month follow -up shall include a clinical, neurological and angiographic evaluation

[ADDRESS_419070] hoc in the text of the CSR.  
Safety data will be review ed and adjudication of all adverse events reported in the study will be 
performed by [CONTACT_339024] l Events Committee  (CEC ); the CEC will also 
review all protocol deviations . Safety will be based on the CEC findings.  In addition, a Data 
Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review all site -reported and CEC -adjudicated clinical 
data.  These safety rev iews will be conducted only for the benefit of members of the DSMB  in 
accordance with the DSMB  charter .  Because these interim safety reviews will not include 
inference procedures (confidence intervals or hypothesis tests), and because these safety  analyses 
reviews will not be shared outside the DSMB , no alpha spending adjustment s are required for the  
final analyses.   
4.2 INTERIM ANALYSES  
No interim analys es are planned . 
4.3 FINAL ANALYSES  
Final statistical analyses will be performed as detailed below.  
Two OPC sets will be considered in support of efficacy and safety as per the original protocol as 
well as more restrictive  OPCs as follows:  
• Primary: Original PG specified in the protocol (45% for efficacy and 25% for safety)  
• Supportive: Updated PG presente d to FDA at the Feb 2017 meeting (46% for efficacy  
and 15% for Safety).  
Primary Analyses:  The powers w ill be 80% to rule out a 45% OPC (efficacy) margin (lower 
bound) and 80% to rule out a 25% OPC (safety) margin (upper bound) using one -sided tests.  
The trial will be considered successful if the one -sided 95% credible lower bound of the efficacy 
rate exceeds the 45% OPC and the one- sided 95% credible upper bound of the safety rate is 
below the 25% OPC.  The use of one -sided testing is consistent with the  original protocol.  
Supportive Analyses: The powers w ill be 90% to rule out a 46% OPC (efficacy) margin (lower 
bound) and 90% to rule out a 15% OPC (safety) margin (upper bound) using two- sided tests.  
The trial will be considered successful if the two -sided 95% credible lower bound of the efficacy 
rate exceeds the 46% OPC and the two -sided 95% credible upper bound of the safety rate is 
below the 15% OPC.  The use of two- sided testing is consistent with the PI[INVESTIGATOR_339013].  
Study success is de fined as achieving statistical significance for the primary OPCs.  
 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 12 of 21  
  Thus , both one -sided and two- sided credible intervals will be computed for the primary (one -
sided) and supportive (two- sided) analyses.  However, since the success standards are higher for 
both safety and efficacy for the supportive analyses  than for the primary analyses , credible 
interval claims in support of labeling will be sought based on the more restrictive supportive 
analyses which are nested within the alternative hypotheses .   
5 ANALYS IS POPULATIONS  
The statistical analysis will use three populations:  
 
1) The Intent to Treat (ITT) population will consist of all enrolled subjects who had an 
introduction of the FRED Implant System into the bloodstream . The ITT population will be used 
for all effectiveness analyses to test the efficacy hypothesis  for both OPC sets .  
 
2) The Safety Population will consist of all subjects in whom the investigational device was 
implanted as well as deaths due to technical failures during the index procedure. The Safety 
Population will be used to test the safety hypothesis  for both OPC sets .  
 
3) The Per Protocol Population will consist of all subjects in the ITT Population for whom there 
were no major protocol deviations.  All protocol deviations will be assessed by [CONTACT_89716].  
 
The primary and secondary effectiveness endpoints will also be evaluated for the Per Protocol 
Population.

FDA guidance for industry and FDA staff guidance for the use of Bayesian statistics in medical 
device clinical trials, FDA CDRH CBER, February 5, 2010).  
For the primary endpoints, t he cri terion for success is based on the posterior probability of the 
alternative hypothesis. The FRED device will be declared  efficacious  if the one -sided 95% lower 
 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_419073] 45% . The performance goal was obtained from a formal comprehensive 
literature review and meta- analysis of results from studies of flow diverters to treat patients 
matched to the FRED study subjects during the first year after treatment. Similarly, the FRED  
will be declared safe if the one -sided 95% upper credible limit is at most 25% . The performance 
goal used in the P100018 SSED of the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_339014] 20%.  
However, the definition used in the PUFS study did not include all death and major stroke within 
[ADDRESS_419074] of this change is unknown. For the purposes of the  
current study a conservative 5% adjustment is used, resulting in a 25% performance goal (20%  
from above + 5% conservative adjustment).  
6.3 ANALYSIS SOFTWARE  
Statistical analyses will be performed using  SAS version 9.3 or above (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, 
[LOCATION_003]), R version 3.2 or above (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) or other 
widely accepted statistical software.  For Baye sian analyses of  the primary endpoints, posterior 
estimates of modeled parameters  will be  reported along with the relevant one- sided and two -
sided 95% credible intervals . 
Descriptive s tatistics for continuous variables will include the mean, standard deviation, median, 
quartiles, and sample size for each treatment group. Categorical variables will be summarized 
using frequency distributions including counts and percentages. Proportions will be calculated 
using known non- missing values.

  summarized.   This summary will include the number and percent of subjects with each protocol 
deviation) and reason within each time interval.  
6.[ADDRESS_419076] -level  will be 
imputed .  For this purpose, all available 12 -month data will be included.  Additionally, for 
subjects not reporting 12 -month occlusion data, results may  be imputed from 6- month occlusion 
data along with available pre -treatment data.  Safety data will not be imputed; [ADDRESS_419077] 
will be sought to confirm stroke and survival status to confirm safety success. Subjects with no 
follow -up data will not be imputed for analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint but 
alternative source- document verified data will be considered in judgi ng 12 -month efficacy.   
In the event such imputations for the subjects with missing 12- month data  cannot be made , then 
the other subjects with  completed 6 -month and 12- month safety and efficacy outcomes will be 
used to compute the respective probabilities of 12 -month efficacy  outcomes  conditional on 6 
month outcome s for the respective ITT, Safety, and PP populations.   
6.7 MULTIPLE COMPARISONS AND MULTIPLICITY  
The study requires both the primary safety and primary efficacy  endpoints be met  to declare 
study success, and therefore  no multiplicity adjustment is required  for declaring study success .   
Also, given that the success standards are higher for both safety and efficacy for the supportive 
analyses than for the primary analyses, as long  as statistical significance is achieved for the 
primary analyses, there is no statistical penalty required to make conclusions based on the more 
restrictive supportive analyses which are nested within the alternative hypotheses being tested .  
7 ENDPOINT  ANALYSES  
7.1 PRIMARY EFFICACY VARIABLE  
The primary eff icacy  endpoint is the percent of subjects in the ITT population with complete 
occlusion ( defined as Raymond c lass I) without clinically s ignificant stenosis (defined as ≥ 50% 
stenosis) of the parent artery at the target IA based on core lab evaluations at the 12- month 
follow -up angiography and  in whom an alternative treatment of the target IA had not been 
performed  post -FRED placement . An alternative treatment is defined as re -treatment of the 
target aneurysm with an alternative treatment modality including open repair, endovascular 
 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 21  
  placement of an additional stent or treatment of In -stent Stenosis observed at the 180- day or 12 
month f ollow -up time -points or at an unscheduled study follow up visit . 
The primary eff icacy  hypotheses are:  
𝐻𝐻E0: 𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸≤0.45 
𝐻𝐻E1: 𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸>0.45 
The null hypothesis ( 𝐻𝐻𝐸𝐸0) for this endpoint states that the true proportion of subjects treated with 
the FRED  Device who  achieve complete occlusion (Raymond class I) without clinically 
significant (≥ 50%) stenosis of the parent artery [ADDRESS_419078] -treatment and without any 
subsequent alternative treatment is no higher than 45%.  The alternative hypothesis the FRED  
trial a ims to demonstrate is that the true proportion of subjects who achieve effectiveness  success 
at 12 months is greater than 45%.   
Using the prior  
𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸∼𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 (1,1)  
the posterior distribution for the primary efficacy  endpoint rate will be  
𝜋𝜋𝐸𝐸 | 𝐸𝐸,𝑛𝑛 ~ 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 (1+𝐸𝐸,1+𝑛𝑛 – 𝐸𝐸) 
where 𝑛𝑛 is the number of evaluable subjects and 𝐸𝐸 is the number of subjects who meet the 
efficacy endpoint.  The point estimate of the posterior distribution of the primary efficacy  
endpoint will be presented with its lower 95% credible bound, as well as the posterior probability 
of the alternative hypothesis 𝐻𝐻 𝐸𝐸1.  If the posterior probability exceeds 0.95, the primary efficacy 
endpoint will have been met.  
7.2 PRIMARY SAFETY ENDPOINT  
The study’s primary safety endpoi nt is the proportion of subjects  in the Safety  Population who 
experience either major stroke or death within [ADDRESS_419079] procedure .  CEC -adjudicated  data will be used for this 
analysis.  
The primary safety hypotheses are:  
𝐻𝐻S0: 𝜋𝜋𝑆𝑆≥0.25 
𝐻𝐻S1: 𝜋𝜋𝑆𝑆<0.25 
 
 
 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 21  
  The null hypothesis ( 𝐻𝐻𝑆𝑆0) for this endpoint states that the true proportion of subjects treated with 
the FRED  Device who experience neurologic  death  or major ipsilateral stroke  one-year post -
treatment is equal to or  higher than 25%.  The alternative hypothesis the FRED  trial aims to 
demonstrate is that the true proportion of subjects treated with the FRED  Device who experience 
neurologic death or major ipsilateral stroke one -year post -treatment is actually lower than 25 %.  
Using the noninformative  prior  
𝜋𝜋𝑆𝑆∼𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 (1,1)  
the posterior distribution for the primary safety endpoint event rate will be  
𝜋𝜋𝑠𝑠 | 𝑆𝑆,𝑛𝑛 ~ 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 (1+𝑆𝑆,1+𝑛𝑛 – 𝑆𝑆) 
where 𝑛𝑛 is the number of evaluable subjects and 𝑆𝑆 is the number of subjects who meet the safety  
endpoint.  The point estimate of the posterior distribution of the primary safety endpoint will be 
presented with its lower 95% credible bound, as well as the posterior probability of the 
alternative hypothesis  𝐻𝐻𝑆𝑆1. If the posterior probability exceeds 0.95, the primary safety endpoint 
will have been met   
The supportive  analysis (second OPC set) will be conducted for both primary efficacy and 
primary safety using  more restrictive  performance goals identified from a revised set of literature 
analysis  and presented to FDA on [ADDRESS_419080]  1 1 1 1

The success percents for primary endpoint s will be presented descriptively within each subgroup 
and global tests of significance on the endpoint s will be performed to check the heterogeneity of 
differences in the primary endpoint  success percent s for safety and efficacy  across all subgroups.   
The purpose of this analysis is not to formally assess success  within each subgroup, but simply to 
assess consistency of results across the various subgroups.  
7.6 SECONDARY ENDPOINT  VARIABLES  
A Bayesian analysis will be employed in assessment of s econdary endpoint s.  
For all dichotomous secondary endpoints, the model employed to summarize the rate ( 𝜋𝜋) of 
secondary endpoint will be similar to the model employed for the analysis of the primary 
endpoints. More specifically, under the prior for the rate  
  
𝜋𝜋∼𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 (1,1)  
 
the posterior distribution for the secondary  endpoint event rate will be  
𝜋𝜋 | 𝑌𝑌,𝑛𝑛 ~ 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 (1+𝑌𝑌,1+𝑛𝑛 – 𝑌𝑌) 
where 𝑛𝑛 is the number of evaluable subjects and 𝑌𝑌 is the number of subjects with events . The 
rate of the endpoint with a 95% c redible  interval will be  reported; both one -tailed and two -tailed 
intervals will be computed to be consistent with the two OPC sets .  In addition to the results 
based on the model, raw counts and proportions will be reported.

  For all continuous secondary endpoints, the Bayesian model employed to summarize the mean 
outcome ( 𝜇𝜇) and standard deviance ( 𝜎𝜎) of secondary endpoint will use a conjugate analysis 
where the point and interval estimates are numerically the same as the sample mean and sample 
standard deviation. More specifically, the prior for the mean and variance will be  
 
𝑝𝑝(𝜇𝜇,𝜎𝜎2)∝𝜎𝜎−2  
 
the posterior distribution for the secondary  endpoint mean  (𝜇𝜇) and variance ( 𝜎𝜎2) will be  
𝜇𝜇 | 𝑌𝑌1,𝑌𝑌2,…,𝑌𝑌𝑛𝑛,𝜎𝜎2,𝑛𝑛 ~ 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑑𝑑𝑁𝑁𝐵𝐵𝑁𝑁�𝑌𝑌�𝑛𝑛,𝜎𝜎2

𝜎𝜎2| 𝑌𝑌1,𝑌𝑌2,…,𝑌𝑌𝑛𝑛,𝑛𝑛∼𝜒𝜒2(𝑛𝑛−1) 
where 𝑛𝑛 is the number of evaluable subjects and 𝑌𝑌1,𝑌𝑌2,…,𝑌𝑌𝑛𝑛 are the data collected on the 𝑛𝑛  
subjects and 𝑆𝑆2 is the sample variance.  The mean and standard deviation rate of the posterior 
distribution of the mean and variance of the secondary endpoint with an equitailed 95% c redible  
interval will be  reported.

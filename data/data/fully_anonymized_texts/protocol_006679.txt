Introduction   
 
Healthcare for older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) is burdensome and of uncertain 
benefit, resulting in unwanted and unhelpful care. Patient Priorities Care (PPC) is an approach that aligns 
care with patients’ health priorities (i.e. the health outcomes most desired given the healthcare each is willing and able to receive). PPC offers the opportunity to increase value by [CONTACT_299186] (desired health outcomes) and inputs (healthcare preferences) for these major users of healthcare.  
 The ultimate goal of our work is to implement and evaluate this approach to care for older adults with multiple chronic conditions that focuses on what matters most to them and is less fragmented and burdensome, resulting in better quality and outcomes at lower cost. This study will focus on evaluating practice change at test sites at the Cleveland Clinic.  
  
Background and Significance  
 
The 60- 70% of  older adults with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) are major recipi[INVESTIGATOR_299174].[ADDRESS_365065] to the health system 
(primarily Medicare) accounts for the bulk of the medical spending among older adults. Out of pocket 
expenses are growing.[ADDRESS_365066] be of value to individuals, health systems, and payers.15 Health systems view 
value based not only on benefits to the system, but also to the patients they serve. In considering value from a patient’s perspective, the personal health outcomes that they hope to achieve – which vary for 
older adults with MCCs -  are the appropriate outputs.

preferences constitute their health priorities.17-20 Patient Prio rities Care aligns healthcare with patients’ 
health priorities.17-20 We now aim to evaluate its value within t he Cleveland Clinic.  
 Healthcare utilization and costs associated with age and MCCs are well known.

in known about cost -effectiveness in the ambulatory setting.26-35   
 
Compared to patients receiving usual care (UC) in a recent study, those receiving PPC reported greater 
decrease in treatment burden (a major concern for older adults with MCCs), had more medications 
stopped and fewer self -management tasks and diagnostic tests ordered.36  
 
To determine the value of PPC, comparable primary care sites within the Cleveland Clinic will be 
assigned to PPC or UC. Clinicians and staff at the PPC site will be trained to identify and align decision-making with the health priorities of older adults with MCCs. Value will be compared using patient and provider -reported outcomes, healthcare utilization, and possibly costs at PPC and UC sites .  
 
 
Hypothesis/Research Question  
 
Does aligning healthcare with patients’ health priorities (their most desired health outcomes given the 
healthcare activities they are willing and able to do) increase value?  
 
 
 
Study Design  
 
Methods  
We will employ a  quasi -experimental, usual care (UC) group design, involving 2 primary care sites (1 
PPC and 1 UC.  Patients are assigned to intervention or usual care arms  based on their primary care 
practice location.  We will use analytic techniques (e.g., inverse propensity score weighting) designed to 
reduce selection bias and balance PPC and UC sites in terms of baseline characteristics.  Data collection 
will occur through quantitative and qualitative interviews and health encounter information in the EHR. 
 
Patient Priorities Care requires the elicitation and documentation of patient health outcome goals and care preferences and the alignment of clinical care with goals and priorities to achieve patients’ health outcome goals and reduce the burden of multi -morbidity.  Participants will be enrolled in the Patient Priorities Care 
Program and speak with a trained health priorities facilitator to elicit their  health care preferences  and 
health outcome goals , which together constitute their health priorities .  This information will be 
documented, entered into the EHR, and shared with the clinicians who will then use the Patient Priorities Care approach with patients to inform and guide treatment decisions.  Patients will participate in the program and be followed for up to one year from the  health priorities  identification  visit.

Patients: P otentially eligible participants  for this project  include Medicare beneficiaries (Traditional, 
Medicare Advantage, and dual eligible) [ADDRESS_365070]  clinically relevant differences in Patient -Reported Outcomes  (PROs ) and 
categories of healthcare utilization, both needed to measure value. We calculated minimal detectable 
differences for the primary PPC outcomes based on a sample size of 500 participants (250 PPC and 250 in UC) that assumed 80% power, a one -tailed alpha of 0.05, and an R -squared of 0.[ADDRESS_365071] and a correlation between 
measurement pairs of 0.55 (based on pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299]) allows us to detect a between- group difference in mean 
change in the TBQ score from pre -test to post -test of - 4.[ADDRESS_365072] to having diagnostic tests ordered.38

     Primary Care providers (PCPs) and Health Priorities Facilitators :  PCPs are identified at  the 
intervention site by [CONTACT_299189]’s electronic health records (EHR) to identify those clinicians with 
eligible patients in their clinic panels.  This requires a waiver of consent and waiver of HIPAA authorization.  Potential priorities facilitators were identified by [CONTACT_299190] (Appendix.1).  Employee Study Information sheet will be 
personally distributed  in advance.  Research team will directly contact [CONTACT_299191] , 
and allow them to review our intervention and expected roles. If potential clinicians and facilitators  
express interest in the project, they will be also asked to confirm their willingness to complete one hour 
over-the-phone training session and one half -day training session to be familiar with the intervention 
process  in addition to review of online training materials . At this point, no protected health information or 
patient identifying information is collected or recorded.  
 
 
Procedures  
 
The subject for this IRB protocol is the implementation  and evaluation of the Patient Priorities Care 
process that will be  implemented in clinical sites at the Cleveland Clinic  (CC) . The CC Patient Priorities 
Care team including, primary physicians, and health priorities  facilitators (i.e. Geriatrician, Medical 
Assistant, Care Coordinators, and Patient  Liaison Program Coordinators , Nurse practitioners ) along with 
other logistically necessary individuals, will help patients elicit their health outcome goals  and health care 
preferences. The elicitation of patient priorities will be embedded into CC clinical programs routinely 
offered to patients  (Appendix 1) .

Patients meeting criteria within the Cleveland Clinic Lakewood Family Health Center (F HC) and 
Brunswick FHC patients who are scheduled to have visit during study period will b e recruited using mail, 
or My Chart message  about the project  taking place.  Lakewood FHC will be serving as intervention site 
and Brunswick FHC as usual care. Eligible and consented patients will participate in the program and be 
followed for up to one year from the goal elicitation visit.  Primary physicians, and priorities facilitators  
(i.e. Geriatrician, MAs, Care Coordinators, Patient Liaison Program Coordinators , and Nurse 
practitioners ) will undergo training and preparation to elicit and provide care aligned with health  
priorities. This training has been developed and tested during the Yale University pi[INVESTIGATOR_299176].  
 
Pre-screening and Recruitment (Research procedure)   
A list of patients meeting above criteria will be generated by [CONTACT_299192], and provided to PCPs to obtain their  permission to invite patients.  PCPs may suggest removing any patients who may 
not be appropriate for the intervention at PCP’s discretion.  Research team will conduct a baseline 
interview after obtaining verbal consent  from the patients . Priorities Facilitators will be notified to invite 
these patients to have their health priorities identified and their care aligned with these priorities. To 
maximize flexibility and alig n with current workflow , the invitation for priorities identification can be 
during a regular visit, by [CONTACT_648], by [CONTACT_2319], or other mea ns already used by [CONTACT_299193] ( e.g. same visit as 
invitation; part of annual wellness visit, etc.).

 Version Date: 07- 22-[ADDRESS_365076]:  Each week, a scheduling system will provide an automated list of 
targeted  patients with appointments [ADDRESS_365077]  the research  
team if they want to opt out.  Opt -out patie nts will be recorded in the screening log to avoid contact[CONTACT_299194].  
 
Care providers referral:  Care providers can make a referral  if they have patients who could benefit 
from the Patient P riorit ies Care program , otherwise meet inclusion and exclusion criteria , and have 
regular visits in next few months .  Care providers can discuss the program and provide information 
sheet to the potential participants.  Clinician will notify the research team of the potential patients who have agreed to participate in the PPC.  Research team will contact [CONTACT_299195] .  Care 
providers will also notify names of patients who decline to participate in order to avoid contact[CONTACT_299196].  
 
Primary Care Coordination patients list:  For patients enrolled through the Care Coordination 
program, research personnel will identify the individuals ahe ad of time and obtain permission f rom 
their PCPs.  Research team will contact [CONTACT_299197], or My Chart messaging to introduce the Patient Priorit ies Care program with an information sheet to explain the Patient Priorit ies Care process and 
ask them to contact [CONTACT_299198].  After excluding patients who opted out , 
research personnel will contact [CONTACT_299199].  Because 
this project provides prioritized patients’ list based on their existing Care Coordination patient list for 
the Coordinators to reach out, this process adds  very little burden on Care Coordinator’s part.  
 
Usual care Group   
Concurrent to the Patient Priorities Care implementation, we will begin to identify the usual care group  
which will include up to 250 pati ents. We will identify a sample similar to  the intervention group, using 
the same inclusion/exclusion criteria and clinical judgment.   The usual care group will be identified  from 
Brunswick FHC patients .   
The usual care group will be identified through the same electronic health record search and Care Coordination patient list described above, and PCPs  will have the option of not including any  of their 
patients  for interview for usual care group.  
 The usual care group during the study period will receive a recruitment letter from their clinician

process.  This can be done before or the day of the initial  PCP visit to begin deciding treatment plans 
based on priorities.  Contact [CONTACT_299202] -up interviews  have been conducted and data collection and cleaning is 
complete.  
 
Priorities Facilitators  will help patients identify their health priorities, complete the health priorities 
template in EHR .   Please note that similar  process has been routinely done at the clinic as part of  Care 
Coordinators’ and Patient Liaison Program Coordinators ’ job (Appendix 1) , and this project provides 
more structure in documentation and collaboration with other care providers involved. 
 
PCPs will be asked to review the patients’ health priorities at subsequent clinical follow up visits and 
update if necessary.

Intervention (Clinical procedure)  
Patient Priorities Care is an innovative approach to shared decision- making that draws from existing 
professional training (e.g. clinical competencies, motivational interviewing, and geriatrics care). Patient 
Priorities Care requires the elicitation and documentation of patient health outcome goals and care preferences and the alignment of clinical care with health goals and healthcare preferences (collectively referred to as health priorities ) Participants  will be enrolled in the Patient Priorities  Care Program and 
communicate with a trained priorities  facilitator in -person or over the phone to elicit their health priorities.   
This information will be documented in the PPC - GOALS AND PREFERENCES form in the EHR and 
shared with the clinicians who will then use the Patient Priorities Care approach with patients to inform and guide treatment decisions.   Patients will participate in the program and be followed for up to one year from  the priorities elicitation  
visit by [CONTACT_5051] .  The target follow -up time is [ADDRESS_365080] been shown to help align care with patients’ health priorities. While encouraged to use these decisional strategies, PCPs will be free to make the recommendations they feel most appropriate for each patient. 
This intervention has been developed to be integrated seamlessly into usual care, and does not involve any 
research aspect such as program development, data collection, and evaluation at all.  Documentation completed by [CONTACT_299203].  Intervention development, data 
collection and evaluation including follow up data collection are conducted by [CONTACT_299204].  What 
PCPs and facilitators are asked to perform for this project is within their standard scope of work.  The intervention does not require additional visit s or substantially increased provider time for PCPs as the 
Goals and Preferences information collected by [CONTACT_299205]. However , it is to the providers ’ discretion, to spend as much time as needed if that would 
benefit the participating patient.

COVID- 19 Procedures  (Remote R esearch Procedures)  
As already described above, entire research procedures including recruitment, consent, baseline interview, 
Facilitation visit, PCP visits, and follow up interviews, could be performed without direct in- person 
interactions with participants.   The core of the intervention is facilitating discussion among Priorities 
Facilitator, PCP and patient, regardless of communication modes.  We’ll examine if there is any 
mediating effects in results when comparing in- person and phone/virtual communication between patients 
and care providers.  
 
Data  Analysis

We will calculate descriptive statistics for the intervention and usual care participants’ baseline characteristics and primary and secondary outcomes. Differences between the two groups’ post -test 
primary and secondary outcomes will be examined using generalized linear models (adjusting for baseline 
demographic, clinical characteristics and b aseline outcome values). Model assumptions will be checked 
by, for example, inspecting residual plots and goodness -of-fit statistics.   To account for clustering of 
patients within medical practices, we will estimate models with robust standard errors. To minimize the 
loss of observations used in the analyses, we will use fully- conditional multiple imputation to address 
missing data. Comparability of participants in the two arms will be assessed by [CONTACT_299215], summary statistics and multivariable methods. If participants’ baseline characteristics appear to be unbalanced between arms, we will use inverse propensity score weighting to achieve covariate balance between the two groups.  
 
Data Confidentiality  
 
Data collection will be performed through the Cleveland Clinic Research Institute, by [CONTACT_32341], using REDCap, and following Cleveland Clinic’s procedures for data protection and privacy. Data will be de -
identified before being transmitted to Yale University where it will be prepared for analysis by [CONTACT_299216].  
 Chart abstraction of the patient’s  health  record (EHR) occurs at the end of the follow -up period.  
 All data will be collected and recorded by [CONTACT_299217]. PHI will be used only to identify patients eligible for the project . Only Cleveland Clinic clinical staff will have 
access to the identifiable data. Only de -identified data will be provided to the Yale investigators.  At no 
time will quantitative or qualitative interviews  ask for PHI. All data collection, management, and analysis 
will occur on computers that are encrypted and servers that have appropriate firewalls. 
  
Potential Risks  
 No more than minimal risk to training participants is expected from this research. For data from electronic health records, there is a potential risk for a breach in confidentiality. All efforts will be made to protect the confidentiality of the participants  and their personal health information. We will use study ID numbers 
for patients so we can link clinical and interview  data over the different  time points. The data w e send to 
the Yale team will use the study IDs and will not include patient names or medical record numbers.

 Version Date: 07- 22-[ADDRESS_365085] that ensures the 
information can always be tracked back to the source data. Where appropriate, a unique participant 
identification code (ID number) will be used that allows identification of all data reported for each 
participant. Participant information collected in these studies will comply with the standards for 
protection of privacy of individually identifiable health information as promulgated in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and as mandated in Title [ADDRESS_365086]- protected server, which is protected behind a login and Secure 
Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Data will be analyzed using the common programming language and statistical packages . Data access will only be available to the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_299181].  
 Electronic record backups are retained in a secure location to prevent catastrophic loss of data 
quality and integrity and to allow efficient resumption of clinical research following computer failures (see Resources). Electronic audit trials are maintained to protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality. All electronic data systems are behind the Cleveland Clinic firewall. Entry to the continually locked research area is restricted by a coded badge identification system.  
 The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_299182]. The 
investigator ensures the research is conducted according to the IRB -approved protocol in compliance with 
federal regulations, all institutional policies, and ethical principles identified in the Belmont Report. The 
investigator will ensure that adequate resources are available to conduct the clinical trial and will provide 
supervision and oversight of all members of the research team. We will also perform data and safety  
monitoring throughout the study period.  
 
 
Potential Benefits  
 The proposed work has potential to directly benefit research participants .  Patients will be provided with 
information that may improve their ability to interact with their clinicians and healthcare team make an 
informed decisions  about their health care.   Patient Priorities Care conversations will be integrated as part 
of clinic standard of care (as part of goals of care conversations).  We expect that this approach will create 
an enhanced dialogue between patients and their clinicians and will result in better care for the individual.

Oversight and monitoring to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data will be ensured by [CONTACT_299218], with particular focus by [CONTACT_299219].  The research team is committed to protecting participants’ privacy throughout the 
life of the project. At periodic interval s during the course of the project, the research team will: 
• Review the research protocol.  
• Evaluate the progress of the project . 
• Consider factors external to the project  when relevant, such as scientific or therapeutic 
developments that may affect safety  or ethics of the project . 
• Review performance, make recommendations, and assist in resolving problems. 
• Protect the safety of the participants.  
• If appropriate, conduct interim analysis  
• Ensure confidentiality of data.  
 
Problems with workflow and process will be reviewed by [CONTACT_299220].  Adverse events will be reported to the 
IRB as well as to the Yale team and Funders as they occur.  Due to the nature of this project , there is 
minimal risk of adverse events.  
 
 
Consent  
 The use of verbal permission is being requested.  The  research personnel performing the baseline 
interviews, the health priorities facilitator  or the participating clinician  will obtain verbal permission  from 
patients who received Patient Priorities  Care during the first encounter with patient priorities care.  This 
will allow project staff to provide the pre/post qualitative and quantitative interviews/surveys over the phone but also obtain utilization data.  These research personnel , priorities facilitators  and clinicians are 
or will be trained in obtaining verbal permission.   
The use of verbal permission will also ensure the safety of potential participants and be appropriate mode of communication during the COVID -19 pandemic.

     For initial patient identification process, a waiver of HIPAA authorization is being requested to identify 
those participating in the clinical program. It would be impractical to gain consent from all the patients whose records will be viewed in order to identify appropriate individuals to invite to participate. These records are being viewed as part of ongoing clinical care, and the information will not be share wit h any 
personnel outside of CCF.

2PRÉCIS 
Background.  
About 80% of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) have malignant cells that express CD25 
(Tac or IL2Ra).  Normal resting B- and T-cells do not express CD25.  LMB-2 is an anti-CD25 
recombinant immunotoxin containing variable domains of MAb anti-Tac and truncated 
Pseudomonas exotoxin.  A phase I trial at NCI found that the MTD of LMB-2 was 40 µg/Kg  IV 
given every other day for 3 doses (QOD x3). The most common adverse events were transient 
fever, hypoalbuminemia and transaminase elevations.  In that trial, 4 of 4 patients with 
chemoresistant HCL had major responses, including one complete (CR) and 3 partial remissions.  
The patient with CR entered the trial transfusion dependent and now still has normal hemoglobin 
and platelet counts over 7 years later.  Because HCL is more frequently CD22+ than CD25+ 
(100 vs 80%), HCL patients were subsequently treated with the anti-CD22 recombinant 
immunotoxin BL22 and no further HCL patients were treated with LMB-2.  BL22 has induced 
25 CRs out of 51 evaluable HCL patients.  LMB-2 may be useful in patients incompletely 
responding to BL22, because it may distribute more evenly through extravascular sites of 
disease.  Moreover, BL22 but not LMB-2 has caused hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in [ADDRESS_1125215] not 
responded adequately to BL22.  
Objectives.  The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2) 
in patients with CD25-expressing hairy cell leukemia (HCL).  The primary endpoint of this trial 
is response rate.  
Eligibility.  Patients must have CD25+ HCL cells by [CONTACT_4133], cytopenia or high 
circulating HCL count, prior treatment with or inability to receive BL22, prior treatment with 
cladribine, ECOG PS 0-2, at least [ADDRESS_1125216] grade 0-2, albumin grade 0-1, 
bilirubin  ≤ 2.2, creatinine ≤ 1.4 or creatinine clearance ≥ 50, lack of high levels of neutralizing 
antibodies, lack of anti-CD25 Mab therapy for 12 weeks and other systemic treatment for 4 
weeks, no prior treatment with LMB-2, lack of other uncontrolled illness including 2nd 
malignancy, no HIV or hepatitis C positivity, no coumadin therapy, LVEF ≥  45%, DLCO ≥  
55%, and FEV1 ≥ 60%.
Design.  Patients will receive LMB-2 at 40 ug/Kg QOD x3 at intervals of at least 25 days for up 
to 6 cycles.  Retreatment is permitted in the absence of neutralizing antibodies or progressive 
disease.  Patients in CR may receive 2 consolidation cycles, or 4 consolidation cycles if CR is 
with minimal residual disease.  
Dose level:  LMB-2 40 ug/Kg QOD x3
Expected Accrual:  5-10 patients/year, total of 25 evaluable patients

2 BACKGROUND
2.1 HAIRY C ELL LE[LOCATION_006]EMIA (HCL)
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a B-cell malignancy comprising 2% of all leukemias [1, 2], and is 
highly responsive but not curable with known therapy.  Patients present with pancytopenia and 
splenomegaly, and have malignant cells in the blood, marrow and spleen with eccentric kidney-
shaped spongiform nuclei and hair-like cytoplasmic projections.  The diagnosis was classically 
made by [CONTACT_812555] (TRAP) staining [3, 4].  More recently the diagnosis 
is most accurately made by [CONTACT_812556] (FACS) analysis (or flow 
cytometry), which demonstrates HCL cells strongly positive for B-cell antigens CD19, CD20, 
and CD22, and other antigens including CD103 (B-ly7) CD11c, CD25, and CD123 [ 5-7].  The 
differential diagnosis, which is important to consider in relapsed and refractory patients, includes 
splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL), which may be distinguished from HCL by 
[CONTACT_812557], lack of pancytopenia, and CD25, CD103 
and/or CD123 negativity [7-9].  HCL variant (HCLv) is a disorder comprising about 20% of 
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/[ADDRESS_1125222] bilobed nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and clumped 
malignant cells in the marrow.  The HCL cells may be CD25, CD103, CD11c and/or CD123 
negative and patients are primarily refractory to purine analogs and other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] [6, 7, 10-12].
Cladribine as standard therapy for HCL.  Cladribine, also called 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine 
(CdA), is a purine analog inhibitor of ribonucleotide diphosphate reductase and DNA 
polymerase-a after phosphorylation by [CONTACT_68009] 2-chloro-dATP [13].  Normally 
hairy cells are very sensitive because of high deoxycytidine kinase levels and low 5'-nucleotidase 
activity [14].  Saven et al. reported 91% complete remissions (CRs) and 6% partial responses 
(PRs) out of 349 evaluable patients, with only 24% CRs relapsing at a median of 30 months [15].  
A total of [ADDRESS_1125223] 7 years, and 95% of 207 
evaluable patients achieved a CR lasting 8-172 (median 99) months and 34% of CRs relapsed 
[16].  The Group C phase II study of cladribine in HCL involved 979 patients treated by [CONTACT_812558], and of 861 evaluable for response, there were 50% CRs and 37% PRs, although 13% 
of the PRs might have been CRs if bone marrow biopsy which was missed had been negative 
[17].  Nevertheless, the relapse free survival of 84% at 4 years was similar to the 79% reported 
from the Scripps study.  
Pentostatin as alternative standard therapy in HCL.  Pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin, DCF) 
is a purine analog inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (ADA), an enzyme elevated in acute 
lymphocyte leukemia cells but low in HCL cells [18].  The largest prospective trial of pentostatin 
in HCL was in the Intergroup study, where 72% CRs were reported in 154 initially treated plus 
87 treated after interferon failure [19, 20].  Relapse-free survival was 85% and 67% at 5 and 10 
years.  In a retrospective trial of 238 patients including 230 evaluable for response, 66% had CR, 
13% had CR not confirmed by [CONTACT_36087], and 17% had PR [21].  No trial has 
prospectively compared cladribine and pentostatin.  Pentostatin is not used as often as cladribine 
because of the need to dose every other week for several months instead of a single [ADDRESS_1125224] therapy in HCL.  Neither of the above-mentioned long term follow-
up studies of CdA show a plateau in the disease-free survival curve [15, 16].  Moreover, patients 
who are in CR after purine analog therapy were found to have PCR-detectable HCL [22, 23].  
Although purine analogs are highly effective even in relapsed patients with HCL, several large 
studies indicate declining CR rates and/or durations with each repeated course [15, 16, 24].  Lack 
of curability combined with declining efficacy with each retreatment points to eventual loss of 
ability to effectively treat the disease.  Clearly many patients may die of other causes, but those 
who live long enough may be predicted to progress and eventually die of HCL-related 
pancytopenia.  With over [ADDRESS_1125225] a low rate of CR but can 
provide significant palliative benefit in selected cases [25-28 ].  Splenectomy can be 
accomplished safely in most patients by [CONTACT_108469] [29, 30].  While normal blood counts 
temporarily improve, there is increased hairy cell infiltration into the bone marrow, blood and

7abdominal lymph nodes [31].  Interferon is sometimes recommended for relapsed HCL, 
particularly when cytopenias are severe and avoidance of myelotoxicity from purine analogs is a 
goal [32].  Fludarabine, though known for its excellent efficacy in CLL, is capable of inducing 
responses in HCL [33, 34].  Rituximab, targeting CD20, has been tested in 4 small trials of HCL 
patients [35-38 ], in which a total of 18 (30%) out of [ADDRESS_1125226] CR rates enrolled some patients without cytopenias [35, 38] and in one trial up to 12 
doses of rituximab were administered [38].  Thus, rituximab is an effective and well tolerated 
agent for HCL, at least in a minority of patients, but would not be considered standard therapy 
for this disease.  
2.3 LMB-2 DEVELOPMENT 
2.3.1 Anti-Tac
One strategy to enable a monoclonal antibody to kill cells is to use the antibody to block a 
growth factor receptor.  IL-2 is a growth factor for antigen-stimulated T cells and is responsible 
for T cell clonal expansion after antigen recognition. It is primarily produced by [CONTACT_398]4+ T cells.  
The high-affinity IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) consists of 3 noncovalently associated proteins called 
Anti-Tac alpha (CD25), beta (CD122), and gamma (CD132), the latter two being members of the 
type I cytokine receptor family. The CD25 and CD122 chains are involved in cytokine binding, 
and the CD122 and CD132 chains are involved in signal transduction. CD25, originally called 
p55 or the Tac antigen (for T cell activation), is a 55-kD polypeptide that normally appears when 
T cells are activated.  It is usually not expressed on resting T-cells, B-cells or monocytes [39].  
However, CD122-CD132 (intermediate-affinity IL-2R) is expressed on resting (naïve) T cells 
and binds IL-2 at 1 x 10 -9 M concentration. When T cells are stimulated and produce CD25 
chains the affinity of IL-2 increases to 1 x 10 -11 M. Chronic T cell stimulation can lead to the 
shedding of a 45-kD pi[INVESTIGATOR_812523]25 into the blood.  The serum soluble Tac (sCD25) level can 
then be followed as a marker of strong antigenic stimulation such as in rejection of a transplanted 
organ [40].
Anti-Tac is a monoclonal antibody which binds to IL2R (CD25) with high affinity blocking the 
interaction of IL2 with the IL2R [41-45 ].  Unmodified humanized anti-Tac monoclonal antibody 
(daclizumab, NSC-277524, IND#2091) was tested in 19 ATL patients (NIH 83-C-0023) to 
determine if it would block IL2 from stimulating the malignant cells [46, 47].  There was no 
significant toxicity.  Six patients had remissions including 4 partial and 2 complete remissions 
lasting from one to more than 43 months after onset of therapy.  Five of the responding patients 
relapsed following therapy.  Relapses were not due to loss of CD25 expression by [CONTACT_812559], 
but rather to loss of dependence of the ATL cells on IL2 for their proliferation.  Thus, CD25 
remains a target for immunotherapy.  
2.3.2 PE38
The full-length 613 amino acid PE protein contains three functional domains which are 
necessary for cellular intoxication [48, 49].  Domain Ia (amino acids 1-252) is the binding 
domain, domain II (amino acids 253-364) is for translocating the toxin to the cytosol and domain 
III (amino acids 400-613) contains the ADP ribosylating enzyme which inactivates elongation 
factor 2 (EF-2) in the cytosol and results in cell death.  The function of domain Ib (amino acids 
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
8365-399) is unknown.  A current model of how PE kills cells includes the following steps:  1)  
The C-terminal residue (lysine-613) is removed by a carboxypeptidase in the plasma or culture 
medium [50].  2)  Domain Ia binds to the a2 macroglobulin receptor, present on animal cells 
[51].  3)  After internalization at low pH, domain II is proteolytically cleaved between amino 
acids 279 and 280 by [CONTACT_342723] [52-54 ].  4)  The disulfide bond between cysteines 265 and 287 
which joins the two fragments is reduced, producing an N-terminal fragment of 28 kDa and a C-
terminal fragment of 37 kDa.  5)  Amino acids 609-612 (REDL) bind to an intracellular sorting 
receptor which transports the 37 kDa carboxy terminal fragment from the transreticular Golgi 
apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum [55, 56].  6)  Amino acids 280-313 mediate translocation 
of the toxin to the cytosol [ 57, 58].  7)  The ADP ribosylating enzyme composed of amino acids 
400-602 inactivates EF-2 [59].  PE40 is a truncated derivative of PE which is missing the 
binding domain and hence will not bind specifically to cells unless attached to an antibody or 
growth factor [48, 60].  PE38 is a truncated version of PE40 which is missing amino acids 365-
380.  While PE40 and PE38 have similar activities [ 61, 62], we have preferred to use PE38 
because it is slightly smaller and is missing a disulfide bond that impairs refolding the protein.  
2.3.3 The Recombinant Immunotoxin
To target cells with a single-chain protein containing the antigen binding domains of anti-Tac, 
the variable domains of the antibody (V H and V L) were fused together with the peptide linker 
(G4S)3 and the resulting Fv fragment of anti-Tac was fused to PE40 [63].  Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 
was extremely cytotoxic with an IC 50 of 0.15 ng/ml toward HUT-102 cells [63] and 0.05-0.1 
ng/ml toward activated human T-cells [62, 64].  To determine if malignant cells in patients have 
enough receptors and metabolize the toxin effectively enough to be sensitive to anti-Tac(Fv)-
PE40, we tested ATL cells from the blood of 38 patients and from the lymph nodes of 5 patients.  
All samples were sensitive to anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40, with IC 50's of 0.03-16 ng/ml [62, 65-67 ].  
Anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 was shortened slightly by [CONTACT_812560] 365-380, resulting in anti-
Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2).  The cytotoxic activity of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE38 (LMB-2) appears identical 
to that of anti-Tac(Fv)-PE40 toward cell lines and fresh ATL samples [62].  Importantly, it was 
shown that these recombinant anti-CD25-immunotoxins are still cytotoxic in the presence of 
soluble CD25 concentrations as high as those expected in ATL patients [67].  This suggested 
that even in ATL patients, whose sera have the highest levels of soluble CD25, anti-Tac(Fv)-
PE38 (LMB-2) should not be prevented by [CONTACT_812561]25 from reaching the malignant cells.
2.3.4 Preclinical studies of LMB-2 in vivo
A mouse model of a human CD25 positive malignancy was produced by [CONTACT_812562]-4 cells [68].  These cells are A431 epi[INVESTIGATOR_812524]25, and contain 2 x 10 5 CD25 sites/cell 
[62].  Mice began treatment with LMB-2 four days after ATAC-4 cell injection, when 
subcutaneous tumors became established (32-86 mm 3).  Ninety-100% tumor regressions were 
observed in 2 of 5 mice receiving 30 µg/Kg i.v. QD X 3, and in 5 of 5 mice receiving 60 µg/Kg 
i.v. QD X 3.  These doses were respectively 5 and 10% of the mouse LD 50 [68].  When 
administered to mice every other day, complete tumor regressions could be obtained in 5 of 5 
mice receiving 100 µg/Kg i.v. days 4, 6 and 8.  The LD 10 and LD 50 are 200 and 257 µg/Kg 
every other day for 3 doses.  The cause of death on necropsy of the mice was liver damage.

9Cynomolgus monkeys were used to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of LMB-2, since 
anti-Tac reacts with primate but not murine CD25.  In a GLP pharmacokinetic study, the 
elimination of LMB-2 from the serum followed biphasic kinetics, with a T 1/2 of 45 minutes 
and a T 1/2 of 127 minutes.  In a GLP toxicology study, 4 Cynomolgus monkeys received 20 
µg/Kg days 1, 3 and 5 with no significant toxicity.  Four monkeys were then given 300 µg/Kg 
days 1, 3 and 5 and experienced dose-limiting toxicity with anorexia and 2 to 4-fold 
transaminase elevations.  One of two monkeys (male) autopsied on day 7 in this high-dose group 
had hepatomegaly, mild diffuse hepatocyte vacuolation, testicular and epi[INVESTIGATOR_812525], 
and leukocytosis and vascular inflammation of the skin.  The other monkey (female) had a ~0.[ADDRESS_1125227] (up to 2-fold) transaminase elevations.  The two 
remaining high-dose monkeys were sacrificed on day 51. One of these (male) was found to have 
a ~0.4 X 0.4 mm area of myocardial degeneration and testicular and epi[INVESTIGATOR_812525].  
The other (female) was found to have a myocardial parasite.  No monkeys had detectable CPK-
MB positivity or LDH I/II isoenzyme ratio greater than one at any time point.  After the 
toxicology study was completed, it was reported by a group at Parke-Davis Research Institute 
that untreated wild-caught Cynomolgus monkeys have high rates of various pathologic lesions.  
In particular, of 62 male and 62 female animals, 45.2% of males and 48.4% of females had 
cardiac lesions, 58.1% of males and 54.8% of females had hepatic lesions, 31.4% had skin 
lesions and 13% of males had immature testicular and accessory sex organ histology [69].  
Unpublished data from these investigators indicated that 6.4% of the males and 14.5% of the 
females had myocardial degeneration and/or necrosis, 8.1% of the males and 3.2% of the females 
had hepatic necrosis, 4.8% of males and 1.6% of females had hepatic vacuolation, 6.4% of males 
and females had mixed cell infiltrates in skin, 1.6% of males and 3.2% of females had 
inflammation in the skin and 12.9% of males had immature testes.
2.3.5 Phase I trial of LMB-2 (NIH #96-C-0064)
LMB-2 induced responses in patients with CD25+ chemotherapy-resistant hematologic 
malignancies, including 4 with hairy cell leukemia (1 CR, 3 PR) and one PR each with adult T-
cell leukemia (ATL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and 
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) [70, 71].  The HCL patient with CR had a Hgb as low as 
3.[ADDRESS_1125228] a normal Hgb more than 7 years later.  The 3 HCL 
patients with PR had limited retreatment due to pneumonia, DLT, and neutralizing antibodies.  
The published Phase I results included 35 patients (age range 24-79), 11 with HD, 6 with B-cell 
lymphoma, 8 with CLL, 4 with HCL, 3 with PTCL, 1 with CTCL, and 2 with ATL.  Of these 35 
patients, 22 received 1 cycle only, 8 received 2 cycles, 2 received 3 cycles, and 1 each received 
4, 5, and 6 cycles.  Twenty patients developed anti-PE38 neutralizing antibodies and 9 of those 
patients also developed HAMA anti-bodies.  Twenty-nine of the 35 patients received a starting 
dose of  10µg/Kg  QOD x 3.  Data discussed below includes 4 patients not in the phase I report, 
who had ATL (#36), HD (#37), CTCL ((#38) and NHL (#39).  Patient #36 received 50 ug/Kg 
QOD x3 and patients #37-39 received 40 ug/Kg QOD x3.  Of these 4 patients, patients #38-39 
each received a 2nd cycle and patient #38 developed neutralizing antibodies.
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/[ADDRESS_1125229] one cycle of LMB-2 was seen at  10µg/Kg  QOD x [ADDRESS_1125230] of toxicities.  The common toxicity criteria 
(CTC) of the NCI were used to grade toxicity.  Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) was defined as at 
least grade 3 toxicity (attribute possible, probable, or definite), but the following exceptions were 
not considered to be dose-limiting: (1) transaminases elevations of 5-20 times normal, (2) 
bilirubin 1.5-2.2 times normal, (3) fever that was well tolerated and did not result in an 
interruption in therapy, (4) hematologic toxicity in leukemic patients, (5) grade 3 hematologic 
toxicity in nonleukemic patients, and (6) abnormal coagulation profiles in patients who were 
receiving anticoagulant therapy or who had preexisting coagulation abnormalities.
DLT was observed in two of three patients at the 63 µg/Kg  QOD x [ADDRESS_1125231] 
patient (with HD) had asymptomatic grade [ADDRESS_1125232] and grade 3 ALT elevations.  The second 
patient (with HCL) developed grade 3 diarrhea, grade 2 fever, nausea, and vomiting, and grade 4 
cardiomyopathy on day 5.  The patient’s cardiac function returned to normal by [CONTACT_4475] 7.  FACS of 
peripheral blood on day [ADDRESS_1125233] LMB-2 toxicity on the heart.  The 
50 µg/Kg  dose level was dose limiting in 1 of 6 patients (patient #27 with PTCL) due to an 
allergic reaction.
The most common toxicities were transient fever and transaminase (ALT, AST) elevations, 
usually grade [ADDRESS_1125234] and ALT levels resolved to 40 U/L.
Fever (22/29 patients) typi[INVESTIGATOR_812526].  Often it recurred on subsequent cycles after the first dose.  Eighteen of 
22 patients with normal pretreatment albumin levels (3.7g/dL) experienced hypoalbuminemia, 
[ADDRESS_1125235] a cell line (SP2/Tac) and compared to a cytotoxicity standard curve created with known 
amounts of LMB-2.  In 12 patients treated at the MTD (40 µg/kg), peak plasma levels after cycle 
1 were 340-1040 (median 560) ng/ml, the AUCs were 48-257 (median 123) ug-min/ml, the half-
lives were 185-322 (median 216) min, and the clearances were 14-79 (median 25) ml/min).  The 
median values for the 4 patients with HD were 620 ng/ml, AUC 155 ug-min/ml, half-life 193 
min, and clearance 19 ml/min.  
Patient #36 with ATL was treated at 50 µg/Kg QOD x3 and experienced a reversible but dose-
limiting syndrome similar to patient #30, with 3rd spacing and muscle edema causing grade IV 
CK elevation and hypoventilation leading to supraventricular tachycardia and respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399].  
Associated toxicity included grade III hypoalbuminemia, grade II ALT, grade III AST, grade II 
acidosis, grade I fever, grade I GGTP, grade II lipase, grade I thrombocytopenia grade III

11hypotension and grade II weight gain.  This patient had a muscle biopsy which ruled out necrosis 
or inflammation, indicating that the CK elevation was from passive muscle fiber edema and 
stretching.  Due to this DLT event (2 out of 6 patients at this level now had DLT), the dose level 
was reduced to 40 µg/Kg QOD x3.
In phase II testing, LMB-2 has been administered to 5 CLL patients without DLT at 40 ug/Kg 
QOD. Patient CL03 had [ADDRESS_1125236] a pneumonia after cycle 2 and on 
day 27 was diagnosed with bilateral occipi[INVESTIGATOR_812527] a documented patent foramen 
ovale.  On a phase II CTCL protocol, 1 patient was enrolled at 40 ug/kg QOD x3 who had 
transient grade IV CPK elevation as his only DLT, so the dose level was lowered for future 
CTCL patients to 30 ug/Kg QOD x3.
Several patients treated with LMB-[ADDRESS_1125237] developed completely reversible allergic reactions 
other than rash, associated with immunogenicity to LMB-2.  Immunogenicity to the toxin 
domains of similar immunotoxins BL22, HA22 and SS1P is not associated with allergic 
reactions other than rash, suggesting relationship to the targeting domain, anti-Tac(Fv).  Grade 3-

patient with PTCL (73).  The patient with anayphylaxis during cycle 1 of LMB-2 had prior 
humanized anti-Tac Mab (Zenapax, daclizumab) treatment and was in retrospect found to have 
human anti-human IgG antibody (HAHA), suggesting that the idiotype of LMB-2, which is also 
present in humanized anti-Tac Mab, plays a role in both immunogenicity and allergic reactions.  
Of [ADDRESS_1125239] 
common toxicity, transaminase elevation, was reversible and never associated with any other 
evidence of hepatic dysfunction.  All other toxicities at the MTD were also transient, resolving 
within a few days to weeks after treatment.

132.3.7 Efficacy of anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin in HCL
Fifty-three patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) previously treated with CdA were treated 
with BL22, 31 in phase I testing, 2 by [CONTACT_812563], and 20 in phase II testing.  The 
complete remission rate in phase I was 19 (61%) out of 31 patients, and 6 (19%) had partial 
response (PRs) [72, 73].  The median (range) duration of CR was 36 (5-73) months and 7 (37%) 
patients are still in CR at a median of 51 (range 35-73) months.  Of 30 with cytopenias, 22 (73%) 
achieved hematologic remission (HR), with neutrophils, platelets, and hemoglobin at least 1500, 
100,000 and 11.  Nine (41%) are still in HR at a median of 50 (35-73) months.  Of 19 evaluable 
HCL patients on phase II, 8 (42%) achieved CR, 3 (16%) PR, and 3 (16%) who are not yet in CR 
are still under retreatment.  Only [ADDRESS_1125241] relapsed from CR, both of whom had 
no consolidation cycles of BL22.   BL22 is safe at 40 ug/Kg QOD x3 for cycle 1, with no BL22-
related SAEs observed in 12 of 12 patients in phase I, 2 of 2 patients on special exemption, and 
20 of 20 patients on phase II.  However, with retreatment at 30-50 ug/Kg QOD x3, [ADDRESS_1125242] had a reversible hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), during cycles [ADDRESS_1125243] 
5 HUS cases in HCL were treated with plasma exchange, but the 6th patient was not and still had 
complete recovery.  HUS has not been observed with LMB-2 or any other PE38-containing toxin 
besides BL22, indicating that the mechanism of HUS is mediated by [CONTACT_812564]22-
binding domains.  HUS due to BL22 has also been observed in 1 patient each with non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma and CLL, indicating that the syndrome is probably not dependent on the 
HCL phenotype.  High levels of neutralizing antibodies were observed in 1 out of 31 phase I 
HCL patients after cycle 1, but with retreatment of up to 30 cycles over nearly 5 years in some 
patients, 11 (35%) made high levels of neutralizing antibodies overall.  Neutralizing antibodies 
to BL22 include antibodies to the toxin, and such patients would not be eligible for LMB-2.  
However, only 1 out the 6 HCL patients with HUS made neutralizing antibodies to BL22, and 
thus the other 5 patients, who are ineligible for BL22 because of prior HUS, would be eligible 
for LMB-2.
2.4 RATIONALE OF STUDY DESIGN 
2.4.1 CD25 expression in HCL.  CD25 is expressed on about 75-80% of HCL samples [6].  
LMB2 is a recombinant immunotoxin that targets CD25.  
2.4.2 Response of HCL to LMB-2.  In the phase I dose-escalation trial of LMB2, there were 1 
CR and 3 PRs out of 4 HCL patients [70, 71].  Several of these responders could not be 
effectively retreated either because of neutralizing antibodies or disease-related 
infections.
2.4.3 Need for LMB-2 in HCL.  BL22 is clearly the preferred agent for HCL due to 20-25% of 
patients who have CD25 negative HCL cells.  Thus HCL patients eligible for LMB-[ADDRESS_1125244] already received BL22 and not be eligible or appropriate for further BL22.  
Such patients include 2 groups:
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients who had HUS from BL22.  Currently 8 CD25+ HCL patients have had HUS 
from BL22.  Several of these might be appropriate for further BL22 at a lower dose 
level, but since LMB-2 has never caused HUS, the dose they could receive of LMB-2 
would be significantly higher and hence their chance of response much better.
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
[IP_ADDRESS] Patients who did not completely respond to BL22 despi[INVESTIGATOR_812528].  A possible 
reason for lack of CR could be that since CD22 is expressed at such high levels in HCL 
(up to 100,000 sites/cell), patients with significant tumor burden could have very 
limited distribution of BL22 to all sites of tumor.  HCL, while being very sensitive to 
LMB-2 [74], express only about 1300-17,000 sites/cell and the half-life is slightly 
longer than BL22.  A total of [ADDRESS_1125245] benefited from LMB-2 due to improved distribution.  Several of these 
patients are still alive without neutralizing antibodies and might benefit by [CONTACT_195119]-2.
2.5 DOSE DETERMINATION  
The MTD established in the phase I trial of LMB-2 in 12 patients was 40 ug/Kg QOD x3.  In 
phase II testing, Four out of 5 patients with CLL tolerated this dose level without DLT, and one 
patient with CTCL had grade IV CPK elevation without other evidence of DLT.  This led to a 
lowering of the phase II dose level in the CTCL trial to 30 ug/Kg QOD x3.   Because HCL is 
more like CLL in having an intravascular component, we plan to use the 40 ug/Kg QOD x3 dose 
level.  LMB-2 will be given every 4 weeks for up to 6 cycles.

who relapse after >2 months of a CR or PR are eligible for retreatment with LMB-2 alone on the 
same schedule if they still meet initial eligibility criteria and were not removed from study due to 
toxicity, provided that the study is still open and the LMB-2 supply permitting.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_812529]-2 administration.  Patients will be treated 
with LMB-2 as described below.  Response and duration of response will be determined as 
described in section 13. 
4.2 DRUG A DMINISTRATION
LMB-2 Infusion: 40 µg/Kg will be infused through a peripheral I.V. or central line in 50 ml of 
0.9% NaCl and 0.2% albumin via a PAB container over 30 minutes every other day for 3 doses 
(QOD x 3).  Additional IV fluid will be given as described below.  The first cycle will be 
administered on the Oncology Inpatient Unit.  If treatment is tolerated well, then subsequent 
doses can be administered on an outpatient basis.
Premedication: Patients will be medicated with [ADDRESS_1125249] dose of each retreatment cycle. While the times of concomitant 
medications are recommended, the actual time of administration should be documented 
particularly when they differ. Emergency medications such as epi[INVESTIGATOR_812530]-2 infusion for treatment 
of an allergic reaction.  Emergency equipment including oxygen should be available in the 
patient’s room.
I.V. Fluid:  Patients will receive fluid prophylaxis, consisting of 1000 ml of D5/0.45% NaCl over 
2-4 hours prior to LMB-2 and another 1000 ml of D5/0.45% NaCl over 2-4 hours after the LMB-
2 infusion is completed.  (This is approximately the same amount of IVF given to the last 4 
patients on the phase I protocol.  However, it is in a more simple administration format). Once 
the first dose of each cycle is given, patients will receive normal saline, at least 40 cc/hr until day 
5-8 when not receiving another type of I.V. fluid.
4.2.1 Vital signs of inpatients will be obtained at the beginning of infusion, at 15 minutes, &   
at the end of infusion, then every 60 minutes for 2 hours, then as per unit routine.  Daily 
orthostatic blood pressure, weights, I/Os, and physical exam will be done.  Daily 
orthostatic blood pressure will be measured after having the patient in supi[INVESTIGATOR_812531] 2 minutes.  If standing SBP decreases from supi[INVESTIGATOR_812532] >

The presence of antibodies to LMB-2 is determined by a bioassay performed in a CLIA-certified 
lab in Frederick.  In a 96-well U-bottom plate, serum from patients, or 0.2% human serum 
albumin in PBS (HSA-PBS), is mixed with different concentrations of LMB-2 which are diluted 
in HSA-PBS.  After mixing with serum, the serum-toxin mixtures each contain 90% serum and 
either 0, 40, 200 or 1000 ng/ml of LMB-2.  These mixtures are incubated at 37C for 15 minutes 
and diluted into cell culture media (DMEM+10% FBS) in a U-bottom 96-well plate so that the 
final toxin concentrations are 0, 0.16, 0.8, or 4 ng/ml.  In triplicate, 50 ul aliquots of these diluted 
serum-toxin mixtures are added to 150 ul aliquots of SP2-Tac cells (40,000/well in DMEM+10% 
FBS) in 96-well flat-bottom plates.  After incubating the cells for 16-20 hours at 37C, the cells 
are pulsed for 4-5 hours with { 3H}-leucine, harvested, and counted to determine inhibition of 
protein synthesis.  Percent neutralization is calculated by [CONTACT_395569] % inhibition of protein 
synthesis of toxin in HSA-PBS, minus the % inhibition in serum, divided by [CONTACT_941] % inhibition in 
HSA-PBS, multiplied by 100.  For example, if the 1000 ng/ml concentration of LMB-2 + HSA-
PBS caused 75% inhibition of SP2/Tac cells and this concentration in serum caused 50% 
inhibition, the % Neutralization would be 33%.  
4.3.3 Analysis of additional research blood
Other blood samples (≤25 ml per 4 weeks) may be drawn for research purposes. There will be no 
genetic or germ line testing unless the patient is reconsented. 
4.4 ON STUDY EVALUATION
4.4.1 Prior to Each Cycle the following will be done:
Staging will be completed prior to each cycle.  This will include an interim history and 
physical examination with documentation of measurable disease, stage, and performance 
status.  Physical examination should record the diameter, in two planes, of the largest 
palpable nodes in each of the following sites: cervical, axillary, supraclavicular, inguinal, 
and femoral.  Physical examination should record liver and spleen size as determined by 
[CONTACT_151228].
FACS analysis of the peripheral blood will be done. 
Laboratory evaluation to be done on or within 3 days prior to day 1 are:  CBC/diff, acute 
care panel, hepatic panel, mineral panel, LDH, PT, PTT, urinalysis, fibrinogen, D-dimer, 
uric acid, amylase, lipase, CK, IgG, IgA, IgM, CRP, ferritin, haptoglobin, Beta-2 
microglobulin and SPEP, 24 hour urine.

[IP_ADDRESS] Days 3, 5 
CBC/diff, acute care panel, hepatic panel, mineral panel, LDH, urinalysis, uric acid, CK.
[IP_ADDRESS] Weeks 2 and 3 
The following labs will be drawn once during weeks 2 and 3: CBC/diff, acute care panel, 
hepatic panel, and albumin. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Follow-Up
For follow-up studies in patients off-treatment, which will not affect eligibility for 
enrollment or retreatment, a non-radioactive neutralization assay may be used, under non-
CLIA conditions.  For additional correlation between the 2 assays, serum samples are 
saved to enable the new assay to be run with historical samples previously tested using 
the radioactive CLIA assay. 
4.4.3 Other tests that will be done at specific times:
Bone marrow biopsy will be done 8 weeks after the patient meets clinical criteria for a 
CR.  A bone marrow biopsy may also be done (but is not required) at the time that 
clinical CR is documented. Research samples at the time of bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_812536] (green top) tubes for MRD analysis and flow cytometry, and an EDTA 
tube for PCR (molecular pathology).  Research blood samples at the time of a bone 
marrow will include flow cytometry, DNA and RNA PaxGene tubes for molecular 
analysis,  and 2 serum separator tubes for neutralizing antibodies and soluble tumor 
markers.  
CT/MRI scan will be done [ADDRESS_1125256]/MRI scan may also be done (but is not required) at the time that clinical CR is 
documented. If no lymph nodes are found prior to enrollment, an ultrasound rather than 
CT/MRI may be done at the discretion of the PI.

cycles.  Patients will be tested for neutralizing antibodies prior to each cycle.  Treatment may not 
continue for beyond two cycles for a complete response (CR), beyond four cycles for CR with 
minimal residual disease (MRD), or beyond six cycles for a partial response (PR) or stable 
disease (SD) without prior FDA approval.
4.8 SUPPORTIVE C ARE
Allergic reaction will be treated acutely with antihistamines (including diphenhydramine, 
hydroxyzine, & ranitidine), fluids, bronchodilators, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].
Nausea and Vomiting: Patients who develop nausea will be treated with a serotonin 5-HT 
receptor inhibitor for at least [ADDRESS_1125260] epi[INVESTIGATOR_812537].  Other 
antiemetics such as prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, or lorazepam may be used in 
addition if necessary.
Myalgias: Patients who develop myalgias may be given acetaminophen [ADDRESS_1125261] dose of LMB-2.  It may then be 
given as needed. Patients may receive NSAIDs or opi[INVESTIGATOR_812538].
Vascular leak syndrome/Capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737]: supportive care may include fluid and 
electrolyte management, diuresis, albumin, and cardiovascular support. 
Hypotension: Patients will be encouraged to increase oral fluid intake.  In addition, for an 
orthostatic SBP change of >20 mm Hg and an absolute SBP of <100 mm Hg, an IVF 
bolus may be given as deemed clinically appropriate.  Refractory hypotension may 
require treatment in the intensive care unit with pressors.
Fever: Patients who develop temperatures >38.0 C may receive scheduled 
acetaminophen [ADDRESS_1125262] 
dose of LMB-2. It may then be given as needed.
Thrombocytopenia should be treated conservatively. In the absence of bleeding or a 
planned invasive procedure, platelet transfusions should only be given for a platelet count 
below 10,000. If invasive procedures are planned or the patient develops bleeding, 
platelet transfusions should be administered in accordance with standard of practice, 
usually maintaining a platelet count > 50,000/mm3.
Symptomatic anemia should be treated with appropriate red blood cell support. 
Transfusion is recommended if the hemoglobin falls below 8g/dL.  Recombinant 
erythropoietin may be also be used.

23Febrile Neutropenia is a life-threatening complication requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_623207]-spectrum antibiotics. Hematopoietic growth factors may be used if 
clinically indicated.  Such cases will be evaluated individually to determine the toxicity 
grade.  Neutropenia due to LMB-2 is not expected.
Central venous access devices such as a temporary internal jugular or subclavian lines, 
PI[INVESTIGATOR_601125], semi-permanent HICKMAN, Groshong catheters, or medi-port implanted 
devices can all be used in this study.  All devices will have nursing supervision and 
include patient self-care instruction.
Nutritional assessment and psychological support: Refractory neoplasms are commonly 
complicated by [CONTACT_87734]. Patients with weight loss or evidence of wasting syndrome 
should have a nutritional consult.  When necessary, social Work will be proactively 
involved with these patients’ biopsychosocial well-being.

study visit:
The site will attempt to contact [CONTACT_62541] 2 
weeks and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain if the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study.
Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_6635] (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, 
if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local 
equivalent methods). These contact [CONTACT_13140]’s 
medical record or study file. 
Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.
[ADDRESS_1125267] SELECTION
Selection is based on gender, ethnic background or race.
Subjects from both genders and all racial/ethnic groups are eligible for this study if they meet the 
eligibility criteria. To date, there is no information that suggests that differences in drug 
metabolism or disease response would be expected in any one patient group.  Efforts will be 
made to extend accrual to a representative population, but in this preliminary study, a balance 
must be struck between patient safety considerations and limitations on the number of patients 
exposed to a potentially toxic treatment on the one hand and the need to explore gender and 
ethnic aspects of clinical research on the other.  If differences in the outcome which correlate 
with gender or ethnic identity are noted, accrual may be expanded or a follow-up study may be 
written to investigate these differences.
[IP_ADDRESS] Justification for Exclusions
Patients with hepatitis C positivity are excluded from this trial because of the concern that LMB-
2 may worsen hepatitis C.  Patients with hepatitis B are not excluded if on Lamivudine, which is

5.4 E
VALUATION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS
5.4.1 Potential benefits to subjects expected from the trial
Patients will receive evaluation and treatment of their tumor at the National Cancer Institute’s 
Clinical Center.  This protocol may or may not benefit an individual, but the results may help the 
investigators learn more about the disease and develop new treatments for patients with this 
disease.   Benefit cannot be promised nor can the chance of benefit be accurately predicted.  This 
research treatment is unlikely to be curative but may offer temporary control of the disease.

5.4.4 Identified Risks to Study Procedures
[IP_ADDRESS] Blood Sampling
Side effects of blood draws include pain and bruising, lightheadedness, and rarely, fainting. 
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
[IP_ADDRESS] Imaging
In addition to the radiation risks discussed below, CT scans may include the risks of an allergic 
reaction to the contrast. Participants might experience hives, itching, headache, difficulty 
breathing, increased heartrate and swelling.
[IP_ADDRESS] MR Imaging
The risks of MR imaging are relatively small.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings that administration of gadolinium 
(updated September 9, 2010), the MRI contrast imaging agent used in this protocol, has been 
associated with development of a disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). The 
syndrome is rare (approximately 600 cases reported worldwide as of September 2010, out of 
several million administrations of gadolinium), but disabling and in some cases, fatal. All cases 
to date have occurred in patients with severe renal disease, including patients on dialysis. NSF 
has been nearly eradicated secondary to careful screening of renal function and avoiding use of 
gadolinium in patients with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.[ADDRESS_1125270] agents at lower doses. This protocol excludes patients with severe renal 
insufficiency (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 BSA). The FDA has issued warnings in [ADDRESS_1125271] not been reported to date. In accordance with the FDA Drug Safety 
Communication of 05/16/2018, the Medication Guide for gadobutrol (or other macrocyclic 
gadolinium contrast agent if applicable) will be made available to all subjects with scans that will 
involve gadolinium-based contrast agent administration.
5.4.[ADDRESS_1125272] scans/year The total radiation dose for 
research purposes will be approximately 5.2 rem. The risk of getting cancer from the radiation 
exposure in this study is 0.5% and of getting a fatal cancer is 0.3%.
5.4.[ADDRESS_1125273] a 
patient’s willingness to participate further, will be explained.  Moreover, in all publications and 
presentations resulting from this trial, patients’ anonymity will be protected to the maximum 
extent possible.  Authorized personnel from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) may have access to research files in order to verify that patients’ 
rights have been safeguarded.  In addition, patient names will be given to the Central 
Registration to register and verify patients’ eligibility. 
Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data can be attributed to an 
individual human subject participant.
End of study procedures: Data will be stored according to HHS, FDA regulations and NIH 
Intramural Records Retention Schedule as applicable.

275.5 RISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS
Patients enrolled on this study will be those with a disease that is considered incurable.  They 
will generally have a poor prognosis and have no standard treatment options known to 
significantly improve survival.  Thus, patients may experience significant treatment related 
morbidity, and/or have progressive complications of their disease.  Although LMB-[ADDRESS_1125274] an acceptable benefit/risk ratio.
5.6 CONSENT P ROCESS AND D OCUMENTATION
The informed consent document will be provided as a physical or electronic document to the 
participant or consent designee(s) as applicable for review prior to consenting.  A designated 
study investigator will carefully explain the procedures and tests involved in this study, and the 
associated risks, discomforts and benefits. In order to minimize potential coercion, as much time 
as is needed to review the document will be given, including an opportunity to discuss it with 
friends, family members and/or other advisors, and to ask questions of any designated study 
investigator. A signed informed consent document will be obtained prior to entry onto the study.
The initial consent process as well as re-consent, when required, may take place in person or 
remotely (e.g., via telephone or other NIH approved remote platforms used in compliance with 
policy, including HRPP Policy 303) per discretion of the designated study investigator and with 
the agreement of the participant/consent designee(s).  Whether in person or remote, the privacy 
of the subject will be maintained. Consenting investigators (and participant/consent designee, 
when in person) will be located in a private area (e.g., clinic consult room). When consent is 
conducted remotely, the participant/consent designee will be informed of the private nature of 
the discussion and will be encouraged to relocate to a more private setting if needed.
Consent will be documented with required signatures on the physical document (which includes 
the printout of an electronic document sent to participant) or as described below, with a manual 
(non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62579]. When required, witness signature [CONTACT_62580].
Manual (non-electronic) signature [CONTACT_62581]:
When a manual signature [CONTACT_62582], this study will use the following to obtain the required signatures:
Adobe platform (which is not 21 CFR Part 11 compliant); or, 
iMedConsent platform (which is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant)
During the consent process, participants and investigators will view individual copi[INVESTIGATOR_62496] (if remote consent); the same 
screen may be used when in the same location but is not required.  
Both the investigator and the participant will sign the document using a finger, stylus or mouse.

Version date:  02/07/2023
29Samples of blood to study how hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a major toxicity of a 
recombinant immunotoxin called BL22, which is similar to LMB-2, occurs and might be 
prevented.  Requires about 3 ml of blood.
DNA samples to look for abnormalities which might make a patient more susceptible to 
HUS. Requires about 3 ml of blood.
Assays which could have an impact on both patients and their children, including studies 
of genetic cancer risk, will not be done.
Samples to determine levels of immunotoxin in blood, urine, and other tissues.
[IP_ADDRESS] Timeframe and location of storage:  Samples will be stored and cataloged longer than a 
year, in alarmed freezers at our Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. contract lab in 
Frederick, MD, where neutralizing antibodies and PK samples are tested. Portions of 
samples which are stored at Leiodos Biomedical Research, Inc. in Frederick may also 
be stored and tested in the LMB lab (Building 37) for longer than a year providing there 
is sample remaining after studies are done.  All samples will be stored with unique 
patient numbers and without personal identifiers.   After closure of the protocol, the 
samples will either be destroyed or their storage and use will be governed by a 
subsequent protocol.  Samples at Leiodos Biomedical Research, Inc. in Frederick will 
be tracked in a secure electronic database and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_812542] 8.2.

307 ADVERSE EVENTS:  LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (SPONSOR)
Adverse event (AE) monitoring and reporting is a routine part of every clinical trial.  The 
following list of AEs (Section 7.1) and the characteristics of an observed AE (Section 7.2) will 
determine whether the event requires expedited reporting (via CTEP-AERS) in addition to 
routine reporting.  
7.[ADDRESS_1125276](S) (CAEPR S)
The Comprehensive Adverse Event and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the 
Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and 
is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are 
protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI via CTEP-AERS (except as noted 
below). Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements'  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/adverse_effects.htm  for further clarification. The 
CAEPR does not provide frequency data; refer to the Investigator's Brochure for this 
information. Below is the CAEPR for LMB-2 (Anti-Tac[Fv]-PE-38).
NOTE: Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next to 
the AE in the SPEER. If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple 
investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to 
determine if expedited reporting is required.

it will be assessed if the adverse event is related to the medical treatment (attribution). If so, it 
will be determined whether the adverse event is expected or unexpected (see Investigator’s 
Brochure and section 7.4.1). If, in the judgment of the PI, the adverse event is not constant but 
fluctuates (or stutters) or change
s grade during a period of time, it may be reported as one event 
with the grade being the maximum grade reached, and the resolved date being the date it returns 
to baseline grade.  Clinical judgment of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_812545].  The laboratory value immediately before beginning drug is usually used to 
determine grades of baseline laboratory AEs, but laboratory values from the prior 90 days may 
be used if clinically relevant.  All calcium values will be corrected for albumin.  To determine 
the corrected calcium in mmol/L, subtract the albumin in g/dL from 4.0, multiply the result by 
0.2, then add the product to the measured calcium in mmol/L.

10 PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION
10.1 LMB-2 IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL RECOMBINANT IMMUNOTOXIN. 
10.1.1 LMB-2 (NSC 676422)
Other Names: Anti-TAC (Fv) PE 38.
Classification: Recombinant immunotoxin.
Description: LMB-2, a 63-kD single-chain recombinant immunotoxin, is comprised of variable 
regions of the light and heavy chains (Fv) of a murine monoclonal antibody (anti-TAC) against 
the 55-kD subunit of the low affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) fused to a truncated 
derivative of Pseudomonas exotoxin, (PE 38).
Mode of Action: The human IL-2R (also known as TAC antigen and CD25) plays an important 
role in lymphocyte differentiation and immune response regulation. It is overexpressed on 
various types of malignant cells and lymphocytes mediating autoimmune disease, making IL-2R 
a potential cancer therapy target. Anti-TAC is a murine monoclonal antibody that binds to the 
IL-2R (with high affinity blocking the interaction of IL-2 with IL-2R. Pseudomonas exotoxin 
(PE) 38 is a truncated portion of a protein secreted by P. aeruginosa that lacks the native cell-
binding site and kills mammalian cells by [CONTACT_812571]-ribosylation and 
inactivating elongation factor 2, halting protein synthesis. LMB-2 selectively binds to cells 
bearing IL-2R and is internalized to release PE 38, causing cell destruction.
How Supplied: LMB-2 is available as a sterile frozen solution in phosphate buffered saline and 
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
39may be vialed and labeled at different concentrations (i.e. 420 µg/mL, 436 µg/mL, 484 µg/mL, 
534 µg/mL, etc.). The pH is approximately 7.4.
Manufacturer:  Produced by [CONTACT_812572], NCI, 
Frederick, MD.
Please note: The concentration of LMB-[ADDRESS_1125287] concentration prior to the preparation of each dose.  
Preparation: Thawing instructions: Warm vials in the hand for [ADDRESS_1125288] vials in a cup of room temperature (15-30ºC) sterile water for 
injection, USP such that when the vial is upright, the water level will be at the neck of the vial. 
Visually inspect the vials after thawing. Do not use if solution appears turbid. Do not shake; 
proteins can foam and may denature.
LMB-2 should only be diluted in 0.2% human serum albumin (HSA) in 0.9% sodium chloride. 
Please note: Particulate matter was found in vials from lots 103037 and 103038 during the 60-
month stability testing. The lots met all other release specifications, including composition and 
potency. Tests were conducted with a Millex GV 25 mm (0.2 micron) filter to remove the 
particulates. Post filtration studies demonstrated minimal loss of potency. LMB-[ADDRESS_1125289] be filtered with a 0.2 micron low protein binding Millex GV filter prior to 
adding to the 0.2% HSA in 0.9% sodium chloride.
IV infusion: The required amount of LMB-2 (436 µg/mL, the undiluted vial) will be diluted 
with 0.2% HSA in 0.9% sodium chloride to a total volume of 50 mL in an empty Partial Additive 
Container (PAB®). Filter LMB-2 with a 0.2 micron low protein binding Millex GV filter prior to 
adding to the 0.2% HSA in 0.9% sodium chloride. Agitate gently to disperse.
A PAB® container is a standard, commonly-used parenteral product container that is composed 
of an ethylene and propylene co-polymer without plasticizer. It is an empty sterile bag to which 
pharmacy personnel add the various components specified by [CONTACT_812573] a specific 
prescribed volume. It is preferred over other plastic containers because it is manufactured 
without polyvinylchloride (PVC) and plasticizers such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) 
with which some chemotherapy agents interact. 
Storage: Intact vials should be stored in the freezer at -70ºC or below. The intravenous 
admixture should be stored in the refrigerator (2-8ºC). Thawed vials should not be refrozen.
Stability: Intact vials of LMB-[ADDRESS_1125290] vials are stable for 24 hours when stored in the refrigerator (2-8ºC) and for 4 hours 
when stored at room temperature (15-30ºC). LMB-2 is stable for 25 hours at 2-8ºC once further 
diluted in 0.2% HSA in 0.9% sodium chloride. Vials cannot be refrozen.
Route(s) of Administration:  Intravenous (IV).
Method of Administration: Treatment doses should be infused intravenously over 30 minutes.
Patient Care Implications: If necessary, supportive care for vascular leak syndrome/capi[INVESTIGATOR_812547], diuresis, 
albumin, glucocorticoids, and cardiovascular support. Other toxicities should be managed 
clinically.
Anti-emetics or hematologic growth factors are not expected to be required, but are permitted if 
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/[ADDRESS_1125291] dose of LMB-2. 
It may then be given as needed. Patients may receive NSAIDs or narcotics if acetaminophen is 
inadequate. Patients who develop temperatures >38.0ºC may receive scheduled acetaminophen 
[ADDRESS_1125292] dose of LMB-2. It may 
then be given as needed.
Emergency medications should be available in the treatment unit in the event of an anaphylactic 
reaction. Allergic reactions should be treated acutely with antihistamines, and if needed, with 
glucocorticoids, fluids, and/or epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].
Agent Ordering and Agent Accountability 
NCI supplied agents may be requested by [CONTACT_079] (or their authorized 
designee) at each participating institution.  Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB) policy 
requires that agent be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to be treated.  PMB 
does not permit the transfer of agents between institutions (unless prior approval from PMB is 
obtained.) The CTEP assigned protocol number must be used for ordering all CTEP supplied 
investigational agents.  The responsible investigator at each participating institution must be 
registered with CTEP, DCTD through an annual submission of FDA form 1572 (Statement of 
Investigator), Curriculum Vitae, Supplemental Investigator Data Form (IDF), and Financial 
Disclosure Form (FDF).  If there are several participating investigators at one institution, CTEP 
supplied investigational agents for the study should be ordered under the name [CONTACT_25559].
LMB-[ADDRESS_1125293] (NIH-986) and mailing it to the 
Pharmaceutical Management Branch (PMB), DCTD, NCI, 9000 Rockville Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2531], EPN Room 
7149, Bethesda, MD [ZIP_CODE] or faxing it to ([PHONE_5107].  For questions call (301) 496-
5725.
Agent Inventory Records -  The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_1275], must maintain a careful record of the inventory and disposition of all agents 
received from DCTD using the NCI Drug Accountability Record (DAR) Form.  (See the NCI 
Investigator’s Handbook for Procedures for Drug Accountability and Storage.)
10.1.2 Toxicity
[IP_ADDRESS] Preclinical studies
In a GLP toxicology study, 4 Cynomolgus monkeys received 20 µg/Kg days 1, 3 and 5 with no 
significant toxicity.  Another four monkeys were then given 300 µg/Kg days 1, 3 and 5 and 
experienced dose-limiting toxicity with anorexia and 2 to 4-fold transaminase elevations.  The 
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
41LD10 and LD 50 in mice were 200 and 257 µg/Kg every other day for 3 doses.  The cause of 
death was liver damage.
[IP_ADDRESS] Phase I and II trials
Adverse events were reported in relationship to treatment cycle.  Grade III-IV toxicities included 
reversible transaminase elevation, fever, CK elevation, cardiomyopathy, thrombocytopenia, 
allergic reaction, and diarrhea.
The most common grade I-II toxicities were transaminase elevation, fever, hypoalbuminemia, 
and fatigue.  Other grade I-II toxicities included vascular leak syndrome/capi[INVESTIGATOR_12737], 
weight gain, hypotension, nausea, pericardial effusion, allergy, proteinuria, and  increased 
creatinine.
10.2 PREMEDICATIONS (ABBREVIATED PHARMACEUTICAL SECTION)
These agents will be provided by [CONTACT_812574].  Please 
refer to the package inserts for complete pharmaceutical information on these products.
10.2.1 Acetaminophen (Tylenol): 
Side effects are extremely unlikely. Regular use of acetaminophen can cause liver 
damage especially at high doses (>4000 mg/day or >12 regular strength tablets per day).  
To minimize this possibility patients should not take over-the-counter products 
containing acetaminophen during the time periods they are taking scheduled 
acetaminophen doses on this study.
10.2.2 Ranitidine (Zantac): 
Side effects include tiredness, dizziness, headache, and diarrhea.
10.2.3 Hydroxyzine (Atarax): 
Side effects include sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], dizziness, restlessness, and irritability.
10.2.4 Dexamethasone (Decadron):
To be given only prior to the 1st dose of retreatment cycles.  Side effects of a single dose 
of dexamethasone might include difficulty sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], increased hunger, and increased 
blood glucose. Steroids are associated with an increased risk of infection although this is 
more applicable to chronic use.

ul/well, A8 receives 205 ul, columns 1-3 starting with row B receive 198 ul, and column 
4 receives 205 ul starting with row B.
b. In U-bottom plate II: wells A1-4 and A7-10 receive 200 ul of media, columns 1-3 
and 7-9 starting with row B receive 198 ul, and columns 4 and 10 starting with row B 
receive 205 ul.

HSA requested a total of two “blank” rows per PK assay. These rows receive only media 
in the final step of the assay (no toxin or plasma is added to these rows). The assay must 
be structured so that a total of two rows in the flat bottom plates are not used. A total of 
19 time points can be run on three plates. If more than 19 time points are to be run, it will 
be necessary to use an additional cell plate IV.
11.2.5 After the plasma samples are added to the U-bottom plates, an 8 well multichannel 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_812551]. The same procedure is used on each U-bottom plate 
starting with row B. Transfer 22 ul from column 4 into column 3 (i.e. 22 ul from B4 is 
transferred into B3, etc.). Column 3 is mixed well and 22 ul is transferred from column 3 
into column 2. Finally, 22 ul is transferred from column 2 into column 1. The same 
procedure is used to make dilutions from column 10 through column 7 of U-bottom plate 
II. It is important that thorough mixing is performed after each dilution and before the 
next transfer is made.
11.2.6 Add 8.5 ul of LMB-2 toxin to well A8 of U-bottom plate I. Mix well. Transfer 22 ul of 
A8 into A7, 22 ul of A7 into A6, 50 ul of A6 into A5, 50 ul of A5 into A4, 50 ul of A4 
into A3, 50 ul of A3 into A2, and 50 ul of A2 into A1. Again, thorough mixing is 
necessary in each well before each transfer is made.
11.2.7 Transfer 50 ul from well A5 of U-bottom plate I into wells A4 and A10 of U-bottom 
plate II. A series of 50 ul transfers are made from A4 to A3, from A3 to A2, and from A2 
to A1 with thorough mixing after transfer. Next, 50 ul transfers are made from A10 to 
A9, from A9 to A8, and from A8 to A7. This is to assure a titration curve for each of the 
three cell plates of the PK assay. Once the toxin is added to the U-bottom plates and 
mixed, the final transfer to the cell plate is made. At this point, there should be three sets 
of four columns containing serum and toxin dilutions on the U-bottom plates I and II.
11.2.8 The PK assay does not require a 15 minute incubation before addition of samples to the 
cell plates. Therefore, a multichannel pi[INVESTIGATOR_812552] a 50 ul aliquot from each 
column of the U-bottom plates to the SP2/Tac cell plates in triplicate. For example, 50 ul 
from column 1 of U-bottom plate I is added to columns 1-3 of SP2/Tac cell plate I, 
column 2 of U-bottom plate I is added to 4-6 of cell plate I, column 3 to columns 7-9, and 
column 4 to columns 10-12 etc.
11.2.9 Similarly, 50 ul from columns 1-4 of U-bottom plate II are transferred to SP2/Tac cell 
plate II in triplicate and columns 7-10 of U-bottom plate II are added to SP2/Tac cell 
plate III in triplicate. Remember to add 50 ul of media (without toxin or plasma) to the

45rows used as blank rows. If media is not added to these rows, the counts will be slightly 
higher and will not accurately represent the control value.
11.2.10 Incubate the plates for 18-20 hours at 37C.  End of DAY 1.
11.2.11 DAY 2
Following overnight incubation at 37C, the plates are pulsed, harvested, and counted as 
in the neutralization assay.
Reasons to repeat assay:
1. Failure to get counts above 2500.
2. Failure of standard curve.
3. Draw points run in improper order.
4. Repeat requested by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kreitman.
11.2.[ADDRESS_1125296] eligibility for 
enrollment or retreatment, a non-radioactive neutralization assay may be used, under non-
CLIA conditions.  For additional correlation between the 2 assays, serum samples are 
saved to enable the new assay to be run with historical samples previously tested using 
the radioactive CLIA assay..

13.1 RESPONSE CRITERIA
13.1.1 Complete remission (CR) requires all of the following: 
o No evidence of leukemic cells by [CONTACT_59549] H/E stains of the peripheral blood and bone 
marrow.  Minimal Residual Disease (MRD): CR with HCL evident in blood by [CONTACT_8315] (FACS) or in bone marrow by [CONTACT_9064].  One negative bone 
marrow biopsy is sufficient to confirm CR providing it is done after the normal blood 
counts qualify for at least 4 weeks.
o No hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy (not >2 cm in short axis) by 
[CONTACT_580005].  Adenopathy which 
persisted but became negative by [CONTACT_812575].
o Normal CBC as exhibited by: [CONTACT_812576]  1,500/uL, Platelets  100,000/ul, and 
Hemoglobin  11.0 g/dL without transfusions or growth factors for at least [ADDRESS_1125300] be done to confirm 
CR.
13.1.2 Partial Response (PR) requires all of the following for a period of at least 4 weeks:
The patient must have the following (if abnormal prior to treatment): 
o 50% decrease in hairy cell count from the pretreatment baseline value by [CONTACT_8315]. Flow cytometry will not prevent consideration of PR or determine 
relapse from PR if the HCL count by [CONTACT_812577] 50 cells/mm3 
and the patient qualifies for PR by [CONTACT_806686].
o 50% reduction in abnormal hepatosplenomegaly by [CONTACT_812578].
oNo growth in lymphadenopathy.  As HCL is not PET-avid, adenopathy which is 
stable is considered not measureable to determine PR, and would not contradict a 
PR proven by [CONTACT_787727].
and the following: 
oNeutrophils  1,500/uL or 50% improvement over baseline without growth 
factors for at least 4 weeks,
oPlatelets  100,000/uL or 50% improvement over baseline, &
oHemoglobin  11.0 g/dL or 50% improvement over baseline without transfusions 
or growth factors for at least 4 weeks.  The baseline Hgb for patients who are 
transfusion dependent for red cells is assumed to be 6 g/dl.
13.1.3 Progressive disease (PD):  Defined by [CONTACT_812579]: 
o 25% increase in the sum of the products of the greatest perpendicular 
dimensions of at least two lymph nodes on two consecutive examinations at least 
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
492 weeks apart (at least one node must be  2 cm) or appearance of new palpable 
lymph nodes, 
o 25% increase in the size of the liver and/or spleen as determined by 
[CONTACT_151228], or appearance of new palpable 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly that was not previously present, 
o 50% increase in the number of circulating HCL cells by [CONTACT_4133], and 
>50 cells/mm3. 
13.1.4 Stable disease:  (SD) will be characterized by [CONTACT_812580]. 
13.[ADDRESS_1125301] scans, will be saved so that 
responses may be audited.  Staging will include a CBC/differential, an interim history and 
physical examination with documentation of measurable disease, and performance status.  
Physical examination should record the diameter, in two planes, of the largest palpable nodes in 
each of the following sites: cervical, axillary, supraclavicular, inguinal, and femoral.  Physical 
examination if relevant can record liver and spleen size as determined by [CONTACT_207134].  A CT/MRI or U/S (in patients with an abnormal initial scan) will be 
done routinely after even cycle numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) and will be done at other times if there is 
clinical evidence that the patient has had a PR, CR, or progressive disease.
13.3 CONFIRMATION OF RESPONSE & DURATION OF RESPONSE 
13.3.[ADDRESS_1125302] cycle, at 6 month intervals for 2 years after CR, and then at 1 year intervals, and if 
positive would indicate relapse rather than invalidation of the CR.  The duration of PR or CR is 
measured from the date a confirmed CR or PR begins, until the date that staging studies are no 
longer consistent with CR or PR.  The duration of overall response will be measured from the date 
that a confirmed response begins, until the date that recurrent or progressive disease is objectively 
documented.  
14 DATA REPORTING / REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS
Adverse event lists, guidelines, and instructions for AE reporting can be found in Section 7 
(Adverse Events: List and Reporting Requirements).
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
5014.1 PROCEDURES
This study will be monitored by [CONTACT_812581] (CDUS) version 1.X.  Cumulative 
CDUS data will submitted quarterly to CTEP by [CONTACT_10075]. Reports are due January 31, 
April 30, July 31, and October 31.
For data safety and monitoring, all adverse events will be reviewed by [CONTACT_079] 
[INVESTIGATOR_44200].  The data manager and research nurses will be responsible for data entry 
and reporting.  Unexpected adverse events and/or serious adverse events will be reported to the 
NCI IRB and the study sponsor as described in section 7. If trends are noted and/or risks warrant 
it, accrual will be interrupted and/or the protocol and/or consent document will be amended 
accordingly.
14.2 STUDY SPONSOR: CTEP
15 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
15.1 STUDY DESIGN/ENDPOINTS  
This is a nonrandomized phase II study.  The primary objective is to 1) determine the response 
rate of LMB-2 in patients with CD25-positive Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL).  
15.2 SAMPLE SIZE/ACCRUAL RATE  
The primary objective of this trial will be to determine if LMB-[ADDRESS_1125303] not been able to to respond well to either cladribine or 
BL22, an overall response rate of 50% would be reasonable, and < 20% would be considered too 
low.  The trial will be conducted using a Simon two-stage optimal design [75].  With alpha=0.10 
(the probability of incorrectly accepting a poor agent), and beta=0.10 (the probability of 
incorrectly rejecting a good agent), we will try to rule out an undesirably low response 
probability of 20% (p0=0.20) in favor of a level indicative of acceptable activity, 50% (p1=0.50). 
Ten evaluable patients will initially be enrolled.  If 0-2/10 demonstrate a CR/PR, then accrual 
will stop and the agent will be considered inactive. If 3+/[ADDRESS_1125304] a CR/PR, accrual will 
continue until a total of [ADDRESS_1125305] a CR/PR, this will be 
considered insufficient activity, and the agent will not be considered worthy of further 
development. If 6+/[ADDRESS_1125306] a CR/PR, then the agent will be considered active (and at least 
potentially able to produce a CR/PR level consistent with 50%). In addition, if there are 6+/17 
responding patients, up to 8 additional patients overall (maximum 25 evaluable patients overall) 
will be allowed to be entered into this trial to be enrolled to provide additional data for secondary 
endpoints.  Confidence intervals will be constructed about the observed response proportions 
based on a two-stage approach [76]. Under the null hypothesis (p0=0.20), the probability of 
early termination of this trial is 0.68.
Duration of response is also important to evaluate in this population.  A statistical summary of 
the duration of response will be reported, along with the fraction of responding patients who 
achieve a six month response duration, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. In 
addition, a Kaplan-Meier curve of response duration will be created to illustrate the pattern 
associated with this outcome.
Abbreviated Title:  LMB-2 for HCL
Version date:  02/07/2023
51It is expected that 5-10 patients per year can be recruited for enrollment onto this trial.  With a 
goal of 25 evaluable patients, it is expected that 4 years is a reasonable time frame in which to 
accrue all needed subjects. The accrual ceiling will be 55 to account for inevaluable participants 
and screen failures..
Due to LMB-2 supply, no more than a total of 13 patients may be accrued to the protocol until a 
new clinical lot is ready for use in patients.

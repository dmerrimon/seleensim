MEMORANDUM 
 
Study Chair:  Jeffrey E. Lancet, M.D. 
Phone number:  813/745-6841 
E-mail:  [EMAIL_16919] 
 
IRB Review Requirements 
 
(   ) Full board review required.  Reason: 
(   ) Initial activation (should your institution choose to participate)  
(   ) Increased risk to patient  
(   ) Complete study redesign  
(   ) Addition of tissue banking requirements  
(   ) Study closure due to new risk information 
 
(   ) Expedited review allowed  
 
( ¥ ) No review required 
 
 
MEMORANDUM 
 
The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the intended timing of patient follow-up for 
S0535 .  All patients must be followed until death or a maximum of 3 years from time of 
initial patient registration (as indicated in Section 7.13 of the protocol).   
 
There is a discrepancy in the follow-up language between the protocol (Section 7.13), 
which is correct, footnote ( Ĭ) in Section 9.0,  and the Model Consent Form language on 
Page 6, under “How long will I be in the study?.” This discrepancy occurred due to a 
protocol change prior to the initial activation of the protocol. At that time, the update was 
inadvertently omitted from the footnote in  Section 9.0 and the Model Consent Form 
(MCF).  
 
The second sentence of footnote ( Ĭ) in Section 9.0 indicates, that bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_888567] "Once maintenance is complete, every [ADDRESS_1243633] year from registration." 
This was an oversight and the second word of this sentence should have been updated 
(at time of protocol activation) to reflect "treatment" in place of "maintenance", so that 
bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_888568] "Once treatment is complete, every [ADDRESS_1243634] year 
from registration."  
 
 S0535 
 Memorandum (contd.) 
 Page 2 
 

 Similarly, the Model Consent Form indicates, “After you are finished with these courses of 
treatment, the study doctor will ask you to visit the office for follow-up exams every [ADDRESS_1243635] year, every 6 months for the second year, then at 3 years from the 
time you finish treatment.” Although there were subsequent changes to the MCF, 
unfortunately it was not previously noted that the “After you are finished with these courses of treatment” and the “then at 3 years from the time you finish treatment” 
qualifiers preceding and following the timing of follow-up visits were incorrect. Therefore, 
the Model Consent Form language does not reflect the intent of the protocol.     
Patients still receiving treatment or who are still in follow-up may be notified, at the 
discretion of the treating physician and in a manner approved by [CONTACT_1036], that the 
follow-up period is [ADDRESS_1243636] to 
SWOG-audit until that time. SWOG’s Quality Assurance Department has made note of 
this discrepancy and sites will not be cited for differences in follow-up period resultant 
from this discrepancy.   
This memorandum will serve as documentation for sites that may undergo audit by 
[CONTACT_888619].  
This memorandum serves to notify the NCI and SWOG Statistical Center.

MEMORANDUM
 
The purpose of this memorandum is to inform investigators about a recall of the study drug methotrexate due to particulate matter in vials from two drug lots:  CL0996 
(expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 12/2013) and CJ4948 (expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 5/2013).   
ISSUE:  Sandoz is conducting a voluntary nationwide recall to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/user level 
of two lots of its Methotrexate Sodium, USP, 25 mg/mL, [ADDRESS_1243646] 
in the US, due to the discovery of particulate matter in vials during routine quality examination of retention samples at the manufacturer. Parenteral injection of drug 
from the affected lots can lead to microembolisation in areas where the particles 
lodge. Clinical symptoms are not to be expected from these microemboli and Sandoz is not aware of any reports of related adverse events.
BACKGROUND:  Methotrexate is an antimetabolite used in the treatment of 
neoplastic diseases, severe psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis, including polyarticular 
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The lot numbers and expi[INVESTIGATOR_888570]: CL0996 (expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 12/2013) and CJ4948 (expi[INVESTIGATOR_320] 05/2013). These lots were distributed nationally across the US and to a single foreign country 
(Poland).

indicated timpoints. 
 
5. Section 15.2, Page 49:  A note has been added stating that no specimens will be 
banked for SWOG and other sites not affiliated with ECOG or CALGB. 
 
The Model Consent Form has been updated as outlined below. 
 Institutions must  update their local consent forms to include the changes to the Model 
Consent Form. 
 SWOG considers that the Model Consent Form changes do not represent an alteration in 
risk-benefit ratio.  Therefore, local accrual does not need to be suspended pending 
implementation of these changes.    
Patients currently on protocol treatment and patients who sign a consent form prior to 
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval and local implementation of the consent form changes need not be informed of these changes unless required by [CONTACT_1036].

FROM:  SWOG Operations Office RE:  Eligibility Affirmation 
MEMORANDUM 
By [CONTACT_366946] 1572, every SWOG investigator has agreed to conduct studies in 
compliance with the protocol, and to personally conduct or supe rvise the 
investigation. A critical step in this process is verification of patient eligibility. 
Effective January 1st, 2013, every registering investigator or another SWOG 
investigator designate is required to sign a statement on the R egistration Worksheet 
that the eligibility criteria have been confirmed. This workshe et will not be submitted 
to Data Operations Office but must be maintained at the local i nstitution for review 
during audits. 
As part of this transition, forms are being removed from active  studies and will be 
posted separately on the individual protocol abstract page for each study.  
Subsequent pages have been renumbered accordingly.  No other fo rm, protocol, or 
consent form changes have been made as part of the transition.  
If you have any questions, please contact [CONTACT_888630] O ffice at 210/614-

MEMORANDUM
 
The purpose of this memorandum is to instruct sites on pre-ordering gemtuzumab ozogamicin.  In order to avoid treatment delay, gemtuzumab ozogamicin may be pre-
ordered at the time a patient is being screened for study enrollment . In the space for 
patient ID, sites should write "pre-order".  If a drug is pre-ordered and the patient is not enrolled, the site is instructed NOT to return the pre-ordered supply, but instead to keep it 
on hand for the next potential patient.  Section 3.5c will be updated to reflect this during 
the next protocol revision.

MEMORANDUM
 
The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify timing of doses for idarubicin used in place of daunorubicin during the national shortage. The memorandum dated January 15, 2010 instructed that idarubicin should be administered on Days 1-2. Since that time, the study team has determined that idarubicin should more correctly be given on Days 1-3, so during Revision #[ADDRESS_1243670] Oncology Group Statistical Center.

TEMPORARY CLOSURE 
Commercial gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) has been withdrawn from the market and 
will no longer be available to new patients.  Therefore, this study will be temporarily closed effective 5:00 p.m. EDT on June 22, 2010 while alternate drug supply is obtained.  
The FDA press release can be accessed at  
http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm216448.htm
.  
Sites must  forward this information to their local IRB.  With local IRB approval (and with 
implementation of any additional local IRB requirements), patients currently on treatment may continue treatment as planned with commercial drug supply.  Documentation of this approval must be kept in the protocol file.  Patients currently on treatment must be informed of the updated information.  This information regarding drug availability and patient information may be located on the FDA press release noted above.  
The study will be re-opened when the conversion to investigational drug supply for new 
patients has been completed.  A Re-Activation memorandum will be distributed at that time.  
This memorandum serves to notify the NCI and Southwest Oncology Group Statistical 
Center.

2. Page 11, Section 3.4c:  The drug ordering information for gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
has been updated to indicate that the drug order form may also be found on the 
protocol abstract page of the CTSU website (www.ctsu.org ).  
 3. Page 15, Section 5.1g:  The first bullet in this section has been updated to include 
the requirement that CALGB sites submit specimens to a CLIA-approved laboratory.  A reference to Section 15.[ADDRESS_1243673] bullet has been updated to remove the requirement that CALGB sites be registered to CALGB 9862
 prior to 
registration (previously required for PCR specimen submission) and instead include the requirements that patients be offered participation on CALGB 9862
, and that 
consenting patients be registered to CALGB 9862  prior to registration. 
 4. Page 21, Section 7.5e: The “*” footnote reference has been added to “Daunomycin” 
in the treatment table.  The associated “*” footnote has been added advising that idarubicin, 12mg/m
2/day may be used in place of daunomycin only if daunomycin is 
unavailable due to the national shortage, and that this must be documented on the treatment summary form.

The above-referenced protocol has been revised as follows:  1. Title Page:  The Version Date has been updated.  2. Pages 6-8b, Section 3.2b:  The toxicity information for arsenic trioxide has been 
replaced by [CONTACT_888640] 2.0 (March 26, 2010). 
 
CTEP has issued an updated CAEPR for arsenic trioxide.  This study did not contain a CAEPR previously; therefore, a significant number of risks have been added.  However, this information is considered to be similar to the risk information already communicated to patients in the Model Consent Form. 
 
Pages 8a-8b have been added to prevent extensive repagination.

Institutions must  update their local consent forms to include the additions to the Model 
Consent Form. 
 The Southwest Oncology Group considers that the Model Consent Form changes do not  
represent an alteration in risk-benefit ratio.  Therefore, local accrual does not need to be 
suspended pending implementation of these changes. 
 Patients currently on treatment (and those who have already signed a consent form but 
have not yet started treatment) must  be informed of these additions.  The manner by [CONTACT_888642].  At a minimum, the patient must be notified at the next visit and this notification process must be documented in the patient chart. 
 
This amendment is being submitted in response to an RA from [CONTACT_888708]

Due to the national shortage of daunorubicin, institutions without appropriate daunorubicin supply to treat patients according to the protocol schedule may substitute idarubicin for daunorubicin as follows:  During Consolidation Cycles #3 and #4
: 
 Idarubicin 12 mg/m2 Days 1-[ADDRESS_1243680] be documented on the S0535  Consolidation Cycles 3 and 4 
Treatment Summary Form in the "Other therapy" section as follows: (1) idarubicin must be written in "Specify agent(s)", and (2) the start and end treatment dates and the total idarubicin dose given for the reporting period must be recorded in the Comments section.  
The protocol and forms will be revised soon. Until that revision is made, the use of 
idarubicin should be documented as described above according to the schedules in 
protocol Section 14.8.  
This allowance is being made only for instances when daunorubicin is not available due to 
the national drug shortage. Any questions regarding this temporary allowance should be directed to the Study Coordinator.

REVISION #5 
The primary purpose of this revision is to remove specimen submission requirements for 
SWOG-9007 , “Cytogenetic Studies in Leukemia Patients” and S9910 , “Leukemia 
Centralized Reference Laboratories and Tissue Repositories, Ancillary” from the above referenced study. For Southwest Oncology Group sites and other sites NOT affiliated with ECOG or CALGB, registration and submission of specimens to these ancillary studies will no longer be required. For these sites, RT-PCR testing according to the protocol schedule is still mandatory, but this testing may be done at any CLIA-approved laboratory.  Similarly, for these sites, cytogenetic studies should be performed according to the protocol schedule, but at the site’s preferred cytogenetics laboratory.  Results of these RT-PCR and cytogenetics studies will be submitted as part of the protocol data as described in protocol Section 14.0.  No changes are being implemented for CALGB or ECOG affiliated patients at this time. 
 1.  The Version Date has been updated.  2.  Page 14, Section 5.1b: This section has been revised to remove the mention of a 
central lab, since that no longer applies to SWOG sites and other sites NOT affiliated with ECOG or CALGB. Similar changes have been made in Sections 7.8a, 7.8b, 7.8c and 7.8d (Page 22), 7.8e (Page 23), and 15.1 (Page 40). 
 3.  Page 14, Section 5.1f: This section has been updated to indicate that participation 
in SWOG cytogenetics study SWOG-9007
 is no longer required for patients at 
SWOG sites or other sites NOT affiliated with ECOG or CALGB, but that submission of specimens to each site’s preferred cytogenetics laboratory is now required instead. Participation in cytogenetics studies remains mandatory for patients affiliated with CALGB or ECOG.  Similar changes have been made in 
Sections 5.2b (Page 16) and 19.4 (Page 98).

4. Page 15, Section 5.1g: This section has been updated to indicate that participation 
in SWOG ancillary study S9910
 is no longer required for patients at SWOG sites or 
other sites NOT affiliated with ECOG or CALGB, although pretreatment RT-PCR assay for PML-RAR Į is still required. The first sentence has been revised to 
emphasize that the pretreatment RT-PCR assay is still required for all patients. The third sentence has been updated to state that specimen submissions must be via the “mechanisms” indicated, since the mechanism for SWOG and other non-ECOG/CAGLB patients does not involve an ancillary protocol. The last sentence has been updated to indicate that repository aspects of the ancillary protocols “for 
CALGB and ECOG” are optional. The first bullet regarding specimen submission 
for SWOG patients has been updated to remove the references to S9910
and the 
Southwest Oncology Group Leukemia Repository and to instead instruct that specimens must be submitted to a CLIA-approved laboratory. Similar changes have been made in Sections 5.2c (Page 16) and 5.3b (Page 17). 
 5. Page 16, Section 5.2c: The reference to Section 15.3 has been updated to 15.2 in 
this section. This change has also been made in Section 5.3b (Page 17). 
 
6. Page 22, Sections 7.8a and 7.8b: The second sentence has been updated to 
indicate that specimens must be submitted for cytogenetics for patients affiliated with CALGB or ECOG and that specimens must be submitted for PCR for all patients. The fourth sentence has been revised to clarify that neither cytogenetic nor RT-PCR testing is required for repeat marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_22602]. Similar changes have been made in Sections 7.8e (Page 23) and 15.1 (Page 40).  The word “ONLY” has been removed from the last sentence for clarity. 
 7. Page 10, Section 9.0:  The “Specimen Submission” row has been replaced by [CONTACT_888643] “Cytogenetics” and “RT-PCR for PML-RAR
Į”.  The “Ȉ” footnote has been 
included in both rows.  In the “Cytogenetics” row, Xs have been added to the Pre-study and Induction columns.  In the “RT-PCR for PML-RAR
Į” row, Xs have been 
added to the Pre-study, Induction and Consolidation #1 through 2 columns.  An “X¶” has been added to the Consolidation #3 through 4 (Prior) column, with associated “¶” footnote indicating that RT-PCR is required prior to Consolidation #3, but not #4.  An “X¿” has been added to each of the new rows in the “Follow-Up” columns, with associated “¿” footnotes indicating that follow-up cytogenetics and RT-PCR are required at relapse only.  The “ 4" footnote has been updated to 
state that the marrow documenting CR may serve as the prior to Consolidation #1 marrow, providing it was performed within 8 weeks prior to Consolidation registration.  A reference to Section 5.2 has also been included.  An “X” has been added to the “Maintenance” column of the “RT-PCR for PML-RAR
Į” row, as this 
test is required prior to maintenance. 
 
8. Pages 38-39, Sections 14.4, 14.5, 14.7, 14.12, and 14.15:  Submission of RT-PCR 
reports for SWOG sites and sites NOT affiliated with ECOG or CALGB has been added to each of these sections.  The requirement for submission of the cytogenetics results has been added to Sections 14.4 and 14.15. 
 
9. Page 40, Section 15.1:  This section has been updated as follows to reflect the 
changes in specimen submission requirements for SWOG patients and other patients not affiliated with CALGB or ECOG:  x The first sentence has been updated to remove the wording “regardless of 
Group affiliation”.   
x Information has been added indicating that RT-PCR and pretreatment 
cytogenetic requirements are applicable to all patients, regardless of group affiliation; associated times have been outlined.   
x The sentence referencing “additional details regarding specimen submission” 
has been updated to “additional details regarding mechanisms for obtaining 
these studies”.

x The “b” footnote reference has been added to the “Cytogenetics” column of the 
“At the time of neutrophil recovery or on Day 42” row.  The associated “b” footnote has been added to state that these specimens are not required for SWOG sites and other sites not affiliated with ECOG or CALGB.   
x The “*” footnote has been updated to replace a reference to the “central” 
laboratory with references to the “testing” laboratory.  The sentence indicating that the lab “will” contact [CONTACT_888644] “may” contact [CONTACT_779].   
x The “a” footnote, previously stating that the RT-PCR result will be reported 
back to the submitting institution, has been updated to emphasize that the pretreatment RT-PCR determines whether the patient is eligible or should continue on protocol treatment, and that if the pretreatment RT-PCR result is indeterminate, additional specimens should be submitted for RT-PCR testing to avoid indeterminate pretreatment results whenever possible. 
 
10. Pages 40-41, Section 15.2a: This section, regarding patients at SWOG sites and 
other sites NOT affiliated with ECOG or CALGB, has been updated to replace 
specimen submission instructions for SWOG-9007
with instructions to perform 
required cytogenetic studies at each institution’s preferred cytogenetics laboratory.  A similar change has been made in Section 19.4 (Pages 96 and 98).  The section heading has been revised accordingly. 
 11. Page 41, Section 15.2b: This section, regarding patients at SWOG sites and other 
sites NOT affiliated with ECOG or CALGB, has been updated to remove specimen submission instructions for S9910
. The section heading and Section 15.2b.[ADDRESS_1243683] been renumbered accordingly.  The new Section 15.2b.2 (previously Section 15.2b.3) has been revised to clarify that RT-PCR testing must be performed at CLIA-approved laboratories.  A similar change has been made in Section 19.4 (Pages 96 and 98). 
 12. Pages 42-42a, Sections 15.2c, 15.2d and 15.2e have been deleted, since they are 
no longer applicable.  Page 42 has intentionally been left blank. 
 13. Page 50, Model Consent Form: In the “During the study…” section, the note to 
investigators after the last bullet on this page has been updated to indicate that this refers to the mandatory cytogenetic studies and RT-PCR testing (previously “submission of specimens to SWOG-9007
and S9910 ”). 
 14. Page 61, Model Consent Form: A note to investigators has been added after 
question #2 (regarding banking of specimens for future research) indicating that this section is applicable only to CALGB and ECOG institutions. 
 
15. Page 63, Model Consent Form: The instruction “[For patients participating through 
SWOG or any other institution not affiliated with ECOG or CALGB, use the following]” and the text immediately following have both been deleted.

SWOG-9910 , “Leukemia Centralized Reference Laboratories and Tissue Repositories, 
Ancillary”, as stated in Sections 5.1g, 5.2c and 5.3b of protocol S0535 .  However 
pretreatment PCR studies are still required to determine patient eligibility.  These studies must be done at CLIA-approved laboratories.  Patients must have a report documenting the PCR result as positive or indeterminate in order to be eligible; if PCR is negative or not done, the patient will be considered ineligible.    Institutions should also attempt to complete the subsequent PCR studies according to the 
current protocol schedule (see Section 15.1 of protocol S0535

MEMORANDUM
 
Please note that Revision #2 contains the following error:  The cover memorandum states that "ATRA syndrome" has been added to the "Rare but Serious" side effects category for Maintenance therapy, but it was incorrectly added to the "Less Likely" category in the consent form.  ATRA syndrome is a "Rare but Serious" side effect, and the cover memorandum was correct in stating it should have been added to that category.  This correction will be made during the next revision/amendment, and institutions may make this correction to local consent forms in the meantime.

REVISION #2
 
1. Title page:  The version date has been updated.    2. Page 14, Section 5.1e:  This eligibility criterion has been revised to allow prior 
therapy with ATRA administered for up to [ADDRESS_1243695] care for this disease.  The “ƒ” footnote has been added to the Study Calendar (Section 9.0, Page 32) explaining this as well.  Because of this change, Section 7.8a (Page 22) has been reworded to clarify that the marrow exam is performed on Day [ADDRESS_1243696] occurred prior to starting protocol therapy.  This change has also been made in Section 15.2a.1b (Page 41). 
 3. Pages 14-17, Sections 5.1f-5.1g, 5.2c-5.2d, and 5.3b:  These sections have been 
updated to indicate that SWOG patients and any patients not affiliated with ECOG or CALGB must submit specimens as outlined for each section (previously said any Southwest Oncology Group patients).

 Revision #2 (contd.)  Page 2 
 
  
      4. Page 18, Section 7.1e:  This section has been added to indicate that patients who 
become pregnant after registration must be removed from protocol therapy.  Similar changes have been made in Section 7.11f (Page 26) and the Model Consent Form (Pages 51a and 58).  The sentence in Sections 3.1b (Page 5) stating that ATRA use in pregnant women is not prohibited on this protocol has been deleted. 
 5. Page 18, Section 7.2c:  Serial coagulation studies outlined in this section have 
been changed from twice weekly during induction and then as clinically indicated thereafter to twice weekly during induction until normal and then as clinically indicated thereafter, as it is not necessary for this testing to be performed so often once numbers have stabilized.  The " '" footnote has been updated in the Study 
Calendar (Section 9.0, Page 32) indicating this as well. 
 
6. Page 32, Section 9.0:  The “ ¥” footnote has been updated to indicate that the 
marked tests are performed every 3 months until 3 years from initial registration (previously said for 3 years after off treatment). 
 
7. Page 55, Model Consent Form:  Increased blood level of a fat called triglyceride 
has been added to the risks/side effects (likely section) for Consolidation #3 and 4.  This change was previously made to the Induction risks/side effects but the cover memorandum incorrectly stated that it had been changed in the Consolidation #3 and 4 section instead of the Induction section.  The added risk is necessary for both sections, so will remain in the Induction section as well. 
 8. Page 57, Model Consent Form:  ATRA syndrome has been added to the rare but 
serious risks/side effects for maintenance therapy, along with a brief explanation of related symptoms. 
 
9. Page 96, Section 19.4:  The italicized words “protocol number” have been replaced 
by [CONTACT_60395] “ S0535
”. 
 Institutions must update their local consent forms to include this information for future registrations.  Patients currently being treated on this study should be informed in the manner determined by [CONTACT_290518] (IRB).  The Southwest Oncology Group considers that the changes in the Model Consent Form that are associated with this Revision are solely administrative and editorial in nature, and 
do not impact the risk/benefit ratio for participants on this study.  Local accrual to the study 
does not have to be suspended pending implementation of these changes.

REVISION #1
 
1. Title page:  The version date has been updated.  The page number for Section 
16.0 has been updated.  The spelling of the drug Tretinoin has been corrected (previously written as Trentinoin).  This change has also been made in Section 3.1 (Page 4).  CTSU has been added to the participants list. 
 2. Pages 2-2a:  The Study Coordinator information for the cooperative groups ECOG 
and CALGB have been added.  CTSU participation information and CTSU address and contact [CONTACT_888645].  Page 2a has been added to prevent extensive repagination. 
 3. Pages 14-15, Sections 5.1f-5.1g:  These sections have been updated to include 
specimen submission requirements for the cooperative group ECOG as part of the  eligibility criteria.  These sections have also been structured to allow for the addition of CALGB requirements which are still pending.  Similar changes have been made in Sections 5.2c and 5.2d (Page 16) and 5.3b (Page 17). 
 
4. Page 20, Section 7.5c:  The phrase "if performed" has been added to the 
requirement to use the same test (MUGA or echocardiogram) that was used during Consolidation Cycle [ADDRESS_1243698]•San Antonio, TX [ZIP_CODE] • Telephone [PHONE_4860] • FAX [PHONE_4861] • http://swog.org 
 S0535 
 Revision #1 (contd.)  Page 2 
 
  
   
 
  5. Page 32, Section 9.0:  A " " footnote has been added to the "MUGA/ECHO" row in 
the prior to Consolidation #[ADDRESS_1243699] is only to be performed for patients who experienced signs or symptoms of clinically significant cardiac toxicity during or after Induction therapy, and references Section 5.2b.  A " " footnote has been added to the "MUGA/ECHO" row in the prior to 
Consolidation #3 through 4 column.  This footnote states that if MUGA/ECHO was performed prior to Consolidation #1, the same test should be used prior to Consolidation #3, and references Section 7.5c.  A "†" footnote has been added to the "Height, Weight and BSA" row in the during Consolidation #1 through 2, # 3 through 4 and #5 through 6 columns.  This footnote states that these are required prior to each cycle of consolidation. 
 6. Page 36, Section 13.0:  A note has been added directing non-SWOG participants 
to Appendix 19.4 for CTSU participation procedures. 
 
7. Pages 40-42d, Sections 15.1-15.4:  Sections 15.1-15.[ADDRESS_1243700] been restructured to 
allow for the addition of ECOG and CALGB participation information.  Section 15.1 
now contains the specimen submission summary for all groups, Section 15.2 
contains information for SWOG (and other institutions not associated with ECOG or CALGB), and Section 15.3 contains information for ECOG. Section 15.4 has been kept as a placeholder for the CALGB specimen submission information which is still pending.  Pages 42a-42d were added to prevent extensive repagination. 
 8. Page 44, Section 16.1:  Footnote "b" in Table 16.[ADDRESS_1243701] Oncology Group Policy No. 23.  It now states that following an AdEERS report, supporting data does not need to be submitted unless specifically requested by [CONTACT_99944]. In addition, the requirement to submit evidence of IRB notification to SWOG has been rescinded (although the requirement to notify IRBs of all SAEs has not). 
 9. Pages 50-51a, Model Consent Form:  Treatment tables have been added for each 
of the treatment cycles in order to provide a treatment summary for patients as 
requested by [CONTACT_888646].  Page 51a has been added to prevent extensive repagination. 
 
10. Page 53-55, Model Consent Form:  Several items have been moved in the risks 
and side effects sections in order to more closely coincide with the associated probability of each risk as listed in the drug information sections of the protocol.  In the Induction Therapy section, "Nosebleed" has been moved from "Less Likely" to "Likely" and "Severe injury to liver (veno-occlusive disease)" has been moved from "Rare, but Serious" to "Less Likely".  In the Consolidation #3 and #4 section, "Eye problems, visual disturbances" has been moved from "Less Likely" to "Likely".  "Increased blood level of a form of fat called triglyceride" had been added to the "Likely" section to coincide with the drug toxicology in Section 3.1b. 
 
11. Pages 57-58, Model Consent Form:  The section for Risks and side effects related 
to Maintenance Therapy with gemtuzumab ozogamicin has been removed.  Gemtuzumab ozogamicin is not used during Maintenance therapy, and therefore 
this section is not pertinent to this protocol.  
 
12. Page 59, Model Consent Form:  CTSU has been added to the list of organizations 
that might have access to patient information under the "will my medical information be kept private" section. 
 
13. Pages 63, Model Consent Form and 65, Specimen Consent Supplemental Sheets:  
The existing specimen and repository information and address have been updated to indicate that they are relevant for patients participating through SWOG or other institutions not affiliated with ECOG or CALGB.  Information for the ECOG specimen repository has been added to each page as well.

previously untreated high-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia tre ated with a combined 
regimen of all trans retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide, an d gemtuzumab ozogamicin.
1.[ADDRESS_1243719] 20% of pat ients presenting with APL still die 
of the disease or a complication of its treatment.  The Spanish  (PETHEMA) and Italian (GIMEMA) 
cooperative groups have identified risk factors for treatment f ailure based on presenting white 
blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts. (1)  Low risk patients are those presenting with a WBC 
10,000 and a platelet count > 40,000, intermediate risk patients  also have a WBC 10,[ADDRESS_1243720] a platelet count 40,000, while high risk patients have a presenting WBC > 10,000. Other 
groups, including the British (MRC) and French, have reported si milar findings. (2,3)Using 
modern therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], both low and intermediate risk patients can b e expected to enter complete 
remission in at least 95% of cases, and have a risk of relapse during the first year of therapy of 
less than 5%. (4)These outstanding results raise the question of whether these p atients may be 
receiving more therapy than necessary, a question that will be a ddressed in the North American 
Leukemia Intergroup study for low- and intermediate-risk APL, stu dyS0521 .  For patients with 
high-risk disease, as defined by [CONTACT_888649],  the outcomes of treatment 
have been less favorable, with early death seen in at least 20%  of patients, most often due to 
hemorrhage, usually of the CNS or lungs, and/or infection, and a substantial risk for relapse, 
estimated to be at least 25%.  For example, in the MRC trial, a mong patients presenting with a 
WBC of over 10,000, the risk of early death in patients treated w ith ATRA until CR was 24% and 
the risk of relapse was 47%.  In the recently reported PETHEMA LPA99 trial, although outstanding
results were reported in the low- and intermediate-risk groups, early deaths were seen in at least 
20% of high-risk patients, and the recurrence rate was 24% for this group. (5)Thus, for patients 
with high-risk disease, improved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_66039].
The last North American Intergroup study, CALGB [ADDRESS_1243721]  confirm the general conclusions of 
the PETHEMA and GIMEMA groups.  These data both confirm the PET HEMA/GIMEMA risk 
stratification, and emphasize the need to find better therapy f or high-risk patients.
There have been various attempts to improve therapy in this hig h-risk group. One approach has 
been to add additional supportive care measures. For example, t he PETHEMA group has 
reported on the use of prophylactic prednisone and prophylactic  tranexamic acid, and concluded 
that neither was effective in reducing the incidence of early d eaths in newly diagnosed APL. (6)

is composed of a humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody conjug ated to calicheamicin, a 
potent antitumor antibiotic.  Because CD33 is brightly expresse d  b y  A P L  b l a s t s  i n  v i r t u a l l y  a l l  
cases of APL, the conjugate has been studied as therapy for pat ients with recurrent disease. 
Initial results appeared promising and led Estey et al. to combi ne gemtuzumab with ATRA as 
initial therapy for APL. (9,10)This regimen was found to have a high rate of CR, including a 4 3% 
rate of PCR negativity at the conclusion of induction therapy.  (11)Most recently, Estey et al.
have conducted a pi[INVESTIGATOR_888577], arseni c trioxide and gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin as initial therapy for 18 patients with high-risk AP L, i.e. those with a WBC > 10,000.  
(12)They report a CR rate of 86% in this high-risk group, a figure superior to what they have 
achieved with any other regimen they have tested.  In addition,  all evaluable patients became 
PCR negative at [ADDRESS_1243723] on disease-
free survival and toxicity.

3.0 DRUG INFORMATION
3.1 All Trans Retinoic Acid (Tretinoin) (NSC-122758) 
a. DESCRIPTION:
Chemistry
:  All trans retinoic acid (tRA) is a natural retinol metabolit e formed from 
the intestinal oxidation of B-carotene and from tissue anabolis m of retinaldehyde.  
Both retinol and tRA circulate in the blood in tight associatio n with serum proteins, 
retinol binding protein for reti nol and albumin for tRA.  tRA i s a major endogenous 
metabolite of Vitamin A (retinol).  tRA induces differentiation  and/or growth-
inhibition in many tumorigenic ce ll lines and demonstrates ther apeutic efficacy in 
the treatment of certain leukemias particularly promyelocytic l eukemia.  It also 
acts to stimulate clonal proliferation of hematopoietic cells a nd augments, either 
directly or indirectly, a variety of immune functions.
b. TOXICOLOGY:
Human Toxicology :  The toxicities of tRA closely resemble those of 
hypervitaminosis A.  Cheilitis (80% of patients) and headache ( 77%) are the most 
common toxicities of tRA usage.  Other toxicities include visua l disturbances, 
dryness of mucous membranes, pruritis, dry skin, peeling, fatig ue and epi[INVESTIGATOR_110350] 
10 - 50% of patients.  10% or less of patients develop musculoske letal pain, 
conjunctivitis and psychological changes.  The CNS toxicity app ears dose-
related, occurring in 4% or less when tRA is administered at 30  mg/day, but 
occurring in 50% when tRA is administered at 70 - 100 mg/day.  I ncreases in 
SGOT/SGPT/bilirubin, triglycerides, cholesterol and fibrinogen have also been 
seen.  All trans retinoic acid has been associated with cases o f pseudotumor 
cerebri.
 
Revised 11/12/08 S0535
Page 8
Version Date 12/26/[ADDRESS_1243724] been reported in adults receiving prolong ed treatment with 
cis retinoic acid (cRA).  Whether these effects accompany tRA a dministration of 
long term is not well defined.  In APL patients treated with tR A, 55% developed 
hypertriglyceridemia and 40% manifested increased liver transam inases.  
Patients with APL have also experienced hyperleukocytosis and a  cardio-
pulmonary syndrome.
Like cRA, tRA must be considered a teratogen, and may potential ly cause 
craniofacial abnormalities, CNS abnormalities, thymic aplasia a nd cardiac 
abnormalities.  It is considered a class C FDA pregnancy risk s ince animal 
studies have shown adverse effects and toxicities on the fetus.   No adequate or 
well-controlled studies have been done on pregnant women.
It is strongly recommended that women of childbearing potential  have a 
pregnancy test performed within two weeks prior to all trans re tinoic acid 
therapy.  Females should be fully counseled regarding the risk to the fetus 
of using ATRA.  
Females should be fully counseled on the serious risk to the fe tus should 
they become pregnant while undergoing treatment.  An effective form of 
contraception should be used for at least one month before and also 
throughout all trans retinoic acid therapy, and two months after .   I f  
pregnancy does occur during treatment, the physician and patien t should 
discuss the desirability of  continuing th e pregnancy.
c. PHARMACOLOGY
Pharmacokinetics :  Unlike cRA, little published data exists regarding the 
pharmacokinetics of tRA.  However, the pharmacologic transforma tions of tRA 
may resemble cRA. Under ambient light, cRA in solution equilibra tes with tRA in 
2 hours in a ratio of 3:1, cis:trans.  In vivo conversion occur s to a variable extent, 
tRA representing 0 - 30% of cRA plasma concentration in patients  taking oral 
cRA.  cRA is conjugated to glucoronic acid and is excreted via the biliary tract into 
the enterohepatic circulation.  cRA achieves peak plasma concen tration after oral 
dosing in 1.5 - 3.0 hours.  An 80 mg dosage of cRA produces peak  plasma levels 
approaching 1 μM; doses of 4 mg/kg produce peak plasma concentr ations of 4 
μM.  cRA shows a biphasic elimination profile with a t1/2ß of 2  - 4 hours and t1/2 ȕ
of 10 - 77 hours.  cRA oxidizes to 13-cis-4-ketoretinoic acid, t he major serum 
metabolite which accumulates with chronic cRA oral therapy to p roduce an AUC 
5-fold greater than the parent compound.
Formulation :  10 mg capsules of the active ingredient formulated with buty lated 
hydroxyanisole, disodium edate, refined soybean oil, BHA, and a  w a x  m i x t u r e  
consisting of purified beeswax, hydrogenated soybean oil flakes  and 
hydrogenated vegetable oil.  The capsules should be stored at r oom temperature 
protected from light.
Administration :  PO.
Supplier :  All Trans Retinoic Acid is commercially available and theref ore should 
be purchased by a third party.  This drug will NOT be supplied by [CONTACT_6812].

3.3 Daunomycin (Cerubidine) (daunorubicin hydrochloride) (NSC-82 151) 
a. DESCRIPTION
Daunomycin (Cerubidine) is the hydrochloride salt of an anthrac ycline antibiotic 
produced by a strain of Streptomyces oeruleorubidus .   I t  i n h i b i t s  s y n t h e s i s  o f  
nucleic acids, exhibiting antimitotic and cytotoxic activity.
b. TOXICITY
Human Toxicity :  Dose-limiting toxicity includes myelosuppression and 
cardiotoxicity.  Cumulative dose beyond 550 mg/M2results in increased risk for 
CHF.  Radiation therapy involving the heart and previous adriam ycin 
administration increases the risk for cardiomyopathy.  Hepatic and renal 
dysfunction may occur.  Other reactions include reversible alop ecia, nausea and 
vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea and mucositis.  If extravasation o ccurs during 
administration, tissue necrosis can result.  Rarely, chills, fe ver, skin rash and 
anaphylactoid reactions can occur.  Because of its teratogenic p roperties, women 
 
S0535

of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid pregnancy.   The occurrence 
of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in patients treated with 
anthracycline/alkylator combination chemotherapy.
c. PHARMACOLOGY
Kinetics :  Following IV injection, plasma levels rapi[INVESTIGATOR_888582].  Subs equently, 
levels decline slowly with half-life of 18.5 hours.  There is n o evidence of the drug 
crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Active metabolites are prese nt in the plasma 
one hour after injection.  Twenty-five percent of administered dose is eliminated 
by [CONTACT_888650] 40% by [CONTACT_782669].
Formulation : The drug is supplied in vials containing 20 mg of daunomycin as a 
reddish lyophilized powder.  The daunomycin should be reconstit uted with 4 mL

3.4 Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg®) (NSC-720568) (IND-66,366)
a. DESCRIPTION
Antineoplastic Agent, Monoclonal Antibody.
Mechanism of Action : Antibody to CD33 antigen, which is expressed on leukemic 
blasts in 80% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as  well as normal 
myeloid cells. Binding results in internalization of the antibo dy-antigen complex. 
Following internalization, the calicheamicin derivative is rele ased inside the 
myeloid cell. The calicheamicin derivative binds to DNA resulti ng in double strand 
breaks and cell death. Pluripotent stem cells and nonhematopoie tic cells are not 
affected.

3.5 6-Mercaptopurine (NSC-755)
a. DESCRIPTION
6-Mecaptopurine (6MP) is an antimetabolite chemically known as 1,7-dihydro-6H-
purine-6-thione monohydrate, an analogue of the purine bases, a denine and 
hypoxanthine.  6MP competes with hypoxanthine and guanine for t he enzyme, 
HGPRTase.  The conversion to TIMP inhibits IMP conversion to xa nthylic A and 
adenylic acid.  TIMP also inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpy rophosphate 
amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathwa y for purine 
ribonucleotide synthesis.
b. TOXICOLOGY
The dose limiting toxicity is myelosuppression.  Hyperuricemia may occur as a 
result of rapid cell lysis.  Tumor lysis syndrome with hyperuri cemia can be 
minimized with increased hydration, urine alkalinization and xa nthine oxidase 
inhibitors.  Since xanthine oxidase catabolizes 6MP, the simult aneous 
administration of allopurinol (a xanthine oxidase inhibitor) sh ould alert the 
investigator to reduce the dose of 6MP by 25 - 30% of the usual d ose.  In 
addition, enhanced marrow suppression has occurred in patients receiving 
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxizole.  Other reactions include mucosit is; skin rash; 
intestinal, rectal and genital ulcerations; nausea and vomiting ; anorexia, and 
diarrhea.  Progressive liver damage, increases in LFTs, jaundic e with intrahepatic 
cholestasis and parenchymal cell necrosis occur and may progres s to 
encephalopathy.  Drug fever, pulmonary infiltrates, electrolyte  imbalances, 
alopecia and fatigue have been reported.  Oligospermia has been  observed with 
oral administration.
 
S0535
Page 18
Version Date 12/26/14
c. PHARMACOLOGY
Kinetics :  Absorption of the oral dose of 6MP is incomplete and variabl e, 
averaging 50% of administered dose.  After intravenous administ ration, half life is 
21 minutes in children and 47 minutes in adults.  46% of an ora l dose is excreted 
in the urine in 24 hours.  The blood-brain transport is negligi ble.  Monitoring 
plasma levels of 6MP is of questionable value.
Formulation :  The drug is available in 50 mg tablets in bottles of 25 and 250.  
Storage and Stability :  The tablets should be stored at 15° - 25°C (59-77°F) in a 
dry place.
Administration :  PO.
Supplier :  6-Mercaptopurine is commercially available and therefore sho uld be 
purchased by a third party.  This drug will NOT be supplied by t he NCI.

3.6 Methotrexate (NSC-740)
a. DESCRIPTION
Methotrexate is an antimetabolite and has as its principle mech anism of action 
the competitive inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase.
b. TOXICOLOGY
Human Toxicology :  Adverse reactions include muco sitis (gingivitis, pharyngitis , 
stomatitis, enteritis, hematemesis, melena and ulceration), nau sea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, anorexia, myelosuppression, skin rashes, itching, hiv es, 
photosensitivity, pi[INVESTIGATOR_16576], alopecia, ecchymosis, a cne, 
telangiectasia, furunculosis, malaise, fatigue, chills, fever, dizziness, headache, 
blurred vision, decreased resistance to infection, impaired ren al function 
(including cystitis, azotemia, hematuria and acute renal failur e), hepatotoxicity 
(including elevated transaminase, fibrosis and cirrhosis), and pulmonary toxicity 
(including death from interstitial pneumonitis and chronic inte rstitial obstructive 
pulmonary disease).  Pulmonary symptoms (especially a dry, nonp roductive 
cough) may require interruption of treatment and special invest igation.  Central 
nervous system toxicities have included headache, drowsiness, b lurred vision, 
aphasia, hemiparesis, paresis, convulsions, transient subtle co gnitive dysfunction, 
mood alteration and unusual cranial sensations.  Leukoencephalo pathy may 
occur in patients who have had cranial irradiation.  Toxicity i s directly related to 
duration of blood levels.  Because the drug is excreted in the urine, impaired renal 
function is usually a contraindication to its use.  Calcium leu covorin must be 
administered after high-dose methotrexate to prevent life threa tening toxicity.  
Other potential toxicities include reproductive dysfunctions (d efective oogenesis 
or spermatogenesis, transient oligospermia, menstrual dysfuncti on, vaginal 
discharge, infertility), opportunistic infection, loss of libid o, myalgia, arthralgia, 
diabetes, osteoporosis, tinnitus, eye discomfort, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], sw eating and sudden 
death.  A few cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been report ed.  Patients with 
a known hypersensitivity to methotrexate should not receive the  drug.  Fetal death 
and/or congenital anomalies have been reported.  Women of child bearing 
potential should be cautioned.  Unexpectedly severe (sometimes fatal) marrow 
suppression and gastrointestinal toxicity have been reported wi th concomitant 
administration of methotrexate (usually in high doses) along wi th some non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  METHOTREXATE FORMULATIONS A ND 
DILUENTS CONTAINING PRESERVAT IVES MUST NOT BE USED FOR 
INTRATHECAL OR HIGH-DOSE METHOTREXATE THERAPY.

Version Date 12/26/14
c. PHARMACOLOGY
Kinetics :  Oral absorption appears to be dose dependent.  The absorptio n of 
doses greater than 80 mg/m2is significantly less than lower doses.  Methotrexate 
in serum is approximately fifty percent protein-bound.  It does  not penetrate the 
blood-brain barrier.  Terminal half-life is 3 - 10 hours for dos es less than 30 
mg/m2and 8 - 15 hours with higher doses.  With intravenous administra tion, 80 -
90% of unchanged methotrexate is excreted in the urine within 2 4 hours.  Ten 
percent or less is excreted in the bile.
Formulation :  Methotrexate is available as tablets for oral administration .
Storage and Stability :  The tablets should be stored at 15° - 25°C (59 - 77°F) in a 
dry place.
Administration :  PO.
Supplier: Methotrexate is commercially available and therefore should be 
purchased by a third party.  This drug will NOT be supplied by [CONTACT_6812].

A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_888586] ( 1,000/mcl) or on Day 42 after beginning protocol ATRA (i.e. not  
counting any days of ATRA given prior to the patients registrat ion to this study), 
whichever comes first.  Specimens of marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337] (or periph eral blood if dry 
tap) must be submitted for cytogenetics (for patients affiliate d  w i t h  C A L G B  o r  
ECOG) and PCR (for all patients) as described in Section 15.0.  Subsequently, 
the bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_888587] 2 we eks until criteria 
for CR are met.  These subsequent samples will NOT be submitted  centrally for 
cytogenetic or RT-PCR testing, but the tests will still be perf ormed locally.  Testing 
for clinical/hematological CR should be performed locally for a ll of these 
subsequent specimens.  Patients will continue ATRA and arsenic trioxide until CR 
is achieved, up to a maximum of 90 days.  Patients with a CR wil l proceed to 
consolidation therapy as outlined above in Section 7.4.
b. Consolidation
A bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_888588] 8 week s (preferably 
within 4 weeks) preceding Consolidation Cycle 1.  This should be  performed at 
the time when peripheral blood counts have recovered to baselin e or as clinically

7.9 Supportive Care Guidelines
a. Infection Prophylaxis
1. Extremely careful hand washing by [CONTACT_888659].
2. Diet should exclude raw fruits, vegetables and unprocessed foo ds.
3. Antibiotic prophylaxis with oral antimicrobial agents is stro ngly 
recommended for all patients as indicated in the following tabl e.

500/mcl.  During each cycle of consolidation it is recommended that the 
same treatment be resumed on Day 7 and stopped when the absolut e 
granulocyte count is > 500/mcl.  If the absolute granulocyte cou nt does 
not drop below 500/mcl following chemotherapy, then the antimic robial 
prophylaxis should be stopped on Day 21 of each cycle.
b. Management of Infection and Use of Antibiotics
1. Any neutropenic patient (absolute granulocyte count < 500/mcl ) with an 
oral temperature exceeding 38°C on more than one occasion withi n a 
single (24 hour) day or a single temperature greater than 38.5°C  should
have broad-spectrum intravenous empi[INVESTIGATOR_888592].  Prior to antibiot ic 
administration urine culture, urinalysis and [ADDRESS_1243755]-spectrum empi[INVESTIGATOR_888593].  The reg imen should 
be chosen based on the susceptibility pattern of the predominan t 
pathogens at the treating hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307].  Possible regimens to use a re listed 
below.
i. Monotherapy with imipenem
ii. Combination therapy with an anti-pseudomonal penicillin 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]) and a third generation cephalosporin (ceftazidim e or 
cefoperazone).
iii. Combination therapy with an anti-pseudomonal penicillin 
(pi[INVESTIGATOR_049]) and an anti-pseudomonal aminoglycoside (amikacin).
iv. Combination therapy with a third generation cephalosporin 
(ceftazidime or cefoperazone) and an anti-pseudomonal 
aminoglycoside (amikacin).
3. If the patient is persistently febrile after 72 hours, additi onal antibiotic 
and/or antifungal coverage should be considered.  If culture da ta indicate 
a more favorable antibiotic regimen, then the appropriate antib iotics will 
be substituted.  An infectious disease consultant should be con sidered 
for patients with persistent fever at [ADDRESS_1243756]-spectrum antibiotics u ntil the 
absolute granulocyte count is > 500/mcl and the patient is afeb rile.
 
S0535

1. The hemoglobin should be maintained at a safe level, especial ly in 
severely thrombocytopenic patients (e.g., hemoglobin > 8 - 10 gr ams/dl).
2. The platelet count should be maintained greater than 10,000/m cl in non-
bleeding patients.  In the presence of fever or hypertension, pl atelet 
transfusion to 20,000/mcl is recommended.  In the presence of ac tive 
hemorrhage or suspected gastrointestinal bleeding, platelet tra nsfusion to 
a minimum count of 50,000/mcl is recommended.  Maintenance of 
platelet count of 30,000-50,000/mcl, particularly at or near th e time of 
diagnosis and initiation of therapy, is recommended, particularl y in the 
setting of active DIC.
3. Patients who are refractory to random donor platelets (single  donor or 
pooled) should receive HLA-matched platelet transfusions if pos sible.  An 
unsatisfactory one-hour platelet count increment is less than 2 0% of 
expected rise (expected rise is 5,000 per unit platelets transf used).
4. Cryoprecipi[INVESTIGATOR_888594] a 
level of 100-150 mg/dl.
d. Mucosal and Nutritional Considerations
1. Mucositis may be severe.  Although prophylactic use of flucon azole and 
acyclovir is expected to reduce infectious causes, mucosal lesi ons should 
be cultured for fungal, viral and bacterial organisms.
2. Malnutrition may be severe and prolonged in elderly patients undergoing 
intensive chemotherapy.  Early institution of hyperalimentation  i s  
recommended when oral intake becomes inadequate.
e. Growth Factors
1. Growth factors (e.g., GM-CSF, G-CSF, or erythropoietin) may be  used at 
the discretion of the treating physician in cases of serious or  l i f e -
threatening infection.  It should be pointed out that the benef it of growth 
factors in this setting is unclear.
7.10 Intake Calendar
ATRA, 6-MP, and methotrexate drug compliance will be recorded b y patients on the 
Intake Calendar (see Appendix 18.3).  Institutional CRAs will review and ascertain patient 
adherence with protocol treatment.  Do not submit the Intake Ca lendar to the Data 
Operations Center.
7.11 Criteria for Removal from Protocol Treatment
a. Patients whose pretreatment RT-PCR assays are found to be PML -RARĮ-
negative will be removed from protocol treatment and receive no  further treatment
under this protocol (see Section 7.3d).
b. Delay of more than 5 days prior to initiation of gemtuzumab o zogamicin during 
induction.
c. Patients who fail to achieve A1 marrow, B1 blood, and C1 extr amedullary disease 
status (see Section 10.1) within 90 days of initiation of induction therapy will not 
be eligible for consolidation therapy and will receive no furth er treatment under 
this protocol.

8.0 TOXICITIES TO BE MONITORED AND DOSAGE MODIFICATIONS
 
8.1 NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
 
Two different versions of the NCI Common Terminology Criteria f or Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) will be used on this study.
 
a. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reporting
The CTCAE (NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) Version 4.0 will
be utilized for SAE reporting on ly.  The CTCAE Version 4.0 is i dentified and located 
at the CTEP website at
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicati ons/ctc.htm.  All 
appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the  CTCAE Version 
4.0.
b. Routine toxicity reporting
 
This study will utilize the CTCAE Version 3.0 for routine toxic ity reporting.  A copy of 
the CTCAE Version 3.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP home page  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov).  All appropriate treatment areas shou ld have access to a 
copy of the CTCAE Version 3.0.  
 
8.2 Toxicities to be Monitored
The toxicities of the agents included in this regimen are well established, and are outlined 
above in Section 3.0. Dose modifications of study medications will be made based upon  
attribution of toxicity to drug therapy rather than disease.

8.3 Induction Therapy
a. Dose Modifications for ATRA During Induction
xCommonly observed toxicities with ATRA include hepatotoxicity ( increased 
AST and ALT), neurologic changes (headache or pseudotumor cereb ri), 
mucocutaneous changes (dry skin, peeling of palms and soles) an d others 
including cheilitis, epi[INVESTIGATOR_3940], fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and conjunctivitis. 
If a patient experiences a Grade 3 toxicity, ATRA will be held until the toxicity 
has resolved to Grade 1.  At that time, restart ATRA at 75% dose.  
Recurrent epi[INVESTIGATOR_888595] 3 toxicity will result in discontinuation of ATRA 
until the toxicity resolves to dGrade 1; ATRA will then be resumed with an 
additional 25% dose reduction.  Patients requiring dose reducti ons that would 
reduce the dose to less than 25% of the starting dose should be  removed 
from ATRA (continue other therapy) for the remainder of the cyc l e .   A TR A  
may be used again in subsequent cycles if toxicity has resolved to Grade 1.
xThe ATRA syndrome should be treated as outlined in Section 7.3b.
xIf ATRA related Grade t3 toxicity (excluding ATRA syndrome) does not 
resolve to dGrade 1 within 14 days of occurrence, ATRA will be permanently 
discontinued.

Hematologic Acute Hemolysis:  In the case of acute hemolysis (C TCAE 3.0 
Grade 3), hold treatment until complete resolution, then resume treat ment with 
a 50% dose reduction (0.075 mg/kg/day).  No dose adjustment is necessary for 
pancytopenia of any grade.  If toxicity persists for more than 14 days after holding 
treatment or recurrent acute hemolysis occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_888596], then 
discontinue arsenic trioxide.
Dermatologic Toxicity:  In the case of rash (CTCAE 3.0 Grade 3), hold 
treatment until clear clinical evidence of improvement to dGrade 1, then resume 
treatment with a 50% dose reduction (0.075 mg/kg/day).  If toxic ity persists for 
more than 14 days after holding treatment or recurrent dermatol ogic toxicity 
occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574], then discontinue As2O3.

nausea and vomiting occur despi[INVESTIGATOR_888598]-emeti cs, then 
discontinue As 2O3 .
xNeurologic Toxicity :  In the case of moderate-severe objective sensory loss 
or paresthesias; motor weakness; clinically evident hearing los s; locomotor 
ataxia or dysmetria; agitation, confusion, or hallucination the n hold treatment 
until clear clinical evidence of resolution to dGrade 1 and then resume

for more than 14 days after holding treatment or recurrent mode rate-severe 
neurologic toxicity occurs despi[INVESTIGATOR_16574], then discont inue As2O3.
xCardiac Toxicity :  Guidelines for the management of prolonged QTc interval 
are as follows:
xEKG must be obtained twice weekly during induction therapy and as 
clinically indicated.
- Measure the QT interval (from the start of the Q wave to the e nd of 
the T wave) and the preceding RR interval.  The QTc interval wil l be 
calculated as the QT interval (msec) divided by [CONTACT_888660] (msec).
- QTc interval 500 msec: No specific therapy needed.  Continue 
As2O3.  Serum K+ and Mg++ should be monitored and repeated only  
if low.
- QTc interval 500-600 msec:  Hold As2O3 temporarily and replete  
serum K+ and Mg++ with IV and/or oral K+ and Mg++ to minimum 
target levels of 4.0 and 2.0 mg/dL, respectively.  Resume As2O3  on 
same day if target levels are achieved and re-check prior to ne xt 
dose.
- QTc interval !600 msec:  Hold As2O3.  Aggressive IV K+ and Mg++ 
repletion (for adults MgSO4 can be given as 2 g IV, followed by  [CONTACT_8622] 
12 g in 6 hours).  If the QTc interval falls below 600 msec, th e patient 
can be sent home with additional oral supplements and should re turn 
the following day for re-checking prior to further As2O3 treatm ent.  If 
the QTc interval does not fall below 600 msec with this level o f 
repletion, the patient should undergo EKG monitoring by [CONTACT_888661],

b. Dose Modifications for Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (G.O.) during Co nsolidation
xHepatotoxicity
If CTCAE 3.[ADDRESS_1243762], ALT, or bilirubin elevation occurred  d u r i n g  
induction therapy (thought to be drug-related, and not disease r elated), G.O. 
dose will be reduced to 6 mg/m2during Consolidation Cycle 5.  If Grade 2-[ADDRESS_1243763], ALT, or bilirubin elevation recurs following Day 1 of G.O.  d u r i n g  
Consolidation Cycle 5, the dose of G.O. during Consolidation Cycl e 6 will be 
decreased to 3 mg/m2.
For patients in whom Grade 2-[ADDRESS_1243764], ALT, or bilirubin elevation  d i d  N O T  
occur during induction, but occurs following Day 1 of Consolida tion Cycle 5,
the dose of G.O. during Consolidation Cycle 6 will be decreased t o 6 mg/m2.
For patients that experience Grade [ADDRESS_1243765], ALT, or bilirubin ele vation 
following G.O. during any course, further G.O. will NOT be admi nistered.  In 
these instances, a hepatic doppler ultrasound is required to ev aluate for 
hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome.
In any case where there is Grade 3 bilirubin elevation, a hepat ic doppler 
ultrasound is recommended to evaluate for hepatic sinusoidal ob structive 
syndrome.
xHematologic Toxicity
Following the initiation of Consolidation Cycle 5, delayed reco very of 
peripheral blood to B1 status (see Section 10.1) beyond 8 weeks will require 
discontinuation of further G.O. therapy, and patients will proc eed to 
Maintenance Therapy.
xAnaphylactic reaction
For patients experiencing anaphylactic reaction with this agent  during 
induction, gemtuzumab ozogamicin will be permanently discontinu ed.
c. Dose Modification for Daunomycin during Consolidation
xHepatotoxicity (for patients with evidence of hepatic dysfuncti on, 
reassess regularly during daunorubicin treatment).  
Bilirubin % Dose to Give
> 3.0 mg/dL 75%
xCardiotoxicity :  Adequate LV function will be required as described 
previously.  Patients judged not to have adequate LV function sh ould be 
discussed with the Study Chair.
d. Dose Modifications for Arsenic Trioxide during Consolidation
xSee Section 8.3.b above.  For patients requiring dose reduction of arsenic 
trioxide during induction due to toxicity, the starting dose for  consolidation 
should be reduced to the acceptable dose determined during indu ction.  For 
patients in whom arsenic trioxide was permanently discontinued during 
induction therapy, arsenic trioxide will be omitted from Consol idation Cycles 1
and 2, and patients will proceed to Consolidation Cycle 3.  For  patients 
experiencing toxicity from arsenic trioxide during consolidatio n (in the 
absence of previous toxicity during induction), dose adjustment guidelines as 
stated in Section 8.3b should be followed.

calculation of drug dosages will be considered a major protocol  deviation.  Physicians who 
are uncomfortable with administering chemotherapy dose based on  actual body weight 
should not enroll obese patients on this protocol.

10.0 CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS
10.1 Disease Status Criteria:
NOTE that the kinds of cells considered equivalent to blasts and inc luded in the 
calculation of blast percentages depend on the FAB classificati on (see Section 4.1a.2 )
a. Bone Marrow:
A1. Maturation of all cell lines ; and < 5% blasts; and no Auer r ods.
A2. Same a V$H[FHSWEODVWVDQG
A3. Failure to meet the criteria for A1 or A2.
b. Peripheral Blood:
B1. Neutrophils > 1,000/mcl; and platelets > 100,000/mcl; and no  leukemia 
blasts in the peripheral blood.
B2. Failure to meet the criteria for B1.
c. Extramedullary Disease:
C1. NoneC2. Any
10.2 Complete Remission (CR) 
Attainment of A1 marrow status and B1 peripheral blood status a nd C1 extramedullary 
disease status.
10.3 Molecular Remission (MCR)  
Attainment of CR with no evidence of the PML-RAR alpha transcri pt as measured by 
[CONTACT_954].
10.4 Partial Remission (PR)
Attainment of A2 marrow status and B1 peripheral and C1 extrame dullary disease status.
10.5 Treatment Failures  
Patients who fail to achieve CR or PR following induction will be classified according to 
the type of failure:
a. Resistant Disease:
patient survives > [ADDRESS_1243778] recent  peripheral blood 
smear or bone marrow after completion of therapy.
b. Not Assessable :  patient survives > [ADDRESS_1243779]-induction bone marrow examination.
 
S0535
Page 42
Version Date 12/26/14
c. Treatment Failure Due to Death :
1. patient survives < 30 days after completion of initial treatm ent course with 
evidence of persistent leukemia in the peripheral smear and pos t 
induction bone marrow examination.
2. patient survives < 30 days following completion of initial tre atment course 
then dies without determination of response. 
10.6 Relapse from CR  
Reappearance of leukemic blasts in the peripheral blood; or > 5 % blasts in the bone 
marrow not attributable to another cause (e.g., recovery of nor mal cells following 
chemotherapy-induced aplasia); or appearance or reappearance of  extramedullary 
disease or reappearance of PML-RAR alpha (in patients who had a chieved MCR) via 
cytogenetics, FISH, or PCR in the blood or bone marrow, confirm ed at least once 4 - 8
weeks later.  If there are no circulating blasts and no extrame dullary disease and the bone

percentage is > 5% is necessary to establish relapse.
10.7 Event-free survival (EFS) at 3 years
For this study, EFS at 3 years is defined as a binary variable as follows:  Yes if the patient 
achieves CR (Section 10.2) and remains in continuous CR until at least 3 years after 
entering the study; otherwise No.
10.8 Toxicity Criteria
The NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 3.0 will be used to 
determine severity of toxicity.  
10.9 Performance Status
Patients will be graded according to the Zubrod performance sta tus scale.
POINT DESCRIPTION
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance wit hout 
restriction.
1 Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and  
able to carry out work of a light or sedentary nature, e.g., li ght 
housework, office work.  
2 Ambulatory and capable of self-care but unable to carry out an y 
work activities; up and about more than 50% of waking hours.

Version Date 12/26/[ADDRESS_1243781] whether the regim en incorporating ATRA, 
arsenic trioxide, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin is sufficiently saf e and effective among 
patients with previously untreated high-risk acute promyelocyti c leukemia to warrant 
Phase III study.  This objective will be met by [CONTACT_888662] (CCR) at [ADDRESS_1243782] 6 weeks 
of protocol treatment.  If the 3-year CCR rate is sufficiently high AND the 6-week mortality 
rate is sufficiently low, then Phase III study might be warrant ed; otherwise further study 
would not be recommended.  To define a test criterion based on both outcomes, it is 
necessary to define null and alternative hypotheses in terms of  the joint distribution of 
efficacy and toxicity.
The regimen would not warrant Phase III study if its true 3-yea r CCR rate is 50% or less 
OR its 6-week mortality rate is 30% or more.  Therefore, the jo int distribution of the null 
hypothesis with marginal probabilities is the following:
 
S0535
Page 44
Version Date 12/26/14
Null Hypothesis Joint Distribution:
Death within Died or relapsed Alive in CR
first 6 weeks within 3 years, or no CR               at 3 years
Yes 30% 0%
No 20% 50%
The regimen would warrant Phase III study if its true 3-year CC R rate is 70% or higher 
AND its true fatal toxicity rate is 15% or less.  Therefore, the  joint distribution of the 
alternative hypothesis with marginal probabilities is the follo wing:
Alternative Hypothesis Joint Distribution:Death within Died or relapsed Alive in CR
first 6 weeks within 3 years, or no CR at 3 years
Yes 15% 0%
No 15% 70%
Because there is only limited Group-wide experience with this r egimen, accrual will be 
conducted in two steps.  In the first step, [ADDRESS_1243783] 6 weeks, then Phase II I study will be warranted.  
For the null hypothesis joint distribution above, the probability  of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] 0.79,
and the critical level (the probability of erroneously concludi ng that the regimen warrants 
Phase III study) of the study is 0.033.  For the joint distribu tion of the alternative 
hypothesis, the probability of early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_8169] 0.096, and the  power (the probability of 
correctly concluding that Phase III study is warranted) is 0.89 .  The statistical 
characteristics are summarized in the following table:
Hypothesis Null Alternative 
Probability of 8+ deaths 0.[ADDRESS_1243784] 32 patients
Probability of 41+ CCR at 3 yrs and 0.033 0.89

16.1 Adverse Event Reporting Requirements
a. Purpose
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required  as part of every 
clinical trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrol led in the studies as 
well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar a gents. Adverse events 
are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times during a tr ial. (Directions for 
routine reporting are provided in Section 14.0.) Additionally, certain adverse 
events must be reported in an expedited manner to allow for mor e timely 
monitoring of patient safety an d care. The following guidelines  prescribe 
expedited adverse event reporting for this protocol. See also A ppendix 18.1 for 
general and background information about expedited reporting.
b. Reporting Method
This study requires that expedited adverse event reporting use CTEP’s Adverse 
Event Reporting System (CTEP-AERS). The NCI’s guidelines for CT EP-AERS
can be found at http://ctep.cancer.gov. A CTEP-AERS report must b e submitted 
to the Southwest Oncology Group Operations Office electronicall y via the CTEP-
AERS Web-based application located at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopmnet/electronic_applicati ons/adverse_even
ts.htm.
c. When to report an event in an expedited manner
Some adverse events require 24-hour notification (refer to Tabl e 16.1) via CTEP-
AERS. When Internet connectivity is disrupted, a 24-hour notifi cation is to be 
made to SWOG by [CONTACT_1381] [PHONE_13560].  Once Internet conne ctivity is 
restored, a 24-hour notification that was phoned in must be ent ered electronically 
into CTEP-AERS by [CONTACT_433].
When the adverse event requires expedited reporting, submit the  report within the 
number of calendar days of learning of the event specified in T able 16.[ADDRESS_1243808] one dose of the 
investigational agent(s) as part of the trial. Reporting requir ements are provided in 
Table 16.1. The investigational agent(s) used in Induction and Consolidat ion 
Cycles [ADDRESS_1243809] at the Opera tions Office, 
210/614-8808 or [EMAIL_1196], before preparing the report.

h. Reporting Secondary Malignan cy, including  AML/ALL/MDS
1. A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by [CONTACT_437] a previous 
malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/interven tion, 
radiation or chemotherapy).  A secondary malignancy is not cons idered a 
metastasis of the initial neoplasm.
SWOG requires all secondary malignancies that occur following 
treatment with an agent under a Non-NCI IND to be reported via CTEP-
AERS.  Three options are available to describe the event.
xLeukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., Acute 
Myelocytic Leukemia [AML])
xMyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)
xTreatment-related secondary malignancy
Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including 
AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mech anisms 
outlined in each protocol.
Second Malignancy: A second malignancy is one unrelated to the 
treatment of a prior malignancy (and is NOT a metastasis from the initial malignancy). Second malignancies require ONLY routine reporting via 
CDUS unless otherwise specified .
For more information see:

NOTE: If a patient has been enrolled in more than one NCI-spons ored 
study, the report must be submitted for the most recent trial.
i. Reporting Pregnancy, Fetal Death, and Death Neonatal
1. Pregnancy Study participants who become pregnant while on study; that 
pregnancy should be reported in an expedited manner via CTEP-AE RS as 
Grade 3 “Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions – Other 
(pregnancy)” under the Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions SOC.  
 
Revised 4/16/14 S0535
Page 60
Version Date 12/26/14
Additionally, the pregnancy outcome for patients on study should be reported via CTEP-AERS at the time the outcome becomes known, accompanied by [CONTACT_90324].
2. Fetal Death Fetal Death defined in CTCAE as “A disorder characterized by 
[CONTACT_260765]; failure of the product of conception to show ev idence of 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], heartbeat, or definite movement of a voluntary mus cle after 
expulsion from the uterus, without possibility of resuscitation ” should be 
reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal 
conditions – Other (pregnancy loss)” under the Pregnancy, 
puerperium and per inatal conditions SOC.  
3. Death Neonatal  Neonatal death, defined in CTCAE as “A disorder 
characterized by [CONTACT_52372] 2 8 days of life” 
that is felt by [CONTACT_888674]/intervention should be reported expeditiously.  
A neonatal death should be reported expeditiously as Grade 4 “General 
disorders and administration – Other (neonatal loss)” under the
General disorders and administration SOC.
Fetal death and neonatal death should NOT be reported as a Grade 5 event.  If 
reported as such, the CTEP-AERS interprets this as a death of the patient being 
treated.
NOTE:   When submitting CTEP-AERS reports for “Pregnancy, “Pregnancy loss”, or 
“Neonatal loss”, the Pregnancy Information Form should also be completed and 
faxed with any additional medical information to [PHONE_100].  The potential risk of 
exposure of the fetus to the investigational agent(s) or chemot herapy agent(s) 
should be documented in the “Description of Event” section of t he CTEP-AERS 
report.
The Pregnancy Information Form is available at:

18.1 Determination of Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Requirem ents
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required  as part of every clinical 
trial, are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in th e studies as well as those who 
will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse eve nts are reported in a routine 
manner at scheduled times during a trial. (Directions for routi ne reporting are provided in 
Section 14.0.) Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to allow for more timely monitoring of patient safety an d care. Expedited adverse 
event reporting principles and general guidelines follow; speci fic guidelines for expedited 
adverse event reporting on this protocol are found in Section 16.0.
Reporting requirements may include the following considerations : 1) whether the patient 
has received an investigational or commercial agent; 2) the cha racteristics of the adverse 
event including the grade (severity), the relationship to the study therapy (attribution), and 
the prior experience (expectedness) of the adverse event; 3) the Phase (I, II, or II I) of the 
trial; and 4) whether or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_888608]. 
An investigational agent is a protocol drug administered under an Investigational New 
Drug Submission (IND). In some instances, the investigational a gent may be available 
commercially, but is actually being tested for indications not included in the approved 
package label. 
Commercial agents are those agents not provided under an IND bu t obtained instead 
from a commercial source. The NCI, rather than a commercial dis tributor, may on some 
occasions distribute commercial agents for a trial.
When a study includes both investigational and commercial agent s, the following rules 
apply.
xConcurrent administration : When an investigational agent(s) is used in 
combination with a commercial agent(s), the combination is cons idered to be 
investigational and expedited re porting of adverse events would follow the 
guidelines for investigational agents.
xSequential administration : When a study includes an investigational agent(s) and 
a commercial agent(s) on the same study arm, but the commercial  agent(s) is 
given for a period of time prior to starting the investigational  agent(s), expedited 
reporting of adverse events that occur prior to starting the in vestigational agent(s) 
would follow the guidelines for commercial agents. Once therapy  with the 
investigational agent(s) is initiated, all expedited reporting of adverse events 
should follow the investigational guidelines.
Steps to determine if an adverse event is to be reported in an expedited manner
Step 1 : Identify the type of event using the NCI Common Terminology C riteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE). The CTCAE provides descriptive terminology and a grading scale for 
each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be downloade d from the CTEP 
home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov). Additionally, if assistance  is needed, the NCI has an 
Index to the CTCAE that provides help for classifying and locat ing terms. All appropriate 
treatment locations should have access to a copy of the CTCAE.
Step 2 :Grade the event using the NCI CTCAE version specified.
Step 3 :Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy 
(investigational or commercial). Attribution categories are as follows: Unrelated, 
Unlikely, Possible, Probable, and Definite.

Step 4 :Determine the prior experience of the adverse event. Expected events are those 
that have been previously identified as resulting from administ ration of the agent. An 
adverse event is considered unexpected, for expedited reporting purposes only, when 
either the type of event or the severity of the event is not listed in 
xthe current NCI Agent-Specific Adverse Event List (for treatmen ts using agents 
provided under an NCI-held IND);
xthe drug package insert (for treatments with commercial agents only);
xSection 3.0of this protocol.
Step 5 :Review Table 16.1 in the protocol to determine if there are any protocol-specific 
requirements for expedited reporting of specific adverse events that require special 
monitoring.
Step 6 :Determine if the protocol treatment given prior to the adverse event included an 
investigational agent(s), a commercial agent(s), or a combination of investigational and 
commercial agents.
NOTE: This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_1243815] dose of treatment and is 
attributed possibly, probably, or definitely to the agent(s) mu st be reported according to 
the instructions above.

Revised 4/16/[ADDRESS_1243816]. Lance t, the Study Chair, will be 
the primary author.  [CONTACT_888713], the SWOG statistician , will be the 2ndauthor; 
and [CONTACT_305881], the Leukemia Committee Chair of the SWOG, wi ll be the senior (last)
author.  The three laboratory investigators who will perform RT -PCR assays to determine 
eligibility on this trial (Drs. Willman, Gallagher, and Stock) will also be members of the 
writing committee.
The other members of the writing committee will be determined a ccording to the level of 
participation in the study as measured by [CONTACT_888677].  The number 
of investigators on the Writing Committee from each participatin g cooperative group (e.g., 
SWOG, CALGB, ECOG, NCIC CTG, COG) will be based on the followin g accrual 
formula.  Each group that enrolls at least 5% of the entire stu dy population will have one 
member on the writing committee.  Each group will be entitled t o an additional member of 
the Writing Committee for each additional 10% of the overall ac crual.  For example, if a 
group enrolled 15% of the study patients, that group would have  2 co-authors on the 
committee; if 25% of the study patients were enrolled, that gro up would have 3 co-
authors.  The SWOG will be assigned additional members of the W riting Committee only 
after that group accrues > 25% of the total study patients.  It  will be the responsibility of 
each cooperating group to name [CONTACT_888703].  By [CONTACT_115564], it is anticipated th at the final Writing Committee 
will include approximately 12-14 of the clinical and/or laborat ory investigators who have 
most involved in the design, conduct, and analysis of this stud y.  
A smaller number of individuals (such as Disease Committee or C orrelative Science 
Committee chairs) may warrant acknowledgment (with their group affiliation) in the final 
manuscript for their support of the conduct of the study and fo r their critical review of this 
manuscript.  The participation of each cooperative group that e nrolls any patients on this 
intergroup study will be acknowledged in the final manuscript w ith their respective grant 
support.

You are being asked to take pa rt in this study because you have  high-risk acute promyelocytic 
leukemia (APL) t hat has never been treated.
Why is this study being done?
The purpose of this study is to l earn about the effects of treati ng your APL with 
chemotherapy.  The chemotherapy f or APL has three parts:  induc tion therapy, 
consolidation therapy, and main tenance therapy.  The purpose of  the induction therapy is 
to eliminate the signs and symp toms of your APL from your body.  If this happens, your 
APL will be in "remission".  Con solidation therapy and maintena nce therapy are intended 
to make your remission l ast as long as possible.
One of the main purposes of this trial is to study the effects, good and/or bad, of a unique 
combination and schedule of che motherapy drugs f or people who h ave difficult-to-treat 
APL. One of the se chemotherapy drugs, ge mtuzumab ozogamicin, is experimental.

Reproductive risks:  You should not become pregn ant or father a  baby [CONTACT_888690].  Wom en should not breastfeed a 
baby [CONTACT_56035].  It is  important you understand that you need to use b irth control 
while on this study.  Che ck with your study d octor about what k ind of birth control 
methods to use and how long to u se them.  Some methods might no t be approved for use in 
this study.  
Pregnancy testing is required for women with reproductive potent ial before induction and 
is strongly recommended before t he third course of  consolidation  therapy and before 
maintenance therapy.
Women should be fully counseled on  the serious ris k to the fetu s should they become 
pregnant while undergoing treatme nt with ATRA.  An effective fo rm of contraception 
should be used for at  least one month befo re and also throughou t ATRA therapy, and two 
months after.  If pregnancy do es occur during treatment, you sh ould discuss this with your 
doctor immediately, and you will be  removed from protocol thera py.  (11/12/08)
For more information  about risks and side  effects, ask your stu dy doctor.
Are there benefits to tak ing part in the study?
Taking part in this study may or  may not make you r health bette r.  While docto rs hope the 
treatment used in thi s study will be more useful against APL com pared to the usual 
treatment, there is n o proof of this yet. We  do know that the i nformation from this study 
will help doctors learn more ab out using these drugs as a treat ment for APL.  This 
information could help future cancer patients.
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this stud y?
Your other choices may include:
xGetting treatment or care for you r cancer without being in a st udy
xTaking part in another study
xGetting no treatment
xGetting comfort care, also calle d palliative car e.  This type o f care helps reduce pain, 
tiredness, appetite problems and  other problems c aused by [CONTACT_941] c ancer.  It does not 
treat the cancer directly, but i nstead tries to improve how you  feel.  Comfort care 
tries to keep you as active and comfortable as possible.  
Talk to your doctor about your ch oices before you  decide if you  will take part in this study.

Specimen Consent Supplemental Sheets
How are Specimens Used for Research?Where do specimens come from?A specimen may be from a blood sample or from bone marrow, skin , toenails or other body materials.  
People who are trained to handle specimens and protect donors' rights make sure that the highest 
standards of quality control are followed by [CONTACT_888698].  Your doctor does not work for 
the Southwest Oncology Group, but has agreed to help collect sp ecimens from many patients.  Many 
doctors across the country are helpi[INVESTIGATOR_60773].  
Why do people do research with specimens?Research with specimens can help to find out more about what ca uses cancer, how to prevent it, how to 
treat it, and how to cure it.  Research using specimens can als o answer other health questions.  Some of 
these include finding the causes of diabetes and heart disease,  or finding genetic links to Alzheimer's.
What type of research will be done with my specimen?Many different kinds of studies use specimens.  Some researcher s may develop new tests to find 
diseases.  Others may develop new ways to treat or even cure di seases.  In the future, some of the 
research may help to develop new products, such as tests and dr ugs.  Some research looks at diseases 
that are passed on in families (called genetic research).  Rese arch done with your specimen may look for 
genetic causes and signs of disease.
How do researchers get the specimen?
Researchers from universities, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], and other health orga nizations conduct research using 
specimens.  They contact [CONTACT_888699] l e s fo r  t h e i r  st u d i e s.   Th e  
Southwest Oncology Group reviews the way that these studies wil l be done, and decides if any of the 
samples can be used. The Southwest Oncology Group gets the spec imen and information about you from 
your hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and sends the specimen samples and some informat ion about you to the researcher.  The 
Southwest Oncology Group will not send your name, address, phon e number, social security number or 
any other identifying information to the researcher.
Will I find out the results of t he research using my specimen?
You will not receive the results of research done with your spe cimen.  This is because research can take a 
long time and must use specimen samples from many people before  results are known.  Results from 
research using your specimen may not be ready for many years an d will not affect your care right now, but 
they may be helpful to people like you in the future.
Why do you need information from my health records?In order to do research with your specimen, researchers may nee d to know some things about you.  (For 
example:  Are you male or female?  What is your race or ethnic group? How old are you?  Have you ever 
smoked?)  This helps researchers answer questions about disease s.  The information that will be given to 
the researcher may include your age, sex, race, diagnosis, trea tments and family history.  This information 
is collected by [CONTACT_60859][INVESTIGATOR_231571].  If more 
information is needed, the Southwest Oncology Group will send i t to the researcher.
Will my name [CONTACT_888706] r ecords that are g iven to the r esearcher?
No.  Your name, address, phone number and anything else that co uld identify you will be removed before 
they go the researcher.  The researcher will not know who you a re.

How could the records be used in ways that might be harmful to me?
Sometimes, health records have been used against patients and t heir families.  For example, insurance 
companies may deny a patient insurance or employers may not hir e someone with a certain illness (such 
as AIDS or cancer).  The results of genetic research may not ap ply only to you, but to your family 
members too.  For disease caused by [CONTACT_60860], the informati on in one person's health record could 
be used against family members.
How am I protected?
The Southwest Oncology Group is in charge of making sure that i nformation about you is kept private.  
The Southwest Oncology Group will take careful steps to prevent  misuse of records.  Your name, 
address, phone number and any other identifying information wil l be taken off anything associated with 
your specimen before it is given to the researcher.  This would  make it very difficult for any research 
results to be linked to you or your family.  Also, people outsi de the research process will not have access 
to results about any one person which will help to protect your  privacy.
Where will my specimens be kept?
Your blood and/or bone marrow will be kept at:

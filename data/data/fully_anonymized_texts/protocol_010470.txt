Olfactory and gustatory disorders (OGDs) are hallmarks of COVID -19 infection. The 
prevalence of COVID -related OGD symptoms ranges from 17 -80% depending on viral 
variant, and the prevalence usin g objective chemosensory  testing is likely even  higher. 
The median recovery time for olfactory dysfunction is approximately [ADDRESS_1270695] beyond 90 days and 6 months in 15% and 5% of 
patients , respectively . OGDs have numerous adverse effects such as loss of cortical 
gray matter and decrease in quality of life. Intranasal and  oral corticosteroids as well as 
olfactory training are currently used to treat post -viral OD ; however they have 
demonstrated limited efficacy and there is no current gold standard of care.  
There is no current consensus on the pathogenesis of COVID -related anosmia ; however 
evidence for post -viral olfactory dysfunction suggests sensory axonal regeneration and 
olfactory signaling may rely on elevated levels of secondary messengers cAMP and 
cGMP . Elevation of cAMP  and cGMP  is a known effect of theophylline , a 
phosphodiesterase inhibitor used to treat asthma . In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_905253] -[ADDRESS_1270696] minimal adverse effects due to limited systemic absorption.  
A3 Purpose of the Study Protocol  
To elucidate the efficacy and safety of intranasal theophylline irrigation in the treatment 
of COVID -19 related OD in comparison to placebo saline irrigation.  
B Background  
 
B1 Prior Literature and Studies  
 
COVID -19 Pandemic.  In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_11520] 2 (SARS -CoV-2), was identified in association with pneumonia in 
Wuhan China.1-[ADDRESS_1270697] 
been infected with the resulting illness, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). 
The [LOCATION_002] has more  cases than any other country, at over 5 million. The 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 3 numbers continue to grow exponentiall y.4 The CDC has listed the following key 
symptoms suggestive of illness with COVID -19: cough, shortness of breath or difficulty 
breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, and new loss of smell or taste.5  
 
Anosmi a Prevalence in COVID -19. Subjective  olfactory dysfunction (OD)  has been 
reported in up to 80% of patients  with COVID -19, with varying incidence depending on 
viral variant .6,[ADDRESS_1270698] (UPSIT).9 Using a smartphone -based app (COVID Symptom 
Tracker), another study gathered self -reported symptoms from patients in the [LOCATION_006] and 
the US. Their study reported 65% of patients who tested positive for COVID -19 had loss 
of smell or taste, and for 16%, there was no associated fever or cough. Using data from 
over 70,000 patients, they concluded the predictive ability of OD for COVID -19 was 
higher than the predictive ability of either cough or fever, and that the median duration of 
anosmia was about 5 days.10  Preliminary results from the COVID -19 Anosmia Reporting 
tool developed by [CONTACT_234298] -Head and Neck Surgery  
suggests tha t, out of 237 initial entries,  27% reported OD as their initial symptom , and 
27% of patients had some improvement in OD with a mean of 7.2 days.1 A study  of 143 
patients in Italy assessed  persistent symptoms of COVID -19 after about 60 days since 
onset of a patient’s  first COVID -19 symptom . About 45% of patients presented with 
anosmia in the acute setting, and about 17% of patients continued to report anosmia [ADDRESS_1270699] beyond 90 days and 6 months in 15% a nd 5% of 
patients,  respectively .12  
 
Based on an estimate in which 25 % of new daily cases will experience anosmia  
(average of 111,[ADDRESS_1270700] 2022  in the US ), and 
that 5% will experience permanent  anosmia, we predict  that over 500,[ADDRESS_1270701] 2023 .4 This estimate does not take into account  those 
that already suffer from long-term OD currently .  
 
 
Anosmia and Dysgeusia in COVID -19. Current research studies report both anosmia 
(loss of smell) and dysgeusia (loss of taste) related to COVID -[ADDRESS_1270702] 
involvement of the gustatory system, but often  dysgeusia is related to impaired 
retronasal olfaction (flavor) rather than gustatory sensations (sweet, salty, sour, 
bitter).13,[ADDRESS_1270703] are key entry points 
for SARS -CoV-2;15-[ADDRESS_1270704] ACE2 receptor. ACE2 receptors are expressed 
throughout the nervous system, which may explain the virus’s neurological 
manifestations.2,[ADDRESS_1270705] viral damage to 
the olfactory complex as seen via nasal endoscopic dissection at autopsy.20 A case 
study using MRI in a 25 -year-old female with COVID -associated anosmia and dysgeusia 
demonstrated signal alteration , suggesting viral brain invasion into the posterior gyrus 
rectus, which is associated with olfaction. The resolution of the anosmia correlated with 
resolution in that signal alteration as well.21 Therefore, preliminary evidence exists for 
COVID -related anosmia affecting nasal epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663], the olfactory neural complex, 
and/or the cortex directly. The resolution of COVID -related anosmia in the majority of 
patients may be related to the unique neuroplasticity the olfactory system exhibits both 
centrally and peripherally .22-[ADDRESS_1270706] pathogenesis of the disease as well.  
 
 
Significance and Management of Olfactory Dysfunction. As of 2016 before COVID -
19, a bout 13 million or 1 in 8 Americans over the age of 40 suffer ed from a measurable 
smell dysfunction . In total, 3% of all Americans ha d anosmia or hyposmia, with post -viral 
olfactory dysfunction (PVOD) being the leading cause.[ADDRESS_1270707] ed up to 25% of persons over the age of 50, 
and evidence also suggests it may be associated with depression and contribute to the 
anorexia of aging.31-[ADDRESS_1270708], oral and 
intranasal corticosteroids were considered a possible treatment to target nasal mucosal 
inflammation ; however they are not currently recommended due to lack of clear benefit 
and a number of adverse effects.3,13 Moreover, systemic corticosteroids (particularly 
dexamethasone) are only recommended for acute COVID -[ADDRESS_1270709] shown potential benefit and negligible 
adverse effects in treating olfactory dysfunction ; however more research is needed  to 
ascertain their use.[ADDRESS_1270710] -viral OD, and has been outlined by [CONTACT_905267], et al. ( Figure 1 ).13 This approach, 
however, is continually evolving, and randomized control trials  (RCT)  on treatments for 
COVID -related anosmia are ongoing . One three -arm RCT for COVID -related anosmia 
treatments has been approved in which participants  are randomized to olfactory training, 
budesonide nasal irrigation, or training with smelling household items ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ).41 
Other trials  are testing  omega -3 fatty acids  vs placebo  ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ),42 mometasone 
nasal spray vs placebo ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED] )43 , and cerebrolycin injections 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).44

Use of Theophylline in OD  and COVID -related anosmia. Prior in vivo and in vitro 
studies have demonstrated the importance of secondary messengers cAMP and cGMP 
in both olfactory signaling and sensory axonal regeneration.45-[ADDRESS_1270711] adult 
axons.50 Moreover, cAMP and cGMP levels in nasal mucus were significantly lower in 
hyposmic participants  compared to normosmic controls,51 and a stepwise increase in 
olfactory dysfunction was associated with a stepwise decrease in nasal mucus cAMP 
and cGMP levels .52 The use of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, such as theophylline, that 
prevents the breakdown of intracellular cAMP and cGMP, therefore, has been theorized 
to improve olfaction.53,54 Moreover, two preliminary molecular docking studies showed 

   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 7 potential affinity of theophylline derivatives to inhibit two important SARS -CoV-2 
proteins, papain -like protease protein (PLpro) and 3-chymotrypsin -like protease 
(3CLpro) , offering promise as a treatment of COVID -19. Further in vivo and in vitro 
studies are needed to evaluate clinical utility.55,56  
 
Clinically, theophylline is an inexpensive drug with FDA approval for the treatment of 
both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).47 Theophylline is a 
methylxanthine that works by [CONTACT_905268] (bronchodilation) and 
suppression of tissue response to stimuli (anti -inflammatory).57 Oral theophylline for OD 
showed subjective improvement starting at 4 -6 weeks but with continuing improvement 
for 6-72 months of treatment (Henkin 2008) . While systemic theophylline has a narrow 
therapeutic index, the use of intranasal theophylline has recently been studied as a 
potential treatment for post -viral OD  at doses that do not  increase serum theophylline 
levels .58 A study on OD of various etiologies demonstrated improved  smell detection and 
recognition thresholds after 2 months of 20 ug intranasal theophylline spray (Henkin 
2022).  Two pi[INVESTIGATOR_905254] -viral OD refractory to multiple 
treatments reported statistically significant improvement in quantitative  subjective scores 
of smell.58,[ADDRESS_1270712] ed higher doses up to 400mg twice daily for safety  
and reported minor side effects in 2 out of 10 participants  at the maximum dose thus far. 
One patient reported pre -existing atrial fibrillation for all four weeks of the trial. 4 out of 
10 participants  also reported improvements in their sense of smell.   
 
A subsequent  trial tested a 6-week course of 400mg theophylline in saline irrigations 
twice daily compared to placebo (lactose in saline irrigation).60 Systemic absorption as 
measured by [CONTACT_905269] 1 week at this dose was negligible.  Of 45 
participants who completed the study, Eleven (50%) participants in the theophylline arm 
compared to 6 (26%) in the placebo arm had a clinically meaningful change on objective 
olfactory testing. 13 (59%) in the theophylline arm had subjective improvement compared 
to 10 (43%) in the placebo arm , for a difference in response rate of 15.6% (95% CI -13.2 
to 44.5%). This wide confidence interval precludes definit ive conclusions but the upper 
bound of 44.5% is much larger than the MCID of 25%, suggesting  that the observed 
effect of theophylline on both subjective and objective outcomes warrants  a larger t rial to 
investigate the efficacy of this treatment more fully.  
 
B2 Rationale for this Study  
COVID -related anosmia is a major symptom of infection with SARS -CoV-2, affecting up 
to 80% of those with COVID -19. While research on the pathogenesis  is ongoing , a 
significant subset is expected to suffer from permanent olfactory dysfunction. We seek to 
test intranasal theophylline nasal irrigation as a potential therapeutic option for treatment 
of COVID -related anosmia lasting over [ADDRESS_1270713] changes in the 
subjective ratings of smell via the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI). A secondary 
measure will be the Olfactory Dysfunction Outcomes Rating (ODOR) survey . 
C2 Rationale for the Selection of Outcome Measures  
In accordance with virtual research protocols, a ll measurement tests at baseline  and at 
the 12-week mark will be administered  via online HIPAA -compliant survey. The following 
outcome measures were chosen to evaluate our hypothesis.  
 
Primary Outcome:  
1. Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) - We will measure  the response rate 
defined as the number of participants  self-reporting minimal change or larger in 
the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) scale, d ivided by [CONTACT_905270].  The CGI has two components – the CGI -Severity and 
the CGI -Improvement. The CGI -Severity Scale from 1 -7 (1 is Normal, 7 is 
Complete loss of smell) will provide us with subjective data on the patient’s 
perceived severity of their dysfunction at baseline. The CGI -Improvement Scale 
from 1 -7 (1 is Very Much Improved, 7 is Very Muc h Worsened) will allow us to 
measure changes at [ADDRESS_1270714] -treatment at 8 weeks. Each rating is well 
defined to minimize variabi lity.61 Participants  reporting 3 as Minimally  Improved , 2 
as Much Improved, or 1 as Very Much Improved in the CGI -I will be deemed 
responders to treatment, and the number of responders to non -responders will 
be compared between the two arms.  
 
Secondary Outcomes:  
1. Olfactory Dysfunction Outcomes Rating (ODOR) – ODOR is a new disease -
specific questionnaire that assesses for physical, functional, and emotional 
limitations in participants  with olfactory dysfunction of any etiology.  Based on the 
recurring impairments for participants  with post -viral OD in eating/appetite, 
environmental safety, interpersonal relationships, hygiene, and mood, [ADDRESS_1270715] is 
expected to be validated in Spring 2021.  
2. COVID -19 related questions  – Questions will be asked about the length of time 
since COVID -19 infection, severity of symptoms, previously attempted treatments 
for olfactory dysfunction, and presence of parosmia/phantosmia. This survey will 
help us determine  whether the efficacy of theophylline therapy depends on any of 
those factors .

 9 D Investigational Agent  
D1 Preclinical Data  
Theophylline is a methylxanthine that works by [CONTACT_905268] 
(bronchodilation) and suppression of tissue response to stimuli (anti-inflammatory). It 
non-selectively inhibits phosphodiesterase  (PDE)  III and IV , thereby [CONTACT_905271].47 These secondary messengers then result in 
bronchodilation, smooth muscle relaxation, and decreased inflammation. It also prevents 
the translocation of nuclear factor -κB (NF -κB), a pro -inflammatory transcription factor, 
into the nucleus and thus decreases inflammation even further.[ADDRESS_1270716] high -affinity inhibition of three SARS -CoV-2 proteins. Theophylline 
derivatives in particular showed potential affinity for  inhibiting  papain -like protease 
protein (PLpro)  and 3-chymotrypsin -like protease (3CLpro ); however in vivo and in vitro 
studies are needed to evaluate future clinical use.55,56  
D2 Clinical Data to Date  
Clinically, theophylline is an inexpensive drug with FDA approval for  the treatment of 
both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  Clinical studies show 
conflicting data for its use in acute asthma exacerbations ; however in acute COPD 
exacerbations, theophylline may decrease dyspnea, air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_007], and the work of 
breathing.62 It may also improve contractility of diaphragmatic muscles, but it does not 
improve pulmonary function measurements.63,64 Theophylline may be efficacious in 
chronic asthma and exercise -induced bronchospasm, and is an alternative, but not 
preferred, treatment for mild persistent, moderate, and severe asthma.47 Theophylline 
improves respi[INVESTIGATOR_905255]2 -agonists and anticholinergics . It has been shown to 
reduce hematocrit and improve symptoms from chronic hypoxemia and allow for greater 
bronchodilation and reduced diaphragmatic fatigue.47,64 At serum concentrations 
approaching 17 mcg/mL, theophylline  has been shown to improve peak flow, trapped 
gas volumes, vital capacity, distances walked, and breathlessness and fatigue.65 Recent 
data suggests a goal serum concentration of 10 -15 mcg/mL to achieve clinical efficacy 
without side effects commonly seen at concentrations >20 mcg/mL.25,[ADDRESS_1270717] -dural punctural 
headache. It has been studied as prophylaxis for acute renal failure, seasonal allergic 
rhinitis, cerebral vasospasm, and more.25 
 
Oral theophylline has also been studied in a single -arm longitudinal trial for the treatment 
of hyposmia  in which 50% of patients (157/312) reported subjective improvement in 
smell and taste, and 11% of patients (34/312) even reported return of normal function of 
smell. Mean odor detection and recognition thresholds were also significantly 
improved.[ADDRESS_1270718] a relatively narrow therapeutic index.47 These 
effects may be related to phosphodiesterase III inhibition in particular. Common adverse 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 10 effects of theophylline known thus far include headache, nausea, vomiting, tremors, 
insomnia, lightheadedness, and restlessness. Serious adverse effects can include 
tachy arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, Stevens Johnson syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, 
and seizure.25,47  
 
It was hypothesized that topi[INVESTIGATOR_905256]. 
A pi[INVESTIGATOR_14737] 10 participants  who previously had submaximal responses or intolerance 
to oral theophylline were given intranasal theophylline for the treatment of hyposmia and 
hypogeusia. This study showed improved taste and smell acuity in 8 participants  after 4 
weeks of intranasal theophylline therapy , report ing a statistically significant mean 
increase of 28% in quantitative subjective scores for smell improvement in comparison 
with 14% for the oral theophylline group. Moreover, serum theophylline levels were 
undetectable in all participants .66 Four of 8 patients  with chronic anosmia and hyposmia 
who did not respond to prednisone had improvement of olfactory dysfunction in a pi[INVESTIGATOR_905257].59 
 
A trial of 39 patients with olfactory disorders of various etiologies demonstrated a 
statistically significant improvement in smell detection and identificatio n thresholds after 
2 months of 20 mc g intranasal theophylline spray (Henkin 2022).[ADDRESS_1270719] -viral OD. We believe d elivery via nasal irrigation 
improve s penetration into the middle meatus and olfactory cleft than the nasal spray .68 
Patients with chronic OD were randomized to 12mg twice daily theophylline nasal 
irrigation (n=12) or placebo saline nasal irrigation (n=10).  There was n o statistical or 
clinical significant difference in objective olfaction identification, but there was a greater 
improvement in QOD -NS in the theophylline group (median difference -10 points, 95% 
CI -15 to -4). Our group  hypothesized that the low effect of theophylline  on objective 
smell  may have been due to underdosing, therefore a dose escalation trial was  done to 
test the tolerance  of higher doses of intranasal theophylline  delivered via  nasal irrigation  
for hyposmia and hypogeusia.[ADDRESS_1270720] 
patient reported pre -existing atr ial fibrillation throughout the study.  
 
A subsequent trial  by [CONTACT_905272] a 6 -week course of 400mg theophylline in saline 
irrigations twice daily compared to placebo (lactose in saline irrigation).60 Ten patients 
who underwent serum testing after 1 week of intervention all had serum theophylline 
concentration  <5 ug/mL, reflecting n egligible systemic absorption. At week 3, the 
theophylline arm had 2 participants reporting insomnia and the placebo arm had 3 
participants reporting tachycardia. Two participants assigned to the theophylline arm 
reported parosmia and foul taste with the interventio n resulting in 1 withdrawal and 1 
with poor compliance (>30% of pi[INVESTIGATOR_905258] 6 weeks). Of 45 participants who 
completed the study, Eleven (50%) participants in the theophylline arm compared to 6 
(26%) in the placebo arm had a clinically meaningful change on objective olfactory 
testing. Thirteen (59%) in the theophylline arm had subjective improvement compared to 
10 (43%) in the placebo arm , with a difference in response rate of 15.6% (95% CI -13.2 
to 44.5%) . This wide confidence interval precludes definitive conclusions but the upper 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 11 bound of 44.5% is much larger than the MCID of 25%, suggesting that the observed 
effect of theophylline on both subjective and objective outcomes warrants a larger trial to 
investigate the efficacy of this treatment more fully.  
 
 
 
D3 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits  
 
Previous data suggest a serum concentration between 10 -15 mcg/mL will achieve the 
majority of the drug’s potential benefit while minimizing adverse effects  for asthma and 
COPD . Adverse effects significantly increase beyond a serum concentration of 20 
mcg/mL , and severe symptoms (seizures, ventricular arrhythmias, and death) has been 
shown to occur in chronic concentrations of 40 mcg/mL or an acute concentration above 
80 mcg/mL.25,47  
 
The dose of oral theophylline used in the treatment trial of hyposmia and hypogeusia 
ranged from 200 mg up to 800 mg a day divided into two equivalent doses (breakfast 
and lunch).53 Some patients only responded to theophylline in a dose -dependent 
manner , at a minimum of 600 to 800 mg , requiring further escalation of dosing and 
prolonged treatment duration . This escalation also meant ex posing patients  to further  
adverse events  associated with theophylline such as headaches. Mean serum levels for  
patients on 800  mg oral theophylline  daily was 11.2 +/ - 0.8 mg/dL .53  Our institution’s  
low-dose theophylline nasal irrigation trial used [ADDRESS_1270721] -infectious setting. Therefore, we propose an 800 mg daily intranasal 
dose with a treatment period of 12 weeks with the expectation of minimal side effects but 
greater treatment efficacy.

and available by [CONTACT_905277]. No coercion or 
undue influence will be exercised. Individuals will be informed that participation is 
voluntary and that they can withdraw at any time during the study with no consequences.  
 
Any modifications to the project resulting in consent form changes will be tracked by [CONTACT_58860]. In the event re -consent is required, the change is made to the econsent 
form in REDCap and the econsent process is conducted again with the participant as  
described.  
 
The following privacy protections will be enacted for all email communications involving 
PHI: 
1) emails will be encrypted according HIPAA Privacy Office standards by 
[INVESTIGATOR_3086] [secure] in subject line or  
2) PHI will not be included in the email or subject line, but will be sent as a 
password protected attachment. The password for the attachment will be 
provided to the subject separately (in a separate email, by [CONTACT_648], or by 
[CONTACT_31711])  
 
Retention of identifiable information on non -consented individuals will be kept for contact 
[CONTACT_905278].  
 
2.d Randomization Method and Blinding  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:[ADDRESS_1270725].  
2.e Risks and Benefits  
The potential benefit to the participant is improvement of their smell and taste using this 
novel therapy. The potential benefit to the society is the use of the results to initiate a 
large phase III study to definitively determine efficacy of intranasal t heophylline use for 
treatment of COVID -related olfactory dysfunction . If effective, intranasal theophylline 
would  become a mainstay treatment of this disease , which currently has no effective 
treatment.  The potential risk to the participant is an adverse e vent related to the use of 
intranasal theophylline. Common adverse effects of systemic theophylline known thus 
far include headache, nausea, vomiting, tremors, insomnia, lightheadedness, and 
restlessness. Serious adverse effects can include tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, 
Stevens Johnson syndrome, intracranial hemorrhage, and seizure. Intranasal 
theophylline has shown m inimal adverse effects.  
2.f Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
The consent process informs a volunteer about the study, indicates th at participation is 
voluntary , and that he/she has the right to stop at any time. Risks are enumerated in the 
informed consent form and described orally during the consent process.  Subjects will be 
allowed to end participation in  the study at any point should they desire. If a participant 
must be withdrawn due to a drug -related serious adverse event, the study drug will be 
stopped immediately. They will have an exit interview to ascertain any adverse effects 
and discuss the reason for the ending participation. The study team will follow them for 
safety reasons up to [ADDRESS_1270726] has ended participation for any reason, the only data that will be collected 
are the data from the exit interview and the data collected prior to withdrawal within the 
12-week time period. There will not be any other follow -up or data collected from these 
subjects.   
 
A participant can withdraw con sent for the study at any time. D ata collected up to this 
point  will not be used in the analysis, and further data will not be collected from these 
subjects.  
 
E3 Study Drug  
3.a Treatment Regimen   
Participants will dissolve the contents of the 400  mg theophylline capsules 
(experimental) or identical -appearing lactose capsules (control) into the sinus rinse bottle 
containing nasal saline.  All participants will receive an 8 -ounce sinus rinse bottle and a 
12-week supply of USP Grade Sodium Chloride & Sodium Bicarbonate Mixture (pH 
balanced, Isotonic & Preservative & Iodine Free) commercially prepared packets. 
Participants will either need to purchase distilled water or boil tap water for five minutes 
for use with the saline irrigation.  A member of the research team will instruct participants 
on how to irrigate each nasal cavity with one -half of the contents of the sinus rinse bottle. 
Written instructions and a video demonstration will also be provided to ensure proper 
technique. Because  the half -life of theophylline in healthy adults (16 -60 years) is 8.7 
   
   
______________________________________________________________________________________  
 16 hours and 9.8 h ours in the elderly (> 60 year), irrigations will be performed twice daily  – 
once in the morning and once at night for all subjects,71 for a total daily dose of 800mg 
theophylline nasal irrigation.  
 
3.b Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
After faxing a signed prescription, the compounding pharmacy will formulate and directly 
ship the study drug regimen to the participant’s  provided mailing address  via FedEx or 
via the [LOCATION_002] Postal Service if the patient only has a PO box . All packages in 
transit can be monitored via the tracking numbers.  
3.c Subject Compliance Monitoring  
Participants  will be evaluated at [ADDRESS_1270727] tried previous therapi[INVESTIGATOR_905261] 
(including over -the-counter treatments such as vitamin A or omega -3 fatty acids) will be 
eligible for the trial. Information will be gathered on their use of therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and if needed, 
a sensitivity or subgroup analysis may be considered.   
 
F Study Procedures  
 
F1 Screening for Eligibility  
 
Identified patients through chart review as well as interested individuals who reach out 
after seeing the approved study flier will be contact[CONTACT_905279]. Interested individuals will be asked to complete an 
online screening questionnaire to ensure he or she meets all of the inclusion criteria and 
none of the exclusion criteria. Potential participants will also be able to begin the online 
screening questionnaire in REDcap via a QR code provided on the study f lier, in which 
case they will receive contact [CONTACT_905280]. Following eligibility confirmation, an informed e -consent will be acquired.  
F2 Timeline  of Measurements  
Following the recruitment period, randomization of subjects will occur one week prior to 
the start of the trial. The timeline of measurements can be seen in Figure 3.

think you were randomized?” Choices will be “theophylline and nasal saline irrigation” or 
“nasal saline irrigation alone”.  
 
Participants will also be asked, “In the last [ADDRESS_1270729] you 
completed? (For example, if you did 2 rinses every day for 7 days, the total would be 
14).”

every 6 months.  All reports of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or an Unexpected 
Adverse Event (UAE) will be investigated by [CONTACT_905282] .  
 
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_905262], such as 
SAE or UAE, in real time  for the duration of the 12-week study . In addition, patients will 
be specifically asked about any  adverse events at the 3-week , 6-week, 9 -week, and 12 -
weeks via phone conversation . Participants  will also be able to get in touch with a 
member of the study team 24/[ADDRESS_1270731] -COVID OD , we set a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 
25% in the rate of patients with subjective improvement within the experimental group 
compared to the placebo group. We observed subjective improvement rates of  59% 
(13/22) in the theophylline arm and 43% (10 of 23) in the placebo arm, with a difference 
in response rate was 15.6% (95% CI -13.2 to 44.5%). The upper bound of 44.5% was 
much larger than the MCID of 25%, suggesting the potential for a clinically meaningful 
effect of theophylline despi[INVESTIGATOR_905263] .  
 
For a clinically definitive  study with a feasible sample size  of [ADDRESS_1270732] 29% such that  the 95% CI around this 
difference has a  lower bound of  at least 15% (upper bound 41%).   
 
Accounting for a 20% dropout rate, we plan to enroll [ADDRESS_1270733] 2022 numbers of new COVID -19 cases in 
Missouri (average of 1400 daily new cases) and Illinois (average of 4,300 daily new 
cases) with a conservative estimate of 10% rate of chronic olfactory d ysfunction. Using a 
20% drop -out and withdrawal rate, we estimate that the sample size of [ADDRESS_1270734] size of the primary outcome 
measure, and the 95% CI around that point estimate will measure precision. In e ach 
group, the frequency and relative frequency of the participants’ response to the global 
rating of smell change will be reported for each Likert category. Fisher’s exact test will be 
used for comparing the responders’ rates between the [ADDRESS_1270735] sizes 
with 95% CIs will be reported for each analysis. All statistical analyses will be conducted 
in SPSS 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY).  
 
G3 Missing Outcome Data  
Maximum efforts will be made to limit the number of missing values. Missing outcomes 
will be taken into consideration at the beginning of each analysis. Valid percent ages will 
be reported alongside overall percent for standard descriptive statistics, and data for 
participants  who do not complete the full [ADDRESS_1270736] to curb risks of breaches in confidentiality and privacy are 
1) formal training protocols centered on the maintenance of confidentiality for all study 
team members; 2) secure storage for identified data forms such as completed 
questionnaires and UPSIT exams; and 3) communication with study team via secure 
email, phone line, or televideo call.  
 
Only members of the study team will have access to the computer file and password for 
the master list. All research data files will be stored on secure Washington University 
servers with computer, network, and database -level passwords that will only be 
accessible to study team members. Accordingly, these mechanisms intend to limit 
access to information that can link clinical data to individual subjects. No subject 
identifying information will be revealed in any publications or presentations.

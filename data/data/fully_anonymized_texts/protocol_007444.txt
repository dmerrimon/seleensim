1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
1.1.1  Basic pathobiology, incidence and prevalence of sickle cell disease  
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a hereditary disorder of red blood cells that causes a wide variety of 
acute and chronic complications [1].  A single nucleotide mutation in the gene encoding the beta 
globin gene results in a single amino acid substitution in beta globin.  This seemingly tiny 
change in the hemog lobin protein results in sickle hemoglobin, which polymerizes, especially in 
the T conformation favored in deoxygenated sickle hemoglobin.  Sickle hemoglobin polymers 
induce remarkable rigidity and adhesiveness of the red cells that interferes with circula tion in the 
microvasculature, leading to tissue ischemia and infarction, pain and end organ dysfunction.   
Precise population figures are not available, but the Centers for Disease Control in the United 
States Federal Government estimates [2]: 
 SCD affects 90,000 to 100,000 Americans.  
 SCD occurs among about 1 out of every 500 Black or African -American births.  
 SCD occurs among about 1 out of every 36,000 Hispanic -American births.  
 
The World Health Organization estimates that 275,000 infants are born globally with SCD each 
year, 85% of those births in Africa, especially west Africa  [3].  The remainder of the SCD births 
are distributed mainly among the Unit ed States, South America, Caribbean and Saudi Arabia -
India regions . 
1.1.2 Nitric oxide dysfunction in sickle cell d isease  
Sickle erythrocytes are also prone to both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis. In recent 
years, work from our group and others has ch aracterized mechanisms by [CONTACT_719684], especially compromising bioavailability of nitric 
oxide (NO)  [4-11]. 
Nitric Oxide.   NO is arguably the most important endogenous regulator of vascular physiology.   
NO is produced in blood vessels by [CONTACT_719685] (eNOS), a tetrahydrobiopterin -
dependent enzyme that converts arginine into NO plus citrulline.  NO regulates an entire 
biological program that favors the flow of blood in the vasculature; its deficiency results in 
vasoconstriction and ac tivation of a pro -thrombotic, inflammatory state in blood vessels, 
especially arteries.  Vasculopathy due to decreased NO bioavailability predisposes to 
atherosclerosis in the general population, contributing to the risk of heart disease and stroke.  
Hemoly sis-Endothelial Dysfunction Syndrome.   The products of hemolysis found in blood 
plasma from patients with sickle cell disease contribute to a vasculopathy featuring decreased

  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  10 of 61 
 
 NO bioavailability [4-11] [12,13] .  In addition, highly active oxidase pathways produce oxygen 
radicals that can further deplete NO [12-14].  These products in co mbination decrease NO 
bioavailability:  
 
Component  Mechanistic Outcome  Citation  
 Cell-free plasma hemoglobin   NO scavenging and oxidant stress  [4] 
 Cell-free plasma arginase -1  L-arginine scavenging, decreased 
NO production and eNOS 
uncoupling   [5] 
 Asymmetric 
dimethylarginine (ADMA)   eNOS inhibition and uncoupling  [6-10] 
 Lactate dehydrogenase   Biomarker of associated plasma 
hemoglobin, arginase and ADMA  [6,8,15]  
 Reactive oxygen species 
from xanthine oxidase and 
NADPH oxidase   NO scavenging and formation of 
peroxynitrite  [12,14]  
 Decreased 
tetrahydrobiopterin   eNOS  uncoupling  [13,16]  
 
Each of these components serves as a biomarker of risk of pulmonary hypertension in patients 
with SCD.  The same pathobiology has also been implicated in  several other complications of 
SCD, including relative systemic hypertension [17,18] , proteinuria [19,20] , chronic k idney 
disease [21-24], stroke [25], leg ulceration [11,26] , and priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801] [27,28] .  Each of these 
complications is conceivably a consequence of vasculopathy in patients with SCD, much as they 
are in patients without SCD.  Each of these vasculopathic complications has been associated with 
clinical laboratory biomarkers of hemolysis, such as low total hemoglobin, high reticulocyte 
count, high serum lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin [29,30] .  This sickle cell vasculopathy has 
been associated with compromised response to exogenous NO donors in physiological assays of 
vasodilator function, indicating a state of NO resistance [4,31] .  Collectively, our group has 
termed this constellation of vasculopathic features the Hemolysis -Endothelial Dysfunction 
Syndrome (Figure 1)  [29].   
 
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  [ADDRESS_982194] ivity. Nitric oxide is produced by 
[CONTACT_719686] (NO) synthase, using the substrate L -arginine. Intravascular hemolysis 
simultaneously releases hemoglobin, arginase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from red cells into blood 
plasma. Cell -free pla sma hemoglobin stoichiometrically inactivates NO, generating methemoglobin and 
inert nitrate ( A). Plasma arginase consumes plasma L -arginine to ornithine, depleting its availability for 
NO production  by [CONTACT_541547]  (B). LDH also released fro m the red cell into blood serum 
serves as a surrogate marker for the magnitude of hemoglobin and arginase release. NO is also consumed 
by [CONTACT_719687] (O 2-) produced by [CONTACT_719688], producing oxygen radicals like peroxynitrite 
(ONOO-)(C). The resulting decreased NO bioactivity in sickle cell disease is associated with pulmonary 
hypertension, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], leg ulceration, and possibly with non -hemorrhagic stroke. A similar pathobiology 
is seen in other chronic intravascular hemolytic anemias [29]. 
 
The most dramatic complication of this syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, occurs in 
approximately 10% of adults with SCD [24,32,33] , and is associated with high risk of mortality 
[33,34] .  It is associated with three important risk -defining variables that will be considered 
eligibility criteria for this  trial:   
 Highly elevated echocardiographic tricuspid regurgitant velocity >2.9 m/s 
 Systolic hypertension  
 Proteinuria  
These have each been associated with poor prognosis in adults with SCD  [17,21,35] .  Each is 
hypothetically linked to the hemolysis -endothelial dysfunction syndrome and low NO 
bioavailability, making them attractive conditions to attempt therapeutic by[CONTACT_719689].  Furthermore, our own results indicate 
that sGC stimulator Bay 41 -8543 and sGC activator Bay 60 -2770 can by[CONTACT_719690] (Figure 2)  [36].

NO and cell adhesiveness in SCD.   A growing theme in SCD research is the role of cell 
adhesion, and this might be a potential therapeutic target of riociguat.  Under st eady state 
conditions in patients and mice with SCD, many adhesion molecules and their counter -ligands 
are expressed at high levels on endothelium, erythrocytes, leukocytes and platelets, and also in 
plasma [37,38] .  Increases in adhesiveness might be the precipi[INVESTIGATOR_719663]-occlusive pain cris is epi[INVESTIGATOR_719664] [39], and seve ral 
pharmaceutical trials are testing approaches to inhibit adhesiveness.  Prominent approaches 
under investigation are to inhibit the adhesion receptor P -selectin with small molecules 
(rivipansel or pentosan polysulfate sodium) [40,4 1], or with a monoclonal blocking antibody [42].  
Preclinical studies suggest that increasing cGMP via PDE9 inhibition decreases adhesiveness of 
sickle cell blood leukocytes [43].  All of these promising results suggest a potential additional 
mechanism of action of riociguat for patients with SCD.  
1.1.3 Previous clinical trials of N O pathw ay drugs in SCD  
Sodium nitrite.   Nitrite is a prodrug for NO production by [CONTACT_719692], 
myoglobin, xanthine oxidase and other hemoproteins, especially under low oxygen tension [44].  
In blood flow physiology studies conducted by [CONTACT_27156], sodium nitrite infused in the brachial 
artery induced dose -dependent vasodilation in healthy volunteers and adults with SCD [45,46] .  
However, no additional results of systemic sodium nitrite in SCD have been presented.

 Inhaled nitric oxide.   A small pi[INVESTIGATOR_719665] [47].  This was perhaps 
surprising, since NO has a half -life of less than a second, and would not persist in the circulation 
from the lung to the systemic circulation.  In fac t, we found no evidence of benefit in a 
randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled study involving 150 adolescents and adults with 
SCD hospi[INVESTIGATOR_719666] [48].   
 
Oral sildena fil.  This phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitor was already approved by [CONTACT_719693] (Viagra®) and pulmonary arterial hypertension 
(Revatio®).  Its mechanism of action involves inhibition of hydrolysis of cyclic GMP in tissues 
expressing its target PDE -5, mainly the penis and lung vasculature [49].  In a randomized 
controlled trial that enrolled adults and adolescents with SCD and elevated TRV and low 
exercise capacity, the Data Safety and Monitoring Board stopped the study prematurely due to an 
unexpected toxicity [50].  There was a 2.5 -fold higher rate of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_719667] (45% for sildenafil, 22% for placebo, P=0.022).  In this highly truncated study, 
there was no evidence of treatment benefit, although only a small minority of study patients 
completed the trial.  Issues concerning the increased pain e xperienced by [CONTACT_719694][INVESTIGATOR_719668].  
1.1.[ADDRESS_982196] [51].  At present, this remains the most coherent hypothesis 
for the increased pain observed in SCD patients on sildenafil, which also increases cGMP.  In 
further support of this idea, sildenafil also amplified neuropathic pain in a rat model [52], 
although this is a very complex pathway that is incompletely u nderstood [53,54] .   
 
The track record of the cGMP -elevating agent sildenafil in promoting pain in patients with SCD 
suggests that any future trial of cGMP -elevating therapy in SCD should monitor closely for any 
evidence of increased pain as an adverse event.   
 
1.2 Rationale of th e Study  
Riociguat has a dual mode of action: it sensitizes soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) to the body’s 
own nitric oxide (NO) and can also increase sGC activity in the absence of NO, causing 
vasorelaxation.  
Patients with sickle cell disease have a defect in sGC activation attributed to decreased NO 
bioavailability  [55].  NO deficiency is compounded by [CONTACT_719695]:   
 NO is scavenged by [CONTACT_79371] -free hemoglobin released from red blood cells as they lyse, 
and hemolysis is robust in sickle cell disea se [4].   
 NO scavenging by [CONTACT_719696]  [12,14] ;  
 Depletion of the NO synthase substrate, arginine, by [CONTACT_719697] , 
also released from red cells during hemolysis  [5,56] ; 
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  14 of 61 
 
  Inhibition of NO synthase by [CONTACT_719698], 
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) , and by [CONTACT_719699] -factor, 
tetrahydrobiopterin  [6-10] 
Reduced sGC activation results in defects in vasodilation and in excessive activation of 
endothelial, neutrophil and platelet adhesion.  These all combine to contribute to (a) vascular 
occlusion which produces pain and organ injury, and (b) proliferative arteriopathy manifest 
primarily as pulmonary arterial hypertension, which is life limiting.  Adults with sickle cell 
disease with high systolic blood pressure have a higher risk of pulmonary hypertension, chronic 
kidney dise ase, ischemic stroke and death  [17,18,57] . 
In a previous study of cGMP pathway manipulation in sickle cell disease using sildenafil, 
increased pain was a limiting adverse event, as discussed in the previous section  [50].  Back p ain 
is reported in the sildenafil package insert in 3 -4% of sildenafil users  (erectile dysfun ction) , and 
less frequently pain in the abdomen, chest, bo ne, eye or ear.  In pulmonary hypertension patients 
enrolled in the PATENT -[ADDRESS_982197] -1 studies, pain (especially chest pain, a known symptom 
of pulmonary hypertension patients) was reported more frequently even in the placebo users (5 -
9%), but was no hig her in the riociguat user (4 -7%).  These results suggest that riociguat  may not 
activate the same pain sensitization pathways that might be activated by  [CONTACT_719700].      
The proposed clinical trial will recruit adults with sickle cell disease with systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) ≥130 mmHg, and/or  macroalbuminuria as manifested by [CONTACT_719701] >300 mg/g, and/or  TRV > 2.9 m/sec  and/or urinalysis urine protein 1+ or higher, and/or serum 
amino -terminal pro -brain natriuretic peptide (NT -proB NP) as a cohort at high risk of sickle cell 
complications (See Table 1), and test safety and preliminary efficacy in reducing systemic blood 
pressure, albuminuria, TRV and NT -pro-BNP in an outpatient clinic setting.    
Rationale for adjustments to the initi al protocol criteria for inclusion and exclusion are discussed 
below:  
 
*         Expand clinical results of macroalbuminuria & TRV acceptable window from [ADDRESS_982198] these results identifying them as higher risk patients in their chart 
from more than 12 months ago, and loosening the time window is expected to add 
eligible subjects without the delays of updating their laboratory and echocardiography 
testing.  
 
*         Add inclusion criteria to accept clinical result of NT -proBNP level ≥ 160 pg/mL within 
the past 24 months.  
- NT-proBNP is a clinically available laboratory marker of cardiac ventricular stress.  It 
has been established in adults with SCD to correlate with elevated TRV (R=0.50, P.001).  
NT-proBNP level of 160 p g/mL or greater independently predicts increased risk of death 
(21 deaths at 31 months’ median follow -up; risk ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.1 -
12.5; P=.001; 19.5% absolute increase in risk of death).  These results from the NIH SCD 
cohort study we re confirmed in the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea.  Elevated NT -
proBNP correlated with hemodynamic measurements on pulmonary artery 
catheterization, and with functional capacity indicated by [CONTACT_719702] 6 -minute walk 
distance [Machado RF, Anthi A, Steinbe rg MH, Bonds D, Sachdev V, Kato GJ, Taveira -

 levels and risk of death in sickle cell disease. JAMA.  2006 Jul 19;296(3):310 -8. PubMed 
PMID: 16849664].   25% of adults with SCD have NT -proBNP level of 160 pg/mL or 
greater.  Although this population will overlap with other qualifying criteria in this 
protocol, in the frequent event of incomplete data in th e medical record, this criterion will 
present an additional opportunity to identify high risk SCD patients from existing 
information in the medical record.  
 
*         Add inclusion criteria to accept clinical result of urinalysis protein 1+ or higher withi n the 
past 24 months  
- Similar to macroalbuminuria, urinalysis protein 1+ or higher identifies an adult SCD 
subpopulation with early renal disease, associated with elevated TRV.  The presence of 
proteinuria correlated with lower GFR and had a high positive predictive value (0. 60) for 
elevated TRV in subjects with SCA (or HbS -beta-zero-thalassemia).  Proteinuria occurs 
in 20 –30% of patients with SCD, although higher incidences have also been reported 
[19,58,59] .  Again, although this population will overlap with other qualifying criteria in 
this protocol, in  the frequent event of incomplete data in the medical record, this criterion 
will present an additional opportunity to identify high risk SCD patients from existing 
information in the medical record.  
 
*         Exclude patients with PH -IIP to reflect the c urrent riociguat IB  
- Patients with pulmonary hypertension due to idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (PH -IIP), 
a more updated term for pulmonary fibrosis, did not benefit from riociguat in data in the 
riociguat investigator brochure.  Patients on this study  with SCD who have the unlikely 
co-morbidity of PH -IIP will be excluded event, consistent with current updated labeling 
information  [60]. 
 
*         Remove smoking from exclusion criteria  
- Smoking is not a contraindication in current riociguat labeli ng [60].  Tobacco smoking 
can increase riociguat elimination, thereby [CONTACT_719703], but is part of real 
world potential usage of riociguat.  Since opening of the study, 40 -50% of SCD patients 
meeting inclusion criteria are smokers.  The re moval of tobacco smoking exclusion may 
increase the eligible study pool by [CONTACT_719704], and add valuable safety and preliminary 
efficacy information on this large subpopulation.    
 
*         Revise exclusion criteria to use Child -Pugh classification to assess the severity of hepatic 
impairment. This also is in line with current riociguat package insert and IB.  
- The current modification proposes to align with the current labeling: “not recommended 
in patients with severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic impairment  [60].”  The current exclusion 
criterion of SCD patients with direct bilirubin level of 1.0 mg/dL or higher is excessively 
restrictive and will be eliminated in favor of the Child -Pugh C exclusion.  This will 
provide hepatic function standards consist ent with the current label.  
 
Study Procedures:  
 
*         Add INR as one of the liver function tests  
 - The INR is used to calculate the Child -Pugh class, as discussed above.

 1.3 Riociguat  
1.3.1 Mechanism of action  
Soluble g uanylate cyclase (sGC) is an important regulator in the cardiovascular system and is present 
in vas cular cells and platelets. The endogenous stimulus of the sGC is endothelial -cell-derived nitric 
oxide (NO), which acts in a paracrine fashion. In the underlying smooth muscle cells and in platelets 
NO activates the sGC, resulting in increased intracellula r cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 
concentrations (which induce vasorelaxation), inhibition of cell proliferation and migration as well as 
inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation  [55]. 
 
Riociguat is a direct stimulator of sGC in vitro and in vivo which is independent from NO, the 
endogenous activator of the enzyme. Moreover, in the presence of NO, it enhances the effects of NO.  
1.3.2 Preclinical  
The toxicological program included studies to investigate the systemic toxicity as well as 
exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects after single and repeated administration up to 26 weeks in rats 
and up to 52 weeks in dogs, reproductive toxicity studies, genotoxicity studies and carcinogenicity 
studies as well as studies addressing specific questions (phototoxic ity studies, toxicity of impurities, 
mechanistic investigation and studies in juvenile animals).  The toxicological program was designed 
to support the chronic use of riociguat in humans.  
 
The toxicological profile after repeated administration was charact erized by [CONTACT_719705].  In rats, the toxicological profile of riociguat was characterized by 
[CONTACT_719706], as well as by [CONTACT_719707].  The bone findings are considered to be related to the 
pharmacological mechanism  of action, as the NO -sGC-cGMP pathway is involved in bone 
metabolism.  As the findings were restricted to areas undergoing rapid turnover during bone growth, 
the find ings in fast growing animals are not considered relevant for the adult patient population.  
 
In experimental animals, riociguat treatment has revealed no impact on fertility and early embryonic 
development.   Riociguat was negative in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests and 
revealed no evidence for a genotoxic risk.  
 
In 2-year lifetime bioassays in rats and mice, no drug -related neoplasms were observed under 
riociguat treatment, and an absence of a carcinogenic risk for humans is deduced.  
 
In summary, single and repeat -dose toxicity studies in rats, mice and dogs, which fulfill the 
requirements for non -clinical safety evaluation, revealed no unexpected toxicity of riociguat.  
 
The non -clinical safety profile is characterized by [CONTACT_719708]. Studies on genotoxicity, juvenile toxicity and 
carcinogenicity did not yield any specific concern.  
 
Developmental toxicity revealed an increase of cardiac malforma tions in rats. This effect is seen to 
be due to a mechanism of action related to hemodynamic and potential anti -proliferative effect on the 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_719669]. In rats administered riociguat orally (1, 5, 25 mg/kg/day) throughout 
organogenesis, an increased rate of cardiac ventricular -septal defect was observed at the highest dose 
tested. The highest dose produced evidence of maternal toxicity (reduced body weight). Post -
implantation loss was statistically significantly increased from the mid -dose of 5 mg/kg/ day. Plasma

recommended human dose (MRHD) of 2.5 mg three times a day based on area under the time -
concentration curve (AUC). Plasma exposure at the highest dose is app roximately 3 times that in 
humans at the MRHD while exposure at the mid -dose is approximately 0.5 times that in humans at 
the MRHD. In rabbits given doses of 0.5, 1.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, an increase in spontaneous abortions 
was observed starting at the middle  dose of 1.5 mg/kg, and an increase in resorptions was observed at 
5 mg/kg/day. Plasma exposures at these doses were [ADDRESS_982211] teratogenic effects when administered to anim als; 
the drug is only available to females in the US through a restricted REMS (Risk Evaluation and 
Mitigation Strategies) program.  
1.3.3 Clinical experience s ummary  
Phase II studies in patients  with pulmonary hypertension demonstrated that sGC stimulation as 
exerted by [CONTACT_719709] 
≥1 mg in single -dose studies.  
 
 Riociguat administered at d oses of 1 to 2.5 mg tid over 12 weeks exerted significant, strong, 
and favorable effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and functional capacity in patients  with 
PAH or CETPH. This was supported by [CONTACT_719710], NT -proBNP, and WHO 
functional class asse ssment. These improvements were maintained over 4.5 years of follow -
up with continuous riociguat treatment.  
 Administration of riociguat at doses of 0.5 to 2.0 mg as a titration regimen for 16 weeks did 
not result in statistically significant improvements in mean pulmonary arterial pressure 
(PAPmean) as compared to placebo in patients  with symptomatic PH associated with left 
ventricular systolic dysfunction. However, treatment in the 2.0 mg target -dose arm (in 
comparison to placebo) resulted in consistent i mprovements in other hemodynamic 
parameters measured invasively and by [CONTACT_51541] (left ventricular ejection fraction) 
(phase II Study [ZIP_CODE] LEPHT).  
 
Phase III studies in patients  with PH demonstrated that  
 Administration of riociguat at doses of 1.0 -2.5 mg (titration regimen) for 16 weeks results in 
a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6MWD as compared to 
placebo in patients  with CTEPH or recurrent or persisting PH after surgi cal treatment .  
Between baseline and week 16 an improvement in 6MWD was seen in the riociguat 1.0 -2.5 
mg group (mean increase of 38.9 m) as compared to a small change in 6MWD in the placebo. 
The treatment comparison demonst rated a statistically significant  improvement in 6MWD for 
the riociguat 1.0 -2.5 mg group compared to the placebo group in the ITT analysis set 
(p<0. 0001 ) [56].  
 Administration of riociguat at doses of 1.0 -2.5 mg (titration regimen) for 12 weeks results in 
a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in 6MWD as compared to 
placebo in patients  with symptomatic PAH.  The improvement in 6MWD was s een in both 
riociguat treatment groups: mean increase of 29.6 m in the riociguat 1.0 -2.5 mg group and 
31.1 m in the riociguat 1.0 -1.5 mg group, as compared to a small change in 6MWD in the 
placebo group (mean –5.6 m, median 8.5 m) The treatment comparison demonst rated a 
statistically significant improvement in 6MWD for the riociguat 1.0 -2.5 mg group as 
compared to the placebo group in the ITT analysis set (p<0.001)  [57]. 
 Administration of riociguat with an individual dose titration regimen (1.0 -2.5 mg) to a  
background treatment of a stable dose of sildenafil 20 mg tid appeared to be generally safe.

 However, during the long -term extension phase, 8 of 17 patients  discontinued due to AEs (3 
deaths and 5 discontinuations due to AEs) during an average treatment p eriod of 
approximately 10 months. The limited information on efficacy from the small sample, both 
during the double -blind main phase and the open -label long -term extension, did not indicate a 
signal of efficacy and clinical benefit. Therefore, the overall benefit -risk balance for the 
combination is not positive and combined use of riociguat with sildenafil is contraindicated 
[58]. 
1.3.[ADDRESS_982212] exposure to riociguat in two, randomized, double blind, 
placebo -controlle d trials in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST -1) and 
treatment naive or pre -treated PAH patients (PATENT -1). The population (riociguat: n = 490; 
Placebo: n = 214) was between the age of 18 and 80 years  [59]. 
 
The safety profile of riociguat in patients with inoperable or recurrent/persistent CTEPH (CHEST 1) 
and treatment naive or pre -treated PAH (PATENT 1) were similar. Therefore, adverse drug reactions 
(ADRs) identified from the 12 and 16 week placebo -controlled trials for PAH a nd CTEPH

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 -weeks of treatment with 
riociguat versus placebo in high -risk patients with sickle cell disease, with additional evaluation

  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  [ADDRESS_982213] 1 treatment -emergent severe adverse event will be seen between study arms.  This reflects a 
superiority trial design, similar to other Phase 2 safety and tolerability studies.  
 
The proposed clinical trial will recruit adults with sickle cell disease with sy stolic blo od pressure 
(SBP) ≥130 mmHg, and/or macroalbuminuria as manifested by [CONTACT_719701] >300 mg/g, TRV > 2.9 m/sec , NT-proBNP level > 160 pg/mL, and/or  urinalysis protein 1+ or 
higher as a cohort at high risk of sickle cell complications.   The study will enroll 100  adults with 
sickle cell disease to  complete the protocol .  
2.2 Secondary Hypothesis  
Riociguat will yield a signal of improved outcome in adults with sickle cell disease, with 
potential improvements in systolic blood pr essure, albuminuria, echocardiography  TRV , serum 
NT-proBNP or six minute walk distance, known predictors of early mortality in adults with 
sickle cell disease.

4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.[ADDRESS_982218] treatment. Following completion of screening and baseline 
assessment, patients  who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion  criteria will be 
randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either placebo or riociguat at the starting dose of 1.0 mg 
TID (three times a day) for 12 weeks.  
 
The dose will be titrated every 2 weeks  (+/-3 days)  based on  monitoring of subject’s systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and well -being assessed at that visit (see Figure  3). 
 
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  23 of 61 
 
 PK/PD data will be collected on a subgroup  of approximately [ADDRESS_982219] blind, PK subjects will receive one dose of study medication ( 1 mg 
riocig uat/placebo) per their randomized assignment.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following the starting dose of 1.0 mg TID  (minimum dose interval  - approximately  6 hrs; 
maximum dose interval  - approximately  10 hr s), the subsequent dose modification will not exceed 
±0.5 mg TID increments in 2 -week intervals (+/- 3 days)  to 1.5 mg, 2.0 mg, and 2.5 mg TID, 
resulting in a maximal total daily dose of 7.5 mg. Patients will be maintained on lower doses if 
higher doses are not tolerated (minimum lowest possible dose is 0.5 mg TID, total daily dose 1.5 
mg). If the patient does n ot tolerate the lowest possible riociguat dose (0.5 mg TID), he/she must 
be withdrawn from the study.  
 
At each biweekly titration visit, peripheral SBP will be measured  and signs/symptoms of 
hypotension assessed.  T he individual patient  dose will be assign ed based on the following dose 
titration algorithm (see Figure 4 ).   Date/time of when the subject  took their last dose  of riociguat 
will be recorded.  
 SBP ≥ 95 mmHg and no signs or symptoms of hypotension, dosage should be increased by 
0.5 mg TID  
 SBP < 95 mmHg and no signs or symptoms of hypotension, dosage should be maintained  
 SBP < 95 mmHg, and any signs or symptoms of hypotension associated with dizziness, 
lightheadedness or syncope, the current dose should be decreased by 0.5 mg TID

At the end of the dose titration phase with the target goal of the maximal dose of 2.5 mg TID 
(total daily dose of 7.5 mg), no further increase in dose will be allowed. The established 
individual dose will then be taken as the “optimal dose” to be administered for the remainder of 
the 12 -week study period.  
 
To assu re blinding of the treatment arms, patients  allocated to the placebo group will undergo a 
sham titration from Baseline Visit onwards following the rules of the individual dose titration 
scheme.  
 
Safety monitoring including physical examinations, adverse ev ent assessment,  vital signs  to 
include sitting blood pressure  will be conducted at 2 week intervals during the double b linded 
study treatment. Safety lab assessment will be done at four week intervals during the treatment 
phase. Safety and tolerability, es pecially pain, will be assessed using several specific patient 
reported outcome instruments. Functional outcomes measuring the changes in Six Minute Walk 
Distance and Borg Dyspnea /Fatigue  Scale will be assess ed from baseline to Week 12.

 All randomized patients, regardless of whether they completed study treatment through Week 12 
or discontinued study treatment prior to Week 12, will be asked to return for a safety follow -up 
visit ( approximately  30 days after stop of study medication intak e). 
4.[ADDRESS_982221] that lasts longer than  14 days (42  consecutive  missed 
doses ), restart ing the study medication again  is not allowed  (respective patients must be withdrawn 
from the trial). Up to 14 days of missed doses, the patient can restart study drug at the original 
starting dose of 1.0 mg and follow the regular dose titration every two weeks as appropriate.  In 
case of interruptions  shorter than 3 days (9 doses) , it is at the discretion of the investigator if the 
study medication can be restarted  at the same dose or at 0.[ADDRESS_982222] at the site to allow pati ents to receive the study medication while hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], the 
protocol titration schedule should be followed .  
4.4 Randomization  
Patients will be randomly allocated to  the riociguat arm, or the Placebo arm using a  web 
randomization s ystem. The randomization will be done in a 1:1 ratio in accordance with a 
computer -generated random code provided by [CONTACT_36909]  (DCC)  at the 
Baseline visit . The randomization is planned as a block randomization according to study site 
and will occur at Baseline . Subjects will begin taking the study medication the morning after the 
Baseline visit.   
 
To obtain PK/PD data , approximately [ADDRESS_982223] sites  will participate in 
PK/PD testing in order to obtain at least 13 evaluable samples sets. PK/PD subjects will have a 
trough sample  drawn with their baseline labs . After Baseline assessments are completed, subjects 
will take one do se of riociguat 1 mg /placebo  by [CONTACT_1966]  (based on their randomization 
assignment)  followed by  [CONTACT_719712] [ADDRESS_982224] 
dose. Time s of dosing and sampling will be recorded.  The DCC  will work with the outside 
laboratory providing the PK/PD analysis  to confirm the presence of at least 13 evaluable 
samples . If data is found to be insufficient, PK/PD sampling may be re -opened  until 13 is 
reached.

Riociguat and placebo will be self-administered TID  (approximately 6 to 10 hours apart) , as 
film-coated tablets with or without food.  
Riociguat and placebo will be supplied as film -coated tablets packaged in high -density 
polyethylene bottles. All tablet fo rmulations will be identical in appearance (size, shape, color) 
and smell. The packaging and labeling will be designed to maintain blinding to the Investigator’s 
team and to patients.  
6.2 Treatment A ssignment  
A patient number (a unique identification number) w ill be assigned when a patient  is evaluated 
for inclusion into the study. Patients who complete all screening procedures and meet all 
eligibility criteria for the study will be allocated  using a web -based randomization system  in a 
1:1 ratio.  
6.2.1  Dosing and a dministration  
 
Riociguat  
Dosage:  0.5, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg (individual dose titration )

Dosage:  0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg (sham dose titration)  
Route of administration:  Oral 
Frequency of administration:  TID 
All s ubjects will begin taking study medication the AM after the Baseline visit. The starting 
dosage is 1.0 mg taken by [CONTACT_1966] 3 times a day with or without food. If systolic blood pressure 
remains greater than 9 5 mmHg and the patient has no signs or symptoms of hypotension, up -
titrate the dose by 0.5 mg taken three times a day. If systolic blood pressure remains less than 9 5 
mmHg and no signs or symptoms of hypotension, dosage should be maintained. Dose increases 
should be  2 weeks apart  (+/-3 days) . The dose can be increased to the highest tolerated dosage, 
up to a maximum of 2.5 mg taken three times a day. SBP < [ADDRESS_982230] two weeks  (+/- 3 days). The 
lowest dose permissible is 0.5 m g, and participants who cannot tolerate 0.5 mg should be 
withdrawn from the trial.

The study will be conducted as a double blind trial. In general, patients and investigators will 
remain blinded until study database lock and autho rization of data release.  
Unblinding by [CONTACT_719715], in the event of a S[LOCATION_003]Rs, the patient’s treatment 
code will usually be unblinded before reporting to the health authorities, ethic commi ttees and 
investigators (see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). 
Emergency  unblinding by [CONTACT_719716].  Investigators should note that the 
occurrence of a serious adverse event or progressive disease should not routinely precipi[INVESTIGATOR_104686].  The Investigator is required to prom ptly document and 
explain to the Sponsor any premature unblinding of the study drug within 24 hours of 
unblinding.  
6.3.1 Accountability  
Study drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with Good Clinical Practice 
(GCP) and Good Manufacturing  Practices (GMP) requirements , and will be inaccessible to 
unauthorized personnel.   
The investigator, or a responsible party designated by [CONTACT_093], must maintain a careful 
record of the inventory and disposition of the investigational drug product s. 
6.3.[ADDRESS_982231] udy 
drug intake will be assessed during data analysis.  
6.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
All medication that is considered necessary for the patient ’s welfare, and which is not expected 
to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator.

 All medications (including contrast media) taken within [ADDRESS_982232] be recorded in the in the eCRF (including start/stop dates, dose 
frequency, route of administration, and indication).  
6.5.1   Permitted m edications  
 Hydroxyurea: Hydroxyurea is  an FDA approved drug for the treatment of sickle cell 
disease.  There is no expected drug interaction or additive side effect between riociguat 
(mainly vasodilation) and hydroxyurea (principally myelosuppression).  We plan to allow 
enrollment of s ubjects already on a stable dose of hydroxyurea as well as subjects not 
taking hydroxyurea.  In this way, riociguat will be tested for its effect both independent 
of hydroxyurea and in combination with hydroxyurea.   To a limited extent, hydroxyurea 
can act as an NO donor, and the safety of its coadministration with riociguat w ill be an 
important safety determination of this study.  
 L-glutamine: L -glutamine was approved by [CONTACT_317260] 7, [ADDRESS_982233] between riociguat 
and L -glutamine . We plan  to allow enrollment of subjects already on a stable dose of L -
glutamine. It may also be used concurrently with or without hy droxyurea.   
 Crizanlizumab : Approved by [CONTACT_719717] 15, [ADDRESS_982234] between riociguat and c rizanlizumab . We plan to allow enrollment of subjects 
already on a stable dose of c rizanlizumab . It may also be used concurrently with or 
without hydroxyurea.   
 Voxel otor: Approved by [CONTACT_719717] 25, [ADDRESS_982235] between riociguat and 
voxelotor . We plan to allow enrollment of subjects already on a stable dose of v oxelotor . 
It may  also be used concurrently with or without hydroxyurea.   
 Clinically indicated and stably dosed FDA approved medications will be permissible 
except for PDE5 inhibitors , P450 (CYP) and P -glycoprotein 1(P -gp)/BCRP inhibitors , 
and oral nitrates.   
 Systemic vasodilators , endothelin receptor antagonists,  and prostacyclin derivatives will 
be permissible.  However, the dosage of  vasodilators , endothelin receptor antagonists,  and 
prostacyclin derivatives  need to be stable for at least three  month s prior to enrollm ent and 
preferably their dosage should remain stable throughout the 12 -week study treatment 
period.  
 Treatment with non -conventional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( e.g., herbs [with the exception of St. John’s 
Wort], acupuncture) and vitamin/mineral supplements is acceptable provided that, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], such treatment will not interfere with the trial endpoints.  
 Patients  may receive standard of care for any underlying illness.  
6.5.2   Restricted m edications  
Co-administration of riociguat with the following concomitant medications is NOT allowed:  
 Nitrates: Nitrates or NO donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form (e.g. , nitrates, 
molsidomine, sodium nitroprusside) because of hypotension  
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  32 of 61 
 
  PDE inhibitors: PDE -5-inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil) and 
nonspecific PDE inhibitors (such as dipyridamole or theophylline) because of 
hypotension  
 Arginine supplements

7.1.3    Early Discontinuation of Study Treatment and/or Early Withdrawal from Study  
 
If for whatever reason a subject was withdrawn from the study drug treatment prior to 
completing Week 12, the subject should be encouraged to rema in in the study and return to the 
clinic to complete end of treatment  assessments as indicated at Visit 8 within 3 days of 
discontinuing study drug if possible , as well as scheduled  telephone f ollow -up Visit 9 (one week 
post discontinuation of study drug) and Final Visit 10 ([ADDRESS_982240] discontinuation of study 
drug) in order to collect important safety information.  
 
If a subject cannot or is unwil ling to attend any clinic visit (s), at a minimum, the site staff  should 
make every effort to ma ke phone contact [CONTACT_719718]’ s health status including adverse events and concomitant medications  for the visit 8, [ADDRESS_982241] decides to completely withdraw  from the study (refuses any further study 
participation or contact), all efforts should be made to complete and report the observations prior 
to withdrawal.  
7.2 Safety Evaluation and Procedures  
7.2.1 Medical history  
Medical  history findings ( i.e. previous diagnoses, diseases or surgeries) meeting  all criteria listed 
below will be collected:  
 Indication  
 Start before signing of the informed consent  
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  36 of 61 
 
  Considered relevant to the study  
Detailed  instructions on the differentiation between (i)  medical history and (ii)  adverse events 
can be found in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] . 
7.2.2  Physical e xamination  
A ph ysical examination that includes a review of the following body systems will be performed 
at each clinic visit  beginning at Baseline : 
 General Appearance  
 Skin 
 Head, Ears, Eyes, Nose, Throat  
 Spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/Neck/Thyroid  
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_696]  
 Cardiovascular  
 Abdomen  
 Nervous Syste m  
 Musculoskeletal  
Any abnormalities or changes in intensity  from the baseline assessment  noted during the review 
of body systems should be documented and reported on the appropriate eCRF. If a new clinically 
significant finding (i .e., not noted at  baseline ) occurs at subsequent examination, an AE form 
must be completed. In addition, resolution of any abnormal findings during the study will be 
noted in the medical record and/or the eCRF if clinically significant.

10 minutes in a sitting position. Height and weight will be measured at  the Baseline Visit.  At 
Visit 8, weight measurement will be repeated.  
7.2.4 Pain a ssessments  
Brief Pain Inventory  
The Brief Pain Inventory will be used as a tool to measure the intensity of pain and interference 
of pain as well as to query the patient  about pain relief, pain quality, and patient ’s perception of 
the cause of pain during the study treatment at Baseline and Week 12.  
 
Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measurement Information System  
The Adult Sickle Cell Quality of Life Measure (ASCQ -Me) is an NIH -funded multicenter 
network that has enrolled over 500 patients  in developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a patient  reported outcome specific to 
sickle cell disease . The measure has been adapted to a version that can be administered by 
[CONTACT_22123]  [61,62] .  ASCQ -Me is the first disease -specific partner of the NIH Roadmap Patient -
Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) [63-65].  ASCQ -Me will be 
accompanied by [CONTACT_719719] -item Global Health form  from PROMIS.   These are not yet validated 
endpoints accepted  by [CONTACT_1622], but the FDA has encouraged more data to be developed with 
them  to potentially validate future use as endpoints for drug approval .

7.3.3 Six (6) Minute Walk Distance  (6MWD) Test 
The 6MWD Test must be performed at Baseline  and Week 12 .  Per the American Thoracic Society 
(ATS) Guideline , the 6MWD Test will be carried out indoors, along a long, flat, straight, enclosed 
corridor with hard surface that is seldom traveled. The walking course must be 30 m eters  in length , 
but not less than 25 meters . The length of the corridor and turnaround points should be marked. 
Patients  will be instructed to walk alone, not run, from one end to the other end of the walking 
course, at their own pace, while attempting to cover as much ground as possible in 6 min.   
7.3.4 The Borg Dyspnea/Fatigue Scale 
The Borg Scale will be measured in conjunction with the 6MWD Test  at Baseline and Week [ADDRESS_982247]. The severity is measured on a 10 point scale with 0  = nothing at all 
and 10  = maximum severity of breathlessness. The Borg Scale will be explained to the patients  
before starting the 6MWD Test. Patients  will be asked to rank th eir exertion at the end of the 
6MWD Test. The rate of exertion will be given according to the following scale ranging from 0 to 
10. 
7.3.5 Biomarkers  and Repository   
At Baseline and W eek 12, blood will be collected in specific tube s provided by [CONTACT_48876]. The details of tube type and sample processing will be provided in the lab manual for this 
protocol.

 NT-proBNP , a protein generated by [CONTACT_719723], is el evated in SCD patients suffering from 
congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension.  NT-proBNP will be evaluated at Baseline 
and Week 12.  NT-proBNP will be quantified in plasma. Samples will be drawn before intake of 
study drugs.  Further details on c ollection, labeling, storage , and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_719673] a separate laboratory  manual.   
 
Additional exploratory biomarkers  
The following additional exploratory plasma biomarkers known to play important roles in 
prognosis of sickle cell disease  will be quantified at Baseline and Week 12.  
 
- Biomarkers of oxidative stress: [ADDRESS_982248] dysregulation: asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), 
SDMA and cGMP.  
- Biomarkers of inflammation (C -reactive protein) and erythropoiesis (erythropoietin)  
 
Biospecimen Repository  
 
Any remaining blood will be stored indefinitely at the University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109] ’s Core 
Biospecimen R epository  for future research . Samples will be stored without identifiers.  
 
7.4 Pharmacokinetics / Pharmacodynamics Studies  
A small subgroup of patients will be used to obtain at least 13 evaluable sample sets for PK/PD 
of riociguat in SCD.  We will look at drug concentrations at two timepoints for each patient – 
approximately at Cmax and at expected time of trough.  Data analysis will be conducted using 
non-compartmental methods.   
 
Pharmacokinetics studies, coupled with the individual patient’s systolic blood pressure as the  
pharmacodynamic parameter , will be performed in a subset  of approximately  [ADDRESS_982249] 
sites. PK/PD subjects will be given one do se of riociguat /placebo (based on randomization 
assignment)  by [CONTACT_719724] . The plasma concentrations of riociguat will be 
determined using a sparse sampling approach. Blood samples of 4 mL each for PK analysis will 
be collected at two time points: (1) at trough (before a  study medication tablet is taken) and (2) at 
any time betw een [ADDRESS_982250] dose. Time of dose administration and sample 
collection will be recorded. Vital signs and blood pressure will be measured and monitored 
closely at each time points.  
 
Details on collection, labeling, storage , and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_174342] a separate 
laboratory manual .  Riociguat samples will be sent to the outside lab for PK/PD analysis. Should

 data be insufficient, PK/PD sampling may be re -opened in order to obtain the min imal samples 
sets required for adequate  data.  
7.5 Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_48908] α -Thalassemia and BCL11a  
Exploratory  genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_48908] α -Thalassemia and BCL11a is planned t o better understand the 
relationships between the pathophysiology  and specific genetic polymorphisms , and its 
association with fetal  hemoglobin levels and pain crises  in adults with SCD .  
 
A one-time 5 mL of blood sample will be obtained from each patient at Baseline . De-identified 
blood samples will be shipped to and stored at University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719674] r epository for analysis. Alpha globin gene sequence analysis will be performed to 
identify nondeletional point mutations. SNaPshot PCR, capi[INVESTIGATOR_719675] (SNPs) 
at the BCL11a gene known to influence HbF levels and associate with pain crisis rate in SCD 
patients.  
7.[ADDRESS_982251] (DSMB) will be created to review this study. 
The DSMB will comprise a panel of experts with relevant experience and will periodically 
review safety subject enrollment data and the supporting documentation. No ne of the DSMB 
members will be affiliated with this study or have a conflict of interest.  
 
In order to allow ongoing safety monitoring during the conduct of the study , DSMB will receive 
unblin ded safety data. If significant safety issues arise in between scheduled meetings, ad hoc 
meetings will be scheduled to review the data. The DSMB will also review the interim analysis 
after [ADDRESS_982252] been enrolled and received study drugs; however, enrollment will not be 
suspended pending DSMB review. Based on the safety implications of the data, the DSMB may 
recommend modification or termination of the study.  
7.6.[ADDRESS_982253] recruitment and retention as well as adverse events and unanticipated problems will be 
monitored locally at  each site as well as centrally by [CONTACT_36909].  In addition 
to DSMB meetings, the DCC will report adverse events on a monthly basis to the Steering 
Committee for this study .       
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  [ADDRESS_982254] one dose of study treatment will be valid for the safety analysis.  
All observations pertinent to the safety of the study treatment will be recorded and  included in 
the final report.  
All AEs whether considered drug -related or not, will be reported with a diagnosis, start/stop 
dates, action taken, whether treatment was discontinued, any corrective measures taken, 
outcome, and other possible causes.  For all events, the  relationship to treatment and the intensity 
of the event will be determined by [CONTACT_093].  
Safety variables may include but are not limited to the following: laboratory changes in vital 
signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temper ature) and, in some instances, 
changes in chest x -ray images, as produced at the investigator’s discretion  (e.g., for evaluation 
for pneumonia).  
7.6.3 Adverse events  
Patients  should be monitored for side effects of all concomitant medications regardless of the 
path of drug elimination.  Investigators should refer to the Safety Information se ction of the 
current IB for r iociguat, including the DCSI (development core safety information), for the 
expected side effects of r iociguat.  As with any agent, there is always  the potential for 
unexpected AEs, including hypersensitivity reactions.  The IB will be updated if any new 
relevant safety data are obtained.  
Therapeutic monitoring should be performed following dose selection of riociguat in a manner 
consistent with the local clinical standard of care.   
All concomitant medications  must be recorded .  
Patients  must be carefully monitored for AEs.  This monitoring also includes clinical laboratory 
tests.  Adverse events should be assessed in terms of their seriousness, intensity, and relationship 
to the study drug, AEs will be collected from the time of enrollme nt until the study visit at 30± 2 
days following discontinuation of the study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Definitions  
Definition of adverse event (AE)  
In a clinical study, an AE is any untoward medical occurrence ( i.e. any unfavorable and 
unintended sign [including abnormal labo ratory findings], symptom or disease) in a patient or 
clinical investigation patient  after providing written informed consent for participation in the 
study.  Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product.  
A surgical procedure that was planned prior to the start of the study by [CONTACT_719725] (however, the condition for which the surgery is 
required may be an AE  if the condition w orsens compared to baseline ). 
 Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which no symptoms or 
treatment are present until signing of informed consent  are recorded as medical history 
(e.g., seasonal allergy without acute complaints).  
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  44 of 61 
 
  Conditions  that started before signing of informed consent and for which symptoms or 
treatment are present after signing of informed consent, at unchanged intensity , are 
recorded as medical history  (e.g., allergic pollinosis) . 
 Conditions  that started or d eteriorated after signing of informed consent will be 
documented as adverse events . 
Definition of serious adverse event (SAE)  
An SAE  is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, meets any of the 
following criteria (a  – f): 
a. Results in death . 
b. Is life -threa tening. 
The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition refers to an event in which the patient was at 
risk of death at the time of the event, it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it wer e more severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081] . 
A hospi[INVESTIGATOR_719676]:  
- The admission results in a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8932] 12  hours . 
- The admission is pre -planned ( i.e., elective or scheduled surgery arranged prior to 
the start of the study) . 
- The admissi on is not associated with an AE  (e.g., social hospi[INVESTIGATOR_477672]).  
Howe ver, it should be noted that invasive treatment during any hospi[INVESTIGATOR_8955] ‘medically important’ and as such may be reportable as an SAE 
dependent on clinical judgment.  In addition, where local regulatory authorities 
specifica lly require a more stringent definition, the local regulation takes precedence.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability / incapacity . 
Disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life’s 
functions.  
e. Is a congenita l anomaly / birth defect . 
f. Is another  medically important serious event as judged by [CONTACT_093] . 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Classifications for adverse event assessment  
The following classifications will be  used:  
 Seriousness  
 Intensity  
As an alternative to the grading system described in the standard text below (mild, 
moderate, severe), other systems for intensity may be used (e.g. , CTCAE, Grade 1 to 
Grade 5).  If used, this needs to be stated and definitions of the grades should be 
provided. If applicable, a “translation” bet ween the CTCAE system and the standard 
system of intensity grading may have to be provided.

  Attribution  
 Study treatment action  
 Other specific treatment of AE  
 Outcome  
All AEs will be assessed and documented by [CONTACT_719726].  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_982255] be determined according to the criteria given in 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .

The severity of the AE is assessed by [CONTACT_499275] : 
Mild  
Moderate  
Severe  
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_982256] assign an attribution to the AE 
using the following attribution categories:  
 
RELATIONSHIP  ATTRIBUTION  DESCRIPTION  
Unrelated to inv estigational 
agent/intervention  Unrelated  The AE is clearly NOT related 
to the intervention  
Unlikely  The AE is doubtfully related to 
the intervention

  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  46 of 61 
 
  
Factors to be considered in assessing the relationship of the AE to study treatment include:  
- The temporal sequence from drug administration:  The event should occur after the drug is 
given.  The length of time from drug exposure to event should be evaluated in the clinical 
context of the event.  
- Recovery on drug discontinuation (de -challenge), recurrence on drug re -introduction (re -
challenge):  
- Patient’s response after de -challenge or patients response after re -challenge should be 
considered  in the view of the usual clinical course of the event in question.  
- Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases:   
Each event should be evaluated in the context of the natural history and course of the disease 
being treated and any other disease the pat ient may have.  
- Concomitant medication or treatment:  
The other drugs the patient is taking or the treatment the patient receives should be examined 
to determine whether any of them may be suspected to cause the event in question.  
- The pharmacology and pharm acokinetics of the study treatment:  
The pharmacokinetic properties (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) of the 
study treatment, coupled with the individual patient’s pharmacodynamics should be 
considered.  
[IP_ADDRESS].4  Action taken with study treatment  
Any action on study treatment to resolve the AE is to be documented using the categories listed 
below.  
The study treatment action should be recorded separately for each study treatment .

Pregnancy has been defined as an event of spe cial interest for riociguat; therefore t he investigator 
must report to the Coordinating Center any pregnancy occurring in a study patient , during the 
patient ’s participation in this study  or within one month of discontinuing riociguat. The report 
should be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se is not 
considered a n SAE.   
The outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up  whenever possible , and any abnormal 
outcome of the mother or the child should be reported.  In the event that study drug exposure 
occurs in a pregnancy via a male study participant, efforts should be made to obtain information 
on any abnormality of pregnancy course or outcome.  
8. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
8.1 Analysis S ets 
A randomized patient will be valid for safety  and efficacy  analys es regardless of whether study 
drug was ad ministered . Results will be analyzed according to intention -to-treat (ITT) .  
8.2 Variables /Endpoints  
8.2.1 Primary variables/ endpoints  
The primary endpoints measure:   The proportion of participants who experience at least 1 
treatment -emergent SAE, which is defined as those occurring after the baseline visit (i.e. after 
initiation of study drug), adjudicated by a designated committee of protocol investigators and 
outside experts.   This endpoint will monitor the safety and tolerability of riociguat in patients 
with si ckle cell disease . 
8.2.2 Secondary variables endpoints  
Secondary outcome s will include more detailed safety measure s that evaluate whether riociguat 
increases pain signals : 
 The frequency of SAE adjudicated by a designated committee of protocol investigators 
and outside experts to be due to sickle cell related painful crisis in the riociguat group 
compared to the placebo group , excluding study drug or disease independent SAE (e.g., 
accidents)  
 Overall incidences of treatment -emergent adverse events  
 Changes in pain intensity from baseline to Week 12 using numerical pain score and the 
Brief Pain Inventory  
Efficacy measures  will be among the secondary variables to evaluate signals related to the 
pulmonary and systemic vascular tone : 
 Changes in functional exercise capac ity by [CONTACT_58833] [ADDRESS_982258] from 
baseline to Week 12 (primary efficacy outcome)  
 Changes in hemodynamic parameters including blood pressure as the main 
pharmacodynamic variable, and tricuspid regurgitant velocity, echocardiography markers 
of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction after 12 weeks of double blinded treatment with 
riociguat  compared with placebo  
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  49 of 61 
 
  Changes in the levels of plasma NT -proBNP from baseline to Week 12  
 Changes in the Modified Borg Dyspnea /Fatigue Scale from base line to Week 12  
 Changes in laboratory measures from baseline to Week 12 (1) Renal: urine albumin to 
creati nine ratio, albuminuria stratified as microalbuminuria and macroa lbuminuria, 
estimated GFR, CKD stage based on albuminuria and GFR; (2) Hematologic:  
Hemoglobin, LDH, reticulocyte count, white blood cell count, fetal hemoglobin  
 Incidences of sickle cell disease -related clinical complications such as acute chest 
syndrome, priapi[INVESTIGATOR_8801], new leg ulcer, new stroke, other new non -CNS thromboembolic 
event during the 12 week study treatment . 
8.2.3 Exploratory variables/ endpoints  
Exploratory  endpoints : 
 Maximum and trough plasma concentration (C max and C trough ) 
 Changes from baseline to week 12 in biomarkers of oxidative stress: 3 -Nitro -tyrosine, 
Malondialdehyde and 8 -IsoPGF2a  
 Changes from baseline to week [ADDRESS_982259] dysregulation: 
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), SDMA and cGMP.  Changes in pain diary scores  
 Changes from baseline to week 12 in biomarkers of inflammation (C -reactive protein) 
and erythropoiesis (erythropoietin)  
 Changes from baseline to week 12 in electronic daily pain diary  
8.3 Statistical and Analytical P lans 
All primary and secondary outcomes will be described using sample means or proportions along 
with 9 0% confidence intervals  within  and between study arms .  Suitable transformations will be 
considered for continuous variables if  there are substantial departures from normality.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be compared between the study arms using two -
sample t -tests or chi -square tests, as appropriate.  Any covariates that are significantly associated 
with study a rm will be included as  relevant  covariates in the primary  safety and efficacy  analys es 
only if they are highly prognostic of the outcome measures.  All hypothesis testing will be 
conducted with two-tailed, 10% type I error.   
Attrition & Missing Data: We wi ll make every effort to minimize attrition and missing data in 
the study.  We will record reasons for drop -out and investigate any relationship with study arm.  
We will also compare baseline characteristics between participants who do and do not complete 
the study.  With regard to missing data, we will investigate the mechanism and degree of 
missingness using established techniques. [67]  If the amount of missingness is great, we will 
compare various imputation techniques to see how robust the overall inferences are.

  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  [ADDRESS_982261] dose of study medication up to 7 days after end of study treatment. The incidence of AEs 
during follow -up (i.e. AEs occurring more than 7 days after end of study medication) will be 
tabulated separately.  
 
Mortality during the 12 week study treatment period will be summarized descriptively. Any 
deaths in the study treatment period will be liste d, with day of death relative to start and stop  
of study drug and cause of death.  
 
The eligibility criteria of this clinical trial will enrich for a population of adults wit h sickle cell 
disease at high risk for death.  Observational studies indicate that for adult SCD patients  with 
elevated TRV, mortality can be as high as 40% at 45 month s [21].  This translates to a crude 
mortality rate of 0.[ADDRESS_982262] approximately  100 
patients each enrolled for approximately 3.5 months, or 350 patient -months  in aggregate.  Even 
with no treatment, we could anticipate up to 3 deaths for this cohort  while on study.  This 
baseline mortality rate will need to be considered by [CONTACT_719728].  SCD adults with systemic hypertension or proteinuria are similarly at risk for 
mortality [17,18] . 
 
Pain intensity  
A secondary safety measure will be  the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and numerical pain score  
measured at 12 weeks .  We will utilize an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for each outcome 
adjusting for the baseline measure  and including predictors for study arm and clinical site .  The 
utilization rate of acute care facilities will be compared between study arms using Poisson 
regression as a function of study arm and clinical site.      
 
Laboratory data  
The safety evaluation of laboratory data will include:  
 listings of laboratory data out of normal range  
 incidence rates of treatment -emergent laboratory values outside of normal range  by 
[CONTACT_1570]  
 incidence rates of pre -specified laboratory data abnormalities by [CONTACT_2948]  
 descriptive analysis of continuous laboratory parameters, and their changes from  baseli ne 
by [CONTACT_719729] (systol ic BP, diastolic BP, and heart rate) analysis will be summarized by [CONTACT_10663].  
8.3.2 Efficacy analysis  
6MWD  
The evaluation of  the primary efficacy outcome will be based on change from baseline in 
6MWD using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline 6MWD, treatment arm and 
clinical site as covariates . The main comparison in this analys is will be the difference in 6MWD  
  University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_719659]   
  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  [ADDRESS_982263] of the relevant beta coefficient at 
the 5% level of significance. Effect sizes and  90% confidence intervals of treatment difference 
will also be calculated.  The above approaches assume 6MWD will be approximately normally 
distributed. The residuals from the models will be tested for normal ity using the Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_2152] -Wilk 
test. Should this be significant at the 5% level, suitable transformations will be investigated (i.e. 
natural log) for the out come or comparisons on 6MWD will be made using the nonparametric 
Wilcoxon test .  
 
Other Efficacy measur es 
Changes from baseline to Week 12 will also be assessed between study arms on hemodynamic 
parameters, levels of plasma NT -proBNP, the Borg Dyspnea /Fatigue  Scale, laboratory measures, 
and Sickle Cell related complications.  Contin uous outcomes will be analyzed as above, using 
ANCOVA with the baseline outcome, study arm, and clinical site as covariates.  Logistic 
regression with similar covariates will be conducted for binary outcomes.  Finally, incidence of 
clinical complications wi ll be compared between study arms using Poisson regression .  
8.3.3 Exploratory  analys is 
The exploratory variables will be summarized using appropriate statistical methods: categorical 
variables by [CONTACT_116351]. T he 95% confidence 
intervals will be provided based on either, ANCOVA or stratified Wilcoxon test or Mantel -
Haenszel weights, stratified by [CONTACT_11338], depending on the nature and distribution of the data.  
 
Pharmacokinetic a nalysis  
Due to the limited number of plasma concentrations, PK parameters will be estimated by [CONTACT_6486] a 
compartmental model derived from richer datasets in healthy volunteers.  
PK parameters to be estimated will include:  
 
 
CL  concentration time curve (AUC)  
Total plasma clearance  
   
Vd  Volume of distribution   
  
 
PK parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics ( geomet ric means, standard 
deviations, coefficients of variation, sample size [N], minimum, maximum and median). Figures 
will be created to display mean and individu al (observed and model -predicted) analyte 
concentration -time curves.  
 
Additional analyses will be performed as deemed necessary upon review of the data.  
8.[ADDRESS_982264] (DSMB). Assuming an 
overall  two-sided,  type I error  of 10% , an O’Brien -Fleming  (O-F) spending function will be used 
to determine the sto ppi[INVESTIGATOR_719677].  If the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_24300]  (absolute

  7 January 2020        Version :6.1 Page:  [ADDRESS_982265] statistic > 2. 538) during the interim analysis,  follow up may be halted .  
Otherwise, the remaining 50 patients  will be recruited and followed.  Use of the O’Br ien-
Fleming spending function  allows the overall type I  error to remain  at 10% while still accounting 
for the interim peek at the data.    
8.[ADDRESS_982266] trial, mainly an unanticipated safety signal that showed an increased frequency of pain 
events in the sickle cell patients on sildenafil compared to the placebo group . This will be a 
group-sequential design, utilizing an O’Brien -Flemin g alpha -spending function with an overall  
potential  sample size of [ADDRESS_982267] 50 
patients . If an O -F stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_363016] 2.538  (alpha=0.0 11) is not exceeded , enrollment will 
continue for the remaining 5 0 patients . The primary analysis will be conducted with a n 8.9% 
type I error rate.   
 
We present detectable effect sizes for a group -sequential parallel arm design with 1:1 allocation 
ratio of 100 participants.  
 
For the primary safety outcome of  treatment -emergent SAEs , an absolute  difference of 24% 
(95% CI: 3.1%, 44.9%) was seen in the walk -PHASST trial, favoring the placebo arm  in a 
superiority trial design typi[INVESTIGATOR_719678] . With an overall sample 
size of [ADDRESS_982268] approximately 82 % power to 
detect  differences in the  safety outcome similar to that of the walk -PHASST trial . In fact , the 
study would have sufficient power ( at least 80%) to detect absolute differences a s small as 0. 23, 
assuming 22% of placebo participants experience at least 1 SAE.  If only 70% of randomized 
partic ipants complete the [ADDRESS_982269] 
reduces to approximately 68 %; however we would have at l east 80% to detect absolute 
differences as small as .28.  
  
We have performed additional power analyses based upon the results of the PATENT -[ADDRESS_982270] 80% power to detect changes of 42.6 m and 6.5 mmHg, respectively. These 
scenarios  assume  an overall type I error rate of 10 %. 
 
We will  have approximately  [ADDRESS_982271] 
93% and >  99% power to detect within -arm changes of [ADDRESS_982272] data on the paper CRF  for later data entry into the web -based system.

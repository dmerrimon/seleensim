1.1 Protocol Amendment:  Summary of Changes
Previous Protocol Versions
Protocol Date
Original 15 September 2016
The purpose of this amendment is to:
●Update Section 3.0, Introduction, GLE and PIB
Rationale:   Updated per the [COMPANY_013] Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187763]-Dose 
Combination Investigator's Brochure Edition 2.  06 September 2016; including 
Addendum 1 Edition 2 November 2016.
●Update Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Prohibited Therapy, Table 1 , Prohibited Medications 
and Supplements
Rationale:   To allow the investigator to reintroduce the medications 
prohibited by [CONTACT_760] [ADDRESS_221546] dose of study 
drug instead of 30 days or more, based on the half-lives of G/P
●Update Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Study Procedures, Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
Screening:  Liver Ultrasound, Appendix C , Study Activities – Treatment 
Period, and Appendix D , Study Activities – Post Treatment (PT) Period
Rationale:    To remove Alpha Fetoprotein from the protocol, because the 
protocol-required HCC screening incorporates the more sensitive and specific imaging exams (ultrasound, MRI, PET scan) and determination of Alpha Fetoprotein levels is not necessary.  The HCC Screening Liver Ultrasound at 
Post-Treatment Week [ADDRESS_221547] did not develop 
HCC during the course of the trial.
●Update Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Collection of Samples for Analysis
Rationale:   To correct the blood volume drawn for Pharmacokinetic Samples 
●Update Section 7.0, Protocol Deviations, alternative contact
[CONTACT_104504]:   To reflect current study personnel.
●Updated Section [IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoints
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221548] 2016-003192-22
3
Rationale:   Regulatory authority feedback requested that for high SVR 12rates 
less than 100% the Wilson score test be used for calculating the 95% 
confidence interval in the primary efficacy analysis, rather than using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.  To comply with this 
feedback, the Wilson score method will be used to calculate the confidence 
intervals for the primary efficacy endpoints if the number of SVR
12non-
responders is less than 5, otherwise normal approximation to the binomial 
distribution will be used.
●Appendix B , List of Protocol Signatories 
Rationale:   To reflect current study personnel.
●Correct minor typographical and grammatical errors throughout the protocol

Protocol Title:   A Multicenter, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Glecaprevir 
(GLE)/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (PIB) in Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Genotype 5 or 6 Infection
Objectives:
!The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by [CONTACT_187796] 12) and safety of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187766] C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The efficacy of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187767] (or cirrhosis status) and the safety of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187768] (or cirrhosis status) across genotypes.
!The secondary objectives are to assess efficacy of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187769] C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection across treatment duration (or cirrhosis status) by [CONTACT_187797]-treatment virologic failure and HCV virologic relapse across treatment durations (or cirrhosis status).
Additional objectives are to assess pharmacokinetics and emergence and persistence of viral variants in these treatment regimens.
Investigators:   Multicenter
Study Sites:   Approximately 26
Study Population:   Chronic HCV GT5 or 6-infected male and female adults aged 18 years or older, 
without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve (i.e., has never received a single dose of any approved or investigational anti-HCV medication) or treatment experienced (i.e., has failed prior interferon [IFN] or pegylated interferon [pegIFN] with or without ribavirin [RBV], or sofosbuvir [SOF] plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy).
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 80 subjects
Methodology:
This is a Phase 3b, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187770] 8- or 12-week treatment duration in adults with chronic HCV GT5 or 6 infection, with or without compensated cirrhosis, who are either HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced with IFN or pegIFN with or without RBV (defined as P/R treatment-experienced) or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN (defined as SOF plus RBV treatment-experienced).  Approximately 80 subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be enrolled globally.  Approximately 30 GT5-infected subjects and approximately 50 GT6-infected subjects will be enrolled in the study.  The study enrollment will be monitored to meet the following enrollment criteria: 1) a minimum of 15 GT5 and 30 GT6 subjects and 2) up to approximately 16 subjects with compensated cirrhosis (regardless of GT).
Approximately 80 eligible subjects will be enrolled into one of the following treatment arms:

Investigational Products: Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 100 mg/40 mg Film-coated tablet
Doses: Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] 300 mg/120 mg QD (3 tablets)
Mode of Administration: Oral with food.
Duration of Treatment:   Subjects without cirrhosis will receive glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187771] 8 weeks, 
while subjects with compensated cirrhosis will receive glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187771] 12 weeks.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Plasma HCV RNA (IU/mL) will be assessed at each Treatment and Post-Treatment Visit.
Safety:Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], physical examinations, clinical 
laboratory tests, and vital signs.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs):
The Short Form 36 Version 2 Health Status Survey (SF-36v2) will be used to assess the functional 
health and well-being of subjects.  The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire:  
Hepatitis C (WPAI:  Hepatitis C) will assess work and activity impairment due to HCV.
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187772].
Resistance:The following information will be tabulated and summarized:  1) for all subjects with available samples, 
the variants at baseline at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference sequences; and 2) for subjects who do not achieve SVR
12, post-baseline variants 
relative to baselines in available samples.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
[ADDRESS_221558] actual dose of study drug) within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) 
separately across treatment arms.  The primary endpoint will be analyzed based on intention to treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized with a 
two-sided 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation of the binomial distribution unless the rate for SVR
12is 100%, where the Wilson's score method will be used to calculate the 
confidence interval.
The secondary efficacy endpoints within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) separately, across 
treatment arms are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure.
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse.
For on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment relapse, the number and percentage of subjects will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method.  Analyses of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy subgroup analyses will be performed.

Statistical Methods (Continued):
PROs:
Change from baseline to each applicable visit in the patient reported outcome summary measures will be 
summarized.
Safety:
Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_187798] (i.e., cirrhosis status/study drug duration) and 
overall.  All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.  Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and preferred term.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be provided by [CONTACT_187799].  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by [CONTACT_2939] (i.e., cirrhosis status/study drug duration) and overall.  Changes from baseline to post-baseline in the CTCAE grading of laboratory values will also be summarized.
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of glecaprevir and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187773].  Summary statistics will be computed for each treatment arm.  Population pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing.  Pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect modeling approach.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drug, the variants at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions 
at baseline identified by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drug who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
variants in available post-baseline samples identified by [CONTACT_187800], 2) the amino acid variants in available post baseline samples at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated positions identified by [CONTACT_077], and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence, and 3) the persistence of viral resistance by [CONTACT_077].

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection is a global health problem, with over 
184 million indi viduals infected worldwide.1  There are 7 identified HCV genotypes, with 
genotype 1 (GT1) being the most prevalent worldwide.  HCV genotypes 2 (GT2) and 3 (GT3) infections are more common in Latin America (5% to 30%), Europe (20% to 40%) and Asia (30% to 45%).
2-[ADDRESS_221579] Asia.5  Depending on various risk factors, between 10% and 
40% of all patients with chronic HCV infection will develop cirrhosis.6
Death related to the complications of cirrhosis may occur at an incidence of approximately 4% per year; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs in this population at an estimated incidence of 1% to 5% per year.
[ADDRESS_221580] a 33% probability of  death during the first year.6  Successful treatment of 
HCV has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
7,8
Prior to the approval of sofosbuvir (SOF) in 2014, the recommended treatment for GT5 and GT6 HCV infection was pegINF/RBV for 48 weeks.  The inclusion of SOF to pegIFN/RBV shortened the treatment to 12 weeks, and this was supported by a Phase 3 open-label study where a total of 7 treatment- naive GT5 (n = 1) and  GT6 (n = 6) subjects 
were treated with pegINF/RBV plus SOF regimen for 12 weeks where all subjects achieved SVR
12(100%).9
[COMPANY_013] is currently developi[INVESTIGATOR_187776] "next generation" DAA drugs, glecaprevir (GLE), an HCV non-structural (NS) protein 3/4A protease inhibitor (PI) and pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (PIB), an NS5A inhibitor, for use in combination for the treatment of chronic HCV infection.  The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLE/PIB used together for the treatment of those with chronic HCV GT5 or 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.

GLE is an NS3/4A PI [INVESTIGATOR_187777].  Its EC 50values against 
HCV replicon stable cell lines with GT1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 4a and 6a NS3 are 0.85, 0.94, 2.7, 
1.6, 2.8 and 0.86 nM, respectively.  GLE EC 50data for a stable replicon cell line 
containing NS3 from GT5a is not available, but in a transient transfection assay using a replicon containing NS3 from GT5a, GLE demonstrated an EC
50of ~0.[ADDRESS_221582] generation PIs.

Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (PIB)
PIB is an NS5A inhibitor with potent and pangenotypic activity.  The in vitro antiviral 
activity of PIB ag ainst HCV GT1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3a, 4a, 5a and 6a is similar, with EC [ADDRESS_221583] generation NS5A inhibitors (ombitasvir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir) against key resistance-associated variants.

cirrhotic HCV-infected GT-1 – 6 subjects treated with 8 weeks of GLE/PIB in Phase 2 
studies.  Among cirrhotic GT1 treatment-naïve or pegIFN + RBV-experienced treated 
with GLE/PIB for 12 weeks, efficacy was high (> 95%).  However, longer than 12 weeks treatment may be beneficial to im prove efficacy among non-cirrhotic GT3 pegIFN + 
RBV-experienced as efficacy rate was < 95%.  Most frequently reported AEs in Phase 2 studies were mild to moderate and clinically ma nageable.  Overall, GLE and PIB regimen 
has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in Phase 1 and 2 studies.
Additive or synergistic in vitro anti-HCV activity has been demonstrated with the 
combination of GLE and PIB. 
EC
50s of PIB for GTs 1 – 6 are similar; EC 50s of GLE for GTs 1 – 6 are similar.  GLE and 
PIB exposure are similar and increased, respectively, when administered together.  
Therefore, GLE and PIB are expected to demonstrate efficacy in subjects infected with these less prevalent genotypes (GT5 and 6).
When GLE was given in combination with PI B in healthy volunteers, results showed that 
GLE exposures were not significantly changed when co-administered with PIB ( ≤ 31% 
difference); however, the exposure of PIB increased in a GLE-dose-dependent manner 
(from 1.5-fold at 100 mg GLE up to 3- to 4-fold at 400 mg GLE).
Results of clinical DDI studies conducted to date have shown that as perpetrators of DDIs, GLE/PIB combination had no clinically meaningful impact on drugs that are substrates of CYP or UGT enzymes.  The GLE/PIB combination increased exposure of substrates for P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 transporters.  Except for some OATP inhibitors (e.g., high dose cyclosporine), ritonavir-boosted  protease inhibitors and P-gp inducers, 
GLE and PIB exposures were minimally affected by [CONTACT_187801].
Phase 2 Studies (Studies M14-867 and M14-868) assessed efficacy, safety, and 
pharmacokinetics of the combination of GLE and PIB in HCV GT1 (Study M14-867 Part 1) or GT2- or 3-infected (Study M14-868 Part 1) in treatment-naïve (TN) and PR-experienced non-cirrhotic sub jects, respectively, GT4 – 6 (Study M14-867 Part 2) or

GT2- or 3-infected (Study M14-868 Parts 1 and 2) treatment-naïve and PR-experienced 
subjects with and without cirrhosis.
In Part 1 of Study M14-867, 100% (40/40) of GT 1-infected subjects without cirrhosis 
treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks and 97.4% (38/39) of 
subjects treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB [ADDRESS_221587] in the GLE 200 mg QD + PIB [ADDRESS_221588]-Treatment Week 4.  In Part 2 of Study M14-867, 97% (33/34) of GT1-infected subjects without cirrhosis treated with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8 weeks achieved SVR
12(one subject discontinued due to metastatic cancer with HCV 
RNA undetectable at last visit).
In Part 1 of Study M14-868, a total of 195 subjects were enrolled and evenly distributed 
within the GT2 and GT3-infected groups.  Two subjects discontinued due to Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Subjects 5904 and 9309 in Arm F), one subject discontinued due to virologic failure (Subject 9106 in Arm F), two subjects were lost to follow-up (Subjects [ADDRESS_221589] 2403 in Arm G), and one subject withdrew consent (Subject 4613 in Arm A).  Two of these subjects (Subjects 5904 and 9309; both Arm F) achieved SVR
12.
The SVR 12rates for each of the treatment regimens were 96% (24/25) (including a subject 
who was lost to follow-up) of subjects treated with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks, 100% (24/24) of subjects treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks and 100% (25/25) of subjects treated with GLE 200 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD + RBV for 12 weeks, and 98.1% (53/54) of subjects treated with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8 weeks.
In Part 1 of Study M14-868, 30 subjects with HCV GT3 infecti on non ci rrhotic, treatment 
naïve and PR-experienced were treated with GLE 300 mg and PIB 120 mg without 
ribavirin for 12 weeks and 93.3% (28/30 subjects) achieved SVR
12.  One subject in this 
arm experienced relapse at Post-Treatment Week [ADDRESS_221590] had missing SVR 12
data.

In Part 2 of Study M14-867, 100% of subjects infected with HCV GT4, GT5 or GT6 non-
cirrhotic, treatment-naïve and PR-experienced receiving treatment with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks achieved SVR
12(34/34).  GT1-infected treatment-naïve 
and PR-experienced subjects with compensated cirrhosis were also evaluated with the same.  Among the GT1 cirrhotic subjects, 96% (26/27) have achieved SVR
12, with 
one subject experiencing relapse at Post-Treatment Week 4.
In Study M14-868 Part 2, among 29 treatment-naïve non-ci rrhotic s ubjects with GT3 
infection treated for 8 weeks with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB [ADDRESS_221592]-treatment relapse.  One of the 
29 subjects had missing SVR 12data.  Among 24 treatment-naïve cirrhotic subjects with 
GT3 infection treated for 12 weeks with GLE 300 mg QD + PIB [ADDRESS_221593]-treatment relapse. 
To date, safety data across all arms in Part 1 of Studies M14-867 and M14-868 encompassing 276 subjects treated with GLE at doses 200 and 300 mg and PIB at doses 40 and 120 mg (with and without RBV in Study M14-868) for [ADDRESS_221594] frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea, and headache (occurring in > 5% of subjects).  Most of them were Grade [ADDRESS_221595] been 4 (1.5%) treatment-emergent SAEs reported in 
Studies M14-867 and M14-868 combined (all assessed as not related to GLE or PIB):  metastatic prostate cancer, pneumonia, atrial fibrillation, and B-cell lymphoma and 
one SAE that was not treatment-emergent (spontaneous abortion – also assessed as not related).  Two subjects (0.7%; 2/276) had treatment-emergent adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation.  Both were GT3-infected subjects in the GLE/PIB [200 mg/120 mg] QD + RBV for [ADDRESS_221596] normalized during treatment and there were no on-

treatment ALT elevations above baseline; s ubject had total bilirubin elevations that were 
primarily indirect.  The abdominal pain for this subject resolved after discontinuation 
from study drug.  The other subject discontinued for the aforementioned Grade 4 SAE of B-cell lymphoma for the purposes of initiating chemotherapy.
In both Studies M14-867 and M14-868, in all subjects with baseline alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) elevations, the ALT levels showed a trend toward normal or became normal with DAA treatment.  There have been no on-treatment ALT elevations above baseline.  The ALT normalization pattern was similar across all arms (i.e., all GLE and PIB dose levels) in both studies.  Other laboratory abnormalities were infrequent and primarily associated with the well-described hemolytic effect of RBV, manifesting as Grade [ADDRESS_221598] 
fraction, were mostly isolated occurrences, and normalized or stabilized with continued DAA therapy.  Total bilirubin elevations were primarily observed in the RBV-containing arms.
The safety of the combination regimen of GLE and PIB in subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis is investigated in Study M14-867 Part 2 (GLE/PIB [200 mg/120 mg] QD for 12 weeks) and Study M14-868 Part 2 (GLE/PIB [300 mg/120 mg] QD for [ADDRESS_221599] been no treatment discontinuations.
A detailed discussion of the preclinical pharm acology and toxicology, in vitro virology 
and metabolism, and clinical d ata for GLE, PIB, and the combination of GLE and PIB can

3.1 Differences Statement
The current Study, M16-126, is a Phase 3b study in which the efficacy and safety of co-
formulated GLE/PIB will be evaluated in  treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced 
(i.e., has failed prior IFN or pegIFN with RBV, or SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN therapy), chronic HCV GT5 or 6 infected adu lts without cirrhosis or with compensated 
cirrhosis for 8 or 12 weeks, respectively.  The ongoing Studies M14-868 (Part 4) and M13-583 are assessing the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of GLE/PIB for 8 or 12 weeks in mono-infected HCV GT4 – 6 subjects without cirrhosis.  The ongoing Phase 3 Study M14-172 is assessing the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of GLE/PIB in mono-infected HCV GT1, 2, 4 – 6 subjects with compensated cirrhosis for 12 weeks of treatment.
The current study, Study M16-126, evaluates GT5 and GT6 subjects in a wider 
geographic region compared with prior studies .  Importantly, this study will generate 
additional efficacy and safety data following 8 weeks of treatment with GLE/PIB.
3.2 Benefits and Risks
Benefits of treatment with GLE/PIB include:  potent and pangenotypic antiviral activity 
in vitro, higher genetic barrier to devel opment of drug resistance across genotypes 
compared to first generation protease an d NS5A inhibitors, no need for RBV, 8 or 
12 weeks of treatment, and the convenience of a once daily regimen.
Adverse events that are known, and those not previously described, may occur with 
GLE/PIB as detailed in the informed consent of this study.  In addition, subjects may experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  
Additional safety data for each DAA alone and the combination of PIB/GLE are detailed in Section 3.0and in the Investigator's Brochure.
10
Risks associated with PIB/GLE, including the risks of toxicity, virologic failure, and development of resistant mutations (Section 5.3.4 ), appear to be limited and manageable 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221601] 2016-003192-22
24
based upon the available data.  Given the potential for SVR in this population of HCV 
GT5 or 6 infected subjects, the risk-benefit assessment is favorable.
4.0 Study Objective
4.1 Primary Objectives
The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy (by [CONTACT_187802]
12) and safety of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187778] C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 5 or 6 infection with or without compensated cirrhosis.  The efficacy of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187767] (or cirrhosis status) and the safety of glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187779] (or cirrhos is status) across

The study was designed to enroll approximately 80 subjects to meet scientific and 
regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the target number of subjects has been enrolled, there is a possibility that additional subjects in screening will not be enrolled.
5.1.1 Screening
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study-specific procedures will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system .  The investigator will evaluate whether 
the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_221606]'s medical records.  Eligible subjects have up to 35 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening
Subjects who at Screening have any of the following are not eligible to rescreen or retest:
●A positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg);
●A positive HIV test;
●HCV genotype does not meet Inclusion Criterion 4, Section 5.2.1 , or meets 
Exclusion Criteria 4 and 5, Section 5.2.2 ;
●A positive serum pregnancy test (if female).
Otherwise subjects may be retested or rescreened only once.
Subjects who have exclusionary laboratory parameter(s) are allowed to retest on the 
related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary ALT requires a repeat chemistry panel) within the same screening period and must meet all eligibility laboratory criteria on any panel that is repeated.  If any of the retest result(s) are ex clusionary, the subject may not be rescreened.

5.1.2 Treatment Period
After meeting the eligibility criteria, subjects will be enrolled via IRT.  Subjects will be 
administered study drug at the site on Study Day 1, with dosing instructions.
Study visits and procedures during the Treatment Period are detailed in Appendix C .  
Safety and tolerability will be assessed th roughout the study.  Laboratory testing will 
include chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis as specified in Table 2 .  Plasma samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis and HCV RNA analysis will be collected as detailed in 
Section 5.3.1 and Section [IP_ADDRESS] Blood samples for optional pharmacogenetic analysis 
will be collected as detailed in Appendix C .
All subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis as outlined in Appendix C .  Sites should ensure that subjects adhe re to all study visits.  Subjects who 
cannot complete their study visit per the visit schedule should ensure they do not run out of study drug prior to their next study visit.   Compliance is critical to ensure adequate 
drug exposure.
HCV virologic failure criteria will be evaluated and applied by [CONTACT_187804] [IP_ADDRESS] .
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatment Period should return for a Treatment Discontinuation Visit and undergo the study procedures as outlined in Appendix C and as described in Section 5.4.1 .

infection.
●Subjects with an allowed prior HCV treatment will be categorized as:
○Non-responder:   HCV RNA detected at the end of a prior treatment 
course (except for breakthrough, which is captured separately).  These 
subjects are further categorized as:

[IP_ADDRESS] Concomitant Therapy
Subjects should be on a stable dose of concomit ant medications for at least 2 weeks prior 
to initiation of study drug.  The investigator should confirm that a concomitant 
medication/supplement can be safely administered with study drug.  Some medications may require dose adjustments due to the potential for drug-drug interactions. 
During the Post-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant 
medications/supplements and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications/supplements or revert to pre-st udy doses, 14 days following discontinuation 
of study drug, if applicable.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Therapy
Subjects must be able and willing to safely discontinue any prohibited medications or 
supplements listed in Table [ADDRESS_221631] 2 weeks or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior 
to the first dose of any study drug and not use these during the entire Treatment Period and for 14 days following discontinuation of study drug.

Liver Diagnostic Testing
Subjects will be considered to be non-ci rrhotic or ci rrhotic based on the definitions below:
Non-Cirrhotic
●A liver biopsy within 24 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating 
the absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, 
Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of ≤ 3, Ishak fibrosis score of ≤ 4; or
●A FibroScan®score of < 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period (FibroScan®must be approved by [CONTACT_187806]); or
●A Screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.48 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to 
Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) < 1.
Cirrhotic
●Previous histologic diagnosis of cirrhosis on liver biopsy, e.g., METAVIR, 
Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of > 3, Ishak 
score of > 4 or on a liver biopsy conducted during Screening; or
●A FibroScan®score of ≥ 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during 
Screening period (FibroScan®must be approved by [CONTACT_187806]); or
●A Screening FibroTest result that is ≥ 0.75 and an APRI > 2.
In the absence of a definitive diagnosis of presence or absence of cirrhosis by 
[CONTACT_187807]/APRI using the above criteria (indeterminate FibroTest [0.48 < result < 0.75], or conflicting FibroTest and APRI results [e.g., FibroTest ≤ 0.48, but APRI ≥ 1]), a liver 
biopsy or FibroScan
®is required.  Liver biopsy results will supersede Fibrotest/APRI or 
FibroScan®results and be considered definitive.  At Screening, it is recommended that 
subjects should otherwise meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria before undergoing a liver biopsy.
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Screening:  Liver Ultrasound 
HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure only at the 
Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, as indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D , for subjects with compensated cirrhosis only.  In-between those visits, HCC 
screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis will be required to undergo a liver ultrasound to screen for HCC, unless the subject has a historical liver ultrasound, CT scan or MRI performed for HCC screening within [ADDRESS_221652] scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., CT scan or MRI) at a study visit should be discussed with the study designated physician.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Instruments (Questionnaires)
Subjects will complete the self-administered PRO instruments (where allowed per local 
regulatory guidelines) on the study visits specified in Appendix C and Appendix D .  
Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with each instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item.  Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks.  
Subjects who are functionally unable to read any of the instruments may have site personnel read the questionnaires to them.  Site personnel should encourage completion of each instrument at all specified visits and should ensure that a response is entered for all items.
Short Form 36 – Version 2 Health Survey
The SF-36v2 is a general Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument with 
extensive use broad variety of health condi tions and is the standard in literature for 
HCV.  The SF-36v2 instrument comprises 36 total items (questions) targeting a 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221653]'s functional health and well-being in 8 domains (physical functioning, role 
physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functi oning, role emotional and 
mental health).  Domain scores are also aggregated into a Physical Component Summary score and a Mental Component Summary score.  Higher SF-36v2 scores indicate a better state of health.  The SF-36v2 should require approximately 10 minutes to complete.
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)-HCV Specific Instrument –
Version 2
The WPAI-Hepatitis C questionnaire is an instrument to measure impairments in both 
paid work and unpaid work from HCV-infected people.  It measures absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work productivity loss, as well as impairments in unpaid activity because of hepatitis C.  The WPAI-Hepatitis C consists of 6 questions:  1 = currently employed; 2 = hours missed due to hepatitis C; 3 = hours missed other reasons; 4 = hours actually worked; 5 = degree hepatitis C affected productivity while working (using a 0 to 10 visual analog scale [VAS]); 6 = degree hepatitis C affected productivity in regular unpaid activities (VAS).  The WPAI-Hepatitis C should require approximately 5 minutes to complete.
PRO instruments should be consistently presented so that subjects complete the questionnaires in the following order:  the SF-36v2 and WPAI-Hepatitis C.  PRO instruments should be completed prior to drug administration on Day [ADDRESS_221654] be completed and reviewed prior to enrollment.  Subjects 
who meet all the Inclusion Criter ia and none of the Exclusion Criteria at Screening will

drug discontinuation, but no later than [ADDRESS_221668]'s condition.  Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment.  The last dose of any study drug and reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the EDC (electronic data capture) system.  The subject should then begin the Post-

Specific instructions regarding subject pregnancy can be found in Section 6.1.[ADDRESS_221670]-Treatment Period as described in Section 5.1.3 .
[IP_ADDRESS] HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of HCV virologic failure for the 
purposes of subject management:
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV 
RNA measurement of > 1 log
10IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
study drug treatment.
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during study drug 
treatment.
When confirmatory testing is re quired, it should be completed as soon as possible and the 
subject should remain on study drug treatment until the virologic failure criteria has been 
confirmed.  Subjects meeting the virologic fail ure criteria will be discontinued from study 
drug and will continue to be followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the emergence and persistence of resistant viral variants until [ADDRESS_221671]-treatment.

5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
The current study (Study M16-126) is a Phase 3b study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
(percent of patients achieving SVR
12) and safety of combination regimen of GLE 300 mg 
and PIB 120 mg QD in treatment-naïve and -experienced subjects infected with chronic HCV GT5 and GT6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis for 8 weeks or 12 weeks, respectively. 
Treatment durations were selected based on available data (all SVR
4and available SVR 12
rates) from 8-week or 12-week treatment groups receiving GLE/PIB combinations in 
Studies M14-867 and M14-868 in HCV GT1, GT2, GT3, GT4, GT5, and GT6-infected non-cirrhotic p atients with or without previous treatment experience.
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221679] SVR 12rates without virologic 
failures, to date.  SVR 12rates were 97% (33/34), 98% (53/54), and 97% (28/29%) for 
GT1, GT2, and GT3, respectively.  In addition, the GLE/PIB 300 mg/120 mg combination regimen demonstrated 100% SVR
12in a total of 34 GT4, GT5, and GT6-infected non-
cirrhotic subjects wh en taken for a 12-week duration.  Based on the efficacy data 
presented above, the 8-week treatment duration is anticipated to achieve high SVR rates in GT5 – 6-infected treatment-naïve and -e xperienced subjects without cirrhosis.
13,14
The 12-week duration of the GLE/PIB combination regimen in adults with chronic HCV genotype (GT) 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 infection with compensated cirrhosis is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 3 (Study M14-172) study.  The number of GT5 (n = 3) and GT6 (n = 7) 
subjects enrolled were small.
With an expected SVR rate approaching 100%, as observed in the Phase [ADDRESS_221680] Population
This study plans to enroll HCV GT5, or 6-infected subjects, with or without compensated 
cirrhosis who are HCV treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced in order to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and antiviral activity of GLE/PIB.  Subjects who are treatment-naïve as well as those who have failed prior IFN or pegIFN (with or without RBV), or SOF plus RBV (with or without pegIFN) therap y for their HCV infection are included in 
the study in order to evaluate the efficacy of GLE/PIB regimen in this diverse cohort of

M16-[ADDRESS_221681] failed treatment with a PI [INVESTIGATOR_187785]5A inhibitor alone or in combination with interferon (with or without RBV) will not be permitted to enroll, because the results from ongoing Phase 2 study evaluating the regimen in DAA experienced patients (Study M15-410) are not available.
HCV-infected subjects with chronic HCV infection have moderate stable elevations of 
AST and ALT levels and are considered representative of the population who will receive anti-HCV therapy.  The age range selected for this study, [ADDRESS_221682] 
6 months prior to screening.  This is based on the results from Study M13-602 that evaluated the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and tolerability effects of the co-administration of methadone or buprenorphine/naloxone and GLE/PIB in adult subjects on stable opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], which showed acceptable safety and no relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interactions.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Dose Selections
The doses of 300 mg GLE and 120 mg PIB were selected to optimize efficacy of the 
combination while maintaining an acceptable safety profile, and to be consistent with the dose selection for GLE and PIB in the currently on-going [COMPANY_013] HCV Phase 3 studies.

[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_221684] been dosed with the combination of GLE and PIB in ongoing Phase 2b and Phase 3 studies to date.  This combination has b een well-tolerated and safe across all studies 
including cirrhotic and prior treatment experienced subjects (Data on file).  The most frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea and headache and were mostly Grade [ADDRESS_221685] been no on-
treatment ALT elevations above baseline grade.
Results from GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8-week treatment duration in HCV 
GT1 (n = 34) Study M14-867 Part 2) and HCV GT2 (n = 54) (Study M14-868 Part 2) showed 97.1% and 98.1% SVR
12respectively.  In Study M14-867 Part 2, GLE 300 mg 
QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 12 weeks was evaluated in 34 DAA-naïve HCV GT4 (n = 22), GT5 (n = 1), and GT6 (n = 11)-infected non-ci rrhotic sub jects.  All [ADDRESS_221686] 
SVR rates for GLE and PIB administered 8 weeks in HCV GT4-infected subjects and showed > 95% SVR in this population.  GLE 300 mg QD + PIB 120 mg QD for 8 weeks will be used in this study for HCV genotype 5 and 6 non-cirrhotic subjects.

showed 100% SVR
12for GLE 300 mg + PIB [ADDRESS_221687] SVR rates of 300 mg/120 mg GLE/PIB for 12 and 16 weeks in HCV GT1 subjects with cirrhosis, this GLE/PIB dose could provide improved SVR rates compared to lower doses and a duration of 12 weeks could achieve 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221688] 2016-003192-22
63
an SVR rate close to 100% in cirrhotic subjects with HCV GT1 infection.  Longer 
duration (e.g., 16 weeks) of 300 mg/120 mg GLE/PIB QD treatment is not expected to provide a significant improvement in the SVR rate (in GT1).  Similar to GT1, the 
predicted SVR rates for GT2 subjects with cirrhosis following 300 mg/120 mg GLE/PIB QD treatment for 12 weeks is 98%.  This dose is also anticipated to yield high SVR rate following 12-week treatment duration in GT4 to GT6 infected cirrhotic population.
In summary, based on clinical trial data and exposure-response analyses, it is expected 
that GLE 300 mg + PIB 120 mg QD will achieve high SVR rate in both non-cirrhosis (administered for 8 weeks) and compensated cirrhosis subjects (administered for 12 weeks).
[IP_ADDRESS] Risk of Development of Resistance Mutations During 
Combination DAA Trials
In subjects treated with a DAA, variants with amino acid substitution(s) in the targeted 
protein conferring resistance to the DAA can be selected.  For example, in [COMPANY_013] HCV Phase 3 studies in which patients with GT1 infection were treated with the NS3/4A protease inhibitor paritaprevir and NS5A inhibitor ombitasvir, variants that conferred resistance to paritaprevir or ombitasvir were detected in patients experiencing virologic failure.  While resistance data from patients treated with the combination of PIB and GLE are limited, it is expected that PIB, an NS5A inhibitor, will be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing resistance-associated variants in NS3 that confer resistance to GLE, because there should not be any cross-resistance in variants resistant to DAAs targeting different proteins.  The converse is expected to be true as well – GLE should be able to suppress the appearance of virus containing NS5A variants conferring resistance to PIB.  In addition, in vitro resistant col ony selection studies in HCV replicon cells 
containing GT1 – 6 NS5A demonstrated that PIB had a high genetic barrier to resistance –very few colonies were selected, and most of those that were selected contained NS5A variants that conferred only modest levels of resistance to PIB.  It remains to be seen whether the development of resistance in subjects treated with PIB resembles that seen in vitro.

6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only if they result in disconti nuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, (see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity management) and/or if the 
investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occu r during the study will not be considered 
an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is  being performed for a pre-existing condition 
and the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-
existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.

M16-[ADDRESS_221692]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonga tion of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.

6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4). 
The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI CTC AE for a given diagnostic/symptomatic AE term to identify and apply specific grading details for that AE entity. 
Grading System for Adverse Events (a semi-colon  indicates 'or' within the description of 
the grade).
Grade 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations 
only; intervention not indicated
Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age appropriate instrumental ADL*
Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening;

6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not re ported a causality or deemed it not assessable, 
[COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], an "Other" cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_26278].
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related nonserious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration.  From the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_221695]-Treatment Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

Specific toxicity management guidelines apply to the instances of increases in ALT 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Increases in ALT
If a subject experiences a post-baseline increase in ALT to > 5 × ULN which is also 
> 2 × baseline value, the subject should have a confirmatory ALT measurement performed.
If, the ALT increase is confirmed to be > 5 × ULN which is also > 2 × baseline value, the 
recommendations below should be followed:
●Complete hepatic questionnaire.
●Evaluate for alternate etiology of ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable), and obtain additional testing as appropriate (e.g., hepatitis B panel).
●Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
●Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and INR within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
●Discontinue study drug if any of the following is observed at any time:
○ALT level is ≥ 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
○Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of symptoms/signs of hepatitis.
○At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of ALT increases is permitted with approval of the [COMPANY_013] 
Therapeutic Area Medical Director.

one dose of study drug.
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population defined as 
all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug, unless otherwise 
specified.
Sensitivity analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint, when applicable, will be performed 
on the intention-to-treat population modified to exclude subjects not of GT5, 6 according to phylogenetic analyses (mITT-GT), and on the mITT-GT population further modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR
12for reasons other than virologic failure 
(mITT-GT-VF).
No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analysis except for analyses of SVR 
endpoints (HCV RNA data).  HCV RNA values will be selected for the analyses of all SVR endpoints (e.g., SVR
4, SVR 12, and SVR 24) based on defined visit windows.  A 
backward imputation method will be used to impute missing responses for SVR analyses.
8.1.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographics and baseline characteristics w ill be summarized for all treated subjects by 
[CONTACT_187826] (GT5 and 6 separately, across arms), by [CONTACT_40845] (A and B), and overall.  
Demographics include age, weight, height, BMI, gender, race, and ethnicity.  Baseline characteristics include HCV genotype subtype, IL28B genotype, prior HCV treatment history, baseline HCV RNA level, fibrosis stage (F0 – F1, F2, F3, F4 [if applicable]), tobacco (user, ex-user, or non-user) and alcohol use (drinker, ex-drinker, or non-drinker) status, former injection drug user, (yes, within  last 12 months; yes, more than 12 months 
ago; or no) use of stable opi[INVESTIGATOR_187788], history of diabetes, baseline metabo lic 
syndrome, history of bleeding disorders, history of depression or bipolar disorder, history of cardiovascular disease, geographic region, and all other subgroup variables defined in

All the demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized as continuous or 
categorical variables where appropriate.  Summary statistics (N, mean, median, SD, and range) will be generated for continuous variables (e.g., age and BMI), and the number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables (e.g., sex and race).
Treatment compliance to study drug will be calculated based on the percentage of tablets 
taken relative to the total tablets expected to be taken.  A subject is considered to be compliant if the percentage is between 80% and 120%.  Compliance will be calculated for each subject and summarized with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The percentage of compliant subjects will be summarized.
8.1.2 Efficacy
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population, unless otherwise specified.
Efficacy analyses will be performed within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) across 
treatment arms (representing the recommended per cirrhosis status) and in the combined treatment arms.
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by [CONTACT_187827]
®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan®HCV Quantitative 
Test, v2.0.  The notation "HCV RNA < LLOQ" is used to represent all HCV RNA values 
< 15 IU/mL, regardless of whether the HCV RNA is detectable or not.  HCV RNA ≥LLOQ are all quantifiable values.
IL28B will be reported as C/C, C/T, or T/T by [CONTACT_2237].
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint is the pe rcentage of subjects in who achieve SVR
12(HCV 
RNA < LLOQ [ADDRESS_221710] actual dose of study drug) within each genotype 
(GT5 and GT6 subjects) across the treatment arms.  The primary endpoint will be analyzed based on ITT population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be su mmarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the

normal approx imation to the bino mial distribution, unless the number of SVR 12non-
responders is less than 5, where the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence 
interval instead.
A summary of reason for SVR 12non-response (e.g., on-treatment virologic failure, 
relapse, other) will be provided.
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary efficacy endpoints within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) 
separately, across treatment arms are:
●The percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure;
●The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse.  
Subjects with reinfection based on HCV NGS will be summarized separately from relapse.
The secondary endpoints of HCV on-treatment virologic failure and post-treatment HCV 
virologic relapse will be analyzed within each genotype (GT5 and GT6 subjects) separately, across the treatment arms.
For the analysis of post-treatment HCV virol ogic relapse, completion of treatment is 
defined as any subject with study drug duration of [ADDRESS_221712]-tr eatment relapse, the number and percentage 
of subjects will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using 
Wilson's score method.
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis
As sensitivity analyses, the number and percentage of subjects in the mITT-GT and 
mITT-GT-VF populations achieving SVR
12, as applicable, will be summarized along with 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221713] 2016-003192-22
78
a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the normal approximation and a two-sided 
95% confidence interval using the Wilson's score method.
The two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method will also be 
calculated as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint of SVR 12based on ITT 
population.
[IP_ADDRESS] Subgroup Analysis
The subgroup analyses will be performed within each genotype separately.  The summary 
statistics of subjects with SVR 12will be provided for the following subgroups:

Further details about subgroup analysis will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Efficacy Endpoints
The following additional efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_7631]:
●The percentage of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ at each post-baseline visit 
in the Treatment Period (using data as observed);
●The percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 4four weeks after the last actual 
dose of study drug (SVR 4);
●The percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 24twenty-four weeks after the last 
actual dose of study drug (SVR 24);
●The percentage of subjects who relapse after achieving SVR 12.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each additional efficacy endpoint will be 
summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson's score interval.
A descriptive summary of SVR
12endpoints will be provided for GT5 and GT6 subjects 
separately and combined for all non-ci rrhotic sub jects who received 8 weeks of treatment 
and cirrhotic subjects who received 12 weeks of treatment in any of the following studies:  
Studies M14-868 Part 4, M14-172, or M16-126, using meta analytic methods.
8.1.3 Patient Reported Outcomes
The handling of missing data for patient reported outcomes (PROs) will be as follows.  If 
a respondent answers at least 50% of the items in a multi-item scale of the SF-36v2, the missing items will be imputed with the aver age score of the answered items in the same 
scale.  In cases where the respondent did not answer at least 50% of the items, the score for that domain will be considered missing.  The Mental and Physical Component Summary measures will not be computed if any domain is missing.  For WPAI Hepatitis C scores, no imputation will be performed for missing items.
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221715]-baseline timepoint in the SF-36v2 
Mental Component Summary (MCS) and Physical Component Summary (PCS) scores; WPAI activity impairment due to hepatitis C, overall work impairment, absenteeism, and presenteeism scores will be summarized descriptively at each visit and for change from baseline to each visit.  For each of these scores, mean change from Baseline to Final Treatment Visit and from Baseline to Post-Treatment Week 12 will be summarized using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) mode l with baseline score as a covariate.
The following analyses of patient reported outcomes (PROs) also will be performed:
●Cumulative number and percentage of subjects who have ever experienced an 
increase from baseline up through each applicable timepoint of greater than or 
equal to 3 points in the SF-36 MCS and PCS;
●Cumulative number and percentage of subjects who have ever experienced an increase from bas eline up through each applicable timepoint of greater than or 
equal to 5 points in the SF-36 MCS and PCS;
●Cumulative number and percentage of subjects who have ever experienced an 
increase from baseline up through each applicable timepoint of greater than or 
equal to 5 points in the SF-36 domain scores;
Additional analyses of PROs will be performed as useful and appropriate.
8.1.4 Resistance Analyses
For all subjects, full length NS3/4A or NS5A from baseline samples will be sequenced by 
[CONTACT_077].  For subjects who experience virologi c failure (on-treatment virologic failure or 
post-treatment relapse), full length NS3/4A and NS5A genes from the first sample after 
virologic failure with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL will be sequenced by [CONTACT_077].  An 
appropriate subtype specific prototypic reference sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.  Subjects treated with study drug who do not achieve SVR
12due to reasons other than virologic failure but have a time point with HCV RNA 
≥1000 IU/mL after treatment discontinuation, will have the sample at that time point 
sequenced.

and 168 in NS3; and 24, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 58, 92, and 93 in NS5A.
The following definitions will be used in the resistance analyses:
●Baseline variant:  a variant by [CONTACT_187828] a baseline sample ( ≥ 2% or ≥  15% 
prevalence within a subject's viral population depending on variant frequency 
threshold utilized) that was not present in the appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target (NS3/4A or NS5A).
●Variant at signature [CONTACT_187834]:  va riant (relative to reference) present 
in a baseline or a post-baseline sample at a signature [CONTACT_187834].
●Post-baseline variant:  an amino acid variant in a post-baseline time point 
sample that was not detected at baseline (< 2%) in the subject and is detectable in ≥ 2% of the sequences from the post-baseline sample.
●Enriched variant:  variant present in both the baseline and a post-baseline sample whose prevalence in the post-baseline sample is at least 20 percentage points greater than the prevalence in the baseline sample [(post-baseline % –
baseline %) ≥ 20].
●Treatment-emergent variant by [CONTACT_077]:  A post-baseline variant or an enriched 
variant.
Analysis 1:   The following analyses will be provided for all subjects, separated by [CONTACT_187829]:
●A listing of all baseline variants (2% detection threshold) at signature 
[CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target (NS3/4A and 
NS5A).
●A listing of all baseline variants (15% detection threshold) at non-signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A) for subjects who experience virologic failure.

Analysis 2:   The impact of baseline variants on treatment outcome will be assessed as 
follows:  for each variant, the SVR 12rate will be calculated for subjects with and without 
the variant and the 2 rates will be compared.  Analysis will be grouped by [CONTACT_187830] (NS3/4A or NS5A).
The following will be included in the analyses of impact of baseline variants on treatment 
outcome:
●For each signature [CONTACT_187834], presence of any variant at that position 
(vs no variant at that position), usi ng detection thresholds of both 2% and 15%.
●Each individual variant at each signature [CONTACT_187834] (vs not that variant) using detection thresholds of 2% and 15%.
●Variants at each non-signature [CONTACT_187836] a detection threshold of 
15%.
Analysis 3:   The following analyses will be performed for subjects who do not achieve 
SVR
12and who have post-baseline resistance data available:
●Listings by [CONTACT_187831]-emergent variants relative to the baseline 
amino acid sequences will be provided for each DAA target (NS3/4A and 
NS5A). 
●Listings by [CONTACT_41626]-baseline variant at signature [CONTACT_187837] r each DAA target (NS3/4A and NS5A).
HCV Genotype/Subtype
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV NS3/4A and/or NS5A sequence from 
baseline samples from all subjects in order to accurately determine genotype/subtype.  If the phylogenetic analysis is not available, then the result from Sanger sequencing of a region of NS5B by [CONTACT_187832]'s HCV genotype/subtype, if available.  Finally, if neither the phylogenetic analysis result nor the Sanger sequencing assay results is available, then the Inno-LIPA assay

M16-[ADDRESS_221718].  This 
information will be presented in summaries of efficacy subgroup analyses.
8.1.5 Safety
Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_187798] (i.e., cirrhosis status/study drug 
duration) and overall.  All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug will be included in the safety analyses.
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA).  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug through [ADDRESS_221719]-study drug dosing) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_41631] (SOC) and preferred term.  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events by [CONTACT_86953] (Grades 1 – 5) and relationship to 
each study drug will also be provided.  Subjects  reporting more than one adverse event for 
a given MedDRA preferred term will be counted only once for that term using the most severe grade for the severity grade table and the most related for the relationship to study 
drug tables.  Subjects reporting more than one type of event within a SOC will be counted only once for that SOC.
Additional analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Data
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized at each visit.  The baseline value will be the 
last non-missing measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug.  Mean changes from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including Final Treatment Visit, will be summarized descriptively.  Changes from baseline to post-baseline in the CTCAE grading of laboratory values will also be summarized.
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221720]-baseline shifts during treatment in clinical laboratory values from 
low/normal to high and high/normal to low based on the normal range will be summarized.
In addition, the number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-
specified criteria for Potentially Clinically Significant laboratory values or toxicity grades during treatment will be summarized.
[IP_ADDRESS] Vital Signs Data
Mean changes in temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight 
from baseline to each post-baseline visit, including final treatment visit, will be summarized.  The number and percentage of subjects with post-baseline values meeting pre-defined criteria for PCS (Potentially Clinically Significant) vital signs values during treatment will be summarized.
8.1.[ADDRESS_221721] and group.  Summary statistics will be computed for each time and visit.
Plasma concentration data from this study may be combined with data from other studies 
and analyzed using the following general methodology:
Population phar macokinetic analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time 
relative to dosing.  Pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect 
modeling approach with the NONMEM software (version VII, or higher version).  The structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of 
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221722] in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the 
parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models.
●The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the 
alternative model(s).
●The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a straight line with zero intercept 
and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
●Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra-subject error.
Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error 
structure) is developed, empi[INVESTIGATOR_187789].  The 
relationship between these conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject 
age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic or renal function, etc.) will be explored using either stepwise forward selection method, or generalized additive method (GAM) or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employed to evaluate the significance (at P< 0.005, corresponding to an increase in objective function > 7.88 for 
one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model.
In general, all continuous covariates will be entered in the model, initially in a linear 
fashion, with continuous covariates centered around the median value.  Linear or non-linear relationships of primary pharmacokinetic parameters with various covariates may also be explored.  For example:
Glecaprevir/Pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]
M16-[ADDRESS_221723] 2016-003192-22
86
TVCLi = Theta(1) + Theta(2) (Comedication [1,2,…]) + Theta(3) (WTi-median value) + 
Theta(4) (AGEi – median value).
Where TVCLi = Typi[INVESTIGATOR_187790]1, Theta(1) is the intercept 
and Theta(2) – (4) are regression parameters relating the fixed effects (weight and age centered on the median value) to clearance.
Relationship between exposure and clinical observations (antiviral activity) will be 
explored.  Exposure-response relationships for primary and secondary efficacy variables 
and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.
The relationship between exposure (e. g., population pharmacokinetic model predicted 
concentrations over time or average concentrations or AUC or trough concentrations of 
the individual model-predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and antiviral activity will be explored.
Additionally, relationship between exposure and safety endpoints of interest may also be 
explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
It is anticipated that approximately a total of  80 HCV infected patients, (~30 GT5-infected 
subjects and ~50 GT6-infected subjects) will be enrolled in the study.  A minimum of 
15 GT5 and 30 GT6 subjects will be enrolled and up to approximately 16 subjects with compensated cirrhosis (regardless of GT) will be enrolled.  No formal hypothesis is being tested.  If the observed SVR
12rate in this study is 97% among 30 GT5 subjects and 
50 GT6 subjects, then the half-width of 2-sided 95% normal approximation intervals are 0.061 and 0.047 for the GT5 and GT6 subjects, respectively.  
8.3 Randomization Methods
This study is not randomized.  Eligible subjects will be allocated to a treatment arm 
according to their cirrhosis status (presence/absence).

M16-[ADDRESS_221726] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study can be found in the informed consent form.
An informed consent, approved by [CONTACT_2717]/IEC, must be voluntarily signed and dated 
before samples are collected for optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research.  The nature of the testing should be explained and the subject given an opportunity to ask questions.  The informed consent must be signed before the samples are collected and any testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to provide samples for the optional pharmacogenetic exploratory research, it will not impact their participation in the study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional pharmacogenetic 
exploratory research samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject 
specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once [COMPANY_013] is informed, the optional samples will be destroyed.  However, if the subject withdraws his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as 
part of the overall research data.

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Screening:  Liver Ultrasound 
HCC screening will be required as a protocol-specified study procedure only at the 
Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, as indicated in Appendix C and 
Appendix D , for subjects with compensated cirrhos is only.  In-between those visits, HCC 
screening should be performed according to standard of care.
At the Screening Visit and at Post-Treatment Week 24, subjects with compensated 
cirrhosis will be required to undergo a liver ultrasound to screen for HCC, unless the subject has a historical liver ultrasound, CT scan or MRI performed for HCC screening within [ADDRESS_221776] scan or MRI.  Alternate methods of screening for HCC (i.e., CT scan or MRI) at a study visit should be discussed with the study designated physician.

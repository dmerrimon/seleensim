Maribavir 08 Jul 2020
Rationale:
This study is being conducted to compare the PK, safety, and tolerability of maribavir administered as a single 
oral dose in healthy adult subjects of Japanese descent and matched, healthy, adult non -Hispanic, Caucasian 
subjects. In addition, this study will assess the dose -proportionality and PK of maribavir in healthy, adult 
subjects of Japanese descent.
In accordance w ith the ICH -E5, this study is designed to evaluat e whether there is any ethnic difference in PK 
and safety of maribavir between Japanese and non -Japanese subjects. These data w ill inform the bridging of 
safety and efficacy data from non -Japanese subjects to the Japanese population.
The results from this study will be utilized to guide dose selection for a future Phase 3 study in Japanese 
transplant patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration:
Maribavir is the investigational product (IP) for this study and w ill be administered orally as a single 200 mg 
(1×200 mg tablet, current Phase 3 formulation), 400 mg (2×200 mg tablets), and 800 mg (4×200 mg tablets) 
dose.
Methodology:
This is a Phase 1, open -label, randomized, crossover, partially fixed sequence, single- center study to evaluate 
the PK profile, safety, and tolerability of maribavir administered in healthy, adult subjects of Japanese descent 
and matched, healthy, adult, non -Hispanic, Caucasian subjects. The non -Hispanic, Caucasian subjects will 
receive a single oral dose of 400 mg maribavir on Day 1. For this cohort there will be one treatment period 
(Table5and Table 6).The Japanese subjects will receive 3 doses of maribavir separated by a 72 -hour washout 
period betw een doses: in Treatmen t Period 1 on Day 1, they will receive a single oral dose of 400 mg of 
maribavir; in Treatment Period 2 and Treatment Period 3 on Day 1, they will be randomized to receive a single 
oral dose of either 200 mg follow ed by  800 mg of maribavir or vice versa ( Table 1, Table 2, Table3, and 
Table 4).A total of 24 subjects will be enrolled: 12 subjects of Japanese descent and 12 non-Hispanic, 
Caucasian subjects. Non -Hispanic, Caucasian subjects w ill be matched to Japanese subjects based on age 
(years), sex, a nd BMI ( 15%). 
The study will comprise a [ADDRESS_390455] -treatment follow -up 
telephone call at 7 (±4) days after the last dose of IP for all subjects. Screening will occur within [ADDRESS_390456] dose. Subjects w ill be admitted to the clinical research center (CRC) on Day -1. All subjects (Japanese and 
Caucasian) can have their typi[INVESTIGATOR_317324]; all subjects (Japanese and Caucasian) will receive 
identical meals on Day 1 (up to [ADDRESS_390457] dose) in all treatment periods to maintain control. Doses will be 
administered with a glass (240 mL) of room temperature water after at least a 10-hour overnight fasting, with 
water restricted [ADDRESS_390458] is approximately 37 days and approximately 47 days 
for the subjects of Japanese descent, if the maximum screening period, treatment, washout, a nd follow -up visit 
durations are used. 
Treatment Period:
In Treatment Period 1, all study subjects (both Japanese and Caucasian) will receive maribavir as a 
single oral dose of 400 mg.
In Treatment Periods 2 and 3, all subjects of Japanese descent will re ceive maribavir as a single oral 
dose of either 200 mg or 800 mg, depending upon randomization assignment.

TAK -620-1020 Protocol Amendment 1
Maribavir 08 Jul 2020
Assessments
Serial blood samples for PK analysis will be collected in each treatment period for the determination of 
maribavir and  plasma concentrations at pre -dose and up to approximately [ADDRESS_390459] dose. 
These blood samples will be collected according to the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1, Table2, 
Table 3, Table4, Table5, and Table 6).
Safety and tolerability will be determined th rough assessment of treatment -emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) from the first dose to the post -treatment follow -up telephone call at 7 (±4) days after the last 
dose of IP, and vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and clinical laboratory evaluations on Day [ADDRESS_390460] dose in each treatment period .
Follow -up
A post- treatment follow -up telephone call will occur at 7 (±4) days after the last dose of IP for each 
subject. Subjects who experience AEs will be follow ed longer if needed, incl uding an unscheduled 
clinic visit if appropriate, depending on the nature, severity, and seriousness of the AE.

parameters will be presented as w ell. 
Figures ofindividual andmean (±SD) maribavir concentration -time profiles wi ll be generated on linear and 
semi -log scales. The mean plots will be generated and presented by [CONTACT_317348]-Hispanic, Caucasian cohort. Figures of PK parameters and dose -normalized C max, AUC last, and AUC 0-infvs. 
dose in Japanes e subjects will be generated. Box -Whisker plots for selected PK parameter will be generated 
with Japanese cohort and non -Hispanic Caucasian side by [CONTACT_10167]. 
In order to compare the PKs of maribavir betw een subjects of Japanese descent and matched, non -Hispan ic, 
Caucasian subjects, the differences of log -transformed PK parameters (AUC last, AUC 0-inf, and C max) from the 
maribavir 400 mg oral dose will be examined between cohorts using an analysis of variance model. The 
geometric mean ratio and its 90% CI of PK p arameters will be provided from the model. In addition, the 
difference of log -transformed dose -norm alized AUC 0-inf, AUC lastand C maxwill be examined betw een the 
Japanese cohort estimated at the 200 mg dose and the non -Hispanic, Caucasian cohort estimated at the 400 mg 
dose, as w ell as between the Japanese cohort estimated at the 800 mg dose and the non -Hispanic, Caucasian 
cohort estim ated at 400 mg dose, using an analysis of variance model. The geometric mean ratio and its 90% CI
of PK parameters will be provided from the model. Forest plots of geometric mean ratios for selected PK 
parameters between Japanese cohort and the non -Hispani c Caucasian cohort at 400 mg will be generated.  
Dose proportionality will also be examined for maribavir PK parameters for the Japanese subjects. Dose 
proportionality will be assessed f or C maxand AUC (AUC lastand AUC 0-inf) using the power model. The pow er 
model assumes a linear relationship betw een the natural log transformed PKparameter and the natural log 
transformed dose.
ln (Parameter) = α + β × ln (Dose) + Random error
Where α is the intercept, β is the slope, and Random error is a random residual error. Dose proportionality will 
be assessed by [CONTACT_317349] -sided 90% CI from the pow er model. The fold 
increase in PK parameters and associated 90% C I when doubling the dose will be presented.  
Safety Endpoints:
Safety will be assessed for the following evaluations:
Number, severity, seriousness, and causality of TEAEs
Changes in vital signs , ECGs, and clinical laboratory results (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) 
from baseline to post -baseline time points. Baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment prior 
to the first dose.
Statistical Methodology for Safety Endpoints:
Safety data, including TEAEs, laboratory tests, ECGs, and vital signs, will be summarized. Quantitative safety 
data, as w ell as the difference from baseline, if applicable, will be summarized by [CONTACT_9086]. 
Frequency counts will be compi[INVESTIGATOR_10140]. Direct safety comparisons 
betw een the two cohorts will be presented from the maribavir 400 mg dosing data. All other safety data from the 
200 mg and 800 mg doses in the subjects of Japanese descent w ill be summar ized and listed. 
Sample Size Justification:
The sample size consideration for the primary objective of evaluating the PK profile of maribavir, administered 
as a single oral dose at 400 mg, betw
een Japanese subjects and matched, healthy, adult, non -Hispani c, 
Caucasian subjects is based on feasibility and comparable studies. A total of 24 subjects (12 subjects of 
Japanese descent and 12 matched, non -Hispanic, Caucasian subjects) will be targeted to be enrolled in the study.

1. BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON
1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a beta herpesvirus that commonly  infects humans; serologic 
evidence of prior infection can be found in 40% to 100% of various adult populations (de la Hoz 
et al. 2002). However, s ymptomatic CMV infection or CMV disease occurs almost exclusively  
in individuals with compromised immune sy stems. CM V remains a significant problem for 
patients undergoing various ty pes of transplants that are associated with the use of potent 
immunosuppressive chemotherap y, including hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) and 
solid organ transplants (SOT) ( de la Hoz et al. 2002
; Razonable and Emery  2004 ).
It has been found that CMV infection increases incidence of opportunistic infections and graft 
rejection, and decreased allograft and patient survival ( Rubin 1989; Hodson et al. 2005; 
Ljungman et al. 2006 ). Organ- specific associations with CMV infection include bronchiolitis 
obliterans in lung recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], vanishing bile duct sy ndrome in liver recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], accelerated 
transplant vasculopath y in heart recipi[INVESTIGATOR_317327] y, transplant renal artery 
stenosis or increased risk of transplant rejection ( Razonable and Emery  2004 ; Legendre and 
Pascual 2008; Richardson et al. 1981 ; Pouria et al. 1998; Farrugia and Schwab 1992). These 
effects are believed to be mediated b y the ability of the virus to modulate the immune system, 
either directly  or secondary  to the host antiviral response through regulation of cy tokine, 
chemokine, and/or growth factor production.
CMV prevention strategies (proph ylaxis) for various high- risk transplant subjects exist, however, 
CMV infection or disease can still occur within the ear ly (initial ~3 months) or later 
post-transplantation time periods ( Boeckh et al. 2003 ; Legendre and Pascual 2008). I n kidney  
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the highest incidence of s ymptomatic CMV infection (sy ndrome) or disease 
occurs in CMV -seronegative recipi[INVESTIGATOR_317328] a kidney  from a CMV -seropositive donor 
(D+/R -) (Paya et al. 1989 ; Kanj et al. 1996 ; Singh et al. 2004 ; Winston et al. 1 995).
Although the currentl y availabl e systemic anti- CMV agents, intravenous (IV) or oral ganciclovir, 
oral valganciclovir (a prodrug of ganciclovir with improved bioavailability ), IV foscarnet, and IV 
cidofovir are generall y effective, their use is limited by [CONTACT_317350]; bon e marrow 
suppression caused b y ganciclovir/valganciclovir and renal impairment caused by [CONTACT_317351] ( Boeckh et al. 2003 ; Ljungman et al. 2001
; Reusser et al. 2002 ; Salzberger et al. 1997). 
These toxicities are of particular concern in transplant patients, in whom the bone marrow has 
been ablated or significantly  suppressed (HSCT patients), who receive ongoing 
immunosuppressants to prevent organ rejection (SOT patients) or graft
-versus host disease (in 
HSCT patients), or who may require the use of other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_317329] s or other organs (SOT and HSCT patients). 
Development of anti -viral resistance to currently  available anti- CMV agents is also an ongoing 
clinical problem in solid organ and stem cell transplantation leading to graft loss and even 
mortality  for some transplant patients. As described by  [CONTACT_317352] e et al. 2000, ganciclovir resistance 
developed in 7% D+/R -kidney , liver, and pancreas recipi[INVESTIGATOR_317330] 
3 months of oral ganciclovir. Ganciclovir resistant disease accounted for 20% of CMV dis ease,

occurred late (a median of 10 months after transplantation), was associated with higher intensit y 
of immunosuppression, and was considered a clinically serious concern ( Avery  2007)
.
There are no approved therapi[INVESTIGATOR_317331], and no approved treatment for CMV infection or disease that is resistant or 
refractory  to currentl y available therapi[INVESTIGATOR_227323] y population. Maribavir is currentl y in Phase [ADDRESS_390495] version of the maribavir (SHP620/TAK -620) Investigator’s brochure (IB).
1.2.[ADDRESS_390496] CMV ( Chulay  et al. 1999 ) and a favorable nonclinical and clinical safet y profile. It 
is a potent member of a new class of drugs, the benzimidazole ribosides ( Williams et al. 2003 ). 
In side -by-side in vitro assay s maribavir is [ADDRESS_390497] 100 -fold more potent than foscarnet ( Biron et al. 2002; Drew et al. 2006 ). 
Maribavir is active in vitro against strains of CMV that are resistant to ganciclovir, foscarnet, or 
cidofovir.
Unlike currently available anti -CMV agents that inhibit CMV deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) 
polymerase, maribavir inhibits the CMV UL 97 serine/threonine kinase b y competitively  
inhibiting the binding of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to the kinase ATP -binding site ( Biron et 
al. 2002 ; Williams et al. 2003 ; Krosky  et al. 2003 ; Wolf et al. 2001
; Kern et al. 2004); the 
dominant phenoty pic inhibitory  effect of maribavir is on viral DNA assembly  and egress of vira l 
capsids from the nucleus of infected cells ( Biron et al. 2002 ). Except for ganciclovir, maribavir 
does not antagonize the effects of other anti -viral (anti- CMV) agents. Since ganciclovir is 
dependent on its initial phosphory lation by  [CONTACT_317353]97 kinase , maribavir may  antagonize its 
clinical efficacy . 
1.2.[ADDRESS_390498] dose. After administration of 
single and multiple doses (both twice dail y [BID] and 3 times daily [TID] regimens) over 
28days, total maribavir plasma concentrations increased with increasing dose proportionally  up 
to 900 mg. At dose levels ≥900 mg BID, there was no apparent increase in maximum observed 
plasma concentration (C max) levels, and above this level, the increase in area under the plasma 
concentration versus time curve (AUC) may  be le ss than dose proportional. Maribavir 
demonstrates time-independent pharmacokinetics (PK). Pharmacokinetics data obtained in 
Phase 2 studies were similar to the data observed in healthy  volunteers.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 30
TAK -620-1020 Protocol Amendment 1
Maribavir 08 Jul 2020
Administration of maribavir in conjunction with food resulted in a 28% decrease in C maxwithout 
a significant effect on AUC when compared to administration under fasting conditions. 
Bioavailability  of a 100 mg tablet was unaffected by  [CONTACT_317354].
Maribavir was bound to plasma proteins, namel y human serum albumin, lipoproteins, and 
alpha -1-acid-glycoprotein. The fraction of unbound maribavir was estimated at approximately  
1.5% in healthy  subjects and 0.96% in transplant patients. The apparent plasma elimination 
half-life for unchanged maribavir was approximately  5-7 hours. Maribavir is metabolized 
primarily  in the liver through cy tochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 pathway  with the formation of the 
primary  metabolite, VP44469. VP44469 does not have anti
-CMV activity  and does not affect 
major CYP enzy mes or transporter activity . Renal clearance is a minor route of elimination of 
maribavir. Data from a Phase 1 study  demonstrated no gender differences in maribavir PK. A 
population PK analy sis conducted using pooled PK data from HP620- 202 and SHP620-
203 did 
not show apparent PK differences in Asian vs. non -Asian subjects; however, the sample size of 
Asian subjects was small (n=7).
Clinical studies conducted to evaluate the potential of drug -drug interactions demonstrated the 
following:
Concomitant admi nistration of maribavir (400 mg BID) with tacrolimus, a substrate of 
CYP3A4 and P -glycoprotein (P -gp), resulted in increased tacrolimus C maxand AUC by  
38% and 51%, respectively .
Maribavir does not have a clinically  significant effect on the activity  of CY P1A2, 
CYP3A, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6; however, it inhibits CYP2C19 activity  (based on 
plasma omeprazole/5 -OH omeprazole ratio). A follow -up clinical study  indicates 
maribavir had no effect on the PK of voriconazole (a CYP2C19 substrate).
In vivo, maribavir [ADDRESS_390499] digoxin AUC; however, it increased C max
by 24.8%.
Concurrent administration of rifampin, an inducer of CYP3A4 and P -gp, and maribavir 
significantl y reduced plasma concentrations of maribavir, resulting in a 61% reduction 
in AUC, reduce d half -life, and significantl y increased clearance, most likely  due to 
induction of hepatic and intestinal CYP3A4, and possible enhancement of P -gp 
transport.
Concomitant administration of antacid has no effect on maribavir exposure.
Concomitant administration of ketoconazole increased maribavir AUC and C maxby 
46% and 10%, respectively .
1.2.4 Efficacy
Two Phase 2 studies were conducted to assess the safet y, tolerability, and anti -CMV activity  of 
maribavir for treatment of CMV infections: Study  1262 -202 (SHP620 -202) in transplant subjects 
with CMV infections or disease that are resistant or refractory to treatment with anti -CMV 
agents conducted in the US and Study  1262- 203 (SHP620- 203) in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_317332]-type CMV infections who do not hav e CMV organ disease (as ymptomatic) conducted in 
Europe. In both these studies subjects received maribavir at [ADDRESS_390500] range of oral doses f rom 50 mg/day  to 
2400 mg/day . Clinical safety  experience has been obtained from 16 Phase 1 studies in adult, 
healthy  volunteers, special populations (subjects with renal and hepatic impairment, and stable 
renal transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]), and human immunodefic iency  virus (HIV)-infected subjects. These 
studies included adult subjects only . Maribavir has been administered across a broad range of 
oral doses from 50 mg/day to 2400 mg/day . The most common TEAE in single -and multiple -
dose Phase 1 studies was taste d isturbance (d ysgeusia). A definitive corrected QT interval (QTc) 
study  demonstrated no clinically  significant repolarization effect of maribavir administered 
orally  at single doses of [ADDRESS_390501] common treatment -emergent 
adverse event (TEAE) in single -and multiple -
dose Phase 1 studies was taste disturbance 
(dysgeusia). Among maribavir -treated subjects, d ysgeusia was reported b y up to 80% of subjects 
across the single -dose studies (dose range, 50 mg to 600 mg) and b y 64% to 92% of subjects 
across the multiple-dose studies (dose range, 300 mg/day  to 2400 mg/day). Of the 259 case s of 
dysgeusia reported by  [CONTACT_317355] -treated subjects in Phase 1, 252 were mild or moderate and 
7were of severe intensity. Dy sgeusia was generally  reported as a bitter or metallic taste that was 
considered related to maribavir administration. I n a few cases, the taste disturbance was reported 
as more noticeable with liquids, especially  cold beverages. Dy sgeusia usually  started within 
1hour after maribavir dosing and resolved within approximately  8 hours after dosing in the 
single -dose studies (range, 0.5 hours to 25 hours) and within [ADDRESS_390502] dose in the 
multiple -dose studies. No subjects were withdrawn from treatment because of taste disturbance. 
Among maribavir -treated subjects, 94% (778/831) of TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensit y; 
62% ( 517/831) of TEAEs were considered b y the investigator to be related to maribavir. 
Maribavir had a favorable safet y and tolerability  profile in both the Phase [ADDRESS_390503] common TEAEs that appeared to be associated with maribavir 
treatment were d ysgeusia and gastrointestinal (GI) -related events (eg, diarrhea, nausea, and 
vomiting). These events were generally  of mild or moderate intensit y. There were no signals of 
clinically  significant effects of maribavir on vital si gns, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, or 
laboratory  findings in the studies conducted for CMV prophy laxis.
In both Phase 2 studies for treatment of CMV infection (Studies SHP620 -202 and SHP620 -203), 
subjects received maribavir at 1 of 3 dose strengths: 400, 800, or 1200 mg BID, and both studies 
demonstrated that maribavir was well -tolerated with no safet y concerns at all doses evaluated. In 
Study SHP620 -202, TEAEs that occurred were events already  observed in previous studies (ie, 
dysgeusia, GI events, e levated immunosuppressant drug levels, and rash) and there were no 
additional safet y concerns raised from this study. In Study  SHP620- 203, TEAEs that occurred at 
a higher frequency  in maribavir subjects compared with valganciclovir were events alread y 
observed in previous studies with maribavir (ie, dy sgeusia, GI events, and elevated 
immunosuppressant drug levels). Anal yses of clinical laboratory , vital signs, and ECG data did 
not identify  any clinically meaningful differences across the maribavir treatment cohorts .

The study  design flow chart is presented in Figure 1.
Subjects will be screened within [ADDRESS_390505] (IP). 
Subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) on Day  -1. 
For the non -Hispanic, Caucasian group, the stud y will comprise a 28 -day Screening Period and 
Treatment Period 1. These subjects will receive a single oral dose of 400 mg maribavir on Day 1 
and will be discharged on Day  2. For this cohort there will be one treatment period ( Table 5and 
Table 6).
For the subjects of Japanese descent, the study  will comprise a [ADDRESS_390506] a 
72-hour washout period between doses: in Treatment Period 1 on Day 1, they  will receive a 
single oral dose of 400mg of maribavir; in Treatment Period 2 and Treatment Period 3 on Day 1, 
they will be randomized to receive a single oral dose of 200 mg followed by  800 mg of maribavir 
or a single oral dose of 800 mg followed b y 200 mg maribavir ( Table 1,Table 2,Table3
, and 
Table 4). 
All subjects (Japanese and Caucasian) can have their ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_317326] ; all subjects 
(Japanese and Caucasian) will receive identical meals on Day
 1 (up to [ADDRESS_390507] dose) in all 
treatment periods to maintain control. All maribavir doses will be administered with a glass 
(240 mL) of room temperature water after at least a 10 -hour overnight fasting, with water 
restricted 1 hour before and 1 hour after dosing. Food will be provided to subjects approximately  
4hours after study  drug administration. ( Assessing the Effects of Food on Drugs in INDs and 
NDAs –Clinical Pharmacology  Considerations, 2019). Vomiting occurring within [ADDRESS_390508] a 72- hour washout between maribavir d oses for 
the subjects of Japanese descent.
The study  duration for the non
-Hispanic, Caucasian cohort will comprise a 28- day screening 
period and Treatment Period 1. For the subjects of Japanese descent, the study  duration will 
comprise a 28- day screening p eriod and Treatment Periods 1, 2, and 3. For both groups 
(Japanese and Caucasian subjects), there will be a post- treatment follow -up telephone call at 
7(±4) day s after the last dose of IP.
The total number of nights subjects will be expected to stay  at th e CRC is approximately  [ADDRESS_390509] is 
approximately  37 day s and approximately  47 days for the subjects of Japanese descent, if the 
screening, treatment, washout, and follow-up visit durations are used.
Treatment Period:
In Treatment Period 1, all study  subjects (both Japanese and Caucasian) will receive 
maribavir as a single 400 mg o ral dose. For the non -Hispanic, Caucasian group there 
will be only  one treatment period.
In Treatment Periods 2 and 3, all subjects of Japanese descent will receive maribavir 
as a single oral dose of either 200 mg or 800 mg, depending upon randomization 
assignment.
Pharmacokinetic Assessments
Serial blood samples for PK analy sis will be collected in each treatment period for the 
determination of maribavir and  plasma concentrations at pre- dose and up to 
approximately  [ADDRESS_390510] dose. These blood samples will be collected according to 
the Schedules of Assessments ( Table 1, 
Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, and 
Table 6).
Safety Assessments
Safety  and tolerability  will be determined through assessment of TEAEs from the first 
dose to the post -treatm ent follow -up telephone call at 7 (±4) day s after the last dose 
of IP, and vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory evaluations on Day  [ADDRESS_390511] dose in each treatment period . 
Follow -up
A post -treatment follow -up telephone call will occur at 7 (±4) day s after the last dose 
of IP for each subject. Subjects who experience AEs will be followed longer if 
needed, including an unscheduled clinic visit if appropriate, depending on the nature, 
severit y, and seriousness of the AE.
Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection
Maribavir 400 mg BID is the clinical dose currently  being evaluated in the ongoing 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_9205] 3 studies; therefore, a single oral dose of 400 mg maribavir was 
selected for evaluating the primary  objective of this study  –to compare maribavir PK 
between Japanese and Caucasian subjects. Maribavir has demonstrated 
time-independent PK and a favorable safet y profile in previous Phase 1 studies. 
Therefore, evaluating PK following repeated dosing, eg, 400 mg BID, is not 
necessary  in this study . Although dose proportionality  of PK for doses from 50 mg up 
to 900 mg was demonstrated in previous studies in Caucasian subjects, to explore the 
appropriate clinical dosage in Japanese subjects the lower and higher dosages were 
also selected to assess dose proportionality  and to support the future Phase 3 clinical

development of maribavir in Japanese subjects. Therefore, the secondary  objective of 
the study  was to evaluate dose proportionality  of maribavir PK in subjects of 
Japanese descent. The doses of 200, 400, and 800 mg were selected for evaluating 
dose proportionality as a more than two-fold differences in systemic exposure to 
maribavir is not expected in Japanese subjects as compared to Caucasian sub
jects. As 
the primary  objecti ve is to compare maribavir PK at 400 mg, the 400 mg dose is to be 
evaluated in Treatment Period 1 in both Japanese and Caucasian subjects to avoid 
treatment period effects on this comparison.

6.2.2 Dosing
The non- Hispanic, Caucasian subjects will receive a single oral dose of 400 mg maribavir 
(2×200 mg maribavir tablets) on Day  1. The Japanese subjects will receive 3 doses of maribavir: 
on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1, they  will receive a single oral dose of 400 mg of maribavir 
(2×200 mg maribavir tablets); on Day  1 of Treatment Period 2, they will be randomized to 
receive a single oral dose of either 200 mg (1×200 mg tablets) or 800 mg of maribavir 
(4×200 mg maribavir tablets); and on Day  1 of Treatment Period 3, they  will receive a single oral 
dose of whichever dosage they  did not receive on D ay 1 of Treatment Period 2 (200 mg or 
800mg).  
6.2.3 Administration
All subjects (Japanese and Caucasian) can have their ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_317326] ; all subjects 
(Japanese and Caucasian) will receive identical meals on Day 1 (up to [ADDRESS_390541] dose) in all 
treatment periods to maintain control. All maribavir doses will be administered with a glass 
(240 mL) of room temperature water after at least a [ADDRESS_390542] a 72 -hour washout between maribavir doses for the subjects of
Japanese descent (Assessing the Effects of Food on Drugs in INDs and NDAs –Clinical

6.3 Labeling, Packaging, Storage, and Handling
6.3.1 Labeling
Labels containing study  information and pack identification are applied to the I P container.
All IP (maribavir) is labeled with a minimum of the protocol number, medication identification 
number (if applicable), dosage form (including product name [CONTACT_49141]), directions 
for use, storage conditions, batch number and/or packagi ng reference, the statements “For 
clinical trial use only ” and/or “CAUTION: New Drug –Limited b y Federal (or US) Law to 
Investigational Use” and “Keep out of reach of children,” and the sponsor’s name [CONTACT_3816].
Additional labels (eg, those used when di spensing marketed product) may , on a case
-by-case 
basis, be applied to the IP in order to satisfy  local or institutional requirements, but must not:
Contradict the clinical study  label
Obscure the clinical study label
Identify  the study  subject by  [CONTACT_10178]’s prior full agreement.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_390543] is packaged in the following labeled container:
Maribavir tablet: [ADDRESS_390544]/nominated team member will 
enter the unique subject identifier (if allowed b y law/r egulations) on the IP bottle/carton labels as 
they are distributed.
Investigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. 
Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the I P is maintained 
within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study  and that records are maintained; 
the temperature should be monitored continuously by  [CONTACT_103338] -house sy stem, a 
mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or b y manual means, such that 
both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded 
and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified min/max thermometer) would require 
manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must be notified immediately  upon discovery  
of an y excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require site 
investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of 
excursions on the I P and will provide supportive documentation as necessary . Under no 
circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined 
and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor.
The sponsor should be notified immediately  if there are an y changes to the storage area of the IP 
that could affect the integrity  of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room.
6.4 Drug Accountability
Investigators wi ll be provided with sufficient amounts of the I P to carry  out this protocol for the 
agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the IP, 
documenting shipment content and condition. Accurate records of all IP dispensed , used, 
returned, and/or destro yed must be maintained as detailed further in this section.
The investigator has overall responsibility  for administering/dispensing I P. Where permissible, 
tasks may  be delegated to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmacist) who is adequatel y trained in the 
protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. This delegation must be 
documented in the applicable study  delegation of authority  form.

[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event Collection
At each stud y visit and at the post -treatment follow -up telephone call, subjects will be questioned 
in a general way  to ascertain if AEs have occurred since the previous visit (eg, “Have you had 
any health problems since y our last vi sit?”). Adverse events are collected from the time informed 
consent is signed. (Refer to Appendix 2for AE definitions, assessment, collection time frame, 
and reporting procedures.)

the study , in order to minimize external variability of the readings. It is advised that 
measurements be collected at a comfortable room temperature with little to no background noise, 
using the same (appropriately sized) cuff placed at the same location of the same arm during the 
study . The bladder should be deflated (c alibrated for oscillometric method or manually  by 
[CONTACT_10182]) at a rate of 2- 3 mmHg/s (and the first and last audible sounds recorded as 
systolic and diastolic pressure) after at least [ADDRESS_390552] a bladder length that is 80% and a width that is at least 40% of arm 
circumference (a length -to-width ratio of 2:1). 
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing that covers the location of cuff placement. 
The subject should not have exercised or c onsumed coffee, black tea, cola, chocolate, alcohol, or 
nicotine within [ADDRESS_390553] should be l ying comfortabl y, with the legs uncrossed. The arm should be supported 
with a pi[INVESTIGATOR_6356], such that the middle of the cuff on the upper arm is at the level of the right atrium 
(approximately  halfway  between the bed and the level of the sternum) .
At the Screening Visit, blood pressure should be compared between both arms. 
One reading in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_317335]. When there is a consistent inter -arm difference 
in either SBP/DBP confirmed over 3 consecutive measurements (>10mmHg), the arm with the 
higher blood pressure should be used for inclusion at screening and the last measurement 
recorded in the CRF. The same (right or left) arm with the higher blood pressure will be used 
throughout the stud y. 
The use of automated devices for measuring pulse rate is acceptable although, when done 
manually , pulse rate will be measured in the brachial/radial artery  for at least [ADDRESS_390554] as a distraction for the patient (ie, pretend ing he/she is taking the subject’s radial pulse) 
and count the respi[INVESTIGATOR_38855] [ADDRESS_390555]

[IP_ADDRESS] Electrocardiogram
Twelve -lead ECGs will be performed at the times specified in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3
, Table 4, 
Table 5, and Table 6. All ECGs will be performed using the equipment supplied by  [CONTACT_10186].
The following parameters will be recorded on the appropriate CRF page: heart rate, PR, RR, 
QRS, and QT intervals. The Fridericia's correction for QT interval (QTcF) will be derived from 
the data in the database. The investigator’s assessment of the ECG tra cing as normal or abnormal 
must be documented, and if abnormal, his/her determination of whether the abnormality  is 
clinically  significant or not, will be documented on the tracing and recorded in the CRF.
The subject should be asked to remove all clothing
that covers the location of lead placement.
The subject should not have exercised or consumed coffee, black tea, cola, chocolate, alcohol, or 
nicotine within [ADDRESS_390556] 5 minutes prior to collecting the ECG.
In some cases, it may  be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead 
placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the 
same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings. 
Electrocardiogram recording, including a 10 second rhy thm strip, will be obtained approximately  
2minutes to 4 minutes apart for all assessments. The recordings should be immediately  assessed 
and if not valid, should be re peated in order to obtain a valid recording.
If QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG should be repeated 2 more times and the average of the 
3 QTc values and the average of other triplicate ECG measurements should be used and recorded 
in the CRF. I nvalid recording s will not be entered in the CRF.
To ensure safet y of the subjects, a qualified individual at the investigator site will make 
comparisons to baseline measurements.
If the QTcF interval (calculated online on site) is increased b y >45 msec from the baseline, or an 
absolute QTcF value is >500 msec for an y scheduled ECG, then 2 additional ECGs will be 
collected, approximately  2 minutes to 4 minutes apart, to confirm the original measurement. If 
either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above th e threshold value 
(>45 msec from the baseline; or is >500 msec), then a single ECG must be repeated at least 
hourly  until QTcF values from [ADDRESS_390557] follow -up ECGs.
If QTcF values remain above 500 msec (or >45 msec from the baseline) for >4 hours (or sooner 
at the discretion of the investigator); or QTcF in tervals get progressively  longer, the subject 
should undergo continuous ECG monitoring. A cardiologist should be consulted if QTcF 
intervals do not return to <500 msec (or to <45 msec above the baseline) after 8 hours of 
monitoring (or sooner at the discre tion of the investigator).

If a machine -read QTcF value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may  not be 
necessary  if a qualified phy sician’s interpretation determines that the QTcF values are in the 
acceptable range.
[IP_ADDRESS] Clinical Laboratory Test s

8. DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL METHODS
8.1 Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by  [CONTACT_317360] . A study  
monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the CRF data 
against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies between source data and 
data entered on the CRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy  
warrants correction, the correction will be made by  [CONTACT_1747]. Data collection 
procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s 
meeting. It is expected that site personnel will complete the CRF entry  within approximately  
3business day s of the subject’s visit.
8.2 Clinical Data Management
Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management plan. 
Quality  contr ol and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity  and accuracy  of 
the clinical database.
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are 
to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to 
the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner.
8.3 Data Handling
Not applicable to this study .
8.4 Statistical Analysis Process 
The study  will be anal yzed by  [CONTACT_10196].
The Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the PK and safety  data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for 
summarizing other study  information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline 
characteristics, IP exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. The SAP will also include a 
description of how missing, unused and spurious d ata will be addressed. 
To preserve the integrit y of the statistical anal ysis and study  conclusions, the SAP will be 
finalized prior to database lock.
All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS(SAS I nstitute, Cary , NC [ZIP_CODE]). 
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_390562] signed informed consent and a lso passed 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.
The Safety Set will consist of all subjects who receive an y amount of IP. Analy sis will be 
performed according to the treatment regimen actually received regardless of the randomized 
treatment regimen.
The Pharmacokinetic ( PK) Set will consist of subjects who receive at least [ADDRESS_390563]-dose maribavir PK data (defined as complete concentration- time profile 
to obtain meaningful estimates of PK parameters). The PK anal yses wil l be based on this 
analysis population.
Subjects who do not provide reliable concentration
-time profile (in 1 or more periods) may  be 
excluded from PK anal ysis (for the corresponding treatment period). 
8.7 Pharmacokinetic Analyses
8.7.1 Pharmacokinetic Endpoint(s)
A PK evaluation of maribavir concentrations and  will be performed 
based on the PK Set. Pharmacokinetics parameters will be estimated for maribavir and  
following the administration of maribavir [ADDRESS_390564], and AUC 0-infwill be the primary  endpoints.  
PK parameters will include, but not be limited to the follow ing:
Cmax Maximum observed plasma concentration 
tmax Time of maximum observed concentration sampled during a 
dosing interval
AUC last Area under the curve from the time of dosing to the last 
measurable concentration
AUC 0-infArea under the curve extrapola ted to infinity , calculated using the 
observed value of the last non- zero concentration

In addition, dose- normalized (to 400 mg) AUC last, AUC 0-inf, and C maxwill be calculated for 
Japanese subjects. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters
Mari bavir C max, AUC last, and AUC 0-infwill be the primary  endpoints.  
 Individual concentrations and PK parameters (including 
dose-normalized) of maribavir and  will be listed and summarized by  [CONTACT_317361] r dose 
with descriptive statistics (number, arithmetic mean, standard deviation [SD], coefficient of 
variation [CV], median, minimum, maximum, geometric mean, and percent coefficient of 
variation (CV%) of geometric mean. The 95% CIs of the geometric means of Cmax, AUC last, and 
AUC 0-infparameters will be presented as well. Figures of individual and mean (±SD) maribavir 
concentration -
time profiles will be generated on linear and semi- log scales. The mean 
concentration -time profiles will be generated and display ed by [CONTACT_317362] -Hispanic Caucasian cohort. Figures of PK parameters and dose -normalized PK 
parameters vs. dose in Japanese subjects will be generated. Box -Whisker plots for selected PK 
parameter will be generated with Japanese cohort and Non -Hispanic Caucasian side by  [CONTACT_10167].  
In order to compare the PKs of maribavir between subjects of Japanese descent and matched 
non-Hispanic, Caucasian subjects, the differences of log -transformed PK parameters (AUC last, 
AUC 0-inf, and C max) from the maribavir 400 mg oral dose will be examined between cohorts 
using an anal ysis of variance model. The geometric mean ratio and its 90% CI  of PK parameters 
for Japanese descent vs. Caucasian will be provided from the model. In addition, the difference 
of log -transformed dose -normalized AUC last, AUC 0-inf, and C maxwill be examined between the 
Japanese cohort estimated at the 200 mg dose and the Non-
Hispanic Caucasian cohort estimated 
at the 400 mg dose, as well as between the Japanese cohort estimated at the 800 mg dose and the 
Non-Hispanic Caucasian cohort estimated at 400 mg dose, using an anal ysis of variance model. 
The geometric mean ratio and its 90% CI  will be provided from the model. Forest plots of 
geometric mean ratios for selected PK parameters between Japanese cohort vs. the Non- Hispanic 
Caucasian cohort at [ADDRESS_390565], AEs leading to withdrawa l, SAEs, 
and deaths will be similarly  summarized/listed.
8.9 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations 
The sample size consideration for the primary  objective of evaluating the PK profile of 
maribavir, administered as a single oral dose at 400 mg, betw een Japanese subjects and matched, 
healthy , adult, non -Hispanic, Caucasian subjects is based on feasibility  and comparable studies . 
A total of 24 subjects (12 subjects of Japanese descent and 12 matched, non -Hispanic, Caucasian 
subjects) will be targeted to be enrolled in the study .

Study Results / Publication Policy
The term “Publication” shall mean an y paper, article, manuscript, report, poster, internet posting, 
presen tation slides, abstract, outline, video, instructional material, presentation (in the form of a 
written summary ), or other public disclosure of the study  results, in printed, electronic, oral, or 
other form. The parties understand and agree that participat ion in the study  may  involve a 
commitment to publish the data from all sites participating in the study  in a cooperative 
publication with other investigators prior to publication or oral presentations of the study  results 
on an individual basis. The site a grees not to publish or present the site’s study  results until such 
time as either the aggregate multi- site study  results are published in a cooperative publication or 
for a period of one (1) year after termination or completion of the study  at all partici pating sites, 
whichever shall first occur. After that time, the site may  publish the site’s study  results in 
scientific journals or present the study  results at symposia or other professional meetings in 
accordance with the following provisions:
If the study  is part of a multicenter study , the first publication of the study  results shall be made 
by [CONTACT_10208]’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication 
of the compi[INVESTIGATOR_10163]. If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to a 
journal for publication by  [CONTACT_10209] 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, 
or termination of the study
 at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no multicenter 
study  publication of the study  results, an investigator may individuall y publish the study results 
from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, however, 
acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the single site data being presented.
At le ast sixty  (60) day s prior to submitting an abstract, manuscript, or other document for 
publication, a cop y of the proposed publication will be provided to the sponsor by [CONTACT_49134]. Upon the sponsor’s request, the site agrees to remove an y and all confidential 
information (expressly  excluding study  results) identified in the publication and to delay  such 
submission or presentation for an additional sixty  (60) day  period in order to allow the sponsor 
time to file any  patent application(s). All publi cations of the study  results shall appropriatel y 
reference the multi- site study  publication, if an y, or the fact that the study results are a subset of 
data resulting from a larger multi- site study .
Shire is committed to transparent dissemination of all scientific, technical and medical 
manuscripts generated from Shire -supported research. Therefore, after January  1, 2018, Shire 
will require the submission of all Shire-supported research manuscripts to journals that offer 
public availability  via Open Access (including publisher platforms/repositories and 
self-archiving). Open Access refers to the free at point of entry , online availability  of published 
research output with, where available, rights of re- use according to an End User License.
Unless otherwise required by  [CONTACT_10210], or the forum in which 
it is made, authorship will comply  with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 
(ICMJE) Recommendation for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarl y 
Work in Medical journals. Participation as an investigator does not confer any rights to

Appendix 2 Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and R eporting
Appendix 2.[ADDRESS_390574]. A n AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporall y associated with the use of a 
medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational)
product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995).
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event
A TEAE is defined as any event emerging or manifesting at or after the initiation of treatment 
with an I P or medicinal product or any  existing event that worsens in either intensity  or 
frequency  following exposure to the IP or medicinal product. 
Serious A dverse Event 
An SAE is any  untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to I P or not) that 
at an y dose:
 Results in death
 Is life -threatening. Note: The term ‘life-
threatening’ in the definition of “serious” 
refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it 
does not refer to an event which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it was 
more severe.
 Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]. Note: 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602] , that are the result of elective or previously scheduled investigations 
procedures or surgery  for pre -existing conditions andhave not worsened after 
initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission 
for a previously  scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; 
however, complication(s) resulting from a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_49108](s) serious criteria must be reported as 
SAE(s).
 Results in persistent or sig nificant disability /incapacity
 Results in a congenital abnormality /birth defect
 Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in 
death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317341], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject 
and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed 
in this definition. Examples of such medical events include bronchospasm associated 
with anaph ylaxisrequiring intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home; 
blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or the 
development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 75
TAK -620-1020 Protocol Amendment 1
Maribavir 08 Jul 2020
Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity , specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the IB. “Unexpected” also refers 
to the AEs that are mentioned in the maribavir IB and/or prescribing information as occurring 
with a c lass of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product, but are 
not specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation. 
The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using the IB and/or prescribing 
information as the Reference Safet y Information. This determination will include considerations 
such as the number of AEs previously  observed, but not on the basis of what might be 
anticipated from the pharmacological properties of a produc t.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (S[LOCATION_003]R) is defined as any  suspected 
adverse reaction to study  treatment (ie, including active comparators) that is both serious and 
unexpected. 
The event(s) must meet all of the following:
 Suspected adverse reaction
 Serious
 Unexpected
 Assessed as related to study  treatment
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect 
An unanticipated adverse device effect is an y serious adverse effect on health or safet y or an y 
life-threatening problem or death caused by , or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously  identified in nature, severit y, or degree of incidence in the stud y 
protocol or product labeling; or an y other unanticipated ser ious problem associated with a device 
that relates to the rights, safet y, or welfare of subjects.
Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory  parameter, vital sign measure, or ECG assessment 
can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during administration of I P, a shift 
of a parameter is observed from a value in the normative range to a value that is outside the 
normal range and considered clinically  significant, or a further waning of an alread y clinically  
significant value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference 
range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing administration or 
after the end of administration with the I P, and the range of variation of the respective parameter 
within its reference range, should also be considered.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 76
TAK -620-1020 Protocol Amendment 1
Maribavir 08 Jul 2020
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory  (such as hematology  
panel or clinical chemistry  panel), vital sign, or ECG values which were not present at the 
pretreatment evaluation observed closest to the start of study  treatment, further investigations 
should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible 
explanation (eg, c oncomitant disease or expected disease evolution) is found for the abnormal 
values.
The investigator should assess, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of the 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory  value, vital sign, or ECG p arameter is clinicall y 
significant and represents an AE.
Appendix 2.2 Collection of Adverse Events
All AEs /SAEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined 
follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4. This includes events occu rring during the screening 
phase of the stud y, regardless of whether or not IP is administered. 
All AEs/SAEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline 
status or all variables have returned to baseline), regardless of whether the subject is still 
participating in the stud y. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved 
(the investigator does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or the 
event is otherwise explained.
Appe ndix 2.[ADDRESS_390575] dose of a new AE of severe 
dyspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be documented in the source.
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by [INVESTIGATOR_1477]:
Mild : A type of AE that is usually transient and may  require only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual 
activities of daily  living.
Moderate :A type of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses 
no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe : A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily  living, or significantl y affects 
clinical statu s, or may  require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 77
TAK -620-1020 Protocol Amendment 1
Maribavir 08 Jul 2020
Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to I P for each AE. The 
investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reason able 
possibility  that the event may  have been caused by [CONTACT_941] I P. If there is no valid reason for 
suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, if there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for sus pecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the IP and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered 
“related”. The causalit y assessment must be documented in the source.
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the IP is 
compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and 
the event cannot be explained by [CONTACT_423]’s medical con dition, other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], or 
accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by [CONTACT_1605]’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the IP and the event.
Outcome Categorization
The outcome of AEs must be recorded in the source during the course of the study . Outcomes are 
as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered/Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae
Recovering/Resolvi ng
Unknown.
If applicable, action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, 
drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. 
Appendix 2.[ADDRESS_390576] be reported by  [CONTACT_317365], the CRO, and Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event. Note: The 24- hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports 
of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors ( Appendix 2.9) unless they result in an SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire “Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
for SAEs and Non -serious AEs as Required by  [CONTACT_1738]” Form and verify  the accuracy  of the 
info
rmation recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source 
documents are not to be sent unless requested), and fax or e- mail the form to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet y Department. A cop y of the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Eve nt Form for 
SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol (and an y applicable follow -up reports) must 
also be sent to the CRO and Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency  
contact [CONTACT_1739].
Appendix 2.5 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to IP) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.4, and must be reported 
to the Shire Globa l Drug Safety Department and the CRO and Shire Medical Monitor within 
24hours of the first awareness of the event.
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related” to the I P and discovered by  [CONTACT_317366] y has completed must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safet y
Department within [ADDRESS_390577]’s death ( eg, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page [ADDRESS_390578]’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another IP action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action 
taken with the I P should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject 
never received IP or it is a single dose study ). The IP action of wit hdrawn should not be selected

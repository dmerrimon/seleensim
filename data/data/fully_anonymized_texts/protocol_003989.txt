This will include completing a knowledge and practice survey, watching a short video, and completing a video perception survey at baseline.  In addition, they will be asked to complete a short survey  during their next well-child visit (if they attend Hughes Spalding clinic for this), and by [CONTACT_838083] 5 months later. (PHI in the form of first name [CONTACT_838095]). 
In addition, clinic staff will be interviewed about their

2. Objectives
The primary objective of the study is to assess the impact of using targeted, age-specific videos during well-child visits on parents’ 
knowledge of SCB recommendations for infants and their compliance with related early SCB feeding recommendations when feeding their infant. The secondary objectives are to determine if educational videos focused on reducing the consumption of SCBs in infancy:
•Can be effectively incorporated into routine practice.
•Increases the frequency and quality of the SCB-related reduction education and counseling provided to parents during well-child visits.
Our hypothesis is that incorporating a ~3 min video for parents about SCB consumption for infants during well-child visits will increase parents’ knowledge of SCB recommendations for infants and decrease the prevalence of consumption of SCBs in infancy.
3. Background
The prevalence of Type [ADDRESS_1164113] risen markedly among children in the [LOCATION_002] . 
While previously so rare in children it was referred to as "adult onset diabetes", the prevalence of Type 2 diabetes among 10-1 9 
years olds has increased by 30% since [ADDRESS_1164114] been shown to be 
linked to an increased risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_838071], including diabetes.  This highlights the critical need for 
interventions in early childhood that promote the development and sustainment of risk-reducing lifestyle practices.
High consumption of non-milk sugars, particularly those consumed in beverages, is well-recognized as a risk factor for diabetes , 
obesity, and related diseases2,3.  U.S. Dietary Guidelines advise that the consumption of added sugars, those added to foods and 
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project
Page 8 of 19 Protocol Version 2; 04/30/21
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
beverages as a part of their processing or preparation, be limited to less than 10% of total energy intake4. The World Health 
Organization (WHO) goes further, including the naturally occurring sugars in fruit juice (which are similar in type and quantit y to 
those in sugar-sweetened beverages) in this limit, and referring to them all together as "free sugars"5. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_838072], the most common reason cited by [CONTACT_838084] <5 year s 
fruit juice was, "because [fruit juices] are healthy" (56% of respondents)6.
We've previously shown that, in the [LOCATION_002], excess "free sugar" intake begins in infancy7 when fruit juice and other sugary 
foods and beverage are often first introduced, despi[INVESTIGATOR_838073] (AAP) and others  
against this early introduction  8-11. Nearly one-half (48%) of infants age 6-11 months consume fruit juice12. By [CONTACT_654] 2 years, mean free 
sugar consumption exceeds the WHO recommended limit7. Our recent analysis of data from over 6,000 children in the U.K. 
demonstrated that children who consumed (non-milk) sugar-containing beverages (SCBs) in infancy were more likely than non-
consumers to be overweight or obese at ages 9 years (27% vs 24%, p<0.05) and have more dual x ray absorptiometry (DXA)-measured body fat, (7237g vs. 6962 g, p=0.05). These findings support those from earlier studies showing an association between SCB consumption in infancy and higher obesity and diabetes risk later in childhood
13,14,15. 
Physicians are parents most trusted source of nutrition and health information16,17 and nearly all children 0-5 years (88%) attended 
regular well-child visits18. Therefore, pediatric healthcare providers are well-positioned to guide and support parents to adopt 
health-promoting early feeding practices.  Unfortunately, their effectiveness in this role is limited due to a lack of training  in 
nutrition and recommended early feeding practices19-21.  In addition, the competing demands on the pediatric primary healthcare 
systems leave providers little time in which to do effective patient education and counseling22. Easy-to-use strategies and tools that 
can be integrated into routine well-child visits are needed to ensure that evidence-based early feeding messages are consistent ly 
and effectively communicated to parents and other caregivers.  
Videos have previously been shown to be a low-cost and effective way of conveying key educational message to a variety of 
audiences23.  Our recent 3-month pi[INVESTIGATOR_9985] a large pediatric primary care clinic demonstrated that the viewing of a short 
educational video (on a variety of topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102]) during each well-child visit, newborn to age 3, was well-received by [CONTACT_838085].  Nearly all (98%) parents who completed a post-video survey (n=67) reported that they liked it, 88% reported that viewing it while waiting to see the doctor was a good use of their time
24, and healthcare team 
collaborators valued them so much they requested to continue using them after the pi[INVESTIGATOR_838074].  Building upon this work, the goal of the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_838075], age-specific videos during well-child visits as a tool for increasing parent compliance with feeding practices that promote a reduction in children's SCB 
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project
Page 9 of 19 Protocol Version 2; 04/30/[ADDRESS_1164115] of a comprehensive program desig ned to 
strengthen the early feeding/diabetes prevention related education and counseling provided by [CONTACT_838086].   
The program to be tested will center around an on-going, evidence-informed program25,26 which will, dependent on the results of 
this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], be expanded to include the use of videos.
4. Study Endpoints
The primary outcome will be the percentage of parents who a) are aware of infant fruit juice consumption recommendations 
and b) who report that they do not give their young children fruit juice.
Secondary outcomes will include 1) the percentage of clinic staff who report that the SCB consumption related videos were 
easy to incorporate into the flow of clinic operations and 2)  the percentage of parents who viewed an intervention video report that they enjoyed it or learned something from it
We will also explore to determine if viewing the short (3-4 minute) educational videos on recommended infant feeding practices 
played during well-child visits have an impact on other (non SCB-related) infant feeding practices .
No risks to study participation are anticipated.
5. Study Intervention / Design
The main study will involve:
1) parents viewing a ~3-minute video during routine 4-month or 12-month well-child visits and completing a survey
about their perception of the video afterwards.  The control group will view an educational video about a topic other than infant SCB consumption. This will be done in the first months of the study.  The intervention group will include those parents who participate in the study after the control data has been collected and two SCB reduction-related videos have been introduced (one for showing at the 4-month visit and one for the 12-month visit). 
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project
Page 10 of 19 Protocol Version 2; 04/30/21
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
2) parents attending a 6-month or 15-month well- child visit will be asked to complete a survey to assess infant
feeding practices.
A sub-sample of parents who consent to participate in a long-term follow-up component of the study will complete a child feeding knowledge and behavior survey at the enrollment clinic visit (4-month or 12-month well-child visit).  In addition, they will view a short video (~ 3 minutes) and answer a few questions about their perception of the videos.  They will be asked to complete another knowledge and behavior survey at their child’s next well-child visit at 6 and 15-months, and by e-mail 4-5 months after enrollment.  The control group will be comprised of parents enrolled prior to the introduction of the intervention videos.
In addition, clinic staff involved in providing well-child care will be invited to participate in key informant interviews to l earn 
from them how they how they perceived the process of integrating the videos into practice, the parent response to the 
videos, and whether or not they perceive them to be a valuable tool.
6. Procedures Involved
The intervention centers around the use of short educational videos to 1) improve and increase the SCB reduction related educat ion 
and counseling provided by [CONTACT_838087]-child visits, 2) reduce the feeding practices of parents  of 
infants and young children that promote SCB consumption, and 3) reduce the proportion of infants and young children that 
consume SCBs.  As no suitable existing videos have been identified, two videos will be developed, one to be viewed by [CONTACT_838088]'s [ADDRESS_1164116] parents begin to introduce complementary foods, including fruit juices and other SCB, around age 4-6 months
27, and the 
intake of juice and other sugary drinks and foods is known to rise sharply during a child's second year7.
After escorting parents/children to the patient exam room the parent will be asked if they would like to participate in the study which involves:
Main study
1. For parents attending a 4-month or 12-month well child visit: viewing a video and answering a few short questions about it. T hese
parents will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1164117] for their participation.
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project
Page 11 of 19 Protocol Version 2; 04/30/21
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
2. For parent attending a 6-month, 9-month or 15-month well-child visit: completing a survey on child feeding and related knowledge
and practices.  These parents will be offered a $[ADDRESS_1164118] for their participation.
Sub-study
In addition, a subsample of the above parents will be invited to participate in a long-term follow-up study which will include completion of a knowledge and practice survey, watching a video and completing a short survey about the video upon enrollment, completing a knowledge and practices survey at their child’s subsequent well-child visit, and another survey four to 5 months l ater by 
[CONTACT_838089]..  A $[ADDRESS_1164119] will be offered (electronically) to those who successful completion of the final follow-up (e-mail) 
survey.
Parents will be asked to view the video on an available computer or using a dedicated electronic tablet, while they await the 
physician. After viewing the video, a digital prompt will ask parents to complete the Perceptions of the Video survey. When the 
physician enters the room, the physician will then, as part of their interview and assessment, reinforce the video's key messag es and 
inquire as to any questions. Face-to-face interaction such as this has been shown to increase the effectiveness of videos as a health education tool
23.
The video content will be developed in collaboration with a registered dietitian with extensive experience developi[INVESTIGATOR_838076].  Content development will be guided by [CONTACT_838090] a health-related behavior if they believe that (1) a negative health condition can be avoided, (2) a recommended action is available to avoid a negative health condition, and (3) they have the ability to take a recommended health action
28.
The Knowledge and Behavior survey will ask parents (mostly) close-ended questions about their child feeding practices and 
their knowledge of SCB recommendations for infants and the feeding practices of their child. The Perceptions of the Video 
survey will ask parents about how informative they thought the video was and their enjoyment with the video (close-ended questions on a 5 item Likert-type scale from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”).  Responses to both surveys will be gathered through RedCap and results in electronic database of responses.
At the completion of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080], key Informant Interviews will be done with participating clinic staff as part of a grou p 
de-briefing or through one-on-one interviews, as needed.  These will range from 5-[ADDRESS_1164120] on parents.
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project
Page 12 of 19 Protocol Version 2; 04/30/[ADDRESS_1164121] information (name [CONTACT_91985]) will be collected, 
but study IDs will be assigned to participants and identifying information will be saved on a password protected computer that is only accessible to the research team. RedCap secure data management system maintained by [CONTACT_838091], will be password protected and will only be accessible to the study team.
Risks to the clinic staff participating in the study include loss of productivity while they are working. To minimize this risk , 
staff will have the option to participate or not based on their schedule and can spend much less than the 45 minutes 
participating if they wish to do so.
Describe:
•Project data will be collected using self-administered surveys (parents) and interviews (clinic staff).  Data to be collected
include information on child feeding related knowledge and practices and perceptions of the videos (parents) andperceptions of the videos and their impact on clinic practice (clinic staff)
•A small subsample will be followed until the end of the study period to longitudinally assess their experience with and percept ion
of the videos and the possible impact of the videos on their knowledge and practices.
7. Data and Specimen Banking
At the conclusion of the study, all data will be destroyed. Study data will not be related to anyone outside of the research gr oup.
8. Sharing of Results with ParticipantsResults will not be shared with participant.
9. Study Timelines
A detailed description of activities for the 12 months study can be found in Appendix A.

Inclusion criteria for participants includes
1) Being over 18 years of age, AND2) Being a parent/caregiver of a child age 4-15 months, AND2) Attending a well-child visit at the collaborating pediatric primary care clinic  and planning to continue during the pi[INVESTIGATOR_838077].
Exclusion criteria includes
1) Parents/caregivers with cognitive or behavioral limitations that preclude completion of the survey2) Parents/caregivers of children with conditions that require special feeding protocols, e.g. tube feedings, high calorie suppl ements
3) Parent/caregivers who are not able to communicate in English
We will not be targeting a specific community or racial/ethnic group in this study.11. Local Number of ParticipantsThe total number of participants for the study will be 50-[ADDRESS_1164123] 44 parents (22 parents in each of the two groups). The long-term follow-up participants are a subsample of the 44 parents  and 
will include 20 parents (10 from each of the two groups). For the clinic staff interviews, 6-[ADDRESS_1164124] 
information will be collected then.  This will be conveyed to the research team who will follow up to do an informed consent.  The 
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project
Page 14 of 19 Protocol Version 2; 04/30/21
IRB Form SOCIOB 08102020
parents will be provided a $[ADDRESS_1164125] access.
A potential risk for clinic staff in participating in the study is loss of productivity while working at the clinic. Loss of productivity will 
by [CONTACT_838092], they will decide how much time th ey would 
like to be engaged (from 5 to 45 minutes).
We do not anticipate any unforeseeable risks to study participants.
15. Potential Benefits to Participants
There will be no direct benefits to parent participants other than the possibility of increased knowledge regarding healthy chi ld 
feeding which could result in improved practices with their child. The benefit to clinic staff will be in knowing that they con tributed 
to efforts to improve patient care and clinic work flow and the food we provide to them at the clinic to thank them for their t ime.
The parents in the long-term follow-up subsample will be compensated for their time via a $[ADDRESS_1164126] for completion o f the 
final survey.  These will be sent electronically following the completion of the surveys.
16. Data Analysis, Management and Confidentiality
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project
Page 15 of 19 Protocol Version 2; 04/30/[ADDRESS_1164127] protected computer.
Sample size.  Previous studies estimate that 47.7% (SD=3.2) of children age 6-11 months drink 100% fruit juice.  Fewer, 13.6% 
(SD=2.0) drink sugar-sweetened beverages12. We determined that a sample size of 44 per group will provide 80% power to detect a 
significant difference (p<0.05) if the prevalence of SCB consumption is 48% among infants in the control group and 20% among 
those in the post-intervention group.  Participation of 49 parents in the intervention group will allow for a final sample of 4 4 
assuming a 10% drop-out. 
Data analysis.  Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample and to compare the SCB-related knowledge, perception s and 
practices of parents who received the intervention compared to those who did not. Chi-squared tests will be used to compare the  
prevalence of SCB-related practices between the control group and the intervention group. Any demographic differences between t he 
pre and post cohorts will be assessed and controlled for using stratified analyses or multivariate models.  A p-value of 0.05 w ill be 
used to determine statistical significance.  All statistical analysis will be conducted using SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC). Key themes ar ising from 
the discussions with key informants will be summarized.
To minimize any risk of misuse of personal data, a participant ID will be assigned upon enrollment. No names, addresses or othe r 
potentially identifying information will be collected and used for any purpose with the exception of the first names and email 
addresses that will be used to do the follow-up survey of those who volunteer to participate in the subsample among whom a long-term follow-up survey will be done. Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_838078] a participant to their study ID.  This inform ation will 
be stored on the Emory Pediatrics file server protected with encrypted passwords and kept printed in a locked office.    
17. Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Participants
Given the low-risk involved in this study, a provision for safety monitoring will not be established. 
18. Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Participants and Confidentiality of Participants’ identifiable data
No personal information will be collected from the majority of study participants.  PHI will be collected only from those who 
consent to participating in the long-term follow-up study and that will include only first name [CONTACT_102600].  A study ID will be used to refer to these participants and only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_838079] a participant's na me.
Protocol Title : Well-Child Visit Video Project

Electronic data collected at the clinic will be transmitted via secure email to the research team.   Data will be stored on the 
RedCap secure data storage system.
19. Economic Burden to Participants
There is no expected economic burden of this study to participants.
20. Consent Process
For the three different components, the plan for consenting is as follows:1. Main study: a waiver of written consent is being requested.  Participants will be provided a one-page handout outlining
the purpose of the study, what it entails, and who to contact [CONTACT_710983].  This information will also be available as 
part of the introduction to the study survey.
2. Long-term follow-up subsample.  A waiver of written consent is being requested.  Participants will be provided the
opportunity to read the consent information electronically before deciding (and indicating) whether or not they will participate.  In addition, a one-page handout outlining the purpose of the study, what it entails, and who to contact [CONTACT_838093].
3. Clinic team/key informant interviews.  Informed consent will be obtained by [CONTACT_838094].  A waiver of written consent is requested.
21. Setting
This study will take place at the Hughes Spalding primary care clinic.   Participants will be recruited as part of regular well -child visit 
care.
22. Resources Available
As the all components of the main study are designed to be integrated into usual care, clinic staff will introduce the videos a nd 
requested parents to complete the survey questions.  The research team will oversee the data collection from those participatin g in 
the long-term follow-up by [CONTACT_6968].  All members of the research team will have a current CITI certification.

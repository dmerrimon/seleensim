 Study Protocol : Effectiveness and safety of Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) in 
HIV-1 infected patients with Active illicit Substance usE (BASE)  
 
Investigators: Josh Havens, Sara Bares, Anthony Podany, Kim Scarsi, Nada Fadul, Susan Swindells  
 
NCT: 03998176  
 
Hypothesis : People living with HIV ( PWH ) that use illicit substances  receiving B/F/TAF will have  virologic 
suppression  similar to PWH  that do not use illicit substances  receiving B/F/TAF  without safety concerns 
or treatment emergent resistance   
 
Abstract:  
 
Description:  
Illicit substance use is a growing con cern across the [LOCATION_002] and has been linked to HIV outbreaks 
and viral hepatitis.  Close to half of people living with HIV (PWH) struggle with a substance use disorder 
often leading to non -adherence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) increasing the risk of poor treatment 
outcomes and potential HIV transmission.  Appropriate choice of ART for PWH who use illicit substances 
is unknown.  Boosted protease inhibitor reg imens are utilized for their high genetic barrier to resistance, 
however, concerns for drug -drug interactions with illicit substances are present.  The clinical utility of an 
integrase strand inhibitor  (INI)  based regimen is unknown.  We aim to assess the effectiveness and 
safety of bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in PWH who actively use illicit substances.  
 
Eligibility : 
Eligible participants for the study will be HIV -1 infected patients at the Specialty Care Center with HIV 
viremia >  1000 c opi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL and ongoing substance use by [CONTACT_714150] -reported within  [ADDRESS_972486] a creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or greater, no tenofovir or INI 
HIV resistance mutations, and not be pregnant.  Illicit substances wi ll include: methamphetamine, 
heroin, cocaine, PCP, GHB, ketamine, or inappropriate benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_2573], or 
prescription stimulant usage.  
 
Interventions/Evaluations : 
This is a single -center, single -arm, prospective, pi[INVESTIGATOR_714133] 
B/F/TAF in PWH and active illicit substance use.  We aim to evaluate the proportion of patients at week 
24 with undetectable viral loads (<50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL).  We plan to enroll 45 participants.  
Secondary/exploratory endpoints in clude the proportion with undetectable viral loads at week 48, 
proportion with emergent drug resistance, change in CD4 counts, and evaluation retention in care.  
Substance use throughout the study will be evaluated by [CONTACT_714151] -ASSIST questionnaire .  
Adherence will be evaluated by [CONTACT_714152]/percentage of days covered, ACTG Self -Report Adherence 
questionnaire, and FTC -TP and TDF -DP levels by [CONTACT_269968].  
 
Follow -up: 
Participants will be followed up at weeks 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48. Participants will be compensated for 
visits completed at $20 per hour.

Brief Description:   Illicit substance use in the [LOCATION_002] is a growing concern across all states.  Use of 
illicit drugs such as  cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_714134], and 3,4-
methylenedioxy -methamphetamine (Ecstacy, MDMA ) among others,  has r emained steady in many parts 
of the [LOCATION_002] [ 1].  In 2017, 6 % of new HIV infections occurred in people who injected drugs and 
3% were in gay/bisexual men who injected drugs [2]. Furthermore , injection of illicit drugs has been 
linked to outbreaks of HIV and viral hepatitis acquisition  [3].   
 
Of the 1.2 million PWH  in the US , an estimated 48% struggles with a  substance use disorder  [4].  Poor 
antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and inconsistencies in  retention in HIV care has been observed 
among PWH  that use illicit drugs .  Gaps in ART coverage and lack of retention to HIV care are factors 
that complicate successfully managing PWH  who use illicit drugs , often leading to poor treatment 
outcomes and increased HIV transmission  [5-7].  As a result, ART choice in these patients can prove 
challenging and often require s the selection of an ART regimen with a high genetic barrier to resistance  
such as  protease inhibitor  based ART  [8-10].  Yet, concerns of d rug-drug interactions between illicit 
drugs and  ART regimens containing a  protease inhibitor  and/or a pharmacokineti c enhancer have  been 
raise d [11,12 ].  Integrase strand inhibitor (INSTI) based ART regimens are now the primary treatment 
option for most PLWH in the US  [8].  B/F/TAF is the newest  INSTI  based regimen available as a generally 
well-tolerated, single tablet formu latio n that does not require the  need for a pharmacokinetic enhancer  
and is thought to provide a high genetic barrier to resistance .  In clinical trial s among naïve and 
treatment experienced, virologically suppressed patient s, B/F /TAF exhibited  efficacy of 89% to 9 6% 
without any cases of newly emergent treatment resistance  [13-16].  
 
However, little is known about the effectiveness and safety  of B/F/TAF in PWH who actively use illicit 
drugs because such patients are typi[INVESTIGATOR_714135] .  In this study, we aim to evaluate 
the effectiveness and  safety  of B/F/TAF among viremic patients currently using illicit drugs at the 
Nebraska Medicine, Specialty Care Center (SCC) in Omaha, NE .  
 
The SCC clinic manages approximately 1300 PLWH’s H IV care of which 89% is actively engaged in care.  
An estimated 8% to 12% of SCC’s patients uses some form of illicit substance excluding nicotine, alcohol, 
or marijuana on a semi -regular basis.

Methods :   
After obtai ning written informed consent, p rospective  participants will be screened with a clinical 
assessment  (physical  exam) , laboratory testing  (CBC,  CMET, HBV/HCV se rology, CD4, HIV RNA) , and 
substance use evaluation  (NIDA ASSIST ) to evaluate study eligibility.  Eligible patients  may  initiate 
treatment with B/F/TAF  on the same day as the screening visit or start within [ADDRESS_972488] at week 6, 24, and 48 weeks .  Pregnancy testing will be performed 
any time pregnancy is suspected.  Assessment of adverse events, adherence, ongoing substance  use, 
and quality of life will be assessed at each visit.  Adherence measures include pi[INVESTIGATOR_10685],  self-reported 
by [CONTACT_714154] [17] and pharmacokinetic sampling (see 
below).   Ongoing  illicit substance use wi ll be evaluated  quarterly at  week 12, 24, 36, and [ADDRESS_972489] [18].  Referral for substance use counseling and/or outpatient or inpatient treatment will 
be offered.  Additionally, the Short Form 12 survey will be utilized to evaluate quality  of life and patient 
reported outcomes [ 19-21].  See schedule of events table for detail.  
 
Virologic Failure:  
Suspected virol ogic failure will be defined as plasma HIV RNA > 400 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL after week 12 and will be 
confirmed by a repeat measurement with in 28 days.  Participants with conf irmed virologic failure will 
undergo genotype  resistance  testing  using the Genosure Prime assay .  Participants with emergent INI or 
TAF related HIV drug resistance development will undergo ART revision but will continue to be followed 
on study.  
 
Adverse Events:  
Signs and symptoms will be graded according to the DAIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and 
Pediatric Adverse Events [ 22]. All signs and symptoms grade 3 or above or any grade that led to 
treatment discontinu ation, will be recorded on study case report forms  and tracked in the REDCap data 
management     
 
Pharmacokinetic Sampling : 
Blood for PK studies will be collected at three time points while on study, week 6, 24 and 48.  4mL of K2 
EDTA whole blood  will be c ollected via venipuncture for tenofovir -diphosphate  (TDF -DP) and 
 
Version 5; Last Update 9/22/22  
 emtricitabine -triphosphate (FTC -TP) determination at each of the three study visits.  Using a Whatman 
[ADDRESS_972490] (DBS card), [ADDRESS_972491] usi ng a 3 mm punch 
and LC -MS/MS [23 -25]. TDF -DP and FTC -TP represent different elimination half -lives  (TDF -DP: long -term 
- 17 days vs. FTC -TP: short -term - 35 hours) , drug concentration data obtained at these three time points 
will help provide a collective, objective measurement of ART adhere nce both recent and longitudinally.  
 
Patient Compensation : 
Patients with receive a preloaded gift card for visit completion at a rate of $[ADDRESS_972492] visit and 2 hours for each subsequent visit.   
 
Visit Spacing:  
Visit windows for the study will be +/ - 3 weeks for the week 6 visit, +/ - 4 weeks for the week 12 visit, and 
+/- 6 weeks for the weeks 24, 36, and 48 study visits.  
 
Data Management:  
All data collected from study visits will be kept in REDCap , a HIPPA secure database hosted by [CONTACT_714155].  Questionnaires throughout the study will also be imported into 
REDCap.  
 
Study Monitoring/Safety/Futility:  
An investigational monitoring committee (IMC) comprised of an HIV clin ician and HIV pharmacologist 
along with the study team statistician will evaluated study safety, recruitment, and futility twice 
throughout the course of the study.  The first time point for IMC review will occur after the first 15 
participants reach week 24 and with the second time point at end of study  enrollment .   
 
Additionally, the study team will perform internal audits annually to ensure all data is correctly input in 
the data management system, REDCap, and to ensure that all study procedures are bei ng performed as 
planned.  
 
Should a female participant become pregnant during the course of the study, they will be approached 
about enrollment in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry.  The participant will be taken off B/F/TAF and 
changed to a preferred Department of Health and Human Services recommended ART for use during 
pregnancy.  A referral to obstetrics will additionally be placed and they will continue to follow on study 
until completion.

Sample Size Justification:  
The sample size justification is based on the estimation of a confidence interval for a single proportion.  
We are interested in estimating the precision of determining the proportion of PLWH with ongoing illicit 
substance use  on B/F/TAF  with HIV RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at week 24.   It is proposed that this proportion 
could range from .60 to .80 depending on how adherent patients are to the therapy.  It is also uncertain 
how many eligible patients will continue on treatment through we ek 24.    
The table below provided estimates of precision (with 95% confidence) based on the number of patients 
who complete 24 weeks of therapy and the proportion who achieve HIV RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.

This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_714137] (i.e. HIV RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at week 24) of B/F/TAF in PLWH  
with ongoing illicit substance  usage.  A sample size of 30 produces a two -sided 95% confidence interval 
with a width equal to 0.35 when the sample pro portion of patients who achieve HIV RNA <50 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL 
at week 24 is 0.70.   The sample size will be increased to 45 patients to account for an estimated 
attrition of ~ 50%. 
 
Data analysis  [26, 27]: 
Statistical analysis will be performed using GraphPad  Prism, SAS as well as IBM SPSS software. 
Descriptive summaries will be presented using means, medians, standard deviations, and ranges for 
continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables.  Patients achieving HIV 
RNA <50 copi [INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at week 24 will be presented as a proportion and 95% confidence interval. Counts 
and percentages will be used to describe safety assessment, retention and adherence of B/F/TAF in HIV 
infected patients with ongoing illicit substance  usage.  Adherence will also be evaluated with summary 
statistics of drug levels measured in patients at the [ADDRESS_972493] of adherence on the 24 week outcome.

Reported Adherence  
We understand that many people on anti -HIV medications find it very difficult to take them regularly.  
We would like to know HOW MUCH of your anti -HIV medications you have taken DURING THE  
LAST MONTH.  
Please put a cross ( x) on the line b elow at the point showing your best guess about how much of 
your 
anti-HIV medication you have taken in the last month. We would be surprised if this was 100% for  
most people.  
 
For example:  0% means you have taken none of your anti -HIV medication.  
  50% means you have taken half your anti -HIV medication.  
  100% means that you have taken every single dose of your anti -HIV medication in  
  the past month.

Study Protocol :  Engagement in HIV Care and On -going Substance Use: A Qualitative Sub -Study of 
Perspectives from BASE Study Participants  
 
Investigators: Josh Havens, Liam Heerten -Rodriguez, Jason Coleman, Susan Swindells  
 
Objectives:  
We aim to qualitatively examine BASE study participants for their experiences and perspectives of BASE 
study participation impact on engagement in HIV care, treatment adherence, and ongoing 
substance/mental health.  
 
Brief Description:    
Illicit substance use in the [LOCATION_002] is a growing concern across all states.  Use of illicit drugs such as 
cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, prescription opi[INVESTIGATOR_714134], and 3,4-methylenedioxy -
methamphetamine (Ecstacy, MDMA ) among others, has remained steady in many parts of the United 
States1.  Of the 1.2 million PWH in the US, an estimated 48% struggles with a substance use disorder2.  
Poor antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and inconsistencies in retention in HIV care has been 
reporte d among PWH that use illicit drugs  3-5.  Ga ps in ART coverage and lack of retention to HIV care are 
factors that complicate successfully managing PWH who use illicit drugs, often leading to poor 
treatment outcomes and increased HIV transmission6-8.   
 
The BASE study is a single -arm, pi[INVESTIGATOR_714138]/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, B/F/TAF) over a tot al of 48 weeks (NCT 03998176 ).  At 
present, roughly 40% of the allotted [ADDRESS_972513] given consent for BASE study participation with 
the initial participant’s now reaching week 24.  Historically, approximately half of the currently enrolled 
BASE partici pants have remained out of HIV care and struggled with adherence and ongoing substance 
use.  The study team have been surprised to observe that many of these participants are more engaged 
in care and not missing study visits.  Further, the same participant s have reportedly remained adherent 
to antiretroviral therapy for the first time in years, and some have reduced or ceased their substance 
use since study enrollment.   
 
In order to examine the underlying reasons for this behavior change, we propose a qual itative study in 
the form of in -depth, face -to-face interviews with BASE study participants to evaluate the impact of 
BASE study participation on their treatment adherence, motivations for engagement in HIV care, on -
going substance use, mental health, stig ma, and access to the necessary support systems.  
 
Hypothesis:  
 
BASE study participation positively impacted the participant’s treatment adherence, motivations for 
engagement in care for HIV, substance use disorders, and mental health.  
 
Objectives:  
 
1. Primary : Determine BASE participant perspectives on how study participation impacted their 
engagement in HIV care and treatment adherence.  
2. Secondary : Determine BASE participant perspectives on how study participation impacted their 
on-going substance use, mental health, and access to necessary support systems.

Study Design:  
 
Overview  
 
This study will be a prospective qualitative study design with interest in examining patient perspectives 
on the impact of BASE study participation on the following topi[INVESTIGATOR_714139]: treatment adherence, 
motivations for engagement in HIV care, on -going substance use, mental health, stigma, and access to 
the necessary support systems.  We plan to use a semi -structured, in -depth face -to-face interview to 
evaluate the topi[INVESTIGATOR_714140] ( Effectiveness and safety of Bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (B/F/TAF) in 
HIV-1 infected patients wit h Active illicit Substance usE [BASE]; NCT 03998176 ).  The anticipated 
timeframe for in -depth interviews is near the BASE week 48 visit window (42 to 60 weeks).  
 
Sample Size/Justification  
 
A sample size of 10 to 15 participants is typi[INVESTIGATOR_714141] a sufficient amount to develop 
themes withi n a given group.  However, we aim to sample roughly half of the BASE participants (20 -25) 
or until thematic saturation is achieved.

Study Procedures  
 
Recruitment  
 
Research providers (primary investigator or study team provider) who have already had contact [CONTACT_714157] a BASE study visit.  If the participan t is interested in participating in the qualitative 
 
Version 5; Last Update 9/22/[ADDRESS_972514] in -person at the Specialty Care 
Center with a subsequent qualitative study visit scheduled in the future.   
 
All study interactions with  potential or enrolled participants will be conducted in a private room at the 
Specialty Care Center.  
 
Consent Process  
 
Written informed consent will be obtained for all participants wishing to enroll in the qualitative sub -
study.  Written informed consent ing will be conducted by [CONTACT_714158] (primary investigator or 
study team provider) prior to any interviewing procedures.  All consenting will take place at the Specialty 
Care Center in a private room.  All consenting study team members are CITI trai ned and the consenting 
study team member will sign off on the consent.  
 
Study Implementation  
 
After consent has been given, each sub -study participant will be interviewed using a semi -structured, in -
depth interview guide.  The interview guide (Appendix A) contains a listing of open -ended questions 
with subsequent sub -question probes to elicit participant experiences and perspectives regarding each 
core topic.  
 
Topi[INVESTIGATOR_714142] -depth interviews include:  
 
1. Living with HIV  
2. Living with a substance use disorder  
3. Engagement in HIV care  
4. Views and experiences with study participation  
 
 All in -depth interviews will be conducted by a trained interviewer in qualitative research.  Interviews 
will be conducted in English.  All interviews will be aud io-recorded and transcribed by [CONTACT_714159].   
 
Only one in -depth interview will be conducted for each participant.  We expect the interviews to be [ADDRESS_972515] information will be collected and stored on University of

1.PROTOCOL BACKGROUND
1.1 Describe the scientific/scholarly rationale andbackground for your project. Describe the gapsin current knowledge your project is intended to address.
The [LOCATION_002] is in the midst of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_8562]--opi[INVESTIGATOR_443422] (OUPs) are increasingly widespread andlethal. In 2016, more than two million Americans werediagnosed with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (OUD) and morethan42,[ADDRESS_564068] died of an overdose involving opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438](SAMHSA, 2019). The death rate is more than any yearonrecord and has quadrupled since 1999 (Vice Chairman’sStaff of the Joint Economic Committee, 2017.) Severaleffective medications are now available for treatingOUD but many people, who could benefit from medication,
do not receive them (Sarlin, 2018)
 
.
 
 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_443423], onlyabout one in four people (28.6 percent) with thisdisorder received specialty treatment for illicitdrug use in thepast year (Center for Behavioral Health Statisticsand Quality, 2017.) For those struggling with opi[INVESTIGATOR_290991],compared to others dependent on drugs, “the recoveryperiod is longer, and the chance of relapse is higher.”(Wogan, 2017.)  Smith and colleagues (2010) interviewed109 residential addiction treatment patients after
Page1of26

discharge and found over nine in ten patients reported a relapse, with nearly six in ten patients relapsing in firstweek after discharge.
Substance use impairs executive decision making anddepletes defenses against impulse reactivity (Officeof theSurgeon General, 2016), creating challenges for theperson with an OUP to recognize the need for treatmentaswell as navigate the treatment entry process. Havingconcerned significant others, including family members(hereinafter known as CSOs) trained in best-practicesand equipped with effective tools to take actionisgame-changing. Family members have been filling gapsin the substance use disorder (SUD) care continuumfordecades, frequently without recognition from the healthcare system. Cycles of urgent acute care followedby[CONTACT_443458]. To fill this gap, untrained family membersoftenhave no choice but to provide life-sustaining transitionalcare at home. Research shows that family membersmake the majority of the decisions around treatment,including financial decisions (Ventura et al., 2017)andthus, have high potential to impact the trajectoryof their loved one’s OUP for better or worse.
One study showed that social and familial reasonswere the most expressed reasons for entering drugtreatmentand people with substance use disorders perceive treatmententry as an important way to obtain positivecontingencies in their interpersonal relationships,which further underscores the potential utility ofconjointinterventions with CSOs. It also suggested that theinformal pressure of one’s natural social network,of whichCSOs are an integral part, to be influential in improvingtreatment retention and abstinence (Marlowe, D. etal.,1996). Despi[INVESTIGATOR_443424]’engagement along the OUP care continuum and contributetohealth outcomes and mortality rates, family membersremain on the periphery, overlooked by [CONTACT_443459]. Similarly, they are overlookedby [CONTACT_443460]. There has been little innovationin tools toprovide help for family members and friends of anindividual with an OUP (hereinafter known as identified
person or IP). The significance
  
 of this projectis to address this critical gap in OUP treatment by[CONTACT_443461]-based training and tools to CSOs to reducefatal and non-fatal overdoses and to increase treatmentutilization.
Since it has been shown that training a CSO in CRAFTimproves ability to get a treatment-resistant individualintolife-saving treatment, it is highly valuable. Furthermore,new laws around delivering medical assisted treatment(MAT) online via telemedicine provides the proposedproject the opportunity to fill a gap for CSOs usingonlinetechnology to help them increase their treatment resistantIP’s motivation to engage in treatment andconnecting them to treatment online, whether it bebooking a bed or accessing telemedicine and prescriptionsfor MAT. The project team involves We The Village,Inc, a small business already providing support toCSOs usingconsumer technology, [CONTACT_443494], creator ofCRAFT, [CONTACT_443495], research expert in thefield ofsubstance use disorders, [CONTACT_443496], primarycare physician specializing in addiction treatment,andcertified CRAFT coaches. Phase One of this projectwill develop and refine digital delivery of two modifiedCRAFT(Community Reinforcement and Family Training) interventions:automated and Group CRAFT protocol (CRAFT-A)and automated CRAFT protocol with live coaching (CRAFT-C)and assess the effectiveness of the adapted CRAFTprotocols with WTV’s business as usual model of PeerSupport Forum (PEER). The goal of the project isto deliveran innovative and effective evidence-based behavioralintervention with consumer technology to an existingandgrowing online audience.

1.[ADDRESS_564069] the primary and secondary aims, researchquestions, and hypotheses.
Primary Hypothesis:a.At the 3-month post study intake survey, we expectthat CSOs assigned to CRAFT-C will report a greaterproportion of IPs entering treatment as compared tothe CRAFT-A and PEER groups, and the CRAFT-Agroup will report a greater proportion of IPs enteringtreatment as compared to the PEER group.Secondary Hypotheses:b.At the 2-month and 3-month post study intake survey,CSOs in all three groups will report that theirrelationship happi[INVESTIGATOR_443427] (RHS).c.At the 2-month and 3-month post study intake survey,CSOs in all three groups will self-report that theirown anxiety, depression, anger and physical illnesshas improved relative to baseline as measured by[CONTACT_443462], SF12 Health Survey, and the SAS-SR worksubscale.d.At the 2-month and 3-month post study intake survey,CSOs assigned to CRAFT-C and CRAFT-A willdemonstrate higher fidelity of learning CRAFT principlesas compared to the CSOs assigned to thestandard condition (PEER), as measured by [CONTACT_443463].e.At the 3-month post study intake survey, all threegroups will report similar high satisfaction (averagescore above 3.5 on a 5-point scale) on Usability ofthe websiteand the CRAFT-C group will report thegreatest satisfaction in the Usefulness of the websiterelative to the CRAFT-A and PEER groups asmeasured by [CONTACT_443464].
1.[ADDRESS_564070] the primary and secondary outcomes.
The primary outcome variable that will be measuredis the CSO’s reporting their IP entered treatmentfor theirOUP or received additional treatment for their OUP.
Secondary outcome variables that will be measuredinclude CSO and IP relationship happi[INVESTIGATOR_008]; CSO’s physicaland mental health status; CRAFT knowledge of CSOs;and CSO’s satisfaction with website content and delivery.
2.PARTICIPANTS
2.1 Describe the general characteristics of the intendedprimary participant populations,including age range, gender, sexual orientation, racial/ethnicbackground, socioeconomic status,health status, criminal history, and any other characteristicsrelevant to the study.
Proposed initial and primary recruitment strategydrawing from the existing WTV member basewill produce a sample that is representative of thisgroup but not representative of all CSOs of anIP with an OUP. Many CSOs may have drug or mentalhealth problems themselves, distrustmental health services, or are content being distancedfrom their problem-wrought IP (Slesnicket al., 2000). These CSOs often do not seek help andthey are not the target population for this
Page3of26
study. The target population consists of CSOs who are concerned about their loved one’sproblems in general and their opi[INVESTIGATOR_443428],and whose own functioning is notseriously impaired by [CONTACT_443465].  Also, the sample will belimited to CSOs who have internet access and are willingto receive services from web-basedsites.  Although this is not representative of allCSOs of individuals with OUP, it is representativeof those who would use the services being evaluated.
Gender Representation:In past CRAFT studies, thevast majority (anywhere from 75%-90%) ofparticipants are female. Because women are more likelyto seek help (Trudeau et al., 2002), weexpect CSOs in this study sample will continue tobe predominantly female. Because this is anearly stage pi[INVESTIGATOR_346507], we will notconduct targeted recruitment efforts to recruitmale CSOs but in the future this would be possible.
Racial/Ethnic Representation:Given the proposed smallsample size (up to 84 CSOs) for thispi[INVESTIGATOR_346507], we anticipate that wewill not have a sufficient number of minoritiesin any group to do demographic analysis. Still weexpect to have some minority representationin our participants. If we receive an overwhelmingresponse to our recruitment efforts, ifeligible, we will over include individuals in thosegroups to increase representation. Relative tothe racial demographics in the 2017 Census for the[LOCATION_002] (60.7% White, 13.4% Black,5.8% Asian, 18.1% Hispanic or Latino, 1.3% AmericanIndian or Alaska Native, 0.2% NativeHawaiian Other Pacific Islander), if we were to representthis makeup in our study, we mightexpect: 27, 6, 2, 8, 1 participants respectively;we’d expect this distribution adjusted for theonline over-indexing of white participants.
Socio-economic Representation:Given the study isto be implemented completely online usingdigital intervention and data collection methods,we expect the sample to skew with CSOs froma higher SES background. Furthermore, inclusion criteriarequire CSOs to have smart phoneswith data or computers with internet, which may bea barrier for some people with limitedinternet/data plans or CSOs who do not have theirown smart phone or computer. However, thismay not occur given many people across SES levelsdo have their own smartphones andcomputers with internet capability.
While the increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_443429], white, non-Hispanic adultscontinue to experience higher rates of opi[INVESTIGATOR_443430]. According toan analysis of National Vital Statistics by [CONTACT_443466], the overall rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_443431] [ADDRESS_564071] fatal opi[INVESTIGATOR_443432] (19.4 per 100,000 adults)compared to their black and Hispanic counterparts(12.9 & 6.8 per 100,000 persons,respectively). In addition, the rate of opi[INVESTIGATOR_443433] (20.4vs. 9.4 per 100,000 persons, respectively).Persons from a lower SES background, including those“living in poverty, being unemployed andhaving Medicaid,” continue to experience opi[INVESTIGATOR_443434]-off counterparts(Ghertner & Groves, 2018).
We The Village currently does not collect demographicinformation from members; however,anecdotal review of their existing membership foundthe majority were white, female and froma higher SES background. During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], WTVwill collaborate with organizations servinga wider, diverse population, especially communitiesof color and lower SES backgrounds.

1.Does not agree to sign the consent form
2.Is not English-speaking3.Is not able to understand the consent forma.Pass a multiple choice consent quiz (i.e., 100% correctresponses) that tests the participant’scomprehension of basic elements of informed consentand the requirements of the protocoladministered by [CONTACT_176230].b.Participants will be given up to three opportunitiesto pass the consent quiz4.Does not have personal access to a smart phone withdata or a computer with internet to be able toaccess the digital platform for the study conditions,quizzes, questionnaires, and follow-upcommunication5.Reports that they have a drug abuse problem or a historyof drug abuse or dependenceandthat theyhave not been in recovery for at least [ADDRESS_564076] populationgroups.

The study design excludes anyone under 19 years old. The primary hypothesis for the study is to help CSOsincrease treatment utilization among IPs. Childrenare typi[INVESTIGATOR_443436].
While the adult population may include persons age18 years old, the proposed study is excluding potential18-year-old participants because they may still bein high school and not the primary CSO to supporttreatmentdecisions.
3RECRUITMENT AND SCREENING
3.1 Identify the expected number of individuals screenedand the expected number of individualsconsented/enrolled to reach your target sample size.If multi-site, break the total down per studysite. If multi-year, break the total down per studyyear.
For this pi[INVESTIGATOR_443437] 84 CSOs
3.2 Describe how prospective participants will beidentifiedandrecruited. Include informationabout: how, when, where, and by [CONTACT_20898] (by [CONTACT_443467], not by [CONTACT_2300]). Describe anyrecruitment materials that will be used to recruitprospective participants.
As shown in Figure A, we will conduct outreach usingmultiple recruitment methods. We expect the majorityofparticipants may be recruited from the existing 1,500WTV member base, who currently engage in We TheVillage’s peer support online forum; however, we willalso utilize personal WTV member referrals, socialmediaplatforms, print media, and referrals from partnerorganizations. Currently, WTV’s social network outreachcouldpotentially reach 15,000 persons. WTV team (PI, coaches,and staff) will post recruitment ads and flyers ontheWTV website and forum, as well as on other socialmedia platforms. In addition, we will develop partnershipswith providers, who serve diverse populations, includingcommunities of color and lower SES. TheJoinGroups.Com organization goes into underservedrural areas and establishes a health center to addressmedical and behavioral health needs, including in-personsupport groups for people with substance useproblems. The Sixth Street Community Center servesa Latinx population. We will post recruitmentadvertisements on professional counseling member boards,such as the Association of Black Social Workers.Allrecruitment materials will direct interested individualsto the study page, so they can learn more about thestudyand complete an anonymous screening survey.  We willnot collect any identifying information during thescreening process. If someone starts the screeningsurvey but does not finish it, we will not be ableto reach outto them and they will not be included in the screenedcategory. We will track the number of incompletescreenings throughout the pi[INVESTIGATOR_443438]. If theyscreeneligible, they will be directed to click the consentform link. If they screen ineligible, they will bedirected to clicka link to learn more about WTV and joining the businessas usual peer support online forum. They will alsobeprovided the study number if they have any questionsand want to speak to a study staff person. If someonecallsinto the study to be screened over the phone, we willanswer any questions, then refer them to the linklocatedon the study’s landing page to complete screeningand the consent form.
After completing informed consent, participants willbe asked to call the research study phone numbertocomplete a consent quiz and to confirm enrollment.They will have the option of calling the number tospeakwith a study staff person or completing an onlinerequest contact [CONTACT_982]. The brief contact [CONTACT_443468]’s phone number and email address and besttime period to contact [CONTACT_476]. The goal is to speakwithparticipants within one business day after completinginformed consent. These calls will be completed by[CONTACT_443469], including the research assistant, senior projectmanager, and intervention staff, if needed. Duringthe
Page6of26
confirmation call, study staff will administer the brief consent quiz and provide information on next steps, if theparticipant answers 100% of the questions correct.If the person does not answer 100% of the questionscorrectly, the study staff person will review theconsent form with the participant and re-administerthe consentquiz. Participants will have up to three times topass the consent quiz. If they do not pass the thirdtime, they willbe informed that they are not eligible for the study.
After administering the consent quiz during the confirmationcall, study staff will answer questions, review nextsteps, and clarify expectations. If a potential participantdid not pass the consent quiz, study staff will beable toreview the appropriate consent form sections and tore-administer the consent quiz. After completingtheconfirmation call, all eligible study participantswill be considered enrolled into the study. Studystaff will send viaemail secure Survey Gizmo links with the HIPAA authorizationform, locator form and baseline survey. The HIPAAauthorization form will now have an option for “I’mnot sure.” If someone selects the not sure option,they willbe directed to call the study number to discuss theirconcerns or ask questions before moving forward intheenrollment process. Participants must agree to theHIPAA authorization to continue with the study. Afteragreeing to the HIPAA authorization, participantswill click the next step link to complete the locatorform. Aftercompleting the locator form, participants will clicka link to complete the baseline survey. The brieflocator formwill request important contact [CONTACT_443470]-up survey andtore-engage with research and intervention activities,if needed. For participants who report they sharetheir emailaddress with someone else, we will ask them if theyare sure it is okay for us to send information tothis emailaddress. If they say No or Prefer not to answer, theywill be asked if they have a secondary email addresstheywant to use. If someone does not complete the locatorform or baseline survey, study staff will reach outto theparticipants to encourage them to complete these requiredactivities. All participants will have one week tocomplete the enrollment process. Randomization willoccur after completing the baseline survey. We willuseblock randomization to assign a group of three participantsto each condition. We will wait till we have at leastpeople randomized to Program A to begin the program.Participants will be informed of their assigned groupafter completing their baseline survey.  WTV willnotify participants of their randomly assigned programand theappropriate next steps for their specific programassignment. This change will allow us to conduct blockrandomassignment computed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kirby [CONTACT_443471]. We will program Survey Gizmoto send the research team an automatic email whensomeone completes the baseline survey.
When Program A reaches approximately nine participants,we will form the next group assigned to Program A.We will follow-up participants who have incompletedigital data collection that occurs after consentfor up to twotimes.

3.3 Describe how prospective participants will bescreened. Include information about: how,when, where, and by [CONTACT_20898] (by [CONTACT_52891], notby [CONTACT_2300]). Describe any instruments that willbe used or tests that will be performed during thescreening process.
As discussed above, we plan to utilize wide-rangingrequirement strategies to reach our target samplesize. WhileWTV is located in [LOCATION_001] City, participants maylive across the [LOCATION_002]. When a prospectiveparticipantresponds to a recruitment message, flyer or referral,they will be directed to visit the We The VillageFamilySupport study webpage. On the study website, prospectiveparticipants will have the opportunity to read adescription of the study, including goals and expectations.If individuals are still interested, they will bedirectedto click the Screening Survey link. The link willtake them directly to the start of the Screening Survey.TheScreening Survey is a self-administered multiple choiceonline SurveyGizmo tool.
We will program automated scoring to inform participantsimmediately after filling out the screening surveyifthey are eligible, unless their answers are not clearlyeligible or ineligible, such as reporting “othertype of drugused by [CONTACT_443472].” If the results of theirscreening survey are indeterminate, they will receivea message tocall the study number to speak with a study staffperson.
3.[ADDRESS_564078] information on prospective participant’syear of birth, US residency, access to a computeror smartphone, their own substance use disorder diagnosis,type of relationship with IP, frequency of face-to-faceinteractions with their IP, perceptions of their IP’sopi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], IP’s symptoms of opi[INVESTIGATOR_443439],the types ofsubstances used by [CONTACT_431929], current treatment plan fortheir IP, and their ability to commit the time andresources tothe study. All screening data will be de-identifiedand will not be connected to any future data collectionactivities.
3.[ADDRESS_564079] questions.If a prospective participant’s answers do not makethemclearly eligible or ineligible, they will be encouragedto call, or email the study team, most likely theResearchAssistant, for additional information. We will attemptto communicate with participants within one businessday.The Research Assistant will re-screen participantswithout collecting any identifying information todetermineeligibility. If the person is eligible, they willbe re-directed to the study landing page to completethe informedconsent process and re-enter the digital enrollmentflow. This procedure will improve screening ratesandminimize potential eligible participants screeningout of the study. If the person is not eligible,study staff willinform the person and ask them if they are interestedin learning more about the We The Village community.
4STUDY PROCEDURES
4.1 Provide a detailed description of the study proceduresin chronological order. As applicable,include information on: differences between the controland experimental groups, the number offollow-up visits, study visit windows, participanttime commitment per activity, and thesetting/location per activity.
Study procedures are outlined in the figure below.After screening eligible participants complete onlineenrollment, which includes providing informed consent,passing a consent quiz during the confirmation callby[CONTACT_464] (research assistant), agreeing to theHIPAA authorization form, and completion of the locatorformand baseline survey.  Participants are then randomizedinto one of three groups.
Participants assigned to the PEER group (Program C)will participate in an online peer support forumwith otherCSOs. Members of the forum post questions or commentsto weekly peer-led discussions and receive responsesand feedback from other CSO forum members. Memberstypi[INVESTIGATOR_443440]’s wellbeingand ask other members to share any strategies theyhave employed when dealing with their IPs.

Page11of26

Interactions typi[INVESTIGATOR_897], are based either in 12-Stepstrategies members have learned (usually throughAl-Anon orNar-Anon Family Groups or Family Training Workshopsprovided by [CONTACT_96116]) or in CRAFT skillslearned (usually from treatment programs or otherWe The Village members). A staff member from We TheVillage monitors forum interactions to ensure membersare interacting respectfully. This individual alsowillreport any adverse or severe adverse events that membersmention online.
Participant assigned to the CRAFT-A (Program A) andCRAFT-C (Program B) groups will have access to a12-module on-line CRAFT intervention and asked tocomplete one module weekly for [ADDRESS_564080] participants in learning and applying the concepts.The modules include: 1) Introduction to CRAFT; 2)Communication Training; 3) Functional Analysis ofDrug Using;4) Positive Reinforcement; 5) Withdrawing Reinforcement;6) Allowing Natural Consequences; 7)Problem-solving; 8) Life Enrichment; 9) SuggestingTreatment; 10) Recovery and Relapse; 11) Relationship;and12) Recap of Skills.  CRAFT-A participants also attenda weekly 60-minute online group sessions facilitatedby [CONTACT_443473]-certified coach. CRAFT-C participants attenda weekly 60-minute individualized on-on-one coachingsession with a CRAFT-certified coach. During weeklygroup or individual sessions concepts are brieflyreviewed,questions are answered, and skills are practiced throughrole-plays of common situations.  One-on-one sessionsinvolve role-plays that are tailored to the participants’specific circumstances.
Counselors must complete their CRAFT training andcertification prior to implementing Program A andProgramB. In addition, CRAFT counselors must complete CITItraining as limited personnel.

Revised measures have been adapted specifically for CSOs with IPs with an OUP, as appropriate.  In addition, weadded questions specific to the impact of COVID-19on the CSO, the CSO’s contact [CONTACT_443476], and IP’sability toaccess treatment and to receive quality treatmentdue to COVID-19 restrictions. The IP’s treatment entryis thestudy’s primary outcome and we need to understandthe impact of COVID-19 on our participants’ IPs gainingandreceiving treatment to assess the study’s impact ona primary outcome.

The next step after informed consent is to administerthe Consent Quiz during the Confirmation Call withallparticipants who agreed to participate. Participantswill be informed that their enrollment is not finaluntil theyspeak with a study staff person to complete the quizand call with study staff. We will attempt to returnphonecalls and emails within one business day.
The final step in enrollment is for participants toagree to HIPAA authorization (See Appendix C).TheHIPAA formwill be sent to participants after passing they passthe Consent Quiz during the Confirmation Call.
With the addition of the 8-week follow-up interviewand the need to get the Consent Addendum from allparticipants, WTV coaches will mention the ConsentAddendum email to the participants in the ProgramA andProgram B conditions during a scheduled session. Forparticipants in the Group C condition, WTV will postamessage on the community forum regarding the ConsentAddendum. Scripts of these messages are includedinAttachment 1. The research staff will send out theSurvey Gizmo link with the Consent Addendum in abrief emailmessage. Please refer to Attachment 1. Communicationwith participants for the messages that WTV and theresearch staff will use for contact[CONTACT_443482].
We will send participants, who agree to the ConsentAddendum, an electronic version of the Consent Addendumfor their records.

☐No risks
9.2 For each risk selected above, describe the magnitude,probability, duration, and/orreversibility of the harm, discomfort, or hazard.This study poses minimal risks to participants. Ifthe following risks occur, we anticipate the magnitudeto be lowbecause of the protections we have put in place toprotect identity and the access to study staff todiscuss
concerns.
     
9.3 For each risk selected above, describe how youwill manage or minimize the risk.1.Risk Resulting from a Breach of confidentiality –Data collected in the study will be kept strictlyconfidential and will not be shared with anyone outsideof the research team. We have developed strictprotocols for collecting, securing, storing, and transmittingdata. All study staff must complete a HumanSubjects training protocol.
2.Risk Resulting from Discomfort or Distress- completingresearch measures and procedures –Beforegiving consent, participants will be informed of potentialdiscomforts from completing researchmeasures. Participants will be allowed to refuse toanswer any question without penalty.Discomfortassociated with the treatment intervention- The levelof distress associated with interventions   isexpected to be similar to that which they would experienceduring any training program and is not a

We have not encountered any instances of significantemotional upset from research activities with individualswho have participated in our previous CRAFTand self-help studies. Nonetheless, participants willbe informed about this possible risk beforeconsenting and will be told that they can withdrawfrom the study at any time without penalty.
3.Risk Resulting from Possible or Perceived Invasionof Privacy -Participants are at risk for harm asaresult of being identified as a study participantor as someone with a loved one with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_443447]. Participants will be informed of this riskduring the consent process. Participants will receiveinstruction on how to protect their identity by [CONTACT_443491], completing intervention andresearch activities when they have enough time andprivacy to participate, and using unique usernames when participating in online study activities.In addition, participants will be informed of theimportance of not sharing another person’s information.The likelihood of this occurring is small.
     
For protocols that meet the criteria for exempt research,skip to Section 10.
9.4 Are there any risks to individuals related topregnancy, fertility, lactation, or effects on a fetusor neonate? If yes, describe how you will manage orreduce this risk.Some studies will require unique considerations ifa participant becomes pregnant during the study (e.g.,discontinuation of a diet-based intervention or medications).
No. We are conducting a behavioral online interventionthat poses no risks to participants who are pregnantorwho become pregnant during the study.

CurrentWTV members have reported increased level of happi[INVESTIGATOR_008],
support, and healthy behaviors. 
   
9.7 Define reportable and non-reportable Adverse Events(AEs).
Reportable AEs:Will be defined as: significant discomfort from answeringresearch questions or participating in the treatmentintervention such that the participant decides tostop their participation, reports of new diagnosesof
Page21of26
depression, anxiety, or panic attacks. In addition, we will document reports from the CSO of domestic or intimatepartner violence that may occur during their timein the study. We plan to collect reportable AEs thatoccur forthe participant.
Non-reportable AEs:Clinically insignificant events are not consideredAE’s. Examples of clinically insignificant eventsinclude mild viralillness (e.g., colds, flu, and runny nose), commonheadaches, minor scratches, and mild symptoms orproblemsassociated with medical conditions or accidents notrelated to drug use (e.g., back pain). As per thedefinition ofAEs, only significant worsening of psychiatric problemsor new problems will be reported as AEs. We willmonitorattrition rates but drop out from the study will notbe reported as an AE.
Reportable SAEs:will be defined as death; a life-threateningevent such as suicidal attempt, or inpatienthospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (including psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602])due to suicidal behavior, or psychiatric distress;orsubstance use overdose; or an event that extends anexisting hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443448]. Althoughwe donot believe the study procedures or intervention placesparticipants at increased risk for clinical worsening,wewill review and report events of clinical worseningthat leads to a psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443449].We plan to collect reportable SAEs that occur fromthe participant. These events are not anticipatedto occur ona regular basis, if at all, for participants.
9.8 Define reportable Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).Choose one or both as applicable to yourstudy.
☒Any adverse event that:1.Results in death;2.Is life-threatening (places the subject at immediaterisk of death from the event as it occurred);3.Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_443450];4.Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity;5.Results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or6.Based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardizethe subject’s health and may require medicalor surgical intervention to prevent one of the otheroutcomes listed above.(OHRP Guidance on Unanticipated Problems and AdverseEvents; January 15, 2007)
☒Other, or in addition to the above (please describe):Although we do not believe the study procedures orintervention places participants at increased riskfor clinicalworsening, we will review and report events of clinicalworsening that leads to a psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].Weplan to collect reportable SAEs that occur for theCSO from the CSO participants. These events are notanticipated to occur on a regular basis, if at all.
9.9 Describe plans to identify, monitor, manage, andreport AEs and SAEs. Include information onthe method and frequency of collecting AE and SAEinformation (e.g., weekly through telephonecalls, monthly at study visits, every time the subjectcomes to the clinical setting), the individualsresponsible for collecting this information (e.g.,research assistants, case managers, counselors),and the start and end of collection (e.g., from theparticipant’s first exposure to the interventionto their last study visit).
All WTV and PHMC staff who interact with participantsor monitor online conversations will be trained onthedefinitions of reportable and non-reportable AEs andSAEs and the way to complete the forms reportingthem.The PI [INVESTIGATOR_7706]-I will monitor the WTV forum and meetregularly with CRAFT counselors to track and to documentany AEs and SAEs. The WTV clinical team will be interactingwith participants in the CRAFT interventions on a

regular basis and will be responsible for collecting AE and SAE information shared during their interactions andreporting them to the PHMC team. In addition, theresearch assistant will document information relatedto AEsand SAEs shared when contact[CONTACT_220379]. Also,the WTV team monitor online comments and interactionsand will report any AEs or SAEs reported there tothe PHMC team.
All adverse and serious adverse events occurring duringthe study are documented on a form, reviewed andsigned by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Kimberly Kirby [INVESTIGATOR_227067], Calum Handley,and reported to the IRB. All SAEs are reported tothe IRBwithin 48 hours of our awareness of the event (24hours for fatal events).

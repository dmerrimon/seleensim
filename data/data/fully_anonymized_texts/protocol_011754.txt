1.  Purpose and objectives.           List the purpose and objectives:  
 
This is a pre market  fitting of a new brand of cranial remolding orthosis. Cranial remolding treatment is already an accepted 
treatment for deformational head shapes within the [LOCATION_002]. In 2021, the FDA approved the first 3D printed cranial 
remolding orthosis. We are fitting a new to US market 3D printed cranial orthosis, which has not yet been FDA approved. The 
orthosis is nearly identical to existing FDA approved devices. It is currently being used in Australia. Would like to determine the 
functionality of this new typ e of helmet.   
 
 
2.  Background.  
• Describe past experimental and/or clinical findings leading to the formulation of your study.    
• For research involving investigational drugs, describe the previously conducted animal and human studies.   
• For research that involves FDA approved drugs or devices, describe the FDA approved uses of this drug/device in 
relation to your protocol.   
• Attach a copy of the approved labeling as a product package insert or from the Physician’s Desk Reference.   
You may reference sponsor’s full protocol or grant application (section number and/or title) or if none, ensure background 
includes references.  
 
Please respond to all components of this item, or clearly indicate which components are not applicable.  
 
a. Background  
The cranial remolding orthosis (CRO) that will be used is 3D CRO fabricated by [CONTACT_808603]. Serkle is an Australian 
company seeking to introduce their orthoses to the American market.  Cranial remolding treatment is already an accepted 
treatment for deformational head shapes within the [LOCATION_002]. In 2021, the FDA approved the first 3D printed cranial 
remolding orthosis. We are fitting a new to US market 3D printed cranial orthosis, which has not yet been FDA approved. The 
orthosis is nearly identi cal to existing FDA approved devices.  
 
b. Current practice  
Cranial remolding orthoses are used to treat deformational plagiocephaly. After receiving a plagiocephaly diagnosis from a 
physician infants from the age of 3 months to 18 months can be fitted with a cranial remolding orthosis. The orthosis is worn 23 hours a day and while the child grows the helmet guides the growth to prevent/reduce head shape asymmetry’s. This is standard of care. There are also another method that is considered standard of care for more mild cases of deformational 
plagiocephaly and this  is repositioning. Repositioning is when the caregiver of the parent constant repositions the infant to 
prevent him or her from lying in their flat spot.  
  
3.  Study Design.  
Describe the study design (e.g., single/double blind, parallel, crossover, etc.)  Consider inserting a scheme to visually present the 
study design.  
 
This is a pre -market fitting of a cranial remolding orthosis.  There will be no data collected or published through this. Serkel, the 
manufactures of the cranial remolding orthosis, may be provided information on the success of their device. Parent/caregi vers 
will be provided all information regarding the new cranial remolding orthosis. Through the informed consent: 1) they will be aware 
this specific orthosis is not yet a FDA approved orthosis, 2) there are similar orthoses approved on the market 3)they w ill be

CROs will see those participating in the pre market fitting and standards of care will be provided.  
 
 
 
4.  Research Plan / Description of the Research Methods:   
4.a.  Provide a comprehensive narrative describing the research methods .   
     1) Provide the order in which tests/procedures will be performed ,  
     2) Provide the setting  for these events and a description of the methods used to protect privacy during the study.   
     3) Provide the plan for data analysis  (include as applicable the sample size calculation)  
 
Please respond to all components of this item, or clearly indicate which components are not applicable.  
 
 
1) Infants with the diagnosis of plagiocephaly will be referred by [CONTACT_808604] a cranial remolding orthosis. Infants will be evaluated and if deformational plagiocephaly is present and treatable by [INVESTIGATOR_30909], 
parents/caregivers will be provided the option to be fit with a traditional CRO or the pre- market fitting CRO. Benefits and 
limitations will be provided for each. Parents/caregivers will be provide time to consider and think about both options. 
Should they decide for their c hild to be treated with a pre-market CRO. They will be provided and will review the 
informed consent together.  Once informed consent is received, infant’s head will be scanned and CRO will be 
fabricated. 1 week later they will be fitted with CRO. And will be followed up with 1 -2 week after that. After initial (1 -2 
week) follow up,  will follow up every 3 weeks.  (this is standard of care)    
2) All of the appointments (the evaluation, fitting, follow ups) will be held in the UTSW Prosthetics Orthotics clinic in a private patient room. Documentation will be done in Epic. Scans, pi[INVESTIGATOR_499], and measurements sheets will be stored in a protected folder  on Microsoft teams.  
3) Serkel will be providing limited amount ( 18) of pre -market helmets for no cost.  This determines the size of our sample, 
approximately 18 subjects, up to 25 max.  
4) Data collected will be cranial measurements, scans, and photos. This data will not be published, but remain in the patient chart. (this is standard of care procedures). Serkel manufacture is requesting initial and final cranial 
measurements/ratios (de- identified data).

5.  Safety Precautions.  (Describe safeguards to address the serious risks listed above.)  
a.  Describe the procedures for protecting against or minimizing any potential risks for each of the more than minimal risk 
research procedures  listed above.  
Those participating in pre -market fittings will be followed up with every [ADDRESS_1117657] access (phone number and 
email) to contact [CONTACT_808605]. (this is standard of care)  
b.  Where appropriate, discuss provisions for ensuring necessary medical or professional intervention in the event of adverse 
events, or unanticipated problems involving subjects.  
Should reaction occur that cannot be treated by [CONTACT_808606], the patient will be instructed to discontinue wearing the orthosis  and 
referring physician will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If reactions are in need of immediate attention, will advise patient’s parents/caregiv ers to 
discontinue wearing CRO  and to go to urgent care.

7 (100) In this study, sites will be allowed to perform a pre-study screening assessment (at Week -3) 
prior to enrolment visit to screen for HbA1c criteria.  All potentially eligible patients will be 
enrolled, provide informed consent, undergo screening for all applicable inclusion/exclusion criteria, and submit laboratory samples at Enrolment (Visit 1, 2 weeks prior to randomisation).  
Patients should be treated with a stable, Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of metformin 
monotherapy ( 1500mg/day) for at least 8 weeks prior to Enrolment, and remain on the same 
type and dose of metformin therapy for the duration of the study as the background therapy 
for all treatment arms indicated below: 
1. Dapagliflozin (5mg orally once daily [QD]) plus placebo as an add-on to metformin 
(1500mg/day orally) 
2. Dapagliflozin (5mg orally once daily [QD]) plus saxagliptin (5mg orally once daily 
[QD]) as an add-on to metformin ( 1500mg/day orally) 
3. Saxagliptin (5mg orally once daily [QD]) plus placebo as an add-on to metformin 
(1500mg/day orally)

Target patient population 
Approximately 900 patients with T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control receiving 
metformin at a MTD of 1500mg/day for at least [ADDRESS_409049], dosage and mode of administration 
Dapagliflozin and matching placebo: Dapagliflozin 5mg tablets or placebo matching dapagliflozin will be administered orally once 
daily for the 24-week double-blind treatment period. 
Saxagliptin and matching placebo: 
Saxagliptin 5mg tablets or placebo matching saxagliptin will be administered orally once daily 
for the 24-week double-blind treatment period. 
Other Treatments: 
Metformin: For the duration of the study, patients should continue to administer the same type and dose of 
metformin therapy they were using at study entry (at a daily dose 1500mg).  Metformin 
should be administered and stored according to product and country specific labelling. 
Rescue therapy: 
Patients who require rescue therapy will receive open label dapagliflozin 10mg plus 
saxagliptin 5mg as a first line treatment.  Insulin can be given as a second line treatment at 
Investigators discretion. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses will be run for the Full Analysis (FA) population and for the Per Protocol 
(PP) population (Refer section 8.3.1) if more than 10% of patients from the FA population are 
excluded from the PP population for important protocol deviations.

9 (100) All analyses will be done using values regardless of rescue/intensification of treatment or 
discontinuation of the study treatment.  Sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the primary 
efficacy analysis excluding the data after rescue or more than 8 days after discontinuation of the study treatment. 
The primary endpoint will be tested for saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus each of the 
individual agents simultaneously at the alpha = 0.05 level (two sided).  The secondary endpoints then will be tested sequentially.  Each comparison will be tested at the alpha = 0.05 
(two-sided) level. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a longitudinal repeated measures 
analysis for the change from baseline at Week 24, with terms for 
treatment group, baseline value, time (each relevant visit), the interaction of treatment and 
time, and the interaction of baseline value and time in the model. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes within each treatment 
group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatment groups. 
A sample size of [ADDRESS_409051] 90% power to simultaneously 
detect a difference in mean change from baseline to week 24 in HbA1c of -0.30 (%) for both 
primary endpoint comparisons of saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin vs its components at the 2-
sided alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_409052] deviation of 1.0% and a 3% non-evaluability rate.  CCI

19 (100) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease characterised by [CONTACT_330934].  Given the progressive 
nature of T2DM, it is challenging to achieve and maintain tight glycaemic control and 
approximately 50% of T2DM patients fail to achieve the American Diabetes Association (ADA) goal for glycaemic control of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of <7.0% (Hoerger et al 
2008).  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_330904] a step-wise addition of different classes 
of antihyperglycaemic drugs, as most patients eventually require 2 or more agents to achieve 
or maintain glycaemic targets.  Metformin, a biguanide, is the recommended drug of choice 
for initiating oral antidiabetic (OAD) therapy, while other classes of antidiabetic agents are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_330905].  An ideal add-on to metformin would provide strong HbA1c reduction through complementary mechanisms of action (MoA), 
with weight loss, and no hypoglycaemia. 
Other classes of OADs include inhibitors of the human renal sodium glucose co-transporter 2 
(SGLT2), the major transporter responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidney. 
Dapagliflozin is a potent, highly selective, and orally active SGLT2 inhibitor and its MoA 
results in the direct and insulin-independent elimination of glucose by [CONTACT_10521].  Dapagliflozin is approved in the [LOCATION_002] (US) and the European Union (EU [trade 
names: Farxiga™ and Forxiga™, respectively]) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in adults with T2DM.  Clinical studies with dapagliflozin demonstrated the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin in a wide range of patients with T2DM.  Treatment with 
dapagliflozin led to significant and clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c, fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG), and postprandial glucose (PPG) levels, and was associated with weight loss. 
Inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase -4 (DPP-4), the enzyme responsible for the inactivation of 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, are 
another class of OADs. Saxagliptin is a highly potent, selective, reversible, and competitive DPP-4 inhibitor. By [CONTACT_330935]-4, saxagliptin potentiates active endogenous GLP-1 
concentrations, augmenting the physiological mechanism of insulin secretion and suppressing 
glucagon release, thereby [CONTACT_330936] T2DM. Saxagliptin is 
approved by [CONTACT_330937] T2DM and in Phase III trials, has effectively 
reduced HbA1c in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM on a stable dose of metformin, 
SUs, or thiazolidinedione, and has favorable safety and tolerability profiles (A. R. Chacra et al 2009, Jaime A. Davidson 2014, Priscilla L Hollander et al 2011, Ralph A. Defronzo et al 
2009). 
Dapagliflozin and saxagliptin have demonstrated, both individually and added to metformin, a 
favorable safety and tolerability profile.  These OADs have demonstrated a low propensity for 
hypoglycaemia, therefore addressing a potential key concern when adding [ADDRESS_409070] either demonstrated weight neutrality (saxagliptin) or

Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409071] 2016 
20 (100) moderate weight reduction (dapagliflozin).  Dapagliflozin has also demonstrated persistent 
effects on HbA1c over 4 years of therapy. 
Phase III study (CV181169) demonstrated that early combination treatment with dapagliflozin 
and saxagliptin, added together with metformin as triple therapy, elicited superior reduction in 
HbA1c as compared to the addition of either saxagliptin OR dapagliflozin to metformin in 
patients with inadequately controlled T2DM.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_330906]1c, this was not associated with an increase in hypoglycaemic event rates, which were overall low and similar 
across the different therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330907].  While saxagliptin plus metformin has a neutral effect on 
weight, combination therapy including dapagliflozin plus metformin or dapagliflozin combined with saxagliptin plus metformin therapy resulted in a significant reduction of 
bodyweight (Rosenstock J et al 2015).  
The recommended starting dose of dapagliflozin is 5mg in a few countries.  The dose can be 
increased to 10mg in patients tolerating dapagliflozin 5mg who require additional glycaemic 
control. The aim of this study is thus to provide relevant clinical data regarding the efficacy 
and short term safety of saxagliptin 5mg co-administered with dapagliflozin 5mg after 24 weeks. 
This is a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, multi-center, 24 week, parallel-group 
study to evaluate safety and efficacy of saxagliptin 5mg co-administered with dapagliflozin 5mg, compared with either saxagliptin 5mg or dapagliflozin 5mg all given as add-on therapy 
to metformin in patients who are inadequately controlled on metformin alone.  After 
randomisation the patients will visit the clinic after 6, 12, and 24 weeks.  Efficacy as well as 
safety assessments will be taken before randomisation and at each visit at the clinic. 
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups 
This is a Phase III study, performed as part of the clinical development program for 
saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin fixed dose combination (FDC) therapy to improve glycaemic 
control as an adjunct to diet and exercise and metformin when treatment with both saxagliptin and dapagliflozin is appropriate. 
Study design, dose selection, and control groups 
The current study is designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of therapy with saxagliptin 5mg 
co-administered with dapagliflozin 5mg, compared to therapy with saxaglipgtin 5mg or 
dapagliflozin 5mg in patients who are inadequately controlled on 1500mg/day of metformin 
monotherapy. 
A 24-week randomised, double-blinded treatment period will allow for adequate information 
on efficacy and safety of the studied doses. 
Active control group 
This is a double-blind, active-controlled study.  All three study arms, saxagliptin 5mg plus 
dapagliflozin 5mg, saxagliptin 5mg plus placebo and dapagliflozin 5mg plus placebo, contain 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409072] 2016 
21 (100) at least one approved, oral anti-diabetic medication added to the background of metformin. 
Therefore all patients are anticipated to benefit from better glycaemic control during the study. 
Background therapy 
Metformin is a biguanide; its major effect is to decrease hepatic glucose output and lower 
fasting glucose.  It is recommended as the initial pharmacological therapy in both the US and 
the EU because of its glycaemic efficacy, weight neutrality, low risk of hypoglycaemia, good 
tolerability, and relatively low cost (Inzucchi et al 2012). 
Dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin (Farxiga™) is approved in many countries worldwide, including the US, 
Canada, and countries in the EU, as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic 
control in patients with T2DM for whom metformin use is considered inappropriate due to intolerance, and in combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products when these, 
in combination with diet and exercise do not provide adequate glycaemic control.  The 5mg 
dose was chosen for this study because it is the starting dose in the US, Canada and Switzerland, has demonstrated clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c, and is used at that 
dose in the combination under evaluation in this study.  Treatment with dapagliflozin, with its 
unique mechanism of action, induces a persistent loss of excess glucose with associated calories in the urine, resulting in a consistent and maintained reduction of total body weight, in 
addition to improved glycaemic control.  Dapagliflozin also has a mild diuretic effect, which 
in combination with weight loss, has the potential to reduce blood pressure. 
Saxagliptin 
Saxagliptin (Onglyza™) is approved in many countries worldwide, including the US, Canada 
and countries in the EU as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in 
adults with T2DM.  The results from the 8 Phase II and III clinical studies with saxagliptin support the oral dose of 5mg once daily (QD) in a wide range of patients with T2DM, as either 
monotherapy, add on combination therapy with metformin, a Thiazolidinediones(TZD), a 
Sulphonylurea (SU), insulin, or initial combination therapy with metformin.  Saxagliptin 5mg resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c, as well as Fasting Plasma Glucose 
(FPG), Post Prandial Glucose (PPG), insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon levels and is the 
recommended dose according to the approved drug label. 
Combination of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin 
The combination of saxagliptin 5mg and dapagliflozin 10mg has been studied in 3 phase III 
trials.  The main study CV181-169, was a double blind randomised trial has compared dual 
add on saxagliptin 5mg/ dapagliflozin 10mg FDC to both of the components and found the FDC to be safe and superior to each of the components.  The treatment was given on the 
background of metformin and lasted for 24 weeks. 
Two other studies were sequential add on of saxagliptin 5mg to a background of dapagliflozin 
10mg and metformin (study CV181-168) and add on dapagliflozin 10mg to a background of 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409073] 2016 
22 (100) saxagliptin 5mg and metformin (study MB102-129).  Both studies found the co-administration 
of saxagliptin 5mg and dapagliflozin 10mg to be well tolerated and efficacious. 
Choice of outcome variables 
The primary endpoint is change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 24.  HbA1c is the clinical 
and regulatory parameter used to estimate glycaemic efficacy of an OAD therapy in patients 
with T2DM.  Because of its novel, complementary mechanism of action, dapagliflozin may 
have additive or synergistic HbA1c-lowering effects when given in combination with other anti-hyperglycaemic agents.  Additionally, as beneficial effects on FPG and weight have been 
observed in other dapagliflozin studies, these variables have been chosen as key secondary 
objectives. 
The rationale for selection of the secondary variables and exploratory variables is provided 
below: 
1. Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7.0%: The target HbA1c for most patients 
with T2DM is <7.0% according to international diabetes treatment guidelines. 
2. FPG is a well-established measure of short-term glycaemic efficacy (CHMP 2012). 
3. Weight: More than 85% of patients with T2DM are overweight or obese (CDC 
2004) Weight loss is a fundamental goal for the majority of patients with T2DM as 
it has been shown to improve comorbid conditions such as hypertension, 
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], heart disease, osteoarthritis, and sleep apnea (NHLBI 1998).  
4. The start of rescue is an indirect measure of glucose efficacy and shows the 
durability of efficacy. 
Choice of study population 
Patients Patients with T2DM with inadequate glycaemic control while being treated with at least 
1500mg/day, of metformin therapy. 
HbA1c 
The HbA1c inclusion criterion at randomisation (i.e., 7.5% to 10.0%) was selected to 
include patients with poor glycaemic control, a population that would potentially achieve the greatest benefit from simultaneous addition of [ADDRESS_409074] been tested in pregnant women and the risks to 
embryo, foetus, and infant are unknown.  For this reason, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are excluded and women of childbearing age are instructed to take precautions 
to avoid becoming pregnant during the study.

Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409075] 2016 
23 (100) Other 
The purpose of the majority of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is to limit confounding 
factors that may complicate the interpretation of the study results (e.g., corticosteroid-induced 
T2DM or haemoglobinopathies that would interfere with the HbA1c analyses) or to exclude patients whose safety could be compromised by [CONTACT_9286]. 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment 
Details regarding potential risks associated with administration of dapagliflozin and 
saxagliptin are provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for each medication. 
The study will provide efficacy and safety information for dapagliflozin 5mg plus saxagliptin 
5mg added to metformin compared to dapagliflozin 5mg added to metformin or saxagliptin 
5mg added to metformin, in patients with T2DM who are on metformin therapy.  Patients in 
the dapagliflozin plus placebo group will receive saxagliptin-matching placebo with metformin; and patients in the saxagliptin group will receive dapagliflozin matching placebo 
with metformin.  All patients will be monitored throughout the study to ensure adequate 
glycaemic control. 
Dapagliflozin and Saxagliptin 
Prior to approval, dapagliflozin was evaluated in [ADDRESS_409076] of care in patients with 
T2DM at high cardiovascular (CV) risk, saxagliptin neither reduced nor increased the risk of 
the primary composite endpoint of CV death, myocardial infarction (MI), or ischemic stroke (Scirica et al 2013). 
Considering the comprehensive previous clinical experience with saxagliptin and 
dapagliflozin, the study’s design features (including the inclusion, exclusion, and discontinuation criteria), and the planned safety procedures, participation in this study presents 
a minimal and thus acceptable risk to the individual patients who will be included. 
Protection against risks 
This study has been designed with appropriate measures in place to monitor and minimise any 
of the potential health risks to participating patients.  To ensure the safety of all patients 
participating in this study, [COMPANY_008] is conducting a real-time review of all safety 
information from all ongoing clinical dapagliflozin and saxagliptin studies as they become available.  Safety signal detection will include the integration of all available sources of safety 
information, including clinical study data, adverse event (AE) reports, preclinical data, 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_9037], and literature reports, to identify and characterise unrecognised safety risks or changes in those which are currently expected Adverse Drug Reactions.  Any 
information that may affect the benefit-risk profile of dapagliflozin or saxagliptin will be 
immediately communicated to relevant Health Authorities and appropriate actions will be 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409077] 2016 
24 (100) taken regarding the clinical program as needed.  Thus real-time, active safety surveillance will 
be conducted during the entire duration of this study.  In addition, all dapagliflozin and 
saxagliptin studies are subject to a carefully designed patient risk management plan that includes the temporary and if necessary permanent discontinuation of investigational product 
(IP) in individual patients in whom a potential health risk or a laboratory abnormality of 
clinical concern has been identified. 
Ketoacidosis 
There have been post-marketing reports of ketoacidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis, in 
patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus taking dapagliflozin and other SGLT2 
inhibitors, although a causal relationship has not been established. Dapagliflozin is not 
indicated for the treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. 
Patients treated with dapagliflozin who present with signs and symptoms consistent with 
ketoacidosis, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, malaise, and shortness of breath, 
should be assessed for ketoacidosis, even if blood glucose levels are below 14 mmol/L (250 
mg/dL). If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinuation or temporary interruption of dapagliflozin should be considered and the patient should be promptly evaluated. 
Predisposing factors to ketoacidosis include a low beta-cell function reserve resulting from 
pancreatic disorders (e.g, type 1 diabetes, history of pancreatitis, or pancreatic surgery), insulin dose reduction, reduced caloric intake, or increased insulin requirements due to 
infections, illness or surgery and alcohol abuse. Dapagliflozin should be used with caution in 
these patients. 
Potential benefits to Patients 
Based on prior clinical trials experience and post-marketing information, both saxagliptin and 
dapagliflozin have a favorable benefit-risk ratio as monotherapy and add-on combination 
therapy.  Integrated analyses of the safety data from 3 Phase III clinical studies demonstrated that the combined use of saxagliptin 5mg and dapagliflozin 10mg administered as either a 
dual or a sequential add-on to metformin was well tolerated in patients who were inadequately 
controlled on metformin alone.  The combined use of saxagliptin and dapagliflozin was associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia.  Overall, the safety profile of administering the 2 
agents together was consistent with prior clinical trials which evaluated the safety of these 
agents as monotherapy or as add-on therapy.  In these 3 prior Phase III clinical studies, 
treatment with saxagliptin and dapagliflozin showed clinically relevant decreases in HbA1c, 
leading to a large proportion of patients achieving the therapeutic goal of HbA1c <7%, and 
modest reduction in body weight in patients with T2DM.  In the present study, a lower than commonly used dose of dapagliflozin (5mg) is used in combination with the standard dose of 
saxagliptin (5mg) so the risks of adverse events (AEs) are further reduced.  In addition, 
saxagliptin is expected to be weight neutral and dapagliflozin to reduce weight moderately, while both have shown a low risk for hypoglycaemia in combination with metformin.  Patients 
are also expected to receive some benefit in the form of increased medical care/attention when 
participating in study procedures, which includes multiple clinic visits and physical

25 (100) examinations over the duration of the study.  Patients will also receive counselling on dietary 
and life-style modifications. 
Informed consent and alternatives to participation 
All prospective participants will be informed of the possible risks and benefits associated with 
this study, and their consent will be received prior to performing any study-related activity.  
When a prospective participant elects to not participate in the study or to withdraw from the 
study, other medications are available to treat their diabetes, and the patient will not be disadvantaged in any way.

Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409093] 2016 
34 (100) (e) Patient is a participating investigator, study coordinator, employee of an 
investigator or immediate family member of any of the aforementioned. 
(f) Previous enrolment or randomisation in the present study. 
Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled patients see Section 3.4. 
3.[ADDRESS_409094] obtain 
patient’s consent to this screening procedure through an abbreviated informed consent (see 
Section 10.4.1).  Investigator(s) should keep a record of patients who entered pre-study 
screening and keep it as the patient screening log. 
For patients that are enrolled (Visit 1) into the study, the Investigators will: 1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient before any study-specific 
procedures are performed. 
2. Assign (using the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) or Interactive Web 
Response System (IWRS) potential patient a unique enrolment number, beginning 
with ‘E + 4-digit site number + [ADDRESS_409095] patient at site 9999 would be assigned the patient number: 
E9999001.  This number will be used for identification throughout the study. 
3. Determine patient eligibility in accordance with inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
4. Assign an eligible patient unique randomisation code, by [CONTACT_330939], 
see Section 3.5.  Patient is considered randomised in the study after this assignment. 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. 
3.[ADDRESS_409096] be withdrawn from the study. 
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomized in error, or 
incorrectly started on treatment, the following steps need to be taken: 
1. The Investigator or Study Monitor should inform the [COMPANY_008] study physician 
immediately, ensuring patient safety must always be the number one priority. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409097] 2016 
35 (100) 2. Study Treatment must be discontinued in all cases where continued treatment is 
deemed to pose a safety risk to the patient.  A discussion should occur between the 
[COMPANY_008] study physician and the investigator, a decision may be reached that whether to continue or discontinue the patient from study treatment.  The 
[COMPANY_008] study physician must ensure all decisions are appropriately 
documented. 
3. In those cases where continuation of study therapy is judged not to present a 
concern related to safety and disease management, the rationale for continuing 
study therapy must be clearly documented.  The patient should continue follow up in accordance with defined study procedures.  
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups 
At Visit 2 (Baseline/Week 0), enrolled patients who meet all study requirements based on 
inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised strictly sequentially within each center as 
patients are eligible for randomisation.  The randomisation codes will be computer generated using the AZ Randomisation system (AZRand) and loaded into the IVRS/IWRS database.  
The patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to the following treatment groups: 
1. Dapagliflozin 5mg + placebo for saxagliptin 
2. Dapagliflozin 5mg + saxagliptin 5mg 
3. Saxagliptin 5mg + placebo for dapagliflozin 
If a randomisation number is allocated incorrectly, no attempt should be made to remedy the 
error once study material has been dispensed.  The patient will continue with the allocated 
number and study material.  [COMPANY_008] or representative should be notified as soon as the 
error is discovered.  Subsequent patients will continue using the first unallocated randomisation number in the original numbering sequence. 
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding 
Blinding is ensured by [CONTACT_2329] a double-blind, double-dummy technique.  Patients, the 
Investigator, study site personnel, and Sponsor personnel involved with data review and 
analysis will be blinded throughout the study until database lock.  The active tablets and the 
respective placebo tablets will be identical in size, colour, smell, and taste as described in 
Table 5.  The bottles with IPs will be labelled with unique identification numbers allocated from the IVRS/IWRS. 
No member of the study team at [COMPANY_008], at study sites, or any clinical research 
organization (CRO) handling data will have access to the randomisation scheme during the conduct of the study, with the exception of the [COMPANY_008] personnel generating the 
randomisation scheme as well as [COMPANY_008]’s Supply Chain Study Management (SCSM), 
[COMPANY_008] Global Pharmacovigilance (GPV), and the CRO providing the IVRS/IWRS and 
carrying out the packaging and labelling of IPs.

Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409098] 2016 
36 (100) 3.7 Methods for unblinding  
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomisation for each randomised 
patient, will be available to the Investigator(s) from the IVRS/IWRS. Routines for this will be 
described in the IVRS/IWRS user manual that will be provided to each center. 
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation.  The 
Investigator documents and reports the action to [COMPANY_008], without revealing the treatment 
given to patient and to the [COMPANY_008] staff. 
[COMPANY_008] retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an investigational product and that potentially require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.  Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual 
patient have been made and documented. 
3.8 Restrictions 
Once screened and qualified for entry, patients will be instructed as follows: 
1. Fast overnight for 8 to 12 hours prior to each study site visit, i.e., no food or 
beverage except water.  Allowed medications can be taken with water only. 
2. Continue metformin therapy at current dosage and at approximately the same time 
each day, except that the morning dose of metformin should be delayed on the 
morning of study site visits. 
3. Delay administering the IPs (as applicable) and metformin on the morning of the 
clinic visit and bring study medication and metformin to each study site visit. 
4. Refrain from alcohol intake and intense exercise 24 hours prior to each visit and 
recommend not to use tobacco/nicotine within [ADDRESS_409099] study visit. 
6. Comply with prescribed dosing regimen to preserve study integrity and ensure 
patient safety. 
7. Discuss any new prescriptions and over-the-counter or herbal/nutritional therapi[INVESTIGATOR_330909], as concomitant use could result in alterations to their glycaemic control and may place them at risk for significant hypoglycaemic 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]. 
8. Make every attempt to adhere to the diet and exercise counseling and to the protocol 
visit schedule.

37 (100) 9. Women must immediately contact [CONTACT_330940]. 
If a patient comes to a visit without having followed the above instructions, then the patient 
should be re-scheduled for the entire visit (if possible within the allowed time-window).  The 
Sponsor or designee should be contact[CONTACT_330941]. 
3.[ADDRESS_409101] 
3.9.1 General discontinuation criteria: 
Patients may be discontinued from investigational product (IP) in the following situations: 
1. Patient decision.  The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment. 
2. Patient experiences an AE or SAE that, in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], necessitates 
discontinuation from study medication. 
3. The Investigator feels it is in the patient's best interest to discontinue study 
medication for reasons other than AE. If this decision is made because of an SAE or a clinically significant abnormal laboratory value, appropriate measures are to be 
taken. The Sponsor or its designee is to be alerted immediately (see Section 6.4). 
4. Severe non-compliance with the study protocol as judged by [CONTACT_11219]/or 
[COMPANY_008] 
5. Incorrectly enrolled patients (see Section 3.4) 
6. Lack of Therapeutic response 
3.9.2 Study-specific discontinuation criteria: 
1. Initial and repeat laboratory tests meet any of the following criteria (see Appendix 
D): 
 ALT and/or AST are >3x ULN and TB >2x ULN 
 ALT and/or AST are >5x ULN for 14 consecutive days, at any time after 
initial confirmatory results 
 ALT and/or AST are >8x ULN 
2. Pregnancy confirmed by a positive pregnancy test or otherwise verified 
3. Hypoglycaemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_330910] 3.9.3

Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409102] 2016 
38 (100) 4. Use of (need for) any anti-hyperglycaemic medication other than IP or background 
metformin or rescue therapy allowed by [CONTACT_990].  Insulin use is permitted in the 
following situations: 
 For up to 14 days in total during the study and up to 7 continuous days if 
patients are unable to take oral medications (for example during a 
gastrointestinal illness) 
 For up to 14 days in total during the study and up to 7 continuous days if there 
is a documented illness or infection that requires additional therapy for 
maintaining glycaemic control 
 For up to [ADDRESS_409103] to temporarily stop IP and/or metformin due to recommendations 
made in this clinical study protocol 
 For up to 7 days during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956].  When the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330911]’s glycaemic control, treatment with insulin is 
considered a rescue and is allowed for as long as clinically necessary. 
5. eGFR <60mL/min/1.73m2 (by [CONTACT_86605]) confirmed by a repeated central lab 
measurement within 1 week. 
Note : Withhold the study medication until results for the retest of eGFR are 
available ONLY for randomisation visit (For all other visits, there is no need to 
interrupt the study medication) 
3.9.3 Discontinuation guidelines for protocol-defined severe hypoglycaemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_149763]-severe hypoglycaemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_330912].  The assessment of a single finger stick or central laboratory glucose value should 
not be the sole assessment used to determine patient discontinuation for hypoglycaemia. 
Clinical indications for discontinuation because of hypoglycaemia should include the 
following: 
(a) Multiple occasions of epi[INVESTIGATOR_149765], in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_684], indicate that continued treatment with study therapy is not in the best 
interest of the patient.  This includes, but is not limited to: 
 Symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia (e.g., sweating, shakiness, increased 
heart rate, confusion, dizziness, light-headedness, or hunger) in the absence of 
environmental factors known to contribute to hypoglycaemia (i.e., excess 
physical activity, concurrent illness, or missed or delayed meal)

Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409104] 2016 
39 (100) and/or 
 Documented finger stick glucose values <54mg/dL (<3.0mmol/L) 
(b) A patient may also be discontinued from the study because of severe 
hypoglycaemia, as determined by [CONTACT_737]. 
If finger stick glucose values are discordant from glycaemic control assessed by [CONTACT_149792], the patient’s glucose meter should be tested and the instructions for 
use reviewed with the patient. 
3.9.[ADDRESS_409105]  
At any time, patients are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study (i.e., IP and 
assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient who decides 
to discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs.  If 
possible, the patient will be seen and assessed by [CONTACT_39595].  Any AEs will be followed up (see Section 6.3.5); patient diaries and all study drugs should be returned by [CONTACT_102]. 
Patients who discontinue from the study medication will have an Early Termination Visit 
equivalent to the Visit 5 (Week 24/End of Treatment) assessments immediately following discontinuation of study medication (see Section 4.5). 
If a patient is discontinued from the study, his/her randomisation or enrolment number will not 
be reused, and the patient will not be allowed to re-enter the study.  Randomised patients who 
discontinue early from the study will not be replaced. 
All patients who discontinue study drug should remain in the study and follow the 
original visit schedule.  Patients unable or unwilling to return for scheduled visits will have 
the opportunity to receive follow-up via telephone calls placed by [CONTACT_330942]. The only exception to this procedure is when a patient 
withdraws consent for all study procedures or loses the ability to consent freely (i.e., is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatment of either a psychiatric or physical 
illness).  
3.[ADDRESS_409106] all protocol-required procedures to 
complete the study.  Patients may be removed from the study for the following reasons: 
1. Screen failures: see Section 3.10.1. 
2. Withdrawal by [CONTACT_4676]: see Section 3.10.2.  
3. Lost to Follow-Up: Patient fails to return for study visits and cannot be reached with 
reasonable, repeated attempts. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409107] 2016 
40 (100) To prevent patients being lost to follow-up, their contact [CONTACT_8972], including next of kin contacts 
should be collected initially and updated regularly by [CONTACT_19984].  The 
Investigator should educate the patient on the importance of contact [CONTACT_330943].  Every effort will be made to ensure that the patient continues to return 
to the clinic for study visits and to avoid “lost to follow-up” during the conduct of the study.   
The study staff should make diligent attempts to contact [CONTACT_330944], patient’s health professionals, and any other means that 
comply with country and local laws and regulations.  After the first missed visit, patients who 
are considered temporarily lost to follow-up will have [ADDRESS_409108] be fully documented in the patient’s source records and recorded in the 
electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  The documentation must include the reason for the withdrawal and details of any sequelae (followed until symptoms resolve or improve, as 
appropriate). 
If a patient is withdrawn from the study, they must complete the procedures outlined in 
Section 3.10.2. 
3.10.[ADDRESS_409109] the reason for study withdrawal recorded as ‘Eligibility Criteria not fulfilled’ (i.e., patient does not meet the required 
inclusion/exclusion criteria). This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for screen failures 
(not randomised patients). Patients can only be enrolled 1 time into this study.  
3.10.2  Withdrawal of the informed consent 
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment. 
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any AEs.  The Investigator will follow-up AEs outside of the clinical study.  All attempts 
should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal and, where possible, 
the primary underlying reason should be recorded (e.g., withdrawal due to an AE or lack of 
efficacy should not be recorded in the “voluntary withdrawal” category). 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 
3.11 Discontinuation of the study 
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], trial patients are placed at 
undue risk because of clinically significant findings that: 
1. Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414].

Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409110] 2016 
41 (100) 2. Are assessed as causally related to IP. 
3. Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study. 
In addition to above, study may be stopped if: 1. Study terminated by [CONTACT_2728]: The Sponsor discontinues the study   protocol. 
2. Administrative reasons: The EU or other regulatory authority discontinues the study 
protocol or the clinical study site discontinues participation. 
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRF. All reasons for discontinuation of study must 
be documented. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients interests.

45 (100) 4.1 Screening Visit 
Procedures will be performed according to the Study Plan Table 1. 
Failure to meet the HbA1c inclusion criterion is the main reason for screening failure in 
diabetes treatment studies.  Therefore, in this study, sites need to mandatorily perform a pre-
study screening assessment (at Week -3) within 1 week prior to enrolment visit, which will comprise of a collection of 1 non-fasting blood sample to determine HbA1c at the central 
laboratory. Investigators will screen only patients who are potentially eligible for the study 
based on their medical conditions and existing therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and only those who are expected to meet all entry criteria at Enrolment (Visit 1). 
In order to be considered for screening, patients must: 
1. Be [ADDRESS_409117] a documented diagnosis of T2DM. 
3. Currently treated with a stable MTD ( 1500mg/day) of metformin therapy and not 
have received any other antihyperglycaemic therapy within 8 weeks from the expected date of Enrolment (Visit 1). 
At this Screening visit, the following will be performed: 
1. Abbreviated informed consent to the pre- study screening procedures will be 
obtained (see Section 10.4.1). 
2. A blood sample will be collected for measurement of HbA1c by a central 
laboratory.  Fasting is not required. 
3. Verification of current metformin therapy 
Patients with HbA1c result of 7.5% to 10.0% assessed based on central laboratory results 
from screening visit will be scheduled for an enrolment visit in approximately 7 days.  Patients should be fasting at the next visit (Enrolment, Visit 1) and a full ICF will be obtained 
before any assessments at that visit are initiated. 
Note: Re-testing of HbA1c is permitted once within one month of the initial screening 
visit if central laboratory result of HbA1c is >7.0% and <7.5% or >10% and <10.5%.  
All patients who are screened should be listed on a patient screening log. A screening code 
will be created for all screened patients by [CONTACT_14523]. Patients with re-tested HbA1c at screening will have the same screening code. This code will identify screening laboratory 
results including retest results together with date of birth and gender.

46 (100) 4.2 Enrolment Period 
Procedures will be performed according to the Study Plan (Table 1).  Patients will be 
instructed to arrive in the morning for each scheduled visit.  Prior to this visit, patients are to 
have fasted overnight for 8 to 12 hours (no food, no beverage, except water).  Patients are 
advised to refrain from alcohol intake and intense exercise 24 hours prior to each visit and recommend not to use tobacco/nicotine within 12 hours prior to each visit.  Patients should 
delay administering their morning dose of metformin on the morning of the enrolment visit 
(Visit 1). 
4.2.1 Enrolment visit (Visit 1, Week -2) 
Patients on a stable, MTD of metformin monotherapy 1500mg/day for the last 8 weeks prior 
to enrolment with an HbA1c 7.5% to 10.0% will be eligible to enter the study.  The patient 
should maintain the prescribed stable dose of metformin for the duration of the study. 
Visit 1 (Enrolment) should take place approximately [ADDRESS_409119] not be enrolled in the study and will be 
considered screen failures. 
Enrolment (Visit 1) procedures should be scheduled for at least 1 day later than the day of 
informed consent signature [CONTACT_149810] a fasting state on the consent date. 
The following will be performed during this visit: 
1. Informed consent will be obtained. 
2. E-code will be assigned from IVRS/IWRS. 
3. The patient’s demography and complete medical history will be recorded. 
4. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be verified. 
5. A complete physical examination will be conducted (see Section 5.2.2).

4.4 Rescue therapy 
During the double-blind treatment period of the trial, patients may be eligible for treatment 
with open-label rescue medication (see Table 6) to replace their blinded treatment regimen in order to treat ongoing hyperglycaemia.  The sub-sections and table listed below define the 
lack of glycaemic control criteria for initiation of rescue medication. 
Pre-specified glycaemic criteria (see Table 2), based upon repeat confirmatory central 
laboratory FPG have been established during the double-blind treatment period, starting at 
Week 6, to determine eligibility for open-label rescue medication. 
Abbreviations: FPG Fasting plasma glucose 
Patients with a central laboratory FPG value meeting the lack of glycaemic control criterion at 
a pre-specified visit will be scheduled for a follow-up visit (within 3 to 5 days) to obtain a 
second central laboratory FPG value and review the patients glucose meter readings.  If the 
repeat central laboratory FPG value still meets the criterion, the patient must be rescued. 
Patients who meet rescue criteria in the double-blind treatment period must first 
complete the Rescue Visit procedures before receiving open-label rescue medication to 
ensure that important trial endpoint measurements are collected. Table 2 Criteria for Initiation of Rescue Therapy During the Randomised 
Treatment Period

Patients will receive a hypoglycaemia/blood glucose diary.  Glucose meter will be supplied to 
each study site.  Patients will receive a glucose meter, supplies and instructions on their use. 
The Sponsor recommends instructing the patients to self-monitor their blood glucose at least 
one time per day and document results in their patient diary.  Patients should bring their glucose meter with them to each study visit to ensure that it is functioning properly.  Patients 
will be asked to also check their blood glucose when: 
1. The patient experiences signs or symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
2. At additional time points at the Investigator’s discretion which may include change 
of dose of standard of care medications or any other relevant signs or symptoms. 
3. Patients will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_330950] a 
frequent or severe hypoglycaemic event.  Patients will also be instructed to 
document any hypoglycaemia events that have occurred since their last visit.  
Hypoglycaemic events must be recorded in the diary anytime a patient experiences either of the following: 
4. Signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia (regardless of blood glucose value by [CONTACT_330951]). 
5. Blood glucose value by [CONTACT_25877] 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L) (regardless of 
symptoms). 
For these hypoglycaemic events, patients must record the following information in the diary: 1. Date and time of hypoglycaemic event. 
2. Whether symptoms, were present and list of symptoms. 
3. Blood glucose value by [CONTACT_149795]. 
4. Whether the patient experienced incoherence, unconsciousness, or required 
assistance of another person to recover. 
5. Treatments administered. 
Patients should be instructed to document exact date and time of last dose of study medication 
prior to each event.  The diary will be returned by [CONTACT_330952].  Completed diary pages will be added to the patient’s source record, and data from the diary will be entered in the appropriate eCRF page for hypoglycaemic

6.[ADDRESS_409142].  An undesirable medical condition 
can be symptoms (e.g., nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g., tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the 
abnormal results of an investigation (e.g., laboratory findings, electrocardiogram).  In clinical studies, an AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, including 
run-in or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs. 
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring during any study phase (i.e., enrolment and), that 
fulfils one or more of the following criteria: 
1. Results in death 
2. Is immediately life-threatening 
3. Requires in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]  
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions 
5. Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
6. Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.

2. Date Investigator became aware of SAE 
3. AE is serious due to 
4. Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_330918]/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409145] 2016

6. Probable cause of death 
7. Date of death 
8. Autopsy performed 
9. Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s) 
10. Description of AE 
11. Whether treatment of AE was required 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intensity rating scale 
The maximum intensity of an AE will be rated according to the following definition: 
1. Mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated) 
2. Moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities) 
3. Severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_14540] 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. 
6.3.4 Causality collection 
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’ 
For SAEs, causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures.  
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal relationship 
is implied as ‘yes’. 
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study Protocol. 
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms 
All AEs spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_286016]: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409146] 2016 
64 (100) were last asked?’, or revealed by [CONTACT_178557].  
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately. 
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests 
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the 
Clinical Study Report (CSR).  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated 
laboratory values and vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of 
the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP. 
If deterioration in a laboratory values or vital sign is associated with clinical signs and 
symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory 
result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anaemia versus low 
haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant 
deteriorations in non-mandated parameters should be reported as an AE. 
Hyperglycaemia due to insufficient clinical response is not necessarily considered an 
AE/SAE, unless the Investigator does not consider it expected for that patient, based on an 
increased frequency or severity in relation to the patient’s usual clinical course. 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.

hypoglycaemia page of the eCRF.  If the hypoglycaemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_330919], the Investigator is required to contact [CONTACT_1034]. 
Hypoglycemia epi[INVESTIGATOR_330920]. The ADA Workgroup on Hypoglycemia classifies hypoglycemia as follows 
(Elizabeth R. Seaquist et al 2013) 
Severe hypoglycaemia:  An event requiring assistance of another person to actively 
administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions.  These epi[INVESTIGATOR_27982].  Plasma glucose 
measurements may not be available during such an event, but neurological recovery 
attributable to the restoration of plasma glucose to normal is considered sufficient evidence 
that the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
Clinical Study Protocol 
Drug Substance Saxagliptin/Dapagliflozin  
Study Code D1683C00005 Version 4.[ADDRESS_409148] 2016 
65 (100) Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia:  An event during which typi[INVESTIGATOR_330921] a measured plasma glucose concentration less than or 
equal to 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L). 
Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia:  An event not accompanied by [CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_330922] a measured plasma glucose concentration less than or equal to 
70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L).  Since the glycaemic threshold for activation of glucagon and epi[INVESTIGATOR_330923] 65 to 70mg/dL (3.6 to 3.9mmol/L) 
and since antecedent plasma glucose concentrations of less than or equal to 70mg/dL 
(3.9mmol/L) reduce sympathoadrenal responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia, this criterion sets the lower limit for the variation in plasma glucose in nondiabetic, nonpregnant individuals 
as the conservative lower limit for individuals with diabetes. 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia : An event during which symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
are not accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, but was presumably caused by a 
plasma glucose concentration less than or equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). Since many 
people with diabetes choose to treat symptoms with oral carbohydrate without a test of plasma glucose, it is important to recognize these events as probable hypoglycaemia. Such self-
reported epi[INVESTIGATOR_330924] a contemporaneous low plasma glucose 
determination may not be suitable outcome measures for clinical studies that are aimed at evaluating therapy, but they may be reported. 
Relative hypoglycaemia:  An event during which the person with diabetes reports any of the 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_330925], and interprets the symptoms as indicative of 
hypoglycaemia, but with a measured plasma glucose concentration greater than 70mg/dL 
(3.9mmol/L).  This classification reflects the fact that patients with chronically poor 
glycaemic control can experience symptoms of hypoglycaemia at plasma glucose levels greater than 70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L) as plasma glucose concentrations decline toward that 
level.  Though causing distress and interfering with the patient’s sense of well-being, and 
potentially limiting the achievement of optimal glycaemic control, such epi[INVESTIGATOR_330926], therefore, may not be a suitable outcome measure for clinical studies 
that are aimed at evaluating therapy, but they may be reported. 
At a minimum, hypoglycaemic events should be reported in each of the first three 
classifications: severe hypoglycaemia, docu mented symptomatic hypoglycaemia, and 
asymptomatic hypoglycaemia  
6.[ADDRESS_409149], or to the study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. 
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later 
than 24 hours   of when he or she becomes aware of it.

necessary information is provided to the [COMPANY_008] Patient Safety data entry site within [ADDRESS_409151] information for safety 
reporting to the Investigator during site initiation. 
The [COMPANY_008] representative will advise investigators/study site personnel how to proceed.  
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the IB for the [COMPANY_008] 
drug and the EU Summary of Product Characteristics for the active comparator product (including any [COMPANY_008] comparator).

hypoglycaemia, hypersensitivity reactions, severe  cutaneous adverse reactions, all infections, 
decreased lymphocyte count, pancreatitis, all malignancies, cardiac failure (including 
confirmed adjudicated cardiac failure events), renal impairment/renal failure, volume 
depletion (hypotension, dehydration, and hypovolemia), and liver injury(including confirmed adjudicated hepatic events).  
6.5 Overdose 
For the purpose of this study, an overdose is defined as a dose of study medication in excess 
of that specified in the CSP (i.e., more than 1 tablet per day of either study drug) as reported 
by [CONTACT_4676]. 
If an overdose is suspected, monitoring of vital functions as well as treatment as appropriate 
should be performed: 
1. An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the eCRF and on the Overdose eCRF module.   
2. An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose eCRF 
module.

67 (100) If an overdose on an [COMPANY_008] study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the 
Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives 
immediately, or no later than [ADDRESS_409154] interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive 
medication.  Congenital abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be 
reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective 
termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed 
up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate [COMPANY_008] representatives within 1 day i.e., immediately but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
The designated [COMPANY_008] representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for 
SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies. 
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.

6.8.1 Hepatic Adjudication Committee 
An independent Adjudication Committee, blinded to the treatment of the patients, will 
determine the probability that drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the cause of liver-related 
abnormalities. 
Criteria for adjudication of hepatic events are defined as follows: 1. AST and/or ALT >3x ULN and TB >2x ULN  (within [ADDRESS_409156] and/or 
ALT elevation); see Appendix D 
2. AST and/or ALT >10x ULN 
3. Hepatic events timely related to death (within 30 days before death) 
A separate HAC adjudication charter further defines and describes the procedure for the 
handling, reporting and classification of these events. 
6.8.2 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee 
Adjudication for heart failure will be performed using pre-specified criteria by [CONTACT_330953].  The 
adjudication committee operations and criteria will be described in a separate charter.

The study consists of an Enrolment visit (Visit 1), a Randomisation visit (Visit 2), followed by 
a 24-week randomised, double-blind, double-dummy treatment period. 
[COMPANY_008] or a designated representative will provide all IPs.  In the event the patient loses 
her/his study medication, the study center should notify the Investigator immediately in order to receive a replacement kit via the IVRS/IWRS. 
At Visit 2, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 treatment arms and randomised 
study medication will be dispensed in kits as dapagliflozin 5mg tablets, saxagliptin 5mg tablets, and matching placebo tablets.  Study medication will be dispensed according to the 
schedule presented in Table 1. 
During the treatment period, patients will take 2 tablets everyday: 1 from the 
dapagliflozin/placebo bottle, 1 from the saxagliptin/placebo bottle. 
The first doses of study medication will be taken at the study site.  Patients will subsequently 
self-administer saxagliptin, dapagliflozin, and matching placebos QD orally for the 24-week treatment period. 
On days of scheduled study visits, patients should bring their study medication with them to 
the study site and will take that daily dose as directed by [CONTACT_26271]. 
If any dose is missed, it should be taken as soon as noticed, unless it is almost time for the 
next dose, in which case patients should skip the missed dose and take the medicine at the 
next regularly scheduled time.

7.6 Compliance 
The patient will be asked about compliance at each study visit starting from visit 2 onwards. 
When study medication is returned, compliance will be assessed based upon patients interview 
and a count of the tablets returned. Compliance should be between 80% and 120% of that 
prescribed. If the patient is not compliant with recording study drug doses during the study, then the period of non-compliance should be noted as a protocol deviation and the sponsor 
should be notified. Patients judged to be non-compliant may continue in the study, but should 
be counselled on the importance of taking their study medication and applicable ancillary 
medications as prescribed. The Investigator (or designee) will record the amounts of study

8.5 Methods for statistical analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be run for the FA population and for the PP population if more than 
10% of patients from the FA population are excluded from the PP population for important protocol deviations. 
All analyses related glycaemic variables (for example, HbA1c) will be done using values 
regardless of rescue/intensification of treatment or discontinuation of the study treatment.  Sensitivity analyses will be conducted for the primary endpoint excluding the data after rescue 
or more than 8 days after discontinuation of the study treatment. 
The primary endpoint will be tested for saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus saxagliptin and 
dapagliflozin arms simultaneously at the alpha = 0.05 level (two sided).  The secondary 
endpoints then will be tested sequentially as follows: 
1. saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus saxagliptin on percent of patients achieving a 
therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as a HbA1< 7.0% at Week 24 CCI

78 (100) 2. saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus dapagliflozin on percent of patients achieving 
a therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as a HbA1< 7.0% at Week 24 
3. saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus saxagliptin on mean change from baseline in 
fasting plasma glucose at Week 24 
4. saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus dapagliflozin on mean change from baseline in 
fasting plasma glucose at Week 24 
5. saxagliptin plus dapagliflozin versus saxagliptin on  mean change from baseline in 
total body weight at Week 24 
Each comparison will be tested at the alpha = 0.05 (two-sided) level.  
8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s) 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed using a longitudinal repeated measures 
analysis (using a MIXED model) for the change from baseline at Week 24, with terms for 
treatment group, baseline value, time (each relevant visit), the interaction of treatment and time, and the interaction of baseline value and time in the model. This model assumes that 
data are missing at random (MAR). Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be 
calculated for the adjusted mean changes within each treatment group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatment groups. 
8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s) 
The analysis of the change from baseline for FPG and total body weight at week 24 will be 
performed using the same longitudinal repeated measures model as for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The proportion of patients achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response (defined as HbA1c 
<7.0%) at Week 24 will be summarized by [CONTACT_330957].  A 95% confidence interval for the difference in response rate or odd ratio between 
treatment groups will be calculated with adjustment for baseline HbA1c by a logistic 
regression. 
8.5.3 Subgroup analysis (if applicable) 
The subgroup analysis will be performed on the primary efficacy endpoint (mean change from 
baseline in HbA1C) in subgroups defined by [CONTACT_66436]: 
1. Baseline HbA1c 
2. Gender 
3. Age 
4. Region

79 (100) Subgroup analyses will be analysed as was done for the primary analysis model with subgroup 
by [CONTACT_165572].  Within each subgroup, point estimates and 95% confidence 
intervals will be calculated for the adjusted mean changes within each treatment group as well as for the differences in adjusted mean changes between treatment groups.  A nominal 
interaction p-value will be provided for the purpose of the completeness of the data analysis. 
8.5.4 Interim analysis (Not Applicable) 
8.5.5 Sensitivity analysis (if applicable) 
Sensitivity analyses for HbA1c will be performed using analyses that do not assume the data 
are missing at random and incorporate patients randomised and treated but with only baseline 
data for HbA1c. Details will be stated in the SAP. In addition, the repeated measures analyses 
will be performed by [CONTACT_330958], and more than 8 days after study treatment discontinuation and based upon all patients completing the double-blind treatment period.   
8.5.6 Exploratory analysis (if applicable)  
Analyses for exploratory efficacy endpoints will use the same methodology for binary and 
continuous endpoints as described above. 
Safety analyses will be performed using the Safety analysis set, including data after rescue.  
The number and percent of patients with at least one adverse event will be summarized for 
each treatment group, including summaries of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs of special interest.  Summaries will include the number of patients with events by 
[CONTACT_330959].  The summary of AEs will be performed 
both overall and by [CONTACT_6496].  Additionally, the incidence of adverse events and frequency of recurring adverse events will be summarized for each treatment group for both frequent events 
(occurring in at least 5% of patients) and for selected adverse events of special interest. 
Values and changes from baseline at each scheduled time point for clinical laboratory 
parameters and vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, will be summarized by 
[CONTACT_2070].  The number and percent of patients with 
laboratory values meeting marked abnormality criteria will be summarized for each treatment group and by [CONTACT_265558].  Other safety assessments including serum creatinine, and eGFR by 
[CONTACT_330960]. 
Additional analyses for adverse events and laboratory marked abnormalities will be performed 
excluding data after rescue in the double-blind treatment period. The primary analysis of 
events of hypoglycaemia will be performed excluding data after rescue, and more than 4 days after study treatment discontinuation.

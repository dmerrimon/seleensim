doses equal to 5 mg/day, this will be assessed [ADDRESS_381635] dose of benralizumab 
administration and before init iation of the OCS reduction phase).  
First, a screening m ethod wi th morning serum  cortisol  is done (8 -9am morning cortisol level), 
to evaluate whether the patient has:
Normal cortisol levels 
Complete adrenal insufficiency (AI)
Corti sol levels fro m the morning corti sol test that are below normal range and above the 
Com plete AI range are considered “Indeterminate;” and require addit ional testing as described 
below.
Secondly, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulat ion test (i e, Synacthen®, 
Cortrosyn™) is done wit hin approximately [ADDRESS_381636] [see al so Secti on5.2.1.2 for details). The ACTH 
stimulat ion test is more specific than the morning cortiso l test, and ca n determine whether the

Date 17 October 2020
28(157)Duration of treatment
Patients will  start receiving open -label benralizumab at Visit 2 (Week 0) and will enter the [ADDRESS_381645] ion phase, where they will remain stable on their base line OCS dose during this 
period.
The OCS reduction phase will start at Visit 3 (Week 4) and will be completed depending on 
the baseline OCS dose, the occurrence of asthma exacerbat ion or asthma worsening, and the 
integrity of the HPA axis (which will guid e the speed of OCS down -titration for pati ents 
taking doses of <5 mg/day ).  After OCS down -titration, pati ents will  cont inue to receive 
treatm ent wi th benralizumab 30 m g Q8W for approximately  24 to 32 weeks (the maintenance 
phase).  The maintenance phase w ill end with an EOT visit conducted [ADDRESS_381646] 
dose of benralizumab.
The total planned study  durati on is flexible and will vary  for each individual pat ient
depending on the factors previously ment ioned.  The expected durati on can range from 
approximately  32weeks (eg, a pati ent wi th a baseline OCS dose of 5 mg) to approximately 
48weeks (eg, a patient with a baseline OCS dose of 40 mg), assuming the patient has 
completely wi thdrawn OCS wi thout the occurrence of an asthma exacerbat ion, com pletes the 
study , and m orning corti sol levels do not indicate risk for AI.
Study drug , dosage, and mode of administration
Benralizumab 30 mg/mL solution for injection in an accessorized prefilled syringe will be 
administered at the study  center SC Q4W up until the third dose of benralizumab and then 
Q8W thereafter 
([ADDRESS_381647] and 4th benralizumab doses) .
Statistical methods
The study  includes two primary endpoints: 1) Patients who can reduce their daily OCS dose 
by 100% and 2) Patients who can reduce their daily OCS dose by 100% or reduce to a dose 
≤5mg if the reason for no further OCS reduction is AI; both endpo ints to be sustained over at 
least 4 weeks without worsening of asthma.  The proportion and 95% confidence interval for 
each of the primary outcome measures will be est imated for all pat ients in the full analysis set 
and for at least the fo llowing prespeci fied subgroups based on: baseline OCS dose level, 
baseline eosinophil count, and duration of chronic OCS dose.  The endpo ints will be evaluated 
independent ly.  All confidence intervals will be estimated using the Clopper -Pearson exact 
method. 
The full ana lysis set, which will include all pat ients who receive any  dose of benralizumab, is 
defined based on an intent ion-to-treat approach.  All efficacy and safet y analyses will be 
analyzed using the full analysis set.  
The changes in OCS daily  dose, ACQ -6 scor es, and SGRQ scores will be summarized in 
descript ive statistics. Asthma control and SGRQ responders will be summarized in count and 
percentage.

29(157)As thi s study  is primarily descript ive in nature, no statist ical multiplicit y adjustment will be 
made over diff erent endpoints or subgroups.  
As the study  does not include any  predefined confirm atory  tests, the sam ple size is based on 
the abilit y to provi de sufficient precisio n in po int estimates.  The primary outcome, the 
observed proportion of pat ients who succe ssfully  down -titrated thei r doses, i s expected to be 
equal  to or greater than 50%.  A total sample size of 600 patients is expected to provide 95% 
confidence intervals for a single proportion extending approximately 4.1% from the point 
estimate of a 50% success rate.
One interim review may be performed after approximately [ADDRESS_381648] completed (or 
have had the opportunity  to com plete) thei r OCS down -titration; further details will be 
described in a separate interim review plan.
An addit ional databa se lock and analysis of all relevant data collected through the end of the 
OCS reducti on phase, m ay be perf ormed after the final patient has had the opportunit y to 
complete the OCS reduction phase. The purpose of this analysis is to generate a sub -set of  the 
pre-planned analysis outputs of all relevant data for all pat ients up to the end of the OCS 
reducti on phase. Further details will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The 
number and percentage of patients diagnosed with AI will be tabula ted overall  and by  [CONTACT_310392].
The PONENTE long term fo llow up visi t substudy is designed to understand the clinical 
management of OCS and other background asthma maintenance medicat ions in a real -world 
setting fo llowing com pletion of the main tenance phase of PONENTE study .  Outcom e 
measures include the proportion of patients who achieve 100% reduction (and other pre -
defined percentage reductions) in OCS use and other background asthma maintenance 
medicat ions from  the PONENTE baseline to the en d of the PONENTE Long Term Follow 
Up.  Proporti ons will be presented with no minal 95% confidence intervals estimated using the 
Clopper -Pearson exact method.  Results will be presented for all pat ients who si gn inform ed 
consent to continue into the PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up and will be repeated by  
[CONTACT_27178] (i) any bio logic and (ii) commercial Benralizumab during the PONENTE Long

38(157)1. INTRODUCTION
1.[ADDRESS_381662] tightness.  Asthma is a leading cause of morbidit y with a 
global prevalence of approximately 300 million; it is est imated that the number of people with 
asthma m ay increase to [ADDRESS_381663] e worl dwide by 2025 ( Maso li et al 2004).
The current approach to anti -inflammatory  controller ther apy in asthma is based on a 
step-wise intensification of a daily maintenance regimen primarily centered around inhaled 
corticosteroi ds (ICS) and l eukotri ene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), with the addit ion of 
long-acting β 2agoni sts (LABAs) in pat ients withmore severe asthma ( NAEPP 2007, 
GINA 2018).  Approximately 5% to 10% of persons wit h asthma have a severe form of 
disease that is usually  managed wi th high -dose inhal ed glucocorti coids (GCs) and 
bronchodilators ( Bateman et al 2010 , Chung et al 2014).  Wi thin this group, 32% to 45% of 
persons rely on frequent or maintenance use of oral GC therap y (Moore et al  2007 , 
Shaw et 
al2015, Milosl avsky  et al  2017 ).  Bi ologics targeting interleukin -5 (IL -5) and 
immunogl obulin E (IgE) are now included in internat ional treatment guidelines a s an add-on 
treatm ent to pati ents uncontrolled wit h LABA/ICS treatment ( GINA 2018
).
Although oral GC therapy  can be effect ive at treating several infla mmatory  diseases, i t 
adversely  affects heal th-related quali ty of life (Sweeney  et al  2016 ) and i s associ ated wi th 
several side effects, including osteo porosis, hypertensio n, and depressio n (Dinsen et al 2013 ).  
Chronic use of oral GCs suppresses the hypothalamic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal  (HPA) axis ( Broersen 
et al 2015 ) and prevents cortiso l producti on (Neogi et al 2010 , Nicholas et al 2018 ).  Upon 
withdrawal  of GCs, restorati on of  the HPA axis may  take a l onger time, thus l eading to 
adrenal insuffic iency  (AI) in approximately  48.7% of pat ients (Dinsen et al 2013, 
Broersen et 
al 2015 ).  Sym ptoms of AI are nonspecific and can include fat igue and nausea and, in severe 
cases, acute adrenal crisis; however, the suppressio n of a cortiso l-induced stress response can 
be fatal in physio logically  traum atic situat ions such as during surgery, bodily injury, or severe 
systemic infect ions (Alves et al 2008, Dinsen et al 2013, Jo hnson et al 2014, Joseph et 
al2016
).  It i s therefore important to monitor patients for AI while down -titrating their oral  
GC dose, especially once the patient has reached a physio logical dose, which is defined as 
approximately  5mg per day  of oral predniso ne (Alves et al 2008). 
Interl eukin- 5 is a key  cytokine involved in the different iation and maturation of eosi nophils 
from hematopoiet ic stem cells in the bone marrow, their mobilization and migrat ion from the 
bone marrow to the blood, and their activation and survival in t issue ( Blanchard and 
Rothenberg 2009).  The receptor for IL -5 (IL -5Rα [IL -5 receptor alpha subunit]) is 
exclusively  expressed on eosinophils and basophils.
Benralizumab is a humanized, afucosylated, monoclonal ant ibody  that binds specifically to the 
human IL -5Rα on the target cell ( Takatsu et al  1994 , 
Toba et al 1999, Tedeschi et al 2018).

39(157)The purpose of this glo bal study  is to assess the potential for reducing the use of maintenance
oral corti costeroi ds (OCS) in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma who are 
OCS -dependent.  Patients will receive benralizumab [ADDRESS_381664] igators will init iate the tapering of the OCS 
dose while not losing asthma control and managing signs/symptoms of AI.  Primary 
effect iveness will be determined by [CONTACT_310393] 
0mg/day wit hout losing asthma control  or to reach the lowest OCS dose possible in case no 
further OCS down -titration is all owed because of the presence of AI as measured by  [CONTACT_310390]. 
At the end of the PONENTE EOT visit, patients will be invited to participate in a long term 
follow up visi t sub -study  to further assess changes in asthma maintenance therapy  in an a real -
world setti ng, i.e., according to the treatment prescribed by [CONTACT_310394]. 
Addit ionally , there will  be assessment of recovery  from AI as well as assessment of 
glucocorti coid toxicit y by [CONTACT_310376]. See Appendix Kfor details on the background and 
rationale of the PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up visit substudy . 
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses, and control groups
The treatment options for patients who remain uncontrolled on high -dose ICS/LABA are 
extrem ely limited; one of the treatm ent opti ons is the addit ion of OCS to the current treatment 
(GINA 2018).  However, regular intake of OCS can lead to a number of adverse events (A Es) 
and, as a result, can decrease qualit y of life for these patients ( Kwong et al 1987 ).
In the ZONDA study , benralizumab significant ly reduced the m edian final oral GC doses 
from baseline by 75%, as compared wit h a reduction of 25% in the placebo group ( Nairet 
al2017), and 56% of patients who received benralizumab were able to have a 100% reduction 
in their OCS dose.  However, this study  had so me limitations, and there are medical quest ions 
still to be addressed.  Patients who were receiving baseline prednisone doses above 12.5 mg 
were not allowed to completely wit hdraw from OCS as the study duration did not allow for 
this.  Also, the adequacy  of the speed of the OCS dow n-titration and whether i t can be 
perform ed faster than the down -titration regimen used in the ZONDA study  (Nairet al 2017) 
remains unclear.  Finally ,the maintenance phase was limited to [ADDRESS_381665] been on prolonged 
OCS therapy  at baseline may potentially experience secondary  AI upon 
complete/inappropriate withdrawal of OCS due to HPA axis suppressio n.  Patients may also 
experience steroid withdrawal or deprivat ion symptom s and reactivation/relap se of underlying 
disease ( Alves et al 2008
).  This has not y et been evaluated in previous studies.

40(157)≥300 cells/μL in the past [ADDRESS_381667] reduced eosinophils.
The purpose of this trial is to assess the potential for reducing the use of maintenance OCS in 
systemic corticosteroid –dependent asthm a pati ents treated wi th benralizumab 30 mg (who 
have severe refractory  eosinophilic asthma).  This study  will allow pati ents to reduce their 
OCS do se to 0 mg/day or to the lowest OCS dose that is physio logically  possible (given the 
possibilit y of AI in this populat ion of pat ients) and will assess whether a faster OCS 
down -titration com pared wi th what has been previously studied ( Nairet al 2017) i s 
appropriate.  Patients will enter the maintenance phase of approximately 24 to 32 weeks after 
their OCS dose has been reduced to 0 mg/day  (or to the l owest OCS dose possible in case no 
further OCS down -titration is all owed because of the presence of AI as measured by  [CONTACT_310390]), which will assess the abilit y of benralizumab 
to maintain clinical benefit s after OCS withdrawal.  
Patients will  receive open -label benralizumab 30 mg/mL so lution for inject ion in an 
accessorized prefilled syringe (APFS).  It will be administered subcutaneously (SC) at the 
study  site as every -4-week (Q4W) dosing up until the third dos e of benralizumab (Visit s 2 to 
4) and then every -8-week (Q8W) dosing thereafter.  This dose is aligned with the current 
prescribing information for benralizumab, and an open -label design allo ws for a real -world 
assessment of OCS down -titration as i t relates specifically  to benralizumab effect iveness.
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
There are few treatment options for patients whose asthma remains uncontrolled on high -dose 
ICS/LABA ( GINA 2018).  The evidence base for oral add
-on therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (ie, OCS, leukotriene 
inhibitors, and xanthenes) is extremely limited.  Tiotropi[INVESTIGATOR_96812] a long -acting bronchodilator 
that has recent ly been shown to produce improvement in lung funct ion and exacerbation risk 
(pool ed data) in patients with severe asthma, with inconsistent effects on other measures of 
asthma control ( Juniper et al 2005, Juniper et al 2006
, Kerstjen s et al  2012 ).  
Biologics targeting IL -5 and IgE are now included in internat ional treatment guidelines as an 
add-on treatment to patients uncontrolled with ICS/LABA treatment (GINA 2018).  In adult 
patients whose asthma was poorly controlled on high dose ICS/LABA and chronic OCS (with 
or wi thout other controller medicat ions), benralizumab significantly reduced the median OCS 
doses fro m baseline by  75%, as com pared wi th a reducti on of  25% in the oral  GC doses in the 
placebo group.  The odds of a reduction in the oral GC dose were 4.12 times higher with 
benralizumab than with placebo, respectively (P<0.001) ( Nair et al 2017
).
There i s the ri sk of  an asthma exacerbat ion or worsening due to withdrawal o f OCS in 
OCS -dependent patients.  However, data from the ZONDA study  shows benefits in 
exacerbation reduct ion as the rate of exacerbat ions in OCS -dependent asthmat ics treated wi th 
benralizumab who are withdrawn fro m OCS was 70% l ower than the rate in those who are not 
treated with benralizumab (placebo) ( Nair et al 2017 ).

41(157)Development of ant idrug ant ibodies to benralizumab has been documented without an 
apparent clinical impact.  Theoretical risks of developi[INVESTIGATOR_310345] (eg, anaphylaxis or immune co mplex disease) and decreased drug 
efficacy .
Blood eosinophils are a prominent feature of the inflammatory  response to helmint hic 
parasit ic infect ions, and the presence of infiltrat ing eosinophils has been circums tantially 
associ ated wi th a posi tive prognosi s in certain so lid tumors.  Therefore, there is a theoretical 
risk that prol onged eosinophil deplet ion may diminish the abilit y to defend against helmint hic 
parasites or negatively  impact the natural  history  of certain malignant tumors.  Risk 
minimizat ion measures include exclusio n of patients with untreated parasit ic infect ion and 
active or recent malignancy , in conjunct ion with the perform ance of routine 
pharmacovigilance act ivities.
The i dentified (inject ion-site reacti on) and potenti al (hypersensi tivity react ions/anaphylaxis, 
malignancies, and serious infect ions [especially  helmint hic ones]) risks of benralizumab are 
discussed in detail in the latest version of the Investigator’s Brochure.
Furtherm ore, there i s a risk of AI when OCS is completely or inappropriately withdrawn 
(Alves et al 2008 , Dinsen et al 2013 , Johnson et al 2014, Jo seph et al 2016 ) in:
 Patients who are on prolonged OCS therapy .
 Patients who are treated with a high dose of OCS at baseline.
 During periods of stress to the body  when a corti sol-induced response is crit ical to 
maintain homeostasis, eg, during acute intercurrent illness, fo llowing traum a, and 
during surgery  and childbirth.
The symptoms of chronic AI include many nonspecific symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, 
vomiting, abdo minal pain, weakness, tiredness, and depression. In severe cases, a 
life-threatening event of acute adrenal crisis may occur ( Alves et al 2008).  The study  will 
include close mo nitoring of the risk of AI by [CONTACT_310396] y in pat ients who 
have reached OCS doses equal to 5 mg/day  and f or pati ents who have baseline OCS doses 
equal  to 5 m g/day . A detailed assessment of the overall risks/benefits of benralizumab in 
patients wi th asthma is gi ven in the Invest igator’s Brochure.  
1.4 Study design 
This is an open -label, mult icenter study  designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of 
reducing OCS use after init iation of a 30- mg dose of SC benralizumab administered with 
Q4W dosing up unt il the thir d dose of benralizumab (Visits 2 to 4) and then Q8W thereafter in 
approximately  600 adul t pati ents wi th severe eosinophilic asthma who are receiving high -dose 
ICS/LABA and OCS wit h or without additional asthma controller(s).  Each patient must have 
been re ceiving an average daily  dose equivalent to ≥5mg of predniso ne for the l ast 3 m onths 
before study  entry .

Up Substudy .
1.4.1 Enrollment Period (starting Week -2): 
After patients sign the informed consent form (ICF), patients will undergo a Screening visit 
(Visit 1) to assess eligibilit y criteria and l aboratory tests . All pat ients who are not already 
taking predniso ne/predniso lone as their OCS treatment will be switched to 
prednisone/predniso lone, and the l aboratory  tests (including serum prednisone/predniso lone) 
will be delayed 3 to 7 days. Patients who are already  taking prednisone/predniso lone at Visit 1 
do not requi re the serum  prednisone/predniso lone laboratory  test (see Table 1). Addit ionally ,
an extensio n of the screening period up to 3 months is allowed to ensure that a patient 
recovers fro m any asthma exacerbat ion or acute upper/lower respi[INVESTIGATOR_103415] (refer 
Secti on 4.1.1 for more details).  Patients still fulfilling inclusio n/exclusio n criteria at Visi t 2 
(Week 0) will enter the study  and receive open -label benralizumab.
The treatment period is divided into 3 phases: induction, reduction, and maintenance 
(Figure 1).  The durati on of  the benralizumab treatment period will be dependent on the 
baseline OCS dose, the occurrence of asthma exacerbat ion(s) or asthma worsening, and the 
integrity of the HPA axis, which will guide the speed of OCS down -titration below 5 mg/day. 
However benralizumab treatment will start at Visit 2, continue throughout the Reduction phase, 
and will end after 3 doses in the Maintenance Phase.
1.4.2 Induction phase (starting Week 0): 
Patients in the induct ion phase will start their first dose of benralizumab at Visit 2 and should 
remain stable on their baseline OCS dose during this 4 -week phase. If an asthma exacerbat ion 
occurs duri ng the induction phase, the patient will be mana ged per Secti on 5.2.3 .
1.4.3 OCS Reduction phase (Week 4 onwards): 
Benralizumab dosing
Patients will receive Q4W benralizumab up until the 3rddose (8 weeks between 
the 3rdand 4thbenralizumab dose). Benralizumab will then continue Q8W 
through the end of the Reduction phase and continue to the Maintenance phase. 
OCS reduction
Patients will  reduce thei r dosage of OCS according to the schema defined for each baseline 
OCS dose unti l they reach 5 m g/day  (Secti on 5.1.2 ). 
For all patients, hy pothal amic -pi[INVESTIGATOR_2117]-adrenal  (HPA) axis integrit y will be evaluated after 
4-weeks on 5 mg/day and prior to tapering down the OCS dose (for patients with baseline 
OCS doses equal to 5 mg/day, this will be assessed [ADDRESS_381668] dose of 
benralizumab administration and before init iation of the OCS reduction phase)

43(157)First, a screening m ethod wi th mornin g serum  cortisol  is done (8 -9 am morning cortisol 
level), to evaluate whether the patient has:
Normal cortisol levels
Complete AI
Corti sol levels fro m the morning corti sol test that are below normal range and above the 
Com plete AI range are considered “Indeterminate;” and require confirmat ion via addit ional 
testing described below.
Secondly, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulat ion test (i e, Synacthen®, 
Cortrosyn™) is done wit hin approximately [ADDRESS_381669] [see also Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details). The 
ACTH st imulat ion test is more specific than the morning cortiso l test, and can d etermine 
whether the patient has:
Normal cortisol levels
Complete AI
Partial AI.
The OCS reduction will continue unt il the pat ient reaches an OCS dose of 0 mg/day (or 
lowest OCS dose possible in case no further OCS down -titration is allowed because of the 
presence of AI as measured by [CONTACT_310397] l levels or in case of inadequate asthma control) 
without losing asthma control . The fi rst OCS dose reducti on m ay occur at Vi sit 3 af ter the 
dose of benralizumab at the site. Investigators should monitor the occurrence of asthma 
exacerbation(s) or asthma deterioration.  After recovery  from the first exacerbat ion or asthma 
deteri oration, the pati ent will be allo wed to proceed with another attempt to reduce OCS 
dose; however, this must fo llow a l ower speed of OCS down -titration (reducti ons Q4W).  
However, in case of a second exacerbat ion or asthma deterioration, no further OCS dose 
reducti on will be allowed, and the patient will continue on the same OCS dose or will return 
to a one -step hi gher dose l evel (or m ore as conside red necessary  by [CONTACT_24342]), and the 
patient will then enter the maintenance phase. 
Approximately  1-[ADDRESS_381670] (and if required, ACTH st imulation test for indeterminate result) at the end of the OCS 
Reduction phase.
1.4.4 Maintenance phase: 
This phase will start from the time the patient reaches a complete withdrawal o f OCS (or 
lowest possible OCS dose) wi thout worsening o f asthm a control  and as determined by [CONTACT_24338] (based on the cortiso l/ACTH stimulat ion results). The maintenance phase could 
be initiated earlier if OCS dose reduction failed due to clinical deterioration or because the 
patient di d not recover from  AI.

the maintenance treatment phase will depend on when the patient enters the maintenance 
phase relat ive to the dosing cycle of benralizumab. During this phase, patients will continue 
benralizumab Q8W for 3 doses, and then the End of Treatment (EOT) visit will be scheduled 
8 weeks (± 7 days) after the last dose of benralizumab. 
Patients who have Complete AI or Partial AI at the end of the OCS Reduction phase, will 
undergo a final morning cortiso l test (and if required, ACTH stimulat ion test fo r indeterminate 
resul t) approximately  1-[ADDRESS_381671]:

53(157)The Investigators will do the fo llowing:
1. Obtain signed informed consent fro m the potenti al patient before any  study -specific 
procedures are performed
2. Assign each potential pat ient a uni que enrollment number, beginning with ‘E#’ via 
an interactive web/vo ice response system (IWRS/IVRS)
3. Determine patient eligibilit y. See Secti ons 3.1and 3.2
Specific information concerning the use of the IWRS/IVRS will be provided in a separate 
manual. 
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enro llment code cannot be 
reused.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced in the study.
3.[ADDRESS_381690] ensur e all decisio ns are appropriately documented.
3.5 Restrictions
After enro llment, the patient should continue their usual asthma controller medicat ion regimen 
without change during the study .  Any  changes deemed essent ial for pati ent safet y or any  
other reason shoul d be brought to the attention of the Medical Monitor or [COMPANY_008] 
Physician.  The rationale for any  change in the patient’s usual controller medicat ion should be 
docum ented in the source as well as in the medicatio n electronic case report form (eCRF ).  
Asthma exacerbations should be treated with oral or other sy stemic corti costeroi ds according 
to standard practice.  Section 7.8describes the c oncomi tant m edicat ions allo wed and 
prohibited during the study  period.
Treatment with prednisone/predniso lone shoul d be wi thhel d until  the m orning of serum 
cortisol measurement/ACTH stimulation test as defined below: 
 Prednisone/predniso lone:  24 hours pri or to m orning cortisol  level testing
 High-dose ICS:  No ICS (or ICS/LABA if in single inhaler) treatment on the 
morning o f the cortiso l testing
The visit should be rescheduled if the above medications are not withheld properly (note: 
SABA rescue is allowed throughout the study ). Use of  ICS/LABA as a reliever (eg, Symbicort

regimen at baseline is allowed; however, it should also be withheld before cortiso l testing as 
described above. Any  maintenance therapy  such as l ong-acting muscarinic antagonists used 
prior to study  entry  shoul d not be changed during the study .
3.5.1 Other restrictions
 Fertile and sexually act ive pat ients and their partners must use highly effective 
contra ceptive methods throughout the study and at least for 16 weeks (5 half -lives) 
after last administrati on of  the study  drug  
 Patients m ust abstain fro m donating blood or plasma fro m the time of informed 
consent and for 16 weeks (5 half- lives) after last dos e of study  drug
3.6 Discontinuation of study drug and criteria for withdrawal
Patients m ay be di scontinued from study  drug in the fo llowing si tuations:
 Patient deci sion—the patient i s free at any  time to di scontinue treatm ent, wi thout 
prejudice to further treatm ent
 Severe nonco mpliance with the Clinical Study  Protocol  
 Eligibilit y requirement found not to be fulfilled
 Pregnancy
 AE that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n of the Invest igator, contraindicates further dosing
 Lost to follow -up when the fo llowing three attem pts at contact [CONTACT_310406]:
- Three (3) attempts of either phone calls, faxes, or emails
- Having sent 1 registered letter/certified mail
- One unsuccessful effort to check the vital status of the patient using publicly 
available sources, if allowed by  [CONTACT_4159] 
 Development of any study -specific criteria for discontinuat ion:
- Anaphylactic reaction to the study  drug
- Development of helmint h parasit ic infestations requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
- An asthma -related event requiring mechanical ventilat ion
3.6.1 Procedures for disc ontinuation of a patient from study drug 
A pat ient who decides to discont inue study  drug will  always be asked about the reason(s) and 
the presence o f any A Es.  
All patients who prematurely discontinue study  drug shoul d return to the study center and 
complete the procedures described for the IPD visit within 4 weeks (± 7 days) after last study  
drug administration.  The reason for premature discontinuat ion of study  drug shoul d be

to return to the study  center one last time at 12 weeks (± 7 days) after the last dose of study  
drug for final study -related assessments (see Table 1).
3.6.2 Screen failures 
Screen failures are patients who do not fulfill the inclusion criteria (see Sect ion 3.1) or who 
meet an exclusio n criterion (see Secti on 3.2) during the enro llment period.  These patients 
shoul d have the reason for study  withdrawal  recorded as ‘screen failure’ ( the potential pat ient 
does not m eet one or m ore cri teria requi red for parti cipat ion in a trial; this reason for study 
withdrawal  is only valid for not enrolled patients). 
3.6.3 Withdrawal of informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study  at any t ime (study  drug and assessments), without 
prejudice to further treatment.
A pat ient who wi thdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of 
any A Es.  The Invest igator will fo llow up A Es outsi de of  the clinical study . The pati ent will 
return the electronic patient -reported outcome device (ePRO).
If a patient withdraws fro m participat ion in the study , then his/her enrollment code cannot be 
reused.  Withdrawn patients will not be replaced. 
If the patient agrees, he/she will be asked to return to the study  site to com plete procedures 
described for the IPD visit and fo llow-up visi ts (Table 1).
[IP_ADDRESS] Withdrawal of consent for genetic research 
Patients m ay withdraw from  this genet ic research at any t ime, independent of any decisio n 
concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main study .  Vol untary  withdrawal will  not 
prejudice further treatment.
3.[ADDRESS_381691] udy may be stopped if, in the judgment of [COMPANY_008], trial patients are placed at 
undue risk because o f clinically significant findings that:
 Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414] 
 Are assessed as causally related to s tudy drug
 Are not considered to be consistent with cont inuat ion of the study
Regardless of the reason for terminat ion, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuat ion of fo llow-up m ust be recorded in the eCRF. 
In terminat ing the study, t he Sponsor will ensure that adequate considerat ion is given to the 
protecti on of  the pati ents’ interests.

4.1.1 Screening visit –Visit 1 (Week -2)
Each patient will provide written informed consent prior to any  study -specific procedures and 
will undergo assessments applicable for each visit as outlined in Table 1.  Registration of the 
patient’s enrollment via IWRS/IVRS should occur on the day  that Visi t 1 procedures are 
perform ed.
At screening, consent ing patients will be assessed to ensure that they meet all eligibilit y 
criteria.  Vi sit 1 assessments are primarily  concerned wi th assessment of eligibilit y 
(inclusio n/exclusion criteria), including asthma disease state, requisite level o f severit y based 
on background medicat ions and eosinophil count.
Dem ographic informat ion, including date of birth, age, sex, race, and ethnicit y, will be 
collected during the screening visit as per local regulat ions.  All pat ients who are not already  
taking predniso ne/predniso lone as their OCS treatment will be switched to 
prednisone/predniso lone. Testing o f prednisone/predniso lone levels will be done only  for 
patients who swi tch to predni sone/predniso lone. If thi s test i s requi red, all laboratory  tests 
shoul d be delayed by 3 to 7 days after having switched the OCS (Appe ndix F).  
Prednisone/predniso lone levels should be measured approximately 1 to 2 hours after 
prednisone/predniso lone intake on the same day.
At the screening visit, blood sam ples will  be collected for assessments such as laboratory  
tests, genomic analysis, serum bio markers, total IgE, Phadiatop test, EDN, eosinophil count, 
etc., as m entioned in Table 1.  Current, regular use of a high -dose ICS and LABA for 
≥6months prior to enrollment will be recorded.  Addit ionally , pati ents m ust be on chroni c 
daily  OCS therapy  (equivalent to ≥5 mg/day of prednisone) for ≥[ADDRESS_381699] approved maintenance dose in the local 
country  (Inclusio n Cri terion 6).  A stable dose of OCS must have been maintained for 
≥4weeks prior to Visit 1.
Patients can proceed direct ly to Visit 2 once central laboratory results are received, and all 
eligibilit y requi rements are confi rmed.  Vi sit 2 should be done up to 2 weeks after Visit 1. For 
patients swi tching to predni sone/predniso lone at V1 and who thus require a delay in 
laboratory  tests, Vi sit [ADDRESS_381700] ion of laboratory  samples. 
Patients will  cont inue to rec eive treatment with their current ICS/LABA and other 
controller(s) (if applicable) with no changes.
If the patient experiences an asthma exacerbation during screening that requires evaluat ion in 
an urgent care center or emergency  depart ment, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5186] n, or temporary  increase 
(bolus/burst) of systemic steroids, they will not be screen failed, but an extensio n of the 
screening period up to 3 months will be allowed to ensure that the patient recovers fro m the 
asthma exacerbation and the OCS dose is stabil ized. Addi tionally , if a patient experi ences

up to 3 months wil l be allowed. If the patient recovers fro m the asthma exacerbat ion or acute 
upper/l ower respi [INVESTIGATOR_310351] ≥2weeks, then the patient will be allo wed 
to con tinue in the study .  Pati ents m ust enter the treatm ent phase wi thin 3 m onths of
screening; if it has been longer than 3 months, then the patient may  be rescreened.
If the patient experiences a non- asthma related event requiring temporary  increase 
(bolus/burst) of systemic steroids, an extensio n of the screening period of up to 3 mont hs m ay 
be allowed (AZ study  physician can be consulted if required).
Patient’s eligibilit y shoul d be evaluated at the screening visit with the relevant documentation 
entered in the source and eCRF.
4.1.2 Rescreening
Rescreening of pat ients for any  reason will  beallowed only  once f or each pati ent and only  
upon approval o f the [COMPANY_008] Physician.  Patients will keep the same e -code.
4.2 Open -label treatment period
The open -label treatm ent peri od is divided into 3 phases based on the OCS dose adjustment: 
induct ion phase (Section 4.2.1 ), reduction phase (Section 4.2.2), and maintenance phase 
(Secti on 4.2.3 ).  Patients will co mplete the ACQ -6 and maintenance medicat ion assessment 
weekly using the eP RO throughout the treatment period (see Section 5.3.4 for details).
4.2.[ADDRESS_381701] ion phase will start at Visit 2 (Week 0) and will continue until the day prior to Visit 
3.  Inclusio n and exclusio n criteria will  be confi rmed at Visi t [ADDRESS_381702] ion 
phase only, patients will co mplete the Patient Global Assessment of Change (PGIC) on a 
weekly basis on the ePRO in addit ion to weekly complet ion of the ACQ- [ADDRESS_381703] dose of the study  drug will  be administered SC as 
Q4W dosing at Visit 2.  Patients will be observed at the site for 2 hours after dosing.  During 
this time, patients will remain on their regular asthma controller medicat ions, and no dose 
adjustm ents to OCS will be made.  Patients who experience asthma exacerbat ions that require 
evaluat ion in an urgent care center or emergency department, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094], or tem porary  
increase of systemic steroids (bo lus/burst dosing) will be managed as per Section 5.2.3 .  
4.2.2 OCS Reduction phase
The reduction phase will start at Visit 3 (Week 4) after the dose of benralizumab, and 
subsequent OCS dose reductions will occur according to the schema defined for each baseline 
OCS dose until pat ients reach a 5 mg/day dose ( Table 2).

64(157)The study  drug will be administered SC as Q4W dosing up unt il the third dose of 
benralizumab (therefore at Visits 3 and 4 during the OCS reduction phase) and then Q8W 
thereafter (8 weeks between the 3rdand 4thbenraliz umab dose). Pati ents will be observed at 
the site for [ADDRESS_381704] 3 study drug administrations (therefore at Visits 3 
and 4 during the OCS reduction phase) and for 1 hour after subsequent study drug 
administrations for any  acute drug reactions.
For all patients, HPA axis integrit y will be evaluated after 4 -weeks on 5 mg/day and prior to 
tapering down the OCS dose (for patients with baseline OCS doses equal to 5 mg/day, this 
will be assessed [ADDRESS_381705] dose of be nralizumab administration and before 
initiation of the OCS reduction phase)
First, a screening m ethod wi th morning serum  cortisol  is done (8 -9 am morning cortisol level), 
to evaluate whether the patient has:
Normal cortisol levels
Complete AI
Corti sol levels from the morning corti sol test that are below normal range and above the 
Com plete AI range are considered “Indeterminate;” and require addit ional testing described 
below.
Secondly, the ACTH stimulat ion test (i e, Synacthen®, Cortrosyn™) is done within 
approximately  [ADDRESS_381706] [see also Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details). The ACTH st imulation test i s more specific 
than the morning cortiso l test, and can determine whether the patient has:
Normal cortisol levels
Complete AI
Partial AI
Dose reduction of OCS should be interrupted if the patient suffers an asthma exacerbat ion 
(Secti on 5.2.3 ) or in case the Invest igator considers the patient to be having a significant 
deteri oration of  his/her asthma disease (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).  After the OCS bolus/burst to treat an 
exacerbati on is com pleted, or after recovery  from an asthma deterioration, the Invest igator 
may eit her return the OCS dose to a one -step hi gher dose l evel (or m ore if considered 
necessary  by [CONTACT_24342]) than what was prescribed when the exacerbat ion or asthma 
worsening occurred or continue wit h the same OCS dose, which must be maintained at a

that it will  not be used to impute the baseline value for ACQ- 6 analysis). Invest igators should 
consider this informat ion together with an y other inform ation reported by  [CONTACT_310408]/symptom s of the disease as well as compliance with maintenance asthma therapy .  
Based on the totalit y of the informat ion, invest igators can decide whether the patient can 
continue wit h the OCS dose reductio n unt il the patient reaches an OCS dose of 0 mg/day (or 
lowest OCS dose possible in case no further OCS down -titration is allowed because of the 
presence of AI as measured by [CONTACT_310397] l levels or in case of inadequate asthma control) without 
losing asthma co ntrol.  The other patient -reported outcomes (PROs) will be carried out per the 
schedule in Table 1.
The l ength of the benralizumab treatment period wi ll depend on the baseline OCS dose, 
occurrence of asthma exacerbation(s) or asthma worsening, and whether the patient 
experiences AI.  Procedures specific for the visits are listed in Table 1.  Restri ctions as set out

4.2.3 Maintenance phase
A pat ient will enter the approximately 24 -to 32 -week maintenance phase when they reach an 
OCS dose of 0 mg/day (or lowest OCS dose possible in case no further OCS down -titration is 
allowed because of the presence of AI as measured by  [CONTACT_310409] i nadequate

fails due to clinical deterioration or if the pat ient experiences an asthma exacerbation. The 
durati on of  the m aintenance phase will depend on when the pat ient enters the maintenance 
phase relat ive to the dosing cycle of benralizumab. During this phase, patients will continue 
benralizumab Q8W for 3 doses and then the EOT visit will be scheduled 8 weeks (± 7 days) 
after the l ast dose of benralizumab (assessme nts performed as per Table 1). However, if 
during thi s peri od, the pati ent experiences asthma deterioration or an exacerbat ion, the l ength 
of the m aintenance phase will not be extended and the patient will continue on 3 doses of 
benralizumab Q8W. Addit ionally  increases in the maintenance OCS dose due to an asthma 
exacerbation is permitted per investigator discret ion.  Patients who experience an asthma 
exacerbation that requires evaluat ion in an urgent care center or emergency depart ment, 
hospi [INVESTIGATOR_28689], or tem porary  increase of systemic steroids (bo lus/burst dosing) will be 
managed as per details in Sect ion5.2.[ADDRESS_381711] (and if required, ACTH stimulat ion test for indeterminate 
resul t) approximately  1-2 weeks pri or to end of the OCS Maintenance phase (prior to EOT 
visit).
Patients will  return the ePRO at the EOT visit.  Complet ion of the treatment will be registered 
in IWRS/IVRS at the EOT visit for each patient. After stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] s tudy drug, the pati ent will be

5.1 Efficacy assessments
5.1.1 Assessment of OCS dose
All patients who meet eligibilit y criteria and enter the study  will receive open -label 
benralizumab and reduce their OCS dose until the patient reaches an OCS dose of 0 mg/day 
(or lowest OCS dose possibl e in case no further OCS down -titration is allowed because of the 
presence of AI as measured by [CONTACT_310397] l levels or in case of inadequate asthma control) as per 
the details provided in Sect ion 4.2.[ADDRESS_381715] igator discretion.
Clinical Study Protoco l

Date 17 October 2020
69(157)All OCS dose changes will be documented in the source documentation and recorded in the 
appropriate eCRF form.  Moreover, in case o f OCS reducti on being tem porarily in terrupted 
(in case of an exacerbat ion or asthma deterioration) or permanent ly int errupted (exacerbation, 
asthma deterioration, AI based on cortiso l tests, or occurrence of an adrenal crisis), the reason 
shoul d be docum ented in the appropriate eCRF, and red uction will be done slowly as per 
Table 3.
5.1.2 OCS dose titration
At Visit 1, patients will continue with or be switched to prednisone/predniso lone.  For p atients 
not previously receiving predniso ne/predniso lone as OCS, the conversio n table shown in 
Appendix Fwill be used to cal culate the equivalent prednisone/predniso lone dose for dose 
titration.
The OCS dose titration in the reduct ion phase will be fo llowed as per Table 2depending on 
the init ial OCS dose and HPA axis evaluat ion. If Table 2instructs to reduce dose by 5mg 
increments, but the init ial OCS dose is <[ADDRESS_381716] dosing level: The 1streducti on 
woul d be smaller, rounding down to the nearest 5 mg, then continue on with 5 mg Q2W 
reducti ons (examples below):
e.g. 12.5 →10 mg →etc.
e.g 23 →20→15→10 mg →etc.
e.g. 19 →15→10 mg →etc.
If Table 2instructs to reduce the init ial dose by 2.5mg increments, but the init ial dose i s 
<2.5m g to the next dosing level: The 1streduct ion would be smaller, rounding down to the 
nearest 2.5m g, then continue on with 2.5 Q4W reductions (examples below):
e.g. 8 →7.5→5→etc.  
e.g. 6.25 →5→etc.
For all patients, HPA axis integrit y will be evaluated after 4 -weeks on 5 mg/day and prior to 
tapering down the OCS dose (for patients with baseline OCS doses equal to 5 m g/day , this 
will be assessed [ADDRESS_381717] dose of benralizumab administration and before 
initiation of the OCS reduction phase)
First, a screening m ethod wi th morning serum  cortisol  is done (8 -9 am morning cortisol level), 
to evaluate whe ther the pati ent has:
• Normal cortisol levels
• Complete adrenal insufficiency (AI)
Corti sol levels fro m the morning corti sol test that are below normal range and above the 
Com plete AI range are considered “Indeterminate,” and require addit ional testing descr ibed 
below.

70(157)Secondly, the ACTH stimulat ion test (i e, Synacthen®, Cortrosyn™) is done within 
approximately  [ADDRESS_381718] [see also Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details). The ACTH st imulation test i s more specific 
than the morning cortiso l test, and can determine whether the patient has:
• Normal cortisol levels
• Complete AI
• Partial AI.
Invest igators may a lso choose to slow the down -titration to 1 m g Q4W once the pati ent 
reaches a OCS dose of 5 mg/day  based on pati ent symptom s alone regardl ess of cortisol  
levels.  Once there is evidence of recovery , OCS reducti on will cont inue unt il the patient 
reaches an O CS dose of 0 mg/day  (or l owest OCS dose possible in case no further OCS 
down -titration is allowed because of the presence of AI as measured by  [CONTACT_310415]) without losing asthma control.

[IP_ADDRESS] Asthma worsening or asthma exacerbation preventing OCS down -titration 
The OCS dose titration will be interrupted in case of one of the fo llowing circumstances 
related to the asthma condit ion:
 Asthma deterioration will be assessed by [CONTACT_310417] -6 scores of ≥0.[ADDRESS_381729] -Visit 2 and pre -OCS reduction may be used as 
baseline value for the 0.5 -point increase (note, however, that it will not be used to 
impute the baseline for ACQ -6 analysis). The Investigator will decide whether the 
worsening of asthma should lead to an interru ption in tapering of OCS dose until 
asthma control improves.  
 In case of an asthma exacerbat ion that requires treatment with systemic 
corticosteroi ds for at l east [ADDRESS_381730] asthma deterioration o r exacerbat ion, pati ents will be offered to 
continue OCS tapering down at a slower speed (ie, Q4W); however, in the case of a second 
event of asthma deterioration or exacerbation, the OCS reduction will be stopped.
The l ower OCS dose (0 m g or above, if required to control asthma disease) that is not changed 
during a period of 4 weeks and that ensures a patient does not suffer from an asthma 
exacerbation or that avo ids the occurrence of an asthma deterioration/worsening requiring an 
increase in OCS dose, bas ed on invest igator criteria, will be considered the final OCS dose of 
the OCS reduction phase, and, thereafter, the patient will init iate the OCS maintenance phase 
on that OCS dose.
5.2 Safety assessments
5.2.1 HPA axis evaluation
For all patients, HPA axis integrit y will be evaluated after 4 -weeks on 5 mg/day and prior to 
tapering down the OCS dose (for patients with baseline OCS doses equal to 5 mg/day , this 
will be assessed [ADDRESS_381731] dose of benralizumab administration and before 
initiation of the OC S reduction phase)
First, a screening m ethod wi th morning serum  cortisol  is done (8 -9 am morning cortisol level),

symptoms of AI, then OCS down -titration shoul d continue at a sl ower pace 
(1mgQ4W).  
 If corti sol levels are below the normal range and above the complete AI range 
(indeterminate result), then the patient will be instructed to maintain the current 
OCS dose and come back to the s ite within [ADDRESS_381736] 
(Secti on5.2.1.2 )
 If co mplete AI i s confirmed, sites will inform pat ients that the OCS dose will

the com plete AI wi thout worsening of asthma control.  The morning cortiso l test 
will be repeated [ADDRESS_381737] (see Table 1). After the repeat 
morning corti sol test, the si te will inform the pat ient based on the results as follows:
-If morning cortiso l resul ts at 3 m onths indicate normal cortisol values, then 
reducti ons will  be 2.5 m gQ4W, and the patient would subsequently mo ve to 
maintenance phase at OCS 0mg (or lowest possible dose)
-If morning cortiso l tests at [ADDRESS_381738]:
If normal result after ACTH stimulat ion: Reduce by  2.5mg Q4W then 
move to m aintenance phase at 0mg (or lowest possible dose)
If the result is Partial AI after ACTH stimulat ion: Reduce by 1mg Q4W 
then move to m aintenance phase at 0mg (or lowest possible dose)
If co mplete AI result after ACTH stimulat ion: OCS dose will not be 
reduced further, move to maintenance phase at current OCS dose
-If morning cortiso l tests again indicate complete AI at 3 months, the OCS dose 
will not be modified as this is the final attempt. The patient would mo ve to 
maintenance phase at OCS 5mg (or lowest possible dose). 
Patients who have Partial AI will undergo an additio nal morning corti sol test (and if required, 
ACTH st imulat ion test for indeterm inate result) approximately  1-[ADDRESS_381739] (and if required, ACTH 
stimulat ion test for indeterminate resul t) approximately 1 -2 weeks pri or to the end of the

5.2.2 Assessment of asthma exacerbations
During the study , an asthma exacerbat ion will be defined as a worsening of asthma symptoms 
that leads to any  of the f ollowing:
 A tem porary  bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids (at a dose above one level 
higher than the current titration step) for at least 3 consecut ive days to treat 
symptoms of asthma worsening; a single depo -injectable dose of corticosteroids 
will be considered equivalent to a 3 -day bolus/burst of systemic corticosteroids. 
Note: Per -protocol up-titration of  the OCS dose to one level higher is not 
necessarily considered to be an exacerbat ion event
-Patients who experience an exacerbation during the screening period (between 
Visits 1 and 2) can be granted an extensio n of the screening period to ensure that a 
patient recovers from  an asthma exacerbat ion and the OCS dose is stabilized.  
 An emergency  room  or urgent care visit (defined as evaluat ion and treatment for 
<24 hours in an emergency  depart ment or urgent care center) due to asthma that 
requi red systemic corticosteroids (as per the above)
 Inpat ient hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094] (defined as admissio n to an inpatient facilit y and/or 
evaluat ion and treatment in a healt hcare facilit y for ≥24 hours) due to asthma
The Investigator must justify the decisio n for defining an event of worsening asthma as an 
exacerbation and record it in the source documents and eCRF.  An asthma exacerbation that 
occurs within [ADDRESS_381747] should be obtained for exacerbat ions evaluated 
and treated at non -study  sites (eg, by  [CONTACT_310419]/hospi [INVESTIGATOR_307]).  Details shoul d be entered into the exacerbation eCRF in a timely  
fashio n.  Changes in conco mitant m edicati ons due to exacerbat ions must be recorded in the 
appropriate module of the eCRF.

80(157)5.2.3 Management of asthma exacerbations during treatment period
Patients who experience an exacerbation during the treatment period may remain on t he study 
drug at the Investigator’s discret ion.  Asthma exacerbat ions will be treated with oral or other 
systemic corticosteroids according to standard clinical practice.
 Induction phase: If a patient experiences an exacerbat ion during the induct ion 
phase, the start of the OCS dose reductions may be delayed.  After the OCS 
bolus/burst to treat an exacerbation is co mplete, the patient may be returned to a 
one-step hi gher dose l evel (or m ore if considered necessary  by [CONTACT_24342]) 
than what was prescribe d when the exacerbat ion occurred.  The Invest igator may 
decide to m aintain the same OCS dose.  The patient’s OCS dose should be stable 
for at least two weeks before entering the OCS reduction phase 
 Reduction phase: If a patient experiences an exacerbat ionduring the reduction 
phase, the Investigator may  do one of the following for at least two weeks after 
completion of the OCS bo lus/burst:
-The patient may  be returned to a one -step hi gher dose l evel (or m ore if 
considered necessary  by [CONTACT_24342]) than what was prescribed when the 
exacerbation occurred 
or
-The same OCS dose may be maintained at a stable dosage and then OCS 
down -titration may  be cont inued once the patient recovers from the 
exacerbation
Further dose reductions during this phase will be consi dered as per the 
Invest igator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_3078] n.  After recovery  from the fi rst exacerbat ion, the pati ent will 
be allowed to proceed with another attempt to reduce their OCS dose; however, 
they woul d follow a l ower speed of OCS down -titration (reducti ons ever y 4 weeks) 
(Table 3).
In case of a second exacerbat ion, no further OCS dose reduction will be allowed, 
and the patient will cont inue the same dose or w ill return to a one- step hi gher dose 
level (or more as considered necessary  by [CONTACT_11856]) than what was 
prescribed when the exacerbation occurred.  The patient will then enter the 
maintenance phase and continue the same dose through the end of study .
 Maintenance phase: If a patient experiences an exacerbat ion during the 
maintenance phase, the length of the maintenance phase will not be extended; and 
the pati ent will continue on 3 doses of benralizumab Q8W. After the OCS 
bolus/burst is co mplete, the p atient may then be returned to a one -step hi gher dose 
level (or more if considered necessary by  [CONTACT_11856]) than the OCS dose they  
were on when the exacerbat ion occurred, or the Investigator may  deci de to m aintain 
the sam e OCS dose throughout the mai ntenance phase.

finding(s), judged as clinically significant by  [CONTACT_11856], will  be reported as A Es as 
described in Section 6.1.
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete physical examination
The complete physical examinat ion will include an assessment of the following: general 
appearance, skin, head and neck (including eyes, ears, no se, mouth, and throat), lymph nodes, 
abdo men, muscul oskeletal  (incl uding spi[INVESTIGATOR_271002]), cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] , and 
neuro logical systems.
[IP_ADDRESS] Brief physical examination
The brief physical examinat ion will  include an assessment of the general appe arance, 
abdo men, cardi ovascular, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517] . For the bri ef physical  examinat ion, only 
inform ation on whether the assessment was performed or not is to be recorded.
5.2.6 Vital signs
Predose vi tal signs (pul se, bl ood pressure [BP], respi [INVESTIGATOR_96683]), will be 
recorded according to the schedule provided in Table 1. 
The vital signs will be recorded prior to blood draw, administration of study  drug, and, if 
possible, administration of usual asthma controller medicat ion. 
Pulse rate and BP should be measured after the patient has been rest ing for at least 5 minutes. 
The m easurement will be taken in sitting posit ion. Pul se rate will be obtained before BP.
Body  temperature will be measured in Celsius before administration of study  drug and in 
accordance with local standards.
5.2.7 Glucocorticoid toxicity index
Glucocorti coidtoxicity index will be assessed as described by [CONTACT_310420]  2017 (see 
Appendix Hfor details).  The composite GTI captures commo n GC toxicit ies that are 
sensit ive to differing cumulat ive GC doses over the period of a ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_310355] (6 m onths 
to 3years).  The individual items within the GTI are weighted relat ive to each other for 
severit y, and the instrument has the capabilit y of measuring not only worsening of GC toxicit y 
from baseline, but also improvement.
The composite GTI measures change in GC toxicit y rather than absol ute GC toxicit y in order 
to account for the effects of prior GC therapy .  Scoring shoul d be perform ed as per the 
schedule of assessments, using entry  assessment as the baseline.  The GTI items were ranked 
in order of severit y within each domain.  The relat ive weights for each toxicit y item were 
derived using mult icriteria decisio n analysis.  Multicriteria decisio n analysis has been used for

including rheumatoid arthri tis (Neogi  et al  2010 ), systemic sclerosis ( Johnson et al 2014), and 
systemic lupus ery thematosus ( Tedeschi et al 2018).
The composite GTI will be assessed at the time points given in Table 1.  Only  a subset of 
items fro m the com posite GTI will  be assessed in PONENTE: body  mass index, glucose 
tolerance (glycosylated hemoglobin), BP, low -densit y lipoprotein, steroid my opathy , skin 
toxicity, neuropsy chiatri c toxi city, and infecti on (items f rom the Specific List will not be 
assessed).
5.3 Other assessments
5.3.1 Weight and height
Weight and height will be measured according to the schedule provided in Table 1. Hei ght 
will be taken at screening Visit 1 only. The pat ient’s weight will be recorded in kilograms, and 
height in cent imeters. Weight and height mea surements will be performed in light clothing 
and wit h shoes off.
5.3.2 Prednisone/Prednisolone levels
For pati ents who swi tch to predni sone/predniso lone only , a prednisone/predniso lone test will 
be done with V1 laboratory  work. For these patients, the site shou ld delay the laboratory  test 
(for all parameters, not just prednisone/predniso lone levels) by 3 to 7 days after the patient has 
switched thei r OCS.  Im portantly, prednisone/predniso lone levels should be measured 1 to 
2hours after prednisone/predniso lone intake on that day  to ensure levels are detectable. This 
test i s not requi red for pati ents entering the study  on predniso ne/predniso lone.

5.3.4 Clinical outcome assessments
[IP_ADDRESS] Patient -reported outcomes
Patient-reported outcomes data will be captured electronically using a handheld device 
(ePRO).  Site personnel will be trained on using the ePRO.  Detailed procedures for using the 
ePRO and training the patients will be described in a separate instruction manual.  Patients 
will be trained on at- home use of the ePRO at Visit 2.  Training will include explanat ion of 
device funct ionality and i ts proper use.  Patients will also be asked to verify completion of 
training on the ePRO.  Patients will be asked to bring the device back at each study  visit.  
On-site PRO quest ionnaires should be completed prior to any  other assessments.  Data fo r all 
PROs will be collected in accordance wit h Table 1.  Patients should be informed that the 
recording made electronically cannot be retrospectively or prospectively  entered and m ust be 
completed wi thin a defined time window.  Patients will also be provided wit h informat ion 
about when and where to request help if problems occur.  The Invest igator/authorized delegate

84(157)will check the patient’s adherence t o complet ing the ePRO as described in Table 1. There will 
be tri ggers in the PROs to alert invest igators to signs o f worsening o f asthma and advising 
them to contact [CONTACT_310421].  These alerts will be described in a separate guide.  
Asthma Control Questionnaire 6
The ACQ- 6 is a shortened version o f the ACQ that assesses asthma symptoms (nighttime 
waking, symptoms on waking, activit y limitation, shortness of breath, wheezing, and use of 
short -acting β 2agoni sts), omitt ing the forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_4034] 1second measurement 
from the original  ACQ score.
Patients will  be asked to recall how their asthma has been during the previous week by

uncontrolled).  The mean ACQ -6 score is the m ean of the responses.  Mean scores of ≤0.75 
indicate well -controlled asthma, scores between 0.75 and ≤1.5 indicate partly  controlled 
asthma, and scores >1.5 indicate not well -controlled asthma ( Juniper et al 2006).  Individual 
changes of ≥0.5 are considered to be clinically  meaningful .
From  Visi t 2 onwards, the pati ent will co mplete the ACQ
-6 at hom e every  1 week (± 2 day s) 
until the EOT visit.  The ePRO device will be set up with functionalit y to collect unscheduled 
ACQ -[ADDRESS_381751] igators at a visit.
At each clinic/phone call visit, in addit ion to the informat ion provi ded by  [CONTACT_310422]/her asthma disease, investigators will have access to the patient’s ACQ -6 scores 
(completed by  [CONTACT_310423]) to evaluate whether the patient’s condit ion has not 
significant ly deteriorated (ie, increase in score of ≥0.5 from  baseline [baseline defined as 
value at Visit 2 before benralizumab administration]) and take the final decisio n to further 
reduce the OCS dose until the pat ient reaches an OCS dose of 0 mg/day (or lowest OCS dose 
possible in case no further OCS down -titration is all owed because of the presence of AI as 
measured by [CONTACT_310424]) while not losing asthma 
control .
St. George’s Respi[INVESTIGATOR_310356] a 50- item PRO instrum ent devel oped to m easure the healt h status of subjects 
with airway obstructi on diseases ( Jones et al  1991 ).  The questionnaire is divided into 2 parts: 
Part 1 consists of 8 items that pertain to the severit y of respi [INVESTIGATOR_29197] s in the preceding 
4 weeks, and Part 2 consists of 42 items relat ed to the daily  activity and psychosocial impacts 
of the individual’s respi[INVESTIGATOR_244851].  The SGRQ yields a total score and 3 domain scores 
(symptom s, activit y, and impacts).  The total score indicates the impact of disease on overall 
healt h status.  T his total score is expressed as a percentage of overall impairment, in which 
[ADDRESS_381752] possible healt h status.  
Likewise, the dom ain scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat ive of greater 
impairment.  Specific details on the scoring algorithms are provided by [CONTACT_310425] a user 
manual ( Jones et al  2009 ).  A decrease of 4 units in the SGRQ total score has been established

those wi th ≥4-unit decreases in SGRQ total score. 
The SGRQ will be completed on site at the beginning of Visit 2 and EOT/IPD Visit using the 
ePRO. 
Maintenance medication adherence assessment
Adherence wit h maintenance medicat ion over the past week will be captur ed using a single 
question that asks the respondent to report the number of days they took their maintenance 
medicat ion per thei r physician’s instructions .  Patients will respond to the maintenance 
medicat ion query  on a weekly (± 2 days) basis using the eP RO beginning at Visit 2 and 
ending at EOT/IPD Visit.
Patient Global Impression of Change assessment
The PGIC instrument is used for an overall evaluatio n of response to treatment.  The patient 
will be asked to rate the degree of change in the overall asthm a status com pared to the first 
dosing using the fo llowing 7 -point scale: Much Better (+3), Moderately Better (+2), A Little 
Better (+1), About the Same (0), A Little Worse ( -1), Moderately Worse ( -2), and Much 
Worse (-3).  
The PGIC will be captured at Vis it 2 as well as weekly (± 2 day s) until the end of the

All AEs will  be recorded in the eCRF.  The fo llowing vari ables will be collected for each AE:
 AE (verbat im)
 The date when the AE started and stopped
Clinical Study Protoco l

Study Code D3250C00065
Version 4
Date 17 October 2020
89(157) Maximum intensit y of the AE
 Whether the AE is serious or not
 Invest igator causalit y rating against the study  drug (y es or no)
 Action taken with regard to study  drug
 AE caused patient’s withdrawal fro m study  (yes or no )
 Outcom e
In addit ion, the fo llowing vari ables will be collected for SAEs:
 Date AE met criteria for serious AE
 Date Invest igator became aware of serious AE
 AE is seri ous due to
 Date of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
 Date of discharge
 Probable cause of death
 Date of death
 Autopsy  performed
 Causalit y assessment in relat ion to study  procedure(s)
 Caus ality assessment to other medicat ion
 Descript ion of AE
It is important to dist inguish between serious and severe A Es.  Severi ty is a m easure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by  [CONTACT_72991] a in Sect ion 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for 
several hours may  be consi dered severe nausea but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only  a limi ted degree of 
disabili ty may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess the causal relat ionship between the study drug and each AE, and
answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question, ‘Do y ou consider that there is a reasonable possibilit y 
that the event may have been caused by  [CONTACT_24384]?’
For SAEs, the causal relat ionship will also be assessed for other medicat ion and study  
procedures.  Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure, the causal 
relationship is implied as ‘yes’.

90(157)A guide to the interpretation of the causalit y quest ion is found in Appendix Ato the Clinical 
Study  Protocol .
6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by  [CONTACT_25034], reported in response to the open question fro m 
the study  site staff, ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit/you were last 
asked? ’, or revealed by [CONTACT_33145].  When 
collect ing AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to recording a list of 
signs and sy mptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms 
that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be 
recorded separately.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The results fro m the Clinical Study  Protocol –mandated l aboratory  tests and vi tal signs will be 
summarized in the CSR.  Deterioration as co mpared to baseline in protocol -mandated 
laboratory  values and vital signs should therefore only  be reported as A Es if they fulfil any of 
the SAE criteria or are the reason for discont inuat ion of treatment with the study drug.
If deteri oration in a laboratory  value/vi tal sign i s associ ated wi th clinical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom  will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory  resul t/vital sign 
will be considered as addit ional informat ion.  Wherever possible, the reporting Investigator 
uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory  term  (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).  
In the absence of clinical signs or symp toms, clinically  relevant deteri orations in nonmandated 
param eters shoul d be reported as A Es.
Deteri oration of  a laboratory  value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE/SAE.
Any new or aggravated clinically rele vant abnormal medical finding at a physical examinat ion 
as com pared wi th the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.
The signs and symptoms of AI will not be considered as A Es except under certain 
circumstances (eg, adrenal crisis Appendix J). 
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevat ions in liver bio chemistry  may require further evaluat ion, 
and occurrences o f AST or ALT levels ≥3 × ULN together with total bilirubin (TBL) l evels 
≥2×ULN m ay need to be reported as SAEs.  
Any potential Hy’s Law case should be handled as a serious unexpected adverse event 
associ ated wi th the use of the drug and reported prompt ly (i.e., even before all other possible 
causes o f liver injury have been excluded). It should be promptly reported to the appropriate 
regul atory /ethics authori ty before fully working up the pati ent to rul e out other eti ologies. 
Reporting should include all available information, especially that needed for evalu ating the 
severit y and likelihood that the drug caused the reaction, and should init iate a cl ose fo llow-up

6.7 Medication error
For the purposes of this cli nical  study , a m edicati on error i s an unintended failure or mistake 
in the treatment process for an [COMPANY_008] study  drug that ei ther causes harm to the patient 
or has the potential to cause harm to the patient. 
A medicat ion error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process -related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study  site staff or pati ent.
Medicat ion error includes situat ions where an error:

94(157) Occurred
 Was i dentified and intercepted before the patient received the drug
 Did not occur, but circumstances are recognized that could have led to an error
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
 Drug name [CONTACT_33165] n
 Dispensing error, eg, medicat ion prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actual ly 
given to the patient
 Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
 Drug not taken as indicated, eg, tablet disso lved in water when it should be taken as 
a solid tablet 
 Drug not stored as instructed, eg, ke pt in the refrigerator when it should be at room 
temperature 
 Wrong patient received the medication (excluding IWRS/IVRS errors)
 Wrong drug administered to patient (excluding IWRS/IVRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medicat ion errors in clinical studies:
 Errors related to or resulting fro m IWRS/IVRS, including those which lead to one 
of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
 Patient acci dentally  missed drug dose(s), eg, forgot to take medicat ion
 Accidental  overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
 Patient failed to return unused medicat ion or em pty packaging
 Errors related to background and rescue medicat ion, or standard of care medicat ion 
in open -label studi es, even if an [COMPANY_008] product 
Medicat ion errors are not regarded as A Es, but A Es may occur as a consequence of the 
medicat ion error.  
If a medicat ion error occurs during the study , then the Invest igator or other site personnel will 
inform  the appropri ate [COMPANY_008] representatives within [ADDRESS_381766] igator to ensure that all 
relevant informat ion is completed wi thin 1 or 5 calendar days if there is an SAE associated 
with the m edicat ion error (see Section 6.4) and wi thin 30 days for all other medicat ion errors.

8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variables
The count and proportion (with 95% CI) of patients who achieve 100% reducti on in their OCS 
dose, sustained for at least 4 weeks without worsening of asthma or resumed OCS tr eatment, 
and the count and proportion of patients who achieve 100% reduction or a daily OCS dose of 
≤5mg, if reason for no further OCS reduction is AI, sustained over at least 4 weeks without 
worsening of asthma, will be tabulated. 
The same analysis will be carried out for the supporting endpo ints: pati ents who reduce to a 
daily  OCS dose of ≤5mg sustained over at least 4 weeks without worsening of asthma; and 
patients who achieve a ≥90%, ≥75% and ≥50% reduction in their daily  OCS dose wi thout 
worsening o f asthma. 
All 95% C is for proporti ons will be calculated using the Clopper- Pearson exact method. 
For pati ents who do not achieve 100% reduction in their daily  OCS dose, the reason for no 
further reduction will be listed.
Change from baseline in OCS dose variables will be summarized using descriptive statist ics in 
tables and graphs (supporting primary  and secondary  endpo ints).
8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variables
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to 1stOCS increase
Time to first OCS increase in the maintenance phase will be summarized using median, 25th
and 75thpercent iles (with 95% C is) and Kaplan Meier plots.  The start time for the analysis 
will be the time, in the OCS reduction phase, at which the patient first reaches the minimum 
stable dose that is cont inued into the start of th e maintenance phase.
Cox-regression model analysis will also be used to summarize and analyze time to first OCS 
increase; covariates will include at least baseline OCS daily dose and baseline eosinophil 
count (categorized).  If a patient withdraws fro m thestudy  before reaching the defined 
endpo int or does not reach the endpoint by [CONTACT_2054] , whichever is earlier, the 
patient will be censored at that time point.

Asthma control responders will be evaluated as a supportive analysis outcome measure.  
Patients will  be categori zed according to the fo llowing limits ( Juniper et al 2005 ), where 
observed study  time points include, but are not limited to, Visit 3, init ial morning corti sol test 
(time point at which OCS dose equals 5mg for 4 weeks), end of OCS reduction phase, and end 
of maintenance phase (EOT visit) from Visit 2:
 Improvem ent: Change from  baseline in ACQ -6 score of ≤ -0.5
 No change: Change fro m baseline in ACQ -6 score of > -0.5 an d < +0.5
 Deteri oration: Change from baseline in ACQ -6 score of ≥ +0.5
Asthma control responders will be defined as pat ients who had improvements based on 
changes fro m baseline in their ACQ -6 scores.  Patients with no change or deterioration 
according to ACQ -6 score evaluat ion will be defined as nonresponders.  Patients with missing 
or nonevaluable ACQ -6 scores at a postbaseline assessment time point will be considered 
nonresponders at the time point.  
Furtherm ore, pati ents will  be categori zed according to their ACQ -6 score –defined asthma 
control  status at post Visit 2 assess ments using the fo llowing score thresho lds (Juniper et

Summary  statistics for SGRQ total score and domain scores (symptoms, activit y, and impacts) 
at Vi sit 2 (baseline) and EOT vi sit along wi th change from  baseline to EOT vi sit will be 
produced.  Change fro m baseline in SGRQ total score and the three domain scores will also be 
analyzed separately  using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with change from baseline in 
SGRQ score as response variable and baseline SGRQ score and baseline OCS dose and 
baseline categories of serum eosinophil count as covariates.  Results will be presented in terms 
of least square m ean wi th 95% CI of change from baseline in SGRQ total score.
A 4-point thresho ld will be used to define the response.  If there is a ≥4-point decrease fro m 
baseline in SGRQ total score, it will be defined as ‘improvement’; if there is a ≥4-point 
increase at EOT fro m baseline, i t will be defined as ‘worsening’; if the change is not more 
than 4 points at EOT, it will be defined as ‘no change’ . 
Missing SGRQ total score change at end of the study  or assessment time points will be 
considered as ‘not evaluable’. 
For the responder analysis of SGRQ, a responder will be defined as a patient who had 
‘improvement’ (ie, ≥4-point decrease in SGRQ total score). Pati ents who had SGRQ total 
score changes defined as ‘no change’ or ‘worsening’ will be considered nonresponders.  If 
SGRQ total  score change is not evaluable due to missing data, then the patient will also be 
treated as a nonresponder.

118(157)Appendix A: Additional Safety Information
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious A dverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patientwas at immediate risk of death from the AEas it 
occurred, or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the 
patient’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ do es not mean that, had an AEoccurred in a more severe 
form, it might have caused death (eg, hepat itis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_96698] a serious AE , although the reasons 
for it may be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_33094]/or surgical 
operati ons planned before or during a study  are not consi dered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patientwas enrolled in the study , provi ded that i t did not deteri orate in an 
unexpected way  during the study .
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important m edical e vents may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospi [INVESTIGATOR_3094], disabilit y, or incapacit y but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definit ion of serious.  
These shou ld usually be considered as serious.
Simply stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_33095]; medical 
judgement must be used.
 Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring intravenous 
hydrocortisone treatment
 Hepatotoxicit y caused by [CONTACT_33153] l (acetaminophen) overdose requiring 
treatm ent wi th N-acetylcysteine
 Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
 Blood dy scrasias (eg, neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusio n) or 
convulsio ns that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3094]
 Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causalit y, consider the following factors when deciding if 
there is a ‘reasonable possibilit y’that an AE may  have been caused by [CONTACT_33641].
 Time course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the 
suspect drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relat ionship to the 
administration of the suspect drug?
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix A
Drug Substance Benralizumab
Study Code D3250C00065
Version 4
Date 17 October 2020
119(157) Consist ency wit h known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowl edge of the suspect drug (pharmaco logy and toxi cology) or drugs of the same 
pharmaco logical class? Or could the AE be ant icipated from its pharmaco logical 
properties?
 De-challenge experience.  Di d the AE resolve or improve on stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_96699]?
 No al ternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably  explained by [CONTACT_96786], other drugs, other host, or environmental fact ors
 Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? [COMPANY_008] would not normally 
recommend or support a re -challenge
 Laboratory  tests.  A specific laboratory  invest igation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
 Is this a recogni zedfeature of overdose of the drug?
 Is there a known mechanism?
Causalit y of ‘related’ is m ade if, fo llowing a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for 
a ‘reasonable possibilit y’of a causal relat ionship for the individual case.  The expression 
‘reasonable possibilit y’ of acausal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal re lationship.
The causalit y assessment i s perform ed based on the available data including enough 
inform ation to m ake an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, i t is likely  that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’ .
Causal relat ionship in cases where the disease under study  has deteri orated due to l ack of 
effect shoul d be classified as no reasonable possibilit y.

International Airline Transportation Associat ion (IATA) classifies bio hazardous agents into 
3categori es.  For transport purposes the classificatio n of infect ious substances according to 
risk groups was removed fro m the Dangerous Go ods Regulations (DGR) in the 46thedition 
(2005).  Infect ious substances are now classified either as Category  A, Category  B or Exempt.  
There i s no di rect relati onship between Risk Groups and categories A and B.
Category A Infectious Substances are infect ious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, i s capable of causing permanent disabilit y, life-threatening or fatal  disease in 
otherwi se healt hy humans or animals.  Category  A pathogens are eg, Ebola, Lassa fever virus:
 are to be packed and s hipped in accordance wit h IATA Instruction 602.
Category B Infectious Substances are infect ious Substances that do not meet the criteria for

121(157)Appendix C: Genetic Research 
Rationale and Objectives
[COMPANY_008] intends to collect and store DNA for genet ic research to explore how genetic 
variat ions may affect clinical parameters, risk and prognosis o f diseases, and the response to 
medicat ions.  Genetic research may lead to better understanding of diseases, better diagnosis 
of diseases, or other improvements in health care and to the discovery  of new di agnost ics, 
treatm ents, or m edicati ons. 
In addit ion, collect ion of DNA samples from populat ions with well -described clinical 
characterist ics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, 
possibly , to geneti cally guided treatment strategies.
Genetic Research Plan and Procedures
Selection of genetic research populati on
Study selection record
All patients will be asked to participate in this genetic research.  Participat ion is vo luntary and, 
if a pat ient declines to participate, there will be no penalt y or l oss of benefit.  The patient will 
not be excluded from any asp ect of  the main study .
Inclusion criteria
For inclusio n in this genet ic research, patients must fulfil all o f the inclusio n criteria described 
in the main body  of the Clinical Study  Protocol  and:
 Provi de inform ed consent for the genetic sampling and analys es
Exclusion criteria
Exclusio n from this genet ic research may be for any o f the excl usion criteria specified in the 
main study  or any  of the fo llowing:
 Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant
 Non–leukocyte -depleted whol e blood transfusio n in [ADDRESS_381800] ion
Discontinuation of patients from this genetic research
Specific reasons for discont inuing a patient fro m this genet ic research are as fo llows:
Withdrawal o f consent for genet ic research:  Patients may withdraw fro m this genet ic research 
at any  time, independent of any decisio n concerning participat ion in other aspects of the main 
study .  Vol untary  discontinuati on will  not prej udice further treatment.  Procedures for 
discontinuat ion are outlined in Sect ion 3.6.1 of the main Clinical Study  Protocol .

122(157)Collection of samples for genetic research
The blood sample for genet ic research will be obtained fro m the pati ents at Visit 1. Although 
DNA is stable, early sample co llection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through 
excluding pat ients who may wit hdraw due to an adverse event (AE), such patients would be 
important to include in any genet ic analysis.  If for any reason the sa mple is not drawn at Visit 
[ADDRESS_381801] acing the information on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the sample will be 
ident ifiable by [CONTACT_33160], unique number only.  This number is used to ident ify the sample 
and corresponding data at the [COMPANY_008] genetics laboratories, or at the designated 
organi zation. No personal details ident ifying the individual will be available to any  person 
([COMPANY_008] emplo yee or designated organizat ions working with the DNA).
The link between the p atient enrollment and the second number will be maintained and stored 
in a secure environment, with restricted access at [COMPANY_008] or designated organizations.  
The link will be used to ident ify the relevant DNA samples for analysis, to facilit ate 
correl ation of genoty pic resul ts wi th clinical data, to allow regulatory  audi t, and to trace 
samples for destruction in the case of withdrawal of consent.
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements
The principles for ethical and regulatory  requi rements for the study , including this genet ics 
research component, are outlined in Section 10of the main Clinical Study  Protocol .
Informed consent
The genetic component o f this study  is opti onal, and the patient may  parti cipate in other 
components of the m ain study  without parti cipat ing in the genet ic component.  To participate 
in the genet ic co mponent of the study, the patient must provide their signed and dated consent 
for both the m ain study  and the genetic component of the study .  A copy  of the si gned and 
dated consent form(s) must be given to the patient with the original filed at the study  center.  
The Principal Invest igators is responsible for ensuring that consent i s given freely and that the 
patient understands that they  may freely  discontinue from  the genet ic aspect of the study at 
any time.

123(157)Patient data protection
[COMPANY_008] will not provide individual genoty pe resul ts to patients, any  insurance co mpany, 
any empl oyer, thei r family members, or general physician unless required to do so by  [CONTACT_2371].
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confident iality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identi ty of the patient.  In except ional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal ident ifiers of a pati ent.  For example, in the case of 
a medical emergency , an [COMPANY_008] Physician or an Invest igator might know a patient’s 
ident ity and also have access to his or her genet ic data.  Al so, regul atory  authori ties may  
requi re access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the genetic 
files woul d rem ain physically  separate.
Data management
Any genoty pe data generated during this study  will be stored at a secure sy stem  at 
[COMPANY_008] and/or designated organizations to analyze the samples.
The results from this genet ic research may be reported in a separate report fro m the CSR or 
published in scient ific journals.
[COMPANY_008] and its designated organizat ionsmay share summary results (such as genet ic 
differences fro m groups of individuals with a disease) fro m this genetic research with other 
researchers, such as hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], academic organizat ion, or health insurance co mpanies.  This 
can be done by [CONTACT_310449], where they can be combined wit h 
the resul ts of similar studies to learn even more about healt h and disease.  The researchers can 
only use this inform ation for healt h-related research purposes.  Researchers may  see summary  
results, but they  will not be able to see individual patient data or any  personal  identifiers. 
Some or all  of the clinical datasets from the main study  may be merged wi th the genet ic data 
in a suitable secure environment separate from the clinical database .
Statistical Methods and Determination of Sample Size
The number of pat ients who will agree to participate in the genet ic research is unknown.  It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statist ical evaluati on or whether only  descri ptive statist ics will be generated.  A Statist ical 
Analysis Plan will be prepared where appropriate.

124(157)Appendix D: Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law
1.INTRODUCTION
This Appendix describes the process to be fo llowed in order to ident ify and appropriately 
report cases of Hy’s Law.  It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the management 
of elevated liver biochemistries.  
Specific guidance on managing liver ab norm alities can be found in Sect ion 6.3.[ADDRESS_381802] igator is responsible for determining whether a patient meets 
potenti al Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any  point during the study .
All sources of l aboratory  data are appropri ate for the determinat ion of PHL and HL ev ents; 
this includes samples taken at scheduled study  visits and other vi sits including central  and all 
local laboratory  evaluat ions even if co llected outside of the study  visit s; for exam ple, PHL 
criteria coul d be m et by  [CONTACT_96724]  a central  laboratory  and/or elevated TBL fro m 
a local laboratory . 
The Investigator will also review Adverse Event data (for example, for A Es that may indicate 
elevations in liver biochemistry ) for possible PHL events.
The Investigator participates, together with Astra Zeneca clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  HL criteria are met if there is no alternat ive explanat ion for the el evations in liver 
biochemistry  other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by  [CONTACT_309582] (IMP).
The Investigator is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL/HL cases and for 
reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) according to the o utcome 
of the review and assessment in line with standard safet y reporting processes.
2.DEFINITIONS
Potential Hy’s Law (PHL)
Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3x Upper Limit of 
Norm al (ULN) together with Total Bilirubin (T BL) ≥ 2xULN at any po int during the study  
following the start of study  drug irrespect ive of an increase in Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).
Hy’s Law (HL)
AST or ALT ≥ 3x ULN together with TBL ≥ 2xULN, where no other reason, other than the 
IMP, can be found to explain the combinat ion of increases, eg, elevated ALP indicating 
cholestasis, viral hepat itis, another drug.  
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance Benralizumab
Study Code D3250C00065
Version 4
Date 17 October 2020
125(157)For PHL and HL the elevat ion in transaminases must precede or be coincid ent wi th (ie, on the 
same day ) the el evati on in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the 
elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.
3.IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
In order to i dentify  cases of PHL i t is important to perfo rm a com prehensive review of 
laboratory  data for any  patient who m eets any  of the fo llowing i dentificat ion criteria in 
isolation or in combinat ion:
 ALT ≥ 3xULN
 AST ≥ 3xULN
 TBL ≥ 2xULN
When a pat ient meets any of the identificat ion criteria, in isol ation or in co mbination, the 
central  laboratory  will immediately  send an alert to the Invest igator (also sent to [COMPANY_008] 
representative). 
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any  local  laboratory  reports where the PHL 
ident ificat ion criteria are met , where this is the case the Investigator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative
 Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by  [CONTACT_96790]
 Com plete the appropri ate unscheduled laboratory  eCRF m odule(s) wi th the ori ginal  
local laboratory  test resul t
When the identificat ion criteria are m et from central  or local laboratory  resul ts, the 
Invest igator will, without delay:
 Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Section 2 within this 
appendix for definit ions) by  [CONTACT_42574] l aboratory  reports from  all previ ous visi ts 
(including both central and local laboratory  resul ts)
4.FOLLOW -UP
4.1.Potential Hy’s Law criteria not met
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria, the Investigator will:
 Inform  the [COMPANY_008] representati ve that the patient has not met PHL criteria
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance Benralizumab
Study Code D3250C00065
Version 4
Date 17 October 2020
126(157) Perform  follow-up on subsequent laboratory  resul ts according to the guidance 
provi ded in the Clinical Study  Protocol
4.2.Potential Hy’s Law criteria met
If the patient does meet PHL criteria, the Invest igator will:
 Notify  the [COMPANY_008] representative who will then inform the central Study  Team
Within [ADDRESS_381803] igator will report the case as an SAE of 
Potenti al Hy’s Law; seri ous cri teria ‘Im portant m edical event’ and causalit y assess ment 
‘yes/related’ according to CSP process for SAE reporting. This shoul d be reported 
prom ptly to the appropriate regulatory /ethics authori ty (i.e., even before all other possible 
causes o f liver injury have been excluded) before fully  working up the pati ent to rul e out 
other etio logies. Reporting should include all available informat ion, especially  that 
needed for evaluat ing the severit y and likelihood that the drug caused the reaction, and 
shoul d initiate a cl ose f ollow-up until co mplete resol ution of th e problem and co mpletion 
of all attem pts to obtain supplementary  data.
For subjects that met PHL criteria prior to starting IMP, the invest igator is not required to 
submit a PHL SAE unless there is a significant change #in the subject’s condit ion
The Study Physician contacts the Invest igator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study  subjects’ foll ow-up (including any  further l aboratory  testing) and 
the continuous review o f data
Subsequent to this contact [CONTACT_73016]:
 Moni tor the subject until liver biochemistry  parameters and appropriate clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically 
indicated. Completes fo llow-up SAE Form as required.
 Invest igate the etio logy of the event and perform  diagnosti c investi gations as 
discussed wi th the Study  Physician. << For studies using a central laboratory  add: 
This includes deciding which the tests available in the Hy ’s law lab ki t shoul d be 
used>> 
 Com plete the three Liver CRF Modules as infor mation becom es available 
# A ‘significant’ change in the subject’s condit ion refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry  parameters (ALT, AST or total bilirubin) in iso lation or in 
combinat ion, or a clinically  relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determinat ion of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discret ion of the Invest igator, this 
may be in consultat ion with the Study  Physician if there is any uncertaint y.

127(157)5.REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL HY’S LAW CASES
The instructions in this sect ion shoul d be fo llowed for all  cases where PHL cri teria are m et.
As soon as possible after the biochemistry  abnormalit y was ini tially detected, the Study  
Physician contacts the Invest igator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternat ive explanat ion for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by [CONTACT_86184], to ensure timely analysis and reporting to healt h authorit ies wit hin [ADDRESS_381804] and TBL elevations, 
a determination of whether the alternat ive explanatio n is an AE will be made and 
subsequent ly whether the AE meets the criteria for a SA E:
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is notan AE, record the alternative explanation on 
the appropriate CRF
 If the alternat ive explanat ion is an AE/SAE: update the previously submitted 
Potenti al Hy’s Law SAE and AE CRFs accordingly  with the new inform ation 
(reassessing event term; causalit y and seri ousness cri teria) fo llowing the AZ 
standard processes.
If it is agreed that there is no explanat ion that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL 
elevations other than the IMP:
 Send updated SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’ ) according to [COMPANY_008] standard 
processes. 
 The ‘Medically  Important’ seri ous cri terion shoul d be used if no other serious 
criteria apply
 As there is no alternat ive explanation for the HL case, a causalit y assessment of 
‘related’ should be assigned.
If, there i s an unavo idable delay, of over 15 calendar day s in obtaining the informat ion 
necessary  to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that 
there is no alternat ive explanation unt il such time as an informed decis ion can be made:
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix D
Drug Substance Benralizumab
Study Code D3250C00065
Version 4
Date 17 October 2020
128(157) Provi des any  further update to the previously submitted SAE of Potential Hy’s 
Law, (report term now ‘Hy’s Law case’) ensuring causalit y assessment i s related 
to IMP and seriousness criteria is medically  important, according to CSP process 
for SAE reporting.
 Continue fo llow-up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary  
supplementary  informat ion is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are still met.  Update the previously submitted PHL 
SAE report following CSP process for SAE reporting, according to the outcome of

1.Introduction
As wi th any antibody , allergic reacti ons to dose administration are possible.  The World 
Health Organizat ion has categorized anaphylaxis into [ADDRESS_381809] inguishable: immuno logic [IgE -mediated and non -IgE-mediated (eg, IgG and immune 
complex mediated) and non immuno logic (Johansson et al, 2004).  The clinical criteria for 
defining anaphylaxis for this study  are listed in section 2.  A guide to the signs and symptoms 
and management of acute anaphylaxis is provided in sect ion 3.  Appropriate drugs, such as 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_75417], ant ihistamines, corticosteroids, etc, and medical equipment to treat anaphylact ic 
reacti ons must be immediately available at study  sites, and study  personnel should be trained 
to recognize and treat anaphylaxis according to local guidelines.
If an a naphylact ic react ion occurs, a blood sample will be drawn fro m the pati ent as soon as 
possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minutes after the event, and at discharge for 
analysis of serum tryptase.
2.Clinical Criteria for Defining Anaphylaxis
In ad ults, anaphylaxis is highly likely  when any one of the following 3 criteria is fulfilled:
 Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with invo lvement of the 
skin, mucosal t issue, or both (eg, generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING
(a) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_33097] (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_11311], hypoxemia)
(b) Reduced BP or associated symptoms of end -organ dy sfunct ion (eg, hy potoni a 
[collapse], syncope, incon tinence)
 Two or more of the fo llowing occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely  allergen 
for that pati ent (minutes to several hours):
(a) Involvement of the skin -mucosal t issue (eg, generalized hives, itch -flush, swollen 
lips-tongue-uvula)
(b) Respi[INVESTIGATOR_310370] e (eg, dyspnea, wheeze- bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_11311], hypoxemia)
(c) Reduced BP or associated symptoms (eg, hy potonia [coll apse], syncope, 
incont inence)
(d) Persi stent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy  abdominal  pain, vomi ting)
 Reduced BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to 
several hours): Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% 
decrease fro m that pati ent’s baseline value

145(157)Appendix K: PONENTE Long Term Follow Up Substudy
1.PONENTE Long Term Follow Up Substudy Background and Rationale
The PONENTE study  assesses an algorithm for OCS reduction that also defines when OCS 
reducti on shoul d be interrupted (i.e. after 2 exacerbat ions, or after two laboratory  tests 
showing co mplete AI within a 3- month peri od). Once the OCS dose has been completely 
reduced or the lowest OCS dose achieved based on the OCS reduction treatment algorithm, 
patients enter a m aintenance phase where no further reductions in OCS dose are allowed. 
After complet ingthe 6-month OCS maintenance phase, patients who couldn’t completely  
reduce OCS may  have been well -controlled on the lowest OCS dose achieved during the OCS 
reducti on phase or m ay have recovered from  AI, and, therefore, healt hcare providers may 
decide to f urther reduce OCS or other background asthma medicat ion, which is in line with 
the GINA report on severe asthma management (i.e. first reducing OCS and then, reducing 
ICS dose as tolerated according to clinical assessment) (GINA 2020).
According to the GINA report, asthma therapy  shoul d be peri odically  reviewed to assess 
patient’s response to therapy . For pati ents who have had a good response to biologic therapy , 
the treating physician should consider not only the reduction or eliminat ion of maintenance 
OCS, but al so reducing the ICS dose from high to medium dose (GINA 2020). GINA 
describes this guidance as “consensus advice” recognizing that no data are available to guide 
this clinical decisio n. 
However, it is anticipated that in the future healt hcare providers are likely to reduce the ICS 
dose significant ly or completely at the behest of patients whose as thma becomes well -
controlled after the addit ion of bio logic therapy .
This l ong term  follow up substudy  aims to observe changes in the OCS dose and other 
background asthma therapy , and to assess the am ount of recovery  from AI, in a real -world 
setting as we ll as assessment of glucocortico id toxicit y by [CONTACT_310376]. 
2.PONENTE Long Term Follow Up Substudy Design
After completion of the EOT visit procedures, eligible patients (See Appendix K –Secti on 4
and 5) may consent to a l ong term  follow up visit [ADDRESS_381811] udy.
Patients will  be treated according to healthcare provider discretion and therefore no IP (i.e. 
Benralizumab) will be provided by [CONTACT_456]. Between the EOT visit of the main 
PONENTE study  and the Long Term Fo llow Up visit, any changes in the mainte nance 
asthma regimen are allowed, including further reductions o f OCS as recommended in the 
GINA report (GINA 2020
).

146(157)2.1 Consent:
Written consent must be obtained at any  time fro m the EOT visit to prior to the Long Term 
Follow Up visit . Pati ents will co mplete the [ADDRESS_381812] PONENTE 
patient has com pleted the EOT vi sit.
2.
2 Long Term Follow Up Visit: 
At the Long Term  Follow Up visit, the patient will undergo an on -site visi t for assessment of 
daily  OCS dose, concomitant medicat ions (including changes in background asthma regimen), 
asthma exacerbations, laboratory  assessments, vi tal signs, and i tems f or the GTI as sessments.  
Addit ionally , pati ents who had Complete or Partial AI at the end of the OCS maintenance 
phase (EOT visit) of the primary PONENTE study, will undergo morning cortisol testing. 
Patients wi th indeterminate results fro m the morning cortisol test at the Long Term Follow Up
visit will return on -site to conduct ACTH stimulat ion test within a week after the Long Term 
Follow Up visit .
2.3 Assessment and collection of asthma exacerbations:
Asthma exacerbations will be defined per Section 5.2.2.  The Inve stigator will assess 
exacerbations at the PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up , and if applicable, at any other time 
when made aware by [CONTACT_102] (Table 8). The Investigator must justify the decisio n for 
defining an event of worsening asthma as an exacerbat ion, and document this just ification, 
including symptoms, in the source documents and the eCRF.
2.4 Safety reporting: 
Any event that occurs from the time period between the main PONENTE study  follow up visit 
and the patient signing the ICF will be captured as part of the medical history  for the 
PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up. After PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up inform ed consent 
up until the Long Term Fo llow Up visit, any events will be captured as AEs/SAEs .Any 
AE/SAE that are unreso lved at the Long Term Fo llow Up visit will be fo llowed-up by  [CONTACT_310452]. Causalit y 
will be confirmed by [CONTACT_310453] 6.3.4. Adverse events based on signs and 
symptoms, or based on examinat ions and te sts, will be reported per Sections 6.3.5 and 6.3.6 , 
respectively .
Any spon taneous reports of AE/SAE related to any drug products other than benralizumab 
will not be captured in the eCRF but will be reported as spontaneous reports to the drug

151(157)7.Concomitant medication and other treatments
The PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up is observatio nal only. There are no sponsor -provided 
investigat ional products, restrict ions related to concomitant me dicati ons other than those 
detailed in Sect ion 3.5, or restrict ions on concurrent disease. Restrict ions described in Secti on
7.8do not apply in the PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up .
Addit ionally , from the EOT vi sit of the m ain PONENTE study  to the Long Term Follow Up
visit, any changes in the maintenance asthma regimen are allowed , including reductions of 
maintenance OCS therapy  as recommended in the GINA report.
Due to potential interactions with morning cortiso l and ACTH stimulat ion testing, the 
restri ctions on concomitant medicat ions detailed in Section 3.5remain in place for the 
PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up substudy .

152(157)Outcome variables
 Patients who achieve 100% reduction in daily OCS dose fro m PONENTE baseline 
dose to the Long Term Fo llow Up visit
 Patients who achieve a daily OCS dose of ≤5mg (prednisone equivalent dose) at the 
Long Term Follow Up visit
 Patients who achieve ≥90%, ≥75%, ≥50% and >0% reduction in daily  OCS dose 
from PONENTE baseline dose to the Long Term Fo llow Up visit

of the PONENTE m ain study  to the Long Term Follow Up visit
 Change in background asthma maintenance medication fro m baseline of the 
PONENTE main study  to the Long Term Fo llow Up visit
Change from baseline will be calculated as the post -baseline assessment value minus the 
baseline assessment value.  If either value is missing, then the change from baseline value will 
be missing. Full details will be defined in the PONENTE Long Term Fo llow Up substudy
SAP.
Safety outcome variables
 Patients wi th com plete AI and changes in AI status
 Annualized asthma exacerbation rate

Cases of Civil Crisis, Natural Disaster, or Public Health 
Crisis
Note: Changes below should be implemented only during study disruptions due to any of or a 
combinat ion of civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis (eg, during quarant ines and 
resul ting site closures, regional travel restrictions and considerat ions if site personnel or study  
patients beco me infected with SARS -CoV -2or similar pandemic infect ion) during which 
patients may not wish to or m ay be unable to vi sit the study  site for study  visit s. These 
changes should only be implemented if allowable by [CONTACT_271133]/regi onal guidelines and following 
agreem ent from the Sponsor and instructions on how to perform these procedures will be 
provi ded at the time of implementation.
Please note that during civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis, some study  
assessment sand procedures may  not be conducted due to internat ional or local po licies or 
guidelines, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_310375]’s safet y. If indoubt, please contact [CONTACT_122649] . 
1 Reconsent of Study Patients During Study Interruptions
During study  interrupti ons, i t may not be possible for the patients to complete s tudy visits and 
assessments on site and alternat ive means for carrying out the visits and assessments may be 
necessary , eg, rem ote vi sits. Reconsent shoul d be obtained for the al ternat ive means of 
carrying out visits and assessments and should be obtained prior to performing the procedures 
described in Section 2 to Section 5. Local and regional regulat ions and/or guidelines regarding 
reconsent of study  patients shoul d be checked and fo llowed. Reconsent may  be verbal  if 
allowed by  [CONTACT_310455] (note, i n the case of verbal reconsent the ICF should 
be signed at the patient’s next contact [CONTACT_72953]). Vi siting the study  sites for the sol e 
purpose of obtaining reconsent should be avo ided. 
[ADDRESS_381815] On -site Visit (where applicable)
A qualified HCP fro m the study  site or TPV servi ce m ay visit the patients home / or other 
remote locati on as per l ocal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), as applicable. Supplies 
will be provided for a safe and efficient visit. The qua lified HCP will be expected to collect 
inform ation per the clinical study  protocol  (CSP). If applicable, assessments will be performed 
according a the revised Schedule of Assessments (SoA) in the Study  Instructi on Manual for 
Mitigation Due to Civil Crisis, Natural  Disaster, or Public Healt h Crisis .

In thi s appendix, the term telemedicine visit refers to remote contact [CONTACT_310456] , virtual  or vi deo vi sits, and m obile 
healt h devices.
During a civil crisis, natural disaster, or public healt h crisis, on -site visi ts may  be replaced by 
a telemedicine visit if allowed by  [CONTACT_5737]/regional guidelines. Having a telemedicine contact 
[CONTACT_310457], concomitant medication, exacerbat ions, OCS dose 
(including reasons for no OCS reduction in an otherwise controlled pat ient), GTI data, blood 
sample collect ion for central lab analysis, etc to be reported and documented. I f applicable, 
safet y procedures and blood sample co llection will be performed according to the revised SoA 
in the Study  Instructi on Manual for Mit igation Due to Civil Crisis, Natural Disaster, or Public 
Health Crisis .
4 At-home or Remote Location IP Admini stration Instructions
If a site visit is not possible, at -home or remote location administration of IP may be 
perform ed by  a qualified HCP, provi ded this is acceptable wit hin local regulati on/guidance. 
The opti on of  at-home or remote location IP administra tion ensures patientssafet y in cases o f 
a pandemic where patients may be at increased risk by [CONTACT_122652]/clinic. This will 
also minimize interruption o f IP administration during other study  disrupti ons, e.g., si te 
closures due to natural disaster. 
4.1 - At-home or Remote Location IP Administration by a Quali fied HCP 
or TPV Service
A qualified HCP fro m the study  site or TPV servi ce m ay administer the IP at the patient’s
home or other remote location according to the CSP. All necessary supplies and instructions 
for administration and docum entati on of  IP adminis tration will be provi ded. Addit ional 
inform ation related to the visit can be obtained via a telemedicine or home visit.
5 Data Capture During Telemedicine or Home / Remote Visits
Data collected during telemedicine or home / remote visits will be captured by [CONTACT_73025] m the study  site or TPV servi ce in the source documents, or by  [CONTACT_310458].

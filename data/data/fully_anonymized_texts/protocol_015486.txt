Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.[ADDRESS_1031899]-Traumatic Stress Disorder  
 
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that occurs in response to certain traumatic experiences (TE).  The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -5) defines a TE for purposes of PTSD as exposure to -  actual or threatened  - 
death, serious injury or sexual violence.  The exposure may be direct, or may be indirect (witnessing the event, learning of the event occurring to a loved one, or repetitive confrontation with aversive details of such  an event – usually in the course of professional duties ).  PTSD is 
characterized by [CONTACT_753884] -experiencing it, avoiding thoughts or 
reminders of it, having new negative thoughts or feelings, becoming more aroused and reactive, and experiencing distress or functional impairment (e.g., socially or professionally) .  To meet 
diagnostic criterion, t he symptoms may not be due to medication, substance abuse, or other 
illness.  The DSM-5 recognizes two specifications for this disorder, a de layed onset subgroup, 
where full diagnostic criteria are not  met until 6 or more months after the TE, and a subgroup 
that experiences high levels of dissociation, either through depersonalization (“not happening to me”) or derealization (“things are not real”). (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) .  
Evidence for the existence of this highly symptomatic dissociative subgroup was buttressed by [CONTACT_753885]. al. using latent class analysis , appearing to be highly specific to TEs involving sexual 
assault both in children and adults. (Wolf, et al., 2012)  
 PTSD was first recognized in the DSM -III in 1980, largely in response to political pressure on 
the mental health field to recognize the psychological effects of war observed in Vietnam and concentration camp survivor s.  Recognition paved  the way for treatment of victims of TEs  
(Galatzer-Levy & Bryant, 2013)  (Helzer, Robins, & McEvoy, 1987)  rather than court -martialing 
them or ignoring their conditions. (Gersons & Carlier, 1992)   The characterization of this 
disorder, both for diagnostic, treatment, and research purposes, has evolved significantly since it was first recognized as a separate phenomenon.  This evolution culminated, in 2013, in significant change s between the DSM -IV and the DSM -5, which elevated by 8 -fold the number 
of heterogeneous symptom combinations meeting diagnostic criterion.  (Galatzer -Levy & 
Bryant, 2013)   The changes are energetically criticized by [CONTACT_753886].  Hoge et 
al. level the criticism that the new definition disrupted the long chain of links, established 
through epi[INVESTIGATOR_904], neurobiological, and treatment studies, that provided the  foundation of 
current practice for patients with PTSD. (Hoge, et al., 2016)   Galatzer-Levy and Bryant describe 
the DSM-5 classification of PTSD as nondescript  and highly heterogeneous , while also opi[INVESTIGATOR_753825] , and that its usefulness for such purpose has 
only deteriorated with each DSM revision.  (Galatzer -Levy & Bryant, 2013)   On the other hand, 
Miller et al. report  explorations of the DSM -5 schema support the DSM -5 symptom clusters . 
(Miller, et al., 2012)   Additionally, Reiger et. al, r eport that DSM -[ADDRESS_1031900] reliabilities of any diagnosis (kappa=0.69, 95% CI [ 0.59-0.78]); for example, in the 
same cohort Alcohol Use Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, 
and Borderline Personality Disorder had test -retest kappa statistics of 0.40, 0.25, 0.36, and 0.34 
respectively. (Reiger, et al., 2013)    
 The literature reports varying prevalence figures for a variety of reasons.  First, the diagnostic criteria have been a moving target since the recognition of PTSD as a separate psychiatric 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.[ADDRESS_1031901] revisions of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual, but also changes to 
the alternative  World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme, the International 
Classification of Diseases (ICD).  The ICD -10 (endorsed in [ADDRESS_1031902] World Health 
Assembly) and ICD -11 (released in 2018) have also represented revisions of diagnostic criteria. 
(Stein, et al., 2014)   ICD revisions also include their companion research embodiments (ICD -R).  
In addition to the temporal challenges of case identification comparisons across the literature, 
resulting from revisions to classification schemes, there are multiple ways of either selecting or 
defining TE/symptom pairings used to make the diagnosis  which lie outside of the simple pairing 
of a single qualifying event  with a qualifying symptom menu.  Methods include: (1) requiring 
symptom thresholds to be met in response to a single  event, (2) requiring symptom thresholds to 
be met for one type  of TE (e.g., sexual assault type, disaster type, combat,  or warzone type, etc.), 
where one or more  events in the same category, or type, could contribute to the symptoms (used 
by [CONTACT_753887]. al. as the “S ame-Event” definition), and (3) requiring symptom thresholds to be 
met in response to a combination of more than one type  of event (used by [CONTACT_753887]. al. as the 
“Composite-Event” definition).  An additional challenge to synthesizing the literature is that 
where just one index TE or TE type is required for diagnosis , if an individual has experienced 
multiple qualifying TE/symptom pairings, a study may choose to focus only on one of these.  
This one TE/symptom pairing selected for study may, for example, be selected at random from all available pairings  meeting diagnostic criterion  or may be selected by [CONTACT_193526] -report of the 
participant as being the first or the worst.  Finally, within each definition (Same -Event or 
Composite-Event), studies may report  any of a number of PTSD time periods, e.g., Lifetime, 
Past [ADDRESS_1031903] 6 months.  For example, Kilpatrick et. al. investigated all three of these time periods in a methodological study (Kilpatrick, et al., 2013) .   
 The same concerns in literature synthesis are also  issues in diagnostic eligibility criteria for 
interventional trials; w here operationalization of the diagnosis requires selection from a menu 
that may be characterized as a multiplicative function of choices  such as those exemplified 
above.  Stein et. al. investigated the impact of using “narrow” versus “broad” approaches to 
qualifying PTSD diagnoses for study. (Stein, et al., 2014)   The authors compared the overlap and 
exclusion of individuals meeting diagnostic criterion using the DSM -5, DSM-IV, ICD-[ADDRESS_1031904] exclusive.  Only 1/3
rd of all cases 
meeting criterion in one system also met criterion in the other 3 systems.  Also, 1/3rd of cases met 
criterion in one system alone.  The more striking result was that significantly elevated indicators of clinical significance were found even in cases meeting  criterion for only one system.  This 
caused the authors to recommend that cases be diagnosed as PTSD -positive if criterion is met for 
any one of these diagnostic systems. 
 There is disagreement as to the magnitude, and implications , of exclusion or inclusion of 
individuals in PTSD  diagnosis depending on whether DSM -IV or DSM-[ADDRESS_1031905] that 
DSM-5 rates were about 1-2 % lower than DSM -IV for both lifetime and past -12-month 
diagnoses. (Kilpatrick, et al., 2013)   Same-Event comparisons indicated that about 75% of 
persons who met DSM -IV criterion also met DSM -5 criterion and that 88% of persons who met

the US adult population in general .   
 
Lifetime prevalence of PTSD is estimated at 5 to 8% of men and 10 to 14% of women, making it one of the most common psychiatric disorder s. (Breslau, et al., 1991)  (Kessler, et al., 1995)  
(Yehuda, et al., 2002)  (Kilpatrick, et al., 2013)   Breslau et.al. estimate that i t affects 15-24% of 
people exposed to a traumatic event . (Bresslau, et al., 2001a)   Yehuda et. al. report that 55% of 
rape victims develop PTSD . (Yehuda, et al., 2002)   In addition, large numbers of service 
members develop PTSD following combat exposure.  In a survey of members of the National Guard following combat in Iraq, 23.4% developed PTSD with some functional impairment, and 8.9% developed  PTSD with serious functional impairment. (Thomas, et. al., 2010)  
 To explore the epi[INVESTIGATOR_753826], Kilpatrick et. al. studied a sample of 2953 U.S. adults recruited online who then completed an assessment using the National Stressful Events Survey, a structured self -administered survey.  Of these, 89.7% reported exposure to at least one 
DSM-5 criterion TE  type; where the modal number of such TE  types experienced was 3 
(mean=3.3, SD -2.32), and at least 30% of the sample experienced 6.  In addition to the majority 
of participants reporting multiple events, m any were exposed to more than one type  of TE.  
Percentages reported were: ( 1) disaster 50.5%, (2) accident/fire 48.3% , (3) exposure to hazardous 
chemicals 16.7%, (4) combat or warzone exposure  7.8%, (5) physical or sexual assault  53.1%, 
(6) witnessed physical/sexual assault  33.2%, (7) witnessed dead bodies/parts unexpectedly 
22.6%, (8) threat of injury to family or close friend due to violence/accident/disaster  32,4%, (9) 
death of family/close friend due to violence/accident/disaster  51.8%, and (10) work ex posure 
11.5%.  The prevalence of sexual assault as a separate category was 29.7% overall, where 
women reported 42.4% and men reported 15.8%  exposure. (Kilpatrick, et al., 2013)   Benjet et al. 
reported international results of the World Mental Health Survey Consortium  in a 24-country 
cohort of 68,894 adults where 29 types of TE  and their interrelationships  were examined . 
(Benjet, et al., 2016)   This study also supports the observation that exposure to TEs is nearly 
omnipresent, and the majority of TE experiencers are exposed to multiple TEs .  The authors 
indicate that further research is required to illuminate the mechanisms accounting for associations of prior TEs with subsequent TEs.  Kilpatrick et al. express the view that a simple single -event criterion for PTSD diagnosis is not 
realistic.  Multiple TE exposures is the norm, with the probability of PTSD increasing with increased exposures; cumulative effects and bi -directional associations between PTSD and TE 
exposure are important to explore – and will have implications for treatment and for identification of risk factors. (Kilpatrick, et al., 2013)   The pi[INVESTIGATOR_753827], and interpretation of ongoing response to prior events requires referral to subsequent events .  In 
regard to multiplicity of exposures, the effect of age of exposure cannot be disregarded.  Felitti et al. (Felitti, et al., 1998)  examined childhood exposures and found that for persons reporting any 
single category of childhood exposure, there was a median 80% probability of exposure to an

11 January 2024     PAGE 19  additional category of event, with a median 54.5% probability of exposure to 2 or more 
additional categories of exposure.  Long- term health consequences (including the 10 leading 
causes of death and specific health conditions) were dose -dependently associated with 
multiplicity of exposure categories. (Felitti, et al., 1998)   Thus, one could speculate that the 
research participant pool of persons with childhood index TEs generally will have a more 
complex PTSD pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103], be less healthy, and potentially more refractory to intervention. 
 
PTSD has a high association with other psychiatric comorbidities.  In a study of members of the 
National Guard deployed to Iraq, PTSD was associated with higher impairment in social adjustment and lower quality of life than all other diagnoses in the survey, including depression, other forms of anxiety and alcohol abuse . (Kehle, et al., 2011)   Civilians with PTSD also have a 
high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_753828], including a 5.7 times higher risk of having a major depressive epi[INVESTIGATOR_753829], 15.5 times greater risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_139742], and a 6 to 15 times higher risk of a suicide attempt . (Davidson, et al., 1991)  
(Kessler, R.C, 2000)   Interestingly, the elevated risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_753830] . (Kessler, R.C, 2000)   In addition, 
in patients with PTSD and comorbid substance abuse, treatment of PTSD improves symptoms of substance abuse, but treatment directed toward substance abuse does not appear to ameliorate PTSD symptoms . (Hien, et al., 2009)    
 
Treatment for Posttraumatic Stress (PTSD)  
 Given the scope and disabling nature of PTSD, much work has been done to identify effective treatment options.  The mainstay of pharmacologic treatment in PTSD is administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors . (Stein & McAllister, 2009)   Studied to a lesser extent 
were monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_146617], which also demonstrated some efficacy in treatment of symptoms. (Stein & McAllister, 2009)   Finally, some studies have reported on the use of 
antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_72467], including carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], with good effect . (Van Etten ML, et. al., 
1998)  
 There also appears to be a role for psychotherapy in the management of PTSD.  Two of the most-studied modalities are trauma -focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TFCBT) and eye -
movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR).  In clinical trials, TFCBT and EMDR are both effective in the management of PTSD . (Bisson J & Andrew M, 2007)   Furthermore, 
efficacy is roughly similar to pharmacologic therapy, and some studies even suggest that psychotherapy is more effective than pharmacotherapy. (Van Etten ML, et. al., 1998)  
 The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the [LOCATION_002], however, convened a study committee to assess efficacy of PTSD treatments.  Their findings, reported in 2007, concluded that the evidence was inadequate to determine efficacy in the treatment of PTSD wi th the alpha-
adrenergic blocker prazosin, anticonvulsants, the novel antipsychotics olanzapi[INVESTIGATOR_146617], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], MAOIs phenelzine and brofaromine, SSRIs, other antidepressants, and other drugs (e.g., naltrexone, cycloserine, or inositol).  One committee member did not concur with the committee’s consensus on two conclusions, arguing that there was suggestive evidence for the efficacy of SSRIs and novel antipsychotic medications.

(Bresslau, et al., 2001a)  (Breslau, et al., 1991)  (Kehle, et al., 2011)  
 
Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)  
 
FDA has cleared rTMS  for major depressive disorder .  rTMS is a noninvasive method to cause  
depolarization  or hyperpolarization of  neurons in the brain.  It uses electromagnetic induction  to 
induce weak electric currents  using a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_753834]; this can cause activity in 
specific or general parts of the brain with minimal discomfort, allowing the functioning and 
interconnections of the brain to be studied.  Most rTMS  treatment protocols are carried out with 
unified stimulation parameters, such as dorsolateral left prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) stimulation for patients with major depressive disorder using a10 Hz repetitive pulse at 120% of motor threshold (MT), 5 days a we ek for 6 weeks. (See Table 1  below) A variety of TMS  protocols 
have been tested as a treatment tool for various neurological and psychiatric disorders including migraine, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, tinnitus, depression, and auditory hallucinati on.  
Mayer et al. concludes that  some participant s may derive long- term benefit from the  rTMS 
course. (Mayer, Aviram, Walter, Levkovitz, & Bloch, 2012)   However, there is a lack of clinical 
trials to show the safety and efficacy of rTMS in persons with PTSD .   
 The rTMS system to be used in this study has been shown to have an excellent safety profile, with nearly all adverse events being minor.  In a review  (Janicak, et al., 2008)  of three rTMS 
studies involving [ADDRESS_1031909] common adverse event was headache, reported in 58.2% of active and 55.1% of sham groups.  Headache wa s assessed by [CONTACT_753889] 
“severe” in 4.2% of active TMS and 5.1% of sham groups.  Transient headache, which resolves 
spontaneously or with  mild analgesics, is the most common adverse effect of rTMS in adults.  
Site pain was reported by 35.8% in active TMS group and 3.8% in the sham group.  Pain was reported as “severe” in 6.1% of active and none in the sham.  All other adverse events were very infrequent across all groups. The eTMS  protocol is conducted at 50% MT, unlike the standard 
rTMS 10 Hz protocol, which is conducted at 120% MT.  Reduction of % MT intensity reduces 
site pain.  Intensity is reduced when using eTMS protocols when a participant indicates 
discomfort at the starting intensity of  50% MT.  No serious adverse event occurred during the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_133747] a sister trial to this trial ( MeRT-005). 
 
Regarding psychiatric side effects, Rossi et al. report that in comparison with safety data for 
MDD, data for other psychiatric disorders are less complete; however, there is no evidence of a 
clinically different AE or SAE profile in other disorders, including where rTMS is applied for 
co-morbid depressive syndromes. (Rossi, et al., 2020)   High-frequency rTMS has been reported 
to induce manic switch and delusions in patients with depression. (Sakkas, et al., 2003)   
However, while treatment emergent mania has been reported by [CONTACT_753890]. for both low and high 
frequency rTMS in patients  with uni- and bipolar depression following stimulation of the left

11 January 2024     PAGE 21  prefrontal cortex, the overall rate (13 cases) over 53 randomized controlled studies in depression 
appears to be not only low (0.84% versus 0.73% mania for active versus sham treatment, 
respectively), but even below natural switch rates in patients with bipolar disorders receiving 
mood stabilizers (2.3 – 3.45%). (Xia, et al., 2008)  (Rossi, et al., 2020)   Sub-manic symptoms of 
onset or worsening of insomnia, agitation, or anxiety are not uncommon among depressed 
patients receiving high- frequency rTMS in naturalistic settings. (Phillip, et al., 2015)   
Participants with MDD or bi- polar psychiatric disorders are excluded from the MERT- 005-B 
study.  While induced psychotic symptoms  (Zwanzger reported one case of new delusional 
symptoms in a patient undergoing rTMS for MDD (Zwanzger, Robin, Keck, Rupprecht, & 
Padberg, 2002) ), agitation, anxiety, insomnia and suicidal ideation have been reported (Janicak, 
et al., 2008) , Rossi et al. state that it is unknown whether such AEs are more frequent during 
rTMS compared to the natural course of the underlying psychiatric conditions. (Rossi, et al., 
2020)  They note that neither psychotic symptoms nor suicidal ideation have been described in 
normal subjects during or after rTMS and that there exists some evidence for an anti -suicidal 
effect of rTMS in MDD.  (George, et al., 2014)    
 
The [ADDRESS_1031910] entirely on large sham -controlled RCTs.  
The recommendation related to psychiatric AEs is that psychiatric patients undergoing rTMS 
should be “clearly informed about the risk of psychiatric side effects which are not uncommon 
but relatively minor in severity.”  Rossi et al. concluded that t hese psychiatric SAE s occurred at a 
rate between 1 % and 5%, depending on the event  type, but their occurrence did not clearly differ 
between the active and sham treatment groups.  (Rossi, et al., 2020)   The authors provided a 
table of the [ADDRESS_1031911] stimulation – iTBS.  Additionally , 1 trial used dTMS (deep Transcranial Magnetic 
Stimulation) at [ADDRESS_1031912] comparators to the stimulation 
parameters of the eTMS protocol, all were conducted at 110% -  120% MT) as opposed to the 
eTMS protocol, which is conducted at a significantly lower intensity of 50% MT ).  Three of 
these trials were for MDD, 1 for negative symptoms of schizophrenia, and 1 for treatment 
resistant MDD.  For  these 5 trials psychiatric AE and SAE are summarized below  in Table 1, as 
given in the supplemental materials to the 2020 safety recommendations . (Rossi, et al., 2020) .  
These materials are consistent with the observation that when researching  with psychiatric 
populations there will be psychiatric AEs and SAEs, but in this group of trials  these do not 
appear to be related to active stimulation and appear to be, instead, a phenomenon related to the 
population characteristics.

Regarding non- psychiatric adverse events, s evere adverse events associated with  rTMS have 
rarely been reported and most adverse events reported were found to be mild.  Seizure was the 
most serious adverse event .  In 2009 Rossi et al . reported that high frequency rTMS has a 
possible 1.4% crude risk estimate in epi[INVESTIGATOR_125801], and less than 1% in normals; reporting 
that over a 9-year period there were 4 cases of accidental seizures in studies using treatment

reported that as of 2008, there had been 12 case reports of seizures during rTMS in subjects who were healthy, depressed, or had a disorder not known to increase seizure risk.  In all of these cases, stimulation was given near or above the suggested safet y guidelines. (Wasserman, 1998)  
 Hundreds of thousands of TMS treatments have been conducted since the 2009 safety guidelines were published. (Rossi, et al., 2020)  (Rossi, S; Hallett, M; Rossini, P M; Alvaro, P; and The

burst patterns, single/paired pulse versus rTMS, placement of coil, coil design, whether operating outside 2009 safety guidelines – referred to above as elevated protocol risk -  and whether 
subjects had underlying conditions – referred to above as inherent subject factor risks ).  Of the 
25 seizures described by [CONTACT_753891]. (2019) only 5 occurred associated with stimulation of the 
DLPFC during high frequency (>1 H z) stimulation .  Additionally, all 5 of these events occurred 
at frequencies at or above 15 Hz (1 at 15, 3 at 18 and 1 at 20 Hz) .  (eTMS-001 stimulation 
protocol has a ceiling of 13 Hz, but very rarely achieves even this  frequency for individualized 
treatment protocols .)  Seizure was most associated with stimulation of the motor cortex.  Also, 
observed risk associated with use of figure -8 coils (which are used in the eTMS -001 protocol) 
was lower than for double cone or H -coils.

Rossi et al. distinguish between theoretically possible types of TMS -induced seizures: (1) seizure 
during or seconds after trains of rTMS, and (2) temporally displaced seizures potentiated by 
[CONTACT_753892] (“kindling effect”).  The authors report that while 
the former has been observed that no evidence exists that kindling has ever occurred,  i.e., it is 
theoretical only, stating that “… there is no solid evidence for kindling in humans in any 
situation.”  Also, worth noting, i t is advised to be aware that a convulsive syncope may be 
misinterpreted as a seizure – which could be mediated by [CONTACT_753893], dehydration, 
bradycardia or use of medications that cause orthostatic hypotension or reduce cardiac output.  A 
myoclonic jerk observed during syncope is not usually characterized by [CONTACT_753894] a post -ictal state, nor are tongue -biting, incontinence, oral frothing or vomiting 
expected.  Syncope may be managed by [CONTACT_160449]- lowering, hydration, skin- cooling and emotional 
reassurance. (Rossi, et al., 2020)  
 Risk factors for TMS -provoked seizures were reviewed , and while Rossi et al. do not regard the 
presence of one , or even more than one , of these factors to be  a contraindication to TMS, they  
recommend additional precautions for TMS subjects who display them, including potential postponement of the TMS session if multiple transient factors are present  concurrently.  It should 
be noted that Rossi et al. comment that these potentially seizure -lowering risk factors are 
theoretical – not having been seen in clini cal practice.  These include ne uropsychiatric conditions 
bearing a higher risk for developi[INVESTIGATOR_506884] , such as MDD (especially if intercurrent with 
dementia or recent stroke , underweight, current smoking, alcoholism, drug abuse, and concurrent 
use of cephalosporins and antiarrhythmics – especially propranolol)  schizophrenia , autism, 
bipolar disorder and alcohol abuse .  However, prior to every treatment, participant status is 
assessed – including vital signs, general health status, adverse events, recent sl eep deprivation, 
alcohol consumption and medication changes.  Additionally, Rossi et al. recommend neurophysiological monitoring for signs of increased cortical excitation (observation during 
stimulation for muscle twitching). (Rossi, et al., 2020)  
 
 
[ADDRESS_1031914] at the outset of antidepressant treatment. (Hunter, et al., 2019;9;e01275)   
Experimental pharmaco -TMS-EEG studies in single or paired -pulse paradigms demonstrate 
effects of CNS drugs on measures of cortical excitability, connectivity, and plasticity (Ziemann, TMS and drugs, 2004) ; the therapeutic effects of rTMS are thought to be the result of long- term 
potentiation or long- term depression effects in brain circuits. (Kobayashi, et al., 2017)  (Ziemann, 
et al., 2015)  Thus, similar mechanisms of action are posited for rTMS and CNS medications. 
Recent publications have addressed the safety and efficacy issues associated with the use of concomitant medications during the course of rTMS treatment. (Hunter, et al., 2019;9;e01275)    
 A 2016 consensus indicates that TMS therapy can be administered both with and without antidepressant or other psychotropic medications. (Perera, et al., 2016)   In 2018, McClintock et 
al. advised caution in administering rTMS to persons taking medications that may lower seizure 
threshold, or following a decrease or discontinuation of antiepi[INVESTIGATOR_23698], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_753835] . (McClintock, et al., 2018)   Partially contradicting the McClintock caution 
(specifically the blanket caution for medications that lower threshold) , the 2009 safety guidelines 
(Rossi, S; Hallett, M; Rossini, P M; Alvaro, P; and The Safety of TMS Consensus Group, 2009) , 
revised in 2020 (Rossi, et al., 2020) , represent a sea- change regarding views on the concurrent 
use of psychoactive concomitant medications and medications known to lower seizure threshold.  Whereas the 2009 safety guidelines advised caution in the application of TMS in persons taking medications known to lower seizure threshold, the consensus group states that “the currently 
available data showing low seizure rate no longer support this recommendation.”  They 
refer to this as a “theoretical risk” that has not been substantiated.  Instead, the  group 
recommends documentation of concurrent  intake of drugs and other potentially seizure threshold 
lowering factors (such as sleep deprivation, infection, alcohol consumption) during TMS application and systematic capture/reporting of side effect data.   The authors state, “We 
recommend that vigilance is warranted if rTMS is applied in patients receiving concomitant pharmacotherapy with medication that has pro- convulsant properties, although no additional risk 
has been documented to date.” (Rossi, et al., 2020)  
 Noting a paucity of efficacy data associating standard medication classes with rTMS treatment 
outcome, Hunter et al. explored the clinical relationship in depression studies of a wider range of concomitant medications to rTMS , including SSRI, SNRI, TCA, MAOI, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_753836], atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], typi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
quasi-benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], psychostimulants, lithium, and ‘other’ (amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050], baclofen, buspi[INVESTIGATOR_5331], 
clonidine, ephedrine, prazosin, propranolol, tizanidine, and verapamil) . (Hunter, et al., 
2019;9;e01275)   In the 181-patient sample over 30% were taking medications during acute 
rTMS treatment for depression in the following non- exclusive categories:  SSRI, atypi[INVESTIGATOR_753836], atypi[INVESTIGATOR_16709], anti -epi[INVESTIGATOR_23698], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], and psychostimulants.

indicated that a broader group of GABA agonists which included benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651] (but also

Neuromodulation Therapy (SNT) protocol consists of five days of intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) administered at 10 sessions per day (Cole, et al., 2022) .  Additional e vidence 
suggests that improvement in depressive symptoms may be achieved using accelerated rTMS (Holtzheimer, et al., 2010)  (Baeken, et al., 2013)  (George, et al., 2014)  (Modirrousta, Meek, & 
Wikstrom, 2018) .  The side effect profile for accelerated rTMS has  been shown to be similar to 
once-daily rTMS, with the most common being headache (28.4%), fatigue (8.6%), and 
pain/discomfort at the stimulation site (8.3) (Caulfield, Fleischmann, George, & McTeague, 2022).  In addition, literature suggests that accelerated rTMS has similar minimal risk of seizure 
compared to once -daily rTMS, and does not increase the number of serious adverse events .  It 
has been shown that treatment duration, in number of days required, is  a factor in compliance to 
clinical trial protocols  (Jin, Sklar, Oh, & Li, 2008) .  Although the preponderance of existing data 
in support of Accelerated rTMS is directed at patients with Major depression, the safety and efficacy profiles of rTMS are similar between Major Depression and PTSD populations  (Philip, 
Doherty, Faucher, Aiken, & Wout -Frank, 2022).  By [CONTACT_753895] -a-day sessions, the number of 
treatment days is reduced, lowering the burden on the participant, and increasing the likelihood of compliance to the protocol. 
Electroencephalogram (EEG) personalized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (eTMS)  
 
The Sponsor of eTMS -PTSD-001 has developed a personalized biometrics -guided protocol 
known as Electroencephalogram (EEG) personalized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (eTMS).  The protocol has also been referred to as MeRT.  The eTMS  protocol is tailored 
specifically to each person’s  EEG intrinsic alpha  frequency (IAF).  If  an IAF from the EEG 
cannot be found, the participant will be excluded from the study. 
The location of stimulation will be  fixed at Fz (Frontal Midline as per the 10/20 system) .  
Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a gross measure of brain electrical activit y from the scalp.  
Amplitude of a given activity reflects the degree of neuronal synchronization underneath the recording lead.  The relative magnitude distribution among different frequency bands reflects the brain status, whether in sleep, relaxation, or vigilance.  In addition to epi[INVESTIGATOR_753840], individuals with di fferent mental disorders often have different patterns in their 
EEG profile.  The eTMS treatment protocol is based on the physics principle of resonance and is 
intended to restore the physiological rhythm.

Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.[ADDRESS_1031916] rTMS protocols call for stimula tion at 120% of motor threshold (MT), eTMS  
stimulation intensity is generally set at 50% or less of motor threshold -  and will be set at 50% 
MT in the trial.  If a participant reports discomfort, intensity will be reduced according to a 
written protocol . Sponsor’s protocols follow  the medical consensus on maximum safe exposure 
as indicated in the safety review  by [CONTACT_291339] . (Rossi, S; Hallett, M; Rossini, P M; Alvaro, P; 
and The Safety of TMS Consensus Group, 2009) . See Table 2, below , comparing the 
characteristics of eTMS treatment with recommended protocols for cleared rTMS devices.  
 
Preliminary Data  
 
Stimulation will be at a fixed location at the midline on the frontal cortex (Fz).  The prefrontal cortex, which is close to the Fz location, is a common stimulation site for rTMS treatment, and has shown to have no increase in any adverse event.  The rTMS treatment parameters for the 
devices that were  cleared at the time of initiation of this trial by [CONTACT_753896] (MDD) target this region ( Tonica/MagVenture MagVita, Neuronetics 
NeuroStar, Brainsway DTMS, and MagStim Rapid2) .  The site is relatively far from the occipi[INVESTIGATOR_177360], cerebellum, and other regions that might affect vision or autonomic function.  The Sponsor 
has treated over 5,000 patients off -label at the Fz position without a serious adverse event. 
Adverse events such as seizure or site pain are at, or below, those reported in rTMS studies. More than 20 510(k) clearances of de novo petitions have been granted by [CONTACT_753897], including a de novo and a clearance for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.  
(See Table 2 below) These  clearances have largely been for a variety of changes  to the initial 
devices (addition or deletion of accessories or software, or coil capabilities) or their  treatment 
protocols (mostly reductions in intertrain intervals or the introduction of a novel rhythm 
capability called intermittent Theta burst stimulation) , although several new manufacturers also 
have received clearances.  
 In a prospective, open- label trial, Sponsor’s predecessor  corporation successfully identified and 
treated 21 patients with PTSD, using quantitative EEG/ECG -guided transcranial magnetic 
stimulation.  Analysis showed that 100% of patients who completed a 2 week or longer course of treatment responded with an average 61% reduction in symptom severity as measured by [CONTACT_88806] -M 
(Taghva, et al., 2015) .  Most participants who experienced , at the screening visit, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_753841], memory loss, attention deficit, or  headache reported significant improvement in these 
symptoms following MeRT  treatment. 
 A randomized, double -blind sham-controlled trial of veterans with PTSD was conducted by 
[CONTACT_2728]’s predecessor .  Data from the preliminary dataset are available. Eighty- six (86) 
participants were randomized to MeRT  or Sham MeRT. After completion of phase 1, the 
randomized, blinded portion of the study, participants  continued to be treated, unblinded, with 
active MeRT for an additional two weeks in phase 2.  The P er Protocol (PP) data analysis set 
consisted of 80 participants ; 6 (3 Sham MeRT -treated, 3 MeRT-treated) were removed from the 
intent to treat analysis population for protocol deviations , such as incomplete study treatment  or 
data collection , or medical issues.   All removals  were determined prior to unblinding the decision 
makers.  As displayed in Figure 1, below , the MeRT-treated group showed a statistically 
significantly higher therapeutic effect than the Sham -treated group in the double -blind phase.

Stage 2 
Stage 2 is intended to establish the efficacy  and safety of eTMS for treatment of PTSD in the 
target population.  The primary outcome of the trial for Stage 2 is  reduction in symptoms of 
PTSD as calculated by [CONTACT_753900] -5 assessment.   A total of 140 participants

Suicidality and Harm to Others  
 High suicide risk individuals will be ineligible  as well as those with clinically significant 
psychopathology or other psychiatric disorder s that may pose a safety threat to the participant.  
The U.S. Army Medical Command ([LOCATION_002] Army Medical Command, 2014)  screens 
individuals discharged from emergency departments and inpatient units. MEDCOM uses the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) with triage points.  The [ADDRESS_1031924] a measure of suicide risk, but these are some of the individuals for whom MeRT should be tested for benefit.  It is therefore inappropriate to declare all persons with suicidal ideation ineligible.  A triage plan tailored to the eTMS -PTSD-001will 
be implemented that considers the competing considerations of allowing enrollment of individuals with some measure of suicidal ideation yet excluding individuals at higher levels of risk, who require immediate intervention.  
 At the BL Visit, potential participants will be administered the C -SSRS. The C-SSRS 
incorporates findings from suicide literature and has prospective data that validates the scale’s ability to identify risk probability ranges for potential future suicidal behaviors . The first [ADDRESS_1031925] inappropriate targets (e.g., if active 
military personnel express homicidal feelings toward individuals who a re not enemies of the 
[LOCATION_002]), screening will be terminated. All individuals deemed ineligible due to suicidal ideation, whether deemed at imminent risk or not, will be given resource information  that 
explains where resources and assistance may be o btained. Individuals deemed ineligible on the 
basis of suicide risk or homicidal ideation are permanently ineligible for the trial.  
When an individual is screened and meets the exclusion criteria for suicidal risk or expresses inappropriate homicidal intent, the Medical Monitor, Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_022]/her medically qualified designee will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530]. If the Medical Monitor, Site PI/designee deems the individual to be at imminent risk, an emergency medical service or the police will be called to transport that individual to the nearest civilian hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], or to the appropriate military hospi[INVESTIGATOR_753843].  If  the individual is not deemed to be at imminent risk, the individual will be 
advised to call or present to the closest Emergency Department, call 911, or the appropriate crisis hotline.

manufactured by [CONTACT_753901], A/S, a sister company of MagVenture.  Specific application 
of the device can be arranged by [CONTACT_753902], varied in stimulation 
area (<1” to >10”), rate (single pulse to <30/sec for the R30 stimulator used in the eTMS -PTSD-
001 trial), and output intensity (up to 3.9 tesla) depending on the triggering program and type of coils.   
 For Stage [ADDRESS_1031926] the head by a mechanical arm . 
 For Stage 2 randomized portion, a special setup will be used to maintain participant blinding while ensuring that no magnetic field stimulation is administered . 
 During EEG recording procedures and treatment procedures, t he participant and technician will 
be on opposite sides of a temporary barrier that will allow the technician to keep eyes on both the participant and the equipment at the same time.  All necessary cabling will be run in order to allow the stimulator along  with all equipment controls and displays to be located on the 
technician’s side of the barrier.  
 The coil (which will be on the participant’s side of the barrier along with its positioning arm) will be positioned against the participant’s head.  The coil will be connected to the technician-
side stimulator for active eTMS treatments but will not be con nected to the stimulator for sham 
eTMS study treatments.  A different coil will be connected to the stimulator for sham eTMS treatments and will be placed in a basket close by [CONTACT_753903].  The technician will initiate and end treatment sessions and will observe the stimulator for any error codes.   
 During the treatment, active -assigned participants will experience repetitive tappi[INVESTIGATOR_753844].  Some may feel uncomfortable with the physical sensation on the scalp, or with the clicking noise made by [CONTACT_371191].  If a participant experiences discomfort, the stimulus intensity may be reduced, and sponge mufflers may be given to block the noise.  The subjective experience during sham eTMS treatment includes hearing a clicking noise from the active coil, which is attached to the stimulator, but h idden from view.  
 The MagPro R30 is FDA 510k- cleared (K061645) , as are the additional members of the MagPro 
family (including the MagPro X100 (K091940) ) under 21 CFR §882.1870 as Evoked Response 
Electrical Stimulator s.  The cleared indication is to stimulate peripheral nerves for diagnostic 
purposes; however, all components  are also included in a cleared system (MagVita TMS System) 
where the clearance is for rTMS .  The Cool-B65 coils are FDA-cleared under K071821.  The 
MagVita TMS System, which uses the MagPro Stimulator family (MagPro R30, MagPro X100, and more recently MagPro R20), is cleared by [CONTACT_753904] (K150641).

Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.[ADDRESS_1031927] quantitative EEG analysis routine will be carried out.  A 19 -channel EEG, placed 
according to international 10- 20 montage, will be acquired using the WR19 System  
(manufacturer, Zeto, Inc., K17275) .  The device is a  full-montage standard 
electroencephalograph  indicated for use in a health care facility or clinical research environment 
to acquire, transmit, display and store primarily EEG signals.  The Zeto also incorporates ECG 
capability.  
 
Study treatment is implemented with stimulus parameters determined by [CONTACT_1034]’s proprietary algorithm using input from EEG  and ECG recordings that will be uploaded to its 
servers via internet.   The stimulus parameters will be downloaded via internet to the MagVita 
device after EEG processing and individualized treatment parameter determination.  
 
Data will be digitized at 500 points/sec during the A/D conversion and stored on computer hard 
disk.  Once completed, the data will be uploaded to servers hosting Sponsor's proprietary algorithms for analysis.  Raw data will be filtered to reject artifacts before quantitative analysis.  A minimal period of 60- second artifact -free, resting EEG is necessary for analysis.  An FFT 
routine with a 2,048- point window will be used to calculate the power density of each frequency 
for each channel  to yield spectra wi th 0.125 Hz frequency resolution.  A dominant EEG 
frequency in the band of 8 -  13 will be detected automatically from the power spectra.  This 
highly individualized EEG r esonant frequency will then be used to program the MagVita to 
deliver the required eTMS  pulses.  If minimal requirements for clean data are not met, then a 
new EEG will be requested by [CONTACT_2728]’s software.  
Blinding 
 
This study is randomized, double -blind, and sham -controlled.  It is not triple -blind, i.e., the 
treating technician/coordinator will know the participant’s study assignment.  Participants, Investigators and assessors will be blind to treatment assignment.  Specifically, no primary or secondary outcome data will be collected by, or seen by, the unblinded technician/coordinator.  Additionally, exploratory outcomes will be self -administered with electronic data capture, and 
also will not be seen or collected by [CONTACT_229190]. The technician/coordinator will have reduced contact [CONTACT_753905]’s previous eTMS clinical trials, due to increased remote data collection (also leading to reduced dwell time at the clinic), and barrier separation from technicians during as much of the EEG/ECG and treatment procedures as is physically possible.  Blinding challenges arise from visual, aural, and proprioceptive sources.  Unless the connection of the coil assembly to the stimulator is hidden from the participant, the participant will know if the coil used is or is not properly engaged with the stimul ator.  The discharging coil head 
produces a clicking sound at the frequency of discharge that is audible to the participant.  Additionally, the discharge of the coil head on the forehead is accompanied by a tappi[INVESTIGATOR_739148], sometimes strong enough to produce discomfort.  The Test Phase of this trial relies on a combination of visual barriers and exclusion of persons who have in the past received any form of rTMS treatment to accomplish blinding of the participant.

for stability.  The engaged coil is held to the forehead of active -assigned participants and the 
unengaged coil is held to the forehead of sham -assigned participants.   The coil to be used with 
the participant is threaded through a barrier sufficient to hide whether the stimulator connection 
part of the assembly is engaged with the stimulator or merely tied down nearby.  
 When the active coil is held to the active -assigned participant’s head, the participant experiences 
a clicking noise emanating from the coil in the vicinity of their forehead.  When the sham coil is held to the sham -assigned participant’s head, the partici pant experiences a clicking noise 
emanating from the active coil behind the barrier in the vicinity of the stimulator.   Therefore, regardless of which coil is held to the participant’s head, the participant experiences a clicking noise originating from the active coil.  rTMS naïve individuals do not have any experience that would indicate whether the sound should be heard at the forehead or in the vicinity of the stimulator; therefore, both groups would be expected to conclude that they are receiving active treatment.  Active treatment also causes a tappi[INVESTIGATOR_753845]’s forehead due to contraction of the muscles in the forehead.  This sensation will be absent for participants in the sham eTMS assigned group.  The participants in this trial  are naïve to rTMS and eTMS treatment 
so that they will have no point of comparison regarding this sensation.  The treating technicians are unavoidably unblinded.  The issue of blinding technology for rTMS trials with equipment using observable coils is sparse, and studies conducted using differing blinding strategies have conflicting efficacy outcomes, making it difficult to determine a winning study design.  A rece nt clearance by [CONTACT_753906] (K173620) was based on a trial where both the participants and the treating technicians were unblinded – only the assessment staff were blinded to treatment assignment. (Blumberger & et. al., 2018)   It underscores the difficulty of selecting a blinding 
strategy that FDA has accepted assessor -only blinded studies . 
 
Study Treatment Parameters  
 
The stimulus parameters for the algorithmically determined, individualized, active eTMS  
treatment will be downloaded to the MagVita for all participants . 
 Stimulation frequency for treatment will be individualized according to each  participant’s EEG.  
Stimulus rate is determined by [CONTACT_39359]’s intrinsic  alpha EEG frequency.  This  biometric 
measure is highly variable from person to person.  Active eTMS  delivers an algorithmically 
determined resonant frequency via repetitive electromagnetic stimulation.   The stimulus 
frequency range is constrained to vary between 8 and 13 Hz, thus the upper frequency range of 
eTMS stimulation is within the range of conventional rTMS already cleared by [CONTACT_8415] , which is 
between 10 and 18 Hz .  The frequency range more likely to precipi[INVESTIGATOR_753846], not the lower end.  
 Stimulation intensity is chosen according to the participant ’s motor threshold.  The eTMS  
treatment delivers subthreshold magnetic stimulation at 50% of motor threshold.  Because the

rTMS intensity is supra -threshold, thus designed to cause neuronal depolarization, and is cleared 
to be used at 150% of the eTMS  recommended intensity, i.e. , 120% of motor threshold.  Motor 
threshold is determined by [CONTACT_753907] a 
standardized procedure outlined in the study Manual of Procedures (MoP) .  MT determination is 
performed before the first treatment of each 5 -week treatment period ( i.e., Blinded and Open-
label). 
 
The stimulation dose is 5- seconds of repetitive stimulation, with an intertrain interval of [ADDRESS_1031929] -trial access to the active study treatment  will 
be provided.  F or both ethical and recruitment purposes, the re will be up to 20 additional 
treatments of open -label active eTMS treatment  offered to participants  who are part of the Sham 
eTMS Group who complete 75% of their assigned blinded treatment (15 treatments) , unless the 
site PI [INVESTIGATOR_753847] (e.g., if the participant begins medications 
that lower seizure threshold, or experiences an adverse event such as a negative health or 
psychological event that would have excluded them from the blinded study) . 
 
Basis of Study Treatment Parameter Selection  
 
Treatment with rTMS (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) requires the specification of 
many treatment parameters.   Within-session parameters that must be specified include  stimulus 
waveform (square wave, triangle wave, sine wave), coil geometry (depth -focality tradeoff), field 
intensity, frequency of stimulation during the pulse train, duration of the pulse train, duration of 
the quiet period, number of pulse train- quiet period cycles in the treatment session.   Course-of-
treatment parameters that must be specified include the number of treatment sessions and the 
spacing of sessions.  
 
As is the case with many forms of medical treatment, understanding of the mechanism of rTMS 
action is incomplete.   A review by [CONTACT_753908], et al.  (Leuchter, Cook, Jin, & Phillips, 2013)  
considered the mechanism of action in rTMS treatment of depression. The authors concluded 
that benefits of rTMS were tied to enhanced neuroplasticity and the resetting of corticothalamic 
pathways.  While this assessment may provide a conceptual basis for an understanding, it does 
not provide quantitative specification of treatment parameters.  This being the case, our best 
recourse was to review the prior clinical literature.  
 
The greatest body of prior experience is in the treatment of depression.  Most  rTMS treatments 
for depression were carried out with standardized stimulation parameters, typi[INVESTIGATOR_753848] 10 Hz stimulation at 120% of motor threshold.  The early 
cleared rTMS devices used this standard 10 Hz protocol  – largely 37.5- minute sessions, [ADDRESS_1031930] Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 36  per week for 6 weeks, with 10 pulses per second in 4 second trains, with  an intertrain interval of 
26 seconds.  This resulted in 3,000 pulses per session.  One cleared device used 18 Hz 
stimulation at 120% of motor threshold 5 days per week for 4 weeks, with 18 pulses per second 
in 2 second trains, with  an intertrain interval of 20 seconds  – resulting in 1980 pulses per session. 
The number of total pulses per 15- minute session for this study is dependent upon the treatment 
pulse frequency.  At a pulse frequency of 8 Hz, the total number of pulses is 1,340 per session.  
At 13 Hz, the total number  of pulses increases to 2,340 per session.  
 
Research has been directed to investigating individualized treatment parameters based on the 
pre-treatment EEG.  This has been done in the treatment of schizophrenia (Jin, et al., 2006) , (Jin, 
et al., 2012) and treatment of depression . (Jin & Phillips, 2014)   Recent publications suggest that 
clinical response is highly sensitive to small differences between the treatment frequency and the 
intrinsic alpha frequency.  Specifically, it has been observed, in clinical trials of rTMS for Major 
Depressive Disorder tha t neurostimulation appears to be more efficacious when the stimulation 
frequency is closest to the subject’s IAF -  with a quadratic relationship between clinical outcome 
and proximity of the [ADDRESS_1031931]’s IAF frequen cy. 
(Roelofs, et al., 2020)  (Corlier, et al., 2019)   The eTMS-PTSD-001 trial extends this work; it 
utilizes the pre-treatment EEG to specify treatment frequency  at the intrinsic alpha frequency ..  
 
Comparison of eTMS  Study Active Treatment Exposure with  FDA-Cleared rTMS Treatments  
 
Table 1, below, shows a side -by-side comparison of eTMS  active treatment parameters and 
exposures with treatment regimens already recommended for use by [CONTACT_8415] .  The [ADDRESS_1031932] -cleared 
rTMS devices  (those devices already cleared when the protocol for the eTMS-PTSD-001 trial 
was written): Neuronetics NeuroStar, Brainsway DTMS, MagStim Rapid2, and 
Tonica/MagVenture MagVita, along with accompanying 510k submission numbers, appear  on 
rows [ADDRESS_1031933] 10 Hz treatment  protocols (1440 pulses at 8Hz to  2340 pulses at 13Hz  for eTMS, versus 
3000 pulses at 10Hz  for other protocols).  The Brainsway DTMS System  is an outlier from the 
other three devices in that its protocol uses  fewer pulses per train, but at the higher frequency of 
18Hz (instead of [ADDRESS_1031934]  device protocol delivers 36 pulse trains at 18 pulses per second for 2 
seconds).  eTMS treatment uses a [ADDRESS_1031935] interval between pulse trains ( similar to the [ADDRESS_1031936] 18 Hz protocol ).  
 The four cleared rTMS  stimulation systems described above use rapi[INVESTIGATOR_68236], or pulsed, 
magnetic fields to induce electrical currents in regions of the cerebral cortex by [CONTACT_292431] a magnetic coil into contact [CONTACT_753909].  These cleared devices use standardized treatment frequency and placement of stimulation.  All are cleared for use in the prefrontal cortex.  These systems are recommended for use at 150% higher amplitude of stimulation than used in the eTMS treatment protocols  - 120% of motor threshold (i.e., suprathr eshold stimulation) -  versus 
50% of motor threshold (i.e., subthreshold stimulation) for eTMS  treatment protocols.

Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.[ADDRESS_1031937] 10 Hz protocols .  eTMS uses 2 
sessions/day, 5 days per week, for a total of 2 0 treatment sessions over a period of 3 weeks  
(allowing for missed treatment days) . Tonica/MagVenture MagVita, Neuronetics Neu roStar, and 
MagStim Rapid2 use [ADDRESS_1031938] been multiple  510k clearances (18) for rTMS treatment, and a successful de 
novo submission for rTMS  adjunct treatment of Obsessive -Compulsive Disorder (OCD).  Some 
of these clearances represent changes in the intertrain interval to create shorter treatment sessions  
(labeling changes allowing a reduction of the intertrain interval to as little as 11 seconds for devices that previously had protocols with fixed 26 second intertrain intervals).  Two marketing approvals represent a fundamentally different  stimulation rhythm profile called theta -burst TMS, 
one of which is intermittent Theta burst stimulation (iTBS) .  See (Huang, 2005) ; (Blumberger & 
et. al., 2018) Thus, during the past [ADDRESS_1031939] begun to experiment with 
changes to some elements of the treatment protocol parameter space.  FDA has responded by [CONTACT_753910], intertrain intervals, and treatment 
schedule regimens.  The Blumberger et. al. study was pi[INVESTIGATOR_753849] (K173620) of an 
iTBS protocol for the treatment of depression in 2018. (Caulfield K. A., 2020)   However, as of

Changes in Treatment  
 
Treatment personalization is based on 500 per second sampling rate EEG s.  Every participant’s 
Screening EEG will be used to establish the initial stimulus parameters.  A final EEG/ECG will be conducted on the last treatment day or during the F 1 period (D+10 through D+ 21). 
 
STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
IRB Approval  
 
Prior to recruitment activities for  the study, written approval of the protocol informed consent  
process, and any other approvals required by [CONTACT_753912] (IRB) .  It is anticipated that multiple strategies for recruitment may 
be used, i.e., flyers, outreach to health care providers, direct advertising via radio or internet.  All recruitment materials required to be approved by [CONTACT_753913].  
 Recruitment Considerations  and Incentives  
 
All recruitment activities involving active military participants will be compliant with DoDI 3216.02 regarding coercion and perceived coercion.  DoDI 3216.02 specifies rul es whereby 
[CONTACT_753914].  Only civilian personnel trained in recruitment (i.e., Study Site Coordinators) will be allowed to offer information to potential 
participants.  In addition, no military or civilian personnel with potential supervisory influence 
over a subordinate participant will be allowed in the room when the potential participant is being recruited.  The Study Site PI [INVESTIGATOR_753850] 3216.[ADDRESS_1031953] Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 42  All participants may opt- in to free-of-charge recruitment incentive background supportive 
treatment (BST).  During the Stage [ADDRESS_1031954] to consenting of 
active military duty participants, the study data collection personnel are civilians , and in 
accordance with coercion mitigation requirements of DoDI 3216.02(e)(1)(b) and (c), are not in the chain of command for any potential active -duty military participants in this clinical trial.  No 
service member superior , or equivalent civilian, will be present during the consent process.  
  The consent process involves feedback from the potential participant in the form of questions/items of discussion that demonstrate participant understanding of the study procedures, 
and ethical and scientific design.   These items touch on (1) voluntariness /freedom to withdraw, 
(2) the importance of the participant accurately report ing metal or biomedical devices on or in 
their body, (3) the safety issue connected with having a history of seizures, ( 4) any prohibition on 
beginning use of certain drugs during the study, ( 5) the number of treatments to be undergone , 
and (6) a discomfort  and a common side effect.  In the Stage [ADDRESS_1031955] 
participated in receiving 75% of the Sham treatments  to which they were assigned.  If an item is 
not comprehended by [CONTACT_2299], the consent process requires a discussion of the item until the person obtaining consent is confident that the potential participant understands it.  The person 
obtaining consent is asked to endorse and document key aspects of the process , i.e., (1) that the 
study was discussed – including, but not limited to, all potential risks, benefits, discomforts, and 
participant responsibilities, (2) that the participant read the entire ICF at his/her own pace, (3) that the participant was given the opport unity to ask questions, (4) that the consent process was 
conducted prior to initiation of any study procedures or data collection, and (5) that the 
participant was given a copy of the signed and dated ICF.   
 
Certificate of Confidentiality  
 
A Certificate of Confidentiality (CoC) protects the privacy of research participants by [CONTACT_248403], sensitive research information to anyone no connected to the research except when the participant consents or in a few other specific situations (potential harm to themselves or others).  A CoC may be obtained through the National Institute of Health (NIH).  Since this study comprises assessments of potential illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_54238], a CoC will be obtained before the study begins.  All participants in the study will receive a CoC as part of their Informed Consent process.  All trial personnel will be trained and tested to ensure they comply with the tenets of the CoC regarding every participant.   
Withdrawal from Study  
 
Participants have the right to withdra w from the study at any time, for any reason.  The 
Investigator may withdraw a participant from the trial for the safety of the participant, other 
participants, or study personnel.  The Investigator may similarly suspend or terminate only a participant’s treatment protocol and may re -initiate a suspended treatment protocol.  Participants 
who withdraw, or are withdrawn, from the study will be asked to complete Early Termination assessments.  Participants for whom the tre atment protocol only is suspended or terminated, are 
regarded as ongoing participants in the study, and will be asked to complete all data collection visits and data collection procedures regardless of treatment status.  
 The IRB may terminate the trial.  The Food and Drug Administration may terminate the trial under an IDE.  The study Sponsor may terminate the trial for the following reasons:  
 
• Occurrence of unacceptable risk to the participants enrolled in the study 
• Upon recommendation of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board to terminate the trial for futility or for safety reasons  
• A business decision on the part of Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, evaluation, or development of the product  
 Participants who are withdrawn, or whose treatment protocols are suspended or terminated due to adverse events will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event, or until

possible to do so.  
Assignment of Participant Identification  
 
Each study recruitment site will be assigned a unique identifying code.  A unique participant identification number and participant character code identifier will be assigned to every potential participant who gives consent  at the Screening Visit  and provides any data at the Baseline Visit .  
Every participant will be uniquely identified by [CONTACT_753915].  All identifiers will be recorded on all study data collected .  A file linking the study identifiers to the participant’s name 
[CONTACT_753951] a locked cabinet in a secure location .  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_229954] a copy of the linkage document periodically (e.g., weekly), and will store it in a locked cabinet in a secure location.  
 To maintain confidentiality, the participant’s name [CONTACT_753952]’s study paper files, or on any input to the study electronic database.  Any consent forms or paper copi[INVESTIGATOR_20583], will be filed separately from other study forms and 
will not bear the participant’s numerical or character identifiers.   
 The MagVita device input field requirements , and study identifiers will be harmonized.  
Photographs/avatars or other identifiers will be used as part of the setup screens to ensure that the 
individualized study treatment protocol calculated for the individual  is what the stimulator  
outputs to the engaged coil to ensure the safety of participants assigned to active eTMS . 
 
Baseline Visit and Eligibility Determination  
 Potential participants will undergo assessments and EEG recording during a Baseline Visit (BL), which occurs on -site following the Screening Visit (SC).  Eligibility is determined after all BL 
procedures have been conducted, results have  been reviewed, and the EEG has been reviewed for 
neurological and EEG quality exclusionary conditions.  A neurologist or neurosurgeon with adequate training and experience in reading EEGs  will review EEG quality.  If a potential 
neurological exclusionary condition is noted by [CONTACT_2728] , i.e., general or focal slowing or ictal 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988], it will be brought to the attention of a medically  qualified Investigator  or member of the 
IDE Sponsor’s staff, who  will be consulted to confirm eligibility status.   
 If a potential participant is  a female of child -bearing potential (i.e., not [ADDRESS_1031956] -menopausal, 
and not sterile by [CONTACT_753916]) , a urine pregnancy test will be conducted.  
Unless the test is negative, the individual is not eligible to participate.  The site Investigator or Clinic Coordinator will provide the result of the test to the potential participant.  If the result is positive or indeterminate, the individual will be advised to confirm with a health care provider.  A copy of the test package insert will be provided to each  individual and the possibility of both 
false negative and false positive results noted.  If it is determined at a later date, after the screening period has expi[INVESTIGATOR_5697], that the potential participant is not pregnant, then the screening process can be repeated in totality, and if she is eligible, she may be enrolled.   
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.[ADDRESS_1031957] been reviewed by [CONTACT_9257], and s/he has confirmed, in writing that enrollment 
may proceed.  No participant  will be enrolled without such written confirmation. 
 
Continued eligibility related to safety factors will be checked before conducting active eTMS  
treatment in the open -label extension for those participants who opt -in. 
 
Additional Considerations for Stage 2 Randomized Controlled Trial  
 
Randomization  
 
Participants in Stage 2 will be assigned randomly to one of the two treatment groups ( Active 
eTMS treatment vs Sham eTMS  treatment).  The treatment allocation will be in a 1:[ADDRESS_1031958] treatment visit.  This will occur after giving informed consent at SC; after eligibility is determined from data collected at the BL  Visit; 
after all data necessary to determine eligibility is reviewed and documented on the Eligibility data collection form; and after written confirmation to proceed is provide d by [CONTACT_753917].  Participants will be randomized at the last possible moment (just prior to the first 
treatment) in order to avoid randomizing an eligible potential participant who thereafter changes 
his or her mind about participation before the first study treatment can be delivered, or who is not well enough to be treat ed on that occasion .  
 
The study intends to use a commercial randomization system that supports interactive web 
response that is capable of supporting blinded studies and providing stratification according to the eTMS-PTSD-[ADDRESS_1031959] specific adverse event  
reports. 
 
Prior and Concomitant Medications /Neuromodulation Treatments  
 
All prior and concomitant medications , and neuromodulation treatments  must be listed in the 
participant’s study record and recorded in the study database .  Participants will be questioned at 
F1 and before each treatment visit  in Stage 1 and Stage 2, including the open- label period 
concerning any new  or changed medications  or neuromodulation treatments . 
For each medication taken, a minimum of the following information will be collected:  
• Medication name  
• Indication for which the medication was given  
• Dose, route, and frequency of administration 
• Date started 
• Date stopped 
 Participants should stay on their usual medication regimens at stable doses during t he entire 
course of the trial .  This includes OTC medications.  Questions regarding the use of concomitant 
medications should be addressed to the medically qualified Investigator who will consult with the Study PI [INVESTIGATOR_753851] .  
Prohibited Concomitant Neuromodul ation 
 No neuromodulation treatment other than study treatment is permitted until  all treatments are 
concluded (both randomized and open -label), or the F 1 data collection is completed, whichever 
comes later.  This includes, but is not limited to, stellate ganglion block, tMS, rTMS, 
neurofeedback, e lectroconvulsive therapy ( ECT), cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES), 
Trigeminal Nerve Stimulation ( TNS; including treatment with the Monarch eTNS device ), or 
transcranial electric stimulation (tES) , which includes  (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation -  
tDCS, transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation – t ACS, and transcranial Random Noise 
Stimulation, t RNS).  Only one neuromodulatory treatment is exclusionary in the Stage [ADDRESS_1031960] – ECT.  Only two neuromodulatory treatments are exclusionary in the 
Stage [ADDRESS_1031961]: ECT, and any form of rTMS  (examples include , but 
are not limited to  eTMS or MeRT) .  History of ECT is exclusionary due to its potential for long-
term/permanent effects, and history of any type of rTMS is exclusionary due to the difficulty of 
blinding participants who are not naïve to the experience of rTMS . 
No exclusionary or prohibited concurrent neuromodulation treatment may be introduced until (1) all treatments to be done are concluded  (i.e., all treatments in Stage 1, and all blinded treatments 
plus open-label treatments in Stage 2), and the study main analysis data collection is complete  
(F1), whichever comes last .  If introduction of such a treatment is necessary for emergency 
medical use (e.g., ECT)  the site Investigator will inform the Study Chair and Principal 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.

PCL-5:  The PCL-[ADDRESS_1031973] -5 is a 20-
item self-report measure that assesses the 20  DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD.  The PCL-5 has a variety 
of purposes including m onitoring symptom change during and after treatment, s creening 
individuals for PTSD, and making a provisional PTSD diagnosis .  Each item ranges from 0 to 4 
(0=not at all, 1=a little bit, 2=moderately, 3=quite a bit, 4=extremely) , and a total score ranging 
from 0 to 80.  It takes approximately 5 – 10 minutes to complete.  It can be administered in 3 
formats: without Criterion A (TE exposure), with a brief Criterion A assessment, or with the Life 
Events Checklist for DSM -5 (LEC-5) and extended Criterion A assessment.  When used for 
provisional diagnosis, instead of for severity measurement, the DSM -[ADDRESS_1031974] Neuroscience, Inc.

11 January 2024     PAGE 51  provide the diagnosis (i.e., the CAPS -5), a simple summation of severity scores across the 20 
items may be used to determine probable PTSD.  Initial research indicates that a cut off score of 
between 31 and 33 signals probable PTSD. (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2022)  
(Spoont, et al., 2013)   A provisional PTSD diagnosis can be made by [CONTACT_581020] 
2 = "Moderately" or higher as a symptom endorsed, then following the DSM -[ADDRESS_1031975]: 1 B item (questions 1 -5), 1 C item (questions 6- 7), 2 D items (quest ions 
8-14), 2 E items (questions 15- 20).  In order to avoid enrolling persons who do not have PTSD, 
criteria for the diagnostic rubric must be fulfilled  AND a minimum PCL -[ADDRESS_1031976] study on the PCL -5’s psychometric properties for first 
responders in the [LOCATION_002], studied a sample of [ADDRESS_1031977] responders, including 
firefighters/EMT (76.7%) and police (23.3%).  The mean total PCL -5 score was 38.73 (SD = 
18.68, range 0- 72). (Morrison, Su, Keck, & Beidel, 2021)  
 
Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey (VR-36):  The VR-36 is a self-report questionnaire 
surveying health -related quality of life and consists of 36 items. It was developed specifically for 
Veterans based on the Medical Outcomes Study RAND SF -36. (Measuring Health Preference, 
2023) Items represent eight (8) domains, including: general health, mental health, energy, social 
functioning, physical functioning, bodily pain, disability (role limitations) due to physical problems, and disability (role limitations) due to emotional problems. Each of the subscales is 
scored on a range of 0 -100, with higher scores indicating better function. Two summary scores , 
physical functioning (physical component score, VR -36 PCS) and mental functioning (mental 
component score, VR -36 MCS) are also generat ed. PCS and MC S summary scores are calculated 
using a t-score transformation that is normed to a general U.S. population, such that scores >= 50 
indicate better -than-average functioning, and scores < [ADDRESS_1031978] deviation is 10 and MCID is 7. Norms updated per Selim (2009) for the general population use cutoffs of 51.4 (PCS) and 49.0 (MCS). Veteran norms based on a VA sample are: MCS=35.2 and PCS = 43.6.  
 
MMSE:  The MMSE is a rapid screen for cognitive function that is widely used among 
populations at risk for cognitive dysfunction due to age or neurologic condition. It will be given 
as part of the physical examination to evaluate for neurological disorders that m ay affect capacity 
for treatment consent or increased risk for side effects that would require closer monitoring. 
Administration takes approximately 5 -10 minutes. Total scores range from 0- 30, with higher 
scores indicative of better function.  
 C-SSRS:  The C -SSRS will be used to identify persons deemed to be at too elevated of a risk of 
suicide to be included in the study and whether they need assistance.  The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale is a semi -structured interview to identify suicidal ideation and behavior.  
Assessment of suicidal behavior ranges from preparatory acts to suicide attempt (distinguished 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.

ideation, intensity of suicidal ideation subscale, suicidal behavior subscale, and lethality subscale 
(assesses actual attempts).  (Evidence-based Synthesis Program (ESP) Center, Portland VA 
Medical Center, 2015)   In 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a draft guidance 
([LOCATION_002] Food and Drug Administration, 2012)  indicating that the Columbia Protocol met the 
Agency’s benchmark for measuring suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical trials. (The Columbia 
Protocol: About the Protocol, 2016) . 
OSU-TBI-ID:  The OSU-TBI-ID is a 3 to 5-minute structured interview to elicit a person’s lifetime 
history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Metrics reported from the interview include Worst Injury 
(1-none, 2-mild TBI without loss of consciousness (LOC), 3- mild TBI with LOC, 4 -moderate TBI, 
5-severe TBI). Scores >=3 will be used to document self -reported history of TBI.  
DHQ:  The Drug History Questionnaire (DHQ) is a  standardized, reliable screening interview that 
assesses lifetime and current drug use. Fourteen (14) drug classes are covered: alcohol, cannabis, stimulants/cocaine, stimulants/methamphetamine, stimulants/amphetamines, depressants/benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_1651], depressants/ sedative -hypnotics, narcotics/ heroin, nar cotics/street or 
illicit methadone, narcotics/other opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], hallucinogens, inhalants, steroids, illegal prescription use. Administration time is [ADDRESS_1031979] used, and route (IV)  of administration . 
LEC-5:  The Life Events Checklist is  recommended by [CONTACT_753918] -5. (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2020)   It is 
preceded by [CONTACT_753919] -[ADDRESS_1031980] Self -Report, which identifies lifetime exposure to 17 types of 
traumatic events ( TEs), and how the respondent was involved (e.g., experienced, witnessed, 
learned of).  This is used as a guide to the more in depth LEC -[ADDRESS_1031981] interview, in which the 
TEs are revisited, age at exposure, how exposed, whether it involved a threat to life or  a serious 
injury, and the number of times it occurred .  (Weathers, et al., 2020)  
CGI:  The CGI is a clinician -rated instrument that evaluates symptom severity (CGI -S), whether 
and what direction treatment response takes (CGI -I), and relative efficacy vs. side effects of 
treatment (CGI -E). The CGI-S provides a rating of mental illness severity on a 7- point Likert scale 
(1- normal, 2- borderline, 3- mildly ill, 4- moderately ill, 5 - markedly ill, 6-  severely ill, 7 - 
extremely ill). The CGI -I describes change in mental illness with respect to baseline and due to 
treatment on a 7 -point Likert scale (1- very much improved, 2 - much improved 3 - minimally 
improved, 4- no change, 5- minimally worse, 6 - much worse, 7 - very much worse). The CGI -E 
indicates a combination of therapeutic effect (marked improvement, moderate improvement, minimal improv ement, unchanged or worse) and severity of side effects experienced (none, not 
functionally significant, functionally significant, outweighs therapeutic effect) on a 16- point scale. 
Braincheck:  Braincheck is a computerized, repeatable, neurocognitive test battery composed of 
well-known neuropsychological tests.  It includes immediate and delayed recognition tests, tests of 
visual search speed, scanning, processing speed, mental flexibility, and executive functioning.  Specific tests include trail marking, digit -symbol substitution tests, Stroop color, and word tests.

Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 53  PHQ-SADS:  The PHQ-SADS is a combination of the PHQ -9, PHQ-15, GAD-[ADDRESS_1031983] two weeks (PHQ -9 and GAD-7) or four weeks 
(PHQ-15). Administration takes approximately 10 minutes. Scores are based on thresholds for the 
individual component scales: scores of 5 (mild), 10 (moderate) and 15 (severe or moderately severe). 
AUDIT:  The AUDIT is a 10 -item self-report questionnaire that provides information about habits 
surrounding alcohol use, including alcohol consumption, drinking behavior and alcohol -related 
problems. Each question is scored from 0- 4 points. Administration time is 5 minutes. The total 
score ranges from 0 -40, with higher scores being more concerning for unsafe drinking habits. A 
total score of 8 or more identifies individuals at risk for alcohol use disorder.  
MED: The Morphine -Equivalent Dose is a value that represents the potency of an opi[INVESTIGATOR_753853].  It is intended to be used as a method of tracking changes in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441].  The assessment is intended for determining daily dosage, and include s 10 different opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (Codeine, 
Fentanyl, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone, Methadone, Morphine, Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Tapentado, and Tramadol).  Measurements are made in milligrams.  A conversion factor is used (Von Korff, et al., 2011) , and amounts are summed, resulting in a final amount (in milligrams) of 
morphine the subject ingested.  Levels of >120 MED per day increases risks for overdose by 1.98 
(Ciesielski, et al., 2016) . 
OCS:  The Opi[INVESTIGATOR_753854] a 5 -item self reported assessment that estimates the cravings an 
individual has for opi[INVESTIGATOR_162228].  This scale was adapted for opi[INVESTIGATOR_753855] (PACS) (Flannery, 1999) .  Each item measures the severity of cravings on a [ADDRESS_1031984]-10:  The DAST-10 is a 10-item, self-report instrument to identify problem drug use. One 
point is scored for each item on the screen, with total score range from 0 -10. Administration time is 
about 10 minutes.  
PSQI:  The Pi[INVESTIGATOR_753856] a self-administered questionnaire developed to 
discriminate between “good sleepers” and “poor  sleepers.”  The PSQI is the most commonly used 
screening tool for sleep dysfunction.  The instrument assesses sleep quality disturbances over a 1 -
month time interval.  Nineteen individual items generate seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of slee pi[INVESTIGATOR_398334], and daytim e dysfunction.  Scores are summed for a global PSQI score. (Buysse, 
Reynolds III, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989)  (University of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_9109], 2020)   Best evidence 
synthesis shows strong reliability and validity, and moderate structural validity in a variety of sample populations, suggesting that it fulfills its intended utility. (Mollayeva, et al., 2016) . 
SEQ:  The SEQ is a checklist to evaluate for side effects of eTMS therapy. Expected adverse 
reactions will be prompted for.  For each item, individuals are asked to indicate whether they are 
experiencing the symptom. Response options are: None, Slightly, Moderate, Severe.  
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.

SAFETY  
Adverse Events  
 
An adverse event (AE) log will be kept.  There will be data collection of AEs at all follow -up 
visits (F1, F2, F3 ) as well as recording of AEs  reported to the treating personnel , or other 
medical personnel at the treatment site,  at each treatment visit and AEs that are otherwise 
spontaneously reported.  The Side Effects Questionnaire (SEQ) will be used to ensure full 
reporting of adverse effects of the study treatment and procedures.  When an AE is noted by [CONTACT_224192]/Technician it will be escalated to the S ite Investigator , or their medically 
qualified designee  as appropriate, and in all cases for an SAE .  All AEs and SAEs will be 
reported to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board.  As noted above in the section on Unbli nding, 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_11247] a log of unblinded adverse event data that may be used to call a for-cause DSMB 
meeting to conduct a safety review.  AEs will be reported to the FDA and the IRB on the schedules determined by [CONTACT_753920], according to instructions for reporting differing types, severity, and relatedness, of AEs.  
 An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant treated 
with an investigational product and does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment under investigation.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product , whether or 
not considered related to the investigational product.  Anticipated adverse device effects for purposes of  both Stage [ADDRESS_1031985] likely to occur, include:

An unanticipated adverse device event (UADE) is defined , in 21 CFR 812.3(s) as any serious 
(“serious” as defined above and in 21 CFR 312.32(a) ) adverse effect on health or safety , or any 
life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, 
or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the protocol and/or Instructions  For Use (IFU) , or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a 
device that relates to the rig hts, safety, or welfare of the participant . 
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for SAEs or UADEs should be regarded as non-serious adverse events.  
 Progression of disease reflects lack of therapeutic efficacy and should not be treated as serious adverse events.  However, other events or complications meeting the criteria for serious adverse 
events should be considered as a serious adverse event and should be reported to the IRB 
regardless of presumed relationship to the investigational treatment.  
 
Adverse Event Assessment  
 
All adverse events  (AE), including the following, will be assessed by [CONTACT_753924] , and recorded on the study Adverse Event form  according to the 
protocol and the Manual of Procedures :  
 
• Observed or volunteered problems  
• Complaints 
• Physical signs and symptoms  
• Medical condition which occurs during the study, having been absent at screening  
• Medical condition present at screening  which appears to worsen during the study 
 
The need to capture AEs is not dependent upon whether or not the clinical event is associated with the use of the study treatment.  
 Severity will be assessed using the following definitions:  
 
• Mild: Aware of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
• Moderate: Discomfort sufficient  to cause interference with usual activity  
• Severe: Incapacitating , with inability to work or do usual activity 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 58  The relationship to I nvestigational T reatment will be assessed by [CONTACT_366634] : 
 
• Not 
Related Evidence exists that the adverse event definitely has a cause other than 
the study treatment ( e.g., pre-existing condition or underlying disease, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication) and does not meet any 
other criteria listed.   
 
• Suspected There is a reasonable possibility that the treatment caused the adverse 
event.  “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the treatment and the adverse event.  This is a lesser degree of certainty about causality than the conclusion that the adverse event was caused by [CONTACT_8235].  (21 CFR 312.32(a)   A 
causal relationship requires a temporal relationship to exist between 
the adverse event onset and administration of study treatment.   
• Definitely 
Related Strong evidence exists that the study treatment caused the adverse 
event.  There is a temporal relationship between the event onset and administration of the study treatment.  There is strong therapeutic evidence that the event was caused by [CONTACT_104841].  The participant’s clinical state and concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_229694] a cause.  
 
 
All participants who have been exposed to study treatment will be evaluated for adverse events.  All adverse events will be evaluated beginning with onset, and evaluation will continue until resolution or recovery is observed or until the Investigator dete rmines that the participant’s 
condition is stable, whichever is earlier.  The Investigator will take all appropriate and necessary therapeutic measures required for resolution of the adverse event.  Any medication necessary for the treatment of an adverse event must be recorded on the study Concomitant Medication form. If more than one distinct adverse event occurs, each event will be recorded separately.  
 
Adverse Event Reporting  
 
The study period during which adverse events must be reported is defined as the period from the initiation of any study procedures to the end of the follow -up data collection .  The study 
procedures initiation is defined as beginning at the BL  Visit.  Every treatment visit is 
accompanied by [CONTACT_753925]-up data collection visits .  This data collection will use a side -effects questionnaire in 
order to methodically detect expected side effects.  
 
Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
 
All Serious Adverse Events (SAE) , Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE), and Serious 
Unanticipated Problems  (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845]) that occur during the study, including death, must be 
reported within one working day by [CONTACT_753926], and followed up in writing 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 59  within 24 hours.  The urgency for reporting SAE and UADE is four -fold:  (1) to facilitate 
discussion and implementation, if necessary, by [CONTACT_753927]-up measures; (2) to facilitate reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to human 
participants to the IRB; (3) to facilitate Sponsor ’s rapid dissemination of information regarding 
AEs to other Investigators/sites in a  multi-center study; and (4) to enable Sponsor  to fulfill 
reporting requirements to the appropriate regulatory authority.  Sponsor  and the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_753857].  
 
Within the following [ADDRESS_1031988] receive a report of any UADE (which 
includes serious UP, i.e., UPI[INVESTIGATOR_14845] ) no later than [ADDRESS_1031989].  (21 CFR 812.150(a)(1).  Sponsor  is required to immediately conduct an 
investigation of all UADE  and serious UP of which it is notified, under 21 C FR 812.46(b).  If 
Sponsor determines a UADE or serious UP presents an unreasonable risk to participants, it must 
terminate any part of the investigation presenting that risk within [ADDRESS_1031990], under 21 CFR 812.150(7)(b)(1), report the results of that evaluation to the IRB and FDA, and all participating investigators within [ADDRESS_1031991].  All reporting operating procedures of the IRB will be followed . 
 
Technical and Protocol R isk Mitigation  
 Risk of seizure is not zero  but is mitigated by [CONTACT_193058].  Trial eligibility criteria are 
intended to minimize seizure risk, i.e., abnormal focal or general slowing, or ictal spi[INVESTIGATOR_2988], during the EEG recording will exclude a candidate from participation.  All stimulation during this study will be sub-threshold.  This will be guaranteed at BL by [CONTACT_753928], 
finding the minimum stimulation energy to cause a thumb twitch, reducing the energy by 20% from that point, and then re testing to ensure no thumb twitch exists.  Motor threshold is known to 
be stable over the time period used in the clinical trial.  Sub -threshold stimulation ensures that 
eTMS therapy does not actively stimulate neurons, which minimizes any chance of seizure or 
other adverse event.  Note that convent ional cleared rTMS therapy uses stimulation at 120% of 
motor threshold.  As per the 2020 safety rTMS safety guidelines (Rossi, et al., 2020) , participants 
will be monitored for signs of cortical excitation by [CONTACT_753929], and participants will be instructed to report any sensations of twitching.  Finally, operators will have SOPs containing instructions as to what to do in the event of a seizure and will be trained for this eventuality. 
 
Generally, risks from equipment misuse, contamination, accidental damage , or failure are 
controlled by a number of strategies.  These include (1) expert installation and periodic inspection of all devices , (2) training, certification, and periodic re -certification of personnel who 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 60  use and maintain the equipment , (3) written standard operating procedu res (SOPs), and (4) 
documentation of compliance  with SOPs.  Specific risk mitigations are detailed below.  
 
Risks from personnel error are mitigated.  Only trained , certified and periodically re -certified, 
personnel may use the stimulator and other equipment.  Each stimulator operator is assigned a 
unique personal identifier and password, and an audit trail will track time of use and identity of 
user.  Operators will be intensively trained to determine motor threshold.  Stimulation frequency 
is controlled over the internet from the IDE Sponsor’s facility.  The operator has no discretion to 
view, or change, the frequency . 
 Risks of contamination transferred from one participant to another  are mitigated with 
cleansing SOPs.  All participant- contact[CONTACT_753930], 
and other surfaces that do not come into contact [CONTACT_753931] -[ADDRESS_1031992] 1/16th of an inch in thickness, which provides a sufficient barrier that the voltage of the coil could not be detected on the outside of the coil housing.  The PVC plastic housing is approximately [ADDRESS_1031993] of patient involvement in equipment damage.  
 Risks of overheating are mitigated.   The MagVita device incorporates a thermal sensor in the 
coil that prohibits operation if the coil exceeds a predefined temperature of 41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit).  The MagV ita device includes a software status panel where the 
temperature of the coil is continuously displayed.  If the coil temperature exceeds [ADDRESS_1031994] the attention of the operator.  Sponsor  has 
never had an adverse event in which a patient has been burned due to overheating of any part of 
the system.  Sponsor  has had events where the system alerted the operator that the coil had 
exceeded its cutoff temperature, and the system would not allow any further stimulation.  The SOPs for the trial will include careful monitoring of the status panel.  The participant also will be 
instructed to report any change in temperature to the operator.   
 
Risk of hearing damage  is mitigated.  The MagVita device underwent human factors testing for 
the device generated noise.  The eTMS  treatment has a similar protocol to the MagV ita protocol.  
The section entitled “Comparison of eTMS  Study Active Treatment Exposure with FDA -Cleared 
rTMS Treatments,” above, shows a table of comparisons of eTMS  to cleared rTMS devices.  The 
MagVita delivers 4 second trains every 30 seconds at a 10 Hz frequency, resulting in 3,000 
pulses per treatment session.  The eTMS  protocol calls for 5 second trains  of stimulation every 
20 seconds, at a frequency between 8 and 13 Hz, resulting in between 1,44 0 and 2,340 pulses per 
treatment session.  The sound of the MagV ita device used under the eTMS  protocol is lower than 
that for the cleared use of the MagV ita device.  The reason for this is that eTMS  uses lower 
energy.  eTMS  is at 50% of motor threshold, whereas the MagV ita cleared protocol stimulates at 
120% of motor threshold.  The MagV ita coil produces 77 dB 5 centimeters from the source, 
when used at 50% of maximum energy that the MagV ita can produce.  Even if the participant’s 
motor threshold were at the maximum that the device could produce, then [ADDRESS_1031995] intense sound to which the participant would be subjected:  a participant cannot be treated if his or her motor threshold cannot be determined, thus if the MT is at the maximum output of 
the device, and eTMS  is conducted at 50% MT, then this establishes an upper limit of [ADDRESS_1031996] for protection from acoustic trauma.  
(Dhamne, et al., 2014) .  Nevertheless, the sound can be annoying to some patients.  D isposable 
earplugs will be provided to any participant who desires to use them.  Operators also will offer earplugs at the beginning of each session.  The 2020 safety guidelines cover the aural health of operators who are within less than 40 centimeters of the discharging coil, mandating that in these conditions either earplugs or earmuffs are used. (Rossi, et al., 2020)   This mandate will be 
obeyed in the eTMS -PTSD-001trial. 
 Non-therapeutic effects of the stimulation equipment are mitigated with a combination of 
exclusion criteria, treatment room setup, and removing sensitive objects from proximity with the stimulator.  The MagVita equipment magnetic field is the therapeutic element in eTMS  treatment 
and is therefore required to be present.  Its effects on other equipment, and especially participant 
implants must be mitigated or nullified.  Treatment rooms will be set up to prevent the proximity of the MagVita device to sensitive equipment.  Additionally, eligibility criteria for th e trial 
exclude participants with implants that are sensitive to the strong magnetic field.  These include: intracranial implants (e.g., aneurysm clips, shunts, stimulators, cochlear implants, stents, or 
electrodes) or any other metal object within or near the head, excluding the mouth, which cannot be safely removed, as well as implanted cardiac pacemakers, impl antable cardioverter 
defibrillators (ICD), cervical or thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_55441], ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, 
metal stents or shunts,  medication dispensing devices , or any other active or non- active metal 
implants.  There is a risk of permanent damage to any implanted battery -operated generator or 
lead/paddle.  That damage could require revision surgery.  Trial SOPs will include instructions regarding placement of wearable or removable devices or objects as well (for example, cell

informed consent process will stress the importance of giving a full and accurate history 
regarding the presence vulnerable or metal objects.  
 
Emergency Action Plans  
 
All sites will have specific emergency action plans  to respond to seizure, cardiovascular events, 
elevation of risk of suicide or violent behavior, or a general injury.  Plans and descriptions of resources will be included in the Manual of Procedures, which will include procedures for response and location of responding resources .  Appropriate plans  will be put into place for  sites, 
as initiated to the study, depending on their intrinsic resources .  All coordinators and technicians 
will be trained: 
• to respond to seizure  
• to react appropriately and anticipate violent behavior  
• to recognize suicidal ideation 
• to respond to general injury 
 In the event of a seizure, the response will be to (1) keep the airway clear, (2) provide room to safely move the participant, and (3) if not a medical treatment facility site , to call an ambulance .  
 No coordinator or technician will continue to be in a room alone with a participant who indicates an increased level of risk of violence, or who is identified by [CONTACT_753932].  Assistance will be identified that is within appropriate ly effective distance. 
 
When a participant is considered at elevated risk of suicide or expresses inappropriate homicidal 
intent, the site Investigator  or his/her medically qualified designee  will be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  If the 
Investigator/designee deems the individual to be at imminent risk, an emergency medical service 
will be called to transport that individual to a prespecified medical facility, or the police will be called. 
 When a seizure occurs, the sponsor will report the occurrence details to the IRB and to FDA within 10 days from the seizure, to determine whether procedures need to be update d to optimize 
safety. 
 The following lists the relevant information for the Wright State clinical site with regards to emergency handling:  
 
• The location where eTMS treatment is administered will be: Neuroscience Engineering  Collaboration Building, Wright State University, [ADDRESS_1031997], Dayton, OH [ZIP_CODE]. 
• There are no emergency services at the site.   The emergency response would be to call the Soin Medical Center – Kettering Health, located 1.5 miles from the facility.  
• An emergency defibrillator is located on site.  
• All individuals administering eTMS will be trained and certified by [CONTACT_1034].

STATISTICAL METHODS  
STUDY OUTCOMES  
Stage 1 
Stage 1 of the eTMS -PTSD trial is intended to investigate the safety of the procedure in the 
target population.  The primary outcome is safety.  Adverse events will be recorded, and categorized based on incidence, relatedness, severity, type , subsequent treatment/intervention 
required, and resolution status . 
 
Stage 2 
Stage 2 of the trial is intended to investigate efficacy and safety of the procedure in the target population.  The primary efficacy outcome is a measure of PTSD symptom severity .  PTSD 
symptom reduction will be calculated as the arithmetic reduction in PCL -5 scores between BL 
and F1.  See the above Data Collection section for a description of this assessment.  
 Safety will be characterized by [CONTACT_753933], relatedness, severity, type, subsequent treatment/intervention required, and resolution status .

DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  
 
A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprised of at least [ADDRESS_1032000] a planned interim  group-sequential analysis with possible early 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_753859] (lack of benefit).  The interim analysis will be done when F1 data are available for approximately 50% of the anticipated completing 
participants.  The boundary for possible early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_753860] a two- sided p-value 
for the primary analysis ≤0.001; if the trial does not stop, the final analysis will be done usi ng a 
criterion for statistical significance of a  two-sided p-value ≤ 0.049.  Possible early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_753861] (CP)  - the probability of finding a significant 
beneficial treatment effect (two -sided p ≤0.049) at the end of the study, given the current data 
and appropriate assumptions about the true treatment effect and SD
difference.  The DSMB may 
recommend stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_753862], for example 20% or lower, assuming a  
treatment difference of  15 for change in  the PCL-5 score.  Before stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_753863], the DSMB will  consider results for other endpoint s. 
 
 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN FOR STAGE 1  
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be summarized using MedDRA terms.  AEs will be listed and 
summarized by [CONTACT_9313], preferred term, incidence, severity and duration.  Monthly 
safety summaries will be made for all study participants and listed by [CONTACT_753935] e Study Chair  and Principal Investigator, who also will receive 
SAE reports in real -time.  These listings will be produced for every DSMB meeting.  The 
DSMB, the Study Chair and Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_1318] n ot be blinded to treatment assignment 
for any AE-related data. 
 
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  FOR STAGE 2  
Statistical Analysis Software  
 
Statistical analyses will be performed using software such as the SAS® system, IBM SPSS, or EXCEL. 
Analysis Populations 
 Two analysis populations are defined for Stage 2 : 
• The Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis population includes all eligible and randomized 
participants 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 66  • The Per-Protocol (PP) analysis population includes all participants in the ITT 
population who (1) had all efficacy evaluations at the major study time points defining 
the primary outcome comparison, i.e., BL  and F1, (2) who had no major protocol 
deviations, and (3) who received at least 75% of assigned blinded study treatments  
Analysis of Safety  
 Adverse events (AEs) in Stage [ADDRESS_1032001] 
with a two-sided p- value ≤ 0.05, the secondary efficacy outcome anal ysis will be conducted at 
a two-sided alpha = 0.05 level .  If alpha has been spent in DSMB efficacy monitoring, the 
alpha level apportioned to the primary results analyses will be accordingly reduced.  
 
Primary outcome efficacy analysis  
 The primary efficacy outcome analysis will be conducted on the ITT population.  The primary efficacy outcome measure is arithmetic change in PCL -5 score between BL  and F1.  The 
primary efficacy hypothesis is the superiority of eTMS  treatment over sham eTMS  treatment in 
participants with PTSD.  Missing values will be imputed.  The analysis of the primary outcome will be a linear regression of the change in PCL -5 total score between BL  and F1, with 
independent variables being the BL PCL -5 total score and a du mmy variable for the two 
treatment groups.  
 Missing F1 PCL-5 total scores will be addressed using multiple imputation.  Missing PCL -5 
total scores will be estimated (i.e., imputed) from a linear regression model to be determined from observations in which the F 1 PCL-5 score is not missing; covariates considered for 
inclusion in the model will be the BL PCL -5 total score, a dummy variable for treatment group, 
and other potentially associated variables (e.g., age, gender, PTSD severity, military status, and number of treatments.  The linear regression model will be chosen using the LASSO method with cross-validation, implemented in SAS PROC GLMSELECT.  The set of variables to be 
considered for inclusion will be determined before the imputation is performed.  After the form of the linear regression model  is determined, at least 20 data sets will be created with the 
missing F1 PCL-5 values imputed, using the linear regression function and SAS PROC MI to 
introduce a random element.  The described primary linear regression analysis (linear regression of change in PCL -5 score on BL  score and a dummy variable for treatment group) 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 67  will be performed for each of the imputation datasets.  SAS PROC MIANALYZE will then be 
used to combine the regression results from the previous step and form the final MI analysis results.  Since there will be multiple imputed values for each missing F 1 PCL-5 score, the 
analysis will account for variability in the missing values.  This process assumes that missing values are missing at random (MAR), i.e., they may depend on values of other variables 
measured at the same time, but not on the non- missing values.  The following sensitivity 
analyses will be conducted for missing PCL -5 total scores at F 1:  1) analysis of non- missing F1 
PCL-5 total scores; 2) analysis in which missing F [ADDRESS_1032002] PCL-5 total score possible; and 3) analysis in which missing F [ADDRESS_1032003] in designing future trials regarding sample size justification and power analysis, shoul d a trial in future be designed with a responder analysis as the primary 
outcome or a seconda ry outcome. 
 
Other participant reported outcomes analyses  
 
Other participant reported outcomes , including assessment of blinding, will be analyzed 
according to their level of data (e.g., quantitative, rank order, or categorical) and validity of statistical assumptions required  (e.g., homoscedasticity and normality).

35 Hz).  Power density of each frequency band of each channel will be used to measure the EEG changes after treatment.  Statistical analysis will include data reduction by [CONTACT_753936].  Difference between treatment groups at each recording time will be tested by [CONTACT_753937].  It is anticipated that successful treatment will result in reductions in low frequency  rhythms and increases in peak 
alpha frequency and correspondent narrow -band density.  These changes in EEG variables will 
be further correlated with clinical and cognitive data to explore the hypothesis that EEG parameters could be a biomarker for PTSD . 
 
 
STUDY SITE MONITORING  
 Monitoring of the study sites will be conducted by a qualified and experienced Clinical Research Associate (CRA), with representation from the IDE Sponsor, the Study Principal Investigator 
[INVESTIGATOR_753864].  All monitoring will be conducted according to ICH/GCP 
guidelines.  Monitoring visits will be conducted regularly, approximately every month at each site, to ensure that all aspects of the protocol are followed.  All consent forms will be accounted 
for and all new consent forms accumulated s ince the previous site visit will be reviewed for 
regulatory compliance.  A mix of electronic and paper s tudy data collection forms (CRF) are the 
source documents.  Paper forms will be used for any standard assessment that is not permitted to be collected electronically and will be used as a backup data collection method when there is an interruption in access to the electronic database.  Paper d ata collection forms will be checked for 
consistency with the database and for compliance with study procedures f or data collection form 
corrections.    Study materials, such as the Protocol, the Manual of Procedures (MoP ), the study forms, IRB 
stamped consent forms, study logs, and study personnel certification records, will be reviewed to assure that all materials are current.  The Principal Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_753865] D ata Center.

CONFIDENTIALITY  
Study participants will be assigned two unique identifiers (a unique Participant ID and a 
redundant identifier in the form of a non- identifying character Participant Alpha Code) that will 
be used to anonymize the participants in the electronic data capture system throughout the study.  Personal identifiers will never be entered into the central electronic data capture system.  
 Information about study participants will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1984 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed participant authorization informing the  participant of the 
following: 
  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from participants in this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why  
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research participant to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
 
A Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the National Institutes of Health.  
 In the event that a participant revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the Investigator, by [CONTACT_5151], retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of participant authorization.  For participants who  have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts 
should be made to obtain permission to collect at least vital status (i.e. that the participant is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 Participants will not have video or pi[INVESTIGATOR_753866].  Their image, likeness, name [CONTACT_753953]. 
 A clinical site master list with participant names, contact [CONTACT_3031], and study identifiers will be stored locally at each of the sites for that site only.  Any paper or electronic files associated with these lists and information will be stored in a lo cked room in locked cabinets at the site with 
access only by [CONTACT_753938].  Any change in the ownership and location of these documents or files will be documented to allow the tracking of the  stored records.   
 Data will be protected during transmission  through SSL and two- factor authentication.  A ccess to 
the study database will be restricted.

11 January 2024     PAGE 71  Data Capture  
 
The source data for this study are paper and electronic documents (standardized assessments and CRFs), as well as electronic data recordings of EEG/ECG.  The paper study forms (CRF) are the primary data collection templates  for the study.  The forms will be implemented in the electronic 
data capture system (EDC).  Participants and site staff will key source data into the EDC, 
depending on whether the data are collected via interview or self -administration.  Authorized, 
uniquely credentialed study personnel will be given secure access to the system to review data as 
necessary for proper decision -making and signoffs.   
 
Database and Environments  
 
Data collection software are a combination of .net 7 using C#, and Microsoft SQL databases, with a front end leveraging angular framework.  Testing, quality assurance, and production 
environments will run within the Microsoft Azure network, inclusive of Web services, APIs, and data storage.  All data in storage is backed up twice daily and secured offsite.  
 
Data Integrity  
 
Error checking will be implemented in the EDC, including real -time range checking at entry, 
specification of required fields, skip pattern specification, and within- form internal consistency 
checks.  Data will be checked for omissions in as real -time as possible, with explanation for 
missing data.  Periodic cross -form consistency checks, and batch error -checking will be followed 
by [CONTACT_753942].  Errors will be corrected in a manner that leaves a complete audit trail.  
The audit trail for any change  will include information showing the original value, the new 
value, the date and time the change was made, who made the change, and a brief reason why the change was made.  
 When participants enter data, clinic personnel will check the entries for errors and omissions.  Periodic checks and inspections will be conducted for data completeness and logical inconsistencies.  Any discrepancies or needed clarifications will be resolv ed via Data Quality 
Query (DQQ), wherein study data collection personnel will be asked to resolve issues.  Site monitoring, also, will include resolution of any issues not resolved by [CONTACT_753943].   
 At the conclusion of each stage of the trial, a final round of quality checking will occur, and all issues that can be resolved, will be resolved.  After the last participant visit is entered, data will be reviewed by a Study Monitor /Biostatistician , and a final batch EDC system edit run will be 
done to ensure all queries and discrepancies have been addressed.  Issues that cannot be resolved will be described in a memo to file and attached to any analyses.   The DC will notify the Study 
Chair, Principal Inve stigator and IDE Sponsor that it considers the database ready for lock.  An 
approval signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_64362], Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_753867].  The DC will perform final database lock procedures per SOP .  
Thereafter, the database will be locked for that stage.  All final statistical analyses will be conducted on datasets extracted from the locked database.

Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.[ADDRESS_1032006] Keepi[INVESTIGATOR_007], Handling, and Retention at the Sites  
 
The investigators and authorized, trained site staff will maintain electronic or paper study documentation to ensure adherence to the protocol, regulations, Manual of Procedures (MoP), and any other study policies.  Current study documentation may be maint ained by [CONTACT_753944].  
 The site investigators and study data collection staff will be responsible for completeness and 
accuracy of documented data and records to support study protocol adherence, review and audit.  Enforcement will be carried out by [CONTACT_753945] r outine remote monitoring to 
verify that all processes are followed and required documentation is created and collected.  
 
It is each clinical site Investigator’s responsibility, by [CONTACT_21002] (21 CFR §812.140(d)), to 
retain essential study documents for at least 2 years after the study is completed.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_753868], in writing, of the date of completion of the study.  If a 
site Investigator is not able to retain the records for the period of time required by [CONTACT_5151], or as otherwise instructed , then the Investigator will transfer the records to the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_753869] 21 CFR §812.140(e), under the regulations of 21 CFR Part 812.  Notice of the transfer will be given to FDA not later than 10 working days after the transfer occurs – as per FDA regulation.  
 
Data Transmission from Sites to Data Center  
 
The Data Center (DC) will set up a secure file transfer system for data transmission for the study, 
provide the study personnel with access to upload data and files and will provide other study 
personnel with access to download data and files.  Processes  will be quality assured with test 
data prior to the first data transfer.  
 
Wave Neuroscience, Inc.                                                                                                                                                
Protocol eTMS-PTSD Rev 1.1 
11 January 2024     PAGE 73  The DC will provide for  encrypted and secure communications between the DC, research s ites, 
and other study components.  E ncryption minimizes the likelihood of interception or 
modification of data during transmission.  The DC’s network infrastructure (internal and external 
systems) will be  protected from the public Internet by [CONTACT_304642], but not 
limited to, firewalls (with restrictive policies in place), virtual private network (VPN) endpoints 
and software as well as antivirus and malware detection software.  The  protection system  output 
will be collected and reviewed.  For further protection against disaster or loss of data, all data 
will be backed up daily.  
 Data transmission starts with the electronic entry into the data system.  Study personnel, and participants, will enter data into the electronic data capture system (described below).   
 Anonymized participant data will be received by [CONTACT_261031].  All original transmissions will be stored electronically in a secure commercial server (i.e., the “DC server”) .  Any problems 
identified during the upload and transmission process will be reported back to the sites for correction or clarification.  The process for addressing data discrepancies with sites will be determined in coordination with other study components during study set -up.  The data 
transmitted to and stored on the DC server will be code d with the assigned participant 
identification number and alpha code; no personal identifiers will be associated with these data.  
 
Data and Record Retention by [CONTACT_753946], will be retained for as long as they are required to meet the contractual, legal, regulatory, administrative, financial and operational requirements of 
the DC, after which time they are transferred to the IDE Sponsor.   
 
Data and Record Trans fer 
 
Raw EEG/ECG files will be transmitted automatically and securely via internet only to the IDE Sponsor for immediate processing to determine treatment parameters (i.e., frequency).   The files 
will be identified only by [CONTACT_753947]. 
The media used to transfer electronic files and study data will be discussed and documented in a 
study close-out plan that will be prepared as the study progresses.  The necessary security 
measures will be taken for file/data security and integrity during preparing and transmitting these files. 
The DC will provide a de -identified data set that integrates the final study data in the EDC 
system.  The de -identified data set will be received by [CONTACT_753948], the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_753870], and the State of Ohio according to the funding RFP.  Each data set will conform to the  specifications  of the receiver .  Data transfer transmission will be 
encrypted and password protected.

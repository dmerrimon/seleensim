Title:   
A Brief Intervention to Improve Stroke Preparedness  
Grant Number:  U01MD010579  
Study Description:  This is a randomized controlled behavioral intervention trial to 
assess the efficacy of a brief intervention to increase stroke 
preparedness.  
Objectives:  To test the efficacy of a brief intervention to increase stroke 
preparedness (recognition of stroke a nd the importance of calling 
911).  
Endpoints:  Primary Endpoint:  
 Behavioral intent to call 911 using a self -administered 
survey  
 
Exploratory Endpoints:  
 Stroke symptom  recognition  
 Stroke self -efficacy, attitude, social  norms  
Study Population:  Adults in the Flint Community  
Description of Study 
Intervention/Experimental 
Manipulation:  Randomized control study to assess the efficacy of a stroke 
preparedness intervention. Subjects will be randomized to a brief 
face-to-face stroke preparedness inter vention compared to a 
healthy lifestyle stroke risk reduction intervention.  
Study Duration:  About 30 minutes  
Participant Duration:  Single -session

Specific Aim 1: To assess whether a scientific theory -driven, face -to-face brief behavioral 
intervention increases behavioral intent to call 911 among adults in Flint, MI.  
 
Specific Aim 2: To assess whether a sci entific theory -driven, face -to-face brief behavioral 
intervention increases stroke recognition and stroke self -efficacy among adults in Flint, MI.  
 
 
  2.[ADDRESS_390432] disability. Acute stroke treatments, which include 
intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and intra -arterial treatme nt, substantially reduce 
post-stroke disability but are administered to less than 5% of stroke patients. These treatments 
are particularly underutilized in Flint, Michigan, where the rate of acute stroke treatment is half 
the national rate. In fact, Flint has the lowest treatment rate of any region of its size in the entire 
US, which only exacerbates the existing health disparities in this predominantly African - 
American community. The low treatment rates of the Flint community are illustrative of racial 
disparities in stroke — African Americans have a higher incidence of stroke, receive acute 
stroke treatments less often and experience greater post -stroke disability than non -Hispanic 
whites. These inequities can be at least partially addressed with interven tions to increase acute 
stroke treatment rates; but practical, cost efficient and sustainable interventions are lacking.  
 
  2.3 RISK/BENEFIT  ASSESSMENT   
 
 
The Stroke Ready workshop is community -based education with no more than minimal risk.  
 
 
Physical risks: We do not anticipate our intervention will induce physical risks as it is all based 
on educational materials.  
 
Psychological risks: We do not anticipat e our intervention will induce psychological risks as we 
provide positive messages.  
 
Financial risks: We do not anticipate any financial burden all Stroke Ready education and 
activities are free to the public.  
 
Legal risk: We do not anticipate that our research protocol will include any additional legal risks . 
 
 
The goal of this project is to provide stroke preparedness education to increase acute stroke 
treatment rates. Participants will uniformly gain access to stroke knowledge and education. It is 
hoped that by [CONTACT_317321], stroke tr eatments and the importance 
of calling 911, subjects will be more likely to recognize a stroke and call [ADDRESS_390433] been trained in research ethics, confidentiality 
protection, and HIPAA prior to and throughout the study period through the Program for the 
Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research and Scholarship (PEERRS) trai ning 
program at the University of Michigan Medical School. Any additional research personnel must 
also pass PEERRS certifications.

This is a randomized controlled trial of a stroke preparedness intervention to increase 
behavioral intent to call 911 (Figure 1). The control group will receive a healthy lifestyle stroke 
risk reduction intervention. The intervention was designed as part o f HUM00126955.  4 STUDY  DESIGN  2.3.3  ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL RISKS AND  BENEFITS

Brief Intervention  
 
Peer leaders will deliver the brief stroke preparedness intervention. 
These core components include, and are defined as follows:  
1. What is Stroke: defines what a stroke is and what causes  it. 
2. Stroke Happens : facts about incidence and prevalence of stroke, as well as  defining 
the consequences of  stroke.  
3. Stroke Signs (FAST): Review of signs of stroke —face droopi[INVESTIGATOR_007], arm weakness, speech 
difficulties, a nd time to call 911, as well as how to check for each  sign.  
4. Stroke is treatable. TPA —the clot bluster: visual demonstration and/or illustration 
showing what happens during a stroke and how TPA works to remove a blockage in the 
brain.  
5. Time is everything : explanation that medicine to treat stroke can only be given in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], and that earlier treatment is given, the better the chance of  recovery.  
6. Stroke Ready Action Plan : a step -by-step plan to guide a person through calling 911  if 
they see signs of stro ke, and a reminder of the steps to follow when doing  so. 
 
The healthy behavior intervention consists of patient materials from the American Heart 
Association.  
 
The intervention will be conducted by [CONTACT_317322], similar to our previous procedures (HUM00084543, 
HUM00145724). The interaction (pre -test—intervention —post-test) will take abou t 30 minutes. 
We will provide the subjects $[ADDRESS_390435] (HUM00093846, HUM00145724).  
The subjects will be invited to participate when asked by a team member or member of th e clinic 
medical staff. Subjects from the senior center will be recruited during center events. Recruitment 
announcements, flyers, internet platforms, and word -of-mouth may also be used.  
 
There is no retention. Subject identifiers are not collected and sub jects are not contact[CONTACT_317323].  
 
Subject agreement will be sought at the start of the interaction by [CONTACT_92278].  Any subject  who declines  will be thanked  for their participation  and the interaction  will 
cease. A copy of the agreement form will be provided to  subjects.  
 
  6 STUDY INTERVENTION(S) OR EXPERIMENTAL  MANIPULATION(S)   
 
  6.1 ENDPOINT   
 
The primary outcome will be change in behavioral intent to call 911. It will be measured using a 
16 item assessment, of which 4 are non -stroke distractors, based on a previous assessment 
used in the Flint community as well as a larger sample in Michigan (H UM00036399 and 
HUM0006687).11, 12 
 
Secondary outcomes: The tertiary/exploratory outcomes include change in stroke recognition 
based on the BRFSS,13 stroke self -efficacy, outcome expectations and social norms based on 
questions used in a previous interventi on in this community.14 
 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
  6.2 STATISTICAL  HYPOTHESES   
 
 
 
 
The primary analysis will fit a linear regression model with the outcome of change in behavioral 
intent to call 911 (post minus pre) and main effect -coded binary predictor intervention group.  
Results will be reported as parameter estimates, 95% confidence intervals, or as the average  5 STUDY  POPULATION

marginal effects and 2 -sided p -values. We anticipate the tertiary/exploratory variables will be 
analyzed using the same strategy, although logistic re gression models may be used depending 
on the properties of the collected data.  
 
Previous studies note a 6 point improvement (sd=6) in behavioral intent to call 911 based on (21 
stroke vignettes) after a [ADDRESS_390436] properties of their measure. Given our measurement 
instrument is fewer questions and has higher baseline estimates than the previously used 
estimate,11 STAT, that the sample size calculations are based o ff of,15 we anticipate less 
improvement. We estimate a 3 point improvement in the intervention group and a 2 point 
improvement in the control group (test -re-test). Thus with sd (2), power 80, alpha 0.05, we plan 
to enroll [ADDRESS_390437] VJ. Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics —2015 Update A Report From the

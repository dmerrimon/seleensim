This protocol was designed and developed by [CONTACT_161615], University 
of Calif ornia -  Berkeley University, and Aurora Health Care.  It is intended to be 
used o nly in conj unction with institution -specific IRB approval for study entry.  
The Aurora IRB requires that this protocol be conducted according to U.S. and 
international standar ds of Good Clinical Practice (International Conference on 
Harmonization (ICH) Gui delines), C ommon Rule, WI and the Aurora IRB policies and 
procedures. All Human Participant  Research and all Clinical Investigations conducted at 
Advocate Aurora Health or by [CONTACT_850232] 
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182057] tested whether providing incentives to encourage abstinence from 
drugs c an further reduce drug abuse in a drug- treatment setting. The results are 
promising: Incentives to reduce opi[INVESTIGATOR_850192] 25 – 60% relative to medication and counseling alone (Petry et al., 2006; Schottenfeld et al., 2005) . Similar effects have been demonstrated repeatedly across a wealth of 
populations, substance -abuse disorders, and payment methodologies (see Lussier et al., 
2006; Higgins et a l., 2011; Davis et al., 2016; and Higgins et al., 2016 for reviews of 
providing incentives for managing addiction).  
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_850193], incentive pro grams have not been widely 
implemented. A key barrier is that while the benefits are largely borne by [CONTACT_850233], there are large logistical costs th at must be borne by [CONTACT_29372]: most existing 
incentive programs involve manual, in- person meas urement of behaviors, and prize or 
voucher purchase and delivery by [CONTACT_96937]. The significant clinic -level legwork 
necessary to set up these programs, including setting up behavioral and payment tracking systems, training staff, etc., have prevented th e programs from scaling widely (Benishek 
et al., 2014) . In sum, prior experience h as consistently shown that incentives increase 
duration of treatment and decrease substance abuse, but the logistical complications remain a hurdle to implementation.  
We propose to conduct the first randomized evaluation of an innovative, scalable incentiv es program for opi[INVESTIGATOR_850194] a mobile application. The 
application, which was developed by [CONTACT_850234], DynamiCare Health, provides a “turnkey” solution that health clinics can easily prescribe. The app enables remote moni toring of behavior; for example, drug tests can be administered in patients’ 
homes, as patients submit “selfie -videos” showing them taking saliva drug tests, which 
are then verified by [CONTACT_850235]. Treatment adherence can similarly be checked through GPS tracking for on- site methadone pharmacotherapy. The efficacy of this 
approach has not been tested rigorously before.  
This study will address two key knowledge gaps in the logistics of existing incentive program design for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827]. First, w e will test the first technology that we know 
of for remote monitoring of abstinence behavior for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441]. Remote monitoring of abstinence from cigarettes and alcohol has been integral in reducing the costs and extending the potential reach of incentive  programs for people with nicotine/tobacco and 
alcohol use disorders (e.g. to vulnerable or rural populations), and our study promises to do the same for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827] (see for a review of remote monitoring technologies for incentive delivery). Our seco nd gap is in remote delivery of incentives. After a behavior 
is verified, the app will deliver incentives to patients as cash available on a linked debit card. The delay between monitoring of the target behavior and the delivery of financial incentives has  been shown to be a significant moderator of treatment effect size (Lussier, 
Heil, Mongeon, Badger, & Higgins, 2006) . Our technology allows patients to receive 
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182058] immediately following the undertaking of the incentivized behavior: a  
first in incentives for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827]. 
Another novel feature of our design allows us to address a gap in the literature on 
incentive delivery: we compare both  the isolated effects of incentives and of the 
monitoring needed to implement an incentive pro gram. In addition to a control group, our 
full experiment includes both monitoring groups  and incentives groups. While existing 
literature on incentives for addiction has included either  a monitoring group or a control 
group, to our knowledge we are the fi rst to include both, such that a comparison can be 
made between incentives that are distal (inputs) and proximal (outcome) to the targeted abstinence behavior.  
Finally, our experiment will directly address two  key open questions  in the literature on 
incen tives for drug -users . The first question is  whether it is more effective to directly 
incentivize the outcome of interest – drug abstinence – or to incentivize behaviors that are inputs into the production of abstinence. In a similarly designed study, Petry et al. (2012) did not detect different effects on abstinence from incentivizing treatment attendance and incentivizing cocaine abstinence among cocaine users (both were effective): however, not only was this study for a different substance use disorder, but because of differential rates of test submission among these two groups, the results were not conclusive. We will similarly compare two versions of the incentive program: one that incentivizes inputs to achieving abstinence, and one that incentivizes th e outcome of abstinence. To address 
differential test submission rates, we will measure the impacts of the intervention with urine drug- tests administered identically to patients in both treatments. In addition, we 
will use a novel combination of baseline survey data and preferences among future 
incentive programs to inform our understanding of why, and for whom, incentives for inputs and outputs are differently effective.  
The second question is how to optimize  the size of incentives over time to maximize  
incentive effectiveness. We propose to do this by [CONTACT_850236] s in both the Inputs and Outcomes groups . We will then 
use the variation in incentive amounts across participant s and time to fit a s tructural 
model of abstinence behaviors over time. We will then use the model to describe the optimal shape of incentives over time.   
The results of this intervention will be directly relevant for potential users of this or similar mobile applications for incentive provision among people with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- use 
disorders, including insurers, treatment facilities, and governments.  
 
II. Specific Aim s 
Research Question:  
Our first research question  is whether two incentive delivery approaches, one targeting 
inputs to abst inence and one targeting the outcome of abstinence, are effective in 
promoting abstinence from non- medical  opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] . We will also investigate how incentive  
amounts and timing  influences its effectiveness. Our primary hypotheses are listed below. 
4/1/21  Page 5 of 27  Hypothesis 1: Providing mobile -app-based incentives will increase the longest 
duration of abstinence from non -medical  opi[INVESTIGATOR_850195] a control group receiving 
treatment as usual.  
To assess this, we will compare abstinence outcomes (longest duration and percent 
negative urine /saliva  samples) between the pooled Inputs and Outcomes groups and 
pooled Monitoring and Control groups, during the intervention period.  
Hypothesis 2: Incentives have persistent effects on abstinence from non -medical  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], even after the i ncentive program ends.  
We will compare abstinence outcomes between pooled Inputs and Outcomes groups and pooled Monitoring and Control groups, during the follow -up period.  
Hypothesis 3: Abstinence is differentially affected by [CONTACT_850237].  
We will compare abstinence outcomes between the Inputs and Outcomes groups during the intervention period  
Hypothesis 4: T he differential impact of inputs vs. outcomes incentives depends on 
underlying characteristics of patients and their environment.  
We will analyze the heterogeneity of the effectiveness of the two incentive treatments according to baseline measures of risk aversion, risk exposure, impatience, and 
knowledge of the pathway to abstinence.  
Hypothesis 5: The time -path of incentives can be modified to increase their cost -
effectiveness.  
We will model how patients respond to incentives of different amounts at different times and use the model to predict the optimal time path of incent ives. 
The objective of this research is to assess the efficacy of two new incentives programs for abstinence behavior, thereby [CONTACT_850238].  
  
III. Study End Points  
The primary endpoint is the longest period of continuous abstinence from non- medical  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438], where abstinence is measured using lab- verified in -person urine -tests or video-
verified saliva tests .  
The secondary endpoint s include  the percent of three (3) scheduled urinalyses /saliva 
test results classif ied as negative, the percent of psychotherapy visits attended, the rate 
of discharging from treatment before completion (discharge against medical advice), and the adherence to medication assisted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
There are no intervention -related safety endpoints that we expect  will cause participant s 
to end parti cipation due to safety concerns . 
 
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182059] a randomized controlled trial pi[INVESTIGATOR_850196], or inputs to abstinence, among 600 adults with opi[INVESTIGATOR_850197], Wisconsin. Participant s will be recruited 
from outpatients  (partial and day treatment programs)  with substance use disorders in 
treatment at the Adult Behavioral Health Program  within the  Aurora  Health Care system . 
Incentivized behaviors will be monitored and rewarded through a mobile application developed by [CONTACT_850239], Dynami Care Management. We will 
evaluate the incentives using a combination of administrative da ta and surveys. In 
preparation for this experiment, we will conduct a Phase [ADDRESS_1182060] and fine -tune our study protocols. Any significant alteration to the protocol or any change 
that affects Human Participants concerns will be su bmitted to the IRB as a modification.  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_850198]:  
• The total duration of an individual participant’s participation in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (including follow -up) is 3 months. 
• The anticipated duration to enroll all study participants is 3 months . 
• The estimated date for the investigators to complete this pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] (complete primary 
analyses) is September 30, 2020. 
 
Study Timeline:  
• The total duration of an individual participant ’s participation in the study 
(including follow -up) is 9 months: a 3- month intervention, and a 6- month follow -
up. 
• The anticipated duration to enroll all study participant s is 30 months . 
• The estimated date for the investigators to complete this study (complete primary 
analyses) is June 1, 2023.  
In addition to the prospecti vely collected dat a, we will pu ll EHR data for 
patients whose records indicate that they were treated for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_850199] (SUD PHP , IOP, or outpatient)  during similar 
dates of service to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. Dates of service for these retrospective patients will be between April  1 March 31, 2021. We will use d ata from these individuals 
for two purposes: First, to better understand potential enrol lment rates going 
forward, as there may be seasonal variation in t reatment enrollment. Second, to 
form a " Control" group of similar patients to our pi[INVESTIGATOR_850200]. Compar isons  
between "Control" and "Treatment" patients will allow us to estimate a treatment effect, which we will input into power calcula tions for assessing the necessary 
sample size for the full s tudy.
 
 
 
4/1/21  Page 7 of 27  V. Experimental Design and Methods (or Study Procedures)  
Interventions  
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]: During the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], the study population will be randomly divided into three treatment 
groups: Inputs , Outcomes , and Combined. The study will include a twelve -week 
interventi on period, during which each group will receive different inte rventions  in 
addition to their standard of care treatment through AAH .  
Inputs Group: During the intervention period, the “Inputs” group will receive incentives for behaviors that are inputs to abstaining from drug use. Patients in this group will receive the  same services and urine drug -test schedule as st andard of care. Additionally, 
patients will be registered for a mobile phone appli cation (app) provide d by [CONTACT_850240] a linked debit card. The debit card does not display the participant’s name [CONTACT_850262] (e.g., 
cannot be used for purchasing alcohol). The app wil l prompt patients to  complete actions 
that are inputs to abs tinence an average of t hree times  per week. These actions w ill be  
tailored to the patient’s individual needs, and may include:  
• Drug adherence to prescribed drug- maintenance therapy.  
• Attendance at individual and group psychotherapy sessions (monitored by [CONTACT_850241] -person or via EHR recor ds for patients attending 
virtually ).  
• Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Modules offering patients self -
guided addiction counseli ng.  
Patients will r eceive immediate financial rewards for c ompleting a subset of these  action s 
prompted by [CONTACT_9426].  
Control Group: This group will not have received any opportunity t o enroll in the study 
because they were in treatment during times outside of the study enrol lment period. As a 
result, they will not  have had access to the DynamiC are app or any surveys/ study data 
collection.  
The inc entive amounts offered in the inputs group will vary randomly across participant s 
in order to understand how eff ectiveness varies a ccording to incentive amount.  
Outcomes G roup:  During the intervention period, the “Outcomes” group will receive 
incentive s for abstaining from drug use. Patients in this group will receive the same 
services and urine drug -test schedule as standard of care and a similar mobile app and 
debit card as the Inputs group, as well as access to Mobile Cogniti ve Behavioral Therapy 
(CBT) Modules . However, the app will prompt patients in this group to submit saliva 
drug tests through their mobile phones on a random sc hedule (averaging three tests per 
week). Patients will receive immediate financial rewards in  exchange for submitting 
drug- negative samples. Saliva tests  typi[INVESTIGATOR_44769] a window of detection between 24- 48 
hours after drug use.   
Combined Inputs/Outputs Group:  This group will receive interventions from both Inputs 
and Outputs groups , as well as stan dard of care therapy services  and urine drug tests. 
Interventions include incentives for  a combination of the following actions : 
4/1/21  Page 8 of 27  • Drug adherence to prescribed drug- maintenance therapy.  
• Attendance at indiv idual and group psychotherapy sessions (monitored by [CONTACT_850242]- person or via EHR records for patients attending 
virtually ).  
• Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Mod ules offering patie nts self -
guided addiction counseling.  
• Random saliva tests.  
Patients will receive immediate financial rewards if they comp lete each action prompted 
by [CONTACT_9426].  
Other Procedures  
All participant s in the study will continue to receive Auro ra’s standard opi[INVESTIGATOR_2495] d use 
disorder  treatment, which may be vi rtual or in -person. Standard of care treatment  consist s 
of pharmacotherapy, individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, and urine drug 
screens  (if in -person) . As part of in -person standard of c are, urine drug scr eens are 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_380047] [ADDRESS_1182061] acces s to mobile Cognitive Behavioral Thera py (CBT) Modules 
through DynamiCare Health offering patients self -guided subs tance use counselin g, 
which will not be incentivized .  
Patie nts in all groups  will be asked to submit saliva drug tests at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 
through the app , in addition to the routine  clinical  urine drug screens (and, for the 
Outcomes group, randomized s aliva samples ) ment ioned above. The  pre-scheduled saliva 
samples will be  rewarded $20 non- contingent  on positive/negative status. If no sali va 
tests are submitted, patients can be asked to submit a non- clinical urine sample in -person 
(incentivized with $20) , their record s will be checked for recent clinical urine s amples  
(no incentive provided) , or they will be asked about their recent drug us e (no incentive 
provided).  
Any saliva/urine samples collected for  research purposes over and above the routine urin e 
testing that o ccurs in treatment as usual  are not performed  as part of clinical care and will 
not be shared with the clinical care team.  
Surveys: All patients will receive  a baseline and endline survey. In addition, we will 
electronically administer the W HOQOL -BREF  survey through the DynamiCare app at 
weeks 4, 8, and 12. The WHOQOL -BRE F is a validated, commonly used s urvey to 
measure quality of  life. 
No other procedures are per formed on the participant s of this study. 
We do not anticipate any risks associated with the sa liva test. However, tests will be 
administere d through the DynamiCare Rewards app and will be checked by [CONTACT_850243] .  
Incentives  
Payments  will be made  to all participant s as part of the evaluation activities:  We 
plan to provide inc entives to  all participant s for completing th e subset of non- standard -of-
4/1/21  Page 9 of 27  care saliva /urine tests completed during the course of the intervention period – those  at 4,  
8, and [ADDRESS_1182062]- of-care 
treatment at A urora will not be incentiviz ed; these could be on weeks 4, 8, and 12 as 
needed . The incentive will be provided to participant s in all groups in the form of $20 via 
the app (if saliva) or via Amazon gift c ard (if in -person) . In addition, we plan to provi de 
$20 Amazon gift cards to pat ients for complet ing the Endline survey. The maximum that 
can be earned from primary outcomes sal iva/urine collection and surve ys (3 urine/saliva 
samples + 1 endline survey) is $ 80. 
Further, we are adding on $2/survey fo r secondary outcomes of the completing the 
WHOQOL sur vey at baseline, Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12. Th erefore, subjects could earn an 
additio nal $ 8for surveys.  
Payments made to participant s assigned to one of the incentives groups as part of 
the incentives  interv ention: Patients in all Pi[INVESTIGATOR_850201]. W ith up to 13 random tests per month, up 
to $130 can be earned per month; however, on average only about 70% of that amount is 
earned  ($91) . The debit  card can only be used for restricted purchases; for example, it 
cannot be spent at bars, liquor stores , casinos , etc. 
The application has two types of reward schedules. F or some tasks, the  application uses 
an escalating rewards schedule with a hard  reset  (i.e., completing the f irst task earns a 
predetermine d amount of money with an escalation at each successful ste p, and missing 
or failing a task re duces/resets the reward ). This type of schedule is consistent with 
previous contingency management protocols .  
Rewards  schedule  for behaviors  on the streak  (i.e., saliva tests and medication  
adherence )  
• Amount of  first re ward: $2  
• Reward escalation interval: $2  (i.e., each time the behavior is successful, the 
incentive amount goes up by $2 for the next beh avior)  
• Maximum reward for a si ngle behavior : $10   
• Reward reset value: $2  (i.e., if a behavior is unsuccessful , the inc entive amount 
for the next behavior resets to $2)  
• If action unverifiable/cancelled: no escalation/no reset   
 
Rewards schedule for non- streak behaviors  (i.e., appointm ents)   
The application also al lows for an independent rewards schedule (i.e., t he reward 
received for a given task is determined independently of how the patient has performed 
on other tasks). In the independent rewards schedu le, patients earn a preset nu mber  of 
dollars  for activities.  Missing or failing an independent -rewards task d oes not im pact the 
reward for future tasks  or depend on performance of previous tasks. Amount  of each  
reward : $5  
This was necessary because the ap p cannot currently incorpora te appointments into their 
streak formula, so every appoint is worth a fixed $6. 
The incent ivized behaviors differ among the three groups.   
• “Outcomes” patients only receive incentives for illicit opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- negative saliva tests   
4/1/21  Page 10 of 27  • “Inputs ” patients only receive incentives for dru g adherence and appointment 
attendance (including virtual appointments)   
• “Combined” patients receive incentives for all behaviors above

VI. Risks  
The purpose this study is to me asure the effectiveness of Contingency Management (as 
delivered by [CONTACT_133303] -based D ynamiCare Rew ards system) as an adjunct to 
standard tr eatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_850206]. This is a low -risk study, as the proposed 
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182068] r isks tend not  to be of a large magnitude, participant s may 
experience discourag ement if they don’t meet the ir goal, or if they do meet the goal but 
do not get appropri ately rewarded due to rare but possible false positive r esults in the 
tests. In addition, al though we purposefully mitigate risk by [CONTACT_850249] ( e.g., not for payment at a liquor store), participant s may 
still use the debit card for contra -therapeutic purposes a nd engage in harmful behaviors 
such as purchasing alcohol or cigarettes.  
A final potential risk is that partici pant confidentiality could be breached, in regard to 
patient health information, during transmission of electronic data including patient names 
or exercise adherence. Participan ts can declin e to be in the study or leave the study e arly 
if they have any concerns and , as an alternative to study participation, they can continue 
in usual care.   
It is not expected that participation in the study will c ontribute any significant cost t o 
participant s. However, requisite to participation in the study, their smart phones must 
have a data plan in order to run the application. Each saliva test video is ~ 60 MB. In the 
app settings there is an option, "Upload only over Wi -Fi." This will store the  video on 
their phone until the participant ’s phone  establishes a Wi -Fi connection, at which point 
the app will automatically upload the video (even if the phone is  just in their pocket). As 
such, participant s with low d ata caps can choose to use that f eature to avoid potentially 
adding extra data charges. 
Risk Associated with a B reach of Confidentiality  
To protect confidentiality, all research participant s will be a ssigned unique participant  
identification codes that will  be used on all study- related fo rms and online websites. 
Documents that include the pa rticipants’ full names (e .g., signed informed consent  forms) 
will be stored in an independent binder, consistent with FDA Good Clinical Practice 
Guidelines, and will be k ept in a locked area. Confidenti al informatio n will never be 
shared with anyone outside of the research program  without the explicit writte n 
permission of the research participant , and a Certificate of Confidentiality will be 
obtained from the NIH for the  study in order to protect partic ipant data. O nly selected 
designated staff members wil l be approved to share confidential information after  explicit 
written permission is obtained from the participan t and the participant  will be able to 
revoke written per mission at any time. In accordanc e with IRB re quirements, all research 
staff will be fo rmally trained in these p rocedures. No identifying pa rticipant information 
will be used in written reports, manus cripts and/or conference presentations. 
[CONTACT_850263] (PI), behavioral economist Lead Investi gators ([CONTACT_850264]-Ross and [CONTACT_850265]) , and the AAH re search associate will be the only individuals who wil l have 
access to cross -linking information that connects the  study identification number to 
4/1/21  Page 16 of 27  identifiable personal in formation, such as participant  name [CONTACT_3732]. Even though 
the final dataset will be stripped of identifi ers prior to release for sha ring, we believe that 
there remains the possibility of deduc tive disclosure of participant s with unusual 
characteris tics. Thus, we will make the data  and associat ed documentation available to 
users only under a data- sharing agre ement that provides for: (1)  a commitment to using 
the data only for research purposes a nd not to identify any individual participant ; (2) a 
commitment to securing the data usin g appropriate  computer technology; and (3) a 
commitmen t to destroying or returning the data after analyses are completed.  
In addition to written participant  data, vide os of participant s are uploaded into the 
DynamiCare plat form for saliva assessments.  Dyna miCare Reward s is a HIPAA -
compliant platform designed for use in healthcare set tings. It protects patient information 
with encryption in- transit and at -rest, and limits visibility of patient data to only those 
with authoriz ed access. These data are automat ically uploaded to the DynamiCare 
HIPAA -compliant serv er. Only staff working on the research project at the various sites 
(i.e. DynamiCare Health, Aurora Health Care, University of [LOCATION_004] -Berkeley, and 
University of Chi cago) will have access to partici pant data.  
Further, accounts for DynamiCare access wil l be issued , tracked, and  removed/added by 
[CONTACT_850250] [INVESTIGATOR_850207]. If the Aur ora PI [INVESTIGATOR_850208], then a replacement (interim) PI [INVESTIGATOR_850209] d and put in place before 
the original PI [INVESTIGATOR_850210] a PI [INVESTIGATOR_850211]/change pers onnel 
access. In an emergency situation (e.g., the PI [INVESTIGATOR_850212]), the A urora  research 
associate is authorized t o make these changes.  
If the subjec t is recei ving virtual behavioral health therapy, i t is likely that interact ions between 
the subject  and RA will occur via Zoom. AAH has access to a HIPAA -compliant  Zoom platform, 
which is currently used for providing be havioral health therapy. This sam e platform wi ll be used 
to offer Zoom meetings with subjects; no videos or phot os will be recorded  during t hese Zoom 
meetings. Zoom links will be sent either to personal emails or personal  phone texts as provi ded 
by [CONTACT_850251] (in othe r words, the patient wil l provide these emails/ phone numbers).  
Zoom meetings with potential subjects may or ma y not immediately follow  their group t herapy 
meetings ; this depends ent irely o n the patient ’s availability. Zo om meetings may b e sched uled at 
other time s, and the sche duling agreem ent with the patient may be done via pers onal email or via 
phone call . Zoom meeting confirmations will If done via email, the email will be generic and no t 
point to the study purpose (e.g., the email may be tit led: “ Zoom Meeting : AAH Resear ch Stu dy” 
or som ething similarly  vagu e and not mentioning substance  use or any other diagnosis /disorder 
categ ory. The consent form will be provided during the Zoom call v ia Zoom download and via 
link to DocuSign. The patient m ay sign the consent form via DocuSig n during t he meeting or,  if 
the patient provides ap proval, the consent form or DocuSign link may be emai led to the patient ’s 
personal email.  There are no clinical p arameters f or arranging these meetings as they are not 
clinical visits.  
Provisions for Re search Related Harm/Injury  
Although this study involve s minimal risk and no adverse events are expected, th e resources 
of Aurora Health’s clinical team are available to handle any unforeseen events, as they would 
be for pat ients not involved in a research pro tocol. Eac h of Aurora’s  OTP sites is medically 
staffed to assess acute issues that may arise in the cont ext of OUD treatment, and the 
programs have access to standa rd psychiatric and counsel ing services.  
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182069] suggested these benefits are 
likely to occur . 
If the study endpoints are positively affected, it will serve as evi dence of the effectiveness 
of the  DynamiCare m obile application: the first scalable, tu rnkey solution for incentives 
for healthy behaviors a mong people (i.e., contingency management) among people with 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- use disorders.  
In addition, the study will push the frontier of knowledge on how  incentives  in general 
can be more effectively applied  in similar populations, lea ding to potential improvem ents 
in the design of contingency management broadly. This w ill result in more efficac ious 
interventions for people seeking treatment for substance u se disorders.  
 
VIII.  Sample Size  
We will recruit 36 particip ants to pi[INVESTIGATOR_850213] .  
 
IX. Study Population  
Include  Exclude  Vulnerable Population T ype 
  Adults unable to c onsent  due to cognitive impair ment  (i.e., 
current diagnosis for ps ychosis  or non- English speaking)  
  Individuals who are not yet adults (e.g. infants, children, 
teenage rs) 
  Wards of the State (e.g. foster children)  
  Mental ly ill 
  Women, including pregnant women 
  Economically disadvantaged 
  Minorities  
  Prisoner s 
 
4/1/21  Page 18 of 27  The study will be conducted among out patients with opi[INVESTIGATOR_850214]. This population includes a number of vulnerable population t ypes that will be 
included in the study. For example, ec onomically disadvantaged individuals , people w ith 
mental -health comorbidities, women (i ncluding pregnant women)  and minorities are 
included in the category of vulnerable populations .  
That stated, the  potential risks of this minimal- risk study are far outw eighed by [CONTACT_850252] , both for the individuals invol ved and for the 
vulnerable populations as a collectiv e. First, participant s will have the chance to receive 
conti ngencies  for abstinence -promoting behaviors, which may both reduce substance 
abuse. Se cond, the result s of the study will be published. These r esults will inform the 
academic and treatment community of the availability and effectiveness of smartphone -
based  contingency management, a nd whether inputs - or outcomes -based reinforcement 
has larger clin ical effect sizes. Third, the study results will in form the further refinement  
of the mobile app, which will increase its effectiveness in helpi[INVESTIGATOR_850215] (and pe rhaps make it more effective f or the participant s themselves  if th ey 
choose to use the app later).  It is critical tha t solutions for opi[INVESTIGATOR_850216]- faceted populations who can benefit from treatment, and these 
populations naturally include a number of vulnerable groups .  
Because thi s is m inimal- risk research, there is comparatively greater upside benefit for 
partic ipant s than there is any r esearch -related risk of harm.  
The benefit of non- exclusion of vulnerable populations f rom research participation is the 
improvement in understandi ng str ategies to  encourage abstinence among t he populations  
where these strategies are needed most .   
In order  to protect the welfare of vulnerable populations, individua ls in the study must be 
already enrolled in Aurora Healt h’s Behavioral Treatment Progr am for  treatment of their 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_850217] -occurring mental health dia gnoses . This will ensure they 
already have access to standard -of-care treatment necess ary for their medical need s. 
Qualifying candidates meet the following Inclusion and Exclusio n criteria : 
 
a. Inclusion Criteria  
1. Age at least 18 years old ;

3. Have access t o a smartphone (iOS or Android) with data plan  and willing to 
download DynamiC are app ; 
4. Are in day  (PHP) , partial day  (IOP) , residential, or outpatient  AODA treatmen t in 
Aurora Health’s Behavioral Health Program ; 
5. Are currently prescribed or will be pr escribed within 1- 4 days bupr enorphine , 
naltrexone, or me thadone  for their OUD;  
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182070] ONE of the 
following conditions is true:  
a. Were first enrol led in day or partial day opi[INVESTIGATOR_850221] 2 
treatment week s (14 days /encounters  of treatment ) prior to providing 
informed consent.  
b. Currently using non- medical  opi[INVESTIGATOR_27968]. 
c. Regularly missing scheduled AODA a ppointment s. 
7. Understands English.  
b. Exclusion Criteria  
1. Have evidence of active (non -substance related) psychosis  that might impair 
participation as d etermined by [CONTACT_978] . 
2. Has signi ficant cognitive impair ment that might confound participation as 
determined by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_850222] a 
legal guardian.  
Note that pregnant women are not excluded from participating i n the study. 
 
 
X. Recruitment and Screening  
Participant s will be actively recruited into the study  in one of two  way s. Eit her patients 
will be recruited  at patient intake at Aurora’s Behavioral Heal th Program  or referred to 
the study by [CONTACT_850253]’s assent . 
The first stage of recruitment ( eligibility screening ) will be conducted by t he re search  
team . This team  will determine if potential participant s (who have or have not yet 
expressed interest in the study) meet all inclusion c riteria below except  Smartphone and 
data plan access,  and no exclusion criteria. Qualifying potential part icipants will then be 
directed to the Research Associate to determine whether their phone  and data plan access 
meet study requirements.   
If an interes ted patient meets inclusion criteria (specified above ), the Research Assistant  
will arrange for the patien t to co mplete  research consent as described in S ection XV 
below. Patients will be offered  the opportunity to consent to participation. However, 
eligible patients that are not prepared to give informed consent on the same day will be 
given the contact [CONTACT_107102] r of the Research Associate and m ay consent at a later date as 
long as they are within el igibility timelines.  
There are no  materials needed for recru itment.  
We do not anticipate withdrawing participant s from the study without their consent. 
However, parti cipants can d ecline to be in the study, or leave the study early if they have 
any concerns, a nd as an alternative to study participation they can cont inue in usual care.     
Research participant s who wish  to fully withdraw from the study can do so by [CONTACT_850254] o r Principal Investigator. Contact [CONTACT_430454] 
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182071] uri ne samples  and other 
avail able outcome data from that participant . 
 
XI. Privacy Plan  
All c ommu nication with the participant s during the study will be t hrough in- person 
appointments , through the DynamiCare  application , via patie nt-provided email, phone, 
and/or AAH- purcha sed Z oom. DynamiCare will execute a Business Associates 
Agreement with Aurora Health Care to provide a HIPAA umbrella over the patient -
generated data. The smartphone application requires the  user to input a userna me and 
password, allowing for the ir control  over their private information.  
Questions asked will be minimally intrusive . However, participant s will be told in 
advance that they may  refuse to answer any question at any time. Research Assistant s 
who are trai ned in working with patients with s ubstance use disorders, and who are 
culturally sensitive, will conduct enrollment. E xami nations and procedures, such as 
urinalysis, will be no more i ntrusive than standard care as provided in the Aurora 
substance use disorder  treatment programs.  
The geogra phical l ocations system within the app only tracks the location of the 
participant  within a small window of time related to their programmed clin ical 
appointments. As a result, the data collected on phone  location are specific and minimal.  
 
XII. Data Collection  
Data Sources  & Description  
Survey data, mobile application data, and clinic  data wi ll be used during the study.  
Baseline survey data will measu re characteristics such as risk aversion, time prefer ences, 
knowledge about the pathway to abstinence, and a re al-stakes measure of preferences for 
inputs -based versus outcomes -based incentive pr ograms. Administrative data will include 
urine test results, medi cation compliance measures, appointment attendance, and CBT 
module usage  in groups randomized to use the ap p. Basel ine survey data will measure 
characteristics such as risk aversion, time pre ferences, knowledge about the pathway to 
abstinence,  phone and data plan access,  and a real -stakes measure of pref erences for 
inputs -based versus outcomes -based ince ntive  programs. Periodic surveys administer ed 
through the DynamiCare app will measure other  behaviors such as avoidance  of “trigger” 
situations and stre ss-relieving activities. Endline  survey data will mea sure self -reported 
drug use, drug avoidance behavior, he alth, and quality- of-life data . 
The su rvey instruments are currently under development  with the intent to be 
admin istered digitally through partici pants’ smart phones. We will begin pi[INVESTIGATOR_850223] 
4/1/[ADDRESS_1182072], and limits 
visibility o f patien t data to only those with authorized access. In this  study, data will be 
collected on saliva tests, medicatio n adherence, treatment attendance, and self -guided 
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) modules; these dat a are automatically uploaded to 
the DynamiC are HIPAA -compliant server.  Data on participant  utilization of the smart 
debit card will be available from T rue Link Financial, Inc., via a confidential data -sharing 
agreement.  
Administrative data will be collec ted from Aurora Health Care clinical record s, including 
alcohol and/or substance use record s. These records will be i ntegral to the study for a 
number of reasons. First, we will stra tify our randomization by [CONTACT_850255] t, and conduct sub- analyses based o n these variables. Second, 
we need to verify upcoming appointments at the Aurora Beh avioral Health Program  (to 
be incen tivized or prompted in the app in the Inputs or Combi ned groups ). Third, we will 
use clinical urinalys is results to measure non- medical  drug use in the construction of our 
primary outcome measure . 
Only designated staff wo rking on the research project at Au rora Health  Care will have 
access to participant  PHI. All personal data collected will be used for rese arch purposes 
only, including det ermination of study eligibility and to characterize the sam ple. All 
records and data  will be kept strictly confidential and will only be released to research 
staff with the specific written consent of the participant . Participants will be assigned a 
unique  identif ying code at the time of study enrollment to help e nsure confidentiality. All 
data will be stored in RedCap, whi ch is an encrypted progra m designed specifically for 
research and clinical trials . The Re dCap database is onl y accessible to AAH employees.

 Secure Data Storage and Transmission  
The PHI  will b e collected di gitally by a Research Associate an d will be stored in RedCap  
at Aurora Health C are. De -identified data will be stored in encrypted files on a secure 
server at the University o f Chicago. Data will be shared only among the key project 
personnel , using hard encryption methods. 
After data anal ysis and p ublication, all available study dat a wil l be permanently stripped 
of identifiers. The de -identified data will be kept u ntil 7 years  after the data analysis is 
complete per BCBA ethics guideli nes (
https ://www.bacb.com/wp -
content/uploads/BACB -Compliance -Code -english_190318.pdf ). After [ADDRESS_1182074] and limits visib ility of patient data to only those with authorized a ccess. In this  study, 
data will be collected on saliva tests, me dication  adherence, treatment attendance, and 
self-guided Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) modules; these data are automatica lly 
uploaded to the DynamiCare HIPAA -compliant server. Remote tes ting da ta will be 
verified  through inspection of “selfie -videos”  to guar antee quality. Data on participant  
utilizat ion of the smart debit card will be available from True Link Financial, Inc. , via a 
confidential data -sharing agreement. Only staff working on the r esearch  project at the 
various sites (i.e. DynamiCare H ealth, UC Berkeley , University of Chicago, Au rora 
4/1/21  Page 25 of 27  Heal th Care ) will have access to participant  data. Names that are linked to identifiers will 
be stored in independent binders as well as the pas sword -protecte d, encrypted electronic 
database separate from t he data.  
Personally -identifying information w ill be delinked completely from the data set and all 
data will be presented in aggre gate in any report.  
 
XIII.  Statistical Plan  
For the pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], we will des criptiv ely analyze the Inp uts versus Outcomes  versus Combined 
groups. The treatment groups will al so be compared to the historical control group. 
For the full study, t he randomized de sign all ows us to di rectly compare abstinence 
(longest duration and percent nega tive urine samples) between our different treatment 
arms as follows:  
1. Inputs Group vs. Outcomes Group  
2. Pooled Inputs and Outcomes Groups vs. pooled Control and Monitoring 
Groups  
3. Poole d Inputs and Outcomes Groups vs. Control Group  
4. Pooled Inputs and Outcomes G roups v s. Monitoring Group  
We will test for differences in the mean o f our primary outcome vari ables – longest 
duration of abstinence  and per cent negative urine samples -  using a tw o-tailed t -test at a 
95% confidence level.  We will control for baseline ch aracter istics (e.g. time since most 
recent non -medical  drug use at ba seline, total time in trea tment, and distance from clinic). 
We w ill also  look at the heterogeneity by [CONTACT_850256]. Finally, we will conduct expl oratory sub- analyses according to dosage 
history and number of  times in treatment.  
Our target sample size of 200 patients i n each of two incentives groups (Inputs and 
Outcom es), and [ADDRESS_1182075] minimum effects between the 
incentive  groups of one additional week of continuous abstinence in our 12 -week 
intervention, and a 7.5 percentage point increase in opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480]- negative urine samples.  
 
XIV. Monitoring Pla n 
Not applicable: the human research  involves minimal risk to participant s. 
The s tudy has  no prematur e stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877]: it will continue until the target sample size i s 
reached.

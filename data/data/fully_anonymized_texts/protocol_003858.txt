Original Protocol   25 September 2020 , version 1 (electronic 2.0) 
Amended protocol 01 (27 September 2022 ) 
This amended protocol (amendment 01) is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set 
forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union.  
OVERALL RATIONALE FOR THE AMENDMENT  
The primary purpose of this amendment is to redefine the Cold Urticaria Activity  Score  
(ColdUAS)  efficacy  endpoints. It is anticipated that the newly defined ColdUAS endpoints are 
more sensitive to detect a treatment effect and will better address the objectives of the EFC16720 
study.

endpoints:  
• Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of 
primary acquired chronic inducible ColdU at 
Week  12 and Week  24 compared with placebo  
• Change from baseline in Patient Global Impression 
of Severity (PGIS) of primary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU at Week 12 and Week 24 
compared with placebo  PGIS and PGIC scales are used in the 
study as a benchmark/anchor 
instrument for the analysis of the other 
patient -reported outcomes ( PROs ). 
Therefore,  they were considered 
exploratory endpoints rather than 
secondary  ones .

(WOCF ) approach ” for participants taking high ly 
influential prohibited medications and/or highly 
influential rescue medications . 
• The following changes related to missing data 
handling were made: For participants who 
discontinue study intervention due to lack of 
efficacy, all data collected after discontinuation will 
be used in the analysis, and a WOCF approach will 
be used to impute  missing Week [ADDRESS_810435] 
taken the highly influential prohibited medications 
and/or highly influential rescue medications on or 
before Week 24 and excluding patients who 
discontinue due to lack of efficacy on or before 
Week 24.  Handling of missing data after  taking 
highly influential prohibited medications 
and/or highly influential rescue 
medications or after withdrawal of 
study intervention are modified to 
include each participant's own worst 
data in order to better reflect the clinical 
scenario of treatment  failure.

Measures to 
minimize bias: 
Randomization and 
blinding  • Code breaking: Investigator could decide at his/her 
discretion to contact [CONTACT_611278]’s 
intervention assignment.  To clari fy that the responsibility to 
unblind treatment assignment in 
emergency situations resides solely 
with the investigator as per the EMA 
GCP Inspectors Working Group (GCP 
IWG) and the Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group (CTFG). Consequently, the 
Sponsor cannot  require or insist on 
being involved in the decision to 
unblind, stall or delay in any way the 
unblinding of trial participant treatment 
in emergency situations.

Short title:  Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611173] H1 -antihistamine  
Rationale : 
Chronic inducible urticaria (CIndU ) is a subtype of chronic urticaria characterized by [CONTACT_611280], angioedema, or both with a minimum disease  duration of 6 weeks, that only occurs 
after exposure to defined  external triggers and is classified according to the stimulus t hat provokes 
the development of signs and symptoms (1, 2). Unlike chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU ), 
symptoms in CIndU patients ( itchy wheals and angioedema) develop only and repro ducibly in 
response to the trigger stimulus that is specific for their condition (eg, cold exposure in cold 
urticaria [ColdU ]). The triggers that lead to the urticarial signs and symptoms in CIndU patients 
are mainly physical or chemical stimuli , which results in 2 main sub -groups of CIndU : physical 
and non -physical, respectively . Physical triggers include pressure (in delayed pressure urticaria 
[DPU ]), radiation (in solar urticaria), friction (in symptomatic dermographism), temperature (in 
cold and heat urticaria), and vibration (in vibratory angioedema). Chemical triggers of CIndU 
reactions include  water (in aquagenic urticaria), sweat (in cholinerg ic urticaria [CholU ]), and 
other urticariogenic chemical compounds (in contact [CONTACT_22815]) ( 3). 
Chronic inducible urticaria has an estimated prevalence of about 0.5% in the general population  
(4), and has substantial impact on quality of life (QoL ) in many patients, mainly due to the need 
for trigger avoidance. Within the group of CIndU, most CIndU subtypes are rare and therefore 
very difficult to study ( 1). The most common are symptomatic dermographism , CholU  and ColdU 
(also called chronic inducible cold urticaria),  chronic inducible ColdU  being the second most 
common form of physical urticaria ( 1). Cold urticaria  is a relatively rare disorder with a reported 
prevalence of 0.05% as per one study in Europe  (4), with a higher prevalence in northern climates. 
It is also self -limited, lasting 4 to 5 years on average  (5). 
Chronic inducible ColdU  manifests as wheals , angioedema, or both  secondary to the release of 
mast cell mediators after exposure to cold or cooling and rewarming of the skin. The clinical 
symptoms occur within minutes after skin contact [CONTACT_611281], cold liquids, cold solid objects, or 
evaporation -based cooling and pe rsist in general for a few hours ( 4). In severe cases, patients can 
develop systemic involvement including anaphylaxis. Local angioedema affe cting the lips, 
tongue, or pharyngeal tract has been associated with the ingestion of cold beverages or food, and 
shock like reactions are reported after swimming in cold water. Cold urticaria s can be classified as 
those with typi[INVESTIGATOR_611174], those with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_611175], and those with familial forms. Primary acquired chronic inducible ColdU  is the most 
common form of chronic inducible ColdU  and is considered idiopathic in nature. Historically the

cold-induced urticaria, with only rare occurrences of se condary cold -induced urticaria ( 6). 
Secondary acquired chronic inducible ColdU  is very rare and associated with an underlying 
disease most commonly cryoglobulinemia, but infectious causes, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and 
some drug -induced cases have been  reported. Both primary and secondary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU  have typi[INVESTIGATOR_611176]. Several other rare forms of 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_611177], w hich have negative immediate tests to cold 
provocation  and include systemic atypi[INVESTIGATOR_611178] , cold -dependent 
dermographism, cold -induced CholU, delayed chronic inducible ColdU , and localized cold -reflex 
urticaria. Lastly, hereditary forms of chronic inducible ColdU  have been described: 1) Familial 
cold autoinflammatory syndrome caused by [CONTACT_611282]3 (cryopyrin) and is inherited in 
an autosomal dominant manner, which includes cryopyrin -associated periodic syndromes, 
Muckle -Wells syndrome and neonatal -onset mul tisystem inflammatory disease; 2) Familial 
atypi[INVESTIGATOR_611179] 
C-g2-associated deficiency an d immune dysregulation (PLAID) ( 4). 
Chronic inducible urticarias are diagnosed based on the patient history and the results of 
provocation testing  (1, 2). The treatment of inducible urticaria is trigger avoidance and 
prophylaxis by H1 -antihistamines that preve nt the effects of the mast cell ‐mediator histamine 
(4, 7) or, if antihistamines are not effective, agents that prevent the activation of mast cells (eg, 
anti-immunoglobulin  E [IgE] omalizumab)  (7, 8, 9). The consensus recommendations for CIndU 
manag ement (EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) ( 1) are mainly based on treatments approved for 
CSU, and some clinical data available in patients suffering from various types of CIndUs 
(cholinergic, symptomatic dermographism, ColdU).  The recommended th erapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920], in general, 
not approved for CIndU by [CONTACT_17513], with only limited specific countries where 
antihistamines are approved under broader “urticaria” indications. All patients are advised to 
avoid prolonged skin contact [CONTACT_611283]. T he first -line 
symptomatic  therapy for CIndU is a non -sedating second -generation H1 antihistamine at 
approved doses for CSU. In patients who do not obtain complete control, increasing the dose up to 
[ADDRESS_810448] -line therapy with H1 -antihistamine ( 1). They are debilitating , often 
causes systemic reactions including anaphylaxis in severe cases  and severely affect patient QoL 
(7, 8). Avoidance of offending triggers poses massive changes to everyday life and therefor e is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_611180] . Thus, the need for approved treatment o ptions for CIndU, especially for 
chronic inducible ColdU  that have proven to be safe and efficacious in chronic inducible ColdU  
patients, is high.  
Chronic inducible ColdU  presents as  pruritic wheals with or without angioedema secondary to the 
release of mediators from mast cell s after exposure of the skin to cold air, liquid, or cold objects. 
Degranulation of mast cells in CIndU is held to be mediated by [CONTACT_611284] ( FcεRI ) 
activation, through cell surface -bound IgE cross -linked by [CONTACT_611285]. 
The subsequent release of histamine and other pr o-inflammatory mediators leads  to local tissue 
edema and p ruritus. Many symptoms of urticaria are mediated primarily by [CONTACT_611286]-CLIN-0635063 1.0

4. Participants  are equa lly randomized to the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611196].  
With these assumptions, 3 9 participants  per group ( 78 participants  in total) will provide 
90% power  to detect the difference of  response rate in the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611197] t he placebo group . The sample size calculations were performed 
using nQuery+nTerim 4.0.  
• Randomization  
Participants  will be randomized  in a 1:[ADDRESS_810458] stratified by [CONTACT_654] (adults versus adolescents) with at least 4  adolescents . Then 
in adult ’s randomization will be stratified further by [CONTACT_611291]

• Analysis of secondary endpoints  
The continuous secondary endpoints at Week 24 will be analyzed usi ng Analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA ) with multiple imputation. For p articipants  taking highly influential  
prohibited medications and/or highly influ ential rescue medications (details of selection 
will be specified in the SAP), their data after the medication usage will be set to missing, 
and the WOCF  approach (worst postbaseline observation for the participant will be carried 
forward) will be used to impute missing Week 24 value  (for participants whose 
postbaseline values are all missing, the participant’s baseline value will be used to impute 
the missing endpoint value) . Participant s who discontinue the treatment prematurely are 
encouraged to follow the planned clinical visits. For p articipants  who did not take the 
highly influential  prohibited medications and/or highly influential rescue medications, all 
data collected after treatme nt discontinuation will be used in the analysis. For these 
participants , missing data may still happen despi[INVESTIGATOR_611199]. For participants who discontinue study intervention 
due to lack of efficacy , all data collected after discontinuation will be used in the analysis,

For continuous endpoints, missing data due to lack of efficacy will be imputed using 
WOCF approach and missing data not due to lack of efficacy will be imputed using a 
multiple imputation method, which will use all participants except those who have taken 
the high ly influential  prohibited medications and/or highly influential rescue medications  
and excluding patients who discontinue due to lack of  efficacy . For binary endpoints, 
missing data will be considered as non -responder.  
In addition to the missing data handling approaches specified above, the reason and pattern 
of missing data will be carefully examined , and tippi[INVESTIGATOR_611201].  
• Multiplicity considerations  
A multiplicity hierarchical testing will be  proposed to control the overall Type -I error rate 
for testing the primary endpoint , selected patient -reported outcome  (s) (PRO ) and the  other  
key secondary endpoints. The study is considered positive when the primary endpoint 
achieves statistical significance. Detailed multiplicity adjustment procedure for the 
efficacy endpoints will b e described in the study SAP.  
• Planned database lock date  
A primary database lock will be performed when all randomized participants have 
completed their treatment phase. Final analyses in the clinical study report (CSR ) will be 
based on all data collected up to this database lock.  
The database  will be updated at the end of the study for all participants t o include the 
post-treatment follow -up information and updates for the events previously ongoing at t he 
time of the primary lock. Additional data between this database lock and last participant 
completing last visit will be summarized in a CSR addendum.

Chronic urticaria comprises CSU  and CIndU , and both are characterized by [CONTACT_611295] (hives) , angioedema, or both that reoccur  for more than 6 weeks. The symptoms 
occur either without a specific  trigger  in the case of CSU, or are induced (provoked) by a specifi c 
and d efinite  trigger in the case of CIndU ( 1, 2). There are 9 subtypes of CIndUs depending on the 
type of trigger tha t provokes urticaria  signs and symptoms : symptomatic dermographism, ColdU , 
DPU , solar urticaria, heat urticaria, vibratory angioedema, CholU , contact [CONTACT_22815] , and aquagenic 
urticaria. Most CIndU subtypes are rare and the most common are symptomatic dermo graphism, 
ColdU  (also called chronic inducible cold urticaria ) and CholU  (1). 
Chronic inducible ColdU  is the second most commo n form of physical urticaria  (1, 14). Cold 
urticaria is a relatively rare disorder with a reported prevalence of 0.05% as per one study in 
Europe ( 4), with a higher prevalence in  northern climates. It is also self -limited, lasting 4 to 
5 years on average ( 5). Chronic inducible ColdU  often develops in young adults and is diagnosed 
based on the patient history and the results of provocation testing. Systemic symptoms of mast 
cell activation may occur, and up to 35% to 70% of patients with chronic inducible ColdU  have 
experience d system ic reactions includi ng anaphylaxis in severe cases ( 4). 
Therapy is focused on  the avoidance of the trigger factor and symptomatic treatment. The 
consensus recommendations for CIndU mana gement (EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) ( 1) are 
mainly based on treatments approved for CSU, and some clin ical data available in patients 
suffering from various types of CIndUs (cholinergic, symptomatic dermographism, ColdU).  The 
recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920], in general, not approved for CIndU by [CONTACT_17513], with only 
limited specific countries where ant ihistamines are approved under broader “ urticarial”  
indications.  All patients are advised to avoid prolonged skin contact [CONTACT_611296], a similar stepwise approach as in patients with CSU is 
recommended: second -generation H1-antihistamines are the first -line (standard doses) and second 
line (high doses) therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], although there is a lack of good evidence in patients with CIndU for 
the latter recommendation. Approximately 50% of patients achieve symptomatic control with 
conventional H1 -antihistamine thera py, defined as reduction of hives and itch ( 15). Step [ADDRESS_810467] of the patients treated with 
omalizumab are not well -controlled ( 16). 
Chronic inducible ColdU  is debilitating and severely affects patients QoL. Avoidance of 
offending triggers poses massive changes to everyday life and therefore  is typi[INVESTIGATOR_611180]. 
Thus, the need for treatment options is high , especially as no approved treatments are available.  
The underlying pathologic mechanism, while not well understood, is thought to be driven by [CONTACT_611297].  Activation of skin mast cells with the release of histamine and 
other pro -inflammatory mediators leads to the signs and symptoms of CIndUs. Increased numbers 
of mast cells are found in both lesional and non -lesional skin in CSU and induci ble urticaria.

Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_24783] a human mAb  directed against the IL-4Rα, which is a component of IL -[ADDRESS_810470] immunosuppressants. The type 2/Th2 pathway is responsible for several 
pathophysiological mechanisms including mast cell and basophil degranulation. Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611209] [ADDRESS_810471] cells in CIndu is 
held to be mediated by [CONTACT_95962]εRI  activation, through cell surface -bound IgE cross -linked b y as of yet 
unidentified autoallergens. The subsequent release of histamine and other pr o-inflammatory 
mediators leads  to local tissue edema and pruritus. While antihistamines are the mainstay of 
therapy, not all patients are controlled with antihistamines  alone, and not all antihistamine -
refractory patients are adequately responsive to omalizumab (anti -IgE antibody) therapy. 
Therefore, there remains an unmet need. One possible way to meet this need is through novel

2.2 BACKGROUND   
Chronic inducible ColdU  is a debilitating condition that severely affects  QoL. It is normally  not 
feasible to avoid the offending  trigger without significant changes to everyday life. The majority 
of patients with chronic inducible ColdU  may experience systemic reactions, including  
anaphylaxis in severe cases. There is no approved treatment available to date for chronic inducible 
ColdU , and EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/WAO guidel ines treatment recommendations ( 2) are mainly  
based on the approved treatments for CSU . Many patients h owever are refractory to these 
treatments; therefore, a high unmet medical need exist.  
In the EFC16720 study the target population consists of patients with primary acquired chronic 
inducible ColdU  who remain symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_12847] H1-antihista mine as these 
patients have a significant unmet medical need. The updated international guideline on the 
definition, classification, diagnosis , and management of urticaria (1, 2) provides recommendations 
and a treatment algorithm. Steps 1 and 2 of this algorithm  is the use of non -sedating H1-
antihistamine s at approved, or increased doses (up to 4-fold), respectively. Step 3  and 4 of 
treatment options include omalizumab and ciclosporin A, respectively . This protocol allows the 
use of H1-antihistamine at up to 4 -fold the approved doses as background medication at stable 
doses.

Interleukin -4 is essential  for the function/survival of several cell types important in the 
pathogenesis of urticaria, including B cells, Th2 cells, mast cells, and basophils ( 12, 18, 19, 20, 
21, 22). It is hypothesized that dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611216] h and hives and improve

CSU, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611217]/frequency in a case series of 6 patients with 
CSU ( 12). Ferrucci et al reported ( 13) that a patient with chronic inducible ColdU who failed to 
respond to omalizumab (anti - IgE antibody) and oral cyclosporine, healed shortly after starting 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]. Itch (Numerical Rate Scal e) and QoL (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI ]) 
significantly improved in this patient after only [ADDRESS_810478] was negative. The patien t underwent cold -water exposure by [CONTACT_611298] a 
mountain river (water temperature 3°C), without showing any relapse of urticaria.  
The participants who will participate in this study may have the potential benefit of receiving a 
novel treatment for the unde rlying disease process. Based on the dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611218], it is anticipated that use of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611219].  
Treatments approved in CSU are antihistamines or omalizumab. In general, treatments for chronic 
inducible ColdU including omalizumab are given off label. Thirty -five percent to 70% of patien ts 
with chronic inducible ColdU have experienced systemic reactions including anaphylaxis in 
severe cases. Thus, the need for approved treatment options for chronic inducible ColdU is high 
(4). 
One possible way to meet this need is through novel therapi[INVESTIGATOR_611220] d function. Interleukin -4/IL-[ADDRESS_810479] cell

Based on clinical studies  in AD, the safety profile  in adolescent patients (ie, 12 –17 years of age) 
appears similar to that of adults with AD . As of 28 September 2019, 336 adolescents  had been 
exposed to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611222] , with a total of 457.7 person -years of exposure.  
Based on the sales figures and using the World Health Organization’s defined daily dose for 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_209371] 21.4 mg /day, the cumulative post -marketing exposure to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611223] 161 582 patient -years (01 January 2017 to 31 March 2020).  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611224] -tolerated in all populations tested in clinical development

and bacterial), oral herpes, herpes simplex, blepharitis,  keratitis,  dry eye, eye pruritus, 
eosinophilia, serum sickness , anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, and arthralgia . These ADRs 
were generally mild or moderate, transient, and manageable. These ADRs were not consistently 
observed in all  indications (see IB for greater  details). More significant serious allergic reactions 
were very rare. The ADRs reported in the post -marketing setting include events of anaphylactic 
reaction, angioedema, arthralgia, keratitis, and ulcerative keratitis. Importantly, no increased 
overall infection risk was observed in patients treated with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458].  
Systemic hypersensitivity has been established as an important identified risk with dupi[INVESTIGATOR_81222]. As

Primary acquired cold urticaria (ACU ) is a type of physical chronic inducible urticaria that is 
characterized mainly by [CONTACT_611300] (4). The assessments used in this study focus on evaluation of local 
symptoms that occur after skin contact [CONTACT_611301]. In addition, overall 
urticaria control, daily documentation of skin reactions to cold , participant’s QoL , reduction in 
need of rescue therapy and health status are evaluated.  
The proposed primary endpoint is proportion of participants  with negative ice cube provocation 
test (absence of a confluent hive/wheal at the entire skin site of expo sure) at Week  24.  Cold 
provocation tests are standard in diagnosis of cold urticaria (4). In addition, they are used for 
assessment of efficacy in clinical trials (23, 24) in patients with ColdU . Cold urticaria symptoms 
appear only after skin contact [CONTACT_4490] a cold trigger (cold air, liquids, or solid ob jects), usually within 
minutes , and persist for up to a few hours. The use of cold provocation tests allow s for the 
standardiz ation of the cold trigger and for perform ing assessment in predefined time points . The 
ice cube provocation test will be standardized for the purpose of th is study and an operational 
manual with instructions for ice  cube preparation and cold provocation test administration will be 
provided to the study centers  along with th e study  protocol . This will ensure that all study ce nters  
will apply the ice cube  provocation tests consistently across this international, multi -center  
clinical study . 
Presence of a confluent hive/wheal as well as wheal intensity will be assessed by [CONTACT_47656] 
10 minutes after removal of the ice cube, as recommended in the CIndU 
(EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) guidelines ( 1). Assessment will be performe d at each provocation 
test, ie,  at Week 0, Wee k 12, and Week 24. In addition, symptoms of itch  severity , skin burning 
sensation , and skin pain will be assessed by [CONTACT_2299]  [ADDRESS_810483] 
with the triggering temperature . Therefore, the participants  will rate the  disease activity using the 
ColdUAS questionnaire in an e-diary. On a daily basis, participants will report their skin reactions 
(wheals and swelling), skin sensations (itching, burning, pain or feeling hot), avoidance behavior 
and trigger exposure, and overall symptoms severity. Cold Urticaria Activity Score  will provide 
important supportive information on clinical improvement of the participants  on a daily basis.  
Since skin reactions, skin sensations and behavioral avoidance to trigger vary from one day to 
another , ColdUAS will be assessed on a daily basis . 
Participants  with primary inducible ColdU  are at risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_611234] s. Such systemic reactions are  
mainly described  as provoked by [CONTACT_611302] ( eg, swimming in cold w ater) when the whole 
body , or a large proportion  of it,  was in contact [CONTACT_611303]. Systemic hypersensitivity events will 
be documented via adverse event of special interest (AESI )/serious a dverse event (SAE ) 
reporting , and information about corrective treatment will be collected.

The EFC16720 stu dy is a 24-week , randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
multi -center study to evaluate the use of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611192] (≥12 to <18 years  
old) with primary acquired  chronic inducible ColdU  who remain symptomatic despi[INVESTIGATOR_611236] 
H1-antihistamine. Participants using H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily or as needed are eligible 
since both treatment regimens are common in patients with ColdU ( 5). The study is designed to 
test the hypothesis that dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611237] [ADDRESS_810485]  is 
defined as the absence of a confluent hive/wheal at the entire skin site of exposure  after an ice 
cube provocation test.  
The study consists of 3 periods:  
• Screening period (2 to 4 weeks).  
• Randomized IMP treatment period (24 weeks).  
• Post IMP treatment period (12 weeks).  
Chronic inducible ColdU  signs and symptoms will be evaluated after an ice cube provocation test , 
by [CONTACT_737]  (hives/wheals intensity) and participant  (itch severity, skin pain, skin 
sensation) . In addit ion, chronic inducible ColdU disease activity  will be assessed daily by [CONTACT_611304] e-diary  where the participant  will report his/her  
skin reactions (wheals and swelling), skin sensations (itching, burning, pain or feeling hot), if they 
have been in contact [CONTACT_611305], if they have avoided  
trigger exposure, and overall symptoms severity.  The study will also assess the effect  of 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611238], participants´ HRQoL and overall health status , proportion of 
patients with cold urticaria requiring emergency medical care visit or treatment with epi[INVESTIGATOR_611239] t herapy.  
The total anticipated number of participants randomized in the study is 78. This corresponds to 
approximately 39 participants who will be randomly assigned to each intervention arm:  
• Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458]: 300 mg every q2w for adults; 200 mg q2w for adolescents  ≥30 kg and  <60 kg 
at baseline or 300 mg q2w for adolescents ≥60 kg at baseline.  
• Matched placebo.  
At least 4  participants randomized  in the study will be adolescents (≥12 to <18 years  old) who 
will be recruited in a few selected sites in  selected countries . Randomization will be stratified by 
[CONTACT_654] (adolescent versus adult) and within adult group by [CONTACT_611291] H1 -antihistamine

• Participants who took H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study ent ry should limit the use 
to short -term. 
The H1 -antihistamine dose used during the study should be the same dose the participants took to 
prevent ColdU symptoms prior to study entry (“presc reening dose”). However, if participants  
experience a flare rescue th erapy may be initiated. Please refer to Section  6.5.1  for rescue therapy.  
If participants are on a dose higher than 4-fold the approved CSU dose at the screening visit 
(Visit  1), the Investigator can adjust the participant’s dose within the stipu lated range at the 
screening visit (Visit  1).  
All participants will be allowed to take study -defined H1-antihistamine as rescue therapy as long 
as they do not exceed 4 -fold the approved CSU dose during screening, treatment, and follow -up 
periods. If sympt oms are still uncontrolled after increase of H1 -antihistamine to the maximum 
allowed dose, or if the participant  is already on the 4-fold approved dose of H1-antihistamine, 
participants can switch to another antihistamine up to 4 -fold (2-fold in Japan)  the approved  dose 
for CSU  or a short course of oral corticosteroids (OCS ) is allowed during the treatment and 
follow -up periods.  For rescue therapy in  participants in Japan, please  see Appendix  8

avoidance of the trigger factor and symptomatic treatm ent. The updated international guideline on 
the definition, classification, diagnosis and management of urticaria ( 1, 2) provides 
recommendations and a treatment algorithm. The consensus recommendations for CIndU 
management are mainly based on treatments approved for CSU, and some c linical data available

ColdU).  The recommended therapi[INVESTIGATOR_22920], in general, not approved for CIndU by [CONTACT_174275], with only limited specific countries where antihistamines are approved under broader 
“urticaria” indications.  A similar stepwise approach as in patients with CSU is recommended for 
CIndU, including ColdU. Steps 1 and 2 of this algorit hm is the use of non -sedating 
H1-antihistamines at approv ed, or i ncreased doses (up to 4 -fold), respectively. Step 3 and 4 of 
treatment options include omalizumab and ciclosporin A, respectively. More than 50% of

in antihistamine -resistant patients with CIndU including ColdU. However, approximately a third 
of the patients treated with omalizumab are not well -controlled ( 12). 
Study EFC16720 targets patients not adequately controlled with H1 -antihistamine treatment and 
allows the use of H1 -antihistamine at up to [ADDRESS_810489] been observed to

There are  a limited number of studies conducted in patients with cold urticaria. As mentioned 
above , the guideline recommendations for CSU are adopted for patients with CIndU ; however , 
there are several differences between CSU and CIndU. In CIndU, the symptoms only occur after 
skin exposure to physical or chemical triggers. The duration of individual wheals is often 
relatively brief for CIndU, lasting minutes to hours. This is the reaso n why different assessment 
tools and endpoints are used in CIndU clinical  studies  compared with CSU. C old provocation 
tests are used in clinical studies in patients with chronic urticaria to evaluate efficacy of 
treatments, mainly antihistami ne treatments,  but also doxepin , cyproheptadine  (4), either by 
[CONTACT_611306]/symptoms with the  
cold provocation test or evaluating the response to an experimental cold -simulation time test 
(CSTT ) ie, minimum time threshold of cold stimulation required to induce a coalescent wheal and 
other  cold urticaria signs and symptoms.  This study will assess efficacy using the primary 
endpoint of the proportion of participants with negative ice cube provocation test  at Week  24. The 
patients/I nvestigators will also score local signs and symptoms before and after provocation test 
assessing effect of the IMP on hives, itch, burning sensation , and pain. Ice cube provocation test is 
a traditional test used in common practice. For the study, the method will be standardized and 
compliant with according to the International EAACI/GA2LEN/EDF/UNEV guidelines ( 1). In 
addition to provocation test,  cold urticaria signs and symptoms will be evaluated usin g ColdUAS. 
It is scored by [CONTACT_611307].  
A large portion of patients with ColdU (35% to 70%) have experience d systemic reactions 
including anaphylaxis, after extensive cold exposur e and exercise, respectively ( 4). Avoidance of 
offending triggers poses massive changes to everyday life and therefore is typi[INVESTIGATOR_611180].

Based on the known PK, safety and efficacy of dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], the selected dosing regimen is 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg q2w with a loading dose of 600 mg for adults; and 300 mg  q2w with a loading 
dose of 600 mg for adolescents ≥60 kg OR 200 mg q2w with a loading dose of 400  mg for 
adolescent s ≥30 kg and  <60 kg. These are the approved dose regimens for AD, another skin 
disease and they are expected to achieve concentrations in serum that saturate the IL -4/IL-[ADDRESS_810491] patients and hence they are expected to provide the maximum benefi t and 
therefore to achieve the optimal benefit/risk ratio in this patient population. Organ perfusion is 
anticipated to be similar between AD and primary acquired chronic inducible cold urticaria  and

Storage and Handling  
1. The Investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained during transit for all IMP received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved 
before use of the study intervention.  
2. Only participants randomized  in the study may receive IMP and only authorized  study center  
staff may supply or administer IMP. At study center, a ll IMP must be stored in a secure, 
environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in acco rdance with the 
labeled storage conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized  study center  
staff.  
3. The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability, reconcilia tion, and record maintenance ( ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records).  
Responsibilities  
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP  (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expi[INVESTIGATOR_106414] e, etc) must be promptly notified to the Sponsor. 
Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure (see  Section  8.3.8 ). 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by [CONTACT_429]. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by [CONTACT_1034], in order to recall the IMP and elimin ate potential hazards.  
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for 
direct -to-patient [DTP ]shipment, for which a courier company has been approved by [CONTACT_429]), allow the IMP  to be used other than as directed by [CONTACT_611312], or

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidentia l Page 55 6.3 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE  BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  AND BLINDING   
All participants will be centrally assigned to randomized IMP using an interactive response 
technology ( IRT). The Investigator will be questioned during  the interactive voice response 
system (IV RS) phone call/interactive web response system (IWRS ) web module if he/ she wishes 
to enroll the participant  in the study . Befo re the study is initiated, the telephone number and call -
in directions for the IVRS and/or the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be 
provided to each site.  
At the screening visit (Visit 1), the Investigator or designee will contact [CONTACT_611313]. If a  participant  who had previously failed screening is approached for 
rescreening, a new ICF must be signed. In such case, a new  participant  number will be assigned 
by [CONTACT_12067].  
Methods of assigni ng participants  to treatment group  
The randomized intervention kit number list is generated centrally by [CONTACT_209472] 
(dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg, dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 200 mg, or their matching placebo) are packaged in accordance 
with this list. The randomization and intervention allocation ar e performed centrally by [CONTACT_209473]. 
The IRT generates the participant randomization list and allocates the intervention number and the 
corresponding intervention kits to the participants according to it.  
Participants  will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio treatmen t arm as described in the  Table  3. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (adolescent versus adult) and within adult group by 
[CONTACT_611291] H1 -antihistamine  regular/daily  use (Yes /No) (see Section  6.1.2  for 
additional background therapy details) . 
Number of participants using H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study entry should be at least 
. At screening (Visit 1), the Investigator or des ignee will contact [CONTACT_611314]. If a  participant  who had previously failed  screening is approached for 
re-screening, a new ICF must be signed. In such case, a  new participant  number will be assigned 
by [CONTACT_12067].  
A randomized  participant is defined as a participant who has been allocated to a randomized 
intervention regardless of whether the treatment was administered or not (ie. participant registered 
by [CONTACT_6606]). A participant cannot be randomized more than once in the study . 
Study intervention will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in schedule of activities (SoA ) 
(Section  1.3). Returned study intervention should not be re -dispensed to the participants.  
Methods of blinding  
Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg/200 mg and placebo matching dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] 300 mg/200 mg will be provided in 
identically matched 2 mL/1.[ADDRESS_810507] this study is

Code breaking  
The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s intervention 
assignment is warranted (eg, in case of availabl e antidote). Participant safety must always be the 
first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unblinding is 
warranted, he/she may, at his/her discretion, contact [CONTACT_611315] a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment of 
the participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, the Sponsor must be 
notified within [ADDRESS_810508] be recorded in the source documentation and the electronic case report form (eCRF ), as 
applicable.  
If the code is broken, the participant must withdraw from IMP a dministration.  
6.4 STUDY INTERVENTION C OMPLIANCE   
• The Investigator or his/her delegate must ensure that IMP is administered to each 
participant according to the labeling instructions.  
• Investigational medicinal product  accountability:  
- Investigational medicinal product  units are returned by [CONTACT_21439]. In 
case of DTP process, the intervention units can be returned by [CONTACT_21440] (if defined in 
the contract).  
- The Invest igator or his/her delegate counts the number of remaining kits/pre -filled 
syringes and fills in the Intervention Log Form.  
- The Investigator or his/her delegate records the dosing information on the appropriate 
pages of the  eCRF . 
- The monitor in charge of th e study then checks the eCRF data by [CONTACT_21441]/she has retrieved and intervention log forms /source documents.  
- A paper diary will be dispensed to the participants for indicating  IMP administration at 
home.  
When participants are do sed at the study center , they will receive study intervention directly from 
the Investigator or design ee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose 
administered in the clinic will be recorded in the source documents and recorded in the eCRF . The 
dose of study intervention and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of 
dosing by a member of the study  center  staff other than the person adminis tering the study 
intervention.  
When participants self -administer study interven tion(s) at home, compliance with study 
intervention will be assessed at each visit.  Compliance will be assessed by  [CONTACT_611316]-CLIN-0635063 1.0

6.5.1  Rescue medicine   
All participant s will be allowed to take study -defined  H1-antihistamine  (see Section  6.1.2 ) as 
rescue therapy as long as they do not exceed 4 -fold the approved dose for CSU  during the 
screening, treatment, and follow -up periods. If symptoms are still uncontrolled after increase of 
H1-antihistamine to the maximum allowed dose, or if the participant  is already on the 4-fold  
approved H1-antihistamine , participants can switch to another antihistamine up to 4 -fold the 
approved  dose for CSU or a short course of OCS is allowed during the treatment and follow -up 
periods. In order to ensure consistency, when possible, it is recommended to use OCS for 5 to 
7 days with a starting dose of oral prednisone 40  mg (or clinically comparable OCS) followed by 
[CONTACT_209477]’s judgment.  
Due to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_611251] , it is recommended to prescribe rescue therapy for a short 
period of time (not more than 7 days).  
The ice cube provocation test should be delayed  if rescue therapy (H1 -antihistamine or OCS) is

In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant  to permanently discontinue  study 
intervention . If study intervention is permanently  discontinued, the participant should complete 
the early treatment discontinuation visit with all assessments pla nned for the end of treatment 
(EOT ) Visit . See the S oA (Section  1.3) for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of 
study intervention . 
The participants may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if he or she decides to do so, at any 
time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision. All efforts should 
be made to document the reason(s) for treatment discontinuation , and this should be documented 
in the eCRF.  
Participants must be permanently withdrawn from the study treatment for the following reasons:  
• At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized und er 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospective participant to the patient’s 
participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research).

waivers or exemptions are not allowed.  
• Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA  
(Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that p otential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The Investigator  will maintain a screening log to 
record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as pa rt of the participant’s routine clinical management (eg, blood 
count)  and obtained before signing of the ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline 
purposes provided the procedures met the protocol -specified criteria and were performed 
within the  time f rame defined in the SoA  (Section  1.3). 
• It is recommended that a ssessments/procedures at a study center visit are performed in the

questionnaire [EQ -5D-5L]) should be completed by [CONTACT_611323]/or clinical tests, in a quiet place. The questionnaires should be 
completed by t he participants themselves, independently from their physician, the 
study nurse, or any other medical personnel and without any help from friends or 
relatives.  
- ECG (at screening), physical examination including vital signs, safety and laboratory 
assessment . 
- Ice cube provocation test . 
- Investigator /participant  evaluation of urticaria symptoms at the provocation test site 
will be performed 10 minu tes after ice cube removal . The Investigator will do his/her 
assessment first (the presence/absence of a confluent hive/wheal at the entire skin site 
of exposure [primary endpoint] and wheal  intensity Likert scale ). Then the participant 
will rate p eak pruritus Numerical Rating Scale  (NRS ), peak burning sensation N RS, 
peak pain se nsation NRS and will answer the Patient Global Impression of Severity 
(PGIS ) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC ). It is important that the 
Investigator does not give any details of the evaluation to the participant, so his/her 
scoring and answers are not influenced by [CONTACT_737]’s assessment.  
• Adolescents complet e the same PRO questionnaires as adults , except for the CDLQI 
(version adapted to adolescents) . They  may be helped by [CONTACT_107605]/caregivers for the 
reading and the understanding of the instructions, a word or a question of the 
questionnaires if they encounter difficul ties to answer. However, adolescents should 
answer the question themselves; parents/caregivers should not influence nor interpret their 
child's answer; parents/caregivers should not select any of the response choices on behalf 
of their child.

require implementation of temporary or alternative mechanisms , eg, phone contact, virtual visits, 
online meetings, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by [CONTACT_25011]. 
Implementation of such mechanisms may differ country by [CONTACT_1606], depending on country 
regulations and local business continu ity plans. Additionally, no waivers to deviate from protocol 
enrollment criteria due to COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) will be granted. All temporary 
mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned study procedures are to be documented as 
being related to COVID -19 (or any other pandemic) and will remain in effect only for  the duration 
of the public health emergency.  For a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental

antihistami ne treatments, but also doxepin , cyproheptadine  (7, 24), either by [CONTACT_611326]/symptoms with the cold 
provocation test or evaluating the response to  an experimental CSTT,  ie, minimum time threshold 
of cold stimulation required to induce a coalescent wheal and other ColdU  signs and symptoms.  
The ice cube provocation test is the most frequently used provocation method for ColdU  in 
routine clinical practice and is therefore propo sed for the  present clinical study.  
The consensus recommendations for  CIndU (EAACI/GA²LEN/EDF/UNEV) ( 1) defines the 
following for provocation methods for ColdU :  
• Provocation tests should be performed by [CONTACT_2931] a cold stimulus to forearm skin . 
• Cold provocation testing should be performed for 5 minutes on volar for earm. 
• Ice cube should be melting within a thin plastic bag to avoid cold damage of the skin and 
to prevent direct water contact [CONTACT_611327].  
• Reading time [ADDRESS_810517] is defined as the absence of a confluent 
hive/wheal at the enti re skin site of exposure after i ce cube provocation test . The assessment  will 
be done by [CONTACT_737] [ADDRESS_810518] room temperature and outdoor temperature should be

The Wheal  intensity Likert scale (ranging from 0 to 5) is a clinician -reported outcome measure  
comprised of a single item assessing the intensity of patients’ cutaneo us reaction rated as follows: 
0=no wheals; 1= numerous  small, noncoalescent wheals; 2= a large, regular, slightly  edematous, 
coalescent wheal; 3= a large and moderately edematou s wheal; 4= a large, regular, and 
significantly edematous wheal witho ut pseudopodia; and 5 =a large, very edematous wheal with 
pseudopodia  (28, 29). 
Investigators  will complete the scale at the study visit, 10 minutes after removal of the ice cube 
from the participant’s arm . Investigators will complete t he wheal  intensity Likert scale in eCRF as 
described  in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
8.1.3  Peak pruritus numerical rating scale (NRS), peak pain NRS, and peak burning 
sensation NRS   
Participants will undergo a temperature provocation test using ice cube at study visits at study 
center. Ten minutes after the removal of the ice cube from their arm, p articipants  will be asked to 
rate the severity of local itch, pain, and burning sensation at the prov ocation site skin  using a 
NRS.  
The peak pruritus NRS is a PRO comprised of a single item rated on a scale from 0 (“No itch”) to 
10 (“Worst itch imaginable”). Participants will be asked to rate the intensity of their worst local 
site pruritus (itch) 10 minu tes after removal of the ice cube . The 24 -hour version  of the scale  has 
been developed, tested and validated with patients with AD; a threshold value of 4 has been 
determined as a meaningful within -person change in score in adults and adolescent patients w ith 
AD (30). 
The peak pain NRS is a PRO comprised of a single item ra ted on a scale from 0  (“No pain ”) to 10 
(“Worst imaginable pain”). Participants will be asked to rate the intensity of their worst local site 
pain 10 minutes  after removal of the ice cube.  
The peak burning sensation NRS is a PRO comprised of a single item rated on a scale from 
0 (“No burning sensation”) to 10 (“Worst imag inable burning sensation”). Participants will be 
asked to rate the intensity of the worst local site burning sensation of their skin 10 minutes after 
the removal of the ice cube . 
Participants  will complete the NRS as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.[ADDRESS_810519] (UCT) [ADDRESS_810520]  is a PRO questionnaire for assessing urticaria control. The questionnaire has been

The minimal important difference (MID ) of the UCT is determined to be 3 ( 31). 
Participants will complete the UCT as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.5  Cold Urticaria Activity Score   
The ColdUAS is a disease -specific PRO questionnaire  designed to determine cold urticaria 
disease activity. ColdUAS is intended for patients with cold urticaria aged 12 years old and above; 
it has been developed and comprehensively tested with adults and adolescent patients with co ld 
urticaria.  Disease activity assessment is based on the daily documentation of cold-induced skin 
reactions (wheals and  swelling), skin sensations (itching, burning, pain or feeling hot), avoidance 
behavior and trigger exposure, and overall symptoms sever ity. Skin reaction, skin sensations, 
exposition to cold temperatures that usually cause ColdU  symptoms and overall symptom severity 
are rated on a 4 -point scale from 0 (“No”) to 4 (“Yes, severe”); avoidance of cold temperatures 
that usually lead to ColdU  symptoms are answered using responses “No”, “Yes partially 
avoided”, “Yes completely avoided”.  
After each week of completion, p articipants  will be asked [ADDRESS_810522] week using a 4 -point Likert scale from “No disease 
activity” to “High disease activity”  and [ADDRESS_810523]

Participants  will complete the ColdUAS as described in th e SoA ( Section  1.3). 
8.1.6  Dermatology Life Quality Index and Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index   
The DLQI is a PRO developed to measure dermatology -specif ic HRQoL in adult participants 
(26). The instrument  comprises [ADDRESS_810524] of skin disease on participant’s  
HRQoL over the previous week. The items cover symptoms, leisure activities, work/school or 
holiday time, personal relationships including intimate, the side effects of treatment, and 
emotional reactions to having a skin disease. It is a validated question naire used in clinica l 
practice and clinical trials ( 32). The r esponse scale is a 4 -point Likert scale (0  = “Not at all” and 
3 = “Very much”)  for 9  items. The remaining 1 item about work/studying asks whether 
work/study has been prevented and then (if “No”) to what degree the skin condition has been a 
problem at work/study; the item is rated on a 3 -point Likert scale ( “Not at  all” to “A lot”). Overall 
scoring ranges from 0 to 30, with a high score indicative of a poor HRQoL. Using an integrated 
analysis of distribution and anchor -based approaches using the change in DLQI total score and 
participant -assessed itch severity scores, the MID for the DLQI in participants with chronic 
idiopathic urticaria was reported to be in th e range of 2.24 to 3.10 points ( 33). So far , there is  no 
MID value determined for chronic inducible ColdU  patients.  
The CDLQI  is a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin disease on 
children’s HRQoL ( 34). Participants  provide responses to 10  questions (symptoms feelings 
associated with disease, the impact of the disease on leisure, school or holidays, personal

The PGIS  is a 1 -item questionnaire that asks participants to provide the overall self -assessment of 
their chronic inducible ColdU  current severity on a 4 -point  scale. Response choices are: 
1=“None”, 2= “Mild”, 3=“Moderate”, 4= “Severe”.  
Participants  will complete the 2 items  after having answered the peak pruritus NRS, pain NRS, 
and skin burning sensation NRS  as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.9  Acquired  Cold Urticaria Severity Index   
The Acquired Cold Urticaria Severity Index (ACUSI ) is a measure  designed to evaluate the 
severity o f the ACU  signs/symptoms ( 35). It is composed of 4 questions regarding the severity of 
ACU : 1) worst problems ever caused by [CONTACT_611328]; 2) season during which problems with 
outdoor activities occur because it w as too cold; 3) maximum treatment needed; 4) frequency of 
complains. Questions 1, 3, and 4 are attributed 1 to 4 points, and question 3 is attributed 1 to 
3 points, thus resulting in a score ranging from 4 to 15. Scores of 4 to 7, 8 to 11, and 12 to

8.1.10  EuroQol -5 Dimensions questionnaire   
The EuroQol -5 dimensions (EQ -5D) is a standardized PRO measure of health status developed by 
[CONTACT_157502] a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and 
economic appraisal. The EQ -5D consists of 2 parts: the descriptive system and the EuroQol visual 
analog ue scale (EQ -VAS ). The EQ -5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 
5 dimensions: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each 
dimension has 5 l evels of perceived problems: “no problem”, “slight problems”, “moderate 
problems”, “severe problems”, and “ extreme  problems” ( 36). The respond ent is asked to indicate 
his/her health state by [CONTACT_13158] (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate 
statement in each of the 5  dimensions; this results in a 1 -digit number expressing the level for that 
dimension. The digits for 5  dimensio ns can be combined in a 5 -digit number describing the 
respondent’s health state. The EQ -VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, 
visual analogue scale  where the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health state (100)” and 
“worst imag inable health state (0)”. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of 
health outcome as judged by [CONTACT_112775].  
The recall period is “today”.  
Participants  will complete the questionnaire as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.1.11  Health care resource utilization/ productivity   
A questionnaire on health care resource utilization and productiv ity (missed days of school [12 to 
17 years old]/workdays [18 and above]) will be collected by [CONTACT_611329].  
Participants  will complete the questionnaire as described in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.2 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidentia l Page 71 • Any new findi ng or worsening of previous finding should be reported as a new AE. 
8.2.2  Vital signs   
• Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supi[INVESTIGATOR_209343] [ADDRESS_810528] and 
will in clude axillary  or oral  temperature  (same method of temperature measurement 
should be used during the course of the study) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and 
pulse and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be assessed 
using  the same arm with a completely automated device. Manual techniques will be used 
only if an automated device is not available.  
• Body weight (kg) will be measured at screening (Visit 1) and at EOT/EOS Visits. Height 
will be measured at screening visit (Visit  1). Height and weight should be measured with 
indoor clothing but without shoes.  
8.2.3  Electrocardiograms   
• A single standard 12 -lead ECG will be obtained at the screening  visit (Visit 1) as outlined 
in the SoA ( Section  1.3) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate 
and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. The ECG should be recorded after 
[ADDRESS_810529] in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  The ECG will be read locally  and results reported 
in the e CRF. In ca se of a clinically significant finding the  Investigator should assess if it 
impacts a participant’s  eligibility and document this in the medical records. An AE should 
be reported if appropriate.  
8.2.4  Clinical safety laboratory assessments   
• See Appendix  2 (Section  10.2) for the list of clinical laboratory tests including pregnancy 
testing to be performed and to the SoA  (Section  1.3) for the timing  and frequency.  
• The Investigator  must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying 
disease.  
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline 
or are no longer considered clinically significant by [CONTACT_737] . 
• If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable 
by [CONTACT_737] , the etiology should be identified and  the Sponsor  notified.  
• All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in  Appendix  2 (Section  10.2), 
must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA  (Section  1.3). 
• If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are considered 
clinically significant by [CONTACT_737]  (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the 
results must be recorded in the eCRF.

The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in  Appendix 3 ( Section  10.3). 
An AE will be reported by [CONTACT_2299] (or, when appropriate, by a car egiver, parent, surrogate, 
or the participant ’s legally authorized representative).  
The Investigator  and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following 
up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study intervention or study procedures, or that 
caused th e participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section  7). 
8.3.1  Time period and frequency for collecting AE and SAE information   
All AEs, serious or nonserious,  will be collected from the signing of the ICF  until the EOS Visit at 
the time points specified in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
All SAEs and AESIs  will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor  or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE /AESI  data to the Sponsor  within 24  hours of it 
being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE s or SAE s after conclusion of study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after 
a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reas onably 
related to the study intervention or study participation, the Investigator must promptly notify the 
Sponsor.  
8.3.2  Method of detecting AEs and SAEs   
The method of recording, eval uating, and assessing causality of AE s and SAE s and the procedures 
for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3). 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrences.  
8.3.3  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs   
After the initial AE/ AESI/ SAE report, the Investigator  is required to proactively follow each 
participant at subsequent visits/contacts. At the  pre-specified study end date, a ll SAEs,  and 
non-serious AESIs  (as defined in  Section  8.3), will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the 
event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section  7.3). 
Further information on follow -up procedures is provided  in Appendix  3 (Section  10.3).

RECORDING, EVALUATIN G, FOLLOW -UP, AND RE PORTING   
10.3.1  Definition of AE  
AE definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of study intervention , whether or not considered related 
to the study intervention . 
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and uni ntended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention . 
Events meeting  the AE definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistr y, or urinalysis) or 
other safety assessments ( eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), 
including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical 
and scientific judgment of the Investigator ( ie, not related to progression of underlying 
disease) . 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention  administratio n even though 
it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention  or a concom itant medication.  
• "Lack of efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not be 
reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. 
However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy 
will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or SAE.  
• The signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be 
reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil l the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, "lack of 
efficacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" also constitutes an AE or SAE.  
Events NOT meeting the AE definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by [CONTACT_21501]’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease/di sorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s 
condition.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidentia l Page 97 • Medical or surgical procedure ( eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to 
the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did  not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]).  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or 
detected at the start of the study that do not worsen . 
10.3.2  Definition  of SAE  
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions 
are met ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1080]/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to 
progression of disease).  
A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose:  
a) Results in death  
b) Is life -threatening  
The term “life-threatening ” in the definition of “serious ” refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of  the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c) Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12993], hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611263] b een detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_12332]/or treatment  that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospi[INVESTIGATOR_325716]. If a 
complication prolongs hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9236], the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]” occurred or was necessary, the AE 
should be considered serious.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_149519] e treatment  of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from 
baseline is not considered an AE.  
d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
- The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
- This d efinition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma ( eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent 
everyday life fu nctions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidentia l Page 98 f) Other situations:  
- Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting 
is appropriate in other situations such as important medical  events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_611264] 1  of the other 
outcomes listed in the above definition. These events sh ould usually be considered 
serious.  
- Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a 
guideline for determining which condition has to be considered as a medically 
important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive:  
- Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for:  
- Allergic bronchospasm  
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow 
aplasia, myelodysplasia, pancytopenia, etc)  
- Convulsions (seizures, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002], epi[INVESTIGATOR_12995], absence, etc).  
- Development of drug dependence or drug abuse  
- ALT >3 × ULN + total bilirubin >2 × ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase 
>10 × ULN  
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality  
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of 
blood s ampling)  
- Bullous cutaneous eruptions  
- Cancers diagnosed during the study  
- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases diagnosed during the study . 
10.3.3  Recording and foll ow-up of AE and/or SAE   
AE and SAE recording  
• When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator  to review all  
documentation ( eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1088], laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The Investigator  will then record all rele vant AE/SAE information in the eCRF.  
• It is not acceptable for the Investigator  to send photocopi[INVESTIGATOR_10914]’s medical 
records to Sponsor’s representative  in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE CRF page.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidentia l Page 99 • The Invest igator  will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the 
individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of intensity  
The Invest igator  will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study and assign it to 1 of the following cat egories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_2299], causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyd ay activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday 
activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as 
severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a c ategory utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as “serious ” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described 
in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Assessment of causality  
• The Investigator  is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention  and 
each occurrence o f each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or 
arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
• The Investigator  will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk 
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention  
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The Investigator  will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed 
products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the Investigator  must  document in the medical notes that he/she has 
reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.  
• There ma y be situations in which an SAE has oc curred and the Investigator  has minimal 
information to include in the initial report to  the Sponsor’s representative . However, it is 
very important that the Investigator  always make an assessment of causality for 
every  event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to  the Sponsor  
• The Investigator  may change his/her opi[INVESTIGATOR_9242] -up information 
and send a SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment.  
• The causality assessment  is 1 of the criteria used when determining r egulatory reporting 
requirements.

• The Investigator  is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as reques ted by  [CONTACT_48018]/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may 
include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or 
consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up 
period, the Investigator  will provide the Sponsor  with a copy of any post -mortem findings 
including histopathology , if available.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF.  
• The Investigator  will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
10.3.4  Reporting  of SAEs  
SAE re porting to  the Sponsor  via an electronic data collection tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to  the Sponsor  will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the study center will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section)  in order to report the event within 24 hours . 
• The study center  will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.

INFORMATION   
DEFINITIONS : 
Woman of childbearing potential (WO CBP)  
A woman is considered fertile following m enarche and until becoming post menopausal unless 
permanently sterile (see below).  
If fertility is unclear ( eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be 
confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered.  
Women in the following cat egories are not considered WOCBP  
1. Premenarchal  
2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:  
- Documented hysterectomy  
- Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656]  
- Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above,  (eg, mullerian agenesis, androg en insensitivity), I nvestigator discretion 
should be applied to determining study entry.  
Note: Documentation can come from the  study center’s personnel : review of the 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
3. Postmenopausal female  
- A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 consecutive months without  an 
alternative medical cause.  
- Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT )and whose menopausal status is in 
doubt will be required to use one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective 
contra ception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study

Male participants with partners who become pr egnant  
• The Investigator  will attempt to collect pr egnancy information on any male participant’s 
female partner who becomes pr egnant while the male participant is in this study. This 
applies only to male participants who receive  study intervention . 
• After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pr egnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator  will record pr egnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor  within  24 hours  of learning of the partner’s pr egnancy. The 
female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pr egnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor . 
Generally, the follow -up will be no longer than 6 to 8  weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any ter mination of the pr egnancy will be reported r egardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
Female participants who become pr egnant  
• The Investigator  will collect pr egnancy information on any female participant  who 
becomes pr egnant while participating in this study. The initial information  will be 
recorded on the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor  within  24 hours  of learning 
of a participant ’s pregnancy.  
• The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pr egnancy. The 
Investigator  will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor . Generally, follow -up will not be required 
for longer than [ADDRESS_810553] imated delivery date. Any termination of 
pregnancy will be reported, r egardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or 
indication for the procedure.  
• Any pr egnancy complication or elective termination of a pr egnancy  for medical reasons  
will b e reported as an AE or SAE.  
• A spontaneous abortion  (occurring at <22 weeks gestational age) or still birth (occurring at 
>22 weeks gestational age)  is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as 
such.  
• Any post -study pr egnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention  by [CONTACT_594911]  8.3.4 . While the Investigator  is not obligated to actively seek this information in 
former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.  
• Any female participant who becomes pr egnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue the study intervention.

Use/Analysis of DNA and RNA  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant’s respo nse to study intervention, susceptibility 
to, and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study intervention may be 
due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and 
excretion; safety, mechanism of act ion of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular 
subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulati ons and IRB/IEC 
allow,  blood sample s will be collected for DNA and RNA analysis from consenting 
participants.  
• Deoxyribonucleic acid (DN A) and RNA samples will be used for research related to 
dupi[INVESTIGATOR_611267]. They may also be used to develop tests/assays 
including diagnostic tests related to dupi[INVESTIGATOR_245614]/allergic 
diseases. Genetic research m ay consist of the analysis of 1 or more candidate genes or the 
analysis of genetic markers throughout the genome (including whole -exome sequencing, 
whole -genome sequencing, and DNA copy number varia tion). Transcriptome sequencing 
(or other methods for quan titating RNA expression) may also be performed. The samples 
may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in the 
response to study intervention or study interventions of this class to understand study 
disease or related co nditions.  
• The Sponsor will store the DNA and RNA samples in a secure storage space with 
adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  
• The samples will be retained while research on study intervention or study interventions of 
this class or indication conti nues but no longer than 15 years or other period as per local 
requirements.

In Japan, patients with chronic inducible ColdU  who are not we ll-controlled on approve d 
H1-antihistamine dose may escalate the H1 -antihistamine  dose only up to [ADDRESS_810562] of care background 
therapy with a long-acting non -sedat ing H1 -antihistamine, at up  to 2-fold the approved dose for 
CSU.  
• Participants who used H1 -antihistamine regularly/daily prior to study entry should 
continue to take it daily. Note: regular/daily use of H1 -antihistamine prior to study entry is 
defined as H1 -antihistamine intake for a t least [ADDRESS_810563] 1  month prior to 
screening visit (Visit 1)  
• Participants who took H1 -antihistamine as needed prior to study entry should limit the use 
to short -term. 
Rescue therapy  
All participants will be allowed to take  additional doses of their H1 -antihistamine  medications as 
rescue therapy as long as they do not exceed 2 -fold the approved dose during the screening, 
treatment, and follow -up periods. If symptoms are still un controlled after increase of 
H1-antihistamine t o the maximum allowed dose , or if the participant is already on the 2 -fold 
approved H1 -antihistamine, the participants can switch to another antihistamine up to 2 -fold 
approved dose  for CSU or a short course of OCS is allowed as rescue therapy during the t reatment 
and follow -up periods.  
Due to an epi[INVESTIGATOR_611251] , it is recommended to prescribe rescue therapy for a short 
period of time (not more than 7 days). In order to ensure consistency, when possible, it is 
recommended to use a short course of OC S for 5 to 7 days with a starting dose of oral prednisone 
40 mg (or clinically comparable OCS) followed by [CONTACT_209477]’s judgment . 
The ice cube provocation test should be delayed  if rescue therapy (H1 -antihistamine or OCS) is

intake for at least [ADDRESS_810565] perfo rmed under 
the same background condition for each participant from screening visit (Visit 1) to EOS (Visit  5). 
The initial background therapy should remain unchanged throughout the study . Participants 
should continue their prescreening  dose of initial H1 -antihistamine once rescue treatment is no 
longer required  or stop H1 -antihistamine intake .

EMERGENCY THAT IS DE CLARED BY A GOVERNME NTAL AGENCY   
Continuation of the study in the event of a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency : 
A regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency (eg, public health 
emergency, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorist attack) may prevent access to the clinical trial 
site. 
Contingency procedures are suggested for an emergency that prevents access to the study site, to 
ensure the safety of the participants, to consider continuity of the clinical study conduct, protect 
trial integrity, and assist in maintaining compliance with GCP  in Cond uct of Clinical Trials 
Guidance. Sponsor agreement MUST be obtained prior to the implementation of these procedures 
for the duration of the emergency.  
Study Intervention Administration  
The following contingencies may be implemented for the duration of the  emergency (after 
Sponsor agreement is obtained) to make clinical supplies available to the participant for the 
duration of the emergency:  
• In case of emergency (eg, natural disaster, pandemic, etc.), IMP may be supplied from the 
site to the participant vi a a Sponsor -approved courier company where allowed by [CONTACT_611343] (or parent/legally authorized representative).  
• When the participant has a study visit, the IMP will be administered following clinical 
procedures and bl ood collection. Participants should be monitored for at least 30 minutes. 
The monitoring period may be extended as pe r country specific or local study 
center -specific requirements.  
Temporary discontinuation/ rechallenge  
In addition, for a regional or natio nal emergency declared by a governmental agency, the 
temporary discontinuation will be allowed as defined in Section  7.1.2 . 
During a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, reinitiation of IMP 
can only occur once the Investigator has determined,  according to his/her best judg ment, that th e 
contribution of the IMP(s) to the occurrence of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13000] (eg. COVID -19) was unlikely.  
Study Assessments and Procedures  
Attempts should be made to perform all assessments in accordance with the approved protocol to 
the extent possible. In case t his is not possible due to a temporary disruption caused by [CONTACT_229595], focus should be given to assessments necessary to ensure the safety of participants 
and those important to preserving the main scientific value of the study. During  the emergency, if  
the site will be unable to adequately follow protocol mandated procedures, alternative treatment 
outside the clinical trial should be proposed, and

Property of the [COMPANY_011] group - strictly confidentia l Page 125 screening/enrollment/randomization/administration of study intervention may be temporarily 
delayed (see als o Section  5.5). 
In the event of a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, the 
continuity of clinical study conduct and oversight may require implementation of temporary or 
alternative mechanisms, such as phone contact, virtual visits, online meetings, extension of visit 
windows for on -site visits, use of local clinic or laboratory locations, and home visits by [CONTACT_73465]. The primary focus should be collection of safety information and provision of daily e -diary 
data collection for key efficacy assessments.  Implementation of such mechanisms may differ 
country by [CONTACT_1606], depending on country re gulations and local business continuity plans. 
Additionally, no waivers to deviate from protocol enrollment criteria due to COVID -19 (or any 
other pandemic) will be granted. All temporary mechanisms utilized, and deviations from planned 
study procedures ar e to be documented as being related to COVID -19 (or any other public health 
emergency) and will remain in effect only for the duration of the public health emergency. 
Contingencies implemented due to emergency will be documented.  
Statistical Consideration  
The impact of the regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency on study 
conduct will be summarized (eg, study discontinuation or discontinuation/delay/omission of the 
intervention due to the emergency). Data collected regarding the impa ct of the COVID -19 or 
other pandemics on the participants will be summarized (eg, discontinuation due to COVID -19). 
Any additional analyses and methods required to investigate the impact of COVID -19 or other 
events requiring public health emergency on the efficacy (eg, missing data due to COVID -19) and 
safety will be deta iled in the SAP . 
Informed Consent Process  
For a regional or national emergency declared by a governmental agency, contingency procedures 
may be implemented for the duration of the emergency . The participant or their legally authorized 
representative should be verbally informed prior to initiating any changes that are to be 
implemented for th e duration of the emergency (eg,  study visit delays/treatment extension, use of 
local laboratories).

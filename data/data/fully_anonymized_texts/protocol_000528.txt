Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_1245237] Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor.  Inhibition of FXa interrupts the 
intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascad e, inhibiting both thrombin formation and 
development of thrombi. The clinical development program for rivaroxaban is extensive, covering the 
prevention and treatment of multiple thrombosis -mediated conditions. Rivaroxaban is marketed under the 
trade name [CONTACT_495116]®and has been approved for multiple adult indications worldwide . As of 
September 2015, more than 60,000subjects have been treated with rivaroxaban in clinical trials (Phase 1 
through Phase 4), covering several indications, including the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism 
(VTE) in adults undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery, thetreatment of deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and the reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT 
and PE, and to reduce t he risk of stroke and systemic embolism in non -valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) .
XARELTO is also approved in the European Union (EU)for the prevention of atherothrombotic events 
(cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction ,or stroke) after an acute coronary syndrome in adults with 
elevated cardiac biomarkers.
OBJECTIVE SAND HYPOTHESIS
Primary Objective s
Part A
To characterize the single -and multiple -dose pharmacokinetics (PK) and PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) 
profiles after oral rivaroxaban therapy adminis tered to pediatric subjects [ADDRESS_1245238] completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrollment.
Part B
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban, administered twice daily (exposure matc hed to 
rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily in adults) compared toacetylsalicylic acid (ASA ), given once daily  
(approximately 5 mg/kg) for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric subjects [ADDRESS_1245239] completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrollment.
Secondary Objective s
Part A
To assess the safety and tolerability of rivaroxaban treatment.
Part B
To further characterize the PK and PK/PD profiles of rivaroxaban.

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017Hypothesis
Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) who underwent theFontan procedure will respond to FXa 
inhibition by [CONTACT_889500] a similar manner as seen in adults. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_889501][INVESTIGATOR_889476], which covered the entire rivaroxaban concentration in clinical studies ranging up to 
500ng/mL, and in which similar exposure -response relationships existed in healthy children and adults of 
different age groups (23 days to 23 months, 2 to 6 years, 7 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years, and adults).1,2
No statistical hypothesis testing is planned for this study.
OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a prospective , open -label, active -controlled, multicenter study designed to evaluate the PK and 
PK/PD profiles, safety ,and efficacy of rivaroxaban for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric subjects [ADDRESS_1245240] completed the Fontan procedure within 
4months prior to enrollment.
This study consists of 2 parts:
Part A: This is the 12-month, non -randomized, open -label part of the study ,which includes a 12 -day 
Initial PK, PD, and Safety Assessment Period .An internal Data Review Committee (DRC) will 
assess by [CONTACT_2006] [ADDRESS_1245241] continuing in the study to complete 
the planned 12months of open -label rivaroxaban therapy of Part A. Subjects in Part A will not 
participate in Part B.
Randomization in Part B of this study will begin once the cumulative data from the Initial PK, PD,
and Safety Assessment Period in Part A are deemed acceptable by [CONTACT_46864] (IDMC).
Part B:This is the randomized, open -label , active -controlled part of the study that will evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban compared to ASA for thromboprophylaxis for [ADDRESS_1245242] 
(phone contact ).Approxima tely10 pediatric subjects are planned to be enrolled in Part A.
Parental informed consent/child assent (as appropriate , typi[INVESTIGATOR_408955] ≥7 years or as defined by [CONTACT_13125] ) must be obtained prior to performing any study -specific procedures. The screening 
assessments will take place after the Fontan procedure and up to 21days before the first dose of 
rivaroxaban. During the screening period, baseline laboratory blood testing will be done and a 
transthoracic echocardiogram will be performed to rule out thrombosis. Laboratory parameters obtained 
as part of the post-surgery standard -of-care may be used for screening if they have been done within 
21days prior to receiving the first dose of rivaroxaban. The most recent post-Fontan clinical laboratory 
results will be used for screening if there are multiple laboratory results. Subjects who do not meet all of 
the enrollment criteria for the study may be rescreened [ADDRESS_1245243] number, 
undergo the informed consent process, and then restart a new screening phase.

12days (+9 days). Pharmacokinetic and PD samples will be collected on Day 1 and Day 4 (+2 days) of 
rivaroxaban administration. An internal DRC will assess before the subject returns forDay [ADDRESS_1245245] (phone contact) . Approximately 
90subjects who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned in a 
2:1ratio to receive rivaroxaban oral suspension andASA for 12 months .
Parental informed consent/child assent (as appropriate , typi[INVESTIGATOR_408955] ≥7 years or as defined by [CONTACT_13125]) must be obtained prior to performing any study -specific procedures. Subjects will undergo 
the same scree ning evaluations as in Part A. Eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized on Day [ADDRESS_1245246] meets all eligibility criteria prior to randomization. Pharmacokin eticand PD samples will be 
obtained on Day 1, Month 3,and Month 12for subjects randomized to rivaroxaban only. Safety and 
efficacy will be evaluated throughout the study for all subjects.
Early Study Medication Discontinuation
For subjects in Part A and Part B who prematurely discontinue study drug for any  reason, the Early Study 
Medication Discontinuation (ESMD) visit will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation. A 
Follow -Up Contact (phone contact) will be performed [ADDRESS_1245247] dose of study drug and 
at Month 12, the end of the planned treatment period .
Note: An exception are subjects who are enrolled after local reading of the Screening transthoracic 
echo cardiogram rules out thrombosis, and subsequently reported to have thrombosis after central reading  
by [CONTACT_889502]. These subjects will be withdrawn from 
the study when the result of the echocardiogram by [CONTACT_889503]. Subjects will 
be asked to return for the ESMD visit as soon as possible. They will not be required to have a repeat 
transthoracic echocardiogram as part of the ESMD. Subjects will go on to receive proper care according 
to the healthcare provider’s judgment. They will be contact[CONTACT_647474] e approximately 30 days (+/-
7days) after last dose of study drug (Follow -Up Contact). An ESMD Month 12 follow up visit will not be 
required.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Rivaroxaban: The rivaroxaban dose to be used in this study was determined via an adapted 
Physiologically -based Pharmacokinetic s(PBPK) modeling approach . Rivaroxaban will be administered 
twice daily in an open -label fashion as a 0.1% (1 mg/ml) oral suspension with target exposure ( area under 
the plasma concentration time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC 0-24]) at steady state matching to that of 
rivaroxaban 10mg total daily dose in adults (age-and body weight -adjusted dosing). Because children 
with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30mL/min/1.73 m2are excluded from the study, dose 
reduction for impaired renal function is not required. Rivaroxaban will be taken in the morning and in the 
evening (approximately 12 hours apart) and at approximately the sam e tim es each day as described in the 
study bookl et. Dose adjustment, due to increased body weight, will be made at Month 6(both Part A and 
Part B) .
ASA: Acetylsalicylic acid will be provided as 81-mg or 100-mg tablets according to local practice. 
Subjects randomized to ASA will receive approximately 5 mg/kg of ASA to a maximum of 1 whole tablet 
as a single daily dose as described in the study booklet . Tablets can be split in half, if necessary (eg,
children weighing ≤10kg),to meet the daily dose, and the dose must be documented . It is recommended 
that tablets are not split more than in half. Dose adjustments due to increased body weight will be made at 
Month [ADDRESS_1245253] clinical practice should be followed.

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017SAFETY EVALUATIONS/OUTCOMES
The primary safety outcome will be major bleeding even ts, as defined below. Clinically relevant 
non-major bleeding events and trivial (minimal) bleeding will be secondary safety outcomes.
The safety and tolerability of rivaroxaban will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_889505]. 
Bleeding events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_889506] (ISTH) recommendations .
Major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding and:
Associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more; or
Leading to a transfusion of the equivalent of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or whole 
blood in adults ; or
Occurring in a critical site: intracranial, intraspi[INVESTIGATOR_1304], intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, 
intramuscular with compartment syndrome, retroperitoneal; or
Contributing to death.
Clinically relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for major 
bleeding but associated with :
Medical intervention, or
Unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a physician, or
(Temporary) cessation of study treatment, or 
Discomfort for the subject such as pain, or 
Impairment of activities of daily life (such as loss of school days or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).
Trivial (minimal) bleeding is defined as any other overt bleeding event that does not meet criteria for 
clinically relevant non major bleeding.
EFFICACY EVALUATIONS/OUTCOMES
The primary efficacy outcome will be any thrombotic event (venous or arterial), defined as :
The appearance of a new thrombotic burden within the cardiovascular system on either routine 
surveillance or clinically indicated imaging, or
The occurrence of a clinical event known to be strongly associated with thrombus (such as 
cardioembolic stroke, pulmonary embolism).
Subjects who develop either a symptomatic or asymptomatic thrombotic event during the study must 
permanently discontinue the study drug. All available imaging results (eg, transthoracic or 
transesophageal echocardiograms, or MRI s), should be sent to the CIAC. After cessation of the study  
drug, it is at the investigator’s discretion to continue with other antithrombotic therapy .The investigator 
should document this therapy in the eCRF. Thrombotic events will not be reported as adverse events or 
serious adverse events, as they will be reported as efficacy outcomes.
Transthoracic echocardiograms will be centrally read by [CONTACT_889507]. All 
thrombotic events and the primary cause of any death will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_105812].

interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway  of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting both 
thrombin formation and development of thrombi. The clinical development program for 
rivaroxaban is extensive , covering the prevention and treatment of multiple thrombosis -mediated 
conditions through a joint collaboration agreement between Bayer HealthCare AG and Ortho 
McNeil Pharmaceuticals, Inc (now Janssen Research and Development, LLC). Rivaroxaba n has 
been approved in multiple indications worldwide under the trade name [CONTACT_690332]®. As of 
September 2015, more than 60,000subjects have been treated with rivaroxaban in clinical trials 
(Phase 1 through Phase 4), covering several indications, including the prophy laxis of venous 
thromboembolism (VTE) in adults undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery , the
treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary  embolism (PE) andthe reduction in 
the risk of recurrence of DVT and PE, and to reduce the risk of stroke and sy stemic embolism in 
non-valvular atrial fibrillation XAREL TO is also approved in the EU for the prevent ion of 
atherothrombotic events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction ,or stroke) after an acute 
coronary  syndrome in adults w ith elevated cardiac biomarkers . 
Rivaroxaban is currently being studied in pediatric subjects with VTE (see Section 1.1.4 , 
Physiology -Based Pharmacokinetics ). It has been well tolerated in a Phase 2 and Phase 3 study 
in pediatric subjects for the treatment and secondary  prevention of VTE ( studies ongoing ).
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding rivaroxaban , refer to 
the latest version of the Investigator's Brochure.14

1.1. Background
1.1.1. Pediatric Patient s with Single Ventricle Physiology  –The Fontan 
Procedure -Scope of the Problem 
The Fontan procedure has become the most common procedure performed for congenital heart 
disease (CHD) after the age of [ADDRESS_1245270] been established in North America 
(Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery  Database, STS-CHSDB), Europe 
(EACTS Congenital Database) and Australia and New Zealand (Fontan Registry ). Collectivel y, 
these registries reported about 1,460 Fontan procedures per year during 2007 to 2011 , which 
capture dthe majority  of the Fo ntan procedures performed in those regions.3,16,31
Thrombosis remains an important complication for patients with single ventricle physiology 
following the Fontan procedure; however, the true frequency  of thrombotic events is not well 
known.21,22Several studies have estimated that the prevalence of thrombosis events occurri ng 
post-Fontan procedure ranges from 17% to 33%, with a reported mortality  of 25% due to an

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_1245271] dose. Rivaroxaban is a low clearance drug (clearance is 
approximately 10L/h or 0.14 L/h/kg) and does not undergo any relevant first-pass metabolism. 
The terminal elimination half -life of rivaroxaban ranges from 5 to 9 hours in healthy  young male 
subjects and from 11 to 13 hours inhealth y elderly  subjects (aged 65 to 83 years). Due to the 
multiple elimination pathway s of rivaroxaban, there are few clinically  relevant drug-drug 
interactions. 
In drug-drug interaction studies evaluating the concomitant use with drugs that are combine d 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors, increases in rivaroxaban 
exposure were observed. Similar increases in pharmacod ynamic effects (ie, FXa inhibition and 
prothrombin time [PT] prolongation) were also observed. Significant increases in rivaroxaban 
exposure may  increase bleeding risk .
In a drug interaction study , coad ministration of rivaroxaban (20 -mg single dose with food) with a 
drug that is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_889477] 600 mg once 
daily) led to an approximate decrease of 50% and 22% in area under the plasma concentration 
curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), respectively. Similar decreases in PD 
effects were also observed. These decreases in exposure to rivaroxaban may d ecrease efficacy .
1.1.3. Efficacy  and Safety  Profile Based on Adult Clinical Studies
The efficacy  and safety  of rivaroxaban havebeen studied in several large clinical development 
programs for the prevention and treatment of multiple thrombosis -mediated conditio ns. 
The highlights of relevant studies are:
The pooled analysis of [ADDRESS_1245272] program involving 
12,729 subjects undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty  demonstrated that rivaroxaban given at 
a dose of 10 mg once daily  compared with enoxap arin given at a dose of 30 mg twice daily 
or 40mg once daily for 30 days significantl y reduced the risk of symptomatic VTE and 
mortality (0.8% absolute risk decrease) . Rivaroxaban increased the risk of bleeding slightl y 
compared with enoxaparin (0.2% abso lute risk increase in major bleeding events).
The ROCKET AF study  involving 14,264 patients with NVAF at high risk of stroke 
demonstrated that rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily (15 once daily  in subjects with an estimated 
glomerular filtration rate of 30 to 49 ml/min) compared with warfarin (target international 
normalized ratio [INR] 2.0 to 3.0) for a mean of 19 months was non inferior for the 
prevention of stroke or systemic embolism ( hazard ratio 0.88; 95% confidence interval : 0.74
to 1.03), with a significan t reduction in life -threatening, intracranial and fatal bleeding and a 
favorable effect on mortality , but more transfusions and hemoglobin decreases of >2 gm/dl .

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017The EINSTEIN VTE treatment studies involving 9,[ADDRESS_1245273] s with VTE demonstrated 
that rivar oxaban 15 mg twice daily  for 3 weeks followed by 20 mg once daily compared 
with initial low molecular -weight heparin (LMWH) followed by [CONTACT_406190] (INR 2.0 to 3.0) 
was associated with a similar or reduced risk of recurrent VTE with a similar or reduced rate 
of major bleeding during up to 12 months . Overall bleeding rates were similar with 
rivaroxaban compared to enoxaparin/ vitamin K antagonists (VKA ), and showed a clinicall y 
important reduction in major bleeding risk . 
Rivaroxaban has been studied for reduct ion of the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) 
events in patients with acute coronary  syndrome (ACS) (ST segment elevation myocardial 
infarction, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, or unstable angina) in 
combination with acety lsalicy lic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus a thienopy ridine 
(clopi[INVESTIGATOR_889478]) in the ATLAS program. The ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study 
randomized a total of 15,526 subjects and demonstrated that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg or 5 mg 
twice daily compared with placebo reduce d the risk of CV death, MI, or stroke by 16% in 
patients with a recent ACS, most of whom (92%) were also receiving dual antiplatelet 
therap y. The incidences of all categories of treatment -emergent bleeding were consistentl y 
higher in subjects treated with rivaroxaban compared with placebo. The higher rates of 
bleeding with rivaroxaban were expected, since in this study  rivaroxaban was compared to 
placebo on the background of standard antiplatelet therap y.
The MAGELLaN study  compared VTE proph ylaxis with oral rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily 
for 35 day s with enoxaparin 40 mg daily  for 10 day s in subjects who were hospi[INVESTIGATOR_80529] a 
medi cal illness. The MAGELLaN study  randomized 8,101 subjects and met both of its 
primary  efficacy  objectives (ie, for rivaroxaban versus enoxaparin/placebo noninferiority  at 
Day 10,and superiorit y at Day 35). Although bleeding rates in MAGELLaN were low 
overall, the incidences of clinically  relevant bleeding events were increased in rivaroxaban 
treated subjects compared to enoxapar in. 
In addition to bleeding, other adverse reactions associated with rivaroxaban include nausea, 
fever, kidney  and liver impairment, dyspepsia, allergic reactions including skin reactions, 
itching, rash, hives, swelling of face, lips, mouth, tongue, skin or throat, and cholestasis.
Postmarketing data gathered subsequentl y to the pi[INVESTIGATOR_889479] -risk assessment of rivaroxaban in the approved indications.

1.1.4. Physiology -Based Pharmacokinetics
The rivaroxaban doses that are being tested in the pediatric VTE treatment studies were derived 
using Physiologicall y-based Pharmacokinetic s(PBPK)modeling (ie, extrapolation of the known 
pharmacokinetic (PK)properties of the drug into the pediatric popu lation by [CONTACT_889511]).6,7The primary  goal for dosing is to achieve in pediatric patients 
an equivalent exposure (as measured by [CONTACT_12265]) to the 20 mg once daily dose regimen that has 
demonstrated effectiveness for treatment of VTE in adults. The term ‘equivale nt exposure’ is 
used to indicate the achievement of a similar area under the plasma concentration curve from

pediatric doses that provide equivalent exposure to the rivaroxaban 10-mg once daily regimen in 
adults are also being evaluated in the Phase 1 study  conducted by [CONTACT_708310]. Based on 
the current knowledge of the coagulation system in the pediatric population, the expectation is 
that children will respond to FXa inhibiti on in a similar manner to adults. This hypothesis is 
supported by  [CONTACT_236326]-vivo spi[INVESTIGATOR_889476], which covered the entire rivaroxaban concentration in 
clinical studies rangingup to 500 ng/mL ,and in which similar exposure -response relationships 
existed in h ealthy  children and adults of different age groups (23 day s to 23 months, 2 to 6 y ears, 
7 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years, and adults).1,2,25
1.1.5. Efficacy  and Safety  Profile Based on Pediatric Clinical Studies 
Rivaroxaban is currently  being developed for the treatment of VTE in pediatric subjects 
(EINSTEIN Junior program). The VTE treatment pediatric clinical development program was 
designed in a comprehensive, staggered and stepwise approach to establish pediat ric age-specific 
dosing recommendations and to explore the comparative safet y and efficacy of rivaroxaban to 
the standard -of-care therapy  in children from birth to <[ADDRESS_1245274] one dose of rivaroxaban in these pediatric trials. 
The VTE treatment program is comprised of 7 studies of which 1 study  has been completed, 5 
are ongoing and 1 is planned to start in 2017.
Two Phase 1 studies: 
Study  #[ZIP_CODE] is a Phase 1 study  in pediatric subjects from 6 months to 18 years of age, 
which recentl y completed enrollment. This Phase 1 study  was designed to evaluate the 
safet y profile of a single dose of rivaroxaban ready  to use suspension and confirm the 
age-and body -weight adjusted pediatric dose recommendations equivalent to 10 and 
20mg single dose in adults derived from adult data and PBPK modeling. 
Study  #[ADDRESS_1245275] received a single dose of rivaroxaban in these Phase 1 studies.
Two Phase 2 studies (Study  #[ZIP_CODE] and #[ZIP_CODE]) are enrolling pediatric subjects from 
6months to [ADDRESS_1245276] received rivaroxaban in these Phase 2 studies.
Study  #[ZIP_CODE] is a Phase 3 study  in pediatric sub jects from 6 months to <[ADDRESS_1245277] received rivaroxaban.

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017Study  # [ZIP_CODE] is a Phase 1/2 7 -day study  of safety, efficacy  and the pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacod ynamic properties of ora l rivaroxaban in pediatric subjects from birth to 6 months 
with catheter -related arterial or venous thrombosis. Pediatric subjects will be receiving an 
age-and bod y weight -adjusted dose of rivaroxaban (20 mg equivalent). Enrollment is 
currentl y starting, and [ADDRESS_1245278] has received rivaroxaban.
Study  #[ZIP_CODE] is a Phase 3 study  in pediatric subjects from birth to 6 months planned to start 
in 2017.
In the ongoing rivaroxaban studies in pediatric subjects, rivaroxaban has been well tolerated; 
there have been no cases of drug -related death and no major bleeding events . 
No recurrences of VTE have been observed during rivaroxaban treatment in phase 2studies. In 
the Phase 3study  [ZIP_CODE] with a 2:[ADDRESS_1245279] of care arm, 
there were 3 outcomes in the rivaroxaban arm (including 1recurrence that occurred during the 
initial heparin treatment, ie,before rivaroxaban was started) and [ADDRESS_1245280] profile in 
adults. I n summary , these data support a positive risk/benefit assessment.
1.2. Comparator A gent
Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
Acet ylsalicy lic acid is a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory  drug (NSAID) . The mechanism of action 
of ASA is suppressio n of prostaglandins and thromboxanes production by [CONTACT_889512].
Acet ylsalicy lic acid is indicated as a pain reliever for the temporary  relief of minor aches and
pains. It also has an antiplatelet effect and at lower doses can be used as a long -term treatment to 
help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clot formation in patients at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_889480].
Adverse reactions associated with the use of ASA include allergic reactions, an increase drisk of 
gastrointestinal bleeding, and Rey e's sy ndrome.
Further information regarding low dose ASA can be found in the local approved product label .
1.3. Overall Rationale for the Study
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_889481] , 
the riskof thrombotic events remains an important complication for pediatric patients following 
the Fontan procedure .21
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) convened a Working Group in 2012 to 
explore the issues related to thrombosis in children with CHD .19The report from the Working 
Group identified single ventricle patients as a priority  population and further noted that studies to 
evaluate thromboprophylaxis in this patient population both before and after the Fontan 
procedure were a top research priorit y.Therefore, there is an important unmet medical need for

Clinical Protocol 39039039CHD3001 -Amendment INT -2
26
Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_1245281] s that were randomized to treatment with ASA or heparin/warfarin 
for [ADDRESS_1245282] s. Thrombotic 
events (venous and arterial) were the primary  endpoints in the study . Results demonstrated a 
peak incidence of VTE in the first 6months, and no significant difference in event rates between 
the treatment groups with thrombosis occurring in 21% of ASA -treated subjects and 24% of 
warfarin -treated subjects. The study found no difference in risk of thrombosis between subject s 
randomize d to warfarin at the 2 years study  endpoint. All of the thrombotic events in the study  
were venous events (no arterial events).20Although there was no difference between warfarin 
and ASA, the event rate supports the decision to include an active comparator for which there is 
a perceived equipoise . 
To date, no consensus exists in the literature or in routine clinical practice as to the optimal type 
or duration of antithrombotic therap y for thromboprophy laxis after Fontan surgery  and much of 
the data for pediatric recommendations is still extrapolated from adult data.11,18Current 
guidelines recommend the use of ASA ,or unfractionated heparin followed by [CONTACT_1996] K 
antagonist (VKA )for thromboprophy laxis in pediatric subjects after the Fontan procedure .12,11,18
While these recommendations are based on available literature and experts opi[INVESTIGATOR_889482], currently  there are 
no anticoagulants approved for use in children for treatment or prophy laxis of thromboembolism 
in the [LOCATION_002]  or European Union . Instead, anticoagulants (namely , VKAs and heparins) 
are currentl y used off-label in children. Furthermore, there is a negligible amount of published 
data on the safet y and efficacy  of novel oral anticoagulation agents in children for whom 
anticoagulation is recommended.
This study  aims toprovide safet yand efficacy  information on the use of rivaroxaban , an oral 
anticoagulant, compared to ASA , an antiplatelet, in this population.

2.1. Objectives   
Primary Objectives
Part A
To characterize the single -and multiple -dose PKand PK/ PDprofiles after oral rivaroxaban 
therap y administered to pediatric subjects [ADDRESS_1245283] completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrollment.
Part B
To evaluate the safety  and efficacy  of rivaroxaban, administered twice daily  (exposure matched 
to rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily in adults) compared toASA , given once daily  (approximately 
5mg/kg) for thromboprophy laxis in pediatric subjects [ADDRESS_1245284] completed the Fontan procedure within 4 months prior to enrollment.
Secondary Objectives
Part A
To assess the safet y and tolerability of rivaroxaban treatment.
Part B
To further characterize the PK and PK/PD p rofiles of rivaroxaban.
2.2. Hypothesis
Childr en with CHD who underwent a Fontan procedure will respond to FXa inhibition by 
[CONTACT_889500] a similar manner as seen in adults. This hypothesis is supported by [CONTACT_889501][INVESTIGATOR_889476], which covered the entire rivaroxaban concentration in clinical studies 
ranging up to 500ng/mL , and in which similar exposure -response relationships existed in 
healthy  children and adults of different age groups (23 days to 23 months, 2 to 6 years, 7 to 11 
years, 12 to 16 y ears, and adults).1,2
There is no statistical hypothesis testing for this study .

Dose and Dosing Regimen, Treatment Period
Because patients with known thrombosis will not be allowed to be enrolled in this study , this 
population will more closely  be similar to a prophy laxis population than a treatment population .
The rivaroxaban dose to be used in this study  was determined via an adapted PBPK modeling 
approach based on previously  established and validated rivaroxaban PBPK modeling, used for 
the VTE pediatric studies and adap ted to reflect the special physiology  of the pediatric 
post-Fontan population.26,24Rivaroxaban will be administered to the pediatric post-Fontan 
population as age -and body  weight -adjusted dosing targeting exposure (as measured by  [CONTACT_12265]0-24 
at stead y state) ,matching that of rivaroxaban 10 mg total daily  dose in adults that has been 
shown to be safe and effective for thromboprophy laxis in adult subjects after major orthopedic 
surgery  (Phase 3RECORD studies).32
The pediatric PBPK model was also used to compare once -or twice -daily  dosing options. 
Twice -daily  dosing was chosen because it provided both, a lower Cmax that stayed completely 
within the adult reference range and a higher trough plasma concentration (Ctrough )that was 
sufficiently  high to not fall below the lower adult PBPK modeling range. 
No relevant difference in Cmax is expected between the first dosing day and stead y state in the 
population targeted in this study .
These subje cts will be followed for [ADDRESS_1245297] 
postoperative year in particular .16,17

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017PK and PD Sampling Scheme
Pharmacokinetic and PD samples will be drawn on Day 1 and Day 4 of rivaroxaban treatment in 
Part A with the main goal of obtaining initial assessment of rivaroxaban exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic and PD samples will also be drawn at Month 3 and Month 12, to further enrich 
and refine the initial PK/PD model and to evaluate any adjustment in dose made at Month 6 due 
to the subjects’ weight gain. 
Comparator Selection
Subjects in Part B are randomized to ASA as the appropriate comparator to allow for the 
evaluation of benefit/risk of rivaroxaban as a thromboprophy lactic agent in pediatric subjects 
who have single -ventricle physiology  and who have completed the Fontan procedure. This 
decision was made based on careful consideration of the literature, existing guidelines for the 
standard -of-care practice ,and current clinical practice in man y centers. 
Current American College of Chest Physicians 2012 guidelines recommend ASA, or
unfractionated heparin followed by [CONTACT_889515].12The American Heart 
Association, in a statement in 2013, suggested that long-term antiplatelet therap y for prevention 
of thrombosis is reasonable after the Fontan procedure and that prophy laxis with warfarin or 
LMWH may be reasonable after the Fontan procedure for patients with anato mic or 
hemody namic risk factors.11However, controversy  remains in clinical practice as to the optimal 
prevention strategy  to be followed, as there are no evidence -based recommendat ions.11,12The 
only prospective, multicenter, randomized study  published showed a similar cumulative risk for 
thrombosis between ASA (5mg/kg/day )and heparin/warfarin treatment.20In a secondary  
analysis of this study , risk reduction was observed in a small subset of subjects in the warfarin 
group who had adequate INR levels and in those on ASA, compared with subjects in the 
warfarin group with a high prevalence of sub therapeutic INR measurements (<30% INR 
measurements within the target range).18These subjects had a significantly  greater risk of 
thrombosis than those subject s who received ASA therap y alone. Because the factors associated 
with poorly  controlled warfarin therapy  in these subjects have not been identified y et, the authors 
of the study  concluded that ASA might be the best current strategy  to prevent thrombosis for this 
patient population.18Using ASA as the comparator in this study  will allow a descriptive 
comparison of results across 2different drug classes: antiplatelet versus anticoagulant therapy  
within the period of highest incidence of thrombosis (up to 12 months after Fontan procedur e). 
A new oral anticoagulant such as rivaroxaban, which demonstrated in studies in adults to be 
noninferior regarding efficacy  but with more predictable and stable PK and easier to dose, may 
be a potential alternative to ASA or VKA treatment in the post -Fontan population.

and baseline characteristics) are evenly  balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the 
validity  of the descriptive comparisons between treatment groups. Open -label treatment will be 
used to allow for further evaluation of the PK and PK/PD profiles of rivaroxaban throughout the 
study .
Safety Assessments
As with any anticoagulant agent, the use of rivaroxaban is associated with an increased risk of 
bleeding events. Bleeding events will be assessed using the International Society  on Thrombosis 
and Hemostasis (ISTH) classification to be consistent with the other rivaroxaban pediatric VTE 
treatment studie s.5,27All bleeding events will be adjudicated b y the CIAC.
Efficacy Assessment
The efficacy  outcomes of any  thrombotic event (venous or arterial), defined as the appearance of 
a new thrombotic burden withi n the CVsystem on either routine surveillance or clinicall y 
indicated imaging, or the occurrence of a clinical event known to be strongl y associated with 
thrombus (such as cardioembolic stroke, pulmonary  embolism), are accepted, validated, clinical 
endpoi nts for the evaluation of thromboprohy laxis. All trans thoracic echocardiograms will be 
taken under a standardized protocol and will be read in a blinded manner at a central laboratory 
to minimize inter -site variability and bias .

Subjects in Part A will not be randomized.
Treatment Allocation
Procedures for Randomiza tionin Part B
Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2treatment groups based on a computer -generated 
randomization schedule prepared before the study  by [CONTACT_43754]. 
The randomization ratio will be 2:[ADDRESS_1245304]. Study  drug code numbers will be preprinted on 
the study  drug labels and assigned as subjects qualify  for the study  and are assigned to treatment.
The interac tive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code for each 
subject , which will dictate the treatment assignment and matching study  drug kit for the subject. 
The requestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identificati on number 
when contact[CONTACT_889516].
Blinding
As this is an open -label study , blinding procedures are not applicable.
6. DOSA GE A ND A DMINISTR ATION
Rivaroxaban: The rivaroxaban dose to beused in this study  was determined via an adapt ed 
PBPK modeling approach .26Rivaroxaban will be administered twice daily  in an open -label 
fashion as a 0.1% (1 mg/ml) oral suspension with target exposure (AUC 0-24at steady  state)
matching to that of rivaroxaban 10 mg total daily  dose in adults (age-and body  weight -adjusted 
dosing [see Table 1]). Because children with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 
30mL/min/1.73 m2are excluded from the study , dose reduction for impaired renal function is 
not required. Rivaroxaban will be taken in the morning and in the evening (approximately 
12hours apart) at approximately  the same times each day  as described in the study  bookl et. Dose 
adjustment , due to increased body  weight, will be made at Month 6 (both Part A and Part B).

9.1.6. Transthoracic Echocardiograms 
Transthoracic echocardiograms will be obtained according to the timepoints noted in the Time 
and Events Schedule for the assessment of thrombotic events .For the Screening post-Fontan 
transthoracic echocardiogram, the Post-Fontan Echocardiographic Examina tion protocol in 
Attachment 2 is to be followed, and the following guidelines will be applicable :
The subject is not to be enrolled if local reading of the Screening transthoracic 
echocardiogram confirms thrombosis . The subject ’s transthoracic echocardiogram will not 
need to be sent to the core laboratory .
The subject may be enrolled if local readingof the Screening transthoracic echocardiogram 
rules out thrombosis and the remaining inclusion/exclusion criteria are satisfied. The 
Screening transthoracic echocardiogram is tobe sent to the core laboratory for central 
reading.
The subject will be withdrawn from the study  if the subject is enrolled after local reading
rulesout thrombosis onthe transthoracic echocardiogram and subsequently  central reading 
by [CONTACT_889519] a thrombosis from the same transthoracic echocardiogram. 
The reasoning for the early  withdraw alwill be documented on the eCRF.
The core laboratory report will serve as the baseline for the comparison of the subsequent study 
transthoracic echocardiograms. 
Investigators can image as often as medicall y necessary  or as needed based on their institution’s 
standard -of-care; however, protocol -based imaging must be performed according to the 
timepoints noted in the Time and Events Schedule . Echocardiograms will be sent to a core 
laboratory  for blinded reading and to minimize inter-site variabilit yand bias. During the course 
of the study , for subjects who prematurel y discontinue study  drug for any reason, thefinal 
echocardiogram will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation at the ESMD visit. A

9.3.1. Bleeding Events
The primary  safety  outcome will be major bleeding events, as defined below. Clinically  relevant 
non-major bleeding events and trivial (minimal) bleeding will be secondary  safet y outcomes.
Bleeding events will be adjudicated by [CONTACT_889521] .5,27The 
following bleeding criteria are consistent across the rivaroxaban pediatric program :
Major bleeding is define d as overt bleeding and:
Associated with a fall in hemoglobin of 2 g/dL or more; or
Leading to a transfusion of the equivalent of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells or 
whole blood in adults ; or
Occurring in a critical site: intracranial, intraspin al, intraocular, pericardial, intra-articular, 
intramuscular with compartment sy ndrome, retroperitoneal; or
Contributing to death.
Clinically  relevant non-major bleeding is defined as overt bleeding not meeting the criteria for 
major bleeding but associate d with :
Medical intervention, or
Unscheduled contact (visit or telephone call) with a phy sician, or
(Temporary ) cessation of study  treatment, or 
Discomfort for the subject such as pain, or 
Impairment of activities of daily  life (such as loss of school d ays or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]).
Trivial (minimal) bleeding is defined as any  other overt bleeding event that does not meet criteria 
for clinicall y relevant non major bleeding.
9.3.2. Approach to the Subject with a Bleeding Event
If a subject has a serious bleed during study  treatment, the following routine measures could be 
considered by [CONTACT_74079] :
Consider usual treatment for bleeding, including blood transfusion, and/or fresh frozen 
plasma if needed
Consider that other causes besides thromboprophy laxis medication can be contributory  to 
the seriousness of the bleeding event (eg, thrombocy topenia, and other coagulopathies; 
kidney  and liver dy sfunction; concomitant medications), and treat accordingly  
Delay  the next ASA or rivaroxaban administration or tempor arily discontinue treatment, if 
indicated

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017If the subject is treated with rivaro xaban, a blood sample for PK and PD testing should be 
obtained
NOTE: Partial reversal of prothrombin time prolongation has been seen after administration of 
prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) in healthy  volunteers. The use of other procoagulant 
reversal agents like activated prothrombin complex concentrate (APCC) or recombinant factor 
VIIa (rFVIIa) has not been evaluated.
If severe bleeding cannot be controlled, however, consider administration of one of the following 
procoagulants (both according to the dosages advised in the package insert):
4 factor concentrate 
Recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven®) 
Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagul ant activity  of 
rivaroxaban.
Any products administered to control bleeding should be entered in the CRF.
Parents/ legally  acceptable representatives should call the study  physician , if the subject has 
signs and s ymptoms of clinically  significant bleeding, for example:
bleeding (eg, nose or gum bleeding) that does not stop within 10 minutes
coughing or throwing up blood
dark-colored urine or black stools
red or black -and-blue marks on the skin that get larger
If the subject has a bleeding incident, the paren t/ legall y acceptable representatives should 
consult the study  physician in addition to their own cardiologist (if different) and alway s inform 
him/her of the date/time the subject took the last dose of anticoagulant medication. For severe 
bleeding ,subjec ts should be moved to the nearest emergency  room.
After resolution of the bleeding event, restarting study  drug may be considered based on the 
clinical judgment of the investigator.  
9.3.3. Other Safety  Assessments
The safet y and tolerability  of rivaroxaban will also be evaluated by [CONTACT_889522].
Any clinically  relevant changes , including laboratory  reports, occurring during the study  must be 
recorded on the Adverse Event section of the eCRF. Any clinically  significant abnormalities 
persisting at the end of the study /early withdrawal will be followed by [CONTACT_564860] a clinically  stable endpoint is reached.

Approved , Date: 27 July [ZIP_CODE].4. Efficacy  Evaluations/Outcomes
The primary  efficacy  outcome will be an y thrombotic event (venous or arterial), defined as :
The appearance of a new thrombotic burden within the cardiovascular system on either 
routine surveillance or clinically  indicated imaging, or
The occurrence of a clinical event known to be strongl y associated with thrombus (such as 
cardioembolic stroke, pulmonary  embolism).
Subjects who develop either a symptomatic or asymptomatic thrombotic event during the study  
must permanentl y discontinue the study  drug. All thrombotic events and the primary  cause of 
any death will be adjudicated by  [CONTACT_105812]. Transthoracic echocardiograms will be centrall y read 
by [CONTACT_889507] . All available imaging results (eg, transthoracic or 
transesophageal echocardiograms, or MRIs), should be sent tothe CIAC. Sites will be required 
to complete a worksheet, compi[INVESTIGATOR_889490], and send it to the adjudication office
within 6weeks from occurrence of the event .
After cessation of the study  drug, it is at the investigator’s discretion to continue with other 
antithrombotic therap y. The investigator should document this therap y in the eCRF. Thrombotic 
events will not be reported as adverse events or serious adverse events, as they will be reported 
as efficacy  outcomes , which will be document ed in the eCRF.
9.5. Sample Collection and Handling   
The actual dates and times of sample collection must be recorded in the eCRF or laboratory 
requisition form.
If blood samples are collected via an indwelling cannula, an appropriate amount (eg, 1 mL) of 
fluid slightly  greater than the dead space volume of the lock will be removed from the cannula 
before each blood sample is taken. If a blood sample is taken from a central line, at least 3 mL of 
blood should be withdrawn prior to collecting study  blood sample s. Investigators should follow 
their institution’s policy  for discarding or re-infusing withdrawn blood. Heparin can be used to 
maintain catheter patency ; however, before collecting PK/PD samples, the catheter needs to be 
flushed with saline and the first volume of (diluted) blood should be withdrawn, as described 
above.
Refer to the T ime and Events Schedule for the timing and frequency  of all sample collections.
Instructions for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples are found in the 
laboratory  manual that will be provided. Collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples 
must be under the specified, and where applicable, controlled temperature conditions as indicated 
in the laboratory  manual.

Other –eg, termination of the study  by [CONTACT_456], closing of study  sites
When a subject withdraws before completing thestudy , the reason for withdrawal is to be 
documented in the eCRF and in the source document. Study  drug assigned to the withdrawn 
subject may  not be assigned to another subject. 
If a subject is withdrawn before the end of the study for reasons other than being lost to 
follow -up, the ESMD assessments should be obtained as soon as possible and a Follow -up phone 
contact [CONTACT_889525]  30 days (+/-7 days) after last dose of study  drug. This 
excludes subjects withdrawn after central reading by [CONTACT_889526] a thrombosis on

Statistical analy sis will be done by [CONTACT_43758]. A general 
description of the statistical methods to be used to analyze the PK, PK/PD, safet y,and the 
efficacy  data is outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan
(SAP), including, if neces sary, censoring rules for time-to-event analyses and imputati on rules 
for missing or partially  missing dates.
The SAP will be finalized prior to first subject enrolled in the study . 
Data from subjects participating in Part A of the study  are planned to be combined with data 
from subjects in Part B of the study  who were randomized to rivaroxaban. Summaries will also 
be provided based on data from: (a) randomized subjects only (rivaroxaban vs. ASA) from 
PartB, and (b) subjects participating in Part A only.
For both parts of the study , safety  and efficacy  results (adverse events, bleedings ,and thrombotic 
events) will be summarized. All summaries will be presented using appropriate descriptive 
statistics for study  variables including demographic and baseline characteristics. Descriptive 
statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will be used to 
summarize continuous variables. Counts and percentages will be used to summarize categorical 
variables. 
The best available data for safet y events will be used by [CONTACT_889529], PD ,and Safet y Assessment Period of Part A . The CIAC -adjudicated results will 
be used in the final anal ysis for all subjects.
No statistical hy pothesis will be tested in this study .

12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
Parents/legally  acceptable representatives will receive a study  booklet, specify ing for both 
treatment groups important study -related information (see Section 9.6, Study  Booklet ).  
Timely , accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety  information from clinical studies 
are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by 
[CONTACT_23824]. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in 
conformity  with regulatory  requirements worldw ide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y 
information; all clinical studies conducted by [CONTACT_43765].
12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event ca n therefore be any  unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not 
related to that medicinal (investigat ional or non-investigational) product. (Definition per 
International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH])
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponsor collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF(refer to 
Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_1245347] adverse event recording).
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal 
Products for Human Use is any  untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity

Clinical Protocol 39039039CHD3001 -Amendment INT -2
59
Approved , Date: 27 July 2017Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*
*Medical and scientific judgment s hould be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is 
also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These should usually  be considered serious.
For the purposes of this study , efficacy  outcome events (thrombotic events) will not be reported 
as adverse events or seriou s adverse events ,as they will be reported as efficacy  outcomes (See 
Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events. ). 
Serious bleeding events will be considered serious adve rse events and must be reported to the 
sponsor in an expedited manner as an y other serious adverse events .
If a serious and unexpected adverse event occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal 
relationship between the study  drug and the event, the event must be reported by  [CONTACT_3174] a 
serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study 
endpoint. 
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity  is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safet y information. For rivaroxaban , the expectedness of an adverse 
event will be determined by  [CONTACT_41028] I nvestigator's Brochure .
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, 
probable, or very  likel yby [CONTACT_690327] 12.1.2 , Attribution Definitions .
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Not Related
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug.
Doubtful
An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, 
eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017Probable
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(eg,confirme d by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s).
Very Likely
An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonabl y explained 
by [CONTACT_4867], eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship 
in time is very  suggestive (eg, it is confirmed b y dechallenge and rechallenge).
12.1.3. Severity Criteria 
An assessment of severity  grade will be made using the following general categorical 
descripto rs:
Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity .
Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents normal every day activities.
The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly  
experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory  abnormalities).
12.2. Special Rep orting Situations
Safety  events of interest on a sponsor study  drugthat may require expedited reporting and/or 
safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of a sponsor study  drug
Suspected abuse/ misuse of a sponsor study  drug
Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor study  drug
Any failure of expected pharmacologic action (ie , lack of effect) of a sponsor study  drug
Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a sponsor study  drug
Medication error involving product prepar ation or dose administration of a sponsor product 
(with or without subject/patient exposure to the sponsor study  drug, eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF .Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page 
of the eCRF

16. ETHICA L ASPECTS
16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations
The primary  ethical consideration in this study  is the use of young pediatric subjects who have 
recentl y completed the Fontan procedure with a high thrombotic risk and for whom there is scant 
evidence -based informati on regarding thromboprophy laxis . There is limited data on the optimal 
use of thromboprophy laxis for these children and the data are primarily  extrapolated from 
clinical studies in adults. None of the current standards of care (ASA or warfarin) appear to have 
been very successful at mitigating the risk and incidence of post-Fontan thrombosis according to 
the small amount of data from few clinical studies and the cumulative years of 
practice.12,11,23,20,18Using ASA as the comparator in this study  will allow a descriptive
comparison of results across 2different drug classes: antiplatelet (ASA) versus anticoagulant 
(rivaroxaban, which has demonstrated effectiveness in the adult population as a 
thromboprophy laxis agent). In combination with extrapolation from adult efficacy  data, this 
study  could support an alternative treatment in this population by [CONTACT_889535], PD, safety , and 
supportive efficacy  data.
Therefore, this study  aims to assess the safet y and efficacy  of a novel oral anticoagulant that has 
been extensively  studied and has demonstrated safet y and efficacy  for the prevention and 
treatment of multiple thrombosis -mediated conditions in adults, and thus far has been well 
tolerated in pediatric subject s. The study  is designed with sufficient scientific rigor to meet its 
objectives while having close oversight of an IDMC, in addition to the sponsor, to protect 
subjects from experiencing unacceptabl y high levels of risk of harm or suffering. Further, the 
study  risk/benefit consideration will be addressed, and reviewed, by [CONTACT_889536] . Due to the limited availability  of subjects in this 
study  population and the expected low event rate, formal hypothesis testing of the primary 
efficacy  endpoint is not feasible.
Parents/legall y acceptable representatives of potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks 
and requirements of the study , andduring the study they will be given any new information that 
may affect their decision to continue participation. Parents/legall y acceptable representatives and 
subjects 7 to 8 years of age will be told that their consent/assent to participate in the study  is 
voluntary  and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of 
benefits to which they  would otherwise be entitled. 
When referring to the signing of the ICF, the term legall y acceptable representative refers to the 
legall y appointed guardian of the child with authorit y to authoriz e participation in research. For 
each subject, his or her parent(s) (preferabl y both parents, if available) or a legall y acceptable 
representative(s), as required by [CONTACT_427], must give written consent (permission)

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_1245354] be obtained from children (minors) 
capable of understanding the nature of the study , typi[INVESTIGATOR_479194] [ADDRESS_1245355] provided consent (and assent as applicable) refer to the subjects and his or her parent(s) 
or the subject's legall y acceptable representative(s) who have provided consent/assent according to 
this process. Minors who assent to a study  and later withdraw that assent should not be maintained 
in the study  against their will, even if their parents/ legally  acceptable representatives still want 
them to pa rticipate. 
Clinical Study with a New Study Drug 
Thorough scientific evaluation of any promising treatment before market authorization is an 
ethical requirement. In the continuing search for medications with improved efficacy  and safet y 
profiles, it is necessary  to fully investigate and understand new products before public exposure. 
Full investigation and study  of a new product must alway s include the study  of pediatric subjects 
if there is an y reasonable belief that the treatment will benefit the pediatr ic population.
Rivaroxaban has been proven to have a positive benefit -risk profile in multiple 
thrombosis -mediated conditions. This study  is being conducted in pediatric subjects [ADDRESS_1245356] completed the Fontan procedure within 
4months prior to enrollment. The results of this study  are expected to provide useful information 
on the PK, PK/PD, safety ,and efficacy  of rivaroxaban as well as the dosing guidelines for this 
pediatric patient population. 
The daily, cumulative, and total blood volume to be collected from each subject in this study  is 
within the range of maximum allowances for pediatric research set by [CONTACT_2360][INVESTIGATOR_889493] y 
participating in pediatric clinical studies .13The total blood volume to be collected will be 
approximately  32.7 mL in Part A and 25 ml in Part B over a 12 month period (Attachment 1: 
Blood Volume). These estimates do not include any blood discarded due to blood drawing from 
peripheral or central lines, as these volumes may  vary  according to each site’s practice.
Safety of Dose 
This is the first clinical study  with rivaroxaban in pediatric subjects after t he Fontan procedure ; a 
potential risk will be the actual exposure to study  drug at the planned dose in the studied 
population being inconsistent with the estimated exposure based on PBPK modeling, which can 
lead to adverse events including bleeding events, or lack of efficacy . 
To ensure appropriate exposure to study  drug, a staggered approach was chosen. In Part A of the 
study , in a small number of subjects, the single -and multiple -dose rivaroxaban PK will be 
evaluated as well as the initial safet y and to lerability . The DRC will review the subject’s PK, PD ,
and safet y data obtained from the Initial PK, PD, and Safet y Assessment Period prior to allowing 
the subject to continue on rivaroxaban therap y to complete the 12 -month period .

Approved , Date: 27 July 2017Enrollment and randomization into Part B of this study  will only begin once the PK and safet y 
results in the Initial PK, PD,and Safet y Assessment Period for subjects in Part A are deemed 
acceptable b y the IDMC.
Capacity to Provide Informed Consent
Only  parent(s) (preferably  both parents if available) or legall y acceptable representative(s) who 
are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, potential adverse events, and alternatives to 
participation, will provide their consent voluntarily . Subjects 7 to 8 years of age may be asked 
for their voluntary  assent; the investigator will determine each subject’s capacity  to provide 
informed assent. 
Subjects of 7 to 8 years of age or their parents or legall y acceptable representatives may 
withdraw their assent or consent , respectivel y at any  time without having to give a reason.

Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
study -sitepersonnel before the study , andperiodic monit oring visits by [CONTACT_456], and direct 
transmission of clinical laboratory  data from a central laboratory  into the sponsor's data base. 
Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. 
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -sitepersonnel before 
the start of the stud y.
The sponsor will review eCRFs for accuracy  and completeness during on-site monitoring visits 
and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will beresolved with the investigator or 
designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they  will be verified for 
accuracy  and consistency with the data sources. 
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investi gator/institution will maintain all eCRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_8090], custody  must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study  
docum ents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor .
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such 
repor ts.

enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compare data entered into the eCRFs with 
the source documen ts(eg, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records); a sample may be 
reviewed. The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all 
sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor andstudy -site 
personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If electronic 
records are maintained at the study  site, the method of verification must be discussed with the 
study -site personnel. 
Direct access to source docume nts(medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the recorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this 
review will be discussed with the study -site personnel. The sponsor expects that, during
monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source document swill
be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related 
documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study  to 
provide feedback on the study  conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during 
these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress 
of the study at the site.  Central monitoring will take place for data identified by [CONTACT_889541].
17.9. Study Completion/ Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion /End of Study
The study  is considered completed with the last scheduled study  contact [CONTACT_889542] . The final data from the study site 
will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final subject study  contact [CONTACT_889543], in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement.
17.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study  completion. A
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.

77
Approved , Date: 27 July 2017The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notic e is given in advance of the intended termination.
Reasons for the earlyclosure of astudy site by [CONTACT_11004]:
Failure of the investigator to comply  with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/I RB or 
local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines
Inadequate recruitment of subjects by  [CONTACT_093]
Discontinuation of further study  drug development
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  site at 
any time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy . These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source documents, for inspection. Subject privacy  must, however, be 
respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and 
available for consultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits conducted by [CONTACT_170192]. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if he or shehas
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection.
17.11. Use of Information and Publication
All information, including but not limited to information regarding rivaroxaban or the sponsor's 
operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior 
clinical data, formulation information) supplied by [CONTACT_889544], and any data, including research data, generated as a result of this study , 
areconsidered confidential and remain the sole property  of the sponsor. The investigator agrees 
to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this 
study , and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor's prior written consent.
The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by [CONTACT_889545] , and thus may  be disclosed 
as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory  agencies. To permit the information 
derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the sponsor 
with all data obtained in the study .
The results of the study  will be reported in a Clinical Study  Report generated by [CONTACT_170195] . Recruitment

contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication by [CONTACT_23868]) shall be the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of 
copy right in such work.
Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal 
Editors guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary  (multicenter) data 
and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish 
study  site-specific data after the primary  data are published. If an investigator wishe s to publish 
information from the study ,a copy  of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review 
at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be 
arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by [CONTACT_170196], the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60days to allow 
for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity  or 
regulatory  compliance, the sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The sponsor 
will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress 
information. Formulticenter study  designs and substudy  approaches, secondary  results generall y 
should not be published before the primary  endpoints of a study  have been published. Similarly , 
investigators will recognize the integrity  of a multicenter study by [CONTACT_41055], within 12 months of the availability  of the final data (tables, 
listings, graphs), or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study  publication. 
Authorship ofpublications resulting from this study  will be based on the guidelines on 
authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to 
Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant 
contribution to the design of the study  or analy sis and interpretation of the data, provided critical 
review of the paper, and given final approval of the final version.

Inclusion: Patient having undergone a Fontan operation. This operation has been performed with various 
surgical modifications including: 1) direct anastomosis of the right atrium to the pulmonary artery; 2) 
valved or non-valved conduit from right atrium to right ventricle; 3) classic Glenn shunt (superior vena 
cava to transected right pulmonary artery) and conduit from inferior vena cava to left pulmonary artery; 4) 
bidirectional Glenn shunt plus intra-atrial conduit connection from the inferior vena cava to the right 
pulmonary artery; 5) bidirectional Glenn shunt plus extracardiac conduit connection from the  inferior 
vena cava to the main pulmonary artery. Optimal evaluation of the Fontan is achieved by [CONTACT_889547]. The individual performing the examination 
must find out the details of the operation before the examination.

The original Schwartz formula: If serum creatinine (SCr) is measured with routine methods 
that have not been recalibrated to be traceable to isotope dilutio n mass spectrometry  (IDMS) 
(eg,the traditional Jaffé reaction), the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR )should be 
obtained from the original Schwartz formula:28
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = k * height (cm) / SCr g/dL) where k is proportionality  constant:
k = 0.55 in children up to 13 y ears
The updated Schwartz formula: If SCr is measured by [CONTACT_889548] , the updated Schwartz formula should be used 
to obtain the eGFR:29
eGFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 0.413 * height (cm) / SCr mg/dL
The National Kidney  Disease Education Program website
(http://www.nkdep.nih.gov/professionals/gfr_calculators/index.htm) offers electronic calculators 
of eGFR in the pediatric population based on the updated Schwartz formula. Serum creatinine in 
micromoles per liter, the value should be multiplied by  88.4 (1 mg/dL = 88.4 umol/L).

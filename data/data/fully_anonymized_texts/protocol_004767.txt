 5 0. UPDATE HISTORY 12/14/2016: The initial protocol was written for the [LOCATION_011] Claude D. Pepper Older American Independence Center Pi[INVESTIGATOR_103762]. 01/09/2017: The protocol was modified to include several cognitive-behavioral interventions to maximize the adherence to the exercise intervention.  Additional measures – self-efficacy and outcome expectation about exercise – were added.  The target enrollment was increased to 30 patients per each group.  After discussion with co-investigators and collaborators, the primary endpoint was changed from Short Physical Performance Battery (which measures specific functional tasks) to the patient-reported measure of Late Life Function Disability Instrument (which measures the actual performance of daily activities).  These mod-ifications were made in preparation for the [LOCATION_011] Roybal Center Pi[INVESTIGATOR_893990]. 02/14/2017: The protocol was modified to have a 3-group comparison, home exercise with cognitive be-havioral intervention, home exercise alone, and attention control education groups.  The sample size was changed to [ADDRESS_1252631] Program Review Committee. 03/27/2017: Minor updates were made to the data safety monitoring plan in response to the [LOCATION_011] Roybal Center Pi[INVESTIGATOR_893991]. 05/01/2017: Modifications were made per IRB request. 06/08/2017: Minor updates were made to include details of interventions (e.g., individualized goal setting, weekly plan, and progression schedule) and the related forms (Appendices 1 and 2) based on the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437]’ input.  Pre-specified subgroup analysis was added.  The Clock drawing test was added to the baseline assessment for measurement of executive function. 08/21/2017: New safety officer was designated per NIA requirement.  The intervention details were modified to allow flexible visit schedule to accommodate the participant’s medical appointments and personal pref-erence; a RPE scale copy will be provided.  Time on study will be counted from the date of first intervention visit.  Before the intervention 1, 15 to 20-minute introduction was added to review the study intervention schedule with the participant. 08/31/2017: Additional refinement in the intervention protocols and outcome assessment schedule was made. 09/23/2019: Addition of BWH as a site for recruitment.  In July 2019, a problem occurred with the assess-ment of the primary endpoint, LLFDI score.  The LLFDI-CAT software, which was originally developed in 2008, was no longer compatible with the latest version of the operating system.  LLFDI paper version was used instead, but the items and assessment domains were not consistent between the two versions.  In addition, these changes were not immediately implemented by [CONTACT_894027], which resulted in missing measurements. 03/09/2021: Since LLFDI-CAT scores were unavailable for most of the participants at [ADDRESS_1252632]-hoc outcome measure, disability score, was analyzed. Analysis plan was revised for the disability score.  
 6 1. OVERVIEW With the increasing number of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures in multi-morbid frail older adults with aortic stenosis (AS), more high-quality evidence is needed to improve the postopera-tive care of high-risk patients after TAVR.  Under the current model of care, TAVR patients continue to experience functional decline and disability despi[INVESTIGATOR_893992].  Currently, there is no es-tablished exercise intervention targeting both frailty and cardiac rehabilitation in older adults treated with transcatheter procedure. A pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269] (RCT) of a home-based exercise intervention with or without cognitive behavioral interventions vs. attention control educational intervention will be conducted to evaluate its fea-sibility in improving functional status and disability over 8 weeks in 60 older patients who are discharged home after TAVR from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) or Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (BWH).   Following informed consent and baseline testing, the participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion (20 patients per group) to receive either an individualized home-based exercise intervention with or without cognitive behavioral interventions or attention control educational intervention for 8 weeks.  The intervention will target balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance.  Exercises for the intervention group will be adopted from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) Go4Life exercise guide and modified to the participant's need and home environment.  The interventions will be conducted by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893993]'s home.  Upon discharge after TAVR, the participant will have 2 sessions per week for Weeks 1-2, 1 session per week for Weeks 3-4, and 1 session every other week for Weeks 5-8.  Cognitive-behavioral strategies will target self-efficacy, self-control, and positive outcome expectations of exercise to maximize adherence to the exercise program.  Participants in the attention-control arm will receive weekly telephone calls for 8 weeks to learn general information about exercise and lifestyle tips.  Physical therapy outside the study is allowed per the participant’s physician.   Participants will undergo measurements of physical function and disability at baseline, 4- and 8-weeks.  The primary outcome is the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument – Computer Adaptive Test (LLFDI-CAT), or the paper version (LLFDI).  As secondary outcomes, the change in physical function will be as-sessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and other performance measurements [re-vised 1/9/2017].  Adverse events and adherence will be monitored during the intervention phase. The proposed research will provide essential information to design a larger clinical trial of a home-based exercise intervention that promotes independence and improves functional status and quality of life in multi-morbid frail older adults undergoing TAVR through individualized risk assessment and interventions.    2. STUDY OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of an RCT comparing a home-based exercise intervention with or without cognitive behavioral interventions in older patients after undergoing TAVR.  We will evaluate the feasibility based on a) proportions of enrollment, refusal, and retention; b) adherence and potential barriers to exercise intervention; c) correlation of self-reported physical function and disability, LLFDI-CAT or LLFDI, vs. an objectively measurement of physical function, SPPB; and d) resources and costs of home visits and data management.  The information that we learn from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_635749] 
 [ADDRESS_1252633] of an 8-week, home-based exercise intervention with or without cognitive behavioral interventions vs. attention control educational intervention to evaluate its feasibility in improving physical function and disability over the 8-week period after TAVR.  We hypothesize that a home-based exercise program with cognitive behavioral intervention is more effective than home-based exercise alone; home-based exercise program with and without cognitive behavioral intervention is more effective than attention control educational intervention in preventing decline in physical function and disability after TAVR, as measured by [CONTACT_894028]-CAT or LLFDI.  2.2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To examine the effect of the intervention on the following endpoints at 8 weeks after discharge: • Change in SPPB score • Change in 2-minute walk distance • Change in dominant hand grip strength • Adherence to exercise • Adverse events 2.3. OTHER OBJECTIVES • To assess the correlation between the change in SPPB vs. the change in LLFDI-CAT or LLFDI score over 8 weeks after discharge.  3. BACKGROUND Over 2 million older Americans are affected by [CONTACT_894029] 50% die within 2 years of symptom onset without treatment.  TAVR, a catheter-based surgical procedure, provides symptomatic and survival benefits in older adults who are considered high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).1-3  Symptomatic improvement has been reported in 80-90% of patients after TAVR,2,3 but it is unclear whether their functional status also improves.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_893994], we found that functional status was infrequently measured in previous research; in the few studies that meas-ured functional status, clinically important improvement was not consistently seen.4   According to our unpublished data from an ongoing prospective study of older adults with AS who under-went TAVR (N=59) or SAVR (N=47) between 2/2014-1/[ADDRESS_1252634] correlation between the change in the [LOCATION_001] Heart Association (NYHA) func-tional class and the change in ADL (correlation: 0.33).  TAVR patients had higher prevalence of frailty phenotype (85% vs. 36%) and lower mean SPPB score (5.6 vs. 8.8) than SAVR patients.  Compared with SAVR patients whose ADL improved over 6 months, TAVR patients had ADL decline (Figure 1).  Our preliminary data highlights an urgent need for an intervention that promotes independence in TAVR pa-tients.  
 [ADDRESS_1252635] studies re-quired on-site training, a home-based program appears to be as effective, with better adherence.11  The following studies (Table 1) provide supporting evidence. Table 1.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA Patients will be excluded if they meet any of the following criteria:  1) Stroke or any other medical disease that precludes participation in the exercise program 2) Severe cognitive impairment, defined as Mini-Mental Status Exam score <15 3) Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial 4) Lack of confirmation from the patient’s health care provider that the patient is medically safe to participate in the exercise program If the patient’s clinical condition changes after signing the consent form, and the patient is going to a rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility instead of home, we will dis-enroll these patients; outcomes and adverse events will not be collected from these patients.  5. ENROLLMENT 5.1. SCREENING We will contact [CONTACT_894032] a list of patients who are planned for home discharge.  One day before the planned discharge date or on the day of discharge, patients will be approached in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_893996].  The screening process will continue until we enroll 60 patients.  Based on our experience at BIDMC, approximately 50% of TAVR patients are discharged home. 5.2. BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF FUNCTIONAL STATUS Once the informed consent is signed, the participant will undergo geriatric assessment before hospi[INVESTIGATOR_156827]-charge.  A trained research personnel will administer the following measures: • Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) (10 
 11 minutes) (range: 0-30) (if in-person MMSE is not feasible) • LLFDI-CAT or LLFDI (5 minutes): LLFDI (range: 0-100) is a self-reported measure of activity limi-tation and participation restriction for community-dwelling older adults.25-27  A shorter computerized adaptive version has shown comparable performance to the full version of LLFDI. • Dominant hand grip strength (2 minutes): average of 3 measurements (kg) • SPPB (5 minutes): A measure of lower extremity performance (range: 0-12) that includes the fol-lowing components28-31: o Balance: side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem stand o Gait: 4-meter walk time (average of 2 measurements) o Strength: 5-chair stand • Two-minute walk test (3 minutes): a measure of endurance (meters walked) Based on validated cut-points,28-32 physical functional capacity will be categorized as very low, low, inter-mediate, or high level of functioning (Table 2).   Based on the baseline functioning, an individualized home-based exercise program will be designed (see the Study Intervention Section below).  Table 2.

 12 • Procedure characteristics: Society of Thoracic Surgeons predictive risk of mortality and of mortality or major morbidity, TAVR type, access route, VARC-2 complications35 • Pre-procedure tests: echocardiogram, laboratory test results (last values before discharge) • Comorbid conditions and medications from discharge summary 5.4. RANDOMIZATION The participant will undergo TAVR prior to randomization.  At the time of discharge, those who are being discharged home will be randomized in 1:1:[ADDRESS_1252638] to their home environment and make follow-up doctors’ appointments.  When scheduling the first visit, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893997] (between discharge and the day of the scheduling call) to identify any medical condition changes.  At first visit, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893998] 15-20 minutes reviewing the study goal; orienting the participant to the intervention and outcome assessment schedule; as well as the study staff they will interact with during the study period.  This time is not considered part of the study intervention.   During the visit, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (PT) will set individual goals and teach exercises designed to improve balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance.  Over an 8-week period, a PT will visit twice a week for Weeks 1 and 2; once a week for Weeks 3 and 4; and every other week for Weeks 5 through 8 (on Weeks 6 and 8, respectively).  While adhering to this visit schedule is ideal, modification of the schedule is allowed to ac-commodate the participant’s competing needs for doctor’s appointments and personal preferences, as long as the first 6 visits are in 4 weeks, the 7th visit in week 6, and the 8th visit in week 8.  [Revised 08/31/2017] The visits that did not happen within [ADDRESS_1252639] is unable to schedule/confirm the visit with the participant, they will call one more time during the week.  No more than 2 scheduling calls will be placed. Exercises targeting balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance will be adopted mainly, though not exclu-sively, from the NIA Go4Life exercise guide booklet (source: https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/) and then modified based on the participant’s baseline physical function (Table 2) and home environment.  Sample exercises are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Sample exercises adapted from the NIA Go4Life Guide 
 13 Balance Flexibility (stretching) Strength Endurance • Stand on one foot • Heel-to-toe walk • Balance walk • Neck rotation • Shoulder • Shoulder and upper arm towel stretch • Upper body • Chest • Back • Ankle-modified to focus on hamstring stretch • Back of leg • Thigh • Hip, performed on the bed • Calf • Diaphragmatic breathing • Hand grip • Wrist curl • Front arm raise-seated • Side arm raise • Arm curl-seated • Seated row • Wall push-up • Elbow extension • Chair dip • Back leg raise • Side leg raise • Knee curl • Leg straightening • Chair stand • Toe stand • Walking 
At each home visit, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_893999], flexibility, strength, and endurance.  Exercise sessions will be 40 minutes in duration.  The progression of exercise will be individualized as following: • Balance: based on baseline function as tested by [CONTACT_894033] (RPE) scale, (as well as cardiac monitoring), the goal would be for patients to rate the exercise intensity between 11 and 13.  Progression would be adjusted based on this rating scale making the exercise either easier or harder.  The ability to perform the exercise with appropriate form and length would also determine the progression (i.e., stand on one foot with good form and without loss of balance with incremental time without touch support  until the participant is able to reach norms for age). • Strength: based on manual muscle test and baseline chair stand reps, initiate an appropriate weight where 8 reps would likely cause an RPE of 13-15 with appropriate cardiac response.  Progress to 10-15 reps at 13-15 RPE, then progress to 2 sets of 10-15 reps at RPE 13-15, before increasing the weight. • Endurance: based on cardiac measures and baseline 2-minute walk test, adjust exercise intensity to maintain the goal of RPE of 11-13. • Flexibility: start with [ADDRESS_1252640] 30 minutes daily focusing on upper and lower body exercises on alternating days, exercises for flexibility and balance daily, and walking daily.  By [CONTACT_2671] 8-week intervention period, the participant will receive the fol-lowing exercises: • 4 upper body strengthening exercises • 4 lower body strengthening exercises • 2-3 flexibility exercises, based on impairment • 1 balance exercise, based on impairment and safety • Walking program • Diaphragmatic breathing 
 [ADDRESS_1252641] will keep track of the participant’s progress, identified barriers, complaints, or any adverse events in a paper chart for each home visit.  Participants may receive physical therapy for medical needs outside the study if deemed necessary by [CONTACT_24018].  We will continue to weekly monitor use of outside physical therapy.  While the participant is receiving physical therapy outside the study, the study intervention will not be administered.  Once the outside physical therapy is complete, the study intervention will resume.  The study intervention will conclude after Week 8 according to the original schedule. 6.1.2. Cognitive behavioral interventions to improve adherence A written exercise plan will be provided weekly.  Exercise images in the Go4Life guide booklet will be used, whenever appropriate.  Participants are instructed to do prescribed exercises for 30 minutes daily.  A diary will be given to track exercises (see Appendix 2).  The diary will include sections of 1) individualized goals; 2) weekly plan; 3) weekly progress; 4) daily exercise tracking; and 5) adverse events.  The physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894000]’s progress during each home visit, while also assessing for possible adverse events and offering specific safety tips for the future prevention of adverse events.  When necessary, exer-cise intensity or progression will be modified.  To improve adherence, the following cognitive-behavioral strategies will be employed to improve self-efficacy, self-control, and outcome expectation for 20 minutes of each session: Week 1 • Enhance positive attitudes and beliefs about exercise through discussion of benefits of exercise: Refer to the following sources: o NIA Go4Life guide page 6-7 (Why is physical activity such a big deal?) o NIA Go4Life guide page 11 (Benefits of exercise and physical activity) o NIA Go4Life guide page 13 (Specific types of exercise and their benefit) o NIA Go4Life guide page 31 (Building up the benefits) • Discussion of barriers to exercise: o Individualize to each participant • Individualized goal setting: o Complete the study form “Your Goals” sheet (Appendix 2 – Diary – Exercise-CBT Group) • Develop a detailed exercise plan on what, when, and where to conduct exercise: o NIA Go4Life guide page 20 (Write a plan to add exercise and physical activity to your life) o Complete the study form “Your Weekly Plan” sheet (Appendix 2 – Diary – Exercise-CBT Group) Week 2 through 8 • Revise “Your Weekly Plan” every week • Self-monitor progress using exercise calendar o Review “Your Progress” sheet (Appendix 2 – Diary – Exercise-CBT Group) • Receive $[ADDRESS_1252642] 5 of 7 days (or equivalent to 70% of days for the week) Prior to the intervention, physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894001] (PI: [INVESTIGATOR_894002]) who has developed and implemented a cognitive behavioral intervention protocol for exercise intervention for use by [CONTACT_894034] 
 [ADDRESS_1252643] will review the health status of the participant, evaluate their home environment to identify safe areas for exercise, and teach safety tips and warning symptoms (e.g., chest pain or pressure, severe dyspnea, left shoulder or arm pain, indigestion, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], lightheaded-ness, dizziness, and headache).  Participants will be instructed to begin slowly at a low level of effort and gradually increase the intensity according to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s guidance.  Whenever available, we will engage caregivers or family members in supervising self-exercise.  Blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse oximetry will be monitored during the physical therapy sessions to assess the appropriateness of exercise. A research assistant who is unaware of the treatment assignment will monitor adverse events weekly using a standardized checklist (section 9; see Appendix 3).  Nonetheless, the participants may volunteer adverse events.  In addition, adverse events may occur during the exercise session.  In the case of adverse events, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894003], in consultation with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_894004].  Participants and their caregiv-ers will be instructed to activate the emergency medical service for serious adverse events that require immediate medical attention.  All adverse events will be reported to the PI.  If the severity of adverse events is high enough to require medical attention, we will obtain medical clearance from the participant’s physi-cian.  Cardiac-related issues will require clearance from the participant’s cardiologist and non-cardiac is-sues will require clearance from the participant’s primary care physician. 6.1.4. Summary of tasks at each home visit A study physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894005]: • Reviewing the participant’s diary for progress since the last session and provide feedback. • Before exercise, checking vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation) and checking for any change in health status (contraindication for exercise). • Providing an individualized exercise training session for 40 minutes  • Providing a cognitive behavioral session for 20 minutes  • Revising the individualized exercise plan, if necessary. • Reinforcing safety precautions and the procedure for emergency study contact. • Scheduling the next session  6.2. HOME-BASED EXERCISE ALONE 6.2.1. Schedule and contents of individualized exercise program The home visit schedule, exercises, and individualized progression protocol will be identical to those out-lined in the home-based exercise with cognitive behavioral interventions in section 6.1.1.  Participants will be provided with daily exercise tracking sheet and adverse event reporting log.  However, the participants will not receive any cognitive behavioral interventions.  The duration of exercise session will be [ADDRESS_1252644] will be responsible for the following tasks at each home visit: • Reviewing the participant’s diary for progress since the last session and provide feedback. • Before exercise, checking vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation) and checking for any change in health status (contraindication for exercise). • Providing Individualized exercise training session for 40 minutes  • Revising the individualized exercise plan, if necessary. • Reinforcing safety precautions and the procedure for emergency study contact. • Scheduling the next session 6.3. ATTENTION CONTROL EDUCATION INTERVENTION 6.3.1. Schedule and contents of attention control educational intervention Participants randomized to the attention control group will receive written instruction on general exercise at the time of discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894006] (this information is given to all cardiac patients).  After discharge, a health care professional (MD investigator or physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]) will call the participant weekly for a period of 8 weeks to teach general tips about exercise and diet (Table 4 and Appendix 4) (source: https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/).  No recommendations for a specific exercise program will be made, except for walking [ADDRESS_1252645] approx-imately 30 minutes and will cover the following 8 topi[INVESTIGATOR_1102] (4 exercise tips alternating with 4 healthy eating tips).  However, they may receive physical therapy outside the study if deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_24018].  This will be recorded. Table 4.

Preventing and monitoring adverse events Although the educational intervention for the attention control group does not recommend a specific exer-cise program, it is possible that education on the beneficial effects of exercise and lifestyle may increase participants’ physical activity level.  Therefore, adverse events can occur in the participants in the attention 
 [ADDRESS_1252647] (section 9; see Appendix 3), the participants may volunteer adverse events during the educational intervention.  In this situation, the study physician or health care professional who makes the call will determine the seriousness of the event and recommend the best course of action, in consultation with the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1660] a licensed physician in the research team.  Participants and their caregivers will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_894035].  All adverse events will be reported to the PI.    6.3.3. Summary of tasks at each telephone call A health care professional will be responsible for the following tasks at each telephone call: • Deliver education intervention (30 minutes). • Reinforce safety precautions and knowledge about emergency study contact.  7. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT 7.1. ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE Patients who were dis-enrolled due to rehabilitation discharge (this is an exclusion criterion) will no longer be included in the outcome follow-up.  After 4 weeks and 8 weeks of discharge (beginning of week 5 and week 9), all participants will be evaluated at home by a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541] (see Study Endpoint section below) (Table 5). Time on study will be counted from the date of first intervention visit or call.  This will be used to schedule the subsequent visit schedule and outcome assessment schedule. Table 5.

BLINDING OF OUTCOME ASSESSORS A physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894008].  In the intervention group, this physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894009].  Before the assessment, we will remind the participants not to reveal their group assignment to maintain blinding.  We will also keep track of blinding efficacy by [CONTACT_1583] a data element for the maintenance of blinding status in the Outcome Assessment form (Appendix 1). 7.3. MAXIMIZING RETENTION To maximize retention, we will accommodate the participant’s personal preference in scheduling home visits and telephone calls.  We will provide a schedule and reminders for the next home visit (intervention group) and subsequent telephone calls (attention control group).   8. STUDY ENDPOINTS 8.1. PRIMARY ENDPOINT The primary endpoint is the change in the LLFDI-CAT or LLFDI score, a self-reported measure of physical functioning and disability.  The LLFDI-CAT has 2 domains: activity limitation domain and participation re-striction domain.  The score ranges from [ADDRESS_1252650]-hoc outcome measure (section 8.2.3).   8.2. SECONDARY ENDPOINTS The following secondary endpoints will be measured at baseline and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after dis-charge.  We will calculate the change from the baseline to 8 weeks to determine the efficacy of the inter-vention.   1) Change in the SPPB: The SPPB is a simple, standardized, objective assessment of lower extremity function, which is highly correlated with frailty.28-31   o Measurement: balance (0-4), gait speed (0-4), and chair stand score (0-4) (Table 6) o Range: 0-12 points o Interpretation: higher values indicate better function.   o Clinically important change: 1 point36,37 Table 6.

EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS The following exploratory endpoints will be measured at baseline and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after dis-charge.  We will calculate the change from baseline to 8 weeks to determine the efficacy of the intervention. 1) Change in MMSE or TICS: a measure of global cognitive function o Measurement: MMSE or TICS standard form (purchased from PAR, Inc) 
 20 o Range: 0-30 o Interpretation: higher values indicate better cognitive function. o Clinically important change: ≥2 points based on reliable change index39 2) Change in NYHA functional class (range: 1-4) o Measurement: a questionnaire to assess the extent of physical activity limitation due to heart failure o Range: 1-4 o Interpretation: higher values indicate more severe limitations. o Clinically important change: ≥1 class 3) Change in SEE o Measurement: Self-Efficacy Scale for Exercise33 o Range: 0-90 o Interpretation: higher values indicate higher self-efficacy. o Clinically important change: NA 4) Change in OEE o Measurement: Outcome Expectation for Exercise34 o Range: 1-5 o Interpretation: higher values indicate stronger outcome expectations. o Clinically important change: NA 8.3. POST-HOC ENDPOINT Because the primary outcome measure, LLFDI-CAT score, could not be analyzed, we calculated a disability score from 7 activities of daily living, 7 instrumental activities of daily living, and 8 Rosow-Breslaw and Nagi physical tasks.  The score indicates the number of activities that a person requires help from another person to perform.  It ranges from 0 (no disability) to 22 (total dependence), with a clinically important change of 1 activity.  This measure has been used in previous studies.40  We will examine the correlation between the LLFDI baseline scores and the disability score (see section 10.1). 8.4. TIMING OF OUTCOME ASSESSMENT The 4-week outcome assessment will take place during Week 5.  The 8-week outcome assessment will take place during Weeks 9-10.  Time on study will be counted from the date of first visit.   9. SAFETY MONITORING AND ADVERSE EFFECTS 9.1. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  For this study, the following standard adverse event definitions are used: • Adverse events: Any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associ-ated with the use of the study intervention, regardless of whether it is considered related to the study intervention. • Serious adverse event: Any adverse event that results in death, life-threatening experiences, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_13266], persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
 21 • Unanticipated problems: Any experience that 1) is unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency, given the research procedures described in the protocol document and the characteris-tics of the study population; 2) is related or possibly related to participation in the research; 3) suggests that the research places participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was previ-ously recognized. Adverse events are graded according to the following scale: • Mild: An experience that is transient, and requires no special treatment.  The experience does not generally interfere with usual daily activities. • Moderate: An experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments.  The experience impacts usual daily activities. • Severe: An experience that requires therapeutic intervention.  The experience interrupts usual daily activities.  If hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) is required for treatment, it becomes a severe adverse event. The study uses the following adverse event attribution scale: • Not related: The adverse event is clearly not related to the study procedures (i.e., another cause of the event is most plausible and/or a clinically plausible temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the event). • Possibly related: An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the initiation of study procedures, but that could readily have been produced by a number of other factors. • Related: The adverse event is clearly related to study procedures. A research assistant who is unaware of treatment assignment will interview participants via telephone weekly to assess adverse events using a standardized checklist (see Appendix 3).  If a participant reports adverse events during the intervention session (to a physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_253730] a health care professional), these adverse events will be reported to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2394] a weekly basis.   Severe adverse events and unanticipated problems will be reported to the IRB, safety officer, and NIA within 24 hours.  In addition, all adverse events will be reported according to the IRB guidelines. 9.2. DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN Patients who were dis-enrolled due to rehabilitation discharge (per exclusion criterion), will no longer be included in adverse event data collection.   A. PARTICIPANT SAFETY A1. Potential Risks and Benefits for Participants The potential risks to study participants include a modest risk of physical harm, such as musculoskeletal pain, falls, or cardiac events from low-intensity exercise intervention.  Loss of confidentiality is another potential risk.  We do not anticipate any psychological, financial, or legal risks. The potential benefits to study participants include improvement in their physical function in response to our study intervention.  In addition, participants in the intervention group will receive a weekly incentive of $10 for achieving high adherence for 8 weeks.  All participants will be paid for $[ADDRESS_1252651] Study Risks Informed consent process: A study team member will screen inpatient list of the cardiology service daily to identify eligible patients.  Age, home address, and procedure note will be reviewed for assessment of eligibility.  Potentially eligible patients will be approached 1-2 days prior to or on the day of discharge.  After explaining the study objectives, interventions, procedures, and potential risks and benefits, MD investiga-tors will obtain a written informed consent.  Any questions from the participant or their proxy will be an-swered.  This process will be documented in the patient’s medical record. Expected adverse events: The following adverse events can occur during study procedures or interven-tions. • Fall and fall-related injury: the expected risk is low to moderate. • Musculoskeletal pain (new or worsening): the expected risk is moderate. • Cardiovascular events including angina, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke: the expected risk is very low. • Other symptoms including chest pain, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], or syn-cope: the expected risk is low. Protection against risk: Before obtaining consent, the research team will contact [CONTACT_102]’s attending physician to obtain medical clearance for the patient to participate in exercise.  To minimize physical harm, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894010]’s physical function, level of confidence, and home environment.  Prior to each exercise session, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894011]-ipants to express any concerns about exercise and teach them safe exercise techniques.  In the case of adverse events, the physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894012] (or caregiver) will be instructed to contact a study physician for any adverse events and emergency medical services (EMS) for serious adverse events.  These procedures will prevent or mitigate the consequences of adverse events.  If the participants are evaluated in the emergency department or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894013], the research team will contact [CONTACT_2299]’s treating physician to obtain permission before resuming our study inter-vention. B. INTERIM ANALYSIS Since this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], no interim analysis will be performed.  Data analysis will be performed after study enrollment is complete. C. DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING The PI [INVESTIGATOR_894014], that all participants meet eligibility criteria, and that the study is conducted according to the IRB-approved research plan.  Because this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], a formal Data and Safety Monitoring Board will not be formed; instead, a safety officer will be designated. Per NIA guideline, [CONTACT_894047], a geriatrician at Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], will be a new safety officer who will be responsible for study oversight. C1. Frequency of Data and Safety Monitoring 
 [ADDRESS_1252652] (number of potential patients screened, number of patients who provided informed consent, number of drop-out, and potential protocol deviations) on a weekly basis.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_894015]-time and in aggre-gate on a weekly basis.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_894016]-time.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_705019], adverse events, serious adverse events, and unanticipated problems are reported to the IRB; serious adverse events and unanticipated problems that are likely to be related to the study intervention are reported to the safety officer and NIA.  The safety officer will review the study progress and status and adjudicate adverse events every [ADDRESS_1252653] reviewed by [CONTACT_894036]. BWH is responsible to report all AEs to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_894017]. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_894018], adverse events, serious adverse events, and unanticipated problems are reported to the IRB; serious adverse events and unanticipated problems are reported to the safety officer and NIA.   C2. Content of Data and Safety Monitoring Report The content of the data and safety monitoring report will include accrual, baseline characteristics, efficacy data on primary and secondary outcomes, and adverse events. C3. DSMB/Safety Officer A formal Data Safety Monitoring Board will not be formed for this multi-center pi[INVESTIGATOR_894019].  Instead, a physician who is not directly involved in this study will be identified for the safety officer role. C4. Conflict of Interest for DSMB/Safety Officer The safety officer should have no direct involvement with the study investigators or intervention.  The safety officer will declare any affiliations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and any other rela-tionship that could be perceived as a conflict of interest related to the study and/or associated with com-mercial interests pertinent to study objectives. C5. Protection of Confidentiality To protect confidentiality, data will be recorded in paper forms or using tablet computers.  Data at all sites will be entered into the secure REDCap database for data management and tracking purpose.  Paper records from all sites will be stored in a locked cabinet within the investigator’s office.  Only IRB-approved study personnel will have access to individually identifiable private information for the purpose of data col-lection, contact [CONTACT_894037].  All research personnel will have up-to-date training on human subject research. C6. DSMB/Safety Officer Responsibility  • Review the research protocol, informed consent documents and plans for data safety and monitor-ing • Recommend subject recruitment be initiated after receipt of a satisfactory protocol • Evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and timeliness, recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, performance of the trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome 
 24 • Consider factors external to the study when relevant information becomes available, such as sci-entific or therapeutic developments that may have an impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial • Review study performance, make recommendations and assist in the resolution of problems re-ported by [CONTACT_976] • Protect the safety of the study participants • Report to NIA on the safety and progress of the trial • Make recommendations to the NIA and PI [INVESTIGATOR_201127], termination or other modifica-tions of the trial based on the observed beneficial or adverse effects of the treatment under study; and • Ensure the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring   10. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 10.1. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN The analyst who will conduct statistical analysis will be blinded to the group assignment.  To ensure that randomization is properly conducted, we will check the balance in health status, including the measures of physical performance and functional status between the [ADDRESS_1252654], or Fisher’s chi-square tests. We will assess the Spearman correlation coefficient between the disability score and the LLFDI-CAT score from baseline. High correlation supports that the disability score can be a reasonable alternative post-hoc outcome measure.  Aim 1 (home-based exercise combined vs. education): In analyses for primary endpoint (LLFDI-CAT or LLFDI score), secondary endpoints (SPPB score, 2-minute walk test distance, and dominant handgrip strength), and exploratory endpoints (MMSE or TICS score, NYHA class, SEE, and OEE), we will use a linear mixed effects model that models the outcomes as a function of time indicators (at 4 weeks and 8 weeks) and treatment-by-time interaction terms, with a random intercept.  The treatment indicator is not included in the model because the baseline value of the outcome is assumed to be equal in an RCT.  The main treatment effect will be determined based on the treatment-by-time interaction term for 8 weeks (b4).  The analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. ![#!]=&!+(")*+,#$$%	'+	(()*+,#$$%	)+(*).,/)+,0)∗)*+,#$$%	'+	(').,/)+,0)∗)*+,#$$%	) As a secondary analysis, we will include baseline variables that were not adequately balanced (standard-ized difference >0.1) in the regression model.  As exploratory analysis, the Spearman correlation between the LLFDI-CAT or LLFDI change and the SPPB score change over 8 weeks will be examined.  [Revised 06/08/2017] As a pre-specified subgroup analysis, we will examine whether the effect of the home-based exercise program combined is different by [CONTACT_894038] (median value to define the subgroup).   Aim 2 (home-based exercise with cognitive behavioral intervention vs. home-based exercise alone): We will use a linear mixed effects model that models the outcomes as a function of time indicators (at 4 weeks and 8 weeks) and treatment-by-time interaction terms, with a random intercept.  The treatment indi-cator is not included in the model because the baseline value of the outcome is assumed to be equal in an 
 [ADDRESS_1252655] will be determined based on the treatment-by-time interaction term for 8 weeks.  The analysis will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle.  As a secondary analy-sis, we will include baseline variables that were not adequately balanced (standardized difference >0.1) in the model.  We will assess the effect of cognitive behavioral intervention on the change in self-efficacy and outcome expectation over the 8-week period by [CONTACT_2329] a linear mixed effects model that includes time indi-cators (at 4 weeks and 8 weeks) and treatment-by-time interaction terms, with a random intercept. 10.2. SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION Since a pi[INVESTIGATOR_894020], this study is not powered to test a minimal clinically meaningful effect of an intervention.  Nonetheless, we provide power calculations under the assumption that the primary endpoint, LLFDI-CAT or LLFDI, has a standard deviation of 10 at a given time,26,41 low to moderate within-individual correlation ranging from 0.10 to 0.40, and dropout rate of 20% in each group.  Type 1 error rate is set to 0.05.  The aim 1 of our study (home-based exercise vs. education) will have 66-83% power to detect an effect size of 10 (equivalent of [ADDRESS_1252656] deviation).  The aim 2 (home-based exercise with cognitive behavioral intervention vs. home-based exercise alone) will have 53-71% power to detect an effect size of 10.  The estimation was done using GLIMMPSE (glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org).42  As this is a small exploratory study, we will not per-form any interim analysis. Table 7.

As we presented in our unpublished preliminary data (Figure 1), patients show decline in physical function and disability.  Low adherence to center-based exercise programs or no exercise will result in more progressive functional decline.  Loss of confidentiality is another potential risk.  We do not anticipate any psychological, financial, or legal risks. 11.2. ADEQUACY OF PROTECTION AGAINST RISKS The physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894010]’s physical function, the level of confidence, and home environment.  Prior to each exercise session, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_894021].  In the case 
 [ADDRESS_1252659] or the participant (or caregiver) will be instructed to contact a study physi-cian for any adverse events and emergency medical services for serious adverse events.  These proce-dures will prevent or mitigate the consequences of adverse events.   We will collect information on health status based on in-person and telephone assessments and review of medical records.  This information will be recorded on paper forms or using tablet computers.  Data at all sites will be entered into the secure REDCap database for data management and tracking purposes.  Paper records at all sites will be stored in a locked cabinet within the investigator’s office.  Only IRB-approved study personnel will have access to individually identifiable private information for the purpose of data col-lection, contact [CONTACT_894037].  All research personnel will have up-to-date training on human subject research. 11.3. POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH TO HUMAN SUB-JECTS AND OTHERS The proposed research will provide essential information for the future design of a large clinical trial that examines the effect of a home-based exercise intervention on the functional status and quality of life in multimorbid frail older patients undergoing TAVR.  Under the current standard of care, TAVR patients con-tinue to experience functional decline and disability.  Thus far, there is a paucity of rehabilitation interven-tions that have proven effective.  As such, patients may benefit from our study intervention.  The potential benefit is likely to outweigh the modest risk of physical harms from exercise.  In addition, participants in the intervention group will receive a weekly incentive of $10 for achieving high compliance for 8 weeks.  All participants will be paid for $[ADDRESS_1252660] risk of physical harm to participants.  12. MULTI-CENTER PLAN BIDMC will serve as a coordinating center. Currently, Brigham and Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_894022]. They will be recruiting patients from their center, consenting, and conducting baseline visits at BWH. Their physical therapy interventions will occur through HSL.BWH Research assistants will also conduct the follow-up phone calls for their enrolled participants. The plan for monitoring the research activities at the BWH site is as follows: 1. Both BWH and BIDMC sites will have regular conference calls to review progress and enrollment, database entries, and AE reporting for the BWH site. As the overseeing site, BIDMC is responsible for maintaining protocols and study procedures, as well as informing BWH of new procedures as they occur. This will be done through monthly conference calls, as well as emails, to notify BWH of all study changes. 
 27 2. BWH personnel will be required to complete training in the study procedure and REDcap per BIDMC protocol. BWH will be required to enter all patient screens, participant’s data and other pertinent documentation for all study visits into REDcap. The overseeing PI [INVESTIGATOR_894023]-mation that will be entered at the BWH site. 3. AE reporting at BWH  will follow the same rules as those outlined for BIDMC . For mild, moderate events and severe AEs, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_894024], unanticipated problems and adverse events, that occur at BWH by [CONTACT_894039] a bi-weekly meeting with both BIDMC and BWH study teams in attendance. All reportable events occurring at BWH will be reported to the CCI in accordance with reporting requirements. All AEs that are recorded by [CONTACT_20826][INVESTIGATOR_894025]. 4. The study monitors will be a research assistant and nurse from BIDMC. They will conduct on-site monitoring visits as indicated below and will also periodically review the BWH data in REDcap after 10 patients are enrolled. Monitoring visits will verify that study protocols are followed (including adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria and proper execution of study procedures), that proper consenting processes are used, verify all entries in REDcap by [CONTACT_894040]-tation and review records to ensure that all adverse events are reported in a timely manner to the study PI [INVESTIGATOR_894026],as appropriate. Monitoring visits will occur at the following time points: • An on-site monitoring visit will be performed after the first participant is enrolled • An on-site monitoring visit will be performed after the subsequent 2-3 participants are enrolled. • Monitoring after initial enrollment will occur quarterly unless more frequent monitoring is warranted due to non-compliance with protocol. A written monitoring report will be provided to BWH and BIDMC CCI sites.  13. REFERENCES 1. Kodali SK, Williams MR, Smith CR, et al.

Background, Rationale and Context 
The prevalence of obesity and its detrimental health effects are increasing rapi[INVESTIGATOR_406304].1–5 
Medical complications associated with excess fat mass highlight the need to treat obesity in this age group;6 yet, 
intentional weight loss (WL) remains controversial.7–[ADDRESS_512319] in part, from loss of bone 
mineral density (BMD) known to accompany overall WL,11–21 and the potential exacerbation of age- related22,23 
risk of osteoporotic fracture11,24 –28 - a leading cause of injury in older adults that significantly compromises both 
quality and expectancy of life.29–[ADDRESS_512320] weight is 
regained,33–35 and bone loss may even continue at an accelerated rate among those who are successful at long -
term WL maintenance.36 Collectively, these findings provide impetus for better understanding of the 
mechanisms underlying WL-associated bone loss, particularly among older adults, so that effective intervention strategies can be designed to disrupt them. 
 Skeletal tissue is highly responsive to mechanical stress;
37 thus, WL- associated declines in mechanical 
loading likely contribute to BMD loss.16,19 Clinical trial data  consistently demonstrate that the addition of 
exercise training (designed to enhance gravitational or muscle loading38–41) to intentional WL attenuates the 
amount of bone lost compared to WL alone.42–46 We recently reported resistance exercise training (RT) is 
superior to aerobic exercise training in attenuating WL- associated bone and muscle losses, while augmenting 
loss in total body fat mass.47 However, RT was unable to fully prevent bone and muscle loss and, in agreement 
with prior findings,48 intervention effectiveness hinged significantly on exercise compliance. Although intuitive, 
this observation may be especially important for older adults who are less likely49 (i.e., unwilling or unable) to 
perform the volume and intensity of exercise necessary to preserve bone during WL. In addition, conventional 
RT often requires expensive equipment, on-site participation, and (ideally for older adults) safety supervision by [CONTACT_32341], limiting its scalability  as an intervention strategy. 
Alternately, treating WL -associated decrease in mechanical load by [CONTACT_406328]. In animal models, skeletal metabolism responds in a similar fashion to increases in actual body, or externally added, mass.
50–52 In human studies, wearing weighted vests during exercise improves 
areal BMD (aBMD) and bone turnover, as well as muscle mass and lower extremity strength.53–[ADDRESS_512321] use or 
WL plus RT on indicators of bone health and subsequent fracture risk. This is  a 12 month trial in 150 older (60-
85 years) adults with obesity (BMI=30-40 kg/m2 or BMI= 27.0-<30 kg/m² plus one risk factor) randomized to 
one of three interventions (n= 50/group): WL alone  (WL; caloric restriction targeting 10% WL  with  adequate 
calcium, vitamin D, and protein); WL plus weighted vest use ( WL+VEST;  targeting 8 hours/day, weight 
replacement titrated up to 10% WL); or, WL plus structured RT ( WL+RT ; targeting  3 sessions/week). In 
Version  11.4.2022 
 accordance with recent international  position statements on the clinical use of computed tomography (CT) of 
the hip in the management of osteoporosis,63,64 total hip trabecular volumetric BMD (vBMD) is the primary 
outcome. This outcome will be complemented by [CONTACT_406329] -related risk factors , 
including: (1) femoral neck and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_406305], cortical thickness, finite element modeling of bone strength, and regional fat and muscle volumes, measured by [CONTACT_4654]; (2) aBMD at the total hip, femoral neck, lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and distal radius; trabecular bone score; and total body fat/lean masses, measured by [CONTACT_11323] x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); (3) muscle function and strength; (4) biomarkers of bone turnover; and (5) bone-regulating hormones/cytokines known to influence bone metabolism during WL. Therefore, o ur Spe cific Aims 
are to:  
Aim 1:  Determine the effects of WL+VEST compared to WL and WL+RT on 12 month change in total hip 
trabecular vBMD. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_406306], Hypothesis 1:  Participants in the WL+VEST 
group will show attenuated losses of total hip trabecular vBMD versus WL; and Hypothesis 2:  Loss in total hip 
trabecular vBMD will be no greater in WL+VEST compared to WL+RT. 
Aim 2:  Explore the effects of WL+VEST compared to WL and WL+RT on the 12 month change in fracture-
related risk factors.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_406306], we hypothesize  that WL+VEST and 
WL+RT will demonstrate improvements in fracture -related risk factors compared to WL.  
 
Methods and Measures  
   W e will use a three group randomized design in 150 older (6 0-85 y ears), obese (BMI=30 -40 kg/m2 or 
BMI= 27.0-<30 kg/m² plus one risk factor), men and women who will undergo a [ADDRESS_512322] use added to WL  will better preserve bone health compared to WL  
alone and similarly to WL  plus a structured RT  intervention . All groups will receive the same WL  intervention 
(caloric restriction targeting 10% WL and with adequate calcium, vitamin D, and protein intake), in accordance 
with national obesity treatment guidelines.65 Thus, treatment groups are: WL alone  (WL; n=50); WL plus 
weighted vest use ( WL+VEST;  targeting 8 hours/d, weight replacement titrated up to 10% WL; n=50); or, WL 
plus structured RT ( WL+RT ; targeting 3 sessions/w eek; n=50) ; Table 1 . All outcome assessment s occur at 
baseline, six , and 12 month s.

Schedule of assessment visits  
Those who pass phone screening will be scheduled for a screening visit (SV1) which is conducted in the 
early morning following a [ADDRESS_512329]. Before any data collection, participants provide written informed 
consent and complete a HIPAA authorization form in accordance with our IRB policy. At this visit, weight and height will be measured to calculate BMI. Individuals who meet the BMI criteria will be queried on demographic information and medical history, undergo medical assessments including  a blood pressure and 
Version  11.4.2022 
 pulse check, comprehensive review of medications, and a fasting blood draw (comprehensive metabolic panel 
and complete blood count); the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_136912] (CES -D)66 and the Montreal 
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)[ADDRESS_512330] impaired cognitive 
function (MoCA score ≥ 20). Individuals with clinically  abnormal results at screening will be referred to their 
primary care providers with their permission. 
Potential participants will also be  familiarized with the resistance training protocol and  asked to 
complete a dietary and VEST run- in to determine their ability to comply with the intervention protocols. For the 
dietary run-in, all participants will be provided with and oriented to the OPTAVIA® Optimal Weight 4 & 2 & 1 Plan® guide, sample meal plans, 3 one-day dietary trackers, a sampling of 12 OPTAVIA “Fuelings” (meal replacement products), [ADDRESS_512331] Satisfaction Forms, asked to follow the OPTAVIA Optimal Weight 4 
& 2 & [ADDRESS_512332] for 8 hours/day for 12 months, if randomized to that arm (SV2).  
Eligible participants will undergo further testing  at two additional screening visit s (SV2 , SV3 ) prior to 
randomization (using a web-based system, stratified by [CONTACT_46135]) and intervention start, with outcome assessments repeated at 6 and 12 month testing sessions (s ee Table 3 for a detailed assessment 
timeline). Briefly, outcome measure assessments include: anthropometric measures, physical function testing 
(grip strength, leg strength, walking tests, stair climb) , resting metabolic rate,  accelerometry , imaging (DXA and 
CT), self -reported  fatigue,  fatigability , and pain, physical activity, and self- efficacy, and blood storage.  
 Following state and institutional guidelines, modifications to screening and assessment visits will occur 
initially, and be conducted with as limited participant contact [CONTACT_406334], to ensure the safety of staff and participants, and to decrease the risk of exposure to COVID-19.  Modifications will include dividing SV1 into two separate visits: SV1 and SV1-A. Those who pass SV1, will be scheduled for a remote screening visit (SV1-A) to be conducted by [CONTACT_648]. At this remote  visit, individuals will be querie d on medical history, 
comprehensive review of medications, physical activity status, and the Center for Epi[INVESTIGATOR_67905] (CES -D). Additional modifications to assessment visits  (SV3, FV2, and FV4) and 
intervention (INT) will include the administration of certain questionnaires and surveys by [CONTACT_648] (see Table 3  
for specific questionnaires and surveys). When permissible by [CONTACT_406335], in-person contact [CONTACT_406336] . Visits will revert back to the original protocol as described 
above and in Table 3, and these changes will no longer be in effect.   
Study Interventions  
Contact [CONTACT_406337] (M onths 1-6) and the reduced contact [CONTACT_406338] (Months 7-12) are summarized in Table 1  above. 
 
Weight Loss Intervention (WL; provided to all groups). All participants will undergo a dietary WL  intervention 
designed to elicit behavioral changes leading to decreased caloric in take sufficient to result in a 10% loss of 
initial body mass ( 10 kg for a 100 kg individual). This degree of WL is entirely feasible within this timeframe , 
and we have prior success in achieving this goal in  older adults.67–69 The WL intervention includes the use of a 
partial meal replacement (MR) program, group nutrition education, state-of-the-art methods for promoting WL based on the group dynamics literature, social cognitive theory, and strategies that optimize self-regulation.
70–72 
All participants will be asked to initially follow the OPTAVIA® Optimal Weight 4 & 2 & 1 Plan®. This is a portion-controlled, reduced calorie (1100-1300 calories/day) weight loss meal plan and includes consumption of a total of 4 OPTAVIA MRs, 2 self-prepared lean and green meals, and 1 Healthy Snack per day. Each of the OPTAVIA MRs contain ~90-[ADDRESS_512333] 20% of the daily value for 24 vitamins and minerals (including calcium and vitamin D), and contain GanadenBC30 probiotic cultures. All OPTAVIA MRs share a similar nutritional profile, allowing them to be used interchangeably, and will be shipped directly to participants. Participants will purchase and prepare ingredients for the foods for the lean and green meals on their own.  Each lean and green meal will consist of 5-[ADDRESS_512334] of a self- selected serving 
Version  11.4.2022 
 of fruit, dairy, or grain purchased by [CONTACT_2299], or one of OPTAVIA’s portable, pre-portioned, ready- to-eat 
snacks can be used as a healthy snack.  Participants will be guided by [CONTACT_406339].   Once a participant has met or exceeded 10% weight loss for 3 consecutive group session weigh- ins, they will 
be given the option to transition to the OPTAVIA Lean & Green Life™ maintenance meal plan. Any individual for whom additional weight loss appears to be a safety concern will be directed to transition to the Lean & Green Life Plan immediately.  The Lean & Green Life Plan takes into consideration a participant’s individual calorie needs (based on total energy expenditure and monitoring of weight), builds on the principles learned during weight loss, and offers flexibility while simultaneously providing boundaries for those who may need them. The Lean & Green Life Plan includes a transitional period during which individuals gradually increase their daily calories and decrease the number of OPTAVIA MRs consumed.  At the end of the transitional period, participants will be recommended to eat 3 OPTAVIA MRs, 2 self- prepared lean and green meals (with 
expanded lean offerings to include more plant-based proteins, such as beans and lentils) and make up the balance of their caloric needs with Healthy 100’s (whole food and beverage options derived from the Diabetes Exchange List, each with approximately100 calories and up to 15 g of carbohydrate). A list of such foods/beverages that meet the requirements for Healthy 100’s will be provided to participants to facilitate their 
food choices.  Participants who would prefer to decrease or discontinue using the OPTAVIA MRs during maintenance can substitute them with the equ ivalent number of Healthy 100’s (e.g., 1 OPTAVIA MR can be 
swapped for 1 additional Healthy 100’s) while on the Lean & Green Life Plan.     In addition to receiving dietary counseling, all participants will be asked to  attend virtual or in -person 
behavioral counseling group sessions led by [CONTACT_380853]. These sessions will be held weekly for the first 6 months and bi-weekly for the remainder of the study to provide participants an opportunity to review specific questions and problems. The education and counseling component of the intervention will emphasize instruction in making healthy, lower-calorie food choices while teaching changes in behavior al habits to promote WL  and 
prevent weight regain.
73 Specific emphasis will be placed on the acquisition and use of self- management skills, 
particularly self -monitoring of diet and weight, and  achieving 150 minutes of aerobic activity/ week, in 
accordance with national guidelines.65,74 Throughout the 12 month WL phase, participants will be asked to track 
their food/ beverage intake (including the number of meal replacements consumed each day) daily for the first 
three months and then on a reduced schedule as warranted. These will be reviewed routinely by [CONTACT_406340] . Body weight will be  measured and recorded at all group session s to provide additional 
feedback and to increase motivation. Official study weights will occur at SV3 , FV2, and FV4. If it is evident 
(either through review of diet records or inadequate WL) that participants are struggling to meet their WL goals additional individual counseling sessions with the RD will be held to improve compliance. At FV1 and FV3, 
participants in this group will be asked to complete a program evaluation form to solicit feedback on overall WL program satisfaction, desired future usage, and product preferences. Periodically throughout intervention, 
participants will be asked to rate their confidence (i.e., self -efficacy) in meeting the demands of the intervention 
they are receiving . They will also be asked to report changes in their health and medication.  
 Weight Loss + Weighted Vest Intervention  (WL+VEST) . The WL component of the intervention is described 
above. Participants assigned to the WL+VEST  group will each receive an appropriately- sized weighted vest f or 
the duration of the [ADDRESS_512335]  fabric and design fits comfortably over or under clothing 
(individual weights are ¼ inch thick), allows for full range of motion and movement, and full chest expansion without restricting breathing. An unloaded vest weighs about one pound and is available in several sizes, including XXL. The vest firmly and evenly distributes weight over the body’s core when the small (about the size of a domino pi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]) 2.[ADDRESS_512336] on a daily basis, progressing to a goal of 8 hours /day (by [CONTACT_5875] 2) during their most active 
part of the day. Initially, the vest will be unloaded (e.g., one-pound vest only without added blocks). The vest weight will then be incremented according to each participant’s rate of WL  based on their weekly (first 6 
months) and biweekly  (final 6 months) body weight assessments. As body mass is lost, the weight of the vest 
will be increased (with the 2.25 oz weight blocks) to replace the lost weight. The goal is to maintain the 
Version  11.4.[ADDRESS_512337] pockets during the weekly/bi weekly  group sessions. These devices collect 
accelerations across the X, Y, and Z axes  and conventional wear- time algorithms will be applied to identify 
periods of non- wear time o f the vest . Participants will also  keep a daily log to record the time worn, vest weight, 
and any complications or comments related to the vest use , with overall satisfaction  of vest use assessed  at 
study close . Intervention st aff will monitor and discuss accelerometer output and daily logs at the end of each 
group session , intervening to enhance compliance to the vest protocol when necessary.  
 Weight Loss + Structured Resistance Exercise Training Intervention (WL+RT). The WL component of the intervention is described above. Participants assigned to the WL+RT group will undergo a progressive RT intervention designed to elicit adaptations in the musculoskeletal system. Exercise sessions will take place on three non-consecutive days/week, and will be supervised by [CONTACT_406341]. The RT program is based on recent  guidelines with respect to 
intensity, number of repetitions, exercises,  sets, and days per week.
[ADDRESS_512338] form in a single repetition (1RM) will be used to prescribe intensity. Progression of intensity, repetitions and sets will be individualized and gradual to allow participants  to familiarize themselves with the equipment, 
minimize muscle soreness and reduce potential for injury. The training goal is for participants to complete three sets of 10-12 repetitions for 8 different exercises at 70 -75% 1RM for that given exercise. Participants will be 
instructed to rest for approximately one minute betwee n each set.  The resistance will be incremented when a 
participant can complete [ADDRESS_512339] of all assessments before data collection.  Participants will be instructed to wear appropriate and comfortable clothing, and standardized written instructions will be provided prior to each study visit.

 Study Measure(s)  
 
Methods for Primary Outcome Measure Assessment. Our study is powered to detect group differences in our primary outcome of [ADDRESS_512340] scan including  the femurs and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_406307], 6, 
and 12 months on a 64- slice scanner (PET/CT  GE Discovery MI scanner  housed within the WFSM Translational 
Imaging Program ). Scans will be acquired with SFOV [ADDRESS_512341] reconstruction and 
secondary reconstruction using a bone algorithm.
 The scan will cover from the top of L1 through 3 cm below the 
mid-shaft of the femurs (mid-shaft defined as the midpoint between the superior aspect of the greater trochanter and the 
inferior aspect of the lateral condyle). T he 5-port bone mineral calibration phantom (Mindways CT, Austin, TX ) 
will be imaged in every scan  and must be positioned to cover the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_406308]. In 
rare instances where the calibration phantom does not properly cover these regions, a scan may need to be repeated for proper data collection. The repeat scan will add approximately 975 millirem of radiation or less to the participant’s radiation dose. Participants will have the option to decline a repeat scan, if it is determined that one is needed. In an effort to avoid repeated scans, trained study staff are present at each scan to ensure that the CT protocol is administered correctly. However, there may be times where study staff are not able to be present, and a re -scan may be needed if the scan i s not acquired properly during these instances. Quality assurance of the 
CT system will be performed according to manufacturer specifications.  vBMD Acquisition and Assessment. vBMD of the total hip, femoral neck, and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_406309] (Mindways, Austin, TX). The software automatically segments the proximal femur 
to obtain total hip trabecular vBMD (primary outcome measure), and total hip cortical and integral vBMD. The proximal femur is also automatically divided into anatomical compartments to measure trabecu lar, cortical, and 
integral vBMD of the femoral neck. Bilateral femoral vBMD averages will be reported,  when possible. Regions 
of interest (ROIs) are automatically placed within a mid -vertebral slice at each vertebral level to obtain lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_406310]. Segmentations and ROIs will be manually adjusted as appropriate. The CT Hounsfield units (HU) a re calibrated using the 5 -port bone mineral phantom to derive equivalent aqueous potassium 
phosphate density measures of vBMD in mg/cm
3. Elasticity -density relationships will be used to derive subject-
specific material properties from vBMD measurements for  inclusion in finite element ( FE) models.75–77 
 Muscle cross -sectional area (CSA), muscle density, and intermuscular fat CSA will be measured for the total 
abdominal muscles and psoas muscle at a single CT slice at the L3 vertebra level. Visceral and subcutaneous fat CSAs will also be measured in this slice. Mid -thigh muscle CSA, muscle density, subcutaneous fat CSA, and 
intermuscular fat CSA will be assessed at the mid -shaft position defined as the midpoint between the superior 
aspect of the greater trochanter and the inferior aspect of the lateral condyle measured on an anterior -posterior 
scout of the entire femur. Muscle and fat areas will be semi -automatically segmented from CT using Mimics 
software (v19, Materialise, Plymouth, MI) by [CONTACT_406342] (-190 to -30 HU) and muscle (-29 to 150 HU) and then manually refining segmentations 
 Methods for Exploratory Outcome Measure Assessment. Several exploratory fracture -related risk factors 
will be assessed , including: (1) CT -acquired femoral neck and lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_406305] (described above), cortical 
thickness, FE modeling of bone strength, and regional fat/lean volumes; (2) DXA-acquired total hip, femoral neck, lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and distal radius aBMD, trabecular bone score, and total body fat/lean masses; (3) objectively measured muscle function and strength; (4) biomarkers of bone turnover; (5) hormones and 
Version  11.4.2022 
 cytokines known to influence bone metabolism during WL; and (6) D3- Creatine derived muscle mass.  As a 
team, we have extensive experience collecting all secondary outcome measures.47,62,78,79,67,80 –[ADDRESS_512342] scans (Strad view, Cambridge University, [LOCATION_006]).
87,89,[ADDRESS_512343] blur is fit to HU intensities 
measured from a line normal to the cortical surface that passes through the soft tissue, cortex, and trabecula. Point clouds of the inner and outer cortex surfaces are output, as well as cortical thicknesses (~14,000/femur; ~3,000/ vertebrae). As we’ve done previously, a mappi[INVESTIGATOR_406311]- specific 
cortical thicknesses to each node of the cortical s hell elements in the FE models.
[ADDRESS_512344] -specific FE models of the proximal femur and lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_406312].
88,91,92 Thin -plate spline radial 
basis function interpolation and a relaxation algorithm will be used to morph an existing FE model (i.e. atlas) to a subject -specific geometry. Atlases will be the Global Human Body Models Consortium (GHBMC) M50- O 
v4.4 femur and the Total Human Model for Safety AM50 v4.02 lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].
88,91– [ADDRESS_512345] -specific FE models will 
incorporate vBMD- derived material properties and variable cortical thicknesses (see above sections). Bone 
strength will be estimated through simulation of the following experimental tests: single -limb stance, sideways 
fall, and quasi- static uniax ial vertebral compression test .
93,94 The peak fracture force or bone strength will be 
defined as the peak force recorded between the impactor and femoral head or vertebral body.  
 Regional Fat and Muscle Volumes. M uscle/fat/bone cross -talk is an emerging area of scientific inquiry,
96,97 and 
because little is known regarding the interaction of regional fat/muscle loss and bone density changes during intentional WL in older adults with obesity, this study positions us to use the CT -acquired data to  generate 
regional fat and muscle volumes, to complement DXA- acquired appendicular lean mass and visceral fat area 
(see section below) . Abdominal visceral and subcutaneous fat volumes
 will be measured using approximately 
60 slices taken within 15 mm centered at the L4–L5 level. Mid -thigh muscle volume and intermuscular fat will 
also be assessed, with mid -shaft position defined as the midpoint between the superior aspect of the greater 
trochanter and the inferior aspect of the lateral condyle measured on an anterior -posterior scout of the entire 
femur. M uscle and fat volumes will be semi- automatically segmented from CT using Mimics software (v19, 
Materialise, Plymouth, MI) by [CONTACT_406342] ( -190 to -30 HU) and muscle ( -29 to 150 HU) and then 
manually refining segmentations.  
DXA- Acquired Outcome Measures.  Areal BMD of the whole body, total hip, femoral neck, lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], and 
distal radius  will be determined by [CONTACT_751]-energy x-ray absorptiometry (iDXA, GE Medical Systems, Madison, 
WI). Coefficients of variation (CV) from repeated measurements at our institution are <2% for hip and spi[INVESTIGATOR_406313]. All scans will be performed and analyzed by [CONTACT_406343] ( ISCD ) 
trained DXA technologist, under the supervision of [CONTACT_406362]. Every scan will be examined to evaluate for proper patient positioning and analysis, and reanalysis or rescanning will be performed if necessary. Any artifacts will be noted and, if possible,  excluded from the measured region. Daily quality control scans will be 
obtained with a calibration phantom. If results are more than two SD from baseline the phantom scans will be repeated. Additional DXA-acquired measures include trabecular bone score (TBS; %CV: 3.3), obtained from the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_406314]; total body fat mass (%CV: 1.3); total body lean mass (%CV: 0.9); appendicular lean B 
Version  11.4.2022 
 mass; and visceral fat area (measured from the whole-body scan in a five cm wide region across the entire 
abdomen just above the iliac crest at a level approximate with the 4th lumbar vertebrae).  
 
Objectively Measured Muscle Function and Strength. Gait speed will be assessed using the fast [ADDRESS_512346] . The 400 meter walk tests was originally developed in Health ABC98 and used by [CONTACT_406344] .70,71,99 Participants ar e asked to walk 10 laps of a 40 meter course (20 meters out and 20 meters 
back)  as fast as possible . A script is used to standardize instructions to all participants. Participants can stop and 
rest if necessary, but are not allowed to sit, and are given a maximum of [ADDRESS_512347] are excellent .100,101 Physical performance will be assessed 
using the expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) . The expanded SPPB consists of five 
repeated chair stands, standing balance (semi - and full-tandem stands and a single leg stand for 30 seconds), a 
four meter walk to assess u sual gait speed, and a narrow four meter walk test of balance (walking at usual pace 
within lines of tape spaced 20 cm apart).102 Scores for the traditional 0-12 point SPPB can also be obtained from 
these tests. We will also assess physical performance using the Timed -Up-and- Go (TUG) . TUG measures the 
time a person takes to stand up from a standard chair, walk three  meters, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit 
down again.103 A practice trial is given, followed by [CONTACT_406345]. Stair climbing time  will be assessed by [CONTACT_250074]’s fastest time achieved to climb 12 
steps 12 step staircase in two  trials.  Lower extremity muscle strength  will be measured using an isokinetic 
dynamometer with the participant sitting and the hips and knee flexed at 90°. The dynamometer will be adjusted for each participant and all adjustments will be recorded to duplicate the position for subsequent assessments. Start and stop angles will be set at 90° and 30°. Participants will be asked to extend the knee and push as hard as possible against the resistance pad. Strength is expressed as peak torque (Nm). Grip strength  will be measured 
twice in each hand to the nearest two kg using an isometric Jamar Hydraulic Hand Dynamometer (Performance Health, Warrenville, IL) with the mean value from the stronger hand used.  
 
Biomarkers of Bone Turnover and Key Regulators of Bone Metabolism . Blood samples will be collected in the 
morning via venipuncture after an overnight fast (of ≥ 10 hours) and abstinence from physical activity for the 
previous [ADDRESS_512348]. Nicklas until use in  future assays. 
 
D3-Creatine (D3Cr) muscle mass : Participants will be asked to ingest a small tablet containing 30 mg of D3 -
creatine, prepared by [CONTACT_406346] (Berkeley, CA) to allow for a direct measure of muscle mass.  115 Participants will be given the dose at the SV2 and FV3 visits, and instructed to take the dose 
3-6 days prior to their SV3 and FV4 visits (respectively) where they will be asked to provide a fasted urine sample.  Urine will be collected either in a specimen cup and aliquoted, or will be collected directly on a filter paper strip, which will be frozen until shipment to the central lab at the University of [LOCATION_004], Berkeley for detection of labeled and unlabeled creatinine by [CONTACT_29864]/MS. 
 
Descriptive Data, Potential Covariates, and Adverse Events . Covariate assessment will occur at the 
frequency described in Table 3. Briefly, b aseline demographic data will be recorded based on participant self-
report (at baseline only). Medical information  on prior and existing co- morbidities and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_406315]-report. Collectively, this information will be used to assess  [ADDRESS_512349] medication use by [CONTACT_406347] (including nutritional supplements).  Height without shoes will be measured to the nearest 0.[ADDRESS_512350] 0.1 kilogram using a calibrated 
and certified balance beam scale. Height and body mass will be used to calculate body mass index ( BMI ). Waist 
circumference will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a Gulick -II spring -retractable steel tape. Resting 
metabolic rate  (RMR) will be measured in the morning after an overnight fast by [CONTACT_46146]. Upon 
arrival, participants are asked to lie quietly for 15-[ADDRESS_512351] 30 minutes and RMR is 
Version  11.4.2022 
 calculated using the Weir equation.  Accelerometry  will be used to objectively a ssess physical activity over a 
seven  day period at baseline, 6 and 12 months using a triaxial accelerometer and inclinometer.105 Finally, 
questionnaires assessing fatigue/ fatigability106, pain107, physical activity108, and intervention adherence self -
efficacy (with questionnaire specific to INVEST modeled on prior work109) will be assessed . If covariates are 
found to be unbalanced between groups, and related to study outcomes, these variables will be included as covariates in exploratory, secondary statistical analyses.  Lastly, adverse events will be assessed and recorded by 
[CONTACT_406348] a bi -monthly health status questionnaire. Spontaneously reported adverse events 
will also be collected and reported by [CONTACT_464]. 
 
Data and Statistical Analyses 
Data Management. Data will be collected on forms at the clinic site and transferred to a secure electronic database. Our web -based management system will assure integrity and validity. Dynamic reports and statistical 
analyses will monitor quality. A participant-based inventory system will track recruitment, retention, adhe rence, 
and missing data from entry through exit, close-out, and lock-down of final datasets.  Statistical Analyses. We  will use intention -to-treat principles in full accordance with CONSORT guidelines. 
We will monitor serious adverse events regularly to maintain up- to-date safety information for reporting to the 
DSMB. All data will undergo range checks at the time of data entry and will be examined monthly by [CONTACT_406349], unusual data needing further verification, and outliers. Plots of longitudinal observations will be used to inspect for unusual changes requiring verification against source documentation. Regression diagnostics and exploratory analyses will be performed to find appropriate transformations of variables if needed. Order of priority in choosing a transformation will be to satisfy: 1) linearity, 2) homogeneity, and 3) normality assumptions. We will attempt to identify baseline covariates that predict attrition and compliance; and if such covariates can be identified, the analyses may need to incorporate stratification by [CONTACT_46151]. In addition, following the recommendations of the [ADDRESS_512352] of missing outcomes on inference (if found to be not at random). Additionally, we will conduct sensitivity analyses of efficacy taking into account treatment compliance as a binary ( compliers defined 
as >80 % of prescribed vest wear time, >80% resistance training attendance, >80% of weight loss target) or 
continuous variable (proportion of treatment received).   Sample Size and Power. A total sample size of 150 (n= 50 per group) is optimal to test hypotheses for the 
primary study aims. Using co -primary hypotheses demands use of a conservative Bonferroni correction of 
dividing the Type I error rate ( 𝛼𝛼) in half for each aim to determine statistical significance.  
 
 Aim 1, Hypothesis 1. Based  on our preliminary 
data demonstrating effectiveness of the WL+VEST intervention in preserving total hip aBMD , as well as effect size estimates generated 
from an 18 month trial of WL versus WL+RT on total hip vBMD , we anticipate that the 
WL+VEST group will decrease 3% from a baseline total hip vBMD value of 0.300 g/cm
3 
over 12 months compared to 5.5- 6.0% decrease 
in the WL alone group, leading to a difference range of 2.5- 3.0%. In Table 4, we observe that assuming 12 
month group differences in total hip vBM D between 0. 0075 and 0.009 g/cm3, we have at least 85% power to 
detect a statistically significant difference for the primary outcome assuming common group standard deviations of 0.010 g/cm

(only total hip vBMD, which is an integral measure of the trabecular and cortical regions), the two are highly correlated, with prior studies showing enhanced responsivity of the trabecular region.
111,112 Thus, using total 
hip vBMD for our power calculations ensures adequate power for total hip trabecular vBMD as the primary outcome measure.   
Aim 1, Hypothesis 2. We anticipate that the change in total hip trabecular vBMD among the WL+VEST will be 
noninferior to the change among WL+RT. The noninferiority margin for the difference in 12-month total hip vBMD changes is - 4% of baseline or -0.012 g/cm
3, as used previously.113 Assuming 12-month equivalence 
between WL+VEST and WL+RT (i.e., WL+VEST and WL+RT 12 month mean are each 0.291 g/cm3), then a 
baseline sample size of 50 /group provides >95 % power to establish noninferiority of WL+VEST compared to 
WL+RT. This assumes 1) the same SD of change (0. 010 g/cm3) as in Hypothesis 1; 2) attrition rate is a 
conservative 15% (better retention provides higher power); and 3) the Type I error rate is 0.0125, based on the convention of using 0.[ADDRESS_512355] for the trial 
objectives. Using a margin of -2.5% of baseline (-0.0075 g/cm3) difference between WL+V EST vs WL+RT,  we 
have 85% power to establish noninferiority assuming the same SD as above (0.010 g/cm3), 15% attrition, and a 
0.[ADDRESS_512356] estimates were partially derived from DXA -measured aBMD loss 
under WL, which results in similar estimated BMD losses assumed between the two  groups. We anticipate that 
the WL+VEST group will decrease 3% from a baseline total hip aBMD value of 1.027 g/cm2 over 12 months 
compared to 5.5% decrease in the WL alone group, leading to a difference of 0.0257 g/cm2, or 2.5% of baseline. 
Using this magnitude of difference, 50 participants/group will provide 90% power to detect a statistically significant difference for the primary outcome assuming common group standard deviation of chan ge of 0.033 
g/cm
2, based on a [ADDRESS_512357] under 85% retention at  12 months using a 0.025 Type I Error rate.  
 
Aim 2, Hypothesis 2. We anticipate that the change in total hip aBMD among the WL+VEST will be noninferior 
to the change among WL+RT. The noninferiority margin (i.e. difference at which a clinically meaningful increase of nonvertebral fracture risk may occur
115) for the difference in 12 month total hip aBMD changes is -
2.13% of baseline or -0.022 g/cm2. Assuming equivalence between WL+VEST and WL+RT (i.e., WL+VEST 
and WL+RT 12 month mean are each 3% reduced from baseline (0.996 g/cm2)  as used in Hypothesis 1), then a 
baseline sample size of 50/group provides 80% power to establish noninferiority of WL+VEST compared to WL+RT such that the lower bound of the one-sided 0.9875 confidence bound of the group mean differences will be greater than a -0.022 g/cm
2 difference between WL+V EST minus WL+RT. This assumes 1) the same 
common group SD of change (0. 033 g/cm2) as in Hypothesis 1; 2) attrition rate is 15%; and 3) the Type I error 
rate is 0.0125, based on the convention of using 0.025 for a one-sided confidence interval , which is further 
divided in half due to having co-primary hypotheses. 
 
 Aim 2, All other outcomes. Due to the challenges of prespecifying noninferiority boundaries for exploratory 
outcomes, all other analyses for the second aim will focus on the three group comparisons of WL, WL+VEST, and WL+RT. Based on the same baseline sample size of 50/group (n=150 overall), we will have 80% power to detect a relatively modest effect sizes (variance of means/within -group variance) of 0.116 under the attrition 
rate of 15% assumed above, assuming 2- tailed F -test and a 0.[ADDRESS_512358] indicator for each of the three groups, adjusted for visit (6 or 12 months), visit by [CONTACT_9866], sex (to account for randomization strata) and baseline value. A contrast statement will test change in total hip trabecular vBMD  at 12 months in WL versus WL+VEST, and a statistically signi ficant difference will be 
Version  11.4.2022 
 established at  p<0.025. Next, the noninferiority of WL+VEST compared to WL+RT will be determined based 
on whether the lower bound of the one- sided confidence interval for the estimated [ADDRESS_512359] of 
WL+VEST versus WL+RT overlaps the -4.0% non-inferiority boundary for total hip trabecular vBMD. This 
will be performed using α= 0.[ADDRESS_512360]  
(and secondarily [ADDRESS_512361]) using total hip  aBMD assessed by [CONTACT_406350]. Comparisons will be 
performed for both superiority of WL+VEST vs. WL as well as noninferiority of WL+VEST vs WL+RT based on a 2.13% noninferiority margin using the methods described above. Analytic models for all other Aim [ADDRESS_512362] statements at 12 months (primarily) and 6 months (secondarily), and we will use  the partial F -test p<0.05 for significance. Significant comparisons for secondary outcomes will further 
use comparisons of all three groups at each visit using p<0.0167 for pairwise significance. Lastly, we intend to explore the associations between 6 and 12 month change in vBMD or aBMD with change in secondary outcome 
measures (i.e., DXA and CT -acquired body composition, D3Cr muscle mass, biomarkers of bone turnover, 
bone regulating hormones/cytokines) using linear regression methods and adjusted for sex and treatment group, to explore potential mechanisms underlying the treatment effect. Secondary comparisons will not be adjusted for multiplicity other than for pairwise group comparisons. Statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS v9.4 (SAS Institute, C ary, NC)  and R software.  
 
Statistical Analysis and Power Considerations for Limb Loading  Sub-Study:  
 Limb Loading Analysis : Data from the insoles will be downloaded from the smartphone and imported into 
MATLAB (Mathworks Inc, Natick, MA, [LOCATION_003]). Limb loading outcomes will include peak impact force, loading rate, impulse, and cumulative loading. Peak impact force will be calculated as the largest peak in the first 25% of all foot contacts. Loading rate will be calculated as the peak impact force divided  by [CONTACT_406351] (>10N). Impulse for each foot contact (e.g. step, exercise repetition) is the area under the force curve. Cumulative loading will be defined as the total impulse from all recorded foot c ontacts. 
These outcomes will be determined for the right limb and will be averaged for each day of use with the daily average for each metric used for data analysis.  
 Femoral Stress and Strain Analysis : The baseline subject -specific proximal femur models developed in the parent 
study will be utilized for the proposed pi[INVESTIGATOR_406317]. The “peak impact force daily average” and “loading rate 
daily average” measured by [CONTACT_406352] a “force vs. time” curve that ramps up to the peak impact force in the time from initial foot contact (time=peak impact force divided by [CONTACT_109965] r ate). The maximum femoral stress and femoral strain attained during the 
simulation will be output from the proximal femur, along with the location of those elements (e.g. femoral neck, trochanter, shaft). A strain of approximately 0.04 – 0.10% is estimated  to be the minimum effective strain required 
to prevent bone loss. Strain values derived from our simulation will be compared to these values to determine if 
daily limb loading imposes adequate strain for maintenance of BMD.  
Feasibility  Analysis : Feasibility of wearing force -sensing insoles will be assessed by [CONTACT_193531], adherence, and 
satisfaction. Recruitment rates and adherence to wearing the insoles over 4 days will be recorded, and overall satisfaction will be measured with an overall satis faction questionnaire.  
Version  11.4.2022 
  
To evaluate limb loading, an  analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to test for mean differences between groups in 
daily loading metrics (cumulative loading, peak force, loading rate, impulse). To evaluate femoral stress and strain,  an ANCOVA will also be used with femoral mechanical stress and strain as the dependent variable. In 
the event of significant differences, post-hoc independent two- sample t -tests using a Bonferroni adjusted alpha 
= 0.025 will further be tested . Fifteen participants per group provides 80% power to detect a moderate effect 
size (Variance between/Variance within) of 0.40 using a 0.05 Type I error rate and 87% retention at  6 months. Cohen’s d effect sizes will be calculated to further contextualize group differences and inform future sample size calculations. Pearson product moment will also  to explore associations between daily limb loading metrics, 
change in areal and volumetric BMD, and changes in physical function separately by [CONTACT_406353].  
Human Subjects Protection  
 
Subject Recruitment Methods : We will recruit individuals using community -based recruitment strategies 
including newspaper ads and mass mailings . We will also advertise in the Sticht Center recruitment  newsletter 
(Volunteers in Touch with an Active Lifestyle : VITAL), utilize WakeOne recruitment letters, and  participate in 
community outreach events.  
Informed Consent : Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject.  The informed consent process 
will follow the procedures of the WF SM Institutional Review Board.  The study interviewers will explain the 
purpose, methods and extent of the study to prospective participants.  The potential participant is asked to read the informed consent form and ask questions. The form is written in simple easy to understand language.  We require study staff to review all of the key aspects of the study verball y with the potential participants. Staff is 
provided with a structured checklist for this purpose. Staff is then required to question potential participants to ascertain whether s/he has understood the information.  Potential participants who are illiterat e or have impaired 
vision must have the consent read to them, followed by [CONTACT_224416], opportunity for questions, and discussion. This process will take place in a quiet, private room. A copy of the signed and dated consent form will be given to participants, and the original document will be placed in subjects’ individual study files, which will be stored in a secure location.  In compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information of the Department of Health and Human Services, we will access personal health information only after obtaining informed consent. 
 
Potential Risks: There are inherent potential risks to human subjects who participate in any research study and 
the potential risks to study participants in this study are listed below. Any injuries or illnesses (severe adverse events) during the course of a participant’s enrollment in the study are monitored regularly as described below in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan.   
Intervention risks :  
  
1) Risks of weight loss at any age include the concomitant loss of fat- free (i.e ., bone and muscle) tissue 
along with fat mass loss; and in older adults, this may exacerbate age-related risk of osteoporotic fracture. Because the individual risk of osteoporotic fracture is highest in those who are underweight, this risk is mitigated by  [CONTACT_46157]-obese and less likely to benefit from weight 
loss and excluding those who are already diagnosed with osteoporosis (identified on any of the following: participant self -reported medical history, medication use, or baseline DXA scan). Procedures 
to minimize loss of bone during the weight loss intervention include prescription of a caloric deficit that does not result in excessively rapid weight loss (e.g., >2 lb/week), recommendation to engage in daily light- to moderate- intensity  walking, in accordance with national physical activity guidelines, and 
incorporating meal replacements  and meal plans that provide adequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D 
intake.  In addition, because the vast majority of fractures occur subsequent to a fall, intervention staff 
Version  11.4.[ADDRESS_512363] week of the intervention transition phase (month 7).  
 
2)  OPTAVIA Fuelings utilize a variety of protein sources, including soy protein. Because of this, we will  
     be alert to possible soy allergies and those taking thyroid medications. Most commonly, a soy allergy  
     presents with mild signs and symptoms that may include itching, skin breakouts, or redness, nasal       congestion or digestive issues. Additionally, consuming OPTAVIA products containing soy protein may  
     decrease the body’s ab sorption of thyroid medications, such as Synthroid or Levothyroxine.  Those with  
     a mild soy allergy or intolerance, or those taking thyroid medications, will be informed  of the soy  
     ingredients in the OPTAVIA Fuelings, and will be offered soy protein- free Fuelings . Participants taking  
     thyroid medications will also be instructed  to avoid eating any Fuelings containing soy protein within  
     one to three hours before and after taking thyroid medication. Soy protein only needs to be avoided  
     around the time thyroid medications are taken.  
 
3) The risks of intervention-related problems with wearing the weighted vests may include: 1) an increased 
fall risk and 2) an exacerbation of prior conditions related to knee/back/shoulder pain. We exclude 
potential participants who report knee/back/shoulder pain with prescription medication use during the initial phone screen. Participants will also be advised to not wear the weighted vest during strenuous activities.  Additionally, at the outset of all group sessions, participants will be queried regarding 
problems or health symptoms they may be experiencing with the vest. The interventionist will record the presence or absence of such symptoms and determine whether or not the contact [CONTACT_406354], in consultation with the study physician, by a scheduled appointment with the primary care provider.  
  
4) The risks of the structured resistance exercise intervention may include: 1) musculoskeletal 
complications and muscle soreness in the early phases of the intervention, and 2), an increased fall risk. These risks are minimized since all center -based exercise sessions will be supervised by [CONTACT_406355] s who will instruct participants in proper balance safety  and footwear to use. Procedures to 
minimize musculoskeletal and cardiac injury and muscle soreness include warm-up and cool-down activities that include large muscle movements and stretching. Participants will begin with an easier exercise stimulus and will gradually increase in intensity over the first few months. Exercise physiologists, trained in cardiac life support, will supervise all c enter -based exercise sessions and 
practice codes are conducted quarterly.   
 
 Assessment risks: Health risks for each of the assessment procedures may include:  
  
1) Exposure to radiation from the DXA and CT scans. The amount of radiation that participants will 
receive from these procedures is equivalent to a uniform whole body dose of 1866 millirem. This is 
equal to 6.22 times the average yearly radiation exposure from background radiation (300 mRem). If a 
repeat CT scan is needed, participants will receive approximately 975 millirem of additional radiation , 
which would increase the uniform whole body dose of radiation to 2841 millitem. This is equal to 9.47 
times the average yearly radiation exposure from background radiation (300 mRem). The potential long-
term risk from these radiation doses is uncertain, but these doses are not  associated with any definite 
adverse effects. Thus the risk to participants, if any, is estimated to be slight.

loss of balance, or falls. Breaks will be provided to participants to minimize fatigue, and participants will be spotted during the walking tests to prevent falls and injury.    
  
3) Slight discomfort, bruising, and/or infection at the sight of puncture for blood drawing, but blood will be 
drawn only be trained and experienced phlebotomists who will minimize the discomfort as much as 
possible.  
 
4) Risks associated with  wearing the activity monitors  are minimal, but may include minor skin 
irritations.  Participants will be instructed to note these on their log and if it becomes bothersome to 
remove the device and call staff for further instructions. 
 
Safety measures during the interventions : For the dietary intervention, all study participants are monitored for 
compliance to a safe level of caloric deficit. Since the degree of bone and muscle loss is accelerated by [CONTACT_406356], all participants will be weighed weekly and if weight is being lost at a rate greater than 0.9 kg/wk (~2 lb/wk), adjustments may be made to the meal plan to increase the level of calories recommended  to 
slow down this excess rate of weight loss. As stated previously, at the outset of all group sessions, participants will be queried regarding problems or health symptoms they may be experiencing with the vest. The interventionist will record the presence or absence of such symptoms and determine whether or not the proble m 
requires medical attention and, if so, to determine whether or not the contact [CONTACT_406354], in consultation with the study physician, by a scheduled appointment with the primary care provider. Supervised RT sessions are conducted at a central location and are supervised by [CONTACT_406357]. On- site staff trained in advanced cardiac life support are available 
to deal with medical emergencies. Also, institutional and community EMS services will be activated if needed. Procedures to minimize musculoskeletal discomfort to the exercise include teaching proper warm -up and cool 
down activities and providing instruction on correct exercise techniques and fall safety. If for any reason the participant reports a fall or other injury, or chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, during a supervised RT  
session, they will be referred to their doctor, or study staff will notify  the participant’s doctor or other health 
care provider with their permission. If at any point during a RT  session, participants develop chest pain, 
shortness of breath, or dizziness, they will be instructed to stop exercise, and to contact [CONTACT_406358]. We monitor blood pres sure and heart rate before and after all supervised RT 
sessions. If an intervention-related injury or illness does occur, the study medical staff will be consulted according to the type of symptom reported. In some instances, it may be appropriate to reduce or to temporarily suspend the participant's weight loss, vest use, or RT goals. If the injury or symptoms do not resolve after an 
appropriate period of time, the participant will be referred to his/her primary care provider for further evaluation. The participant will be encouraged to follow the primary care provider's instructions regarding intervention compliance.  
  
Safety measures during the assessments : All study assessments are conducted by [CONTACT_165374]. 
Safety precautions are taken during all testing by [CONTACT_126068][INVESTIGATOR_3418]. If the participant 
reports pain, tightness or pressure in the chest, feeling faint, lightheaded or dizzy, or any other medical 
problems, the test will be stopped. When there are medically relevant findings, the participant will be told the cause for concern, and may be advised to consult his or her physician. If given permission by [CONTACT_2299], a letter will be sent to her primary care physician stating the concern.

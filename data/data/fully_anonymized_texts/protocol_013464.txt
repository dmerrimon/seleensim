1.0 Research Aims:  
 
.1 Research Questions(s):   Is there a difference in postoperative analgesic 
efficacy between placebo, 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], or 0.75% 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_291200] a transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for morbidly obese 
parturients as part of a post -cesarean deliv ery multimodal analgesic regimen 
that does not include intrathecal morphine?  
 
.2 Hypotheses:   Utilizing 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_39858] a TAP block, as part of a post -
cesarean delivery multimodal analgesic regimen that does not include 
intrathecal morphine, will result in decreased 24 hour postoperative  
hydromorphone consumption compared to 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_328819], and 
will be equivalent in 24 hour postoperative hydromorphone consumption 
compared to 0.75% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319].

in both cadaveric a nd radiologic studies.11  However, as ultrasonography has 
emerged as the “gold standard” for initiating many nerve blocks, reports have 
described the successful use of ultrasound imaging for initiation of transversus

Therefore, it is ou r policy on the Labor and Delivery unit to not administer 
intrathecal morphine to any parturient with a history of obstructive sleep 
apnea or a BMI > 40 kg/m2.  As such, these patients often require intravenous 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_328826] -controlled analgesia postopera tively, which has been shown to 
provide inferior pain relief and greater opi[INVESTIGATOR_328827].[ADDRESS_406188] -Cesarean delivery op ioid consumption of using either a

.3 Significance:    
Breakthrough pain in the postoperative period is a common occurrence.  
Currently, we attempt to effectively control this breakthrough pain with a 
combination of intravenous and oral non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs 
and opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].  However, this drug regimen has its limitations, especially 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438].   Opi[INVESTIGATOR_328833] -effects including nausea, 
vomiting, constipation, sedation and pruritus.  Opi[INVESTIGATOR_328834] s into breast 
milk and have been detected up to [ADDRESS_406190] been shown to decrease overall morphine consumption after cesarean 
delivery, as well as decrease the amount of postoperative pain reported by 
[CONTACT_328856].8  The advantages of improved pain control include: improved patient 
satisfaction, prevention of postoperative complications associated with pain 
(e.g., atelectasis), improved ability of the mother to care for her newborn, and 
decreased side -effects from systemic opi[INVESTIGATOR_83269]. In additi on, the

Page 7 of 18 reduction in need for postoperative breakthrough pain medications following 
cesarean delivery may minimize the consumption of resources (e.g., RN 
administered rescue medications) required to manage breakthrough pain on 
the postpartum wards.  Furthe rmore, in morbidly obese patients, the potential 
reduction in postoperative opi[INVESTIGATOR_328835] a TAP block 
would also decrease the risk of respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], for which these patients 
are at a higher risk.  Finally, improved postoperative p ain control results in 
earlier ambulation, thereby [CONTACT_328857][INVESTIGATOR_328836], which is the number one 
cause of maternal mortality in the [LOCATION_002].22,[ADDRESS_406191] of patients who underwent a cesarean 
delivery via Pfannenstiel incision had chronic pain at the incision site two 
years later, with 7% of patien ts rating their pain as moderate -to-severe.5  Of 
those patients who rated t heir pain moderate -to-severe, neuropathic pain 
secondary to nerve entrapment was found to be the cause in 53% of the cases, 
based on history and physical exam findings.[ADDRESS_406192] -Cesarean delivery multimodal analgesic regimen 
that does not include intratheca l morphine.  
 
 
3.0 Investigational Plan  
 
.1 Study design:  Randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial.  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_328816] 05.0  05/27/2015  
Page 8 of 18  
.2 Methods:  
 
.2.1 Size of study groups(s):    
The primary outcomes for this study will be [ADDRESS_406193] for hydromorphone, diameter of cutaneous 
sensory block from TAP block at 6 hours after placement, 
postoperative pain scores, 48 -hour hydrocodone consumption in 
milligrams, 72 -hour cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_328837] -
equivalents, 24 hour ketorolac consumption in milligrams, 48 hour 
ibuprofen consumption in milligrams, incidence and severity of 
postoperative neuropathic pain at 1 and 6 weeks after completion 
of surgery, and incidence of side effects from opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (nausea, 
pruritis, sedation).  
 
There will be four groups used in this study:  
 a.  Group 1 (Placebo Group) – 15mL 0.9% normal saline per side  
 b.  Group 2 – 15mL 0.2 % 60mg  ropi[INVESTIGATOR_328838]  
 c.  Group 3 – 15mL 0.5% 150mg   ropi[INVESTIGATOR_328839]  
 d.  Group 4 – 15mL 0 .75% 225mg   ropi[INVESTIGATOR_328840], we assumed that a 
clinically important reduction in 24 hour hydromorphone 
consumption would be a 25%, 37.5% and 50% absolute reduction, 
compared with control, with increasing rop ivacaine concentrations.  
The projected amount of 24 hour hydromorphone consumption in 
each group is assumed to be 4, 3, 2.5, and 2 mg.  The projected 
amount of 24 -hour hydromorphone consumption in for the placebo 
group is based on data obtained from a stu dy by [CONTACT_328858], et al. 
investigating the dose -response relationship of intrathecal 
morphine for postcesarean analgesia.25  Using these assumptions a  
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_328816] 05.0  05/27/[ADDRESS_406194] deviation assuming the 
alternative distribution is 3.0.  These  results are based on a 2000 
Monte Carlo sampling from the null  distributions .  However, in 
order to account for potential drop -outs, 50 patients will be 
recruited for each group, for an n=200 patients.  
 
 
.2.2 Patient entry, exclusion and dropout criteria:         
Inclusion Criteria: ASA II -III patient > 18 years of age who is

.2.3 Protocol specific methods:   
Eligible wom en for elective cesarean delivery  admitted to the 
Labor and Delivery Unit  of Prentice Women’s Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_328847] .  Women who agree to participate will give 
written, informed consent a t this time.  
 
Subjects will be prepared preoperatively in the usual fashion with 
intravenous (IV) access, aspi[INVESTIGATOR_328848]. Preincision antibiotics will be given and uterotonic 
medications will be used as per usual pract ice after delivery.  
 
The anesthesiologist will perform a spi[INVESTIGATOR_328849] 
L3-4 interspace (± one vertebral interspace)  utilizing a [ADDRESS_406195] of 12 mg 
of hyperbaric 0.75% bupi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] + [ADDRESS_406196]’s discretion per usual practice.  
 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_328816] 05.0  05/27/[ADDRESS_406197]-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ).  At the  time of 
presentation to PACU, the subject will be randomized  to one of  
four groups using a computer generated random number table : 
placebo (0.9% normal saline), 0.2% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 0.5% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319], 
or 0.75% ropi[INVESTIGATOR_10319] . Randomization assignments will be ke pt in 
sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The envelope will be 
opened by a research nurse who will prepare 2 x 20  mL syringe s, 
each containing 15 mL of the assigned solution, with each syringe  
labeled “study drug”. Subjects randomized  to one of the 
ropi[INVESTIGATOR_328850] a total of 30 mL (15 mL per side) 
of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_328851].  Subjects 
randomized to the placebo group will receive a total of 30 mL  
preservative free saline  (15 mL per side) . 
 
TAP blocks will be performed wi thin 15 minutes of arrival into the 
PACU room.  All TAP blocks will be performed by [CONTACT_328859] -
investigators (CC, AD, NH, AL, or EY), each of whom has 
significant experience in placement of these blocks.  During block 
placement, the patient will be con tinuously monitored with non -
invasive blood pressure measurement, EKG, and pulse oximetry.  
All patients will be placed in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547], with arms 
elevated above their heads.  Utilizing a Sonosite M -Turbo 
Ultrasound machine with an L -25 transducer ( 5.0-10.0 MHz) 
(SonoSite, Inc., Bothell, WA ),  the abdominal muscle layers will 
be located by [CONTACT_328860] T -10 dermatome level in the 
patient’s midaxillary line.  Three muscle layers (from superficial to 
deep: external oblique , internal oblique, and transversus 
abdominis) and three fascial layers (from superficial to deep: layer 
between subcutaneous fat and external oblique, layer between 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_328816] 05.0  05/27/2015

90mm, [ADDRESS_406198] with 
local anesthetic.  The needle will then be removed and the process 
repeated in the same manner on the patient’s opposite side. 
Following completion of the TAP block, the patients will be 
monitored in the PACU per routine Labor and Delivery Unit 
guidelines.   
 
As part of their postoperative pain control management, all patients 
will receive ke torolac tromethamine 30mg IV q6h x 24 hours, 
beginning within 30 minutes after completion of the TAP block.  
After 24 hours, ibuprofen 600mg per os will be administered q6 
hours prn pain x48 hours. The patient will also receive patient -
controlled intraveno us hydromorphone analgesia (PCA), which 
will be set up within 30 minutes upon arrival to the PACU.  The 
PCA will be set at 0.3mg bolus, lockout interval 10 minutes, with a 
4 hour maximum dose of 5 mg. The PCA will be activated at 
patient’s first request fo r supplemental analgesia and a VAS pain 
score will be documented at this time.   
 
Prior to transfer to the floor, the labor and delivery nurse will 
notify the accepting floor nurse, through the nursing handoff 
report, of the patient’s participation in this study.  Also, a sheet will 
be placed on the front of the patient’s chart, identif ying the 
patient’s participation in this study and instructing the floor nursing 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_328816] 05.0  05/27/[ADDRESS_406199] the anesthesia nurse clinician (and not the obstetric 
housestaff, as per routine) for evaluation and management of 
breakthrough pain. If the anesthesia nurse clinician deems that a 
change in the patient’s pain management regimen is necessary, she 
will consult an anesthesiology physician on call, who will adjust 
the pain medications accordingly.   
 
The patient will remain on the PCA for 24 hours after the time of  
TAP block placement, after which time the patient will be 
converted to acetaminophen/hydrocodone 325mg/10mg per os q4 
hours prn pain x48 hours.  These are routine oral analgesic 
medications for postoperative  cesarean delivery analgesia  in 
patients who do not receive intrathecal morphine .   
 
Standard orders will be written for monitoring sedation and 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and treatment of side effects (nausea, vomiting, 
pruritus and respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341]). The total amount of 
hydromorphone and hydrocodone give n will be deter mined for 
each subject after 24 and 72 ho urs, and will be reported in 
milligrams; the total opi[INVESTIGATOR_188796] [ADDRESS_406200] at 24 hours; the total 
amount of ibuprofen given will be determined for each subject at 
[ADDRESS_406201] for hydromorphone PCA; presence and 
severity of pain, nausea, and pruritus; extent of cutaneous sensory 
block; and 1 and 6 week postoperat ive follow -up will be made by 
[CONTACT_328861], as 
follows:  
 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_328816] 05.0  05/27/[ADDRESS_406202] and with  movement (hip flexion) utilizing a verbal pain 
scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable).  Pain severity will 
also be assessed at the time of first request for PCA analgesia.  
 
Nausea will be measured using a categorical scoring system (0 = 
none, 1 =  mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe).  Rescue antiemetics will 
be offered to any patient complaining of nausea or vomiting, per 
standard postoperative order regimen.  Pruritus will be measured 
using a categorical scoring system (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = 
moderat e, 3 = severe).  Sedation will be measured using the 
Observer’s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, a validated 
scale of sedation (see figure below).[ADDRESS_406203]-TAP blockade, utilizing a similar method described in a study 
by [CONTACT_328862]’homme, et al. 27  Using an alcohol -sterilized von Frey 
hair (396 m Newton) the p atient’s abdomen will be stimulated, 
starting at the umbilicus and moving cephalad by [ADDRESS_406204] change in perception. Then, the

transcribed onto graph paper and the total surface area will be 
calculated.    
 
The following data will be collected in addition to the primary and 
secondary outcome data:  maternal age, height, weight, gestational 
age, history of previous abdominal surgery, and history of previous 
cesarean delivery.  
 
Protocol specific analgesic regi mens will end at [ADDRESS_406206] -cesarean

Two telephone follow -up evaluations will be made (one at [ADDRESS_406207] -delivery) to assess the 
incidence and extent of postoperative neuropathic pain.  These two 
follow -up evaluations will each use a combination of 2 pain 
questionnaires: the Neuropa thic Pain Questionnaire —Short Form  
(NPQ -SF) and the  Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI) 
(see attached form).  The NPQ -SF will be used to assess for the 
presence of neuropathic pain, while the NPSI will be used to assess 
for the type and severity of n europathic pain. The NPQ -SF has 
been shown to have 64.5%  sensitivity, 78.6% specificity, and 73%

.2.4 Risks/Benefits:   The risks of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_328853].  These risks include: 
ineffective anesthesia, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension.  
Less common risks include fetal bradycardia or maternal postdural 
puncture headache.  Rare complications include maternal or fetal 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_2341], total spi[INVESTIGATOR_18227], a toxic reaction to 
the anesthetic agents, and bleeding or infection in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_328854].  There is always a risk 
of inadequate analgesia after surgery with the proposed pain 
management regimen. Participation in this study does not increase 
this risk above baseline.

complications include inadvertent peritoneal puncture , systemic 
toxicity from local anesthetic, and bleeding or infection.  The risk 
of inadvertent peritoneal puncture is potentially reduced by [CONTACT_328863].   
 
Finally, risks due to participation in this study include loss o f 
confidentiality.  There is also a risk the patient may become 
emotionally uncomfortable since research nurses will be contact[CONTACT_328864] -up. 
 
2.2.5        Confidentiality:  
Subjects’ identity will be guarded by [CONTACT_20526] a numerical code  
which is only known by [CONTACT_458]. Data is stored in 
department computer which is password protected. Each study subject 
will be assigned a study code number. The code will be  used to link 
study data to patient identification (name) in a separate database. 
Subject data will be stored on secure computers at Northwestern 
University. Data access will be password protected and only available 
to study investigators. The surveys will have the study code affixed  
after they have been received from the mail.  
 
 
4.0  Data Analysis : 
 
.1 Data collection form:   See attached.  
.2  Data evaluation:  The primary outcome (24 -hour hydromorphone 
consumption) will be compared among groups using the Kruskal -Wallis test.  
Post hoc testing will be performed using the Mann -Whitney test with 
Bonferroni correction.  The time to first request for analgesia will be 
compared using the log -rank test.  The area of abdominal analgesia, 48 -hour 
hydrocodone consumption, 72 -hour cumulative opi[INVESTIGATOR_8556], 24 hour

.3 Interpretation of Anticipated Results:    It is anticipated that a concentration 
of ropi[INVESTIGATOR_328855] -cesarean delivery 
analgesia as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen that does not include 
intrathecal morphine. In turn, anesthesi ologists will be able to provide 
superior post -cesarean analgesia with the TAP block for those patients who 
are ineligible to receive intrathecal morphine.  Furthermore, it is anticipated 
that use of the TAP block will decrease the incidence of post -operat ive 
neuropathic pain after cesarean delivery.

PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
Study Title HIIN – BH:  An evaluation of Emergency Department to admission conversion 
among patients with a telepsychiatric consult who are followed by a behavioral 
health - virtual patient navigation team  
Study Design A randomized, quality improvement evaluation  
Study 
Objectives The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of a behavioral health virtual 
navigation team compared to usual care among patients with a telepsychiatric 
consult, on Emergency Department to inpatient conversion. 
 
Secondary objectives of the evaluation include: 
Compare the following between the intervention group and the usual care group: 
o 45-day post discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, and observation 
encounters) 
o 90-day post discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, and observation 
encounters) 
o CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care defined 30-day readmission rate. This is 
a readmission rate among patients with an inpatient readmission to the 
same CHS facility as the index encounter. 
o The patient-centric defined 30-day readmission rate. This is a readmission 
rate among patients with an inpatient or observation readmission to any 
CHS facility. 
 
Additional analyses will be to explore: 
 
a. As a sub-analysis, qualitative outcomes will be collected and measured 
with patients, providers, and leaders. These outcomes will be collected and 
evaluated, per a sub-study protocol addendum. 
b. Historical health records may be pulled to explore baseline rates of risk 
factors among prior behavioral health patients at CHS. 
Inclusion/ 
Exclusion 
Criteria Inclusion: 
• 18 years of age or older 
• ED visit 
• Completed telepsychiatric consult at the ED visit 
• Telepsychiatric consult occurs Monday through Friday during the 
Navigator’s  potential hours of operation  
Study 
Procedures Patients who present to the ED at one of the two participating CHS EDs with a 
telepsychiatric consult performed will be treated and followed per the proposed 
CHS behavioral health patient navigation pathway (BH-VPN) or usual care. As 
part of the current care process, Patients are identified by [CONTACT_378814] a referral is made to the telepsychiatric 
consult, the care of the se patients will follow the allocated BH-VPN pathway or

Version Date: 6-1-[ADDRESS_474255] or usual care, the 
ED providers decide based on available information the ultimate disposition for 
patients --discharge from the ED or admit to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. 
 
Patients who complete a telepsychiatric consult in the ED Monday through Friday 
during the hours of operation can be enrolled to either the control or intervention 
arm based on a randomization scheme that randomly allocates days that navigators 
are available.  On days where the navigator is available, all patients who meet 
eligibility criteria will be considered exposed to the interventions; whereas, on 
days the navigator is not available all patients will be considered exposed to Usual 
care. Patients who are in the intervention arm will be offered navigation services 
for [ADDRESS_474256] is defined by [CONTACT_368872]:  
 
• Introduction of the navigation process to the patient, while in the ED 
• Evaluation of the patient and their needs. 
• Follow-up evaluation within [ADDRESS_474257] ED discharge 
• Confirm that a follow-up visit is scheduled and if the patient made it to the 
appointment. 
• Placement into an appropriate case management program, if needed 
Statistical 
Analysis Analyses will include all patients identified as having completed telepsychiatric 
consult and meeting the additional inclusion and exclusion criteria. Comparisons 
of the intervention and usual care groups will be made using univariate analyses 
such as the t-test and chi-square test.  The primary outcome, ED to inpatient 
conversion, will be compared between the two groups of patients using logistic 
regression. Results will be presented with odds ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals.

1.2. Primary Objective 
 
The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of a behavioral health – virtual patient 
navigation team compared to usual care, on the current ED encounter to inpatient conversion rate 
among patients with a completed telepsychiatric consult. 
 
1.3. Secondary Objectives 
 
The secondary objectives are to examine the behavioral health – virtual patient navigation team’s effect 
on additional patient outcomes, such as the  
i. CHS Quality, Comfort, and Care 30-day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate 
among patients with an inpatient readmission to the same CHS facility as the index 
encounter. This measure applies to patients that have a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378797]. 
ii. The patient-centric 30-day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate among patients 
with an inpatient or observation readmission to any CHS facility. This measure applies to 
patients that have a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378798]. 
iii. 45-day post ED discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, observation encounters) 
iv. 90-day post ED discharge utilization (ED, inpatient, observation encounters) 
2. BACKGROUND 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378799]. Significant morbidity exists for 
patients who are being admitted to a psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_268474] (ED).  
Additionally, admission to a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378800], degrade 
relationships with therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], and disrupt continuity of care.  Based on verbal reports from psychiatrists 
providing virtual consults at Carolinas HealthCare System (CHS), providers often decide to admit to a 
psychiatric hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378801].   
 
The number of patients seeking psychiatric services continues to grow at the national, state, and system 
level.  In 2015, there were an estimated 43.4 million adults aged 18 or older in the [LOCATION_002] with AMI 
(Any Mental Illness) within the past year. This number represented 17.9% of all U.S. adults 1.  In North 
Carolina, every 2.5 minutes a person in behavioral health crisis visits an ED 2.  For Carolinas Healthcare 
System’s Metro EDs, Behavioral Health visits increased from 8,449 in 2011 to 14,293 in 2016 (int ernal 
report). I n North Carolina’s FY12, 19,020 persons seeking help in an ED for a primary mental health, 
developmental disability, or suicide attempt issue accounted for 26,009 visits, a repeat visit rate of 27%. 
Thirteen percent of those re-admissions occurred within 30 days. (DHHS data analysis of NC Medicaid 
Version Number: 1.0 
Version Date: 6-1-17 
  
9 Claims) 3.  Based on a Premier Quality Advisor Report that includes readmissions for [ADDRESS_474263] a primary behavioral health diagnosis demonstrated a 7% 
readmission rate in 2015. 
 
As the number of behavioral health patients presenting to the acute care EDs for psychiatric care continues 
to increase, we find there is a significant need to find interventions that will avoid unnecessary admissions 
or readmissions of these patients.  Through verbal reports, ED psychiatrists at CHS must make the decision 
to admit a patient because there is no one to facilitate an outpatient appointment, ensure medications are 
filled, or provide follow-up so the patient can be discharged.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_114690] [ADDRESS_474264] care in the ED. This 
intervention utilized safety planning periodic check-ins via a phone call5. 
 
Carolinas Healthcare Syste m’s began utilizing telepsychiatry in [ADDRESS_474265] program that exists today. The CHS virtual model currently offers 21 
Metro EDs 24-7 access to licensed clinicians and psychiatrists who are able to provide psychiatric 
evaluations and dispositions.  A 2007 study showed psychiatric consultation and short-term follow up 
provided by [CONTACT_378815]6. 
 
The Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378802] (HIIN) is a nationwide effort to reduce preventable 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378803]. Part of the HIIN effort surrounding behavioral 
health patients, includes identifying packages or key components most effective at preventing psychiatric 
admission and exploring ways to efficiently apply effective strategies. As a complement to the 
telepsychiatry program, a partnership has been formed with HIIN to develop a patient navigator program to 
provide short-term follow up to patients who are evaluated by [CONTACT_378816]. The patient navigator will connect with the patient virtually prior to discharge from the 
ED and assist the patient in obtaining services and overcoming any barriers for [ADDRESS_474266] ED discharge. 
 
By [CONTACT_378817]- around service to complement Carolinas HealthCare System’s telepsychiatry 
program, we expect to decrease the number of patients admitted for inpatient psychiatric treatment and 
increase the number of discharges from the ED by [CONTACT_378818].  Additionally, we aim to decrease hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378804]-care compliance 
with medications and appointments through short-term follow up.  In one study regarding inpatient 
psychiatric care, it was found that patients who did not comply with at least one outpatient appointment 
after discharge were two times more likely to be readmitted than those who kept at least one appointment 
after discharge7.

10 3. RATIONALE 
To enhance the care of patients with a telepsychiatric consult, Carolinas HealthCare System (CHS) has 
designed a Behavioral Health Virtual Patient Navigation pathway ( BH-VPN ). The BH-VPN will monitor 
patients and assist with navigation through a weekly phone call after their index ED encounter for up to [ADDRESS_474267] includes the following key components: introduction to the patient follow-up 
process prior to ED discharge, follow-up evaluation within [ADDRESS_474268], 
confirmation that a follow-up visit is scheduled, where applicable confirm in-network follow-up 
appointments are completed with a CHS provider, and placement into an appropriate case management 
program, if needed. There may be cases where patients are eligible to enroll in full case management 
programs based on their insurance and certain criteria.  For example, if a patient has Medicaid through 
Cardinal Innovations, a managed care organization providing local behavioral health care, and meets 
certain criteria, and would no longer require navigation services. A patient ’s contact [CONTACT_378819]-VPN 
ends aft er [ADDRESS_474269] if they meet the inclusion\exclusion criteria and the 
telepsychiatric consultation occurs during potential BH – VPN hours. We will accrue patient data for 
evaluation during a period starting in June 2017. Based on data from 2016, we estimate 500 patients 
will complete a telepsychiatric consult in a 6-month period during potential BH-VPN hours of 
operation. Patients will not be accrued on days where the navigators could not potentially be available, 
such as nights, weekends, and holidays. 
 
Version Number: 1.0 
Version Date: 6-1-[ADDRESS_474270] (4 phone calls in 12 days), if the patient becomes enrolled with a case 
management program, declines services, or if the patient dies. After 45 days, a patient is eligible to be 
re-enrolled in either arm of the study. 
 
A patient remains in the control arm for 45 days unless the patient returns to the ED on a day where 
patients are being randomized to the intervention arm. 
 
4.2. Participating Sites 
Patients will be exposed to the intervention or usual care at two participating ED’s in Carolinas 
HealthCare System. The following Carolinas Healthcare System ED sites will be participating in this 
project. 
• Carolinas HealthCare System Pi[INVESTIGATOR_272830] 
• Carolinas HealthCare System Union 
 
4.3. Inclusion\Exclusion Criteria 
4.3.1.  Inclusion Criteria 
Eligible patients must meet each of the following criteria: 
• Present to an ED at participating sites 
• Completed a telepsychiatric consult as captured in the electronic medical record 
• Telepsychiatric consult completed Monday through Friday during the Navigator’s potential 
hours of operation 
• ≥ [ADDRESS_474271] the following potential disposition: (admission to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113979], admission to a 
behavioral health facility by [CONTACT_378820], discharge from the ED, or death ). 
Version Number: 1.0 
Version Date: 6-1-[ADDRESS_474272], 2 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378805], the ED encounter and the inpatient\observation 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378806].  Based on data from [ADDRESS_474273] patients discharged from the ED who 
convert to an admission do so within 2 days of their ED discharge. Five days were chosen to 
maximize the conversions attributed to the ED encounter. 
5.1.2.  Secondary Outcome Variable(s) 
Secondary outcome variables of the evaluation include: 
 
Examining the BH-VPN’s  effect on additional patient outcomes as compared to usual care, such as  
  
a. CHS QCC defined 30-day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate among patients with an 
inpatient readmission to the same CHS facility as the index encounter. This measure applies to 
patients that have a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378798]. 
b. The patient-centric defined 30-day readmission rate. This is a readmission rate among patients 
with an inpatient or observation readmission to any CHS facility. This measure applies to 
patients that have a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378798]. 
c. 45-day post ED discharge utilization. Utilization is defined as an inpatient, observation, or ED 
encounter at a CHS facility. 
d. 90-day post ED discharge utilization. Utilization is defined as an inpatient, observation, or ED 
encounter at a CHS facility. 
5.1.3.  Additional assessments 
As a sub-analysis, qualitative outcomes will be collected and measured with patients, providers, 
and leaders. These outcomes will be collected and evaluated, per a forthcoming sub-study protocol 
addendum. Patient details will be identified and pulled from the EMR retrospectively after their 
completion of the study. Historical health records may be pulled to explore baseline rates of risk 
factors among prior behavioral health patients at CHS. 
  
5.1.4.  Adverse Events 
Safety/Serious Adverse Events that will be specifically monitored/evaluated include suicide 
ideation and death. Suicide ideation is tracked among the intervention population at each touch 
Version Number: 1.0 
Version Date: 6-1-[ADDRESS_474274], will be based on days the Navigators are available to 
treat patients who’ve completed their telepsychiatric consult per the BH -VPN or usual care. Patients 
may be in the ED for multiple days. Their enrollment status depends on the day and time of their initial 
telepsychiatric consultation. Navigation will only be available for those patients whose consult occurs 
during intervention day/times. As part of the research design and rollout of this project, randomization 
will occur at the day level with the days being identified as intervention or usual care days for the 
duration of the study. We expect an average of 3.7 patients seen daily for both hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378807]. 
Patients will accrue in both arms of the study Monday through Friday during the hours of operation. 
Patients will not be accrued on days where the navigators are not available such as weekends, nights, 
and holidays. 
 
5.3. Behavioral Health Virtual Patient Navigation (BH-VPN) 
The BH-VPN outlines the flow of patients from initial contract to their follow-up calls (see Appendix 
1). In the existing ED workflow patients are identified by [CONTACT_378821] a behavioral 
health crisis and needing psychiatric evaluation. A referral is made to the telepsychiatric provider for a 
virtual consult performed on a tablet in the ED. Once the consultation is completed, the patient is 
placed either in usual care (the control) or BH-VPN (the intervention arm of the study). The placement 
is dependent upon the day and hours of the week, as to whether navigation is available. After virtual 
consultation is performed via tablet, the telepsychiatrist will recommend to the ED provider that the 
patient either be admitted or discharged from the ED, ultimately that decision lies with ED provider. If 
the patient is in the intervention arm does not have neurocognitive disabilities such as Alzheimer’s and 
discharge is recommended, the patient will be approached by [CONTACT_378822]. The patient has the 
option not to be followed by [CONTACT_329757]. The navigator will complete the initial virtual behavioral 
health assessment. The initial health assessment contains information such as preferred communication 
method, primary care provider, psychiatry provider, collateral resources, recent ED and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_278926], substance use disorder, medication barriers, appointment barriers, community resources, and 
crisis planning. 
 
The follow-up assessments, which will occur during navigation phone calls every at least weekly 
includes information such as a suicide ideation safety screening, an appointment reminder, appointment 
barrier evaluations, medication obtainment follow-up, substance use disorder follow-up, supportive 
listening, psychoeducation, community resource follow-up, and additional crisis planning. 
 
Version Number: 1.0 
Version Date: 6-1-17 
  
14 The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) helps identify whether someone is at risk for 
suicide, and the severity and immediacy of the risk. It also identifies level of support the person needs. 
The screening tool is administered during each phone contact [CONTACT_368884]. If a patient is 
deemed actively suicidal then the navigator will recommend transfer to mobile crisis, calling [ADDRESS_474275] of care.  
5.4. Follow- up 
Patients being treated on the BH-VPN will receive a follow-up phone call within 24 to 72 hours from 
discharge, and then weekly for up to 45 days. A follow-up assessment is completed upon each phone 
call. 
 
5.5. Patient Completion of Participation 
Patients who are treated per the protocol on the control or intervention arm will complete their 
participation after 45 days or if one of the following occurs: 
• Unable to connect: calls attempted over 12 days (intervention arm only) 
• Death  
• Enrolled in another Care Management program (intervention arm only) 
• Declined services 
• [ADDRESS_474276]-discharge completed 
A patient’s utilization may be tracked post [ADDRESS_474277] on 
the research team. Data may be retrieved retrospective to a patient’s completion of the interventi on or usual 
care arm of the study. A monthly executive summary will be produced, showing patient volume, percent 
patients with suicidal ideation, and utilization. 
 
Version Number: 1.0 
Version Date: 6-1-17 
  
15 6.1. Sample size analysis and statistical analysis 
We are conducting the study for about 6 months leading to approximately 6 months*4 weeks*5 
days=[ADDRESS_474278] a 15% absolute reduction in the inpatient admission within [ADDRESS_474279] a 50% inpatient admission rate (internal 
report).  We will have 85% power to detect this reduction with a total sample size of 414 (α=0.05) 
using a Chi-square test for independence. We will not need to adjust for attrition as the primary 
outcome of inpatient admission <[ADDRESS_474280] 
inflated the sample size by 10% assuming the average number of patients per ED per day is 2 and the 
intra-class correlation coefficient=0.1 (Design effect=1+(2-1)ICC). Therefore, our target sample size is 
N=456. 
6.2. Statistical analysis 
All analyses will follow intention to treat such that patients will be analyzed based on the allocated 
intervention on the day of their ED visit (BH-VPN or treatment as usual).  We will compare the two 
groups on age, sex, suicide ideation, and neurocognitive disorders to assess for balance, which is 
inferred with randomization.   
The primary outcome, inpatient admission < [ADDRESS_474281] in the model.  Results for group comparisons will be 
presented with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.   
Secondary outcomes are 45-day post discharge utilization (yes/no), 90-day post discharge utilization 
(yes/no), QCC defined 30-day readmission (yes/no), and patient centric 30-day readmission (yes/no). 
Each of the secondary outcomes are dichotomous and will be compared using the same approach as the 
primary outcome. All tests will be two sided and the data will be analyzed using SAS Enterprise Guide 
version 6.1.  For all outcomes, we assume if there are no visits in the CHS electronic medical record 
that the value for having a visit is null; therefore, there will be no missing data for the primary or 
secondary outcome measures. 
 
6.3. Data Collection Dates 
The implementation of the BH-VPN will begin in June among patients with a completed telepsychiatric 
consult.

9.1. Protocol and Pathway Training 
Background, protocol and process steps will be presented to psychiatrists and nurse practitioners who will 
be providing virtual psychiatric consultations. The role of virtual patient navigator and randomization 
scheme will be presented so expectations are clear that this is not available every day/time or weekends. 
This will be presented at the Department of Psychiatry meeting, which includes Emergency and 
Telepsychiatry Departments. Attendees may also include providers, who at some point may see patients 
who have been through this pathway, but will not be directly involved in providing evaluations. Education 
will be provided to the emergency department staff involved in this project, so that they are aware of th e 
process and the role of the virtual patient navigator. 
Version Number: 1.0 
Version Date: 6-1-[ADDRESS_474284] the following potential adverse events:  deaths, and reported events of suicidal ideation. 
These events will be weighed against average expected rates in this population by [CONTACT_378825], who will serve on a data and safety monitoring board. 
 Other potential risks of participation in this project include, the risk of health information disclosure. There 
is always the risk of disclosure of a patient’s private health information (PHI) or medical information. 
However, the processes identified in this protocol to enable the execution of this project, do not increase 
inherent risk of disclosure. Carolinas HealthCare System utilizes several hard and soft safety controls in the 
protection of patient information and medical records. Security controls include, but are not limited to, 
multiple system firewalls, access restrictions to patient records and information, locked offices and

10.1. Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
Per the NIH, A DSMB is an independent advisory body of experts appointed to assess, at regular 
intervals, the progress of a trial, review accumulating data, evaluate safety event reports, and 
determine critical efficacy endpoints in a manner that contributes to the safety of subjects and the 
continued validity and scientific merit of the trial. Due to the project ’s high risk population, this 
protocol will be monitored according to the protocol-specific data and safety monitoring plan, and 
will abide by [CONTACT_378826].  It is the responsibility of the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_378809].  The Principal Investigator, Statistician, and 
other team members will meet as needed to review enrollment and retention, safety data for all 
subjects, study progress, and validity/integrity of the data.  Documentation of these meetings will be 
kept with study records.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_378810]-specific Data and

Protocol Summary  
Full Title:  Randomized controlled trial assessing transperineal prostate 
biopsy to reduce infection complications  
Clinical Phase:  II 
Principal Investigator:  [INVESTIGATOR_174130] C. Hu, M.D., M.P.H.  
Sample Size:  N= 1,702  
Study Population:  Men who are aged at least 18 years with: history of Grade Group 
[ADDRESS_777450] diagnosed prior to date of planned 
biopsy (active surveillance cohort); clinical concern for the 
presence of prostate cancer as determined by [CONTACT_590154] ≤36 
months  prior to date of planned biopsy (prior negative cohort);  
Men without previous prostate biopsy (first time prostate biopsy)  
Accrual Period:  Approximately 31 months  
Study Design:  Prospective, randomized trial with 1:[ADDRESS_777451] -biopsy.  
Intervention Description:  Transrectal prostate biopsy (TR -Bx) under local anesthesia is 
currently the most commonly used approach to evaluate for the 
presence of prostate cancer. A limitation of TR -Bx is the need for 
biopsy needles to pass through the rectal mucosa on their 
traject ory to the prostate, placing men at high risk of an infectious 
complication. An alternative method for performing prostate biopsy 
is via a percutaneous transperineal approach. One limitation of 
transperineal prostate biopsy (TP -Bx) has been the historic ne ed 
for it to be performed under general or spi[INVESTIGATOR_590146]. Due to recent technical advances  TP-Bx may 
now be safely performed under local anesthesia.  
Primary Objective:  To compare infection adverse events of TP -Bx vs. TR -Bx 
performed under local anesthesia.  
Secondary Objectives:  To compare other adverse events such as bleeding and urinary 
retention. To compare detection rates of clinically significant and 
insignificant prostate cancer.

1. Study Objectives  
Primary Objective:  The primary objective of this study is to compare the incidence and severity 
of infectious complications between the transperineal and transrectal approaches to prostate 
biopsy.  
Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives of this study include comparing the incidence of 
other adverse events, associated pain, and cancer detection rates between the transperineal 
and transrectal approaches.  
2. Background  
Approximately one million transrectal prostate biopsies (TR -Bx) are performed annually in the 
[LOCATION_002].1 The number of prostate Bx is expected to increase due to the demographic 
growth of the aging male population. Moreover, 44% of U.S. men undergoing initial biopsy 
report having a repeat biopsy within five years.[ADDRESS_777453] once during their lifetimes when they  
undergo biopsy.  
Due to the need for biopsy needles to pass through the rectal mucosa on their trajectory to the 
prostate, TR -Bx is associated with a significant risk of infectious complications. The needle 
travels through the “dirty” rectal mucosa to the “clean” prostate at least 12 times,4 and fecal flora 
may seed the vascular prostate gland and bloodstream, leading to infection.5,6 One systematic 
review suggests this rate may be as high as 5%.7  The [LOCATION_002] Preventive Services Task 
Force (USPSTF) Grade C recommendation for PSA screening considered adverse events 
associated with biopsy among the harms of PSA -based screening.8 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_590147], 44% of men experience bacteriuria and 16% experience bacteremia after TR -Bx.[ADDRESS_777454] -Bx infection hospi[INVESTIGATOR_590148] 0.6% in 1996 to 3.6% in [ADDRESS_777455] -Bx infection and sepsis,12 which can result in dire complications such as 
limb gangrene/amputation, endocarditis, meningitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC) or death.13–18  
As an alternative to the transrectal approach, prostate biopsy may be performed percutaneously 
through the perineal skin. Due to avoidance of the rectum, transperineal prostate biopsy (TP -Bx) 
is associated with an overall lower risk of infectious complicat ions. At some centers, this has 
obviated the need for perioperative antibiotics, which is reinforced by [CONTACT_590155]. 19,[ADDRESS_777456], the TP approach has relative ease of access to the anterior prostate.6 This is reflected 
 in greater detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in retrospective studies with 
transperineal22–25 under general anesthesia (49% -91%) vs. transrectal24,26 –31 Bx approaches (14 -
42%). Given more than 80% of first -time biopsy nationally are performed without 
MRItargeting,32,[ADDRESS_777457] be 
evaluated as this applies to a large population of men. For instance, the American Urological 
Association professional guidelines were updated to recommend MRI use for firs t-time biopsy in 
early 2020;[ADDRESS_777458] this figure closer to approximately 1 -2%.  
In this study, we aim to compare the safety, tolerability, and cancer detection rates of TP -Bx 
versus TR -Bx within the contexts of a randomized clinical trial. The results of this study will 
provide high level medical evidence regarding which method of pro state biopsy carries the best 
risk to benefit ratio for men undergoing evaluation for prostate cancer.   
3. Subject Selection  
3.1 Study Population  
This study will include all men who are recommended to undergo prostate biopsy as part of 
routine clinical care. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in the following sections.  
3.2 Inclusion Criteria  
• Male sex  
• Age ≥18 years  
• Active surveillance cohort: History of Grade Group [ADDRESS_777459] diagnosed  
prior to date of planned biopsy   
• Prior negative cohort: Clinical concern for the presence of prostate cancer as determined 
by [CONTACT_590156] ≤36 months prior to date of 
planned biopsy  
• Men without previous prostate biopsy (first time prostate biopsy)  
• Willingness to sign informed consent and adhere to the study protocol  
3.3 Exclusion Criteria  
• Acute prostatitis within the last 6 months  
• PSA > 20 ng/mL in men who have previously undergone prostate biopsy  
• Current non -urologic bacterial infection requiring active treatment with antibiotics  
• Unfit to undergo prostate biopsy under local anesthesia  
 • Prior definitive therapy for prostate cancer, such as radiation therapy or partial gland 
ablation  
• Men who have previously undergone prostate biopsy in whom artifact would reduce 
quality of prostate MRI (extensive orthopedic pelvic metal)  
• Contraindication to prostate MRI (claustrophobia, pacemaker, chronic kidney disease) in 
men who have previously undergone prostate biopsy  
4. Study Procedures  
4.[ADDRESS_777460] the research objectives, risks and benefits of study participation, and the 
subjects’ rights and responsibilities. For patients who are scheduled for biopsy, electronic 
consent will als o be available via phone. Eligible patients will be contact[CONTACT_426] a member of the 
study team (i.e. investigator or research coordinator), who will explain the study to the patient. 
The patient will also receive a link to the electronic consent form via emai l or MyChart message.  
This study will utilize either a traditional one -stage or a two -stage consent process. The reason 
for having the one -stage consent is there are a few sites in which the predominant approach is 
transperineal. Therefore, this two-stage consent does not work. With the one -stage consent,  
patients give permission to participate in the study prior to randomization (tradtional RCT 
consent). With a second -stage consent, subjects who meet all eligibility criteria will sign the 
firsts tage consent form. Patients will have the option to sign the consent in person or 
electronically. First -stage consent will register the subject to the study and will allow 
investigators to use their data from their medical record and post -biopsy questionna ire 
responses for research purposes. Subjects who sign first -stage consent will be randomized in a 
1:1 ratio to receive TP -Bx or TRBx. The patients’ first -stage consent or their traditional one -
stage consent will be valid for eight months to accommodate fo r biopsy scheduling. This will 
reduce the number of re -consents and align with the standard of care timeline for biopsy 
procedures. Biopsies are often scheduled as far out eight months from their clinic visit.  
Participants will be consented remotely using an electronic version of the informed consent form 
that follows federal, state, and local regulations, as applicable. We will implement the following 
procedures for electronic informed consent.  
The informed consent document(s) will be sent to the subject or their Legal Authorized 
Representative (LAR), if applicable, via secure email sent by [CONTACT_590157]. The subject or LAR will be asked to review the consent do cument prior and 
during the consent discussion with a study staff member via phone or approved 
teleconferencing service (i.e., Zoom). The study staff member will confirm the subject or LAR 
has read and has the capacity to appreciate all aspects of the info rmation presented in the 
consent process for the research study. The subject or LAR will be encouraged to ask 
questions. If agreeing to participate, the subject or LAR will sign the consent form using 
electronic informed consent (eConsent) via REDCap. A co mputer, tablet or touch screen phone 
will be used to capture digital signatures. The person conducting consent will also sign the 
electronic informed consent (eConsent) document in a contemporaneous manner. Subjects will 
 be provided with a digital copy of the completed form via email. The informed consent 
discussion and process will be documented by [CONTACT_590158]’s medical record or 
study record.  
If a subject does not have access to a touch screen phone, computer or tablet, cannot work with 
remote electronic informed consent, or the remote electronic informed consent cannot be 
obtained for any other reasons, the consent may be conducted and documen ted at an in -person 
visit prior to study activities via paper consent form or through REDCap on an ITS tagged 
device.  
The assignment sequence will use randomly permuted blocks of unequal size stratified by 
[CONTACT_590159], PSA (<4, 4 -9.9, ≥10 ng / mL) and biopsy indication (prior negative vs. active 
surveillance) and implemented by [CONTACT_590160], which preve nts an 
investigator from learning allocation before a patient is unambiguously registered on study and 
from changing allocation afterwards, thus ensuring full allocation concealment. For men with 
prior biopsy, we exclude men with a PSA >20 ng/mL.  
For the REDCap randomization model, randomization of subjects will occur on the data 
collection form where the randomization field is located. Before a subject is randomized, a 
'Randomize' button will appear next to that field. When a user (who has been gi ven appropriate 
'Randomize' user privileges) clicks that button, a pop -up box will appear that will allow the user 
to randomize the subject. After a subject has been randomized, the groupi[INVESTIGATOR_007] (i.e. transrectal or 
transperineal biopsy) will become permanentl y locked and unmodifiable. The randomization field 
will always be locked and unmodifiable both before and after randomization has occurred for a 
subject.  
Randomization is unblinded, and research coordinators of respective enrolling sites will inform 
their patients of the assigned cohort.  
Subjects randomized to TR -Bx will receive transrectal biopsy. Subjects randomized to TP -Bx will 
undergo a second consent discussion with the enrolling investigator, where the risks and 
benefits of transperineal biopsy will be explained. Subjects can then d ecide whether to undergo 
standard transrectal biopsy or transperineal biopsy. Subjects who agree to undergo TP -Bx will 
sign the second -stage consent form.  
4.2 Data Collection & Confidentiality  
Study data will be prospectively collected from patient medical records and patient surveys. In 
all participating centers, the site -specific research coordinator will perform baseline data 
acquisition and medical record abstraction. This data will be enter ed into standardized clinical 
report forms housed within a REDCap environment and hosted by [CONTACT_333750]. Each patient will be 
assigned a unique study identifier.  
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web -based application designed 
exclusively to support data capture for research studies. The REDCap platform will be 
partitioned to permit read/write access only to site -specific records such that indi vidual sites will 
be able to access records for their own subjects, exclusively. REDCap has a secure email and 
web-based data collection interface that may be utilized for collecting data. The site -specific 
research coordinator will determine individual pa tients’ preferred method of survey response 
 and may collect survey data either through mail, telephone, REDCap, or during an in -person 
visit. 
Only the WCM research coordinator will be able to review de -identified data across sites to 
conduct data quality checks and share data quality with the study biostatistician.  
To ensure accuracy of data entered in the REDCap database from source documents (including 
surveys and medical record abstract), sites will perform 100% visual review and conduct double 
data entry for a sample (i.e., 10%) of the data.  
Data quality checks will be conducted every 6 months, coinciding with Data Safety and 
Monitoring reviews.  
For protocol deviations fitting immediately reportable criteria, the DSMC’s primary concern lies 
with whether the deviation has the potential to negatively impact subject safety or integrity of 
study data or whether the deviation places subjects at greater  risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic or social harm). If the DSMC makes determinations that the reported 
protocol deviation impacts either, it may recommend modifications, suspension or termination of 
the study.    
Interim study findings will be communicated in cases where modifications are recommended. 
The DSMC will require the PI [INVESTIGATOR_590149](s) have 
been made, or to submit a reason why the PI [INVESTIGATOR_590150]’ s recommendation.

Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0. fAssessed by [CONTACT_590162].  
4.4 Antibiotic Administration  
For patients undergoing a TR -Bx, antibiotic prophylaxis will be administered in accordance with 
guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA).[ADDRESS_777461] before recruitment to review and ensure 
standardization of biopsies approaches. Investigators will follow the technique described by [CONTACT_590163]. to administer lidocaine during TP -Bx.20 For both transperineal and transrectal approaches, 
20 mL of 1% lidocaine will be used, respectively, to standardize local anesthesia. At each site, 
however, the choice of commercial MRI -targeted biopsy platform will be left to the physicians’ 
discretion.  
In both transperineal and transrectal biopsy arms for MRI -targeted biopsy, the number of 
systematic biopsy cores will be standardized to 12 cores. The technique for TR -Bx is performed 
as described by [CONTACT_590164].22 A total of 12 systematic biopsy cores will be obtained 
from the peripheral zone of the prostate at the base, mid gland, and apex. Locations of the 12 
systematic cores are: Right lateral base, Right lateral midgland, Right lateral apex, Right medial 
base, Right medial midgland, Right medial apex, Left lateral base, Left lateral midgland, Left 
lateral apex, Left medial base, Left medial midgland, and Left medial apex. The technique for 
TPBx is performed as described by [CONTACT_590165].38. Locations of the systematic cores will be 
obtained as follows: 2 cores each at Right posterior lateral, Right posterior medial, Left posterior 
lateral, and Left posterior medial, as well as 1 core each at Right anterior lateral, Right anterior 
medial, Le ft anterior lateral, and Left anterior medial.  
In both transperineal and transrectal biopsy arms, the number of targeted biopsy cores will be 
standardized to 3 cores per target, with a maximum of three ROIs permitted to be chosen for 
targeted biopsy. MRI -targeted biopsy registration (i.e., matching of the image of the target on MRI 
with the real -time image of the prostate during biopsy) may be performed by [CONTACT_590166] -assisted registration.  
De-identified video capture of each site’s first [ADDRESS_777462] of electronic questionnaire administered 7±[ADDRESS_777463] 
biopsy using a REDCap site hosted at Weill Cornell Medical Center. For patients unable to 
complete the questionnaire electronically, responses will be obtained via telephone interview. 
Any patient indicating that they experienced an adverse event  will be contact[CONTACT_590167]. Additionally, all relevant medical records will be requested. Adverse 
events will be classified in accordance with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) v5.0.  
The primary outcomes are infection rates of TP -Bx versus TR -Bx.  
The secondary outcomes are patient -reported pain and anxiety, and comparison of 
noninfectious complications such as bleeding and urinary retention rates, and cancer detection.

5.2 Pain, Anxiety and Discomfort  
A questionnaire will be given to patients immediately after the biopsy and at 7±[ADDRESS_777464] -biopsy 
(Appendix). The questionnaire captures discomfort and pain and fear -anxiety using a numerical 
rating scale (0 -10), with higher scores indicating greater inte nsity of symptoms. The questionnaire 
also asks about the presence or absence of adverse events, with reporting of significant adverse 
events (fever, chills, urinary retention, urinary tract infection, treatment from a doctor) subject to 
follow -up from stud y staff.  
Infectious complications will be captured as: (1) uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI): 
dysuria, urgency, frequency or hematuria without fever and with or without pyuria (>5 white 
blood cells per high -powered field or positive leukocyte esterase on urine dipstick) or bacteriuria 
(≥ 105 colony -forming units/mL); (2) complicated UTI: fever, flank pain, nausea or vomiting with 
or without pyuria and bacteriuria; (3) urosepsis: criteria for sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic 
shock39  were combined and categorized as urosepsis.[ADDRESS_777465] the prostate cancer grade, number and location of 
positive biopsies for transrectal (location: left vs. right, medial vs. lat eral, apex, mid, and base) 
and for transperineal (location: posterior medial, posterior lateral, and anterior), as well as the 
maximum cancer core length (in mm), and total number of negative cores. In order to compare 
outcomes, prostate cancer grade will be categorized into insignificant (Gleason grade group 1) 
and clinically significant (grade group ≥ 2).22  
 6. Statistical Considerations  
We define infection complication  as any of the following: (1) fever requiring medical advice or 
intervention; (2) chills requiring medical advice or intervention; or (3) UTI diagnosed by [CONTACT_59580].41 We aim to enroll 1,702 (n=682 active surveillance, n=620 prior negative biopsy, n 
=[ADDRESS_777466] time biopsy) subjects in this study, with equal randomization between groups. We 
assume that the infection rate in the transperineal group is 0.5%. Given a one -sided α of 0.10, the 
power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in infection rates will be >80% if the event rate 
in the transrectal group is 2.0%. The event estimate is consistent with published post -transrectal 
biopsy infection rates range from 1 % to 17.5%41–49 and the 2017 AUA prostate biopsy guidelines 
cite an infection risk of 5 -7%.37 
Analysis of infection, detection of clinically significant cancer (i.e. Grade Group 2+), over -detection 
of clinically insignificant cancer (i.e. Grade Group 1), presence vs. absence of other biopsy related 
complication grade 2 or above and, separately, Gra de 1 (patient -reported hematuria, 
hematospermia or hematochezia) will be by [CONTACT_590168]. 
active surveillance as fixed effect covariates. The Barnard's test will be used to analyze the data. 
Absolute risk differences will be calculated by [CONTACT_590169], with 95% CI obtained by [CONTACT_63676][INVESTIGATOR_007]. As a sensitivity 
analysis for high -grade cancers missed on biopsy, we will include as an event any detectio n of 
grade group ≥2 cancer up to two years after randomization, whether detected by [CONTACT_590170], as a binary variable. We will also explore whether the 
relative effects of transperineal biopsy on cancer detection va ries by [CONTACT_590171] 
(active surveillance vs. prior negative) by [CONTACT_590172] (African ancestry yes or no) or setting  
(active surveillance vs. prior negative) and the associated interaction terms in two separate 
logistic regression models.  
Rates of missing data are expected to be extremely low because all outcomes are assessed within 
a short period of time after biopsy.  Hence, we do not anticipate having to use statistical methods 
to handle missing data. However, if rates of missing data are more than 5%, we will implement 
multiple imputation using chained equations.  
To compare the detection of clinically significant cancer biopsy with systematic vs. MRI -targeted 
biopsy, stratified by [CONTACT_590173]. transrectal, the analyses will be conducted separately for the 
prior negative biopsy and active surveillance cohorts s eparately. For the prior negative biopsy 
patients, we will create a model with the outcome of clinically significant cancer and predictors of 
the linear predictor from the standard Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group model plus PI -RADS 
version 2 MRI score and MRI prostate volume.50 For the active surveillance cohort, we will use a 
similar approach but use the Canary “base” model for biopsy outcome in active surveillance 
patients.[ADDRESS_777467] decision curve analysis, a decision -analytic technique that weighs the 
value of avoiding unnecessary biopsy compared to missing high -grade cancer, to assess the  
clinical utility of the models.52

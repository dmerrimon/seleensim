BioTeke_Home Use_Clinical Performance Study_V2.0_5 May 2022.docx  Page 10 of 26 6. Introduction  
6.1. Background  
6.1.1.  COVID -19 is a contagious respi[INVESTIGATOR_4375], caused by [CONTACT_479316], 
Severe Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7531] 2 (SARS -CoV -2). This is a communicable 
disease easily transmitted through aerosolized droplets containing the infectious virus. Infections 
with SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_615213]  when compared to a high -sensitivity Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) 
SARS -CoV -2 RT -PCR assay . 
6.3. Risk and Benefit Assessment  
6.3.1.  Potential Risks  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The only study -related procedures that could impact Subject safety is in the collection of 
nasal swabs.  The risks of collecting a nasal swab may include sympt oms associated with 
standard collection practices such as slight pain and/or a small amount of bleeding in the 
nose.   
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subject(s) will be de -identified using a study -specific number at the time of enrollment.  All 
study forms, Case Report Forms ( CRFs) and study samples will be labeled with the de -
identified s ubject  ID number. No identifiable patient information will be provided to 
BioTeke [LOCATION_003], LLC .  No patient treatment or management decisions will be based on any 
results generated from the investig ational kit during this study.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Information collected for this study is confidential. However, officials of FDA or other 
regulatory agencies may research records during the ordinary course of carrying out their 
functions.  A sponsor representative m ay also inspect research records to make certain the 
study data is accurate.  The Investigator, institution, regulatory agencies and sponsor will 
protect the confidentiality of the records.  
6.3.2.  Potential Benefits  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The information obtained in this study will not benefit the study subjects directly but  may 
aid future patients by [CONTACT_4205][INVESTIGATOR_479303] -
CoV -2. 
6.4. Study Device Description  
The Bio-Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615214] antigen of the 
SARS -CoV -2 from the  anterior nares (Nasal) specimens from patients with or without symptoms or other 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_479304] a COVID -[ADDRESS_615215] along the nitrocellulose membrane until 
captured by [CONTACT_094] -coated monoclonal antibodies of SARS -CoV -2 in the detection zone on the nitrocellulose f ilm 
(Test line – T) to form a pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]/purple reaction line  on the detection zone, indicating the result is positive.  
Conversely, if there is no viral antigen or the concentration of antigen in the  specimen is below the minimum 
detection limit, no pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]/purple  reaction line appears in the detection zone and the result is considered negative.   
Regardless of whether or not  the sample contains viral antigens, the pi[INVESTIGATOR_8745]/purple reaction line that appears in 
the quality control zone (Control line – C) is the criterion  for determining if the chromatography process is 
performing properly.    
6.4.2.  Device Output  
Bio-Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615216] line (T) and control line (C) indicate a positive result.  
2. A single control line (C) indicates a negative result.  
3. A test line (T) only , or the absence of the control line (C)  and test line (T) , or blurred  lines 
indicate an invalid test.

nasal (nares) swab samples from individuals aged 1 4 years or older or adult collected anterior nasal 
swab samples from individuals aged 2 – [ADDRESS_615218] should self - isolate and seek follow -up care with their physician or healthcare provider as 
additional testing may be necessary.  
Negative resul ts should be treated as presumptive and confirmation with a molecular assay for 
patient management, may be performed if necessary.  Negative results do not rule out SARS -CoV -2 
infection and  should not be used as the sole basis for treatment or patient mana gement decisions, 
including infection control decisions. Negative results should be considered in the context of an 
individual’s recent exposures, history, and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent 
with COVID -19. Additional confirmatory te sting with a molecular test for positive results may also 
be necessary, if there is a low likelihood of COVID -19, such as in individuals without known 
exposures to COVID -[ADDRESS_615219] n egative and continue to experience COVID -like symptoms of fever, cough and/or 
shortness of breath may still have SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_615220] to relevant public health authorities in 
accordance with local, state, and f ederal requirements using appropriate LOINC and SNOMED 
codes, as defined by [CONTACT_206090] (LIVD) Test Code Mappi[INVESTIGATOR_206075] -
CoV -[ADDRESS_615221] anterior nares (nasal) specimens directly collected from subjects 
suspected of COVID -[ADDRESS_615222]   
used in this study will not be used for diagnostic purposes or patient management.  
6.5.2.  Results are for the identification of SARS -CoV -2 nucleocapsid antigen. Antigen is generally 
detectable in nas al samples during the acute phase of infection. Positive results indicate the 
presence of viral antigens, but clinical correlation with patient histor y and other diagnostic 
information is necessary to determine infection status. Positive results do not rule out bacterial 
infection or co -infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of 
disease.  
6.6. Study Sites  
6.6.1.  Study enrollmen t for this study will be conducted at up to three  (3) clinical  sites with at least two 
testing locations . The testing locations have a  diverse demographic patient population with 
varying educational backgrounds.   
 
  
BioTeke_Home Use_Clinical Performance Study_V2.0_5 May 2022.docx  Page [ADDRESS_615223] will be conduc ted at a minimum of one (1) CLIA certified 
laboratory within the U.S.  
6.6.3.  The applicable IRB/EC will review and approve the study protocol, informed consent and assent 
documents , Quick  Reference  Instructions  (QRI) and any other patient facing materials  prior t o 
enrolling Subjects into this study.  
6.7. Study Objectives  
6.7.1.  The primary objective of this study is to determine the accuracy  (in terms of sensitivity and 
specificity)  of the Bio-Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615224]  when compared  to the PerkinElmer 
New Coronavirus Nucleic Acid detection kit , a high -sensitivity Emergency Use Authorization 
(EUA) SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_615225] on themselves or on another study participant.  Potential subjects will 
be those  presenting for COVID -19 testing.   
Subjects that present for COVID -19 testing (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) that meet the eligi bility criteria 
will be enrolled in to this study. The subject  population may include English and Spanish speaking  individuals across 
all ages 2 – 65+ years . The following age groups must be represented : 
• <14 years of age, where the Parent or legal guardian collects a sample from their child (e.g., age 2 -13) and 
performs the test  
• 14-24 years of age  
• 25-64 years of age  
• ≥[ADDRESS_615226] of care (SOC)  test performed by a healthcare practitioner.  To mitigate any 
potential bias which may affect the subject’s  visual interpretation  of the Bio-Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615227] self -collection  (or adult tester)  the healthcare practitioner  will 
collect the  nasal sample for the RT -PCR comparator.  
 
Comparator:  
The subjects will have a healthcare practitioner collect two nasal sample s, one for the  SOC testing  and the second for 
the comparator test .  The SOC  sample will be used for patient management . Again, the results of the SOC will not be 
shared with the subje ct until the subject has interpreted the results from the Bio -Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615228] should be instructed to 
blow their nose prior to each sample collection.    The comparator sample will be tested at a CLIA lab  using the  
PerkinElmer New Coronavirus Nucleic Acid detection kit . Positive sample s (RT-PCR and Bio -Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615229])  will be sequenced by [CONTACT_479317] . Once  [ADDRESS_615230] been identified , no further sequencing will be performed.   Additionally, to en sure 10 -20% of the 
samples are low positive, a  cycle threshold  (Ct) count will be performed for all RT -PCR positive samples.  Low 
positives are defined as samples in which any gene target is within [ADDRESS_615231]’s of the mean Ct count of the RT-PCR 
comparator  test’s LoD . The following information will be collected and provided in the EUA application.

8. Study Procedures  
8.1. Screening  
8.1.1.  Informed consent  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Study staff will be notified upon presentation of eligible subjects to the clinical site.  Study 
staff trained in basic human research subject’s protection will explain the study protocol, 
procedures and objectives to the patient and obtain written informe d consent and assent (if 
applicable) for participation in the study from each subject prior to performing any study 
procedures in accordance with requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations 
(CFR) Title 45, Part 46 and Title 21, Part 50.  This will be done by [CONTACT_479318] /Assent form (if applicable), allowing the subject ample time 
  
BioTeke_Home Use_Clinical Performance Study_V2.0_5 May 2022.docx  Page 17 of 26 to review the form(s), ask questions and have their questions answered to the satisfaction of 
the Subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Subjects  wishing to participate will be asked to sign the Consent/Assent form (if applicable) 
and will be provided with a copy for their records; the original will be maintained with the 
Subject’s study records.  The Consent/Assent Form will be presented to the el igible Subjects 
in a language that is fully comprehensible to the Subject.  
8.1.2.  Vulnerable Populations  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Studies will be conducted in accordance with the relevant articles of the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  The Declaration of Helsinki defines vulnerable ind ividuals as having “An 
increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm.”  For the purpose of 
this study,  we define vulnerable individuals as those whose capacity to protect or exercise 
their rights is restricted due to their mental, s ocial, economic or ethnical status, age or health 
condition.  Subjects deemed vulnerable by [CONTACT_4158]/or the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_479305].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  This study involves children who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatment or 
procedures involved in research and are a vulnerable population.  Children are a group 
already burdened by [CONTACT_4113] -[ADDRESS_615238] Eligibility  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Once written informed consent has been obtained from the subject, a  Case Report Form 
(CRF ) will be completed to document adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Where a subject fails to fulfill any element of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, this will 
be documented and the signed consent form and completed inclusion/exc lusion criteria 
retained by [CONTACT_079].  The subject will not be advanced any further into this 
clinical investigation.  
8.2. Study Enrollment  
8.2.1.  Subject Identification  
[IP_ADDRESS]  When a subject is considered eligible for entry into this clinical stud y, the subject will be 
allocated a study -specific number (Subject ID number).  This number will be a unique 
identifier to the subject and written on each page of the CRF, and all other documentation 
relating to that subject.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The Subject ID number w ill consist of the study site testing location  number and a sequential 
enrollment number at that location . For example, the third subject enrolled at site [ADDRESS_615239] ID 01 -003. 
[IP_ADDRESS]  The Principal Investigator (PI) or designee at each site wi ll maintain a master log that will 
correlate each Subject ID number to the subject’s name.  This log will remain at the study 
site and will be confidential . 
8.2.2.  Subject Information  
[IP_ADDRESS]  The following information will be obtained and documented on the approp riate CRF for all 
subjects enrolled in the study:  
• Age (age of the subject and of the person performing the test)  
• Sex  
• Race  
• Ethnicity  
• Level of education  (of the person performing the test)  
  
BioTeke_Home Use_Clinical Performance Study_V2.0_5 May 2022.docx  Page 18 of 26 • Occupation (of the person performing the test)  
• Exposure to someone with COVID -[ADDRESS_615240] . 
• Presence or absence of  one or more  COVID -19 symptoms, specifically: fever over 100° 
F or chills; cough; shortness of breath; difficulty breathing; muscle or body aches ; 
fatigue; sore throat; headache;  congestion or runny nose;  new loss of taste or smell.  
Subjects will be asked how many days prior to the test the symptoms appeared.  
• COVID -[ADDRESS_615241] 
dose.   
8.3. Group Assignment  
8.3.1.  Subjects  will b e assigned to one of two groups: Self -Test or Pediatric Test .  
[IP_ADDRESS] The Self -Test group will include the subject  only. [IP_ADDRESS] The Pediatric group will 
include an adult tester and a pediatric subject (age 2 – 13). 
8.3.2.  The healthcare practitioner will first collect the SOC sample.  To mitigate any potential bias which 
may affect the subject’s visual interpretation of the Bio-Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615242] (or adult tester ) will be provided with the Bio-Self COVID -[ADDRESS_615243]  
and the Quick Reference Instructions  (QRI) .  
8.3.5.  After a minimum o f [ADDRESS_615244]  (or adult tester) sample collection , the healthcare 
practitioner will collect the nasal sample from the subject ,  that will be used for  the Comparator.  
8.3.7.    A minimum of [ADDRESS_615245] will be aske d 
to blow their nose prior to collecting each sample.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] The  comparator sample will be labeled with the subject’s study identification number.  
[IP_ADDRESS] The comparator sample will be shipped to the CLIA laboratory conducting the RT -PCR test . 
A Ct val ue will be obtained for all RT -PCR positive samples.   A minimum of [ADDRESS_615246] . Confirm a time and date for an 
unscheduled visit . 
8.4.3.  Follow the steps under Section 8.3.2. – 8.3.5.

course of a study (with onset after the first study -specific procedure), whether or not that event is 
conside red study -related.  
11.2.2.  An adverse event may be mild, moderate or severe and are usually unexpected.  
11.2.3.  All adverse events observed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_479306], must be 
reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_615247] been produced by [CONTACT_206093]. For the purpose of this study, only the collection of nasal nares swab s is considered to 
be the study procedure s. 
11.3. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
11.3.1.  A Serious Adverse Event  (SAE) is any adverse event that:  
• led to death  
• led to a serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either resulted in a life -
threatening illness or injury, or a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body 
function, or in-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] , or in 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent 
impairment to a body structure or a body function  
• led to foetal  distress, foetal  death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect  
11.3.2.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_206080] [ADDRESS_615248] be reported to the Sponsor by [CONTACT_16470] 24 hours of 
the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_206081].    
11.3.4.  The Sponsor will be contact[CONTACT_479320]:  
Contact [CONTACT_5627]:  Chang Oh Turkmani  
 
Telephone Number:   [PHONE_10026]  
 
11.3.5.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_206082] -up measures in 
accordance with good medical practice but should notify the monitor of such actions and 
record them in the Subject’s CRF .  Each telephone reported reaction must b e reported in 
writing to the monitor within [ADDRESS_615249] 
anterior nares  (nasal)  swab .  The risks of collecting a nasal nares swab may include symptoms 
associated with standard collection practices such as slight p ain, minor bleeding.  Subjects will 
be identified using a study specific number at the time of enrollment.  All study forms and any 
associated laboratory reports will be labeled with the subject  number.  No identifiable patient 
information will be provided  to the Sponsor . No patient treatment or management decisions will 
be based on any results generated from this study , with the exception of the Standard of Care 
sample . 
11.4.2.  Information collected for this study is confidential. However, officials of FDA or othe r 
regulatory agencies may research records during ordinary course of carrying out their functions. 
A sponsor representative may also inspect research records to make certain the study data is 
accurate.  The Investigator, institution, regulatory agencies an d Sponsor will protect the 
confidentiality of the records.  
11.4.3.  No medical decisions will be based on investigational assay results generated as part of the 
study.  
12. Regulatory and Administrative Requirements  
12.1. FDA Guidance on EUA  
FDA Guidance on EUA testing and data acknowledges these products are not subject to [ADDRESS_615250] protection regulations (45 CFR 46) apply.  This study does not meet the definition of a clinical 
investigation as defined by [ADDRESS_615251] to IRB surrogate determination of risk. This study is, 
however, a non-significant risk (NSR) study in that nasal sample collection is not considered invasive and the test 
results will not be used to manage clinical care. Implementa tion of this study will include waiver of otherwise -
applicable GCPs to accommodate the emergency response COVID -[ADDRESS_615252] of the study at their site(s).  The investigator will 
ensure that the study is conducted in compliance with GCP, the protocol, the Clinical Study Agreement, and 
applicable regulations in 45 CFR 46, and any other applicable regulatory req uirements.  These requirements include:  
• Obtaining IRB approval for the study and related documents before study initiation and enrolling Subjects.  
• Obtaining informed consent from each subject in accordance with 21 CFR Part 50, as applicable.  
• Protecting th e rights, safety, and welfare of Subjects under their care.  
• Reporting adverse events.  
• Coordinating and providing reasonable medical care to subjects for an adverse event  related to study 
participation.  
• Reporting protocol deviations to the sponsor and IRB p er IRB requirements.  
• Maintaining traceability and secured storage of all test kits and study samples.

implementation.  
12.6. Reco nciliation of Study Material, Supplies and Samples  
The Sponsor will supply sufficient quantities of study materials and supplies to enable the site to complete the study 
and the site will return all unused materials and supplies to the Sponsor  or dispose o f according to provided 
instructions. The site is required to maintain the inventory of these materials provided and document the 
reconciliation of these materials. If materials are disposed at the study site, the Investigator must provide the Sponsor 
with a signed record of disposition.  
 
13. Statistical Considerations  
Except where otherwise specified, the following general principles apply to the planned statistical analyses. All 
statistical analysis will be conducted using a current version 9.4 (or later) of SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), 
Excel version 2010 or later, or other widely accepted  statistical or graphical software as required.   Continuous 
variables (e.g., age) will be summarized by [CONTACT_14458]; mean, standard deviation and median. Categorical  
variables (e.g., sex) will be summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Confidence intervals (CI) may be 
presented, where appropriate, using the exact method for categorical variables.  In general, percentages will be 
displayed to [ADDRESS_615254] include subjects in the following age groups:  
• <14 years of age, where the Parent o r legal guardian collects a sample from their child (e.g., age 2 -13) 
and performs the test  
• 14-24 years of age  
• 25-64 years of age  
• ≥65 years of age

14. Ethical Considerations  
The investigator and site study staff will be responsible for the ethical conduct of this study in accordance with [ADDRESS_615260] (IRB) responsible for the 
studies to be conducted at each site or a central IRB must provide written approval of the protocol 
and informed  consent. The investigator will provide IRB documentation for all applicable IRB 
submissions to the Sponsor. If IRB approval is withdrawn, the investigator will immediately 
report this to the Sponsor.  
14.2. Informed Consent Process  
14.2.1.  Informed consent is a process that is initiated prior to the Subject’s agreement to participate 
in the study and continues throughout the study participation.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_479309], including any risks and benefits, it s purpose 
and procedures, and expected duration of involvement in the clinical study.  Each patient must be 
informed that participation in the clinical study is voluntary and non -participation will not affect 
his / her right to the most appropriate treatme nts or affect the doctor/clinician -patient relationship.  
Each patient must be given sufficient time to decide whether they wish to participate and have all 
their queries addressed prior to signing the IRB -approved consent form(s).  A copy of the signed 
consent form(s) must be provided to the patient.  Study specific procedures will not be initiated 
until the Subject has signed and dated the appropriate consent forms(s).  Patients have full rights 
to withdraw from the clinical study at any time, irrespectiv e of their initial consent.  
14.2.2.  Each Subject must also give their permission for representatives of the Sponsor, auditor and 
regulatory authorities to review their hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1248].  
14.2.3.  Written informed consent from the Subject must be obtained before any clinical 
investigation related procedures are performed.  
14.3. Subject Confidentiality  
14.3.1.  Confidentiality of Subject data will be maintained at all times.  Subject anonymity will be 
guaranteed a nd all documentation relating to a Subject will be kept in a secure location.  
14.3.2.  Study  documents  provided  to the  Sponsor will be stored  in a secure  location  with access.  
None  of the stored  documents  will contain  any personal  identifying  information  or direct  
identifiers. 
14.3.3.  Study  files will be made  available  to the IRB,  regulatory  authorities,  Sponsor  (or 
designee)  and/or  clinical  study  staff should  they request  access  for auditing  purposes.

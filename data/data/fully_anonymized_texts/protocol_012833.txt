 3 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE 
Influenza virus infection represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the [LOCATION_002], 
resulting in 9.2 -35.6 million illnesses, 140,000 -710,000 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_602], and 12,000- 56,000 deaths 
annually since 2010 (1). This results in life- years lost, quality of life reduced, and an economic and 
medical cost of between $71 billion and $[ADDRESS_945892] that influenza can 
trigger deadly pandemics such as the 1918 pandemic that resulted in the deaths of 50 million to 
100 million people (3 -5% of the global population), these data illustrate the high level of priority 
needed to curb the public health threat of influenza. Influenza continues to be a problem due to the 
problems with the current vaccine strategy. Now our vaccines incorporate on ly three or four of the 
large number of circulating strains, with no adjuvant except for the elderly, and provide only 10 -
60% protection from influenza infection ( 2). Annual modifications of the vaccine are required each 
year, based on predictions of the n ext season’s circulating strains. This strategy is often thwarted 
by [CONTACT_697057]. In addition to the issues 
with seasonal influenza, pandemic influenza typi[INVESTIGATOR_697044], fo r which 
entirely new vaccines are required, significantly hindering our preparedness. These reasons and 
more highlight the necessity for a better understanding of the key components of an effective 
immune response and how this could lead to a universal vac cine.  In study, we will use twins to 
investigate the role of genetics in immune response to both inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV 4) and 
live attenuated inactivated vaccine ( LAIV4 ). 
 
3.1 Potential Risks and Benefits  
3.1.1 Potential Risks 
 
This protocol will immunize children and adult participant s with either IIV4 (intramuscular ) or 
LAIV4 ( intranasal) vaccines that are licensed and recommended for use in the age groups 
studied. The discomforts of this study are those of  receiving IM injection or intranasal  
application of the vaccine,  and blood drawn from an arm vein, and possible reactions to the 
vaccine. Drawing blood causes transient discomfort and may cause fainting. Infection at the 
site where blood will be drawn or where the vaccination  is given is extremely unlikely, but is 
a potential risk. Bruising at the site of blood drawing may occur, but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_697058]. Immediate allergic reactions to vaccine, including anaphylaxis, are in general extremely 
rare (appr oximately 1 person in 4,000,000), and might occur as a skin rash such as hives, 
difficulty breathing, fainting, drop in the blood pressure and death. Such reactions can 
usually be stopped by [CONTACT_697059]. Vaccine 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_697045], headaches, body aches, and  
fatigue. These reactions are usually greatest within the first [ADDRESS_945893] 1 to 2 days. Analgesics (e.g., aspi[INVESTIGATOR_697046]
â) and rest will generally relieve or 
moderate these symptoms. Other hypersensitivity reactions, including Arthus  reactions 
resulting in large local swelling reactions, are also possible. Although Guillain -Barré 
syndrome may have been associated with the 1976 -77 inactivated swine influenza vaccine 
and TIV vaccines used in early 1990's, subsequent inactivated vaccines have not been 
associated with an increased risk of this condition. LAIV4  has the potential for transmission 
of influenza to close contacts with severely weakened immune systems (requiring care in a protected environment, such as a bone marrow transplant u nit).  It is not known whether

 LAIV4 ( FluMist Quadrivalent ) is excreted in human milk. Because some viruses are 
excreted in human milk,  lactating wom en will not be eligible for this study .

 Assessment of vital signs will include measurement of resting blood pressure, pulse, 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and temperature. Weight should be measured in kilograms.  Height should 
be measured in centimeters. 
 
6.6.8 Phlebotomy  
 
Phlebotomy will be performed at each visit using antiseptic technique . See Appendix 1: 
Blood Draw Requirements for blood draw instructions for each visit. Maximal amount for the 
blood draw will be based on weight and will not exceed 3% of total blood volume in a 24 -
hour period consistent with the World Health Organization gui dance. (3) 
 
6.6.9 IIV4 or LAIV Administration  
 
Participants will be administered the seasonal IIV4 vaccine  in the left or right deltoid muscle 
using antiseptic technique  or into the vastus lateralis  (right or left) for participants younger 
than [ADDRESS_945909] ® Quadrivalent; approximately one -half of the 
contents should be administered into each nostril. 0.1 mL (i.e., half of the dose from a 
single FluMist sprayer) is administered into each nostril while the recipi[INVESTIGATOR_697053]. Insert the tip of  the sprayer just inside the nose and rapi[INVESTIGATOR_697054]- divider clip stops the plunger. The dose divider clip is removed from the 
sprayer to administer the second half of the dose (0.1 mL) into the other nostril.  
Volunteers will be observed in clinic for 15 minutes  after vaccination to monitor for any 
immediate serious reactions.

 7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND TOXICITY MANAGEMENT  
7.1 Definitions of AEs, Adverse Reactions, and Serious Adverse 
Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant 
administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintend ed 
sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs may also include pre -or 
post-treatment complications that occur as a result of protocol specified proced ures, lack of 
efficacy, overdose, drug abuse/misuse reports, or occupational exposure. Preexisting 
events that increase in severity or change in nature during or as a consequence of 
participation in the clinical study will also be considered AEs. An AE doe s not include the 
following:  
 
• Medical or surgical procedures such as surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, and 
transfusion. The condition that led to the procedure may be an adverse event and must be 
reported   
• Pre-existing diseases, conditions, or laboratory abnormalities present or detected before 
the Screening Visit that do not worsen  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_63805], social and/or convenience admissions)  
• Overdose without clinical sequelae  
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date 
before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol -associated procedure is not 
an AE. It is considered to be pre -existing and should be documented as medical history.  
 A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an event that results in the following:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening (note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it we re more severe.)  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• A medically important event or reaction; such events may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_697055]. Medica l and 
scientific judgment must be exercised to determine whether such an event is reportable 
under expedited reporting rules. Examples of medically important events include intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; bloo d dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; and development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse. For the avoidance of doubt, infections resulting from contaminated medicinal 
product will be considered a medically important event and be subject to expedited 
reporting requirements.  
 
The Effects of Attenuated Versus Inactivated Flu Vaccine in Twin Sets. V1_ 13AUG2019      
                                        
[ADDRESS_945910] be 
recorded as an AE, as well as an SAE, if applicable. In addition, laboratory or other 
abnormal assessments (e.g., electrocardiogram, x -rays, vital signs) that are associated with 
signs and/or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the definit ion of an 
AE or SAE as described above. If the laboratory abnormality is part of a syndrome, record 
the syndrome or diagnosis (e.g., anemia), not the laboratory result (i.e., decreased 
hemoglobin).  
7.2 Assessment of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Event  
 
The Protocol Director is responsible for assessing AEs and SAEs for causality and severity, and for final review and confirmation of accuracy of event information and assessments.  
 
The Protocol Director is responsible for assessing the relationship to study drug treatment 
using clinical judgment and the following considerations:  
 
• No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug. For SAEs, an alternative causality must be provided (e.g., pre -existing 
condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication).  
 
• Yes: There is reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_155137].  
 
Ineffective treatment should not be considered as causally related in the context of adverse 
event reporting. The relationship to study procedures (e.g., invasive procedures such as 
venipuncture or biopsy) should be assessed using the following considerati ons:  
 
• No: Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study procedure.  
 
• Yes: The adverse event occurred as a result of protocol procedures (e.g., 
venipuncture).  
 
The severity grading of AEs will be assessed as Grade 1, 2, 3, or 4 using the Common 
Terminology for Adverse Effects, Version 5.0, November 27, 2017, located at 
https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quic
k_Reference_8.5x11.pdf  and Grade 2 or higher AEs recorded. 
 
For AEs associated with laboratory abnormalities, the event should be graded on the basis 
of the clinical severity in the context of the underlying conditions; this may or may not be in 
agreement with the grading of the laboratory abnormality.

[ADDRESS_945911] consents to 
participate in the study (i.e., signing the informed consent) and throughout the duration of 
the study, including the protocol -required post treatment follow -up period, must be reported 
on the CRF. This also includes any SAEs resulting from protocol -associated procedures 
performed from screening onwards. All AEs, regardless of cause or relationship, that occur 
from initiation of study drug until [ADDRESS_945912] dose of study drug (whichever is longer), regardless of 
causality, should also be reported. All AEs should be followed up until resolution or until the 
adverse event is stable, if possible. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after the [ADDRESS_945913] em 
(VAERS) per federal regulations. The VAERS form will simultaneously be sent to the sponsor.  SAEs and events that meet the Prompt Reporting guidelines (events meeting the 
criteria for Unanticipated Problems) will also be reported to the Stanford IRB as required.  
Unexpected deaths or life -threatening experiences related to the research will be reported 
to the sponsor and to the IRB within 5 working days from when the investigator learns of event.  SAEs not related to vaccine will be reported to the IRB o n an annual basis.  
 
7.5 Safety Oversight  
 
The Clinical Core Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_697056], the 
participant’s safety and any unanticipated problems involving risks to participants and will 
report these events as described above.  Unanticipated problems and serious  adverse 
events will be reported to the Stanford IRB as required.

 14 PUBLICATION POLICY  
 
Following completion of the study, the investigator may publish the results of this research 
in a scientific journal. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) 
member journals have adopted a trials -registration policy as a condition for publication. This 
policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as 
ClinicalTrials.gov , which is sponsored by [CONTACT_1055] (NLM). Other 
biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies. Any clinical trial starting 
enrollment after 27SEP2007 must be registered either on or before the onset of participant 
enrollment.  
 
The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human 
subjects to intervention or comparison groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship 
between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Studies designed for o ther purposes, 
such as to study pharmacokinetics or major toxicity ( e.g., Phase 1 trials), would be exempt 
from this policy.

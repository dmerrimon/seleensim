A Phase 1/2a Dose -escalation Study of FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 for 
the Treatment of Advanced Hematologic Malignancies  
Name [CONTACT_3261]:   
4-carbamoylimidazolium -5-olate   Phase of Development:   
Phase 1/2 a 
Primary Objective:   
• To determine the safety and tolerability in subjects who receive FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01 for the treatment 
of advanced hematologic malignancies 
Secondary Objectives: 
• To de termine the overall response rates  
• To evaluate the proportion of subjects  who achieve hematologic improvement in peripheral b lood 
or bone marrow blast count 
• To evaluate progression -free survival (PFS)  
• To evaluate overall survival (OS)  
• To evaluate the  pharmacokinetics of FF -[ZIP_CODE] and M1  
• To evaluate xanthosin e monophosphate (XMP)  as a pharmacodynamic marker 
Methodology:   
This is a Phase 1/2a, dose- escalation study of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 for the treatment of adv anced 
hematologic malignancies.  
A total of up to N= 68 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects with acute myelogenous 
leukemia (AML)  (Phase 1 only) , myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia (CMML) will be included.  
Major selection criteria are: age ≥ 18 years, confirmed MDS/CMML or AML (Phase 1 only for 
AML) with documented disease progression f ollowing previous therapy, or subjects with AML ≥ 
60 years of age who are not candidates for other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]  (Phase 1 only) . Subjects must be ≥ 3 
weeks beyond chemotherapy, radiotherapy, major surgery, or other experimental treatments, and 
recovered from all acute toxicities ( ≤ Grade 1), have adequate renal and hepatic function, and no 
known history of significant cardiac disease.  
Phase 1 :  
14-day Schedule: Following Screening, a total of 6 cohorts of 3 subjects each received oral doses 
of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 mg/m2 BID per day (100, 200, 400, 600, 800 or 1000 mg/m2/day) 
for 14 days, followed by 14 days off, repeated every 28 days (= 1 cycle). Three events of drug-
related atrial fibrillation (Grade 2) were reported in 2 subjects at a dose of 500 mg/m2 BID (Cohort 
6). Study drug was suspended in both subjects and all events resolved with oral metoprolol 
treatment. These events were medically important events and thus met the definition of dose -
limiting toxicity (DLT). No further enrollment wa s made at this dose level. The maximally tolerated 
dose (MTD) was declared at 1 dose level below the dose eliciting DLT, 400 mg/m2 BID, and this

Methodology continued:  
cohort was expanded to [ADDRESS_532432] been observed in N=7 total subjects  treated at 
400 mg/m2 BID x 14 days. 
21-day Schedule:  At the MTD  of 400 mg/m2 BID, Cohort 7 was added to extend the BID dosing 
schedule to 21 days followed by 7 days off, repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle) (Amendment 3). 
28-day Schedule: At the MTD  of 400 mg/m2 BID, Cohort 8 was added to extend the BID dosing 
schedule to 28 days continuous dosing each 28 days (=1 cycle) (Amendment 4) . 
DLT is  defined as Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting 7 days or more; Grade 3 nonhematologic 
toxicity of any dur ation not amenable to supportive care; failure of platelets, absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC), or hemoglobin (Hb) to recover to Grade 1 within 12 weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_421848] (RBC) transfusions and/or growth factors; febrile neutropenia (defined as 
ANC<1000/mm3 with a single temperature of > 38.3°C or sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C for over 
one hour); Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding; or other important medical event. 
For all subject cohorts, if 1 of 3 subjects per coh ort experiences DLT, the cohort will be expanded 
to 6. If 2 of 6 subjects per cohort experience DLT, all further dose escalation will stop. If 0 of 3 or 
≤ 1 of 6 subjects per cohort experience DLT by [CONTACT_2006] 28 following dosing of FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01, dose  
escalation will proceed to the next cohort. At the MTD of 400 mg/m2 BID, the longest schedule of 
administration below the schedule of administration eliciting DLT will be declared the 
recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and schedule. A total of [ADDRESS_532433] dose escalation will be allowed from previous dose levels/schedules 
of administration until at least one subject has completed Cycle 1 at the longer schedule of 
administration (e.g., 21 or 28 days) with no Grade [ADDRESS_532434] the option to extend their current dosing schedule to 21 days, 
followed by 7 days off, repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle), or [ADDRESS_532435] schedule, if seen in the patient’s best interest by [CONTACT_1961]. Dose level adjustments for DLT will be made. Subjects who experience DLT at the 
first dose level, 50 mg/m2 BID, will not be dose- reduced. Up to 48 sub jects are planned for Phase 
1. 
Phase 2a : Once 6 subjects are treated at the RP2D and schedule in Phase 1, 1 additional cohort will 
enroll 20 subjects with MDS/CMML who have relapsed from, or are refractory to, prior 
hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy. Subjects  enrolled in Phase 1 at the RP2D and schedule and 
who meet the Phase 2a selection criteria will count towards the Phase 2a accrual. Dose level 
adjustments for adverse events will be made.  
During the study, a Safety Review Committee, consisting of the activ ely recruiting investigators, 
the Medical Monitor, and FPHU, will review data from each cohort on an ongoing basis.

Methodology continued :  
Subjects on the 21- day schedule will receive FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 on a BID schedule . For all subjects on 
the 21- day dosing schedules , blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment of FF -[ZIP_CODE] and M1 
in plasma will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose (any time), between 0.5-[ADDRESS_532436]-dose, and Day 15 pre- dose (within  15 minutes prior to dosing), between 0.5- [ADDRESS_532437]-dose.  
Blood concentration of xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) will be assessed a s a pharmacodynamic 
endpoint.  
For subjects on the 21- day dosing schedules , blood samples for XMP assessment will be collected 
on Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose (any time), between 0.5- [ADDRESS_532438] -dose, 
and Day 15 pre -dose (within 15 minutes prior to dosing), between 0.5- [ADDRESS_532439]-dose.  
Disease assessments, including ana lysis of blood and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], will be performed at 
the end of Cycle 1 and Cycle  3 and every 2 cycles thereafter . Disease assessments may be 
performed at other time points at the discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects who demonstrate objective  response ( OR) or stable disease ( SD) will be allowed to 
continue therapy with FF -[ZIP_CODE]- [ADDRESS_532440]’s condition that prevents further study 
participation. 
Blood for hematology, platelet and serum chemistry determinations will be collected within [ADDRESS_532441] s and Centers :  Phase 1 : Up to 48 subjects are planned for the dose- escalation 
phase. Phase 2a : A total of 20 subjects with MDS/CMML treated at the RP2D  are planned, 
including MDS/CMML subjects treated at the RP2D  in Phase 1. Therefore, up to 68 total subjects 
are planned.  
The study will be conducted at up to seven  sites.  
Duration of Study:  The accrual phase for the Phase 1 do se escalation phase is expected to be 12 
– 18 months . The expected accrual for the Phase 2a expansion phase is expected to be 6 – [ADDRESS_532442] followed up to 6 months , for a total study duration of 30 – 36 months. 
The anticipated accrual rate for the Phase 2a portion is 4 – 5 subjects per month.

Investigational P roduct:    
FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01 is an oral antimetabolite anticancer drug. It is a competitive inhibitor of inosine 5’ - 
monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) . FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01 is supplied in 50 and 200 mg tablets  for 
oral administration. FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 should be stored at room temperature (20 – 25 °C). 
FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01 is manufactured for FPHU by [CONTACT_49860] (Missisauga, Ontario, Canada) and will be 
provided by [CONTACT_456] (FPHU). 
Reference Therapy:   None  
Statistical Methods:   
Safety Endpoint Analyses: 
Safety endpoints for AEs include the following: incidences of all treatment -emergent adverse 
events ( TEAEs ) and all serious adverse events ( SAEs ); incidences of TEAEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_926]; 
incidences of TEAEs and SAEs by [CONTACT_421875]; incidences of all Grade 3 and 
4 TEAEs and by [CONTACT_421876]; and discontinuation of subject s 
from the study due to AEs or death. Safety endpoints for AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs , 
ECGs  and physical examinations will be specified in the statistical analysis plan.  All safety 
endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Efficacy Endpoint Ana lyses : 
The primary endpoint will be the proportion of subject s who achieve an objective response  (OR) 
as best response (CR, CRi or PR). Each dose cohort will be analyzed independently. For the primary efficacy endpoint, OR by [CONTACT_55542] (AML, MDS, CMML) will be summ arized using the number 
and percentage of subjects with an OR. The proportion of subject s with hematologic improvement 
in peripheral blood or bone marrow blast count and 90% confidence intervals will be estimated.  
For secondary endpoints, PFS and OS, curves will be estimated for each dose cohort and disease 
type using Kaplan-Meier product- limit estimates.  
Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Endpoint Analyses : Analysis plans will be described in 
the written plans provided by [CONTACT_421877].

1.1. FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 Background 
FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 (5-hydroxy-1H -imidazole -4-carboxamide 3/4 hydrate ), is the ¾ hydrate of 
FF-[ZIP_CODE], an oral antimetabolite anticancer agent. It is a potent competitive inhibitor of 
inosine 5’ - monophosphate dehydrogenase  (IMPDH) , a key enzyme involved in de novo 
purine synthesis, and inhibits deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis of guanine 
monophospha te from xanth osine monophosphate. The chemical structure and me chanism 
of action of FF-[ADDRESS_532454] a different spectrum of activity from conventional 
antipurinergic agents, 6- mercaptopurine (6 -MP) and 6- thioguanine (6 -TG). Most notably, 
SM-[ADDRESS_532455] on a 6 -MP-
resistant murine leukemia cell line, P388, than on 6- MP-sensitive strains. Among murine 
experiment al tumors, Ehrlich carcinoma, sarcoma 180, Lewis lung carcinoma, colon 26, 
colon 38, L1210 and P388 were highly responsive to SM -108, especially following 
intermittent administrations per day, rather than daily administration  and inhibited the 
growth of se lected human tumor cell lines derived from hematologic malignancies and 
some solid tumors (lung, prostate cancers and choriocarcinoma).

and 135 mg/m2/day with TID dosing (Q 8 hours).5 
Teratology studies previously conducted by [CONTACT_421879], rat and rabbit were 
positive.6 This is not an unexpected finding for cytotoxic agents used as anticancer 
treatment, and precautions will be taken to avoid pregnancy in the proposed clinical study.  
1.3. SM-108 Previous Human Experience 
A total of three SM -108 clinical studies in patients with hematologic malignancies or lung 
cancer were previously conducted by [CONTACT_421880] 1980s at doses ranging from 20 to 
2500 mg/m2. The majority of the Phase 2 study dose regimens were 100-300 mg/m2 BID 
(200 to 600 mg/m2/day). A total of 265 patient s were treated in these studies and efficacy 
was seen in patients  with hematologic malignancies.  
1.3.1. Phase 1 Study in Advanced Solid Tumors or Hematologic Malignancies 
In a Phase 1 study of oral SM -108 in patients w ith advanced solid tumors or hematologic 
malignancies , 73 patients were treated on a 5 -day consecutive schedule at doses ranging 
from 20 to 2500 mg/m2.5 Adverse events were reported in 23 of 73 patients (31.5%), 
however a correlation between adverse events and dose was unclear. The maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and doses eliciting dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) were  not 
determined. The most common adverse events reported were gastrointestinal; nausea (11 
patients, 15%), anorexia (7 patients, 10%), emesis  (5 patients, 7%). Elevated AST (to > 45 
U), ALT (to > 50U) and uric acid (to ≥ 8 mg/dL) also were noted in some patients. In 31 
patients with hematologic malignancies enrolled in the study, 2 of 3 patients with atypi[INVESTIGATOR_421851] a complete respon se, and 2 of 12 patients with ac ute myeloid leukemia 
(AML) and 1 of 1 patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) achieved a partial 
response (PR). Mean days to response ranged from 12 to 18 days. No responses were noted 
in the 42 patients with solid tum ors. 
A dose- dependent increase in serum levels of SM -108 were observed up to 2000 
mg/m2/day, with time to peak serum concentration (T max) of 2 hours at ≤ 100 mg/m2 and 
Tmax of 4 hours at doses ≥ 240 mg/m2. A total of 40 – 60% of the administered drug was 
excreted in active form in the urine  over [ADDRESS_532456] -dose , suggesting primary renal 
elimination . 
1.3.2. Phase 2 Study in Advanced Lung Cancer 
In an early Phase 2 study , 27 patients with  advanced lung cancer (primarily 
adenocarcinoma) received SM-108 at oral doses of 200 mg/m2 BID or TID (400 or 600 
mg/m2/day) for ≥ 2 weeks  (400 mg/m2/day) or for ≥ 4 weeks (600 mg/m2/day) .5 One patient 
achieved a minor response  at a dose of 600 mg/m2/day) . No true objective responses (ORs) 
were obser ved. The most commonly reported adver se events were gastrointestinal  
(anorexia, malaise, nausea/emesis) , in 4 of 12 (33%) and 6 of 15 (40%) of patients receiving 
400 and 600 mg/m2/day, respectively. The incidence of hematological adverse events 
(neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and decreased hemoglobin [ Hb]) was 2 of 12 (17%) and 
4 of 15 (27%) of patients receiving 400 and 600 mg/m2/day, respectively.  Nadirs occurred

was noted within 2 weeks. 
1.3.3. Phase 2 Study in Advanced Hematologic Malignancies 
A larger Phase 2 study was conducted in patients with advanced hematologic 
malignancies .7 A total of 165 patients  were enrolled; 85 had received prior therapy with 
antimetabolites, including 6 -MP or cytosine arabinoside (ara -C). Patients w ere treated  with 
SM-108 orally, at doses of 70, 200 or 300 mg/m2 BID ( 140, 400 or 600 mg/m2/day) . In 39 
patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 21 had complete responses (CRs) and 
6 had PRs for an OR rate of 69% .  Among 30 patients with AML, 7 had PRs (23%). Among 
36 patients with MDS, 1 had a CR, 12 had PRs for an ORR of 36%. For 13 patients with 
polycythemia rubra, 4 had CRs and 7 had PRs for an ORR of 84.6%). The RR rate was 
highest in patients with CML and MDS at doses of ≥ 600 mg/m2/day.  Clinical responses

In the K562 human myeloid leukemia cell line, FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01induced the expression of fetal 
hemoglobin (HbF) over a concentration range of 1 to 1000 μmol/L in a dose-dependent 
manner.8 Increased HbF  production in K562 cells is a measure of reactivation of fetal Hb 
production in K562 cells, hence a measure of induction of cell differentiation (Figure 2 ).

FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 was administered once orally at FF -[ZIP_CODE] (free form) doses of 10, 40, 80, or 
160 mg/kg to non- fasted female mice demonstrated that Cmax and the area under the 
concentration -time curve (AUC 0-24 and AUC) increased with increasing doses over the 
dose range of 10 to 160 mg/kg.15 The increase was nearly dose proportional from 10 to 80 
mg/kg and less than dose proportional from 80 to 160 mg/kg. The T max was 0.5 hours for 
all dose groups. The terminal half -time (t ½) ranged from 1.3 to 2.5 hours and was not dose 
proportional.  
Changes in plasma concentrations in fasted or non- fasted male rats after an oral or 
intravenous dose of 15 mg/kg of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 are shown in Figure 6. The bioavailability 
of FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 in fasted and non- fasted rats was 51.7% and 39.5%, respectively, 
indic ating that food effects are minimal.16 Half-life was slightly longer in the non- fasted 
animals (2.2 hours) versus the fasted animals ( 1.5 hours ).

amounts of radioactivity were noted in the colon contents, but radioactivity was at or below the limit of detection in all tissues at this time.  
Tissue distribution in the  elimination phase was investigated in male dogs orally dosed 
with a single dose of 15 mg/kg of 
14C-FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01.21 Levels were high in the liver at 48 
and 72 hours postdose. The tissue -to-plasma ratio of radioactivity at these times was 15.14

1.5.4. Metabolism 
Metabolites of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 in the plasma, urine, bile (rats only), and feces of rats and dogs 
were investigated.21,23,24 The parent drug, FF -[ZIP_CODE], the ribose form (M1), the glucuronic 
acid conjugate, the pyranoside form, and two sulfate conjugates were identified in the 
plasma and urine. Unknown metabolites were also identified in the plasma, urine, bile and feces.  
In an investigation of inhibitory effects on human liver cytochrome P -450 isozyme  activi ty 
(CYP1A2 , 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4), FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 mildly inhibited the 
metabolic activity of each isozyme studied as evidenced by [CONTACT_110669]
50s of not less than 1240 
μmol/L in each case.25 Therefore, no drug- drug interactions are expected.  
1.5.5. Excretion  
In non- fasted male rats receiving a single oral dose of 14C-FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01, 80.3%, 27.1%, 
and 2.5% of the radioactivity dosed was excreted in the urine, feces, and expi[INVESTIGATOR_421853] ,

CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_532464] -dose.26 Total cumulative excretion was 110.2%. The 
radioactivity excreted in the bile by [ADDRESS_532465] -dose was only 1.0% of the amount dosed.  
In non- fasted male dogs receiving a single oral dose of 14C-FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01, 76.63% and 
10.45% of the radioactivity dosed was excreted in the urine and feces, respectively, by [ADDRESS_532466] -dose.20 Moreover, 79.42% and 12.07% of the radioactivity dosed was excreted 
in the urine and feces by [ADDRESS_532467]-dose. Total cumulative excretion was 97.33%. 
Therefore, the kidney appears to be the major route of e limination (~80%) with a lesser 
amount of drug found in the feces (~10 – 20%). 
1.6. Toxicology 1.6.1. Repeat -dose Toxicity Studies in Rats  
A 2-week repeated oral dose toxicity study  of FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01 ( FF-[ZIP_CODE] equivalent doses of 
1, 5, 25 mg/kg/day) was conducted in rats.
27 At the dose of 25 mg/kg, suppressed body 
weight gain or weight loss, low food consumption, and gastrointestinal injury were 
observed, and two of the five males died. No abnormalities were noted with 1 mg/kg. 
Changes in hematological test values attributable to myelosuppression were observed at 
doses of 5 mg/kg and greater.  The MTD was determined to be 5 mg/kg/day ( 30 mg/m2/day).  
No deaths were observed in a 2 -week intermittent oral dose toxicity study in rats (3 cycles 
of FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01, as FF -[ZIP_CODE] equivalent doses of 15, 45, 90, or 180 mg/kg oral doses once 
daily for 2 consecutive days followed by [CONTACT_421884] 4 days).28 Suppre ssed body weight 
gain and myelosuppression were noted at the doses of 15 mg/kg and greater. Low food consumption and gastrointestinal injury were observed at doses of ≥ 90 mg/kg.  
No deaths were observed in a 1- month repeated  oral dose toxicity study of FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01 in 
rats (FF-[ZIP_CODE] equivalent doses of 0.6, 3, 15 mg/kg/day).
17 No abnormalities were 
observed at 0.6 mg/kg. At doses of 3 mg/kg and greater, suppressed body weight gain and a low bone marrow nucleated cell count were noted. Low food consumption, changes in 
hematological test values attributable to myelosuppression, and gastrointestinal injury were 
observed at 15 mg/kg. Suppressed body weight gain and low food consumption were observed continuously until the end of the recovery period in the males dosed with 15 
mg/kg, but the other changes recovered or showed tendencies toward recovery during a 1-month recovery period. The no observed adverse effect level in the 1 -month repeated oral 
dose toxicity study in rats was 0.6 mg/kg/day.  The MTD was determined to be 15 
mg/kg/day (90 mg/m
2/day).  
1.6.2. Repeat -dose Toxicity Studies in Dogs 
In a 2-week repeat oral dose toxicity study of FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01 in dogs  (FF-[ZIP_CODE] equivalent 
doses of 10, 30, 100 mg/kg/day), no deaths were observed, and no abnormalities were 
observed at 10 mg/kg.29 Gastrointestinal injury was observed at doses of 30 mg/kg and 
greater . In the 30 mg/kg group, histopathological examinations revealed slight cell debris 
in the crypt lumen of the duodenum and minimum single cell necrosis in the crypt 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_421854]. No abnormalities were noted in the other tests.  In the 
100 mg/kg group, soft stool, body weight loss, and low food consumption and weight loss were noted in one of the two animals, and the affected animal showed dark red area in the

were noted in electrocardi ography or other testing. In conclusion, gastrointestinal effects 
were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg and greater, and soft stool, body weight loss, and low 
food consumption were observed at 100 mg/kg in the study. The MTD was determined to be 100 mg/kg/day (2000 mg/m
2/day).  
In a 1 -month repeat oral dose toxicity study of FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01 in dogs ( FF-[ZIP_CODE] equivalent 
of 10, 30, 100 mg/kg/day), two of the five females dosed with 100 mg/kg were necropsied 
on Day  14 of dosing because of moribund condition.18 No abnormalities were observed at 
10 mg/kg. Gastrointestinal injury was observed at doses of 30 mg/kg and greater. Low food 
consumption and weight loss were noted at 100 mg/kg. In the recovery study, soft stool, which was noted during the treatment period, resolved on Day 5 of recovery (Day 1 of recovery is the day after the final dose). Body weight and food consumption rapi[INVESTIGATOR_421855]. The histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal tract and other changes 
observed during the dosing period had recovered or showed tendencies toward recovery in the tests performed at the end of the recovery period. In conclusion, gastrointestinal injury was observed in the males and females of the groups receiving 30 mg/kg or greater. The 
MTD was determined to be 30 mg/kg/day (600 mg/m
2/day).  
The dog proved to be the more relevant of the species regarding the tolerability of FF -
[ZIP_CODE]-01, as demonstrated in previous human clinical studies of SM-108. 
1.6.3. Genotoxicity  
Negative results were obtained in bacterial reverse mutation assays.30 
In vitro chromosomal aberration tests performed in a cell line derived from Chinese 
hamster lung (CHL/IU cells) showed that FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 induced chromosomal aberrations 
both with and without metabolic activation.31 
1.6.4. Photo toxicity  
The findings of visible -ultraviolet absorption spectrometry of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 indicate a low 
potential for phototoxicity.32 
Additional information can be found in the FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 Investigator ’s Brochure.  
1.7. FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 Experience in Human s 
1.7.1. Japan Phase 1 Study 
A Phase 1 study of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 conducted by [CONTACT_421885] (Toyama Chemical)  in Japan in 
patients with MDS, was completed . In this study, patients received FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01 at doses 
of 200, 300 and 400 mg BID (400, 600 and 800 mg/day)  for 14 days continuously followe d 
by 14 days off therapy (28 -day cycle) .33 A total of 9 patients were treated . No DLTs  were 
observed. One  study drug -related  serious adverse event ( SAE) (Grade 4 neutropenia) 
occurred in Cycle [ADDRESS_532468] treated with FF -[ZIP_CODE] 800 mg/day. Two study drug-
related  SAEs ( Grade 3 anemia and Grade 3 pneumonia) occurred in Cycle 5 in two subjects 
treated with FF -[ZIP_CODE] 400 mg/day. The most common adverse events (AEs) in all patients, 
regardless of causality, were anemia, rash, and platelet count decre ased (33.3%, 3 of 9

treatment cohort; 3 at 400 mg/day, 3 at 600 mg/day and 2 at 800 mg/day. 
The median number of treatment cycles were 4 (range 2 -5) at 400 mg/day, 13 (range 2 -18) 
at 600 mg/day, and 2 (range 1- 7) at 800 mg/day. One patient at 600 mg/day has received a 
total of 18 cycles to date and remains on study. C max and AUC increased with increasing 
FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01 dose. T max was 2 to 4 hours and the drug was near ly eliminated within 24 
hours after administration. The cumulative urinary excretion rate of FF -[ZIP_CODE] up to 24 
hours after administration was 25 to 45%. No accumulation of FF-[ZIP_CODE] was observed.  
1.7.2. U.S. Phase 1/2a Study 
Study FF1050101US101 is ongoing in the [LOCATION_002] in patients with AML, MDS or 
CMML . In Phase 1, dose levels of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/m2 BID for 14 days, 
followed by 14 days off therapy , or 400 mg/m2 BID for [ADDRESS_532469] been 
treated to date on study (25 AML, 8 MDS).  
Three events of drug -related atrial fibrillation (Grade 2) were reported in 2 subjects at a 
dose of 500 mg/m2 BID (Cohort 6). Study drug was suspended in both subjects and all 
events resolved with oral metoprolol treatment. These events were medically important 
events and thus met the definition of dose -limiting toxicity (DLT). No further enrollment 
was made at t his dose level. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was declared at 1 dose 
level below the dose eliciting DLT, 400 mg/m2 BID, and this cohort was expanded to [ADDRESS_532470] been observed in N=7 total subjects treated at 400 mg/m2 BID x 
14 days. 
At the MTD of 400 mg/m2 BID, Cohort 7 was added to extend the BID dosing schedule to 
21 days followed by 7 days off, repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle) (Amendment 3). No 
DLTs occurred  have occurred to date. 
At the MTD of 400 mg/m2 BID, Cohort 8 was added to extend the BID dosing schedule to 
28 days continuous dosing (=1 cycle) (Amendment 4). No DLTs have occurred  to date. 
The median number of prior treatments is 2 (range 1 - 7), all relapsed or refractory to prior 
hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine). The median number of treatment cycles 
is 2 (range 1 – 28).  
The most common AEs include Grade 1 or 2 fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea, with drug-
related Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported for 1 patient in the 200 mg/m2 BID dose group 
(thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and bone marrow aplasia) and 1 patient in the 300 mg/m2 
BID dose group (mucositis); the events resolved without sequelae. 
Partial remissions have occurred in 3 AML patients (50 , 100 and 400 mg/m2 BID) after 1 
– [ADDRESS_532471] 2 8, 5 and 6 cycles, respectively . A total of 8/25 (32%) AML 
patients, including the [ADDRESS_532472] attained stable disease control with no disease 
progression over 4 – 28 cycles.  A marrow complete response was achieved in 1 MDS 
patient tr eated at 400 mg/m2 BID x 14 days after 1 cycle and was sustained for 14 cycles . 
A major platelet response was observed in 1 patient treated at 400 mg/m2 BID x 21 days, 
sustained for 1 cycle. Four  of 8 MDS patients (50%), including the marrow CR, attain ed 
stable disease control with no disease progression over 3, 5, 14 and 17 cycles, respectively.

Potent suppression of circulating xanthosine monophosphate ( XMP ), a marker of IMPDH 
activity, has been observed following FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 administration on Day 1 of Cycles 1

1.8. Dose Rationale  
In the SM-108 Phase 2 study described above, patients with hematologic malignancies  
showed responses at  oral doses of 200 – 300 mg/m2 BID (400 – 600 mg/m2/day) 
administered for 14- day cycles . The toxicology findings in repeat dose studies in the rat 
and dog indicate a  dose of 15 mg/kg (equivalent to 90 mg/ m2) in the rat for up to 1 month 
was well -tolerated with few effects , and a dose of 10 mg/kg (equivalent to 200 mg/m2) in 
the dog up to 1 month exhibited no adverse effects. The dog appears to be the more relevant  
toxicology species based on prior human safety experience. Therefore, the starting dose in 
this study will be 50 mg/m2 BID, which represents a 4 -fold margin of safety over the MTD 
in the dog, escalating to 5 00 mg/m2 BID, administered orally in 14- day cycles.  
Since the study started, FF-[ZIP_CODE]- 01 has been found to be well-tolerated up to a dose of 
400 mg/m2 BID orally x  28 days continuous dosing . Long -term stable disease has been 
observed in some MDS and AML patients (up to 28 cycles) , as noted above. 
The regimen for phase 2 is 400 mg/m2 BID x 21 days out of a 28- day cycle.

3.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 1/2a, dose -escalation study of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 for the treatment of advanced 
hematolog ic malignancies.  
A total of up to N= 68 subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects with acute 
myelogenous leukemia (AML)  (Phase 1 only), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) will be included. 
Major selection criteria are: age ≥ 18 years, confirmed MDS/CMML or AML  (Phase 1 
only for AML)  with documented disease progression following previous therapy, or 
subjects with AML ≥ 60 years of age who are not candidates for other therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (Phase 1 
only) . Subjects mus t be ≥ 3 weeks beyond chemotherapy, radiotherapy, major surgery, or 
other experimental treatments, and recovered from all acute toxicities ( ≤ Grade 1), have 
adequate renal and hepatic function, and no known history of significant cardiac disease.  
Phase 1 :  
14-day Schedule: Following Screening, a total of 6 cohorts of 3 subjects each receive d oral 
doses of 50, 100, 200, 300, 400 or 500 mg/m2 BID per day ( 100, 200, 400, 600, 800 or 
1000 mg/m2/day) for 14 days, followed by 14 days off, repeated every 28 days (= 1 cycle). 
Three events of drug -related atrial fibrillation (Grade 2) were reported in 2 subjects at a 
dose of 500 mg/m2 BID (Cohort 6). Study drug was suspended in both subjects and all 
events resolved with oral metoprolol treat ment. These events were medically important 
events and thus met the definition of dose -limiting toxicity (DLT). No further enrollment 
was made at this dose level. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was declared at 1 dose 
level below the dose eliciting DLT,  400 mg/m2 BID, and this cohort was expanded to [ADDRESS_532473] been observed in N=7 total subjects treated at 400 mg/m2 BID x 
14 days. 
21-day Schedule: At the MTD of 400 mg/m2 BID , Cohort 7 was added to extend the BID 
dosing schedule to 21 days followed by 7 days off, repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle) 
(Amendment 3). 
28-day Schedule: At the MTD of 400 mg/m2 BID, Cohort 8 was added to extend the BID 
dosing schedule to 28 days continuous dosing each 28 days (= 1 cycle) (Amendment 4). DLT  is defined as Grade 4 hematologic toxicity lasting 7 days or more; Grade 3 
nonhematologic toxicity of any duration not amenable to supportive care; failure of 
platelets, absolute neutrophil count (AN C), or hemoglobin (Hb) to recover to Grade 1 
within 12 weeks despi[INVESTIGATOR_421856] (RBC) transfusions and/or growth 
factors ; febrile neutropenia (defined as ANC<1000/mm
3 with a single temperature of > 
38.3°C or sustained temperature of ≥ 38°C for over one hour); Grade 3 thrombocytopenia 
associated with bleeding ; or other important medical event. 
For all subject cohorts, if 1 of 3 subjects per cohort experiences DLT, the cohort will be expanded to 6. If 2 of 6 subjects per cohort experience DLT, all further dose escalation will stop. If 0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects per cohort experience DLT by [CONTACT_2006] 28 following dosing of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01, dose escalation will proceed to the next cohort. At the MTD of 400 mg/m

schedule to 21 days, followed by 7 days off, repeated every 28 days (=1 cycle)  or [ADDRESS_532477] schedule, if seen in the patient’s best 
interest by [CONTACT_458]. Dose level adjustments for DLT will be made. Subjects who experience DLT at the first dose level, 50 mg/m
2 BID, will not be dose -
reduced. Up to 48 subjects are planned for Phase 1. 
Phase 2a: Once 6 subjects are treated at the RP2D and schedule  in Phase 1, 1 additional 
cohort will enroll 20 subjects with MDS/CMML who have relapsed from , or are refractory 
to, prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy. Subjects enrolled in Phase 1 at the RP2D 
and schedule  and who meet the Phase 2a selection criteria will count towards the Phase 2a 
accrual. Dose level adjustments for adverse events  will be made.  
During the study, a Saf ety Review Committee, consisting of the actively recruiting 
investigators, the Medical Monitor, and FPHU, will review data from each cohort on an ongoing basis. 
Subjects on the 21- day schedule will receive FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 on a BID schedule. For all 
subjects on the 21- day dosing schedule s, blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessment of 
FF-[ZIP_CODE] and M1 in plasma will be collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose (any time), 
between 0.5- [ADDRESS_532478] -dose, and Day 15 pre -dose (within 15 
minutes prior to dosing), between 0.5-[ADDRESS_532479]-dose. Blood concentration of xanthosine monophosphate (XMP) will be assessed as a 
pharmacodynamic endpoint.

collected on Cycle 1 Day 1 pre-dose (any time), between 0.[ADDRESS_532480] -dose, and Day 15 pre -dose (within 15 minutes prior to dosing), between 0.5- [ADDRESS_532481]-dose. Disease assessmen ts, including analysis of blood and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_4026], will be 
performed at the end of Cycle 1 and  Cycle 3  and every 2 cycles thereafter . Disease 
assessments may be performed at other time points at the discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects who demonstrate objective response (OR) or stable disease ( SD) will be allowed 
to continue therapy with FF -[ZIP_CODE]- [ADDRESS_532482]’s condition that 
prevents f urther study participation.  
Blood for hematology, platelet and serum chemistry determinations will be collected within 2 8 days of Cycle 1 Day 1, on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1, on Day 1 of each 
subsequent cycle, and at the End of Study Visit. Urine wi ll be collected for urinalysis within

toxicity, contact [CONTACT_3433] e Medical Monitor to discuss the reasons for delay and plans for 
resuming study therapy. 
• Treatment  may be delayed up to [ADDRESS_532496]  has completed two cycles 
and, in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], is receiving benefit, treatment may be delayed 
for longer than 14 days and then resumed following a discussion with the Medical Monitor.  
• Subject s who experience a toxicity requiring reduction in dose level may continue 
treatment at the lower dose level until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Once the dose has been reduced it may not be escalated to the starting dose. 
• See Appendix B  for FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01 dose modification requirements.  
5.5. Supportive Care Guidelines  
• Medications may be administered for the management of symptoms associated with 
the administration of FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01, as required.

7. DESCRIPTION OF ASSES SMENTS  
7.1. Safety Assessments 7.1.1. Adverse Event Definition  
An adverse event ( AE) includes any noxious, pathological, or unintended change in 
anatomical, physiological, or metabolic functions as indicated by [CONTACT_30597], 
symptoms, and/or laboratory changes occurring whether or not temporally associated with study drug administration and whether or not considered related to study drug. This 
definition includes an exacerbation of pre -existing medical conditions or events, 
intercurrent illnesses, hypersensitivity reactions, drug interactions, or clinically significant laboratory findings.   
An AE does not  include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures, e.g., tooth extraction, transfusion, surgery (The 
medical condition that leads to the procedure is to be recorded as an AE.)  
• Pre-existing conditions or procedures present or detected at the start of the study 
that do not worsen 
• Hosp italization for elective surgeries or for other situations in which an untoward 
medical event has not occurred  
• Abnormal laboratory value, unless it is clinically significant  
• Overdose of study drug or concomitant medication unaccompanied by 
[CONTACT_23804]/symptoms ( If sign/symptoms occur, the final diagnosis should be recorded as 
an AE.)  
• Pregnancy by [CONTACT_5071], unless a complication occurs during pregnancy leading to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; in this case (The medical condition that leads to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_421861].) 
• A significant worsening of the disease under investigation which is captured as an 
efficacy parameter in this study and, thus, is not to be recorded as an AE.  
Protocol No. FF1050101US101   FUJIFILM Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 41  PROTOCOL  
October 12, 2017   Amendment 7  7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an adverse event  that results in any of the 
following outcomes: 
• Death  
• Life-threatening, i.e., immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred; (This 
does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more serious form, might 
have caused death.) 
• Persistent or substantial disability/incapacitation  
• Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based on medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in this definition.  
7.1.3. Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered "un expected" if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, is not consistent with the risk information described in the protocol or elsewhere. For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_421891]) if the Investigator’s Brochure listed only 
cerebral vascular accidents.  
"Unexpected," as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Investigator’s Brochure as occurring with a class  of drugs or as 
anticipated from th e pharmacological properties of the investigational therapy, but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the investigational therapy . 
7.1.4. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
The adverse event reporting period begins from the date of the first dose of study drug to 
[ADDRESS_532506] medical terminology on the AE CRF module . 
Whenever possible, the AE should be evaluated and report ed as a diagnosis rather than as 
individual signs or symptoms. For example, cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as ‘upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_4416]’. If a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs and symptoms should be recorded.  Dates of 
Protocol No. FF1050101US101   FUJIFILM Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 42  PROTOCOL  
October 12, 2017   Amendment 7  start (onset) and stop (recovery), action taken, and outcome will be recorded in the AE CRF 
module. 
All clinically significant abnormal changes in laboratory parameters will be recorded as an 
AE on the AE module, with the following exceptions: clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory changes determined to be related to the study condition and concomita nt 
conditions, e.g., diabetes, of which the investigator was previously aware and that have not worsened. 
The investigator will evaluate all AEs with regard to maximum intensity and relationship 
to study drug, as follows. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Maximum Intensity  
Maximum intensity should be assigned using one of the severity grades as outlined in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( NCI CTCAE 
v4.0) ; if the AE is not specifically listed in CTCAE v4.0 3, use the following grades: 
• Grade 1: mild 
• Grade 2: moderate 
• Grade 3: severe  
• Grade 4: life -threatening or disabling 
• Grade 5: death  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Relationship to Study Drug  
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to study drug  (or alternative causes, 
e.g., natural history of the underlying disea ses, concomitant therapy, etc.) will be 
determined by [CONTACT_421892]/or reactions of similar nature previously observed with study drug .  Each 
AE will be assigned one of the followi ng five categories:  
• Not related:  There is not a temporal relationship to the study drug (e.g., too early, 
too late ), or there is a reasonable causal relationship to another drug, concurrent 
illness, or circumstance.  
• Unlikely related:  There is a temporal relationship to study drug, but there is not a 
reasonable causal relationship between the time of study drug administration  and 
the AE (i.e., it is doubtful the AE is related to the study drug); could be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_1604], including under lying disease, complications, 
concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment. 
• Possibly related:  There is a reasonable temporal sequence from time of study drug 
administration  (e.g., occurred in a time frame relevant to study drug dose ); or for 
which the possibility of the study drug being the causative factor (e.g., existence of 
similar reports attributed to the study drug ; reactions attributable to the 
pharmacological effect) could not be excluded, although other factors such as 
Protocol No. FF1050101US101   FUJIFILM Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page 43  PROTOCOL  
October 12, 2017   Amendment 7  underlying disease, complicatio ns, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment are 
presumable.  
• Probably related:  There is a reasonable temporal sequence from time of study drug 
administration ; and for which the possibility of factors other than the study drug 
administration , such as underlying disease, complications, concomitant drugs, or 
concurrent treatment, could not be excluded as the cause.  
• Definitely related:  Follows a clear temporal sequence from time of study drug 
administration ; could not be possibly explained by [CONTACT_78456] ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy 
administered to the subject ; follows a response pattern known to be associated with 
study drug administration . 
7.1.6. Most Common ly Expected Adverse Events  
The most commonly reported adverse events in a Phase [ADDRESS_532507] s with 
hematologic malignancies at doses of 14 – 600 mg/m2 BID were nausea (9%), anorexia 
(7%), rash (4%), vomiting (4%), abdominal discomfort (2%) and pruritis (1%). Changes 
in lab oratory values were elevated ALT (10%), AST (9%), thrombocytopenia (5%), 
decreased hemoglobin (2%), neutropenia (2%) and decreased bilirubin (2%).  All other 
adverse events were reported at incidences of 1% or less.  Laboratory changes were reported 
as temp orary, ≤ Grade 2, and reversible. For bone marrow changes, nadir was reached in [ADDRESS_532508] be reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 
hours after the site becomes aware of the event. The investigator is encouraged to discuss 
with the Medical Monitor any adverse experiences for which the issue of reportability is unclear or questioned. The initial report should be followed by [CONTACT_63664] a more detailed SAE Report when follow-up information is available.   Gravity of AE  Reporting Time to  
FPHU/Westat  Type of Report  
Serious  Within [ADDRESS_532509]  death, the 
reason for death should be recorded as the SAE, with ‘death’ recorded as the outcome on 
the SAE CRF module. 
The SAE also will be recorded as an AE on the AE CRF module. Note: the SAE Report is 
different from the AE CRF. In areas of both forms where the same data are reported, the forms will be completed in a consistent manner. For e xample, the same term should be 
used for the AE on both forms, with the same start and stop dates, action taken, outcome, etc. A checkbox on the AE CRF module for whether the AE resulted in an SAE, will link the two types of report for a given event.  
An SAE Report should be prepared with as much available information concerning the event as possible so that a written report can be filed with the appropriate regulatory authorities. If causality cannot be determined definitively at the time of the SAE occurrence, it is important to notify FPHU/ Westat  within the timeline stated above, and to 
attribute the relationship as ‘Not Assessable’ (only applicable for the initial SAE Report). When new significant information is obtained and the outcome and attribution of  the event 
is known, the investigator will communicate this in a follow -up SAE Report. This relevant 
information will be provided in a timely manner to allow reporting to regulatory authorities within the required reporting period. Any SAE follow -up inform ation requested by 
[CONTACT_421893] /Westat  should be provided in a timely manner. 
As necessary, the SAE Report should be accompanied b y relevant pages from the CRFs , 
e.g., medical history, AEs, concomitant medications. Additional information may be requested by [CONTACT_421893] /Westat in an expedited manner to ensure that the initial reporting of 
the SAE made to the regulatory authorities complies with the required time frame. FPHU /Westat  may be required to collect and report additional information to the regulatory 
authorities in  a follow -up report, containing a final evaluation of the event, including copi[INVESTIGATOR_421862], autopsy reports, or other relevant information.  
7.1.8. Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Follow -Up 
All AEs and SAEs should be followed until resolution, return to baseline, or until the point it is deemed that further recovery is unlikely. All measures required for AE management and the ultimate outcome of the AE will be recorded in the source document and AE CRF module. 
7.1.9. Ongoing Safety Evaluation 
A study s afety evaluation will be conducted on a regular (monthly) basis by [CONTACT_577]. 
Dose exposure, dose -limiting toxicity, AE/SAE profiles and clinical laboratory 
abnormalities, and other safety measures will be reviewed during each convened meeting. Subject accrual will not be interrupted during the regular scheduled safety evaluations. 
These discussions will be led by [CONTACT_421894] .

7.2.3. Efficacy Endpoints 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
To evaluate the proportion of subjects with objective response achieved within 3 cycles of 
treatment with FF-[ZIP_CODE]-01 (i.e., within 3 months)  in subject s with relapsed/refractory 
AML  or relapsed/refractory high-risk MDS  or CMML .   
• Subjec ts with AML  
Objective responses for subjects  with AML include complete remission (CR), 
complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) and par tial 
remission (PR) as defined above.   
• Subjec ts with MDS  
Objective responses for subjec ts with high -risk MDS include  complete  
remission (CR), partial remission (PR), and marrow CR as defined above.  
• Subject s with CMML  
Objective responses for subjec ts with CMML include  complete  remission (CR), 
partial remission (PR) and marrow CR as defined above. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The proportion of subjects with MDS who have hematologic improvement in peripheral 
blood or bone marrow blast count at any time after initiation of treatment with FF -[ZIP_CODE]-
Protocol No. FF1050101US101   FUJIFILM Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc.  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  Page [ADDRESS_532511] count is defined as ≥ 50% reduction in peripheral 
blood or bone marrow blast count when compared with the baseline value. 
Progression- Free Survival: length of time from the date of first administration of study 
drug to the first objective evidence of disease progression or death, w hichever is earlier . 
Overall Survival: length of time from the date of first administration of study drug to the 
date of death from any cause   
7.2.4. Timing of Assessments to Determine Response  
Disease assessments will be made at the end of Cycle 1 and Cycle 3  and every two cycles 
thereafter . Disease assessments may be made at other time  points at the discretion of the 
Investigator.     
7.2.5. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
Mean plasma  concentrations of FF -[ZIP_CODE] will be determined at each time point. Because 
plasma  concentrations will be determined at a limited number of time points during the 
study, a complete pharmacokinetic profile of FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01 at each dose level will not be 
possible. Limited pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed. 
7.2.6. Pharmacodynamic (PD) Endpoint 
XMP i s an intermediate in purine metabolism. It is formed from inosine 
monophosphate via the action of  IMPDH, and is converted to guanosine monophosphate 
(GMP) via the action of  GMP synthase (see Figure 1 ). The mechanism of action of FF -
[ZIP_CODE]- 01, namely, inhibition of IMPDH, should be associated with a decrease in XMP. 
Therefore, as a measure of pharmacologic activity of FF -[ZIP_CODE]- 01 and preliminary 
measure of efficacy, levels of XMP in peripheral blood cells will be assessed in this study.  
8. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
Phase 1: The sample size reflects requirements associated with a 3+3 design. A total of 3 
to 36 subjects are plann ed (3 to 6 subjects in each of 6 dose cohorts).  
Phase 2: The sample size reflects an additional 20 M DS/CMML  patients to be treated at 
the MTD.  
8.2. Analysis Populations 
The full analysis set (FAS) includes all subjects who are administered any fraction of a dose of study medication.  For a particular measure, the per -protocol set (PPS) includes 
those subjects  in the FAS who have a valid baseline and one or more post -treatment 
assessments for that measure of interest.  
The FF -[ZIP_CODE]-01 PK population consists of all subjects in the FAS who complete all PK 
assessments.

number, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using number and frequencies. 
8.3.1. Safety Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Adverse Events  
All safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics and wi ll be based on 
the FAS dataset.  
All AEs will be coded based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA; Version 15.0 or higher). An AE will be considered a treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) if the onset is after the first dose of study drug or if t he condition was present at 
baseline but worsened after the first dose.  
All AEs for each subject will be listed, including intensity grading, relationship to study 
drug, action taken and outcome. Subject listings of deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to treatm ent discontinuation will be provided. Subject narratives will be provided for deaths, 
SAEs and other significant AEs. Summary tables will be prepared to examine TEAE severity and relationship to study treatment.  
AE summaries will be produced separately for  each dose cohort and overall, and each 
disease cohort by [CONTACT_151694]. All summaries will show, by [CONTACT_110590], dose cohort and overall, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least [ADDRESS_532512] 2% in any group or overall. 
SAEs will be summarized in a similar manner; overall, by [CONTACT_92254], 
and by [CONTACT_926].  
In addition to the above, summaries of the number and percentage of subjects disc ontinuing 
the study due to AEs and , due to death , will be presented.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Laboratory Data 
Laboratory data will be listed by [CONTACT_1130]. Values above and below normal ranges will be indicated, and whether statistically significant.

Data collected for physical examinations, ECGs and related measures will be listed.  
8.3.2. Efficacy Analyses  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects treated at  the MTD in each 
disease cohort ( AML , MDS or CMML) with objective response (OR) within 3 cycles of 
study drug (i.e., within 3 months). For subjects with AML, OR is CR, CRi, or PR, as 
defined above. For subjects with MDS or CMML , OR is CR, PR or marrow CR, as defined 
above . The proportion of subjects in each disease cohort treated at the MTD will be 
summarized, and 90% confidence intervals will be estimated.    
[IP_ADDRESS]. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The proportion of MDS subjects with hematologic improvement in the peripheral blood or bone marrow as defined as ≥ 50% reduction in blast count when compared with the baseline value. The 90% confidence interval will be estimated and provided.  
Progression- free survival and overall survival curves will be estimated at the M TD by 
[CONTACT_421897] -Meier product limit estimates. Median and 90% confidence 
interval of time -to-event will be estimated. Progression- free survival will be calculated 
from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of first objective evidence of disease 
progression or death, whichever is earlier. Overall survival will be calculated from the date of first dose of study drug to the date of death due to any cause. Subjects who did not experience progression or death will be censored at the last follow -up time point. 
8.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Endpoint Analysis  
Mean plasma concentrations of FF -[ZIP_CODE] and plasma M1 will be determined at each time 
point for evaluation of dose -linearity. B ecause a limited number of plasma  concentrations 
will be determined, full determination of routine pharmacokinetic parameters may not be possible. In addition to mean plasma concentrations, as the data allow, additional 
pharmacokinetic analyses will be provided (trough levels, t
1/2, Tmax, C max, AUC,  etc.)  
8.3.4. Pharmacodynamic Endpoint Analysis 
Change from baseline in XMP levels will be measured in blood samples collected from each subject during the study. Correlation s between XMP and PK level s of FF -[ADDRESS_532514] deviation, minimum, median, maximum, 
range, and coefficient of variation.     
8.3.5. Other Summaries

Per Title 21  of the US Government Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) Parts  [ADDRESS_532526] (IRB) before enrollment  of any subject s.  The 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_153340]. A copy of the letter of approval from 
the IRB and a copy of the approved informed consent form will be received by [CONTACT_421901]. 
The investigator will ensure that the IRB will be promptly informed of all changes in the 
research activity and of all unanticipated problems including risk to subject s. The 
investigator will also ensure that no changes will be made to the  protocol without IRB 
approval. 
As a part of the IRB requirement for continuing review of approved research, the 
investigator will be responsible for submitting periodic progress reports to the IRB at intervals appropriate to the degree of subject risk involved, but no less than once per year. 
Written informed consent must be given freely and obtained from every subject  prior to 
clinical trial participation.  The rights, safety , and well -being of the trial subjects  are the 
most important considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
As described in GCP guidelines  and FDA regulations , study personnel involved in 
conducting this trial will be qualified by [CONTACT_8640], training, and experience to perform 
their respective task(s).  A FDA Form [ADDRESS_532527] or fraud

It must be given freely and not under duress. Consent must be documented by [CONTACT_421902]-approved consent form and signed by [CONTACT_120937] ’s lega lly authorized 
representative. The De partment of Health and Human Services suggests that when minors 
are involved, a parent or guardian should sign the consent form. If the minor is an 
adolescent, his signature [CONTACT_120945]. Non-English -speaking subject s must be 
presented with a co nsent form written in a language that they understand.  A copy of the 
signed consent form must be given to the subject  signing it. Another copy must be kept in 
the investigator’s files and made available to and FDA representatives upon request. If, for any reason, subject  risk is increased as the study progresses, a revised, IRB -approved 
consent form must be signed by [CONTACT_423] . Before the study begins, a sample of the 
consent form must be provided to the sponsor  for review. The FDA may reject otherwise 
scientifically valid studies if proper informed consent has not been obtained from all 
subject s. 
Only in the case of a life- threatening incident may an investigational product be used 
without prior signed consent. In such an emergency situation, separate ce rtifications must 
be written both by a physician not participating in the study and by [CONTACT_093]. The certifications, along with the protocol and informed consent, must be sent to the IRB within

time to consider the potential risks and benefits associated with his/her participation in the 
study. The signed and dated consent must be retained with the study records and a copy provided to each participant. 
In situations where the participant is not legally comp etent to provide consent 
(i.e., mentally incapacitated), written consent must be obtained from a parent, legal 
guardian, or legal representative. In these situations, the consent must be signed and dated 
by a witness.  
The informed consent document must have been reviewed and approved b y the sponsor  
and by [CONTACT_093]’s IRB prior to the initiation of the study. The document must contain the eight basic elements of informed consent and may contain the six additional elements described in [ADDRESS_532529] include the following eight elements: 
• A statement that the study involves research, an explanation of the purpose of the research and the expected duration of the subject ’s participation, a description of 
the procedures to be followed, and identification of any procedures that are experimental  
• A description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject  
• A description of any be nefits to the subject  or to others that may reasonably be 
expected from the research  
• A disclosure of appropriate alternative procedures or course of treatment, if any, that might be advantageous to the subject  
• A statement describing the extent, if any, to which confidentiality of records 
identifying the subject  will be maintained and noting the possibility that the FDA 
and representatives may inspect the records  
• An explanation as to whether any compensation or medical treatments are available if injury occu rs for research involving more than minimal risk.  The explanation 
should involve a description of the compensation or treatment available, or a statement describing where further information may be obtained 
• An explanation of whom to contact [CONTACT_421903] ’s rights and whom to contact [CONTACT_44751] a 
research -related injury  
• A statement that participation is voluntary, that refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which the  subject  is otherwise entitled, and that the

Participant  Information  
 
PRINCIPLES CONCERNIN G RESEARCH :  You are being asked to take part in a research 
project.  It is important that you read and understand the principles that  apply to all individuals 
who agree to participate in the research project described below:  
 
1. Taking part in the research is entirely voluntary.  
 
2. We do not know if you will benefit from taking part in the research but the knowledge 
obtained may help others . 
 
3. You may withdraw from the study at any time without anyone objecting and without 
penalty or loss of any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  
 
4. If during your partic ipation in the research project  new information becomes available 
which would a ffect your being in the research project (such as better treatments or the 
side effects of the treatments), your doctor will discuss this new information with you and 
will help you make a decision about your continuing in the research.  
 
The purpose of the  research , how it is to be done , and what your part in the research will be is 
described below.  Also described are the risks, inconveniences, discomforts and other important 
information which you need to make a decision about whether or not you wish to pa rticipate.  
You are urged to discuss any questions you have about this research with the staff members.  
 
PURPOSE OF RESEARCH :  You are being asked to participate in this study because   
you have been diagnosed with urge ncy incontinence or overactive bladde r (OAB).

bacteria in their bladders. These bacteria live in the bladder without causing symptoms. When 
women get symptoms of overactive bladder, they only improve with medications about 50% of 
the time  
 
Mirabegron is an FDA -approved medicatio n for urgency incontinence. Mirabegron is a 
medication that works on receptors in the bladder wall muscle. When these receptors are filled 
and activated, the bladder actively relaxes and is less likely to develop overactive bladder 
contractions that result  in urgency incontinence.  
 
The purpose of this study is to see if women who respond to mirabegron have  different bladder 
bacteria  than women who do not respond . Our hope is that by [CONTACT_897364] b etter understand the cause of urgency incontinence.  
 
This research is sponsored by  [CONTACT_897365]  120 women with OAB  people will participate in this research.   
 
DESCRIPTION AND EXPLANATION OF PROCEDURES:   If you agree to  participate in 
this study , you will be asked to sign this consent document.  
 
If you are currently are taking an anticholinergic medication for overactive bladder symptoms 
you will need to stop taking the medication for 2 weeks before you can start the s tudy.  Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_897360].    
 
Mirabegron is used for the treatment of overactive bladder.   Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_897361] (once you start taking i t) is helpi[INVESTIGATOR_897362].  
 
You will be required to come to the clinic for 4 visits: baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks & [ADDRESS_1257893] ion. The urine 
sample will be collected by [CONTACT_15728] a catheter  (a small rubber  tube) through your urethra and into 
your bladder . This is called a catheterized urine samples. You will also need to complete 5 
questionnaires ( USIQ, PFDI, OABq and UDI -6, PGI -S, and PPBC) .  You will then be given  
mirabegron (Myrbetriq)  to start  treatment. This visit should take about [ADDRESS_1257894] urine at each visit and the urine will be sent to the research laboratory for special 
tests done on the bacteria in the urine.  Since these are research tests and the meaning of the 
results not known, you and your doctor will not be notified of the results of any research tests 
done on your bacteria and your urine.

collected as part of your routine care. Again, no personal identifiers will be used i n collecting 
this information. As above , your study identification number will be used.  
 
A description o f this clinical trial will be available at http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov,  as required 
by U.S. Law. This website will not include information that can identify you. At most, the 
website will include a summary of the results. You can search this website at a ny time.  
 
RISKS/DISCOMFORTS:   It is possible that the study treatment  you receive may not be 
effective in treating your overactive bladder symptoms.    
 
If you are currently taking an anticholinergic medication for overactive bladder symptoms and 
stop taki ng it for the washout period of 2 weeks, there is the chance that your symptoms may 
temporarily  worsen  until you start taking mirabe gron. 
 
You may experience slight discomfort when the catheter (rubber tube) is placed into the opening 
of the bladder (ureth ra). There is a small risk (less than a 1% chance) of a urinary tract infection 
with the placement of the catheter (rubber tube) into the opening of the bladder (urethra).  
 
The medication used for this study is Mybetriq  (mirabegron) . It is approved for the  treatment of 
urge incontinence.  
 
Uncommon side effects of mir abegron (1-5%) reported  include :  
• high blood pressure,  
• difficulty emptying the bla dder,  
• fatigue  
 
Rare events have been reported . These include:   
• swelling,  
• skin rash,  
• allergic reactions (incl uding very severe reactions that require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]),  
• headache,

you are pregnant or breast feeding.  
 
If you are a woman of childbearing potential, a pregnancy test will be done to make certain that 
you are not pregnant before beginning the study.   Women who are able to have c hildren must use 
an effective method of preventing pregnancy while participating in this study.  
 
In addition, as study medications may remain in the body for a period beyond their 
administration, you will be asked to continue to employ an effective metho d of preventing 
pregnancy for [ADDRESS_1257896].  Mueller

you for participating in this research.  You will be responsible for all other costs associated with 
your care.  
 
Neither you nor your insurance provider will be billed for any pro cedures that are performed 
exclusively for this research study. Those procedures that are being performed for research 
purposes only include 4, 8, and 12 week catheterized urine culture, research tests done on the 
urine and expanded quantitative urine cult ure. The study will pay for the 4, 8, and 12 week office 
visits.

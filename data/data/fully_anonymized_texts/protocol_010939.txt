5.   TRIAL OVERVIEW  
 INTRODUCTION AND BACK GROUND  
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common congenital disorder in newborns. The reported 
prevalence of congenital heart disease (CHD) at birth ranges from 6 to 13 per 1000 live births. Survival of 
children with CHD has improved significantly and as a result increasing numbers of patients undergo 
pulmonary valve replacement (PVR).  Surgical management of congenital heart disease (CHD) such as 
Tetralogy of Fallot  (TOF)  and pulmonary stenosis includes relief of right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT ) 
obstruction using techniques that may result in pulmonary valve dysfunction and varying degrees of right ventricular (RV) volume an d pressure overload.   Pulmonary regurgitation, a common sequela e, may 
initially be well tolerated  but eventually lead s to exercise intolerance, progressive RV dilation  and 
dysfunction, ventricular and atrial tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death
 [1]. 
Implantation of a competent pulmonary valve is commonly undertaken to avoid these adverse clinical 
outcomes  and preserve RV function.  The detrimental effects of pulmonary regurgitation are now widely 
accepted, which in turn, has led to earlier PVR in most instances before overt symptoms and cardiovascular decompensation develop. D elayed  pulmonary valve replace ment may contribute to higher 
perioperative mortality due to advanced right ventricular dysfunction. Therefore , timing and indications 
for replacement of an incompetent pulmonary valve are key issues.    
 PULMON ARY HEART DISEASE  
Congenital defects involving the right ventricular outflow tract require iterative surgical interventions 
and/or corrections throughout a patient’s growing years and young adulthood. Some of the defects include pulmonary atresia and pulmonary stenosis. Other defects that are more complex and require complex surgeries include transposition of the great arteries, Tetralogy of Fallot with or without pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus , or double outlet right ventricle.  
The occurrence of pulmonary insufficiency and/or pulmonary stenosis is not uncommon after surgery for 
congenital heart defects
 [1] [2] [3] [4]. Surgical repair of congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot 
and pulmonary stenosis includes relief of right ventricular outflow tract obstruction using techniques that 
may result in significant pulmonary insufficiency [1].  Late morbidity and mortality following repair is 
predominantly secondary to the effects of progressive right heart failure and arrhythmias, to which pulmonary insufficiency (PI) contributes
 [5].  Patients require long -term follow -up, as they are at risk for

  the chronic postoperative complications including arrhythmias including atrial tachycardia and ventricular 
tachycardia (VT), and sudden cardiac death .  Surgical pulmonary valve replacement may be necessary to 
restore pulmonary valve competence, improve  right ventricular function and improve the symptoms .   
 SURGICAL OPTIONS FOR  PULMONARY VALVE REPLACEMENT (PVR)  
There ar e no approved surgical options for pulmonary valve replacement.   As of January 27, 2015, the 
Medtronic Melody ® Transcatheter Pulmonary  Valve has been approved in the US as a catheter -delivered 
stent valve for use in a limited population. The transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) is approved as an adjunct to surgery in the management of pediatric and adult patients with 1) the existence of a full RVOT conduit equal to or greater than 16 mm in diameter when originally implanted and 2) dysfunctional RVOT conduit with a clinical indication for intervention: regurg itation  ≥ moderate and/or  
mean RVOT gradient ≥ 35 mmHg. It is available in two sizes: 16mm and 18mm (Source: FDA  PMA 
Database) .  
Not yet approved s urgical options for pulmonary valve replacement include  bioprosthese s, homografts, 
and mechanical valves.  Controversy regarding the optimal valve in the pulmonary position remains. Bioprosthetic valves perform well hemodynamically but  are prone to structural degeneration.  The 
homograft has a drawback of limited availability . Mechanical valves lead to  a persistent need for 
anticoagulation ; and despi[INVESTIGATOR_50265]
 [6]. Long -term data are available for bioprosthetic valve 
durability in the aortic position  and these data are typi[INVESTIGATOR_50266].   
The ideal pulmonary valve substitute has not yet been clearly defined but compared with mechanical, 
homograft and polytetrafluoroethylene valves, stented bioprosthetic valves in the pulmonary valve position have been shown to be a better  optio n
 [4]. 
 SURGICAL PULMONARY VALVE REPL ACEMENT  (PVR)  
Retrospective studies documented in literature have shown statistically significant improvements in performance following surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) . Significant improvements  are seen  
in right ventricular end -diastolic volume or pre ssure [3]
 [6] [7] [8] [9], right ventricular end -systolic volume 
[8], right ventricular end -diastolic volume index [3], pulmonary regurgitation [4] [6] [10], pulmonary valve 
Doppler velocities [10], tricuspid regurgitation [3] [6], peak pulmonary valve gradient [3] [11], estimated

  right ventricular pressure [3], cardiothoracic ratio on chest x -ray [8, 12] , maximal oxygen uptake [10], QRS 
width [10] [12], left ventricular ejection fraction [9] [12], right ventricular enlargement [9], and right 
ventricular dysfunction [9] [13]. One study found statistically significantly fewer subjects with moderate 
or greater pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary insufficiency that were treated with porcine versus bovine 
valves [4]. How ever, the authors also noted that the follow- up duration was significantly shorter for the 
porcine group versus the bovine group (31.7 versus 55.7 months, P < 0.001). This study also found that subjects who received a PVR at an age greater than 15 years ha d significantly lower percentages of 
moderate or greater pulmonary stenosis and insufficiency.  
Retrospective review of [LOCATION_001] Heart Association functional class of subjects that underwent PVR showed an improvement in function class postoperatively, with five studies r eaching statistical 
significance
 [1] [6] [7] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [5]. 
Freedom from re -intervention/reoperation specific to patients who received the Carpentier- Edwards 
PERIMOUNT valve  were 100% at 2.5 years [5], 50% and 97.7% at 5 years [14] [1], 74.7% at 7 years [8], and 
79% [15] and 94% at 10 years [11]. Risk factors found to be associated with increased risk for 
reintervention/reoperation in a multivariate analysis included younger age at PVR [4] [2] [9], underlying 
diagnosis of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect [2], and use of stentless porcine valve [2].  
Six studies provided results on the freedom from structural valve deterioration/ failure/dysfunction/explant or freedom from moderate- severe or severe pulmonary insufficiency
 [3] [6] 
[2] [11] [1] [9]. The overall 5 year rates ranged from 74% to 92.2% and overall 10 year rates ranged from 
20.2% to 98 %. Rates specific to patients who received the Carpentier- Edwards PERIMOUNT valve were 
89.1% [1] and 92% [6] at 5 years and 79% [15] and 98% [11] at 10 years. Lee et al (2011) also found that 
stented bovine valves had a statistically significantly higher freedom from valve failure and dysfunction rate than stentless porcine valves (p  = 0.015), but valve -specific rates were not provided. Risk factors  
found to be associated with increased risk for structural valve deterioration or failure in a multivariate analysis included younger age at PV R
 [3], higher indexed valve internal diameter [3], and use of a 
homograft in the early phase (within 3 years of surgery) [15]. However, higher indexed valve ID at 
implantation, which is indicative of valve oversizing, was an independent pred ictor of SVD within younger 
patients.

  Babu- Narayan et al conducted a retrospective study i nvestigating the survival rate after repair of Tetralogy 
of Fallot at a single tertiary center. Mortality was the primary outcome measure. In total, 221 surgical 
pulmonary valve replacements were performed in 220 patients (130 male patients; median age, 32 years; range, 16 –64 years). The arti cle concluded that surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) has a low and 
improving mortality, with low 10 year re -intervention rates. The more recently operated on patients 
(2005- 2010) were less symptomatic and had better exercise capacity at the time o f referral for surgical 
PVR compared with those in the earlier era (1993 -2004). The trend of earlier PVR was  associated with 
lower mortalit y
 [16]. 
Jang et al retrospectively reviewed surgical outcomes of 131 PVRs performed at a  single center from 2001 
to 2010.   The mean age was 14.8 yrs + 6.7 years. There were no early or late mortality; the rate of freedom 
from reoperation at 10 years was 66.4 + 4.4%; implanted valve type; young age; and large sized valve 
implantation were risk factors for repeat PVR in the univariate analysis [8].  
Retrospective studies have shown use of stented bioprosthetic valves to treat pulmona ry valvular disease 
has become a standard treatment in clinical practice with optimal rates of survival and freedom from re -
operation.  Tweddell’s retrospective comparative study of 122 subjects (median age 14.6; range 0.6 -49 
yrs) concluded heterograft valves should be the first choice among patients with TOF requiring pulmonary valve replacement as there was no difference in survival or freedom from re -intervention and they have 
the potential advantages of lower cost and availability
 [17] .  Additionally, clinical data supporting the 
safety of the Carpentier- Edwards PERIMOUNT  valve showed a good safety profile [5]. Neukamm’s case 
series assessed the largest published series of [ADDRESS_52589] stenosis and 
insufficiency compared to Bicuspid, Contegra, Homograft, and Monocusp valves [18]. The availability, 
handling characteristics, and exc ellent early outcomes make  the Edwards Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis  
a promising option for surgeons seeking to provide pulmonary valve competence to the previously 
repaired RVOT [5], but further follow up is needed to define long- term function and durability.  
 
A number of studies were identified in the literature that presented data on pulmonary valve replacements.  Although none of the studies were randomized controlled trials (RCT),  these data are of 
acceptable quality and the studies represent an acceptable level of scientific rigor and objectivity.  The

 PREVIOUS DEVICE ITERATION DESCRIPTION  
Edwards Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 11000A  
The Edwards Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 11000A  (also referred to as the Model 11000A ) is a 
bioprosthesis comprised of bovine pericardium. It is based on the same design as the Carpentier- Edwards 
PERIMOUNT Magna Ease Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 3300TFX, which was approved under 
P860057/S042  on 07 May 2009.  
The physical structure and design of the Model 11000A  is identical to the Model  3300TFX, except for tissue 
processing, sterilization  and packaging . The Edwards Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis , Model 11000A , is a 
trileaflet bioprosthesis comprised of treated bovine pericardium that is mounted on a flexible frame. It is 
available in sizes 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, and 29 mm .  The bioprosthesis is stored in non -aqueous packaging, 
and does not require rinsing prior to implantation.  
The wireform is made of a cobalt -chromium alloy and is covered with a woven polyester fabric. A cobalt -
chromium alloy/polyester film laminate band surrounds the base of the wireform frame. A silicone sewing ring that is covered with a porous polytetrafluoroe thylene (PTFE) cloth is attached to the wireform frame. 
The sewing ring has three, equally spaced black silk suture markers at the cusp centers to aid in bioprosthesis orientation and suture placement . 
The Model 11000A  valve is treated with a new tissue pr ocess that builds on Edwards’ existing tissue 
process, ThermaFix (TFX). The new process allows the valve to be stored in non- aqueous packaging and 
the valve is ethylene oxide sterilized.  
The Model 11000A , is being  evaluated as part of the COMMENCE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov #  [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] , 
Protocol Number 2012 -02) to confirm safety and effectiveness  in subjects  who require replacement of 
their native or prosthetic aortic.  Safety and performance for the Edwards Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 11000A and Edwards Pericardial Mitral Bioprosthesis, Model 11000M i s supported by [CONTACT_50299], see section  5.4.2 .

  The INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_50259] , Model 11500P,  incorporates two novel features (available on sizes 
19 – 25 mm  only)  designed for potential future valve -in-valve (ViV) procedures: fluoroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_50270].  
As in the Edwards Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 11000A, a thin cobalt -chromium alloy band and 
poly ester support band surround the base of the valve beneath the wireform frame providing structural 
support for the orifice.  
In the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_50259], model 11500P which is the same valve as model 11500A, the 
ends of the cobalt -chromium alloy  band are secured by a polyester shrink sleeve on the sizes 19 – 25 mm 
(Figure 1a) to allow the internal orifice of the valve to expand. The polyester support band allows 
expansion at each commissure when subjected to radial forces. The expandable cobalt -chromium alloy 
band does not impact suture placement or implant technique. Valves with expandable bands (sizes 19 – 
25 mm) will maintain a stable diameter at implant and under intracardiac conditions, which was 
demonstrated during compression resistance tes ting and accelerated wear testing.  
In the sizes 27 and 29 mm (Figure 1b), the free ends of the cobalt -chromium alloy band are permanently 
secured using a weld joint.  
Similar to other Edwards’ bioprosthetic valves, the cobalt -chromium alloy wireform in the  model 11500P 
can be identified on fluoroscopy. The fluoroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_50271]. A representation of the commissure size markers 
for the sizes 19 – 25 mm is shown in Figure 1c.

EVALUATION OF THE EDWARDS PERICARDIAL AO RTIC AND MITRAL BIOP ROSTHESES 
(MODELS 11000A AND 1 1000M) WITH A NEW TI SSUE TREATMENT PLATF ORM  
The objective of the COMMENCE trial  (protocol [ADDRESS_52598])  is to confirm that tissue 
processing, valve sterilization and packaging used in the  Model 11000A and Model 11000M do not raise 
any new questions of safety and effectiveness in subjects who require replacement of their native or prosthetic aortic or mitral valve. IRB or EC approval of the investigational plan has been obtained at thirty -
five (35) investigational sites  in the US, Canada, and Europe . Enrollment was com pleted in the aortic arm 
in March 2016, and completed in the mitral arm in July 201 6.  Six hundred ninety -four (694) subjects were 
enrolled in the aortic cohort across twenty -seven (27) investigational sites  and eighty three (83) subjects 
were enrolled in the mitral cohort across seventeen (17) investigational sites.  Of the enrolled popu lation, 
six hundred eighty nine (6 89) subjects were treated and successfully implanted with Model 11000A and 
eighty two ( 82) subjects with the Model 11000M.   
For the aortic cohort, follow- up compliance of 100% at discharge, 97.2% at 3 -months, 97.0% at 1- year, 
92.8% at 2- years, and 88.5% at 3 -years has been achieved for all eligible implanted subjects. To date, nine

Safety and performance for the Edwards Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis, Model 11000A and Edwards 
Pericardial Mitral Bioprosthesis , Model 11000M is supported by [CONTACT_50301]. Continued subject 
follow -up will confirm that the new tissue process modifications do not raise new safety and effectiveness 
questions.  
6.   BENEFITS AND RISKS 
 BENEFITS  
The benefits of the trial valve  are the same as other bioprosthetic valves including improved valvular 
function, acute alleviation of symptoms related to valve stenosis or insufficiency, and/or improved 
morbidity and mortality.  
The anticipated additional benefits are to eliminate the need for rinsing the bioprosthesis prior to 
implant ation , less exposure to the risks of glutaraldehyde, and elimination  of hazardous waste  requiring 
special disposal.  Additionally, the V -fit technology (available on sizes 19 – 25 mm) incorpo rates two novel 
features designed for potential future valve -in-valve (ViV) procedures: fluoroscopi[INVESTIGATOR_50272] . 
 RISKS 
As with all prosthetic heart valves, serious complications, including death may be associated with the use 
of tissue valves. Complications due to individual subject reaction to an implanted device, or to physical or chemical changes in the components, particularly those of biological origin, may occur at varying intervals (hours or days) necessitating reoperation and replacement of the prosthetic device. Some or all of the risks listed below could require a reoperation or explant, and/or they may lead to permanent disability or death.

  Risks associated with trial valve  are anticipated to be the same as those listed above for other  pulmonary , 
aortic or mitral bioprosthetic valves and valve replacement surgery .  Based on the results of the aortic 
pre-clinical data , the OUS clinical trial, and the interim results of the COMMENCE trial it is not anticipated 
that any new risks associated with the t rial valve  tissue process , sterilization method, or packaging  will be 
observed.  
Risks associated with stand -alone balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty procedures are pulmonary valve 
incompetence, and with valve -in-valve  procedures, are instability / migration /  embolization for the 
transcatheter device anchored within. Specific risk information related to the band expansion is provided 
in the device Instructions for Use.  
 MINIMIZING SUBJECT R ISK 
Several safeguards are incorporated into the trial to minimize subject risk.  All pre -clinical device testing 
for the implantable valve  is performed in accordance with FDA regula tions, ISO [ADDRESS_52602] adequate personnel to assure compliance to the trial protocol. All clinical investigators performing the implant procedure will receive training specific to the trial valve procedure.  The

 OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the INSPI[INVESTIGATOR_50259], 
Model 11500P, in the pulmonary pos ition in pediatric and adult subjects five years or older requiring 
replacement of their native or prosthetic pulmonary  valve.   
 DESIGN  
Prospective, Non -Randomized, Single Arm, Multicenter study.  Up to one hundred (100) pulmonary valve 
replacement (PVR) subjects at up to ten (10) clinical sites will be enrolled . Clinical data will be collected 
from at least [ADDRESS_52604] completed the 1 year follow- up visit. 
Sites will not be allowed to implant  more than 50% of total sample size.  
 
The trial design includes methods to minimize bias .  Efficacy endpoints will be independently evaluat ed 
by [CONTACT_50303] L ab.  Members will be independent from the Sponsor, the Investigators, or

one hundred (100) pulmonary  valve replacem ent (PVR) subjects at up to ten (10) clinical sites will be 
enrolled .  
 METHODS OF FOLLOW -UP 
All subjects undergo a pre -operative echocardiogram to document the function of their current valve prior 
to surgery. Evaluation of the echocardiogram (echo) is performed by a qualified cardiologist at the site and over -read by [CONTACT_50305]. Other  baseline exams include physical assessment, recording 
of pertinent medical history, electrocardiogram ( ECG), NYHA  or Modified Ross Heart Failure Classification , 
and selected  hematological variables .  
Sponsor allows standard of care tests to be used for screening/baseline data collection  provided they are 
performed within [ADDRESS_52608]’s condition 
that would invalidate the results.  Standard of care tests are performed for all valve patients scheduled for valve replacement surgery whether or not being considered for the trial. If the patient agrees to participate in the trial, they are the n consented and any trial related  tests are performed post consent.  
During the procedure, a transesophageal echo (TEE) will be completed . In addition, follow -up will occur 
at or prior to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50273], ECG, echo and evaluation of selected hematological variables will occur. A post -op echocardiogram must be completed on or prior to post -

power analysis.  
 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 SAFETY ANALYSIS  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary Safety Endpoint  
The primary safety endpoint for the trial is freedom from device or procedure -related  death and/or 
reoperation at [ADDRESS_52619] will experience device or 
procedure -related  death and/or reoperation at 1 year, then the null and  alternative hypotheses for the 
primary safety endpoint are:  
H0: p > 25%  
Ha: p ≤ 25% 
The statistical test of the null hypothesis for the primary safety endpoint is based on a one -sided, upper 
95% confidence limit for device or procedural related death and/ or reoperation at 1 year. If the upper 
95% confidence limit is less than 25%, the acceptance criterion for the primary safety endpoint will have 
been met.  
Based on a simulation, the power of the confidence interval above to reject the null hypothesis is 9 0% for 
the sample size of [ADDRESS_52620] rate of device or procedure -
related  death or reoperation at 1 year of 15%; if a smaller rate is assumed, the power of the statistical test 
would be higher.  
Reoperation is defined as any operation that repairs, alters or replaces the study valve, which occurs after 
the completion of the procedure and the transfer out of the procedure room.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Secondary Safety Endpoints  
The secondary safety endpoints listed in 7. 3 will be analyzed using the investigational  valve population. 
Early adverse events within 30 days of procedure will be reported as the number of events divided by [CONTACT_50311]:  2015-03

  number of enrolled subjects.  Percentages for the early events will also be calculated for all other 
complications observed in the t rial, including reoperation and/or death.  
Actuarial rates based on the method of Kaplan - Meier will be calculated for the primary safety endpoint, 
and for each of the safety events in Section 7. 3 at each of the follow -up time points; the number of 
subject s at risk of the event will be reported at each of these intervals.  
A sub -analysis for patients receiving valve -in-valve procedures will be made via descriptive method.  
 EFFECTIVENESS ANALYS IS 
The following effectiveness endpoints will be analyzed using the  investigational valve population.  
The following parameters will be summarized at baseline and at each follow -up visit for all subjects in 
the investigational valve population : 
• Peak pressure gradient  
• Mean pressure gradient  
• TR gradient  
• Valvular regurgitation  
 • Peak Velocity  
• Doppler Velocity Index ( DVI) 
• Transvalvular VTI  
 
Valvular regurgitation will be summarized by [CONTACT_50312].  All other parameters will be summarized by N, mean, and standard deviation, and a 95% 
confidence interval. These summaries will be stratified by [CONTACT_50313].  
 NYHA CLASS  
A comparison of preoperative and postoperative NYHA functional class (presented as the percentage of subjects in each class at baseline, at each  follow -up time -point, and as the percentage of subjects at each 
follow -up time -point who improved, worsened, or did not change in class) will be presented for all 
subjects greater than 12 years old.  This comparison will be based on the investigational valve population.  
Additionally, a cross -tabulation of baseline vs. POD 390 NYHA will be presented for all subjects in the 
investigational valve population with both baseline and POD 390 NYHA data. Additionally, the summaries 
described above will be presents  using the Modified Ross Heart Failure Classification for subjects aged 12 
and under.   
 ADDITIONAL MEASURES 
 BLOOD DATA  
For all measured blood parameters, individual results will be compared to documented normal ranges.  The Investigator will determine for each parameter that is out -of-range whether the value is not clinically 
significant and summary statistics will be provided.

  Summary statistics (N, mean, and standard deviation) will be calculated preoperatively and post -
operatively.  In addition, the p ercentage of patient within the normal range preoperatively and post -
operatively will be calculated.  The percentage of patients within the normal range post -operatively will 
be reported separately for patients within and without the normal range preoperatively and for all 
patients combined.  
 POOLABILITY  
Subject baseline risk will be statistically compared among centers for the enrolled population.  Chi- square 
tests will be used to compare categorical risk factors while analysis of variance will be used to c ompare 
continuous risk factors.  Comparisons will be based on the following demographic and pre -operative 
variables: age, sex, and pre -operative NYHA or Modified Ross Heart Failure Classification.   
Early and late adverse event rates for the investigational valve  population will be compared between the 
sites for each of the adverse events listed in the Safety Endpoints Section 7.3.1 .  Early event rates will be 
compared with a logistic regression model; late event rates will be compared with an exponential hazards 
regression model.   
 ANALYSIS OF COVARIAT ES 
A hazard regression analysis will be performed to test for the effect of gender,  age at implant, pre -
operative NYHA functional classification or Modified Ross Heart Failure Classification, previous valve 
surgery, right ventricular function, BMI, and implant size on survival. This analysis will be performed by 
[CONTACT_2329] a Cox proportional hazards model and will be based on the enrolled population. Additionally, the rate for each of the adverse events listed in the Safety Endpoints Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_52623] of gender on each of the following effectiveness endpoints at POD 390 (1 year) will be 
investigated with a linear regression model: peak gradient, mean grad ient,  and TR gradient .  These linear 
regression models will be adjusted by [CONTACT_47735] (to adjust for the effect of body size), and by [CONTACT_50313].   The 
effect of gender on all valvular regurgitation at POD 390 (1 year) will be investigated via a proportional 
odds model; this model also will be adjusted by [CONTACT_47735], and by [CONTACT_50313].  
 MISSING DATA  
All statistical tests on the effectiveness endpoints will be performed using only those subjects with available data required for endpoint analysis.  No missing value imputation will be performed.

11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
 REPORTING  
Adverse event (AE) information is reported throughout the clinical investigation.  AEs are reported from 
the time of the valve implant procedure (index procedure)  until subject participation has ended (study 
exit).  At each evaluation, the Investigator will determine whether any adverse events (AEs) have occurred. 
For the purpose of this protocol, an adverse event is any undesirable medical occurrence in a subject. This definition does not depend on a causal relationship with the device or the protocol requ irements.  Adverse 
events are followed until they are adequately resolved.  
 
Adverse events may be volunteered by [CONTACT_1766], elicited from questioning or collected via observation. The Investigator or designee will determine whether or not the event is related to the device and/or 
procedure, and whether or not the event meets serious ness  criteria. If it is determined that an AE has 
occurred, the Investigator should obtain all the information required to  complete the AE Case Report 
Form.   In addition, sub jects will be instructed to contact [CONTACT_737], and/or study coordinator if any

 DEATHS 
The site will send the Sponsor copi[INVESTIGATOR_50279],  if available, and/or a death summary.  The 
Investigator /designee will provide information about  the cause of death and will determine relationship 
to the clinical investigational device.  Deaths and UADEs will be reported to the DMC within five (5) 
business days after Edwards Lifesciences or its des ignee first receives notice of the event. The Clinical 
Events Committee (CEC) will also adjudicate each death for device relatedness  and procedure relatedness.  
If explant of a device occurs during autopsy, return the device to the Sponsor for  analysis. Return kits for 
explanted devices will be provided upon request by [CONTACT_50325].  
 EXPLANT REPORTING 
In the event a trial valve is explanted in the intra- operative or early post -operative period  (i.e., while the 
subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_50280]), a copy of the procedure report must be provided to 
the Sponsor. Information on the cause of the  explant and its relationship to the valve will be determined 
by [CONTACT_737] /designee. Explanted trial valves during this p eriod must be returned to the Sponsor 
for analysis. Return kits for explanted devices will be provided upon request by [CONTACT_50326].  
In the event a trial valve is explanted in the late post- operative period, the Investigator /designee  will 
prov ide information on the explant and determine the relationship to the trial valve.  Every effort should 
be made to supply copi[INVESTIGATOR_50281], to the  Sponsor. As soon as possible, explanted trial

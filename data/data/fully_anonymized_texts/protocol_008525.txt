effectiveness data.  
Planned 
Number of 
Subjects  1. Phase A  randomized controlled trial ( RCT ): Approximately  201 
subjects are expected to be enrolled to support a 2:1 randomization. 
2. Phase B  non- randomized: A pproximately 100 additional subjects are 
expected to be enrolled in phase B , which is structured as a non -
randomized singl e arm study, in which all subjects will be treated 
with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent S ystem.  
Planned 
Number of Investigational Centers / 
Countries  The trial will be conducted in the [LOCATION_002], Europe, Japan  and 
potentially Singapore, Taiwan and/or Hong K ong, at up to [ADDRESS_505513]  
Primary 
Effectiveness Endpoint  Primary Effectiveness Endpoint ( Phase A  RCT)  
The primary effectiveness endpoint assesses primary patency at [ADDRESS_505514] -procedure . This effectiveness endpoint is designed to 
demonstrate that the 12- month primary patency for the DES BTK  
treatment group is superior to the PTA treatment group at an overall one-sided significance level of 2.5%.   
Primary vessel patency is defined as a b inary endpoint to be determined 
via duplex ultrasound (DUS) measuring flow or no flow at t he 12- month 
follow -up visit in the absence of clinically -driven target lesion 
revascularization (TLR) or by[CONTACT_142177]. All DUS readings 
will be assesse d by [CONTACT_44238]. 
Primary Safety 
Endpoint(s)  Primary Safety Endpoint ( Phase A  RCT)  
The primary safety endpoint assesses major adverse events (MAE) at  [ADDRESS_505515] -procedure. This safety endpoint is designed to demonstrate 
that the 12- month MAE -free rate for the DES BTK treatment group is 
non-inferior to the PTA  treatment group at an overall one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.  
A major adverse event is defined as:  
• Above ankle amputation of the index limb 
• Major re -intervention (new by[CONTACT_9292],  jump/interposition 
graft , or thrombectomy/thrombolysis)

Statistical Methods in Phase  A RCT  
Primary 
Effectiveness 
Statistical Hypothesis and The primary effectiveness hypothesis to be teste d is that the 12-month 
primary patency in subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular St ent

10%.[ADDRESS_505541]  The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded to be superior 
to PTA for device effectiveness if the one -sided lower bound of 97.5 % 
confidence interval on the difference between treatment groups ( DES

Sample Size 
Parameters  
 
Phase A  RCT  The overall sample size is driven by [CONTACT_322643]. 
Approximately [ADDRESS_505542] is based on the following assumptions. 
• Power ≥ 84%  
• One-sided overa ll significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• Expected PTA 12- month primary patency = 40%  
• DES BTK  to demonstrate 25% treatment effect  
• Allocation ( DES BTK  vs PTA) = 2:1 
• A minimum of 1 50 evaluable subjects are required at 12 months 
(ideally  100 in DES BTK  arm and 50 in PTA  arm) 
• Attrition rate in 12 months ≤25%

  • Approximately  201 subjects are planned to be randomized in 2:[ADDRESS_505543] 
 The intention -to-treat (ITT) population will be the primary a nalysis set 
for assessing the pr imary hypotheses. Both per -protocol (PP) and a s-
treated (AT) populations will be the secondary analyses sets for 
reference.  
• ITT: all randomized subjects will be included in the ITT analysis 
set, regardless of whether the sub jects receive the assigned 
treatment. The DES BTK  and PTA arms wil l be compared as 
randomized .  
• PP: only randomized subjects who receive the assigned index 
treatment will be included in the PP analysis set. The DES BTK  
and PTA arms will be compared as rand omized and correctly 
received in dex treatment.  
• AT: all subjects wh o receive either the DES BTK  stent or PTA at 
the index procedure will be included in the A T analysis set. DES 
BTK  and PTA arms will be compared as treated, excluding 
subjects who do not rece ive the DES BTK stent or PTA. 
Statistical Methods in Phase B  Non-randomized  
Testing 
Hypotheses Strategy  
Phase B Non-
randomized  The primary safety hypothesis will be tested at [ADDRESS_505544] Method  
 
Phase B Non-
randomized  The primary s afety hypothesis to be tested is that the 12-month MAE -
free rate in subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent System 
exceeds a performance goal (PG) of 71%1 at one -sided significance lev el 
of 2.5%.  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the  safety  hypothesis of meeting the 
PG in the 12- month MAE -free rate .  
H0: Pt ≤  PG (not met)  
H1: Pt > PG (met)  
where Pt is the 12 -month MAE -free rate for th e subjects treated with the 
DES BT K Vascular Stent System and the PG is the performance goal . 
Success Criteria  
Phase B Non-
randomized  The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System  will be concluded as meeting the 
PG for device safety if the one- sided lower bound of 97.5% confidence 
interval on the observed 12- month MAE -free rate is greater than 0.71.

Phase B Non-
randomized  • One-sided significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• Safety PG = 71%2 in the 12- month MAE -free rate  
• Expected 12- month MAE -free rate = 80%  
• A minimum of 186 ( DES BTK ) evaluable subjects are required 
at 12 months  
• Attrition rate at 12 months ≤  20%  
• Up to  234 ( DES BTK ) subjects are planned to be enrolled, 
including [ADDRESS_505545] the pre- specified safety PG.  
Medications  Anti-coagulation and antiplatelet therapy is to be administered prior to 
and during the index procedure according to the investigator’s standard 
procedures . 
Dual antiplate let therapy is required post -procedure through the 6- month 
visit and is strongly recommended to continue t hrough the 12- month 
visit for subjects who receive the DES BTK  stent .* 
Subjects who are randomized to PTA in phase A RCT will receive antiplatelet the rapy according to the investigator’s standard of care.  
*A subject may be exempt from dual antiplatelet requirement when anticoagulation therapy is required for comorbidity treatment and when, in the judgement of the investigator, the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy would pose an unacceptable hemorrhage risk. 
DMC and CEC  The data monitoring committee (DMC) will review  overall trial conduct 
and safety . The DMC will review  approximately 46 randomized 
subjects ’ aggregate safety  data for the approval to use overlappi[INVESTIGATOR_400903]. The DMC charter will outline this process.  
The clinical events committee (CEC) will adjudicate the following 
endpoints and major adverse events reported by [CONTACT_400929] : 
• All deaths  
• Clinically -driven TLR

  4. Introduction  and Background  
Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is a progression of peripheral artery disease (PAD), 
characterized by [CONTACT_400931] (especially in the lower limbs) which reduces 
blood flow to the extremities and places patient tissue viability at risk . [ADDRESS_505553], risk of open ulceration, gangrene and, if not treated properly, a mputation of 
limb(s). These outcomes reduce patient mobility and quality of life . 5 Patients with  CLI also  
experience increased risk of mortality, increasing further for those  undergoi ng limb 
amputations. Diabetics  with CLI are at particularly high risk for advanced complications; 
studies indicate that within one year of CLI diagnosis, 40% to 50% of diabetics will 
experience an amputation.  [ADDRESS_505554] of care for CLI pa tients has historically utilized one of two methods for 
revascularization of dis eased infrapopliteal vessels , either by [CONTACT_400932] (PTA). While surgical by[CONTACT_400933] a potential a venue 
for revasculari zation of BTK arteries and was considered the frontline therapy for CLI 
patients, the surgery is invasive and technicall y challenging, espe cially considering the 
fragile health state of the affected population. Due to these challenges,  this procedure 
conti nues to experience significant variability in outcomes, patient healing, and costs. 7   
There are important limitations and risks associated  with by[CONTACT_4897], includi ng up to 
20% of patients experiencing significant postoperative morbidity and  10 to 20% of patients 
experiencing frequen t wound complicatio ns. Additionally, new stenosis within the vein graft 
conduit occurs in 30% to 40% of patients wi thin the first two ye ars after surgery . 
In recent years, the arrival of endovascular treatment of CLI has been driven by [CONTACT_400934] -based technologies due to the benefits of a less invasive approach in 
treating this fragile populat ion.
[ADDRESS_505555] of r estenosis 
rates associated  with PTA therapy . Infrapopliteal atherosclerotic lesion s characteri zed by 
[CONTACT_400935] s in smaller diameter vasculature do not respond well to PTA.  11 
The benefits of using short coronary drug- eluting stents has been well -studied in 
infrapopliteal le sions; randomized clinical trials have shown a benefit in terms of patency and 
re-intervention rates as compared to PTA  3,4,[ADDRESS_505556] bee n appr oved in the United 
States for infrapopliteal use. T here are major limitations of using coronary drug- eluting stents 
below the knee, i ncluding the limited available lengths relative to the artery lengths to be 
treated, relative in flexibility, and risk of fracture given the unique conditions of infrapopliteal

4.2. Trial Rationale  
Critical limb ischemia is a debilitating disease, associated with poor clinical outcomes, a high 
rate of am putations, and overall decreased quality of life. Based on the significant clinical 
complications associated with by[CONTACT_4897], the prese nce of chronic tot al occlusions, the  
restenotic characteristics with PTA therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the limitations of using coronary stents in BTK indications, the need for an alternative therapy exists . 
 The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System aims to address these treatm ent gaps and clinical 
outcomes not adequately addressed by [CONTACT_400936]/or PTA. The DES B TK Vascular 
Stent Sys tem was  designed for the unique considerations of infrapopliteal disease, including 
long, tortuous lesions and the need for a mechanism of providing an anti -proliferative ag ent 
to calcified vessels. The DES  BTK Vascular Stent System in corporates existing s uccessful 
peripheral drug- eluting stent technology to treat a similar disease state below the knee.  
5. Device Description  
The DES BTK  Vascular  Stent System or DES BTK (SAVAL) Drug -Eluting Vascular Stent 
System  is a medical device containi ng an ancillary medic inal substance, that provides a 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
    Confidential SAVAL Pi[INVESTIGATOR_400898] 92193192 /Version F  
Page 28 of 98  
  mechanical scaffold for vascular lumen support (the stent component) and a pharmacological 
agent (paclitaxel) targeted towards reducing the injury response that leads to restenosis after 
stent implantation.  All references m ade herein to the DES BTK device and DES BTK 
Vascular Stent System are synonymous with the SAVAL device and SAVAL Drug- Eluting 
Vascular Stent System, re spectively.  
The DES BTK Vascular Stent System  is comprised of 3 main parts:  
• Stent component  
• Stent coati ng (primer layer and active layer with drug substance)  
• Delivery system  
5.1. The DES BTK Vascular Stent System  
The DES BTK  stent ( Figure 5.1- 1) is a laser cut self -expanding stent composed of a nick el 
titanium alloy (nitinol). Shape memory alloys exhibit special properties including super 
elasticity and shape memory. Nitinol can exist in two phases: a mart ensite phase and an 
austenite phase. Changing from the martensite phase to the austenite phase, or the reverse, is 
referred to as a phase transformation. During a phase transform ation, the atoms rearrange and 
allow the material to exhibit a different behav ior. Phase transformations can occur as a result 
of temperature or stress changes in the material.  
During manufactur e, the DES BTK  stent undergoes heat treatments that impart “memory” on 
the nitinol material, allowing it to expand to a specified diameter when exposed to certain 
conditions of stress or temperature. Then the stent is loaded into the delivery system, which constrains the stent until it is deployed at the target lesion. As the stent is exposed to body temperature, it expands to appose the vess el wall. The blood vessel restricts full expansion of 
the stent diameter; therefore, recommended  stent to vessel sizi ng is up to one to one fourth 
millimeter less than the stent nominal diameter . 
The DES BTK  Drug -Eluting Vascular Stent System is intended to improve luminal diameter 
in the treatment of symptomatic de novo or restenotic lesions in the native infrapopliteal  
arteries with reference vessel diameters (RVD) ranging from 2.5 – 3.75mm.

5.2. DES BTK Delivery System  
The stent is constrained within a tapered delivery syst em which is 6F (2.1 mm maximum 
OD) at the proximal end and has a 5F (1.7 mm) crossing profile. The delivery system  is a 
triaxial design with a n outer shaft to stabilize the stent delive ry system, a middle shaft to 
protect and constrain the stent, and an inner shaft to provide a guidewire lumen. The delivery 
system is intended for use with 0.014 in (0.36 mm) guidewires. A radiopaque marker at the  
distal end of the delivery system aids in visibility during deployment. The DES BTK delivery system is offered in  a 130 cm working length ( Figure 5.2- 1). Additional delivery systems 
may be added upon regulatory approval to include them  in the trial.

b]oxet -9-yl ester, [2aR - [2aα,4ß,4aß,6ß,9α (αR*,ßS*),11α,12α,12aα,12bα]]. Paclitaxel is a 
diterpenoid with a characteristic taxane skeleton of 20 carbon atoms, a molecular weight of 
853.91 g/mol and a molecular formula of  C47H51NO14. It is highly lip ophilic, insoluble in 
water, but freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate and dimethyl 
sulfoxide. 14,15  The chemical structure of paclitaxel is provided in Figure 5.3- 4.

Paclitaxel is an antiproliferative drug that induces irreversible polymerization of cell 
microtubules, thus inhibiting mitosis. It is widely used in antineoplastic chemotherapy of cancers; however, doses required in chemotherapeutic treatment are significantly higher per treatment cycle in cancer patients than in peripheral artery disease patients.  
15  Pacli taxel has 
been shown to inhibit proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells, effectively 
suppressing neointimal hyperplasia after vessel injury. 15, 16, 17 The drug- to-polymer 
formulation ratio in DES BTK  stents is 1:9 with a resulting paclitaxel loading density (total 
weight of drug/unit of stent surface area) of 0.236 µg/mm2.

Description for product information. Comm ercially available PTA balloons are the control 
device for this trial.  
Drug coated balloons are not per mitted for treatment of the target lesion(s).  
7.6. Target and Non -Target Lesions  
Target Lesion(s)  
The target lesion (s) is defined as a stenotic, restenotic or occlusive seg ment located in the 
tibioperoneal trunk, anterior tibial, posterior tibial and/or peronea l artery(ies) with the 
following characteristics:  
• Target lesion (s) must be at least 4cm above the ankle joint  
• A single target lesion per vessel, in up to 2 vessels, in a single limb  
• Degree of stenosis ≥ 70% by [CONTACT_142182]  
• RVD is between 2.5 – 3.25mm for phase A RCT  
• RVD is between 2.5 – 3.75mm for phase B non- randomized  (Note : RVD is 
dependent on st ent size being used. Refer to DFU for specific requirements)

  • Total target lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 70mm 
for phase A  RCT prior to DMC  approval for stent overlap  
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with one D ES BTK stent, if 
randomized to stent)  
• Total target lesion length (or series  of lesion  segment s) to be treated  is ≤ 140mm 
for phase A  RCT after DMC  approval for stent overlap  
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with up to two DES BTK stents, 
if randomized to stent)  
• Total target lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 140mm 
for phase B  non- randomized  
(Note: Lesion  segment(s) must be fully covered with up to two DES BTK stents)  
 Successful guidewire crossing of all target les ion(s) is required pr ior to 
randomization/enrollment.  
Use of alternate the rapy is not permitted  for the treatment of the target lesion(s) in the trial. 
(eg, atherectomy, cutting balloon, re -entry devices, laser radiation therapy) . 
Drug -coated balloons are not permitted for the treatment of the target lesion(s) in the trial.  
Non- Target Lesion(s)  
Multiple interventions in the target limb are permi tted during the index procedure for the 
treatment of above the knee inflow lesions  (lesions located i n the iliac artery, superficial 
femoral artery and/or popliteal artery) . Inflow lesions  may be treated according to the 
investigator’s standard procedures using commercially -available devices. If atherectomy is 
performed , the use of an embolic protection device is strongly recommended.  
The inflow interventions must be deemed successful (eg, absence of distal embolization, 
optimal restoration of inflow, etc .) prior to the randomization and/or treatment of the target 
lesion.  
Treatment of outflow lesion(s) ( lesions located in the segment of the target vessel distal to 
the target lesion) is not  permitted . 
7.7. Justification for the Trial Design  
The SAVAL  phase A  RCT  will compare the safety and effectiveness of the DES BTK  
Vascular Stent System vs PTA for the treatm ent of atherosclerotic lesion(s) i n the 
infrapopliteal arteries. Current r evascularizat ion options for infrapopliteal atherosclerotic 
disease include both endovascular and surgical approaches. The foundation of endovascular revascularization is PTA, and while advancements have been made in endovascular 
approaches for below the knee disease, patency rates remain suboptimal . 
[ADDRESS_505579] been used for coronary artery 
revascularizatio n since their introduction in 2003, and this  technology, used for the treatment 
in coronary vessels of similar diameters as those found in the infrapopliteal anatomy , 
supports the use of drug- eluting stents  below the knee.

Subjects who do not satisfy the pre -procedure eligibility criteria will receive care according 
to the investigational center’s standard procedures  and no further trial -related procedures will 
be com pleted. They will be considered a screen failure and followed according to the center’s 
standard procedures.  
 
Subjects who do not satisfy the intra -procedure eligibility criteria will not be 
randomized/en rolled into the trial, and will receive care accordi ng to the center’s standard 
procedures  and considered a sc reen failure.  
 
Subjects, who are enrolled/randomized into the DES BTK arm but do not have the DES BTK stent successfully implanted , will be follow ed for [ADDRESS_505586] 
withdraws from the clinical investigation, the reason(s) will be reported. If such withdrawal 
is due to problems related to invest igational device safety or performance, the investigator 
will ask for the subject’s permission to follow his/her status/condition outside of the clinical 
trial.   Subjects may withdraw from the trial at a ny time by [CONTACT_400940]. The 
investigator may also terminate a subject’s participation in the trial ( ie, if the subject 
routinely fails to complete required trial procedures or if the investigator believes it is in the subject’s best in terest).  
 Examples of reasons for trial withdrawal i nclude, but are not limited to:  
• Failure to comply with the trial- required visit schedule

  • Subject is lost to follow -up 
• Subject voluntarily withdraws from the trial  
• Adverse event such that continued trial participation would not be in the best interest 
of the subject  
• Withdrawal of the subject by [CONTACT_093]  
• Subject death  
• Trial closure  
 
It is recommended that the reason for subject withdrawal is also documented in the subject’s 
medical record. If applica ble, t he investigator will complete an adverse event  and/or device 
deficiency assessment prior to the subje ct’s withdrawal from the trial. All applicable 
electronic case report forms (eCRFs) are to be completed for all subjects who are enrolled in 
the tria l and are then withdrawn from the trial for any reas on. 
Withdrawn subjects will not undergo any further tri al follow -up, nor will they be replaced 
because the justified sample size considers an estimated allowance for attrition. Data already 
collected will be retained and reported, however, no new data will  be collected after the 
withdrawal.   
Subjects voluntari ly withdrawing from the trial will be asked to participate in a limited 
capacity allowing their medical status to be followed by [CONTACT_24646], m edical chart 
review, or by [CONTACT_400941]. If a subject  decides  not to continue participation in a 
limited capacity, the investigator  will not access their  medical record or other confidential 
records for new purposes related to the study; howeve r, study data collected prior to their  
withdrawal ma y be reviewed and publicly available records may be con sulted prior to or after 
their withdrawal.  Note: this applies to all withdrawn subjects (e.g. withdrawn by 
[CONTACT_1697] ). 
Withdrawn subjects will be followed according to the investigational center’s s tandard 
procedures. Serious adverse device -effects that are still ongoing at the end of the subject’s 
participation in the trial will be followed up for resolution status  and this information will be  
provided to [LOCATION_011] Scientific  for the purpose of regulat ory agency reporting for the trial . 
9.3. Lost to Follow -Up 
Additional actions must be taken when a participant fails to attend a required study visit:  
The investigational  center  personnel will attempt to conta ct the study subject and reschedule 
the missed v isit (within the visit window if  possible) and counsel the subject on the 
importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule. 
Prior to withdrawing a subject as lost to follow -up, the investigational center ’s personnel 
must make at minimum 3 documented attempts (1 in writing and sent via a traceable method) 
to bring the subject in for a final trial visit. Other contacts ( ie, telephone calls, emails) must 
be documented in the subject’s records at the investigational center. If all attempts to contact [CONTACT_400942], the investi gational center will withdraw the subject and follow the 
local procedures for notification.

10.3. Trial  Candidate Screening  
A screening log will be maintained by [CONTACT_400943] , 
including the reason for screen failure . 
10.3.1. Strategies for Recruitment a nd Retention 
Subjects may be recruited through the investigator’s practice, referring phy sicians and/or the 
use of recruitment tools. Potential subjects may be identified through an investigational center’s database query (chart reviews) or as new or exist ing patients attend clinic visits. Any 
information disseminated to potential subjects ( eg, advertisements, pamphlets, posters) must 
be approved by [CONTACT_118250]’s IRB/ EC prior to use.  
It is important that the investigational center personnel review the trial requirements  with the 
subjects to maximize compliance with the follow -up schedule and required medication 
regimen. A stipend may be provided to subjects to cover lodging or travel expenses incurred as a result of participation in the SAVAL  trial, in accordance with country laws  and 
regulations , and per the trial investigationa l center ’s regulations.

Confidential     SAVAL Pi[INVESTIGATOR_400898] 92193192 /Version F  
Page [ADDRESS_505594] (or legal guardian, if applicable) must sign and date the ICF prior to any trial -
required testing or procedures. For individuals less than [ADDRESS_505595]’s legal representative, as well as the subject, must provide written 
informed consent.  
Prior to signing the ICF , the investigator, or qualified designee, will explain to each potential 
subject the purpose and nature of the trial, procedures, expected trial duration, available alternative therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], and the benefits and risks involved with trial participation .  
Refer to Section 9 .1 Point of Enrollment and Section 20 Informed Consent.  
10.5. Medications  
Anticoagulant and antiplatelet medication use will be collected for the trial  and report ed on 
the electronic case report forms from the time of the pre- procedure visit through the 36-  
month follow up. Medication data collection at each visit w ill include: a complete listing of 
the anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications the subject is taking, interruptions and 
cessation.  
Anticoagulant and Antiplatelet Medication for the Trial  
• Anti-coagulation and antiplatelet therapy is to be administered pr ior to and during the 
index procedure according to the investigator’s standard procedures . 
• Dual antip latelet therapy is required post -procedure through the 6- month visit and is 
strongly recommended to continue through the 12- month visit for the trial subje cts who 
receive the DES BTK  stent. * 
• Subjects who are randomized to PTA in phase A RCT will receive antiplatelet therapy 
according to the investigator’s standard of care .  
*A subject may be exempt from dual antiplatelet requirement when anticoagulation ther apy 
is required for comorbidity treatment and when, in the judgement of the investigator, the addition of dual antiplatelet therapy would pose an unacceptable hemorrhage risk.  
10.6. Quality of Life  
The QOL instruments used for the trial will be the EQ -5D questi onnaire for general health 
and the VascuQol questionnaire for disease specific  data.  
The E Q-5D is a descriptive system of health -related quality of life states consisting of five 
dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression) , each 
of which can take one of five responses. The responses re cord five levels of severity (no

  problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a 
particular EQ -5D dimension. 
The VascuQol was developed to evalu ate disease- specific QOL measure for patients with 
chronic lower limb isch emia. The 25 -item questionnaire is subdivided into 5 domains: pain, 
symptoms, activities, social and emotional.  
10.7. Wound  Care and Data Collection  
For Rutherford [ADDRESS_505596] be  located only in the digit(s) and/or the forefoot, and these lesions must 
be able to be fully resected (if needed) by [CONTACT_400944](s) or complete trans metatarsal  ampu tation. Study subject’s wounds must not require mid foot or hind foot 
ampu tation. If the investigator plans to undertake digit amputation(s) or  transmetatarsal 
amputation , this plan should be indicated at the time of study enrollment. 
It is recommended investigators follow the Wound H ealing S ociety 2014 update on 
guidelines for arterial ulcers.  
18 
Target limb w ound characteristics data will be collected and documented on the eCRFs. ( ie, 
wound size, depth, presence of infection, and healing status) . Wound images will be 
collected for the trial. Instructions for collection and submission of images will be provided in the manual of operations. 
A review of the wound assessment data will be completed by [CONTACT_400945].  
10.8. Pre-procedure  
The subject (and/or the legal guardian as applicable) must sign and date the ICF prior to the 
completion of any trial -related procedures. Subjects will be assessed to confirm trial 
eligib ility requirements. T he data collection elements for pre -procedure  should be collected ≤ 
[ADDRESS_505597] will be considered a 
screen failure and  receive care according to the center’s standard procedures.  
When a subject fails the pre- procedure eligibility criteria, and it is in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_400905] a suitable candidate for rescreening, the investigator will 
contact [CONTACT_400946] , or designee  to request permission  to rescreen the 
subject . 
Data Collection Requirements Pre -procedure  (≤ 30 days prior to procedure ): 
• Informed consent  (prior to any study- specific tests or procedures)  
• Pre-procedure inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Demographics  
• Physical assessment  
• Body mass index

  • Medical and surgical history 
• Glomerular filtration rate  
• Platelet count  
• Pregnancy test ≤ 7 da ys prior to procedure (if subject is of child- bearing potential)  
• EQ-5D Questionnaire  
• VascuQol  Questionnaire  
• Medications  
• Rutherford classification  
• Ankle -brachial index and toe brachial index*  
        *  When subject condition perm its (ie, no toe amputation, calcified/incompressible vessels)  
10.9. Index Procedure  
Diagnostic angiography of the lower extremities will be performed using the investigational 
center’s standard procedures. The investigator will confirm the subject satisfies all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria prior to randomization/enrollment into the trial.  
Multiple interventions in the target limb are permitted during the index procedure for the treatment of above the knee inflow lesions  (lesions located in the iliac artery, superficial 
femoral artery and/or popliteal artery) . Inflow lesions may be treated according to the 
investigator’s standard procedures using commercially- available devices. If atherectomy is 
performed , the use of an embolic protection device is  strongly re commended.  
The inflow interventions must be deemed successful (eg, absence of distal embolization, optimal restoration of inflow , etc) prior to the randomization and/or treatment of the target 
lesion (s). 
Successful guidewire crossing of all ta rget lesion(s) is required prior to 
randomization/enrollment into the trial.  
Treatment of outflow lesions(s) (lesions located in the segment of the target vessel distal to the target lesion)  is not permitted.  
Drug -coated balloons are not permitted for the treatment of the target lesion(s) in the trial.  
The use of an adjunctive therapy is not permitted for the target  lesion(s) (ie , atherectomy, 
cutting balloon, re -entry devices, laser, radiation therapy).  
The DES BTK V ascular Stent System will be used in co mpliance with the directions for use.  
10.9.1. Target lesion requirements:  
Stenotic, restenotic, or occlusive target lesions(s) located in the tibi operoneal trunk, anterior 
tibial, posterior tribal and/or peroneal artery(ies).  
• Target lesion (s) must be below the kne e and at least 4cm above the ankle joint  
• A single target lesion per vessel, in up to 2 vessels, in a  single limb  
• Degree of stenosis ≥ 70% by [CONTACT_142182]  
• RVD is between 2.5 – 3.25mm for phase A RCT  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pi[INVESTIGATOR_400898] 92193192 /Version F  
Page 51 of 98  
 
  • RVD is between 2.5 – 3.75mm for phase B non- randomized  (Note : RVD is 
dependent on stent size being used. Refer to DFU for specific requirements)  
• Total ta rget lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 70mm for 
phase A  RCT prior to DMC  approval for stent overlap  
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with one DES BTK stent, if 
randomized to stent)  
• Total target lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 140mm for 
phase A  RCT after DMC  approval for stent overla p 
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with up to two DES BTK stents, if randomized to stent)  
• Total target lesion length (or series of lesion  segment s) to be treated is ≤ 140mm for 
phase B  non- randomized  
(Note: Lesion segment(s) must be fully covered with up to two DES BTK stents)  
 
A ruler or radiopaque marking tape must be used as the calibration source to determine the lesion length and location. When possible the zero mark  will be placed at the level of an 
anatomical landmark ( ie, tibial platea u, inferior edge of the patella, bifurcation). 
10.9.2. Randomization/Enrollment  
In phase A RCT the randomization assignment will be obtained only after all of the following are confirmed:  
• All p re- and intra -procedure inclusion criteria are met  
• No exclusion criteri a are met  
• Successful guidewire crossing of the target lesion(s)  is required  prior to 
randomization/enrollment 
 
The investigator (or delegate) will access  the R ave electronic data capture system , and a 
randomization custom function will be used to assign subjects to the test or control treatment group. Treatment of the target lesion(s) will be in compliance with the randomization assignment.  
For phase B non- randomized, the DES BTK stent may be implanted after the following are 
confirmed:  
• All pre - and intra -procedure inclusion criteria are met  
• No exclusion criteria are met  
• Successful guidewire crossing of the target lesion(s) is required prior to enrollment  
 
If a subject does not satisfy all inclu sion criteria and/or does meet one of the exclusion 
criteria, the investigator will not randomize/enroll the subject and will proceed with treatment according to the center’s standard procedures , and the subject wil l be considered a screen 
failure.

Page 52 of 98  
 
  Subjec ts, who are enrolled/ randomized in to the DES BTK arm but  do not have the DES BTK  
stent successfully implanted , will be followed for 30 days for safety, and be withdrawn from 
the trial afterwards . 
10.9.3. Guidelines for trea tment of flow -limiting dissection or othe r loss of target vessel 
patency at the completion of the target l esion pre- treatment and d efinition of 
bailout s tenting  
Subjects randomized to the PTA  arm, who receive index angioplasty and subsequently 
demonstrate flow -limiting dissection or  other loss of target vessel patency  (ie, recoil ), based 
on the operator visual assessment and clinical judgement (ie, presence of contrast in the sub-
intimal space) , must re ceive repeat  2 to 5 minute s balloon inflations  (up to 3 inflations)  using 
standard PTA balloons . If target vessel compromise persists and requires further i ntervention 
(eg, “bailout  stent”) a DES BTK Vascular Stent System will be used, and these subjects will 
be considered a study primary endpoint failure and continue to attend study follow -up visits. 
Investigators must submit angiography to support the  decision for bailout stenting to the 
angio core lab for review.  
Note: The DES BTK  Vascular Sten t System may not be used for bailout in non- target 
lesions.

  10.13. Source Documents  
The investigator is responsible for the preparation, review and retention of records  used for 
the trial. It is preferable that original source documents are maintained, when available. In 
lieu of original source documents, certified copi[INVESTIGATOR_113609]. A certified 
copy is a copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the orig inal r ecord that has been 
verifie d (ie, by a dated signature [INVESTIGATOR_4388] [CONTACT_97214] a validated process) to have the 
same information, including data that describe s the context, content, and structure, as the 
original.  
The investigator will, at minimum,  maintain the following accurate,  complete and current 
records relating to the investigator’s participation in the trial.  
• Correspondence with another investigator, an IRB/ EC, the sponsor, a monitor, or 
FDA including required reports  
• Records of receipt,  use or disposition of investigationa l devices ( ie, product

The sample s ize justification and the power analyses for phase A  RCT and phase B  non-
randomized are described in separate subsections. The general statistical methods are 
applicable to both phases unless otherwise specified.  
The details for sample size justification and all statistical analyses  will be described in the 
statistical analysis plan.  
11.1. Primary Endpoints for Phase A  RCT  
The overall sample size in phase A  RCT is justified by [CONTACT_400947] 12- month primary effectiveness endpoint , to preser ve adequate statistical testing power 
for both the primary effectiveness endpoint and safety endpoint.

  The primary effectiveness and safety hypotheses will be tested simultaneously at the 
significanc e lev el of one -sided 2.5%  each without adjustment .  
11.1.1. Prima ry Effectiveness Endpoint  
The primary effectiveness endpoint in phase A  RCT  is the  12-month primary patency. The 
goal is set to demonstrate that the primary patency for the DES BTK  treatment group ( ie, 
Test) is superior to the PTA treatment group ( ie, Cont rol) through [ADDRESS_505606] -procedure.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Effectiveness Hypothesis  
The primary effectiveness hypothesis to be tested is that the 12- month primary patency in 
subjects treated with the DES BTK  Vascular Stent System is superior to subjects treated with  
PTA at an  overall one -sided signific ance level of 2.5%. 
The null hypothesis (H 0) states that there is no pre -specified treatment effect of the DES BTK  
Vascular Stent System vs PTA , as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H 1) which states 
that there is a pre- speci fied treatment  effect. The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt -  Pc ≤  0 
H1: Pt -  Pc > 0 (superior)  
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month primary patency for the DES BTK  stent and PTA, 
respectively.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Effectiveness Sample Size  
The overall sample size i s driven by t he primary ef fectiveness endpoint. Approximately [ADDRESS_505607] is based on the following assumptions. 
• Power ≥ 84%  
• One-sided overall significance level (alp ha) = 2.5%  
• Expected PTA 12- month primary patency = 40%  
• DES BTK  to demonstrate 25% t reatment effect  
• Allocation ( DES BTK  vs PTA) = 2:1 
• A minimum of 1 50 evaluable subjects are required at 12 months (ideally 100 in DES 
BTK  arm and 50 in PTA  arm) 
• Attrition rate in 12 months ≤ 25% 
• Approximately 201 subjects are planned to be randomized in 2:1 fashion prior to the 
procedure  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Effectiveness Statistical Methods  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the primary effectiveness hypothesis . The p -value and 
corresponding c onfidence interva l for the difference between DES BTK and PTA in 12-
month primary patency will be constructed.

Page [ADDRESS_505608] -procedure.   
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Hypot hesis  
The primary safety hypothesis to be tested is that the 12- month MAE -free rate in subjects 
treated with the DES BTK Vascular Stent System is non- inferior to  subjects treated with 
PTA at an overall one -sided significance level of 2.5%. 
The null hypothe sis (H 0) states that there is no marginal treatment effect of the  DES BTK  
Vascular Stent System vs PTA , as opposed to the alternative hypothesis (H 1) which states 
that there is a marginal treatment effect. The hypotheses inequalities are shown below:  
H0: Pt - Pc ≤  ∆  
H1: Pt -  Pc > ∆ 
where Pt and Pc are the 12 -month MAE -free rate for the DES BTK  stent and PTA, 
respectively, and Δ (delta) is the non- inferiority margin of - 10%.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Sample Size/Power Analysis  
The power analysis for the primary safety endpoin t is based on the following assumptions. 
• One-sided overall significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• The primary safety endpoint will be tested simultaneously with the primary 
effectiveness endpoint at the same significance level  
• Expected PTA 12- month MAE -free rat e = 75%  
• Expected DES BTK  12-month MAE -free rate = 85%  
• Non-inferiority margin (∆) = - 10% 
The sample size is driven by [CONTACT_400948] 
80% power to assess the primary safety endpoint . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Statistical Methods  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the  primary safety hypothesis . The p -value and 
corresponding confidence interval for the difference between DES BTK and PTA in  12-
month MAE -free rate will be constructed.  
A detailed definition of evaluable subjects for the primary safety endpoint  will be giv en in 
the statistical analysis plan.

Page [ADDRESS_505609] are defined as both the primary effectiveness 
and primary safety endpoint to be met simultaneously, therefore there will be no multiplicity 
issues for the two primary endpoi nts. 
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded to be superior to PTA for device 
effectiveness if the on e-sided lower bound of 97.5 % confidence interval on the difference 
between treatment groups ( DES BTK  – PTA) in 12- month primary patency is grea ter than 
zero.  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded to have  no safety concerns if the 
one-sided lower bound of 97.5% confidence interval on the difference between treatment 
groups ( DES BTK  – PTA) in 12- month MAE -free is greater than - 0.1. 
The trial will be concluded to be a success  if both the primary effectiveness en dpoint and the 
primary safety endpoint are met . 
11.2. Primary Endpoint for Phase B  Non -randomized  
The overall sample size in phase B  non- randomized is justified by [CONTACT_400949] s and 
driven by [CONTACT_941] 12- month primary safety endpoint , to preserve adequate statistical testing 
power. The 12 -month primary patency will be observed without testing hypotheses . 
11.2.1. Primary Safety Endpoint  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Hypotheses  
The primary safety hypothesis to be te sted is that the 12- month MAE -free rate in subjects 
treated with the DES BTK Vascular Stent System exceeds a PG of 71% at one -sided 
significance level of 2.5%.  
The null (H 0) and the alternative (H 1) hypot heses for the primary safety endpoint are as 
follows : 
H0: Pt ≤ PG (not met)  
H1: Pt > PG (met)  
where Pt is th e 12- month MAE -free rate for the subjects treated with the DES BTK Vascular 
Stent System and the PG is the performance goal.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Sample Size/Power Analysis  
The power analysis for the primary safety endpoint to justify an  additional 100 subjects in 
enrol lment is based on the following assumptions. 
• Power ≥ 80%  
• One-sided significance level (alpha) = 2.5%  
• Safety PG = 71% in the 12- month MAE -free rate  
• Expected 12- month MAE -free rate = 80%

  • A minimum of 1 86 (DES BTK ) evaluable subjects are required at 12 months  
• Attrition rate at 12 months ≤  20%  
• Up to  234 ( DES BTK ) subjects are planned to be enrolled, including [ADDRESS_505610] and an additional 100 DES BTK  subjects to be enrolled 
in phase B  non- randomized 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Safety Statistical Methods  
A Wald z- test will be used to assess the  primary  safety hypothesis . The p-value for testing 
will be generated and the corresponding confidence interval for the observed 12- month 
MAE -free rate will be constructed.  
11.2.2. Success Criteria  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System will be concluded as meeting the PG for device safety 
if the one -sided  lower  bound of  97.5% confidence interval on the observed 12- month MAE -
free rate is greater than 0.71.  
11.3. General Statistics Methods  
11.3.1. Analysis Sets  
For phase A  RCT, t he intention- to-treat (ITT) population will be the primary analysis set for 
asses sing the primary hypotheses. Both per -protocol (PP) and as -treated (AT) populations 
will be the secondary analyses sets for reference . 
For phas e B non- randomized, all subjects who receive the DES BTK  stent  will be assessed  
against the pre -specified PG.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Intention -to-treat (ITT)  
All subjects who sign the informed consent form and are randomized in phase A  RCT will be 
included in the ITT analysis s et, regardless of whether the subjects receive the assigned 
treatment. The DES BTK  and PTA arms will be compared as randomized.  The ITT analysis 
will be the primary analysis for phase A  RCT . 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Per-protocol (PP)  
For the PP analysis, only randomized subjects w ho meet the eligibility criteria and receive 
the assigned index treatment will be included in the PP analysis set. The DES BTK  and PTA 
arms will be compared as randomized and cor rectly received index treatment . Subjects who 
do not receive the randomized in dex treatment will be excluded from the PP analysis set. T he 
PP analysis , as well as a discussion regarding what protocol deviations excluded subjects 
from the PP analysis , will be described in the clinical study report . 
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pi[INVESTIGATOR_400898] 92193192 /Version F  
Page 60 of 98  
 
  [IP_ADDRESS]. As-treated (AT)  
For the AT analysis , all subjects who receive either the DES BTK  stent or PTA at the index 
procedure will be included in the AT analysis set. The DES BTK  and PTA arms will be 
compared as treated, excluding subjects who do not receiv e the DES BTK  stent or PTA.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. Bailout Subjec ts Considerations  
For phase A RCT , the bailout subjects in the PTA arm will be analyzed in ITT, PP, and AT 
analysis sets.  
• For the ITT analysis, a bailout subject from the PTA arm will stay in the PTA arm 
and will count as a failure on the 12- month primary patency.  
• For the PP analysis, a bailout subject from the PTA arm will be excl uded from the PP 
analysis since the bailout subjects actually receive a device (investigational or not) in addition to randomized PTA.  
• For the AT analysis, a bailout subject fr om the PTA arm will be analyzed in the DES 
BTK arm if the subject receives the DES BTK test device as a bailout and count as 
success/failure based on 12-month effectiveness assessment  
For phase B non- randomized , the AT analysis will be the primary analysis . That is, all 
subjects who receive the DES BTK stent will be assessed against the pre -specified PG. 
Therefore, bailout subjects from the RCT PTA arm (and/or even from test device) who receive the DES BTK stent  will be included in the phase B hypothesis. 
11.3.2. Randomization Scheme  
Randomization to treatment in phase A RCT will be stratifie d by [CONTACT_400950]. A computer -generated list of random treatment allocations ( ie, a randomization 
sched ule) will be used to assign subjects to treatments in a 2:[ADDRESS_505611] igational  center . Random permuted blocks of size 3 and 
size 6 will be employed to ensure approximate balance of treatment allocatio n within each 
stratum. 
11.3.3. Control for Systematic Error/Bias  
Selection of subjects will be made from the investigators’ general o r professional referral 
population. All subjects meeting the inclusion and no exclusion criteria , and have signed the 
protocol -specific ICF , will be eligible for enrollment in the trial. Consecutively eligible 
subjects should be enrolled into the trial to minimize selection bias. Trial subjects will be 
randomly assigned to a treatment group within the investigational  center  (phase A  RCT). In 
determining subject eligibility for th e trial, the investigator’s assessment of imaging will be 
used. However, an angiographic core laboratory will independently analyze the angiograms , 
and the data obtained from the core laboratory will be utilize d for analyses. An independent 
clinical events  committee (CEC) , composed of medical experts , will adjudicate safety 
assessmen ts, as defined in the CEC charter.

Page [ADDRESS_505612], investigational centers  will not be allowed to randomize more than 10% 
(N=20) of the  total number of randomized subjects without prior approval from the sponsor. 
No study center will be allowed to enroll more than 20% (N=40) of the total number of 
randomized subjects. 
For phase B non- randomized, investigational centers  will not be allowed  to enroll more than 
10% (N=23) of the total number (including DES BTK from pha se A RCT) of subjects 
without prior approval  from the sponsor. No study center  will be allowed to enroll more than 
20% (N=47) of the total number (including DES BTK  from phase A  RCT) of study subjects . 
11.3.5. Baseline Data Analysis  
Baseline covariates will be sum marized for phase A  RCT and phase B  non-randomized. For 
continuous and/or ordinal variables, the descriptive statist ics will include mean, standard 
deviation, number evaluated, minimum and maximum. Some specific variables may also 
include additional statis tics such as median and confidence intervals. For binary or 
categorical variables, the descriptive statistics will include percentage, numerator, 
denominator, and number evaluat ed. Some variables may include confidence intervals as 
needed.  
11.3.6. Additional  Endpo int Assessments 
No formal tests of hypotheses are proposed for additional endpoints. Statistical comparisons 
may be performed for exploratory purposes. No formal inferences are planned on the 
additional endpoints and therefore alpha -adjustments for multiple comparisons will not be 
used. 
All additional endpoints are observational.  
11.3.7. Interim Analyses  
No interim analyses ar e planned.  
11.3.8. Subgroup Analyses  
Primary endpoints and/or additi onal endpoints will be summarized and treatment groups may 
be compared in each subgroup identified by [CONTACT_400951] (but not limit to):  
• Race  
• Gender (male vs female)  
• Age (≥ 65 and < 65)  
• Diabet es status (medically -treated vs non -diabetic)  
• Lesion c haracteristics (vessel diameter/lesion length)  
• Device matrix (diameter/length)  
• Other significant predictors identified by [CONTACT_400952]/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P

Page [ADDRESS_505613] for the primary effectiveness a ssessment at two -sided 
significance level of 0.15 will be performed for the following subgroups:  
• Gender (male vs female)  
11.3.9. Justification of Pooling  
The concept of poolability ana lysis described below is applicable to both phase A  RCT and 
phase B  non- randomized. 
 
The poolability analysis regarding the primary effectiveness and/or safety endpoint across 
investigational center s, as well as among US , Europe, and  Japan  will be assessed  only when 
the success criteria are met, by [CONTACT_2329] t he logistic regression model with a two -sided 
significance level of 0.15. If the p- value of an interaction test is greater than or equal to 0.15, 
the non- significance suggests that the homogeneity of treat ment effect is shown , and the 
primary endpoints dat a are poolable. However , when the p- value of an interaction test is 
smaller than 0.15, the significance suggests that the heterogeneity of treatment effect is 
detected , and poolability analysis regarding prognostic factors and/or poolability adjusted for 
prognostic factors will be performe d. 
[IP_ADDRESS]. Investigational Center Poolablity  
Due to the 2:1 randomization scheme using random permuted blocks ( ie, blocks of 3 and 6) 
employed within each center , ideally there wi ll be [ADDRESS_505614]. O nly sites that enrolled sufficient subjects (i.e. 5 or more subjects) will be included 
for this poolability analysis and these sites will be reported individually.  
[IP_ADDRESS]. US, Europe, and Japan  Poolablity  
The focu s is mostly on the applicability of  the European and Japanese populations with the 
US po pulation. If the treatment effect is significantly different among US , Europe, and 
Japanese populations then possible/plausible explanation is required and/or potential  bias 
needs to be addressed.  
11.3.10.  Sensitivity Analys is for Missing Outcome Data 
Sensitivity analyses for the primary effectiveness and/or safety endpoints will be conducted 
to assess the impact of missing data on the result’s robustness. In addition to the use  of the 
worst -case analysis, the tippi[INVESTIGATOR_11300] a nalysis will be performed for the ITT  and PP analys es 
sets to consider all combinations of present/absent for all subjects with missing primary 
outcome in the DES BTK  group and the PTA group.

Clinically and/or statistically meaningful baseline covariates will b e selected in the 
regre ssion model. No formal conclusion will be made by [CONTACT_400953] -hoc analysis . 
11.3.12.  Analyses Software  
All statistical analyses will be performed using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), 
version 9.2 or later (Copyright © 2002- 2010 by [CONTACT_142214]., Cary, North Carolina 
[ZIP_CODE], [LOCATION_003]. All rights reserved).  
11.3.13.  Chang es to Planned Analyses  
Any changes to the planned statistical analyses made prior to performing the interim and/or the final primary analyses will be documented in an a mended statistical anal ysis plan, 
approved prior to performing the analyses . 
Changes from the planned statistical methods after performing the analyses will be 
documented in the clinical trial report along with a reason for the deviation. 
12. Health Economics Outcomes  
A formal health economics analysis may be compl eted as part of this trial, give n meaningful 
clinical results are obtained. This will take into consideration any differences in survival, 
complication rates, quality of life, and resource utilization. The EQ -5D questionnai re, generic 
quality of life measure, and the VascuQol  questionnai re, disease specific quality of life 
measure, will be used to  assess health utilities.  
Non-inpatient health care visits related to CLI will be documented using an unscheduled visit 
eCRF. (ie,  clinic visit, emergency room or urgent care visit, etc) .  
13. Data M anagement  
13.1. Data Collection, Processing, and Review  
Subject data will be recorded in a limited access secure electronic data capture (EDC) system.  
The clinical database will reside on a produc tion server hosted by [CONTACT_51580] . All changes 
made to the clinical data will be captured in an electronic audit trail and available for review 
by [CONTACT_400954]. The associated R ave software and database have 
been designed to meet re gulatory compliance for deployment as part of a validated system 
compliant with laws and regulations applicable to the conduct of clinical trials pertaining to the use of electronic records and signatures. Database backups are perfor med regularly.

written signature [CONTACT_5761] [CONTACT_1295]. Changes to data previously submitted to the sponsor require a n ew electronic 
signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_941] i nvestigator acknowledging a nd approving the change s. 
Visual and/or electronic data review will be performed to iden tify possible data 
discrepancies. Manual and/or automatic queries will be created in the Medidata EDC system 
and will be issued to the investigational center  for appropriate response. Investigational 
center staff will be responsible for resolving all queri es in the database.  
All access to the clinical database will be changed to “Read only” after all data is either 
“Hard Locked” or “Entry Locked”. Once acceptance of the final report or finalization of 
publications (as applicable) is received, final database storage and archiving activities can begin. Once all of the closeout activities are completed a request to IT is submitted to have 
the “Database Locked” or “ Decommissioned”  and all database access revoked.  
13.2. Data and Record Retention  
The principal i nvestigator or his/her designee or investigational center  will maintain  all 
essential study documents and source documentation that support  the data collected on the 
trial subj ects in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements .   
The principal i nvestigato r or his/her designee will take measures to prevent accidental or 
premature destruction of these documents . If for any reason the pr incipal investigator or 
his/her designee withdraws responsibility for maintaining these essential documents, custody 
must be  transferred to an individual who wi ll assume responsibility and [LOCATION_011] Scientific  
must receive written notification of this custodi al change. Investigational center s are required 
to inform [LOCATION_011] Scientific in writing where paper or electronic files are maintained in case 
files are stored off site and are not readily available.  
In Japan, [LOCATION_011] Scientific will maintain necessary essen tial documents for 5 years from the 
date of the marketing application approval (or during the period of user -results evaluat ion, if 
applicable and if longer than 5 years) or until [ADDRESS_505617] retain essent ial documents during the period of 
use-results evaluation . 
13.3. Core Laboratories  / Central assessment of study data 
Core laboratories will be established for the central assessment of k ey data collected for t he 
trial. Guidelines for the collection, analysis, a nd interpretation of the data will be provided in 
the manual of operations. The followi ng core laboratories  / central reviewers  have been 
assigned  for the SAVAL  trial:

  • Angiography:  
o To assess the angiogram s collected for the trial during the index procedure  
and during subsequent revascularization procedures when collected according 
to the investigational center’s standard procedures  
o To assess CTA or DSA angiographies taken at the 12- month follow -up visit i n 
case the 12 -month DUS is non- diagnostic  
o To confirm stent fractures identified by [CONTACT_941] X -ray core lab  
o When bailout stenting is required t he angiography  core lab will assess 
angiograms collected to document the bailout process  
• X-ray: to  review the x- rays collected for the trial to assess stent integrity * 
• Ultrasound:  to assess duplex ultrasound studies collected for the trial  for lesion and 
stent patency  
• Independent Wound Reviewer: to review wound assessment data and images. 
*Note: When a  stent fracture is identified , the x- ray will be reviewed by [CONTACT_400955] . 
14. Deviations  
A trial deviation is an event where t he investigator or the invitational center personnel did not 
conduct the clinical trial according  to the clinical protocol, clinical study agreement, or 
applicable laws an d regulations . 
An investigator must not make any changes or deviate from this protocol , except to protect 
the life and physical well -being of a subject in an emergency. An investigat or will notify the 
sponsor and the reviewing IRB/ EC, and the regulatory authority if applicable  of any 
deviation from the investigational plan to protect the l ife or physical well -being of a subject 
in an emergency, and those deviations which affect the sc ientific integrity of the clinical 
investigation. Such notice will be give n as soon as possible, but no later than 5 working days 
after the emergency occurred,  or per prevailing local requirements, if sooner than 5 working 
days.  
Deviations may include  but are not limited to: 
• Failure to obtain subject informed consent prior to beginning trial activities  
• Violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Failure to report  serious or unanticipated adverse device effect or serious or 
unexpected AEs  
• Failure to collect protocol -required assessments  
• Subject missed visit or visit outside of wind ow 
 All deviations from the investigational plan, with the reason for the deviation a nd the date of 
occurrence, must be documented and reported to the sponsor using the EDC system.

  Investigational centers may also be required to report deviations to the IR B/EC, and the 
regulatory authority, per local guidelines and national government  regulations.  
Deviations attributable t o the worldwide COVID -19 virus pandemi c will be  documented and 
reported to the sponsor using the EDC system.  The statistical analysis plan provides further 
detail on the handling of missing data , drop-outs, and prot ocol deviation .  
Deviations will be reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and, as necessary, appropriate 
corrective and preventive actions including IRB /EC and regulatory authority  notification, 
investigational center re -training, or center  discontinuation /termination ) will be put into place 
by [CONTACT_456]. 
The sponsor wil l not approve protocol waivers.  
15. Device  Accountability  for Products Labelled Investigational  
The invest igational devices/equipment will be securely maintained, controlled, a nd used only 
in this clinical trial. Investigational product must be stored in a secured and locked location 
accessible only to those delegated individuals who are authorized by [CONTACT_400956] [INVESTIGATOR_248922].  
For investi gational -labelled items, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_400907]:  
• Securely maintain and control access to these items to ensure they are used only in this clinical study and only per the protocol  
• Ensure the storage envi ronment for these items is appropriate for maintaining 
conditions per the items’ labeling (e.g. temperature, humidity, etc., as applicable)  
• Return remaining items upon Sponsor request a nd in the condition in which they were 
provided;  reasonable wear and t ear excepted  
 
The sponsor (or delegate) will keep records to document the physical location of all 
investigational devices from shipment from [LOCATION_011] Scientific (or designated facility) to the investigational center s until return or disposal. 
Records will b e maintained by [CONTACT_400957].  
The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_400908] a uthorized designee will keep records documenting the

18. Potential Risks and Benefits  
18.1. Anticipate d Adverse Events  Associated with use and the Implantation of the 
DES BTK Vascular Stent System during an endovascular procedure  
• Allergic reaction (to drug/polym er, contrast, device or other)  
• Amputation  
• Bleeding/Hemorrhage  
• Death  
• Embolization (air, plaque, t hrombus, device, tissue or other)  
• Hematoma  
• Ischemia  
• Need for urgent intervention or surgery  
• Pseudoaneurysm formation 
• Renal insufficiency or failure 
• Restenosis of stented artery  
• Sepsis/infection  
• Thrombosis/thrombus  
• Transient hemodynamic instability (hypote nsive/hypertensive epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841])  
• Vasospasm  
• Vessel injury, including perforation, trauma, rupture and dissection  
• Vessel occlusion   
18.2. Adverse Events Unique to the Pacli taxel Drug Coating  
Certain side effects an d discomforts have been reported in subjects that have  received 
paclitaxel in intravenous forms as part of chemotherapy treatment. These subjects may have 
other comorbid conditions and/or have received concomitant medications that may also contribute to the reported side effects. In these circumstances the do se was delivered 
throughout the body by [CONTACT_400965]. Potential adverse events that ma y be 
unique to the paclitaxel drug coating are:  
Form/Template 90702637_Rev/Ver A P 
Confidential     SAVAL Pi[INVESTIGATOR_400898] 92193192 /Version F  
Page 72 of 98  
 
  • Allerg ic/immunologic reactions to drug (paclitaxel or structurally -related compounds) or 
the polymer stent coating (or its individual components)  
• Alopecia  
• Anemia  
• Gastrointestinal symptoms  
• Hematologic dyscrasi a (including leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia)  
• Hepatic enzyme changes  
• Histologic changes in the vessel wall, including inflammation, cellular damage or 
necrosis  
• Myalgia/arthralgia  
• Peripheral neuropathy  
 Meta- analyses of randomized controlled trials of paclitaxel- coated balloons and paclitaxel -
eluting stents used to treat peripheral arterial disease in the femoropopliteal arteries have 
identified an increased risk of late mortality at [ADDRESS_505620] of other drug -containing devices. 
Inadequate information is available to evaluate the potential mortal ity risk associated with the 
use of paclitaxel -coated devices for the treatment of other diseases/conditions. Physicians 
should discuss the benefits and risks of all available treatment options with patients. 
18.3. Risks Associated with Participation in the Clin ical Trial  
Risks associated  with venipuncture include ecchymosis, hematoma, infections, inflammation 
and pain. There may be additional risks linked to the inves tigational device procedure and 
follow -up testing that are unknown. Tests  planned for the trial follow -up phase is standard of 
care procedures except for the collection of high definition x- ray to assess stent integrity.  
18.4. Possible Interactions with Concomi tant Medical Treatments  
In addition to the risks associated with the implantation of stents and the use of paclitaxel, the 
use of prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy after stent implantation may increase the risk of bleeding. Refer to the package insert fo r further information on drug interactions and side 
effects associated with paclitaxel  or antith rombotic/antiplatelet medic ations.  
18.5. Risk Minimization Actions  
Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, performin g procedures in the appropriate healthcare environment, adherence to subject 
selection criteria,  close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research 
procedures and/or follow -ups and by [CONTACT_400966] t 
information required by [CONTACT_3181].

  18.6. Anticipated Benefits  
Potential anticipated benefits inc lude the effective treatmen t of atherosclerotic infrapopliteal 
lesions with improvement in the symptoms of disease. However, the DES BTK  Vascular 
Stent System i s an investigational device and these potential benefits may or may not actually 
be present.  
18.7. Risk to Benefit Rationale  
The DES BTK  Vascular Stent System  is expected to be suitable for its intended purpose. 
There are no unacceptable residual risks/intolerab le risks and all applicable risks have been 
addressed through the provision of appropriate direc tions for use (DFU). The DE S BTK  
Vascular Stent System is expected to have an acceptable adverse event profile when used 
under the conditions intended; the bene fits associated with the use of the DES BTK  Vascular 
Stent System are expected to outweigh the r isks. 
19. Safety Reporting 
19.1. Reportable Events  by [CONTACT_400967] (or

 Relationship to the device , comparator  or procedures can be excluded when:  
• The event has no temporal relationship with the use of the investigational 
device or the procedures  related to the use of the investigational device ; 
• The event does not follow a known response pattern to the medical device (if 
the response pattern is previously known) a nd is biologically impla usible ; 
• The discontinuation of medical device application or the reduction of the level 
of activation/exposure - when clinically feasible – and reintroduction of its use 
(or increase of the level of activation/exposure), do not impa ct on the event ; 
• The event involves a body- site or an organ that cannot  be affected by [CONTACT_5746];  
• The event can be attributed to another cause ( eg, an underlying or concurrent 
illness/clinical condition, an effect of another d evice, drug, treatment or other 
risk fa ctors) ; 
• The event does not depend on a false result given by [CONTACT_5747], when applicable;  
• In order to establish the non -related ness,  not all the criteria listed above might 
be met at the same time, depending on the type of device/procedures and the event .

Safety reporting on the control device, which is approved in all regions at the time of the trial 
initiation, will be handled separately according to local regula tions.  
20. Informed Consent  
Subject partici pation in this clinical trial is voluntary. Informed consent is required from each 
subject or his/her legally authorized representative. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that informed consent is obtained prior to any trial -required procedure or  testing, the 
use of an investigational device, and data collection.  
The obtaining and documentation of informed consent must be in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, IS O [ZIP_CODE], any applic able national regulations, and 
local in stitutional ethics  committee and/or regulatory authority, as applicable. [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific will provide a template of the ICF to investigators participating in this trial. The ICF template may be mo dified to meet the requirements of the investigative  center’s IRB/ EC.  
Approval of the investigational center’s ICF is required by [CONTACT_5756] (or designee) and the governing IRB/ EC prior to the first use and any time the ICF is updated during the 
trial. 
The ICF must be in a language understandable to the s ubject and, when n eeded, [LOCATION_011] 
Scientific (or delegate) will assist the investigational center with obtaining ICF translation. Translated ICFs must also have IRB/ EC approval prior to their use. Pri vacy language will be 
included in the body of the form or as a separate form  in compliance with local requirements.  
The process of obtaining informed c onsent will, at minimum, include the following and will

decision to participate th roughout the clinic al trial 
• Avoid any coercion of or undue  influence of a su bject to participate  
• Will not waive or appear to waive subject’s legal rights  
• Will use native language that is non- technical and understandable to the subject or his/her 
legal repr esentative  
• Provide ample time for the subject to consider participation and ask questions  
• Explain that important new information is to be provided to new and existing subjects 
throughout the clinical trial  
 
The ICF will be signed and personally dated by t he subject (or legal representative competent 
to sign the ICF under the appl icable laws, rules, regulations and guidelines) and by [CONTACT_36284]/or an authorized designee responsible for conducting the informed consent 
process. The original signed I CF will be retained  by [CONTACT_251274] c enter  and a co py of 
the signed a nd dated document and any other written information must be given to the person 
signing the ICF. The subject will receive a signed copy of the ICF and other written information as approved by [CONTACT_1201] /EC. 
For individuals less than [ADDRESS_505635]’s legal 
representative, as well as the subject, must provide written informed consent. In Japan, ICF 
signature [CONTACT_400992] [CONTACT_400973] e individuals. 
If the informed consent is obtained the sa me day the subject begins participation in trial -
related procedures, it must be clearly documented in the subject’s medical record that consent 
was obtained prior to participation in any trial -relate d procedures.  
Failure to obtain  subject consent will be r eported by [CONTACT_400974] ( eg, FDA requirement is within 5 
working days of learning of such an event).  
Any violation of the informed consent process must be reported as a deviat ion to the sponsor 
and in compliance with local requirements ( ie, regulatory authority, IRB/ EC). 
If new information becomes available that can significantly affect a subject's futu re health 
and medic al care, that information will be provided to the affecte d subject(s) in written form 
via a revised ICF or, in some situations, enrolled subjects may be requested t o sign and date 
an addendum to the ICF. In addition to new significant information during the course of a 
trial, other situations may necessitate rev ision of the ICF, such as if there are amendments to 
the applicable laws, protocol, a change in principal i nvestigator, administrative changes, or 
following annual review by [CONTACT_32629] B/EC. The new versi on of the ICF must be approved by 
[CONTACT_1201]/ EC. Acceptance by [CONTACT_400975] ’s IRB/ EC. The IRB/ EC will determine the subject

  Term  Definition  
Death  All deaths are c onsidered cardiac u nless an unequivocal non -
cardiac cause can be established. Specifically, an unexpected death 
in subjects with coexisting potentially fatal non- cardiac diseases 
(e.g. cancer, infection) should be classified as cardiac.  
All death events wi ll be submitted to the CEC and will be 
categorized as:  
• Cardiac death: any death due to immediate cardiac cause (e.g. MI, low -output failure, fatal arrhythmia) . Unwitnes sed 
death and death of unknown cause will be classified as cardiac death. This includes all procedure related deaths including those related to concomitant treatment.  
• Vascular death: death due to cerebrovascular disease, pulmonary embolism, ruptured aortic aneurysm, dissecting 
aneurysm, or other vascular cause . 
• Non-cardiova scular death: any death not covered by [CONTACT_389111], including death due to infection, sepsis, pulmonary causes, accident, suicide, or trauma.  
Diameter Stenosis  The ma ximal narr owing of the target lesion relative to the 
reference vessel diameter.  
Dissection NHLBI 
Grade Types  Type A - Small radiolucent area within the lumen of the vessel 
disappearing with the passage of the contrast material. 
Type B - Appearance of contrast medium parallel to the lumen of 
the vessel disappearing within a few cardiac  cycles.  
Type C - Dissection protruding outside the lumen of the vessel 
persisting after passage of the contrast material.  
Type D - Spi[INVESTIGATOR_400921]-
off of the contrast material in the antegrade flow.  
Type E - Persisten t luminal filling defect with delayed run -off of 
the contrast material in the distal lumen.  
Type F - Filling defect accompanied by [CONTACT_322666]. 
Distal embolizat ion Migration of  a filling defect, or thrombus, to distally occlude the 
target vessel  or one of its branches.

  28. Appendices  
28.1. Appendix A: Affect to Medicare Beneficiaries (US only)  
Critical limb isch emia (CLI) represents the terminal stage of obstructive, atherosclerotic, 
peripheral arterial disease. Patients affected by [CONTACT_400987][INVESTIGATOR_400924]- term pathol ogical 
consequences of hypertension, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_035], diabetes mellitus, and renal failure.1  When 
left untreated, CLI caused major amputat ion in 73% of the patients with rest pain and in 95% 
of the patients with tissue loss at 1 year.2  Diabetics with CLI are at part icularly high risk for 
advanced complications; studies indicate that within one year of CLI diagnosis, 40% to 50% of diabetics will experience an amputation.
3 Incidence of CLI increases sharply among 
Medicare beneficiaries ages 65 to 69 (0.13%) to 85 and older (0.31%). As many as 33% of new CLI Medicare beneficiaries may undergo primary amputation within 1 year after diagnosis.

According to HCUP National Inpatient Sample (NIS) all payer 2014 claims data*, Medicare is the payer for 69% of pati ents with lower extremity atherosclerosis and 67% of patients 
treated with Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or peripheral stent**. The subjects eligible for inclusion in the SAVAL  trial are likely to align with HCUP patients due to their 
expected age. Medicare eligible patients are not expected to respond differently to treatment 
compared to other patients, therefore the results of this trial are likely to be highly generalizable to the Medicare population.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:  
• Unequivocal histologic diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).  
• Detection of the t(9;22)(q34;q11) or 3-way variant by [CONTACT_804652] -ABL positive by [CONTACT_804653] (Q -
PCR or FISH) in a CLIA -approved laboratory.  
• Prior therapy excluded except for up to one week of corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea to enable time for the detection of 
t(9;22)(q34;q11) or BCR -ABL .

• No major conduction abnormality (unless a cardiac pacemaker is present).  
STUDY MONITORING:   
A representative from each institution with one of the first 24* patients  enrolled on the trial ARE REQUIRED  to participate in a 
teleconference with members of t he Alliance Statistics and Data Center  and Alliance Protocol Operations Program Office  staff.  
* Based on the results of the first interim analysis for feasibility and safety, it was decided that the monitoring teleconferences 
would be extended from 12 patients to 24 patients.  
Institutions that do not participate in the teleconferences may be denied future registrations to this trial. See Section 5.1.2  for 
details.  
SCHEMA OVERVIEW:  
Treatment courses are specified using a roman numeral followed by a cardinal numeral indicating the number of days from the start of that course of therapy (i.e., Day III -28 is the 28th day of Course III).  
Patients undergoing peripheral stem cell transplant on this protocol should receive this portion of their therapy at an Allianc e , - 
SWOG -, ECOG -ACRIN- or FACT -credentialed transplant facility, experienced in the applicable techniques of stem cell 
procurement, storage, and administration in conjunction with high-dose, myeloablative chemotherapy.
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
* CNS leukemia at time of entry on study or prior to the beginning of Course III will be treated only if symptomatic (see 
Sections 8.7 and 8.9). Testicular disease at time of entry onto study will be treated according to Section 8.10
. 
** CNS leukemia either during hematologic remission (CR or PR) or after having completed protocol therapy without 
marrow relapse will be treated according to Sections 8.8 and 8.9. Testicular disease during t herapy without marrow relapse will be 
treated according to Section 8.10 . 
*** The treating physician should consult with the Study Chair regarding frail patients who may need to skip Course V and 
continue on to Course VI.R

COURSE I  (Induction Therapy)  
Specimens submitted for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q -PCR) are required prior to initiation of protocol therapy. 
Specimens should be submitted to a CLIA- approved institutional laboratory. 
To control the peripheral blast count for as many as seve n days while confirmation of t(9;22)(q34;q11) or BCR/ABL occurs, 
patients may receive dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day PO or IV (either once daily or in divided doses) or similar corticosteroid 
regimen. Hydroxyurea also is permitted to control leukocytosis, alth ough no other ALL -directed therapy is allowed.  
• Dasatinib 140 mg PO daily continuously during Course I.  
• Dexamethasone 10 mg/m2/day PO or IV (either once daily or in divided doses) on days I -[ADDRESS_1110592] 0.75 mg. 
• Bone marrow examination on day I -15. 
• Lumbar puncture on day I -15 (and, in consenting patients, procure CSF for dasatinib levels; see Section 6.4 ). CNS 
leukemia at time of entry on study or prior to the beginning of Course III will only be t reated if symptomatic. Give IT 
methotrexate 15 mg + hydrocortisone [ADDRESS_1110593] 6 doses and until the CSF is clear. See Section 8.7  
for more detail.  
COURSE II  (Early Intensification Therapy) 
Treatment in this c ourse will depend on the results from the bone marrow examination on day I -15. Patients with ≤ 20% 
blasts will be in Cohort IIA; patients with > 20% blasts will be in Cohort IIB.  It is recommended that patients continue  with 
dasatinib  and onto Course II re gardless of counts.

recommended that an agent with the least inhibitory affect on CYP3A4 be selected if possible. The following 
azoles appear in order of strength of inhibition of CYP3A4: voriconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and 
fluconazole. Fl uconazole at doses of 200 mg or less is not thought to be a significant inhibitor of CYP3A4. Azole 
antifungal agents should not be administered within 5 half lives of vincristine.  
• Daunorubicin (DNR) 30 mg/m2 IV on days II -1, II-8, and II-15. 
• Bone marrow (BM) examination on day II -22 for all patients to assess response.

Hydrocortisone 50 mg should be included with preservative free methotrexate.  
• Vincristine (VCR) 2 mg (flat dose) IV once every two weeks on Days IV -1, IV -15, and IV -29. If use of an azole 
antifungal is necessary, it is recommended that an agent with the least inhibitory affect on CY P3A4 be selected if 
possible. The following azoles appear in order of strength of inhibition of CYP3A4: voriconazole, itraconazo le, 
posaconazole, and fluconazole. Fluconazole at doses of 200 mg or less is not thought to be a significant inhibitor of 
CYP3A4 . Azole antifungal agents should not be administered within 5 half lives of vincristine.  
• IV Methotrexate (IV MTX) 500 mg/m
2 in one liter of D5W or NS IV over 3 hours on days IV -1, IV -15, and IV-29). 
Prior to beginning IV Mtx, patients should be pre- hydra ted with 500 mL - 1000 mL of D 5W or NS plus 100 mEq/L of 
sodium bicarbonate. Continue vigorous hydration as tolerated over the course of the day to maintain hydration and urine 
pH>6. Please check with pharmacy to ensure that patients are not receiving any medications (e.g., sulfonamides, 
salicylates, penicillins, other organic acids, proton pump inhibitors) that may interfere with methotrexate clearance. 
During IV infusion, administer IT Mtx. See Section 8.4  for hydration instructi ons. 
• Oral Methotrexate (PO MTX) 25 mg/m2 PO q6 hours x 4 doses (total) beginning 6 hours after starting each dose of IV 
Mtx (Days 1 & 2, Days 15 & 16, and Days 29 & 30). The dose of oral methotrexate will be adjusted to maintain a serum 
methotrexate leve l between 1 -2 µM according to the instructions in Section 8.4.2 . 
• Serum Mtx (SM) levels should be obtained on Days 2, 4, 16, 18, 30, and 32 (i.e., two levels following each dose of IV 
Mtx, the first at 30 hours after the start of IV Mtx. See Section 8.4.2 ). 
• IV Leucovorin (IV LCV) 25 mg/m2 IV 6 hours after the 4th (last) PO Mtx dose (i.e., 30 hours after starting IV Mtx). 
• Oral Leucovorin (PO LCV) 5 mg/m2 PO q6 hours for a planned 8 doses or until serum Mtx level < 0.05 µ M, beginning 
12 hours after IV Lcv.  
• Bone marrow (BM) examinatio n must be obtained for all patients on Day IV -43 to assess response.  
• MRD assessment on peripheral blood and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_804588] Q -PCR.

COURSE V  
The treating physician should consult with the Study Chair regarding frail patients who may need to skip Course V 
and continue on to Course VI.  
This course include 3 different options:  
(1) Allogeneic Transplantation: for patients age 18- 70 with an HLA -matched related or unrelated donor  
Discontinue dasatinib during Course V allogeneic transplant until approximately Day 30 (see Section 8.6.1 ). 
Patients must be treated at or referr ed to an Alliance -approved, ECOG -ACRIN -approved, SWOG -approved or FACT -
credentialed  allogeneic transplant center to be eligible to receive this portion of the therapy. Course V should begin 
no later than [ADDRESS_1110601] adequate organ function (renal, liver, cardiac, and pulmonary) to meet institutional requirements. See Section [IP_ADDRESS]
 
for antibacterial, antifungal, and Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis.  
Mobilization of allogeneic donor peripheral blood stem cells will be  performed according to institutional guidelines. 
Peripheral blood stem cell collection should target an optimal CD34+ cell dose > 5 x 106 cells/kg (actual weight) with 
a maximum of 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. Stem cells may be collected at any time prior to transplant.

1.1 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with t(9;22); Philadelphia (Ph) Chromosome Positive 
ALL 
The oncogenic fusion gene BCR/ABL that results from the reciprocal translocation 
t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) is the sine qua non for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) that results from the t(9;22) is also the single most frequent chromosome abnormality in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), detected in 11% to 34% of patients with ALL. The prevalence is increased in older adults, especially in individuals over 
60 years of age. The reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 results in the 
head -to-tail fusion of variable numbers of 5’ BCR exons on chromosome band 22q11.[ADDRESS_1110622] of the fusion 
gene resulting from the t(9;22) plays a central role in the development of this form of ALL. Two main fusion proteins, p190
BCR/ABL  and p210BCR/ABL , each containing NH2-terminal domains of 
Bcr and COOH-terminal domains of Abl, are produced depending on the location of the breakpoint within the BCR gene. The p190
BCR/ABL  product contains the first exon of BCR and 
occurs in 50-78% of the ALL cases with t(9;22). The p210BCR/ABL  product contains either exon 
13 or exon 14 of BCR and is ubiquitous in CML and is considerably less frequent in ALL. Of 
note, p190BCR/ABL  transcripts are frequently detected at a low level in p210BCR/ABL -positive ALL.  
Ph+ ALL has been associated with an unfavorable outcome but this has changed since the advent of imatinib mesylate. This introduction will describe the milestones achieved and why 
improvements are still needed beyond imatinib mesylate.  
1.[ADDRESS_1110623] BCR-ABL inhibitor to gai n clinical approval was imatinib mesylate, 
which partially blocks the adenosine triphosphate binding site of BCR-ABL, preventing a 
conformational switch of the oncogenic protein to the activated form [1]. Early studies showed that many previously-treated P h+ ALL patients responded to imatinib monotherapy (400 mg
2 or 
600 mg/day) initially (CR rates 20%) but then quickly (median treatment duration of 58 days) relapsed. Thus, although imatinib was well -tolerated and produced a modest response for 
previously-treated Ph+ ALL when used as single-agent therapy, responses were short-lived, and 
relapse was common [2, 3].  
TKIs with steroids alone  
The treatment of elderly patients with Ph+ ALL has been limited by [CONTACT_804660], the inability to undergo alloSCT because of comorbidities, and the biological characteristics of the disease [4]. Several approaches to using TKI-based therapy have been explored in these patients, including a chemotherapy-free treatment based only on a TKI and steroids. In one study from the Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell’Adulto (GIMEMA), 61–83 years old Ph+ ALL patients received a 7-day steroid pretreatment followed by a 45-day induction of imatinib (800 mg/day) plus prednisone (40 mg/m
2 per day) [5]. Therapy was well 
tolerated, and no major toxicities were reported. All 29 assessable patients (100%) experienced a CHR, and at 12 months, the OS and DFS probabilities were 74% and 48%. The GIMEMA prospective study LAL1205 has evaluated a similar regimen using dasatinib (70 mg) in adult 
Ph+ ALL patients (median age, 54 years) [6]. All 34 (100%) evaluable patients treated with this regimen achieved a CHR, and the OS rate at 10 months was 80.7%. Adding mixed-agent 
chemotherapy to TKI-steroid treatments does not appear to substantially increase 1-year OS or 
decrease relapse rates in elderly Ph+ ALL patients. The Group for Research in Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia AFR09 study, which combined standard induction therapy with 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  16 Update #11  imatinib and prednisone, reported 1-year relapse and OS rates of 58% and 66% [7]. While these 
values were significantly improved from historical controls treated with chemotherapy without 
imatinib, they appear to be at par with chemotherapy-free regimens that include only TKIs and steroids. It would be of i nterest to combine TKIs and steroids with other established non-
myelotoxic agents, e.g., vincristine, in elderly Ph+ ALL patients.

1.[ADDRESS_1110625] been described to date. These are (1) 
mutations at the kinase site, (2) reduced intracellular imatinib mesylate concentration, (3) gene amplification, and (4) alternative signaling pathways functional ly compensating for the 
imatinib -sensitive mechanisms.  
Mutations at the kinase domain impair imatinib’s binding to varying degrees and represent the most common (approximately 40-50%) mechanism of resistance. Recently, kinase domain mutations were found to precede imatinib-based therapy and gave rise to relapse in patients with 
de novo Ph+ ALL [13]. Of note, 12 (46%) of 26 patient samples harbored P -loop (e.g., G250E, 
Q252H, Y253H, E255K/V) mutations and 6 (23%) of 26 patient samples demonstrated 
gatekeepe r (e.g., F311I, T315I, F317L) mutations at diagnosis. Interestingly, remission duration 
did not differ significantly between patients with or without a detectable early mutation in that study. At relapse, ten patients with mutations at diagnosis demonstrated the same mutation while one patient demonstrated a different mutation at relapse. These data suggest that, in contrast to CML, it may be worthwhile to consider mutational analysis at diagnosis in Ph+ ALL and tailor treatment accordingly. Novel drugs that overcome kinase domain mutations are discussed 
below. 
A previous study [13] concluded that other mechanisms of resistance also exist, as three patients 
with wild-type BCR-ABL at diagnosis relapsed without any mutations. Intracellular imatinib 
mesylate concentration has been shown to correlate with response in CML though no such data are yet available in Ph+ ALL. Briefly, drug efflux proteins, such as Permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp, the gene product of ABCB1, formerly MDR1) [14] and breast cancer resistance protein 
(Bcrp1, ABCG2) [15] were shown to lower intracellular imatinib mesylate concentrations in 
CML. Similarly, imatinib mesylate was shown to be a substrate for the organic cation influx 
transporter 1 (OCT1) and reduced OCT1 activity is the cause of l ow in vitro sensitivity to 
imatinib mesylate in CML [16]. Finally, plasma α1-acid glycoprotein concentrations had a 
marked influence on total imatinib mesylate concentrations in CML [17]. While in CML, 
decreased intracellular imatinib mesylate concentrations are addressed by [CONTACT_804661] (up to 800 mg/day), this approach is not proved valid for Ph+ ALL. As discussed below, some of the novel Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors are not 
subject to some of these mechanisms and are also markedly more potent than imatinib mesylate.  
BCR-ABL gene amplification is another mechanism of resistance to imatinib mesylate in CML. 
Though no such data exist so far in Ph+ ALL, duplication of the Ph chromosome was shown to 
be associated with worse outcome in Ph+ ALL in the pre-imatinib era [18]. Further, the effect of novel Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors with significantly more potent anti -Bcr-Abl activity in 
imatinib -resistant cases suggests that this mechanism prevails in Ph+ ALL, too.  
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  18 Update #[ADDRESS_1110626] been implicated in resistance to imatinib mesylate. 
Specifically, the Src (sarcoma) family kinase members, Lyn, Hck, and Fgr, have been shown to 
be elevated in the hematopoietic cells of mice with Ph+ ALL and these proteins are required for the induction of Ph+ ALL in mice [19]. Dasatinib (Sprycel®) and bosutinib (SKI-606) target 
the Src family kinase members in addition to Bcr/Abl as will be discussed below. Stromal support is another alternative pathway involved in imatinib resistance in Ph+ ALL. While the Bcr-Abl kinase continued to be inhibited by [CONTACT_804662], resistant cells proliferated in the 
presence of stromal support [20]. The stromal effect did not require direct cell -cell contact, and 
stromal cell derived factor-1α  substituted for the presence of the stromal cells. These data 
suggest that the stroma selects for imatinib mesylate resistant Bcr-Abl cells that are less 
dependent on the kinase activity; interrupting the interaction between lymphoblasts and the 
stroma may be of benefit in Ph+ ALL.  
Another recently identified mechanism of TKI resistance involves the expression of spliced 
isoforms of Ikaros (IKZF1) [21]. IKZF1 functions as a critical regulator of normal lymphocyte 
development and is involved in the rapid development of leukemia in mice expressing non-DNA-binding isoforms [22]. The IK6 isoform, lacking all 4 N-terminal zinc fingers responsible 
for DNA -binding, was detected in 43 of 47 (91%) Ph+ ALL patients resistant to imatinib or 
dasatinib [21]. In addition, the expression level of IK6 correlated with the BCR-ABL transcript 
level. Hence, restoring Ikzf1 function may provide another approach to combating TKI 
resistance in the future.  
1.4 New Drugs to Overcome Resistance: Dasatinib for Ph+ ALL 
Dasatinib, a dual SRC and ABL inhibitor, has a 325-fold greater potency than imatinib in cells 
transduced with unmutated BCR-ABL and is active against many of the BCR-ABL mutations 
conferring imatinib resistance [23]. Furthermore, dasatinib’s cellular uptake is not dependent on 
OCT-1 activity [24], though like imatinib, it is a substrate for efflux proteins [25].  
The START (SRC/ABL Tyrosine kinase inhibition Activity Research Trials of dasatinib) L 
(imatinib-resistant or -intolerant lymphoid blast crisis and ALL) reported that dasatinib (70 mg 
bid) was relatively well tolerated and produced a major hematological response (MHR) in 41% and major cytogenetic response (MCyR) in 57% of patients after a minimum follow-up of 12 months [26]. The discrepancy between hematologi c and cytogenetic responses likely stems from 
the high incidence of cytopenias induced by [CONTACT_540241]. Median OS was 8.0 months. After 1 year 
of treatment, 22% of patients remained alive and progression-free [26]. A high proportion of 
patients with P - and A -loop mutation of the ABL domain achieved MHR and MCyR [27]. 
However, patients with the T315I and F317L gatekeeper mutations do not respond to dasatinib [27, 28].  Dasatinib is approved in the [LOCATION_002] for Ph+ ALL patients who have failed to respond to imatinib, and clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in newly diagnosed Ph+ ALL are 
ongoing.  
Combining imatinib with conventional chemotherapy revolutionized the treatment of Ph+ ALL; 
CR rates now approach 95%, and 3-year OS can exceed 50% (Table 1) [5,  7-12]. Imatinib may 
be administered either concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy.  
Combination chemotherapy with dasatinib 
Dasatinib combined with conventional chemotherapy is also efficacious and safe in Ph+ ALL 
patients. Combining hyper-CVAD with dasatinib ([ADDRESS_1110627] 14 days of each cycle) 
led to CR in 93% of patients; after a median follow-up of 10 months, 75% were alive, and 64% 
remained in CR. A high incidence of T315I ABL mutation was noted among relapsed patients [29]. AFR 07 evaluated dasatinib in combination with the European Working Group on Adult ALL chemotherapy protocols for the treatment of ≥55 year old Ph+ ALL patients [30]. Dasatinib was administered with vincristine and dexamethasone during induction, sequentially with  
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  19 Update #11  methotrexate and L-asparaginase alternating with cytarabine during consolidation, and with 6-
mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone/vincristine during maintenance. A 95.2% CHR rate was observed, and the rate of serious adverse events was 40%, as expected in this 
population. Responses appeared to be durable; the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) has 
continued to decrease with prolonged therapy.  
This protocol will cover all age groups, 18 and above.  
1.5 Central Nervous System Prophylaxis 
The central nervous system (CNS) is a sanctuary site for ALL, and relapses may occur first in 
the cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872] (CSF). CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is routine. 
Imatinib does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Dasatinib has a potenti al advantage of 
penetrating into the CSF, but this has never been analyzed systematically. We therefore propose to measure dasatinib CSF levels at the time of the first intrathecal administration of chemotherapy. Since dasatinib is presumed to reach a maxi mal CSF level within [ADDRESS_1110628] intrathecal and systemic CNS prophylaxis throughout this study similar to 
the regimen previously used in CALGB C10001.  
1.6 Transplantation for Ph+ ALL 
AlloSCT in first CR remains the standard of care for Ph+ ALL and the only established therapy 
that offers a possibility of cure [31]. However, prior treatment with TKIs can increase the feasibility of SCT in a greater proportion of Ph+ ALL patients by [CONTACT_804663] [4, 32].  In addition, TKIs have increased the proportion of patients experiencing sustained remissions and provides additional time to identify a suitable donor. Reducing BCR-ABL transcript levels after imatinib-based therapy has also resulted in a 
lower pre-SCT tumor burden [4]. Finally, three studies [8, 12, 32] demonstrated a clear benefit for alloSCT over chemotherapy alone (Table 1). Additional data with longer follow-up are necessary to determine whether alloSCT may still be necessary in Ph+ ALL patients treated with TKI-combination chemotherapy regimens.  
The German [12] and our preliminary experience with autologous (auto) SCT in CALGB [ZIP_CODE] 
[33] suggest that this approach is at least as beneficial as allo-SCT but with less toxicity and 
therefore we propose to continue and study this treatment modality herein.  
1.6.2 Auto logous Transplantation for Ph+ ALL 
Not all patients have a suitable donor for allo-HCT. Thus autologous HCT, using stem cells 
collected during the first CR, offers an alternative approach. Using conventional chemotherapy to eradicate residual disease prior to autologous transplantation in ALL 
resulted in poor outcomes with increased disease relapse in a recent study [34]. Therefore, it was concluded that “there was no evidence that a single autologous transplantation can replace consolidation/maintenance for any risk group.” However, using chemotherapy alone to eradicate residual Ph+ disease is suboptimal. We hypothesize that the combination of 
dasatinib with chemotherapy will achieve a better success rate in cleansing the marrow from 
residual disease prior to stem cell collection. As shown in Table 1, several groups [10, 35] 
including CALGB [36], have reported favorable outcomes following autologous transplantation for Ph+ ALL patients <60 years old without suitable allogeneic donors. 
Specifically, in one study [35], the outcomes of patients undergoing autologous versus allogeneic transplantation were similar. Even though the relapse rate was higher among patients who underwent autologous HCT, the higher TRM associated with allogeneic HCT balanced the final outcomes. We will build on our preliminary results from CALGB [ZIP_CODE] 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  20 Update #11  and pursue autologous transplantation for patients ≤70 years old without suitable allogeneic 
donors in the current study.  
We plan to evaluate the role of melphalan as the preparatory regimen for the autologous 
transplantation. Melphalan has been used before in the preparatory regimen for autologous 
transplantation in pediatric ALL [37, 38].  
1.[ADDRESS_1110629] continues to present a scientific dilemma for Ph+ ALL. Several studies continued imatinib until disease recurrence [5, 39, 40] while others had a set time [9, 41, 42] (one to two years) of 
imatinib maintenance. It is difficult to discern a difference between the studies based on patients’ outcomes because of the relatively short follow-up. In our clinical trial of imatinib and chemotherapy followed by [CONTACT_628809] (CALGB C10001) [36] we have continued imatinib maintenance for at least one year and then until two consecutive quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) tests [ADDRESS_1110630] hematologic relapse [9, 40]. We propose herein to continue patients on dasatinib for at least one year and monitor for molecular response and then discontinue dasatinib if two consecutive Q-
PCR tests (three months apart) are negative.  
1.8 The Rational for the Current Study 
We hypothesize that dasatinib and dexamethasone, with minimal additional chemotherapy, will 
be well tolerated by [CONTACT_804664]+ ALL and will result in similar 
leukemia cytoreduction when compared historically to imatinib with either concomitant or sequential cytotoxic chemotherapy. We also hypothesize that a reduced-intensity preparatory regimen of fludarabine + melphalan + alemtuzumab followed by [CONTACT_450418]-matched donors will result in low treatment-related mortality and significant improvement in disease-free survival compared to a no transplantation approach for Ph+ ALL patients ≤70 years 
old. In addition, we hypothesize that autologous CD34+ stem cell collection following dasatinib 
and dexamethasone treatment will result in similar or better collections of BCR/ABL-negative stem cells (by Q-PCR) as we observed following imatinib and standard dose chemotherapy in CALGB [ZIP_CODE], allowing autologous HCT for patients who lack allogeneic donors.  Given that the 3-year progression free survival was 50% for patients enrolled on the CALGB [ADDRESS_1110631] or chemotherapy and will result in 
favorable DFS compared with historical experience prior to TKI treatment.

Version Date: 02/21/2017  22 Update #[ADDRESS_1110635] support and adequate staff to care for the severely neutropenic patient with multiple therapy-induced toxicities will maximize patient safety. Physicians should consider the risks and the benefits of any therapy and 
therefore only enroll patients for which the agents administered are appropriate. Although they will 
not be considered as formal eligibility (exclusion) criteria, as part of this decision-making process physicians should recognize that the following problems may increase the risk to the patient entering 
this protocol:  
• Any other serious illness which would limit survival to <3 months, or psychiatric condition 
which would prevent compliance with treatment or informed consent.  
• Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease.  
• Prior use of the agents administered in this protocol for other non-malignant disease may 
reduce the likelihood of beneficial outcome and should also be considered prior to enrolling 
patients. 
• Elevations of bilirubin, or creatinine that may suggest impaired hepatic or renal function 
must be considered as potentially serious obstacles for safe tolerance of the therapy 
prescribed in this protocol.  
• Physicians should be aware that dasatinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2D6, 
and CYP3A4/5. Studies also show CYP3A4 is the major human p450 enzyme catalyzing biotransformation of dasatinib. Thus, co-administration of drugs which are inducers (e. g.,

Version Date: 02/21/2017  24 Update #11  • CTSU IRB Certification 
• CTSU IRB/Regulatory Approval Transmittal Sheet 
5.2.2 Patient Registration 
All institutions will use OPEN (Oncology Patient Enrollment Network) for registration of 
patients to CALGB [ZIP_CODE]. All institutions may access OPEN registration at 
https://open.ctsu.org. Alliance  and CTSU registrars will direct all requests for registration to 
CALGB [ADDRESS_1110641] 
the CTSU Help Desk ([PHONE_16777]). 
To be able to enroll a patient, institution staff must have:  
• A valid and active CTEP -IAM account 
This the same user ID and password used for the CTSU website (for more information, 
see https://www.ctsu.org/public/CTEP-IAM_Factsheet.pdf). 
• A ‘Registrar’ role on in the Alliance  or CTSU roster 
Assignment of the Alliance  ‘Registrar’ role is managed through the Alliance Protocol 
Operations Program Office via submission of a roster update form signed by [CONTACT_1268] [INVESTIGATOR_804597].  
Prior to accessing OPEN site staff should verify the following:  
• All eligibility criteria has been met within the protocol stated timeframes. Site staff 
should use the regi stration forms provided on the group or CTSU web site as a tool to 
verify eligibility.  
• All patients have signed an appropriate consent form and HIPAA authorization form (if 
applicable).  
Site and/or Data Administrators can manage the CTSU roster roles via the new Site Roles 
maintenance feature under RSS on the CTSU members’ website. This will allow them to assign staff the ‘Registrar’ role.  
A training video and user guide is available on the CTSU members’ website, under the “OPEN” 
tab and within the OPEN application. Although the OPEN system is user-friendly and has many help features built in, we strongly encourage users to view the training demo for a quick overview of how OPEN works. OPEN has a “Practice Mode” which allows the user to switch from a “worki ng” mode to practice mode to create registrations without updating live data. The 
user guide is also available to download and/or print as a reference tool. There are help icons 
within each of the OPEN screens to assist you with navigating the system.  
Note: The OPEN system will provide the site with a printable confirmation of registration and treatment information. Please print this confirmation for your records.  
Further instructional information is provided on the OPEN tab of the CTSU members’ side of 
the CTSU website at https://www.ctsu.org or at https://open.ctsu.org. For any additional 
questions contact [CONTACT_25518] [PHONE_031] or [EMAIL_013].  
5.[ADDRESS_1110642] be offered to all 
patients enrolled on CALGB [ZIP_CODE]. Although patient may opt not to participate, this substudy 
is strongly recommended for ALL patients.  
If a patient answers “yes” to “I agree that my specimen(s) may be used for the research described 
above” (Question #1) in the model consent, they have consented to participate in the embedded 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  25 Update #11  companion CALGB [ZIP_CODE]. Samples for CALGB [ZIP_CODE] should be submitted according to the 
instructions in Section 6.4 . The rationale for performing the correlative substudy is described in 
Section 6.4 . 
If a patient has also consented to the optional embedded companion study CALGB [ZIP_CODE], 
register the patient to CALGB [ZIP_CODE] within OPEN. Pre-registration to [ZIP_CODE] is not available.  
5.4 CALGB Registration to CALGB Companion Studies  
5.4.1  Registration to REQUIRED CALGB 8461  
Enrollment in CALGB 8461 (Cytogenetic Studies in Acute Leukemia) is required  for 
CALGB patients in order to achieve the scientific outcomes of this trial. Follow the 
instructions within CALGB 8461 for collection and submission of specimens (also see Section 6.5
). 
Patients who register to CALGB [ADDRESS_1110643] also register to CALGB 8461. Pre-registration 
to 8461 is no longer available.   
5.4.2  Registration to OPTIONAL CALGB 9665 (prior to February 28, 2014) 
Enrollment in the Leukemia Correlative Science Committee study CALGB 9665 (CALGB 
Leukemia Tissue Bank) is optional, but is strongly recommended for all Alliance  patients. 
Pre-registration to CALGB 9665 is available.  Follow the instructions within CALGB 9665 
for collection and submission of specimens (also see Section 6.5 ). 
If a patient has also consented to the optional companion study CALGB 9665, register the 
patient to CALGB 9665. Pre-registration to [ADDRESS_1110644] be registered on and 
baseline samples submitted per ECOG E3903, “Ancillary laboratory protocol for collecting 
diagnostic material on patients considered for ECOG treatment trials for leukemia or related 
hematologic disorders.” 
The baseline eligibility assessments which will be reported back to the site for CALGB 
[ZIP_CODE] include the results of the BCR/ABL status as determined by [CONTACT_956]. The 
assessments will be performed by [CONTACT_804667]-North Division.  
E3903 closed to new patient accrual on August 21, 2014. Therefore, after 8/21/14, ECOG-
ACRIN institutions may not consent or enroll patients on E3903. After 8/21/14, baseline 
eligibility as sessments are to be performed by a local CLIA laboratory as per protocol 
(Section 4.2
).

8.4 Course IV: CNS Prophylaxis Therapy 
Do not begin Course IV therapy until dasatinib has been interrupted for at least 7 days prior to 
administration of the day 1 IV methotrexate dose.  
It is recommended that patients be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_804615]-dose IV methotrexate administration for continuous IV hydration.  
The goal of this treatment course is to maintain serum methotrexate concentrations of >1 µM 
for 30 continuous hours during 3 treatments. It is recommended that IV vincristine be 
administered prior to the initiation of the IV methotrexate infusion. The IT methotrexate 
should be administered later in the day (at any time during the IV methotrexate infusion) to 
avoid any possible confusion between the IV vincristine and the IT methotrexate.  
All patients will continue cotrimoxazole DS one tablet PO BID 3 days per week until the 
completion of all therapy, or, if allergic to sulfonamides, inhaled aerosolized pentamidine (300 
mg once per month). Cotrimoxazole should be stopped 3 days before and resumed 3 days

be pre-hydrated with 500 mL - 1 liter of D 5W plus 100 mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate. 
Continue vigorous hydration as tolerated over the course of the day to maintain hydration and urine pH >6. Please check with pharmacy to ensure that patients are not receiving any 
medications (e.g., sulfonamides, salicylates, penicillins, other organic acids, proton pump 
inhibitors) that may interfere with methotrexate clearance.  
• It is strongly recommended that additional hydration (with NS or D
5W containing 100 
mEq/L of sodium bicarbonate per liter) be given on days 2, 16 and 30 when patient returns 
for IV leucovorin. If patients remain on PO leucovorin for a prolonged period of time 
because of slow methotrexate clearance, then the subsequent dose of methotrexate 
(scheduled on days IV -15 and IV -29) must be delayed, as necessary, to ensure that no

8.5 Course V 
This course includes three different options: allogeneic transplantation for patients ages 18-70 
with an HLA -matched donor (see Section 8.5.1 ); autologous transplantation for patients age 18-
70 without an HLA -matched donor or not a candidate for allogeneic transplantation (see Section 
8.5.2 ); and for patients age > 70, or who are not transplant candidates, or wi thout insurance 
coverage, an alternative chemotherapy regimen without transplantation (see Section 8.5.3 ). 
The treating physician should consult with the Study Chair regarding frail patients who may 
need to skip Course V and continue on to Course VI.  
8.5.1 Course V: Allogeneic Transplantation (for patients ages 18-70 with an HLA-matched 
donor)  
Discontinue dasatinib during Course V (Allogeneic Transplantation) until approximately day V -30. 
Patients must be treated at or referred to an Alliance -approved, ECOG-ACRIN-approved, 
SWOG -approved, or FACT -credentialed allogeneic transplant center to be eligible to 
receive this portion of the therapy. Course V therapy should begin no later than [ADDRESS_1110682] adequate organ function (renal, liver, cardiac, and pulmonary) to meet institutional requirements for allogeneic transplantation.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Donor Mobilization 
Any consenting healthy individual who fulfills the donor (FAHCT) criteria will be 
considered for peripheral blood stem cell mobilization and collection. Sibling donors 
must be matched at 6/6 or 5/6 HLA antigens (HLA A, B and DR). Unrelated donors will be matched for HLA A, B, C and DRB1 antigens by [CONTACT_804671]. Syngeneic donors are acceptable.  
• Mobilization of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells will be performed according to institutional guidelines. Peripheral blood stem cell collection should target an optimal CD34+ cell dose > 5 x 10
6 cells/kg (actual weight) with a 
maximum of 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. Stem cells may be collected at any time 
prior to transplant.  
• In instances where the cells harvested from the donor are <5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_841], the clinical investig ator may elect to collect a bone marrow backup 
product.

• G-CSF should continue daily until ANC > 1500/µL for 2 consecutive days or 5000/µL for 1 day. G-CSF can be restarted if the ANC falls to <  500/µL. 
• G-CSF doses should be rounded as follows: 300 mcg for patients ≤60 kg, 480 
mcg for weight 61-95 kg, 600 mcg if weight >95 kg. IV administration of 
each dose over 15-60 minutes is permissible if patient cannot tolerate 
subcutaneous injections.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Infectious Disease Prophylaxis 
• Antibacterial prophylaxis is required.  For example, levofloxacin 500 mg or 
gatifloxacin 400 mg orally or institutional equivalent until resolution of neutropenia. 
• Antifungal prophylaxis is required.  For example, posaconazole 200 mg three 
times daily orally or voriconazole 200 mg two times daily orally (or IV) or 
institutional equivalent until day +180. Azole antifungal agents should not be 
administered within 5 half lives of vincristine.  
• Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis is required.  For example, 
cotrimoxazole double-strength BID twice a week from engraftment until 1 year 
after transplantation.  
• CMV viremia monitoring and prophylaxis are required.  For example, 
cytomegalovirus (CMV) positive patients or those who had a CMV -seropositive 
donor can be given ganciclovir 5 mg/kg from day -8 until day -3, followed by 
[CONTACT_804672] 10 mg/kg every 8 hours IV/orally until discharge. Then continue 
acyclovir 800 mg orally three times a day will be continued until day 210. Alternatively, and based on institutional practice, patients can receive valacyclovir 2,000 mg four times daily from discharge until day +210. Patients 
who are CMV negative and had a CMV -negative donor can follow institutional 
guidelines.  
• Patients should be screened weekly for CMV viremia until day +120
 and treated 
with ganciclovir upon detection of CMV viremia.  
• Monitoring for EBV viremia by [CONTACT_804673] 100 days.  
• Antifungal, antiviral, and Pneumocystis prophylaxis and screening for CMV 
viremia should continue indefinitely for those with active GVHD or those 
receiving immunosuppressive treatment.  
• In institutions that do not provide CMV -negative blood products for CMV-
negative donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_91582], CMV -negative donor/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_804619].

SWOG -approved or FACT -credentialed autologous transplant center to be el igible to 
receive this portion of the therapy. Course V therapy should begin no later than [ADDRESS_1110687] adequate organ function (renal, liver, cardiac, and pulmonary) to meet institutional requirements for autologous transplantation.  
Discontinue dasatinib 24 hours prior to the initiation of Course V and restart after 
completion of stem cell collection (see Section [IP_ADDRESS]
). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Step I – Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Mobilization and Leukapheresis 
Patients will receive therapy as follows:  
1) Begin the etoposide continuous IV infusion at hour 0 (Hours 0 - 96, days 1-4); 
2) Start the high-dose ara-C (HiDAC) 2-hour IV infusion at hour 0 (every 12 hours x 8 doses on days 1-4); 
3) Start the G-CSF on day 14 at a dose of 10 mcg/kg/day SC. G-CSF must be continued until PBSC collection has been completed or WBC >50,000/µL.  
4) It is recommended that patients remain in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_804589].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Etoposide 
• In patients age ≤ 65 years,  etoposide 10 mg/kg/day (corrected weight) via 
continuous IV infusion over 96 hours (days 1-4). Total dose is 40 mg/kg.  
Corrected weight = ideal weight  (see Appendix I
) + 25% of the difference 
between ideal and actual weight. If actual weight is less than ideal, use actual 
weight rather than corrected weight.  
During etoposide infusion, other IV fluids should be kept to a minimum and blood products should not be given except in an emergency.  
• In patients age > 65 years,  etoposide 5 mg/kg/day (corrected weight) via 
continuous IV infusion over 96 hours (days 1-4). Total dose is 20 mg/kg.  
Corrected weight = ideal weight (see Appendix I
) + 25% of the difference 
between ideal and actual weight. If actual weight is less than ideal, use actual weight rather than corrected weight.  
During etoposide infusion, other IV fluids should be kept to a minimum and blood products should not be given except in an emergency.  
[IP_ADDRESS] HiDAC 
In patients ≤ 65 years of age: 
• Cytarabine 2000 mg/m2 in 250 mL D 5W IV over 2 hours every 12 hours x 8 doses 
(days 1-4). 
• Prior to each dose of cytarabine, evaluate for the presence of nystagmus or other signs of cerebellar dysfunction. (Assessments are more accurate if the patient has not recently, i.e., in approximately the last hour, been medicated wi th anti-
emetics.) If these symptoms are present, stop cytarabine and do not resume this drug. Corticosteroid eye drops should be used prophylactically. Please note dose 
modification in Section 9.6
. 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  44 Update #11  • Cytarabine doses should be given while the etoposide continuous infusion is 
running. 
• Actual body weight should be used in Body Surface Area (BSA) calculations for dosing. 
In patients > 65 years of age:  
• Cytarabine 1000 mg/m2 in 250 mL D 5W IV over 2 hours every 12 hours x 8 doses 
(days 1-4). 
• Prior to each dose of cytarabine, evaluate for the presence of nystagmus or other 
signs of cerebellar dysfunction. (Assessments are more accurate if the patient has not recently, i.e., in approximately the last hour, been medicated with anti-emetics.) If these symptoms are present, stop cytarabine and do not resume this 
drug. Corticosteroid eye drops should be used prophylactically. Please note dose 
modification in Section 9.6
. 
• Cytarabine doses should be given while the etoposide continuous infusion is running. 
• Actual body weight should be used in Body Surface Area (BSA) calculations for dosing. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Prophylactic Anti-Fungal, Anti-Bacterial Antibiotic and Anti-Viral Therapy 
Prophylactic anti -fungal and anti -bacterial antibiotic therapy beginning on day 5 of 
this regimen are required. An institutional equivalent, or any of the following 
commonly used regimens may be used: ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID, amoxicillin/clavulanate (Augmentin) 875 mg PO BID, acyclovir 400 mg PO BID, 
posaconazole 200 mg PO TID, fluconazole 200 BID or voriconazole 200 mg BID. Such therapy may be discontinued once the ANC is >500/µL, unless otherwise 
clinically indicated.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF)  
G-CSF 10 mcg/kg/day (total dose) subcutaneously in one or two divided doses 
starting on day 14. Continue until PBSC collection has been completed or WBC 
>50,000/µL. Do not skip or reduce dose for bone pain.  
G-CSF doses should be rounded to the nearest vial size. IV administration of each 
dose over 15-60 minutes is permissible if patient cannot tolerate subcutaneous 
injections. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Collection 
• Begin PBSC collections when the WBC >10,000/µL. This usually occurs about 
day 18 after starting HiDAC/etoposide. Waiting until the WBC >30,000/µL may 
increase the CD34+ yield.  
• Aim for a total of 1-5 collections with a goal of collecting ≥ 5 x 10
6 CD34+ 
cells/kg and not more than 10 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg. This would be an adequate 
collection even if the mononuclear (MNC) collection is <12 x 108/kg. In the 
absence of a reliable measurement of CD34+ cells, the MNC collection should be >12 x 10
8 cells/kg.  
• If the CD34+ collection on the first day of apheresis is poor, it is recommended 
to continue G-CSF,  delay apheresis 1-3 days, and resume once the WBC has 
increased to > 15,000-20,000/µL. 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  45 Update #11  • While 5 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg represents an acceptable minimum, infusion of a 
larger collection may improve engraftment. It is not recommended, however, to 
continue the leukapheresis for more than 5 aphereses in order to exceed the 
minimum required collection once that amount of PBSC has been collected.  
• If the CD34 collection is inadequate after [ADDRESS_1110688] then be redocumented after which an attempt may be made to remobilize PBSC using G-CSF at doses ≥ 10 µg/kg daily. Physician discretion is permitted at this juncture with respect to using higher G-CSF doses and allowing the use of GM-CSF. The remobilization attempt must take place no later than two weeks after bone marrow 
and peripheral blood criteria for CR have been documented.  
• Patients who cannot be mobilized following HiDAC/etoposide because of 
therapy-related complications may remain on study and receive autologous 
transplantation following mobilization at a later date using the methods outlined above. Bone marrow and peripheral blood criteria for CR must be met within two weeks of the mobilization.  
• Patients unable to undergo PSCT after HiDAC/etoposide may continue as 
outlined in Section 8.5.3
. 
• PBSC processing should occur per institutional criteria. Ex vivo “purging” procedures are not permitted.  
• An aliquot of each day’s stem cell collection (1 x 10
7 cells) must be sent for 
institutional Q-PCR.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Backup Bone Marrow Harvest - This is not a requirement if stem cell collection 
is adequate.  
• Total nucleated cell count collection should be >1 x 108/kg. 
• Cells will be processed as per institutional criteria.  
• An aliquot of each day’s stem cell collection (1 x 107 cells) must be sent for 
institutional Q-PCR.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Dasatinib  
Restart dasatinib at [ADDRESS_1110689] then be continued until  3 days prior to the autologous transplant.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Step II - Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant (PBSCT) 
• Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation should take place no earlier than [ADDRESS_1110690] dose of dasatinib in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS]
. 
• Patients must meet institutional criteria for PBSCT and have neither active infection nor need for ongoing antibiotics.  
• A bone marrow examination must be performed prior to autologous HCT to 
assess response. Patients must remain in complete remission as documented by [CONTACT_804659] < 5% blasts within [ADDRESS_1110691] be > 
500/µL and platelet count >  50,000/µL. Patients with falling blood counts should 
be observed to exclude relapse as the cause of the change. Perform institutional

relevant companion studies (CALGB 8461 [required]).  
[IP_ADDRESS] Melphalan 100 mg/m2/day (corrected weight) IV over 30 minutes on days -2 and -1. 
It is recommended that the patient be hydrated with normal saline (150 mL/hour) 
starting one hour prior to the melphalan dose and continuing for 24 hours after the melphalan dose. Diurese vigorously to keep at baseline weight.  
Corrected weight = ideal weight (see Appendix I
) + 25% of the difference between 
ideal and actual weight. If actual weight is less than ideal, use actual weight rather than corrected weight.  The corrected weight should then be used to calculate Body 
Surface Area (BSA) for dosing.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Autologous PBSC infusion on Day 0. Peripheral stem cells should be thawed in a 
37°C water bath and infused IV immediately without an in-line filter.  
[IP_ADDRESS] G-CSF 5 mcg/kg (actual body weight) subcutaneously daily starting on day 0 and 
continued daily until ANC >1500/µL for 2 days or >5000/µL for one day. G-CSF should be restarted if the ANC falls to <500/µL and continued until the ANC >5000/µL for two days.  
G-CSF doses should be rounded off to nearest vial sizes. IV administration of each dose over 15-60 minutes is permissible if patient can not tolerate subcutaneous 
injections. 
[IP_ADDRESS] On Day [ADDRESS_1110693]-transplant following Course V all patients will undergo a bone 
marrow examination.  Perform institutional Q-PCR on bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_804620]+[ADDRESS_1110694]-transplant.   
8.5.3 Course V: Alternative Chemotherapy Regimen without Transplantation (for those patients age > 70, those who are not candidates for any transplant, or those without 
insurance coverage) 
Patients who are age > 70, who are not candidates for transplantation, or those without 
insurance coverage should not  be removed from protocol therapy. Rather, they will receive 
an alternative chemotherapy regimen consisting of etoposide and high-dose ara-c.  
Dasatinib is to be discontinued until initiation of Course VI.  
Chemotherapy should begin no less than [ADDRESS_1110695] 
dose of dasatinib in Course IV.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Etoposide 
• In patients age ≤ 65 years, etoposide 10 mg/kg/day (corrected weight) via 
continuous IV infusion over 96 hours (days 1-4). Total dose is 40 mg/kg.  
Corrected weight = ideal weight (see Appendix I
) + 25% of the difference 
between ideal and actual weight. If actual weight is less than ideal, use actual 
weight rather than corrected weight.  
During etoposide infusion, other IV fluids should be kept to a minimum and blood 
products should not be given except in an emergency.  
• In patients age > 65 years, etoposide 5 mg/kg/day (corrected weight) via 
continuous IV infusion over 96 hours (days 1-4). Total dose is 20 mg/kg.

(Assessments are more accurate if the patient has not recently, i.e., in approximately the last hour, been medicated with anti -emetics.) If these 
symptoms are present, stop cytarabine and do not resume this drug. Corticosteroid eye drops should be used prophylactically. Cytarabine doses should be given while the etoposide conti nuous infusion is running . Actual body weight should be 
used in Body Surface Area (BSA) calculations for dosing.  
• In patients age > 65 years,  cytarabine 1000 mg/m
2 in 250 mL D 5W IV over 2 
hours every 12 hours x 8 doses (days 1-4). Prior to each cytarabine dose, evaluate

8.7 Treatment for CNS Leukemia 
CNS leukemia at time of entry on study or up to the beginning of Course III will only be treated 
if symptomatic. Give IT methotrexate 15 mg twice weekly (hydrocortisone 50 mg should be included with preservative free methotrexate) for at least 6 doses and until the CSF is clear. Begin cranial radiation therapy (see Section 8.9
) for symptomatic patients with CNS leukemia 
at time of entry (or promptly after day of CNS diagnosis for symptomatic patients diagnosed after entry into this protocol). Concurrent with cranial radiation therapy, continue weekly IT 
methotrexate (15 mg). Use minimal doses of leucovorin as necessary to prevent mucositis or severe myelosuppression. If CNS remission is achieved, then continue to give intrathecal 
methotrexate monthly for 12 months.  
8.8 CNS Leukemia Developi[INVESTIGATOR_804596] (CR or PR) While Receiving 
or Having Completed Protocol Therapy 
Continue protocol therapy for patients who experience CNS failure without marrow relapse. 
Give 15 mg IT methotrexate weekly or twice weekly until CNS is clear of leukemia cells and 
then monthly for 12 months. Give concurrent cranial radiation (see Section 8.9 ). These patients 
continue to receive protocol therapy until bone marrow relapse occurs. Consult with the Alliance 
Study Chair if CSF leukemia persists, regarding the use of intrathecal cytarabine.  
8.9 Cranial Radiation Therapy 
Cranial radiation therapy is intended only for patients with CNS leukemia at presentation, 
symptomatic CNS disease prior to beginning Course III, or for patients who develop symptoms 
of CNS disease during remission (as described in Sections 8.7 and 8.8). IMRT and proton RT 
will not be allowed on this study.  
8.9.1 Equipment  
Modality:  Co-60 or X-ray beams with a nominal energy between 4 and 6 MV.  
Calibration:  The calibrations of therapy units used in this protocol shall be verified by [CONTACT_217401].  
8.9.2 Target Volume 
The target volume consists of the entire brain and meninges, including the frontal lobe as 
well as the posterior halves of the globes of the eyes, with the optic disk and nerve superior 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  50 Update #11  to the vertex and posterior to the occiput. The caudal border shall be below the skull base at 
the C2 vertebral level (see discussion of field matching in Section 8.9.4 ). 
Localization:  The planning target volumes shall be defined by [CONTACT_3553] a simulator. 
8.9.3 Target Dose 
Prescription Point:  The prescription point in each target volume is at or near the center*. 
For multi -convergent beams, the prescription point is usually at the intersection of the beam 
axes.  
*Note: This follows the recommendati ons of ICRU Report 50. If your institution’s practice 
differs, a conversion may be necessary. For instance, if you prescribe to a certain isodose 
line, adjust this (departmental) prescription so that the (protocol) prescribed dose is given to 
the (protocol ) prescription point.  
Dose Definition: The absorbed dose is specified below in centigray (cGy)-to-water. 
Tissue Heterogeneity:  No corrections for bone attenuation shall be made. Institutions that 
customarily correct of heterogeneities must calculate monitor units or time of irradiation without this option.  
Prescribed dose and fractionation:  The total dose to the prescription point shall be 2400 
cGy in 12 fractions. The patient shall be treated with one fraction per day of 200 cGy.  
Dose Uniformity:  The dose variations in each target volume shall be within +7%, -5% of 
the prescription dose (In accordance with ICRU Report 50, small high-dose volumes can be excluded from the evaluation of the dose uniformity but not small low-dose volumes).  
Treatment Interruption s: No corrections shall be made for treatment interruptions less 
than seven days. For interruptions greater than seven days, please contact [CONTACT_804674]-chair. 
8.9.4 Treatment Technique  
Patient Position: The patient shall be treated in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
Beam Configuration: The cranial volume is treated with two lateral, equally weighted 
photon beams.  
Field Shapi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Field -shapi[INVESTIGATOR_804623] 5 HVL thick.  
Eye Protection:  A simple method to minimize lens irradiation, while irradiating the 
posterior halves of the eyes, is to let the central axes of the horizontal cranial beams go 
through both orbits. The anterior edges of the beams are defined by [CONTACT_804675] a point [ADDRESS_1110703]. It is acceptable to use a parallel -opposed beam-pair, without such angling, 
with shielding blocks that cover the anterior half of the proximal eye. The dose to the 
contralateral lens will then increase, however.  
8.9.5 Dose Calculations and Reporting 
Prescription Point: The monitor units or time or irradiation required to deliver the 
prescribed dose to the prescription points shall be calculated and submitted using the “RT -
1 Dosimetry Summary” form.  
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  51 Update #11  Dose Uniformity:  The maximum and minimum doses in the target volumes shall be 
calculated and reported on the RT -1 form. These may be extracted from isodose diagrams 
or calculated separately.  
Isodose Distributions:  For single beams (electrons or photons) and equally-weighted, 
parallel -opposed photon beams, isodose distributions are not required. In all other cases, a 
plot of the dose distribution in the central transverse plane through the target volume shall 
be submitted. The prescription point and the outlines of the target volume and critical organs shall be shown. Isodose values must be clearly labeled. The effects of shielding blocks shall 
be included.  
8.9.6 Cranial Radiation Therapy Definitions of Deviation of Performance 
Prescription Dose:  
• Minor Deviation:  The dose to the prescription point differs from that in the protocol 
by [INVESTIGATOR_82473] ±6% and ± 10%.  
• Major Deviation:  The dose to the prescription point differs from that in the protocol 
by [CONTACT_726] 10%.  
Dose Uniformity: 
• Minor Deviation:  The variation in dose in one target of the volumes exceeds +7%/-5%. 
8.10 Testicular Radiation: 2400 cGy in 12 Treatment Fractions 
Testicular disease at time of entry on study or during therapy without marrow relapse will be 
treated by [CONTACT_804676]. IMRT and proton RT will 
not be allowed on this study.  
8.10.1 Equipment:  
Modality:  High -energy photon electron beams. The selection of energy is determined by 
[CONTACT_183643],  and with electrons, the lowest possible energy should be used 
to spare tissues outside the target volume.  
Calibration:  The calibrations of therapy machines in this protocol shall be verified by [CONTACT_217401].  
8.10.2 Planning Target Volume: The planning target volume consists of the testes in the 
scrotal sac. Use margins of at least 1/2 cm.  
8.10.3 Target Dose 
Prescription Point:  The prescription point is at or near the center of the planning target 
volume. 
Note: This follows the recommendations of ICRU Report 50. If your institution’s practice 
differs, a conversion may be necessary. For instance, if you prescribe to a certain isodose line, adjust this (departmental) prescription so that the (protocol) prescribed dose is given to 
the (protocol) prescription point.  
Dose Definition: The absorbed dose is specified as centigray (cGy)-to-water. 
Prescribed Dose and Fractionation:  The total dose to the prescription point shall be 2400 
cGy in 12 fractions. The patient shall be treated with one fraction per day of 200 cGy.  
Dose Uniformity: The variations of dose within the planning target volume shall be within 
+7%, -5% of the dose prescription point (In accordance with ICRU Report 50, small high -
dose volumes can be excluded from the evaluation of the dose uniformity but not small low-
dose volumes). The uniformity requirement can in general be met with an electron beam of 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  52 Update #[ADDRESS_1110704] technique. Bolus may also 
be needed for photon beams to fulfill the dose uniformity requirement.  
Treatment Interruptions: No corrections shall be made for treatment interruptions less 
than seven days. For interruptions greater than seven days, please contact [CONTACT_804674]-chair. 
8.10.4 Treatment Technique  
Patient Position:  The patient shall be treated in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].

8.10.5 Normal Tissue Sparing and Dose Specification Points 
Perineum: The testes shall be supported posteriorly and, if possible, extended caudally in 
order to minimize perineal irradiation. The field shall not be angled towards the perineum.  
Penis: The penis shall be excluded from the field by [CONTACT_804677]. 
Dose Specification Points: To ensure dose uniformity specified in Section 8.10.3
, the dose 
at two points shall be calculated and submitted with the Quality Assurance Documentation.  
Point A:  0.5 cm from the anterior surface of the testes.  
Point B:  0.5 cm from the posterior surface of the testes.  
Note: Points A and B are defined with respect to the surface of the testis itself, and not the 
bolus material.  
8.10.6 Dose Calculations and Reporting 
Prescription Point:  The monitor units or time of irradiation required to deliver the 
prescribed dose to the prescription points shall be calculated and submitted using the “RT -
1 Dosimetry Summary” form.  
Dose Uniformity:  The maximum and minimum doses in the target volumes shall be 
calculated a nd reported on the “RT -1 Dosimetry Summary” form. These may be extracted 
from isodose diagrams or calculated separately.  
Dose Specification Points:  The daily dose to dose specification points shall be calculated 
and reported on the “RT -[ADDRESS_1110705].” 
8.10.7 Testicular Radiation Therapy Definitions of Deviation of Performance Prescription Dose:  
• Minor Deviation: The dose to the prescription point differs from that in the protocol by 
[INVESTIGATOR_82473] ±6% and ± 10%.  
• Major Deviation: The dose to the prescription point differs from that in the protocol 
by [CONTACT_726] 10%.  
Dose Uniformity:  
• Minor Deviation:  The variation in dose in one target of the volumes exceeds +7%/-5%. 
8.11 Quality Assurance Documentation  
8.11.1 Within one week of the completion of radiotherapy, the following data shall be 
submitted: 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  53 Update #11  • A copy of the patient’s radiotherapy record including prescription, and the daily and 
cumulative doses to the prescription point and specified dose points.  
• Documentation of the treatment field: This may consist of a photograph of the patient

presents the staging and grading system for acute GVHD.  
9.8.1 Acute GVHD 
• Indications for initial treatment of acute GVHD 
In general, treatment for GVHD should be started when grade [ADDRESS_1110729] 
been met (Appendix II ). Grade 2 GVHD is moderately severe disease and usually 
consists of multiorgan disease. The decision to treat is based on the clinical assessment 
of the patient’s condition, the onset time relative to the day of transplant, and the rapi[INVESTIGATOR_804627].  
• Agents to be used for initial treatment of acute GVHD 
Acute GVHD usually is treated with a corticosteroid-containing regimen.  
Methylprednisolone can be administered at a dose of at least 1 mg/kg body weight every 
[ADDRESS_1110730] treatment information on flow sheets.  
Patients may be eligible for other agents for the treatment of GVHD per institutional protocols. Salvage regimens may include antithymocyte globulin, anti -T-cell 
antibodies, or psoralen and ultraviolet A irradiation (PUVA).  
9.8.2 Chronic GVHD 
• Diagnosis of chronic GVHD 
Manifestations of chronic GVHD typi[INVESTIGATOR_804628]. The patients will be diagnosed with either limited or extensive chronic GVHD. Biopsies of the liver are recommended for patients who present with abnorma l 
liver function tests in the absence of overt involvement of the skin, eyes, or mouth. Endoscopy and biopsy are recommended to establish gut involvement.  
• Agents to be used for treatment of chronic GVHD 
Patients diagnosed with extensive chronic GVHD are often treated for 9-12 months with 
tacrolimus and prednisone but should be managed according to institutional protocols. 
Suggested dosages are prednisone 1 mg/kg/day given as an oral dose in the morning. Record treatment information on flow sheets.

Please refer to the package insert for a comprehensive list of adverse events.  
DRUG INTERACTIONS  
Cyclophosphamide undergoes metabolic activation via cytochrome P450 3A4 in the liver and may potentially interact with any drug affecting the same enzyme systems. Inhibitors of 3A4, e.g., itraconazole, could theoretically inhibit activation and inducers of 3A4, e.g., phenytoin, could theoretically enhance activation of cyclophosphamide to active alkylating species. For the 
most part, such interactions have not yet been documented clinically.

S
TORAGE & STABILITY  
Store the intact bottles at controlled room temperature (15°C-25°C) and protect from light. 
Excursions are permitted up to 30°C. Shelf life testing of the intact bottles is on-going.  
ADMINISTRATION  
Oral. The tablets may be taken with or without a meal. Tablets should not be crushed or cut; they should be swallowed whole. Please refer to the protocol text for dasatinib doses during each 
course of therapy. During the first month, subjects will be instructed to take dasatinib in the morning. Subsequently, subjects may adjust the time they take dasatinib as l ong as they take the 
drug approximately every 24 hours. If a scheduled dose is missed for more than 12 hours or 
dosing is interrupted for toxicity or for any other reason, these doses should be omitted.  
T
OXICITY  
Common adverse events with dasatinib are myelosuppression, bleeding events, fluid retention 
and QT prolongation. Treatment with dasatinib is associated with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia and anemia. Myelosuppression is managed by [CONTACT_267558], dose reduction, or discontinuation. Dasatinib can cause platelet dysfunction in vitro and thrombocytopenia in humans. Severe CNS hemorrhage, including fatalities occurred in 1% of patients. Severe GI hemorrhage occurred in 7% of patients and generally required treatment interruptions and transfusions. Other cases of severe hemorrhage occurred in 4% of patients. Most bleeding events were associated with severe thrombocytopenia. Fluid retention was severe in 9% of patients, 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  66 Update #11  including pleural and pericardial effusions reported in 5% and 1%, respectively. Severe ascites 
and generalized edema were each reported in 1%. Severe pulmonary edema was reported in 1% of patients. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of pleural effusion (dyspnea or dry cough) should be evaluated by [CONTACT_13190] x -ray. Severe pleural effusion may require oxygen therapy 
and thoracentesis. Fluid retention is typi[INVESTIGATOR_804629]. Dasatinib has the potential to prolong cardiac ventricular repolarization (QT interval). Dasatinib should be administered with caution in patients who have 
or may develop prolongation of QTc, including patients with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, 
or congenital long QT syndrome and patients taking anti -arrhythmic drugs or other medical 
products that lead to QT prolongation. Hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia should be corrected 
prior to dasatinib administration.  
In October 2011, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication describing the risk of 
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated with dasatinib. At least twelve cases of PAH have been confirmed by [CONTACT_137910] (normal pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_47469], but elevated pulmonary artery pressure) with dasatinb considered the most likely cause. The onset of PAH was variable, including the occurrence after more than one year of treatment. Symptoms of PAH include dyspnea, fatigue, hypoxia, and fluid retention. No fatalities were reported, and PAH may be reversible upon discontinuation of dasatinib. Because dasatinib is associated with other adverse events that can cause pulmonary symptoms, it is suggested that these other events (e.g., pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, anemia, lung infiltration) be ruled 
out prior to performing right heart catheterization.  
P
OTENTIAL DRUG INTER ACTIONS  
Potent CYP3A4 inducers and inhibitors are prohibited on CALGB [ZIP_CODE]. Dasatinib is primarily metabolized by [CONTACT_752806]3A4 enzyme.   
CYP3A4 substrates known to have a narrow therapeutic index should be administered with caution in patients receivi ng dasatinib.  
Systemic antacids (both H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) are prohibited on 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE].  
Dasatinib may prolong the QT/QTc interval. Use caution when administering dasatinib with 
other potential QTc-prolonging medications.  
Due to the possibility of CNS, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and cutaneous hemorrhage, avoid using medications that inhibit platelet function or anticoagulants with dasatinib.  
Long-term suppression of gastric acid secretion by [CONTACT_2363] H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors 
(e.g., famotidine and omeprazole) is likely to reduce dasatinib exposure. Therefore, concomitant use of H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib is not recommended. If antacid therapy is needed, the antacid dose should be administered at least [ADDRESS_1110741] undergone allogeneic transplant and are continuing to receive tacrolimus should be carefully monitored for a rise in tacrolimus levels and 
consequent toxicities, such as renal and hepatic toxicities, as well as myelosuppression.

AVAILABILITY  
Daunorubicin is commercially available (or available as required in non North American 
countries) as a powder for reconstitution in 20 mg vials, and in vials of solution at a concentration 
of 5 mg/mL in 20 mg vials. Please refer to the package insert for additional information.  
PREPARATION  
Reconstitute the 20 mg vial with 4 mL of sterile water for injection to attain a 5 mg/mL concentration. 
Storage & Stability 
Intact vials should be stored at room temperature. Reconstituted solutions are stable for [ADDRESS_1110742] common adverse reactions associated with daunorubicin include hematologic, 
gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are often dose-limitin g.  Daunorubicin causes nausea and vomiting, but is generally considered moderately emetogenic. Stomatitis is also common. Acute cardiovascular reactions include EKG abnormalities which 
are usually asymptomatic and self-limiting. Chronic cardiomyopathy manifests as congestive 
heart failure. Risk factors include age (> 70 years), mediastinal irradiation and cumulative 
lifetime dose (e.g., > 450 mg/m
2). Dermatologic reactions (alopecia, “radiation recall”) are also 
common.  
Less common are red/orange urine (more alarming than of notable consequence to patients) and 
skin “flare.” The flare consists of redness and itching along the distribution of the vessel through which daunorubicin was administered. It is usually self-limiting and of short duration, but should 
be distinguished from an extravasation reaction.  
Extravasation of daunorubicin does not occur very often, but can result in severe skin and tissue 
necrosis. Cold should be applied to the site of a suspected or actual extravasation of 
daunorubicin.

administration of the diluted solution be completed within 60 minutes of reconstitution. 
Reconstituted solutions should not be refrigerated.  
P
REPARATION  
Melphalan should be prepared immediately before intended use. Each vial is reconstituted with 
10 mL of the supplied diluent to yield a concentration of 5 mg/mL. The reconstituted solution may be diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL to 0.45 mg/mL. Alternatively, when the required concentration necessitates an unacceptable volume of fluid, the 
reconstituted solution may be administered undiluted.  
A
DMINISTRATION  
Melphalan will be administered IV in patients undergoing autologous transplant in Course V.  
TOXICITY  
The major toxicity of melphalan is bone marrow suppression, usually lasting four to eight weeks.

Version Date: 02/21/2017  75 Update #[ADDRESS_1110758] of the adverse event information described below comes from studies of tacrolimus in 
solid organ transplantation. In patients receiving tacrolimus, 5% to 47% experienced anemia, 8% to 32% experienced leukocytosis, and 14% to 24% experienced thrombocytopenia. Mild to moderate hypertension was reported in 38% to 50% of patients receiving tacrolimus. Chest pain 
was reported in 19%. Antihypertensive therapy may be required. The most common adverse 
effects of tacrolimus have involved the central nervous system, and include headache (37% to 64%), tremors (48% to 56%), insomnia (32% to 64%), paresthesia (17% to 40%); and dizziness (19%). Tremor and headache may respond to dosage reduction. Agitation, anxiety, confusion, seizures, depression, hallucinations, myoclonus, neuropathy, psychosis, incoordination, and abnormal dreams have been reported in 3% to 15% of tacrolimus-treated patients. Hyperkalemia (13% to 45%), hypokalemia (13% to 29%) hypophosphatemia (49%) and hypomagnesemia (16% to 48%) have been associated with tacrolimus therapy. In addition, hirsutism occurs only rarely with tacrolimus.  Gastrointestinal adverse effects of tacrolimus have included nausea (32% 
to 46%), vomiting (14% to 29%), anorexia (7% to 34%), constipation (23% to 35%) and diarrhea (37% to 72%). Nephrotoxicity was reported in 36% to 40% and 52% of liver and kidney transplant patients receiving tacrolimus. Overt nephrotoxicity is usually seen early after 
transplantation and is characterized by [CONTACT_225273] a decrease in urine 
output. Hematuria has been reported in greater than 3% of tacrolimus-treated patients. Abnormal 
liver function tests have been reported in 6% to 36% of patients; ascites was reported in 7-27% 
of these patients.  
Other miscellaneous effects that have occurred in clinical trials include pain (24% to 63%), fever 
(19% to 48%), back pain (17% to 30%), and peripheral edema (12% to 36%). The incidence of hyperglycemia is 17% and may require therapy with insulin. Other less frequently occurring effects (greater than 3%) include peritonitis, and photosensitivity reactions. Anaphylaxis has 
been reported in a few patients receiving intravenous tacrolimus.  
D
RUG INTERACTIONS  
Tacrolimus is metabolized by [CONTACT_9058] P450 3A4. Drugs that are inhibitors (e.g., 
itraconazole) or inducers (e.g., phenytoin) of 3A4 might increase or decrease tacrolimus 
concentrations respectively. This could result in increased or decreased effect of tacrolimus. 
Tacrolimus dose will be adjusted based on blood levels.  
11.0 A NCILLARY THERAPY  
Patients should receive full supportive care, including transfusions of blood and blood products, antibiotics, antiemetics, etc., when appropriate.  
Treatment with hormones (other than the required dexamethasone) or other chemotherapeutic agents 
may not be administered except for steroids given for adrenal failure; and hormones administered for 
non-disease-related conditions (e.g., insulin for diabetes).  
Palliative radiation therapy may not be administered except for whole-brain irradiation for 
documented CNS disease or testicular radiation for documented testicular involvement. Do not hold 
protocol chemotherapy during CNS irradiation.

Version Date: 02/21/2017  76 Update #11  11.1 Alliance Policy Concerning the Use of Growth Factors 
The following guidelines are applicable unless otherwise specified in the protocol.  
11.1.1  Epoetin (EPO) 
Use of epoetin (epoetin, darbepoetin, EPO) in this protocol is permissible but not 
recommended. A baseline serum Epo level should be measured first.  
11.1.2  Filgrastim (G-CSF), PEG-filgrastim, and sargramostim (GM-CSF)  
1. Filgrastim (G-CSF) or PEG-filgrastim should be used as indicated in Course V.  
2. For the treatment of febrile neutropenia the use of CSFs should not be routinely 
instituted as an adjunct to appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, the use of CSFs may be indicated in patients who have prognostic factors that are predictive of clinic al 
deterioration such as pneumonia, hypotension, multi -organ dysfunction (sepsis 
syndrome) or fungal infection, as per the ASCO guidelines. Investigators should therefore use their own discretion in using the CSFs in this setting. The use of CSF (PEG-filgr astim, filgrastim or sargramostim) must be documented and reported on flow 
sheets. 
3. When PEG-filgrastim, filgrastim or sargramostim are used, they must be obtained from 
commercial sources.

RITERIA FOR RESPONSE , PROGRESSION , AND RELAPSE [43] 
The assessment of response after treatment for acute leukemia requires a physical examination, 
complete blood count, platelet count, differential count, and bone marrow aspi[INVESTIGATOR_22602]. Extramedullary sites known to be involved by [CONTACT_804687] (e.g., mediastinal lymphadenopathy or CSF) must be reexamined as well. Immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], cytochemistry, and 
cytogenetic analyses are supportive data for clinical assessment.  
Investigators are cautioned that the bone marrow cytology and peripheral blood differential count in 
patients who are recovering from chemotherapy or who have received hematopoietic growth factors 
or cytokines may be shifted to immaturity, reflecting regenerating hematopoiesis; this should not be misinterpreted as residual or recurrent leukemia. Whenever the initial morphological result is ambiguous, a second bone marrow examination should be performed ≥ one week later, and confirmatory data should be gathered from cytogenetic analyses, immunophenotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007], or 
cytochemistry. 
12.1 Complete Remission (CR) 
A CR requires the following: an absolute neutrophil count (segs and bands) >1000/µL, no 
circulating blasts, platelets >100,000/µL; adequate bone marrow cellularity with trilineage hematopoiesis, and <5% marrow leukemia blast cells. All previous extramedullary manifestations of disease must be absent (e.g., lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, skin or gum 
infiltration, testicular masses, or CNS involvement).  
12.2 Complete Cytogenetic Remission (CCyR)  
No clonal abnormal metaphase cells in ≥ 20 bone marrow karyotypes.  
12.3 Complete Molecular Remission  
No evidence of BCR/ABL transcripts in a Q-PCR assay with a sensitivity of 1:1000 or greater, typi[INVESTIGATOR_804632].  
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  77 Update #11  12.4 Major Molecular Remission  
Ratio of BCR/ABL transcript to ABL transcript is ≤ 0.1% in a Q-PCR assay with a sensitivity 
of 1:1000 or greater, typi[INVESTIGATOR_804632].  
12.5 Complete Remission with Incomplete Recovery of Counts (CRi) CRi is identical to criteria for CR except for recovery of platelets <100,000/µL or recovery of 
ANC <1000/µL. Patients must be transfusion independent.  
12.6 Partial Remission (PR) 
A PR requires all of the CR criteria except that the marrow may still contain 5-25% leukemia 
blast cells. An absolute neutrophil count (segs and bands) > 1000/µL, no circulating blasts, and 
platelets > 100,000/µL are required as for a CR.

Patients who achieve complete remission (M 0, M 1) will continue on protocol therapy until the 
appearance of hematologic relapse as defined by [CONTACT_804688] (>5%) or in the CNS (positive cytospin examination of CSF) or in any other extramedullary site after a CR; or progression to >25% leukemia blasts cells in the marrow after a PR. Cytogenetics, FISH, or Q-PCR may be useful to identify recurrent 
Ph+ ALL cells.  
At the time of documented relapse, institutions should submit bone marrow or peripheral blood for institutional Q-PCR.  
13.3 Extraordinary Medical Circumstances:  
If, at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient’s health or the patient 
no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be discontinued. In this 
event: 
• Document the reason(s) for discontinuation of therapy in patient records.  
• Submit C-300 (Off Treatment Notice) and follow the data submission requirements, 
including submission of appropriate follow-up forms at time of relapse and death, as well 
as C-300, and C-113, as detailed in Sections 6.1 (Data Submission) and 7.0
 (Required Data).  
• Notify the Study Chair.  
• Continue to follow the patient for relapse, second malignancies, and survival endpoints.  
14.0 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
14.1 Statistical Objectives 
The primary objective of this study is the construction of a historical database to provide 
leukemia investigators relevant baseline data useful for the design of follow-up studies in this rare patient population. Consequently, the primary statistical objectives of this protocol primarily relate to estimation rather than inference. More specifically, the primary statistical 
objective of this study is the estimation of the disease-free survival (DFS) at the three-year 
CALGB [ZIP_CODE]/CTSU C10701 
Version Date: 02/21/2017  79 Update #11  landmark for the combined as well as each of the three individual patient cohorts.  Disease-free 
survival (DFS) is measured from the date of first induction CR to relapse, or death due to any cause, with patients last known to be alive and disease-free censored at the date of last contact.  
The analysis population will consist of all el igible patients who receive at least one dose of 
dasatinib. The manuscripts reporting the results will report the effect of excluding any patients 
on the results.  
A secondary clinical endpoint of this study is achievement of BCR-ABL negativity. The 
corresponding statistical endpoint of this study is the probability of being BCR-ABL negative in 
the bone marrow and peripheral blood in a CLIA -approved clinical laboratory at the completion 
of the CNS prophylaxis course (Course IV). Patients who discontinue the protocol-specified 
treatment before completing the CNS prophylaxis course on this study will be counted as non-
responders (i.e., be qualified as not having reached BCR-ABL negative status). Another 
secondary clinical endpoint of this study will be the feasibility of maintenance therapy in this 
patient population. This analysis will be restricted to those patients achieving CR. For both secondary endpoints, the proportions will be estimated based on the combined and individual 
cohorts. 
Other clinical endpoints of interest include overall survival, disease-free survival and response. 
All time -to-event distributions will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Proportions 
will be estimated using point as well as interval estimators. All interval estimators will be constructed using the finite sample size sampling distribution at the unadjusted two-sided level 
of 0.05.  
For each endpoint, whenever scientifically plausible, the cohorts may be compared in an 
exploratory fashion. To this end, a three sample log-rank test will be used for time-to-event 
profiles and a randomized test for contingency will be used for binary outcomes. These tests will 
be conducted at the unadjusted 0.[ADDRESS_1110761] up to 69 
(=33+36) months.

Operations Program Office and Alliance Statistics and Data Center. The first six patients will 
be monitored on a bi -weekly basis while the next six will be monitored on a monthly basis. 
Based on the results of the first interim analysis for feasibility and safety, we may decide to 
extend the teleconferences for the next 12 patients. These rules are primarily intended to help 
the study team to formally monitor the study from a safety and feasibility standpoint.

Alliance  will be the senior (last) author.  
The other members of the Writing Committee will be determined according to the level of participation in the study as measured by [CONTACT_804694]. The number of investigators on the Writing Committee from each of the participating cooperative groups (Allianc e , 
ECOG-ACRIN, and SWOG) will be based on the following accrual formula. Each Group enrolling 1-5% of the total number of patients accrued will nominate one member of the Writing Committee. Each group will be entitled to an additional member of the Writing Committee for each additional 10% of the overall accrual. For example, if a group enrolled 15% of the study patients, that group would have 2 co-authors on the Committee; if 25% of the study patients were enrolled, that group would have 3 co-authors. The Alliance  will be assigned additional members of the Writing 
Committee only after that group accrues >15% of the total study patients. It will be the responsibility of each cooperative group to name [CONTACT_804700]. By [CONTACT_115564], it is anticipated that the final Writing Committee will include approximately 8-10 of the clinical and/or laboratory investigators who have been most involved in 
the design, conduct, and analysis of this study.

DVERSE EVENT REPORTING (AER) 
Investigators are required by [CONTACT_804695]. This study will utilize the Common Terminology Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
Version 4.0 to determine the severity of the reaction for adverse event reporting. All reactions determined to be “reportable” in an expedited manner must be reported using the CTEP Adverse 
Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS). Reporting of cases of secondary AML/MDS/ALL is to be 
performed using CTEP-AERS. New primary malignancies should be reported using Study Form C-
1001. 
Expedited AE reporting for this study must use CTEP-AERS , accessed via the CTEP Web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov).  The reporting procedures to be followed are presented in the “NCI 
Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for DCTD (CTEP and CIP) and DCP INDs and IDEs” which can be downloaded from the CTEP Web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
These requirements are briefly outlined in the tables below.  
In the rare occurrence when Internet connectivity is lost, a 24-hour notification is to be made to CTEP 
by [CONTACT_1381] [PHONE_101].   Once Internet connectivity is restored, the 24-hour notification 
phoned in must be entered electronically into CTEP-AERS by [CONTACT_433].

registration on all reports.  
16.2 Additional Instructions or Exclusion to CTEP -AERS Exped ited Reporting Requirements 
for Phase 2 and 3 Trials Utilizing an Agent Under a CTEP IND or non-CTEP IND:  
• CALGB [ZIP_CODE] is conducted under a CTEP -held IND for dasatinib. Therefore, the reporting 
requirements for investigational agents under a CTEP -held IND should be followed for all 
enrolled patients.  
• All adverse events reported via CTEP-AERS (i.e., serious adverse events) should also be 
forwarded to your local IRB.  
• A discussion of adverse events associated with agents used in this trial can be found in 
Section 10.0  (Drug Formulation, Availabilit y, and Preparation). For the purposes of 
expedited adverse event reporting, the CAEPR for dasatinib may be found in Section 16.3 . 
Note: that the ASAEL column of the CAEPR has been replaced with the specific protocol exceptions to expedited reporting (SPEER) list. This list now includes “expected” severity 
grades in addition to event terms.”

16.[ADDRESS_1110774] (CAEPR) for Dasatinib (BMS -
354825, NSC 732517) 
The Comprehensive Adverse Events and Potential Risks list (CAEPR) provides a single list of 
reported and/or potential adverse events (AE) associated with an agent using a uniform 
presentation of events by [CONTACT_6764]. In addition to the comprehensive list, a subset, the Specific Protocol Exceptions to Expedited Reporting (SPEER), appears in a separate column and is identified with bold and italicized text. This subset of AEs (SPEER) is a list of events that are protocol specific exceptions to expedited reporting to NCI (except as noted below).  Refer to the 'CTEP, NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements' http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/aeguidelines.pdf  for 
further clarification.  Frequency is provided based on 2937 patients. Below is the CAEPR for 
Dasatinib (BMS -354825, Sprycel).  
NOTE : Report AEs on the SPEER ONLY IF  they exceed the grade noted in parentheses next 
to the AE in the SPEER.  If this CAEPR is part of a combination protocol using multiple investigational agents and has an AE listed on different SPEERs, use the lower of the grades to 
determine if expedited reporting is required.

the ‘substrate’. When (Study Agent)   is co-administered with compounds classified as ‘inhibitors’, increased plasma 
concentrat ions of (Study Agent)  is the potential outcome. The co-administration of ‘inducers’ would potentially lower plasma

Course IV Drug Administration Schedule 
 
After Course III if there is no evidence of persistent leukemia in your bone marrow, that is, your bone marrow shows a remission from leukemia, you will receive a course of treatment, referred to as “Course IV” to try to further prevent recurrence of your leukemia. This treatment is specifically designed to decrease the risk of leukemia recurring in the brain and spi[INVESTIGATOR_1831] (the central nervous system), known sites of recurrence in patients with your disease. After you have recovered sufficiently from Course III the following chemotherapy drugs will be given during the next month of therapy:  The following is meant to serve as a schedule of when chemotherapy drugs are to be given during Course IV. 
 
 For Example  Actual Date & Time:  Instructions  
Day 1  Monday at 9 AM:  Vincristine in clinic.  
 Monday at 9 AM-12 
PM:  Intravenous (IV) Methotrex ate in clinic. 
During IV Methotrexate, Intrathecal 
Methotrexate will be given in clinic.  
 Monday at 3 PM:  Begin Oral Methotrexate.  
 Monday at 9 PM:  Oral Methotrexate at home.  
Day 2  Tuesday at 3 AM:  Oral Methotrexate at home.  
 Tuesday at 9 AM:  Oral Methotrexate at home.  
 Tuesday at 3 PM:  Return to clinic for blood sample.  
Intravenous Leucovorin in clinic.  
Day 3  Wednesday at 3 AM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
 Wednesday at 9 AM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
 Wednesday at 3 PM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
 Wednesday at 9 PM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
Day 4  Thursday at 3 AM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
 Thursday at 9 AM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
 Thursday at 3 PM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
 Thursday at 9 PM:  Oral Leucovorin at home.  
 Thursday:   Return  to clinic for blood sample at any 
time during the day on Thursday. Oral 
Leucovorin will be stopped depending on 
results of blood sample.  
 
In addition to the drugs discussed above, an oral antibiotic, known as Bactrim® will be taken. One 
Bactrim tablet wi ll be taken twice daily for three days every week to prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia. If 
you are allergic to this medication, a different antibiotic (pentamidine) can be prescribed.  
 
Bactrim should be stopped 3 days before and resumed 3 days after each dose of methotrexate.

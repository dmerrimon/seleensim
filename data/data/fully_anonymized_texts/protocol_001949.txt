Study Number: TAK -390MR -1001 Phase: 1
Study Design:
This is a phase 1, randomized, open -label, single -center, single -dose, 2 -part, 2-wa y crossover bioavailability (BA) 
study to compare the BA of 30 or 60 mg dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured at [COMPANY_005] GmbH Plant Oranienburg 
(TOB) to the corresponding 30 or 60mg dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured at [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceutical Company 
Ltd. (TPC) plant in Osaka, Japan. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, 52 healthy  subjects will receive 
dexlansoprazole 30 mg capsules manufactured by [CONTACT_437608] a crossover fashion. In Part 2, an additional 
52healthy  subjects will receive dexlansoprazole 60 mg capsules manufactured by [CONTACT_437608] a crossover 
fashion. Due to the difference between the Granules -L used in the 30 mg (Granules -LL) and 60 mg (Gr anules -LS) 
capsules, the relative BA of both dosage strengths will be assessed. If bioequivalence (BE) is not achieved with the 
first TOB formulation, the study may be repeated for one or both dose strengths in new subjects who will receive the 
same TOB fo rmulatio n or a different TOB formulation. The same study design will be used if additional formulation 
assessments are needed.
Subjects who satisfy the Screening evaluation and selection criteria may be enrolled in the study. For each part, 
eligible subjec ts will be randomized on Day 1 of Period 1 in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 sequences, which defines the order in 
which they will receive dexlansoprazole regimens in Periods 1 and 2. The dosing between Periods will be separated by 
a minimum 5 -day washout interval. During Periods 1 and 2, blood samples will be collected over 24 hours postdose to 
measure dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations. The treatment sequences are outlined in the following tables for 
Part1 and for Part 2.

each part, blood samples will be collected over 24 hou rs postdose to measure dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations.
A blood sample for pharmacogenomics (PGx) will also be collected on Day 1 of Period 1 of each part. The 
cytochrome P -450 (CYP)2C19 isozyme is a polymorphic enzyme that is involved in the metabol ism of 
dexlansoprazole. A genotype test for CYP2C19 will determine the subject’s metabolizer status.
Subjects will be discharged from the study site on Day 2 of each period (subjects will exit the study on Day 2 of 
Period 2 within each part), and the dosin g between periods within each part will be separated by a minimum 5 -day 
washout interval.
A follow -up phone call will be made 10 (±2) days post last dose of study drug to inquire for any ongoing adverse 
events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs), new AE s or SAEs, and concomitant medications taken since final 
dose. Subjects who withdraw their consent will still be contact[CONTACT_5365] a safety follow -up call. The contact [CONTACT_768020] (eCRFs) , according to data protection

Main Criteria for Inclusion:
Healthy  men and women aged 18 to 55 years old, inclusive, with a body mass index between 18 and 30 kg/m2, 
inclusive, who are capable of understanding and complying with protocol requirements. Subjects must be in good 
health as determined by a physician based upon medical histor y, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), and physical 
examination. Subjects must have clinical chemistry, hematology, and complete urinalysis (after fasting for at least 
8hours) at Screening and Check -in (Day -1 of Period 1) results within the reference range for the testing laboratory 
unless the out -of-range results are deemed not clinic ally significant by [CONTACT_093]. Subjects must sign a w ritten 
informed consent form (ICF) prior to initiation of study procedures.
Main Criteria for Exclusion:
The subject has a history of significant gastrointestinal (GI) disorders manifested with persistent, chronic or 
intermittent nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or has a current or recent (within 6 months) GI disease that would influence 
the absorption of drugs (eg, a history of malabsorption, severe esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease or erosive

CONFIDENTIALMain Criteria for Evaluation and Analyses:
Primary Endpoints
The primary endpoints for this study are the following plasma PK parameters of dexlansoprazole derived on Day 1 of 
each period:
Maximum observed concentration (C max).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time [ADDRESS_1053155] quantifiable concentration (AUC last).
Area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC∞).
Additional Endpoints
In addition, the following plasma PK parameters for dexlansoprazole: time to first occurrence of C max(tmax), terminal 
disposition phase half -life (t 1/2z), terminal disposition phase rate constant (λ z), apparent clearance after extravascular 
administration (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution during the terminal disposition phase after extravascular 
administration (V z/F).
Safety Endpoints
Safety will be assessed by [CONTACT_437610], clinical laboratory values, physical examinations, 
ECGs, and vital signs.
Statistical Considerations:
For each regimen of each part, dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations and PK parameter estimates will be tabulated 
and descriptive statistics computed.
For each part, analysis of variance (AN OVA) will be performed on natural logarithms of dexlansoprazole C maxand 
area under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) with factors for sequence, subject nested within sequence, 
period, and regimen. The factor of the subject nested within sequence w ill be the erro r term for testing the sequence 
effect. Other factors will be tested with the residual as the error term. For the relative BA determination, pairwise 
comparisons will be performed to assess the relative BA of dexlansoprazole via point estima tes and 90% confidence 
intervals (CI) for the ratio of C maxand AUC central values of the dexlansoprazole [ADDRESS_1053156] regimen (dexlansoprazole capsule -TOB) and the reference regimen (dexlansoprazole 
capsule -TPC) will be reached if the 90% CIs for C maxand AUC are within the (0.80 –1.25) interval. 
Statistical analyses of other plasma PK parameters will be performed, if appropriate.
Sample Size Justification:
For each part, a sample size of 52 (26 per sequence) will be used in this study. This sample size will allow for up to 
6dropouts (11.5% dropout rate) and provide 90% probability of concluding equivalence on dexlansoprazole C max
between the 2 regimens if the true difference between dexlansoprazole C maxcentral values from 2 regimens is no more 
than 5%. The power for concluding equivalence on dexlansoprazole AUC between 2 regimens would be over 90%. 
This sample size was based on the intrasubject variance of 0.075 for log(C max) and 0.024 for log(AUC) from the 
TAK -390MR_107 study.
If BE is not achieved with the first TOB formulation assessed, the study may be repeated for one or both dose strengths
in new subjects who will receive the same TOB formulation or a different TOB formulation. The same study design 
will be used if additional formulation assessments are needed.

CONFIDENTIAL4.0 INTRODUCTION
4.1 Background
Dexlansoprazole is a proton -pump inhibitor (PPI) with prolonged elevat ion of intragastric pH. 
PPIs inhibit th e secretion of H+ions in the stomach by  [CONTACT_437611] (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme 
(proton pum p) at the secretory  surface of the gastric parietal cell [1]. Dexl ansoprazol e is the 
R-enantio mer of the racemate lansoprazole. Lansoprazole, init ially approved in [LOCATION_009] in 1990, is 
currently marketed in over 90 countries and has a well- established safet y profile. 
[COMPANY_005] Development Center Americas, Inc. (TDC Americas) d eveloped dexlansoprazole 
delayed -release capsules (also referred to as dexlansoprazole modified- release capsules) as a new 
therapy  for treating acid -related di sorders including symptomat ic non -erosive gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD), erosive esophag itis(EE), and maintenance of healed EE and relief o f 
heartburn. Dexlansoprazole capsules are approved for use in adults ( ≥18years of age) and 
adolescents (12 to 17 years of age) in over [ADDRESS_1053160] approved for use in adults in the United 
States (US) in January 2009. The internat ional birth date (IBD) is [ADDRESS_1053161] ive levels of drug over a longer period of time, resulting in pro longed 
elevation of intragastric p H. 
The pharmacokinet ic (PK), pharmacodynamic, efficacy, and safet y profiles of dexlansoprazole 
capsules fo llowing administrati on of  dexlansoprazol e 30, 60, and [ADDRESS_1053162], and the maintenance of healed EE. Currently, dexlansoprazole granules (Granules -LL and 
Granules -H for 30 m g and Granules -LS and Gra nules -H for 60 m g) are manufactured and 
encapsulated into capsule product at [COMPANY_005] Pharmaceut ical Com pany, Ltd. (TPC) located in 
Osaka, Japan.
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study
The rati onale for conducting this study  is to qualify an addit ional production site ([COMPANY_005] GmbH 
Plant Orani enburg [TOB]) for the manufacture of dexlansoprazole capsules by [CONTACT_437612] (BE) of dexlansoprazole 30 and 60 mg capsules manuf actured by  [CONTACT_437613] 30 and 60 mg capsules manufactured by [CONTACT_437614] .

Study No. TAK -390MR -[ADDRESS_1053165] crossover 
study  in healt hy subjects to assess the BA of 30 or 60 mg dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured 
at TOB relat ive to the corresponding 30 or 60 mg dexlansoprazole capsules manufactured at TPC. 
The study  will be conducted in 2 parts. In Part 1, 52 healthy subjects will receive dexlansoprazole 
30mg capsules manufactured by  [CONTACT_437608] a crossover fashio n. In Part 2, an addit ional 
52healt hy subjects will receive d exlansoprazole 60 mg capsules manufactured by  [CONTACT_768022] a crossover fashio n. Due to the difference between the Granules -L used in the 30 mg 
(Granules -LL) and 60 mg (Granules -LS) capsules, the relat ive BA of both dosage strengths will be 
assessed. If BE is not achieved wit h the first TOB formulat ion, the study  may be repeated for one 
or both dose strengths in new subjects who will receive the same TOB formulat ion or a different 
TOB form ulation. The same study  design will  be used if addit ional form ulation assessments are 
needed.
At Check -in (Day -1 of Period 1), approximately 104 subjects in total (52 in Part 1, 52 in Part 2), 
including both men and women, aged [ADDRESS_1053166] ion criteria may be enrolled in the 
study . For each part, eligible subjects will be randomized on Day 1 o f Per iod 1 in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 
2 sequences, which defines the order in which they will receive dexlansoprazole reg imens in 
Periods 1 and 2. The dosing between periods will be separated by  a minimum  5-day washout 
interval . During Peri ods 1 and 2, bl ood sam ples will  be collected over 24 hours postdose to 
measure dexlansoprazole plasma concentrations.

9.1.5 Vital Sign Procedure
Vital signs will include oral body temperature, sitting blood pressure (resting 5 minutes), and pulse 
(beats per minute). Only  blood pressure and pulse will be taken on Check -in (Day -1) through 
Day 2. Vi tal signs will be obtained at the time points stipulated in Schedule of Study  Procedures 
(Appendix A). 
When vital signs are scheduled at the same t ime as blood draws, the blood draw will take priorit y 
and vital signs will be obtained wit hin 0.[ADDRESS_1053214] igator. Use of conco mitant 
medicat ions will not be allowed during the study  unless deemed necessary  in cases of medical 
emergency or approved by  [CONTACT_142921] a case -by-case basis. Occasio nal use o f acetaminophen 
(up to 2 g/day) is allowed. Acetam inophen is not allowed on Day  [ADDRESS_1053215] has been on a stable dose for a minimu m

agree to hold the research informat ion and any results in confidence.
The sample will be labeled with a unique sample ident ifier similar to labeling in the main study but 
using a code that is differ ent from the code attached to the health information and other clinical test 
resul ts collected in the study . The sample and data are linked to personal health informat ion with 
code numbers; the samples are stripped of all personal identifying information b ut a key  linking 
the sam ples to clinical analysis data exists. This link means that the subject may  be identified but

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory  finding), symptom, or disease temporally  associ ated wi th the use of a drug whether or 
not it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1053240] finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre- exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ingcondi tions underlying disease should not be considered PTEs or AEs).
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnostic procedure.
Requi re discontinuation or a change in dose of study medicat ion or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by [CONTACT_4168]. 
PTEs/AEs caused by a study procedure (eg, a bruise after blood draw) should be recorded as a 
PTE/AE.
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single  diagnos is. Acco mpanying signs (including 
abnorm al laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be recorded as 
additional AEs. If  a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be recorded 
appropriately  as a PTE(s) or as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory values or ECG parameters are only considered to be PTEs or AEs if the y 
are judged to be clinically significant (ie, if some action or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ondthe range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  re-test and/or continued monitoring o f an abnormal value are not considered an

CONFIDENTIALintervent ion. In addit ion, repeated or addit ional noninvasive testing for verificat ion, evaluatio n 
or monitoring of a n abnormalit y is not considered an intervent ion.
If abnormal laboratory values or ECG findings are the result of pathology for which there is an 
overall diagnosis (eg, increased creat inine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriat ely as a PTE or as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as PTEs or AEs. Baseline 
evaluat ions (eg, l aboratory  tests, ECG, X -rays, etc.) should NOT be recorded as PTEs unless 
related to study  procedures. However, if the subject experiences a worsening or complication 
of such a concurrent condit ion, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded 
appropriately  as a PT E (worsening or complicat ion occurs before start of study medicat ion) or 
an AE (worsening or complicat ion occurs after start of study medicat ion). Investigators should 
ensure that the event term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening
of…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing epi[INVESTIGATOR_45283] (eg, asthma, epi[INVESTIGATOR_002]) any occurrence of an 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_45284] a PTE/AE if the epi[INVESTIGATOR_45285], serious or 
severe in nature, that is, invest igators should ensure that the AE term  recorded captures the 
change in the condit ion from Baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent condition (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid arthritis), 
worsening of the condit ion shoul d only  be captured as a PTE/AE if occu rring to a greater 
extent to that which would be expected. Again, investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of PTEs or AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complica tion of a PTE after starting administration of 
the study  medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded appropriately as an 
AE. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion 
(eg, “worsening of…”).
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
medicat ion, the worsening or complicat ion should be recorded as a new AE. Investigators 
shoul d ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening 
of…”).
Changes in severit y of AEs /Seri ous PTEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit y of an AE/seri ous PTE, the event should be 
captured once with the maximum severit y recorded.
Dexlansopra zole Delayed -Release Capsules
Study No. TAK -390MR -[ADDRESS_1053241] anned surgeries or procedures:
Prepl anned proced ures (surgeries or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) that were scheduled prior to signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered PTEs or AEs. However, if a preplanned procedure is 
perform ed early  (eg, as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre -exist ing condit ion, the 
worseni ng of the condit ion should be captured appropriately as a PTE or an AE. Complicat ions 
resul ting fro m any planned surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as PTEs or AEs, but should be documented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any  medicati on wi thout m anifes ted si de effects are NOT considered 
PTEs or AEs, but instead will be documented on an Overdose page of the eCRF. Any 
manifested side effects will be considered PTEs or AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of 
the eCRF.
10.1.[ADDRESS_1053242] m edical occurrence that at any  dose:
1.Results in DEATH.

Mild: The e vent is transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423].
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s usual activities.
Severe: The event causes considerable interference with the subject’s usual activities.
10.1.6 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  medicati on(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing 
categori es:
Related: An AE that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of a drug (including the 
course after withdrawal of the drug), or for whi ch possible involvement of the drug cannot be

10.1.11 Action Concerning Study Medication 
Drug withd rawn –a study  medicat ion is stopped due to the particular AE.
Dose not changed –the particular AE did not require stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a study  medicat ion.
Unknown –only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been taken.
Not Applicable –a study  medicati on was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE, 
eg,the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  medicat ion was already 
stopped before the onset of the AE.
Dose reduced –the dose was reduced due to the part icular AE.
Dose interrupted –the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE.
10.1.12 Outcome
Recovered/Resolved –subject returned to first assessment status with respect to the AE/PTE.
Recovering/Reso lving –the intensit y is lowered by  [CONTACT_45332] m ore stages: the diagnosis or 
signs/symptom s have alm ost disappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved, but has 
not returned to the normal range or to Baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE/PTE with the condit ion rem aining “recovering/r esolving”.
Not recovered/not resolved –there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the di agnosis, signs/symptoms or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the observed

10.2 Procedures
10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs
[IP_ADDRESS] PTEs and AEs Collection Period
Collect ion of PTEs will co mmence from the time the subject signs the informed consent to 
participate in the study  and cont inue until the subject i s first administered study  medicat ion 
(Day 1) or until screen failure. For subjects who discontinue prior to study  medicat ion 
administration, PTEs are collected unt il the subject discont inues study participation.
Collect ion of AEs will co mmenc e from the time that the subject is first administered study  
medicat ion (Day 1). Routine collection of AEs will continue until [ADDRESS_1053244] dose of study  drug.
[IP_ADDRESS] PTEs and AEs Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subjective AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurri ng at any  other time during the study . Subjects experi encing a 
serious PTE m ust be monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or there is a sat isfactory  expl anati on for the change. 
Nonserious PTEs, related or unrelated to the study  procedure, need not be fo llowed-up for the 
purposes of the protocol.
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study medicat ion 
or not, m ust b e monitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to Baseline or until there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the 
changes observed. All PTEs and AEs will be documented in the PTE/AE page of the e CRF, 
whether or not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The

13.1 Statistic al and Analytical Plans
A stati stical analysis plan (SAP) will be prepared and finalized prior to database lock. This 
docum ent will provi de further details regarding the definit ion of analysis variables and analysis 
methodol ogy to address all study  objecti ves.
A targeted data review will be conducted prior to database lock. This review will assess the 
accuracy  and completeness of the study  database, subject evaluabilit y, and appropri ateness of the 
planned statistical methods.
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
Safety Set: All subjects who enroll into the study  and take at l east 1 dose of study  drug will be 
included in the safet y set.
PK Set: All subjects in the safet y set who have at least [ADDRESS_1053256] ics (number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviat ion and range) will 
be generated for continuous variables (eg, age, weight, and BMI) and the number and percentage 
of subjects wi thin each category  will be presented for categorical variables (eg, gender, race, and 
ethnicit y).
13.1.[ADDRESS_1053257] ics co mputed.
For each part, analysis o f variance (ANOVA) will be performed on natural logarithms of 
dexlansoprazole C maxandAUC with factors for sequence, the subject nested within sequence, 
period and regimen. The factor of the subject nested within sequence will be the error term for 
testing the sequence effect. Other factors will be tested with the residual as the error term . For the 
relative BA determinat ion, pai rwise com parisons will be performed to assess the relat ive BA of 
dexlansoprazole via po int estimates and 90% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of C maxand 
AUC central values of the dexlansoprazole [ADDRESS_1053258] regimen (dexlansoprazole capsule -
TOB) and the reference regimen (dexlansoprazole ca psule -TPC) will be reached if the 90% CIs 
for C maxand AUC are within the (0.80 -1.25) interval . 
Statistical analyses of other plasma PK parameters will be performed if appropriate.

summarized by  [CONTACT_768025]. Criteria for markedly abnormal laborato ry 
and vital sign values (markedly  abnorm al values [MAVs]) will be presented and the number and 
percentage of subjects with at least [ADDRESS_1053260] resul t will also be 
summarized by  [INVESTIGATOR_24858].
Shift tables for character ECG results will be provided overall to tabulate the number and 
percentage of subjects who changed status after dosing. 
13.2 Interim Analysis and Criteria for Early Termination
No interim analysis is planned.
13.3 Determination of Sample Size
For each part, a sample size of 52 (26 per sequence) will be used in this study. This sample size will 
allow for up to 6 dropouts (11.5% dropout rate) and provide 90% probabilit y of concluding 
equivalence on dexlansoprazole C maxbetween the 2 regimens if the true difference between 
dexlansopraz ole C maxcentral  values from 2 regimens is no more than 5%. The power for 
concl uding equivalence on dexlansoprazole AUC between 2 regimens would be over 90%. This 
sample size was based on the intrasubject variance of 0.075 for log(C max) and 0.024 for log(A UC) 
from the TAK -390MR_107 study .
If BE is not achieved with the first TOB formulat ion assessed, the study  may be repeated in new 
subjects who will receive the same TOB formulat ion or a different TOB formulation. The same 
study  design will  be utilized if addi tional formulation assessments are needed.

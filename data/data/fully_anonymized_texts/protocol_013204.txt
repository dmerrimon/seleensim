Title:  A Single -center Phase IIa Study Evaluating the Safety and Tolerability of Umbralisib  and Ibrutinib in Patients with 
Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B -cell Lymphoma: A Trial of the Lymphoma Precision Medicine Laboratory  
 
Lymphomagenesis is known to be  a result of a berrant signaling through the B -cell receptor (BCR ).  Several models 
have highlighted specific checkpoints that appear to be regulators of downstream signal propagation leading to 
abnormal  nuclear  transcription within the lymphocyte  leading t o either anti -apoptosis or a proliferative advantage.  A 
better understanding of the BCR signaling pathway in malignant lymphocytes has led to several small molecule 
inhibitors entering  clinical practice as single agents  for the treatment of non -Hodgkin ly mphoma (NHL) .  Two classes 
of BCR antagonists have shown strong activity in (NHL):  Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and phosphoinositide -3-
kinase (PI3-K) delta inhibitors.  Ibrutinib  is a first generation selective  and irreversible inhibitor of BTK.   umbralisib 
(formerly known as TGR -1202)  is a PI3 -K delta inhibitor with a novel structure unlike other PI3K inhibitor s affording 
once daily dosing and to date a unique toxicity profile.  Attacking the aberrant BCR signaling pathway at separate 
nodes may be  an important mechanism to overcome chemorefractory NHL.  This is a single -center Phase IIa study 
evaluating the safety and tolerab ility of umbralisib  and Ibrutinib in patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B -
cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We plan to a ccrue 24 patients .  The primary endpoint in this phase IIa study is to consecutively 
monitor the safety  and tolerability of the oral doublet and allow a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of this novel 
combination to provide background for an appropria tely powered phase II or phase III study.  There will be 3 treatment 
groups given one year (12 months) of therapy, Group A (consented to optional biopsies; 6 patients):  umbralisib 800 
mg PO daily on Days 1 -8; then umbralisib  800 mg oral daily and Ibrutinib  560 mg oral daily; Group B (consented to 
optional biopsies; 6 patients): Ibrutinib 560 mg PO daily Days 1 -8; then umbralisib  800 mg PO daily and Ibrutinib 560 
mg PO daily; and Group C (deferred consent to optional biopsies or consented to optional biopsie s; 12 patients): 
umbralisib  800 mg PO daily and Ibrutinib 560 mg PO daily.   Secondary endpoints of the trial will be assessment of the 
overall response rate (ORR) defined as the sum of complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR) and to 
determine the progres sion-free survival (P FS), time to response (TTR), and duration of response (DOR) in patients 
with rel apsed or refractory  DLBCL.

Duration of therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment should continue unless one of the following 
criteria applies:  
• Disease progression or inter -current illness that prevents further treatment,  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or changes in the pa tient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
• One year of therapy  
A cycle is [ADDRESS_202247] efficacy assessment 
should be ap proximately 8 weeks after Cycle 1/Day 1 (+/ - 7 days).  Thereafter e fficacy assessment will occur 
approximately every two months until 6 months then every 3 months until completion of 12 months of treatment (+/ - 7 
days) .  After Month 12, efficacy assessment s should occur at the investigators discretion.

2.1 Diffuse Large B -cell Lymphoma  
Diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLCBL) remains the most common non -Hodgkin lymphoma  (NHL)  diagnosed per 
annum  with an increasing prevalence , now noted to be approximately 500,000 individuals  
(http://seer.cancer.gov/stat/facts/html/leuks.html). Nearly 40% of  those individuals are older than [ADDRESS_202249] common c ombination chemo -immunotherapy is R-CHOP  (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin, vincristine,  prednisone) , which now cures nearly two -thirds of patients .(1) The prognosis is dependent on 
many patient sp ecific factors most accurately defined by [CONTACT_172808] (IPI) and by [CONTACT_172809] s defined as molecular subtypi[INVESTIGATOR_172769] B -cells (GCB) or Activated B -cell 
like (ABC) .(2, 3)     In the current treatment era the overwhelming majority of patients will be exposed to a rituximab  
containing induction regimen.  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_172770] -third of patient s with DLBCL will have 
refractory  disease  or experience a  relapse  of DLBCL.  A  second chance a t cure is maintained with second line therapy 
in addition to high dose therapy and autologous stem cell rescue  (HDT -ASCR)  in those who are transplant eligible .  
However, only 1 in 4 patients  who undergo transplant will  achieve long -term disease control and subsequent 
chemotherapy regimens yield diminishing returns and often serve as a bridge towards allogeneic transplantation i f 
eligible and/or available. (4)  Patient s who are not considered transplant eligible suffer a dismal prognosis with no

UNMC IRB# 345-[ADDRESS_202250] is a complex network of enzymatic checks and balances that regulate B -cell maturation 
and subsequent migration. (5)  Many points of divergence exist within the netw ork creating parallel streams of potential 
reflexive regu lation.  Tonic stimulation of an enzymatic node by [CONTACT_172810] a lymphoma 
generating event.  This has been further expounded by [CONTACT_172811].  The results h ave led to the 
defining of [ADDRESS_202251] plays a significant role : 1) Ge rminal 
Center B -cell (GCB), 2) Ac tivated B -cell like (ABC), and 3) U nclassifiable. (3)  The GCB subtype is felt to be more 
attracted to the phosphoinositol -[ADDRESS_202252]. (6) The ABC subtype of DLBCL appears to be addic ted towards the 
downstream pathway leading towards the Nfk -B stimulation and subs equent nuclear transcription. (7)  The GCB 
subtype  of DLBCL represents nearly two -thirds of all DLBCL cases and has a more favorable prognosis than ABC 
DLBCL.  These  downstream pathway s have  become clinicall y relevant  target s with several drugs attempting to inhibit 
these  process es.   
 2.[ADDRESS_202253] has brought 
upon a n exciting paradigm shift in the management of B-cell NHL.  Several novel non -chemotherapeutic drugs now 
attack the malignant lymphocytes via mechanisms unperturbed or selected for by [CONTACT_172812] -selective chemotherapy  or 
exposure to CD20 directed monoclonal a ntibodies  (Figure 1) .  Currently these drugs  are in the clinic as single agents  
or com bined with a CD20 monoclonal antibod y.  This 
include s but not limited to  the Bruton’s tyr osine kinase 
(BTK) inhibitor ib rutinib and the PI3-K inhibitor, Idelalisib.  
Both BTK and PI3 -K have several next generation 
antagonist s in clinical development.  Umbralisib  is a next 
generation PI3 -K delta inhibitor with a novel structure 
different than other PI3 -K inhibitor s in development.  This 
structure may lead to differential activity and toxicity profile 
than previously seen in other PI3 -K inhibitors.  Current data 
supports that BTK inhibitor s may provide selective activity 
towards the ABC subtype of DLBCL whereas PI3 -K 
inhibitors may provide selective activity to the GCB 
subtype of DLBCL. (8) 
 
Currently t argeted agents against the BCR have been 
primarily explored a s single agents or in combin ation with 
a CD20 monoclonal antibody.  Results have shown that as 
a single agent each  may be potent enough to achieve disease control in indolent NHL, like follicular lymphoma  (FL) 
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) .(9)  However, treatment o f 
relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) DLBCL especially after HDT -ASCR or in transplant ineligible patients remains a difficult 
situation with a poor overall prognosis.  Combinations of novel agents that do not have cumulative toxicities are likely 
needed to over come the clonal complexity and aggressive biology that prevents durability in the rel/ref DLBCL.  The 
novel  chemo -free oral combination  of umbralisib  and Ibrutinib  may be an attractive combination for the treatment of 
this difficult to treat population.   
2.[ADDRESS_202254].  As drugs progress through phases of clinical trials i t is well 
established dogma that a maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  is the objective in phase I studies.  However, this only reports

 dose limiting toxicities  (DLT)  during the initial cycle of therapy when f urther cumulative toxicities may be seen in 
subsequent cycles that limits the utility of a regimen.  Therefore, in paradigms were long -term safety and tolerability is 
paramount and needed to balance with objective responses phase IIa studies can be employe d to not only provide this 
tolerability signal but inform future studies that lead to appropriately powered and better informed phase II or phase III 
studies.   Therefore, we must balance efficacy while limiting cumulative toxicities  events (CTE) .  
 
2.1 Umbrali sib 
Umbralisib  (formerly known as TGR -1202 ) is a highly specific and orally available PI3K delta inhibitor with  high 
selectivity over the alpha, beta, and gamma isoforms  of PI3K .  The delta isoform of PI3K is highly expressed in cells of 
hematopoietic orig in, and strongly upregulated, and often mutated in NHL.  Umbralisib  has demonstrated safety in an 
ongoing Phase I clinical trial in patients with NHL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) .(10)  umbralisib  is 
manufactured by [CONTACT_172813], Inc.

2.1.4 Clinical development  of TGR 1202 in hematologic malignancies  
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Umbralisib  monotherapy  
 
Umbralisib  is being evaluated in multiple studies.  The first in human phase  I dose -escalation study  with expansi on 
cohorts in  rel/ref  hematologic  malignancies  patients has accrued  approximately [ADDRESS_202255] was 
reduced through a microniz ation process. The  micronization process resulted  in greater absorption (approximately 3 
fold in a 24 patient healthy volunteer bioequivalence study).  
 
In this study a dverse events  (AEs)  have been manageable, with Grade 3/4 AEs occurring in >10% of patients consisting 
of the following (March 2015 ) regardless of attribution to  umbralisib :  neutropenia, rash, dyspnea, thrombocytopenia, 
and diarrhea.  Of note, a  Grade 3 AE of rash was reported in a patient in the  non-micronized  800 mg dose cohort who 
was on concomitant antibiotics .  This patient had a history of antibiotic related rash .  All medications were held until the 
rash resolved and  they were  re-challenged at the 80 0 mg dose of umbralisib  with no recurrence of rash.  However, t his 
event met the criteria for a DLT as stated in the protocol and subsequently 3 additional patients were treated at the 800 
mg dose, with no additional DLT’s reported.

UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
  
On this study the s afety data has now been obtained on patients dosed with umbralisib  daily for over a year with no 
safety concerns recognized or reported as documented by [CONTACT_172814] 1200 mg QD  dose .  Dosing continues in  this study using the micronized formulation of umbralisib .   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Umbralisib  + anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, ublituximab  
 
Umbralisib  continues to be evaluated in the phase 1/1b dose escalation study with the glycoengineered anti -CD20 
monoclo nal antibody ublituximab (UTX). (10)  Fifty-seven  patients have been enrolled and  are evaluable for safety.  
AEs (AE; all causality) include: Day [ADDRESS_202256] occurred in the NHL cohort.  A poss ible dose -
response relationship has been observed between “lower” and “higher” umbralisib  doses.   A higher dose was defined 
as greater than 800 mg of the non -micronized umbralisib .  To date, 89% of pts (16/18) in the “high” dose cohorts remain 
on study pro gression free compared to 57% (8/14) in the “low” dose cohorts.  This study continues to enroll in expansion 
cohorts in NHL subtypes with umbralisib  at a micronized dose of 800 and 1200 mg  plus UTX.  
 
 
2.2 Ibrutinib  
Ibrutinib  is indicated for the treatment of: 1) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 2) patients with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion; 3) patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at 
least one prior therapy (acceler ated approval was granted for this indication based on overall response rate, 
continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials; 4) 
patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM).  5) Chronic gra ft versus host disease (cGVHD) after failure of 
one or more lines of systemic therapy.  Ibrutinib is not approved in the disease state being studied here.  
 
2.2.1 Chemical structure and description of Ibrutinib  
Ibrutinib is 1 -[(3R) -3-[4-amino -3-(4-phenoxyphenyl) -1H-pyrazolo[3,4 -d] pyrimidin -1-yl]-1-pi[INVESTIGATOR_33214]] -2-propen -1-one 
and has a molecular weight of 440.50 g/mole (anhydrous basis).   Ibrutinib is a white to off -white crystalline solid. It has 
a single chiral center and is the  R-enantiomer. Th e investigational drug product, ibrutinib, is an oral formulation 
containing micronized ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib  is manufactured by [CONTACT_14190], Inc. and is being supplied by [CONTACT_172815], LLC . 
      
       2.2.[ADDRESS_202257] shown that ibrutinib binds covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys -481) in the BTK active site, leading 
to potent and irreversible inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity .(12) In cellular signal transduction assays with a B -cell 
lymphoma cell line, ibrutinib inhib ited autophosphorylation of both BT K and phosphorylation of BTK’s physiological 
substrate, phospholipase -C gamma (PLCγ) .22   In DLBCL cell lines ibrutinib i nhibited the proliferation at a median  
effective concentration of 1 to  2 nM. (13) 
 
2.2.3 Pharmacology/ Toxicology  
 
Ibrutinib’s bioavailability is relatively low and quite variable.  A mass -balance study (PCI -32765CLL1004) demonstrated 
that ibrutinib 140 mg (admixed with 14C -ibrutinib) showed approximately 90% of radioactive ibrutinib was excreted 
within 168 hours after  administration, with less than 10% accounted for in urine and the remainder in feces. A negligible 
fraction was excreted as unchanged drug.   
 
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver.  In a hepatic impairment study, data showed an increase in ibrutinib expo sure. 
Following single dose administration, the AUC of ibrutinib increased 2.7 -, 8.2- and 9.8 -fold in subjects with mild (Child  
                      Page 10 of 65            
 
 
 
UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
 -Pugh class A), moderate (Child -Pugh class B), and severe (Child -Pugh class C) hepatic impairment compared to 
subjects with norm al liver function. The safety of ibrutinib has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment.  
Monitor patients for signs of ibrutinib toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed. It is not  
recommended to administer ibrutinib to patients with moderate or severe hepatic  impairment (Child -Pugh classes B 
and C).  
 
Ibrutinib is  metabolized primarily by [CONTACT_097]3A.  Drug-drug interaction study has demonstrated th at when  ibrutinib was 
administered at a [ADDRESS_202258] 
concentration quantifiable (AUCO -last) was extended up to 29 times longer than without ketoconazole exposure.  
Termina l half -life was not increased. Therefore , use of strong CYP3A inhibitors is not allowed and g uidance on 
concomitant use of ibrutinib with  other  CYP3A inhibitors or inducers is provided  in the Appendix  A. 
 
Absorption   
Ibrutinib is absorbed after oral administration with a median Tmax of 1 to 2 hou rs. Ibrutinib exposure increases with 
doses up to 840 mg. The steady -state AUC (mean ± standard deviation) observed in patients at 560 mg is 953 ± 705 
ng⋅h/mL and in patients at 420 mg is 680 ± 517 ng ⋅h/mL. Administration with food increased ibrutinib Cmax and AUC 
by [CONTACT_3450] 2 to 4 - and 2 -fold, respectively, compared with administration of ibrutinib after overnight fasting.  
 Distribution  
Reversible binding of ibrutinib to human plasma protein in vitro was 97.3% with no concentration dep endence in the 
range of 50 to 1000 ng/mL. The volume of distribution at steady state (Vd,ss) was 683 L, and the apparent volume of 
distribution at steady state (Vd,ss/F) was approximately [ZIP_CODE] L.  
Metabolism   
Metabolism is the main route of elimination fo r ibrutinib. It is metabolized to several metabolites primarily by 
[CONTACT_9058] P450, CYP3A, and to a minoextent by [CONTACT_097]2D6. The active metabolite, PCI -[ZIP_CODE], is a dihydrodiol 
metabolite with inhibitory activity towards BTK approximately 15 times lower than t hat of ibrutinib. The range of the 
mean metabolite to parent ratio for PCI -[ZIP_CODE] at steady -state is 1 to 2.8  
 
Ibrutinib binds covalently and irreversibly to Cys -481 near the BTK active site and inhibits the enzymatic activity with a 
half maximal inhibitory  concentration (IC50) of 0.5 nM.  The binding site of Bruton's tyrosine kinase remained fully

(≥ 175mg/day for average weight of 70kg . Although ibrutinib is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_172772], once daily dosing with ibrutinib is adequate to sustain maximal  pharmacodynamic activity for [ADDRESS_202259]-dosing.  Therefore, 560 mg/day is adequate to achieve exposures yi elding full BTK active -site occupancy in most 
patients . 
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_202260] ed in a phase I , multicenter, open -label, dose escalation study in patients with  recurrent NHL. (14) The 
objectives included studying the safety profile of ibrutinib, identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal 
dosing schedule, and characterizing efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics. A minimum of 6 subjects per 
cohort received 1 of 5 escalating dose levels of ibrutinib between 1.25 and 12.5 mg/kg for 28 consecutive days in a 35 -
day cycle.  There was a pre -specified objective of escalating 3 dose levels above that which achieved full BTK 
occupancy based on the fluorescent probe ass ay.  
 
A total of 66 patients were evaluated in this study.  Two additional cohorts received a continuous ibrutinib dose of 8.3 
mg/kg without a [ADDRESS_202261] and a fixed continuous dose of 560 mg/day.   Full BTK occu pancy was achieved with doses 
≥2.5 mg/kg/day.   A dose of  12.5 mg/kg/day was the highest dose cohort evaluated. There were 2 dose -limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) (Grade 2 neutropenia [2.5 mg/kg/day] and Grade 3 hy persensitivity [8.3 mg/kg/day]) in separate cohorts . The 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  of ibrut inib in subjects with B -cell malignancies was not established in this study.  Five 
of 15 subjects with DLBCL (33%) achieved objective responses, 2 CRs and 3 partial responses (PRs). The median

 time on treatment was 8 weeks (range: 2 to 98 weeks). Median PF S was 2.5 months (range: 0.7 to 4.6 months) and 
the median follow -up time was 3.5 months (range: 0.8 to 22.5 months).  
 
A subsequent phase  I/II, multicenter, open -label, and single -arm stu dy in subjects with rel/ref  DLBCL  was performed . 
(15)In order to determine whethe r ibrutinib had subtype specificity subjects enrolled were  retrospectively analyzed  into 
cohorts by [CONTACT_130334], either  activated B -cell like ( ABC) versus germinal B -cell like ( GCB ).  Subtype analysis was 
performed by [CONTACT_25071] (GEP) .  In this study a ll subjects received a starting dose of ibrutinib  at 560 
mg/day.  The objectives of this study included  the determining the safety of this dosing regimen and an assessment of  
efficacy of ibrutinib in DLBCL. Eighty  subjects were enrolled  and evaluable for response.  T he overall resp onse rate 
(ORR) was 25% (20/80  subjects). In the ABC subtype, ORR was  37% (14/38  subjects ; Only 1 PR (  5%) was observed 
in the  20 patients retrospectively determined to be of GCB subtypes . Thus, while the 2 subgroups were retrospectively 
assigned , ibrutinib  may be less active  in rel/ref DLBCL, GCB subtype.  
 
The most common adverse reactions (>=25%) in pts with B cell malignancies (MCL, CLL, WM) were 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, diarrhea, anemia, fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, bruising, nausea, upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_172773].  
 
2.3 Rationale for combination of Umbralisib  and Ibrutinib  
B-cell l ymphomagenesis is known to be  a result of aberrant signaling through the B -cell receptor (BCR).  Several 
models have highlighted specific checkpoints that appear to be regulators of downstream signal propagation leading 
to abnormal nuclear transcription within the lymphocyte leading to either anti -apoptosi s or a p roliferative advantage. (5)  
A better understanding of the BCR signaling pathway has led to sever al small molecule inhibitors entering  clinical 
practice as single agents.  As described above , umbralisib  and ibrutinib  have shown safety and activity in DLBCL .  Also 
important is the significant lack of evidence for cumulative toxicity as single agents to  date.  For umbralisib  it has been 
postulated that the  novel structure unlike other PI3K inhibitors has led to its lack of a significant toxicity profile  making 
it a pairable novel oral agent .  
 
.  We 
propose that a ttacking the aberrant BCR signaling pathway at separate nodes may 
be an important mechanism to overcome the chemorefractory DLBCL  regardless 
of cell of origin.   
Alterations in s ingle agent safety profiles can arise after an esta blished MTD and 
often lessen the enthusiasm for such novel combinations and again question the 
durability of a continuous  use paradigm.  Nevertheless, combinations of oral novel -
novel agents continue to emerge. (16)  However, an example of unforeseen 
toxicities was highlighted in a recent report  with lenalidomide, idelalisib (PI3 -K 
inhibitor) , and rituximab in patients with relapsed/refr actory CLL and i ndolent 
NHL. (17)  A sepsis -like syndrome was reported in 4 patients and  resulted in 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_172774] a maximal tolerated dose 
(MTD).   
It is well established dogma that a MTD is the objective in phase I studies.  
However, this only reports dose limiting toxicities during the initial cycle of therapy 
when furthe r cumulative toxicities may be seen in subsequent cycles that limits the 
utility of a regimen.  Therefore, in paradigms were long -term safety and tolerability is paramount and furthermore 
needed to balance with objective responses , a phase IIa study  can be  employed to not only provide this tolerability 
signal  or cumulative toxicity events (CTEs),  but be inform ative for  future studies that lead to appropriately powered and 
better informed phase II or phase III studies.

UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
 As discussed  above the  phase I/Ib study  (NCT # 02006485 ) with ublituximab and umbralisib  in rel/ref CLL and NHL  
continues to accrue.  An amendment to this protocol allowed for the addition of ibrutinib at 560 mg daily to UTX (fixed 
at 900 mg ) in addition to increasing doses of umbralisib .  To da te, safety data on umbralisib  is notable for no epi[INVESTIGATOR_172775] w ith umbralisib  as a single agent or in combination with ublituximab (doublet), or with ibrutinib 
(triplet) .(10, 16, 18)   In the 12 rel/ref DLBCL patients treate d with umbralisib  and UTX  whom were eligible for response 
5 patients had obtained a response and two had a PET/CT confirmed  complete response s.   Sixteen patients  have 
been enrolled into  the triplet regimen without a DLT in the NHL cohorts.  The [ADDRESS_202262] been seen in multiple  NHL subtypes.   
Given the safety of the umbralisib  as a single agent, in the doublet and the triplet cohorts in combination with the early 
efficacy signal reported we propose to further explore the safety and toler ability of an all oral regimen of ibrutinib and 
umbralisib  in patients with rel/ref DLBCL who have relapsed post -transplant or have been determined to be ineligible 
or unsuitable for transplant at the full doses of umbralisib  (800 mg) and Ibrutinib (560 mg ) in a single center open label 
phase IIa study.

      5.2.1 Guidelines  for Administration of umbralisib  
• Method of Administration: Umbralisib  4 tablets each  200mg = 800mg will be administered orally once daily. 
Umbralisib  should be taken in the morning .  (NOTE : After cycle [ADDRESS_202274] the option to take umbralisib  and Ibrutinib dosing together at the same time of day) . 
• Umbralisib  tablets should be  swallowed whole with a full glass (approximately 8  ounces) of water.  umbralisib  
tablets should NOT be crushed  or chewed.   
• Potential Drug Interactions :  No Drug Interact ions have been reported to date.  
• Pre-medications:  None  
Umbralisib  will be self -administered (by [CONTACT_102]).  Tablets should be taken at approximately the same time each 
morning with food.   Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole and s hould not chew or crush them.  
If a dose of umbralisib  is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If a dose  is missed,  it should 
not be replaced.  If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose.  Study  drug compliance 
should be reviewed with the patient at the beginning of each new treatment cycle.  Missed doses should be 
documented.  (Appendix  F “Oral, Sublingual, and/or Buccal Route Medication Adherence Standard Procedure (V 1.0 
11-25-2013)”  
 
      5.2.2 Guidelines for Administration of Ibrutinib  
• Method of Administration: Ibrutinib  4 capsules each  140mg  = 560mg  will be administered orally once daily . 
Ibrutinib should be taken in the evening. (NOTE:  After cycle [ADDRESS_202275] the option to take umbralisib  and Ibrutinib dosing together at the same time of day) . 
• Ibrutinib capsu les should be swallowed whole with a full glass (approximately 8  ounces) of water. Ibrutinib 
capsules should not be opened, chewed or dissolved.   
• Potential Drug Interactions :   Avoid co -administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider 
alternative agents with less CYP3A inhibition. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors which would be 
taken chronically (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, saquinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone) is not 
recommended. For short -term use (treatment for 7 days or less) of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., antifungals 
                      Page 17 of 65            
 
 
 
UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
 and anti biotics) consider interrupting ibrutinib  therapy until the CYP3A inhibitor is no longer needed [see Drug 
Interactions (7.1)]. Reduce ibrutinib dose to [ADDRESS_202276] be used (e.g., 
fluconazole, darunavir, erythromycin, diltiazem, atazanavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], amprenavir, fosamprevir, crizotinib, 
imatinib, verapamil, and ciprofloxacin) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Patients taking concomitant strong  or 
moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be monitored more closely for signs of ibrutinib  toxicity.  
• Also avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A and 
can alter ibrutinib pharmacokinetics.  
• For patients  with mild liver impairment (Child -Pugh class A), the recommended dose is 140 mg daily (one 
capsule). Avoid the use of ibrutinib in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh 
classes B and C) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]  
• Pre-medications:  None  
Ibrutinib will be self -administered (by [CONTACT_102]).  Capsules  should be taken at approximately the same time each 
evening with  food.  Patients should be instructed to swallow the capsules  whole and should not chew , break  or crush 
them.  If a scheduled dose  of Ibrutinib  is missed  it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day  with a return 
to the normal schedule the following d ay.  Extra capsules of ibrutinib should not be taken to make up for the missed 
dose . If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited dose.  Study drug compliance should be 
reviewed with the patient at the beginning of each new treatment  cycle.  Missed doses should be documented.

5.3 Supportive  medications and procedures  
 
The following treatments are prohibited while on clinical trial:  other investigational drug treatments or study 
participation, radiation therapy (except as described in section 3.2 Exclusion Criteria #1 ), hormonal therapy for cancer, 
cancer immunotherapy or other biologic therapy excluding trial drugs.  
• No glucocorticoids may be administered outside of protocol requirements for premedication or AE 
management, except low doses of steroids stabilized at < [ADDRESS_202277] support, antibiotic 
treatment, and treatment of other newly diagnose d or concurrent medical conditions. All blood products and supportive 
care concomitant medications such as antidiarrheals , analgesics, and/or antiemetics received from the first day of study 
treatment administration until 30 days after the final dose will be recorded in the medical records . 
Neutropenia:  Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G -CSF; filgrastim or pegfilgrastim) may be used during the course 
of the study at the investigator discretion.  The drug(s) should be used at a dose/schedule specified in the package 
insert.   
Antiemetics:  Umbralisib  and ibrutinib are considered to be of low emetogenic potential that may be adequately 
prevented with prochlorperazine.  Other antiemetics may be used at the discretion of the treating physician if nausea 
and/or vomiting is not adequately controlled/preven ted. Appropriate anti -emetic regimens should be based on the 
recommendations made by [CONTACT_44584] (SOC).

discretion.   
Blood Product Support:  Blood products should be utilized as clinically warranted and following institutional policies and 
recommendations.  
5.4 Duration of therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment should continue unless one of the following 
criteria applies:  
• Disease progression or inter -current illness that prevents further treatment . 
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
• One year of therapy  
5.5 Follow -up Evaluations Course Assessment Schedule  
A cycle is 28 days of treatment with any oral agent regardless of group assignment.  Response assessment will be 
done after cycles 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 (+/- 7 days).  After Month 12, efficacy ass essments should occur  at the investigator s 
discretion.  
We will continue to routinely monitor safety in regards to serious adverse events as well as for toxicity trends that may 
be of concern.  
The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed must be documented in the Case Report Form.  
Patients who discontinue therapy due to an adverse event should be followed until disease progression.  
5. 6 Toxicity  Assessments and Dose modifications  
5.6.1  Definitions of Cumulative Toxicity Event  (CTE ) 
For this protocol, cumulative toxicity event (CTE)  will be defined as follows: an adverse event attributed (definitely, 
probably or possibly related) to the study tre atment and meeting following c riteria within cycles 1 to 4 . AE grading and 
assignment of attribution require documentation by [CONTACT_172825].  
 
Toxicity  Definition  
Hematologic  Either:  
1. Grade 4 hematologic toxicities (attributed to either or both drugs) defined as:  
b. Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25 K/µL)  
c. Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5)  
2. Grade 3 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that results in a > 7 day delay in either 
drug.  
Non-hematologic  Either:  
1. ≥ Grade 3 as per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 3* 
(attributed to either or both study drugs).  
2. One week or greater delay in initiating any cycle da y 1 due to continued drug -
related toxicity.  
 
*Grade 3 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea with maximal supportive treatment(s) will be considered a CTE . Fatigue Grade 
>/= 3 considered to be due to treatment (definitely, probably, or possibly related) will be considered a CTE. 
 
Patients should be assessed clinically for toxicity at each visit using the NCI CTCAE v4.0 3 
(http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE ) grading scale.  The study will be terminated if a cumulative toxicity event 
(CTE) occurs in: ≥2/first 4; ≥4/first 8; or if more than [ADDRESS_202278] (24th) evaluable  patient   has completed

 cycle 4.  If a patient has progression of disease or is removed from study not related to a CTE after completion of 2 
cycles but less than 4 cycles the patients safety evaluation will be included, but noted appropriately.  If the patient 
receives less than 2 cycles than the patient will not be included and noted, but will not be replaced.  
 
Dosing will occur only if a patient’s clinical assessment and laboratory test values are acceptable.   
Dose modification and or intervention with supportiv e care recommendations for umbralisib , and ibrutinib are provided 
below, however final discretion lies with the treating investigator in regards to more or less aggressive intervention, 
which specific investigational agent (or if both agents) needs to be reduced, and actual dose reductions, as well as the 
number of dose reductions.  
 
5.6.2 Treatment Initiation /Continuation : 
 
Starting  a new cycle or continuing  treatment after a CTE should be administered per protocol provided that:  
• Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000 /uL and platelet count ≥ 50,000/uL  
• Recovered from grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicity to grade 1 or baseline .  
• Treatment may be delayed to recover from toxicity or per investigator discretion.  
• No clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progressi on.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients 
treated with IMBRUVICA, particularly in patients with cardiac risk factors, acute 
infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically  monitor 
patients clinically for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic 
symptoms (e.g., palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], lightheadedness) or new onset dyspnea should 
have an ECG performed. If atrial fibrillation persists, consider the risks and 
benefits of IMBR UVICA treatment and dose modification

5.10.1  Disease Assessment Schedule  
A dedicated PET/CT Response assessment will be done after cycles 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 (+/- 7 days).  After Month 12, 
efficacy assessments should occur at the investigators discretion.  If a PET/CT CR ( Deauville  3 or less) is seen then a 
CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast can be substituted.  
 
A restaging bone marrow biopsy may be done if a staging bone marrow biopsy was previously positive or if symptoms 
suggest involvement.  
 
Patients with stable disease after [ADDRESS_202286] is deriving 
benefit. Patients with progressive disease (PD) at any time are off study and will discontinue study treatment.  
 
Patients achieving PR/CR or stable disease that are felt by [CONTACT_172829] a benefit may continue u ntil 
disease progression or for a maximum of 12 cycles (52 weeks of any treatment).

Mandatory p eripheral blood ( 20 mL) for cell free DNA assessment and peripheral mononuclear cells will be collected 
in an EDTA tube pretreatment (day of biopsy or initiation of treatment), day 8, 1 month (+/ - 3 days) and 10 mL will be 
collected at subsequent radiograp hic response assessments, after cycle 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12.  (+/- 7 days).  After Month 
12, efficacy assessments should occur at the investigators discretion with collection of a research blood sample only if 
feasible.    
 
5.11.[ADDRESS_202289], including CD79A,  CD79 B, CARD11, and MYD88 . In addition, these  mutations 
may be associated with the cl inical response to Ibrutinib . To account for the potential influence of these mutations on 
response, they will be assessed from pre -treatment biopsy specimens by [CONTACT_48832]. To achieve this, 
DNA will be extracted from tumor specimens, genome -wide next generation sequencing libraries constructed, and 
hybrid capture utilized to isolate 386 genes that are recurrently mutated in B -cell lymphoma, including those listed 
above.  
 
 5.11.3 Quantitative Assessme nt of Kinetics and Depth of Response  
Tumor cells release DNA into the peripheral blood and it is detectable within the cell -free DNA (cfDNA) f raction isolated 
from plasma . Recent studies have shown that the burden of tumor specific cfDNA in the plasma corr elates  with 
metabolic tumor volume .(19, 20)  In order to quantitatively assess the magnitude and kinetics of response and 
association with radiographic response we will employ cfDNA sequencing by [CONTACT_172830] a 20 ml EDTA tube pretreatment (day of biopsy or initiation of treatment), day 8, 1 month (+/ - 3 
days) and 10mL EDTA tube at subsequent radiographic response asse ssments, after cycle 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12.  (+/- 7 
days).  After Month 12, efficacy assessments should occur at the investigators discretion with 10ml EDTA peripheral 
blood samples obtained ONLY IF FEASIBLE.  We will create  next-generation sequencing libraries , and performing 
hybrid capture for genes with identified mutations from the tumor biopsy specimen as well as immunoglobulin genes. 
(Appendix G Blood  and Tissue Sample Processing and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  
 
This will allow multiple tumor -specific genetic markers to be followed in the peripheral blood, and quantitative 
assessment of response to be calculated by [CONTACT_172831].  
 
 5.11.[ADDRESS_202290] unique intracellular signaling characteristics that vary between patients .(21) We will assess the 
basal level of signaling downstream from the B -cell receptor in pre -treatment biopsies using intracellular phospho -
specific flow cytometry. Therein, tumor B -cells can be identified using surface markers and fixed and permeabilized 
cells interrogated using antibodies that are specific for activating phosphorylation markers on multiple proteins. Using 
fluorescent barcoding and 10 -color multiplexing, we will assess the activity of proximal B -cell receptor signaling 
components (Lyn, Syk, Btk , Blnk, Plcg2), phosphoinositol -3-kinase signaling molecules (Akt,  S6K) and  downstream 
targets of casein kinase signaling (EIF4E, Myc) ). This will provide a quantitative measure of the basal activation of 
these pathways within patient tumor biopsies prior  to treatment. Optional lymph node  biopsies will be  obtained via US  
or computer tomography (CT)  guided biopsy of accessible  lymph nodes at day 0 (pre -treatment; core biopsy), day 8 
(FNA) and end of treatment (progressive disease, toxicity, or end of study —1 year; core biopsy)  so as to assess the 
change in signaling resulting from treatment.   (Appendix G  Blood and Tissue Sample Processing and Shippi[INVESTIGATOR_007])

CD38) and intracellular transcription factors (FoxP3, T -bet, GATA3).  
 
  
6.[ADDRESS_202292]:  
 
6.1 Response to therapy :  
 
Response to therapy will be classified as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), 
progressive disease (PD), early death, or not evaluable. Response to therapy will be determined after cycle  2, 4, 6, 9, 
and 12  (+/- 7 days).  Afte r Month 12, efficacy assessments should occur at the investigators discretion .  
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring permanent discontinuation of study treatment (taken off 
study) without objective evidence of disease progressio n will be counted as progressive disease unless a prior CR or 
PR has been previously documented. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after 
discontinuation of treatment. Deaths will be counted as treatment failure.  
 
Patie nts will be analyzed with respect to overall survival (OS) and progression -free survival (PFS). Overall survival is 
defined as time from the first therapy administered on trial until death from any cause. For subjects who are still alive 
at the time of the  study analysis or are lost to follow -up, survival will be censored at the last recorded date that the 
subject was known to be alive. Progression -free survival is defined as time from therapy until relapse, progression, or 
death from any cause. Response wi ll be determined by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_13899] -principal investigators.  
 
CR can be achieved at any response evaluation of umbralisib  and ibrutinib.  
 
Definitions for clinical response for patients with lymphoma are from the Lugano  Response Criter ia for Malignant 
Lymphoma. (24) Lymph node measurements should be taken from CT or the CT portion of the PET/CT.  Measurement 
of lymphadenopathy will be determined by [CONTACT_172833] (SDP).  Measurable extranodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal 
disease. For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that is only assessable , such 
as diffuse  infiltration of an organ such as the stomach, bone marrow, periphe ral blood, liver, lungs, or bowel by 
[CONTACT_172834] a discrete mass would constitute assessable, but not measurable, disease  (eg, Lymph node or 
tumor mass greater than 1.[ADDRESS_202293] 3 cm below the left costal margin ) will be recorded as present or absent only, unless, while an 
abnormality is still noted by [CONTACT_20478], it is found to be histologically negative.  
 
Response is based on PET/CT  (Deauville  3 or less) or  CT alone if CR is achieved by [CONTACT_10052]/CT.

6.2 Complete Response (CR) : 
 
6.2.1  Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and definitely disease -related 
symptoms if present before therapy. 
 
6.2.2  DLBCL is a FDG -avid lymphoma :  when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post-treatment 
residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET negative.  
 
6.2.3  The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical examination 
or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be considered normal size 
by [CONTACT_20521], and nodules related to lymphom a should disappear. However, determination of 
splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still 
contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect variation s in anatomy, blood volume, the 
use of hematopoietic growth factors, or causes other than lymphoma.  Similarly, other organs 
considered to be enlarged before therapy due to involvement by [CONTACT_56927], such as liver and 
kidneys, must have decreased in size.

6.3 Criteria for Partial Response (PR). The designation of PR requires all of the following:  
 
 6.3.[ADDRESS_202296] a 50% decrease in sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of the largest 
dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the 
following:  
• they should be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions  
• if possible they should be from disparate regions of the body  
• they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these 
sites are involved  
 
 6.3.[ADDRESS_202297] regress by 50% in their SPD or, for single nodules, in the greatest 
transverse diameter.  
 6.3.4  With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable 
and no measurable disease should be present.  
 
 6.3.5  Bone marrow assessment is irrelev ant for determination of a PR if the sample was positive before 
treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (eg, large -cell lymphoma or small 
neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by [CONTACT_86950], but who have persiste nt 
morphologic bone marrow involvement will be considered partial responders.  
  
When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no 
bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial resp onders.

6.5 Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD):  
Lymph nodes should be considered abnormal if the long axis is more than 1.5 cm regardless of the short axis. 
If a lymph node has a  long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is more 
than 1.0. Lymph nodes 1.0 x 1.0 cm will not be considered as abnormal for relapse or progressive disease.  
 
 6.5.1  Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or after completion of  therapy, 
even if other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected site

Refer to the current Investigator Brochure for details of the risks associated with the use of umbralisib , and instructions 
on how to manage patients.  
 
Prohibitions and restrictions for ibrutinib:  
The following guidance should be applied during the perioperative period for subjects who require surgical intervention 
or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib:  
• For any pl anned surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib should be held 
at least [ADDRESS_202311] 7  days after the procedure, and restarted at 
the discretion of the investigator whe n the surgical site is reasonably healed without serosanguineous drainage 
or the need for drainage tubes.   
• For planned minor procedures (such as a central line placement, needle biopsy, thoracentesis, or paracentesis) 
ibrutinib should be held for at least  [ADDRESS_202312] is on ibrutinib, it is not 
necessary to hold ibrutinib for these procedures.  
• For emergency pro cedures, ibrutinib should be held after the procedure until the surgical site is reasonably 
healed, for at least 7 days after the urgent surgical procedure, or at the discretion of the investigator.

UNMC IRB# 345-[ADDRESS_202313] 1 of every 1000 (<1%) patients include : 
 
• Unusual levels of chemicals in the blood caused by [CONTACT_172838], which may lead to 
changes in kidney function, abnormal heartbeat, or seizures. (Tumor lysis syndrome)  
• Itchy rash (Urticaria)  
• Bleeding around the brain (Subdural hematoma)  
• Swollen face, lip, mouth, tongue or throat (Angioedema)

• Severe rash with blisters and peeling skin, particularly around the mouth, nose, eyes and ge nitals (Stevens -
Johnson syndrome)  
• Liver failure (Hepatic failure)  
 
Hemorrhage  
Fatal bleeding events have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Grade 3 or higher bleeding events (subdural 
hematoma, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria and post procedural hemorrhage) have occurred in up to 6% of 
patients. Bleeding events of an y grade, including bruising and petechiae, occurred in approximately half of patients 
treated with ibrutinib.  
The mechanism for the bleeding events is not well understood.  
Ibrutinib may increase the risk of hemorrhage in patients receiving antiplatelet o r anticoagulant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
Consider the benefit -risk of withholding ibrutinib for at least [ADDRESS_202314] occurred with ibrutin ib therapy. Grade 3 or greater infections occurred in 14% to 
26% of patients. Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in patients treated with 
ibrutinib. Monitor patients for fever and infections and evaluate promptly.  
 
A rare and usually fatal viral disease in the brain, Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), has been 
reported in patients treated with ibrutinib in combination with rituximab and in patients who were pre viously treated 
with rituximab.  
 
Cytopenias  
Treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including neutropenia (range, 19 to 29%), thrombocytopenia (range, 5 
to 17%), and anemia (range, 0 to 9%) occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib. Monitor complete blood counts 
monthly.  
Atrial Fibrillation  
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter (range, 6 to 9%) have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib, particularly in 
patients with cardiac risk factors, acute infections, and a previous history of atrial fibrillation. Periodically monitor 
patients clini cally for atrial fibrillation. Patients who develop arrhythmic symptoms (e.g., palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], lightheadedness) 
or new onset dyspnea should have an ECG performed. If atrial fibrillation persists, consider the risks and benefits of 
ibrutinib treatment and dos e modification.  
Hypertension  
Hypertension (range, 6 to 17%) has occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib with a median time to onset of 4.5 
months (rang, 0.03 to 18.40 months). Monitor patients for new onset hypertension or hypertension that is not

UNMC IRB# 345-[ADDRESS_202315] existing anti -hypertensive medications and/or initiate anti -
hypertensive treatments as appropriate.  
Second Primary Malignancies  
Other malignancies (range, 5 to 14%) including non -skin carcinomas (range, 1 to 3%) have occurred in patients 
treated with ibrutinib. The most frequent second primary malignancy was non -melanoma skin cancer (range, 4 to11 
%).  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with ibrutinib therapy. Monitor patients closely and take appropriate 
precautions in patients at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (e.g. high tumor burden).  
Embryo -Fetal Toxicity  
Based on findings in animals, ibrutinib can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Ibrutinib 
caused malformations in rats at exposures [ADDRESS_202316] to a fetus.  
 
Allergic reactions  
 
Serious allergic reactions to ibrutinib, including  rash, difficulty breathing, wheezing, sudden low blood pressure with 
light-headedness, swelling around the mouth, thr oat or eyes, a racing heartbeat, and/or sweating  may occur .   
 
Rash  
 
A maculopapular rash (flat, red areas on the skin with small bumps) has been commonly reported in patients treated 
with ibrutinib alone or in combination with other drugs. Most rashes are  mild to moderate in severity and begin [ADDRESS_202317] been rare reports of severe skin reactions (known as severe cutaneous adverse reaction or “SCAR”, 
involving more than 50% of the body) or rash with bliste rs and peeling skin, which may include open ulcers or sores 
in the mouth and other areas of the body (Stevens - Johnson syndrome). These skin rashes could be life -threatening.  
 
Lymphocytosis and leukostasis  
 
Lymphocytosis is an increase in the number of ly mphocytes, a type of white blood cell, in your blood . This may occur 
in the first few weeks of treatment and one should not assume that this increase in white blood cells means that the 
disease is worsening. This increase may last for several weeks to months. Increased number of white blood cells in 
the bloodstream may alter blood flow resulting in bleeding or clotting (leukostasis). Isolated cases of these events have 
been reported in p atients treated with ibrutinib.  
 
Liver Failure

UNMC IRB# 345-[ADDRESS_202318] been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib.  
 
Interstitial lung disease  
 
Lung abnormalities not associated with infections (e.g, bacteria, viruses, fungi) have been reported in patients treated 
with ibrutinib  
 
Interference with other drugs  
 
Some foods like grapefruit juice and Seville oranges, as well as some medications, may interfere with the way the body 
processes ibrutinib. This interference could cause the amoun t of ibrutinib in the body to be higher or lower than 
expected. It is also possible that taking the study drug with regular medications or supplements, including fish oil, 
Vitamin E, or other vitamins, may change how the  regular medications, or regular sup plements, work. It is very 
important that grapefruit juice and Seville oranges be avoided.  
 
9.0  Toxicity and Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
 
The reporting is only for TGR 1202 and Ibrutinib “study medications,” until [ADDRESS_202319] administration of study 
medication.  
 
NOTE: Problems related to insurance coverage for UNMC potential subjects or enrolled subjects will be reported to 
the IRB a s they are encountered.  
 
This protocol will comply with monitoring and adverse event reporting requirements of the UNMC Fred & Pamela Buffett 
Cancer Center Data Monitoring plan. The protocol will adhere to the institutional and FDA guidelines for the toxi city 
reporting.  
 
All patients will be closely followed for toxicity from the time of informed consent until [ADDRESS_202320] administration 
of study medication. Adverse event and serious adverse events will be followed until baseline or ≤ grade [ADDRESS_202321] (IRB), participating 
sites own IRB a nd Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  
 
Definitions:  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceuti cal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the 
event is considered causally related to the use of the product.  
 
An elective surgery or procedure that is scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if 
the sur gery or procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and the surgery or procedure has been planned 
before study entry. However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study ( e.g., the surgery 
                      Page 35 of 65            
 
 
 
UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
 is performed earlier th an planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery or procedure 
is being done will be considered an adverse event.  
 
An adverse event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as fro m accidental or 
intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered 
an adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events if they 
resul t in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria 
(see Section 5.0, Treatment Plan) and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events. In general, if a 
laboratory abnormality or change in vital sign is associated with a specific diagnosis that is being reported concurrently 
as an adverse event (e.g. elevated creatinine with renal failure or sinus tachycardia in febrile neutropenia) the findings 
that support the diagnosis do not ne ed to be reported as separate adverse events unless the investigator feels it is 
appropriate.  
 
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event  
 
Treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event with onset or worsening from the time that the first 
dose of  study drug is administered until 30 days after the final dose of study drug is administered.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  
 
An unexpected adverse event is any adverse drug event that is not listed in the current labeling/Investigator’s Brochure. 
This includ es events that may be symptomatically and pathophysiologically related to an event listed in the labeling, 
but differ from the labeled event because of greater severity or specificity. For example, under this definition, hepatic 
necrosis would be unexpecte d (by [CONTACT_14213]) if the labeling only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes 
or hepatitis. Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_36093]) if the labeling only listed cerebra l vascular accidents. “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, refers to an 
adverse drug experience that has not been previously observed (i.e., included in the labeling) rather than from the 
perspective of such experience not being anticipated from the p harmacological properties of the pharmaceutical 
product.  
 
Serious Adverse Event  
 
A serious adverse event is one that at any dose (including overdose) and regardless of causality that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening1  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity2  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is an important medical event3  
• Pregnancy  
1 “Life-threatening” means that the subject was at immediate risk of death at the time of the serious adverse 
event; it does not refer to a serious adverse event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
2 “Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means that there i s a substantial disruption of a person’s 
ability to carry out normal life functions.  
3 Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate 
in situations where none of the outcomes listed above occurre d. Important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172781] y be 
considered serious. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
                      Page 36 of 65            
 
 
 
UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
 an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
or the development of drug depend ency or drug abuse. A new diagnosis of cancer during the course of a 
treatment should be considered as medically important.  
 
9.1  Adverse Event Reporting and Definitions Per University of Nebraska Medical Center, IRB and Fred & 
Pamela Buffett Cancer Center  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  
   
This protocol will adhere to all institutional guidelines for adverse event reporting. Adverse events will be 
evaluated using the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC -AE) version 4.02.  
 
9.1.1  IRB REPORTING   
All internal serious adverse events (AE) must be reported to the local IRB promptly per institutional policy 
[UNMC – through the electronic Research Support System(s) (RSS) mechanism] and in no case later than 
two (2) business days following PI [INVESTIGATOR_172782] n that the event occurred if the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_172783] A, B, and C are met:  
 
a. The AE is unexpected, AND  
b. The AE is related to, or possibly related to, the drug, biologic, device, or other research intervention, AND  
c. The AE is more than minor in nature which is defined as requiring treatment from a health professional.  
 
All unexpected , internal, fatal AEs must be reported promptly to the local IRB per institutional policy [UNMC - 
through the electronic RSS mechanism], bu t no later than [ADDRESS_202322] be notified by a telephone call or e -mail.  
 
All expected , internal, fatal AEs (i.e., due to progressive disease or which ref lect a risk currently found in the 
consent form) must be reported to the local IRB per institutional policy [UNMC - through the electronic RSS 
system] no later than ten (10) business days following PI [INVESTIGATOR_172784].  
The UNMC RSS is accessed through a link on the UNMC IRB website ( http://unmc.edu/irb ). 
 
9.1.2  FRED & PAMELA BUFFETT CANCER CENTER DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
COMMITTEE (DSMC) REPORTING   
 
Per UNMC DSMC guidelines, the following must be reported:  
• All adverse events ≥ grade 3 (expected or unexpected, regardless of attribution) will be reported to 
the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC).  
• All serious adverse events will be fully reported and reviewed by  [CONTACT_172839], Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) .  
o The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_172785] a copy of the U NMC SAE 
Assessment Form along with a blinded co py of any related patient source documents  
o If additional information about the SAE is still being collected a preliminary report should 
be filed to the DSMC within seven (7) business days with final reporting when additional 
information is available.  
 
Attribution of AE: The likelihood of relationship of the AE to the study drugs will be determined by [CONTACT_172840]:  
 
Not related: The subject was not exposed to the study treatment or another cause is obvious.  
 
Proba bly not related: The AE is most likely explained by [CONTACT_5748], and the time of occurrence of the 
AE is not reasonably related to the study treatment.

UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
   
Possibly related: Study treatment administration and AE occurrence reasonably related in time, and t he AE 
is explained equally well by [CONTACT_172841], or treatment administration and AE occurrence 
are not reasonably related in time, but the AE is not obviously a result of other causes.  
 
Probably related: Study treatment administration  and AE occurrence are reasonably related in time, and the 
AE is more likely explained by [CONTACT_172842].  
 
Definitely related: There occurrence and timing of the AE are clearly attributable to the study treatment.  
 
Severity Grad e of AE. The severity of events reported on the AE case report form will be determined by [CONTACT_28824] [INVESTIGATOR_172786] (CTC version 4.02).  
 
AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the consent form and  ending 30 days following the final 
chemotherapy. All AEs will be followed until resolution or a cause is identified. Prescription medication taken 
to relieve symptoms of the AE will be recorded in addition to the outcome.  
 
AEs judged by [CONTACT_172843] 30 days after the final chemotherapy.

Definitions  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal 
(investigational or non -investigational) produc t. An adverse event does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medic inal 
(investigational or non - investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non -
investigational) product.  
This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline 
condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities.  
 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest are events that the Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC is actively monitoring 
as a result of a previously identified signal (even if non -serious). These adverse events are:  
• Major Hemorrhage  
Major hemorrhage is defined as any hemorrhagic event that is Grade 3 or greater in severity or that 
results in 1 of the following: intraocular bleeding caus ing loss of vision, the need for a transfusion of 
2 or more units of red cells or an equivalent amount of whole blood, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or prolongation 
of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
• Intracranial Hemorrhage  
Any intracranial hemorrhage adverse event, including subdural hematoma/hemorrhage, epi[INVESTIGATOR_172790]/hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage, of any grade severity, will be captured as 
an event of special interest.  
• Other Malignancies  
In addition to all routine AE reporting, all new malignant tumor s, including solid tumors, skin 
malignancies and hematologic malignancies, are to be reported for the duration of study treatment 
and during any protocol -specified follow -up periods including post -progression follow -up for overall 
survival.  
 
Individual Cas e Safety Report (ICSR)  
A valid ICSR must contain the four minimum criteria required to meet regulatory reporting requirements.  
• an identifiable subject (but not disclosing personal information such as the subject’s name, initials or 
address)  
• an identifiable  reporter (investigational site)  
• a Janssen medicinal product  
• an adverse event, outcome, or certain special situations  
 
The minimum information required is:  
• suspected Janssen medicinal product (doses, indication)  
                      Page 39 of 65            
 
 
 
UNMC IRB# 345-16 Protocol Version 4.2 Dated  07Oct2019   
 • date of therapy (start and end date, if avai lable)  
• batch or lot number, if available  
• subject details (subject ID and country)  
• gender  
• age at AE onset  
• reporter ID  
• adverse event detail (AE verbatim in English), onset date, relatedness, causality, action taken, outcome, 
(if available)  
• Janssen protocol ID  
 
Product Quality Complaint (PQC)  
A product quality compliant is defined as any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a product defect  related to a potential quality 
issue during manufacturing, packaging, release testing, stability monitoring, dose preparation, storage or 
distribution of the product, or delivery system.  Not all PQCs involve a subject.  Lot and batch numbers are 
of high significance and need to be collected whenever available.  
 
Examples of PQC include but not limited to:  
• Functional Problem: e.g., altered delivery rate in a controlled release product  
• Physical Defect:  e.g. abnormal odor, broken or crushed tablets/capsules  
• Potential Dosing Device Malfunction: e.g., auto injector  button not working, needle detaching from 
syringe  
• Suspected Contamination  
• Suspected Counterfeit  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A serious adverse event based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
 
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.)  
• Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a suspected tr ansmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product  
• Is medically important*  
 
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also 
appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life 
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172791]. These should usually be considered 
serious.  
 
NOTE:  DEATH FOR ANY REASON SHOULD BE REPORTED AS A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT.  
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_48804], it is the sign, symptom or diagnosis which led to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172792].

UNMC IRB# 345-[ADDRESS_202325] be 
reported as a serious adverse event, except hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23741]:  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_67729] o r adverse event (e.g., social reasons such as 
pending placement in long -term care facility)  
• Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study. [Note: Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_172793]. Any adverse event 
that results in a prolongation of the originally planned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23745] a new 
serious adverse event.]  
 
 
Life-Threatening Conditions  
Disease progression should not be recorded as an adverse event or serious adverse event term; instead, 
signs and symptoms of clinical sequelae resulting from disease progression/lack of efficacy will be reported 
if they fulfill  the serious adverse event definition.  
 
Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information  
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity is not consistent with the applicable product 
reference safety information. For a med icinal product(s) with a marketing authorization, the expectedness of an 
adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_83407].

vica&utm_content=ibrutinib -+Exact|mkwid|ssjPpM0Gh_dc|pcrid|[ADDRESS_202326] that require expediting reporting and/or safety 
evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
• Drug exposure during pregnancy (maternal and paternal)  
• Overdose of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Exposure to a Janssen medicinal product from breastfeeding  
• Suspected abuse/misuse of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a Janssen medicinal product  
• Any failure of expected pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect) of a Janssen medicinal product  
• Medication error involving a Janssen medicinal product (with or without patient exposure t o the Janssen 
medicinal product, e.g., name [CONTACT_2976])  
• Suspected transmission of any infectious agent via administration of a medicinal product  
• Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a Janssen medicinal product  
 
These safety events may not meet the definition of an adverse event; however, from  Janssen Scientific 
Affairs, LLC  and TG Therapeutics perspective, they are treated in the same manner as adverse events. 
Special situations should be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the CRF.  
 
Any special situation that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on a Serious 
Adverse Event Report Form and be reported to the Janssen Scientific Affairs  LLC and TG Therapeutics

 Event Form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g. spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital 
anomaly, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events and must be reported using the Serious 
Adverse Event Form.  
 
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study and discontinue 
further study treatment.  
 
Because the effect of the Janssen medicinal product on sperm is unknown,  pregnancies in partners of male 
subjects exposed to a Janssen med icinal product will be reported by [CONTACT_83409] [INVESTIGATOR_874] 
[ADDRESS_202328], and as such the data shall be made available within a reasonab le timeframe at the Janssen ’s request.  
 
Procedures for Reporting Safety Data and Product Quality Complaints (PQCs) for Janssen Medicinal 
Products to  Janssen  
All adverse events and special situations  whether serious or non -serious, related or not related, following exposure 
to a Janssen medicinal product are to be documented by [CONTACT_172845]’s source records. Investigators must record in the CRF their opin ion concerning the relationship of the 
adverse event to a Janssen medicinal product.  
All (serious and non -serious) adverse events reported for a Janssen medicinal product should be followed -up in 
accordance with clinical practice.  
 
SAEs and Special Report ing Situations  
All serious adverse events that have not resolved by [CONTACT_2054], or that have not resolved upon 
discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study, must be followed until any of the following occurs:  
• The event resolves  
• The event stabilizes  
• The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available  
• The event can be attributed to agents other than the study drug or to factors unrelated to study conduct  
• It becomes unlikely that any additional informatio n can be obtained (subject or health care practitioner 
refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration of due diligence with follow -
up efforts)  
 
The PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR) will transmit all SAEs and special situations foll owing exposure to a 
Janssen product under study in a form provided by [CONTACT_172846], in English within 24 -hours of becoming aware of the event(s).

• The  PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR [INVESTIGATOR_172794] -up. A safety report is not considered complete until all clinical details needed to 
interpret the case are received. Reporting of follow -up information should follow the same timeline as 
initial reports.  
 
• Copi[INVESTIGATOR_172795], irrespective of association with the Janssen Product under 
study, are to be provided to Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC  using a transmiss ion method listed below  
within  [ADDRESS_202329]. Timely, accurate, and complete 
reporting and analysis of PQC information from studies are crucial for the protection of patients, 
investigators, and Janssen , and are mandated by [CONTACT_23824]. Janssen Scientific Affairs 
has established procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate 
reporting of PQC information. Lot and/or Batch #s shall be collected or any reports failure of expected 
pharmacological action (i.e., lack of effect). The product should be quarantined immediately and if possible, 
take a pi[INVESTIGATOR_1103].  
 
All initial PQCs involving a Janssen medicinal product under study must be reported to Janssen Scientific 
Affairs, LLC  by [CONTACT_83409] [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_202330] will provide additional informatio n/form to be completed.  
 
If the defect for a Janssen medicinal product under study is combined with either a serious adverse event or 
non-serious adverse event, the PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR [INVESTIGATOR_172796] t reporting timelines.  A sample of the suspected product should be maintained for 
further investigation if requested by [CONTACT_48873] .

Section 10.0 Statistical Considerations  
 
The phase IIa p ortion will further assess the safety and tolerability and allow a preliminary assessment of the efficacy 
of the novel combination to provide background for an appropriately powered phase II study.  We plan to accrue 24 
patients into the phase IIa portion at a micronized dose of 800 mg of umbralisib  and 560 mg of ibrutinib.  The 
assessment of toxicity and efficacy will be performed within the entire cohort. To consecutively monitor the safety 
primary endpoint in the phase IIa portion, we will employ a sequential probability stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_172797] 1 -4. This stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_172798] a  cumulative toxicity event (CTE)  occurs 
in: ≥2/first 4; ≥4/first 8; or if more than [ADDRESS_202331] (24th) evaluable patient has completed the trial have 
any CTE. This rule has the following stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_153489] : 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A CTE is defined as:  
• Grade ≥ 3 non -hematologic (attributed to either or both study drugs)  
• Grade 4 hematologic toxicities (attributed to either or both drugs) defined as:  
o Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (platelets < 25 K/µL)  
o Grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 0.5)  
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that results in a > 7 day delay in either drug.  
• One week or greater delay in initiating any cycle day 1 due to continued drug -related toxicity.  
 
 
If a patient has progression of disease  or is removed from study not related to a CTE after completion of 2 cycles but 
less than 4 cycles the patient ’s safety evaluation will be included, but noted appropriately.  If less than [ADDRESS_202332] for the combination.   After testing the combination on 12 patients, the trial will 
be terminated if </= 1 patients respond.   If the trial goes on to the second stage and not discontinued due to the CTE 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_172799], a total of 24 patients will be studied. If the total  number responding is less than or equal to five, 
the regimen will be rejected.   This follow s a Simon two -stage design for efficacy following a minimax design with the 
following parameters:   overall response rate for a poor regimen of 0.01, overall response rate for a good regimen of 
0.31, a type I error of 0.20 and power of 80%.  True

 Appendix A:  
Use of ibrutinib with other CYP3A inhibitors or inducers (per ibrutinib USPI)  
 
CYP3A Inhibitors :  
In healthy volunteers, co -administration of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased Cmax and AUC of 
ibrutinib by [ADDRESS_202350] ibrutinib dose evaluated in clinical trials was 12.5 mg/kg (actual 
doses of 840 – 1400 mg) given for 28 days with single dose AUC values of 1445 ± 869 ng ⋅ hr/mL which is 
approximately 50% greater than steady state exposures seen a t the highest indicated dose (560 mg).  
 
Avoid co -administration with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less CYP3A 
inhibition. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors which would be taken chronically (e.g., ritonav ir, indinavir, 
nelfinavir, saquinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, nefazodone) is not recommended. For strong CYP3A inhibitors used 
short -term (e.g., antifungals and antibiotics treatment for 7 days or less  e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
voriconazole, posa conazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin)) consider interrupting ibrutinib therapy until the CYP3A 
inhibitor is no longer needed. Avoid strong CYP3A inhibitors that are needed chronically. If a moderate CYP3A 
inhibitor must be used, reduce ibrutinib dose to  140 mg (e.g., fluconazole, darunavir, erythromycin, diltiazem, 
atazanavir, aprepi[INVESTIGATOR_053], amprenavir, fosamprevir, crizotinib, imatinib, verapamil, and ciprofloxacin).  Patients taking 
concomitant strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors should be monitored more closely for signs of ibrutinib toxicity.  
 
Avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate  
inhibitors of CYP3A.  
 
CYP3A Inducers :  
Administration of ibrutinib with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, decreased ibrut inib Cmax and AUC by 
[CONTACT_3450] 13 - and 10 -fold, respectively.  
 
Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., carbamazepi[INVESTIGATOR_050], rifampin, phenytoin and St. John’s Wort). 
Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction.  
 
 
 
 
Appendix B:  
Cockroft -Gault  Creatinine Clearance Calculation  
 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl) can be calculated using the Cockroft -Gault equation as follows:  
 
CrCl (ml/min) = (140-age) (actual wt in kg) divided by 72 x serum creatinine (mg/dl)  
 
For females use 85% of calculated CrCl value.

Oral, Sublingual, and/or Buccal Route  
Medication Adherence Standard Procedure  
(V 1.0 11 -25-2013)  
PURPOSE  
To provide a means of ensuring oral, sublingual and/or buccal routes of medication adherence to patients while 
participating in a clinical trial.  
1. A ph ysician’s order will be completed by [CONTACT_172852], sublingual and/or buccal 
administration per IRB approved protocol.  
2. To ensure the consistent and safe administration of medications not given under the direct supervision of 
study staff (at home), there will be a “Medication Information Sheet” and a calendar to document times of drug 
administration.  
3. To record medication adherence Study staff will document results of medication reconciliation and or 
medication return in the patien t’s chart.  
4. Maintain documentation of medications returned or sent to investigational pharmacy for destruction (if 
applicable).  
PROCEDURE  
1. Protocol specific information regarding the individual medication(s) should be listed on the form “Medication 
Informat ion Sheet” and given to the patient at the start of the study and throughout treatment if necessary to 
help ensure adherence. (See Form A)  
2. Name, dose and route of each medication should be listed under ‘How to take your Medication’ on the 
“Medication Infor mation Sheet”.  
3. Patients will be given a monthly “Medication Calendar”.  The calendar will have a place for the patient to 
record the time that the medication(s) were taken. (See Form B for example)  
4. The research nurse will review the patient’s “Medication C alendar” for adherence to the study regimen for oral 
medication administration. Adherence will be noted in the patient’s chart.  Medication reconciliation will be 
done and if there is medication to be returned/destroyed it will be sent to the Nebraska Medi cal Center 
Investigational Pharmacist for return/destruction in accordance to the Nebraska Medical Center Destruction 
of Investigational product, Policy #4.860.

Medication Calendar that is provided to record your dosing.  
 
Group C:   You will take both umbralisib  800mg (4 tablets) and Ibrutinib  560 mg (4 capsules) by [CONTACT_31943] 
a day with a full 8ounce glass of water until your treating physician tells you to stop.  Follow you r Medication 
Calendar that is provided to record your dosing.  
 
• Umbralisib  should be taken in the AM.  (NOTE : After cycle [ADDRESS_202358] the option to take umbralisib  and Ibrutinib dosing together at the same time of day.)  
• Ibrutinib should be taken in the evening. (NOTE:  After cycle [ADDRESS_202359] been seen 
you can ha ve the option to take umbralisib  and Ibrutinib dosing together at the same time of day.)  
 
Things to know about your medication :  
1. The dose of the study medications will remain the same during your entire treatment, unless your 
doctor informs you of a change .   
2. If your doctor modifies the dose of either medication for any reason, please record the change on 
your Medication Calendar (Form B).  
3. You should take your medications at the same time each day with food.   
4. You should avoid grapefruit and Seville oranges  (Known as “Chinese Bitter Orange”, bitter orange, 
sour orange, bigarade orange, or marmalade orange. The Seville orange variety is used in the 
production of marmalade/cooking) during treatment, as these can alter the absorption of the 
medications.  
5. You sho uld swallow the tablets and capsules as a whole, do not chew or crush them.  
6. If you miss a dose of your medications, it should be taken as soon as possible on the same day.  If 
it is missed for the entire day, it should not be made up.  If a dose is missed make sure to mark it on 
your Medication Calendar (Form B).  
7. If vomiting occurs, no attempt should be made to replace the vomited doses.

Version  Date : August 5, [ADDRESS_693151] from currently $40k -60k to under $10k. We will obtain a retinal OCT scan with 
the prototype handheld OCT scanner in adult patients scheduled in the retina clinic at the UNC 
Kittne r Eye Center undergoing standard OCT testing as part of their visit. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_533763].  
 
Background and Significance  
Optical coherence tomo graphy (OCT) has become the gold standard for diagnosing eye diseases 
such as diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration. The ability of OCT to create depth 
resolved, cross sectional images allows physicians to examine the various layers of the retina 
and see the earliest signs of disease. While OCT has seen wide adoption, the high cost of 
imaging systems ($40,000 -$100,000+) has resulted in this technology being available primarily 
at large eye centers. However, for some patients such as advanced diabeti cs, travel to a central 
eye care facility can be a barrier to receiving needed follow up exams. In most communities, the 
primary eye care provider is an optometrist who may not provide OCT imaging due to the high 
system cost. Further, the high price of OCT  systems has resulted in limited use in developi[INVESTIGATOR_533764], but currently systems are too 
expensive. To address this unmet need, we have developed a prototype OCT system with a 
target sales price of $10,[ADDRESS_693152] optical coherence tomography configuration, consisting of a light source, 
an interferometer and a detector.   Light from a superluminescent diode (SLD) is split into the 
reference and sample arms of the interferometer.   Light in the  sample arm is directed toward the 
eye through a scanning mirror.   A 3 mm diameter beam is focused onto the retina by [CONTACT_533767]’s 
lens and swept across the surface as the mirror is scanned.  
  
For this system, the light source is an SLD from Exalos, producing  mean power of 3.5 mW and a 
center wavelength of 832.6 nm.   The bandwidth is 47.6 nm, resulting in a coherence length 
(depth resolution) of 6.4 micrometers.   After passing through the interferometer and other 
Version  Date : August 5, 2019   3 optical elements, the resulting sample arm cont ains 0.6 mW of optical power in a 3 mm diameter 
beam incident on the cornea.   The resulting optical power density at the cornea is 0.08 
mW/mm2 = 0.008 W/cm2 
  
ANSI limit for maximum exposure to the eye is < 0.[ADDRESS_693153] device would 
be below this threshold with a 7 mm diameter beam.   However, with the  smaller beam of 3 mm, 
which does not fill the eye’s pupil aperture, the focusing power is reduced.   Therefore, the power 
is significantly (4 -5x) below the maximum permissible exposure.  
 
Subjects will be informed of the study when they present to the clini c for a regular clinical care 
visit.   Besides the standard OCT which is obtained during the routine visit, OCT of both retinas 
will be performed using the Low Cost handheld OCT prototype. The OCT software will calculate 
central macular thickness as well as  macular volume. [CONTACT_362837] will compare the quality of 
obtained images and measurements between the standard and the new OCT device.  
 
Subject  Recruitment and Compensation  
Adult patients scheduled in the retina clinic at the UNC Kittner  Eye Center  will be recruited . 
Inclusion Criteria  
1) At least 18 years of age at the time of examination (no upper age limit)  
2) Patients scheduled to receive standard OCT testing as part of their visit.  
Exclusion Criteria

to the patient.  
 
Risk / Benefit Analysis  
Potential Risks  
Potential risks include:  
1. breach of confidentiality  
2. side effect from study procedures and/or devices  
  
Breach of confidentiality  
Data collected as part of this study will be stored in password -protected electronic databases on 
password -protected servers within the Department of Ophthalmology  at UNC and will be 
accessible only by [CONTACT_533769]. Information recorded on paper data sheets will be 
treated as strictly confidential and will be stored within locked files in the Department of 
Ophthalmology. Access to electronic and paper f iles will be restricted to the personnel listed on 
this study.   Only the PI [INVESTIGATOR_533765].  
  
Side Effect from Study Procedures and/or Devices  
There is no known risk from the u se of a retinal OCT except for some potential discomfort from 
the bright blue light used in the scanner.  
  
Potential Benefits  
There is no direct benefit to subjects participating in this research study.   However, the benefit 
to society may be in lowering t he cost of OCT machines, thus increasing their use in ophthalmic 
practices.  
  
Alternative Treatments  
There are no alternative treatments to participating in this research.   It is not intended to be 
therapeutic, but to acquire basic scientific knowledge.   
 
Data Analysis and Statistical Considerations  
Central macular thickness and total macular volume measurements from the new OCT device 
will be compared with standard OCT. Every scanner has a slightly different values for "normal 
eyes", meaning the central fo veal thickness might read 300 microns on one scanner and 280 on 
a different one. We will try to establish a database/values for eyes without retinal disease on 
the new OCT system. Given the low number of patients in this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799], we do not plan to 
comp are the new scanner with existing ones statistically (we will not determine p -values).   The 
Version  Date : August 5, [ADDRESS_693155] system, status reports will be submitted to the Duke PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_533766].   These reports will include all adverse events reported for the study, 
determined to be related or unrelated to the study protocol.   The study team will me et, as 
needed, throughout the period of study to review any reported adverse events and address any 
potential safety concerns.   
  
Data accuracy and protocol compliance  
Data acquired during the clinical study will be reviewed by [CONTACT_533770].   In the event 
that data do not appear satisfactory, a review of protocol compliance will be conducted.   If the 
protocol has been followed, a technical inspection of  the device by [CONTACT_533771].

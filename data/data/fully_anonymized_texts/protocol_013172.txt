 2.  BACKGROUND  
  
 2.1  Study Disease and Rationale  
  
Approximately 40% of cancer patients are diagnosed with spi[INVESTIGATOR_158279] (1) and up to 90% of terminal cancer patients have evidence 
of metastatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_158280] -mortem studies (2 -6).  Management of spi[INVESTIGATOR_158281], but may include 
systemic therapy alone or radiation  therapy.  In patients with spi[INVESTIGATOR_158282], spi[INVESTIGATOR_90973], or neurologic deficits as a result of their spi[INVESTIGATOR_121669], the standard of 
 J12133 Version 06/26/[ADDRESS_183962] decompression and/or stabilization followed by [CONTACT_158320] a 
large randomized study which revealed significantly higher rates of ambulation in 
patients undergoing surgical resection followed by [CONTACT_158321] (7).    
    
Rates of local recurrence following surgical resection alone are high (Gilbert, Black, 
Greenberg, Rodriguez, Sorensen), likely at least in part as a result of difficulty attaining a 
widely negative surgical margin, especially in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_13814].  As suc h, radiation 
therapy is typi[INVESTIGATOR_158283] a metastatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_158284].  Historically most patients have been treated with conventional 
radiation therapy which generally involves 2 -3 weeks of daily radiation treatment to both 
the involved vertebral levels as well as a vertebral level above and below.  However, 
recurrence rates following conventional radiation therapy to t he spi[INVESTIGATOR_158285] 
(Klekamp and Samii, Chow E, Sze WM, Wu JS).    
  
More recently, a [ADDRESS_183963] vertebral disease has been well established and is currently being 
compared to conventional radiation therapy in the context of a randomized controlled 
trial (RTOG 0631).  Data suggests that in spi[INVESTIGATOR_158286], rates of 
marginal failure are low and local control rates are high (Ahmed IJROBP 2011; Gerszten, 
Jin, Ryu, Chang, Ryu).  Although frequently performed in standar d clinical practice, only 
[ADDRESS_183964]-operative patients with resected spi[INVESTIGATOR_158278] (Rock, Moulding, Gerszten), and 
the role and benefit of SRS in this setting remains uncertain.  
  
As systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_158287], it is likely 
that the incidence and prevalence of spi[INVESTIGATOR_158288], and 
improving management of spi[INVESTIGATOR_158289], 
improving neurologic function, and potentially improving survival. The purpose of the 
study is to prospectively examine the efficacy of post -operative SRS boost in patients 
who have undergone surgical resection of metastatic spi[INVESTIGATOR_121669].

5.1.2 Image Fusion  
  
Following completion o f simulation scans, the following datasets will be 
fused using the treatment planning software: 1) CT simulation; 2) CT 
myelogram (if performed); 3) pre -operative diagnostic scan; 4) MRI 
simulation.  The exact sequences of these scans to fuse will be at th e 
discretion of the treating radiation oncologist and neurosurgeon.  If a patient 
is unable to undergo one of these scans he may remain on the protocol at the 
discretion of both the treating physician and principal investigator.    
  
5.1.[ADDRESS_183974]  At Risk (OAR) Delineation  
  
Tumor and OARs will be delineated and approved by [CONTACT_158322].

GTV will defined as the residual disease as visualized on post -operative 
imaging.  
    
[IP_ADDRESS]     Clinical Target Volume (CTV)  
  
CTV will account for the GTV, tumor bed, and other sites of potential 
microscopic disease spread at the discretion of the treating physicians.  
The CTV should include areas of disease on pr e-operative imaging as well 
as surgical findings as documented in operative notes and in personal 
communications with the surgeon.  Surgical incision does not need to be 
included in the treatment volume except in unique situations where it is 
believed to b e a region at high risk of recurrence.

 5.4  Duration of Th erapy  
  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, radiosurgery will be 
administered for a total of 5 fractions or until one of the following criteria applies:  
  
- Disease progression,  
- Intercurrent illness that prevents further administrati on of treatment,  
- Unacceptable adverse event(s),  
- Patient decides to withdraw from the study, or  
- General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.

9.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
  
 9.2.1 Sample Size    
A total of 35 patients will be enrolled in the protocol.  Assuming a 60% 
radiographic local control rate at 12 months with conventional radiation 
therapy (Rades 2009), our trial will need a total of 35 patients to yield 80% 
power detecting 20% absolute imp rovement (LC=80%) at an alpha level of 
0.05 (one -sided) to be statistically significant.   
    
             9.2.2  Accrual  
    We anticipate enrollment of approximately 1 -2 patients per month to the         
protocol with accrual completed in approximately  24 months.  
  
[IP_ADDRESS]    Stratification Factors  
  
            There will be no stratification factors upon initial enrollment in the protocol.

 9.3   Statistical Analysis plan  
  
 9.3.1  Primary:   
The proportion of patients who were absence of local recurrence (local control) at 12 
months after initial SRS will be estimated along with 90% confidence interval. The 
local recurrence is defined in section [IP_ADDRESS].   
  
9.3.2 Secondary:  
  
Time to radiogr aphic local recurrence will be calculated from the date of initial SRS to 
the date of LR was documented. Probability of time to LR and median time to LR will 
be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method.   
  
A proportion of patient being retreated during first 1 2 months since initial SRS will be 
estimated along with 95% confidence interval.  
  
The symptomatic local recurrence rate at 12 months will be estimated along with 95% 
confidence interval using binomial distribution.

experience grade [ADDRESS_183992] imated, along with 95% confidence 
intervals by [CONTACT_158326]. Observed sever adverse event associated with SRS 
including radiation myelopathy will be summarized using descriptive statistics.   
  
Time to return to chemotherapy will be calculated fro m the date of initial SRS to the 
starting date of chemotherapy. The chemotherapy date is censored if patient has not had 
chemotherapy at time the study database is closed for final analysis. Probability of time 
to return to chemotherapy will be estimated u sing Kaplan -Meier method.       
  
Patient’s tumor histology and wound healing will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics.   
     
10.   ADVERSE EVENTS AND RECORDING   
  
 10.1  Definition of Adverse Event (AE)  
  
An adverse event is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the 
deterioration of a pre -existing medical condition during or following an exposure to a 
treatment, whether or not considered causally related to the treatment.  An undesirable 
medical condition may be symptoms (headache, nausea), signs (tachycardia, enlarged 
liver), or abnormal results of an investigation (MRI, laboratory finding).  In clinical trials, 
J12133 Version 06/26/2018  20  from the time of signing an informed consent, an AE may include an undesirable medical 
condition, occurring at any time, even if no trial treatment has been administered.  
  
10.2      Radiation Related Adverse Events    
  
All radiation related adverse events will be recorded on the local toxicity case report 
forms.  
  
11.  SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE) AND REPORTING  
  
 11.1  Serious Adverse Event  
  
11.1.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
  
A serious adverse event is an AE occurring at any point during a clinical trial that 
fulfills one or more of the following criteria:   
  
● Results in death.  
  
● Is immediately life threatening.  
  
● Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081].  
  
● Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect.  
  
● Unexpected event that cause harm or place person at a greater r isk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized, and which was possibly related to 
the research.  Unexpected means that the event was not described in the 
consent form or the event exceeded the expected severity.  
  
● Is an important medical event that m ay jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
  
11.[ADDRESS_183993] (JH -IRB) within 10 working days of the principal 
investigator [INVESTIGATOR_20657].  Reporting for the death of a patient which was 
unexpected (i.e.: not related to a risk of participation that was listed in the protocol or 
the consent document, and was more likely than not to be caused by [CONTACT_158327]/intervention, must be reported to the JH -IRB within 3 working days of 
when the princi pal investigator receives the report of the death.  Reporting for death of 
a participant that was expected due to the nature of the patient’s underlying disease or 
condition, or identified as caused by a possible risk of the study 
procedure/intervention as  described in this protocol or consent form, must be reported 
J12133 Version 06/26/[ADDRESS_183994] to report the death until 
the time of continuing review.    
12.     DATA AND SAFETY REPORTING/ REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
  
 12.[ADDRESS_183995], and the study coordinator to assess the data quality.  
These meetings will occur annually and a moni toring report of the findings will be 
submitted to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee on an annual basis.  Any protocol 
deviations or violations will be documented in the monitoring reports.  The review 
will include: consent forms, eligibility criteria, protocol compliance, treatment 
administration, toxicity reports, response, regulatory compliance, case report forms 
(completeness as well as verifying that information coded on the case report forms are 
supported by [CONTACT_18412]), and all other materia ls related to the trial.  This is a 
Level I study under the SKCCC Data Monitoring Plan (date).  The Clinical Research 
Office QA group will assume external auditing responsibilities by [CONTACT_158328] t hereafter depending on the rate of 
accrual and prior audit results.  The Safety Monitoring Committee will review this 
trial for safety and data quality annually.  
  
 12.2    Data Safety Monitoring Plan  
  
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
(12/6/2012).  The Clinical Research Office QA Group will perform an audit after  
the first subject has been treated and then periodically depending on the rate of  
accrual and prior a udit results.  All trial monitoring and reporting will be reviewed  
annually by [CONTACT_469].  
  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_158303].  Data must be reviewed to assure the 
validity of data, as well as, the safety of the s ubjects.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_158304], review safety reports, and clinical trial efficacy endpoints and to 
confirm that the safety outcomes favor continuation of the study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_158305], reporting adverse events, assuring 
that consent is obtained and documented, reporting of unexpected outcomes, and 
reporting the status of the trial in the continuing renewal report submitted to the IRB 
and to the trial monitoring review group.  
  
 12.3  Data Reporting  
  
12.3.1 Method  
          
J12133 Version 06/26/2018  22  Data will be collected on Case Report Forms (CRFs). These CRFs will be completed by 
[CONTACT_9137]. The CRFs for each subject will be kept in a separate research 
binder. Along with each completed C RF there will be corresponding source 
documentation filed for verification. The Principal Investigator, Research Study Nurse, 
and Study Coordinator will informally meet on a regular basis to make sure that the trial is 
progressing as mandated by [CONTACT_60797]. The CRO will audit this trial per their standards 
to ensure and verify that the protocol is be carried out according to specs as well as to 
verify that data included on subject CRFs are accurate. Exit reports generated as a result 
of these CRO audits w ill be forwarded to both the Safety Monitoring Committee as well  
as to the adjudicating IRB of record for review.

Version date: 9/30/[ADDRESS_1154242] TITLE  
A Randomized Controlled Trial of Dronabinol and Vaporized Cannabis in Chronic Low Back Pain 
2. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR   
[CONTACT_19617] D. Marcotte, PhD., Professor , Department  of Psychiatry  
3. FACILITIES  
We plan on conducting the study at the following locations: 
1. HIV Neurobehavioral Research Center/Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research (CMCR), [ADDRESS_1154243], Suite B, MC8231 
San Diego, CA [ZIP_CODE] 
4. ESTIMATED DURATION OF THE STUDY 
We estimate that the study will take 4 years . 
5. LAY LANGUAGE SUMMARY OR SYNOPSIS (no more than one paragraph)  
This study will involve treating low back pain associated with nerve injury with two types of medicinal 
cannabis for eight weeks. Research subjects will consume either oral Δ9-THC (dronabinol), vaporized 
4.0% Δ9 -THC/6.5% CBD  (estimated percentages), or placebo. An analysis will then be performed to 
assess the risk-benefit ratio of dronabinol and vaporized 4.0% Δ9-THC/6.5%. In addition, subjects will 
undergo driving simulation to determine how long it takes for them to recover from these medications.  
6. SPECIFIC AIMS  
AIM #1 To assess whether treatment with vaporized whole plant cannabis or oral ∆9-THC reduces 
spontaneous and evoked pain more than placebo, and whether there are differences between the 
two active treatments. 
AIM #2 To examine the effects of vaporized whole plant cannabis and oral Δ9-THC (dronabinol) on 
mood, neuropsychological function, and psychomimetic side-effects (high, stoned, etc.) compared to 
placebo and to each other. 
AIM #3 To examine the acute effects (after receiving stable treatment for 4 weeks) of vaporized 
whole plant cannabis and oral Δ9 -THC compared to placebo and each other on driving skills.  
7. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
             The present proposal builds upon previous work funded by [CONTACT_831640] (CMCR) 1. In our first study, thirty-eight patients with a 
heterogeneous collection of neuropathic pain conditions (e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_329290], central post-
stroke pain, peripheral neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and complex regional pain syndrome) 
resistant to standard pharmacologic treatments were recruited.2 Subjects underwent a standardized 
procedure for smoking high dose (7% Δ9-THC), medium dose (3.5% Δ9-THC), or placebo Δ9-THC while continuing to use their regularly prescribed treatments. 
2 A mixed linear model demonstrated an 
equivalent analgesic response to smoking cannabis with both the high and medium doses. Psychoactive effects were minimal and well-tolerated, with some acute cognitive effects, particularly 
with memory, at the high dose (7% Δ9-THC).  
 Our second study involved subjects with similar neuropathic pain diagnoses.
3 Smoking was 
discarded as a delivery technique in favor of vaporization to reduce exposure to harmful pyrolytic compounds.
4, 5 In addition, low dose (1.3%) Δ9-THC was substituted for high dose (7%) Δ9-THC. We 
did this to evaluate a  further reduction of the concentration of this psychoactive constituent of 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 2 cannabis on cognitive and psychoactive side-effects. In this second study, both the low (1.3%) and 
medium dose (3.5%) Δ9-THC proved to be equivalent analgesics. In general, the effect sizes on cognitive testing were consistent with the minimal doses of Δ9-THC employed; the effect of the low 
dose (1.3%) was often less than that of the medium dose (3.5%) Δ9-THC.  
            Both of the above studies were 6-hour human laboratory experiments. The present study is 
designed to evaluate whether or not the medium dose of cannabis (3.5%) can maintain an analgesic 
response over an eight-week period. In addition, a direct comparison of this vaporized preparation will 
be made with dronabinol and placebo. The medium dose of cannabis (3.5%) has been selected as it 
was utilized in a human experimental laboratory experiment that compared inhaled Δ9-THC and 
dronabinol.
[ADDRESS_1154244], participants immersed their hand in cold water (4 degrees 
C), and the time to report pain (pain sensitivity) and withdraw the hand from the water (pain tolerance) was recorded. Compared with placebo, marijuana and dronabinol decreased pain 
sensitivity, increased pain tolerance, and decreased subjective ratings of pain intensity. The 
magnitude of peak change in pain sensitivity and tolerance did not differ between marijuana and 
dronabinol, although dronabinol produced analgesia that was of a longer duration. Marijuana and 
dronabinol also increased abuse-related subjective ratings relative to placebo; these ratings were 
greater with marijuana. These data indicate that under controlled conditions, marijuana and 
dronabinol decreased pain, with dronabinol producing longer-lasting decreases in pain sensitivity and 
lower ratings of abuse-related subjective effects than marijuana.  
              A direct comparison of cannabis and dronabinol has not been performed in a clinical 
population. The present study will fill this void by [CONTACT_746] a randomized, double-blind placebo 
controlled 8-week trial comparing the effectiveness of oral versus vaporized cannabis in patients with 
chronic low back pain. In addition to studying efficacy, we will also perform a driving simulation study 
to determine the real -world impact of ca nnabinoid treatments.  
9. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS  
           All procedures will be experimental, investigational and/or are carried out solely for research 
purposes. There will be no standard treatment or therapy (i.e., procedures that participants would 
receive even if not participating in research) performed in the two arms of this study that are 
described below: 
.  
ARM #1. Eight-Week Randomized Controlled Study Of 4% THC/6.5% CBD Cannabis Versus 
Oral Δ9-THC:  
 An 8 week randomized, controlled phase 2/3 clinical trial of cannabinoid preparations will be 
performed utilizing three treatment regimens:  (1) vaporized Δ9-THC (4.0% Δ9-THC/6.5% CBD) plus placebo oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353] 
 (2) vaporized Δ9-THC (placebo) plus dronabinol  
 (3) vaporized Δ9-THC (placebo) plus placebo oral pi[INVESTIGATOR_831633]:  
 Subjects will be recruited through letters provided patients by [CONTACT_831641], Perlman Medical Office, [ADDRESS_1154245], Suite 2C 
La Jolla, CA (Appendix 1), newspaper advertisements (Appendix 2), and Research Match, a 
volunteer online registry funded by [CONTACT_7681] (Appendix 3). In addition, ICD-9 
code 724.2 will be used to identify pertinent potential subjects. The following PHI will be requested: 
patient name, mailing address, date of birth. A request (along with documentation of UCSD IRB 
approval) will be forwarded to database managers at the Clinical Data Warehouse for Research 
(CDWR) who will be asked to pull a subset of the data from the Electronic Health Record system to 
query patient information in a HIPAA -compliant manner. Volunteers will be screened via telep hone  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 3 interview and, as appropriate, via face-to-face assessment. Telephone screening (respondents blind 
to selection criteria) will assure volunteers meet general age and medical criteria.   
If already using cannabis, participants will be asked to slowly taper cannabis use over a one-week 
period (Baseline Week - Figure 1) so that they are only using study medications during the remaining 
[ADDRESS_1154246] adhered to this period of abstinence before the 
study. A level above 5 ng/ml will indicate recent use and the appointment will be rescheduled. 
 
Baseline Period:  
If eligibility criteria (see below) are met, subjects will be instructed on completing a paper diary (Appendix 4). Provided their VAS pain intensity remains above 3/10 during the Baseline Week, they 
will be given oral and herbal study medication (and a Volcano Vaporizer) at the next study visit one 
week later. 
 
At the baseline visit, participants will be given the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) in order to 
screen for depression and suicidality. They will also be given the AUDIT and DAST to screen for 
substance use problems. The PSQ and Mood Disorder Questionnaire will also be administered to 
screen for Schizophrenia and Bipolar Type I, respectively. The painDETECT Questionnaire will be 
administered to distinguish neuropathic low back pain from non-neuropathic low back pain. The 
Survey of Cannabis Use will be administered during this period to obtain information on the cannabis use habits of the participant.  
 
Should the participant choose to participate the in the driving simulation portion of the study, the 
Driving History and Habits Questionnaire will be administered to obtain information on participant 
driving history, should they decide to participate in the driving simulation study portion.  
 
Telephone Interview:  
To determine eligibility, each prospective participant will be asked the following questions from the

     Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either one active study medication (e.g., medium-
strength vaporized cannabis , or dronabinol) plus one placebo study medication, or double-placebo. 
Within the limits of safety and tolerability, patients will undergo titration of both vaporized and oral 
study medication during Weeks 1-4. The oral medication will be titrated from a minimum of [ADDRESS_1154252] their intake of 
vaporized cannabis (i.e., number of vaporization sessions, puffs), oral study medications, and 
breakthrough pain medications, as well as pain relief measurements. In order that an effect from 
study medication will be evident, subjects will be asked to enter data into paper diary within a one-to-
two hour window following dosing of study and breakthrough medications. In between visits, patients

Study Visits:  
           Subjects will come in for 2-hour study visits at the intervals designated by [CONTACT_831643] 1. A review of the paper daily diary, and, after the baseline week, the completion of the 
assessments described below under Outcome Measures will also be reviewed. 
           Study Δ9-THC will be packaged in separate prescription vials for each vaporization session to 
be performed at the subject’s residence. The vial will be marked with the date, directions for timing of 
vaporization session(s), and the maximum number of puffs from that vial. The collection vial will also 
be labeled for return of vaporized cannabis. All study medication will be packaged in a security 
container for purposes of preventing diversion with instructions to keep the locked strong box in a 
secure location. At the time of the subsequent visit, the vaporized and unused cannabis will be 
weighed by [CONTACT_831644][INVESTIGATOR_831634]. Table 1 below outlines the amount of vaporized and oral study medication participants will 
be administered throughout the study.

Subjects will be instructed on the use of a vaporizer at the visit prior to Week 1. The manufacturer’s 
instructional brochure (Appendix 6) will be reviewed. In order to ensure consistency of dosing 
throughout the study, they will also be instructed on the use of the Foltin puff procedure at the visit 
prior to Week 1 (Appendix 7). A copy of both of these documents will be provided for review at home. 
 On completion of eight weeks of treatment or at the time of withdrawal from the study, patients 
will completely taper their cannabis over a period of one to two weeks to avoid withdrawal symptoms. 
Cannabis withdrawal symptoms will be measured via a phone call after Taper weeks 1 and 2 
(Appendix 8). Questions (Appendix 26) will be added to access subject’s beliefs of what they received 
(e.g., THC or placebo) after the first week and again after the eighth week. This will enable us to 
assess the effectiveness of blinding and thus report on the assay sensitivity of the study. The optimal

           If a subject does not participate in the driving simulation or the microbiome substudy, we will 
test their oral fluid for the presence of THC using the Draeger 5000. This will be done to exclude 
participants who use their own cannabis seeking pain relief because they were given placebo. 
 
An online questionnaire will be deployed (Appendix 27). Potential participants will complete this using 
HIPAA compliant software, the Platinum Edition of Survey Monkey. Please see 
https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/details/ for verification of the HIPAA compliance of this 
survey.  
Outcome Measures:  
 
DAILY TESTING IN SUBJECT’S RESIDENCE USING PAPER DIARY 
Medication intake: The timing and number of puffs of vaporized cannabis or placebo THC), oral 
medication (dronabinol or placebo), and breakthrough pain medication will be chronicled. (5 minutes)  
 REPEATED TESTING AT STUDY VISITS 
 
Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research Forms 
• Neurobehavioral Medical Screen: The clinician will fill this out to record any events that may 
have occurred between visits to confound results from the Neuropsychological testing such as an any trauma to the head or any open head wounds.  
• Behavior Notes Instrument: The clinician will fill this out during Neuropsychological testing to 
note confound variables associated with participant during the appointment.  
• Adverse Events Form: A form to be filled out by [CONTACT_831645]. 
 
NIH Task Force on CLBP Impact Score  
The impact score is a novel combination of 3 constructs; pain intensity, interference, and function. It is assembled in the Repeated Measures Recommended Minimal Dataset (Appendix 9).

 Pain Relief 
Neuropathic Pain Scale: This instrument has an ordinal scoring of one to ten for 
several characteristics of neuropathic pain.10, 11 Specifically, the responses measure pain 
characteristics such as intensity, sharpness ("like a knife"), burning ("on fire"), aching ("like a bruise"), 
cold ("freezing"), sensitivity ("like raw skin"), itching ("like poison oak"), unpleasantness ("intolerable"), 
and the amount of deep versus superficial pain. (5 minutes)  
 Mood Evaluation 
Profile of Mood States (POMS): The POMS measures six identifiable mood or affective states: 1) 
Tension-Anxiety 2) Vigor-Activity 3) Depression-Dejection 4) Fatigue-Inertia 5) Anger-Hostility 6) Confusion-Bewilderment. The POMS can be re-administered on a weekly basis, which is long 
enough to detect the respondent’s mood responses to his or her current life situation, but short 
enough to assess acute treatment effects. Sixty five items rated from 0 to 4 and scored in terms of 
total mood disturbance. 12 (10 minutes)

participants can rate depressive symptoms and attitudes from 0 to 3 in terms of intensity.13 We will 
measure clinical depression using the BDI-II and will include this measurement in analyses to provide 
an adjusted view of analgesia and side-effects. (3 minutes) 
 
Neuropsychological Testing

This pen and paper test involves having subjects substitute a series of symbols with numbers as quickly and accurately as possible during a [ADDRESS_1154254] substitutions.
14 (10 minutes). 
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT): The HVLT provides information on the ability to learn and 
immediately recall verbal information across trials, as well at the ability to retain, reproduce, and 
recognize this information after a delay.[ADDRESS_1154255] of 12 words (four words from each of three semantic 
categories) is presented to the subject over three trials.  After each trial, the subject is to recall as many items as possible from the list in any desired order.  A 20-minute delay follows the 
administration of the three trials, after which the subject is asked to recall the list.  Subjects are then 
read a list of [ADDRESS_1154256] are available. (10 minutes) 
Grooved Pegboard Test: This is a test of fine motor coordination and speed.
[ADDRESS_1154257] 25 small metal pegs into holes on a 3" x 3" metal board. All pegs are alike and have a ridge on one side, which corresponds to a notch in each hole on the board.  First the dominant 
hand is tested, and subjects are asked to place the pegs in the holes as fast as they can.  This is then 
repeated with the non-dominant hand, and the total time for each hand is recorded. (5 minutes) 
Psychomimetic Effects of Cannabis 
Marijuana subscale (M-scale) of the Addiction Research Center Inventory: The M-scale consists 
of 12 true or false questions corresponding to symptoms of cannabis intoxication; the maximum  
possible score is 12.[ADDRESS_1154258] week 
rather than an acute response to cannabis. (3 minutes)  
Sensory Testing 
Cold-Pressor Test (CPT): The cold-pressor apparatus will consist of two water coolers, fitted with a 
wire cradle and an aquarium pump for water circulation. One cooler will be filled with warm water (37 
°C) and the other with cold water (4 °C). Participants will remove jewelry from the hand and forearm 
at the beginning of the session; during the test, participants will be instructed to rest a hand with 
fingers spread apart on the wire cradle. Each CPT will begin with an immersion of the left hand into 
the warm water bath for 3 min. During this time, blood pressure and heart rate will be measured. After 
removal of the hand from the warm water, skin temperature of the thumbpad will be recorded and 
participants will listen to a standardized script describing the procedures (Appendix 11). Participants 
will then immerse the left hand into the cold water bath and will be instructed to report the first painful 
sensation after immersion. They will then be asked to tolerate the stimulus as long as possible, but will be permitted to withdraw their hand from the cold water at any point. Maximum immersion time 
will be [ADDRESS_1154259] feel pain (pain sensitivity) and latency to withdraw the hand from the 
water (pain tolerance) will be recorded. Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured before and 
after each immersion using the arm that was not immersed in the water bath.

Page 8 Microbiome Assays: 
Stool Sample: Participants will be asked to provide a stool sample, a saliva sample, and a blood 
sample at their first, second, and sixth experimental visit. Participants will provide up to 20 milliliters of 
blood and 10 milliliters of saliva per sample. The overall objective of collecting the blood sample is to 
investigate inflammatory markers or other biomarkers that relate to changes in the microbiome. The 
overall objective of collecting the saliva and stool samples is to assess the effects of oral administration 
vs. inhalation of exogenous cannabinoids on the gut microbiota, as well as downstream effects on gut and 
systemic inflammation and neurocognition. CB 1 and CB 2 ligands that increase gut barrier function 
(“gatekeepers”) are expected to result in reduced inflammation. Programmed death 1 (PD -1) and its 
ligand PD- L1 are expressed in inflammatory environments such as the intestinal epi[INVESTIGATOR_831635] a powerful 
approach to identify compounds produced by [CONTACT_831646]. We hypothesize that the composition of the gut microbiota 
may be altered (measured by 16S rDNA profiling) by [CONTACT_15376], in turn influencing inflammatory 
states, or alternatively, reduced inflammatory states may result in an alteration of the gut microbiota.  This 
will be a longitudinal su bstudy of an ongoing randomized clinical trial. Stool, saliva, and blood samples for 
microbiome analysis will be collected before participants receive study treatment 1 week after participants 
receive study treatment, and 8 weeks after participants receive  study treatment (dronabinol, vaporized 
cannabis, or placebo). Pre - and post- neurocognitive assessments will be done in all participants. The gut 
microbiota and relevant microbial metabolome will be assessed using a metabolite extraction and 
reconstitution protocol followed by [CONTACT_831647]/MS profiling in ESI negative mode.  We will measure 
markers of gut inflammation (PBMC PD -1/PDL-1), systemic inflammation (IL -6), microbial translocation 
(sCD14) and neurocognitive function. Oral THC is expected to have  the greatest impact on the gut 
microbiota due to higher local concentrations with this route of administration compared to vaporized 
cannabis. 
 
TESTING VIA TELEPHONE CALL AFTER TAPER PERIOD 
Cannabis Withdrawal Scale: The Cannabis Withdrawal Scale can be used as a diagnostic 
instrument in clinical and research settings where monitoring of withdrawal symptoms is required.22 
This will be performed after the 2-week tapering period has concluded. (10 minutes) If there was a 
previous adverse event or events (AE(s)), the Cannabis Solicited Adverse Events instrument will 
again be administered to ensure that the AE(s) have resolved. Participants will continue to be 
followed until there is resolution of the AE(s). 
 ARM #2. Driving Simulation: 
Subjects with drivers’ licenses will be scheduled for two experimental visits; one before they begin the 
randomized controlled trial, and a second visit after finishing their [ADDRESS_1154260] session for the randomized controlled trial prior to Week 1 (Appendix 12). 
 At the time of the second driving simulation visit, subjects will be assigned the same 
medication that they have been using during the randomized controlled trial. Using a Volcano 
Vaporizer, subjects will inhale the average number of puffs they had consumed per session 
throughout the four previous weeks of the randomized controlled trial. They will use the Vaporizer 
before Hour 2 and again before Hour 6 (Table 3). They will also take the same oral medication that 
was provided during the randomized controlled trial. In addition to examining the effects on driving 
simulation, acute effects of study medications on spontaneous pain and vital signs will be determined 
(Appendix 13). We will administer the simulator sickness assessment during the first [ADDRESS_1154261] for any illicit substances that is not prescribed by a physician. Should the participant screen positive for an illicit substance, they will either be asked to reschedule or be 
discontinued from the study at the Principal Investigator’s discretion. If this happens, participants will 
be compensated $10 for arriving to the scheduled appointment.  
During the Driving Simulation study visit, the participants will be given paper and pencil forms that 
measure the following:  
• Psychoactive Effects (including Drug Liking): A total of 15 separate VAS ratings will be presented at the time of driving simulation as a 100-mm horizontal line, anchored on the left with `not at all' and on the right with `extremely' (Appendix 10). Participants will pencil in a 
vertical line along the horizontal line that represents their current feeling (questions usually 
phrased, `During the past week, did you feel ___after consuming the vaporized cannabis?'). 
Ratings will be: any drug effect, a good drug effect, a bad drug effect, high, drunk, impaired, 
stoned, as if you liked the drug effect, sedated, confused, nauseous, like you desired more of 
the drug, anxious, down, and very hungry. Similar VAS questions have been shown to be 
sensitive and reliable subjective measures of cannabis intoxication.
17-20 (5 minutes) 
• Pain Relief: The degree of pain relief after taking the study medication will be assessed by [CONTACT_831648] (1) very much improved (2) much improved (3) 
minimally improved (4) no change (5) minimally worse (6) much worse (7) very much worse. 
• Pain Score: Participants will be asked to rate their pain before and after vaporizing marijuana 
between 0 = no pain and 10=worst possible pain.  
• Driving Simulation Self-Assessment: This comprises of a total of two questions to be asked 
hourly. They ask participants to rate how well they did on a VAS scale how well they believe 
they performed on the driving simulator and how much they believe their ability to perform on 
the driving simulator was affected by [CONTACT_5349].   
• Driving Test Questionnaire: This will be administered to evaluate for possible confounding 
variables on the day of the driving simulation. We will ask the participant how much they slept 
the previous night and about their experience with computer games. 
 
Sensory Testing 
The Cold Pressor Test administered at all study visits will also be administered during driving 
simulation [ADDRESS_1154262] vaporization, or perhaps greater (due to cumulative/residual effects). 
To minimize the novelty of the driving simulations, participants will complete a pretest training session 
to re-familiarize themselves with the hardware and the tasks that they are to encounter during the 
simulations. Four separate tasks will be embedded within the simulation.

  Driving simulations: Simulation hardware will consist of a 3-screen, wide field-of-view 
monitor setup, steering wheel, and accelerator and brake pedals. The fully interactive simulations will assess lane tracking (standard deviation of lateral position [SDLP], or “weaving”), response to divided 
attention stimuli (accuracy, response time), car following, and performance during scenarios 
simulating routine driving as well as crash avoidance situations.  
 
Participants in the simulator study will also be assessed for far visual acuity (Snellen Visual Acuity 
eye chart; need to have acuity of 20/40 or better, with or without correction), color vision, and contrast 
sensitivity (Vistech Contrast Sensitivity (Pelli-Robson Chart)). Participants will complete an orientation 
and practice drive prior to the initial simulation, in order to familiarize them with the controls and 
roadways. 
 
• Task 1: Lane Tracking/Divided attention: Participants will be instructed to maintain their 
lane position and speed, and respond to divided attention stimuli in the two corners of the 
monitor. The primary outcomes are standard deviation of lateral deviation (SDLP), latency and 
accuracy on the divided attention tasks, and speed deviation. SDLP is a measure of how well 
subjects maintain their lane position, providing an index for each subject’s road tracking error 
and ability to control the lateral motion of the car. It is primarily controlled by [CONTACT_831649]. SDLP has been shown to be 
sensitive to the effects of medications in both on-road and simulator studies (23-27). It has 
been examined in individuals under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, and MDMA, as well as 
with neurologic populations (28-32). SDLP has also demonstrated good test-retest reliability 
over short and long-term follow-ups (33-36).  (7 minutes) 
• Task 2: Car Following: The primary outcomes are (1) coherence between the participant and 
lead cars (a general correlation [0–1] of the participant’s ability to accurately track the speed variations of the lead car); (2) time delay (or the reaction time to changes in the lead car’s 
speed); and 3) distance from the lead car (7 minutes) 
• Task 3: Multi-tasking (Surrogate Reference Task [SuRT]): The primary outcomes are 
response latency and accuracy on the SuRT tasks. In addition, we will examine SDLP and 
speed deviation during this more challenging divided attention task. The SuRT is a visual

circles and requires participants to point to a target circle.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The level of difficulty is varied by [CONTACT_831650]. The equipment will be to the side of the monitor. Task conditions will include 
no search, easy, medium and hard searches (based upon the standard SuRT protocol). 
The SuRT is a measure of performance under high cognitive load and controlled 
processing, in that participants must divide their attention among three stimuli (roadway, 
speedometer, and events in the periphery), and is reflective of the workload generated by a 
real task (e.g., a GPS system). Face valid tasks such as navigation destination entry draw 
attention away from the road in highly variable ways (i.e. there tend to be large differences 
in how people attack problems associated with complex interactions). On the other hand, 
surrogate or structured tasks allow us to look at changes in attention in a more controlled 
fashion. This will enable us to address how participants under the influence of cannabis 
vary allocation strategies with workload. (5 minutes). 
• Task 4: Crash avoidance/decision-making: In order to assess treatment effects during 
routine and non-routine events we will include scenarios addressing 1) the “yellow light 
dilemma”, wherein individuals need to respond to a yellow light onset by [CONTACT_831651] 
(risking a rear-end collision), or go through the intersection (risking running a red light), and 2) 
crash avoidance. Participants will be instructed to drive 45mph, and will encounter [ADDRESS_1154263]. 
Consistent with [LOCATION_004] law (37), the yellow light phase (time before the yellow light turns 
red) will be 4.3s. The time available to perceive and respond to the yellow light will be held 
constant for all participants by [CONTACT_831652]’s 
velocity to determine the time-to-location (start of intersection). This will be set at 3.4, 3.0, 2.[ADDRESS_1154264] shown to elicit a range of responses (running 
the yellow light, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_007]) (38, 39). The primary outcomes will be stop/go percent and 
perception-reaction time (PRT; time of yellow onset to start braking or accelerating through the 
intersection), although a number of additional behavioral outcomes will be of interest. The 
simulation will also include a crash avoidance scenario in which the participant drives down a 
visually complex roadway (moving cars, pedestrians) and encounters the sudden appearance 
of a pedestrian, or car pulling out, in the roadway. Primary outcomes are the PRT to the 
incursion, and whether a collision occurs. Since an important aspect of this task is the 
unexpected nature of the event, the incursion point and object (vehicle, pedestrian) will vary 
across assessments (but be consistent across all participants).  (5 minutes) 
 
 
Performance- based tablet assessments: The following will be performed using an iPad with software 
designed by [CONTACT_831653] (119 Oakdale Campus Iowa City, IA  [ZIP_CODE] (319) 335 -4985 
http://www.digitalartefacts.com):

Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 12 § Critical Tracking: This test assesses the participant’s ability to adapt to an 
error signal in a first-order compensatory task, and has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of Δ9-THC. Participants use their finger to overcome 
built-in error in horizontal deviation from a midpoint by [CONTACT_831654]. However, the frequency, and velocity, of the deviations 
increases as a function of time. The primary outcome is the average lambda-
c across 5 trials. (5 minutes) 
§ Time estimation. Cannabis can affect time perception and estimation. 
Deficits in temporal processing could have significant implications for driving, 
for example in estimating the amount of time available to pass through a 
yellow light, or anticipating cross-traffic. We will thus administer a brief 
measure of time estimation. As recommended by [CONTACT_831655]., we will use 
an approach that minimizes the use of subvocal counting, which may 
artificially decrease variation that might occur during real-world multi-tasking. 
Five trials, with randomly generated durations ranging from 5 to 30s (e.g., 7, 
11, 29, 14, 23 seconds), will be generated. During each assessment, 
participants will complete the five trials. The participant will sit at a computer, 
and once the test starts will be presented with random letters in random parts 
of the screen. The participant is then to count the number of “M”s that appear 
until a second flash on the screen, at which point he/she is to announce the 
number of “M”s and the amount of time that has elapsed. The primary 
outcome is the ratio of estimated time to actual time. (3 minutes) 
§ Balance. Individuals may exhibit increased body sway when taking 
cannabis. To assess balance, participants will hold the iPad to their chest 
with their arms crossed, and their postural sway will be assessed while: 1) 
standing on both feet with eyes closed and 2) on a single foot and raising 
the other leg with the knee bent at [ADDRESS_1154265] will 
be calculated using the iPad triaxial accelerometer. 
§ Visual Spatial Memory Learning Test Cannabis can affect memory 
acutely. Variation in some aspects of cognitive performance has been found 
to be moderately and positively correlated with some individual aspects of 
the SFST; particularly among tasks which assess reaction time. Impairment 
of these cognitive processes can also contribute to the completion of 
complex tasks such as driving or the SFST. We will assess short term 
memory using a visual-spatial learning test (VSLT). This test is modeled after 
other tests of visuospatial memory (e.g., the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-
Revised, Visual Spatial Learning Test). The test requires the subject to a) 
memorize 5 designs that are difficult to verbally encode, b) recognize them 
among a group of 15 designs (8 foils) and c) recall the correct placement of 
these designs on a 6 X 4 matrix. Participants will complete one trial. The 
score is the number of figures correctly identified and placed. (2 minutes).  
  
Assays for Δ9-THC  in Plasma  
     For purposes of correlation with the above findings, serum levels of THC will be determined 
hourly. Blood will be collected in grey top (NaF) tubes tubes and then the tubes inverted 8-10 times to 
mix. EDTA plasma will be processed as soon as possible after collection. The tubes will be 
centrifuged at 400xg for 10 minutes to separate plasma and cells and then, using a transfer pi[INVESTIGATOR_8462], 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 13 plasma will be removed carefully to avoid disturbing the cell layer. The plasma will be transferred to 
1.8 ml cryovials and stored as plasma aliquots at –70C.      
     Δ9-THC and metabolites will be quantified using isotope dilution ultra-performance liquid 
chromatography (UPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using methodologies similar to what have been published. Briefly, deuterium labeled internal standards will be added and 
proteins will be precipi[INVESTIGATOR_831636]. Δ9-THC and CBD will be isolated using solid phase 
extraction and analyzed using electrospray ionization. Δ9-THC will be analyzed using positive ion 
electrospray while negative ion ESI will be used for CBD using Waters Xevo TQS equipped with 
Waters Acquity UPLC. The limit of quantification (LOQ) will be 0.5 ng/mL of each of the 
components in whole blood. Our laboratory at UCSD has been using similar methodologies to 
accurately quantify small molecules for many years (39). 
  
 
10. HUMAN SUBJECTS  
Total number of participants to be enrolled:   This will be a single site study with 120 participants 
enrolled at UCSD.  
Age: Because of the problems inherent in the use of cannabis in children and adolescents, we will not 
enroll individuals below the age of nineteen. Frequent use can affect school performance and 
relationships with family members in younger individuals 42, 43. Earlier and greater involvement with 
marijuana has also been associated with increased risk of poor mental health 44, 45.  
Gender: Both male and female populations develop chronic low back pain (CLBP); however, there is a 
tendency towards a higher incidence in males.  
Ethnic background:  CLBP is ubiquitous. Global studies have shown that low back pain is one of the 
most common complaints that patients bring to their physicians 46, 47. Given the diverse ethnic 
background of San Diego, we should be able to recruit subjects from multiple ethnic backgrounds. 
A neuropathic component has been found in approximately 37% of patients with CLBP 48; given the 
relative frequency of the latter, we should not encounter difficulty recruiting 120 participants. 
Health status: Individuals with significant cardiovascular, hepatic or renal disease, uncontrolled 
hypertension, and chronic pulmonary disease (eg, asthma, COPD), will be excluded. This will be operationalized using criteria from the literature on adverse effects of medicinal cannabis 
49, 50. 
 Inclusion criteria 
• Age greater than 18  
• Presence of chronic low back pain (CLBP) defined as the response to two questions 1) How 
long has back pain been an ongoing problem for you? 2) How often has low back pain been an 
ongoing problem for you over the past 6 months? A response of greater than 3 months to 
question 1 and a response of “at least half the days in the past 6 months” to question 2 will 
define CLBP according to the NIH Task Force on Research Standards for Chronic Low Back 
Pain (Appendix 15). 9. 
• Visual average numerical pain intensity greater than 3/10 during one-week observation period 
• To avoid confounding by [CONTACT_831656]/or prior cannabis exposure, participants 
will have had a stable analgesic regimen that they will continue throughout the study and not 
having used cannabis for more than [ADDRESS_1154266] experimental visit.   
 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 14 Exclusion criteria 
• Presence of another painful condition of greater severity than the back pain condition which is 
being studied.   
• History of traumatic brain injury. 
• Clinically significant or unstable medical condition. Individuals with significant cardiovascular, 
hepatic or renal disease, uncontrolled hypertension, and chronic pulmonary disease (eg, 
asthma, COPD), will be excluded. With respect to cardiovascular and pulmonary status, a 
clinician will screen participants with a tool developed for detection of congestive heart failure, 
coronary artery disease, obstructive and/or restrictive lung disease (Appendix 28 
Cardiopulmonary Screen). Hepatic and renal disease will be evaluated with liver and renal 
function laboratory tests. If warranted clinically, subjects will undergo further evaluation 
(urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and/or chest X-ray).  
• A positive result on toxicity screening will exclude individuals from participation.  A urine drug 
test that screens for 5 categories of drugs: marijuana (Δ9-THC), cocaine, amphetamines/methamphetamines, opi[INVESTIGATOR_858], benzodiazepi[INVESTIGATOR_831637] (PCP) will be 
employed. A positive result for opi[INVESTIGATOR_50942]/or THC will not be exclusionary if the patient is 
receiving a prescription for an opi[INVESTIGATOR_74527]/or THC.  
• Allergy to sesame oil, lactose, or gelatin   
• Vascular disease, especially Raynauld’s syndrome, systolic blood pressure > 170 mm, 
diastolic blood pressure > 100 mm 
• Recent injuries to the upper extremity  • Cognitive impairment, such as Dementia or Alzheimer’s Disease  • Substance Abuse History: individuals with current substance use disorders
[ADDRESS_1154267] (DAST-10) (a score greater than or equal to 3) and 
the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) (a score greater than or equal to 8 or a 
score greater than or equal to 7 if over 65 years old) (Appendix 31). 
• Pregnancy as ascertained by a mandatory commercial pregnancy test  
• Women who are lactating • History of schizophrenia, bipolar depression with mania, current suicidal ideation or past 
history of suicide attempt. Cannabis can exacerbate pre-existing schizophrenia, and has been 
linked to an increase in the risk of suicide in such patients.
[ADDRESS_1154268] that cannabis is contraindicated in individuals with serious mental health 
issues, a line of reasoning that will be observed in the present study by [CONTACT_831657]/schizoaffective/schizophrenic spectrum.  
• Suicidality. Exposure to cannabis does not lead to depression but it may be associated with 
suicidal thoughts and attempts58. Therefore, the BDI-II will be used to measure suicidal 
ideation.  
• Unwillingness to abstain from dronabinol for the rest of the study if taking dronabinol before 
study participation.   
 
11. RECRUITMENT AND PROCEDURES PREPARATORY TO RESEARCH  
     Four methods will be used for patient recruitment. First, a UCSD clinician may ask patients directly 
if they are interested in the study. For example, a UCSD Center for Pain Medicine clinician can 
provide interested patients with an information sheet about the study, including research staff contact 
[CONTACT_3031] (Appendix 1). Second, we will use ResearchMatch to send a recruitment message to 
potential participants who meet the criteria specified. (Appendix 3). Third, newspaper advertisements 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 15 will be utilized (Appendix 2). Fourth, ICD-9 code 724.2 will be used to identify pertinent potential 
subjects. The following PHI will be requested: patient name, mailing address, date of birth. This request (along with documentation of UCSD IRB approval) will be forwarded to database managers 
at the Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDWR) who will be asked to pull a subset of the data 
from the Electronic Health Record system to query patient information in a HIPAA-compliant manner. 
All recruitment methods will rely on potential subjects voluntarily initiating contact [CONTACT_831658]. 
 
Data Mining  
HIPAA Access to personal health information (PHI) will be requested through a waiver of consent and 
partial waiver of HIPAA Authorization for recruitment purposes. In order for a partial waiver of HIPAA 
authorization to be granted, we present the following options: 
 
 [ADDRESS_1154269]. All research staff will complete training for HIPAA and human subjects’ protections regulations and procedures. 
Confidentiality of participant data will be maintained through several mechanisms. All participants will 
be assigned identification numbers, and a list linking names and ID number will be stored separate 
from participant data in a locked file cabinet and electronically on a secure server. Access to this list 
will be restricted to the principal investigator, project manager and research assistant. Blood 
specimens will be stored in a -[ADDRESS_1154270]-protected account.  
 
2. Justification as to why these procedures could not a) practicably be done without the waiver, and 
b) be done without access to, use, or disclosure of the PHI;  
The proposed study cannot be done without the specified information because PHI is required in 
order to contact [CONTACT_831659]. We will only collect 
minimal PHI necessary to distinguish patients who have chronic lower back pain who may qualify for 
the study. Once they have been identified, patients who agree to participate in the study will be 
consented and authorization will be obtained.   
 
3. Justification that the privacy risk to individuals whose PHI will be used or disclosed is minimal and 
reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefit, if any, to the individuals;  
PHI acquired for the purposes of recruitment will not be disclosed to any other agency, party or 
individual (other than the sponsor (NIDA), FDA and UCSD research compliance personnel). Evidence 
of UCSD IRB approval will be required to obtain this document from NIDA. 
 
4. What PHI will be used and who will access, use or disclose the PHI.  ICD-9 code 724.2 will be 
used to identify pertinent potential subjects.  The following PHI will be requested: patient name, 
mailing address, date of birth. This request (along with documentation of UCSD IRB approval) will be 
forwarded to database managers at the Clinical Data Warehouse for Research (CDWR) who will be 
asked to pull a subset of the data from the Electronic Health Record system to query patient 
information in a HIPAA-compliant manner.

12. INFORMED CONSENT  
Process To Be Followed For Obtaining Consent/Assent/Permission And HIPAA Authorization. 
     We request a waiver of documented consent for conducting the phone screening. This part of the research, i.e., the telephone interview, presents no more that minimal risk of harm to subjects and 
involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the research context. 
If a subject qualifies for the study and decides to participate, the screening information will be kept 
with their research record. If they not qualify for the study, the screening information will be 
destroyed.  
  
1. Potentials volunteers will be screened via telephone interview (Appendix 16) and, as 
appropriate, via face-to-face assessment. Telephone screening (respondents blind to selection 
criteria) will assure volunteers meet general age and medical criteria. For those subjects 
interested in proceeding to a face-to-face assessment, a consent form will be mailed with 
instructions to peruse the document. The intent of this is to allow sufficient time for the 
prospective participant to consider whether to participate; a step to be taken to minimize the 
possibility of coercion or undue influence. 
2. The Research Associate will obtain consent /authorization. The person in this position will 
undergo CITI training to gain requisite knowledge to perform the consent /authorization 
process. S/he will have sufficient knowledge of the study to answer any questions regarding 
the study. S/he will explain the research activity, how it is experimental (e.g., a new drug, extra 
tests, separate research records, or nonstandard means of management, such as flippi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a 
coin for random assignment or other design issues). S/he will inform the human subjects of the 
reasonably foreseeable harms, discomforts, inconvenience and risks that are associated with 
the research activity. Information communicated to the participant/parent or legally authorized 
representative during the consent/assent/permission process will not include exculpatory 
language through which the participant is made to waive or appear to waive any of the 
participant’s legal rights or release or appear to release the Researcher, Sponsor, the 
University or its agents from liability for negligence. 
3. The Investigator will retain the original consent form and HIPAA authorization in a master 
research file. An electronic copy of the signed informed consent and HIPAA authorization will 
also be inserted into the electronic Medical Record alerting other providers of the subject’s 
participation in this research protoco l.  
13. ALTERNATIVES TO STUDY PARTICIPATION  
     The therapeutic alternatives that are reasonably available that may be of benefit to a potential 
participant include standard of care measures; e.g., spi[INVESTIGATOR_197974], acupuncture, biofeedback, 
cognitive -behavioral therapy , massage  and/or a comprehensive rehabilitation programs .

Page 18 • Economic harm: Eligibility for insurance, political campaigns, and standing in the community are 
problems may result from loss of confidentiality. Vaporizing marijuana may hinder application for future employment, if drug screening is a condition of employment. It is likely that detectable 
traces of marijuana will remain in the subject’s hair or blood for a minimum of six weeks after 
vaporizing. If applicable, a letter will be written to the subject’s employer explaining their 
participation in this research study and the dates of participation.  Confidential information regarding your history, DNA information (genetic risk for certain diseases), substance use or 
health diagnosis may become known outside of the research setting. 
• Reproductive risks: The procedures in this research are known to hurt a pregnancy or fetus in 
the following ways: poor educational attainment. A participant should not become pregnant or 
father a baby [CONTACT_59617]. 
Women should not breastfeed a baby [CONTACT_56035]. Subjects will need to use birth control 
while on this study. Acceptable methods of birth control are: oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353], diaphragm 
and condom with spermicide, progestin implant, intrauterine contraceptive device.  
• Unknown Risks: The experimental treatments may have side effects that no one knows about 
yet. The researchers will let subjects know if they learn anything that might make you change your mind about participating in the study.  
 
15. RISK MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES AND ADEQUACY OF RESOURCES  
At every study visit, stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_88414]: 
Pulse: an irregular pulse or pulse rate > 110 beats per minute Blood Pressure: systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg or diastolic  > 110 mmHg 
 Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]: respi[INVESTIGATOR_697] > 20 breaths per minute 
Pulse: an irregular pulse or pulse rate greater than 110 beats per minute will result in 
cessation of participation and, if deemed advisable by a study clinician, transfer to the 
emergency department (across the street from our research center). 
 
Blood Pressure: If the systolic blood pressure is ≥ 160 to < 180 mmHg  or the diastolic is  
≥ 100 to < [ADDRESS_1154272] pain, dyspnea, irregular heartbeat, and/or palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814]. 
Final determination regarding possible discontinuation will be made by a study 
investigator. If discontinued from the study, the participant will be asked to have their 
blood pressure evaluated by [CONTACT_831660]. If the 
systolic blood pressure is > 180 mmHg or the diastolic is  > 110 mmHg, the participant 
will be discontinued from the study and either be transferred to the emergency 
department or be asked to visit their primary care physician as soon as possible. The end organ response to the blood pressure will guide the clinician’s decision (e.g., the 
development of angina pectoris or hemiplegia will mandate transfer to the emergency 
department). 
 
Respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520]: shortness of breath will result in potential cessation of participation and 
possible transfer to the emergency department following evaluation by a study clinician, 
who will consult with the study investigator. 
 
A locally developed self-report instrument, the Cannabis Solicited Adverse Events (Appendix 
29) will be administered to assess distress from psychological effects of cannabis. This will be 
performed on a prn basis by [CONTACT_831661] 19 administration session. The items on this instrument ask participants about experiencing 
anxiety, paranoia, and hallucinations. Excess intoxication will also be assessed using this instrument which asks participants about their having dizziness, drowsiness, confusion, 
emotional changes, and/or cognitive changes. Positive responses to these items, if Grade 2, 3 
or 4 (see below for definitions), will result in notification of a study clinician who will speak with 
the participant to see if discontinuation of participation in the study would be in her or his best 
interest. 
 
Using the Cannabis Solicited Adverse Events instrument mentioned above, an Adverse Events 
Form (Appendix 30) will be completed. Adverse events will be characterized as 1 = Mild, 2 = 
Moderate, 3 = Severe, and 4 = Life Threatening using the following definitions (consistent with 
those used by [CONTACT_29630]): 
 
 
 Inasmuch as the scoring of Grades 2, 3, and 4 mention that an intervention is indicated, AEs 
with Grades 2 or 3 will be brought to the attention of a study clinician so that s/he may interact 
with the participant to determine if discontinuation of study participation is warranted. This will 
be done in consultation with an investigator. Grade 4 AEs will be managed by [CONTACT_831662]. There 
will also be a determination of whether the AE is related, possibly related or not related to the 
study by [CONTACT_831663] 1 to 4.  
 
Furthermore, the participant will be followed by [CONTACT_831664](s) 
resolve. This might include recommending that the participant see their primary care physician 
(e.g., for a change in blood pressure medication).  
 Risks will also be mitigated using the following measures: 
• Preventing children and adolescents from gaining access to medicinal cannabis because of 
potential harm to their well-being. Subjects will be required to store cannabis in an area of their 
home that would prevent anyone else from discovering its location. 
• Because some people cannot control their use of cannabis, we will not allow patients with 
recent substance abuse histories (less than 12 months) to participate.  
• We will exclude patients if they are pregnant or refuse to exercise birth control if engaging in 
sexual activities that could result in pregnancy, have a heart disease or heart rhythm problem 
or have a history of serious mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia, mania, or a history of 
hallucinations or delusions)  
• In order to avoid carcinogens, we will have subjects use a vaporizer rather than smoke joints or 
use a water pi[INVESTIGATOR_5836]. 

 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 20 • We will instruct subjects not to drive a car or operate heavy machinery for 3-[ADDRESS_1154273] to go out sooner 
than 3-4 hours after taking this medicine.  
• As the response to cannabis varies widely, participants will titrate to effect and in essence use 
the minimum amount of medicinal cannabis needed to obtain relief from pain.  
• A cannabis withdrawal syndrome will be under surveillance for two weeks; difficulty with getting 
to sleep and angry outbursts might require that they withdraw from the cannabis more slowly. 
 
The UCSD Department of Psychiatry (Appendix 17) is committed to providing the resources and 
other supports (e.g., data management and information systems, statistical, and physical 
performance site) to ensure the timely implementation, conduct, and completion of this program. 
 
Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
     A DSMB will be selected utilizing a group of experts that will advise the study investigators, with 
the primary responsibility to monitor human subject safety. The members will be comprised of at least 
[ADDRESS_1154274] agents and target population 
under study. The DSMB will review the protocol, including the safety monitoring plan, and identify any 
major concerns prior to implementation. During the trial the DSMB will review: 
 
1. Real-time and cumulative safety data for evidence of study-related adverse events,  
    unanticipated problems 
2. Factors that might affect the study outcome or compromise the trial data (such as protocol  
    violations, losses to follow-up) 
3. Staff performance for protection of privacy, confidentiality, and maintenance of secured  
    databases 
4. Progress of interventional trial, including periodic assessments of data quality and 
timeliness, participant recruitment, accrual and retention. 
 
     The DSMB should conclude each review with each member’s recommendation as to whether the 
study should continue or be modified. Recommendations for modification of the design and conduct 
of the study may include corrective action when performance is unsatisfactory. Confidentiality must 
always be maintained during all phases of DSMB review and deliberations. The DSMB report will 
include the participants' demographic characteristics, expected versus actual recruitment rates, 
treatment retention rates, any quality assurance or regulatory issues that occurred during the past 
year, a summary of all and serious adverse events, and any actions or changes with respect to the 
protocol.  
16.PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING DATA ACCESS AND MANAGEMENT   
     As stated above in Section 11, [ADDRESS_1154275] information (Appendix 1). Second, a list of patients meeting specific ‘International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems’ (ICD-9 724.2) criteria for chronic low back 
pain will be sent an informational letter informing them about the study and inviting them to contact 
[CONTACT_831665] (Appendix 1). Third, newspaper 
advertisements may be used (Appendix 2). All recruitment methods will rely on potential subjects 
voluntarily initiating contact [CONTACT_831666], an “opt-in” approach.

Once protected health information (PHI) is obtained, measures to protect privacy and confidentiality will be implemented. This will include coding, removal of identifying information, limiting access to 
data, and the use of a Certificates of Confidentiality that will be applied for from the National Institute 
of Drug Abuse following IRB approval. Physical safeguards for research data will include storage of 
paper records in locked files, separation of personal identifiable demographics data from study data 
referenced only to a unique study ID. Electronic records will be maintained on a HIPAA Compliant 
server using password protection.  
 
All laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other records will be identified only by a 
coded number in order to maintain confidentiality. All records will be kept in a locked file cabinet.  All 
computer entry and networking programs will be done with coded numbers only.  All stored samples 
are accessible only to the HNRP laboratory personnel and the appropriate study members. Samples 
are stored under the coded identifiers in freezers equipped with locks, behind locked doors requiring 
ID scan entry.  
      
     The consent process will be performed under conditions to insure privacy and confidentiality. It will 
take place in a private exam room in the Department of Psychiatry, [ADDRESS_1154276]. San Diego, CA. 
Should interviewee disclose suicidal ideation (Appendix 18), further evaluation will take place. 
Important elements of the history that permit appraisal of the seriousness of suicidal ideation include the intent, plan, and means; the availability of social support; previous suicide attempts; and the 
presence of comorbid psychiatric illness or substance abuse. After intent has been established, 
outpatient management will be sought. 
17. POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
     There is no direct benefit to subjects. 
18. RISK/BENEFIT RATIO  
    There is a substantial disconnect between the therapeutic use of cannabis and research on the 
risks and benefits of this practice. Although edible marijuana merchandise has become widely available at medical dispensaries, there is little information in the literature on the medical efficacy of 
these products 
62. Pharmacologic oral preparations, which like the edible products, avoid deleterious 
effects upon the respi[INVESTIGATOR_2133], have had more attention from the scientific community  63-69. 
However, some experts have opi[INVESTIGATOR_831638], e.g., synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (dronabinol, Marinol®) and/or the 
synthetic analog of Δ9-THC (nabilone,Cesamet®). As testament to this belief, oral cannabinoids have 
been on the market in the [LOCATION_002] for many years and are not widely used 70. Peak plasma 
concentrations occur 1 to 6 hours after ingestion, with a magnitude approximately 10% of that achieved with smoking 
71. As a result of the pharmacokinetics of oral preparations, it has been 
postulated that the preference expressed by [CONTACT_831667] a result of the faster onset and shorter duration of action allowing titration of dose to the desired effect 
72. The present study will 
compare the risk benefit ratio of herbal cannabis to an oral preparation (dronabinol).  We know that cannabinoids appear to have some benefit in alleviating a heterogeneous collection of neuropathic 
pain conditions 
2, 3. Preliminary recommendations have been issued from the College of Family 
Physicians in Canada to help guide clinicians in prescribing cannabis for the treatment of for chronic noncancer pain 
73. But we do not know if chronic low back pain will respond to cannabis (or 
dronabinol).  
19. EXPENSE TO PARTICIPANT  
     There will no expense  for participants  other that the cost of travel/parking . 
20. COMPENSATION FOR PARTICIPATION  
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page [ADDRESS_1154277] payments are requested in order to compensate subjects for their participation. Total 
compensation could equal $960.  
Participants will be asked to arrange for transportation to and from the research site. For the 
screening appointment, participants will receive $40. For the baseline visit, participants will be given 
$10 for their arrival. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_1154278], second, and sixth experimental visits, they 
will receive $60. Participants will receive $[ADDRESS_1154279], second, and sixth experimental visits, they will receive $60. We 
will budget $20 per week x10 weeks equals $200 and $65 per visit x6 visits equals $390. The total 
per subject payment will be $760 for visits. Compensation will be pro-rated if the subjects does not 
complete by [CONTACT_831668].  
 
    For the baseline driving visit, participants will receive $20. In addition, we will pay subjects for one 
other driving session. In this driving session, we are budgeting $20 per hour for 9 hours equals $[ADDRESS_1154280] does 
not complete driving simulation at $20 per hour. The total compensation for both driving visits will be 
$200. 
 
Inasmuch as participants will be given a vaporizer worth $600 to take home and use, they will not be 
compensated for their visits and weekly journals until study completion and after they return the 
vaporizer. Should they withdraw from the study prematurely, they will be compensated for completed 
visits but still be required to return the vaporizer they were given in order to be compensated.

This study will be funded by [CONTACT_831669] 1R01DA038634-01A1 "A 
Randomized, Cross-Over Controlled Trial of Dronabinol and Vaporized Cannabis in Neuropathic Low 
Back Pain"  
23. BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS TRANSFER AGREEMENT  
N/A  
24. INVESTIGATIONAL DRUG FACT SHEET AND IND/IDE HOLDER  
IND [ADDRESS_1154284] for vaporized cannabis. Barth Wilsey 
MD is the IND holder (subsequently transferred to [CONTACT_831672]). The IND Acknowledgement and 
Form 1572 from 2008 are attached (Appendices 20 and 21). An email from the FDA official is 
attached stating that the IND is may be used for the present study (Appendix 22). 
     The investigational drug will be handled by [CONTACT_831670]. Accountability 
records will be maintained according to policies and procedures (Appendix 23). This has been 
discussed with the UCSD Investigational Pharmacy. Sign out logs will be kept as dictated by [CONTACT_831671]. At the end of each experimental session and/or study visit, all unused materials will 
be collected and stored in a sealed container that will be returned to the UCSD Investigational 
Pharmacy, with the exact amount noted and dated in the log (e.g., “bulk cannabis weighing x mg”). All 
records will be made available to the DEA and the Research Advisory Panel of [LOCATION_004], which 
supervises all controlled substance research in [LOCATION_004]. At the end  of the study, all unused plant 
 
 
Biomedical IRB Application Instructions  
Page 27 material (i.e., cannabis not vaporized or the debris from vaporization) from each subject’s 8 week 
treatment period and, if applicable, driving simulation session will be collected and placed in a container, which will disposed at the facility used to incinerate unwanted medical or containment 
materials.  
25. OTHER APPROVALS/REGULATED MATERIALS  
     No other UCSD review committees have reviewed and approved/authorized this study or are 
currently reviewing the study. However, we have multiple federal and state reviews that are being conducted.  Marijuana is currently classified at the highest (most restrictive) level as a Schedule I 
drug (no accepted medical use, high potential for abuse). U.S. investigators are subject to specific 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) regulations concerning 
research with controlled substances. These reviews are described below: 
 
DEA:  Under the Controlled Substances Act (21 USC 822 (a)(1)) and implementing DEA 
regulations, persons conducting clinical research with any controlled substance must register with the DEA, keep specific types of records, provide evidence of safety precautions to prevent 
diversion, and periodically report to the DEA. The PI, Barth Wilsey, has maintained a Schedule I 
license to study marijuana for over a decade. The DEA in Washington is awaiting UCSD IRB 
approval and will then have the San Diego Branch inspect the UCSD Investigational Pharmacy to 
insure that the facility meets their guidelines for secure handling of cannabis.  
 
FDA:  Barth Wilsey, has an IND to study vaporized cannabis. A document was made to them earlier 
this year providing the background on the present proposal.  
 
NIDA:  The source of marijuana will be the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA); they will not

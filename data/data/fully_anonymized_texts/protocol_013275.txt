Version 8.0: [ADDRESS_357002]  
The arrival of High -Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) technology along with advances in 
prostate imaging may make focal gland ablation feasible.  While the mainstays of therapy for 
clinically localized prostate cancer, surgery and radiation therapy, induce significant morbidity 
such as urinary  incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction due to by[CONTACT_292632] -gland treatment, HIFU permits focal destruction of prostate cancers, which has the 
potential to minimize these morbidities and maximize quality of life.  Advances in prostate MRI  
allow the majority of high grade cancers to be detected.  S oftware platforms exist that enable real -
time fusion of prostate MRI images with ultrasound, which allows for targeting of prostate lesions 
found on MRI during transrectal biopsy.  The confluence of all of this technology —HIFU, 
multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) , and MR/US -fusion targeting —creates the possibility of highly 
targeted focal ablation of prostate cancers. Nonrandomized clinical trials of hemigland and focal 
ablation with HIFU in Europe have shown promising trifecta rates —cancer control, potency, & 
continence —up to 1y post -treatment.   
 
While early results of HIFU therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer are promising, the 
effectiveness of HIFU therapy will ultimately be limited by [CONTACT_292633].  Because prostate cancer is often multifocal, identificatio n of all clinically relevant 
prostate cancer lesions is critical to complete treatment of the disease, whether it is hemigland or 
true focal ablation.  Modern mpMRI is unable to detect 20% of high -grade cancer and 
approximately 50% of low -grade cancers.  T o address this shortcoming , our team  at Cedars -Sinai  
has developed high -resolution prostate MRI (hrMRI) technology that improves resolution [ADDRESS_357003] multiparametric MRI.  (1)  High-resolution imaging has been shown to 
detect 60% of tumors not seen on standard MRI. (2)  Pairing this technology with PET may allow 
highly specific targeting for focal therapy. Because the oncological effectiveness of focal therapy 
depends on robust targeting, PET -hrMRI could  provide a significant advantage in cancer control 
outcomes for HIFU.   
 
We herein propose a prospective  trial to evaluate the effectiveness of F18-PSMA  PET-hrMRI  
versus standard mpMRI at identifying prostate cancer targets for HIFU therapy.  Patients with 
clinically localized , unilateral high grade prostate cancer ( Gleason score 7 -10 prostate cancer  
localized to one lobe on prior biopsies ) OR at high risk for having unrecognized high grade 
prostate cancer ( overall Gleason score 6 with > half of systematic biopsy cores positive and > 
50% of core involvement in at least one core ), interested in HIFU would receive both a standard 
mpMRI and F18-PSMA  PET-hrMR I.  They would then undergo a mappi[INVESTIGATOR_292589] a 
standard sextant template plus MR I/US-fusion targeted biopsy of any suspi[INVESTIGATOR_292590]-hrMRI . The primary endpoint would assess the number of biopsy -proven cancers that 
mpMRI would have missed compared with PET-hrMRI . Following our tumor mappi[INVESTIGATOR_48633], 
patients with high grade disease (i.e. Gleason grade 4 or 5) in one lobe undergo hemigland or 
focal HIFU of that lobe. At [ADDRESS_357004].  Since the  true location of all tumors will be known, both the sensitivity 
and specificity of PSMA -PET MRI can be determined

Version 8.0: 08 November  2023 2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Prostate Cancer:  Current Standard of Care in Treatment  
 
Prostate cancer is the most common non -cutaneous cancer and the second -leading cause 
of cancer mortality in American men, accounting for 25% (192,280) of new cancer 
diagnoses and 9% (27,360) of male cancer deaths (3). Clinically localized prostate cancer 
accounts for the vast majority of new cancer diagnoses, with an estimated 91% of new 
cases diagnosed at local or regional stages (3).  Traditional t reatment options  for localized 
disease  vary widely, from watchful waiting or active surveillance to aggressive treatment 
with surgery, radiation therapy, or brachytherapy.  Active surveillance is considered the 
standard -of-care for low grade (e.g. Gleason score 3+3=6) prostate cancers and even 
some intermediate risk cancers .  On active surveillance, patients with long life expectancy 
who develop a component of high Gleason grade cancer (i.e. Gleason grade 4 or 5) are 
recommended to have defi nitive local therapy such as prostatectomy or radiation.  While 
aggressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_292591] , they 
are fraught with side effects that can significantly affect quality of life, including erectile 
dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel dysfunction (4-7).  Even recent advances in 
robotic surgery and radiation techniques have not appeared to significantly reduce the 
long-term morbidities of definitive local therapy.  
2.2 HIFU:  Historical Background and FDA Approval  
 
High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) is a noninvasive therapy that precisely delivers 
ablative ultrasonic energy to deep tissues through skin and mucosa, allowing for 
transrectal focal ablation of prostate cancers.  While the mainstays of therapy for c linically 
localized prostate cancer induce significant morbidity such as urinary incontinence, 
erectile dysfunction, and bowel dysfunction due to by[CONTACT_292634] -gland 
treatment, HIFU permits focal destruction of prostate cancers by [CONTACT_292635]; these approaches have the potential to minimize 
morbidities associated with whole -gland treatment and thereby [CONTACT_292636].  
HIFU treatment (primarily hemigland and whole -gland) has been used extensively over 
the last fifteen years in Europe, Canada, and Mexico, and there are numerous articles 
describing its safety and effectiveness for this application in the Urology literature.  
 
While HIFU therapy has a long track record abroad, it has only recently been approved 
for prostate ablation in the US. In October 2015, the FDA gave de novo clearance to the 
Sonablate 450 HIFU platform (manufactured by [CONTACT_292637]) for the ablation of  
prostate tissue, making it the first to be approved for this indication in the US.  In November 
2015, the Ablatherm HIFU platform (manufactured by [CONTACT_292638]) was given 510(k) 
clearance for the same indication.  While the approvals for these devices do no t 
specifically mention application to prostate cancer, academic and industry leaders are 
hailing this technology as a major advance for focal prostate therapy, hinting that this 
technology can avoid the morbidities of surgery for prostate cancer.  Local ac ademic 
centers have already begun to use and market this technology . 
2.3 HIFU:  International Experience with Prostate Cancer Treatment  
 
HIFU therapy has been a mainstay of prostate cancer care in Europe, Canada, and Mexico 
for the last fifteen years, and cancer control and side effect outcomes have been very 
________________________________________________________________________  
IIT2020 -14-Dagnolo -HIFU       Page 6 of 40 
Version 8.0: [ADDRESS_357005] to tumor mix and 
ablation zone (whole -gland and hemigland). 5 -year disease free survival rates were 61 –
95%.  Common complications associated with HIFU were urinary retention (<1 –20%), UTI 
(2–48%), stress urinary incontinence of any degree (<1 –34%), and erectile dysfunction 
(20–86%).  Rare complications included recto -urethral fistula (<2%), bladder neck 
stenosis, urethral stricture, perineal pain, urinary obstruction, epi[INVESTIGATOR_95541], and prostatitis. 
The largest institutional series of hemigland HIFU for low - (25%) and interme diate -risk 
(75%) prostate cancers suggested even better results, with return of erectile function for 
penetrative sex in 95% of men, 90% pad -free and leak -free continent, and 89% had no 
histological evidence of cancer at 6 months.  89% of men reached the t rifecta status of 
pad-free, leak -free continence, erections sufficient for intercourse, and cancer control at 
12 months. (8) True focal therapy is in a nascent stage of development, but early results 
are similar to hemigland treatment.  In a prospective study of 42 men with low - and 
intermediate -risk cancer at University College London, 95% (95% CI 83 –99%) were 
cancer free on bi opsy at 12 months and 84% (95% CI 66 –95%) reached trifecta status. (9)  
These results, though admittedly in highly selected populations, are clear improvements 
on cancer control and quality of life outcomes in modern surgical and radiation cohorts.  
 
2.4 MRI for Prostate Cancer Imaging  
 
Multiparametric MRI  (mpMRI)  combining T2 -weighted, diffusion -weighted, and dynamic 
contrast enhanced (DCE) images is quickly becoming part of the standard of care  for 
detection and localization of prostate cancer. (10, 11)   Prostate MRI has been shown to 
have high sensitivity and specificity for high -grade prostate cancers, with approximately 
80% false negative rate for detection of Gleason 7 or higher tumors.  The Prostate 
Imaging -Reporting and Data System (PI -RADS) scoring system  is a widely accepted 
rating system for estimating risk of cancer, using a 1 –5 scale to provide clinicians with an 
estimate for likelihood of cancer; this scale uses T2 -weighted imaging, diffusion weighted 
imaging, dynamic contrast -enhancement, and  MRI spectroscopy to inform this 
assessment.  Some variations on this scale, such as the UCLA prostate MRI scoring 
system, give more weight to the diffusion -weighted imaging component, since it is the 
component providing the most predictive utility.    
 
Diffusion -weighted imaging (DWI) is sensitive to the diffusion of water molecules 
interacting with surrounding macromolecules.  DWI, which provides a quantitative 
biological parameter called apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, is a robust MRI 
param eter for differentiating benign and malignant prostate tissue. (12, 13)  In fact, the 
latest version of the Prostate Imaging -Reporting and Data System (PI -RADS) scoring 
system relies almost exclusively on DWI to identify tumors in the peripheral zone, which 
is where the vast majority of prostate cancers form. Findings on T2 images are not used 
to identify cancer , and DCE images are only used to differentiate between some PI -RADS 
3 and 4 lesions. In a pi[INVESTIGATOR_292592], DW -MRI was useful for detecting 
progression of Gleason score based on changes in ADC value. (14)  Tumor size is an 
important clinical criterion for defining low risk prostate cancer, and tumor size based on  
DWI has been shown to crudely  predict low risk prostate cancer. (15) However, 
conventional DWI using single -shot echo -planar imaging is unable to detect small 
tumors (16) or detect small changes in tumor size on serial imaging.

Version 8.0: 08 November  2023 2.5 High -Resolution Prostate MRI (hrMRI)  
 
Over the last several years, our group  at Cedars -Sinai  has developed technology to 
improve resolution of standard mpMRI, allowing for improved detection of smaller tumors.  
(1, 2)   By [CONTACT_2329] a  three -dimensional (3D) high -resolution diffusion -weighted imaging 
sequence  (HR-DWI) , image quality is improved and confers  a 5-fold improvement in 
resolution when compared to standard two -dimensional (2D) DWI (S -DWI).  This novel 3D 
DWI technique has been developed by [CONTACT_292639] 1.5T or  
3T MRI system s.  S-DWI suffers from two important limitations. a) It uses single -shot echo -
planar imaging  (EPI)  for data acquisition, which produces magnetic susceptibility  induced 
streaking artifacts and geometric distortions so that round objects may appear oval.  b) 
The relatively low signal -to-noise ratio and 2D image acquisition with  S-DWI limit spatial 
resolution, which is defined by [CONTACT_292640]. Our hrMRI incorporating HR -DWI overcomes these limitations by 
[CONTACT_292641], multi -shot, turbo -spin-echo acquisition, which improves 
signal -to-noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution, and image quality, and eliminat es geometr ic 
distortion s and streaking artifacts associated with EPI .   
In a prospective  study assessing the performance of hrMRI  in [ADDRESS_357006] mpMRI predicted  biopsy results (AUC 0.72, Fisher's exact p<0.001 ), 
but high -resolution DWI sequences  allowed MP -MRI to be more highly predictive of biopsy 
results (AUC 0.88, Fisher's exact p<0.001).  hrMRI  had a sensitivity of 95.7% and identified 
tumor in [ADDRESS_357007] mpMRI 
had a sensitivity of 60.9% and only identified 14 of 23 biopsy -positive zones (p=0.004).  In 
all, hrMRI was  shown to de tect 60% of tumors not seen on standard MRI .  
2.6 PSMA and PET -MRI in Prostate Cancer  
 
Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has been increasingly used for detection of 
occult distant metastases in patients with advanced prostate cancer using prostate -
cancer -specific radiotracers (PSMA) or radiotracers that accumulate preferentially wit hin 
prostate cancer tissue (11C choline, 11C acetate, and 18F fluciclovine).  Prostate -specific 
membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II membrane protein originally characterized by [CONTACT_292642] (mAb) 7E11 -C5. [ADDRESS_357008] imaging.  While mpMRI is a very sensitive 
imaging modality for identifying localized prostate cancers, its specificity is limited; co -
localization of tumors identified on MRI with PET imaging may be able to improve 
specificity to account for this limitation.  
 
Early work has suggested that co -localization of this PET radiotracer with 3 -D mpMRI 
imaging may enhance accuracy of localization of intraprostatic cancer lesions compared 
with mpMRI or PET/CT alone.  In a study of 21 patients who underwent 18F -fluciclovine  
PET/CT and mpMRI prior to radical prostatectomy, combined 18F -fluciclovine PET/CT 
and mpMRI imaging yielded a positive predictive value of 82% for tumor localization, which 
________________________________________________________________________  
IIT2020 -14-Dagnolo -HIFU       Page 8 of 40 
Version 8.0: [ADDRESS_357009] that pairing also F18-PSMA  PET imaging with MRI directly may 
improve localization of cancers within the prostate for HIFU treatment planning.  We 
hypothesize that further leveraging the sensitivity and spatial resolution of hrMRI with the 
specificity of PET imaging may further enha nce performance in accurately identifying 
cancers within the prostate.   
2.7 MR/US -Fusion for Targeting of Prostate Cancers  
 
The advent of improved prostate imaging using multiparametric MRI and PET have 
dovetailed with advances in fusion software platforms that offer the ability to overlay static 
MRI images with real -time ultrasound images at the time of biopsy.  This technolog y, called 
MR-US fusion, allows clinicians to target potential regions of interest in the prostate seen 
on mpMRI during an transrectal ultrasound -guided biopsy.  Targeted MR -US fusion 
biopsies have been shown to significantly improve sensitivity and overall  accuracy of 
biopsy over standard sextant biopsy by 24% and 14%, respectively.  Most academic 
centers now offer MR -US fusion biopsies for patients with persistent rising PSA after 
negative standard biopsy and for surveillance biopsies while on active surve illance.  MR -
US fusion techniques are also being applied to focal ablation of prostate cancers with 
HIFU; both the Sonablate and Ablatheram HIFU pla tforms have announced partnerships 
with MR -US fusion companies to provide targeting during tumor ablation wi th HIFU.  
However, despi[INVESTIGATOR_30460], the accuracy of targeted biopsy and targeted focal 
therapy is necessarily limited by [CONTACT_292643].   
2.8 Combining MR/US -Fusion, hrMRI, and PET -MRI with HIFU for Focal 
Treatment of Prostate Cancer  
 
Because the oncological effectiveness of HIFU depends on robust mappi[INVESTIGATOR_292593], improved detection of lesions using hrMRI and/or PET -MRI 
could provide a significant advantage in HIFU cancer control outcomes.  Patients who are 
eligible for hemigland and focal HIFU absolutely depend on imaging for treatment 
planning; for example, in a patient with an index lesion of the right side of the prostate 
only, if imaging fails to detect a small focus of prostate cancer present on  the left, 
hemigland HIFU (only treating the right side of the prostate) will not be effective at 
eradicating the entire bulk of his disease.  It is even more important to accurately identify 
all prostate cancers when mappi[INVESTIGATOR_292594], since only identified lesions are 
ablated.  We have previously shown that hrMRI detects up to 60% of tumors within the 
prostate not seen on mpMRI, and PET -MRI techniques may be able to improve the 
accuracy of this detection.  Even if lesions that are ignored by [CONTACT_292644]-hrMRI are indolent, long -term growth of these lesions may certainly affect cancer 
control outcomes over time and require costly and morbid retreatment. We believe that 
improved imaging at the outset of focal therapy would provide more comprehensive 
eradication of cancer burden from the start, resulting in improved long -term outcomes.  
2.9 PET-hrMRI prior to prostatectomy  
 
An important limitation of studying a new imaging modality in patients undergoing HIFU is 
that tumors are identified by [CONTACT_9256], which is susceptible to sampling error.  In other words, 
tumors invisible on MRI and missed on systematic prostate biopsy are no t considered in 
________________________________________________________________________

Version 8.0: [ADDRESS_357010].  
Since the true location of all tumors will be known, both the sensitivity and specificity of 
PSMA -PET MRI can be determined.

3.4 Study Procedures  
3.4.1  Screening/Baseline Procedures  
Subjects will be identified by [CONTACT_292645] -Sinai Medical Center during routine clinical practice. All study assessments for 
eligibility are performed as part of standard of care. Once a patient has been diagnosed, 
expressed interest in HIFU, and recommended study participation, they will  be 
presented with the Informed Consent Form, including a description of the study purpose, 
risks, benefits and possible alternatives. The prospective participant will be given 
sufficient time to consider participation in the research.  Patients will be asked to sign the 
study consent form after receiving a complete explanation of  the study.  
 
This study will enroll patients with clinically localized, Gleason score 7 -10 prostate cancer

biopsy cores positive and > 50% of core involvement in at least one core, interested in 
HIFU as primary treatment. Patients with low Gleason grade cancer (e.g. Gleason grade 
3) on the contralateral lobe are allowed since the standard -of-care for such low grade 
disease is observation .  Patients with very low risk disease and low -volume, low -risk 
disease are excluded since their preferred management is active surveill ance. Patients 
will present with newly diagnosed disease or after a period of active surveillance.  If there 
is suggestion of extracapsular disease or seminal vesicle involvement on MRI, these 
patients will be excluded.  Metastatic workup with cross sectio nal imaging and/or bone 
scan will not be mandatory, since they are not indicated for low - and intermediate -risk 
prostate cancers according to AUA and NCCN guidelines.

subjects will first be obtained. Then the final pathology report of the radical prost atectomy 
from OSH will be obtained , reviewed  and considered at CSMC  for final data analysis . 
Additionally, the outside pathology slides may need to be reviewed here at CSM C for final 
data analysis  as well , however this decision will be made later.  They  will get a preoperative 
PET-hrMRI.  All surgical interventions and postoperative care are per standard -of-care.  
Scan results may identify patients who do not qualify for surgery . 
 
The investigator may decide to change arms for a subject (i.e. HIFU to RP or RP to HIFU) 
based on MRI finding or replace the subject after imaging review.

Eligibility for HIFU  
If subjects are found to have unilateral high grade disease  (i.e. Gleason grade 4 or 5) , they 
will be considered as a candidate for hemigland or focal HIFU therapy. Clinician judgment 
may be exercised in determining eligibility for HIFU, since established criteria based on 
volume and extent of disease do not exist.  If patients have high  grade  disease in both 
lobes , they will not be eligible for HIFU therapy on this trial .  Their data will be used to 
assess the primary  endpoint but they will not be consider ed for secondary endpoints.  
 
HIFU Therapy and Follow Up Schedule  
Patients who are eligible for HIFU will receive hemigland or focal HIFU per standard -of-
care.  All subjects will receive repeat mpMRI  and MR/US -guided biopsy of all positive sites 
+ systematic 12-core prostate biopsy at 6 months  (or as clinically indicated) . As an

4.0 Study Risks  
 
This study investigates a novel software -based MRI imaging protocol that improves image 
resolution, and it investigates the use of F18-PSMA  for prostate PET -MRI.   
 
F18-PSMA  is currently not approved by [CONTACT_8415] .  MR/ultrasound fusion biopsies and HIFU 
for prostate ablation are approved procedures that are being routine performed as 
standard -of-care.  All invasive procedu res will therefore be performed following standard 
informed consent.  
 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  
MRI imaging is among the least invasive of all imaging modalities. The U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration has labeled MR systems of up to 4.0 Tesla as having “non -significant 
risk” and currently there is no evidence that MR imaging causes any long -term or 
irreversible effects in hu man beings. However, there are certain risks, which are detailed 
below.  
 
MRI imaging utilizes magnetic fields and radiofrequency fields, both of which can be 
harmful in certain situations. Magnetic fields can cause ferromagnetic implants or 
ferromagnetic foreign bodies, such as intracranial aneurysm clips, shrapnel, and 
intraoc ular metal chips to become dislodged and tear the surrounding soft tissue. 
Therefore, MRI imaging is contraindicated in persons with ferromagnetic implants or 
ferromagnetic foreign bodies. It is also contraindicated in persons with electrically, 
magnetical ly or mechanically activated implants because the magnetic field can cause 
these to function erratically.  In addition, persons wearing metallic objects may be at 
danger for them becoming dangerous projectiles, due to them inadvertently becoming 
introduced  into the magnetic field. All subjects will be prescreened carefully and all 
scanners are used in accordance with guidelines set by [CONTACT_292653].  
 
F18-PSMA  
The recommended dose is 333 MBq ( 9 mCi) administered as an intravenous bolus 
injection.   The (radiation absorbed) effective dose resulting from this dose  of F18-PSMA  
is 8 mSv.   The clinical trial database for F18-PSMA  includes data from  208 subjects. The 
mean administered activity was 333 MBq.   Adverse reactions were reported in ≤1% of 
subjects during clinical studies with F18-PSMA . The most  common adverse reactions 
were injection site pain, injection site erythema and dysgeusia.

5.0 ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)   
5.1 Definitions  
5.1.1  Adverse Event: An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in 
a patient receiving study intervention  and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this intervention . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of an experimental intervention, 
whether or not related to the intervention.  
5.1.2  Serious Adverse Events (SAE): A “serious” adverse event is defined in 
regulatory terminology as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
• Results in death. If death results from (progression of) the disease, 
the disease should be reported as event (SAE) itself.  
• Is life -threatening.  
(the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does 
not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe).  
 
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_9959] ≥ 24 hours.  
 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 
• Is an important medical event  
________________________________________________________________________  
IIT2020 -14-Dagnolo -HIFU       Page 21 of 40 
Version 8.0: 08 November  2023  
Any event that does not meet the above criteria, but that in the judgment of the 
investigator jeopardizes the patient, may be considered for reporting as a serious 
adverse event. The event may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in the definition of “Serious Adverse Event“.   
Evaluable for toxicity  
Any patient who receives at least one dose of investigational product is evaluable 
for toxicity and will be included in the safety analysis.  
 
Severity of Adverse Events  
• Mild (grade 1): the event causes discomfort without disruption of normal 
daily activities.  
• Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomfort that affects normal daily 
activities.  
• Severe (grade 3): the event makes the patient unable to perform normal 
daily activities or significantly affects his/her clinical status.  
• Life-threatening (grade 4): the patient was at risk of death at the time of 
the event.  
• Fatal (grade 5): the event caused death.  
Reporting Requirements for Adverse Events  
 
Step 1:  Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE – CURRENT VERSION 5.0 ).  
 
Step 2:  Grade the adverse event using the CTCAE – CURRENT VERSION 5.0 . 
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol therapy  
 
Attribution categories are as follows:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
 
Note: This includes all events that occur within [ADDRESS_357026] dose 
of treatment and is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) 
must also be rep orted accordingly.

Version 8.0: 08 November  2023 Step 4:  Determine the prior experience of the adverse event.  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for 
expedited reporting purposes only, when either the type of event or the severity 
of the event is not listed in:  
• the current known adverse events listed in the Agent Information Section 
of this protocol;  
• the drug package insert

6.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS   
 
6.1 HIFU Phase II Study  
Our preliminary data suggests that up to 60% of tumors invisible to standard mpMRI are 
detected on hrMRI  in an active surveillance population .  It is unclear how many additional 
lesions will be identified on PSMA  PET-MRI.  Since all areas of concern will be biopsied 
and only biopsy -proven tumors will be treated with HIFU, the morbidity of the surgical 
intervention is minimized and its potential to achieve cure is maximized.   
 
Power Assessment:  The main hypothesis to be tested is whether the sensitivity of PSMA  
PET-hrMRI is greater than mpMRI alone in 20% considering the prostate divided in 6 
sections for each patient.  The power is evaluated using 1000 simulations based on the 
McNemar`s type test proposed by [CONTACT_292657]. ( 17,2010) . Data is generated based on four 
correlations: r1: between lesions evaluated by [CONTACT_292658]-hrMRI for the same patient, r2: 
between lesions evaluated by [CONTACT_292659], r3: between evaluations PSMA  
PET-hrMRI and mpMRI for the same lesion and r4: between evaluations PSMA  PET-
hrMRI and mpMRI for the different lesions at the same patient. Based on preliminary data, 
we estimated mpMRI sensitivity of 42%, (r1, r2, r3, r4) = ( -0.249, -0.119, 0.714, -0.172) 
using Spearman correlation, average number of lesions of 2.[ADDRESS_357032] one positive biopsy  section equal to 82%.  The results are 
presented in Table [ADDRESS_357033] proposed by [CONTACT_292660]. (20 10) to detect a 
difference of 20% between sensitivities of the combination (PET -hrMRI or 
mpMRI) and mpMRI

Secondary Endpoint s: Negative biopsy rate  within treatment zones  on standard 12 -core 
biopsy 6 months following HIFU therapy ; rate of high grade cancer in the untreated lobe.   
 
Exploratory Endpoint:  Formalin -fixed paraffin embedded biopsy tissue will be requested 
from a subset of patients for RNAseq transcriptome analysis.  The number of cases 
analyzed will depend on availability of future funding.  The subset of cases requested  will 
depend on the exploratory object of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_292615], unilateral disease or treatment success.   
 
6.[ADDRESS_357035] of fluciclovine PET imaging 
on improving sensitivity of prostate cancer detection (identical to this study but using 
fluciclovine tracer instead of PSMA) was criticized due to lack of a gold standard based 
on radical prostatectomy (outcome was based on biopsy only).  Since the HIFU arm in this 
PSMA PET study has a biopsy -only gold standard, we elected to include a  parallel study  
arm using PSMA -PET imaging for intraprostatic cancer detection  but using radical 
prostatectomy pathology as the gold standard .  While there are historical references for 
sensitivity of PSMA -PET for intraprostatic cancer detection, they are not ideal to be used 
as a reference for our study since: they are few in nu mber and may not provide 
generalizable estimates;  the analysis to date has only been done on a per -patient (rather 
than a per -lesion) basis ; and there is variation in reading of mpMRI  by [CONTACT_384]/radiologist.

It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The protocol and consent form will be 
reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_292661], 
unless participating sites are utilizing a reliance agreement with the Coordinating 
Center’s IRB of record.  
 
Any documents that the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol, 
protocol amendments, Investigator’s Brochure, consent forms, information concerning 
patient recruitment, payment or compensation procedures, or other pertinent 
informati on) will be submitted to the IRB.  The IRBs written approval of the study 
protocol and the informed consent form will be in the possession of the Investigator 
before the study is initiated and prior to the shipment of study supplies to participating

Version 8.0: [ADDRESS_357039] protocol title and 
number and should identify the documents reviewed and the date of review.  
 
In obtaining and documenting informed consent, the investigator should comply with the 
applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
  
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a full 
explanation of the study and will be given the opportunity to review the consent form. 
Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by [CONTACT_38785] A 
Regulations and local or state regulations. Once this essential information has been 
provided to the patient and the investigator is assured that the patient understands the 
implications of participating in the study, the patient will be asked to give co nsent to 
participate in the study by [CONTACT_10001] -approved consent form.  
 
Prior to a patient’s participation in the trial, the written informed consent form should be 
signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_84266].  
 
Required Documentation (for multi -site studies)  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must be 
provided to the Study Lead at the Coordinating Center.  
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed 
consent  
• IRB membership list or Federal -wide Assurance letter  
• CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_292617]  
• Form FDA 1572 appropriately filled out and signed with appropriate 
documentation (NOTE: this is required if {institution} holds the IND. 
Otherwise, the affiliate Investigator’s signature [CONTACT_292675])  
• A financial conflict of interest statement from each investigator has been 
obtained.  
• A copy of the IRB -approved consent form  
• CAP and CLIA Laboratory certification numbers and institution lab normal 
values  
• Executed clinical research contract  
 
 
Registration Procedures  
 
All subjects that sign informed consent will be assigned a subject number sequentially by 
[CONTACT_292662].  Those subjects that do not pass the screening phase will be listed 
as screen failures on the master list of consented subjects.  Eligible subj ects, as 
determined by [CONTACT_292663] a treating investigator, will be 
registered on study at Cedars Sinai Medical Center by [CONTACT_408].   
 
Issues that would cause intervention  delays after registration should be discussed with 
the Principal Investigator (PI). If a patient does not receive protocol intervention  following 
________________________________________________________________________  
IIT2020 -14-Dagnolo -HIFU       Page 29 of 40 
Version 8.0: 08 November  2023 registration, the patient’s registration on the study may be canceled.  The Study 
Coordinator should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible.  
 
Assignment of Subject ID: The study teams will track all subjects who sign consent using 
OnCore. Subjects found to be ineligible will be recorded as screen failures. Subjects 
found to be eligible will be registered using a six-digit numeric ID that follows the 
standard SOCCI format  (832-001, 832-002, etc.).  Participating sites for multi -center 
studies will also need to track all subjects consented.  Upon registration, the participating 
site will enter patient study ID and limited patient information into O nCore, updating 
status to enrolled, as per CCTO guidance.  If a participating site does not or cannot gain 
access to OnCore, an exception will be granted with approval of the Executive Director 
of the CCTO.  
 
Note: For multi -center studies, assign a lead -in identifier for each site and define in the 
protocol. For example, the first site will be designated a lead -in number of 001, while the 
second site will be designated a lead -in number of 002. For a study which incl udes two 
sites, the first patient consented and enrolled at the first site will be subject [ADDRESS_357040] numbers.  
 
A) Eligibility Verification  
 
Prior to registration, all subjects must undergo an eligibility verification by [CONTACT_10748] -specific research staff. Minimal risk studies are exempt from SOCCI 
Quality Management Core (QMC) central eligibility checklist review and eligibility 
verification. Q MC central eligibility checklist review and eligibility verification for 
all subjects enrolled is performed only if requested by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_292618].  
 
B) Registration  
 
After eligibility is verified, each site will assign the subject a study number and 
site staff will then register the patient in OnCore®.   
 
 Registration is completed as follows:  
 
• Assignment of a patient study number  
• Assignment to the patient a dose/treatment arm as determined through 
communication with Biostatistics and the principal investigator, if 
applicable  
• Enter the patient in OnCore  
• Notify the investigational pharmacy and treating physicians that a subject 
has gone on study and anticipated treatment start date

Multicenter Monitoring Plan  
This trial will comply with the current requirements of the SOCCI Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee.  The SOCCI CCTO will be the Coordinating Center for this 
multicenter phase trial.  
 
In accordance with the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee, investigators will conduct 
continuous review of data and patient safety.  In addition, conference calls facilitated by 
[CONTACT_292666] l participating 
sites will be scheduled at least monthly (and more often as needed) to discuss study 
progress. If there are no patients on treatment or in follow -up, email communication may 
be used in lieu of a teleconference, or in the circumstance where a scheduling conflict 
does not permit phone attendance. Meeting summaries will be included and document 
review of data and patient safety; meeting minutes will be submitted and reviewed by [CONTACT_90398].   
 
All multicenter investigator -initiated trials conducted at the SOCCI are subject to data 
monitoring by [CONTACT_292667] (QMC).  QMC has the 
responsibility for study monitoring for protocol compliance, data accuracy, performance 
of audi ts and monitoring of accrual (details found in the SOCCI Data Safety Monitoring 
Plan).  All open trials are reviewed at a minimum once a year by [CONTACT_292668] (or more often 
depending on risk).  This annual review includes the following: evaluation of the curren t 
accrual relative to the planned total accrual; examination of all reported violations; review 
of past monitoring visits and correspondence with the PI; review of previous 
correspondence between the PI [INVESTIGATOR_292625]/DSMC.  External sites will be notified of  
upcoming monitoring visits and will be expected to provide de -identified source 
documents for remote monitoring of patients, and/or access to the site EMR.  Queries 
will be issued in the EDC and a detailed monitoring report will be provided to the

Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or queries, 
source documents, monitoring/auditing logs/letters, records of study drug receipt, 
dispensation, destruction and regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, 
IRB correspondence and approval, sign ed patient consent forms). Source documents 
include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and 
records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical research study. 
Government agency regulations  and directives require that the study investigator must 
retain all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial. Study 
documents should be kept on file in accordance with all applicable federal guidelines 
and local guidelines.  
 
Investigators must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) 
inspectors upon request.  
 
Following closure of the study, each participating site will maintain a copy of all site study 
records in a safe and secure location. The Coordinating Center will inform the 
investigator at each site at such time that the records may be destroyed.

site studies, the policy of the IRB of record must be followed. A protocol exception most 
often involves a single subject and is not a permanent revision to the research protocol. 
Protocol except ions that extend beyond a single subject should result in a protocol 
amendment to avoid serial violations.

Version 8.0: 08 November  2023  
Planned exceptions to the protocol that are more than logistical in nature and/or impact 
an eligibility criterion, affect timing of study drug administration, or the investigator 
assesses the event may impact subject safety and/or study integrity, may not be 
implemented without prior IRB approval. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_292626]/his designee is re sponsible for 
submitting a protocol exception request and its supporting documents to the CSMC IRB 
if it meets the CS -IRB UPI[INVESTIGATOR_292627] a reportable exception/waiver. Study 
team should also refer to the IRB Reporting Possible Unanticipated Pr oblems Involving 
Risks to Subject or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) Policy: Institutional Review Board/Research 
Compliance and Quality Improvement guidelines to determine which deviations and 
exception requests require IRB reporting. For multi -site studies, the policy of  the IRB of 
record must be followed. Once IRB approved, the deviation or exception can be 
implemented.  
 
Special considerations for Eligibility Waivers (EW)  
In general, subjects who do not meet the eligibility requirements should not be enrolled. 
In the rare event that it is appropriate for subject inclusion, the rationale/justification and 
subject case history should be submitted to the IRB for approval. Such requests for 
minimal risk studies do not require prior review by [CONTACT_292670].

individual subject) do not require prior IRB approval unless the deviation has the 
potential to affect the subject’s safety or study integrity. Such planned deviation s that do 
meet this definition and do not affect the subject’s safety or study integrity should be 
noted in the subject’s research record or deviation log as described in the SOCCI 
CCTO’s Standard Operating Procedure 12: Deviation and Noncompliance Reporti ng. 
For multi -site studies, follow local policy.  
 
Unintentional deviations from the protocol that might affect subject safety or study 
integrity should be reported to the IRB within 10 days from when the investigator 
becomes aware that such a deviation has occurred, as outlined in the SOCCI CCTO’s 
Standar d Operating Procedure 12: Deviation and Noncompliance Reporting (or local 
policy, for multi -site studies). In this case, a Protocol Deviation report must be submitted 
in CS -IRB (or the IRB of Record), per CSMC IRB policy, Reporting Possible 
Unanticipated P roblems Involving Risks to Subject or Others (UPI[INVESTIGATOR_9961]) Policy: 
Institutional Review Board/Research Compliance and Quality Improvement. For multi -
site studies, the policy of the IRB of record must be followed. All submissions should 
include a description of the plan to avoid similar deviations or exceptions in the future.

Version 8.0: 08 November  2023 Study Summary Table  
The number of subjects in the Study Summary table was revised from 40 Study Subjects 
(Phase II), 20 Study Subjects (Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]) to 4 0 Study Subjects (Phase II), 40 Study Subjects 
(Phase II ).  
 
Modified the objectives to reflect clarifications in primary and secondary endpoints for 
both cohorts.  
 
Modified statistical analysis to reflect clarifications in primary and second endpoints for 
both cohorts.  
 
3.1 Overview  
Per PRMC recommendations, provided clarifications to the primary and secondary 
endpoints for both cohorts.  
3.3. Study Endpoints  
Per PRMC recommendations, provided clarifications to the primary and secondary 
endpoints for both cohorts.  
 
3.4 Study Procedures  
The following text were added "  Scan results may identify patients who do not qualify for 
surgery " and "The investigator may decide to change arms for a subject (i.e. HIFU to RP 
or RP to HIFU) based on MRI finding or replace the subject after imaging review".     
 
3.4.2 Study Calendar  
For tissue collection, in addition to left -over tissue, the study allows for collection of 2 
tubes of blood for research.  We added “..and 2 yellow top (8.5mL) tubes of whole 
blood”.  
 
6.1 HIFU Phase II Study  
Added HIFU Phase II Study as header at the beginning of the statistical analysis section.  
 
6.2 Radical Prostatectomy Phase II Study  
Added Radical Prostatectomy Phase II Study description per PRMC's recommendation 
for two separate primary and secondary endpoints for both cohorts.  
 
6.3 Exploratory Objectives  
This section was added to explain that tissue and blood will be used for future correlative 
studies.  
 
Protocol Version 5.0, dated 07 February 2022 , amends Protocol Version 6.0, dated 
24 October 2022.  
 
Amendment 6: See changes below:  
 
3.4.1  
 
This section is changed to allow enrollment of patients scheduled to undergo radical 
prostatectomy performed either at Cedars -Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) or an outside 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (OSH). If the radical prostatectomy is performed at an OSH, authorization from 
subjects will first be o btained. Then the final pathology report of the radical prostatectomy 
from OSH will be obtained, reviewed and considered at CSMC for final data analysis .

Version 8.0: [ADDRESS_357056] safety or study integrity.  
 
6.1 
 
This section is changed to allow the number of patients enrolled in the HIFU arm to 
decrease from 40 to 30 , and the  number of patients enrolled in the Radical 
Prostatectomy  arm to decrease to 31 . The reduction in sample size allows for 85% 
power for both arms, which the investigators  consider adequate for the scope of the 
study .

 SUMMARY  
A number of evidences indicate that subjects with excess visceral fat accumulation are at 
higher risk for cardio -metabol ic diseases and diabetes. With this in mind, I have focused my 
attention to an emerging visceral fat depot, the epi[INVESTIGATOR_618666] (EAT), and developed a 
methodology through which EAT can be visualized and measured using standard two -dimensional 
echocardiography. This approach has several advantages, including its low cost, easy accessibility 
and good reproducibility. Clinical assessment of EAT is rapi[INVESTIGATOR_618667] -metabolic risk stratification. Echocardiographic EAT is an  inexpensive, reproducible and 
direct measure of visceral fat.  In fact, EAT strongly reflects the intra -abdominal accumulation of 
visceral fat as measured by [CONTACT_9252] (MRI), and does so better than waist circumference.EAT correlates with insulin resistance, fasting glucose, metabolic syndrome, 
coronary artery disease, sub -clinical atherosclerosis and Left Ventricular Mass (LVM), an 
independent cardiovascular risk factor.   
An interest clinical application of the EAT is its potential use as therapeutic target during 
weight lost interventions or pharmaceutical treatments directly or indirectly targeting the adipose 
tissue. EAT significantly decreased in studies that included adipose tissue modulation and 
changes, such as TZD or statins. Its reduction was earlier and more significant than changes in BMI 
and waist circumference during weight loss.  
Dapagliflozin is a new and emerging anti- diabetes medication. Dapagliflozin is  a selective 
sodium -glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, reduces hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by [CONTACT_618752], and weight loss is a consistent 
associated finding.  Because dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion, weight loss could 
result from reduced body fat secondary to caloric loss or from fluid loss secondary to osmotic 
diuresis or from a combination of both factors.  Nevertheless, whether Dapagliflozin  may cause a 
reduction in visceral fat is unknown . Also whether Dapagliflozin  can reduce EAT, visceral fat of the 
heart,  and improve cardiac performance, is unexplored.  
Hence, in this study we would like to test the hypotheses that Dapagliflozin  (a) causes a 
rapid and significant reduction of EAT , as marker of visceral fat,  in type 2 diabetic patients, (b) 
Dapagliflozin -induced EAT reduction is associated with a significant reduction of LVM.  These 
hypotheses would be tested in a n interventional , double -blind , paralle l group, placebo controlled 
study in 100 overweight or obese type 2 diabetes subjects.   
This proposal therefore contains a number of novel concepts and an innovative 
methodology with immediate and important clinical application.  
 
 
Key words : visceral fat; epi[INVESTIGATOR_618668]; Dapagliflozin ; type [ADDRESS_822627], easy accessibility and good reproducibility  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618669] (EAT) is a peculiar visceral fat depot (1 -8). It has anatomical and 
functional contiguity to the myocardium and coronary arteries.  Under physiological conditions 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_618670], mech anical and thermogenic cardio -protective 
properties.  Under pathological circumstances, EAT could locally affect the heart and the coronary 
arteries through vasocrine or paracrine secretion of pro -inflammatory cytokines. What could 
influence this equilibriu m between harmful or protective effects is still unclear.  
 
Clinical Measurement of EAT  
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618671] -dimensional guided M-mode 
echocardiography using commercially available equipments,  as I first proposed  and validated (9 -
10). Standard  parasternal long - and short -axis views permit the most accurate measurement of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_618672].  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618673] -free space between the 
outer wall of the myocardium and the visceral layer of pericardium  
(Echocardiographic image on the left: 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_618674] ) and its 
thickness is measured perpendicularly 
on the free wall of the right ventricle at 
end-systole in three cardiac cycles. 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618675] a minimum of [ADDRESS_822628] circumference does (9 -11).  In a 
multiple regression analysis that included waist circumference and epi[INVESTIGATOR_618676], intra -abdominal visceral fat was better and independently predicted by [CONTACT_45092][INVESTIGATOR_618677] (r2=  0.44, p<0.01). Bland test confirmed the good 
agreement between the two methods. Other stu dies confirmed this finding in different 
populations. EAT is therefore an independent predictor of visceral adiposity and weakly reflects 
the obesity degree as measured by [CONTACT_44207]. Subjects with higher waist circumference clearly show higher epi[INVESTIGATOR_618672], as previously reported.  Ectopic fat deposition may occur within the 
organs and affect the function. EAT is associated with proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (
1H-MRS) intra- myocardial fat (12). Hence, EAT can be considered primarily a simple an d objective 
marker of visceral adiposity.  
 
Echocardiographic epi[INVESTIGATOR_618678] a role in the stratification and prediction of the cardio -metabolic risk (13 -35). Several clinical studies showed 
that epi[INVESTIGATOR_618679] . 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618680].  When cardio -metabolic parameters are considered separately, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618681].  EAT has been associated 
with the presence and severity of CAD in a large number of studies.  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618682] t and LVM  
Abnormal LV mass (LVM) and LV hypertrophy (LVH) are commonly observed in patients with diabetes and obesity. LVM and LVH can be calculated with standard echocardiography as well as 
the epi[INVESTIGATOR_618672]. LVH is a well- established cardiovas cular risk factor that can lead to 
heart failure.  Our group showed that  high echocardiographic EAT has been associated with 
increased LVM and abnormal geometry (17 -19).  Our echocardiographic findings are in agreement 
with autopsy studies.  Mechanical and b io-molecular mechanisms have been evoked to explain 
these correlations. Increased epi[INVESTIGATOR_618683]. Increased LVM in obese diabetic subjects could be also due to a direct effect 
of excess epi[INVESTIGATOR_618668].   Remarkably, we also showed that decrease in EAT was independently 
associated with a decreae in LVM  after 6 months of diet in obese subjects (36)  
 
Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618684] e (FPG) were measured in non -diabetic 
Caucasian subjects who underwent routine transthoracic echocardiogram (37). Study subjects 
were designated as having normal fasting glucose (NFG) with FPG < 100  mg/dl; and IFG with FPG 
(100 and < 126  mg/dl).Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618685] (8

interventions might allow the epi[INVESTIGATOR_618689]. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618690], bariatric surgery -induced weight loss and moderate aerobic exercise.  
Of great interest, the weight loss intervention study showed that the decrease in epi[INVESTIGATOR_618691]. 
Interestingly, we reported that EAT significantly (12.3±1 vs 8.3±1 p<0.001) decrease after a [ADDRESS_822629] circumference, - 32% vs - 23% 
vs -19%.  Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618692].  
 
Pharmacological target  
Given its rapid metabolism and its simple objective measurability, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618693] [ADDRESS_822630] on the epi[INVESTIGATOR_618694], such as 
statins and thiazolidinediones, has been evaluated (44 -47).   Interestingly, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618695]].  Consistently, atorvastatin therapy induced a reduction of computed 
tomography -measured epi[INVESTIGATOR_618696] -menopausal women, as very recently 
reported. The effect of atorvastatin on epi[INVESTIGATOR_618697]. In this context, it certainly notable that epi[INVESTIGATOR_618698] -density lipoprotein receptor -related protein 
[ADDRESS_822631], treat ment with pi[INVESTIGATOR_341598] 2 diabetic patients was 
associated with reductions in expression of interleukin -1β and other proinflammatory genes in 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_618668].  Interestingly, a recent study reveals that peroxisome proliferator– activated 
receptor -γ (PPAR-γ) agonist can induce a rapid browning of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_618699].  
 
 Dapagliflozin  
 
Dapagliflozin is a new and emerging anti- diabetes medication. Dapagliflozin is  a selective sodium -
glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, reduces hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM) by [CONTACT_618752], an d weight loss is a consistent associated 
finding.  Because dapagliflozin increases urinary glucose excretion, weight loss could result from 
reduced body fat secondary to caloric loss or from fluid loss secondary to osmotic diuresis or from 
a combination of both factors.  Two clinical trials reported significant weight loss in type 2 diabetic 
patients who received Dapagliflozin.  Dapagliflozin  patients had significantly greater weight loss 
than placebo patients over 102 weeks (p < 0.05).  Dapagliflozin 10 mg/d  or placebo was added to 
open -label metformin for 24 wk.  Dapagliflozin  reduced total body weight, predominantly by 
[CONTACT_618754] (FM) , VAT and subcutaneous (SAT) in T2DM inadequately controlled with 
metformin  (50-51). Dapagliflozin produced greater m ean reductions from baseline in VAT and SAT 
compared with placebo at 24 wk. Patients treated with Dapagliflozin  exhibited a significant mean 
decrease from baseline body weight compared with a significant weight gain in patients 
administered glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956] ( –3.1 lb [ –1.4 kg] vs +2.9 lb [+1.3 kg], respectively)  
 
 RATIONALE OF THE STUDY  
 
Patients treated with Dapagliflozin  exhibited a significant decrease in body weight.  Whether 
Dapagliflozin  may cause a reduction in visceral fat is unknown.  Although the mechanisms are still 
unclear, preclinical evidence suggests that SGLT2  inhibitors may modulate the adipose tissue and 
exert favorable cardiovascular effects. Nevertheless, whether Dapagliflozin -related improved 
cardio -metabolic profile can be attributed to a direct effect to EAT, visceral fat of the heart, is 
unknown and unexplored.  
 
SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION  
 
Increased visceral fat is an established risk factor for a poor cardiometabolic profile. Type [ADDRESS_822632] can be also explained by a reduced visceral fat is unexplored. 
Whether Dapagliflozin  can reduce the risk  of LVH and ultimately heart failure is unknown. 
Achieving this knowledge may be of great importance  in the management of overweight/obese 
type [ADDRESS_822633] on an easily -accessible organ -specific visceral fat.  
 
STUDY HYPOTHESES  
1. We hypothesize that Dapagliflozin  can induce a significant and rapid decrease in EAT, as 
marker of visceral adiposity. Given the rapid metabolism of EAT and its capacity to 
significantly decrease with agents targeting the fat, as previously reported, we 
hypothesize that EAT can be signifi cantly changed during treatment with Dapagliflozin .       
2. We previously showed that EAT significantly and independently correlate with LVM. We 
also showed that EAT reduction was independently associated with reduction in LVM.  Given these findings, we hypothesize that Dapagliflozin  can reduce  LVM through an 
effec t on EAT.  
SPECIFIC AIMS  
a) Dapagliflozin  causes a rapid and significant reduction of EAT in type 2 diabetic 
patients  
b) Dapagliflozin -induced EAT reduction would be associated with a significant 
reduction of LV mass, independent cardiovascular risk factor.

will be coordinated by [CONTACT_23164].   Each patient will undergo a baseline 
echocardiographic study for the measurement of EAT  and LVM.  Each patient will also have a full 
physical examination, body weight, height, waist and hip circumference measured, a point of care 
of fasting glucose and haemoglobinA1c (HbA1c). Echocardiographic study will be performed on

DESCRIPTION OF STUDY SITE   
UM Miller School of Medicine has b een the site of several National Institutes of Health studies 
and many peer -reviewed, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618701]. The Division of 
EDM is fully equipped and trained to visit, follow up and manage patients with diabetes. UMMG -
DRI is fully accredited and equipped to perform state -of- the-art diagnostic tests assisting in the 
diagnosis and management of diabetes. The Division is also equipped with a state -of-the-art 
echocardiographic unit, Siemens, Acuson,  [LOCATION_003], for the measurement of  the EAT. [CONTACT_618768] 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_618702].  
Echocardiographic Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618703] a technician trained in echocardiography.   Standard parasternal and api[INVESTIGATOR_618704] p osition. All echocardiograms will be recorded 
on DVDs and subsequently digitized will be analyzed offline for epi[INVESTIGATOR_618705] (9 -10). 
Briefly, epi[INVESTIGATOR_618706] t will be identified as the echo -free space between the outer wall of the 
myocardium and the visceral layer of pericardium. Epi[INVESTIGATOR_618707] -systole in three cardiac cy cles. 
Parasternal long - and short -axis views allow the most accurate measurement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_618708], with optimal cursor beam orientation in each view.  
Maximum epi[INVESTIGATOR_618709], perpendicular to the aortic annulus, used as 
anatomical landmark for this view. For the midventricular parasternal short -axis assessment, 
maximum epi[INVESTIGATOR_618710], perpendicular to the interventricular septum at mid -chordal and 
tip of the papi[INVESTIGATOR_618711], as anatomic landmark . The average value of three cardiac cycles 
from each  echocardiographic view will be considered.  
 
 
 Reliability of echocardiographic measurement of EAT  
Reliability of echocardiographic measurement of EAT will be assessed by [CONTACT_554577]- class 
correlation coefficient. Inter-  and intra -observer reproducibility will be evaluated by [CONTACT_554577]-  
class correlation coefficient in all subjects. Echocardiograms will b e read by [CONTACT_618757]’ study group. 
Previously published studies have shown that intra - and inter -observer reproducibility of 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_618712].  Int ra-class correlation coefficients varied from 0.90 to 
0.98 and from 0.93 to 0.98, respectively indicating good reproducibility and reliability. Both 
readers will be blinded to the subjects’ clinical data.  Although its advantages overcome the 
disadvantages,  echocardiography measurement may have some limitations. Echocardiographic 
EAT is a linear measurement at a single location and therefore may not reflect the variability of 
fat thickness or total epi[INVESTIGATOR_618713], and then 
adjusted as LV mass/body surface area (BSA) and LV mass/height2.7 (h2.7). Left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH) will be defined as LV mass/BSA >134 g/m2 for men and >110 g/m2 for women 
and as LV mass/h2.7 >51 g/m2.7 in both sexes. Relative wall thickness (RWT) will be calculated as 2 
posterior wall (PW)/LV end – diastolic – diameter. Four LV geometric patterns (normal, concentric 
remodeling, concentric hypertrophy, and eccentric hypertrophy) will be determined using values 
of RWT and LV mass as follows: normal (no LVH and RWT < 0.44), concentric remodeling (no LVH 
and RWT > 0.44), concentric hypertrophy (LVH and RWT > 0.44), and eccentric hypertrophy (LVH 
and RWT < 0.44).  
 
Physical Examination 
All anthropometric measures will be obtained by [CONTACT_74309]. Height (in cm) and weight (in 
kg) will be measured, and BMI will be automatically calculated as weight in kilograms divided by 
[CONTACT_134106] (kg/m2). Waist circumference (in cm) will be measured as the 
minimum circumference between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. Hip circumference (in 
cm) will be measured as the widest diameter over the greater trochanters). Blood pressure will  
be measured in the seated position, using an automated cuff and digital readout, and entered by [CONTACT_618758].  
 
Blood Measurements  
Fasting point of care tests will be obtained from all individuals according to the study des ign 
timetable. Blood parameters will be measured according to standard and previously described 
procedures.  
Follow up of glucose profile  Study patients will be advised to monitor their capi[INVESTIGATOR_618714], fasting in the morning and post -prandially.  Glucose profile will be tracked weekly by  [CONTACT_618759], a new and convenient UM online method of 
commun ication with the sponsor investigator, or by [CONTACT_756]. R esearch coordinator will inform 
the sponsor investigator on patients’ glucose readings.  
  
COMPLIANCE AND RETENTION STRATEGY  We estimate that the majority of the participants who 
will be considered eligible will complete the study. Attrition can be estimated as lower than 10%.  
In the event that participants are lost to follow -up, the research coordinator will contact [CONTACT_618760]. The research coordinator will be trained in e ffective telephone 
technique to maximize recruitment success.  
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS:  
Iacobellis’  group previously showed and published that epi[INVESTIGATOR_618715] 
12.3 ± 1.8 to 8.3 ±1 mm P < 0.001 after the 6- month very low calorie d iet, accounting for a 32% 
reduction from the baseline.  Average weight loss after the [ADDRESS_822634] that Dapagliflozin  will cause a significant decrease in EAT, but much smaller when 
compared to weight loss interventions such as a VLCD. EAT decrease has been shown to vary 
(between -12% and - 32%) after different interventions. EAT reduction is anticipated to be 
between -15% and - 25% after [ADDRESS_822635] 
15% reduction in EAT is based on: a) the previously reported weight -loss caused by [CONTACT_103473] , 
b) previously -reported responsiveness (decrease) of EAT to pharmacological agents targeting the 
fat.   A reduction of 15%, an absolute difference of 1.[ADDRESS_822636] a 
larger difference after 6 months of treatment  
Given the reference value and the expected difference in EAT, the statistical power of the study 
(two -sided, α=0.05) was calculated.

A convenience sample of 50 individuals for each group will therefore provide the statistical power (80%) to detect an expected difference of - 15% in the EAT before and after treatment with 
Dapagliflozin . Baseline SD of [ADDRESS_822637]

adjustment for baseline will be used to calculate the changes ( Δ) in EAT between baseline, [ADDRESS_822638] on EAT. Based on our previous data  (36) we know 
that LVM reduction is independently related to epi[INVESTIGATOR_618716]. We hypothesize that 
LVM will reduce in the F -group and better than in the M -group.  ANOVA test with 95% CI will be 
used to calculate the changes ( Δ) in study parameters between baseline, [ADDRESS_822639] circumference and Δ LVM will be 
calculated using simple linear regression analysis. Variables with a p<0.[ADDRESS_822640] reduction in LVM will be 
examined by [CONTACT_618761] (ROC) analysis by [CONTACT_618762]. 100 –

DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]:  
 
Data Collection: Each of the dedicated clinic exam rooms at the UMMG -DRI provides direct access 
to the clinical research study electronic data capture (EDC) eVelos system provided by [CONTACT_618763]. The sponsor investig ator and research coordinator will collect and manage 
the data.  
 
ETHICS:  
Informed Consent  
Eligible and willing participant will be contact[CONTACT_618764].   Previous to the signing of the informed consent, extensive oral and written information will be 
given to the subjects, including information about risks associated with Dapagliflozin  treatment 
(in accordance with the updated Prescribing Information) before initiating any study related 
activity.  
Confidentiality of data  The sponsor investigator will explain that participant confidentiality will 
be maintained, data will only be identified by a number and that their consent forms with identification number will be kept locked in a filing cabinet.  
Protections against Risk  
The risks to patients are extremely minimal in this study. There is a theoretical small increased 
risk of hypoglycaemic events in the Dapaglifl ozin + metformin group. There are no other foreseen 
risks to participants involved in the study. Patients will be required to remove their shirts for 
echocardiographic evaluation and may feel embarrassed. In addition, the patient may worry that 
their participation might be disclosed in a weight loss program. Patients will be informed of the 
echocardiography procedure prior to consenting. There may be some embarrassment from 
having their waist and hips measured three times throughout the course of a year.  P articipants 
 would undergo blood test regardless their participation in the study. The researcher assistant will 
be advised of any required sensitivity towards participating members  
Other Ethical considerations  The study has been submitted to the Universi ty of Miami local institutional review board (IRB). 
Final approval is pending, but highly anticipated.  The study will be conducted in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki.  The study will be conducted in accordance with the ICH GCP 
guidelines. The s ponsor -investigator will comply with all applicable regulatory and legal

STUDY SCHEDULE:  
Planned recruitment period: 1 year  
Expected milestones:  
• start of study: 01 /01/2015  
• first patient first visit 0 1/01/2015  
• last patient last visit 12 /01/201 6 
• Planned completion of integrated final study report 01/1/2017  
 
STUDY DRUGS AND MATERIALS:  
Study medication  
FARXIGA ( Dapagliflozin ) is SGLT2 inhibitor  indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycemic control in adults with type [ADDRESS_822641] and 
evaluate the temperature.  
Randomization  
This will be an open randomized study. The method of allocation generation will be a 
computerized random -number generator. The sequence will be generated by [CONTACT_618765]. This has greater potential benefit in small trials, as in the present study.  
 
 
 
 
CONCOMITANT ILLNESSES AND MEDICATIONS:  
 Details of all concomitant illnesses and medication will be recorded at the first visit. Any changes 
in concomitant medication will be recorded at each visit. If the change influences the subject’s 
eligibility to continue in the trial, the Sponsor will be informed.  The information collected for each 
concomitant medication includes, at a minimum, start date, stop date or continuing, and 
indication. Fo r each concomitant illness, date of onset, date of resolution or continuing, at a 
minimum, will be recorded.  
 
SAFETY 
Adverse Event (AE):  
An AE is any undesirable medical event occurring to a subject in a clinical trial, whether or not 
related to the trial product(s). This includes events reported from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and unt il post treatment follow -up period as 
defined in the protocol. The following should not be recorded as AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening:  
• Pre -planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure wa s planned has    
worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent  
• Pre -existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures  
 
Adverse events:  
In the case of an AE , the sponsor -investigator will compl y with all local legal, regulatory, and IRB 
requirements.  The sponsor -investigator will be responsible for reporting of all adverse events 
including serious adverse events (SAE), suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) to the competent authority and independent ethics 
committee/institutional review boards based upon federal regulations and local/IRB policies.  The 
sponsor -investigator will report to Astra- Zeneca  all SAEs, S[LOCATION_003]Rs, and SADRs at the same time 
such events are reported to regulatory authorities or within [ADDRESS_822642] the following information at minimum for each of these 
events : 
1. Study name  
2. Patient identification  
3. Event (preferably a diagnosis)  
4. Drug  
5. Reporter identification  
Clinical Laboratory Adverse Event:  
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinical laboratory abnormality regarded as clinically significant i.e. 
an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires 
active management, (i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of trial product, more frequent follow -
up or diagnostic investigation).  
 
 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
A serious AE is an experience that at any dose results in any of th e following:  
• Death  
• A life -threatening* experience  
• In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• A persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Important medical events that may not r esult in death, be life -threatening*, or require  
  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_508453], based upon appropriate medical judgement, 
they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed in this definition  
*The term life- threatening in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at 
risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.  
 
Serious Adverse Drug Reaction (SADR):  
An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is an adverse event for which a causal relationship 
(Possible/Probable relation) between the study drug and the occurrence of the event is 
suspected. The ADR should be classified as serious if it meets one or more of the seri ousness 
criteria.  
 
Medical Events of Special Interest (MESI): A MESI is (1) a medication error (e.g. wrong drug 
administration or wrong route of administration) or (2) a suspected transmission of an infectious 
agent via the product  
 Non -Serious Adverse Ev ent: 
A non -serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE.  
 Severity Assessment Definitions:  
• Mild: Transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities  
• Moderate: Marked symptoms, moderate interference with the su bject’s daily activities  
• Severe: Considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities, unacceptable  
 
Relationship to study medication Assessment Definitions: 
• Probable: Good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship  
• Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed  
• Unlikely: The event is most likely related to an etiology other than the trial product 
 
 
 
 
Outcome Categories and Definitions:  
 • Recovered: Fully recovered or by [CONTACT_488921]  
• Recovering: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. 
This term should only be used when the subject has completed the trial  
• Recovered with sequelae: As a result of the AE, the subject suffered persistent and     significant 
disability/incapacity (e.g. became blind, deaf, paralysed). Any AE recovered with sequelae 
should be rated as an SAE  
• Not recovered  
• Fatal  
• Unknown  
 
Collection, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events  
All events meeting the definition of an adverse event will be collected and reported from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until the end of the 
post -treatment follow -up period as stated in the protocol.  
 
Follow -up of Adverse Events  
During and following a subject’s participation in a clinical trial, the sponsor- investigator and 
institution will provide adequate medical care to the study subject for any study -related adverse 
events, including clinically significant laboratory values related to the study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their insurance status.  
All adverse events classified as serious or severe or possibly/probably related to the trial product 
will be followed until the subject has recovered and all queries have been resolved. For cases of 
chronic conditions follow -up until the outcome category is “recovered” is not required, as these 
cases can be closed with an outcome of “recovering” or “not recovered”. All other adverse events will be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering” (for chronic conditions), or 
“recovered” or until the end of the post -treatment follow- up stated in the protocol, whichever 
comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved.  
 Pregnancy  
Study subjects will be instructed to notify the sponsor -investigator immediately if they become 
pregnant. The sponsor -investigator will report to Astra Zeneca any pregnancy occurring during 
the trial period. Reporting of pregnancy by [CONTACT_3211]- investigator will occur within the same 
timelines described above for reporting of Adverse Events. Pregnancy complications will be 
recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be 
reported and followed up as a serious adverse event.  
Precautions/Over -dosage  
Precautions and procedures will be observed in the e vent of overdose of Dapagliflozin  provided 
during the study.  
 
REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
 Investigators and other site personnel must inform the FDA, via a MedWatch/AdEERs form, of any 
serious or unexpected adverse events that occur in accordance with the reporting obligations of 
[ADDRESS_822643] all such reports to AZ.  A copy of the 
MedWatch/AdEERs report must be faxed to [COMPANY_008] at the time the event is reported to the 
FDA.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to compi[INVESTIGATOR_118916] a report according to the FDA reporting requirement timelines and to ensure that these reports are also submitted to [COMPANY_008] at the same time.  
 
When reporting to [COMPANY_008], a cover page should accompany the MedWatch/AdEERs form 
indicating the following:  
 
·     Investigator Sponsored Study (ISS)  
 ·     The investigator IND number assigned by [CONTACT_1622]  
 
·     The investigator’s name [CONTACT_3816]  
 
·     The trial name/tit le and [COMPANY_008] ISS reference number  
 Investigative site must also indicate, either in the SAE report or the cover page, the causality of 
events in relation to all study medications and if the SAE is related to disease progression, as 
determined by [CONTACT_458].  
Send SAE report and accompanying cover page by [CONTACT_8307]’s designated fax line: 1 -[PHONE_5395] 
 Serious adverse events that do not require expedited reporting to the FDA need to be reported 
to [COMPANY_008] preferably using the MedDRA coding language for serious adverse events.   
In the case of blinded trials, [COMPANY_008] will request that the Sponsor either provide a copy of 
the randomization code/ code break information or unblind those SAEs which require expedited 
reporting. All SAEs have to be reported to [COMPANY_008], whether or not considered causally 
related to the investigational product.  All SAEs will be documented.  The investigator is responsible for informing the IRB and/or the Regulatory Authority of the SAE  as per local 
requirements.  
  
 LIABILITY AND SUBJECT INSURANCE:  
The sponsor -investigator should state that during and following a subject’s participation in trial, 
the sponsor -investigator and his/her institution will provide adequate medical care to the study 
subject for any study -related adverse events, including clinically significant laboratory values 
related to the study. This medical care for study subjects will be provided regardless of their 
insurance status.  
The sponsor -investigator will be respon sible for the conduct of the study and agrees to defend, 
indemnify, and hold harmless Astra- Zeneca, any of its parent companies, affiliates, or subsidiaries, 
and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, distributors, 
salesp ersons, customers, licensees, and end -users from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, 
damage, expense or liability imposed by [CONTACT_618766]: (a) any breach 
of sponsor -investigator's obligations; or (b) sponsor- investigato r’s negligent or grossly negligent 
use or willful misuse of the study drug, the results, or services derived there from.  This 
indemnification shall not apply in the event and to the extent that a court of competent 
jurisdiction or a duly appointed arbiter  determines that such losses or liability arose as a result of 
Astra -Zeneca   gross negligence, intentional misconduct, or material breach of its responsibilities.   
 
PUBLICATION PLAN:  
Data generated from the study will be published in highly ranked peer reviewed scientific journals and presented at national and international meetings. Astra -Zeneca  will have any manuscripts for 
publication for review with a right to comment.  
The sponsor -investigator will register the study with a publicly assessable database such as 
clinicaltrials.gov.

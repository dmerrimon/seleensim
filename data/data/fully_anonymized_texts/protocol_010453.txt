Multicentre Dose Ranging Study of a Subcutaneous Anti -OX40L Monoclonal 
Antibody (KY1005) in Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis  
Brief  title: Study Testing Response Effect of KY1005 Against Moderate to 
Severe Atopic Dermatitis (STREAM -AD) 
Protocol version:  8.0 
Sponsor:  Kymab Ltd, a [COMPANY_011] Company  
Development Phase:  2b 
Study type:  Interventional  
Indication:  Atopic dermatitis (AD)  
Study sites:  Sites will be selected globally to participate in this study.  
Study rationale and 
purpose:  The aim of this study is to characterise the efficacy (including dose/exposure 
response) and safety of KY1005 across a range of doses/exposures f or a 
maximum duration of [ADDRESS_179393] had an inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_154997].  In addition, the durability of response and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) following  withdrawal from the Investigational 
Medicinal Product (IMP) from Day 169 (Week 24) will be characterised.   
KY1005 is a human anti -OX40 ligand (OX40L) immunoglobulin G (IgG) 4 
monoclonal antibody (mAb) that, via blockade of the OX40/OX40L pathway, 
is expe cted to suppress T helper (Th) cell Th2 -driven inflammation, as well as 
potentially modulating Th1, Th17 and Th22 responses.  Atopic dermatitis is a 
chronic/relapsing inflammatory skin disease, characterised by [CONTACT_155082], driven by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_154998] (CD) 4+ driven inflammation which is dominated by 
[CONTACT_78443]2 cytokines.  
Primary objective:  To characterise the efficacy (including dose/exposure -response) across a range 
of KY1005 expos ures compared to Placebo on the signs of AD using the Eczema 
Area and Severity Index (EASI) in those patients with a documented history, 
within 6  months prior to Baseline, of either inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_154999].  Dose response of 4 different 
dose regimens of KY1005 in patients with AD versus Placebo will be evaluated.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage change in EASI from 
Baseline to Day  113 (Week 16).   
Secondary objectives:  The key secondary efficacy objectives will be to characterise the efficacy 
(including dose/exposure -response) across a range of KY1005 exposures 
compared to Placebo on additional physician assessments of AD 
activity/severity: EASI at Day 169 (Week 24), EASI -75, In vestigator Global 
Assessment [IGA], and Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] for pruritus.  
Other secondary objectives include:  
To characterise:  
• Safety and tolerability of KY1005.  
• The PK profile of KY1005 across a range of KY1005 doses/exposures.  
• The response acros s a range of KY1005 exposures on additional 
physician assessments of AD activity/severity EASI, EASI 50, 
EASI  75, EASI 90, EASI 100, IGA, SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis 
(SCORAD) Index and affected body surface area (BSA).

Study design:  This is a Phase IIb, randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel  
group, multicentre dose ranging study to characterise the efficacy and safety of 
subcutaneous (SC) administered KY1005 in adult patients with 
moderate -to-severe AD who have a documented history, within 6  months prior 
to Baseline, of either inadequate resp onse to topi[INVESTIGATOR_155000].  The study will include a Screening period of up to 
28 days.   
During the Screening period,  
 
 
 
 
  Patients who continue to meet the eligibility 
criteria at Baseline will be randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to receive a SC dose of 
KY1005, or matching Placebo.   
At Baseline those patients not receiving a KY1005 loadin g dose will receive 
both KY1005 and Placebo to maintain the study blind.  
Four different SC KY1005 dosing regimens will be tested versus Placebo.  From 
Baseline up to Day 169 (Week 24), IMP will be administered at the following 
doses and intervals; 500  mg loading dose (given as  SC administration) 
followed 28 days later and thereafter with 250  mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or the 
following regimens from Baseline: 250  mg Q4W, or 125  mg Q4W or 62.5  mg 
Q4W or Placebo Q4W.   
In accordance with the study blind a t Baseline, a  Placebo SC dose will be 
administered along with the  KY1005 SC administration.  All patients will 
therefore receive  SC doses at Baseline.  
As part of the study design, patients initially enrolled at Baseline into the 
Placebo , 62.5  mg, 125  mg and 250  mg KY1005 treatment arms who do not 
achieve ≥  EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 at Day 169 (Week 24) will have the opportunity 
to receive KY1005 from Day 169 (Week 24) by [CONTACT_155083] a long -term 
extension (LTE) study (LTS17367, LTE). The LTE is  a separate study to

Version number: [ADDRESS_179394] an opportunity to receive treatment at 
doses expected to elicit a meaningful clinical response (based on observations 
from the Phase  2a KY1005 -CT02 study).  Patients who achieve ≥  EASI 75 or 
who attain IGA  0/1 at Day 169 (Week 24) will be randomised 3:1 to either enter 
a maintenance withdrawal pha se or continue on their pre -Week 24 dose/interval.  
The purpose being to characterise the durability of response in conjunction with 
PK following treatment discontinuation in those withdrawn from therapy and to 
assess the clinical response and long -term sa fety in those continuing to receive 
Q4W treatment at their pre -Week 24 dose. Those patients who are 
re-randomised at Day 169 (Week 24) and who subsequently lose clinical 
response, defined during that study period as the first instance of < EASI 50 and 
wher e rescue therapy is no longer permitted as per Section 5.3.4 on or after the 
Day 197 (Week  28) study visit, will be offered the opportunity to receive 
retreatment with KY1005 in the LTE study. Results from this randomised 
withdrawal maintenance phase will inform the subsequent later stage 
development of KY1005 in the treatment of AD.  
At Day 365 (Week 52), patients who complete the second study period without 
loss of clinical response will have an additional 112  days’ safety follow -up to 
Day 477 (Week 68) a nd will then be discharged from the study. The last dose 
will be administered no later than Day 337 (Week 48). If during safety follow -up 
or after the end of study this cohort of patients experience worsening of their 
AD, and in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_155001]-treatment with KY1005 is considered 
appropriate, they may be considered for enrolment in the LTE (subject to 
meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
Number of subjects:  A total of 350 patients (approximately 70 patients per treatment arm) will be 
randomised.  
Study population:  Adult patients with moderate -to-severe AD who have  a documented history, 
within 6  months prior to Baseline, of either inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_155002] (eg, not well tolerated) .

 Efficacy Analyses :  
An overall test for the treatment effect of KY1005 will be conducted.  For each 
treatment regimen and all efficacy variables, the analysis will be comparisons 
of each of the KY1005 treatment groups with the Placebo group. For the primary 
endpoint, the overall type I error rate will be controlled using a hierarchical 
testing procedure across the four dose regimens against placebo. For each 
secondary endpoint analyzed, the same multiplicity adjustment approach will be 
applied as for the primary endpoint. No multiplicity adjustment will be made 
across the endpoints.  
For the continuous endpoints : An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will 
be used.  This model includes treatment, randomisation strata ( region, disease 
severity) as fixed effects, and baseline value as a covariate.  
 
 
 
A mixed -effect model with repeated measures will be used as a sensitivity 
analysis for primary and continuous key secondary endpoints.  This model 
includes the factors (fixed effects) for treatment, randomisation  strata (region, 
disease severity), visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and relevant baseline 
value.   
For the categorical endpoints : Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by 
[CONTACT_155088] (region, disease severity) will be used at each analysi s 
timepoint.  
 
 
 
   
 
 
Data will be presented graphically, where applicable, and with summary 
statistics by [CONTACT_155089].   
Safety Analyses:  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDR A, latest version) and will be summarised in incidence tables 
by [CONTACT_39960], and by [CONTACT_71397].  Adverse 
events will be further summarised by [CONTACT_155090].  Concomitant medications will be coded using the World

 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON  
1.1 Introduction   
Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic inflammatory skin 
disorder, which has a significant impact on the health and quality of lif e (QoL) of individuals 
with the disease especially social functioning and psychological well -being.  Treatment of AD 
in general depends on the extent and severity/activity of the disease, and when topi[INVESTIGATOR_155015], systemic therapy or phototherapy are added.  
Although several systemic treatments are available, many patients do not derive optimal benefit 
due to either incomplete treatment responses or to adverse reactions.  KY1005 (also refers to 
SAR445229 or aml itelimab), a human anti -OX40 ligand (OX40L) monoclonal antibody 
(mAb), has therefore been developed to address the significant unmet medical need for 
treatment options in this patient population.   
1.2 Introduction to Atopic Dermatitis and its Biology/Mechanis m of 
Action   
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic/relapsing inflammatory skin disease, characterised by [CONTACT_155095], driven by [CONTACT_14198][INVESTIGATOR_155016] (CD) 4+ driven cutaneous inflammation [Weidinger Nat Rev 2018, Langan 
The Lancet 2020].  Lesional skin shows an altered expression of genes related to keratinocyte 
activity and differentiation as well as T cell infi ltration and activity, of genes encoding T helper 
(Th) cell Th2 associated (interleukin [IL] -4, IL -10, IL -13) and Th22 -associated (IL -22) 
proteins.  In more chronic disease stages, Th1 -mediated and Th17 -mediated responses appear 
to be upregulated as well .   
1.[ADDRESS_179416] common inflammatory skin disorder in the developed world.  
Data from the World Health Organisa tion (WHO) Global Burden of Diseases initiative indicate 
that at least [ADDRESS_179417] AD (lifetime prevalence >15%), with AD 
being the leading cause of the non -fatal disease burden conferred by [CONTACT_155096] a global 
level [Wei dinger Nat Rev 2018].  At the patient level, AD has a diverse and marked negative 
impact on QoL and places a tremendous financial burden on society and patients [Drucker 
J Invest Dermatol 2017].  Atopic dermatitis can manifest at any point in life, but the  incidence 
peaks in infancy with an estimated 80% of cases showing an onset before 6 years of age [Kay 
J Am Acad Dermatol 1994; Perkin Pediatr Allergy Immunol 2004].  After initiation, the course 
may be continuous for long periods, but may also show a rela psing remitting nature 
[Garmhausen Allergy 2013].  Conventional clinical teaching is that AD clears in more than 
50% of affected children, but recent data indicate that the proportion of patients with persistent 
or adult -onset disease or with relapses afte r longer asymptomatic intervals is much higher, and 
that AD is a lifelong disease with a highly variable phenotypic expression [Abuabara Allergy 
2018; Silverberg J Allergy Clin Immunol 2013].  
Atopic dermatitis management aims to improve symptoms and estab lish long -term disease 
control using a multi -stepped approach.   The main principles are continuous epi[INVESTIGATOR_155017] -inflammatory therapy with topi[INVESTIGATOR_155018].  When topi[INVESTIGATOR_155019], systemic

 therapy or phototherapy are indicated.  The duration of use of many systemic 
immunomodulatory agents are limited due to (cumulative) toxicity.  Newer biologic agents 
such as dupi[INVESTIGATOR_155020] -4 receptor (IL -4R) have been shown to significantly 
improve both clinical and patient reported outcomes, but the long -term durability of response 
and the ability to be disease modifying will only become apparent with broader and long -term 
use.  There remains a significant unmet need in AD with a real need to develop disease 
modifying therapi[INVESTIGATOR_155021] [Weidinger Nat 
Rev 2018] .

The Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) are KY1005 and matching Placebo . 
1.4.1 Overview of KY1005   
KY1005 (also known as KY1005 -2D10) is a biotechnology derived human anti -OX40L mAb 
(subclass G4) generated by a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line that binds OX40L to 
block the interaction with its receptor, OX40 (CD134). The Fc regions were modified to the 
immunoglobulin (Ig) G4PE variant to reduce Fc receptor binding and stabilise the antibody 
hinge region. The resulting molecule is therefore expected to have null effector function 
(known not to deplete target ce lls) and would not undergo fragment antigen -binding arm 
exchange as has been reported for natural IgG4.  
Blockade of the OX40/OX40L co -stimulation pathway represents a scientifically plausible 
approach to modulating the persistent inflammation caused by [CONTACT_155097] T -cell 
populations and may provide a means of inducing immune tolerance to autoantigens (eg,  in 
autoimmune disease) or alloantigens (eg, following transplants).  
OX40L is inducibly expressed on professional antigen -presenting cells, such as  B-cells, 
dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages upon activation [Webb Clin Rev Allergy Immunol 
2016].  Other cells such as endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, mast cells and natural killer 
cells can also be induced to express OX40L [Croft Annu Rev Immu no 2010] .  OX40L interacts 
‘monogamously’ with OX40, which is expressed on activated T -cells [Brunner J Allergy Clin 
Immuno 2017], CD4 and CD8 T -cells), inducing differentiation towards Th2, Th1, Th17 and 
Th22.  The OX40/OX40L axis has also been shown to e nhance the proliferation and activation 
of memory T cells and abrogate forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) positive regulatory T  cells (Treg) 
function [Kitamura Int J Cancer 2009]. OX40 -OX40L interaction is also necessary for the 
differentiation of activated B -cells i nto highly Ig -producing cells.  
The interaction between OX40 and OX40L occurs during the T -cell-DC interaction, between 
hours and days after antigen recognition. After disengaging from DCs, the OX40 -expressing 
T-cell may then interact with other OX40L -expre ssing cells, which in turn provide essential 
signals for the generation of memory T -cells with a drive to Th2 polarisation and the 
prolongation of the inflammatory responses.  OX40 signals render T -cells resistant to Treg 
cell-mediated suppression and furt hermore, OX40 signalling in Treg cells directly inhibits their 
suppressive function.  
In AD, OX40L has been observed to be upregulated on DCs by [CONTACT_155098], thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and other cytokines  
from Langerhans cells and keratinocytes.  It is these activated DCs that appear to require 
OX40/OX40L interaction to drive the observed Th2 activation [Ilves J Eur Acad Dermatol

 Venereol 2013].  OX40 blockade has been shown to reduce the Th2 response in A D, and 
suppression of Th1 and Th17/Th22 inflammatory biomarkers has also been observed 
supporting the notion that the OX40/OX40L pathway has a central role in both acute and 
chronic phases of AD [Guttman -Yassky J Invest Dermatol 2018] .  
KY1005 has been adm inistered to healthy volunteers and to patients with moderate -to-severe 
AD.  The findings from both studies are summarised below in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]  and more detailed 
information can be found in the KY1005 Investigator’s Brochure (IB).   
Further to the data generated with KY1005an anti -OX40 IgG1 mAb, GBR  830/ISB830, has 
been tested in patients with moderate -to-severe AD in a Phase  2a study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) 
[Guttman -Yassky J Invest Dermatol 2018; Gutman -Yassky J Allergy Clin Immunol 2019].  
Data from this study also support inhibition of the OX40/OX40L pathway as a target for the 
treatment of AD.  Clinical improvement elicited by [CONTACT_85869]  830 was associated with s tatistically 
significant reductions from Baseline (p  <0.01) in AD biomarkers, including Th2 chemokines 
(chemokine [C -C motif] ligand [CCL] 17 and 11, TSLP receptor), Th1/interferon (IFN) 
markers (IFN -γ, chemokine [C -X-C motif] ligand [CXCL] 10) and Th17/Th 22-associated 
products (IL -23p19, S100A9/S100A12), indicating an effect on both the acute and chronic 
stages of AD.   
These data support the hypothesis that blocking the OX40/OX40L pathway may not only 
deliver symptomatic relief but also have potential to be disease modifying.  There was no 
immediate evidence of treatment limiting adverse events (AEs), although it should be noted 
that only small numbers of patients were treated.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Non-clinical Data   
In Vitro Characterisation  
KY1005 has high affinity for human OX40L and blocks its interaction with OX40 in 
biochemical assays in vitro .  OX40L evoked cytokine release was inhibited in a concentration 
dependent manner by [CONTACT_155093]1005 in primary h uman T -cell preparations and in an allogeneic 
mixed lymphocyte reaction stimulated by [CONTACT_155099]40L expressed on primary DCs.  
Demonstration of poor or no binding to human Fc  receptors indicates that KY1005 is unlikely 
to cause Fc  receptor -mediated OX40L -superclustering and consequent activation of target 
downstream pathway(s).  
In Vivo Characterisation  
Treatment of cynomolgus monkeys with KY1005 resulted in inhibition of the T-dependent 
antibody response  (TDAR).  KY1005 reduced the IgG antibody response to primary and 
secondary keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) challenge to a similar extent at all dose levels 
tested (5 to 100  mg/kg).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Clinical Data   
KY1005 has been administered to healthy volunteers (Studies KY1005 -CT01 and 
KY1005 -CT04) and to patients with moderate -to-severe AD (Study  KY1005 -CT02).  These 
studies are summarised below; further information can be found in the KY1005 IB.  
Study KY1005 -CT01  
Study KY1005 -CT01 was the First -in-Human (FIH) study of KY1005 that explored the safety 
and tolerability of single and repeat doses of  KY1005 in healthy volunteers.   
This study was conducted at a single investigative site, in line with a typi[INVESTIGATOR_155022].  The study was composed of 8 ascending dose cohorts.  All cohorts comprised 8 healthy 
volunteers allocated at rando m to either active (6 subjects) or matching Placebo (2  subjects).  
 
  
Study KY1005 -CT02  
The recently completed Phase 2a (KY1005 -CT02), randomised, double -blind, placebo 
controlled, parallel group, multicentre study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of 
monotherapy KY1 [ADDRESS_179419] 14 days prior to Baseline (except bland moisturisers).  Patients were randomised 
in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either an IV lower dose (200  mg loading/100 mg maintenance) or 
higher dose (500 mg l oading/250 mg maintenance) of KY1005, or matching Placebo.  Patients 
received KY1005 or Placebo every 4  weeks (Q4W) from Baseline to Day 85 (Week 12) when 
the last dose was received.  
The primary analysis occurred once all patients had completed Day 113 (W eek 16) (or

 safety.  The co -primary endpoints were percentage change in the EASI score from Baseline to 
Day 113 (Week 16) and the incidence of treatment -emergent adver se events (TEAEs).  
To explore the durability of effect for up to Day 253 (Week 36) from Baseline, patients who 
responded (IGA 0/1) at the Day 113 (Week 16) assessment were invited to continue with 
assessments up to the time that they relapse or commence dr ugs that have a significant impact 
on AD.   
All patients were followed from Day 113 (Week 16) to Day 253 (Week 36) as part of safety 
follow -up. 
Efficacy Outcomes  
Meaningful efficacy differences in the key endpoints (EASI and SCORAD) between those 
receivin g KY1005 and Placebo from Day 15 (Week 2) and maintained to the primary endpoint 
(Day  113 [Week 16]).  Supporting efficacy, an improvement in pruritis was also observed.  No 
meaningful difference between the KY1005 treatment arms was noted ( Table 1-1).

Study KY1 005-CT04  
KY1005 -CT04 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) was a Phase  1, open label study to assessing the PK of 
KY1005 after single dose administration by [CONTACT_155100].  
The purpose of this study was to assess the PK of KY1005 after SC adminis tration and to 
compare the safety and tolerability of KY1005 when given via SC injection and IV infusion, 
to support SC administration.  Intravenous KY1005 was included as a reference treatment.  
Twenty -four healthy volunteers were enrolled as 3 treatment groups of 8 healthy male subjects.  
The primary endpoint was the characterisation of the PK of SC and IV administered KY1005 
after a single dose.  Key secondary endpoints included  safety and tolerability.  
 
 
 
   
1.5 Rationale   
1.5.1 Study Rationale and Purpose   
The aim of this current study is to further characterise the efficacy (including 
dose/exposure -response) and safety of KY1005 across a range of doses/exposures for a 
maximum duration of [ADDRESS_179420] had 
an inadequate response to topi[INVESTIGATOR_155023].  This 
24-week Placebo -controlled dose ranging period will be followed, in those patients who 
achieve an ≥  EASI 75 and/or IGA 0/1, with a randomised withdrawal period to Day 365

 (Week  52) to characterise the durability of respons e ahead of the anticipated Phase III 
programme.   
KY1005 is a subclass G4 mAb that targets human OX40L to block interaction with its receptor 
OX40 and is predicted  to suppress the inflammatory responses associated with AD.  The ability 
of KY1005 to improve  the signs and symptoms of this disease has been reported in an initial 
Phase  2a study (Study  KY1005 -CT02) in this patient population.  Based on observations from 
the completed healthy volunteer studies  (KY1005 -CT01 and KY1005 -CT04), and the 
KY1005 -CT02 st udy in AD, KY1005 has, to date, been shown to be well tolerated.  
Whilst KY1005 has previously been evaluated as an IV formulation the current study will 
evaluate SC KY1005.  A SC formulation would potentially provide more flexible options for 
patients, en abling treatment in a patient’s home as well as in the clinic.  In a toxicology study 
in cynomolgus monkeys using the same SC formulation intended for administration to humans, 
no KY1005 -specific risks associated with any local toxicity at the injection si tes were 
identified.  In the healthy volunteer SC KY1005 -CT04 safety and tolerability study no 
treatment limiting AEs were noted and the safety and tolerability profile was unremarkable.  
Based on these data, in combination with the available information f or the IV formulation, the 
SC KY1005 is anticipated to be well tolerated.  
1.5.2 Rationale for Dose Selection   
A total of 4 dosing groups plus Placebo will be tested in this study.  The  chosen doses and 
dosing regimens will allow for thorough assessment of the dose and exposure response 
relationship.  This type of approach has been adopted in previous Phase 2b studies in AD 
[Thaçi  D et al, 2016, Guttman -Yassky E 2020].  Given the challen ges of needle burden on 
compliance in AD the ability to provide less frequent dosing has been an influencing factor on 
the choice of doses and intervals proposed.  
 
  
 
 
  The 250 mg SC Q4W with a 500  mg loading dose, 
250 mg SC Q4W, 125 mg SC Q4W and 62.5 mg SC Q4W KY1005 doses will be administered 
to patients to assess the dose/exposure response across an a ppropriate exposure range.

Initial treatment period: Dose and interval justification to Day 169 (Week 24)  
The dose and dosing regimen that is expected to be able to maintain similar exposures to those 
observed in CT02 trial, as well as concentrations in tissues above the targeted range 
, during the [ADDRESS_179421] range of doses will be tested in this dose response study to cover the dose range 
which will capture the dose response and inform the benefit/risk assessment across these dose 
levels . 
The dose and dosing regimen for the period fr om Baseline to Day 169 (Week 24) for dosing 
Group 1 is 250 mg administered Q4W, 28 days following a loading dose of 500  mg at Baseline 
( ).  Using this approach, this dose and dose regimen is 
expected to achieve an earlier steady -state, and a C max, from the first dosing, close to that 
observed in the CT02 trial.   
The dose and dosing regimen for the period from Baseline to Day 169 (Week 24) for dosing 
Group 2 is 250  mg SC administered Q4W  with a second  injection of 
 placebo dose at Baseline (Day 1) to protect the blind.  Using this approach this dose and 
dosing regimen is expected to maintain concentrations in blood (C min)  
 
 
The dose and dosing regimen for the period from Baseline to Day 169 (Week 24) for dosing 
Group 3 is 125 mg administered Q4W  with a second injection of  
Placebo dose at Baseline (D ay 1) to protect the blind.  This is expected to provide exposures 
slightly lower than the ones observed in CT02 at the low dose .  This dose and dosing regimen 
is expected to maintain concentrations in blood 
  
The dose and dosing regimen for the period from Baseline to Day 169 (Week 24) for the last 
KY1005 dosing Group 4 is 62.5 mg administered Q4W   with a second 
injection of  placebo dose at Baseline (Day 1) to protect the blind.  The objective of this 
dose and dosing regimen is to characterize a dose response that was not evaluated during the

expanded characterization of the dose response.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
The 24 -week Placebo -control period has been selected as based on the Phase 2a study the 
maximum clinical response was not observed at the Day 113 (Week 16) primary endpoint after 
12 weeks of treatment ie, a plateau in clinic al response was not achieved.  It is expected with 
further treatment improved benefits will be observed.  The use of a 24 -week Placebo controlled 
period has been employed in the AD study setting before [Silverberg et al. 2019].  The primary 
endpoint of per centage change in EASI will be at Day 113 (Week 16).  This timepoint is typi[INVESTIGATOR_155024]  2b studies in AD.  Topi[INVESTIGATOR_155025] 15 (Week 2)

Safety considerations  
The highest dose -regimen chosen for the Phase  2b study (a loading dose of 500 mg SC followed 
by Q4W administration of 250 mg SC) is the same as the highest dose administered via the IV 
route in the Ph 2a study (KY1005 -CT02).  
 
 Even higher doses were administered to healthy volunteers in the FIH study 
(KY1005 -CT01), where the top (loading) dose was 12 mg/kg, which in an 85 kg individual 
would e quate to a single flat dose of 1,020 mg. In this study, one AE of note occurred at the 
top dose of systemic allergic reaction. However, this dose level was far higher than that being 
tested in patients in the Phase 2b study. No otherwise clinically signifi cant AEs, SAEs or deaths 
occurred at any dose level in KY1005 -CT01.  
The total patient exposure (years) for KY1005 -CT02 is 15.[ADDRESS_179422] Week 24 period: Randomised withdrawal design to inform Phase III extended dosing

Loss of clinical response  
Loss of clinical response is defined as the first instance of <EASI 50 during the second study 
period and where rescue therapy is no longer permitted as per Section 5.3.4 .   
If loss of clinical  response occurs on or after the Day 197 (Week 28) visit, Investigators will 
be able to choose to either discontinue the patient from KY1005 -CT05 (DRI17366)  or to 
progress to the LTE study (LTS17367, LTE).   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.5.3 Study Design Rationale   
This Phase IIb study is a randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled study of 365  days 
duration (plus screening and safety follow -up) that will be conducted  to assess the efficacy and 
safety of monotherapy SC KY1005 in approximately 350  adult patients with 
moderate -to-severe AD.  Sites will be selected globally to participate in this study.  A parallel 
group design will be employed due to the testing of up to  4 different dose regimens versus 
Placebo.  This is considered appropriate for a study of this type (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/[ZIP_CODE]/07 
[Rev. 1] and ICH E4).

Version number: [ADDRESS_179423] either had an

inadvisable.  It is recognised, based on prior studies in AD with a similar design [Thaçi The 
Lancet 2016],  that the dropout rate can be relatively high (~20%) and this has been factored 
into the anticipated numbers of patients that will be recruited.  
Although the study represents the initial clinical evaluation of SC KY1005, the enrolment of 
up to [ADDRESS_179424] identified no 
KY1005 -specific risks or local toxicity at the injection sites at clinically relevant doses.  
The primary objective of this study will be to compare the dose respon se of 4 different dose 
regimens of KY1005 in patients with AD versus Placebo to Day  113 (Week 16).  As part of 
the study design, patients initially enrolled at Baseline into the Placebo, 62.5  mg,125  mg and 
250 mg KY1005 treatment arms who do not achieve ≥  EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 at Day 169 
(Week  24) will have the opportunity to be to receive KY1005 from Day  169 (Week 24) by 
[CONTACT_155101].  This will enable all enrolled patients to have an opportunity to 
receive treatment at doses expected to elicit a  meaningful clinical response (based on what was 
observed in the Phase 2a KY1005 -CT02 study).   
Patients who achieve ≥  EASI 75 or who attain IGA 0/1 at Day 169 (Week  24) be randomised 
3:1 to either enter a maintenance withdrawal phase or continue their pre -Week  24 dose/interval.  
The purpose being to characterise the durability of response in conjunction with PK following 
treatment discontinuation in those withdrawn from therapy and to assess the clinical response 
in those continuing to receive Q4W treatmen t at their pre -Week  24 dose.  Those patients who 
are randomised to the second study period who subsequently lose clinical response will be 
offered the opportunity to receive retreatment with KY1005 in the LTE study.  Results from 
this randomised withdrawal  maintenance phase will inform the subsequent later stage 
development of KY1005 in the treatment of AD.  
The maximum length of the study is 365  days plus safety follow -up. Those patients who 
achieve ≥  EASI 75 or who attain IGA 0/1 at Day 169 (Week 24) and complete the second study 
period without loss of clinical response at Day 365 (Week 52) will have an additional 112 -day 
safety follow -up after Day 365 (Week 52) (total of [ADDRESS_179425] dose of IMP on Day 337 [Week 48]). If during safety follow -up or after the end of study 
this cohort of patients experience worsening of their AD, and in the investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_155028]-treatment with KY1005 is considered appropriate, they may be considered for enrolment in 
the LTE (subject to me eting inclusion/exclusion criteria).  
1.5.[ADDRESS_179426] the study at selected global sites.  
All study procedures will be conducted by [CONTACT_155102], including Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and experience of 
clinical trials.  Investigators must understand specific characteristics of the IMP and of its target

moderate -or-severe (regardless of seriousness) adverse reactions which are at tributed to the 
IMP.  There will be no obligation to unblind treatment allocation in making this decision.  
The Sponsor may discontinue the entire study at any time based on information received during 
the running of the study that demonstrates an unexpected risk or absence of benefit to patients.  
This may for example follow the request of the IDMC or where add itional information emerges 
either during the study or from other sources (eg, literature or Health Authorities).   
If the study is discontinued, where patients withdraw early or where IMP has been discontinued 
by [CONTACT_737], patients will be require d to be followed -up for a minimum of [ADDRESS_179442] will be generated by [CONTACT_155103]  
(SAS®). 
All patients who have completed all Screening assessments and are confirmed as eligible by 
[CONTACT_155104]. In cases where screen failure 
occurs due to a laboratory abnorm ality and is due to reasons expected to change at re -screening 
and based upon the Investigator’s clinical judgment, the patient may be re -screened one time 
for this study following notification to the Sponsor. Randomisation may be performed up to 
[ADDRESS_179443] administration of KY1005 if all inclusion/exclusion criteria have been 
satisfied. Each of the 5 treatment regimens (see Table 5-1) will comprise approximately 
70 patients (based on 30% drop out rate to Day 169 [Week 24], it is assumed that 49  patients 
will complete the study) who will be allocated to treatment with KY1005 or Placebo in an equa l 
(1:1:1:1:1) ratio.   
Patients will be centrally randomised. Once confirmed as eligible for the study, patients will 
be allocated a randomisation number using an IRT system, corresponding to the next available 
randomised treatment, in a consecutive order starting with the lowest number.  
The randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_89309] (moderate/severe) and region . 
Further randomisation will occur at Day  169 (Week  24) in those patients who achieve 
≥ EASI  75 or who attain IGA 0/1.  Patients will be r andomised in a 3:1 ratio to either enter a 
withdrawal cohort (receiving Placebo Q4W) or to remain on their pre -Week  24 dose/interval. 
This Day 169 (Week 24) randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_155105] (IGA 0/1 or IGA 2, 
3, 4).

 3.7 Blinding   
The study is double -blind. All patients, the Investigators and their study teams, the Sponsor 
(with exception of Sponsor Chemistry and Manufacturing Controls [CMC] Clinical Supplies 
Manager), C linical Contract Research Organisation (CRO) (with the exception of the 
unblinded statistician(s), [COMPANY_003] Drug Supply Manager and IRT team), clinical laboratories 
(except those responsible for drug concentration analysis) and the IDMC will be blinded to 
treatment regimen until Day 169 (Week 24) has been completed for all patients and the 
database has been locked for analysis for the Day 169 (Week 24) data. IDMC members can 
have access to unblinded data sooner than the mentioned timepoint if that is necessary t o 
perform data monitoring activities, and for safety purposes. Thereafter, the study data up to 
Day 169 (Week 24) will be unblinded to everyone except the study site and patients.  
Re-randomisation from Day 169 (Week 24) will not be unblinded to the team ( except for those 
team members listed above).  
Study sites and patients will not be unblinded at any stage until after the final Data Base Lock.  
If deemed necessary by [CONTACT_31849], [COMPANY_003] will select an unblinded statistician among its 
statisticians.   
The work of  [COMPANY_003] unblinded staff in support of the IDMC will be performed on an unblinded 
portal with access to unblinded personnel only.  
[COMPANY_003] will generate the trial treatment randomisation codes and provide these to the IRT for 
inclusion in the IRT system.  Randomisa tion codes will be controlled in the IRT system and 
procedures for breaking the codes in an emergency will be made available to relevant members 
of study site staff, the [COMPANY_003] Medical Monitor and the Sponsor Study Responsible medical 
Officer.  
At the assay i nstitutions charged for ADA and PK measurements, samples will be analysed 
prior to database lock leading to unblinding of responsible bioanalysts. Bioanalysts are 
excluded from the Operation’s Team and results will not be communicated to the sites during 
the study.  
Following written confirmation of database lock, assignment of patients to the analysis 
populations and finalisation of the study SAP, the study will be unblinded.  The date, time, 
signature [CONTACT_155184] e lock, for the assignment of 
patients to the analysis populations and for treatment code -break (unblinding) will be recorded 
in order to verify that unblinding occurred in the correct sequence.  
For procedures to unblind an individual patient treatment in an emergency, see Section  8.2.[ADDRESS_179444] completed the study and the database has been locked.

from the time of menarche until becoming postmenopausal (see below) unless permanently 
sterile  (see below).

 • A postmenopausal state is defined as the period of time after a woman has experienced 
no menses for 12 consecutive months without an alternative medical cause.  
• A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range should  
be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception 
or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months of 
amenorrhea, confirmation with more than one FSH measurement is required.  
Permanent sterilization m ethods include:  
• Documented hysterectomy;  
• Documented bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656];  
• Documented bilateral oophorectomy;  
• For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than 
the above, (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivi ty, gonadal dysgenesis), 
investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry eligibility.  
Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical 
records, medical examination, or medical history interview . 
If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot 
be confirmed before first administration of IMP, additional evaluation should be considered.  
The Investigator must consult the Medical Monitor if there is doubt whether a patient is of 
childbearing potential.  
See Section  4.5 for adequate bi rth control (contraception and sterilisation) for WOCBP.   
Males participating in the study with partners of childbearing potential must ensure adequate 
birth control measures are taken from Baseline and for a period after they last receive IMP (see 
Sectio n 4.5). 
The Investigator must consult the Medical Monitor if there is doubt whether a patient qualifies 
as undertaking adequate birth control.  
4.5 Cont raceptive Precautions   
• WOCBP and males with partners of childbearing potential (see  Section  4.4) must 
ensure adequate birth control precautions are undertaken from Baseline until 5 months 
after Day  337 (Week 48) or the early termination visit (if prior to Day  337) unless 
entering the LT E. WOCBP should agree to use a contraceptive method that is highly 
effective (with a failure rate of <1% per year), as described in Section 17.10  
(Appendix  10) Contraception and Barrier Guidance.  
• Adequate contraception inc ludes the combined oral contraceptive pi[INVESTIGATOR_4382] (if judged by [CONTACT_155107]), intra -uterine devices and contraceptive implants.  
Periodic abstinence, single barrier methods of contraception and progesterone -only 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_155041] h inhibition of ovulation, even in those aged over 40  years are 
examples of inadequate contraception. See Section 17.10  (Appendix 10) for further 
detail.  
• For both WOCBP and males with a partner of childbearing potential ad equate 
sterilisation includes vasectomy and abdominal (including laparoscopic) and 
hysteroscopic female sterilisation.

 • Male patients should be advised of the benefit for a female partner to use a highly 
effective method of contraception (as described in Section 17.10  (Appendix 10) 
Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance) as a condom may break or leak when having 
sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) who is not 
currently pregnant.  
• Male patients with a pregnant partner must undertake some barrier protection, such as 
a condom until 5 months after Day  337 (Week 48) or the early termination visit (if prior 
to Day  337).   
• Female patients must not breastfeed until 5 months after Day  337 (Wee k 48) or the 
early termination visit (if prior to Day  337).   
• Patients must not donate or cryopreserve sperm/ova until 5 months after Day  337 
(Week 48) or the early termination visit (if prior to Day  337).  If male patients with a 
pregnant partner enter th e LTE study, then barrier protection should be used as per the 
study protocol.  
The Investigator must consult the Medical Monitor if there is doubt whether a patient qualifies 
as undertaking adequate birth control.  
4.6 Screen Failures   
Screen failures are defined as patients who consent to participate in the clinical study but are 
not subsequently randomised.  A minimal set of screen failure information is required to ensure 
transparent  reporting of screen failure patients to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting 
Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory 
authorities. Minimal information includes demography, screen failure reasons, eligibili ty 
criteria, and any SAE.  
In cases where original screen failure was as a result of a laboratory abnormality due to reasons 
expected to change at re -screening and based upon the Investigator’s clinical judgment, the 
patient may be re -screened one time for this study after notification of the Sponsor.  A different 
patient identification number will be issued.  There is no requirement for a waiting period 
between the screen -failure and the re -screening.  Patients that are re -screened will be required 
to sign a new consent form.  
4.7 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention   
Recruitment for this study will be competitive.  
Patients may be selected from the participating sites patient databa ses (if applicable) in 
accordance with the study eligibility criteria (see  Section  4.2 and Section 4.3).  Patients may 
be contact[CONTACT_5143], e -mail or in writing if applicable.  Advertisements may be used to 
aid patient recruitment; however, prior to implementation, all advertising and mar keting 
material available to patients must be submitted to the Independent Ethics Committee  
(IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) for approval (see Section  12.1).  After provision of 
the Informed Consent Form (ICF), patients will be screened at the respective site.

Assessments (Section 6.1, Table  6-1, Table  6-2, Table  6-3, Table  6-4). 
5.2.5 Treatment Duration   
All pat ients treated with KY1005 or matching Placebo will be randomised and begin study 
treatment on Day  1. Patients will initially receive SC injections of IMP Q4W to Day 169 
(Week  24).  The Day 113 (Week 16) primary analysis will occur once all patients have re ached 
the Day 169 (Week  24) visit (or earlier in the event of termination).   
Those patients in the 500  mg loading with 250  mg Q4W treatment arm will  
 commence 250  mg Q4W on Day 29 (Week 4).  
 
 
 
As outlined previously, th ose patients who achieve ≥  EASI 75 or who attain IGA 0/1 at 
Day 169 (Week  24) will be re -randomised pre -injection at Day  169 (Week 24) to either the 
Withdrawal arm (and receive Placebo Q4W) or remain on their pre -Week 24 dose for the 
second study period.  
The duration of treatment will therefore be up to Day  365 (Week 52), with last dose 
administered on Day 337 for those patients who achieve ≥  EASI 75 or who attain IGA 0/1 at 
Day 169 (Week 24), irrespective of whether response is maintained to Day 365 (Week 52) and 
they enter safety follow -up or they experience loss of clinical response at or after Day 197 
(Week 28) and enter the LTE.  
Those patients who do not achieve ≥  EASI 75 or IGA 0/1 at Day 169 (Week 24) will have the 
possibility to enter the LTE at Day 169.

 5.2.6 Guidance for Overdose   
Overdose is defined 
 In the unlikely event that an overdose of KY1005 is administered, the patient will 
be observed and treated symptomatically. The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) 
should be clearly specified  in the verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms.  
   If severe adverse 
reactions occur after an overdose of KY1005, then plasmapheresis (or infusion of albumin)  to 
reduce the drug exposure may be considered.  
All instances of symptomatic overdose, both serious and non -serious, will be reported to the 
Sponsor (or designee) as AESIs within 24  hours of learning of the event (see Section  8.1.3 ). 
5.2.7 Dose Modification   
 
 
 
 
5.3 Concomitant Medication and Dietary Supplements   
Any treatment (including nutritional supplements) or procedure administered from the time of 
consent to the EOS Visit is considered concomitant and will be recorded in the eCRF.  This 
includes permitted medications ongoing at the time of consent.  Concomitant medications and 
procedures are allowed, except for those listed in Section  5.3.2 . 
Prior medications will not be recorded in the eCRF, except for prior use of systemic 
corticosteroids, systemic calcineurin inhibitors, and systemic treatment for AD or other 
indications  with an immunosuppressive/immunomodulating substance including (but not 
limited to) dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458], JAKi and aIL13 mABs, with reason for discontinuation recorded where 
available.  
5.3.1 Permitted Concomitant Therapy   
Other than the prohibited medications listed in Section  5.3.2, treatment with concomitant 
medication is permitted during t he study.  This includes treatment with oral contraceptives, 
nasal, otological, and inhaled corticosteroids for any duration, and oral or topi[INVESTIGATOR_155044] 2  weeks for AD -associated superficial skin infections.  
5.3.2 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy (a nd Procedures)   
Treatment with the following concomitant medications is prohibited during the study:  
• Dupi[INVESTIGATOR_12458] . 
• Topi[INVESTIGATOR_155045] (exceptions might a pply, see 
Section  4.3 and Section 5.3.4 , Section 5.3.5 ).

(including, but not limite d to aIL13 mABs, JAKi, aOX40 mAbs, cyclosporine, 
mycophenolate -mofetil, IFN -γ, azathioprine, methotrexate, or biologics).  
• Treatment with a live (attenuated) immunisation (Note: immunisation with inactivated 
seasonal influenza vaccine and inactivated adenov irus COVID -19 vaccines is permitted 
(see Section 5.3.3 ).  COVID -19 vaccines should not be administered within 14 days 
prior to Baseline or within 14 days immediately prior to, or following, IMP 
administration.  
The following concomitant procedures are prohibited during study participation:  
• Elective surgical procedures.  
• Ultraviolet (UV) procedures (phototherapy [narrowband UVB, UVB, UVA1 
orpsoralen UVA]).  
• Tanning in a booth/parlour.  
• More than [ADDRESS_179457]  COVID -19, it is 
strongly recommended that patients complete their COVID -19 vaccination schedule (per local 
requirements) a minimum of [ADDRESS_179458] dose of IMP.  
 
The safety profile and effectiveness of COVID -19 vaccines on people with compromised 
immune systems or therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (such as KY1005) that modify or that suppress th eir immune 
response is not yet established.  
While vaccination with an approved COVID -19 vaccine (including booster dose) is widely 
recommended (AAD COVID -19 Vaccine Administration Guidance, 2021; EADV Task Force 
Covid Vaccination Advice, 2021), a patient’s  decision to have a COVID -19 vaccination during 
the study should only be made after discussing with his/her physician and the Investigator to 
assess the benefits/risks of receiving a COVID -[ADDRESS_179459] of KY1005 on overall vaccination response, new and recall response, for both

Version number: [ADDRESS_179460] 14 days following randomisation. Any AD rescue 
therapy administration either topi[INVESTIGATOR_19529] l or systemic during this period will result in permanent 
discontinuation from the IMP. Bland emollients are not considered rescue therapy for AD, and 
should be maintained during this period as per protocol.  
If medically unavoidable after Day 14 (ie, to co ntrol intolerable AD symptoms), rescue 
treatment for AD may be provided to study patients at the discretion of the Investigator.  For 
the purpose of efficacy analysis, patients who receive rescue topi[INVESTIGATOR_155046].   
If topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] ( TCS) are needed, it is recommended that the investigator start with 
the least potent TCS for the fac e (eg, hydrocortisone 2.5% cream/ointment) and moderately 
potent TCS for the body (eg, triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream/ointment), applied up to 
twice daily. Where the use of moderate potency topi[INVESTIGATOR_11930] (TCS) are not 
considered clinically ap propriate, low potency TCS or topi[INVESTIGATOR_155047], however, these should be reserved for problem areas only. Topi[INVESTIGATOR_22732]4 inhibitors are 
also permitted.  
Participants should use topi[INVESTIGATOR_155048] a maximum of 2 occasions during study participation, and for a 
maximum of 2 consecutive weeks on each occasion .  
If a patient receives rescue treatment with high potency TCS, systemic corticosteroids or 
non-steroidal systemic immu nosuppressive drugs (cyclosporine, methotrexate, 
mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, etc) or receives more than [ADDRESS_179461] efficacy and safety as sessments immediately before 
administering any rescue treatment.  An unscheduled visit may be required.   
All patients should complete the schedule of study visits and assessments whether or not they 
complete study treatment and whether or not they receive  rescue treatment for AD.  If a patient 
has IMP permanently discontinued due to the taking of systemic therapy rescue but consent is 
retained, study assessments may be continued until Day 169 (Week 24) for patients who 
discontinue IMP in the first study pe riod, or until Day  365 (Week 52) or the end of the safety 
follow -up period (whichever is longer) in patients who discontinue IMP after Day 169 
(Week  24).   
5.3.5 Background Therapy   
Patients are required to apply a stable dose of a topi[INVESTIGATOR_155007] (simple moisturiser) at 
least twice daily for a minimum of 7  consecutive days before the Baseline Visit (see 
Section  4.2) and to continue with the same emollient at the same dose twice daily throughout 
their participation in the study.   
To permit an adequate assessment of skin dryness, moisturisers should not b e applied on area(s) 
of non -lesional skin, designated as such for assessment purposes, for at least 8  hours before 
each clinic visit.

 Patients are permitted to use any simple bland prescription, over -the-counter or general 
purchase moisturiser providing it  contains NO additives, such as corticosteroids or urea (even 
at low concentrations).  The type/brand of emollient will be recorded in the eCRF.  Prescription 
and non -prescription moisturisers with additives (eg, urea, filaggrin, niacinamide, ceramides, 
bisabolol) are not permitted within [ADDRESS_179462] IMP administration ( Baseline; see 
Section  4.3) or during the study.  
5.[ADDRESS_179463] maintain a relatively constant level of exercise during study participation through 
to Day  365 (Week 52) and refrain from unusually strenuous physical activities to avoid a 
potentially confounding effect on safety assessments caused by [CONTACT_14759] -related changes in 
serum enzymes of clinical importance (eg, creatine phosphokinase [CPK], lactate 
dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase [AST ], alanine aminotransferase [AL T]).  In 
addition, patient s should avoid excessive alcohol intake and the use of drugs of abuse during 
the study.  
5.5 Patient Numbering and Treatment Assignment   
Patients will be ide ntified with unique patient numbers assigned by [CONTACT_155109].  This unique patient number will identify the patient in all study databases 
(eg, eCRF, central laboratory, etc) and will be linked to the patient’s name [CONTACT_155185] (ISF).  Patient numbers assigned by [CONTACT_155110].  If a patient 
withdraws from the study the patient number will not be re -used.  
Patient eligibility will be established before IMP is allocated to individual patients by [CONTACT_155111].

accordance with EudraLex, Volume 4 GMP Guidelines, Annex  13, IND and other local 
regulatory requirements.  Labels will be translated in local language as required.  Replacement 
supplies will be available at each sit e, in case of damage to the originally assigned kit.  The 
replacement kits will also be assigned to the patient via the IRT system.  
Procedures for breaking the codes in an emergency will be provided via the IRT system, to 
relevant members of study site staff and the [COMPANY_003] Medical Monitor.  This will be activated prior 
to or concurrent with receipt of the IMPs and will be described in the  study specific Pharmacy 
Manual.

doses using IMP kits assigned by [CONTACT_155113].   
 
 
 
 
Records of the actual storage conditions during the period of the study must be maintained 
(eg, records of the date and time and initials of person checking, and the daily (weekday) 
temperatures of the area used for storage of study drug) and provided to the Sponsor for 
retention in the electronic Trial Master File (eTMF).  
5.7 Procedures for Monitori ng Patient Compliance   
The Investigator is responsible for the administration of the IMP.  The Study Monitor will 
assess compliance throughout the study by [CONTACT_155114]/accountability 
records on a periodic basis as outlined in the monitoring plan and guidelines.  
Sites should also discuss study procedure compliance with the patients, as required.

 6.2 Screening Procedures   
6.2.1 Written Informed Consent   
Written informed consent for the study w ill be obtained from each patient before any 
protocol -specific assessments or procedures are carried out.  
At the Screening Visit (or at a prior interview), the Investigator will explain the aims, methods, 
anticipated benefits and potential risks of partici pating in the study and should inform the 
patient that participation is voluntary and that they can withdraw from the study at any time.  
Each patient will be given a study -specific Patient Information Sheet (PIS), as part of the 
informed consent process, to read and will be given adequate time to ask questions.  In 
accordance with ICH GCP and 21 CFR 50, informed consent shall be documented using an 
ICF approved by [CONTACT_155120]/ IRBs.  The ICF will be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_102] 
(or patient’s leg al representative) and by [CONTACT_52223].  
In exceptional circumstances, such as a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency, consent may be collected through a remote solution if  allowed thr ough 
country and site regulations and following approval by [CONTACT_6179]/IRB .  Implementation must 
have prior approval from the Sponsor (or its designee).   
In case of ICF amendment while the patients  are still included in the study, they must be 
re-consented t o the most current version of the ICF(s).  Where patients  are no longer in the 
study, teams in charge of the amendment must define if those patients  must or not re -consent 
or be informed of the amendment (eg, if the processing of personal data is modified,  if the 
Sponsor changes, etc).  
In addition to the ICF for the study, the patient will be asked if they would like to participate 
in the pharmacogenomic sampling section of the study.  Consent for this will be in addition to 
the main consent.  Lack of informed consent to participate in t he pharmacogenomic sampling 
section of the study does not preclude patients from participating in the clinical study.  
At selected sites, patients will be asked to participate in a biopsy sub -study.  Consent for this 
will be in addition to the main study c onsent. Biopsies will not be conducted in patients if there 
is a contraindication to the procedure in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649]. Lack of consent to 
participate in the biopsy sub -study does not preclude patients from participating in the main 
clinical stud y.  
In addition, the patient will be asked if the samples collected from them can be stored and used 
for possible future analyses.  Lack of informed consent for future analysis of samples does not 
preclude patients from participating in the clinical study.   
Informed consent will be documented in the patient’s  medical records, as required by 21  CFR 
Part 312.62.  The patient should be given a copy of the PIS and their signed and dated ICF, and 
the original ICF should be filed in the ISF.  
6.2.2 Demographic Informat ion  
Demographic information will be collected at the Screening Visit as follows:  
• Age.  
• Year of birth.

 • Gender (sex).  
• Race.  
• Ethnicity.  
6.2.3 Medical History   
The Investigator will be responsible for review of the medical history (including AD history) 
of patients to ensure that they meet the criteria for eligibility for the study.  This will include a 
review of the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, includ ing review for drugs of abuse (see 
Section  6.4.6 ), which will be repeated at the Baseline Visit.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Blood Test   
A whole blood sample will be collected from each patient at the Screening Visit for the 
QuantiFERON®-TB Gold blood test (see Section  6.7).  
Detailed instructions for blood sample collection, preparation and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_22016] 
a laboratory manual to be finalised before the samples are collected.  Samples will be shippe d 
to and analysed by [CONTACT_155121].  
Positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold blood test is an exclusion criterion. If an indeterminate 
result is found at the first evaluable test, a retest should be performed as soon as possible. If the 
second evaluable test is n egative, patient is not excluded. If the second evaluable test is either 
indeterminate or positive, patient is excluded. In the event of test cancelation, a retest should 
be performed as soon as possible, and the cancelation will not account as an evaluabl e test 
result for the procedure mentioned in this paragraph.  
6.2.4 Concomitant Medications   
Concomitant medications will be recorded at Screening and throughout the study at the 
timepo ints outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (see  Table  6-1, Table  6-2, Table  6-3 and 
Table  6-4). 
Data should be collected for all medicines (including emollients and 
natural/herbal/prescription/over -the-counter/contraceptive etc). The following information 
should be recorded on the eCRF: drug/therapy name (pro duct name), route, dose and units, 
frequency, indication, reference to AE if applicable, start date, end date or ongoing at the EOS.  
6.[ADDRESS_179481] and the NRS for pruritus.  Patients will be required to use an 
internet -enabled device (eg, computer, mobile phone or tablet device) to complete an electronic 
diary to record the PROs in local languages where validated.  Patients should bring their eDiary 
to visits and review with coordinators.  Patients will be encouraged to continue completing 
diary information until their last visit.

 Where possible, the PRO assessments completed at the study site are to be completed by 
[CONTACT_155117].  
All assessments will be performed at the timepoints outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(see Table  6-1, Table  6-2 and Table  6-3). 
Sites should discuss study procedure compliance with the patients, as required.  
6.3.1 Eczema Area Severity Index   
The EASI is an Investigator -assessed validated tool used to measure the extent (area) and 
severity of AD [Hanifin 2001 Exp Dermatol].  A copy of the EASI is included in Section  17.2 
(Appendix  2). This assessment will be completed using an internet -enabled device.  
The Investigator will assess the severity of 4 disease characteristics (erythema [E], 
induration/papulation [I ], excoriation (X) and lichenification [L]) in 4 body regions on a scale 
of zero (absent) to 3 (severe).  In addition, the extent of involvement of 4 body regions 
(head/neck, trunk, upper extremities and lower extremities) will be assessed.  The possible 
highest score for extent of involvement in each region is 100%.  For each region, the percentage 
of BSA will be converted to an area score of zero (none in that region) to 6 (>90% to 100% of 
the entire region affected).  
For each major region of the body (he ad, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities), EASI 
score = (E  + I + X + L) × Area Score.  The total EASI score is the weighted total of the region 
EASI using the weights 10% (head), 20% (upper extremities), 30% (trunk) and 40% (lower 
extremities).  The minimum possible EASI score is 0 and the maximum possible EASI score 
is 72, where a higher score indicates increased extent and severity of AD.  
6.3.2 Investigator Global Assessment   
The IGA is an Investigator --lead assessment scale used to determine severity of AD and clinical 
response to treatment.  It is based on a 5 -point scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe).  A 
copy of the IGA is also included in Section 17.3 (Appendix 3 ).  
This assessment will be completed using an internet -enabled device.  
6.3.3 SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis Index   
The SCORAD Index is a validated clinical tool that was developed to standardise the 
evaluation of the extent and severity of AD [SCORAD Dermatol Basel Switz 1993].  A copy 
of the SCORAD Index is included in Section  17.4 (Appendix 4 ). This assessment will be 
completed using an internet -enabled device.  
To determine the extent of AD, the affected area (A) as a percentag e of the whole body is 
determined, with a maximum score of 100% (head and neck [9%], upper limbs [9% each], 
lower limbs [18% each], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], genitals [1%]).  The severity (B) 
of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/ crusting, scratch marks, skin 
thickening [lichenification], dryness [area where there is no inflammation]) is assessed on a 
4-point scale, with a maximum score of 18: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3).  
Subjective symptoms (ie, itch and sleepl essness; C) are recorded as scored by [CONTACT_155122] a visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and [ADDRESS_179482] imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20.

 The SCORAD score  for each pat ient is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C.  
6.3.4 Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis   
Body surface area (BSA) affected by [CONTACT_12907] (the 
possible highest score for each region is: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back 
[18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], and genitals [1%]) and will be reported as a 
percentage of all major body sections combined.  
6.3.5 Patient Oriented Eczema  Measure   
The POEM is a tool used for monitoring atopic eczema severity.  It focuses on the illness as 
experienced by [CONTACT_102].  This will be completed using an internet -enable d device.  A copy 
of the POEM form is included in Section  17.5 (Appendix 5 ).  The questionnaire consists of 
7 questions pertaining to the symptoms of  AD and their frequency.  Scores are based on a scale 
of zero (no days) to 4 (every day in the last week) for each question, with a maximum score of 
28 possible for all questions.  A POEM total score is correlated to eczema severity (0 -2 [clear 
or almost c lear], 3 -7 [mild], 8 -16 [moderate], 17 -24 [severe], 25 -28 [very severe]).  
6.3.6 Dermatology Life Quality Index   
The DLQI is a dermatology -specific QoL instrument and is a simple, valida ted questionnaire.  
A copy of the DLQI is included in Section 17.6 (Appendix 6 ). This will be completed using an 
internet -enabled device.  
The instru ment consists of [ADDRESS_179483] of AD on QoL.  Scores are 
based on a scale of “0” (not at all/not relevant/question unanswered) to “3” (very 
much/prevented work or studying), with a maximum score of [ADDRESS_179484] of AD on QoL (0 -1 [no effect at all on patient’s 
life], 2 -5 [small effect], 6 -10 [moderate effect], 11 -20 [very large effect] and 21 -30 [extremely 
large effect]).  
6.3.[ADDRESS_179485] is a validated 6 -item instrument with a 7 -day recall period to measure AD disease 
control (Section 17.7 [Appendix 7]).  This will be completed using an internet enabled device. 
The following domains are assessed: overall severity of symptoms, frequency of intense 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_81221], severity of  bother of itching, frequency of sleep impact, severity of daily 
activities impact, severity of mood or emotions impact.   Each item is scored from 0 (none) to 
4 (extreme).  A total score of 7 or more points (derived by [CONTACT_155123]) was identified 
during validation as an optimum threshold to identify patients whose AD is “not in control”.

 6.3.9 Numerical Rating Scale for Pruritus   
The NRS  for pruritus is an assessment tool that will be used to assess the patient’s worst itch 
as a result of their AD in the previous 24 hours.  This will be recorded daily, ideally in the 
morning, using an internet -enabled device with patients asked, “On a sca le of “0” (no itch) to 
“10” (worst imaginable itch), how was your worst itch in the past 24 hours?” according to 
Section  17.9 (Appendix  9).  Patients will additionally be asked to record NRS for [ADDRESS_179487].  All assessments will be performed at the timepoints 
outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (see Table  6-1, Table  6-2, Table  6-3 and Table  6-4).   
6.4.1 Physical Examination   
The Investigator will perform physical examinations throughout the study, consisting of 
assessment of general appearance, ears, eyes, nose, throat, mouth, neck, thyroid, skin, 
cardiovascular, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], abdomen, neurological, musculoskeletal, lymph node s and 
extremities.  
6.4.2 Body Weight and Height   
Body weight will be measured in kilograms (kg) and height in metres (m), with patients in light 
clothing and without shoes.   Body weight  will be assessed at Screening and during study 
treatment; height will be measured at Screening only.  
Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated as follows:   
BMI = Weight (kg) / Height (m)[ADDRESS_179488] be made of the seriousne ss, 
severity and relationship to the administration of study treatment (causality).  Serious adverse 
events and specific AESI will require expedited reporting to the Sponsor.  For details on 
definitions and reporting procedures see Section  8.1.  
Adverse event assessments must be made by [CONTACT_155124].  The Investigator is required to record the assessments in 
the eCRF and patient’s medical notes.  Any AEs already recorded and designated as 
“continuing” should be reviewed at each subsequent assessment.  
During and following a patient’s participation in this study, the Investigator must e nsure that 
adequate medical care is provided to a patient for any AEs, including clinically significant 
laboratory values, related to the trial.

Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE in former study patients.  However, 
if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient’s last visit 
and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study 
participation, the Sponsor should be notified.

performed pre -injection on IMP administration days, and at  the early termination visit, 
Days  393 (Week 56), 449 (Week 64), and 477 (Week 68) of the safety follow -up period. These 
will be performed locally . If a urine pregnancy test result is positive, it must be confirmed by 
a serum pregnancy test.  
For post -menop ausal women only, a blood sample will also be taken at Screening for FSH.  
Screening laboratory assessments may be repeated a maximum of once where initial results are 
in the Investigator’s opi[INVESTIGATOR_1649], clinically significant and only provided the initial resul t is 
considered a temporary anomaly and there is a documented explanation as to the likely cause 
of the result (Section 4.6).  
All laboratory reports should be reviewed, signed, and dated by a designated physician within 
24 hours of receipt.  These will be checked and verified by [CONTACT_155125].

6.4.6 Drugs of Abuse Testing   
History (within last 2 years) of current prescription drug or sub stance abuse, including alcohol, 
considered significant by [CONTACT_155127] (see 
Section  4.3).  Drug abuse is  a patterned use of a substance in which the patient uses amounts 
or methods that are harmful to themselves or others during the study period.  If the medical 
history suggests such abuse, then the Investigator should consider whether the patient meets 
the exclusion criteria.  Drugs of abuse screening, including breath test, may be performed at 
the Investigator’s discretion.   
6.4.7 Vital Signs   
Vital signs will be assessed throughout the  study. On IMP administration Days 1 (Week 0), 
29 (Week 4), 57 (Week 8), 85 (Week 12), and 113 (Week 16), vital signs will be measured 
pre-injection and at [ADDRESS_179492] -injection.  
Evaluations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and tympanic  temperature will 
be performed (other methods may be used but they must be consistently used throughout the 
study for each individual patient).  Heart rate and blood pressure will be taken after 5  minutes 
in the supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
Any changes from Baseline in blood pressure and heart rate findings judged to be clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_155128]. In such cases, vital signs will be 
repeated at appropriate intervals until they return to Baseline or to a level deemed acceptable 
by [CONTACT_155129].  
Vital signs may be repeated a maximum of once where initial results are outside of the limits 
defined in the inclusion/exclusion criteria and only provided the initial  result is considered a 
temporary anomaly and there is a documented explanation as to the likely cause of the result .

6.5 Pharmacokinetic and Anti -drug Antibodies Assessments   
6.5.1 Pharmacokinetic Procedures   
Blood samples will be withdrawn periodically for KY1005 assay.   Pharmacokinetic and ADA 
samples will be collected from all patients including those rec eiving Placebo.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic Sampling Schedule   
Serum concentrations of KY1005 will be assessed from blood samples taken during the study 
using validated enzyme -linked immunoso rbent assay (ELISA) bioanalytical methods.  Assay 
methodologies and procedures will be described in analytical plans to be finalised before the 
start of sample analysis.  
Samples will be collected at the timepoints specified in  the Schedule of Assessments (see 
Table  6-1, Table  6-2 and Table  6-3). On IMP administration days, samples for serum 
concentration of KY1005 will be withdrawn pre -dose.  
Tolerances for deviation from the nominal time of sampling are provided in the schedule of 
assessments (visit window) .  These tolerances indicate the best time to allow interpretation of 
data. However, samples taken outside these tolerances will be evaluated so should be taken.  
The exact date and  time of sampling will be recorded.  Samples may also be drawn for serum 
concentration, with prior agreement with the Medical Monitor, at unscheduled times.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic Sample Preparation and Shipment   
The details of blood volume, type of tube, sample handling, storage and dispatch are described 
in the Laboratory Manual.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacokinetic Parameter Derivation   
The following PK values will be derived for each patient receiving KY1005 and all KY1005 
regimens:  
• Cmax following the first, or any doses where sampling permits.  Peak concentrations 
following any doses where sampling permits.

6.5.2 Anti -drug Antibody Procedures   
Blood samples will b e withdrawn periodically for anti -KY1005 antibody assays.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Anti -drug Antibody Sampling Schedule   
Serum titres of anti -KY1005 antibodies will be assessed in blood samples taken during the 
study using a validated bioanalytical method.  Characterisation of positive ADA samples, eg, 
KY1005 neutralising capacity, may be performed if required.  
Samples will be collected at the timepoints specified in  the Schedule of Assessments (see 
Table  6-1, Table  6-2, Table  6-3 and Table  6-4) and will be withdrawn before injection of IMP.  
Tolerances for deviation from the nominal time of sampling are provided in the schedule of 
assessments (visit window) .  These tolerances indicate the best time to allow interpretation of 
data.  However, samples taken outside these tolerances will be evaluated and should therefore 
be collected.  The exact date and time of sampling will be recorded on the eCRF.

8 SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING   
8.1 Definition of an Adverse Event   
The ICH E6(R2) Good Clinical Practice Guideline defines an AE as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a patient or clinical  investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product, 
which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can, 
therefore, be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symp tom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
An AE can include an undesirable medical condition occurring at any time, even if no 
investigational medicinal product has been administered.  This includes an exacerbation of 
pre-existing conditions or events, intercurrent illnesses, drug interaction, or the significant 
worsening of the indication under investigation that is not recorded e lsewhere on the eCRF 
under specific efficacy assessments.  Anticipated fluctuations of pre -existing conditions, 
including the disease under study, that do not represent a clinically significant exacerbation or 
worsening are not considered AEs and will not be captured as AEs.  Lack of efficacy or failure 
of expected pharmaceutical action per se will not be reported as an AE or a SAE.  Such 
instances will be captured under the efficacy assessments.  However, the signs symptoms and 
clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE/SAE if they fulfil 
the definition of an AE or SAE.  
This definition includes events occurring from the time of the patient giving informed consent 
until the [ADDRESS_179496] be made of the seriousness, 
severity and relationship to the administration of study treatment (causality). These 
assessments must be made by [CONTACT_155132].  The Investiga tor must promptly record all identified AEs in the eCRF 
and patient medical notes.  
The Investigator should report a diagnosis or a syndrome rather than individual signs or 
symptoms, wherever possible. The Investigator should also try to separate a primary AE 
considered as the foremost untoward medical occurrence from secondary AEs which occurred 
as complications.

Property of the [COMPANY_011] Group - strictly confidential   PAGE 94 OF 147 
 During and following a patient’s participation in this study, the Investigator must ensure that 
adequate medical care is provided to a patient for  any AEs, including clinically significant 
laboratory values, related to the trial.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Severity of Adverse Events   
Adverse events will be classified by [CONTACT_25311]:  
• Mild (Grade 1 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]): 
Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention 
not indicated.  
• Moderate (Grade 2 CTCAE): Minimal, local or noninvasive inte rvention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Instrumental 
ADL refers to preparing meals, shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_3112], using the telephone, 
managing money, etc.  
• Severe (≥ Grade 3 CTCAE): Severe or medical ly significant but not immediately 
life-threatening; hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3111]; disabling, 
limiting self care ADL. Self care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding self, using the toilet, taking medicatio ns, and not bedridden. Life -threatening 
consequences; urgent intervention indicated; Death related to AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration 
of the event at each level of severity to be performed.  Adverse events characterised as 
intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Causality of Adverse Events   
The relationship of an AE to IMP administrat ion will be classified by [CONTACT_155133]:  
• Related: The temporal relationship of the AE to IMP administration makes a causal 
relationship possible, and other medications, therapeutic interventions, or underlying 
conditions do no t provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
• Not related: The temporal relationship of the AE to IMP administration makes a causal 
relationship unlikely or remote, and other medications, therapeutic interventions, or 
underlying conditions pro vide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
As this is a double -blind study, the causality assessment should be made under the assumption 
that the patient is receiving active study treatment.  If considering unblinding, this assessment 
should be made prior to unblinding to avoid bias.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Follow -up of Adverse Events   
During the study, all AEs will be proactively followed up for each patient.  Every effort should 
be made to ob tain a resolution for all events, even if the events continue after the patient 
discontinued the study.  
Any AEs already recorded and designated as “continuing” should be reviewed at each 
subsequent assessment for their final outcome.

Version number: [ADDRESS_179497] pursue and obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome 
of the AE and to assess whether it meets criteria for classification as a SAE requiring immediate 
notification to the Sponsor (or designee).  
A SAE is any AE that:  
• Results in death.  
• Is life -threatening (ie, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the patient is at immediate 
risk of death from the AE).  
• Results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_15574]

hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155051]).  
• Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155052] a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_155053].  Examples include:  
o Social admission (eg, patient has no place to sleep);  
o Protocol -specified admission during a clinical study (eg, for a procedure 
required by [CONTACT_155134]);  
o Optional admission not associated with a precipi[INVESTIGATOR_155054] (eg, for elective 
cosmetic surgery);  
o Surgery that was planned prior to study enrolment (appropriate documentation 
is required for these cases) and was not caused by [CONTACT_155135] a pre -existi ng 
condition.  
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, where disability is a 
substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a patient who re ceived 
the IMP.  
• Constitutes an important medical event that may not result in death, be 
life-threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155055], based upon appropriate medical 
judgement, may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical 
intervention  to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_155056], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
The Investigator must report all SAEs, regardless of treatment group or suspected relationship 
to investigational medicinal product, to the Sponsor or designee within 24  hours  of knowledge 
of the event.

The procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in  Section  17.11  
(Appendix  11). 
8.1.[ADDRESS_179499], defined below, will be reported to Sponsor or designee 
within 24  hours of learning of the event:  
• Systemic or localised allergic reactions that require immediate treatment*.  
• Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24  hours.  
• Any severe or opportunistic viral, bacterial or fungal infection and/or any uncommon, 
unanticipated or persistent infection (viral, parasitic, bac terial, or fungal).  
• Any malignancy.  
• Increase in alanine transaminase (ALT) >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN); see the 
“Increase in ALT” flow chart in Section 17.12  (Appendix 12).  
The special situations of:  
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or non -serious) with IMP (any administration that is 
twice or more than the intended dose administered in less than 3 weeks [21 days]).  
• Pregnancy - discussed separately i n Section 8.3. 
* In the event that a patient  has a systemic allergic reaction that requires immediate treatment,

8.1.6 Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs   
Prompt notification by [CONTACT_155136] l so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of patients  and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
Sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting 
to the regulatory authority, IRB/ IEC, and Investigators.  
Serious adverse events that are considered expected will be specified in the reference safety 
information (specify IB or label), as applicable.  
Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(S[LOCATION_003]Rs) accordin g to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to 
Investigators as necessary.  
An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE, S[LOCATION_003]R or any 
other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs)  from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according 
to local requirements.  It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to assess whether an event meets 
the criteria for a S[LOCATION_003]R, and therefore, is expedited to regulatory authorities.  
8.1.7 Reporting to Regulatory Authorities, IECs/IRBs and other Investigators

If the Investigator needs urgent advic e regarding the management of an SAE or any other safety 
issue, an ‘on call’ contracted medical advisor is available [ADDRESS_179502] for medical monitor is specified in the STUDY PERSONNEL  section.  
8.2.1 Emergency Treatment Code -break   
The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaki ng instructions. In case of an emergency, the 
Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a participant’s 
intervention assignment is warranted (eg, in case of available antidote). Participant safety must 
always be the first co nsideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides 
that unblinding is warranted, he/she may, at his/her discretion, contact [CONTACT_155138] a participant’s intervention assignment unless this co uld delay 
emergency treatment of the participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded, 
the Sponsor must be notified within [ADDRESS_179503] be recorded in the source d ocumentation and case report form, as 
applicable. If the code is broken upon Investigator’s request, the participant must withdraw

9 WITHDRAWAL OF PATIEN TS FROM TREATMENT 
AND/OR THE STUDY   
Patients are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time, without prejudice to 
their further care.  In some circumstances, patients may be discontinued from study treatment 
but con tinue certain study assessments .  
The Investigator should discontinue study treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she 
believes that continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s well -being.  
Study treatment w ill be discontinued and/or patients may be withdrawn from the study under 
the following circumstances:  
1. Withdrawal of consent.  
2. Severe noncompliance with the protocol as judged by [CONTACT_11219]/or the Sponsor.  
3. Patients incorrectly initiated on study treatment (eg, patient has been determined to have 
met one or more of the exclusion criteria for study participation at study entry and 
continuing study treatment might constitute a safety risk).  
4. AEs that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_155057], contraindicate further 
dosing.   
5. Pregnancy.  
6. Disease progression in the investigator's point of view.  
7. Study terminated by [CONTACT_1034]. This includes any decision on study termination after 
IDMC recommendation. The IDMC reviews and evaluates accumul ating blinded and 
unblinded if deemed necessary safety and efficacy data (including by [CONTACT_155140]) to ensure the safety of trial subjects (please refer to Section 3.8 of the protocol).  
8. Lost to follow -up.  
9.[ADDRESS_179508]   
The IMP will be permanently discontinued for any of the following reasons:

7. Severe laboratory abnormalities:  
• Absolute neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 109/L; 
• Platelet count ≤50 × 109/L; 
• Serum ALT >[ADDRESS_179510] and Total Bilirubin >[ADDRESS_179511];  
• Serum ALT >[ADDRESS_179512] if baseline ALT ≤[ADDRESS_179513] or ALT >[ADDRESS_179514] if baseline 
ALT  >[ADDRESS_179515].  
Note: If the laboratory abnormality is considered causally related to the IMP, the IMP will 
be permanently discontinued.  In cases where a causal relationship to the IMP can be 
reasonably excluded (ie, an alternative cause is evident), the IMP will be disc ontinued but 
it may be resumed when the laboratory abnormality is sufficiently normalised.  
8.  If a subject experiences an adverse event assessed as ≥ Grade 3 CTCAE [severe; see 
Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ] (or ≥ Grade 2 CTCAE [mo derate; see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ] for the System 
Organ Classes of Cardiac disorders and Blood and Lymphatic disorders) per CTCAE v5.0, 
the subject should be discontinued from further dosing. Such subjects should not be 
discontinued from the study, but they should be monitored by [CONTACT_155141] (AE) resolves or stabilizes.  
Other reasons that may lead to the permanent discontinuation of IMP include:  
• Treatment with an y prohibited systemic concomitant medication or procedure (see 
Section  5.3.2  and Section 5.3.4 ). 
• Treatment with any topi[INVESTIGATOR_155058] 14 days from 
Baseline (see Section 5.3.4 ).  
• After Day 14, treatment with topi[INVESTIGATOR_155059] 
[ADDRESS_179516]   
Dosing of IMP should be temporarily interrupted for the following reasons:  
1. Clinically important laboratory abnormalities, such as:  
• Absolute neutrophil count ≤1.0 × 109/L but >0.5 × 109/L; 
• Platelet count ≤100 × 109/L but >50 × 109/L; 
• Creatine phosphokinase >10 × ULN.  
2. Other intercurrent illness.  
3. An infection requiring systemic treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic 
or antiprotozoal agents, or requiring oral treatment with such agents for more than 2 weeks.

 [IP_ADDRESS]  Re-challenge   
Reinitiation of intervention with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical 
and/or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her 
best med ical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned 
adverse event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to 
Section  4). 
If there is to be a delay to any dosing of IMP outside of the permitted visit windows as per the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Section 6.1), the Investigator must consult with, and receive written 
confirmation that dosing can be rescheduled from, the Medical Monitor.  
[IP_ADDRESS].1  Study intervention restart or rechallenge after liver stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_155060].  
9.1.3 Follow -up of Patients Off Treatment   
If a patient discontinues study treatment prematurely, she/he will be encouraged to remain in 
the study to complete all remaining study visits and to participate in all assessments  according 
to the Schedule of Assessments.  Their study data collected during their continued involvement 
is important to the study efficacy analysis and study value.  
If a patient permanently withdraws from study treatment early but consent is retained, s tudy 
assessments may be continued until Day  169 (Week 24) for patients who withdraw from study 
treatment in the first study period (and who are therefore no longer eligible for consideration 
for the LTE at Day 169 (Week 24) or progression to the next study  period), or until Day 365 
(Week 52) in patients who withdraw from study treatment after Day 169 (Week 24) and who 
decide not to participate in or are not eligible for the LTE study.  This may be followed by [CONTACT_155142] -up according to the Schedule o f Assessments ( Section 6.1).   
If a patient chooses not to attend remaining visits in the event of withdrawal from study 
treatment early before Day 169 (Week 24) or Day 365 (Week  52), they will instead enter the 
safety  follow -up and complete their assessments as per the Schedule of Assessments 
(Section  6.1). 
Patients will be considered lost to follow -up only if no contact [CONTACT_155143], such  that there is insufficient information to determine the patient’s 
status at that time.  Patients who refuse to continue participation in the study, including 
telephone contact, should be documented as “withdrawal of consent” rather than “lost to 
follow -up.”  Investigators should document attempts to re -establish contact [CONTACT_155144].  If contact [CONTACT_4490] a missing patient is re -established, the 
patient should not be considered lost to follow -up, and evaluations should resum e according to 
the protocol.  
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study 
visit:  
• The site must attempt to contact [CONTACT_155145].

 • Before a patient is deemed lost to follow -up, the Investigator or designee must make 
every effort to regain contact [CONTACT_72981], for example, repeat 
telephone calls, cert ified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address, or local 
equivalent methods.  These contact [CONTACT_23526]’s 
medical record.  
• Efforts to reach the patient should continue until the end of the study.  Should the 
patien t be unreachable at the end of the study, the patient should be considered to be 
lost to follow -up. 
9.1.4 Discontinuation of the Patient from Study   
Patients are free to withdraw from t he study at any time without prejudice to further treatment.  
Patients who withdraw consent for further participation in the study will not receive any further 
IMP or further study assessments.  
A patient who withdraws consent will always be asked about the  reason(s) for withdrawal and 
the presence of any AEs.  If a patient withdraws consent, they will be specifically asked if they 
are withdrawing consent for: all further participation in the study including any further 
follow -up (eg, telephone calls), and/o r withdrawal of consent for the use of any samples.  
9.2 End of Treatment and End of Study Procedures   
At the EOS Visit (defined in Section  3.4), patients will undergo the procedures specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments.  Following withdrawal for any reason, patients will attend an early 
termination visit and will undergo the pr ocedures specified in the applicable Schedule of 
Assessments ( Table  6-1, Table  6-2, Table  6-3 and Table  6-4), if possible.  All data available 
for the patient at the time of withdrawal and all reasons for withdrawal, must be recorded in 
the eCRF.  
9.3 Study Discontinuation   
The Sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor.  The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of 
the Sponsor, patients are placed at undue risk because of clinicall y significant findings that:  
• Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414].  
• Are assessed as causally related to study treatment.  
• Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study.  
Regardless of the reason for te rmination, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuation of follow -up must be recorded in the eCRF.  All reasons for discontinuation of 
treatment must be documented.  
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consid eration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests.  
Study sites will be closed upon study completion.  A study site is considered closed when all 
required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has 
been p erformed.

and correctly.  
• Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation  
• Intrauterine device (IUD)  
• Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal occlusion  
• Azoospermic partner (vasectomized or due to a medical cause)  
Azoospermia is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of 
the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly 
effective method of contraception s hould be used.  
Note: documentation of azoospermia for a male participant can come from the site personnel’s review of the 
participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
Highly effective methodsb that are user dependent Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and

Sexual abstinence  
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual 
intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual 
abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of 
the participant.

b) Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly.  Typi[INVESTIGATOR_17964].  
 Note: Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), 
spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) are not acceptable methods of contraception for 
this study. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure from friction)

SAE reporting to the Sponsor  via an electronic data collection tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor’s representative will be 
the electronic data collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection to ol (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be 
taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then t he site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next 
section) or to the Sponsor’s representative by [CONTACT_756].  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Site File.  
Serious adverse event reporting to the Sponsor via paper data  collection tool ( In case of 
failure of electronic reporting of SAE via the EDC system ) 
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool is the preferred method 
to transmit this information to the Sponsor’s representative.  
• In rare circumstances  and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
[CONTACT_9337] a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by [CONTACT_19515].  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE data collection tool within the designated reporting time 
frames . 
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Investigator Site File.

Guidance.  
The following contingencies may be implemented for the duration of the emergency (after 
Sponsor agreement is obtained). Contingencies implemented due to emergency will be 
documented.  
Informed consent  
In exceptional circumstances, such as a regional or national emergency declared by a 
governmental agency, consent may be collected through a remote solution if allowed through 
country and site regulations and following approval  by [CONTACT_155177] 
(IEC)/ Institutional Review Boards (IRB). Implementation must have prior approval from the 
Sponsor (or its designee).   Contingency procedures may be implemented for the duration of 
the emergency.   
The patient or their legally authorised representative should be verbally informed prior to 
initiating any changes that are to be implemented for the duration of the emergency (eg, study 
visit delays/treatment extension).  
Study drug administration  
During the initial part of th e study (up to and including Day 57 [Week 8]), study drug must be 
administered in accordance with Section  1.5.4 , Section 1.7 and Section 5.2. At all other times, 
consideration may be given to a dministration of study drug at home if all conditions in the 
Pharmacy manual are adhered to and prior Sponsor agreement is obtained.  
Temporary IMP discontinuation may apply in exceptional cases, under regional or national 
emergencies (eg, natural disaster,  epi[INVESTIGATOR_155076], terrorist attack) due to which a visit at the 
clinical study site is no longer feasible.  
In the case of an exceptional temporary treatment discontinuation, the discontinuation should 
be approved by [CONTACT_1034].  The Sponsor should also  be notified to determine if treatment 
should be resumed. If deemed safe, the treatment can be resumed at the next scheduled or 
unscheduled visit.  During the discontinuation period, remote checks (eg, telephone/video 
calls) will take the place of on -site visits per the Schedule of Assessments (Section 6.1). 
Study assessments and procedures  
Attempts should be made to perform all assessments in accordance with the approved protocol 
to the extent possible.  In case this is not possible due to a temporary disruption caused by a 
government declared regional or national emergency, focus should be given to assessments 
necessary to ensure the safety of  patients and those important to preserving the main scientific 
value of the study.  
Use of local clinic or laboratory locations may be allowed when central labs analyses cannot 
be performed due to a government declared regional or national emergency.  Thes e local 
laboratory results will only be performed to ensure patient safety and will not be used for the 
purpose of statistical analyses.

 If onsite visits are not possible the implementation of remote visits (eg, phone call, virtual 
consultation, televisit,  etc) or home visits (eg, home nurses, etc) may be planned for the 
collection of possible safety and/or efficacy data.  
A Televisit is defined as a videoconference, video call or telephone call .  
The following conditions must be met at a site level before s uch visits can be authorised.  
• The visit must be performed  by [CONTACT_155178] a home 
healthcare service.  
• The correct equipment necessary to perform the required assessments must be taken to 
the visits.  
• Home visits or televisits must be permitted by [CONTACT_779], local regulations, relevant ethics 
committee, relevant regulatory authority.  
• The patient  must have given consent via informed consent.  
• Prior to implementing remote study visits for patients, notification to the Sponsor (or 
its designee) must be provided. The notification should include justification and 
expected patients and visits that may be impacted.  
Visit windows may be extended for assessment of safety and/or efficacy data that cannot be 
obtained remotely.  Possibility  of visit extension and duration of such extension must be 
discussed on a case -by-case basis with the Sponsor considering first of all patients’ safety and 
best interests.  
If the above emergency scenario occurs during the follow -up period, one or more foll ow up 
visits can be performed remotely (eg, via telephone calls or video calls), but at least one 
follow -up visit should be performed on site (EOS visit), even if the visit window needs to be 
extended.  Remote follow -up should be conducted according to loc al regulations and approved 
by [CONTACT_1034].  
If the above emergency scenario leads to site closure or complete regional or national

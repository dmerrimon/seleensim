Statistical methods: For change from baseline in HbA1c up to [ADDRESS_171039] model for repeated measures 
analysis will be used to obtain adjusted means for the treatment effects on the full 
analysis set (FAS). This model w ill include treatment, visit, and the stratification 
factors renal function at baseline, and pretreatment with Metformin at screening as 
discrete fixed effects, baseline HbA1c as a continuous fixed effect, and interaction 
betw een visit and treatment, and an interaction between visit and ba seline HbA1c. The 
primary treatment comparisons will be the contrast between treatments at the endpoint 
visit at [ADDRESS_171040] between treatments at the 12 w eek visit for seated SBP and 24 
week visit for body weight.
The key secondary endpoint chan ge from baseline in 24-hour ambulatory S BP and 
change from mean trough ambulatory SBP at 12 w eeks will be analyzed by [CONTACT_148860] (ANCOVA) approach in the FAS with last observation carried 
forw ard (LOCF
)for missing data. The model will include random ised treatment, renal 
function at baseline, pretreatment with Metformin at screening as discrete fixed 
effects and the baseline of the key secondary endpoint and HbA1c at baseline as 
continuous fixed effect s. 
The overall type I error acros s the hypotheses tests in the confirmatory analysis will 
be maintained at a level of α ≤ 0.05 using a hierarchical testing sequence. 
The sample size of 154 patients per group w as derived (assuming n=64 per groups 
plus a 20% drop -out rate) based on the req uirement that the comparisons of 
empagliflozin versus placebo with respect to the HbA1c , BP and body weight should 
have a pow er of at least 80% at the two -sided αlevel of 5%. 
Explorative statistical models and descriptive statistics will be used for the other 
secondary endpoints and safety parameters.

A The screening procedures can be done on different days within the time window.
B Patients will undergo [ADDRESS_171041], this procedure should be repeated.  Each 
patient will be allowed a maximum of two attempts within the visit window to obtained one successful 
measurement starting at each of the ABPM time points (Visit 2.2, 5.1 and 7.1) .  If the ABPM testing is successful, 
procedures for the subsequent visit c an be conducted on the same day after the ABPM device is removed and 
trough seated blood pressure measurement is taken.  
Visit 2.2 ABPM and any repeat measurements if required should be performed during the run -in period within 7 
days prior to Visit 3 (Day 1).   Day 1 is the day of randomisation , not the day ABPM is applied. 
Visit 5.1 ABPM and any repeat measurements if required should be performed within 7 days prior to Visit 5 .2 
(Day 85). 
Visit 7.1 ABPM and any repeat measurements if required should be performed within 7 days prior to Visit 7.2 
(Day 169). dx
  
C Diligent diet and exercise counselling by a diet specialist or trained staff member at visit 2.1. Counselling is b ased 
on local diet recommendations and should include a food log (recording of food intake for 3 consecutive days in 
the week before the actual visit). At all visits, patients should be reminded about the importance to follow the 
recommended diet and exerc ise plan.
D In addition to the visit indicated, ECG should be recorded in case of respective cardiac symptoms (indicating 
rhythm disorders or cardiac ischemia ).

Empagliflozin is an orally available inhibitor of the sodium -glucose co- transporter 2 (SGLT -
2), that promotes enhanced glucose excretion in the urine, thereby  [CONTACT_148861] 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
T2DM accounts for 90 to 95% of all cases of diabet es and is an increasingly  prevalent disease 
with an estimated [ADDRESS_171052] frequent cause of adult -onset loss of vision, 
renal failure, and amputation in the industrialized world. Diabetes is also associated with 
macrovascular complications with a 2- to 5-fold increase in cardiovascular disease risk. The 
high frequency of complications leads to a significant reduction of life expectancy . 
SGL T-2 is a member of a larger group of sodium substrate co -transporters, the sodium -
glucose co- transport 5 (SLC5) gene family  (R05-0939 ).  Under normogl ycaemia, glucose is 
almost completely  reabsorbed by  [CONTACT_23264] , whereas the reuptake capacit y of the

mmol/L , resulting in increasing glucosuria t ypi[INVESTIGATOR_148812]. 
The capacit y to reabsorb glucose can be decreased by [CONTACT_148862]- 2. In humans, 
empagliflozin highly  and selectivel y block glucose transport via SGLT -2 (IC 501.3 nmol/l), 
with a 5000
-fold selectivity  over SGLT -1 (IC 506278 nM).
The efficacy  of empagliflozin is similar to the curr ent oral antidiabetic drugs.  I t has the 
potential to be combined with other oral antidiabetic drugs and has shown additional efficacy  
in terms of glucose control when used in combination with ins ulin in diabetic patients. 
Hypertension is four times more common in black/African Americans than in Caucasians.  
One of the risk factors for hy pertension is sodium sensitivity  and approximately  one third of 
the essential h ypertensive population is respon sive to sodium intake. There is a higher 
association of h ypertension with sodium sensitivity in black/African American patients with 
T2DM. This study  will investigate the potential of empagliflozin to reduce sodium as well as 
glucose reabsorption by  [CONTACT_148863]2 co -transporters and the possibility  of adjustment 
to sodium sensing in the distal segment of the nephron that may  affect renin secretion.

Empagliflozin is not known to be carcinogenic.   
Clinical pharmacokinetics
In humans, empagliflozin predominant ly shows linear pharmacokinetics. Empagliflozin
reaches peak levels at approximately  1.5 hr and shows a biphasic decline with the terminal
elimination half -life of 12.4 h. Following oral administration of [14C] -empagliflozin, 
approximately  41.2% and 54.4% of drug -related radioactivity  was excreted in feces and 
urine, respectivel y. None of the detected metabolites were major. Empagliflozin tablets can 
be administered with or without food. Empagliflozin exposure increases 
with hepatic and 
renal impairment; ho wever, no dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal and 
hepatic impairment as the observed changes in empagliflozin exposure were not clinicall y 
meaningful. No clinically  relevant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed with

and oral contraceptives (Microgy non®).
Clinical efficacy  and safety
In clinical stud ies of over [ADDRESS_171056] shown that treatment 
with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg once dail y for up to 24 weeks results in a reduction of 
glycated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) up to 0.85%, bod y weight up to 2.2 kg and systolic blood

blind, controlled independent extensions of the 4 pi[INVESTIGATOR_22735] t rials (at least 76 weeks), which 
conducted under a single trial number (1245.31) with one trial protocol and one trial report 
(1245.31). In these trials, patients continued on the randomised trial treatment and the 
background medication they had taken in t he initial trials. Sustained empagliflozin efficacy  
compared with placebo was demonstrated for gl ycaemic control (HbA1c, fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG)), bod y weight reductions, and lowering of blood pressure. In a head to head 
comparison with glimepride, af ter 104 week empagliflozin showed greater HbA1c, weight,

In addition, empagliflozin 25 mg resulted in a clinically  meaningful and significant reduction 
in HbA1c in patients with moderate renal impairment. The frequency  of overall adverse 
events ( AE)s, AEs leading to discontinuation and serious adverse e vents ( SAE )s were 
comparable to placebo. There was no significant increase in frequency  of hypogly cemia with 
empagliflozin compared to placebo except when used in combination with a sulphony lurea or 
basal insulin. I n general there was no increase in freque ncy of urinary  tract infection 
compared with placebo, in female patients there was an increase in urinary  tract infection 
(UTI)frequency  with empagliflozin compared to placebo. No changes in electroly tes were 
observed with empagliflozin. There was a reduc tion in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR )which 
graduall y returned toward baseline values over the treatment period in the trials. Furthermore, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR )returned to baseline when empagliflozin was 
discontinued.

ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONAL EFOR PERFORMING THE T RIAL
This trial is designed to investig ate the efficacy  and safet y of empagliflozin compared with 
placebo in hy pertensive black/ African Americans with T2DM .  Since hy pergl ycemia and 
hypertension are key  risk factors for both micro- and macrovascular complications, 
assessment of both glucose and blood pressure lowering effects of empagliflozin in 
hypertensive black/ African American patients with T2DM could provide clinically  relevant 
information for the use of empagliflozin. 
The treatment duration of this trial (24 weeks) will enable assessment of the clinically  
relevant endpoint of a decrease in HbA1c ,a well -accepted measurement of chronic 
glycaemic control , and change in bod y weight at week [ADDRESS_171059] the key  secondary  endpoints 
of decrease sin systolic BP ( SBP)should be observable b y 12 weeks
. 
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The objective of the current study  is to investigate the efficacy  and safety  of empagliflozin
(10 mg or25 mg) compared to placebo on glucose control over 24 weeks in hy pertensive 
black/ African American patients with T2DM .A seco nd objective of the study  is to 
investigate the efficacy  and safet y of empagliflozin (10 mg or 25 mg) compared to placebo 
on weight at 24 weeks and on BP12 and 24 weeks in the same patient population. The study  
is designed to show superiority  of empaglifl ozin over placebo.

BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Both empagliflozin 10 mg and 25 mg con sistently demonstrate sustained clinically
meaningful and statistically  significant efficacy  in patients with T2D Mand eGFR ≥ 45 
mL/min/1.73m2. Since empagliflozin [ADDRESS_171060] been observed 
in a phase III placebo controlled study
 in 825 patients with T2DM and hy pertension 
(1245.48).  In this study , BP was monitored using ABPM devices and empagliflozin 10 and 
25 mg was found to significantly reduce hourl y mean SBP and DBP including day time and 
night time SB P and DBP after 12 -weeks of treatment.    Of the patient on 10 mg or 25 mg 
empagliflozin, 4% and 12% respectively  had clinically  significant reductions in body  weight

this trial may  derive a direct benefit from being treated with an additional active compound 
and not a placebo. The patients will receive empagliflozin at doses which have demonstrated 
favorable HbA1c , glucose and BP changes multiple phase II and phase III studies [
c01678844] . Patients in the placebo group ( 50.0
%) have a higher probability  of not getting an 
additional treatment benefit, i.e. no reduction in FPG or HbA1c values or no reduction in BP 
due to the absence of an additional treatment. However, the placebo arm is required for this 
study  and is accepta ble up to [ADDRESS_171061] 4 weeks before 
randomisation and appropriate criteria for rescue therap y(Section 4.2.1) or patient 
discontinuation (Section 3.3.4) will ensure an adequate treatment in case of an y clinical 
concern.
Because of the mechanism of action of empagliflozin , the risk of hy pogly cemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_148815].   The incidence of hy pogly cemia was slightly higher for empagliflozin treated patients 
compared with placebo in patients treated on backgrounds of sulfony lurea (SU )or insulin. 
However, the observed difference was not due severe h ypogl ycemia.  Symptoms attributed to 
hypo-or hypergl ycemia , as well as hy po-or hypertension will be closely  monitored in the 
trial.
Special attention will be paid to monitor for diabetic ketoa cidosis (DKA). A potential risk for 
DKA ha s been reported by  [CONTACT_148865] (FDA )in patients treated with 
SGL T2 inhibitors, including empagliflozin. In a number of reported cases, the presentation of 
the condition was at ypi[INVESTIGATOR_148816] y increased blood glucose values, below 14 
mmol/L (250 mg/dl).
The risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non-
specific s ymptoms such as nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty  breathing, confusion, unusual 
fatigue or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. In addition it needs to be taken into account that, due to the insulin 
independent mode of action, there is a possibility  that ketoacidosis in patients treated with 
SGL T2 inhibitors is not accompanied b y typi[INVESTIGATOR_148817].
Patients who may  be at higher risk of DKA while taking SGLT2 inhibitors include patients 
on a very  low carboh ydrate diet (as the combination may  further increase ketone body  
production), severel y dehydrated patients, and patients with a history  of ketoacidosis or who 
are known to have a low beta -cell function reserve.
As with all drugs, the potential for hypersensitivity and allergic reactions must be taken into 
consideration when empagliflozin is administered. Other risks to the patie nts are the risks 
inherent to an y clinical trial such as unexpected adverse clinical or laboratory events.
Although rare, a potential for drug -induced liver injury  (DILI) is under constant surveillance 
by [CONTACT_23274]. Therefore, this study  requ ires timely  detection, evaluation, and 
follow -up of laboratory  alterations of selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure patients 
safet y.

(refer to 
Section 4.2.1) , will receive rescue therapy  to ensure their safet y or will be excluded 
from further stud y participation if no fu rther benefit from the rescue medication  can be 
achieved (refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS]).  Special measurements are performed like follow-up on 
urinary  tract infections (urine culture), in order to evaluate if possible side effec ts observed 
for other SLGT -[ADDRESS_171062] that empagliflozin
would address the significant unmet medical need in hypertensive patients with T2DM . 
Given t he good safety  profile in the toxicity  studies of empagliflozin and the good safet y and 
tolerability  seen in over [ZIP_CODE] pati ents with T2DM, the careful monitoring during the stud y 
visits and the blood glucose monitoring performed by  [CONTACT_148868], t he sponsor feels 
the risks to the participating patients are minimized and justified when compared with the 
potential benefits that a successful clinical development of empagliflozin could provide for

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This randomised, double- blind, multi -national, and 2parallel groups stud y compares 10mg 
or 25 mg doses of empagliflozin to placebo in hypertensive black/African American patients 
with T2DM . 
In total, approximately  154 hypertensive black/ African American patients with T2DM who 
meet the entry  criteria are planned for inclusion in this trial. 
Patients are considered included in the study  once they have signed the informed consent .All 
patients suit able after screening undergo a 2 -week placebo run -in period before 
randomisation . Patients who successfully complete this period and who still meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomised to the 24- week randomised period of the 
study  in which t hey will receive 10mg empagliflozin or matching placebo ( Figure 3.1:1 ).  
AtWeek 4 /Visit 4, patients will be dose escalated to 25mg empagliflozin or matching 
placebo. 
Current antihypertensive and antidiabetic therap yshoul d be administered during the entire 
trial duration (including placebo run -in and follow -up period) in an unchanged dosage.
The patient ’sparticipation is concluded when they have undergone the last planned visit 
(Visit 8).
For information regarding Adverse event and serious adverse event reporting, please refer to 
Section [IP_ADDRESS].
The end of the trial is defined as “last patient out”, i.e. last visit completed by  [CONTACT_148869].

3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP
Empagliflozin used at both 10 mg and 25 mg dose has been shown to reduce seated SBP in 
patients with T2DM (1245.20) and to reduced hourly  mean SBP and DBP (ABPM) including 
daytime and night time SBP and DBP in patients with T2DM and hy pertension (1245.48) [
c01678844]
.  Sub group a nalysis of the data from the 1245.48 study  show clinically  
meaningful changes in HbA1c after 12 weeks of treatment with both doses of empagliflozin 
in the black/African American subgroup; the low percentage of black/ African Americans (5% 
of all pati ents) in that study  did not allow for reliable results for SBP and DBP (ABPM) .  For 
this study , patients will enter on the basis of insufficient BP and glycemic control despi[INVESTIGATOR_148820] . 
Metformin therap y represents the drug of choice unless contra indicated in patients newly  
diagnosed with ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus with an HbA1c > 7.0% and should be titrated to a 
maximum tolerated dose which is generally  greater than 1500 mg/day . Therefore, patients 
with current metformin treatment represent an impor tant proportion of patient population 
with ty pe 2 diabetes mellitus.
Sulfon ylureas (SU) and Dipeptidy l peptidase
-4 (DPP- 4)inhibitors can be used as 
monotherap y but are frequently  added to metformin when patients are not at goal with 
metformin. Sulfony lureas (eg. Glimiperide, gl yburide, glipi[INVESTIGATOR_7130]) and DPP -4 inhibitors (eg. 
sitagliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin) are important alternative monotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_148821] i s not used and more importantly  when used in combination with metformin.
Therefo re patients with current sulfony lurea or DPP -4 inhibitor treatment represent an 
important proportion of the patient population with ty pe 2 diabetes.

Proprietary confidential information . 
[ADDRESS_171063] shown that treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg or 25 mg for up to 24 -
weeks results in a reduction of HbA1c up to 0.85%, body  weight up to 2.2kg and SBP up to 
4.8mmHg compared to placebo. This was observed with empagliflozin monotherapy , add on 
to metformin, to metformin plus sulfony lurea, to pi[INVESTIGATOR_23213], and 
tobasal insulin with metformin and/or sulfony lurea [c01678844].  Since the observed effect 
on BP is greater with 25 mg compared with 10 mg empagliflozin , the study design will 
include a dose escalation from a starting dose of 10mg to 25 mg empagliflozin 4 w eeks after 
the start of treatment.   The placebo -controlled design is considered ethically  acceptable on 
the basis of appropriate criteria for patient discontinuation, relativel y short study  duration and 
criteria for rescue therapy as defined in the releva nt guidelines (e.g. FDA Guidance for 
Industry  for developi[INVESTIGATOR_148822]) (refer to Section 2.3 ).
This study  will also provide a better understanding of the effect of empagliflozin on the 
circadian patterns of 24 -hour BP co ntrol in hypertensive black/African American patients 
with T2DM . ABPM is considered a gold standard in BP measurement and a better predictor 
of cardiovascular risk than clinic BP ( P13-[ZIP_CODE]). The use of ABPM has been integrated in 
major hy pertension guidelines such as JNC 8 (R14-0310) and European Society  of 
Hypertension /European Society  of Hy pertension (P13-[ZIP_CODE] ) and the American Heart 
Association ( P08-[ZIP_CODE]). While slight differences exist among these guidelines there is 
agreement that ABPM provides a more accurate measurement of BP and correlates with 
hypertension related organ damage more closel y than office BP, provides a more accurate 
evaluation of “white coat” as well as masked h ypertension and a more accurate assessment of 
patients with drug resistance and h ypotensive s ymptoms (P08-[ZIP_CODE], P13 -[ZIP_CODE]).   
The randomised period is planned for [ADDRESS_171064] both changes in HbA1c (primary  
endpoint) and ABPM andbody  weight (key secondary  endpoints). The two- week follow -
up 
period is considered to be sufficient, as previous studies with empagliflozin have shown that 
the pharmacod ynamic effect of empagliflozin only extends to about [ADDRESS_171065] dose.
The r ationale for dose and dose -interval selection is described in Section 4.1.3 .
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL POPULATION
Approximately  700 patients will be screened for the trial in US. About 85 trial centres will be 
participating to en sure that approximately  154 patients are randomised to trial treatment (77 
to each treatment group).   The intention is that at least [ADDRESS_171066] be obtained from the TCM at 
Boehringer Ingelheim.  This will only  be allowed after a careful review of the enrolment 
status.
Screening of patients for this trial is competitive, i.e. screening for the trial will stop at all 
centres when such a number of patients has been screened and it is anticipated that a

[IP_ADDRESS] Removal of individual patients
An individual patient is to be withdrawn from the trial if:
The patient withdraws consent, without the need to justify  the decision.
If a patient becomes pregnant during the trial.  The patient will be followed up until birth 
or otherwise termination of the pregnancy . 
Treatment with study  drugs should be discontinued if:
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational product 
or other stud y medications(s).
The patient is no longer able to participate for other medical reasons (e.g. surgery , AEs, 
or other diseases).
Introduction of rescue therap y due to hypergl ycemia ,high HbA1c or h ypertension as 
described in Section 4.2.1 does not lead to sufficient treatment efficacy  (rescue criteria 
still met). I n this case, the reason for study  drug discontinuation will be classified as “lack 
of efficacy ”. 
Occurrence of hypoglycemia (e.g. repeated h ypoglycaemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) o rDKA that may
put the patient at risk with continued participation .  Patients should be assessed for 
ketoacidosis immediately if sy mptoms occur, regardless of blood glucose level. 
Discontinuation or temporary  interruption of study medication should be considered, until
the situation is clarified.
Patients who discontinue treatment prematurel y will be followed up until the end of the stud y 
(for further details please see Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 ).
A patient can be discontinued after discussion between sponsor and investigator if eligibility  
criteria are being violated, or if the patient fails to comply  with the protocol (e.g. non-
attendance at study  assessments).
Patients who drop out during the screening phase pri or to randomisation (Visit 3) will be 
considered screening failures. They  have to be recorded as screening failure in eCRFs and no 
further follow -up is required.  
Patients who discontinue from treatment or withdraw from the stud y after randomisation 
(Visi t 3) will be considered as “earl
y discontinuations” and the reason for premature 
discontinuation must be recorded in the eCRFs. The data will be included in the trial database

recorded in eCRFs.  
For the anal ysis of this trial it is absolutely  crucial that all planned assessments are done as 
planned, even if patients discontinu e trial treatment.  All patients who discontinue from 
treatment after randomisation (Visit 3 and bey ond) and who do not withdraw consent will be 
followed up for the intended regular treatment period . All assessments related to the primary  
and secondary  endpoints must be performed as if the patient would have remained on 
treatment.  Details of procedures to be followed for patients premature ly terminating the trial
treatment can be found in Section 6.2.3). 
If a patient withdraws consent, participation in the study  will end, the study medication will 
be stopped and the stud y staff will try  to arrange tests for end of treatment procedures and a 
follow -up visit (Visit 8 procedures) with the patient for the patient’s safety
  (For further 
details please see Section 6.2.3 ). All used medication kit boxes and remaining stud y 
medication should be returned. Patients who withdraw consent will not be contact[CONTACT_148873] y

the following reasons:
1.Failure to meet expected enrolment goals overall or at a particular t rial site,
2. E mergence of an y efficacy /safet y information that could significantl y affect continuat ion 
of the trial and/or invalidate the earlier positive benefit-risk- assessment ,
3. V iolation of GCP, the CTP, or the contract b y a trial site or investigator, disturbing the 
appropriate conduct of the trial.
The investigator / the trial site will be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in case of 
trial termination (except in case of the third reason).
3.3.5 Re-screening
Re-screening is permitted for the following categories of screen fail ed patients only:
Patients who were screen failed due to exclusionary  background anti- diabetic 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ( sulfony lurea, DPP4 -inhibitor, metformin + sulfony lurea, metformin

facilitate the use of the IRT sy stem , the Investigator will receive an IRT s ystem manual 
including all necessary  instruction s for using the IRT sy stem .  A cop y of the manual will be 
available in the ISF.      
Patients will be randomly  assigned to empagliflozin 10 mg or placebo in a balanced 1:1 ratio. 
For further details (e.g. stratification) please refer to Section 7.5.    
Patient assignment to the treatment groups will be determined b y a computer generated 
random sequence.  Access to the randomisation code will be controlled and documented –
for further details please refer to Sections [IP_ADDRESS] and [IP_ADDRESS].  
The assigned medication number will be entered in the eCRF, and the corresponding 
medication kit should be given to the patient. Using this procedure, relevant parties will be 
blinde d to the treatment group assignment.  
Kit numbers must be checked carefully  before dispensing to patients. Dispensing the
proper medication kit to a patient is important to avoid unintentional switching of
treatments during a patient’s trial participation . If an error in dispensing kits is
discovered, the site must contact [CONTACT_148875](s) immediately  to have them come
in for a new kit(s). The drug administration pages in remote data capture (RDC )should 
reflect the actual kits taken by  [CONTACT_13935].

Empagliflozin will be administered in a starting dose of 10 mg once daily .  At Visit 4, 
patients will be dose escalated to a dose of 25 mg once dail y.  These doses were selected 
based on the results from previous do se-finding studies (please refer to 
Section 1.2 and to the

After randomisation at Visit 3, patients, investigators and every one involved in analy sing or 
with an interest in this double -blind study  will remain blinded with regard to the randomised 
treatment assignments until after database lock.  Howe ver, due to the requirements to report 
Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs), it may  be necessary  for a 
representative from BI’s pharmacovigilance group to access the randomisation code for 
individual patients during stud y conduct.  In such cases, access to the code will only  be 
permitted by  [CONTACT_148876].  Access to the code will be via an 
IRT system .
The randomisation code will be kept secret by  [CONTACT_148877].  Please refe r to Section [IP_ADDRESS] for the rules regarding breaking the code for an 
individual or for all patients in emergency  situations.     
[IP_ADDRESS] Procedures for emergency  unblinding
In this blinded trial an emergency  
unblinding will be available to the Investigat or via an IRT 
system . Treatment unblinding may onl
y be allowed in emergency  situations when the identity  
of the trial drug must be known to the Investigator in order to provide appropriate medical 
treatment or if required to assure safet y of trial particip ants.  If patient treatment is unblinded , 
the Sponsor must be informed immediately . The reason for treatment unblinding , together 
with the date, must be documented on the appropriate eCRF page.

If the above criteria a re met, the initiation of rescue medication is at the Investigator’s 
discretion, based on the patient
’s current clinical condition (e.g. ongoing illness etc.). The 
choice of rescue medication will depend upon the current medicatio n.  
Adjustment of the 
current therapy  or addition of another antidiabetic and/or antihypertensive medication would 
be appropriate. Rescue medication and its dosage will be left to the discretion of the 
Investigator and the administration of rescue medication is to be conducted acco rding to 
GCP

This document may not -in full or in part -be passed on, reproduced, published or otherwise used without prior written permission.ABPM will be performed in parallel using the ABPM device .  A blood pressure monitoring 
device will be provided for ABPM recordings.
On the mornings when the ABPM device will be applied (Visits 2.2, 5.1 and 7.1), patients 
should arrive at approximately half an hour prior to medicati on intake to allow additional 
time for ABPM procedures, so that dosing of medication occurs as close as possible to patient 
daily  dosing time. It is important that the dosing time for the baseline ABPM (Visit 2.2) is the 
same as the dosing time for the 12 and 24 week ABPM (Visits 5.1 and 7.1). I n addition, for 
collection of Visit 2.2, 5.1 and 7.1 ABPM, the daytime and night time activities of the patient 
during the 24 hours should be similar. For example, if the baseline ABPM falls on a normal 
workday , then the final ABPM 
measurement should be scheduled for a normal workday, not 
a weekend or vacation day.   Measurements of BP using the monitor should be taken from the 
same arm that is used to measure seated BP.
The ABPM device will be programmed to measure bl ood pressure every  20 minutes 
throughout the day  and night to measure BP . Patients should be advised not to move the arm 
during each blood pressure measurement and will also be given instructions concerning 
interruption of measurement in case of malfunction of the device or repositioning of the cuff 
if it slips.
At each ABPM visit (Visits 2.2, 5.1 and 7.1), patients are to come to the clinic fasting and the 
following procedure will be performed .   
TheABPM device will be attached to the patient 
and test rea dings will be taken to check if the device is working properly prior to medication 
intake . 
The first test reading is the Beginning of Test reading. Once it has been confirmed 
that the monitor is properly  functioning, study  medication will be administered.  Record the 
time the medication was administered and the time the monitor was prompted to take the 
Beginning of Test reading.  
The next day  when the patient returns to the clinic, the monitor
will be prompted to take a Conclusion of T est reading.  The dev ice will then be removed and 
the time of the Conclusion of Test will be recorded. This should be done within 23:[ADDRESS_171089] t he 24 -hour mean SBP which is display ed at 
the bottom of the quality  compliance ( QC)results.  The 24-hour mean SBP at this visit 
together with a  successful session determines eligibility  for randomization.   
After the removal of the monitor and p rior to study  medication intake, the patient will be 
allowed rest for 15 minutes and a seated BP measurement (trough BP) will be taken.  The 
patient willthen 
be given study  medication. The time for each of the seated BP 
measurement, medication intake, and the beginning and conclusion of the [ADDRESS_171090] be recorded.  
Further details on the procedure for BP measurement utilizing ABPM device can be found in

5.2.2 Assessment of adverse events
[IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events
Adve rse event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient in a 
clinical investigation who was administered a medicinal product and which does not 
necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Adverse reaction
An ad verse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and 
unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable possibility . Adverse reactions may  arise 
from use of the product within or outside the terms of the marketing authorisation or from 
occupational exposure. Conditions of use outside the marketing authorization include off 
label use, overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.
Serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which results in death, is life -
threatening, results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacit y, requires in patient

defect, or is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event 
when based upon appropriate medical judgement which may  jeopardise the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to p revent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions.
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether other situations 
should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be 
immediate ly life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148829].  
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148830]. Any  suspected transmission via a medicinal product of 
an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might have caused death 
if more severe.
AEs considered “Alway s Serious” 
Cancers of ne w histology and exacerbations of existing cancer must be reported as a serious 
event regardless of the duration between discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the 
cancer.
In accordance with the European Medicines Agency  initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of AEs, which by  [CONTACT_15623], can alway s be 
considered to be “serious” even though they  may  not have met the criteria of an SAE as given 
above.   The latest list of “Alway s Serious AEs” can be found i n the RDC sy stem.  These 
events should alway s be reported as SAEs as described in Section [IP_ADDRESS].
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project lev el as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESI 
need to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance D epartment within the same timeframe 
that applies to SAE , see Section [IP_ADDRESS]. The following events are defined as ‘adverse events of 
special interest (AESI)’:
Hepatic injury  defined by  [CONTACT_148880] 3: 
oan elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥ 3-fold ULN combined with an elevation of 
bilirubin ≥ 2-fold UL N measured in the same blood draw sample. 
oAn isolated elevation of AST and /or ALT ≥ 5fold ULN irrespective of any  
bilirubin elevation

Decreased renal function: creatinine value shows a ≥ 2fold increase from baseline 
and is above the upper limit of normal (ULN)
Metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
In case of metabolic acidosis, ketoacidosis and DKA further investigations should be 
done according to the medical judgment and the clinical course unt il a diagnosis is 
made and/or the patient is recovered.
DKA is defined b y the diagnostic criteria in Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1 below, and as defined b y 
the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (R14-5435 ).
Investigators should note that not all criteria in the table below need to apply  for the 
diagnosis of DKA, and clinical judgment should also be taken into consideration. Due 
to its mechanism of action, empagliflozin may  potentially  modify  the clinical 
presentation of DKA which may  occu r at lower plasma glucose levels than stated in 
Table [IP_ADDRESS]: 1 below (see Section 2.3 for further details).
In case of a suspected DKA the Investigator should ensure that appropriate tests are 
performed locall y at the earliest opportunity  according to local guidelines, such as a 
blood gas test (pH, bicarbonate) and that the patient is appropriatel y treated (i.e.

These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury  alert and the patients showing the above 
alterations in liver parameters or hepatic (S)AEs should be followed up according to Section

In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results 
(ALT, AST, total bilirub in) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of 
hepatic injury  alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed .
For any of these AESI adverse events the central lab will alert the investigator and the 
investigator should report the event to the Pharmacovigilance centre immediately  (within 24 
hours of being informed, and without waiting for confirmation of the results vi a a second 
measurement) being documented on an SAE form, even if they do not meet any  of the 
seriousness criteria –for details please see Section [IP_ADDRESS]

laboratory  test of creatinine according to medical judgement and hepatic enzy mes accordin g 
to Section 10.5.2.
Intensit y of adverse event
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) which is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomfort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of adverse event
The definition of an adverse reaction implies at least a reasonable possibility of a causal
relationship between a suspected medicinal p roduct and an adverse event. An adverse
reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised b y the fact that a causal relationship 
between a medicinal product and an occurrence is suspected.
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relation ship, considering all relevant 
factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history . 
Arguments that may  suggest that ther e is a reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
• The event is consistent with the known pharmacology  of the drug

• A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
• Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re- introduced
• No medically  sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. 
preexisting or concomitant diseases, or co -medications).
• The event is ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_23239] -related and infrequent in the general population not
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens- Johnson sy ndrome).
• An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, 
smaller effect size if dose is diminished).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility  of a causal relationship 
could be:
• No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is 
evident (e.g. pre -treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within day s/ 
weeks of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the 
drug concerned)
• Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_15576], taking into
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged 
despi[INVESTIGATOR_15577].
• Additional arguments amongst those stated before, like alternative explanation (e.g. 
situations where other drugs o r underl ying diseases appear to provide a more likely  
explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
• Disappearance of the event even though the study drug treatment continues or

Pregnancy
Intherare case s, pregnancy  might occur in a study.  Once a subject has been enrolled into the 
clinical trial after having taken trial medication, the investigator must report any potential 
drug exposure during pregnancy which occurred in a female subject or in a partner to a male 
subject to the S ponsor immediately  (within 24 hours) by  [CONTACT_15627] A of the Pregnancy  
Monitoring Form to the Sponsor’s unique entry

form must be completed in addition. 
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and Part B).
5.2.3 Assessment of safety laboratory parameters
All safet y laboratory  samples (except at Visit 1) will be collected after a full overnight fast 
(nothing to eat or drink except water for at least 10 hours) and before investigational drug as 
described in the Flow Chart and Section 6. The blood sample at Visit 1 (screening visit) can 
be taken with the patient in a fasted or non -fasted state. 
All parameters that will be determined during the trial conduct are listed in Table 5.2.3:1 and

For documentation of acute urinary  tract infections during trial conduct, the following 
measures have to be taken:
In an y case of suspected UTI (s ymptomatic or as ymptomatic) a urine culture sample has 
to be taken and sent to central lab for confirmation of the diagnosis. 
To be able to identify  asymptomatic UTI s immediately , a dipstick -test (leucocy te esterase 
[for WBC] and Nitrite) will be performed at the site at each safet y visit with urinalysis. In 
case of a positive result at site, a urine culture sample has to be taken and sent to central 
lab for confirmation of the diagnosis. A negative urine dipstick does not require a 
midstream urine culture sample to be sent to central lab, unless UTI is suspected.
If there is negative dipstick at site, but the dipstick performed at the central lab is positive, 
a mid- stream urine sample should be collected from the patient only  if the investigator 
has a suspi[INVESTIGATOR_1884] a UTI.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
All trial visits with the exception of ABPM visits should be routinely scheduled in the 
morning, at approximately  the same time of day  (07:00 AM to 11:00 AM).  For ABPM 
visits, patients shoul d arrive at approximately half an hour prior to medication intake to allow 
additional time for ABPM procedures, so that dosing of medication occurs as close as 
possible to patient daily  dosing time.  If a patient mistakenly  takes trial medication on the 
morning of a visit before attending the clinic (excluding visits starting before randomisation ) 
or comes in non -fasted where a fasting condition is required (all visits except screening), the 
visit should be rescheduled for another day  as soon as possible re minding the patient about 
the expected conditions. The rescheduled visit must take place in a short enough time -frame 
so that the patient has sufficient trial medication available.  Fasting visits should take place at 
a minimum of 10 hours after the end of the patient’s last meal.
Patients who are fasting (e.g. for religious or cultural reasons) should be instructed to perform 
HBGM tests regularl y and to contact [CONTACT_148886]/s ymptoms or values suggestive 
hypoglycemia .
All patients are to adhere
to the visit schedule as specified in the Flow Chart . If any  visit has 
to be rescheduled, subsequent visits should follow the original visit date schedule. The trial 
medication packs contain sufficient medication to allow for these time windows.

with Metformin at screening (y es/no) . 
Based on experiences with the primary  endpoints in other trials and based on literature data, 
the HbA1c change from baseline
,and change from baseline in BP are regarded as normally  
distributed. Therefore, a restricted maximum likelihood estimation based on mixed -effect 
model for repeated measures anal ysis or an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA )approach can 
be used. 
With regard to efficacy  and safet y endpoints, the term "baseline" refers to the las t observed 
measurement prior to administration of any  randomised study  medication.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
Primary Hypotheses
The confirmatory  analy ses will compare empagliflozin to placebo. The following hierarchical 
multiple testing procedure will be used to evaluate superiorit y for the primary  endpoint 
followed by [CONTACT_148897], while maintaining 
the overall probability  of a ty pe I error at 0.05. The primary  endpoint of change from baseline 
to 24 weeks in HbA1c along with the key secondary  endpoint schange from baseline in mean 
24-hour ambulatory  SBP at 12 weeks of treatment, change from baseline in mean trough 
ambulatory  SBP  at 12 weeks of treatment, change from baseline in body  weight in kg at w eek 
24 of treatment, and change from baseline in trough seated SBP at 12 weeks of treatment, 
will be tested in the following pre-specified hierarchical sequence, to address issues of 
multiplicity . Proceeding onto the next step in the sequence relies upon 
rejecting H0in the 
previous step, a ‘success’. Each step will only be considered confirmatory  if all previous 
steps were ‘successful’. If any of the previous steps were not successful, the tests of the 
subsequent steps have to be interpreted in an explorat ory sense . This procedure allows testing 
each step at the two -sided alpha -level of 5% :
1.change from baseline in HbA1c at 24 weeks of treatment
2.change from baseline in mean 24 -hour ambulatory  SBP at 12 weeks of treatment
3.change from baseline in mean trough ambulatory  SBP at 12 weeks of treatment
4.change from baseline in body  weight in kg at week 24 of treatment 
5. change from baseline in trough seated SBP at 12 weeks of treatment

Full Analysis Set
The full anal ysis set (FAS) will consist of all randomised patients who were treated with at 
least one dose of stud y drug and had a baseline and at least one on-treatment HbA1c 
measurement
Per Protocol Set
The per -protocol set (PPS) will consist of all randomised patients who are part of the FAS but 
who do not have an y important protocol violations (I PV) l eading to exclusion. Further details 
on the definition of the PPS and the definition of I PVs will be provided in the TSAP.
7.3.1 Primary analyses
Mean changes from baseline for HbA1c up to 24 weeks of treatment will be anal yzed using a 
restricted maximum likelihood (REML )
-based repeated measures approach on the FAS data 
set. Patients will be analysed according to the treatment group they  are randomised to.  
Analy ses will include the fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pre-treatment with 
Metformin at screening , renal function at baseline, visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction, as 
well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline HbA1c and baseline HbA1c - by-visit 
interaction. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the within patient 
measurements. If the model first fails to converge using an unstructured (co)variance 
structure, then a hierarchical approach is applied until a (co)variance structure is obtained 
where the model converges. Therefore the following (co)variance stru ctures are tested 
according to the pre -specified order: (1) unstructured, (2) Toeplitz, (3) variance components, 
(4) compound s ymmetry . As soon as one model converges this will be the final model used, 
therefore no further testing of subsequent (co)varianc e structures is required. The Kenward-
Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. Significance 
tests will be based on least- squares means using a two -sided α = 0.05 (two -sided 95%

The primary  endpoint analy sis method as detailed in Section 7.3.1 will be repeated for the 
PPS.
The primary  endpoint will as well be anal ysed using an ANCOVA model in the FAS. The 
model will include randomised treatment, pre-treatment with Metformin , and renal function 
at baseline as categ orical fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c as continuous covariate. Missing 
HbA1c data will be imputed using the LOCF approach. 
The term "baseline HbA1c" refers to the last assessment prior to the administration of any  
randomised study  medication. 
The mode l for the primary endpoint is as follows: 
HbA1c change from baseline at week 24
=overall mean
+ HbA1c at baseline
+ treatment
+ renal function
+ pretreatment with Metformin
+ random error
This model includes effects accounting for the following sou rces of variation: ‘HbA1c at 
baseline’, ‘renal function’ at baseline, ‘pretreatment with Metformin ’ at screening , and 
‘treatment’.  ‘Treatment’, ‘renal function’, and ‘ pretreatment with Metformin ’are fixed 
classification effects and ‘HbA1c baseline’ is a linear covariate. The random error is assumed 
to be normally  distributed with mean 0 and variance σ². This secondary  analy sis will be 
performed on the FAS with treatment assignment as randomised. Missing data will be 
imputed using the LOCF approach.
For th e key  secondary  endpoint s change from baseline in body weight in kg at week 24 of 
treatment and change from baseline in trough seated SBP at 12 weeks as well an ANCOVA 
model will be calculated on the FAS . The model for the change from baseline includes
‘treatment’, ‘renal function’ at baseline, ‘ pretreatment with Metformin’ at screening as fixed 
categorical effects ,andHbA1c at baseline, and baseline trough seated SBPor baseline bod y 
weight in kg respectivel y, as linear covariate.  Missing data will be imputed using the LOCF 
approach. 
The other continuous secondary  endpoints as listed in Section 5.1.1 will be anal ysed on the 
FAS as follows:

primary  anal yses for the key  secondary  endpoints.  
 
7.3.3 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities
(MedDRA) coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  tables and listings will be produced. All 
adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the residual effect period 
(REP), a period of [ADDRESS_171117] dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the 
treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, saf ety anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No h ypothesis testing is planned. 
Statistical analy sis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment -emergent 
adverse events. To this end, all adverse events occu rring between start of treatment and end 
of the REP will be considered ‘treatment- emergent’.  The REP is defined as  [ADDRESS_171118] drug intake and 
deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -emergent’.  Frequency , 
severit y, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated b y system organ class 
and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the MedDRA.
Laboratory  data will be ana lysed both quantitatively  as well as qualitatively. The latter will 
be done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the 
reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings . Treatment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distribution 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values. Vital signs, ph ysical examinations, or othe r 
safet y-relevant data observed at screening, baseline, during the course of the trial and at the 
end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings 
before start of treatment.

7.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
Mixed Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) models and ANCOVA models including a 
LOCF imputation of missing data are used like discussed above in Section 7.3.[ADDRESS_171119] model
will handle missing data based on a likelihood method under the "missing at random
assumption". Efficacy  data will be censored at the date of first intake of antidiabetic rescue 
medication for all analy ses, i.e., will be set to missing, if not explicitly  stated otherwise.
Blood pressure data will additionally  be censored from the day of change in antihy pertensive 
therap y. 
With respect to safet y evaluations, it is not planned to impute missing values. 
Further details will be provided in the TSAP.

Patients will be randomised to the two study  treatments in a 1:1 ratio. The randomisation will 
be performed in blocks. The block size will be reported in the Clinical Trial R eport (CTR) . 
The randomisation will be stratified b y the following factors:
screening HbA1c value (<8.5%,  ≥8.5%)
renal function at 
screening ( eGFR ≥120 ml/min/1.73m2,eGFR 120-60ml/min/1.73m2,
eGFR ≤ 60 ml/min /1.73m2)
pretreatment with Metformin at 
screening (y es/no)
The randomisation of patients to the treatment groups will be per formed via an IRT s ystem. 
BI will arrange for the randomisation as well as packaging and labelling of study  medication. 
The randomisation list will be generated using a validated sy stem, which involves a 
pseudorandom number generator and a supplied seed nu mber so that the resulting allocation 
of medication numbers to treatment is both reproducible and non -predictable.

8.4.1 Listedness
To fulfil the regulatory  requirements for expedited safet y reporting, the sponsor eval uates 
whether a particular adverse event is "listed ", i.e. is a known side effect of the drug or not.
Therefore a unique reference document for the evaluation of listedness need sto be provided. 
For the empagliflozin this is: the current version of the IB c01678844
.The current version of 
this reference document isto be provided in the I SF. No AEs are classified as listed for 
matching placebo.

-At Visit 2.1, the person assisting the patient with this process (e.g. the patient’s caregiver 
or relative) will attend the clinic together with the patie nt.
-The site staff should confirm that this individual will be present with the patient, 
whenever he/she is likel y to need to perform HBGM.
-The site staff should then train both the patient and above- mentioned individual with 
respect to the correct use of the HBGM equipment during each period of the trial.  This 
will include the use of the glucose meter itself and the test strips, lancet device and 
control solution(s).
-The site staff should also train both the patient and the above- mentioned individual with
respect to the completion of the HBGM testing log.  As for all other patients, the results 
of all per -protocol HBGM that is performed by /on illiterate patients should be 
documented on a HBGM testing log that will be included in the patients source documen t 
file.  In the event of h yper or hypogly cemia , the person assisting the patient should record 
symptoms on the HBGM testing log in accordance with the patient’s description.  
HGBM tests can be performed either b y the patient him/herself, or b y the person assisting the 
patient with this aspect of the trial. 
10.1.2 Patient information and informed consent (including pharmacogenetics)
In the event of recruiting an illiterate patient, the following process should be followed with 
respect to patient informatio n and informed consent: 
-The designated site personnel performing the informed consent process will read the trial-
approved patient information sheet and informed consent form to the patient, and explain 
the details of the trial, all in the presence of an impartial witness. 
-This impartial witness must be literate, and can be the patient’s relative or caregiver, or a 
member of staff emplo yed by [CONTACT_148901]. In 
addition, if there are an y further local regulations with respect to the consent of illiterate 
patients, these should also be followed. 
-The requirements of the trial will be explained thoroughl y and the patient will be given 
ample time to ask questions and consider his/her participation.  If he/she wishes, th e 
patient can take the patient information sheet and informed consent form home for further 
consideration.

10.4 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF LIVER INJURY
10.4.1 Introduction
Alterations of liver laboratory  parameters, as described in S ection [IP_ADDRESS] ,AESI , and hepatic 
SAEs are to be further evalua ted using the following procedures: 
10.4.2 Procedures
Repeat the following laboratory  tests: ALT, AST, and bilirubin (total and direct) - within 48 
to 72 hours and provide additional blood sample to the central laboratory for automatic reflex 
testing of t he below listed laboratory  parameters. Only  in case whereb y the central laboratory 
is not immediately  available (e.g. if the logistics are such that the patient´s repeat specimen 
would not reach the central laboratory  in a reasonable timeframe), ALT, AST, and bilirubin 
(total and direct) will be evaluated by [CONTACT_148902]. If in such a case ALT and/or AST >[ADDRESS_171135] 
combined with an elevation of total bilirubin >[ADDRESS_171136] 
and/or ALT ≥ 5fold ULN (without an elevation of total bilirubin ≥ [ADDRESS_171137]) are 
confirmed, results of the laboratory  parameters described below must be made available to 
the investigator and to BI as soon as possible.
In addition,

medical history according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF 
oobtain history  of concomitant drug use (including non -prescription 
medications, herbal and dietary  supplement preparations), alcohol use, 
recreational drug use, and special diets according to the “DILI checklist” 
provided in the I SF;
oobtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents (consider home 
and work place exposure) according to the “D ILI checklist” provided in the 
ISF;
and report these via the CRF and/or the “DILI checklist” .

changeA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an y AE which results in 
death, is immediately life-threatening, results in persistent or 
significant disability  / incapacit y, requires or prolongs in patient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_148843] , is a 
congenital anomal y / birth defect, or is to be deemed serious for an y 
other reason if it is an important medical event when based upon 
appropriate medical judgement which may  jeopardise the patient and 
may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the above definitions.
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the 
patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if 
more severe.
Every new occurrence of cancer will be reported as a SAE

Description of 
changeProtocol Specified Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI)
The term AESI relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular 
concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety 
assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs 
based on knowledge from other compounds in the same 
class. AESI need to be reported to the Sponsor’s 
Pharmacovigilance Department withi n the same timeframe 
that applies to SAE. The term AESI are events of medical 
concern requiring monitoring and rapid communication and 
can be classified as either serious or non -serious.  
In addition These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury 
alert and the patients showing the above alterations in liver 
parameters or hepatic (S)AEs should be followed up 
according to Section 10.5.2 of this CTP  and the “DILI 
checklist” provided in the I SF.
In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, 
unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, 
right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab 
results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the 
investigator should make sure these parameters are 
analysed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. 
Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, 
the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be 
followed.

the Follow -up period) will be collected, documented and reported to 
the sponsor by  [CONTACT_148908](s) / eCRFs / 
SAE reporting forms. Reporting will be done according to the 
specific definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘ Adverse Event 
Reporting’ section of the ISF. 
AE Collection 
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate 
eCRF by  [CONTACT_737]:
From signing the informed consent onwards until trial 
completion (End of Trial) or last per protocol contact, all AEs 
(serious and non -serious), and AESIs.  This also applies to 
patients who prematurely discontinue from the study.
For each adverse event, the investigator will provide the onset date, 
end date, intensity , treatment required, outcome, seriou sness, and 
action taken with the investigational drug. The investigator will 
determine the relationship of the investigational drug to all AEs as

any protocol required REP and / or follow -up), it should be reported 
by [CONTACT_148910].  Reporting will be done according to the specific 
definitions and instructions detailed in the ‘Adverse Event Reporting’ 
section of the ISF. 
BI has set up a list of AEs which are defined to be alway s serious. In 
order to support the investigator with the identification of these 
“alway s serious adverse events”, if a non- serious AE is identified to 
be serious per BI definition, a query will be raised. The investigator 
must verify  the description and seriousness of the event.  If the event 
description is correct, the item “serious” needs to be ticked and an 
SAE has to be reported in expedited fashion following the same 
procedure as above.
The list of these adverse events can be found via the RDC- system.
With receipt of an y further information to these events, a follow -up 
SAE report has to be provided. SAEs, AESI  and non -serious AEs 
must include a causal relationship assessment made by  [CONTACT_1275].
The SAE form is to be forwarded immediatel y (within 24 hours of 
awareness ) to the defined unique entry  point identified for the BI 
OPU (country -specific contact [CONTACT_148911] I SF) or 
by [CONTACT_148912]. This immediate report is 
required irrespective of whether the investigational product has been 
administered or not and irrespective of causal relationship. In 
specific occasions the Investigator could inform the Sponsor 
upfront via telephone; however, this does not replace the 
requirement to complete and submit the BI SAE form.  It also 
applies if new information to existing SAEs, AESI or non- serious 
AEs relevant to the SAE or AESI becomes avail able. 
Pregnancy
Intherare case that a female subject participating in this clinical 
trial becomes pregnant s, pregnancy  might occur in clinical trials.

cases, the presentation of the condition was atypi[INVESTIGATOR_148845], below 14 mm ol/L 
(250 mg/dl).
The risk of DKA must be considered in the event of non -
specific symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, 
abdominal pain, excessive thirst, difficulty breathing, 
confusion, unusual fatigue or sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]. In addition it needs 
to be take n into account that, due to the insulin independent 
mode of action, there is a possibility that ketoacidosis in 
patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors is not accompanied by 
[CONTACT_11017][INVESTIGATOR_148846].
Patients who may be at higher ri sk of DKA while taking 
SGLT2 inhibitors include patients on a very low 
carbohydrate diet (as the combination may further increase 
ketone body production), severely dehydrated patients, and 
patients with a history of ketoacidosis or who are known to 
have a low beta- cell function reserve.

until the situation is clarified.
2) Patients who drop out during the screening phase prior to 
randomi sation (Visit 3) will be considered screening 
failures. They  have to be recorded as screening failure in 
eCRFs and no further follow -up is required.  SAEs 
occurring in patients after having discontinued in the 
study  due to screening failures and who did not receive 
any study  medication, should be reported if the

In general patients shou ld be encouraged to re- start study  
medication in case of temporary  treatment interruptions.  I f the 
duration of interruption is more than 7 day s, this should be 
recorded in the “Stud y Medication Temporary Discontinued/re -

For the analysis of this trial it is absolutely crucial that all 
planned assessments are done as planned, even if patients 
discontinue trial treatment. Patients who discontinue 
treatment prematurely and who do not withdraw their 
informed consent must therefore be followed u p for the 
intended regular treatment period. All assessments related to 
the primary and secondary endpoints must be performed as if 
the patient would have remained on treatment.
For patients who stop study  medication permanently  prior to 
completion of 24 w eeks of treatment and who are willing to be 
followed up , the following should be performed whenever 
possible: 
Premature treatment discontinuation (PTD) visit
should be performed within [ADDRESS_171164] the

Subsequently, a follow -up visit (Visit 8 procedures) 
should be conducted wi thin 14 days of the PTD on visit

HbA1c and baseline HbA1c - by-visit interaction. An 
unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model 
the within patient measurements. If this anal ysis fails to 
converge, the following covariance structures will be 
tested: AR (1), Toeplitz and compound sy mme try.If the 
model first fails to converge using an unstructured 
(co)variance structure, then a hierarchical approach is 
applied until a (co)variance structure is obtained 
where the model converges. Therefore the following

specified order: (1) unstructured, (2) Toeplitz, (3) 
variance components, (4) compound symmetry. As 
soon as one model converges this will be the final 
model used, therefore no further testing of subsequent 
(co)variance structures is r equired. If the anal ysis with 
unstructured (co)variance structure fails, the covariance 
structures AR (1), Toeplitz and compound sy mmetry are 
tested and the covariance structure converging to the best

Description of 
changeAdverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as a response to a medicinal 
product which is noxious and unintended. Response in this 
context means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an adverse event is at least a reasonable 
possibility. Adverse reactions may arise from use of the 
product within or outside the terms of the marketing 
authorisation or from occupational exposure. Conditions of 
use outside the marketi ng authorization include off label use, 
overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors.
Rationale for 
changeAddition of new definition of Adverse Reaction

Rationale for

assessment of serious adverse events or adverse reactions.
Section to be 
changed15 [IP_ADDRESS] Definitions of adverse events- Causal relationship of 
adverse event
Description of 
changeThe definition of an adverse reaction im plies at least a 
reasonable possibility of a causal
relationship between a suspected medicinal product and an 
adverse event. An adverse
reaction, in contrast to an adverse event, is characterised by 
[CONTACT_49392] a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product and an occurrence is suspected.
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, 
considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, 
temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, confounding 
factors such as concomit ant medication, concomitant diseases and 
relevant history . 
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship could be:
• The event is consistent with the known pharmacology 
of the drug
• The event is known to be ca used by [CONTACT_148923].
• A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the 
time of drug exposure.
• Evidence that the event is reproducible when the 
drug is re -introduced
• No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could 
explai n the event (e.g. preexisting or concomitant 
diseases, or co- medications).
• The event is typi[INVESTIGATOR_23239] -related and infrequent in 
the general population not
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens -Johnson syndrome).
• An indication of dose -response (i.e. greater e ffect size 
if the dose is increased, smaller effect size if dose is 
diminished).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable 
possibility of a causal relationship could be:
• No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the

time of drug e xposure is evident (e.g. pre -treatment 
cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within 
days / weeks of drug administration; an allergic 
reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug 
concerned)
• Continuation of the event despi[INVESTIGATOR_148855], taking into
account the pharmacological properties of the 
compound (e.g. after 5 half -lives).
Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events 
whose time course is prolonged despi[INVESTIGATOR_148856].
• Additional arguments amongst those stated before, 
like alternative explanation (e.g. situations where other 
drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more 
likely explanation for the observed event than the drug 
concerned).
• Disappearance of the event even though the study 
drug treatment continues or remains unchanged.
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the 
investigational product administered and the AE. 
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the 
investigational product administe red and the AE.

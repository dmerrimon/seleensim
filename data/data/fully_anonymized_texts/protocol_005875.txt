T1DM   Type [ADDRESS_1226455] Overview/Summary:  
This is a single -center, prospective, ‘open -label,’ investigator -initiated pi[INVESTIGATOR_877775] (CGM) use either alone or with remote monitoring capabilities that enable 
subjects to share CGM data with family and friends (whom we will call “ followers” in this protocol) among 
women with T1DM associated with pregnancy.   We hypothesize that CGM use will decrease percentage of 
glucose values below the target range, decrease frequency of severe hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] , and 
increase post -prandial glucose values into the target range, with a possible reduction in A1C compared to 
not using CGM during pregnancy. We hypothesize that the use of remote  technology (Share™  
technology)  with subject’ s designated f ollower will decrease hypoglycemia fear and the frequency of 
severe hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_877776] e in 
pregnancy . This study aims to improve maternal glucose management among women with T1DM with a 
hope to also improve health outcomes during pregnancy . 
The study will enroll up to 40 patients from the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood Diabetes (BDC) Ad ult 
clinic over the age of 18 years who are pregnant (13 weeks gestation or less) or plan to become pregnant 
within the following 6 months. The study will also attempt to enroll up to 40 followers (one per pregnant 
subject) who are family members or friends of the pregnant subjects and over the age of [ADDRESS_1226456] s will be stratified into one of three groups: (1) CGM use alone, (2) CG M use with Share™, 
(3) no CGM use. CGM use will be offered to all subject s, but individuals who do not want to wear a CGM 
will be stratified to Group 3. Stratification for Groups 1 and 2 will depend on the following: subject s and 
followe rs who have iPhones , iPads,  and/or iPod touche s will be placed into Group [ADDRESS_1226457] s in Groups 1 and 2 will wear the Dexc om 
G4 Platinum® CGM system from the first pregnancy visit until delivery . All subjects in Group 2 will also use 
the Share™ technology from the first pregnancy visit until delivery.  
CGM data will be analyzed for mean blood glucose values, time spent in hyperglycemic (>240, >300mg/dl) 
and hypoglycemic (<50, <70, <80 mg/dl) ranges and various indices of glycemic variability.  Laboratory 
analysis for A1C  will be performed at baseline,  monthly thereafter during the pregnancy , and post -partum .   
Routine blood tests will be performed in all subject s in each trimester  (see Table 1). 
Primary outcomes  will be:  
1) Glucose variability  as measured by [CONTACT_877789]-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) data 
through log books and dow nloads  as well as  CGM downloads and various indices [J -index, mean 
amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), high blood glucose index (HBGI), low blood glucose index 
(LBGI)] from CGM downloads .  
2) Changes detected by [CONTACT_877790].  
. 
Secondary outcomes will be:  
1) How CGM alone and CGM with Share™ usage affect A1C  compared to no CGM use,  
2) Progression of diabetes complications (retinopathy, nephropathy),  
3) Maternal and fetal outcomes (eclampsia/pre -eclampsia, live birth rates, birth wei ght, neonatal 
hypoglycem ia, and other similar measures).  
 
Introduction:  
Among the US population, 29.1 million people (9.3%) have diabetes (1). Pre-existing diabetes has to be 
managed very carefully throughout pregnancy to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes (2) . Among women 
Polsky, et al.             [ADDRESS_1226458] to regulate maternal glucose control include multiple 
daily injections (MDI), continuous subcutaneous insulin infus ion therapy (CSII) also known as  insulin pump 
therapy, and for high- risk individuals continuous glucose monitoring (CGM ) (2). CGM use in pregnancy has 
been shown to be safe, to reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycemia, and to improve A1C values (3-6). 
Sensor -augmented pump therapy with CGM  use continuously was shown to lower A1C more than 
intermittent use in pregnant women with T1DM (7) . However, few studies have measured changes in 
glucose variability that occur with CGM use during pregnancy and no studies have evaluated how tools that 
allow family and friends (followers) to access glucose trends affect outcomes during pregnancy.  
The goal of this prospective, non- randomized, pi[INVESTIGATOR_877777] , A1C control, and patient -
related outcomes  compared to non- CGM use in pregnancy among women with T1DM . This study may lead 
to further investigations about the role of mobile phones and handheld devices (such as iPod touch) for 
T1DM self -care in pregnancy.  
The Barbara Davis Center (BDC) Adult Clinic follows ~3,000 patients with T1D M. Sarit Polsky, MD, MPH is 
this study’s Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_877778]’s Health Cl inic at the BDC, 
which includes an extensive multidisciplinary team (physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, registered 
nurses, certified diabetes educators, registered dieticians, and a social worker). The BDC Pregnancy and 
Women’s Health Clinic has al l the necessary resources to perform such a trial.  Moreover, the investigators 
have extensive experience conducting clinical trials , including trials during pregnancy .   
Primary Objectives : 
The primary objectives of this pi[INVESTIGATOR_877779] , to assess the role 
of CGM usage either alone or with remote monitoring capabilities ( Share™ ) and c hanges detected by [CONTACT_877791] T1DM associated with pregnancy .   
Secondary objectives:  
1. Assessme nt of remote monitoring capabilities  of followers (Share™ usage) that lead to 
interventions  for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that affect subject s wearing CGM.  
2. Reduction in A1C from baseline to 3 months with maintained control at 6 and 9 months.  
3. Assess pr ogression or stability of diabetes complications (retinopathy, nephropathy).  
4. Assess effects of CGM usage on maternal and fetal health outcomes (eclampsia/pre -eclampsia, 
live birth rates, birth weight, neonatal hypoglycemia, and other similar measures).  
Research Design:  
What do we intend to do? 
We intend to execute a single- center, prospective, non -randomized, ‘open- label,’ investigator initiated pi[INVESTIGATOR_877780] 
T1D throughout pregnancy  and compare outcomes to women who do not use a CGM during pregnancy . 
We also intend to a sk a main follower for each woman about his/her knowledge of extreme glucose values  
among subjects and interventions on a subject’s behalf.  See Fig ure 1 for study design.  
 
 
Polsky, et al.             6  
How are we going to do the work?  
 
The BDC is primarily a T1DM  clinical and research center and follow s large numbers of patients with 
T1DM. Pregnant women are followed in the Pregnancy and Women’s Health clinic at the BDC.  All site 
personnel will attend an investigator’s meeting, which will be organized and conducted before trial initiation.  
All subjects  prospectively enrolled will sign an informed consent form approved by [CONTACT_877792] (WIRB) through the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB).  A follower, 
designated by [CONTACT_6992] , will also be asked to sign an informed consent form approved by [CONTACT_184282] (WIRB) through the Colorado Multiple Instit utional Revie w Board (COMIRB), 
however follower consent will not obligatory for a pregnant subject to participate in the study.  Subjects 
identified through the retrospective chart review of existing data who are no longer pregnant, may have 
irregular visits to the Barbara Davis Center and in some cases only return to clinic once per year . As such, 
these subjects will be contact[CONTACT_174877] e -mail to see if they are interested in participating in the study. 
Interested post -partum women will be sent the consent form approved by [CONTACT_877793]. We will undergo consenting procedures with subjects in person, when 
possible, or  by [CONTACT_877794]. After our staff 
signs the consent form, subjects will receive a copy of the completed, signed consent form. 
Communications with the consent form with subjects in the retrospective chart review will take place via e-
mail, [LOCATION_002] Postal Service, or fax (to be determined by  [CONTACT_101583], security of devices, and subject 
preference).  
What is the study population?  
The primary  study population will consist of women at the BDC in the pre -conception and early gestational 
periods that are eligible for this pi[INVESTIGATOR_553357] -initiated CGM QI Project .  Subject s will be women 
intending to become pregnant or within the first [ADDRESS_1226459] s being recruited into the study?  
Subjects will be recruited from the BDC Pregnan cy and Women’s Health clinic  for screening, as well as the 
BDC Adult Clinic . During pre- conception counseling visits, women will be approached about participating in 
the study  (if eligible). We will maintain a list of women intending to conceive within the  next [ADDRESS_1226460] her to inq uire if she still plans to conceive (keep subject  on the list) or not (remove from list).  
 
Women who have their first pregnancy visit at the BDC at 13 weeks of gestation or less will be screened for 
the study . If eligible an d interested in participating, a fter signing the informed consent, women will be 
stratified  to either CGM use alone (Group 1) or CGM use with Share™ (Group 2). As Share™  requires 
specific device use, Group [ADDRESS_1226461] an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and whose main follower also has an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, or 
other compatible device for downloading the Follower app. If eligible to participate but not interested in 
using a Dexcom CGM, women will be invited to sign informed consent so that we may follow their 
Polsky, et al.             7 outcomes over the course of the pregnancy while diabetes control is managed per usual care ( Group 1 for 
women using  a non- Dexcom  CGM such as Medtronic Enlite CGM or Group 3 for no CGM use ). A PRA will 
maintain an active list of individuals and will update the list continuously as women are assigned into 
groups. All subjects will have similar clinical visits throughout the pregnancy.  
 
Subjects stratified to Group 2, CGM use with Share™ , will be asked to designate followers who will be able 
to view glucose trends and receive alerts for high or low sensor glucose values on an iPhone, iPad, iPod 
touch, and/or other compatible device. While multiple followers are allowed, one will be the main follower 
and will be invited to sign informed consent at the screening visit or  within the first two months of each 
subject’s study participation. Subjects stratified into Groups [ADDRESS_1226462]’s extreme glucose values (lows or highs) through contact [CONTACT_877795] t or within the first two months of each subject’s study participation.  
What are the treatment groups? 
There will be three ‘open- label’ treatment arms consisting of routine care in the Pregnancy and Women’s 
Health c linic at t he BDC  (no CGM use), an interve ntion arm using the Dexcom  G4 or G5  Platinum® CGM 
system during pregnancy, and an additional  treatment arm using the Dexcom  G4 or G5  Platinum® CGM 
system with Share™  remote monitoring capabilities during pregnancy . As this is a non- randomized study 
and most women will opt to be in the Dexcom alone or Dexcom Share groups, we will include pregnant no 
CGM users identified through a retrospective chart review  into the no CGM arm of the study . 
How many subjects per treatment arm?  
A total of up to 40 pregnant wom en will be prospectively recruited into the study. As this is an ‘open- label’ 
study whose group stratification is based on subject characteristics (willingness to wear CGM, subject 
possession of iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, follower possession of iPhone, i Pad, or iPod touch), we cannot 
predict the number of subjects per treatment arm. Based on our current pregnant population’s willingness 
to use CGM  and device usage, we anticipate that [ADDRESS_1226463] (up to 40 adults) 
who will be asked questions once per month about knowledge of the subject’s glucose trends and 
interventions that s/he may have done on her behalf over the last month.  
What is the schedule of events for the t reatment groups?  
After screening, when pregnancy is confirmed subjects will be stratified to Group 1, 2, or 3. Subjects in all 
groups  will have similar study/clinic visits for data acquisition at the screening, pregnancy visits (which 
occur a minimum of mo nthly throughout gestation), and post -partum clinic visit . All subjects will be required 
to test blood glucoses at least 7  times a day  throughout pregnancy . All subjects will be asked to log the 
SMBG values 7 times a day  with insulin doses for meals  for 1 week every trimester  of the pregnancy.  
Subjects stratified to CGM wear will be provided with a Dexcom  G4 CGM, transmitter, and sensors (4 per 
month).  Subjects stratified to CGM wear who want to use their personal Dexcom G5 devices will be asked 
to provider  Dexcom mobile usernames  (if they use G5 with an iPhone) and will be provided with sensors (4 
Polsky, et al.             8 per month). Subjects already using a Dexcom  G4 or G5  CGM will be provided only with the sensors.  
Replacement transmitters will be provided on an as needed basis during the study. A designated CDE or 
nurse will train each subject in the use of CGM at Visit 2, including how to use the sensor data (rate of 
change of glucose, to cross -check with fingerstick blood glucose as per FDA label before action is taken). 
Subjec ts in Group 2 will be additionally  instructed on how to use the Platinum System with Share™ and will 
set up contact [CONTACT_877796]. Subjects will be asked to wear the CGM for the 
duration of the pregnancy and to change sensor s ites every [ADDRESS_1226464] s will be encouraged to 
check the blood glucose level (SMBG) before taking action on the CGM glucose values (as per the FDA 
label).  Subjects in Groups [ADDRESS_1226465] s will be asked to return to clinic a minimum of once per month for pregnancy care with a BDC 
provider and to receive the next month’s sensors from a designated PRA. There are women whom  we ask 
to return to clinic based on their clinical needs every week or every [ADDRESS_1226466] -partum visit.   
What is the schedule of events for the follower group?  
After screening, subject s assigned to Group [ADDRESS_1226467] . After screening, subjects assigned to Groups  1 or 3 will 
be asked to designate a main follower with whom she shares time and/or information about her diabetes 
care and who may intervene on her behalf should a need arise (e.g., provide glucagon for severe 
hypoglycemia, or suggest going to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_877781]). Main followers who sign 
informed consent , which will be obtained in person or by [CONTACT_648],  will be asked to fill out a brief 
questionnaire once per month inquiring about the frequency of viewing  information about glucose trends, 
receiving alerts  or information about extreme low and high glucose values , and acting upon  
aforementioned  data to assist the subject . The main follower can fill out the Follower Questionnaire on 
paper or s/he  can receive the follower questionnaire electronically through REDCap is s/he has a working 
e-mail address  (see Data Collection Tools  section for details).   
Description of Mobile Technology:  
Subject s in Group 2 will be trained on the use of Dexcom G4 Platinum® CGM system with Share™ .  This 
is a bluetooth low energy secure wireless communication system that allows remote viewing of sensor 
glucose levels, trends,  and data between the person with diabetes wearing the CGM and her designated 
family members or friends. The followers can additionally receive alerts (alarms) for pre- specified low 
sensor glucose and high sensor glucose values. The person with diabetes can also designate herself as a 
follower to allow access to data through the approved devices. This technology is currently only available 
for use with Apple iPhone®, iPad, or iPod touch®. Followers have to have access to a device (smart phone) 
that allows download of the Dexcom Follower app. We will not provide iPhones , iPads, or iPods to subject s 
or followers for this study.  
Visit Descriptions:  
Polsky, et al.             9 Screening, Visit 1 (Week 0 ): 
The s tudy will begin with a screening visit  either during a pre -conception counseling visit or within the first 
13 weeks of gestation: Visit 1, (Week - 0).  All subject s meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be invited to 
sign informed consent , which  will be obtained at this study visit.   
During this visit, pregnant subject s will rec eive a physical exam, vitals, medical history, demographics, and 
concomitant medications . Laboratory tests will be performed to assess for A1C . SMBG values will be 
downloaded. If applicable CGM units  and insulin pumps wi ll be downloaded.  
Stratification, V isit 2 (Week 1):  
Subject s enrolled in the study from pre -conception will be asked to come to clinic as soon as a home 
pregnancy test or serum blood test confirms pregnancy, during which  time routine clinical care will be 
provided and subject s will be stra tified to [ADDRESS_1226468] a pre -conception counseling visit who come to clinic for routine clinical care before 13 weeks 
of gestation will combine Visit 1 (screening) with Visit 2 (stratificatio n with CGM start ). A urine pregnancy 
test will be administered to confirm pregnancy . Per routine clinical care, we will screen for diabetic 
neuropathy on physical exam, thyroid disease (TSH blood draw), and kidney disease (24- hour urine protein 
with creatinine). These tests will be repeated once each trimester. Also per routine clinical care, women will 
be asked to get a dilated retinal eye exam each trimester and to provide the BDC with a copy of the 
provider’s report of each exam.  
Women stratified to Grou ps 1 and 2 who own a Dexcom G4 or G5 Platinum CGM® will be given 4 sensors. 
Women stratified to Groups 1 and 2 who do not own a Dexcom G4 or G5 Platinum CGM® will be given 
Dexcom G4 CGM units, transmitters, and 4 sensors. They will also receive training in the insertion of 
sensors and CGM use. A Dexcom G4 Platinum® CGM sensor will be inserted that day and will be worn in [ADDRESS_1226469] s will be asked to wear the device 7 days/week, 
satisfactory data capture rate is regarded as 5 days of successful CGM readings.  The CGM data will be 
unblinded (real -time use) such that subject s will be able to view glucose values and trends, as well as 
receive alerts for low and high sensor glucose values. Women will be asked to check SMBG  at least 7  
times daily (fasting, before meal s, 2 hours after a meal s, and at bedtime ) for the duration of the study.  
Women in Group 2 will  be trained in the use of the Share™ technology. They will  be asked to designate a 
main follower and up to [ADDRESS_1226470] ’s needs (for example a low glucose alert 
with a higher glucose value for subject s with hypoglycemia unawareness compared to those without it). 
The main follower for each subject will be approached and asked to sign informed consent at Visit [ADDRESS_1226471]’s first pregnancy visit. Study participation of a main follower will be 
encouraged but not obligatory.  
Women unwilling to wear a CGM but willing  to participa te in the study (Group 3) will be asked to check 
SMBG at least 7  times daily (fasting, before each  meal, and 2 hours after meal s, and at bedtime), per 
standard of care, for the duration of the study. All [ADDRESS_1226472] (Groups 1 through 3) 
Polsky, et al.             [ADDRESS_1226473]’s first 
pregnancy visit. Study participation of a main follower will be encouraged but not obligatory.  
Data on all subject s for medical history, existing diabetes complications, medications, vital signs, 
height/weight, A1C (current and most -immediately pre- conception) , insulin doses, glucometer downloads, 
insulin pump downloads (if applicable) , CGM downloads (if applicable) , and adverse events  (AEs) will be 
collected.  If the woman was seen at the Barbara Davis Center prior to the consent visit, we will do a 
retrospective chart review for medications, vital signs, height/weight, A1C, insulin doses, glucometer 
downloads, insulin pump downloads (if applicable), and CGM downloads (if applicable)  for the most -
immediate pre -conception clinic visit and for visits during the current pregnancy . Each  subject  will be given 
a hypoglycemic  fear questionnaire. We will ask women about interventions that have taken place over the 
last month for extremely low and high glucose values, directed by [CONTACT_426569] a third party, and keep the 
information on research source documents.  
Visit s 3 through 13 (Weeks 5 to 40) : 
Subject s will come to the BDC for routine clinical care at least once per month for the duration of the 
pregnancy (through gestational week 40, though some women deliver up to 42 weeks gestation) and f or 
continued study participation. Per routine clinical care, we will screen for diabetic neuropathy on physical 
exam, thyroid disease (TSH blood draw), and kidney disease (24- hour urine protein with creatinine) at least 
once each trimester. Also per routine clinical care, women will be asked to get a dilated retinal eye exam 
each trimester and to provide the BDC with a copy of the provider’s report of each exam.  
Subject s in Groups 1 and 2 will receive 4 new sensors per month, but may choose to get 2 sensors  twice a 
month instead, at study visits. Use of acetaminophen- containing medications like Tylenol® during sensor 
wear may affect device performance, therefore we will  ask subject s to keep a log of each time these  
medications  are used. We will ask subjects at each monthly visit whether she used acetaminophen-
containing medications during the previous month and when. Followers will be administered a brief 
questionnaire at the beginning of every month inquiring on the frequency of low alerts, high alerts, view ing 
glucose trends, and actions they may have taken on behalf of the subject s because of the above (see 
Table 2 and Follower Questionnaire for details).  On source documents, we will also record how often 
subjects required an intervention  for low or high gl ucose values within the previous month , and the nature 
of the interventions . If in Group 2, we will keep source documentation about interventions resulting from a 
Share™ alert within the previous month.  
Data on all pregnant subject s for medications, vital signs, height/weight, insulin doses, glucometer 
downloads, insulin pump downloads (if applicable),  and CGM downloads (if applicable) will be collected at 
least once per month and as often as every week.  All subjects will be asked to collect a 7- point profi le for 
SMBG measurements (blood glucose measurements before meals, 2 hours after meals, and at bedtime) 
along with meal insulin dosing for 1 week once per trimester  (see SMBG Questionnaire) . A1C will be 
measured once per month. Subject s will be asked about  updated concomitant drugs and any AEs that may 
have occurred.  Each subject will be given a hypoglycemic fear questionnaire.  
Visit 14 (Weeks 44  to 52 ): 
All subject s will have routine post -partum clinical care between [ADDRESS_1226474] s for 
medications, vital signs, height/weight, insulin doses, SMBG values, glucometer downloads, insulin pump 
downloads (if applicable), and CGM downloads (if applicable) will be collected. All subjects will be asked to 
Polsky, et al.             [ADDRESS_1226475] a 7 -point profile for SMBG measurements (blood glucose measurements before meals, 2 hours 
after meals, and at bedtime) along with meal insulin dosing for [ADDRESS_1226476] -partum  period (see 
SMBG Questionnaire) . A1C will be measured. Subject s will be asked about updated concomitant drugs 
and any AEs  that may have occurred.  Subject s in Groups [ADDRESS_1226477] had a Dexcom G4 Platinum 
CGM® for personal use prior to study participati on and may thereafter still wear the device after labor and 
delivery. In such cases, CGM downloads will be included in study data. On source documents, we will 
record how often subjects required an intervention for low or high glucose values within the previous 
month, and the nature of the interventions. Subject s will be administered a questionnaire inquiring about 
the labor and delivery process, maternal and fetal complications before and after delivery, baby’s 
anthropometrics at birth (weight and length),  baby’ s current age, breastfeeding, and other measures (see 
BDC Pregnancy CGM Post -Partum Questionnaire for details).  If the pregnancy ended early (for example, 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth) or resulted in fetal or neonatal death (for example, stillbirth) we will obtain 
data about these outcomes. Each subject will be given a hypoglycemic fear questionnaire. Followers will be 
asked to fill out their last Follower Questionnaire during the post -partum period.  
Control Arm:  
As outlined in the proposal, the subject s prospectively enrolled in this arm (Group 3) will receive the same 
care as in the intervention arm s (Groups 1 and 2)  with the exception of not having access to the Dexcom 
G4 Platinum CGM® with or without Share™ technology .  
There will also be a control arm of pregnant patients at the BDC identified through a retrospective chart 
review who were pregnant around the time of study enrollment or before and who did not use a CGM 
device throughout their pregnancies.  The retrospective chart review will c ollect data on a subject’s  medical 
history, diabetes complications, medications, vital signs, height/weight, A1C, insulin doses, glucose meter 
downloads, insulin pump downloads (if applicable), and CGM downloads (if applicable) for the most 
immediate pre- conception visit, all pregnancy visits, and the post -partum visit. Subjects identified through 
the retrospective chart review will not have filled out any of our questionnaires (baseline, hypoglycemic 
fear, and postpartum  questionnaires), nor will they have had followers who filled out questionnaires . They 
will not be asked to fill out these questionnaires.  
Inclusion Criteria:  
Subject s that meet the following criteria will be considered for admission to the study:  
1. Signed informed consent before any study -related activities  
2. Female aged 18 years and older with T1D duration >[ADDRESS_1226478] 3 -7 blood glucose measurements per day

6. Any A1C l evel 
7. Ability and willingness to adhere to the protocol including scheduled study visits for the duration of 
the pregnancy  
8. Able to speak, read , and write English 
Exclusion Criteria:  
Subject s will be excluded from the study if any of the following apply:  
Polsky, et al.             12 1. Unwilling to sign informed consent and participate in the study  
2. Female age 17 years or younger

5. Extensive skin changes/diseases that inhibit wearing a sensor on normal skin  
6. Severe k nown allergy to adhesives  within the last [ADDRESS_1226479]’s suitability for the trial, or impairs the validity of the informed consent  
Risks and Justification of Procedures:  
CGM: Continuous glucose monitoring is an FDA approved technology that offers a unique and practical 
way of identifying and differentiating clinical benefits of intensive diabetes care. The American Diabetes 
Association currently recommends CGM use during pregnancy for high -risk individuals  (2).  We currently 
have hundreds of patients , which include many pregnant patients,  in the Adult Clinic at The BDC using 
CGM on a regular basis as part o f usual medical management of their diabetes. Subjects may experience 
pain at the site of sensor insertion.  The adhesive pads for the sensor may cause skin erythema for 1  to 2 
days or more. An allergic reaction to 1 or more parts of CGM devices may occur w hich can be mild, 
moderate, or severe (rare).  In rare cases, an infection at the sensor site may occur.  In rare cases, the 
sensor or needle may break inside the body and would require a minor surgical procedure to remove it.  
Data Collection Tools:  
A confid ential subject database will be established to maintain study data. Data will be entered into 
REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is an internal secure, computerized database 
system at the University of Colorado Denver. This system allows dat a entry, survey/ questionnaire building, 
data exportation to statistical packages, and is HIPAA compliant. Each subject  will be assigned an 
identification number, which will be used to code and identify all of that subject ’s records. This will avoid the 
continual use of subject  names. REDCap surveys can be sent to study participants via e- mail for direct 
input into the database. The electronic medical record system at the Barbara Davis Center will be used to 
conduct a retrospective chart review to identify B DC patients not using a CGM device who were pregnant 
around the time of study enrollment and before. Their data will be put into REDCap and will be de-
indentified for data analyses. All study data will be locked in PI’s office and all relevant computer study files 
will be input on staff computer s, which are password protected and contain encryption software. Data 
storage will be take place on a secured server maintained by [CONTACT_38301]. The server is 
backed up nightly and a copy of the back -up file is kept off site in a secure facility. Data access will be 
limited to study personnel. Study results may be presented in the form of posters, abstracts, oral 
presentations, or publications at academic meetings or in journals. In all forms of study result reporting, 
subject  identification will not be disclosed. A study subject  may access his/her protected health information 
at any time by [CONTACT_160001]. The investigative team has been 
trained in IRB and HIPA A compliance issues and will maintain confidentiality and protect health 
information. The above- stated procedures have been highly effective in preventing breaches of patient 
confidentiality for the prior and cur rent research studies in which the PI  [INVESTIGATOR_877782] s to be 
involved at the University of Colorado Denver.  
Safety Measures:  
Polsky, et al.             [ADDRESS_1226480] (DSMB) consisting of Drs. Janet Snell -Bergeon (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_877783]), Peter Gottlieb, and Viral Shah will oversee safety data t hroughout the study via reporting of 
hypoglycemic events, adverse events (AE), and severe adverse events (SAEs) if any.   
All AEs, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], as well as those noted by [CONTACT_7413], 
regardless of seriousness, severity or expectedness will be recorded on source documents from the time of 
obtaining the informed consent.   
Severe hypoglycemia as defined as a hypoglycemic epi[INVESTIGATOR_877784].  A hypoglycemic event “requiring assistance” is determined 
when the subject is unable to treat the event on her own.  Any untoward event resulting in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
extension of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], death, or threat of death will also be considered an  SAE.  SAEs will be 
reported to the DSMB.  The endpoints of A1C  and mean glucose readings will be excluded from SAE 
reporting.  
Weakness of the Study  
This is not a randomized clinical trial, as the Dexcom remote monitoring technology is not available for 
other types of handheld devices besides the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch.   This is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_877785] .  
Our goal is to learn from this study and plan for a much larger study where handheld devices are also 
provided and thus randomization can occur  in the future after implementing changes that will be learned  
from this pi[INVESTIGATOR_799].  
Statistical Analysis Plan:  
Statistical analysis is expected to be complet ed within [ADDRESS_1226481].  Analysis will be conducted with an intent ion to treat approach .  We will aim to recruit up to 40  
pregnant subjects and plan for a 20% drop -out rate (n= 8) to have 32  subjects complete the study.  We aim 
to enroll up to 40 followers, but as their participation will be not be obligatory outcomes will not depend on 
their enrollment.  As this is a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] -study and has no formal power, calculations will be performed for the 
primary or secondar y endpoints.  
The primary endpoint s are glucose variability  and changes detected by [CONTACT_877797] . We will 
measure indices of glucose variability (mean glucose ± SD, % of glucose within/above/below target ranges, 
J Index , High Blood Glucose Index [HBGI], Low Blood Glucose Index [LBGI], Mean Amplitude of Glycemic 
Excursions [MAGE], CONGA n) throughout pregnancy  using the SMBG 7- point profiles for one week taken 
once per trimester . Hypoglycemic fear survey results will be assessed once monthly over  the pregnancy. 
We will compare outcomes within individuals over time and between individuals of the different study arms. 
We will test whether outcomes differ between women using Dexcom alone and women using Dexcom with 
Share™ using interaction terms, and will stratify analyses if differences by [CONTACT_877798] 10 mg/dL 
in mean glucose levels  are detected. Since SMBG logs will be taken at multiple time points over the 
pregnancy and since CGMs will be worn continuously for the duration of each pregnancy, linear mixed 
models will be used to assess changes in outcome measures (GV, time spent in target below or above 
target) over time in each trimester  of pregnancy. We will use linear mixed models to assess changes in the 
hypoglycemic fear survey in each month of the pregnancy. Secondary endpoints include A1C differences 
among study arms . Improvement in glycemic variability parameters with a possible reduction of A1C by 
0.3%, measured as the difference of the mean A1C laboratory values of the arms of the study between 
baseline (0- [ADDRESS_1226482] trimester), second trimester (3 -6 months), and third trimester (6 to 9 months).  
Mixed models account for missing data, allow for an unstructured covariance matrix for repeated 
measures, and account for inter -subje cts correlation of measurements. Secondary outcomes will be used 
Polsky, et al.             14 in the same mixed models.  Differences in frequency of low alert glucose rates, high alert glucose rates, 
and interventions for low or high glucose values among the followers for each study arm will be analyzed 
with student t -tests. A p-value < 0.05 will be considered significant, and we will perform statistical analyses 
with SAS software (version 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary NC).  
 
Publication Strategy:  
The BDC is a leading clinical T1DM clinical and research center .  All study personnel will attend an 
investigator’s meeting, which will be organized and conducted before trial initiation.  All subjects  will sign an 
informed consent form approved by [CONTACT_244734] (WIRB) and the C olorado Multiple 
Institutional Review Board (COMIRB).   
Study results will be presented at national and international conferences including the Scientific Sessions 
of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), EASD, ATTD, etc.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_877786], particularly within the fields of diabetes and 
endocrinology.

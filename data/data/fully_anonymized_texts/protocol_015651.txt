STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  A randomised , double -blind,  double -dummy,  parallel -group, multiple -
dose, active and placebo -controlled  efficacy  study of ibuprofen 
prolonged -release tablets for the treatment of pain after surgical 
removal of impacted third molars  
RB Study 
Number:  5003601  
Background and 
Rationale:  Reckitt Benck iser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300 mg ibuprofen 
prolonged  release ( PR) tablet with Strides Shasun Ltd . The product 
has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs to have 
access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR 
formulation will reduce fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations and 
allow for a lower frequency of administration which is desirable in 
situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulati ons. As a result, the 
product would be more consumer friendly, require less dosing and 
improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the 
short -term symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain such as 
dysmenorrhea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain of non -serious 
arthritic conditions  and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen  300 mg PR tablets.  Two tablets to be taken every 12 hours 
when required for pain relief. No  more than 2 doses in 24 hours.  The 
maximum daily dose is 1200  mg and there is no proposed indication in 
the p aediatric population.  
 
Therefore, the purpose of the proposed study is to provide supporting 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_789975] E urope , 
Australia  and Russia . The decision to progress to an efficacy  clinical 
trial was determined on the basis o f successful outcomes of the 2  
phase  1 clinical trials (BE/17/279 and BE/17/281) in terms of 
bioavailability (BA) versus  a ref erence ibuprofen immediate  release 
(IR) product and bioequivalence (BE ) versus comparator 600  mg 
ibuprofen PR. 
Objectives :  Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the superiority of 2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  
compared with placebo in subjects experiencing acute

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088238] initial dose.  
Key Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the analgesic performance of a total daily dose of 
1200  mg of ibuprofen PR formulation compared to ibuprofen  
immediate release ( IR) formulation over [ADDRESS_1088239] initial 
dose.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2×300 mg ibuprofen 
PR tablets . 
Additional Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the total analgesic  effect, peak analgesic effect,  
onset and duration of action and the subject’s overall 
assessment of the study  medication s. 
Design: This is  a single centre , randomised , double -blind,  double -dummy,  
parallel group, multiple -dose, active and placebo -controlled efficacy 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2×[ADDRESS_1088240]-surgical  dental pain.  
Primary 
Endpoint:  The Summed P ain Intensity Difference (SPID) over  0 to 12 hours 
(SPID12) will be used to compare the test product ( 2×300 mg ibuprofen 
PR tablets ) against the placebo product.  
Confirmatory 
Evaluation : Clinically relevant difference between placebo and PR ibuprofen over 
12 hours after initial dose  (for the purposes of this study, a  difference 
of 30 % in PID scores over 12 hours after initial dose  will be considered 
clinically relevant ).(1)  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  Key secondary efficacy endpoint: 
 The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 
24 hours (SPID24) will be used to compare the test product 
(2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  twice daily [ BID]) and active 
comparator product ( 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR tablets three times 
a day  [TID]). 
Efficacy endpoints : 
 Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 4 hours 
(SPID4), over 0  to 8 hours (SPID8), and over 0  to 12  hours 
(SPID12) after Time  0 
 Sum of total pain relief (TOTPAR) over 0  to 4 hours 
(TOTPAR4), over 0  to 8 hours (TOTPAR8), over 0 to 12  hours 
(TOTPA R12), and over 0 to 24 hours (TOTPAR24) after Time  0 
 Summed pain relief and intensity difference (sum of TOTPAR 
and SPID [SPRID]) over 0  to 4 hours (SPRID4), over 0  to 
8 hours (SPRID8), over 0  to 12  hours (SPRID12), and over 0  to 
24 hours (SPRID24) after T ime 0

study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088244] be 
ipsilateral.  
All subjects will receive local anaes thesia  (2% lidocaine with 
1:100,000  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Nitrous oxide will be allowed at the discretion 
of the investigator. Subjects who experience moderate to severe pain 
intensity (a score of ≥  5 on a numeric rating scale [NRS] from 0 -10 
where 0 = no pain, 10  = worst pain ever) within 6  hours after surgery 
and who continue to meet all study entry criteria will be randomis ed in 
a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets  every 12  hours 
(Q12h ), 2×200  mg ibuprofen IR tablets every 8 hours ( Q8h), or 
placebo. The randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_790000] 
(moderate or severe) using a categorical scale that includes the 
categories of none  (0), mild (1 -4), moderate ( 5-7), and severe  (8-10).  
Subjects will re -assess their baseline pai n intensity using the NRS 
immediately before receiving study drug (pre -dose, Time  0) and their 
pain intensity (NRS) and pain relief (5 -point categorical scale) at the 
following time points (pre -dose, if at one of the dosing timepoint s of 0,

dose of rescue medication (whichever  occurs first). Vita l signs will be 
recorded after the subject has been in a sitting position for 3 minutes 
at the following times: before surgery, within 30 minutes before Time  0, 
12 and 24 hours after Time  0, and/or immediately before the first dose 
of rescue medication. Ad verse events (A Es) will be monitored and 
recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent form ( ICF) 
until the Follow  up- Visit (or Early Termination Visit). During the 
24 hours following Time  0, subjects will complete efficacy and safety 
assessme nts. Subjects will remain at the study site overnight and will 
be discharged on Day  2.  
Paracetamol / acetaminophen (1000  mg) will be permitted as the initial 
rescue medication. Subjects will be encouraged to wait at least 
[ADDRESS_1088248]’s pain, 5  mg oxycodone rescue medication may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects are not permitted to take any concomitant medications that 
might confound assessments of pain relief, such as psychotropic 
drugs, antidepressants, sedative -hypnotics (other than those permitted 
for conscious sedation), or other analgesics taken within five times of 
their eliminatio n half -lives (other than those used at the surgery) . 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and 
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are permitted if the subject 
has been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to Visit 1  
(screening) .  
Other restrictions include the following: alcohol use is prohibited from 
24 hours before surgery until discharge on Day  2; nothing by [CONTACT_790001] 1  hour after surgery; clear liquids 
only are allowed starting 1  hour after surgery until 1  hour after dosing; 
[ADDRESS_1088249]’s diet may be advanced ac cording to 
standard practice.  
Upon discharge from the study site, subjects may be prescribed pain 
medication for use at home according to the standard pra ctice of the 
study site. On Day  8 (± 2 days), subjects will return to the study site for 
an abbreviated confirmatory physical assessment and AE 
assessments.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects 
who are treated with study drug and who have at least 1  pain 
relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT population is the 
primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per  protocol - (PP) popula tion will consist of all ITT subjects 
who do not incur a major protocol violation that would challenge 
the validity of their data. This population will be utilized to 
evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will inc lude all subjects who are treated 
with study drug. The safety population is the population for all 
safety assessments.  
Subject Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date of birth , sex, 
race, w eight, height, BMI  and medical his tory) will be summarized for 
each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive 
statistics. No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal 
to SPID12 for ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR tablets. The primary analysis 
will be an AN COVA (Analysis of Covariance) model  that includes the 
main effect of treatment and the baseline pain score as a covariate  and 
will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
imputation for subjects who use rescue medication.  The primary 
analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088250] at the significance level of 0.05.  
All o ther comparisons between the treatment regime ns, including 
ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR tablets versus placebo, will be considered 
secondary. No P  value adjustment will be made for multiple endpoints 
or multiple comparisons.  
Each efficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6490].  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, 
SPID at each scheduled time point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, 
TOTPAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, SPID8, SPID24, 
SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics 
(such as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided  for each treatment regimen. Nominal P  values from 
ANCOVA models  comparing the placebo group with other treatment 
groups , including terms for treatment and baseline pain  will be 
provided  for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables , but no formal 
statistical inferences will be drawn on the basis of these tests.  
For ordinal secondary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at 
each scheduled time point, pain relief at each scheduled time point,

peak pain relief, response to study drug, and global evaluation  of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the 
number and percentage of subjects within each category for each 
treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact tests (or 
chi-square - tests, as appropriate) comparing the pla cebo group with 
other treatment groups will be provided  for peak pain relief  and global 
evaluation of study drug , but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  For each time  to- event endpoint, 
Kaplan  Meier methodology wil l be used to evaluate the treatment 
effect. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible 
pain relief confirmed by [CONTACT_88965])  will be based on data 
collected using the double stopwatch  method. Time to onset of 
analgesia will be -right censored - at [ADDRESS_1088251] will be the ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR grou p 
versus the ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table s will 
provide the number of subjects analy sed, the number of subjects 
censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the estimated median and the restricted mean est imate. 
P values from the Wilcoxon or log  rank- tests (as appropriate) will also 
be used to compare placebo to the active treatments . 
For the responder analysis and the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication,  logistic regression model s that adjust  for baseline intensity 
and/or significant demographic variables, if appropriate , will be used to 
evaluate the treatment effect.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before 
dosing with a study drug.  
Missing pain assessments for all ef ficacy analyses will be handled as 
follows:  
 Missing pain assessments  scheduled before the first observed 
assessment will be imputed with the subject’s worst observed 
pain assessment . 
 Missing intermediate pain assessment s will be replaced by 
[CONTACT_790002].  
 Missing pain assessment s at the end of the observation period 
due to premature discontinuation of pain assessments will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_790003].  
The primary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried 
forward (WOCF)  methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. 
Any pain measurements taken during a period of time in which rescue

assessments impacted by [CONTACT_790006]/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789976] (DRM) prior to database lock 
and study un blinding.   A sensitivity analysis will also be performed, in 
which all pain assessments recorded after the first dose of rescue 
medication has been taken will be disregarded and the rules outl ined 
above will be used for missing data.  
All data for assessmen ts other than pain assessments will be analysed 
as collected; missing data due to premature termination or any other 
reason will be left as missing . Additional sensitivity analyses including 
use of rescue medication will be detailed in the Statistical Anal ysis 
Plan.  
Safety Analysis  
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Version  19.0 
or higher) will be used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ 
class and preferred term. Adverse event summaries will include only 
TEAEs, which will be  summarized for each treatment group.  
For vital sign measurements, descriptive statistics will be provided at 
each scheduled time point for each treatment group. Changes from 
Baseline for vital signs will be calculated for each subject, and 
descriptive st atistics will be provided on changes in vital signs from 
Baseline for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after 
Baseline. No formal statistical tests will be performed.

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background for the Study and Rationale  
Recki tt Benckiser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300  mg ibuprofen prolonged  release ( PR) tablet 
with Strides Shasun Ltd. The product has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs 
to have access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR formulat ion will reduce 
fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations  and allow for a lower frequency of administration 
which is desirable in situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulations. As a  result, the product would be more 
consumer friendly, require less dosing and improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the short -term symptomatic 
treatment of mild to moderate pain such as dysmenorrh ea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain 
of non -serious arthritic conditions and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088253] 
in addition to the data obtained in two bioequivalence studies BE/17/279 and BE/17/[ADDRESS_1088254]  
Ibuprofen [2 -(4-isobutylphenyl) propi[INVESTIGATOR_149046]] is a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) with anti -inflammatory, analgesic and anti -pyretic properties (2). It was initially available 
in 1969 as a prescription only medicine,  indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and 
other chronic painful conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis. Following further research and 
the establishment of a reassuring safety profile, it was launched in 1983 as an over -the-counter 
(OTC) m edication, marketed as Nurofen®. 
Absorption of ibuprofen after oral administration is fairly rapid with peak serum concentrations 
occurring within  1 to 2 hours after administration. Ibuprofen is extensively bound to plasma 
proteins (99%) when administered at therapeutic levels and has a plasma half -life of about 
2 hours. Excretion by [CONTACT_790007], but only a small proportion of drug 
is excreted unchanged in urine, the majority being extensively metabolised in the liver to 
2 major in active metabolites. The pharmacokinetics  of ibuprofen has been extensively 
reviewed by [CONTACT_790008] (3).

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088255] in the study : 
 Treatment A: test product, 2x300  mg PR ibuprofen tablet, twice daily [total daily dose 
1200  mg] 
 Treatment B: reference produc t, 2x200  mg IR ibuprofen tablet, three times a day [total 
daily dose 1200  mg] 
 Treatment C: matching placeb o tablets for both the test and reference regimens  
 
The active comparator (Treatment B)  currently marketed in a number of geographies including 
a numb er of different  European countries.   It has therefore been chosen to fulfil requirements  
that when it is included in a marketing authorisation dossier as a comparator that it is licenced 
within the EU.      
 
1.4 Study Population and Indication  
The following study population will be invited to participate in this clinical trial:  
Adult participants aged [ADDRESS_1088256] be a fully or partially bone -impacted mandibular molar , (if only [ADDRESS_1088257] be ipsilateral ), and who experience moderate to severe pain following 
surgery . 
Such population is expected to present pain levels that will allow for assessing the magnitude 
of treatment effect in a low variability setting.  
 
1.5 Non-Clinical Evidence  
No non -clinical evidence is available for the PR tablet.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
1.6 Clinical Evidence to Date  
A total of 5 single and multiple -dose pharmacokinetic studies  (139-15, BE -16-081, BE -16-295, 
BE-17-279, BE -17-281) have been performed with the test product .  These studies 
demonstrate d the oral bioavailability (BA) of the ibuprofen  PR tablets (dosed at 2x300  mg) is 
comparable to  Brufen® (Ibuprofen) IR Tablets  (dosed at 3x200  mg) after a single dose and at 
steady state conditions.  In terms of the release pro file and absorption , Cmax tends to be  slightly  
higher in the IR formulation when compared with the PR formulation [21.96 ±3.87 µg/mL vs 
14.51 ±3.1 µg/mL] .  However the C max, (Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration ), Tmax, 
(Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration ) and AUC 0-Tmax (Area Under the Plasma 
Concentration Curve ) of the PR formulation suggest that’s the onset of action should not be 
any slower than the IR reference when  considering the minimum effective concentration of 
ibuprofen (4).  In term s of total exposure (AUC 0-∞) the concentration profile is bioequivalent  
between the PR test product and the IR reference product [163.41 ±43.0 µg.h/mL vs 168.59 
±37.7 µg.h/mL].   A food effect is demonstrated when the test product is taken in the fed state,  
with an expected increase  in the absorption rate.  
In the 5 PK studies performed (over 200 subjects ) only a limited number of mild, transient 
adverse events were reported.    
Summary  Outcomes:  
 The Clinical data available for this reformulation (Ibuprofen 30 0 mg PR) suggests an 
adequate  pharmacokinetic  profile  to achieve a sufficient therapeutic effect  in the 
proposed study  
 There are n o safety concerns with the test product  
 Ibuprofen 300  mg PR had an increased rate of absorption when administered with food.  
 Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088258] and was bioequivalent based on AUC 0-∞ 
 
1.7 Risks / Benefits  
This study has been designed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088259] 
will undergo a full health check as part of the enrolment into the study to confirm that they 
are healthy as defined in this protocol (see Section  4). 
Participants randomised into the placebo arm would not be expected to derive  any therapeutic 
benefit from the admin istration  of the placebo tablets. The placebo arm is essential to the study 
DocuSign Envelope ID: E5C8FB9A-6542-4088-90A8-75E3998F3A16Page 25 of 276

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
design as it ensures that any conclusion of non -inferiority from th e trial is a reflection of the 
true properties of the treatments ; that is,  it demonstrates  the assay s ensitivity of the study.  
However, this obviously leaves the participants without adequate analgesia in the post -surgery  
procedure and from an ethical perspective this is mitigated in the study design by [CONTACT_790009]. Although it is hypothesised 
that the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) will provide adequate analgesia in the study , 
this cannot be guaranteed , and therefore the use of rescue medication also addresses  the 
potential of reduced or lack of efficacy.  
Ibuprofen is an established pharmaceutical ingredient and the adverse reactions associated 
with administration of 1200  mg/24  hour (OTC doses) are well known and documented (2)(5).  
The adverse reactions most frequently occurring with a single dose being nausea, 
gastrointestinal upset, vomiting, diarrhoea, light headedness, dizziness and headache. Rarely, 
more serious reactions have been reported including GI bleeding, ulceration and p erforations, 
hypertension and renal failure. When OTC doses of ibuprofen (200 -400 mg/dose; 1200  
mg/day) are taken for acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_789977] (5).  
The specific 200mg Ibuprofen tablet  to be used in this study as the active comparator 
(Treatment B) is marketed in the EU under the Nurofen brand and has  an excellent safety 
profile.   
It is not anticipated that the safety profile of ibuprofen will be altered after administration of 
multiple single doses of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088260] 6 days is dee med to be  sufficient 
prior to the Follow -up/Early Termination Visit to ensure adequate safety monitoring of the IMP.  
The investigation site will have adequate set up, experience and safety measures that would 
be expected of a centre able to perform regular  molar extractions. They will also have adequate 
experience in the safety monitoring of participant s post dose that would be expected in a 
clinical trial  setting.  Therefore, it is considered that the risk related to study procedures are low 
and limited to  common adverse events (AEs) related to the dental procedure, administration 
of routine anaesthetics, and discomfort from vital sign  measurements.   Any subject that 
experiences immediate complications during the surgery will be excluded from the study.  
Therefore, the overall benefit -risk profile for the use of the investigational product as 
defined in this protocol is considered favourable.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the superiority of  2×[ADDRESS_1088262] initial dose.  
Key Secondary Objectives:  
 To evaluate the analgesic performance  of a total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1088263] initial dose.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets.  
Additional Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the total analgesic effect, peak analgesic effect,  onset and duration of action 
and the subject’s overall assessment of the study  medication s. 
3 STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE FOR DESIGN  
This is a single centre  randomi sed, double -blind,  double dummy,  parallel group, multiple -dose, 
active and placebo -controlled efficacy study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2×[ADDRESS_1088264] -surgical pain 
model that produces pain that is predictable in its character, duration, and intensity(6). The 
model is widely accepted and has a proven record of assay sensitivity (i.e. separating active 
drugs from each other, as well as from placebo). The model is frequently used to evaluate 
NSAID type analgesics. Results from dental pain studies are accepted by [CONTACT_3361] ( FDA) and European authorities and have been widely extrapolated to 
other general pain conditions.  
The decision to conduct the study in the United Sta tes was taken as suitably qualified and 
experienced test sites could not be found in Europe .  The specific test site ha s been chosen 
to conduct the study as they have a  proven history of quality and safety  when conducting  
studies  of this type . 
The placebo products have two purposes:  
1. To mask the treatment identify for PR and IR arms  
2. Act as a control arm  
The dose of the test product is the proposed posology of the final product and the dose of the 
active comparator is the posology provided  in the label of the product.  
Eligible subjects will be randomis ed in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets

Table 3-1 Study Objectives and Endpoints  
Objectives Endpoints  
Primary Objective : 
To evaluate the superiority of 2×[ADDRESS_1088266] initial dose.  Primary Endpoint:   
The primary efficacy endpoint is the summed 
pain intensity difference (SPID) over the 0 to 
12 hours ( SPID12) after Time [ADDRESS_1088267] (2x300  mg 
PR ibuprofen) and the placebo product.   
The clinical relevance of the difference 
between placebo  and PR ibuprofen over 
12 hours after initial dose will be evaluated 
as confirmatory  evidence  (for the purposes 
of this study, a difference of 30% in PID 
scores over 12  hours after initial dose  will be 
considered clinically relevant) . 
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
 To evaluate the analgesic performance 
of a total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1088268] initial dose.   
 To evaluate the total analgesic effect, 
peak analgesic effect, onset and duration Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
 The summed pain intensity difference 
(SPID) over 0  to 24  hours (SPID24) will 
be used to compare the test product 
(2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets twice 
daily [BID]) and comparator product 
(2×200  mg ibuprofen IR tablets three 
times a day [TID]).

partner should be the sole partner for that subject]  
h. True abstinence which is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation 
methods; declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial; and withdrawal  are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  
4.5 Discontinuation / Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects  
The Investigator may withdraw the subject from the study at any time. Reasons for removing 
a subject from the study include, but are not limited to:  
 AEs that in the judgement of the Investigator may cause severe or permanent harm 
(significant clinical deterioration is an AE)  
 Violation of the study protocol  
 In the Investigator’s judgement, it is in the subject’s best interest  
 Subject declines further study parti cipation  
 If applicable, randomisation code is broken  
If subjects choose to prematurely stop the study prior to the scheduled discharge at Hour 24, 
safety and tolerability assessments must be performed prior to discharge, and, if possible, 
efficacy assessme nts should be performed.  
If subjects choose to prematurely stop the study  after clinic discharge but prior to the follow -up 
visit, at least [ADDRESS_1088277] the subjects for follow -up 
assessments which will include the assess ments described for the follow -up visit (Section  7.4).

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088287]’s participation in the 
study (last assessment) will be recorded on the concomitant medication page in the eCRF.  
Upon discharge from the study site, subjects may be prescribed pain medication for use at 
home according to the standard practice of th e study site.  
5.[ADDRESS_1088288] possible compliance with study requirements.  Any non -compliance during 
the study will be observed and recorded by [CONTACT_790015] a protocol deviation . 
5.5 Packaging and Labelling and Supp ly / Resupply  
For each subject one pack  will be provided containing all  required tablets for each dosing 
timepoint.   Each tablet will be held in a blister within the pack.  The pack will clearly show which 
tablets are to be taken at which timepoint.  
All packs regardless of treatment regimen will be the same except for a kit number  and will 
therefore not identify the treatment . 
The IMP will be labelled in accordance with EudraLex Volume 4 Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP) Guidelines, Annex 13 - Manufacture of Investigational Medicinal Products, parts 26 to 
33 (Labelling) and in accordance with directive 2003/94/EC as amended and including any 
other applicable national/state legislation. The IMP will be labelled  in English  
All IMP will be packed and labelled to GMP by [CONTACT_790016] 
(IMSU), Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare ([LOCATION_006]) Ltd, Dansom Lane, Hull, HU8 7DS, [LOCATION_006]. IMP will 
be shipped from the IMSU to the study site.  
5.6 Storage Conditions  
The Investigator or designated individual will keep all IMP(s) in a pharmacy or a secure storage 
facility, accessible only to those individuals authorised by [CONTACT_790017].  
The Investigator or designated individual will maintain an inventory. This will include the 
description a nd quantity of IMP(s) received during the course of this study, as well as a record 
of the materials that are dispensed and returned (how much, to whom  and when). This 
inventory (“ Drug  Dispensing Log”) will be subject to  review by [CONTACT_790018].  
The Investigator agrees not to supply IMP(s) to any person except study personnel and 
patient s enrolled in this study.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
The IMP should be stored between 8 -25 °C and is not to be refrigerated or frozen.  
Temperatures must be constantly moni tored and readings logged in a temperature log on 
working days.  
The temperature in the secure storage facility will be recorded using a minimum /maximum 
thermometer . If the temperature falls outside the specified range of 8 -25 °C, the Sponsor 
should be notified immediately and appropriate action should be agreed and documented. The 
temperature log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_216590] .  
5.7 Blinding  
This study is a double -blind, double dummy study.   There will be two placebo tablets designed 
to be comparable to each of the active products (PR and IR) in both shape, size, colour and 
weight.  
All subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1088289]’s 
treatment assignment.  
For emergency unblinding , study personnel will use the IWRS. If treatment assignment is 
unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of that subject’s treatment 
assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the remaining subjects in the 
study. Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a subject’s treatment 
assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The 
investigator should make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.  
5.9 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator will keep all study medication (including rescue medication) in a pharmacy or 
a secure storage facility, accessible only to those individuals authorised by [CONTACT_790019].

 For female subjects of childbearing potential, a blood sample for the serum pregnancy 
test will be collected at Screening and a urine pregnancy test sample will be collected 
before surgery on Day  1. 
Blood and urine samples for hematology, s erum chemistry, and urinalysis will be prepared 
using standard procedures and will be sent to a central laboratory for analyses.  
6.[ADDRESS_1088295] has been in a sitting position for 3 minutes. Vital 
sign assessments will include blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature. C linically significant abnormalities in vital signs should be recorded  as AE s. 
6.10 Blood Sampling  
Blood sampling will be performed according to the site’s standard practices, as described in 
the study manual or other site documentation.  
6.11 Oral Radiography  
Oral radiographs (X -rays) will be taken at Screening (radi ographs taken within 1  year before 
Screening will be acceptable and do not need to be repeated).  
6.12 Pain Intensity  
Subjects will rate their pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 -10 where 0  = no 
pain and 10 = worst pain ever  at the timepoin ts mentioned on  Table [ADDRESS_1088296] will be instructed, “Stop the first stopwatch when you first 
feel any pain reli ef whatsoever. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you 
might, but when you first feel any relief in the pain you have now” (perceptible pain relief). The 
subject will also be instructed, “Stop the second stopwatch when you feel the pain  relief is 
meaningful to you” (meaningful pain relief). If the subject does not press the stopwatches within 
[ADDRESS_1088297] will discontinue use of the stopwatches.  
6.14 Pain Relief Scale  
Subjects will rate their pain relief relative to Time 0 using a 5 -point categorical scale. Subjects 
will be asked “How much relief have you had since your starting pain?” with response choices 
of none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, and complete = 4. At each assessment time point, 
the pain intensity N RS assessment will be completed first and the pain relief assessment will

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088298]’s Global Evaluation of Study Drug  
For the global evaluation of study drug, the subject will be asked “How effective do you think 
the study drug is as a treatment for pain?” with response choices of 0  = poor, 1  = fair, 2  = good, 
3 = very good, or 4  = excellent. Subjects will complete the global evaluation of study drug

occurs first).  
6.[ADDRESS_1088300]: “Are you experiencing any symptoms or 
complaints?” at the baseline visit, and “Have  you had any symptoms or complaints since the 
last time you were asked?” during the study. In addition, spontaneously reported AEs are 
collected.  
The observation period for an individual subject will start after giving informed consent and will 
finish at t he last visit (follow -up visit) for the given individual subject. A ll AEs that arise during 
the observation period will be recorded and an assessment of the AE will be performed as per 
Section  8.[ADDRESS_1088301] has signed the consent form but 
before administration of the IMP, it  should be reported as an adverse event, including those 
associated with study procedures.  
Note this does not include any pre -existing medical conditions or findings associated with 
medical history which are identified during the screening process.

8 SAFETY REPORTING  
8.1 Adverse Event Defini tions 
An Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse e vent (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a clinical 
investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship w ith  this treatment . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigation al) product. [ICH E6 1.2].   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening  
 requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789981] 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or  
 is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect  
In addition, important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but may jeopardise t he patient or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above should also usually be considered serious.  
[ICH E2A] Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: If the event is related to the investigational product and is both serious and unexpected, 
it is classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R ). In case of 
double -blinded studies, unblinding is needed in order to determine a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
8.[ADDRESS_1088314]’s source documents and electronic case report forms ( eCRFs). 
Untoward medical occurrences  can be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_790022] -leading questioning or observation by [CONTACT_790023] a significant laborator y 
abnormality.

events (SAEs) are collected, fully investigated and documented.  
As the study will b e conducted on subjects who have been  through removal of impacted third 
molars, it is expected that they will present post -surgical symptoms , for example: swelling  and 
bruising. For the purpose s of this study, when at normal/expected magnitude, such 
occurrences will not be reported as AEs as they are expected and, therefore, are not 
“untoward” as in the AE standard definition.  
SAEs should be followed until resolution or stabilisation. Participants with ongoing SAEs at 
study termination will be further followed up until recovery or until stabil isation of the disease 
after termination.  
For each AE a causality assessment of the event to the study drug must be performed. The 
relationship to IMP must be determined by [CONTACT_737] (if medically qualified) or by a 
medically qualified Co -Investigat or.

All AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_790026] -to-date version of MedDRA.  
8.3 Reporting of Adverse Events  
In the event of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), the Investigator must report the event using 
the SAE form to the Sponsor Global Vigilance Group (GVG), by [CONTACT_790027]:

8.5 Overdose, Abuse, Misuse and Medication Errors  
The Spons or defines “overdose” as the administration of a quantity of an investigational IMP 
given per administration or cumulatively, which is above the maximum recommended dose 
according to the authorised product information.  
The Sponsor defines “abuse” as the pe rsistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of an 
IMP, which is intended to produce harmful physical or psychological effects e.g. intentional 
overdose to experience psychological effects.  
The Sponsor defines “misuse” as situations where the IMP is int entionally and inappropriately 
used not in accordance with the authorised product information.  
Overdoses, abuse, misuse are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an 
associated AE / SAE. The overdose, abuse, misuse and any associated AE / SAE will be 
captured on an AE CRF (Case Report Form) page / SAE form.  
Due t o the full inpatient nature of this study,  in which medication doses will be supervised by 
[CONTACT_6624], cases of overdose, abuse or misuse are not expected to occur.  
Medication errors are any unintentional errors in dispensing or administration of the IMP which 
relates to:  
 Taking / being administered an incorrect IMP  
 Taking / being administered a drug by [CONTACT_790029] e.g. swallowing 
a suppository  
 The accident al administration of the IMP to a person who is not a subject within the 
study  
Medication errors are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an associated 
AE / SAE. Medication errors with or without an associated AE / SAE will be captured  on the 
AE CRF page / SAE form.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section presents  a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan 
(SAP)  that describe s the details of the analyses to be conducted  will be written  prior to 
database lock.  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will typi[INVESTIGATOR_149176], mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, summary  
statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_88917].  All data 
will be presented in listings.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before dosing with study drug.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size determination is based on the primary efficacy variable, SPID12. According 
to Farrar 2001(1), a clinically important  improvement  in pain is represented by a 2 point  
reduction  on an 11 -point NRS. Based on a baseline pain score of 7 this corresponds to an 
approximate 30% reduction in pain. An average 2 point difference in pain scores between 
Ibuprofen PR and placebo  across all 14 assessments up to 12 hours  will correspond to a 
difference in SPID12 of 24 points. In a previous study (7), the pooled standard deviation (SD) 
for SPID12 was 31.65. Assuming the same variability in this study, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1088321] >90% power to detect a difference of 24 points in SPID12, between 
ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088322] differences between PR and IR, and 
to obtain a more precise estimate for this comparison, a 3:3:1 allocation ratio will be used, so 
that 120 subjects are randomised into each of the PR and IR groups.  Thus 280 subjects will 
be enroll ed into the study. 
9.2 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis  is planned .  
9.3 Analysis Datasets  
The analysis populations include the following:

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are treated with 
study drug and who have at least 1  pain relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT 
population is the primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of al l ITT subjects who do not incur a 
major protocol violation that would challenge the validity of their data. This population 
will be utilized to evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will include all subjects who a re treated with study drug. The 
safety population is the population for all safety assessments.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1088323] Disposition and Characteristics  
The numbers of subjects randomised, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated o verall and by [CONTACT_1570]. The number of subjects in each 
analysis population will be reported.  Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date 
of birth , sex, race, weight, height, BMI, medical history, and surgery duration) will be 
summarized  for each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive statistics. 
No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
9.[ADDRESS_1088324] is between PR ibuprofen and placebo. In addition, the 
comparison b etween IR ibuprofen and placebo will be presented with p -values to demonstrate 
study sensitivity. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be used to evaluate the 
clinical relevance of any differences between the PR and IR formulations. All treatm ent 
differences will be presented with 95% confidence intervals.  No P value adjustment will be 
made for multiple endpoints or multiple comparisons.  In the event of model assumptions for 
normality being violated, non -parametric methods will be used.  
Each ef ficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570] . 
 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint, summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0 to 12 hours (SPID12) , 
will be used to compare the test product (2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets) against the placebo 
product . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal to SPID12 for ibuprofen 
2×[ADDRESS_1088325] (WOCF) imputation for subjects who use rescue medication. The 
primary analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088326] at the significance level of 0.05.

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analysis  
The clinical relevance of the  difference between placebo and PR ibuprofen over 12  hours after 
initial dose will be evaluated . 
 Secondary Endpoints  
 The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 24  hours (SPID24) will be 
used to compare the t est product (2× 300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  twice daily [BID]) 
and comparator product (2×2 00 mg ibuprofen IR tablets three times a day [TID]).  
 Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 4 hours (SPID4), over 0  to 8 hours 
(SPID8), and over 0  to 12  hours (SPID12) after Time  0 
 Sum of total pain relief (TOTPAR) over 0  to 4 hours (TOTPAR4), over 0  to 8 hours 
(TOTPAR8), over 0 to 12  hours (TOTPAR12), and over 0 to 24 hours (TOTPAR24) 
after Time  0 
 Summed pain relief and intensity difference (sum of TOTPAR an d SPID [SPRID]) 
over 0  to 4 hours (SPRID4), over 0  to 8 hours (SPRID8), over 0  to 12  hours 
(SPRID12), and over 0  to 24  hours (SPRID24) after Time  0 
 Response to study drug ( a responder will be defined as a subject with ≥30% 
improvement in pain intensity without rescue medication  during the first 8 hours ) 
 Numeric rating scale  (NRS) pain intensity difference (PID) at each scheduled time 
point after Time  0 
 Pain intensity score at each scheduled time point  
 Pain relief score at each scheduled time point after Time  0 
 Peak pain relief  
 Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible pain relief confirmed by 
[CONTACT_789999]) using double stopwatch  
 Time to first perceptible pain relief  
 Time to meaningful pain relief  
 Time to peak pain relief  
 Proportion of subjects using rescue medication  
 Time to first use of rescue medication   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, SPID at each scheduled 
time point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, TOT PAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, 
SPID8, SPID24, SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics (such as 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for each 
treatment regimen. P values from ANCOVA models comparing  the placebo group with other 
treatment groups, including terms for treatment and a covariate for baseline pain  will be 
provided for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables, but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  In the e vent that normality assumptions are violated for a 
parameter, non -parametric analysis methods will be used.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
For ordinal secondary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at each scheduled time 
point, pain relief at each scheduled time point, peak pai n relief, and global evaluation of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the number and percentage of 
subjects within each category for each treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact 
tests (or chi -square tests, as appropriate) comparing the placebo group with other treatment 
groups will be provided  for peak pain relief  and global evaluation of study drug , but no formal 
statistical inferences will be drawn on the basis of these tests.  
For each time -to-event endpoint,  Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to evaluate the 
treatment effect. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible pain relief 
confirmed by [CONTACT_88965]) will be based on data collected using the double stopwatch 
method. Time to  onset of analgesia will be right -censored at 8  hours for subjects who do not 
experience both perceptible pain relief and meaningful pain relief during the 8 -hour interval 
after Time  0. The summary table s will provide the number of subjects analysed, the n umber of 
subjects censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
estimated median and the restricted mean estimate. P  values comparing placebo to active 
treatment from Wilcoxon or log -rank tests (as appropriate) will also  be used to examine 
treatment effect.  
For time to onset of analgesia, the comparison of interest will be the ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR 
group versus the ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table for this comparison will 
provide the number of subjects analy sed, the number of subjects censored, estimates for the 
quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimated median and the restricted mean 
estimate.  
For the proportion of subjects who are responders and the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication, logistic regression model s that adjust for baseline intensity and/or significant 
demographic variables, if appropriate, will be used to evaluate the treatment effect .   
For the responder analysis , subjects will be censored at 8 hours and for th e use of rescue 
medication /time to first rescue  subjects will be censored at 24 hours.  
9.6 Safety Analyses  
 Safety Endpoint(s)  
 Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
 Incidence of  changes in vital sign measurements  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoint Analyses  
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Version  19.0 or higher) will be used to classify all AEs with 
respect to system organ class and preferred term. Adverse event summaries  will include only 
TEAEs, which will be summarized for each treatment group.

for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after Baseline. No formal statistical tests 
will be performed.  
9.7 Handling of Missing Data a nd Drop -outs 
Missing pain assessments for all efficacy analyses will be handled as follows:  
 Missing pain assessments scheduled before the first observed assessment will be 
imputed with the subject’s worst observed pain assessment.  
 Missing intermediate pain  assessments will be replaced by [CONTACT_229091].  
 Missing pain assessments at the end of the observation period due to premature 
discontinuation of pain assessments will be imputed by [CONTACT_790030].  
 
The p rimary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. Any pain measurements taken during a 
period of time in which rescue medication  (any intervention used by [CONTACT_790031])  is active (4 hours) will be replaced by [CONTACT_790032] [ADDRESS_1088328] observed score, it will not be replaced. The same approach 
will be used for the pain relief scores. Any other pain assessments impacted by [CONTACT_790033]/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_789983] u nblinding . A sensitivity analysis will also be 
performed, in which all pain assessments recorded after the first dose of rescue medication 
has been taken will be disregarded and the rules outlined above will be used for missing data.  
All data for assessmen ts other than pain assessments will be analysed as collected; missing 
data due to premature termination or any other reason will be l eft as missing . Additional 
sensitivity analyses including use of rescue medication will be detailed in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1088329] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
10.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
Data will be recorded in an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). For each enrolled study 
subject an eCRF is maintained. The Investigator or designees is  responsible for the quality of 
the data record in the eCRF. eCRFs must be kept current to reflect subject status at each

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088330]. The investigator and study monitor will identify 
the data that will be recorded directly on the eCRF and for this data the eCRF will be considered 
the source document (i.e ., no prior written or electronic record of the data). The study monitor 
will document this at the screening and it will also be documented in the Data Management 
Plan.  
Source documents will include notes taken at the site and will include data such as 
demographic data, participation in study and ICF, medical history, SAEs, AEs and  concomitant 
medication, results of examinations and assessments.  
Where source data are in the form of a computer print out (e.g. medical records, laboratory 
data) they will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_790034], confirming that 
the print out is a true and faithful record of the data for that subject. These print -outs will be 
filed in the study files.  
The Investigator agrees to provide direct access to source data for study -related monitoring, 
audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspec tion(s). Direct access to source data requires that the 
subject gives written, documented consent to this.  
10.3 Data Management  
The data management group at Premier Research will be responsible for data management 
and eCRF activities.  
Full details regarding da ta management will be described within the Data Management Plan.  
10.4 Reporting of Protocol Deviations  
Site staff should make the study monitor aware of any deviation from the protocol as soon as 
possible after occurrence. Waivers for inclusion / exclusion cri teria are not allowed.  
10.5 Retention of Essential Documentation  
The Investigator should retain all essential documents (as defined in ICH E6 or according to 
other national and international regulations) until at least 5 years after the completion of the 
study  (defined as  last subject last visit in the study ). These documents should be retained for

11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Monitoring  
The Sponsor will organise regular monitoring visits to be performed at intervals agreed with 
the Investigator. The anticipated monitoring frequency will be stated in the Monit oring Plan. 
Monitoring will also involve, as appropriate, correspondence and telephone contacts.  
On-site monitoring includes source data verification (SDV) which is the procedure whereby [CONTACT_790035]. It will be performed in such a way as to preserve subject confidentiality, taking 
into account all ethical and legislative requirements.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be av ailable at some 
time during the monitoring visit to review the data and resolve any queries and to allow direct 
access to the subject’s records for SDV).  
SDV will include as a minimum verification for all subjects, subject identity ( date of birth, sex, 
initials and subject number), record of entry into the study and signature [CONTACT_208318]. In addition, details of SAEs in the subject’s notes will be verified. Details included in 
the subject’s notes as a minimum:  
 Study number, brief description or  title of study  
 Date that the subject gave written consent  
 All visit dates  
 All SAEs  
 All concomitant medications  
At a site visit the eCRFs should be complete and available in order that the accuracy of their 
completion may be checked. Each completed eCRF fo r each subject must be signed 
electronically by [CONTACT_737], to verify the data and statements submitted. Similarly, all 
alterations on paper records must be initialled and dated by [CONTACT_29517] a designated 
person, explained as necessary, with  the original mistake left legible .

letter must contain:  
 Name [CONTACT_11277]. 
 Date of meeting.  
 Sufficient information to identify the version of the Protocol and subject 
information/informed consent.  
 Sufficient information to identify the version of other documents reviewed.  
The investigator must also provide the Sponsor with a list of IRB members that includes each 
member’s name [CONTACT_790071].  
Any amendments to the Protocol must be submitted to the IRB for approval unless where 
necessary to eliminate apparent immed iate hazards to study subjects, and any administrative 
changes must be notified.   
This study will be submitted to the applicable Regulatory Authorities. The study will only be 
undertaken when regulatory authorisation has been obtained by [CONTACT_1034] . 
The S ponsor will notify the Regulatory Authority within 90 days of the end of the study (within 
15 days if the study is terminated prematurely).

Premier Research will notify the IRB within 90 days of the end of the study (within 15  days if 
the study is terminat ed prematurely).  
12.[ADDRESS_1088334] Information and Consent  
Informed consent should be obtained by [CONTACT_3553] a patient information sheet  and ICF, 
prepared in accordance with ICH E6 (R2) section 4.8.[ADDRESS_1088335] can enter the study before his/her informed consent 
has been obtained.  A sample subject ICF used in the study will be included in the clinical study 
report for this protocol.   
As part of administering the informed consent document, the  Investigator must explain to each 
subject the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, 
the potential risks and benefits involved, and any potential discomfort.  Each subject must be 
informed that participation in t he study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the 
study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical 
treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  The subject should understand the study, 
patient  information sheet,  and ICF before signing and dating the ICF.  The Investigator or 
person obtaining consent must also sign and date the form.  Each subject will be given a copy 
of the signed informed con sent and written information.  
12.3 Early / Premature  Termination of the Study  
In the unlikely event that this study generates an excessive frequency of adverse events, 
subjects’ termination or suspension may be requested by [CONTACT_790037].  
The sponsor retains the right to term inate the study for non -safety reasons by [CONTACT_790038].  
Any decisions to terminate or suspend the study will be notified in writing to the Investigator or 
designees, the IRB, Regulatory Authority and the clinicaltrials.gov database.  
If the study is terminated early, study subjects who have attended screening will be informed 
that they are no longer required and if they have any questions, they should consult the study 
site staff . For subjects who have completed the study they will not be informed that the clinical 
study has been terminated. All data collected up to the point of study termination will be used 
in an abbreviated Clinical Investigation Report.

forward (WOCF) methodology for subjects who use rescue 
medication. Any pain measurements taken during a period of 
time in which rescue medication is active (4 hours) will be 
replaced by [CONTACT_941] l ast pain measurement before the rescue 
medication was taken. A sensitivity analysis will also be 
performed, in which all pain assessments recorded after the first 
dose of rescue medication has been taken will be disregard ed 
and the rules outlined above wil l be used for missing data.  
All data for assessments other than pain assessments will be 
analysed as collected; missing data due to premature termination 
or any other reason will be left as missing.

notable difference between treatment groups in the number of 
subjects using rescue medication, other sensitivity analyses may 
be performed. These will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis

analyses including use of rescue medication will be d etailed in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Reason for   
Changes (in 
green te xt): These changes are not intended to change or replace the analysis  
planned for this study . The method  for imputing data for  participants who  
had taken  rescu e medication  was correctly detailed  in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (V1. [ADDRESS_1088345] 2019 Section 6.1.5 Analysis Windows)  and the 
Evidence Brief ( Feb 2018  Statistical Methods, Efficacy Analysis  Sectio n), 
both of which state  “The primary analysis w ill use windowed worst 
observation carried forward (WOCF) methodology for subjects w ho use 
rescue med ication. ”  
However, in the protocol  the descript ion of the method for imputing data 
for participants who took rescue medication  was incorrectly detailed in  
these section s. Therefore, these amendment s have been made to correct 
these typograph ical errors aligning with the SAP, whilst also providing

Study Title:  A randomised , double -blind,  double -dummy,  parallel -group, multiple -
dose, active and placebo -controlled  efficacy  study of ibuprofen 
prolonged -release tablets for the treatment of pain after surgical 
removal of impacted third molars  
RB Study 
Number:  5003601  
Background and 
Rationale:  Reckitt Benck iser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300 mg ibuprofen 
prolonged  release ( PR) tablet with Strides Shasun Ltd . The product 
has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs to have 
access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR 
formulation will reduce fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations and 
allow for a lower frequency of administration which is desirable in 
situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulati ons. As a result, the 
product would be more consumer friendly, require less dosing and 
improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the 
short -term symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain such as 
dysmenorrhea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain of non -serious 
arthritic conditions  and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen  300 mg PR tablets.  Two tablets to be taken every 12 hours 
when required for pain relief. No  more than 2 doses in 24 hours.  The 
maximum daily dose is 1200  mg and there is no proposed indication in 
the p aediatric population.  
 
Therefore, the purpose of the proposed study is to provide supporting 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_789975] E urope , 
Australia  and Russia . The decision to progress to an efficacy  clinical 
trial was determined on the basis o f successful outcomes of the 2  
phase  1 clinical trials (BE/17/279 and BE/17/281) in terms of 
bioavailability (BA) versus  a ref erence ibuprofen immediate  release 
(IR) product and bioequivalence (BE ) versus comparator 600  mg 
ibuprofen PR. 
Objectives :  Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the superiority of 2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  
compared with placebo in subjects experiencing acute

 Treatment A: test product;  2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets , BID 
(total daily dose 1200  mg) 
 Treatment B: reference product; 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR 
tablet s, TID (total daily dose 1200  mg) 
 Treatment C: matching placebo tablets  
Methodology:  This is a single centre , randomi sed, double  blind, double -dummy, 
parallel  group -, multiple -dose, active  and placebo  controlled efficacy 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088372] be 
ipsilateral.  
All subjects will receive local anaes thesia  (2% lidocaine with 
1:100,000  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Nitrous oxide will be allowed at the discretion 
of the investigator. Subjects who experience moderate to severe pain 
intensity (a score of ≥  5 on a numeric rating scale [NRS] from 0 -10 
where 0 = no pain, 10  = worst pain ever) within 6  hours after surgery 
and who continue to meet all study entry criteria will be randomis ed in 
a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets  every 12  hours 
(Q12h ), 2×200  mg ibuprofen IR tablets every 8 hours ( Q8h), or 
placebo. The randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_790000] 
(moderate or severe) using a categorical scale that includes the 
categories of none  (0), mild (1 -4), moderate ( 5-7), and severe  (8-10).  
Subjects will re -assess their baseline pai n intensity using the NRS 
immediately before receiving study drug (pre -dose, Time  0) and their 
pain intensity (NRS) and pain relief (5 -point categorical scale) at the 
following time points (pre -dose, if at one of the dosing timepoint s of 0, 
8, 12 and/or 16 hours ): 15, 30, and 45  minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24  hours after Time  0; and immediately before

medication. Subjects will complete a global evaluation of study drug 
24 hours (+/- 5 minutes) after Time  [ADDRESS_1088375] 
dose of rescue medication (whichever  occurs first). Vita l signs will be 
recorded after the subject has been in a sitting position for 3 minutes 
at the following times: before surgery, within 30 minutes before Time  0, 
12 and 24 hours after Time  0, and/or immediately before the first dose 
of rescue medication. Ad verse events (A Es) will be monitored and 
recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent form ( ICF) 
until the Follow  up- Visit (or Early Termination Visit). During the 
24 hours following Time  0, subjects will complete efficacy and safety 
assessme nts. Subjects will remain at the study site overnight and will 
be discharged on Day  2.  
Paracetamol / acetaminophen (1000  mg) will be permitted as the initial 
rescue medication. Subjects will be encouraged to wait at least 
[ADDRESS_1088376]’s pain, 5  mg oxycodone rescue medication may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects are not permitted to take any concomitant medications that 
might confound assessments of pain relief, such as psychotropic 
drugs, antidepressants, sedative -hypnotics (other than those permitted 
for conscious sedation), or other analgesics taken within five times of 
their eliminatio n half -lives (other than those used at the surgery) . 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and 
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are permitted if the subject 
has been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to Visit 1  
(screening) .  
Other restrictions include the following: alcohol use is prohibited from 
24 hours before surgery until discharge on Day  2; nothing by [CONTACT_790001] 1  hour after surgery; clear liquids 
only are allowed starting 1  hour after surgery until 1  hour after dosing; 
[ADDRESS_1088377]’s diet may be advanced ac cording to 
standard practice.  
Upon discharge from the study site, subjects may be prescribed pain 
medication for use at home according to the standard pra ctice of the 
study site. On Day  8 (± 2 days), subjects will return to the study site for 
an abbreviated confirmatory physical assessment and AE 
assessments.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects 
who are treated with study drug and who have at least 1  pain 
relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT population is the 
primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per  protocol - (PP) popula tion will consist of all ITT subjects 
who do not incur a major protocol violation that would challenge 
the validity of their data. This population will be utilized to 
evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will inc lude all subjects who are treated 
with study drug. The safety population is the population for all 
safety assessments.  
Subject Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date of birth , sex, 
race, w eight, height, BMI  and medical his tory) will be summarized for 
each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive 
statistics. No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal 
to SPID12 for ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR tablets. The primary analysis 
will be an AN COVA (Analysis of Covariance) model  that includes the 
main effect of treatment and the baseline pain score as a covariate  and 
will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
imputation for subjects who use rescue medication.  The primary 
analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088378] at the significance level of 0.05.  
All o ther comparisons between the treatment regime ns, including 
ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR tablets versus placebo, will be considered 
secondary. No P  value adjustment will be made for multiple endpoints 
or multiple comparisons.  
Each efficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6490].  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, 
SPID at each scheduled time point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, 
TOTPAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, SPID8, SPID24, 
SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics 
(such as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided  for each treatment regimen. Nominal P  values from 
ANCOVA models  comparing the placebo group with other treatment 
groups , including terms for treatment and baseline pain  will be 
provided  for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables , but no formal 
statistical inferences will be drawn on the basis of these tests.  
For ordinal secondary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at 
each scheduled time point, pain relief at each scheduled time point,

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
peak pain relief, response to study  drug, and global evaluation of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the 
number and percentage of subjects within each category for each 
treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact tests (or 
chi-square - tests, as ap propriate) comparing the placebo group with 
other treatment groups will be provided  for peak pain relief  and global 
evaluation of study drug , but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  For each time  to- event endpoint, 
Kaplan  Meier methodology will be used to evaluate the treatment 
effect. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible 
pain relief confirmed by [CONTACT_88965])  will be based on data 
collected using the double stopwatch  method. Time to onset of 
analgesia will be -right censored - at [ADDRESS_1088379] will be th e ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR group 
versus the ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table s will 
provide the number of subjects analy sed, the number of subjects 
censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the estimated median  and the restricted mean estimate. 
P values from the Wilcoxon or log  rank- tests (as appropriate) will also 
be used to compare placebo to the active treatments . 
For the responder analysis and the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication,  logistic regression model s that adjust  for baseline intensity 
and/or significant demographic variables, if appropriate , will be used to 
evaluate the treatment effect.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before 
dosing with a study dr ug. 
Missing pain assessments for all efficacy analyses will be handled as 
follows:  
 Missing pain assessments  scheduled before the first observed 
assessment will be imputed with the subject’s worst observed 
pain assessment . 
 Missing intermediate pain assessme nts will be replaced by 
[CONTACT_229091].  
 Missing pain assessment s at the end of the observation period 
due to premature discontinuation of pain assessments will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_790003].  
The primary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried 
forward (WOCF)  methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. 
Any pain measurements taken during a period of time in which rescue

medication is active (4  hours) will be replaced by [CONTACT_941] l ast pain 
measurement before the rescue medication was taken. A sensitivity 
analysis will also be performed, in which all pain assessments 
recorded after the first dose of rescue medication has been taken will 
be disregarded and the rules outlined above wil l be used for missing 
data.  
All data for assessments other than pain assessments will be analysed 
as collected; missing data due to premature termination or any other 
reason will be left as missing.  
Safety Analysis  
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Version  19.0 
or higher) will be used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ 
class and preferred term. Adverse event summaries will include only 
TEAEs, whic h will be summarized for each treatment group.  
For vital sign measurements, descriptive statistics will be provided at 
each scheduled time point for each treatment group. Changes from 
Baseline for vital signs will be calculated for each subject, and 
descr iptive statistics will be provided on changes in vital signs from 
Baseline for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after 
Baseline. No formal statistical tests will be performed.

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background for the Study and Ration ale 
Reckitt Benckiser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300  mg ibuprofen prolonged  release ( PR) tablet 
with Strides Shasun Ltd. The product has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs 
to have access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR formulation will reduce 
fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations  and allow for a lower frequency of administration 
which is desirable in situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulations. As a result, the product would be more 
consumer friendly, require less dosing and improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the short -term symptomatic 
treatment of mild to moderate pain such as dysmenorrhea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain 
of non -serious arthritic conditions and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088380] 
in addition to the data obtained in two bioequivalence studies BE/17/279 and BE/17/[ADDRESS_1088381]  
Ibuprofen [2 -(4-isobutylphenyl) propi[INVESTIGATOR_149046]] is a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) with anti -inflammatory, analgesic and anti -pyretic properties (2). It was initially available 
in 1969 as a prescription only medicine, indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and 
other chronic painful conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis. Following further research and 
the establishment of a reassuring safety profile, it was launched in 1983 as an over -the-counte r 
(OTC) medication, marketed as Nurofen®. 
Absorption of ibuprofen after oral administration is fairly rapid with peak serum concentrations 
occurring within  1 to 2 hours after administration. Ibuprofen is extensively bound to plasma 
proteins (99%) when admi nistered at therapeutic levels and has a plasma half -life of about 
2 hours. Excretion by [CONTACT_790007], but only a small proportion of drug 
is excreted unchanged in urine, the majority being extensively metabolised in the liver to 
2 major inactive metabolites. The pharmacokinetics  of ibuprofen has been extensively 
reviewed by [CONTACT_790008] (3).

 Treatment A: test product, 2x300  mg PR ibuprofen tablet, twice daily [total daily dose 
1200  mg] 
 Treatment B: reference product, 2x200  mg IR ibuprofen tablet, three times a day [total 
daily dose 1200  mg] 
 Treatment C: matching placeb o tablets for both the test and reference regimens  
 
The active comparator (Treatment B)  currently marketed in a number of geographies including 
a number of  different  European countries.   It has therefore been chosen to fulfil requirements  
that when it is i ncluded in a marketing authorisation dossier as a comparator that it is licenced 
within the EU.      
 
1.4 Study Population and Indication  
The following study population will be invited to participate in this clinical trial:  
Adult participants aged [ADDRESS_1088383] be a fully or partially bone -impacted mandibular molar , (if only [ADDRESS_1088384] be ipsilateral ), and who experience moderate to severe pain following 
surgery . 
Such population is expected to present pain levels that will allow for assessing the magnitude 
of treatment effect in a low variability setting.  
 
1.5 Non-Clinical Evidence  
No non -clinical evidence is available for the PR tablet.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
1.6 Clinical Evidence to Date  
A total of 5 single and multiple -dose pharmacokinetic studies  (139-15, BE -16-081, BE -16-295, 
BE-17-279, BE -17-281) have been performed with the test product .  These studies 
demonstrate d the oral bioavailability (BA) of the ibuprofen  PR tablets (dosed at 2x 300 mg) is 
comparable to  Brufen® (Ibuprofen) IR Tablets  (dosed at 3x200  mg) after a single dose and at 
steady state conditions.  In terms of the release profile and absorption , Cmax tends to be  slightly  
higher in the IR formulation when compared with the PR formulation [21.96 ±3.87 µg/mL vs 
14.51 ±3.1 µg/mL] .  However the C max, (Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration ), Tmax, 
(Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration ) and AUC 0-Tmax (Area Under the Plasma 
Conce ntration Curve ) of the PR formulation suggest that’s the onset of action should not be 
any slower than the IR reference when  considering the minimum effective concentration of 
ibuprofen (4).  In terms of total exposure (AUC 0-∞) the concentration profile is bioequivalent  
between the PR test product and the IR reference product [163.41 ±43.0 µg.h/mL vs 168.59 
±37.7 µg.h/mL].   A food effect is demonstrated when the test product is taken in the fed state, 
with an expected increase  in the absorption rate.  
In the 5 PK studies performed (over 200 subjects ) only a limited number of mild, transient 
adverse events were reported.    
Summary  Outcomes:  
 The Clinical data available for this reformulation (Ibuprofen 300 mg PR) suggests an 
adequate  pharmacokinetic  profile  to achieve a sufficient therapeutic effect  in the 
proposed study  
 There are n o safety concerns with the test product  
 Ibuprofen 300  mg PR had an increased rate of absorption when administered with food.  
 Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088385] and was bioequivalent based on AUC 0-∞ 
 
1.7 Risks / Benefits  
This study has been designed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088386] 
will undergo a full health check as part of the enrolment into the study to confirm that they 
are healthy as defined in this protocol (see Section  4). 
Participants randomised into the placebo arm would not be expected to derive  any therapeutic 
benefit from the admin istration  of the placebo tablets. The placebo arm is essential to the study

design as it ensures that any conclusion of non -inferiority from t he trial is a reflection of the 
true properties of the treatments ; that is,  it demonstrates  the assay s ensitivity of the study.  
However, this obviously leaves the participants without adequate analgesia in the post -surgery  
procedure and from an ethical pe rspective this is mitigated in the study design by [CONTACT_790009]. Although it is hypothesised 
that the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) will provide adequate analgesia in the study , 
this cannot be guaranteed , and therefore the use of rescue medication also addresses  the 
potential of reduced or lack of efficacy.  
Ibuprofen is an established pharmaceutical ingredient and the adverse reactions associated 
with administration of 1200  mg/24  hour (OTC doses) are well known and documented (2)(5).  
The adverse reactions most frequently occurring with a single dose being nausea, 
gastrointestinal upset, vomiting, diarrhoea, light headedness, dizziness and headache. Rarely, 
more serious reactions have been reported including GI bleeding, ulceration and perforations, 
hypertension and renal failure. When OTC doses of ibuprofen (200 -400 mg/dose; 1200  
mg/day) are taken for acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_789977] (5).  
The specific 200mg Ibuprofen tablet to be used in this study as the active comparator 
(Treatment B) is marketed in the EU under the Nurofen brand and has  an excellent safety 
profile.   
It is not anticipated that the safety profile of ibuprofen will be altered after administration of 
multiple single doses of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088387] 6 days is deemed to be  sufficient 
prior to the Follow -up/Early Termination Visit to ensure adequate safety monitoring  of the IMP.  
The investigation site will have adequate set up, experience and safety measures that would 
be expected of a centre able to perform regular molar extractions. They will also have adequate 
experience in the safety monitoring of participant s post dose that would be expected in a 
clinical trial  setting.  Therefore, it is considered that the risk related to study procedures are low 
and limited to common adverse events (AEs) related to the dental procedure, administration 
of routine anaesthetics , and discomfort from vital sign  measurements.   Any subject that 
experiences immediate complications during the surgery will be excluded from the study.  
Therefore, the overall benefit -risk profile for the use of the investigational product as 
defined in th is protocol is considered favourable.

This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol and the principles set out in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. It will comply with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the superiority of  2×[ADDRESS_1088389] initial dose.  
Key Secondary Objectives:  
 To evaluate the analgesic performance  of a total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1088390] initial dose.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets.  
Additional Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the total analgesic effect, peak analgesic effect,  onset and duration of action 
and the subject’s overall assessment of the study  medication s. 
3 STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE FOR DESIGN  
This is a single centre  randomi sed, double -blind,  double dummy,  parallel group, multiple -dose, 
active and placebo -controlled efficacy study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2×[ADDRESS_1088391] -surgical pain 
model that produces pain that is predictable in its character, duration, and intensity(6). The 
model is widely accepted and has a proven record of assay sensitivity (i.e. separating active 
drugs from each other, as well as from placebo). The model is frequently used to evaluate 
NSAID type analgesics. Results from dental pain studies are accepte d by [CONTACT_3361] ( FDA) and European authorities and have been widely extrapolated to 
other general pain conditions.  
The decision to conduct the study in the [LOCATION_002] was taken as suitably qualified and 
experienced test sites co uld not be found in Europe .  The specific test site ha s been chosen 
to conduct the study as they have a  proven history of quality and safety  when conducting  
studies  of this type . 
The placebo products have two purposes:  
1. To mask the treatment identify for PR and IR arms  
2. Act as a control arm  
The dose of the test product is the proposed posology of the final product and the dose of the 
active comparator is the posology provided in the label of the product.  
Eligible su bjects will be randomis ed in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets 
Q12h, 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR tablets Q8h, or placebo. The randomis ation will be stratified by

between placebo  and PR ibuprofen over 
12 hours after initial dose will be evaluated 
as confirmatory evidence  (for the purposes 
of this study, a difference of 30% in PID 
scores over 12  hours after initial dose  will be 
considered clinically relevant) . 
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
 To evaluate the analgesic performance 
of a total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1088395] initial dose.   
 To evaluate the total analgesic effect, 
peak analgesic effect, onset and duration Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
 The summed pain intensity difference 
(SPID) over 0  to 24  hours (SPID24) will 
be used to compare the test product 
(2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets twice 
daily [BID]) and comparator product 
(2×200  mg ibuprofen IR tablets three 
times a day [TID]).

a. Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the 
primary mode of action  
b. Male or female condom with or without spermicide  
c. Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide  
Alternatively, highly effective method s of contraception are also considered acceptable, such 
as: 
d. Surgical sterilisation  
e. Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception  
f. Some intrauterine devices (IUDs) or intrauterine systems (IUSs)

of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the sole partner for that subject]  
h. True abstinence which is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post -ovulation 
methods; declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial; and withdrawal  are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  
4.5 Discontinuation / Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects  
The Investigator may withdraw the subject from the study at any time. Reasons for removing 
a subject from the study include, but are not limited to:  
 AEs that in the judgement of the Investigator may cause severe or permanent harm 
(significant clinical deterioration is an AE)  
 Violation of the study protocol  
 In the Investigator’s judgement, it is in the subject’s best interest  
 Subject declines further study parti cipation  
 If applicable, randomisation code is broken  
If subjects choose to prematurely stop the study prior to the scheduled discharge at Hour 24, 
safety and tolerability assessments must be performed prior to discharge, and, if possible, 
efficacy assessme nts should be performed.  
If subjects choose to prematurely stop the study  after clinic discharge but prior to the follow -up 
visit, at least [ADDRESS_1088404] the subjects for follow -up 
assessments which will include the assess ments described for the follow -up visit (Section  7.4).

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088414]’s participation in the 
study (last assessment) will be recorded on the concomitant medication page in the eCRF.  
Upon discharge from the study site, subjects may be prescribed pain medication for use at 
home according to the standard practice of th e study site.  
5.[ADDRESS_1088415] possible compliance with study requirements.  Any non -compliance during 
the study will be observed and recorded by [CONTACT_790015] a protocol deviation . 
5.5 Packaging and Labelling and Supp ly / Resupply  
For each subject one pack  will be provided containing all  required tablets for each dosing 
timepoint.   Each tablet will be held in a blister within the pack.  The pack will clearly show which 
tablets are to be taken at which timepoint.  
All packs regardless of treatment regimen will be the same except for a kit number  and will 
therefore not identify the treatment . 
The IMP will be labelled in accordance with EudraLex Volume 4 Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP) Guidelines, Annex 13 - Manufacture of Investigational Medicinal Products, parts 26 to 
33 (Labelling) and in accordance with directive 2003/94/EC as amended and including any 
other applicable national/state legislation. The IMP will be labelled  in English

(IMSU), Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare ([LOCATION_006]) Ltd, Dansom Lane, Hull, HU8 7DS, [LOCATION_006]. IMP will 
be shipped from the IMSU to the study site.  
5.6 Storage Conditions  
The Investigator or designated individual will keep all IMP(s) in a pharmacy or a secure storage 
facility, accessible only to those individuals authorised by [CONTACT_790017].  
The Investigator or designated individual will maintain an inventory. This will include the 
description a nd quantity of IMP(s) received during the course of this study, as well as a record 
of the materials that are dispensed and returned (how much, to whom  and when). This 
inventory (“ Drug  Dispensing Log”) will be subject to  review by [CONTACT_790018].  
The Investigator agrees not to supply IMP(s) to any person except study personnel and 
patient s enrolled in this study.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
The IMP should be stored between 8 -25 °C and is not to be refrigerated or frozen.  
Temperatures must be constantly moni tored and readings logged in a temperature log on 
working days.  
The temperature in the secure storage facility will be recorded using a minimum /maximum 
thermometer . If the temperature falls outside the specified range of 8 -25 °C, the Sponsor 
should be notified immediately and appropriate action should be agreed and documented. The 
temperature log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_216590] .  
5.7 Blinding 
This study is a double -blind, double dummy study.   There will be two placebo tablets designed 
to be comparable to each of the active products (PR and IR) in both shape, size, colour and 
weight.  
All subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1088416]’s 
treatment assignment.  
For emergency unblinding, study personnel will use the IWRS. If treatment assignment is 
unblinded fo r an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of that subject’s treatment 
assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the remaining subjects in the 
study. Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a subject’s tre atment 
assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The 
investigator should make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.  
5.9 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator will keep all study medication (includin g rescue medication) in a pharmacy or 
a secure storage facility, accessible only to those individuals authorised by [CONTACT_790019].

the study manual or other site documentation.  
6.11 Oral Radiography  
Oral radiographs (X -rays) will be taken at Screening (radi ographs taken within 1  year before 
Screening will be acceptable and do not need to be repeated).  
6.12 Pain Intensity  
Subjects will rate their pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 -10 where 0  = no 
pain and 10 = worst pain ever  at the timepoin ts mentioned on Table [ADDRESS_1088423] will be instructed, “Stop the first stopwatch when you first 
feel any pain reli ef whatsoever. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you 
might, but when you first feel any relief in the pain you have now” (perceptible pain relief). The 
subject will also be instructed, “Stop the second stopwatch when you feel the pain  relief is 
meaningful to you” (meaningful pain relief). If the subject does not press the stopwatches within 
[ADDRESS_1088424] will discontinue use of the stopwatches.  
6.14 Pain Relief Scale  
Subjects will rate their pain relief relative to Time 0 using a 5 -point categorical scale. Subjects 
will be asked “How much relief have you had since your starting pain?” with response choices 
of none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, and complete = 4. At each assessment time point, 
the pain intensity N RS assessment will be completed first and the pain relief assessment will

8 SAFETY REPORTING  
8.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse e vent (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a clinical 
investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship w ith  this treatment . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) pro duct. [ICH E6 1.2].   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening  
 requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_317066]  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or  
 is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect  
In addition, important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but may jeopardise the pati ent or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above should also usually be considered serious.  
[ICH E2A] Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscras ias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: If the event is related to the investigational product and is both serious and unexpected, 
it is classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R ). In case of 
double -blinded studies, unblinding is needed in order to determine a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
8.[ADDRESS_1088441]’s source documents and electronic case report forms ( eCRFs). 
Untoward medical occurrences  can be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_790022] -leading questioning or observation by [CONTACT_790023] a significant laboratory 
abnorm ality.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088442] medical occurrences , including  all adverse events (AE) and all serious adverse 
events (SAEs) are collected, fully investigated and documented.  
As the study will b e conducted on subjects who have been  through removal of impacted third 
molars, it is expected that they will present post -surgical symptoms , for example: swelling  and 
bruising. For the purpose s of this study, when at normal/expected magnitude, such 
occurrences will not be reported as AEs as they are expected and, therefore, are not 
“untoward” as in the AE standard definition.  
SAEs should be followed until resolution or stabilisation. Participants with ongoing SAEs at 
study termination will be further followed up until recovery or until stabil isation of the disease 
after termination.  
For each AE a causality assessment of the event to the study drug must be performed. The 
relationship to IMP must be determined by [CONTACT_737] (if medically qualified) or by a 
medically qualified Co -Investigat or.

All AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_790026] -to-date version of MedDRA.  
8.3 Reporting of Adverse Events  
In the event of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), the Investigator must report the event using 
the SAE form to the Sponsor Global Vigilance Group (GVG), by [CONTACT_790027]: 
[EMAIL_15051]  while copying in the contract research organisation ( CRO ) and Sponsor 
Project/Study Managers within 24 hours of knowledge of th e event.

subjects by [CONTACT_30100].   
8.5 Overdose, Abuse, Misuse and Medication Errors  
The Sponsor defines “overdose” as the admini stration of a quantity of an investigational IMP 
given per administration or cumulatively, which is above the maximum recommended dose 
according to the authorised product information.  
The Sponsor defines “abuse” as the persistent or sporadic, intentional e xcessive use of an 
IMP, which is intended to produce harmful physical or psychological effects e.g. intentional 
overdose to experience psychological effects.  
The Sponsor defines “misuse” as situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately 
used  not in accordance with the authorised product information.  
Overdoses, abuse, misuse are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an 
associated AE / SAE. The overdose, abuse, misuse and any associated AE / SAE will be 
captured on an AE CRF  (Case Report Form) page / SAE form.  
Due t o the full inpatient nature of this study,  in which medication doses will be supervised by 
[CONTACT_6624], cases of overdose, abuse or misuse are not expected to occur.  
Medication errors are any unintentional errors in dispensing or administration of the IMP which 
relates to:  
 Taking / being administered an incorrect IMP  
 Taking / being administered a drug by [CONTACT_790029] e.g. swallowing 
a suppository  
 The accidental administration of the IMP to a pe rson who is not a subject within the 
study  
Medication errors are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an associated 
AE / SAE. Medication errors with or without an associated AE / SAE will be captured on the 
AE CRF page / SAE form.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section presents  a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan 
(SAP)  that describes the details of the analyses to be conducted  will be written  prior to 
database lock.  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will typi[INVESTIGATOR_149176], mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, summary  
statistics will typ ically include the number and percentage of subjects in each category.  All data 
will be presented in listings.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before dosing with study drug.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size determination is based on the primary efficacy variable, SPID12. According 
to Farrar 2001(1), a clinically important  improvement  in pain is represented by a 2 point  
reduction  on an 11 -point NRS. Based on a baseline pain score of 7 this corresponds to an 
approximate 30% reduction in pain. An average 2 point difference in pain scores between 
Ibuprofen PR and placebo  across all 14 assessments up to 12 hours  will correspond to a 
difference in SPID12 of 24 points. In a previous study (7), the pooled standard deviation (SD) 
for SPID12 was 31.65. Assuming the same variability in this study, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1088448] >90% power to detect a difference of 24 points in SPID12, between 
ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088449] differences between PR and IR, and 
to obtain a more precise estimate for this comparison, a 3:3:1 allocation ratio will be used, so 
that 120 subjects are randomised into each of the PR and IR groups.  Thus 280 subjects will 
be enroll ed into the study. 
9.2 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis  is planned .  
9.3 Analysis Datasets  
The analysis populations include the following:

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are treated with 
study drug and who have at least 1  pain relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT 
population is the primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of al l ITT subjects who do not incur a 
major protocol violation that would challenge the validity of their data. This population 
will be utilized to evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will include all subjects who a re treated with study drug. The 
safety population is the population for all safety assessments.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1088450] Disposition and Characteristics  
The numbers of subjects randomised, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated o verall and by [CONTACT_1570]. The number of subjects in each 
analysis population will be reported.  Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date 
of birth , sex, race, weight, height, BMI, medical history, and surgery duration) will be 
summarized  for each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive statistics. 
No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
9.[ADDRESS_1088451] is between PR ibuprofen and placebo. In addition, the 
comparison b etween IR ibuprofen and placebo will be presented with p -values to demonstrate 
study sensitivity. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be used to evaluate the 
clinical relevance of any differences between the PR and IR formulations. All treatm ent 
differences will be presented with 95% confidence intervals.  No P value adjustment will be 
made for multiple endpoints or multiple comparisons.  In the event of model assumptions for 
normality being violated, non -parametric methods will be used.  
Each efficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570] . 
 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint, summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0 to 12 hours (SPID12) , 
will be used to compare the test product (2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets) against the placebo 
product . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal to SPID12 for ibuprofen 
2×[ADDRESS_1088452] (WOCF) imputation for subjects who use rescue medication. The 
primary analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088453] at the significance level of 0.05.

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analysis  
The clinical relevance of the  difference between placebo and PR ibuprofen over 12  hours after 
initial dose will be evaluated . 
 Secondary Endpoints  
 The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 24  hours (SPID24) will be 
used to compare the test product (2× 300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  twice daily [BID]) 
and comparator product (2×2 00 mg ibuprofen IR tablets three times a day [TID]).  
 Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 4 hours (SPID4), over 0  to 8 hours 
(SPID8), and ove r 0 to 12  hours (SPID12) after Time  0 
 Sum of total pain relief (TOTPAR) over 0  to 4 hours (TOTPAR4), over 0  to 8 hours 
(TOTPAR8), over 0 to 12  hours (TOTPAR12), and over 0 to 24 hours (TOTPAR24) 
after Time  0 
 Summed pain relief and intensity difference (sum  of TOTPAR and SPID [SPRID]) 
over 0  to 4 hours (SPRID4), over 0  to 8 hours (SPRID8), over 0  to 12  hours 
(SPRID12), and over 0  to 24  hours (SPRID24) after Time  0 
 Response to study drug ( a responder will be defined as a subject with ≥30% 
improvement in pain intensity without rescue medication  during the first 8 hours ) 
 Numeric rating scale  (NRS) pain intensity difference (PID) at each scheduled time 
point after Time  0 
 Pain intensity score at each scheduled time point  
 Pain relief score at each scheduled time po int after Time  0 
 Peak pain relief  
 Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible pain relief confirmed by 
[CONTACT_789999]) using double stopwatch  
 Time to first perceptible pain relief  
 Time to meaningful pain relief  
 Time to peak pain relief  
 Proportion of subjects using rescue medication  
 Time to first use of rescue medication   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, SPID at each scheduled 
time point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, TOTPAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, 
SPID8, SPID24, SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics (such as 
mean,  standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for each 
treatment regimen. P values from ANCOVA models comparing the placebo group with other 
treatment groups, including terms for treatment and a covariate for baseline pain  will be 
provided for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables, but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  In the event that normality assumptions are violated for a 
parameter, non -parametric analysis methods will be used.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
For ordinal se condary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at each scheduled time 
point, pain relief at each scheduled time point, peak pain relief, and global evaluation of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the number and perce ntage of 
subjects within each category for each treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact 
tests (or chi -square tests, as appropriate) comparing the placebo group with other treatment 
groups will be provided  for peak pain relief  and global evalu ation of study drug , but no formal 
statistical inferences will be drawn on the basis of these tests.  
For each time -to-event endpoint, Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to evaluate the 
treatment effect. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to pe rceptible pain relief 
confirmed by [CONTACT_88965]) will be based on data collected using the double stopwatch 
method. Time to onset of analgesia will be right -censored at 8  hours for subjects who do not 
experience both perceptible pain relief and m eaningful pain relief during the 8 -hour interval 
after Time  0. The summary table s will provide the number of subjects analysed, the number of 
subjects censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
estimated median and th e restricted mean estimate. P  values comparing placebo to active 
treatment from Wilcoxon or log -rank tests (as appropriate) will also be used to examine 
treatment effect.  
For time to onset of analgesia, the comparison of interest will be the ibuprofen 2×30 0 mg PR 
group versus the ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table for this comparison will 
provide the number of subjects analysed, the number of subjects censored, estimates for the 
quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimated median and the restricted mean 
estimate.  
For the proportion of subjects who are responders and  the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication, logistic regression model s that adjust for baseline intensity and/or significant 
demographic variables, if appropriate, will be used to evaluate the treatment effect .   
For the responder analysis , subjec ts will be censored at 8 hours and for the use of rescue 
medication /time to first rescue  subjects will be censored at 24 hours.  
9.6 Safety Analyses  
 Safety Endpoint(s)

for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after Baseline. No formal statistical tests 
will be perf ormed.  
9.7 Handling of Missing Data and Drop -outs 
Missing pain assessments for all efficacy analyses will be handled as follows:  
 Missing pain assessments scheduled before the first observed assessment will be 
imputed with the subject’s worst observed pain assessment.  
 Missing intermediate pain assessments will be replaced by [CONTACT_229091].  
 Missing pain assessments at the end of the observation period due to premature 
discontinuation of pain assessments will be imputed by [CONTACT_790047].  
 
The primary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. Any pain measurements taken during a 
period of time in which rescue medication is active (4 hours) will be replaced by [CONTACT_790048]. A sensitivity analysis will also be 
performed, in which all pain assessments recorded after the first dose of rescue medication 
has been taken will be disregarded and the rules outlined above will be used for missing data.  
 
All data for assessments other than pain assessments will be analysed as collected; missing 
data due to premature termination or any other reason will be l eft as missing . In the event of a 
notabl e difference between treatment groups in the number of subjects using rescue 
medication, other sensitivity analyses may be performed. These will be detailed in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP).

10 DATA HANDLING AND RECOR D KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
10.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
Data will be recorded in an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). For each enrolled study 
subject an eCRF is maintained. The Investigator or designees is responsible for the quality of 
the data record in the eCRF. eCRFs mus t be kept current to reflect subject status at each 
phase during the course of study. Subjects must not be identified in the eCRF by [CONTACT_790049].

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088456]. The investigator and study monitor will identify 
the data that will be recorded directly on the eCRF and for this data the eCRF will be considered 
the source document (i.e ., no prior written or electronic record of the data). The study monitor 
will document this at the screening and it will also be documented in the D ata Management 
Plan.  
Source documents will include notes taken at the site and will include data such as 
demographic data, participation in study and ICF, medical history, SAEs, AEs and concomitant 
medication, results of examinations and assessments.  
Where source data are in the form of a computer print out (e.g. medical records, laboratory 
data) they will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_790034], confirming that 
the print out is a true and faithful record of the data for that subjec t. These print -outs will be 
filed in the study files.  
The Investigator agrees to provide direct access to source data for study -related monitoring, 
audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s). Direct access to source data requires that the 
subject giv es written, documented consent to this.  
10.3 Data Management  
The data management group at Premier Research will be responsible for data management 
and eCRF activities.  
Full details regarding data management will be described within the Data Management Plan.  
10.4 Reporting of Protocol Deviations  
Site staff should make the study monitor aware of any deviation from the protocol as soon as 
possible after occurrence. Waivers for inclusion / exclusion criteria are not allowed.  
10.5 Retention of Essential Documentation  
The Inv estigator should retain all essential documents (as defined in ICH E6 or according to 
other national and international regulations) until at least 5 years after the completion of the 
study  (defined as  last subject last visit in the study ). These documents should be retained for 
a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_195843]. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator 
when these documents no longer need to be retaine d.

11.1 Monitoring  
The Sponsor will organise regular monitoring visits to be performed at intervals agreed with 
the Investigator. The anticipated monitoring frequency will be stated in the Monitoring Plan. 
Monitoring will also involve, as appropriate, correspon dence and telephone contacts.  
On-site monitoring includes source data verification (SDV) which is the procedure whereby [CONTACT_790035]. It will be performed in such  a way as to preserve subject confidentiality, taking 
into account all ethical and legislative requirements.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at some 
time during the monitoring visit to review the data  and resolve any queries and to allow direct 
access to the subject’s records for SDV).  
SDV will include as a minimum verification for all subjects, subject identity ( date of birth, sex, 
initials and subject number), record of entry into the study and sign ature of the informed 
consent. In addition, details of SAEs in the subject’s notes will be verified. Details included in

 Date that the subject gave written consent  
 All visi t dates  
 All SAEs  
 All concomitant medications  
At a site visit the eCRFs should be complete and available in order that the accuracy of their 
completion may be checked. Each completed eCRF for each subject must be signed 
electronically by [CONTACT_737], t o verify the data and statements submitted. Similarly, all 
alterations on paper records must be initialled and dated by [CONTACT_29517] a designated

STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  A randomised , double -blind,  double -dummy,  parallel -group, multiple -
dose, active and placebo -controlled  efficacy  study of ibuprofen 
prolonged -release tablets for the treatment of pain after surgical 
removal of impacted third molars  
RB Study 
Number:  5003601  
Background and 
Rationale:  Reckitt Benckiser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300 mg ibuprofen 
prolonged  release ( PR) tablet with Strides Shasun Ltd . The product 
has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs to have 
access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR 
formulation will reduce fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations and 
allow for a lower frequency of administration which is desirable in 
situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulati ons. As a result, the 
product would be more consumer friendly, require less dosing and 
improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the 
short -term symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain such as 
dysmenorrhea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain of non -serious 
arthritic conditions  and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen  300 mg PR tablets.  Two tablets to be taken every 12 hours 
when required for pain relief. No  more than 2 doses in 24 hours.  The 
maximum daily dose is 1200  mg and there is no proposed indication in 
the p aediatric population.  
 
Therefore, the purpose of the proposed study is to provide supporting 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_789975] E urope , 
Australia  and Russia . The decision to progress to an efficacy  clinical 
trial was determined on the basis o f successful outcomes of the 2  
phase  1 clinical trials (BE/17/279 and BE/17/281) in terms of 
bioavailability (BA) versus  a ref erence ibuprofen immediate  release 
(IR) product and bioequivalence (BE ) versus comparator 600  mg 
ibuprofen PR. 
Objectives :  Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the superiority of 2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  
compared with placebo in subjects experiencing acute

Key Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the analgesic performance of a total daily dose of 
1200  mg of ibuprofen PR formulation compared to ibuprofen  
immediate release ( IR) formulation over [ADDRESS_1088492] initial 
dose.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2×300 mg ibuprofen 
PR tablets . 
Additional Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the total analgesic  effect, peak analgesic effect,  
onset and duration of action and the subject’s overall 
assessment of the study  medication s. 
Design: This is  a single centre , randomised , double -blind,  double -dummy,  
parallel group, multiple -dose, active and placebo -controlled efficacy 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2×[ADDRESS_1088493]-surgical  dental pain.  
Primary 
Endpoint:  The Summed P ain Intensity Difference (SPID) over  0 to 12 hours 
(SPID12) will be used to compare the test product ( 2×300 mg ibuprofen 
PR tablets ) against the placebo product.  
Confirmatory 
Evaluation : Clinically relevant difference between placebo and PR ibuprofen over 
12 hours after initial dose  (for the purposes of this study, a  difference 
of 30 % in PID scores over 12 hours after initial dose  will be considered 
clinically relevant ).(1)  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  Key secondary efficacy endpoint: 
 The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 
24 hours (SPID24) will be used to compare the test product 
(2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  twice daily [ BID]) and active 
comparator product ( 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR tablets three times 
a day  [TID]). 
Efficacy endpoints : 
 Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 4 hours 
(SPID4), over 0  to 8 hours (SPID8), and over 0  to 12  hours

Treatment 
Regimen:   200 mg ibuprofen IR tablet s for oral administration  
 Placebo  (for blinding purposes, two types of placebo tablets will 
be made; one to look like the test product and one to look like 
the reference product)  
Treatment regimens:  
Eligible subjects meeting all study entry criteria will be randomis ed to 
receive 1  of the following treatments:  
 Treatment A: test product;  2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets , BID 
(total daily dose 1200  mg) 
 Treatment B: reference product; 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR 
tablet s, TID (total daily dose 1200  mg) 
 Treatment C: matching placebo tablets  
Methodology:  This is a single centre , randomi sed, double  blind, double -dummy, 
parallel  group -, multiple -dose, active  and placebo  controlled efficacy 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088496] be 
ipsilateral.  
All subjects will receive local anaesthesia  (2% lidocaine with 
1:100,000  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Nitrous oxide will be allowed at the discretion 
of the investigator. Subjects who experience moderate to severe pain 
intensity (a score of ≥  5 on a numeric rating scale [NRS] from 0 -10 
where 0 = no pain, 10 = wor st pain ever) within 6  hours after surgery 
and who continue to meet all study entry criteria will be randomis ed in 
a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets  every 12  hours 
(Q12h ), 2×200  mg ibuprofen IR tablets every 8 hours ( Q8h), or 
placebo. The randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_790000] 
(moderate or severe) using a categorical scale that includes the 
categories of none  (0), mild (1 -4), moderate ( 5-7), and severe  (8-10).  
Subjects will re -assess their baseline pain intensity using the NRS 
immediately before receiving study drug (pre -dose, Time  0) and their 
pain intensity (NRS) and pain relief (5 -point categorical scale) at the 
following time points (pre -dose, if at one of the dosing timepoint s of 0,

Statistical 
Evaluation:  Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations include the followin g: 
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects 
who are treated with study drug and who have at least 1  pain 
relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT population is the 
primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per  protocol - (PP) population will consist of all ITT subjects 
who do not incur a major protocol violation that would challenge 
the validity of their data. This population will be utilized to 
evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will include all subjects who  are treated 
with study drug. The safety population is the population for all 
safety assessments.  
Subject Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date of birth , sex, 
race, w eight, height, BMI  and medical history) will be summari zed for 
each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive 
statistics. No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal 
to SPID12 for ibuprofen 2 ×300  mg PR tablets. The primary analysis 
will be an AN COVA (Analysis of Covariance) model  that includes the 
main effect of treatment and the baseline pain score as a covariate  and 
will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
imputation for subjects who use rescue medication.  The primary 
analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088503] at the significance level of 0.05.  
All o ther comparisons between the treatment regime ns, including 
ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR tablets versus placebo, will be considered 
secondary. No P  value adjustment will be made for multiple endpoints 
or multiple comparisons.  
Each efficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6490].  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, 
SPID at each scheduled t ime point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, 
TOTPAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, SPID8, SPID24, 
SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics

(such as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided fo r each treatment re gimen. Nominal P  values from 
ANCOVA models  comparing the placebo group with other treatment 
groups , including terms for treatment and baseline pain  will be 
provided  for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables , but no formal 
statistical inferences will be drawn o n the basis of these tests.  
For ordinal secondary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at 
each scheduled time point, pain relief at each scheduled time point, 
peak pain relief, response to study drug, and global evaluation of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the 
number and percentage of subjects within each category for each 
treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact tests (or 
chi-square - tests, as appropriate) comparing the placebo group with 
other treatment groups will be provided  for peak pain relief  and global 
evaluation of study drug , but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  For each time  to- event endpoint, 
Kaplan  Meier methodology will be used to eva luate the treatment 
effect. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible 
pain relief confirmed by [CONTACT_88965])  will be based on data 
collected using the double stopwatch  method. Time to onset of 
analgesia will be -right censored - at [ADDRESS_1088504] will be the ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR group 
versus the ibu profen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table s will 
provide the number of subjects analy sed, the number of subjects 
censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the estimated median and the restricted mean estimate. 
P values from the Wilcoxon or log  rank- tests (as appropriate) will also 
be used to compare placebo to the active treatments . 
For the responder analysis and the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication,  logistic regression model s that adjust  for baseline intensity 
and/or significant demographic variables, if appropriate , will be used to 
evaluate the treatment effect.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before 
dosing with a study drug.  
Missing pain assessments for all efficacy analyse s will be handled as 
follows:  
 Missing pain assessments  scheduled before the first observed 
assessment will be imputed with the subject’s worst observed 
pain assessment .

 Missing intermediate pain assessment s will be replaced by 
[CONTACT_229091].  
 Missing  pain assessment s at the end of the observation period 
due to premature discontinuation of pain assessments will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_790003].  
The primary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried 
forward (WOCF)  methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. 
Any pain measurements taken during a period of time in which rescue 
medication is active (4  hours) will be replaced by [CONTACT_790048]. A se nsitivity 
analysis will also be performed, in which all pain assessments 
recorded after the first dose of rescue medication has been taken will 
be disregarded and the rules outlined above will be used for missing 
data.  
All data for assessments other than p ain assessments will be analysed 
as collected; missing data due to premature termination or any other 
reason will be left as missing.  
Safety Analysis  
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory A ctivities (MedDRA) (Version  19.0 
or higher) will be used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ 
class and preferred term. Adverse event summaries will include only 
TEAEs, which will be summarized for each treatment group.  
For vital sign measurem ents, descriptive statistics will be provided at 
each scheduled time point for each treatment group. Changes from 
Baseline for vital signs will be calculated for each subject, and 
descriptive statistics will be provided on changes in vital signs from 
Basel ine for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after 
Baseline. No formal statistical tests will be performed.

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background for the Study and Rationale  
Reckitt Benckiser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300  mg ibuprofen prolonged  release ( PR) tablet 
with Strides Shasun Ltd. The product has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs 
to have access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR formulation will reduce 
fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations  and allow for a lower frequency of administration 
which is desirable in situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulations. As a result, the product would be more 
consumer friendly, requi re less dosing and improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the short -term symptomatic 
treatment of mild to moderate pain such as dysmenorrhea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain 
of non -serious arth ritic conditions and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088505] 
in addition to the data obtained in two bioequivalence studies BE/17/279 and BE/17/[ADDRESS_1088506]  
Ibuprofen [2 -(4-isobutylphenyl) propi[INVESTIGATOR_149046]]  is a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) with anti -inflammatory, analgesic and anti -pyretic properties (2). It was initially available 
in 1969 as a prescription only medicine, indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and 
other chronic p ainful conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis. Following further research and 
the establishment of a reassuring safety profile, it was launched in 1983 as an over -the-counter 
(OTC) medication, marketed as Nurofen®. 
Absorption of ibuprofen after oral administration is fairly rapid with peak serum concentrations 
occurring within  1 to 2 hours after administration. Ibuprofen is extensively bound to plasma 
proteins (99%) when administered at therapeutic levels and has a p lasma half -life of about 
2 hours. Excretion by [CONTACT_790007], but only a small proportion of drug 
is excreted unchanged in urine, the majority being extensively metabolised in the liver to 
2 major inactive metabolites. The pharmacok inetics  of ibuprofen has been extensively 
reviewed by [CONTACT_790008] (3).

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088507] in the study : 
 Treatment A: test product, 2x300  mg PR ibuprofen tablet, twice daily [total daily dose 
1200  mg] 
 Treatment B: reference product, 2x200  mg IR ibuprofen tablet, three times a day [total 
daily dose 1200  mg] 
 Treatment C: matching placeb o tablets for both the test and reference regimens  
 
The active comparator (Treatment B)  currently marketed in a number of geographies including 
a number of  different  European countries.   It has therefore been chosen to fulfil requirements  
that when it is included in a marketing authorisation dossier as a comparator that it is licenced 
within the EU.      
 
1.4 Study Population and Indication  
The following study population will be invited to participate in this clinical trial:  
Adult participants aged [ADDRESS_1088508] be a fully or partially bone -impacted mandibular molar , (if only [ADDRESS_1088509] be ipsilateral ), and who experience moderate to severe pain following 
surgery . 
Such population is expected to present pain levels that will allow for assessing the magnitude 
of treatment effect in a low variability setting . 
 
1.5 Non-Clinical Evidence  
No non -clinical evidence is available for the PR tablet.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
1.6 Clinical Evidence to Date  
A total of 5 single and multiple -dose pharmacokinetic studies  (139-15, BE -16-081, BE -16-295, 
BE-17-279, BE -17-281) have been performed with the te st product .  These studies 
demonstrate d the oral bioavailability (BA) of the ibuprofen  PR tablets (dosed at 2x300  mg) is 
comparable to  Brufen® (Ibuprofen) IR Tablets  (dosed at 3x200  mg) after a single dose and at 
steady state conditions.  In terms of the release profile and absorption , Cmax tends to be  slightly  
higher in the IR formulation when compared with the PR formulation [21.96 ±3.87 µg/mL vs 
14.51 ±3.1 µg/mL] .  However the C max, (Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration ), Tmax, 
(Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration ) and AUC 0-Tmax (Area Under the Plasma 
Concentration Curve ) of the PR formulation suggest that’s the onset of action should not be 
any slower than the IR reference when  considering the minimum effective concentration of 
ibuprofen (4).  In terms of total exposure (AUC 0-∞) the concentration profile is bioequivalent  
between the PR test product and the IR reference product [163.41 ±43.0 µg.h/mL vs 168.59 
±37.7 µg.h/mL].   A food effect is demonstrated when the test product is taken in the fed  state, 
with an expected increase  in the absorption rate.  
In the 5 PK studies performed (over 200 subjects ) only a limited number of mild, transient 
adverse events were reported.    
Summary  Outcomes:  
 The Clinical data available for this reformulation (Ibuprofen 300 mg PR) suggests an 
adequate  pharmacokinetic  profile  to achieve a sufficient therapeutic effect  in the 
proposed study  
 There are n o safety concerns with the test product  
 Ibuprofen 300  mg PR had an increased rate of absorption whe n administered with food.  
 Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088510] and was bioequivalent based on AUC 0-∞ 
 
1.7 Risks / Benefits  
This study has been designed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088511] 
will undergo a full health check as part of the enrolment into the study to confirm that they 
are healthy as defined in this pr otocol (see Section  4). 
Participants randomised into the placebo arm would not be expected to derive  any therapeutic 
benefit from the admin istration  of the placebo tablets. The placebo arm is essential to the study

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
design as it ensures that any conclusion of non -inferiority from the trial is a reflection of the 
true properties of the treatments ; that is,  it demonstrates  the assay s ensitivity of the study.  
However, this obviously leaves the participants without adequate analgesia  in the post -surgery  
procedure and from an ethical perspective this is mitigated in the study design by [CONTACT_790009]. Although it is hypothesised 
that the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) will provide adequate analgesia in the study , 
this cannot be guaranteed , and therefore the use of rescue medication also addresses  the 
potential of reduced or lack of efficacy.  
Ibuprofen is an established pharmaceutical ingredient and the adverse reactions associated 
with administration of 1200  mg/24  hour (OTC doses) are well known and documented (2)(5).  
The adverse reactions most frequently occu rring with a single dose being nausea, 
gastrointestinal upset, vomiting, diarrhoea, light headedness, dizziness and headache. Rarely, 
more serious reactions have been reported including GI bleeding, ulceration and perforations, 
hypertension and renal failu re. When OTC doses of ibuprofen (200 -400 mg/dose; 1200  
mg/day) are taken for acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_789977] (5).  
The specific 200mg Ibuprofen tablet to be used in this study as the active comparator 
(Treatment B) is marketed in the EU under the Nurofen brand and has  an excellent safety 
profile.   
It is not anticipated that the safety profile of ibuprofen will be alte red after administration of 
multiple single doses of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088512] 6 days is deemed to be  sufficient 
prior to the Follow -up/Early Termination Visit to ensure adequate safety monitoring of the IMP.  
The investigation site will have adequate set up, experience and safety measures that would 
be expected of a centre able to perform regular molar extractions. They will also have adequate 
experience in the safety monitoring of participant s post dose that would be expected in a 
clinical trial  setting.  Therefore, it is considered that the risk related to study pro cedures are low 
and limited to common adverse events (AEs) related to the dental procedure, administration 
of routine anaesthetics, and discomfort from vital sign  measurements.   Any subject that 
experiences immediate complications during the surgery will b e excluded from the study.  
Therefore, the overall benefit -risk profile for the use of the investigational product as 
defined in this protocol is considered favourable.

This study will be conducted in accordance with this protoc ol and the principles set out in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. It will comply with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the supe riority of  2×[ADDRESS_1088514] initial dose.  
Key Secondary Objectives:  
 To evaluate the analgesic performance  of a total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1088515] initial dose.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets.  
Additional Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the total analgesic effect, peak analgesic effect,  onset and duration of action 
and the subject’s overall assessment of the study  medication s. 
3 STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE FOR DESIGN  
This is a single centre  randomi sed, double -blind,  double dummy,  parallel group, multiple -dose, 
active and placebo -controlled efficacy study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2×[ADDRESS_1088516] -surgical pain 
model that produces pain that is predictable in its character, duration, and intensity(6). The 
model is widely accepted and has a proven record of assay sensitivity (i.e. separating active 
drugs from each other, as well as fr om placebo). The model is frequently used to evaluate 
NSAID type analgesics. Results from dental pain studies are accepted by [CONTACT_3361] ( FDA) and European authorities and have been widely extrapolated to 
other general pain conditi ons. 
The decision to conduct the study in the [LOCATION_002] was taken as suitably qualified and 
experienced test sites could not be found in Europe .  The specific test site ha s been chosen 
to conduct the study as they have a  proven history of quality and s afety  when conducting  
studies  of this type . 
The placebo products have two purposes:  
1. To mask the treatment identify for PR and IR arms  
2. Act as a control arm  
The dose of the test product is the proposed posology of the final product and the dose of the 
active comparator is the posology provided in the label of the product.  
Eligible subjects will be randomis ed in a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets 
Q12h, 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR tablets Q8h, or placebo. The randomis ation will be strati fied by

Objectives Endpoints  
Primary Objective : 
To evaluate the superiority of 2×[ADDRESS_1088518] initial dose.  Primary Endpoint:   
The primary efficacy endpoint is the summed 
pain intensity difference (SPID) over the 0 to 
12 hours (SPID12) after Time [ADDRESS_1088519] (2x300  mg 
PR ibuprofen) and the placebo product.   
The clinical relevance of the difference 
between placebo  and PR ibuprofen over 
12 hours after initial dose will be evaluated 
as confirmatory evidence  (for the purposes 
of this study, a difference of 30% in PID 
scores over 12  hours after initial dose  will be 
considered clinically relevant) . 
Secondary Efficacy Objectives:  
 To evaluate the analgesic performance 
of a total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1088520] initial dose.   
 To evaluate the total analgesic effect, 
peak analgesic effect, onset and duration Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints : 
 The summed pain intensity difference 
(SPID) over 0  to 24  hours (SPID24) will 
be used to compare the test product 
(2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets twice 
daily [BID]) and comparator product 
(2×200  mg ibuprofen IR tablets three 
times a day [TID]).

of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the  sole partner for that s ubject]  
 True abstinence which is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence such as  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation 
methods ; declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial;  and withdrawal are not 
accep table methods of contraception . 
4.5 Discontinuation / Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects  
The Investigator may withdraw the subject from the study at any time. Reasons for removing 
a subject from the study include, but are not limited to:  
 AEs that in the judgement of the Investigator may cause severe or permanent harm 
(significant clinical deterioration is an AE)  
 Violation of the study protocol

5.[ADDRESS_1088538] possible compliance with study requirements.  Any non -compliance during 
the study will be observed and recorded by [CONTACT_790015] a protocol deviation . 
5.5 Packaging and Labelling and Supp ly / Resupply  
For each subject one pack  will be provided containing all  required tablets for each dosing 
timepoint.   Each tablet will be held in a blister within the pack.  The pack will clearly show which 
tablets are to be taken at which timepoint.  
All packs regardless of treatment regimen will be the same except for a kit number  and will 
therefore not identify the treatment . 
The IMP will be labelled in accordance with EudraLex Volume 4 Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP) Guidelines, Annex 13 - Manufacture of Investigational Medicinal Products, parts 26 to 
33 (Labelling) and in accordance with directive 2003/94/EC as amended and including any 
other applicable national/state legislation. The IMP will be labelled  in English  
All IMP will be packed and labelled to GMP by [CONTACT_790016] 
(IMSU), Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare ([LOCATION_006]) Ltd, Dansom Lane, Hull, HU8 7DS, [LOCATION_006]. IMP will 
be shipped from the IMSU to the study site.  
5.6 Storage Conditions  
The Investigator or designated individual will keep all IMP(s) in a pharmacy or a secure storage 
facility, accessible only to those individuals authorised by [CONTACT_790017].  
The Investigator or designated individual will maintain an inventory. This will include the 
description a nd quantity of IMP(s) received during the course of this study, as well as a record 
of the materials that are dispensed and returned (how much, to whom  and when). This 
inventory (“ Drug  Dispensing Log”) will be subject to  review by [CONTACT_790018].  
The Investigator agrees not to supply IMP(s) to any person except study personnel and 
patient s enrolled in this study.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
The IMP should be stored between 8 -25 °C and is not to be refrigerated or frozen.  
Temperatures must be constantly moni tored and readings logged in a temperature log on 
working days.  
The temperature in the secure storage facility will be recorded using a minimum /maximum 
thermometer . If the temperature falls outside the specified range of 8 -25 °C, the Sponsor 
should be notified immediately and appropriate action should be agreed and documented. The 
temperature log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_216590] .  
5.7 Blinding  
This study is a double -blind, double dummy study.   There will be two placebo tablets designed 
to be comparable to each of the active products (PR and IR) in both shape, size, colour and 
weight.  
All subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1088539]’s 
treatment assignment.  
For emergency unblinding , study personnel will use the IWRS. If treatment assignment is 
unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of that subject’s treatment 
assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the remaining subjects in the 
study. Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a subject’s treatment 
assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The 
investigator should make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.  
5.9 Drug Accountability  
The Investigator will keep all study medication (including rescue medication) in a pharmacy or 
a secure storage facility, accessible only to those individuals authorised by [CONTACT_790019].

 For female subjects of childbearing potential, a blood sample for the serum pregnancy 
test will be collected at Screening and a urine pregnancy test sample will be collected 
before surgery on Day  1. 
Blood and urine samples for hematology, s erum chemistry, and urinalysis will be prepared 
using standard procedures and will be sent to a central laboratory for analyses.

sign assessments will include blood pressure, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature. C linically significant abnormalities in vital signs should be recorded  as AE s. 
6.10 Blood Sampling  
Blood sampling will be performed according to the site’s standard practices, as described in 
the study manual or other site documentation.  
6.11 Oral Radiography  
Oral radiographs (X -rays) will be taken at Screening (radi ographs taken within 1  year before 
Screening will be acceptable and do not need to be repeated).  
6.12 Pain Intensity  
Subjects will rate their pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 -10 where 0  = no 
pain and 10 = worst pain ever  at the timepoin ts mentioned on  Table [ADDRESS_1088546] will be instructed, “Stop the first stopwatch when you first 
feel any pain reli ef whatsoever. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you 
might, but when you first feel any relief in the pain you have now” (perceptible pain relief). The 
subject will also be instructed, “Stop the second stopwatch when you feel the pain  relief is 
meaningful to you” (meaningful pain relief). If the subject does not press the stopwatches within 
[ADDRESS_1088547] will discontinue use of the stopwatches.  
6.14 Pain Relief Scale  
Subjects will rate their pain relief relative to Time 0 using a 5 -point categorical scale. Subjects 
will be asked “How much relief have you had since your starting pain?” with response choices 
of none = 0, a little = 1, some = 2, a lot = 3, and complete = 4. At each assessment time point, 
the pain intensity N RS assessment will be completed first and the pain relief assessment will

complaints?” at the baseline visit, and “Have  you had any symptoms or complaints since the 
last time you were asked?” during the study. In addition, spontaneously reported AEs are 
collected.  
The observation period for an individual subject will start after giving informed consent and will 
finish at t he last visit (follow -up visit) for the given individual subject. A ll AEs that arise during 
the observation period will be recorded and an assessment of the AE will be performed as per 
Section  8.[ADDRESS_1088551] has signed the consent form but 
before administration of the IMP, it  should be reported as an adverse event, including those 
associated with study procedures.

8 SAFETY REPORTING  
8.1 Adverse Event Defini tions 
An Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse e vent (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a clinical 
investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship w ith  this treatment . An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigation al) product. [ICH E6 1.2].   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening  
 requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789981] 
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or  
 is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect  
In addition, important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but may jeopardise t he patient or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above should also usually be considered serious.  
[ICH E2A] Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: If the event is related to the investigational product and is both serious and unexpected, 
it is classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R ). In case of 
double -blinded studies, unblinding is needed in order to determine a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
8.[ADDRESS_1088564]’s source documents and electronic case report forms ( eCRFs). 
Untoward medical occurrences  can be reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_790022] -leading questioning or observation by [CONTACT_790023] a significant laborator y 
abnormality.

events (SAEs) are collected, fully investigated and documented.  
As the study will b e conducted on subjects who have been  through removal of impacted third 
molars, it is expected that they will present post -surgical symptoms , for example: swelling  and 
bruising. For the purpose s of this study, when at normal/expected magnitude, such 
occurrences will not be reported as AEs as they are expected and, therefore, are not 
“untoward” as in the AE standard definition.  
SAEs should be followed until resolution or stabilisation. Participants with ongoing SAEs at 
study termination will be further followed up until recovery or until stabil isation of the disease 
after termination.  
For each AE a causality assessment of the event to the study drug must be performed. The 
relationship to IMP must be determined by [CONTACT_737] (if medically qualified) or by a 
medically qualified Co -Investigat or.

Moderate  The AE results in some limitation of usual activities; the subject may 
experience significant discomfort  
Severe  The AE results in an inability to carry out usual activities; the subject 
may experience intolerable discomfort or pain  
 
Expectedness for each AE will be determined based on the informa tion in Section 6.[ADDRESS_1088566] igator’s Brochur e. 
All AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_790026] -to-date version of MedDRA.  
8.3 Reporting of Adverse Events  
In the event of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), the Investigator must report the event using 
the SAE form to the Sponsor Global Vigilance Group (GVG), by [CONTACT_790027]:

8.5 Overdose, Abuse, Misuse and Medication Errors  
The Spons or defines “overdose” as the administration of a quantity of an investigational IMP 
given per administration or cumulatively, which is above the maximum recommended dose 
according to the authorised product information.  
The Sponsor defines “abuse” as the pe rsistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of an 
IMP, which is intended to produce harmful physical or psychological effects e.g. intentional 
overdose to experience psychological effects.  
The Sponsor defines “misuse” as situations where the IMP is int entionally and inappropriately 
used not in accordance with the authorised product information.  
Overdoses, abuse, misuse are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an 
associated AE / SAE. The overdose, abuse, misuse and any associated AE / SAE will be 
captured on an AE CRF (Case Report Form) page / SAE form.  
Due t o the full inpatient nature of this study,  in which medication doses will be supervised by 
[CONTACT_6624], cases of overdose, abuse or misuse are not expected to occur.  
Medication errors are any unintentional errors in dispensing or administration of the IMP which 
relates to:  
 Taking / being administered an incorrect IMP  
 Taking / being administered a drug by [CONTACT_790029] e.g. swallowing 
a suppository  
 The accident al administration of the IMP to a person who is not a subject within the 
study  
Medication errors are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an associated

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section presents  a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan 
(SAP)  that describe s the details of the analyses to be conducted  will be written  prior to 
database lock.  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will typi[INVESTIGATOR_149176], mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, summary  
statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_88917].  All data 
will be presented in listings.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before dosing with study drug.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size determination is based on the primary efficacy variable, SPID12. According 
to Farrar 2001(1), a clinically important  improvement  in pain is represented by a 2 point  
reduction  on an 11 -point NRS. Based on a baseline pain score of 7 this corresponds to an 
approximate 30% reduction in pain. An average 2 point difference in pain scores between 
Ibuprofen PR and placebo  across all 14 assessments up to 12 hours  will correspond to a 
difference in SPID12 of 24 points. In a previous study (7), the pooled standard deviation (SD) 
for SPID12 was 31.65. Assuming the same variability in this study, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1088571] >90% power to detect a difference of 24 points in SPID12, between 
ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088572] differences between PR and IR, and 
to obtain a more precise estimate for this comparison, a 3:3:1 allocation ratio will be used, so 
that 120 subjects are randomised into each of the PR and IR groups.  Thus 280 subjects will 
be enroll ed into the study. 
9.2 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis  is planned .  
9.3 Analysis Datasets  
The analysis populations include the following:

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are treated with 
study drug and who have at least 1  pain relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT 
population is the primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of al l ITT subjects who do not incur a 
major protocol violation that would challenge the validity of their data. This population 
will be utilized to evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will include all subjects who a re treated with study drug. The 
safety population is the population for all safety assessments.  
 
9.[ADDRESS_1088573] Disposition and Characteristics  
The numbers of subjects randomised, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated o verall and by [CONTACT_1570]. The number of subjects in each 
analysis population will be reported.  Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date 
of birth , sex, race, weight, height, BMI, medical history, and surgery duration) will be 
summarized  for each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive statistics. 
No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
9.[ADDRESS_1088574] is between PR ibuprofen and placebo. In addition, the 
comparison b etween IR ibuprofen and placebo will be presented with p -values to demonstrate 
study sensitivity. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be used to evaluate the 
clinical relevance of any differences between the PR and IR formulations. All treatm ent 
differences will be presented with 95% confidence intervals.  No P value adjustment will be 
made for multiple endpoints or multiple comparisons.  In the event of model assumptions for 
normality being violated, non -parametric methods will be used.  
Each ef ficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570] . 
 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint, summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0 to 12 hours (SPID12) , 
will be used to compare the test product (2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets) against the placebo 
product . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal to SPID12 for ibuprofen 
2×[ADDRESS_1088575] (WOCF) imputation for subjects who use rescue medication. The 
primary analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088576] at the significance level of 0.05.

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analysis  
The clinical relevance of the  difference between placebo and PR ibuprofen over 12  hours after 
initial dose will be evaluated . 
 Secondary Endpoints  
 The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 24  hours (SPID24) will be 
used to compare the t est product (2× 300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  twice daily [BID]) 
and comparator product (2×2 00 mg ibuprofen IR tablets three times a day [TID]).  
 Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 4 hours (SPID4), over 0  to 8 hours 
(SPID8), and over 0  to 12  hours (SPID12) after Time  0 
 Sum of total pain relief (TOTPAR) over 0  to 4 hours (TOTPAR4), over 0  to 8 hours 
(TOTPAR8), over 0 to 12  hours (TOTPAR12), and over 0 to 24 hours (TOTPAR24) 
after Time  0 
 Summed pain relief and intensity difference (sum of TOTPAR an d SPID [SPRID]) 
over 0  to 4 hours (SPRID4), over 0  to 8 hours (SPRID8), over 0  to 12  hours 
(SPRID12), and over 0  to 24  hours (SPRID24) after Time  0 
 Response to study drug ( a responder will be defined as a subject with ≥30% 
improvement in pain intensity without rescue medication  during the first 8 hours ) 
 Numeric rating scale  (NRS) pain intensity difference (PID) at each scheduled time 
point after Time  0 
 Pain intensity score at each scheduled time point  
 Pain relief score at each scheduled time point after Time  0 
 Peak pain relief  
 Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible pain relief confirmed by 
[CONTACT_789999]) using double stopwatch  
 Time to first perceptible pain relief  
 Time to meaningful pain relief  
 Time to peak pain relief  
 Proportion of subjects using rescue medication  
 Time to first use of rescue medication   
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, SPID at each scheduled 
time point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, TOT PAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, 
SPID8, SPID24, SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics (such as 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for each 
treatment regimen. P values from ANCOVA models comparing  the placebo group with other 
treatment groups, including terms for treatment and a covariate for baseline pain  will be 
provided for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables, but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  In the e vent that normality assumptions are violated for a 
parameter, non -parametric analysis methods will be used.

Study No: 5003601  Protocol Version: 19 July 2019, FINAL  Version  2.0 Page 56 of 63 
 
D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
For ordinal secondary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at each scheduled time 
point, pain relief at each scheduled time point, peak pai n relief, and global evaluation of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the number and percentage of 
subjects within each category for each treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact 
tests (or chi -square tests, as appropriate) comparing the placebo group with other treatment 
groups will be provided  for peak pain relief  and global evaluation of study drug , but no formal 
statistical inferences will be drawn on the basis of these tests.  
For each time -to-event endpoint,  Kaplan -Meier methodology will be used to evaluate the 
treatment effect. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible pain relief 
confirmed by [CONTACT_88965]) will be based on data collected using the double stopwatch 
method. Time to  onset of analgesia will be right -censored at 8  hours for subjects who do not 
experience both perceptible pain relief and meaningful pain relief during the 8 -hour interval 
after Time  0. The summary table s will provide the number of subjects analysed, the n umber of 
subjects censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
estimated median and the restricted mean estimate. P  values comparing placebo to active 
treatment from Wilcoxon or log -rank tests (as appropriate) will also  be used to examine 
treatment effect.  
For time to onset of analgesia, the comparison of interest will be the ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR 
group versus the ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table for this comparison will 
provide the number of subjects analy sed, the number of subjects censored, estimates for the 
quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimated median and the restricted mean 
estimate.  
For the proportion of subjects who are responders and the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication, logistic regression model s that adjust for baseline intensity and/or significant 
demographic variables, if appropriate, will be used to evaluate the treatment effect .   
For the responder analysis , subjects will be censored at 8 hours and for th e use of rescue 
medication /time to first rescue  subjects will be censored at 24 hours.  
9.6 Safety Analyses  
 Safety Endpoint(s)  
 Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
 Incidence of  changes in vital sign measurements  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoint Analyses  
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Version  19.0 or higher) will be used to classify all AEs with 
respect to system organ class and preferred term. Adverse event summaries  will include only 
TEAEs, which will be summarized for each treatment group.

for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after Baseline. No formal statistical tests 
will be performed.  
9.7 Handling of Missing Data a nd Drop -outs 
Missing pain assessments for all efficacy analyses will be handled as follows:  
 Missing pain assessments scheduled before the first observed assessment will be 
imputed with the subject’s worst observed pain assessment.  
 Missing intermediate pain  assessments will be replaced by [CONTACT_229091].  
 Missing pain assessments at the end of the observation period due to premature 
discontinuation of pain assessments will be imputed by [CONTACT_790030].  
 
The p rimary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. Any pain measurements taken during a 
period of time in which rescue medication is active (4 hours) will be replaced by [CONTACT_333003] p ain 
measurement before the rescue medication was taken. A sensitivity analysis will also be 
performed, in which all pain assessments recorded after the first dose of rescue medication 
has been taken will be disregarded and the rules outlined above will be used for missing data.  
 
All data for assessments other than pain assessments will be analysed as collected; missing 
data due to premature termination or any other reason will be l eft as missing . In the event of a 
notable difference between treatment groups in the number of subjects using rescue 
medication, other sensitivity analyses may be performed. These will be detailed in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1088578] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
10.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
Data will be recorded in an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). For each enrolled study 
subject an eCRF is maintained. The Investigator or designees is responsible for the quality of 
the data recor d in the eCRF. eCRFs must be kept current to reflect subject status at each 
phase during the course of study. Subjects must not be identified in the eCRF by [CONTACT_790049].

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088579]. The investigator and study monitor will  identify 
the data that will be recorded directly on the eCRF and for this data the eCRF will be considered 
the source document (i.e ., no prior written or electronic record of the data). The study monitor 
will document this at the screening and it will als o be documented in the Data Management 
Plan.  
Source documents will include notes taken at the site and will include data such as 
demographic data, participation in study and ICF, medical history, SAEs, AEs and concomitant 
medication, results of examinations and assessments.  
Where source data are in the form of a computer print out (e.g. medical records, laboratory 
data) they will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_790034], confirming that 
the print out is a true and faithful record of the data for that subject. These print -outs will be 
filed in the study files.  
The Investigator agrees to provide direct access to source data for study -related monitoring, 
audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s). Direct access to source data requires that the 
subject gives written, documented co nsent to this.  
10.3 Data Management  
The data management group at Premier Research will be responsible for data management 
and eCRF activities.  
Full details regarding data management will be described within the Data Management Plan.  
10.4 Reporting of Protocol Deviations  
Site staff should make the study monitor aware of any deviation from the protocol as soon as 
possible after occurrence. Waivers for inclusion / exclusion criteria are not allowed.  
10.5 Retention of Essential Documentation  
The Investigator should reta in all essential documents (as defined in ICH E6 or according to 
other national and international regulations) until at least 5 years after the completion of the 
study  (defined as  last subject last visit in the study ). These documents should be retained fo r 
a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_195843]. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator 
when these documents no longer need to be retained.

11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Monitoring  
The Spo nsor will organise regular monitoring visits to be performed at intervals agreed with 
the Investigator. The anticipated monitoring frequency will be stated in the Monitoring Plan. 
Monitoring will also involve, as appropriate, correspondence and telephone c ontacts.  
On-site monitoring includes source data verification (SDV) which is the procedure whereby [CONTACT_790035]. It will be performed in such a way as to preserve  subject confidentiality, taking 
into account all ethical and legislative requirements.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at some 
time during the monitoring visit to review the data and resolve any quer ies and to allow direct 
access to the subject’s records for SDV).  
SDV will include as a minimum verification for all subjects, subject identity ( date of birth, sex, 
initials and subject number), record of entry into the study and signature [CONTACT_790084]. In addition, details of SAEs in the subject’s notes will be verified. Details included in 
the subject’s notes as a minimum:  
 Study number, brief description or title of study  
 Date that the subject gave written consent  
 All visit dates  
 All SAEs  
 All concomitant medications  
At a site visit the eCRFs should be complete and available in order that the accuracy of their 
completion may be checked. Each completed eCRF for each subject must be signed 
electronically by [CONTACT_737], to verify the data and  statements submitted. Similarly, all 
alterations on paper records must be initialled and dated by [CONTACT_29517] a designated 
person, explained as necessary, with the original mistake left legible .

report for this protocol.   
As part of administering the informed consent document, the Investigator must explain to each 
subject the nature of the study, its purpose, the procedures invol ved, the expected duration, 
the potential risks and benefits involved, and any potential discomfort.  Each subject must be 
informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdraw from the 
study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical 
treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  The subject should understand the study, 
patient information sheet,  and ICF before signing and dating the ICF.  The Investigator or 
person obtaining consent must also sign and date the form.  Each subject will be given a copy 
of the signed informed con sent and written information.  
12.3 Early / Premature  Termination of the Study  
In the unlikely event that this study generates an excessive frequency of advers e events, 
subjects’ termination or suspension may be requested by [CONTACT_790037].  
The sponsor retains the right to terminate the study for non -safety reasons by [CONTACT_790052].  
Any decisions to terminate or suspend the study will be notified in writing to the Investigator or

STUDY SYNOPSIS  
Study Title:  A randomised , double -blind,  double -dummy,  parallel -group, multiple -
dose, active and placebo -controlled  efficacy  study of ibuprofen 
prolonged -release tablets for the treatment of pain after surgical 
removal of impacted third molars  
RB Study 
Number:  5003601  
Background and 
Rationale:  Reckitt Benckiser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300 mg ibuprofen 
prolonged  release ( PR) tablet with Strides Shasun Ltd . The product 
has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs to have 
access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR 
formulation will reduce fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations and 
allow for a lower frequency of administration which is desirable in 
situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulati ons. As a result, the 
product would be more consumer friendly, require less dosing and 
improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the 
short -term symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain such as 
dysmenorrhea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain of non -serious 
arthritic conditions  and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen  300 mg PR tablets.  Two tablets to be taken every 12 hours 
when required for pain relief. No  more than 2 doses in 24 hours.  The 
maximum daily dose is 1200  mg and there is no proposed indication in 
the p aediatric population.  
 
Therefore, the purpose of the proposed study is to provide supporting 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_789975] E urope , 
Australia  and Russia . The decision to progress to an efficacy  clinical 
trial was determined on the basis o f successful outcomes of the 2  
phase  1 clinical trials (BE/17/279 and BE/17/281) in terms of 
bioavailability (BA) versus  a ref erence ibuprofen immediate  release 
(IR) product and bioequivalence (BE ) versus comparator 600  mg 
ibuprofen PR. 
Objectives :  Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the superiority of 2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  
compared with placebo in subjects experiencing acute

Key Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the analgesic performance of a total daily dose of 
1200  mg of ibuprofen PR formulation compared to ibuprofen  
immediate release ( IR) formulation over [ADDRESS_1088613] initial 
dose.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2×300 mg ibuprofen 
PR tablets . 
Additional Secondary Objective s: 
 To evaluate the total analgesic  effect, peak analgesic effect,  
onset and duration of action and the subject’s overall 
assessment of the study  medication s. 
Design: This is  a single centre , randomised , double -blind,  double -dummy,  
parallel group, multiple -dose, active and placebo -controlled efficacy 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2×300 mg ibuprofen PR 
tablets  in subjects with postoperative dental pain.  
Primary 
Endpoint:  The Summed P ain Intensity Difference (SPID) over  0 to 12 hours 
(SPID12) will be used to compare the test product ( 2×300 mg ibuprofen 
PR tablets ) against the placebo product.  
Confirmatory 
Evaluation : Clinically relevant difference between placebo and PR ibuprofen over 
12 hours after initial dose  (for the purposes of this study, a  difference 
of 30 % in PID scores over 12 hours after initial dose  will be considered 
clinically relevant ).(1)  
Secondary 
Endpoints:  Key secondary efficacy endpoint: 
 The summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 
24 hours (SPID24) will be used to compare the test product 
(2×300 mg ibuprofen PR tablets  twice daily [ BID]) and active 
comparator product ( 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR tablets three times 
a day  [TID]). 
Efficacy endpoints : 
 Summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over 0  to 4 hours 
(SPID4), over 0  to 8 hours (SPID8), and over 0  to 12  hours 
(SPID12) after Time  0 
 Sum of total pain relief (TOTPAR) over 0  to 4 hours 
(TOTPAR4), over 0  to 8 hours (TOTPAR8), over 0 to 12  hours 
(TOTPA R12), and over 0 to 24 hours (TOTPAR24) after Time  0 
 Summed pain relief and intensity difference (sum of TOTPAR 
and SPID [SPRID]) over 0  to 4 hours (SPRID4), over 0  to 
8 hours (SPRID8), over 0  to 12  hours (SPRID12), and over 0  to 
24 hours (SPRID24) after T ime 0

 Placebo  (for blinding purposes, two types of placebo tablets will 
be made; one to look like the test product and one to look like 
the reference product)  
Treatment regimens:  
Eligible subjects meeting all study entry criteria will be randomis ed to 
receive 1  of the following treatments:  
 Treatment A: test product;  2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets , BID 
(total daily dose 1200  mg) 
 Treatment B: reference product; 2×200 mg ibuprofen IR 
tablet s, TID (total daily dose 1200  mg) 
 Treatment C: matching placebo tablets  
Methodology:  This is a single centre , randomi sed, double  blind, double -dummy, 
parallel  group -, multiple -dose, active  and placebo  controlled efficacy 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088617] be 
ipsilateral.  
All subjects will receive local anaes thesia  (2% lidocaine with 
1:100,000  epi[INVESTIGATOR_238]). Nitrous oxide will be allowed at the discretion 
of the investigator. Subjects who experience moderate to severe pain 
intensity (a score of ≥  5 on a numeric rating scale [NRS] from 0 -10 
where 0 = no pain, 10  = worst pain ever) within 6  hours after surgery 
and who continue to meet all study entry criteria will be randomis ed in 
a 3:3:1 ratio to receive 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets  every 12  hours 
(Q12h ), 2×200  mg ibuprofen IR tablets every 8 hours ( Q8h), or 
placebo. The randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_790000] 
(moderate or severe) using a categorical scale that includes the 
categories of none  (0), mild (1 -4), moderate ( 5-7), and severe  (8-10).  
Subjects will re -assess their baseline pai n intensity using the NRS 
immediately before receiving study drug (pre -dose, Time  0) and their 
pain intensity (NRS) and pain relief (5 -point categorical scale) at the 
following time points (pre -dose, if at one of the dosing timepoint s of 0, 
8, 12 and/or 16 hours ): 15, 30, and 45  minutes, and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5,

dose of rescue medication (whichever  occurs first). Vita l signs will be 
recorded after the subject has been in a sitting position for 3 minutes 
at the following times: before surgery, within 30 minutes before Time  0, 
12 and 24 hours after Time  0, and/or immediately before the first dose 
of rescue medication. Ad verse events (A Es) will be monitored and 
recorded from the time of signing of the informed consent form ( ICF) 
until the Follow  up- Visit (or Early Termination Visit). During the 
24 hours following Time  0, subjects will complete efficacy and safety 
assessme nts. Subjects will remain at the study site overnight and will 
be discharged on Day  2.  
Paracetamol / acetaminophen (1000  mg) will be permitted as the initial 
rescue medication. Subjects will be encouraged to wait at least 
[ADDRESS_1088621]’s pain, 5  mg oxycodone rescue medication may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator.  
Subjects are not permitted to take any concomitant medications that 
might confound assessments of pain relief, such as psychotropic 
drugs, antidepressants, sedative -hypnotics (other than those permitted 
for conscious sedation), or other analgesics taken within five times of 
their eliminatio n half -lives (other than those used at the surgery) . 
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and 
noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are permitted if the subject 
has been on a stable dose for at least four weeks prior to Visit 1  
(screening) .  
Other restrictions include the following: alcohol use is prohibited from 
24 hours before surgery until discharge on Day  2; nothing by [CONTACT_790001] 1  hour after surgery; clear liquids 
only are allowed starting 1  hour after surgery until 1  hour after dosing; 
[ADDRESS_1088622]’s diet may be advanced ac cording to 
standard practice.  
Upon discharge from the study site, subjects may be prescribed pain 
medication for use at home according to the standard pra ctice of the

study site. On Day  8 (± 2 days), subjects will return to the study site for 
an abbreviated confirmatory physical assessment and AE 
assessments.  
Statistical 
Evaluation:  Analysis Populations  
The analysis populations include the followin g: 
 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects 
who are treated with study drug and who have at least 1  pain 
relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT population is the 
primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per  protocol - (PP) popula tion will consist of all ITT subjects 
who do not incur a major protocol violation that would challenge 
the validity of their data. This population will be utilized to 
evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will inc lude all subjects who are treated 
with study drug. The safety population is the population for all 
safety assessments.  
Subject Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date of birth , sex, 
race, w eight, height, BMI  and medical his tory) will be summarized for 
each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive 
statistics. No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
Efficacy Analyses  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal 
to SPID12 for ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR tablets. The primary analysis 
will be an AN COVA (Analysis of Covariance) model  that includes the 
main effect of treatment and the baseline pain score as a covariate  and 
will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
imputation for subjects who use rescue medication.  The primary 
analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088623] at the significance level of 0.05.  
All o ther comparisons between the treatment regime ns, including 
ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR tablets versus placebo, will be considered 
secondary. No P  value adjustment will be made for multiple endpoints 
or multiple comparisons.  
Each efficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_6490].  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, 
SPID at each scheduled time point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, 
TOTPAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, SPID8, SPID24, 
SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics 
(such as mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) 
will be provided  for each treatment regimen. Nominal P  values from

ANCOVA models  comparing the placebo group with other treatment 
groups , including terms for treatment and baseline pain  will be 
provided  for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables , but no formal 
statistical inferences will be drawn on the basis of these tests.  
For ordinal secondary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at 
each scheduled time point, pain relief at each scheduled time point, 
peak pain relief, response to study drug, and global evaluation  of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the 
number and percentage of subjects within each category for each 
treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact tests (or 
chi-square - tests, as appropriate) comparing the pla cebo group with 
other treatment groups will be provided  for peak pain relief  and global 
evaluation of study drug , but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  For each time  to- event endpoint, 
Kaplan  Meier methodology wil l be used to evaluate the treatment 
effect. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible 
pain relief confirmed by [CONTACT_88965])  will be based on data 
collected using the double stopwatch  method. Time to onset of 
analgesia will be -right censored - at [ADDRESS_1088624] will be the ibuprofen 2×300  mg PR grou p 
versus the ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table s will 
provide the number of subjects analy sed, the number of subjects 
censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals 
(CIs) for the estimated median and the restricted mean est imate. 
P values from the Wilcoxon or log  rank- tests (as appropriate) will also 
be used to compare placebo to the active treatments . 
For the responder analysis and the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication,  logistic regression model s that adjust  for baseline intensity 
and/or significant demographic variables, if appropriate , will be used to 
evaluate the treatment effect.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before 
dosing with a study drug.  
Missing pain assessments for all ef ficacy analyses will be handled as 
follows:  
 Missing pain assessments  scheduled before the first observed 
assessment will be imputed with the subject’s worst observed 
pain assessment . 
 Missing intermediate pain assessment s will be replaced by 
[CONTACT_790002].

 Missing pain assessment s at the end of the observation period 
due to premature discontinuation of pain assessments will be 
imputed by [CONTACT_790003].  
The primary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried 
forward (WOCF)  methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. 
Any pain measurements taken during a period of time in which rescue 
medication is active (4  hours) will be replaced by [CONTACT_790057]. A sensitivity 
analysis will also be performed, in which all pain assessments 
recorded after the first dose of rescue medication has been taken will 
be disregarded and the rules outlined above will be used for missing 
data.  
All data for asse ssments other than pain assessments will be analysed 
as collected; missing data due to premature termination or any other 
reason will be left as missing.  
Safety Analysis  
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Version  19.0 
or higher) will be used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ 
class and preferred term. Adverse event summaries will include only 
TEAEs, which will be  summarized for each treatment group.  
For vital sign measurements, descriptive statistics will be provided at 
each scheduled time point for each treatment group. Changes from 
Baseline for vital signs will be calculated for each subject, and 
descriptive st atistics will be provided on changes in vital signs from 
Baseline for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after 
Baseline. No formal statistical tests will be performed.

1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Background for the Study and Rationale  
Recki tt Benckiser (RB) is co -developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a new 300  mg ibuprofen prolonged  release ( PR) tablet 
with Strides Shasun Ltd. The product has been developed to meet consumer and patient needs 
to have access to longer acting over -the-counter analgesics. This PR formulat ion will reduce 
fluctuations in drug plasma concentrations  and allow for a lower frequency of administration 
which is desirable in situations where pain duration is expected to be prolonged and require 
multiple doses of immediate release formulations. As a  result, the product would be more 
consumer friendly, require less dosing and improve compliance with treatment.  
The proposed therapeutic indications of the PR product are for the short -term symptomatic 
treatment of mild to moderate pain such as dysmenorrh ea, rheumatic pain, muscular pain, pain 
of non -serious arthritic conditions and backache.  
The proposed posology in adults over the age of 18 is:  
Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088625] 
in addition to the data obtained in two bioequivalence studies BE/17/279 and BE/17/[ADDRESS_1088626]  
Ibuprofen [2 -(4-isobutylphenyl) propi[INVESTIGATOR_149046]] is a non -steroidal anti -inflammatory drug 
(NSAID) with anti -inflammatory, analgesic and anti -pyretic properties(2). It was initially available 
in 1969 as a prescription only medicine, indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and 
other chronic painful conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis. Following further research and 
the establishment of a reassuring safety profile, it was launched in 1983 as an over -the-counter 
(OTC) me dication, marketed as Nurofen®. 
Absorption of ibuprofen after oral administration is fairly rapid with peak serum concentrations 
occurring within  1 to 2 hours after administration. Ibuprofen is extensively bound to plasma 
proteins (99%) when administered at therapeutic levels and has a p lasma half -life of about 
2 hours. Excretion by [CONTACT_790007], but only a small proportion of drug 
is excreted unchanged in urine, the majority being extensively metabolised in the liver to 
2 major inactive metabolites. The pharmacok inetics  of ibuprofen has been extensively 
reviewed by [CONTACT_790008](3).

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088627] in the study : 
 Treatment A: test product, 2x300  mg PR ibuprofen tablet, twice daily [total daily dose 
1200  mg] 
 Treatment B: reference product, 2x200  mg IR ibuprofen tablet, three times a day [total 
daily dose 1200  mg] 
 Treatment C: matching placeb o tablets for both the test and reference regimens  
 
The active comparator (Treatment B)  currently marketed in a number of geographies including 
a number of  different  European countries.   It has therefore been chosen to fulfil requirements  
that when it is included in a marketing authorisation dossier as a comparator th at it is licenced 
within the EU.      
 
1.4 Study Population and Indication  
The following study population will be invited to participate in this clinical trial:  
Adult participants aged [ADDRESS_1088628] be a fully or partially bone -impacted mandibular molar , (if only [ADDRESS_1088629] be ipsilateral ), and who experience moderate to severe pain following 
surgery . 
Such population is expected to present pain levels that will allow fo r assessing the magnitude 
of treatment effect in a low variability setting.  
 
1.5 Non-Clinical Evidence  
No non -clinical evidence is available for the PR tablet.

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.0 05 -Jun-2017  
1.6 Clinical Evidence to Date  
A total of 5 single and multiple -dose pharmacokinetic studies  (139-15, BE -16-081, BE -16-295, 
BE-17-279, BE -17-281) have been performed with the test product .  These studies 
demonstrate d the oral bioavailability (BA) of the ibuprofen  PR tablets (dosed at 2x300  mg) is 
comparable to  Brufen® (Ibuprofen) IR Tablets  (dose d at 3x200  mg) after a single dose and at 
steady state conditions.  In terms of the release profile and absorption , Cmax tends to be  slightly  
higher in the IR formulation when compared with the PR formulation [21.96 ±3.87 µg/mL vs 
14.51 ±3.1 µg/mL] .  However the C max, (Maximum Observed Plasma Concentration ), Tmax, 
(Time to Maximum Plasma Concentration ) and AUC 0-Tmax (Area Under the Plasma 
Concentration Curve ) of the PR formulation suggest that’s the onset of action should not be 
any slower than the IR r eference when  considering the minimum effective concentration of 
ibuprofen(4).  In terms of total exposure (AUC 0-∞) the concentration profile is bioequivalent  
between the PR test product and the IR reference product [163.41 ±43.0 µg.h/mL vs 168.59 
±37.7 µg.h/mL].   A food effect is demonstrated when the test product is taken in the fed state, 
with an expected increase  in the absorption rate.  
In the 5 PK studies performed (over 200 subjects ) only a limited number of mild, transient 
adverse events were repor ted.   
Summary  Outcomes:  
 The Clinical data available for this reformulation (Ibuprofen 300 mg PR) suggests an 
adequate  pharmacokinetic  profile  to achieve a sufficient therapeutic effect  in the 
proposed study  
 There are n o safety concerns with the test produ ct 
 Ibuprofen 300  mg PR had an increased rate of absorption when administered with food.  
 Ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088630] and was bioequivalent based on AUC 0-∞ 
 
1.7 Risks / Benefits  
This study has b een designed to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088631] 
will undergo a full health check as part of the enrolment into  the study to confirm that they 
are healthy as defined in this protocol (see Section  4). 
Participants randomised into the placebo arm would not be expected to derive  any therapeutic 
benefit from the admin istration  of the placebo tablets. The placebo arm is essential to the study

design as it ensures that any conclusion of non -inferiority from the trial is a reflection of the 
true properties of the treatments ; that is,  it demonstrates  the assay s ensitivity of the st udy.  
However, this obviously leaves the participants without adequate analgesia in the post -
operative procedure and from an ethical perspective this is mitigated in the study design by 
[CONTACT_790058] t reatment. Although it is 
hypothesised that the investigational medicinal product ( IMP) will provide adequate analgesia 
in the study , this cannot be guaranteed , and therefore the use of rescue medication also 
addresses  the potential of reduced or lack of ef ficacy.  
Ibuprofen is an established pharmaceutical ingredient and the adverse reactions associated 
with administration of 1200  mg/24  hour (OTC doses) are well known and documented(2)(5).  The 
adverse reactions most frequently occurring with a single dose being nausea, gastrointestinal 
upset, vomiting, diarrhoea, light headedness, dizziness and headache. Rarely, more serious 
reactions have been reported including GI bleeding, ulceration and perforations, hypertension 
and renal failure. When OTC doses of ibuprofen (200 -400 mg/dose; 1200  mg/day) are taken 
for acute epi[INVESTIGATOR_789994] s gastrointestinal 
events(5).  
The specific 200mg Ibuprofen tablet to be used in this study as the active comparator 
(Treatment B) is marketed in the EU under the Nurofen brand and has  an excellent safety 
profile.   
It is not anticipated that the safety profile of ibuprofen will be altered after administration of 
multiple single doses of ibuprofen [ADDRESS_1088632] 6 days is deemed to be  sufficient 
prior to the Follow -up/Early Termination Visit to ensure adequate safety monitoring of the IMP.  
The investigation site will have adequat e set up, experience and safety measures that would 
be expected of a centre able to perform regular molar extractions. They will also have adequate 
experience in the safety monitoring of participant s post dose that would be expected in a 
clinical trial  setting.  Therefore, it is considered that the risk related to study procedures are low 
and limited to common adverse events (AEs) related to the dental procedure, administration 
of routine anaesthetics, and discomfort from vital sign  measurements.   Any subject that 
experiences immediate complications during the surgery will be excluded from the study.  
Therefore, the overall benefit -risk profile for the use of the investigational product as 
defined in this protocol is considered favourable.  
1.[ADDRESS_1088633] of the Study  
This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol and the principles set out in the 
Declaration of Helsinki. It will comply with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable re gulatory requirements.

2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
Primary Objective:  
 To evaluate the superiority of  2×[ADDRESS_1088634] initial dose.  
Key Secondary Objectives:  
 To evaluate the analgesic performance  of a total daily dose of [ADDRESS_1088635] initial dose.  
 To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets.  
Additional Secondary Objective s:

3 STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE FOR DESIGN  
This is a single centre  randomi sed, double -blind,  double dummy,  parallel group, multiple -dose, 
active and placebo -controlled efficacy study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 2×[ADDRESS_1088636] and well established postsurgical pain 
model that produces pain that is predictable in its character, duration, and intensity(6). The 
model is widely accepted and has a proven record of assay sensitivity (i.e. separating active 
drugs from each other, as well as from placebo). The model is frequently used to evaluate 
NSAID type analgesics. Results from dental pain studies are accepted by [CONTACT_3361] ( FDA) and European authorities and have been widely extrapolated to 
other general pain conditions.  
The decision to conduct the study in the [LOCATION_002] was taken as suitably qualified and 
experienced test sites could not be found in Europe .  The specific test site ha s been chosen 
to conduct the study as they have a  proven history of quality and safety  when conducting  
studies  of this type . 
The placebo products have two purposes:  
1. To mask the treatment identify for PR and IR arms  
2. Act as a control arm  
The dose of the test product is the proposed posology of the final product and the dose of the 
active comparator is the posology provided in the label of the product.

4.[ADDRESS_1088645] use a  highly effective  contraceptive method  for the entire 
duration of study participation . 
A highly effective method of birth control is defined as one which results in a low failure rate 
(i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly , such as the following : 
 Surgical sterilisation  
 Established use of oral, injected or implanted ho rmonal methods of contraception  
 Some intrauterine device s (IUDs) or intraut erine system s (IUSs) 
 Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence 
of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male 
partner should be the  sole partner for that subject]  
 True abstine nce which is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence such as  calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or post-ovulation 
methods ; declaration of abstinence for the duration of the trial;  and withdrawal are not 
accep table methods of contraception . 
4.5 Discontinuation / Withdrawal and Replacement of Subjects  
The Investigator may withdraw the subject from the study at any time. Reasons for removing 
a subject from the study include, but are not limited to:  
 AEs that in the judgement of the Investigator may cause severe or permanent harm 
(significant clinical deterioration is an AE)  
 Violation of the study protocol  
 In the Investigator’s judgement, it is in the subject’s best interest  
 Subject declines further study participatio n 
 If applicable, randomisation code is broken  
If subjects choose to prematurely stop the study prior to the scheduled discharge at Hour 24, 
safety and tolerability assessments must be performed prior to discharge, and, if possible, 
efficacy assessments sho uld be performed.

The IMP should be stored between 8 -25 °C and is not to be refrigerated or frozen.  
Temperatures must be constantly monitored and readings logged in a temperature log on 
working days.  
The temperature in the secure storage facility will be recorded using a minimum /maximum 
thermometer . If the temperature falls outside the specified range of 8 -25 °C, the Sponsor 
should be notified immediately a nd appropriate action should be agreed and documented. The 
temperature log will be reviewed by [CONTACT_216590] .  
5.7 Blinding  
This study is a double -blind, double dummy study.   There will be two placebo tablets designed 
to be comparable to each of the active products (PR and IR) in both shape, size, colour and 
weight.  
All subjects will receive [ADDRESS_1088658]’s 
treatment assignment.  
For emergency unblinding, study personnel will use the IWRS. If treatment assignment is 
unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of that subject’s treatment 
assignment without unblinding t he treatment assignments for the remaining subjects in the 
study. Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised. If a subject’s treatment 
assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from the study. The 
investigator should ma ke this decision after consultation with the medical monitor.

Screening will be acceptable and do not need to be repeated).  
6.12 Pain Intensity  
Subjects will rate their pain intensity using a numeric rating scale (NRS) from 0 -10 where 0  = no 
pain and 10 = worst pain ever  at the timepoints ment ioned on  Table [ADDRESS_1088664] will be instructed, “Stop the first stopwatch when you first 
feel any pain relief what soever. This does not mean you feel completely better, although you 
might, but when you first feel any relief in the pain you have now” (perceptible pain relief). The 
subject will also be instructed, “Stop the second stopwatch when you feel the pain relief  is 
meaningful to you” (meaningful pain relief). If the subject does not press the stopwatches within

8 SAFETY REPORTING  
8.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
An Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse e vent (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a clinical 
investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not 
necessarily have a causal relationship w ith the study procedure. An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. [ICH E6 1.2].   
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is classified as any untoward medical occurrence that:  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening  
 requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_789995]  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or  
 is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect  
In addition, important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], but may jeopardise the patient or may require intervention to 
prevent one of the other outcomes listed above should also usua lly be considered serious.  
[ICH E2A] Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_11956], 
or development of drug dependency or dru g abuse.  
Note: If the event is related to the investigational product and is both serious and unexpected, 
it is classified as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction ( S[LOCATION_003]R ). In case of 
double -blinded studies, unblinding is needed in order to dete rmine a S[LOCATION_003]R.  
8.[ADDRESS_1088685]’s 
source documents and electronic case report forms ( eCRFs). AEs can be reported 
spontaneously by [CONTACT_790059] -leading questioning or observation by [CONTACT_790054] a significant laboratory abnormality.  
All adverse events (AE) and all serious adverse events (SAEs) are collected, fully investigated 
and documented.

bruising. For the purpose s of this study, when at normal/expected magnitude, such 
occurrences wil l not be reported as AEs as they are expected and, therefore, are not 
“untoward” as in the AE standard definition.  
SAEs should be followed until resolution or stabilisation. Participants with ongoing SAEs at 
study termination will be further followed up un til recovery or until stabilisation of the disease 
after termination.  
For each AE a causality assessment of the event to the study drug must be performed. The 
relationship to IMP must be determined by [CONTACT_737] (if medically qualified) or by a 
medic ally qualified Co -Investigator.

Severity  Description  
Moderate  The AE results in some limitation of usual activities; the subject may 
experience significant discomfort  
Severe  The AE results in an inability to carry out usual activities; the subject 
may experience intolerable discomfort or pain  
 
Expectedness for each AE will be determined based on the information in Section 6.[ADDRESS_1088689] igator’s Brochur e. 
All AEs will be coded by [CONTACT_790026] -to-date version of MedDRA.  
8.3 Reporting of Adverse Events  
In the event of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE), the Investigator must report the event using 
the SAE form to the Sponsor Global Vigilance Group (GVG), by [CONTACT_790027]: 
[EMAIL_15051]  while copying in the contract res earch organisation ( CRO ) and Sponsor 
Project/Study Managers within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
The out of hours emergency phone number is +44 (0)[ADDRESS_1088690]  (IRB) of all SAEs occurring in the 
study within [ADDRESS_1088691] receives appropriate medical care.  
SAEs and non -serious AEs will be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities by [CONTACT_790028]’ requirements. The Sponsor is responsible for 
expedited reporting of all S[LOCATION_003]Rs/ SAEs to re levant authorities and IECs/ IRBs as required by 
[CONTACT_19124]. If the event requires expedited reporting,  a CIOMS (Council for International 
Organizations of Medical Sciences) form will be produced and GVG will take actions as per 
the study specific Safety Management Plan.

8.5 Overdose, Abuse, Misuse and Medication Errors  
The Sponsor defines “overdose” as the administration of a quantity of an investigational IMP 
given per administration or cumulatively, which is above the maximum recommended dose 
according to the authorised product information.  
The Sponsor defines “abuse” as the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of an 
IMP, which is intended to produce harmfu l physical or psychological effects e.g. intentional 
overdose to experience psychological effects.  
The Sponsor defines “misuse” as situations where the IMP is intentionally and inappropriately 
used not in accordance with the authorised product information.  
Overdoses, abuse, misuse are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an 
associated AE / SAE. The overdose, abuse, misuse and any associated AE / SAE will be 
captured on an AE CRF (Case Report Form) page / SAE form.  
Due t o the full inpati ent nature of this study,  in which medication doses will be supervised by 
[CONTACT_6624], cases of overdose, abuse or misuse are not expected to occur.  
Medication errors are any unintentional errors in dispensing or administration of the IMP which 
relates to:  
 Taking / being administered an incorrect IMP  
 Taking / being administered a drug by [CONTACT_790029] e.g. swallowing 
a suppository  
 The accidental administration of the IMP to a person who is not a subject within the 
study  
Medication errors  are reportable to the Sponsor irrespective of the presence of an associated 
AE / SAE. Medication errors with or without an associated AE / SAE will be captured on the 
AE CRF page / SAE form.

9 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section presents  a summary of the planned statistical analyses. A statistical analysis plan 
(SAP)  that describes the details of the analyses to be conducted  will be written  prior to 
database lock.  
Summary statistics for continuous variables will typi[INVESTIGATOR_149176], mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, summary  
statistics will typi[INVESTIGATOR_789996].  All data 
will be presented in listings.  
Baseline values are defined as the last measurements taken before dosing with study drug.  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size determination is based on the primary efficacy variable, SPI D12. According 
to Farrar 2001(1), a clinically important  improvement  in pain is represented by a 2 point  
reduction  on an 11 -point NRS. Based on a baseline pain score of 7 this corresponds to an 
approximate 30% reduction in pain. An average 2 point differen ce in pain scores between 
Ibuprofen PR and placebo  across all 14 assessments up to 12 hours  will correspond to a 
difference in SPID12 of 24 points. In a previous study(7), the pooled standard deviation (SD) 
for SPID12 was 31.65. Assuming the same variability in this study, a sample size of [ADDRESS_1088696] >90% power to detect a difference of 24 points in SPID12, between 
ibuprofen 2×[ADDRESS_1088697] differences between PR and IR, and 
to obtain a more precise estimate for this comparison, a 3:3:1 allocation ratio will be used, so 
that 120 subjects are randomised into each of the PR and IR groups.  Thus 280 subjects will 
be enroll ed into the study. 
9.2 Interim Analysis  
No interim analysis  is planned .  
9.3 Analysis Datasets  
The analysis populations include the following:

 The intent -to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects who are treated with 
study drug and who have at least 1  pain relief assessment after Time  0. The ITT 
population is the primary population for the efficacy analysis.  
 The per -protocol (PP) population will consist of al l ITT subjects who do not incur a 
major protocol violation that would challenge the validity of their data. This population 
will be utilized to evaluate the sensitivity of the primary efficacy analysis.  
 The safety population will include all subjects who a re treated with study drug. The 
safety population is the population for all safety assessments.  
9.[ADDRESS_1088699] Disposition and Characteristics  
The numbers of subjects randomised, completing, and withdrawing, along with reasons for 
withdrawal, will be tabulated ov erall and by [CONTACT_1570]. The number of subjects in each 
analysis population will be reported.  Demographic and baseline characteristics (including date 
of birth , sex, race, weight, height, BMI, medical history, and surgery duration) will be 
summarized for each treatment group and for the overall population using descriptive statistics. 
No formal statistical analyses will be performed.  
9.[ADDRESS_1088700] is between PR ibuprofen and placebo. In addition, the 
comparison between IR ibuprofen and placebo will be presented with p -values to demonstrate 
study sensitivity. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals will be used  to evaluate the 
clinical relevance of any differences between the PR and IR formulations. All treatment 
differences will be presented with 95% confidence intervals.  No P value adjustment will be 
made for multiple endpoints or multiple comparisons.  In the event of model assumptions for 
normality being violated, non -parametric methods will be used.  
Each efficacy endpoint will be summarized descriptively by [CONTACT_1570] . 
 Primary Endpoint(s)  
The primary endpoint, summed pain intensity difference (SPID) over  0 to 12 hours (SPID12) , 
will be used to compare the test product (2×300  mg ibuprofen PR tablets) against the placebo 
product . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy null hypothesis is that SPID12 for placebo is equal to SPID12 for ibuprofen 
2×[ADDRESS_1088701] (WOCF) imputation for subjects who use rescue medication. T he 
primary analysis will be based on a [ADDRESS_1088702] at the significance level of 0.05.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Analysis  
The clinical relevance of the  difference between placebo and PR ibuprofen over 12  hours after 
initial dose will be evaluated .

(SPRID12), and over 0  to 24  hours (SPRID24) after Time  0 
 Respon se to study drug ( a responder will be defined as a subject with ≥30% 
improvement in pain intensity without rescue medication  during the first 8 hours ) 
 Numeric rating scale  (NRS) pain intensity difference (PID) at each scheduled time 
point after Time  0 
 Pain intensity score at each scheduled time point  
 Pain relief score at each scheduled time point after Time  0 
 Peak pain relief  
 Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible pain relief confirmed by 
[CONTACT_789999]) using double sto pwatch  
 Time to first perceptible pain relief  
 Time to meaningful pain relief  
 Time to peak pain relief  
 Proportion of subjects using rescue medication  
 Time to first use of rescue medication   
[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Endpoint Analyses  
For continuous secondary endpoints such as pain intensity score, SPID at each scheduled 
time point, peak pain intensity, TOTPAR4, TOTPAR8, TOTPAR12, TOTPAR24, SPID4, 
SPID8, SPID24, SPRID4, SPRID8, SPRID12, and SPRID24, descriptive statistics (such as 
mean,  standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for each 
treatment regimen. P values from ANCOVA models comparing the placebo group with other 
treatment groups, including terms for treatment and a covariate for baseline pain  will be 
provided for SPID, SPRID, and TOTPAR variables, but no formal statistical inferences will be 
drawn on the basis of these tests.  In the event that normality assumptions are violated for a 
parameter, non -parametric analysis methods will be used.  
For ordinal secondary endpoints, such as pain intensity difference at each scheduled time 
point, pain relief at each scheduled time point, peak pain relief, and global evaluation of study 
drug, descriptive summaries will be provided and will include the number and per centage of 
subjects within each category for each treatment group. Nominal P  values from Fisher’s exact

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088705]. Time to onset of analgesia (measured as time to perceptible pain relief 
confirmed by [CONTACT_88965]) will be based on data collected using the double stopwatch 
method. Time to onset of analgesia will be right -censored at 8  hours for subjects who do not 
experience both perceptible pain relief and  meaningful pain relief during the 8 -hour interval 
after Time  0. The summary table s will provide the number of subjects analysed, the number of 
subjects censored, estimates for the quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
estimated median and the restricted mean estimate. P  values comparing placebo to active 
treatment from Wilcoxon or log -rank tests (as appropriate) will also be used to examine 
treatment effect.  
For time to onset of analgesia, the comparison of interest will be the ibuprofen 2× 300 mg PR 
group versus the ibuprofen 2×200  mg IR group. The summary table for this comparison will 
provide the number of subjects analysed, the number of subjects censored, estimates for the 
quartiles, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the estimated median and the restricted mean 
estimate.  
For the proportion of subjects who are responders and  the proportion of subjects using rescue 
medication, logistic regression model s that adjust for baseline intensity and/or significant 
demographic variables, if appropriate, will be used to evaluate the treatment effect .   
For the responder analysis , subjec ts will be censored at 8 hours and for the use of rescue 
medication /time to first rescue  subjects will be censored at 24 hours.  
9.6 Safety Analyses  
 Safety Endpoint(s)  
 Incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
 Incidence of  changes in vital sign me asurements  
[IP_ADDRESS] Safety Endpoint Analyses  
Data listings will be provided for protocol -specified safety data. The Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (Version  19.0 or higher) will be used to classify all AEs with 
respect to system organ class an d preferred term. Adverse event summaries will include only 
TEAEs, which will be summarized for each treatment group.  
For vital sign measurements, descriptive statistics will be provided at each scheduled time 
point for each treatment group. Changes from Baseline for vital signs will be calculated for 
each subject, and descriptive statistics will be provided on changes in vital signs from Baseline 
for each treatment group at each scheduled time point after Baseline. No formal statistical tests 
will be perf ormed.

9.7 Handling of Missing Data and Drop -outs 
Missing pain assessments for all efficacy analyses will be handled as follows:  
 Missing pain assessments scheduled before the first observed assessment will be 
imputed with the subject’s worst observed pain asse ssment.  
 Missing intermediate pain assessments will be replaced by [CONTACT_229091].  
 Missing pain assessments at the end of the observation period due to premature 
discontinuation of pain assessments will be imputed by [CONTACT_790060].  
 
The primary analysis will use windowed worst observation carried forward (WOCF) 
methodology for subjects who use rescue medication. Any pain measurements taken during a 
period of time in which rescue medication is active (4 hour s) will be replaced by [CONTACT_790048]. A sensitivity analysis will also be 
performed, in which all pain assessments recorded after the first dose of rescue medication 
has been taken will be disregarded and the rules outlined above will be used for missing data.  
 
All data for assessments other than pain assessments will be analysed as collected; missing 
data due to premature termination or any other reason will be l eft as missing . In the event of a 
notable difference between treatment groups in the number of subjects using rescue 
medication, other sensitivity analyses may be performed. These will be detailed in the 
Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP). 
 
9.[ADDRESS_1088707] KEEPI[INVESTIGATOR_1645]  
10.1 Case Report Forms (CRFs)  
Data will be recorded in an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). For each enrolled study 
subject an eCRF is maintained. The Investigator or designees is responsible for the quality of 
the data record in the eCRF. eCRFs must be kept current to reflect subject status at each 
phase during the course of study. Subjects must not be identified in the eCRF by [CONTACT_790049].  
In the eCRF subjects will be identified by a subject number in combina tion with date of birth 
only, i.e., not by [CONTACT_767490]. eCRF entries must be completed by [CONTACT_790061]. A log of trained and authorised staff able to complete the eCRF will be kept.

 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL  
Study No: 5003601  Protocol Version: [ADDRESS_1088708]  2018, draft 
Version  0.17 Page 58 of 63 
 
D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088709]. The investigator and study mo nitor will identify 
the data that will be recorded directly on the eCRF and for this data the eCRF will be considered 
the source document (i.e ., no prior written or electronic record of the data). The study monitor 
will document this at the screening and i t will also be documented in the Data Management 
Plan.  
Source documents will include notes taken at the site and will include data such as 
demographic data, participation in study and ICF, medical history, SAEs, AEs and concomitant 
medication, results of examinations and assessments.  
Where source data are in the form of a computer print out (e.g. medical records, laboratory 
data) they will be signed and dated by [CONTACT_790034], confirming that 
the print out is a true and faithful rec ord of the data for that subject. These print -outs will be 
filed in the study files.  
The Investigator agrees to provide direct access to source data for study -related monitoring, 
audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s). Direct access to source dat a requires that the 
subject gives written, documented consent to this.  
10.3 Data Management  
The data management group at Premier Research will be responsible for data management 
and eCRF activities.  
Full details regarding data management will be described with in the Data Management Plan.  
10.4 Reporting of Protocol Deviations  
Site staff should make the study monitor aware of any deviation from the protocol as soon as 
possible after occurrence. Waivers for inclusion / exclusion criteria are not allowed.  
10.5 Retention of Essential Documentation  
The Investigator should retain all essential documents (as defined in ICH E6 or according to 
other national and international regulations) until at least 5 years after the completion of the 
study  (defined as  last subject last visit in the study ). These documents should be retained for 
a longer period, however, if required by [CONTACT_195843]. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator 
when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
Subject files and other source data must be kept for the maximum period of time  permitted by 
[CONTACT_718162] . The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of the retention period if this is 
shorter than described abov e.

11 QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
11.1 Monitoring  
The Sponsor will organise regular monitoring visits to be performed at intervals agreed with 
the Investigator. The anticipated monitoring frequency will be stated in the Monitoring Plan. 
Monitoring will also involve, as appropriate, correspondence and telephone contacts.  
On-site monitoring includes source data verification (SDV) which is the procedure whereby [CONTACT_790035]. It will be performed in such a way as to preserve subject confidentiality, taking 
into account all ethical and legislative requirements.  
The Investigator, or a designated member of the Investigator’s staff, must be available at some 
time during the monitoring visit to review the data and resolve any queries and to allow direct 
access to the subject’s records for SDV).  
SDV will include as a minimum verification for all subjects, subject identity ( date of birth, sex, 
initials and subject number), record of entry into the study and signature [CONTACT_208318]. In addition, details of SAEs in the subject’s notes will be verified. Details included in 
the subject’s notes as a minimum:  
 Study number, brief description or title of study  
 Date that th e subject gave written consent  
 All visit dates  
 All SAEs  
 All concomitant medications  
At a site visit the eCRFs should be complete and available in order that the accuracy of their 
completion may be checked. Each completed eCRF for each subject must be signe d 
electronically by [CONTACT_737], to verify the data and statements submitted. Similarly, all 
alterations on paper records must be initialled and dated by [CONTACT_29517] a designated 
person, explained as necessary, with the original mistake left l egible .

As soon as the Investigator is notified of a planned inspection by a Regulatory Authority, he / 
she must inform the Sponsor promptly and allow the Sponsor to participate in the inspection 
as permitted by [CONTACT_790036].  
11.3 Sponsor Policy on Fraud in Clinical Studi es 
In accordance with GCP, it is the Sponsor’s policy to always follow -up suspected cases of 
fraud.  
[ADDRESS_1088713]’s normal clinical treatment are performed.  The approval 
letter must contain:  
 Name [CONTACT_11277]. 
 Date of m eeting.  
 Sufficient information to identify the version of the Protocol and subject 
information/informed consent.  
 Sufficient information to identify the version of other documents reviewed.  
The investigator must also provide the Sponsor with a list of IRB members that includes each 
member’s name [CONTACT_790071].  
Any amendments to the Protocol must be submitted to the IRB for approval unless where 
necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to study subjects, and any administrative 
changes must be notifi ed.  
This study will be submitted to the applicable Regulatory Authorities. The study will only be 
undertaken when regulatory authorisation has been obtained by [CONTACT_1034] . 
The Sponsor will notify the Regulatory Authority within 90 days of the end of the study (within 
15 days if the study is terminated prematurely).  
Premier Research will notify the IRB within 90 days of the end of the study (within 15  days if 
the study is terminated prematurely).  
12.[ADDRESS_1088714] Information and Consent  
Informed consent should be obtained by [CONTACT_3553] a patient information sheet  and ICF,

D8199934 Appendix 1 – Investigational  Study Protocol  Template  v5.[ADDRESS_1088716] can enter the study before hi s/her informed consent 
has been obtained.  A sample subject ICF used in the study will be included in the clinical study 
report for this protocol.   
As part of administering the informed consent document, the Investigator must explain to each 
subject the na ture of the study, its purpose, the procedures involved, the expected duration, 
the potential risks and benefits involved, and any potential discomfort.  Each subject must be 
informed that participation in the study is voluntary and that he/she may withdra w from the 
study at any time and that withdrawal of consent will not affect his/her subsequent medical 
treatment or relationship with the treating physician.  The subject should understand the study, 
patient information sheet,  and ICF before signing and da ting the ICF.  The Investigator or 
person obtaining consent must also sign and date the form.  Each subject will be given a copy 
of the signed informed con sent and written information.  
12.3 Early / Premature  Termination of the Study  
In the unlikely event that t his study generates an excessive frequency of adverse events, 
subjects’ termination or suspension may be requested by [CONTACT_790037].  
The sponsor retains the right to terminate the study for non -safety reasons by [CONTACT_790038].  
Any decisions to terminate or suspend the study will be notified in writing to the Investigator or 
designees, the IRB, Regulatory Authority and the clinicaltrials.gov da tabase.  
If the study is terminated early, study subjects who have attended screening will be informed 
that they are no longer required and if they have any questions, they should consult the study 
site staff. For subjects who have completed the study they will not be informed that the clinical 
study has been terminated. All data collected up to the point of study termination will be used 
in an abbreviated Clinical Investigation Report.

Study designThis is a Phase 3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intravenous (IV) treatment regimen of 300 mg 
anifrolumab versus placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active, 
autoantibody-positive systemic lupus eryth ematosus (SLE) while receiving standard of care
(SOC) treatment. The study will be performed in adult sub jects aged 18 to 70 years of age.
Approximately 360 subjects receiving SOC treatment will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a fixed IV dose of 300 mg anifrolumab or placebo every 4 weeks (Q4W) for a total of 
13 doses (Week 0 to Week 48), with the primary endpoint evaluated at the Week [ADDRESS_939653] be taking either 1 or any combination of the following: oral corticosteroids (OCS), antimalarial, and/or immunosuppressants.
Randomisation will be stratified using the following factors: SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 
(SLEDAI-2K) score at screening (<10 points versus ≥10 points); Week 0 (Day 1) OCS dose

20(128)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chron ic, multisystemic, disabling autoimmune 
rheumatic disease of unknown aetio logy. Systemic lupus erythematosus predominantly affects 
women of childbearing years ( Cooper et al, 1998; Lahita, 1999 ) with a review reporting the 
female-to-male ratio in the childbearing years to be about 12:1 ( Ramsey-Goldman and Manzi, 
2000). There is substantial unmet medical need in  the treatment of SLE, particularly in 
subjects with moderate or severe diseas e. Although off-label therapy has improved 
management options in recent years, long-term prognosis remains poor for many subjects. 
Compared to the general population, the over all mortality in SLE is increased with a 
standardised mortality ratio (SMR; defined as the ratio of the number of deaths observed to 
deaths expected) of 2.4, (2.3 to 2.5 95% confidence interval [CI]) in a large international 
cohort of 9,[ADDRESS_939663]-years ( Bernatsky et al, 2006 ).
Clinical manifestations of SLE include, but are not limited to, constitutional symptoms, 
alopecia, rashes, serositis, arthritis, nephriti s, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, 
haemolytic an aemia, cognitive dysfunction and other nervous system involvement. These 
disease manifestations cause a significant burde n of illness and can lead to reduced physical 
function, loss of employment, lower health-related quality of life (QoL), and a lifespan 
shortened by [CONTACT_2902] 10 years ( ACR ad hoc committee, September 1999 ). Increased 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_692942] (OCS)
and other immunosuppressive treatments add to disease burden in SLE ( Doria and Briani, 
2008; Petri, 2001 ; Zonana-Nanach et al, 2000 ).
All of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_692943] a medical need to identify new targeted therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], particularly agents that 
may reduce the requirement for corticosteroids and cytotoxic agents.
There has been only 1 new treatment (belimu mab) for SLE approved by [CONTACT_3361] (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the approximately
[ADDRESS_939664]. Many agents 
currently used to treat SLE, such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate 
mofetil/mycophenolic acid, have not been approved for the disease. Furthermore these drugs all have well-documented safety issues and are not effective in all patients for all
manifestations of lupus. Antimalarial agents (e g, hydroxychloroquine) and corticosteroids 
may be used to control arthralgia, arthritis, and rashes. Other treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); analgesics for fever, arthralgia, and arthritis; and topi[INVESTIGATOR_692944]. It is often  difficult to taper subjects with moderate or 
severe disease completely off corticosteroids, which cause long-term morbidity and may 
contribute to early cardiovascular mortality ( Petri, 2001 ; Urowitz et al, 1976). Even small 
daily doses of 5 to 10 mg prednisone used long- term carry increased risks of side effects such 
as cataracts, osteoporosis, and coronary artery disease ( Petri, 2001 ).

21(128)Multiple lines of evidence indicate a role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the pathogenesis of 
SLE:
! Genetic polymorphisms associated with type I IFNs are associated with 
susceptibility to SLE ( Criswell, 2008 , Sigurdsson, Göring et al, 2008 ; Sigurdsson, 
Nordmark et al, 2008 ).
! High IFN- α levels and type I IFN activity have been reported in SLE ( Bengtsson et 
al, 2000 , Dall’era et al, 2005 ).
! Increased levels of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), whose transcription is induced by [CONTACT_24975] I IFNs (type I IFN signature), are prominent in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells and whole blood in approximately 60% of SLE subjects and are 
associated with greater disease activity ( Baechler et al, 2003 , Bennett et al, 2003 , 
Crow and Wohlgemuth, 2003 , Feng X et al, 2006 , Kirou et al, 2004, Kirou et al, 
2005). Transcripts induced by [CONTACT_24975] I IFN are the most overexpressed transcripts in SLE ( Yao et al, 2010).
! Proteins induced by [CONTACT_692965] ( Huang et al, 2008 , 
Hylton et al, 1986 , Okamoto et al, 2004 ).
! Overexpression of type I IFN, type I IFN signature, and proteins induced by [CONTACT_24975] I 
IFNs have been associated with greater disease activity and organ system involvement in SLE.
Subjects with high anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (a nti-dsDNA) antibody titres, 
lupus nephritis, and progressive skin rashes have high serum levels of type I IFN ( Bengtsson 
et al, 2000 ). In addition, subjects with acute skin involvement tend to have elevated IFN in 
blood and skin ( Dall’era et al, 2005 ). Skin biopsies from subjects with SLE also show
increased type I IFN signature ( Blomberg S et al, 2001 , Farkas et al, 2001 , Yao et al, 2009 ).
Proteins induced by [CONTACT_692966] (CNS)symptoms ( Okamoto et al, 2004 ).
Immune complexes containing SLE au toantibodies, such as anti-dsDNA or 
antiribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) antibodies, can activate type I IFN production ( Bengtsson et 
al, 2000 , Rönnblom and Alm, 2003). After internalisation through Fc receptors, 
autoantibody-containing immune complexes bind endosomal toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and 
toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), stimulating production of type I IFN. Type I IFN stimulates 
monocyte derived dendritic cell maturation, which promotes loss of tolerance and generation 
of autoreactive T and B cells, autoantibody production, immune complex formation, and 
further production of type I IFN, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of autoimmunity 
(Banchereau et al, 2004 , Pascual et al, 2006 , Rönnblom and Pascual, 2008 ).
With the growing evidence that type I IFNs play  an important role in autoimmune diseases 
su
ch as SLE, inhibition of the biological activity of type I IFNs with anifrolumab may, 
therefore, be a novel efficacious therapy for the treatment of SLE and its significant unmet medical need.

22(128)Anifrolumab (MEDI-546) is a human immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1 κ) monoclonal 
antibody (mAb) directed against subunit 1 of the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR1). It is 
composed of 2 identical light chains and 2 identical heavy chains, with an over all molecular 
weight of approximately 148 kDa. Anifrolumab inhibits binding of type I IFN to type I 
interferon receptor (IFNAR) and inhibits th e biologic activity of all type I IFNs. 
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
1.2.1 Rationale for study design
This is a Phase 3, multicentre, multinatio nal, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  an intravenous (IV) treatment regimen of [ADDRESS_939665] of care (SOC) treatment.
It is thought that neutralisation of IFN signalling through the human type I IFN receptor with 
anifrolumab will reduce the severity of diseas e activity in subjects with chronic, moderately to
severely active SLE, and that anifrolumab will be well tolerated when given at the proposed dose for the duration of the study.
To ensure adequate treatment, all subjects will receive SOC treatment with at least 1 of the 
following: OCS, antimalarial, or immunosuppressants, in addition to investigational product. 
This is consistent with the both the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)(Bertsias et al, 2008 ) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) ( ACR ad hoc 
committee, September 1999 ) management guidelines of moderate to severe SLE.
The study will be randomised, placebo-controlle d, and double-blind to ensure a robust design 
and minimise bias. This is the preferred design as outlined in the June 2010 FDA Guidance for 
Industry Systemic Lupus Erythematosus-Developi [INVESTIGATOR_692945] (CHMP) Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of SLE and lupus nephritis (CHMP, 
February 2015 ).
Randomisation will be stratified by [CONTACT_522100] 
2000 (SLEDAI-2K, see  score at screening (<10 points versus ≥10 points), Day 1 
OCS dose (<10 mg/day versus ≥10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent), and the results of the 
IFN test (high versus low). Stratification is implemented in order to minimise the risk for 
baseline imbalance(s) across treatment arms  on potentially confounding variables. Baseline 
imbalances of these factors could impact efficacy and/or safety assessments of anifrolumab 
versus placebo.

23(128)1.2.2 Rationale fo r primary endpoint selection
The primary outcome measure is the proportion of subjects achieving the British Isles Lupus 
Assessment Group-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response at Week 52.
The BICLA is driven by [CONTACT_692967]-2004 score, which measures 
organ-specific activity ( Wallace et al 2011 ). The BILAG-2004 incorporates a comprehensive, 
organ-specific, 97-question assessment, which requires the Investigator to score organ 
manifestations as improving, same, worse, or new over the previous 4 weeks. The scores (A, 
B, C, D) derived from the assessments (improving, same, worse, or new) will determine whether further treatment is needed to resolv e disease activity. The change in treatment does 
not determine the scoring ( Yee et al 2009 ). The BICLA was used as the primary endpoint in a 
Phase 2b ( Wallace et al 2014 ) and in a Phase 3 SLE trial of epratuzumab ( Clowse et al 2017 ). 
It was also used as a secondary endpoint in th e anifrolumab Phase 2b study and the Phase [ADDRESS_939667] as suggested 
in the anifrolumab Phase 2b study and th e Phase 3 study D3461C00005, the BICLA was 
chosen as the primary endpoint.
1.2.3 Rationa le for dose selection
The selection of a dose of 300 mg anifrolumab every 4 weeks (Q4W) for this study is based 
on safety and efficacy results from the interim analysis of a Phase 2b study where 2 doses of 
anifrolumab (300 mg and 1000 mg) are evaluated relative to placebo as w ell as dose-response 
modelling and simulation. In the interim analys is of the Phase 2b study, clinically meaningful 
benefit was observed with the 300 mg dose, with no incremental benefit at 1000 mg, see Section 1.3for details. In addition, a higher proportion of subjects reporting Herpes zoster
reactivations was observed at 1000 mg compared to 300 mg. Given the comparable efficacy 
between the 300 and 1000 mg anifrolumab doses and the increased frequency of Herpes 
zoster events in the 1000 mg dose group relative to the 300 mg dose group, the benefit:risk 
profile appears to favour the 300 mg dose. Further, from the PK/efficacy model, minimal improvement in efficacy was predicted for doses  higher than 300 mg, consistent with the 
observed Phase 2b study interim analysis data. The model also predicted that doses lower than 
300 mg will result in lower efficacy since trough concentrations (C
trough) from doses lower 
than 300 mg will fall below the model-predicted concentrations corresponding to 80% of maximum SRI(4) efficacy. The non-linear PK propert ies of anifrolumab cause a large increase 
in C
trough variability at doses below [ADDRESS_939668] very rapid clearance and negligible exposure to anifrolumab. For these reasons, the selection of a dose of 300 mg anifrolumab is justified for this study.
A companion 3-arm study (D3461C00005) evaluating the efficacy, safety, and PK of 
anifrolumab is being conducted to verify that a lower dose (150 mg) of anifrolumab will be suboptimal.

25(128)1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
A detailed up-to-date assessment of the overall risk/benefit of anifrolumab is discussed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
There is significant unmet medical need for the treatment of subjects with chronic, moderately
to severely active SLE. Since type I IFNs have a role in SLE, a therapy such as anifrolumab, 
that targets type I IFN receptors, may be beneficial in the treatment of these subjects.
Anifrolumab has been or is being investigated in 5 MedImmune/[COMPANY_008]-sponsored 
clinical studies in adult subjects with systemic sclerosis or SLE as follows: 
! Study MI-CP180 was a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of single and 
multiple IV doses of anifrolumab in adult subjects with systemic sclerosis (completed study). 
! Study CD-IA-MEDI-546-1013 is an ongo ing Phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study of anifrolumab (300 and 1000 mg) in adult subjects with 
moderately to severely active SLE (o ngoing at the time of writ ing this protocol).
! Study CD-IA-MEDI-546-11 45 is the ongoing open-label extension (OLE) for 
subjects completing Study CD-IA-MED I-546-1013 (ongoing at the time of writing 
this protocol).
! Study D3461C00002 is an ongoing study in Japanese adult subjects with SLE
(ongoing at the time of writ ing this protocol).
! Study D3461C00007 is an ongoing study in adult subjects with lupus nephritis 
(ongoing at the time of amending this protocol). 
Study CD-IA-MEDI-546-1013 is a Phase 2b, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy and sa fety of anifrolumab in adult subjects with 
chronic, moderately to severely active SLE with an inadequate response to SOC treatment for 
SLE. Subjects were randomised 1:1:1 to placebo, anifrolumab 300 mg or anifrolumab 
1000 mg while continuing their SOC treatment. Enrolment in the study is complete. An interim analysis (including the analysis of the primary endpoint) was conducted after all 
subjects completed the Day [ADDRESS_939669] (2 subjects discontinued from the study prior to dosing). 
Efficacy in anifrolumab Phase 2b study
The primary efficacy endpoint of the Phase 2b study was the proportion of subjects achieving 
response in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Re sponder Index (4) (SRI[4]) with sustained 
reduction of OCS (<10 mg/day and less than or equal to the dose received on Day 1 by [CONTACT_2006] 85 
and maintained between Days 85 and 169) at Day 169. There were higher proportions of 
subjects in the 300 mg (34.3%) and 1000 mg (28.8%) anifrolumab groups than in the placebo 
(17.6%) group who met the primary endpoint at Day 169. Similar results were also observed 
in the other co-primary population, the IFN test-high subjects (representing approximately

26(128)75% of the study population) but not in the IFN test-low subjects at Day 169 (it is important to 
note that the sample size is low in this subpopulation). Further, compared to the placebo 
group, numerically higher proportions of s ubjects in the anifrolumab groups met the
secondary endpoints of SRI(4) with sustained reduction of OCS (<10 mg/day and less than or 
equal to the dose received on Day 1 by [CONTACT_2006] 281 and maintained between Days 281 and 365) at Day 365 (placebo [25.5%], 300 mg [51. 5%] and 1000 mg [38.5%]) and reduction of 
background OCS dose to ≤7.5 mg/day at Day 365 in those taking ≥10 mg/day at baseline 
(placebo [26.6%], 300 mg [56.4%], and 1000 mg [31.7%]).
The efficacy observed with the primary and secondary endpoints was supported by a wide 
range of evidence. A numerically higher proportion of subjects receiving anifrolumab met SRI 
response criteria without the OCS taper requirement at Day 169 and Day 365 compared to 
placebo. Furthermore, compared to the placebo group numerically higher proportions of anifrolumab treated subjects achieved SRI(5), SRI(6), SRI(7), and SRI(8) response, as well as 
BICLA response.
Higher response rates were also observed in organ specific measures fo r anifrolumab-treated 
subjects compared with placebo. In subjects with moderate or severe skin disease (Cutaneous 
Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index [CL ASI] activit y score ≥10) at 
baseline, a numerically higher proportion of subjects achieved at least 50% improvement from 
baseline in the CLASI activity score following an ifrolumab treatment co mpared to subjects 
receiving placebo. In subjects with moderate or severe arthritis ( ≥8 swollen and tender joints) 
at baseline, a numerically highe r proportion of subjects treated with [ADDRESS_939670] 50% improvement in swo llen and tender jo int counts compared to subjects 
treated with placebo.
Amongst subjects with a dose of ≥10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent at baseline, a 
numerically higher proportion of subjects in the 300 mg anifrolumab group than in the 
placebo group were able to reduce OCS to ≤7.5 mg/day prednisone or equivalent by [CONTACT_2006] 169. 
Similar results were seen at Day 365. No apparent differences were seen when comparing the 
[ADDRESS_939671] component of complement (C 3) levels at baseline, those treated with 
anifrolumab demonstrated a numerically larger in crease from baseline in C3 levels at Day 169 
and 365 than those who were treated with placebo.
Expression of type I IFN-inducible genes in whole blood using a 21-gene panel 
(pharmacodynamic [PD] marker) decreased following anifrolumab administration for all dose 
groups in subjects with a baseline positive t ype I IFN signature [CONTACT_679101]. Both the 
300 mg and 1000 mg anifrolumab dose achieved and maintained 82 to 90% neutralisation of 
the gene signature. In the placebo group no neutralisation of the gene signature (>6%) was 
observed at any time point.

27(128)Safety experience in anifrolumab Phase 2b study through August 2014 
Although the safety profile for anifrolumab is acceptable, an imbalance was seen in the rate of 
occurrence of uncomplicated Herpes zoster reactivation.
The overall number of subjects with adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs) and 
adverse events of special interest (AESIs) (new or reactivated tuberculosis [TB], malignancy, 
infusion or hypersensitivity or anaphylactic r eaction and non SLE-related vasculitis) were 
similar between the placebo and anifrolumab groups. Serious adverse events related to the 
investigational product were observed in 5.9% of the subjects in the placebo, 3.0% in the 
300 mg and 1.0% in the [ADDRESS_939672] were observed in 7.9% in the placebo, 3.0% in 
the 300 mg and 9.5% in the 1000 mg anifrolumab group. There was 1 death in the 1000 mg 
anifrolumab group (acute colitis) and none in the other 2 treatment groups.
There was a higher number of subjects with infection-related AEs in both the 300 mg (63.6%) 
and 1000 mg (61.9%) anifrolumab groups compared with the placebo group (51.5%). This 
was due primarily to more reports of uncomplicated cases of Herpes zoster in the anifrolumab 
treated subjects (300 mg: 5.1%; 1000 mg: 9.5%) compared to placebo (2.0%). Importantly, 
subjects with Herpes zoster infection responded to standard antiviral treatment. One 
treatment-emergent SAE of transverse myelitis  with a positive varicella zoster virus 
polymerase chain reaction in cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_692946]. The subject recovered 
following treatment with pulsed ste roid and standard antiviral medication.
There was a higher number of subjects with infections reported as influenza in the 
anifrolumab groups (300 mg: 6.1%; 1000 mg: 7.6%) compared to placebo (2.0%); however,
the protocol did not require objective evidence confirming the aetiology of these infections.
Infusion-rel ated reactions were observed in 5.9% of placebo treated subjects: 2.0% in the 
300 mg anifrolumab group and 3.8% in the 1000 mg anifrolumab group. The characteristics 
and severity of these reactions were similar in all 3 treatment groups.
Overall benefit:risk assessment 
Anifrolumab demonstrated a clinically relevant bene fit in subjects with moderate to severe 
SLE treated with SOC. The efficacy was supported by a broad range of clinical measures of 
global (various levels of SRI responses, BICLA) and organ specific disease activity (CLASI, joint count). A clinically relevant increase in the proportion of subjects achieving pre-
specified corticosteroid reduction in the 300 mg group was also observe d compared with 
placebo, while no apparent difference was observed comparing the 1000 mg group and 
placebo.
Anifrolumab was generally well tolerated. A dose-related increase in the number of subjects 
with uncomplicated Herpes zoster infections was observed in subjects receiving anifrolumab 
compared with placebo. To date, in clinical trials  of anifrolumab, hypersensitivity events or 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid events have not occurred more frequently in subjects who were

28(128)treated with anifrolumab as compared to placebo, although careful monitoring for such events 
will continue.
The administration of any foreign protein may be associated with acute allergic reactions that
may be severe, and may result in death. Acute allergic reactions may include hypotension, 
dyspnoea, cyanosis, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, and 
unresponsiveness. Reports of infusion-related reactions from clinical trials conducted to date suggest that the frequency, severity and characteristics of these reactions are similar across all 
treatment groups.
Although anifrolumab is a human monoclonal antibody, subjects can develop 
anti-anifrolumab antibodies that may neutralise  the activity of the drug or may be associated 
with acute or delayed hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis. Subjects will be monitored for clinical manifestations that may be  associated with the formation of specific 
antibodies to anifrolumab generated during the study, as well as for the presence of such 
antibodies.
In this study, anifrolumab will be admin istered at a fixed IV dose of 300 mg Q4W for 
52 weeks, equivalent to the lower dose in the Phase 2 study (CD-IA-MEDI-546-1013).
Anifrolumab has been generally well tolerated to date with no dose-r elated safety signal 
observed with the exception of an imb alance in observed even ts of uncomplicated Herpes 
zoster infections. 
In order to minimise the risk of treatment with anifrolumab, subjects with risk factors for 
serious infection, malignancy, or immune def iciency disorders are specifically excluded from 
participation.
Serious infections, including non-opportunistic serious infections, opportunistic infections, 
anaphylaxis, malignancy, Herpes zoster , TB (including latent TB), influenza, vasculitis (non 
SLE), and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (including stroke, myocardial 
infarction [MI], or cardiovascular death) are designated as AESIs in this study. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events are also designated as AESIs. An external independent 
adjudication co mmit tee will assess all deaths and cardiovasc ular SAEs to determine if they 
meet criteria for MACE (stroke, MI, or cardiovascular death). Specific details will be 
addressed in a cardiovascular event adjudication charter. There have been no imbalances in reporting rates of MACE or other non-MACE cardiovascular events observed either with 
anifrolumab or other agents sharing a similar mechanism of action compared to 
controls/placebo to date. However, since accelerated coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular accidents are recognised comp lications of SLE, the adjudication process is 
put in place to support rigorous signal detection activity across treatment arms. 
Compared to the general population, subjects wi th SLE have a higher rate of depression and 
suicide. Therefore, sub jects w ill be screened for suicidality and those who are at high risk at 
baseline will be excluded from participation in the study.

29(128)In order to provide an independent periodic review of safety throughout the trial, in addition to 
the ongoing, blinded review provided by [CONTACT_221422], an independent Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review blinded and unblinded safety data on a regular 
basis throughout the study (see Section 6.10.1 ).
In conclusion, [COMPANY_008] believes that the available nonclinical and clinical data indicate an acceptable safety profile for anifrolumab. The proposed dosing regimens for Protocol D3461C0004 are adequately justified and the management plan for potential risks associated 
with anifrolumab is appropriate. The emerging sa fety profile has not identified any risks that 
would preclude continued investigation of anifrolumab. [COMPANY_008] believes that 
anifrolumab continues to demonstrate an overall positive benefit-risk balance to support its 
further clinical evaluation in subjects with active SLE.
1.4 Study design 
This is a Phase 3, multicentre, multinatio nal, randomised, double-b lind, placebo-controlled 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of  an IV treatment regimen of 300 mg anifrolumab 
versus placebo in adult subjects with moderately to severely active, autoantibody-positive 
SLE while receiving SOC treatment. The study will be performed in adult subjects aged 18 to 70 years of age.
Approximately 360 subjects receiving SOC treatment will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive a fixed IV dose of 300 mg anifrolumab  or placebo Q4W for a total of 13 doses 
(Week 0 to Week 48) with the primary endpoint evaluated at the Week [ADDRESS_939673] be taking either 1 or any combination of the following: OCS, antimalarial, or 
immunosuppressants. Specific medication restrictions are contained in the eligibility criteria 
and Section 3.3. See Figure 2 for an outline of the study design.
Randomisation will be stratified using the following factors: 
! SLEDAI-2K score at scr eening (<10 points versus ≥10 points)
! Week 0 (Day 1) OCS dose (<10 mg/day versus ≥10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent)
! Results of the IFN test (high versus low)
This study includes:! A Screening Period : Up to 30 days 
! Treatment Period : A 52-week double-b lind treatment period with investigational 
product administration Q4W from Week 0 to Week 48 for a total of 13 doses 
! At Week 52, subjects will have 2 options:
- If eligible, enrol into the long-term extension (LTE) st udy

Week 12, subjects may receive only [ADDRESS_939676] of corticosteroids for an increase in SLE disease 
activity or to control non-SLE re lated disease (eg, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease [COPD] exacerbation). Subjects receiving more than [ADDRESS_939677] 12 weeks 
of treatment will be considered non-responders for subsequent assessments of disease activity
(details are defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan [SAP]), regardless of the reason for the burst (SLE or non-SLE activity). 
1.4.2 Protocol -specified steroid tapering
An important secondary objective in this study is assessing whether anifrolumab improves the 
ability to reduce corticosteroid dose in patients to < 7.5 mg prednisone or equivalent per day. 
For this reason, steroid tapering to a target OCS dose of ≤7.5 mg/day must be attempted in all 
subjects with a baseline OCS dose ≥10.0 mg/day. This will commence at Week [ADDRESS_939678] 1 of the following criteria is met:
! SLEDAI-2K activity which is worsened compared to baseline in major organ systems (renal, CNS, cardiopulmonary, vasculitis, fever, thrombocytopenia, or haemolytic an aemia, or gastrointestinal activity)
! Newly-affected organ system(s) based on the SLEDAI-2K, excluding serological abnormalities (dsDNA antibodies, hypocomplementemia) 
! Moderate to severe skin disease as reflected by a CLASI activity score of ≥10 
! Moderate to severe arthritis disease as reflected by [CONTACT_692968] ≥8 tender 
and/or swollen joints
A recommended steroid-tapering regimen is provided in  but Investigators will 
have flexibility in how the OCS dose is reduced  at each visit. If steroid tapering is not 
attempted in an eligib le subject, the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee must be contact[CONTACT_35857].
Investigators will not be required, but may c ontinue, to taper OCS dose beyond the target of 
7.5 mg/day up to Week [ADDRESS_939679] being considered
a non-responder for subsequent assessments of disease activity (details are defined in the

Investigator(s) should keep a record of subjects considered for, and included in the study. The 
pre-screening/screening log will be evaluated periodically during routine monitoring visits.
The Investigator(s) will:
1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential subject before any study-specific
procedures are performed. The subject is considered enrolled when the ICF is
signed and the enrolment call is done in the interactive voice/web response system(IXRS).
2. Assign potential subject a unique enrolment number, beginning with .
3. Determine subject eligibility. During screeni ng, the Disease Activity Adjudication
Group (see Section 5.2.2 ) will confirm eligibility criteria based on the data captured
in the electronic data capture (EDC) sys tem and from the Central Laboratory. Sites
will be notified to either randomise or screen fail the subject.
4. On Day 1, the Investigator will confirm that all eligibility criteria st ill are fulf illed
(including that the “Clinical” SLEDAI-2K score is ≥4 points [see Inclusion
Criterion No. 9for “Clinical SLEDAI-2K” definition], OCS dose has been stable
for the last 2 weeks) and will then perform the randomisation transaction in the
IXRS.
5. At randomisation the IXRS will assign eligible subjects a unique randomisation
code and blinded investigational product kit number(s) to the subject.
Specific information concerning the use of the IXRS will be provided in the separate user 
manual. 
Block randomisation using an IXRS will be used  to randomise subjects in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive a fixed IV dose of 300 mg anifrolu mab or placebo. [COMPANY_008] Biostatistics group is 
responsible for generating the randomisation scheme for this study using the GRand system.The randomisation will be stratified using the following factors: 
! SLEDAI-2K score at screening (<10 points versus ≥10 points)
! Week 0 (Day 1) OCS dose (<10 mg/day versus ≥10 mg/day prednisone or
equivalent)
! Results of the IFN test (high versus low)
Investigational product (anifrolumab or placebo) should, if possible, be administered the same 
day the investigational product kit number is assigned.

investigational product allocation. Instructions for unblinding an individual subject’s 
investigational product allocation are contained in the IXRS manual. The Investigator should 
promptly document and explain any premature unblinding to the S ponsor, without revealing 
the treatment given to patient to the Sponsor. In general, unblinding should only occur if 
management of the medical emergency would be different based on the subject having 
received investigational product. In the majority of cases, the management of a medical emergency would be the same whether or not investigational product was received by [CONTACT_1560]. If this was the case, the investigational product allocation should not be unblinded.
[COMPANY_008] or its designee retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected 
and are suspected to be causally related to an  investigational product and that potentially 
require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. T reatment codes will not be broken for 
the planned analyses of data until all decisions  on the evaluability of the data from each 
individual subject have been made and documented.
Subjects who have been unblinded by [CONTACT_153248] (and who have 
not been unblinded to the Investigator or Medical Monitor) will not, based on the unblinding alone, be discontinued from further receipt of investigational product.
3.6.[ADDRESS_939719]
An independent DSMB will review safety data throughout the study. The DSMB will be 
provided with partially unblinded data (data that are summarised by  [CONTACT_153249]). The DSMB may choose to unblind the data for additional review as specified in the DSMB charter. The Sponsor and the study team at PRA will remain 
blinded to all data transfers provided to the DSMB. Details about the DSMB will be included 
in the DSMB Charter. For further details on the DSMB, see Section 6.10.1 .

Additional restrictions related to concomitant medications are discussed in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
Subjects who are permanently discontinued fro m further receipt of investigational product, 
regardless of the reason (withdrawal of consent, due to an AE, other), will be identified as 
having permanently discontinued treatment, and will not be eligible for the LTE study.
3.7.[ADDRESS_939722] may also refus e to continue any further study observation.
3.7.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time (investigational product and 
assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.
A subject who withdraws consent will always be asked about the reason(s) (see Section 3.7) 
and the presence of any AEs. The Investigator will follow-up AEs outside of the clinical 
study.
If a subject withdraws from participation in th e study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced.

following attempts to contact [CONTACT_153252]: 
! Either phone calls, faxes or emails, and
! Having sent 2 registered letters/certified mail, and
! One attempt to check the status of the sub ject using publicly available sources, if 
allowed by [CONTACT_427]
“Lost to follow-up” as a reason for study discontinuation must be documented by [CONTACT_692972], emails, text messages, numbers called, individuals spoken to if not 
subject, and documentation that 2 certified/registered letters were sent.

and complete a minimum of 12 weeks of follow-up), regardless of the number of doses of 
investigational product that were received. The end of the study (“study completion”) is 
defined as the date of the last protocol-specified visit/assessment for the last subject in the 
study.
3.7.[ADDRESS_939726] should be encouraged to continue to undergo all study-related 
visits/procedures for the full treatment period ( Table 3 ) in order to support the final efficacy 
and safety analysis for anifrolumab (see Section 8). The reason for premature discontinuation 
of investigational product will be documented in the source documents and recorded in the CRF.
It is essential to collect as much data as possible for all subjects throughout the study and 
especially all potential endpoint events. Complete withdrawal from the study (ie, withdrawal 
of consent) has a direct negative impact on the potential validity of all study data and should 
be avoided wherever possible. If the subject permanently discontinues investigational product 
prior to their completion of the study and wi shes to continue with only selected study 
assessments; prioritised assessments are listed in Section 4.2.[ADDRESS_939727] the reason for study with drawal recorded as “Eli gibility Criteria Not 
Fulfilled” (ie, subject does not meet the required in clusion/exclusion criteria). This reason for 
study withdrawal is only valid for screen f ailures (not randomised subjects). Rescreening of a 
subject will be per mitted once.
3.9 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of the Sponsor, trial subjects are placed at undue 
risk because of clinically significant findings that:
! Meet individual stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_103414] (see 
Section 3.7for reasons for discontinuation of investigational product)
! Are assessed as causally related to study drug 
! Are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for subjects at the time of discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the CRF.

67(128)4.1 Enrolment/Screening Period
At Screening, subjects are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria. Once the 
subject signs the informed consent, they are c onsidered enrolled in the study. Subjects who do 
not meet these criteria must not be randomised into the study.
Screening procedures will be performed according to the Screening Study Plan ( Table 2 ), 
from Day -[ADDRESS_939732] may be ra ndomised. There does not need to be 30 days 
between screening and Week 0 (Day 1).Chest x-rays and Pap smears may be completed anytime during the screening period as long 
as all results have been reviewed by [CONTACT_692974]. 
If a subject does not meet eligibility criteria on th e basis of a laboratory value then the 
laboratory value may be repeated once within the screening period.
4.1.1 Other considerati ons for screening
[IP_ADDRESS] Oral e xamination
In several biological programs there have been serious infections and/or death related to 
Ludwig’s angina. Although this has not been seen in the anifrolumab program, Investigators 
should check a subject’s oral cavity and review their dental health carefully during the screening process. While a dental examination is not required prior to enrolment in this study, 
Investigators are cautioned to consider carefully whether subjects have active caries or a 
dental infection that might impact on subject safety prior to enrolment.
[IP_ADDRESS] Mammography
As subjects with SLE have impaired immune response, are treated with immunosuppressants,
and are at potential risk for malignancy, it is recommended that patients enrolled into the 
study are compliant and up to date with lo cal recommendations for mammography or other 
screening procedures for breast cancer.
4.1.[ADDRESS_939733] randomisation need not be repeated during the re-screen visit.

68(128)4.2 Treatment Period
Procedures during the Treatment Period w ill be pe rformed according to the Treatment Period 
Study Plan (Table 3 ), from Week 0 (Day 1) to Week 52. The subject-reported outcome
assessments should be completed by [CONTACT_423] (unassisted by [CONTACT_221349], family members or 
friends) prior to all other evaluations, and prior to  the infusion, as disease assessments/clinical 
evaluations may confound the results. 
Before scheduling the Week 0 (Day 1) visit, ensure notification from the Disease Activity 
Adjudication Group has been received, confirming that subject meets adjudicated eligibility 
criteria (Inclusion Criterion No. 9). The Disease Activity Adjudication Group will review all 
data necessary to characterise subject SLE in relation to the SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004, and 
PGA assessments (including central laboratory results).
On Day 1, ensure subject meets eligibility criteria, including Day 1 assessments according to 
the Treatment Period Study Plan ( Table 3 ).
Subjects confirmed to be eligible will be randomised. Subjects will have scheduled visits at 4-week intervals to complete protocol-specified 
assessments and investigational product administration according to the Treatment Period Study Plan ( Table 3 ).
The last dose of investigational product will be administered on Week 48. At Week 52, subjects will have an End of Treatment (EOT) visit. For subjects who prematurely discontinue investigational product and are not willing to continue to participate in the study refer to 
Section 3.7.
4.2.[ADDRESS_939734] should complete the EDV (Week 52) visit within [ADDRESS_939735], as well as Follow-up Visit 1 and Follow-up Visit 2 (8 and 12 weeks 
after the EDV visit) unless consent is withdra wn. If the subject is unwilling to continue with 
any study visits, including EDV, at a min imum, the following assessments should be 
completed:
! SLEDAI-2K and the associated laboratory tests (anti-dsDNA antibodies, C3, C4, 
CH50)
! BILAG-2004 and the associated laboratory  tests (anticardiolipin, lupus 
anticoagulant, haptoglobin, and Coombs [Coombs will be performed as applicable 
per BILAG assessment requirements]). Note: In order to avoid having to bring the 
subject back for a separate phlebotomy, the ant icardiolipin, l upus anticoagulant, and 
haptoglobin blood specimens will be collected at all sp ecified visits, however the 
blood will be stored at the central laboratory and the analyses performed only if the Investigator indicates that these tests need to be completed because of clinical

! Vital signs
! Physical examination, weight
! Adverse events including AESIs
! Cardiovascular risk assessment
! TB questionnaire
! Concomitant medications
If the subject does not agree to do this, they will be asked if they can be followed on a 
monthly basis via telephone calls. At these calls, they will be asked about AEs/SAEs, lupus symptoms, and lupus medications. Steroid bursts will also be captured. 
Adverse events will be followed up per Section 6.6.[ADDRESS_939736] presents for an unscheduled visit in lieu of a regularly scheduled visit (ie, the 
subject is seen for safety and efficacy assessments when a regularly scheduled dosing or 
follow-up visit is missed), the Investigator should complete all possible safety and efficacy assessments applicable to the missed visit. Unscheduled efficacy assessments should not be 
collected in between completed regular study visits.

5.2 Efficacy assessments
Efficacy measurements will be made at the times indicated in the Study Plan (see Table 2 for 
assessments to be performed at Screening, Table 3 for Treatment Period, and Table 4 for 
Follow-up). Subject-reported outcome assessments should be completed by [CONTACT_423], unassisted by [CONTACT_221349], family members or friends.
5.2.1 Training and certif ication for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus assessments
In order to maintain consistent evaluation of SLE disease activity across study sites, training 
and certification of Investigators and designate d site personnel who will be completing the 
disease evaluations listed below will be conducted.
! SLEDAI-2K
! BILAG-2004
! PGA
! CLASI
! Swollen and tender joint count evaluation
The SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004, PGA, and CLASI must be administered by [CONTACT_692976], unless prior Sponsor approval has been obtained for any other 
clinically trained site personnel wit h documentation of adequate a ssessment experience per the 
study central review plan. The joint count evaluation can be completed by [CONTACT_692977], as per Investigator discretion, are qualified to perform the assessments and have at least 
1 year of experience administering the joint count evaluation. Training will include printed

71(128)training materials, digital video disks (DVDs) and formal presentations, as well as web-based 
training modules.
After attending study presentations (ie, Investigator Meeting) or after completion of online 
training modules, all Investigators and designated site physicians must pass an online 
examination in order to obtain certification for all disease evaluation assessments, with the 
exception of the joint count evaluation. Investigators and designated site personnel must be trained and certified prior to subjects entering screening at their respective sites. All 
assessments and certifications must be renewed via the study online training website prior to 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_153208] (not expi[INVESTIGATOR_1312]) throughout the course of the study. If there is a change in site personnel over the course of the study, new Investigators or physicians must 
be certified prior to performing the SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004, PGA, and CLASI 
assessments.
It is expected that the Investigator will ensure all joint count assessors have adequate 
experience (minimum of 1 year) and training qua lifications to perform the swollen and tender 
joint count assessment. Assessors (including any new Investigators or site personnel) must 
complete the online joint count training module and obtain certification prior to performing 
any joint assessment. 
Documentation of all training will be maintained in the site’s study f ile.
Over the course of the study, Investigator assessments for a given subject should be completed 
by [CONTACT_153291]/or certified Investigator, designated physician, or qualified site 
personnel (as described above) whenever possible.
5.2.2 Disease Activity Adjudication Group
PRA has a Disease Activity Adjudication Group who are medically-qualified individuals 
and/or support staff who assist in the ongoing management of this trial. The Disease Activity 
Adjudication Group will review all data necessary to characterise subject SLE in relation to 
the SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004, and PGA assessmen ts (including central laboratory results); 
however, the group will remain blinded for the duration of the study. Adjudication group members will have access to an independent expert on SLE disease activity indices for 
unanticipated issues with regard to interpretation of these indices.
The Disease Activity Adjudication Group will be utilised to confirm eligibility during 
screening and will be utilised throughout the study to confirm SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004, and 
PGA scoring. The Adjudication Group will also ensure that the completion of efficacy assessments by [CONTACT_692978]. 
If there is inconsistency between assessments, additional clarification and training on these 
assessments will be provided through the Disease Activity Adjudication Group.

72(128)5.2.3 Systemic Lupus Er ythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 
The SLEDAI-2K disease activity index (see ) consists of a list of organ 
manifestations, each with a definition. A certified Investigator or designated physician will 
complete the SLEDAI-2K assessment and decide whether each manifestation is “present” or 
“absent” in the last 4 weeks. The assessment also includes the collection of blood and urine for assessment of the laboratory categories of the SLEDAI-2K.
The SLEDAI-2K assessment consists of 24 lupus-rel ated items. It is a weighted instrument, in 
which descriptors are multiplied by a particular organ’s “weight”. For example, renal 
descriptors are multiplied by 4 and central nervous  descriptors by 8 and these weighted organ 
manifestations are totalled into the final score. The SLEDAI-2K score range is 0 to 105 points with 0 indicating inactive disease. The SLEDAI-2K scores are valid, reliable, and sensitive clinical assessments of lupus disease activity. The SLEDAI-2K calculated using a timeframe 
of 30 days prior to a visit for clinical and laboratory values has been shown to be similar to the 
SLEDAI-2K with a 10-day window ( Touma et al, 2010 ). A timeframe of 28 days will be used 
in this study.
The “Clinical” SLEDAI-2K score is the SLEDAI-2K assessment score without the inclusion 
of points attributable to any urine or laboratory results including immunologic measures. Its use may permit earlier clinical decisions to be made without waiting for immunologic 
measures 
However, in any circumstance where the “Clinical” SLEDAI-2K score is used, sites must subsequently update the SLEDAI-2K assessment when laboratory data become available so 
that the full SLEDAI-2K score is  made available to the Sponsor.
A quick Reference Guide will be provided to all study personnel, which contains detailed 
protocol-specific clarifications and extensions of SLEDAI-2K clinical parameter definitions 
and a guidance for correlating SLEDAI-2K and BILAG-2004 clinical parameters.
5.2.4 British Isles L upus Assessment Group-2004
The BILAG-2004 is a translational index with  9 organ systems (General, Mucocutaneous, 
Neuropsychiatric, Musculoskeletal, Cardiorespi[INVESTIGATOR_696], Gast rointestinal, Ophthalmic, Renal 
and Haematology) that is able to capture changing severity of clinical manifestations (see 
It has ordinal scales by [CONTACT_692979] a global score; rather it records 
disease activity across the different organ systems at a glance by [CONTACT_692980] 4 weeks to the 4 weeks preceding them. It is based on the principle of physicians’ 
Intention-to-Treat and categorises disease activity into 5 different levels from A to E:
! Grade A represents very active disease requiring immunosuppressive drugs and/or a 
prednisone dose of >20 mg/day or equivalent
! Grade B represents moderate diseas e activity requiring a lower dose of 
corticosteroids, topi[INVESTIGATOR_8826], topi[INVESTIGATOR_588566], antimalarials, or 
NSAIDs
! Grade C indicates mild stable disease

73(128)! Grade D implies no disease activity but the system has previously been affected
! Grade E indicates no current or previous disease activity
Although the BILAG-2004 was developed based on the principle of Intention-to-Treat, the 
treatment has no bearing on the scoring index. Only the presence of active manifestations influences the scoring.
[IP_ADDRESS] Protocol-specific clarification and extension of BILAG-2004 definitions
A quick Reference Guide will be provided to all study personnel, which contains detailed 
protocol-specific clarifications and extensions of BILAG-2004 clinical parameter definitions 
and guidance for correlating SLEDAI-2K and BILAG-2004 clinical parameters. Please refer 
to this guide when completing disease activity assessments. Important extensions of selected BILAG-2004 glossary definitions are included as follows:
Protocol-specific extensions of BILAG-2004 and SLEDAI-2K clinical parameter definitions:
(i) BILAG-2004 A or B score in the musculoskeletal organ system due to active 
polyarthritis, defined as follows:
- “BILAG-2004 A”: severe arthritis (BILAG-2004 #41) manifested by [CONTACT_310246] ≥2 joints with marked loss of functional range of movements 
and significant impairment of basic activities of daily living (ADL), that has 
been present on several days cumulatively over the past 4 weeks, including at 
the time of the Screening visit. Basic ADL are defined as the following 
activities which requi re assistance or assistive devices (at least [ADDRESS_939740] be present
and documented in source): ambulation, toileting, grooming including bathing, 
dressing, feeding oneself (not responsive to steroids up to 10 mg/day,

74(128)[IP_ADDRESS] Modified BILAG 2004
The majority of BILAG As and BILAG Bs assigned via the scoring algorithms of the BILAG 
2004 are considered a legitimate representation of clinically significant worsening disease 
activity; however, there is a feature within the BILAG-2004 Index Scoring algorithms that can 
result in an A or B assigned to a body system which had improved, and then remained at the ‘same’ level of improvement compared to previous visits. Items marked ‘same’ frequently 
warrant assignment of an A or a B category following the BILAG-2004 Index Scoring based 
on the BILAG principle of Intention-to-Treat. These are “false” A or B categories because they are not true worsening of disease activity but are due to unchanged or the same disease 
activity that has previously improved. These “false” A and B can only be determined and 
subsequently re-scored after a subject had completed a series of visits that define true state of 
SLE disease activity. 
The Disease Activity Adjudication Group will differentiate "false" A and B scores from true 
clinically significant worsening by [CONTACT_692982]-[ADDRESS_939741]’s visits. A modified BILAG-2004 Index Scoring Rules will be used. The modified BILAG rules 
and the review process and scoring as well as references used that justify the modification are 
detailed in a charter developed for this exercise.
5.2.5 Physician Glo bal Assessment 
A trained and certified Investigato r will complete the PGA (see ). The PGA
represents the physician’s overall assessment of average SLE disease severity on a VAS scale 
with 0 (no disease) to 3 (severe) disease act ivity over the last [ADDRESS_939742]’s lupus disease activity. It shoul d not reflect non-l upus

Body height will be captured at screening only. Subjects will be weighed at each study visit. 
Medically significant changes from the Screening physical examination will be recorded as 
AEs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Complete physical examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at the visits specified in the Study Plan
(Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4 ), and will include an assessment of the following: general 
appearance, head and neck, breast, respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], cardiovascular, abdomen, 
musculoskeletal/extremities, neurological, skin, lymph nodes, and thyroid.
[IP_ADDRESS] Focused physical examination
The focused physical examination will include an assessment of the organ systems required to 
complete protocol-specified assessment tools (SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004, joint count, and 
CLASI). Additional assessments should be done as clinically indicated. Abnormal findings will be recorded as part of AE, SAE, AESI, or lupus activity, as appropriate. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Pap smear
Most cases of cervical cancer appear to be related to infection with papi[INVESTIGATOR_27509]. Because 
of the potential for viral reactivation due to blockade of the interferon pathway, we are 
assessing cervical dysplasia in this study, although to date there has been no signal in the 
anifrolumab studies. 
Abnormal Pap smear results received anytime wi thin the [ADDRESS_939743] eligibility. If a Pap smear performed within 2 years prior to 
randomisation was normal with no documented malignancy (eg, CIN III, CIS, or AIS), it does not need to be repeated. Subjects with abnormal Pap smear results of atyp ical squ amous cells 
of undetermined significance (ASC-US), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_153182]-grade squamous intraepi[INVESTIGATOR_112716] (HSIL) cannot be ruled out (ASC-H), atypi[INVESTIGATOR_138955] (AGC), or CIN grades I and II (CIN I and II) will be allowed to enter the study; please refer to  
for guidance. 
Subjects should have a Pap smear between Week [ADDRESS_939744] 
received immunomodulators or immunosuppressive treatment be followed. If a Pap smear was performed between Week 48 and Week 52 and was not normal but showed no evidence of 
malignancy (eg, CIN III, CIS, or AIS), it should be repeated as per the patient’s 
gynaecologist’s recommendations. If the patient’s gynaecologist has recommended a repeat Pap smear be performed at a specified interv al, the Pap smear should be obtained as 
recommended and the report provided in the source document.

striae, central obesity, hirsutism, acne, easy bruising, and fragile skin, will be captured 
separately to evaluate whether resolution of same can occur overtime with OCS reduction.
5.3.4 Assessmen t of cardiovascular risk
To understand the contribution of the chronic inflammatory response in SLE to dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_17939]
(as a potential risk for accelerated subclinical arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease) and the 
potential effects of anifrolumab treatment, bot h lipid (including LDL and HDL, triglycerides 
[see Section [IP_ADDRESS] ]) and inflammatory profiles will be obtained during the study. Various 
risk factors for atherosclerosis will be assessed as part of the subject demographics at screening according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III Guidelines. Current and previous 
concomitant medications received for cardiovasc ular indications s hould be co llected and 
recorded.
5.3.5 Columbia Suicide Sev erity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS is a unique, simple, and short method of assessing both behaviour and ideation 
that tracks all suicidal events, and provides a summary of suicidality ( Posner et al, 2007 ). It 
assesses the lethality of attempts and othe r features of ideation (frequency, duration, 
controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide (see  
The C-SSRS will be administered at all study visits by a trained rater. The trained rater will record the clinical observation on the scale, which will be used as the source document. If at all possible, the same individual should perform the assessment at each visit to reduce scoring 
variability. In the event the primary rater is not available, a designated back-up rater who 
meets the same qualifications may perform the C-SSRS. An Investigator physician will review completed C-SSRS responses on the day of assessment and document review within the 
source. 
If a subject indicates having a rating of type [ADDRESS_939745] should be 
referred to a mental health professional immediately. If the C-SSRS is administered by a rater other than the Primary Investigator, it is recommended that the Primary Investigator confirms 
suicidal ideation before making a referral to  mental health services; however, this should not 
delay the referral.

Digital ECGs (dECG) for all subjects at all centres will be conducted at the centre using a
machine provided by [CONTACT_692984]. Digital ECGs will be performed at Screening, Randomisation, and at Visit 14 
(Week 52). Digital ECGs will be performed in triplicate at Randomisation and at Visit 14 (Week 52). Digital ECGs will be obtained after  the subject has been resting in a supi[INVESTIGATOR_206142] [ADDRESS_939748] demographics will be conducted by a
central ECG laboratory operator at the central ECG laboratory. Electrocardiogram reports will 
be provided to the study sites once the analysis is complete. It is the Investigator’s judgment 
whether the findings/results on the central ECG laboratory report are clinically relevant or not. 
5.3.8 Tubercu losis screening and monitoring
[IP_ADDRESS] Screening evaluation
A blood test for TB will be done at screening using the interferon-gamma release assay 
(IGRAs) test (ie, QuantiFERON
®-TB Gold In-Tube Test [QFT-GIT]). Evaluation of all 
subjects by [CONTACT_153265]-GIT test will be performed by [CONTACT_679074], and chest x-rays 
will be completed at screening. If an adequate (anterio-posterior and lateral or per local SOC) 
chest x-ray was performed within 12 weeks prior to signing the ICF, it does not need to be 
repeated at the Screening visit. 
Compared to culture confirmed TB, overall, 87.6% of subjects have a positive QFT-GIT result
(Cellestis, 2005 ). The false negative rate in this setting appears to be over 12%. Further, the 
performance of the test in the setting of immunosuppressant drugs has not been evaluated. Nor 
has it been evaluated in individuals with medical conditions other than, or in addition to, latent 
TB or tuberculosis disease. The guide also states that “Medical treatments or conditions that 
impair immune functions can potentially reduce IFN- γ responses and prevent detection of a 
specific response to the (secretory proteins) ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (the test stimulators)”.
Given the population to be enrolled in the SLE study, false negative tests are possible, so a 
chest x-ray is a relevant technique for detecting active pulmonary disease and minimising 
potential risk to study subjects.

80(128)[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis results from screening evaluations
! If the screening QFT-G test is negative and there is no known history of recent 
exposure to individuals with active TB, and chest radiograph shows no evidence of active TB, the subject may be randomised without prophylaxis.
! If the screening QFT-G test is newly positive and chest radiograph shows no 
evidence of active TB, and the subject has no symptoms or medical history 
consistent with active TB, the subject must have a retest, and if retest is positive, the 
subject must start on prophylaxis prior to randomisation.
! If the screening QFT-G test is positive at the initial Screening visit, but the subjectis not newly positive as of the initial Screening visit , the subject must have been 
diagnosed with latent TB and must have documentation confirming completion of appropriate treatment. Subjects with no history of latent TB prior to the initial 
Screening visit, but who are diagnosed with latent TB during screening, may be 
considered eligible if appropriate treatment is initiated prior to randomisation. Such subjects may be re-screened if necessary to allow for local guidelines on latent TB 
treatment initiation.
! If the screening QFT-G test is indeterminate, the test must be repeated at least onceby [CONTACT_153267]. 
- If the result remains indeterminate, the chest radiograph shows no evidence of 
active TB, there are no signs or symptoms of active TB, no recent contact [CONTACT_692985], and there is no history of latent (unless diagnosed with 
documentation of completion of appr opriate treatment) or active TB, the sub ject
may be randomised and will have additional QFT-G testing performed 
according to the Study Plan ( Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4 ). Additionally, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_692957], an expert specialising in TB may be consulted prior to randomisation. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Tuberculosis monitoring during the study
If, during the trial a subject who had an indeterminate TB result at screening is determined to 
have a:
! Positive QFT-G test result, the subject should be referred to a TB specialist. If a TB 
specialist is not available, the local count ry guidelines should be followed for 
further diagnostic work up and anti-TB treatment regimens. If no local guidelines exist for immunocompromised individuals, then [LOCATION_003] guidelines may be followed. This should also be reported as an AESI.
! Negative QFT-G test result, then the subject does not need to continue TB testing outlined for subjects with indeterminate results at screening
For subjects with negative QFT at baseline and no symptoms of active TB:
! Week 52 QFT negative: no further testing
! Week 52 QFT indeterminate: repeat at Week 56. If negative no further testing, 
however if indeterminate repeat again at Week 60.

5.3.9 Modified flare index
A modified SELENA flare index, using the SLEDAI-2K instead of the SELENA SLEDAI 
(see ), will be completed every 3 months as an exploratory outcome to further 
characterise flares as safety events. 
The modified flare assessment should be comp leted by [CONTACT_692986]/qualified 
physician as per protocol schedule of assessments. Assessment of flare should be scored in 
comparison to the subject’s previous visit (ie,  over the past 28 days ) and shoul d only include 
findings which, in the option of the Investigator, are due to SLE disease activity within that 
timeframe. Flare will be defined as any 1 criterion present in either the Mild/Moderate Flare 
or Severe Flare categories. New or worsened manifestations should only be reported for 
manifestations of SLE.
5.3.10 Clinical laboratory tests
All clinical laboratory tests will be performed in a central clinical laboratory at the times 
indicated in the Study Plan ( Table 2 , Table 3 , and Table 4 ). 
A serum pregnancy test (or serum FSH in postmenopausal females with menses absent for ≥1 year) will be performed at screening at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be 
performed at the site using a dipstick. Abnormal sa fety laboratory results should be repeated 
as clinically indicated, as soon as possible (preferably within 24 to 48 hours).
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the 
Investigator.
Every attempt should be made to redraw any missing safety laboratory tests, even if the 
subject has received the investigational product. 
The Investigator should make an assessment of the available results with regard to clinically 
relevant abnormalities. The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at the

pain. Herpes zoster results from the reactivation of Varicella-zoster virus; multiple 
dermatomes may be involve d (>3 indicates disseminated di sease) and organ or systemic 
infection may occur (invasive; therefore an opportunistic infection). Polymerase chain reaction testing of samples from vesicles, biopsy, or other specimens (for example, cerebrospi[INVESTIGATOR_872]) may confirm the presence of varicella-zoster virus.
For additional information regarding Herpes zoster , refer to the Investigator Brochure. As this 
is an event of special interest, the Sponsor w ill collect information including whether or not 
subjects have received vaccination for Herpes zoster. The Herpes zoster vaccine will be
captured in the appropriate sections of the CRF.

Influenza is a severe viral infection that incl udes the following symptoms: temperature greater 
than 100.8°F (38.2°C), and malaise, headache, or myalgia. It is often accompanied by [CONTACT_33234], 
vomiting, and diarrhoea, and at least 1 of the following respi[INVESTIGATOR_1856]: cough, sore 
throat, or shortness of breath.
Laboratory criteria for influenza include at least 1 of the following: isolation of influenza virus 
from a clinical specimen, detection of influenza virus nucleic acid in a clinical specimen, 
identification of influenza virus antigen by [CONTACT_153274] a clinical 
specimen, OR influenza-specific antibody response.
A confirmed case of influenza meets the clinical and laboratory criteria for the viral illness. 
Laboratory confirmation s hould be done using locally av ailable, rapid, commercial tests 
approved by [CONTACT_153275][INVESTIGATOR_153194].Not all upper respi[INVESTIGATOR_153195]. In 
the case where a subject reports a viral infection severe enough to be considered, in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], influenza, a viral test should be performed (if possible) to confirm 
the diagnosis. If, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], the subject has had influenza (the specific 
viral infection), this should be reported as an AESI, whether or not a test to confirm the 
diagnosis has been performed. Less severe viral infection should be reported as an AE only.

Vasculitis (non-SLE) is defined as an inflammatory disorder of blood vessels involving arteries and/or veins and characterised by  [CONTACT_153276]/symptoms and 
diagnosed by [CONTACT_9256], imaging such as angiography or blood tests such as findings of 
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies consistent with the diagnosis. Underlying causes should 
be identified, such as medications including study drug, infections or systemic inflammatory 
syndromes, wherever possible. See for a list of vasculitic syndromes excluded

cardiovascular death).
The CV-EAC will review cases of interest to determine if they meet accepted diagnostic 
criteria. Causality assessments will not be made by [CONTACT_153277]-EAC, nor will the committee 
possess governance authority. The CV-EAC will be blinded regarding any information 
relating to the randomisation group.

6.6.1 Time p eriod for collection of adverse events
Adverse Events and SAEs will be collected from the time of signature [CONTACT_43998], 
throughout the treatment period and including th e follow-up period un til Follow-up Visit 2 
([ADDRESS_939760] final dose) or Week [ADDRESS_939761]’s la st visit in the study are followed up by [CONTACT_153278] . The Sponsor retains the right to request 
additional information for any subject with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if 
judged necessary.
6.6.3 Variables

! Description of AE
! Investigator causality assessment to concomitant medications
! Investigator causality assessment to study procedures (yes or no)
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of 
intensity, whereas seriousness is defined by [CONTACT_692989] a bove. An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of disab ility may be c onsidered a mild stroke but would be 
a SAE. The Investigator should provide an assessment of the severity of each AE/SAE.
6.6.[ADDRESS_939762] and each AE, 
and answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility 
that the event may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198]?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be a ssessed for other medication and study procedures 
and additional study drug (such as OCS, azathioprine, antimalarials, mycophenolate 
mofetil/mycophenolic acid, methotrexate, and mizoribine). Note that for SAEs that could be 
associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in 
6.6.[ADDRESS_939763] or care provider or reported in response to the 
open question from the study personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the 
previous visit/you were last asked?’ , or revealed by [CONTACT_692990]. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) to 
recording a list of signs and symptoms. However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or 
symptom will be recorded separately.
6.6.6 Adverse events based on  examinations and tests
The results from protocol mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarised in the 
clinical study report (CSR). Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol-mandated 
laboratory values, vital signs, ECGs, and other safety assessments should therefore only be 
reported as AEs if they fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of 
treatment with the investigational product.

96(128)If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is associated with clin ical signs and symptoms, 
the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE  and the associated laboratory result/vital sign 
will be considered as additional information. Wh erever possible the reporting Invest igator will 
use the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, an aemia versus low haemoglobin value).
In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms , clinically relevant deteriorations in 
non-mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).
Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE.
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE (or SAE, as appropriate).
6.6.7 Disease progression/worsening of systemic lupus erythematosus
Disease progression can be considered as a wors ening of a subject’s condition attributable to 
SLE. It may be an increase in the activity or severity of the existing manifestations of SLE or 
the appearance of new manifestations. Worsening of SLE should not be reported as an AE, unless the signs and symptoms meet criteria for an SAE. New manifestation or worsening of 
existing manifestations of SLE should be reported as “new” or “worsening” in the 
BILAG-2004, and recorded in the SLEDAI-2K, as appr opriate.
6.[ADDRESS_939764], or to the study procedure(s). All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. PRA Safety 
Management is to be sent all safety forms and supporting documentation including laboratorytests, imaging reports, diagnostic test results, biopsy reports and discharge summaries.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
inform PRA Safety Management within 1 day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of 
when he or she becomes aware of it.
PRA Safety Management works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary 
information is provided to the data entry site within 1 calendar day of initial receipt for fatal 
and life threatening events (if received for instance during a weekend or a public holiday, the 
information is forwarded as early as possible on the first business day following the weekend 
or holiday) and within 3 calendar days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately. Investigators or other site personnel inform PRA Safety 
Management of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE within 1 calendar day, ie, immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious or is an AESI in the Datalabs system, an automated email alert is  sent to the designated PRA and [COMPANY_008]
representative(s).

PRA, on behalf of [COMPANY_008], is responsible for reporting certain SAEs as expedited safety 
reports to applicable Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees (ECs), and participating 
Investigators, in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guidelines and/or local regulatory requirements. PRA may be required to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days  of being notified about the event; therefore, it

meets criteria of an SAE. All AESIs (serious or nonserious) will be recorded on the AE CRF 
(using a recognised medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event).

acetaminophen/paracetamol for the comfort and safety of the subject prior to subsequent 
infusions. Prophylactic use of glucocorticosteroids prior to subsequent infusions is not permitted.
6.9.2 Infections
When an infection is reported as an SAE or AESI, cultures should be obtained and culture 
results should be reported with the event. Othe r specific laboratory or other investigations (eg, 
chest x-ray for pneumonia) that confirm or aid in the diagnosis or treatment should be 
obtained when indicated and results should be reported with the SAE or AESI. 
Subjects who develop a new infection while undergoing treatment with investigational 
product should receive appropriate medical therapy, as determined by [CONTACT_104130], and be 
monitored closely until the condition resolves. Investigational product should not be 
administered to a subject with a clinically significant, active infection as determined by [CONTACT_3786] (see Section 3.7). For any active infection (eg, Varicella zoster
infection/chickenpox) or significant exposure to any infection (eg, Varicella zoster infection 
in a naive subject, bacterial pneumonia), the Investigator should consider whether to interrupt 
investigational product administration and should notify the medical monitor. 
Similarly, if a subject presents with signs or symptoms where opportuni stic infections are 
considered (eg, CNS symptoms consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
or Herpes encephalitis or atypi[INVESTIGATOR_692958]), 
investigational product should be interrupted until the Investigator confirms the symptoms and 
signs of infection have resolved or that no active infection has developed.
If dosing is resumed after resolution of a safety concern (ie, infection or other AE) the 
investigational product must be administered within 14 days of the scheduled time of the
missed dose. If this is not possible, dosing s hould be resumed at the time of the next scheduled 
dose

subject prior to subsequent infusions. The medications should be given after visit assessments have been completed. Prophylactic use of glucocorticosteroids prior to 
subsequent infusions is not permitted.
7.2.[ADDRESS_939772] administration procedures
! Investigational product must be administered within 4 hours after preparation and 
may be stored at room temperature until administration. Total in-use storage time

102(128)! Duration of infusion: the amount of time elapsed from the infusion start time to the 
infusion stop time. Infusion start time is defined as the time point where 
investigational product is first infused into the subject. Infusion stop time is defined 
as the time point where the infusion pump completes infusion of the investigational product, not including the saline flush.
For example: an infusion with a start time of 12:[ADDRESS_939774] a duration of 
infusion recorded as 30 minutes (a time between 12:00 PM and 12:30 PM).
! Duration of administration: the amount of time elapsed from the i nfusion pump start 
time to the infusion pump stop time PLUS the time required to complete the 
additional flush of saline. The duration of administration will always be greater than the duration of infusion and will always include the additional flush of saline.
Initial IV bag compatibility studies demonstr ate that anifrolumab is compatible with IV bags 
composed of polyolefin that is latex-free, poly vinyl chloride (PVC)-free, and diethylhexyl 
phthalate (DEHP)-free, and IV administration lines composed of PVC and polyethylene that are latex free and DEHP-free. Additional studies  demonstrate that anifrolumab is compatible 
with IV bags and ancillaries comprised of m aterials as described in Table 6 and Table 7 .

The key secondary endpoint used to evaluate the effect of anifrolumab versus placebo on the 
ability to reduce the OCS dose in subjects with baseline OCS ≥10 mg/day prednisone or 
equivalent is the difference in the proportion of subjects meeting all the following criteria:

114(128)Presentation of results
All data will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. De scriptive statistics (number, mean, standard 
deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided for continuous variables, 
and counts and percentages will be presented for categorical variables.
95% CIs will be presented for treatment comparisons. If a model is used to estimate the 
treatment difference, the corresponding CI according to the model will be presented. Otherwise, the unadjusted CI will be used. Nominal p-values may be presented for secondary 
endpoints not included in the strategy for preserving the type I error rate. Statistical 
significance cannot be interpreted from these p-values. 
Demography and baseline characteristics will be summarised by [CONTACT_692998]. 8.5.[ADDRESS_939781] is the difference in the proportions of response between 
anifrolumab and placebo at Week 52 in the full analysis set, where the response is captured 
with a composite binary endpoint and is de fined by [CONTACT_692999], no worsening in SLEDAI-2K and PGA and ability to adhere 
to the planned course of the treatment. The intercurrent events: discontinuation of investigational product and receipt of restricted medications are unfavourable outcomes. 
Therefore, subjects treated with restricted me dications beyond protocol-allowed threshold, and 
those who discontinued the investigational product for any reasons, will be non-responders. 
This estimand answers a clinically relevant question comparing the number of subjects able to 
both complete the study treatment and to achieve adequate response without further medication being required. The response is  measured by [CONTACT_22946], 
defined as the difference in the proportion of subjects achieving BICLA response at Week 52, comparing the anifrolumab to the placebo groups.
The null hypothesis is that the proportion of subjects achieving BICLA response on 
anifrolumab is equal to that of placebo. The alternative hypothesis is that the proportion of 
subjects achieving BICLA response on anifrolumab is not equal to that on placebo, ie,
H0: difference in proportion achieving BICLA response (anifrolumab vs Placebo) = 0
Ha: difference in proportion achieving BICLA response (anifrolumab vs Placebo) ≠ [ADDRESS_939782] s achieving BICLA response in the anifrolumab treatment group will

! Ensure the original, signed ICF(s) is/are stored in the Investigator’s Study File
! Ensure a copy of the signed ICF(s) is/are given to the subject
! Ensure that any incentives for subjects who participate in the study as well as any 
provisions for sub jects harmed as a consequence of study participation are 
described in the ICF(s) that is/are approved by [CONTACT_76467].
10.5 Changes to the protocol and informed consent form
Study procedures will not be changed without the mutual agreement of the International 
coordinating Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_692960].
If there are any substantial changes to the study protocol, then these changes will be 
documented in a study protocol amendment and wh ere required in a new version of the study 
protocol (Revised Clinical Study Protocol).The amendment is to be approved by [CONTACT_693000], the national regulatory 
authority, before implementation. Local requi rements are to be followed for revised protocols.
[COMPANY_008] or designee will distribute any subse quent amendments and new versions of the 
protocol to each PI. For distribution to the ECs, see Section 10.3.
If a protocol amendment requires a change to a centre’s ICF, [COMPANY_008] or designee and the 
centre’s EC are to approve the revised ICF before the revised form is used.
If local regulations require, any administrative change will be communicated to or approved 
by [CONTACT_76469].

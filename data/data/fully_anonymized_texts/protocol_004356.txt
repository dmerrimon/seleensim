BACKGROUND

More

​
Over
80%
of
type

diabetes
is
attributed
to
excess
weight

but
safe,

low-cost

not
available.
​
Failure
to
control
obesity
underlies
the
increasing
cost
of
diabetes
care
in
the
US
which
rose
by
41%

Pharmaceutical
therapy
has
proven
disappointing
for
management
of
obesity:
it
is
relatively
ineffective,
associated
with
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
severe side-effects and expensive.
 
 
 
Various
bariatric
surgical
procedures
are
highly
effective
at
inducing
weight
loss
and
lead
to
drug-free
remission
in
40-90%
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of

during
a
6-year
follow-up
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
period.
This
was
due
to
high
inpatient
costs
that
were
not
offset
by
a
reduction
in
office
visits
and
prescription
medications.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bariatric
surgery
is
not

to
the
vast

of
the
world’s

it,

about
short

Furthermore
many
individuals
elect
not

a
variety
of
reasons
that
include
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concerns
about
the

unwillingness

undergo
an

belief
that
their
obesity
does
not
justify
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the intervention.
 
 
 
There is thus an unmet clinical need for a safe, low-cost alternative to bariatric surgery.

Unlike

Tube and Non-Nutrient Liquid May Alter Oral Food Intake
 
Rolls and Roe[
​
23
​
] reported in a study of 54 lean and obese women that 
​
the volume of liquid food infused
 
intragastrically affected subsequent energy intake in both lean and obese women. There was a mean decrease
 
in energy intake of a subsequent meal of 13% after a 400-ml preload compared with an iso-energetic 200-ml
 
preload (P=.013). 
​
For this reason a controlled study should include a tube and non-nutrient liquid administration.

Interpretation
of

Low

diets,

sustained,
lead
to
weight
loss.
This
is
often
associated
with

the

that
may
be
due

the
induction

loss
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
following
caloric
restriction
is
not
sustained
and
short-term
metabolic
gains
dissipate.[
​
16
​
]
This
has
been
attributed
to
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
body’s
attempt
to
regain
its
previous
weight
with
resumption
of
a
non-restricted
intake.
The
superior
sustained
weight
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
loss
seen
with
GB
may
be
due
to
neurohormonal
signaling
of
an
“overfed”
state
during
the
low
calorie
phase
leading
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
defense
of
the
lower
weight
once
the
intervention
is
withdrawn.
We
aim
to
simulate
this
“fed”
response
with
jejunal
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
feeding.
 
 
With
respect
to
the
ketogenic
enteric
nutrition
diet,
this
200-260kcal/day
diet
induces
ketosis
during
a
continuous
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration
of
primarily
protein
into
the
stomach.
This
strategy
is
reported
to
minimize
protein
catabolism
during
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diet.
The
intragastric
continuous
infusion
is

from
the

approach
we

Day 0-Day 14: (see Table 3)
 
▪
Intervention subjects will take mixed meal via jejunal tube at 10mls/min to satiety or to a maximum volume of
 
200mls 4 times a day. They will also take 200mls electrolyte solution 4 times daily orally.
 
 
▪
Control subjects will take electrolyte solution via jejunal tube at 10mls/min to satiety or to a maximum volume of
 
200mls 4 times a day. They will also take 200mls mixed meal solution 4 times daily orally.
 
▪
If for any reason the tube feed cannot be administered the remainder should be taken orally to ensure
 
recommended daily intake of major nutrients and fluid is achieved.
 
▪
In addition all subjects will take the following daily:  2 10meq potassium chloride tablets, 2 600mg calcium tablets
 
and 1 multivitamin tablet daily and 1/2tsp salt.
 
▪
In addition all subjects will be requested to eat ad lib from provided meals of known caloric amount.
 
 
▪
All subjects may also eat ad lib from very low or calorie “free” foods and drinks throughout the study from a
 
provided list.
 
▪
 Subjects will maintain a log of all food intake will check their daily temperature, tube position and symptoms and
 
will contact [CONTACT_255003].
 
 
▪
As subjects adhering to very low-calorie diets usually have a fall in blood pressure, especially during the first week
 
antihypertensive drugs will be discontinued unless moderate to severe hypertension is present.[

▪
Subjects will be requested to be as physically active as they like. Thus they are at liberty to increase, decrease or
 
maintain their usual activity level.
 
▪
 Similarly as most diabetic patients eating very low-calorie diets have marked improvement in hyperglycemia with
 
blood glucose concentrations falling within the first one to two weeks oral hypoglycemic drugs will be
 
discontinued for the first week of therapy. [
​
33
​
] An increase in activity level may also cause a fall in blood glucose
 
levels. To aid in maintaining safe blood glucose levels subjects will be required to report to the study team if their
 
blood glucose is over 250mg/dl on more than 2 consecutive measures or any value over 300mg/dl or  less than
 
70mg/dl on any occasion. Symptoms of hypoglycemia (sweating, weakness, palpi[INVESTIGATOR_814], confusion) will be
 
reviewed with the participant at each visit. They will be advised to check their blood glucose if possible if such
 
symptoms occur and to take one 15g glucose tablet (to be carried at all times) and repeat this every 15minutes until
 
self-monitored blood glucose is over 80mg/dL or symptoms resolve.

 2 ENTERAL ACCESS SYSTEM (EAS™) 
​
[
​
35-41
​
]
 
 
This system is FDA cleared for placement of enteral feeding tubes without x-ray confirmation. A transmitting stylet is used
 
to place the enteral tube. The tip of the stylet contains an electromagnetic transmitter that generates a real-time signal as the
 
feeding tube is inserted and advanced to the desired placement. The signal from the transmitting stylet is tracked throughout
 
the placement procedure via a lightweight receiver unit (Smart Receiver Unit: SRU) that is placed on the patient’s xiphoid
 
process. A monitor triangulates the signal from the SRU and displays a real-time representation of the feeding tube tip’s
 
passage as it proceeds down the esophagus and into the preferred placement position — gastric, duodenal, or jejunal. (See
 
Fig 6)

​
 2 ENTERAL ACCESS SYSTEM (EAS™)
 
Safe
 
a.
Eliminates or significantly reduces patient exposure to X-ray
 
 
b.
Confirms accurate placement quickly
​
.
 
 
c.
Clinicians are able to identify misplaced tubes immediately to significantly reduce adverse events
 
 
Accurate
 
a.
In a multi-center study 99.5% of placements correlated with abdominal X-ray
​
.
 
b.
89% -100% success rates reported with gastric, jejunal, and duodenal placement
 
 
c.
Additional depth cross-sectional view may more accurately predict location compared with X-ray
 
Fast
 
a.
Real-time visualization of the relative tube tip position eliminates waiting time for X-ray
 
confirmation
 
Support
 
a.
CORPAK’s Clinical Educators assist with implementation planning, on-site education training programs and
 
customized protocol development with hospi[INVESTIGATOR_254960]
 
 
b.
CORTRAK [ADDRESS_309987], link to Mosby’s Nursing Skills)
 
 
Flexibility
 
a.
Choice of operating mode for easy upload of data for training, review, or research
 
 
b.
2D and 3D views provide more information than X-ray for confident placement without X-ray
 
 
Evidence
 
a.
Growing clinical research base demonstrating system’s safety and efficacy
 
 
b.
Used by [CONTACT_726] [ADDRESS_309988] placed approximately 25 jejunal tubes with this system without incidence.
 
 
 
Intraoral Anchor (see Fig 7)
 
For the purposes of this study we will secure the tube intraorally rather than through the nasopharynx to the skin.
 
The rationale for this is:
 
a.
To minimize discomfort to the subject due to placement of the tube through the sensitive nasopharynx
 
b.
To eliminate the risk of complications in the nasopharynx such as nose bleed, sinusitis and malposition
 
c.
To improve social acceptability of the study by [CONTACT_255013].
 
d.
To simplify tube maintenance by [CONTACT_255014][INVESTIGATOR_254961].
 
To achieve this we will:
 
[ADDRESS_309989] who
 
report:
 
a.
The flange is strong enough to hold the tube at the proximal end of the channel as it is 
​
solvent bonded/glued per
 
the manufacturers 
​
and will not deform or detach thereby [CONTACT_255015].
 
Per scientific adviser [CONTACT_255067]: “
​
Because the access port is solvent bonded to the tube and both the
 
tube and the access port are made of a reasonably strong polymer material, the chance of the tube ever being
 
released from the oral anchor due to its separation from the access port segment is nearly zero. Using solvent is
 
perhaps the best way of adhering parts made of materials that can be dissolved by [CONTACT_255016].”(Personal and email communication).
 
b.
The modified molar band is a minor variant of a standard orthodontic molar band and is very secure and similarly
 
renders the risk of distal displacement of the tube extremely low.
 
c.
The tube position in the oropharynx is lateral to sites triggering the gag reflex and allows for virtually normal
 
speech, swallowing and eating with minimal or no gagging and is virtually undetectable by [CONTACT_2312].
 
d.
Some discomfort and mild pain (maximum ~4 out of 10) can be expected mostly in the first 4-5days of use. This
 
can be eased with several maneuvers including change of body position and acetaminophen in standard dose.
 
e.
The discomfort and pain can be expected to be minimal after the first [ADDRESS_309990] is barely aware
 
of the tube’s presence.
 
f.
There is minimal risk of throat or gastrointestinal complications with a 10 French jejunal tube placed in the
 
described manner and for duration of 2 weeks.

serious complications in a group of over 19,000 people. The problems encountered were damage to the external part of the
 
tube (e.g. shaving) 2%, “gastric hypersecretion” (nos) 2%, nausea and vomiting 1%, and intolerance to the nasal tube
 
0.03%. The following were not observed: ulceration or bleeding due to the tube, b
​
reakage of the tube in esophagus or
 
in the

 stomach, p
​
erforation or bleeding of the stomach.  Sukkar et al [

​
distension and pain, diarrhea, vomiting, reflux,
 
naso-gastric
​
, 
​
tube obstruction, de-positioning or accidental removal of the
​
 
​
naso-gastric tube, others) and those related to the
 
very low calorie/high protein diet (cardiac arrhythmia, ketosis, hypoglycemia, others). Out of 26 patients enrolled, 3
 
patients (9 %) were withdrawn due to poor compliance and 1 (3 %) for allergy to milk protein. Of the remaining 22 subjects
 
there were no reported major complications or side effects resulting from the enteral nutrition in any patient. In particular,
 
no cardiac arrhythmias were reported, nor diarrhea or cramps. The following were reported: constipation (3/22; 13.6 %),
 
dizziness or headache during the first 2 days [20/22; 90.9 % (only two needed medication)], general weakness (3/22; 13.6

Inadvertent Dislodgement of the Tube
 
Enteral
feeding
tubes
not
infrequently
become
accidentally
dislodged
in
general
use.
This
is
considered
highly
unlikely
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cause
problems
in
this
study
as
the
tube
will
be
anchored
entirely
intraorally.
Most
displacement
is
due
to
inadvertent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
pulling
on
the
extracorporeal
part
of
the
tube
by
a
sedated
or
otherwise
confused
patient,
or
failure
of
tape
to
maintain
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
position
of
the
tube.
If
the
tube
were
to
slip
through
the
anchor
it
is
anticipated
that
it
would
pass
directly
through
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
gastrointestinal
tract.
Per
co-investigator
[CONTACT_255074]
a
tube
that
becomes
dislodged
and
is
swallowed
will
almost
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
certainly
pass
spontaneously
through
the
intestinal
tract
as
long
as
there
are
no
abnormalities
in
the
intestine
such
as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adhesions
or
strictures
and
the
chance
of
the
tube
being
retained
and
requiring
endoscopic
or
surgical
removal
is
so
low
that
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
it
does
not
need
to
be
mentioned
as
a
risk
to
subjects.
We
will
exclude
all
subjects
with

history
of
abdominal
infections
or

The following table and figure from Nazir et al [

Ensuring participants won’t chew through the tube if they have bruxism
 
 
The
tube
anchor
is
located
on
the
upper
posterior
buccal
molar.
The
140cm
tube
immediately
passes
backwards
from
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
anchor
to
the
lateral
oropharynx
where
it
descends
straight
down
into
the
gastrointestinal
tract.
It
is
maintained
in
this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
position
by
[CONTACT_255025].
The
tube
is
thus
unable
to
move
medially
across
the
occlusal
surface
of
the
teeth
and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
hence bruxism does not pose a risk.

the

posterior occlusal surfaces of the teeth.
 
 
Precautions to be taken to prevent the tube being accidentally swallowed
 
The following precautions will be taken to decrease the chance that the tube will be accidentally swallowed:
 
Participants
will
be
asked
to
monitor
for
any
loosening
of
the
molar
band
daily
and
also
to
monitor
for
any
evidence
of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
abrasion
or
wear
on
the
intraoral
portion
of
the
tube.
They
will
do
this
by
[CONTACT_255026].
They
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
will
be
requested
to
report
any
concerns
in
this
regard
to
the
study
team
as
soon
as
it
is
detected.
They
will
also
be
told
how
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to
remove
the
band
or
tube
if
it
should
become
so
loose
or
worn
that
it
could
dislodge
spontaneously.
Furthermore
to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
decrease risk of the band becoming dislodged the band will be kept in place for as short a period as possible.
 
 
 
Procedure if the tube is accidentally swallowed and how it will be retrieved.
 
 
The
risk
of
accidental
swallowing
of
the
tube
is
considered
to
be
extremely
remote
due
to
the
precautions
taken
in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
design
of
the

and
tube
as

[

​
]summarizes
findings
from
numerous
articles
on
the
topic
of
ingested
foreign
bodies
in
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adult.
It
has
been
widely
reported
that
the
majority
of
foreign
bodies
in
the
gastrointestinal
tract
will
pass
spontaneously
but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
that
about
10-20%
will
require
non-operative
intervention
and
less
than
1%
will
require
surgery.
In

in
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
very
unlikely
event
that
the
tube
were
to

the
rate
of

can
be
expected
to
be
far
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
higher than 80%. The reasons for this are as follows:
 
a.
Impaction
most
often
occurs
at
areas
of
acute
angulation
or
physiologic
narrowing.
The
esophagus
is
the
most
frequent
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
site
of
blockage
(50–75%) because
of
physiological
narrowing
at
the
cricopharyngeal
sphincter,
the
aortic
arch
and
the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diaphragmatic
hiatus.
Other
relatively
narrow
and
angled
areas
are
the
duodenum
and
the
entrance
to
the
jejunum
at

Venipuncture
 
This study involves venipuncture of a peripheral vein. This is associated with a small risk of minor bleeding and infection at
 
the puncture site. To minimize this risk, aseptic precautions will be used.
 
 
 
Risk of Hypoglycemia or Hyperglycemia
 
Alteration in diet and physical activity could lead to alterations in blood glucose: both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
 
To minimize the risk of these complications the following precautions will be made:
 
a.
All participants will have the symptoms and signs of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia reviewed
 
with them as well as recommended management at each visit starting with the recruitment visit
 
when the protocol is reviewed.
 
b.
As most diabetic patients eating very low-calorie diets have marked improvement in
 
hyperglycemia with blood glucose concentrations falling within the first one to two weeks oral
 
hypoglycemic drugs will be discontinued for the first week of therapy. [
​
33
​
] An increase in
 
activity level may also cause a fall in blood glucose levels. To aid in maintaining safe blood
 
glucose levels subjects will be required to report to the study team if their blood glucose is over
 
250mg/dl on more than 2 consecutive measures or any value is over 300mg/dl or  less than
 
70mg/dl on any occasion.
 
 
c.
Information on managing hypoglycemia is provided in the FREE TO GO Study Instructions
 
given to the participant.

Oral hypoglycemic drugs will be discontinued for the first week of therapy
 
and participants will contact [CONTACT_255033] 70mg/dL or over 250mg/dL.
 
Participants will be educated on the symptoms of hypo- and hyper- glycemia

CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION AND ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS
 
 
Primary aim: weight change immediately following the intervention period between the study groups
 
Secondary aims: to compare the following within and between groups:
 
 
a.
From Day 0 to Day 14: caloric intake (as determined by [CONTACT_254977])
 
 
b.
From Day 0 to Day 14: weight change (within group)
 
c.
From Day 0 to Day 28: weight change
 
 
d.
From Day 0 to Day 14 and also from Day 0 to Day 28: waist and hip measurement, hormones and
 
biochemical measures, physical activity , body composition , select symptoms, medication use, average
 
self-monitored blood glucose level
 
 
 
11.0
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 
Samples will be collected by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_254968].
 
The investigator will draw 20cc fasting blood at Day 0, 14 and 28 visits into a prepared tube containing aprotinin. This will
 
be kept on ice and centrifuged, separated and aliquoted within 30mins of blood draw. Samples will then be stored at -20
 
degrees centigrade until transferred on ice to collaborator for assay.
 
 
Study Costs: All costs for this study will be paid from study funds. There will be no patient care costs incurred for payment
 
from non-study funds. Costs covered by [CONTACT_255035], supplies, equipment, blood draws, biochemical
 
analysis and subject reimbursement.

DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING
 
 
Confidentiality of Discussions:
​
 The privacy of the research subject will be protected by [CONTACT_255036] a private room in the Roybal CHC or by [CONTACT_255037] a private office.
 
Initial and follow-up Case Report Forms (CRF): 
​
All data will be entered on IRB approved clinical medical record forms.
 
All data will be kept in a locked cabinet in [CONTACT_255077]’s office when not in use.
 
Data Security and Confidentiality
​
 Data will only be accessible by [CONTACT_255038]-investigators and research
 
assistants for the purposes of the study. Data will be transcribed from the CRF to a non-network computer, password
 
protected, accessible only by [CONTACT_255039]. Each enrolled patient will be assigned a study
 
number and all data will be stored under this study number with no linkage to patient identifiers.  Data will also be stored
 
by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Ionut in her computer protected computer database using a study specific identifier developed specifically for the
 
study. The computer is password protected and is in a room accessible only to the laboratory personnel. All personnel have
 
been HIPAA trained.
 
When the study is completed the data or data set will be maintained in a de-identified form on the PI’s computer. Identifiers
 
will be destroyed at the earliest opportunity consistent with the conduct of the research and/or clinical needs and will be
 
maintained no longer than 2 years after completion of the study.
 
 
Source Documentation and Timeliness of CRF Completion.
​
 The CRF will be completed by [CONTACT_255040]. Data
 
will be stored on REDCap.
 
 
Retention of Study Record:
​
 Study data will be retained for 5 years after publication. At this time or in case non-publication,
 
the data will be destroyed.
 
Data Management:
​
 Data will be recorded on clinic record forms and will be entered into a database system for subsequent
 
statistical analysis. Potential data errors will be detected by [CONTACT_255041]. The frequency of missing values will be
 
counted for each variable at each of the follow-up time points. Cross-tables will be used to verify the logical validity of
 
related variables.
 
 
 
 
 
13.[ADDRESS_310001] sizes and parameter estimates derived from this study will be used in the design and power calculations

Ver 3.11.14
 
 
for future studies The primary aim is to compare weight change from Day 1 to Day 14 (the intervention period)  between
 
the 2 study groups.
 
 
The secondary aims are to compare the following between study groups:
 
 
a.
From Day 1 to Day 14: caloric intake
 
 
b.
From Day 1 to Day 28 (the intervention and follow-up period): Weight change
 
 
c.
From Day 1 to Day 14 and also from Day 1 to Day 28:
 
 
i.
waist and hip measurement,
 
ii.
 hormones and biochemical measures,
 
iii.
physical activity
 
 
iv.
body composition
 
 
v.
symptoms
 
vi.
medication
 
vii.
self-monitored blood glucose
 
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, it is possible that clinically relevant effects will be observed that do not reach
 
statistical significance. Nevertheless, based on the work of Lingvay et al[
​
27
​
] we could consider a 30% difference between
 
sites in weight loss between the groups to be clinically relevant.
 
 
Data will be presented as mean +/- S.E.M. Differences between groups will be analyzed by [CONTACT_31806]-way ANOVA
 
followed by a Student’s t-test for independent samples. A non-parametric test (Wilcoxon Rank) will be performed
 
when appropriate. Change over time will be assessed with ANOVA for repeated measurements. In case of a
 
significant result a post hoc analysis will be performed with the Student’s ttest. All analyses will be performed
 
using SPSS for Windows Version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, [LOCATION_003]).

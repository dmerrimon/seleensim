 RESEARCH SUMMARY AND PROTOCOL  
 
1. PURPOSE  
 
To determine the feasibility of establishing patient -derived organoids from pre-treatment rectal 
adenocarcinoma biopsies. 
 Primary Objective (s): 
 
1. To determine the feasibility of establishing  patient -derived organoids from pre-treatment 
rectal adenocarcinoma biopsies. The primary endpoint is the percent of biopsies that form spherical organoids. 
 
Exploratory Objectives:  
1. To describe the radiation response of patient-derived organoids and compare it to  the 
patient ’s clinical response to neoadjuvant radiation. 
2. To describe the radiation response of orthotopic organoid transplants in mice and compare it to  the patient ’s clinical response to neoadjuvant radiation.  
3. To describe the histopathologic and molecular characteristics of patient-derived organoids. 
  
Hypotheses 
1. 70% of patient -derived organoid attempts will be successful. This protocol will be 
hypothesis-generating. Data obtained from this protocol will guide future studies on the 
utility of patient -derived organoids for assessing  radiation response in rectal cancer.  
 
2. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE 
 
 The standard of care for stage II -III rectal cancer is neoadjuvant chemoradiation or short-
course radiation followed by [CONTACT_562827] .1 Response to neoadjuvant radiation varies 
across patients, with some having minimal response to 10-30% having a pathologic complete 
response. Pathologic complete response is associated with improved clinical outcomes including resectability, sphincter preservation, local control, and overall survival.

generation and expansion from patient tissue.10 The Hubrecht Institute  generated patient -derived 
organoids from untreated colorectal cancer in 20 patients with a n 80- 90% success  rate and

a 76% success rate for colorectal cancer.
[ADDRESS_739619]- treatment, with 
a 77% success rate.[ADDRESS_739620]-radiation tumor size on endoscopy. 
Four patient organoids were also engrafted  into the mouse rectum to create a parallel preclinical 
model, and 5-FU and FOLFOX response of these transplanted organoids appeared to mirror clinical patient responses.
13 Lastly, a  study from Fudan University collected tumor samples from 
112 patients with newly-diagnosed rectal cancer enrolled in a phase III trial ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) evaluating the addition of irinotecan to neoadjuvant chemoradiation and generated organoids with a 86% succ ess rate.
[ADDRESS_739621] one of the treatments generally  
correlated with patient’s AJCC tumor regression grade. However, in [ADDRESS_739622] experience in  generating organoids from human colorectal tumor biopsies, 
endoscopy-guided transplantation of organoids in mice, and pelvic radiation in mice.
15-18 Our 
institution also routinely ev aluates and treats rectal cancer patients, from the initial work -up 
including proctoscopy to neoadjuvant radiation therapy for stage II-III patients to resection. Therefore, we believe that it would be feasible to generate patient -derived organoids from a  
rectal tumor biopsy obtained at proctoscopy. As proof-of- principle, we will also aim to measure 
the radiation response of these organoids in vitro  and also of engrafted organoids in the mouse 
rectum in vivo  and compare to patient clinical responses .

Version:  [ADDRESS_739623]- of-care proctoscopy  in clinic 
3-2. The biopsy will be given a unique de- identified reference code. The de -identified biopsy 
will be placed in a sterile conical tube containing MACS Tissue Storage Solution (Miltenyi 
Biotec) , then transported to [CONTACT_469706]’s lab on wet ice by a research technician  from  [CONTACT_469706]’s lab. 
[CONTACT_469706] will gen erate spherical organoids  from the research biopsy as previously described.19 
Briefly, the biopsy will be  manually mince d with a razor blade or scalpel, transferred to a sterile 
conical tube containing enzymatic s olution with Collagenase I ([COMPANY_002]), then spun in a 
MACSmix Tube Rotator (Miltenyi Biotec) in a 37°C incubator for 30-60 minutes. Then, the sample  will be  washed and centrifuged for 5 minutes, the supernatant will be discarded , and the 
tumor cell pellet wil l be resuspended in basal media and filtered through a 70 μm strainer. T he 
cells will be  counted, centrifuged again for 5 minutes, resuspended in  a 1:1 Matrigel:PBS 
mixture  (Corning), plated in a 24- well plate , and incubated at 37°C for 15 -20 minutes, afte r 
which 1 mL media is added to each well. The cells will be assessed daily for organoid formation. Media will be  changed every 3 -4 days, and organoids will be  passaged when the Matrigel 
reaches 80% confluency. Organoids will be passaged until the third passage, at which point the organoids will be transferred to [CONTACT_562834].    For the exploratory objectives, the de- identified  and passaged organoids will be given to [CONTACT_562835] to assess the radiation response of organoids and organoid transplants. For organoid radiation response, plated organoids w ill receive a single fraction of radiation ranging from 0 – 
15 Gy, then c ell viability  will be assessed by [CONTACT_562828] a radiation dose-
response curve , and the AUC will be calculated . Designated member s of the study team with 
access to the master log will be able to compare this  organoid radiation response with the 
patient’s clinical response  to neoadjuvant radiation from the surgical pathology report.  
 For organoid transplant ation , organoids will be  gently dissociated and resuspended in 3D matrix 
with minimal medium and injected into the lamina propria of the mouse rectum as previously described.
17 Transplanted tumors will be visible four to six weeks after injection . 20 Mice will 
then receiv e pelvic radiation of about 20-30 Gy in 4-5 fractions using a single arc, using 
previously described radiation methods.18 To measure radi ation response, mice will be followed 
with periodic endoscopy and the percent change in  tumor size index after radiation will be 
measured as previously described.20 The tumor size index is the tumor area divided b y the 
colorectal lumen area. Designated members of the study team with access to the mas ter log will 
be able to compare the radiation response of organoid transplants with the patient’s clinical response to neoadjuvant radiation from the surgical pathology report.  The last exploratory objective will be to  describe the histopathology and molecular 
characteristics of patient -derived organoids. Histopathology may include hematoxylin and eosin 
staining as well as  immunohistochemistry of markers such as CK20, C DX2 , and β -catenin . 
Recent studies have demonstrated a diversity of morphologies in patient -derived organoids that 
appear to retain characteristics of the primary tumor.

1. Age ≥18 years old. 2. Able to  provide informed consent ; either paper or e -consent is permitted  
3. Undergoing proctoscopy.   Exclusion 1. Patient not planned to receive neoadjuvant radiotherapy 
 
5. SUBJECT RECRUITMENT AND COMPENSATION 
 
Potential subjects  with biopsy-proven stage II /III rectal adenocarcinoma (ICD -10 C20) or 
suspected stage II /III rectal adenocarcinoma with pending diagnostic biopsy be prospectively 
identified through MaestroCare.   Subjects will not be compensated for inclusion in this protocol. 
 
6. CONSENT PROCESS 
 
The informed consent form will be written in a manner that is understandable to the subject population.  Prior to its use, the informed consent form and e-consent, if applicable will be approved by [CONTACT_1201]. 
 
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_562822] (other than [CONTACT_469706]) will discuss with the potential subject the purpose of the research, methods, potential risks and benefits, subject concerns, and other study- related matters.  Initial introduction of and any further discussions 
regarding the study will take place in an  exam room in the Duke Cancer Center  (for paper 
consent) or by [CONTACT_756] (for e-consent).  
Shiaowen ( David ) Hsu MD PhD founded a start-up company called Xilis. Duke holds the IP 
license for microfluidic te chnology owned by [CONTACT_562829]. This potential COI will be disclosed to all future subjects in 
the revised ICF submitted via amendment  to the IRB on March [ADDRESS_739626] and 
review the study consent by [CONTACT_756]. Subjects will provide an email address which will be used to generate and deliver the REDCap study consent form. Subjects are given the nurse coordinator’s phone number to call with any additional questions or concerns. If the patient  
elects to participate, he/she will complete the consent via a secure REDCap link and select “Yes, I have read the consent form and I wish to participate in the study.” Subjects who do not want to participate will select “Yes, I have read the consent form and I DO NOT wish to participate in

 the study.” Patients may also review the e -consent and opt to sign a paper consent at their clinic 
visit.  
 
Subjects will be given as much time as possible to make an informed decision about participation in the study. However, because consent will likely occur on the same day as the proctoscopy 
procedure, the amount of time available for consent review may be limited. Prospective subjects will be clearly informed of the voluntary nature of the study and freely allowed to decline participation.   
 
The o riginal informed consent form will be stored with the subject’s study records, and a copy of 
the informed consent form will be provided to the subject.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_562823]/her primary care physician about participation in the study.  If the subject agrees to such notification, the Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_12606]’s primary care physician about the subject’s participation in t he clinical study.  
 
 
7. STUDY INTERVENTIONS 
 
This study will involve collection of additional tumor biopsy at time of standard -of-care 
proctoscopy for generation of patient-derived organoids, which are described in Design and 
Procedure section . No other clini cal intervention will be performed.  
 
8. RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
 
There is a certain amount of  risk to collection of an additional biopsy, which is generally about 
3-[ADDRESS_739627] -of-care proctoscopy procedure. The research biopsy will 
be collected at the treating physician’s discretion and only a single research biopsy sample will be obtained. There are also risks  that privacy and confidenti ality may be compromised.  
However, every reasonable effort will be made to limit breaches of privacy and confidentiality, as described in  the “Privacy, data storage, and confidentiality” section below. 
 Subjects will not benefit directly from this protoco l.  However, data and conclusions derived 
from this protocol are expected to improve the current  understanding of rectal adenocarcinoma 
and possibly influence future cancer patient care or cancer  protocol designs. 
 
9. COSTS TO SUBJECTS 
 This protocol does not involve any cost to subjects. 
 
10. DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This is a specimen and clinical data collection protocol.   For the primary objective, all enrolled patients are evaluable, and we estimate the evaluable sample size will be 20 pa tient biopsies . For the exploratory objectives , evaluable patients are 
Pro0 0104561:  Rectal Cancer Organoids  
Version:  21 March2022  
 
 Duke Cancer Institute  Page 8 of 12 
CONFIDENTIAL  
 those with successful patient -derived organoids, which we estimate will be about 14 of 20 initial 
biops ies.   
 
Only descriptive statistical analyses  will be performed . The primary o bjective will be reported as 
the percent of patient biopsies that form spherical organoids, and the 90% one-sided lower confidence limit will be reported.  For instance, if we generate spherical organoids from 14 of 20 
(70%) biopsies, the 90% one -sided lower confidence limit will be 56%.  Laboratory procedures 
will follow group standard operating procedures (SOPs) . Given the anticipated success rate of 
generating organoids of about 70%, if we are not successful at generating organoids from [ADDRESS_739628] the  research protocol on hold, and all laboratory SOPs  will be 
reviewed and modified.  The exploratory objectives will be described qualitatively  given the anticipated small sample 
size.
13 For the organoid radiation dose-response experiments, we will compare  the dose-response 
AUC in patients who did or did not achieve a pCR. For the organoid transplantation experiments, we will compare the percent change in tumor size index in patients who did or did not achieve a pCR.   
 
11. DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING  
 
This clinical research study will be monitored both internally by [CONTACT_978], and institutionally by [CONTACT_85552] (DCI).  In terms of internal review the PI [INVESTIGATOR_33570].  Appropriate reporting to the Duke University Medical Center IRB will be made.  If an unexpected frequency of Grade III or IV events occur, depending on their nature, action appropriate to the nature and frequency of these adverse events will be taken.  This may require a protocol amendment, dose de-escalation, or potentially closure of the study.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_77998], data, and safety of this study to ensure that: 
• Interim analyses occur as scheduled; 
• Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_9480]/or response are met; • Risk/benefit ratio is not altered to the detriment of the subjects; 
• Appropriate internal monitoring of AEs and outcomes is done; • Over -accrual does not occur; 
• Under- accrual is addressed  with appropriate amendments or actions; 
• Data are being appropriately collected in a reasonably timely manner.  
 
DCI Protocol Review and Monitoring systems (PRMS) review of this protocol begins with an initial review by [CONTACT_33665] (CPC) . CPC new protocol review focuses on 
scientific relevance, study design, adequacy of biostatistical input, protocol prioritization, feasibility of completing the study within a reasonable time frame and risk assessment of the trial. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_85531], which will determine the intensity of subsequent DCI monitoring. CPC also conducts annual scientific progress reviews on protocols that are open to enrollment and focus on protocol prioritization, accrual and scientific progress. These reviews are conducted at the time of IRB annual renewals and documentation of all CPC reviews will be maintained in eIRB/iRIS systems.

 A determination for the degree of monitoring conducted by [CONTACT_248593], phase, endpoints, degree of risk, size and complexity of the protocol. A formal, independent monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_562830] a nd monitoring plan 
assigned by [CONTACT_562831]. Additional monitoring may be prompted by [CONTACT_12637], unexpected frequency of serious and/or unexpected toxicities, or other concerns.  Monitoring visits may also be initiated upon request by [CONTACT_33668], CPC, SOC, a sponsor, an investigator, or the IRB.   
 
The DCI monitoring team reviews the adeq uacy of informed consent, enrollment of eligible 
patients, implementation of protocol- specified procedures and treatment, adequacy of data 
collection, and appropriateness of adverse event monitoring and reporting. The DCI monitoring team presents final monitoring reports to the DCI Safety Oversight Committee (SOC) highlighting safety concerns and unresolved issues.  The SOC, at a convened meeting, assigns an overall rating of satisfactory, marginal, or unsatisfactory to reflect the overall quality of data, regulatory, consent, eligibility, study conduct and AE reporting.  Corrective action plans (CAPs) are developed, implemented, and evaluated as indicated.  The SOC will notify the sponsor-investigator and DUHS IRB when significant safety concerns are identi fied. 
 
The SOC in concert with DCI monitoring team conducts data and safety monitoring for DUHS sponsor-investigator phase I and II, therapeutic interventional oncology studies that do not have an independent DSMB.  These reviews occur at a minimum every [ADDRESS_739629]’s data will be maintained.  RDSPs will be approved by [CONTACT_562832].  
 
To protect privacy, every reasonable effort will be made to prevent undue access to subjects during the course of the study.  Prospective parti cipants will be consented in a private room or by 
[CONTACT_756], if using e-consent. All research related interactions with the participant will be conducted by [CONTACT_35430].  
 
To protect confidentiality, subject files in paper format will be stored in secure cabinets under lock and key accessible only by [CONTACT_16133]. Subjects will be identified only by a unique study number and subject initials.  Electronic records of subject data will be maintained using a dedicated  REDCap database which is housed in an encrypted and password- protected Duke file 
server.  Access to electronic databases will be limited to the PI [INVESTIGATOR_390071].  Subject data may be stored temporarily on encrypted and password-protected portable memory devices such as flash drives and external hard drives, but only when absolutely necessary.  Data

Project 9:   To Determine the Effects of Normalizing Blood Pressure on Cerebral Blood Flow in 
Hypotensive Individuals with SCI  
 
STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM:  Dysregulation of BP, secondary to decentralized ANS control of the 
cardiovascular system , often results in chronic hypotension and orthostatic hypotension (OH) in persons wi th 
SCI, particularly in those with high cord lesions (i.e., above T6).  While most hypotensive individuals with chronic 
SCI remain asymptomatic and do not complain of symptoms associated with cerebral hypoperfusion, evidence 
of reduced resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) has been reported in association with low systemic BP in the SCI 
(53) and non-SCI  populations (54).  Reduced CBF in hypotensive individuals may lead to cognitive dysfunction, 
and we reported significantly impaired memory and marginally impaired attention processing in hypotensive 
individuals with SCI compar ed to a normotensive SCI cohort (55).   Furthermore, we found that CBF was not 
increased during cognitive testing in individuals with SCI, which may contribute to impaired cognitive function 
compared to non-SCI controls (56).  Although asymptomatic hypotension may have an adverse impact on 
cognitive function (54, 57) and quality of QOL  clinical management of this condition is extremely low . In fact, we 
reported that while nearly 40% of Veterans with SCI were hypotensive, less than 1% carried the diagnosis of hypotension or were prescribed an anti -hypotensive medication (58, 59).  The discr epancy between incidence 
and treatment of asymptomatic hypotension in the SCI population may relate to a paucity of treatment options which are supported by [CONTACT_537542] -hypotensive therapy 
on BP, CBF  and cognitive function.  
 
SPECIFIC AIMS:  
In hypotensive individuals with SCI: 
1. Study 9.1: To determine the dose of each of 3 agents with anti-hypotensive effects [e.g., beta (3) -
adrenoceptor  agonist (mirabegron), an alpha agonist (midodrine) and an anti -cholinergic  
(pyridostigmine) ] that will raise systolic BP (SBP) into the normal range (110-130 mmHg).  
2. Study 9.2: To determine the effect of each agent at the specified dose (i.e., raises SBP into the 
normotensive range) on CBF and cognitive function.  
 
PROPOSED STUDY:  Subjects: Twenty hypotensive individuals with SCI who are chronically injured (> 1 year) 
and in a healthy stable condition will be recruited.  A medical history will be performed prior to investigation; details of the inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented (Human Subjects : Project 9: A nti-HYPO).   
 Study 9.1: Subjects will visit the laboratory between 3 and 9 times to determine the BP effects of three different 
anti-HYPO agents.  These agents will be administered open label, to determine the effective dose for normalizing 
SBP (111 -130 mmHg).  Subjects will remain seated and will be administered the study medication according to 
the dose titration (Table 4) . HR and BP assessments will be recorded every [ADDRESS_700207]-drug.   
 
Study 9.2: Methods: Subjects will visit the laboratory 3 times and the anti -HYPO agents will be administered in 
a random and blinded order at the dose determined in Study 9.1.  Subjects will remain seated and a battery of 
cognitive tests to assess memory and attention processing will be performed with simultaneous recording of HR, 
BP, BR and CBF.  Study medication will then be administered and HR, BP, and CBF assessments will be recorded every 30 minutes for 4 hours.  A second battery of cognitive tests will be administered 2 hours after 
study medication.   
 
DATA AND STATISTICAL ANALYSES:  Repeated measures ANCOVA  models will be constructed to compare 
the effect of study medication on BP and CBF; the covariates in each model will include baseline BP and CBF.  
The alpha level will be set at 0.[ADDRESS_700208] hoc tests on the covariate adjusted BP and CBF values.  Linear 
regression models will then be constructed to compare the relationship between change in BP and change in CBF among the anti -HYPO agents tested.   
 
EXPECTED RESULTS AND BENEFITS: In our proposed studies, a more precise identification of the degree of 
ANS dysfunction (Project 8) and further our understanding of the relationship between systemic BP, CBF and 
cognitive function in individuals with SCI (Project 9) will be achieved.  Data generated from these investigations 
will be used to guide clinical evaluation and treatment algorithm for improving cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and cognitive function in  the SCI population.

2.Description of the Study Including Procedures to be Used:
If you consent to participate in this research study, you will visit the laboratory at the JJPVAMC (7A-
13S) 4 times for about 4 hours each visit. You will refrain from caffeine, alcohol, heavy exercise, and  
smoking for 12 hours prior to arrival and you will refrain from taking sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil  
(Cialis), or other similar medications, for 2-days prior to each of your study visits . Prior to data 
collection a baseline blood draw will be collected. You will remain  seated in your wheelchair for a  
minimum of [ADDRESS_700215] and abdomen area to monitor your heart rate and respi[INVESTIGATOR_696] (breathing)  
rate.  A blood pressure cuff will be placed around your upper right arm and a small blood pressure  
cuff will be placed on your left middle or ring finger. We will place a plastic harness on your head,  
apply gel to your forehead and place an ultrasound probe against your head. We will monitor your  
blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate and blood flow to your brain (CBF) for [ADDRESS_700216] quietly (baseline) prior to administration of the study medication.  Following the baseline  
data  collection  a  series  of  cognitive  tests  focused  on  assessing  memory  and  attention  will  be  
administered. You will then be given  pi[INVESTIGATOR_264136] a glass of water. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_537538],  
pyridostigmine, mirabegron, or midodrine. During each of the four visits, you will take only [ADDRESS_700217]  taken  one  of  each  medication  
including placebo.   You will not know which of the study medications or placebo you will be taking at  
any given visit.  The effective dosage for each medication was determined from your participation in  
the previous “titration” trial. After taking the study medication, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood  
pressure and blood flow to the brain will be monitored for 4-hours and a second battery of cognitive  
tests, similar to the first battery, will be administered [ADDRESS_700218] for a short period of time.  
But if at any time you feel uncomfortable, we will immediately stop the study medication and all  
testing and will monitor your heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure very closely until you  
recover.V A     Department of

during testing.
Cognitive Tests:  These tests evaluate different types of cognitive function such as your short-term,  
and long-term memory, attention processing speed, and executive function. During this time we will  
continuously monitor and record your heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure and blood flow to  
your brain using the equipment attached to you. 
Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) Symptoms Survey : Autonomic dysreflexia is a condition where blood  
pressure increases higher than normal, usually because of a painful or non-painful stimulus below the  
level of your spi[INVESTIGATOR_1828]. Some of the most common causes of AD relate to bowel or bladder  
fullness, tight clothing, or pressure from being in a position for too long, but there may be other  
causes that we are not aware of.  You will be asked to complete an AD symptoms survey during each  
study visit, which will be used to determine your experience with AD over the 7-days prior to the  
study  visit.   This  survey  contains  questions  related  to  symptoms  you  may  have  experienced,  
information about your blood pressure at that time, and possible causes of the AD.
Blood Draws: Blood will be drawn from a vein in your arm or hand twice over the course of each  
study visit. Each blood collection tube will contain about 1.2 teaspoon (6mL) of your blood. Three  
blood  samples  will  be  taken  before  baseline  data  collection  in  the  seated  position.  Three  more  
samples will be taken after the second cognitive test while you are seated. A certified and trained  
researcher will gently insert a very small needle into the vein in your arm to collect the blood. Once  
the blood has been collected, the needle will be removed and the puncture site will be cleaned and  
covered. At each study visit, six tubes of 6mL of blood will be collected. A total amount of 144mL of  
blood will be collected at the end of the four study visits.
All specimens obtained during this study will be stored in the Basic Science Laboratory at The Center  
of  Excellence  on  the  Medical  Consequences  of  Spi[INVESTIGATOR_537540]  J.  Peters  
Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Bronx, NY. All samples will be labeled with a number randomly  
assigned to you, along with the date and information regarding the study. Samples will be stored for  
future analysis specifically related to this study. Samples will be stored until all data related to this  
study has been analyzed and at the end of this period specimens will be destroyed.

You have been told that the study described above may involve the following discomforts: 
You may experience some discomfort when electrodes are removed from skin and some skin  
irritation at the site of electrode placement.
You may experience some discomfort when the blood pressure cuffs around your upper arm  
and your finger is inflated. 
You  may  feel  discomfort  with  the  harness  around  your  head  that  is  used  to  secure  the  
ultrasound probe to your head for assessment of brain blood flow.
Possibly frustration may occur during the thinking tests. You will be encouraged to take  
breaks as needed and you may stop a test at any time and for any reason. 
Since this research may have unknown effects on an unborn child and should not be done  
during pregnancy, it is necessary for a pregnancy test to be done first.  To your knowledge  
you are not pregnant at the present time. You also agree to avoid becoming pregnant (use  
contraceptives, take precautions against becoming pregnant, etc.) during this study.
You may experience some discomfort when the needle is being placed in your arm vein  
during the blood draws. 
4.Expected Risks of Study:
Heart rate, breathing rate, and blood pressure: are all non-invasive measurements and are  
not associated with any known risks. 
You may experience  pain, bruising, and rarely fainting or infection from the blood draws. 
Your  blood  pressure  may be  elevated  above  what  is considered to be  the normal range  
(>140/90 mm Hg) following midodrine, pyridostigmine, and mirabegron administration. If  
this happens, we will take action to help reduce higher pressure; we will loosen any tight  
clothing or braces that you may be wearing; and we will help you check and empty your  
bladder or bowel. If your blood pressure remains high for more than 30 minutes after we  
take  these  measures,  then we  may   provide  medication to lower  your  pressure  back to  
normal. The medication of choice will be sub-lingual (under the tongue) nitroglycerin. 
If after 4-hours of testing your BP remains above your baseline but is not in the hypertensive  
range  (>139/89  mmHg),  you  will  be  sent  home  with  a  24-hour  BP  Holter  monitor  
(Vasomedical-BIOXTM 2301 Wuxi, Jiangsu, China). The monitor will be programmed to obtain  
BP readings every 20 minutes during the daytime and at 30-minute intervals during the  
nighttime. A study coordinator or the PI [INVESTIGATOR_48105]-up with phone calls to you while you are  
at home to assess any side effects and document BP changes.

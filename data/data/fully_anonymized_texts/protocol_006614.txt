 1.0 Background 
 
Currently in the [LOCATION_002] , about 270,000 individuals live with SCI; roughly 12,000 new such injuries occur in 
the nation annually [1]. One of the most significant impairments resulting from SCI is loss of mobility. Surveys of persons with SCI indicate that mobility concerns are amo ng the most prevalent [2], and that chief among 
mobility desires is the ability to stand and walk [3]. In addition to limiting access to places inaccessible by [CONTACT_606425], the inability to stand and walk impedes social inclusion and often results in a depressive psychological impact. As importantly, loss of legged mobility results in substantial secondary adverse health effects: pressure- induced skin complications; increased incidence of pain, muscle spasticity, urinary tract 
infections and  increased  body -mass index (BMI) impaired digestive, lymphatic and vascular functions; and 
decreased bone mineral density (BMD), respi[INVESTIGATOR_696], and cardiovascular capacities [4 -6]. The collective effect of 
such impairments is a substantial decrease in quality of life and substantial increase in health care costs for individuals with SCI.  
 Recently, powered lower limb exoskeletons have emerged onto the landscape of rehabilitative interventions for people with spi[INVESTIGATOR_32692] (SCI). These devices have the potential to provide substantial health benefits, promote neurological and functional recovery, and allow community ambulation for individuals with SCI. Nevertheless, studies have yet to be conducted to substantiate these potential benefits.  
 2.0 Hypotheses , Aims, and Study Outline 
 
Prior Studies regarding Efficacy of Exoskeletons  
Given the relatively recent availability of lower limb exoskeletons, little has been published on the potential health and therapeutic benefits of exoskeleton walking for non -ambulatory individua ls; however, a pi[INVESTIGATOR_834920], with 12 individuals with motor -complete thoracic -level SCI.  Although that 
study’s primary objective was to establish the safety and efficacy of the device for purposes of mobility, it anecdotally f ound improvements in pain, bowel and bladder function, spasticity, and emotional well -being [7]. 
Another small study of exoskeleton walking involving 6 subjects with motor- complete paraplegia found that all 
participants sustained a significant loss of fat tissue mass after 20 -60 hours of use [8]. Since fat tissue mass 
increases the propensity for diabetes and cardiovascular disease [9], such a reduction may decrease 
predisposition towards these conditions.  
 
Studies of supported standing indicate a number o f health benefits for non -ambulatory individuals with SCI, 
including improvements in well -being, circulation, bowel and bladder function, skin integrity, and sleep, in 
addition to reduction in spasticity and pain [10 -12]. The investigators hypothesize that, if such benefits can be 
derived from the stationary nature of a standing frame, substantially more dramatic health benefits can result from walking with a lower limb exoskeleton, since an exoskeleton provides a similar upright weight -bearing 
posture, but  also provides lower limb and coordinated upper body movement, as well as cyclic weight bearing 
shifts from one leg to the other. Since an exoskeleton also provides mobility, and thus utility, it has the potential for much greater frequency and duration of  use, relative to a standing frame, and greater dosing will likely 
increase the benefits of upright weight bearing.   
Hypotheses  
The proposed study is intended to inform the hypotheses that (1) regular dosing of exoskeleton walking will provide health bene fits to non -ambulatory and poorly -ambulatory individuals with SCI, including decreased pain 
and spasticity, improvements in bowel and bladder function, decreased body -mass index (BMI), enhanced well -
being; (2) regular dosing of exoskeleton walking will facilitate neurological or functional recovery in some

 individuals with SCI, particularly those with incomplete injuries; and (3) the level of mobility enabled by a lower 
limb exoskeleton is commensurate with the walking speeds, distances, and surfaces required for community  
ambulation.  
 
Study Outline  
Study 1, as described herein, will assess the three hypotheses, i.e., health benefit, neurological recovery, and mobility benefits, in the context of regular dosing of exoskeleton walking in a clinical setting. These studies will be conducted at three study sites, Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville TN, the James A. Haley Veterans Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834921], and the Mayo Clinic in [COMPANY_002]ster MN. All study sites will conduct an identical study protocol. The  study will involve 24 non- ambulatory and poorly -ambulatory individuals with incomplete 
and complete SCI (i.e., 8 subjects at each site). In this study, “poorly ambulatory” is defined as persons with 
functional independence measure (FIM) gait score of 2 to  6 who may be able to walk short distances with or 
without braces and stability aid, or may be able to walk with assistance of one person, but whose primary means 
of mobility is a manual or power- operated wheelchair. Of the 24 individuals, half will be ind ividuals with motor-
complete injuries (i.e., American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_834922], AIS, A or B), and half with motor-incomplete injuries (i.e., AIS C or D).  As described subsequently in the Study Procedures  section, the study will 
assess the th erapeutic and functional effects of exoskeleton walking over an 8 -week period of treatment, where 
the treatment consists of 3 walking sessions per week, each approximately 1.5 hours in duration for a total of 24 walking sessions . Therapeutic effects will be assessed via a number of measurements recorded primarily at 
study start, at the 4 -week study midpoint, at the 8 -week completion of treatment, and in a follow -up session, 8 
weeks following the conclusion of treatment. Among the primary measurements to be used to assess secondary 
health benefits are dual- energy X- ray absorptiometry scans (DXA) to assess bone mineral density (BMD); 
Modified Ashworth scale (MAS) ratings and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_834923] (SCI -SET) to assess 
effect on spasticity ; body mass to assess BMI; and a self -report questionnaire to assess effect on pain, spasticity, 
bowel and bladder function, skin, and well -being. Neurological effects for non- ambulatory subjects will be 
assessed via neurological examination and the functional reach (FR) test. Neurological effects for poorly -
ambulatory subjects will additionally be assessed via the Functional Independence Measure gait score (FIM -G), 
the Walking Index for Spi[INVESTIGATOR_669537] (WISCI -II), the Ten Meter Walk Test (10MWT), and  the Timed Up and 
Go (TUG) test, all measured while the subject is not wearing the exoskeleton. The level of mobility provided by 
[CONTACT_834933] -complete and motor -incomplete injuries will be assessed by [CONTACT_834934] -G, 
WISCI -II, 10MWT, S ix-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), TUG test, and Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (BRPE), all 
measured while the subject is wearing the exoskeleton.  
 3.0 Description of Intervention: The Indego Exoskeleton  This study will employ the Indego exoskeleton  (Parker H annifin Corp) , shown in Fig. 1, which is a lower limb 
exoskeleton that incorporates powered movement of both hip and knee joints, in addition to built -in ankle -foot-
orthoses (AFOs) at both ankle joints, which provide ankle support and stability, and also t ransfer the weight of 
the exoskeleton to the ground. The Indego exoskeleton requires use of a stability aid, such as a rolling walker or 
set of fore arm crutches . The exoskeleton enables individuals with SCI to stand, walk, and sit, and provides 
nominal walking speeds between approximately 0.3 and 0.6 m/s.  An SCI subject is shown walking with the exoskeleton in Fig. 2. All exoskeleton walking conducted in this study will be conducted with the (contact [CONTACT_182431]) 
assistance of a trained physical therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], as shown in Fig. 2.

FDA Status  and Device Safety  
A recent study of the safety and efficacy of the Indego exoskeleton on [ADDRESS_1159532] -injured individuals, 
conducted at five rehabilitation hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313711], formed the b asis of a 510(k)  application  for FDA approval of 
the exoskeleton. The five hospi[INVESTIGATOR_834924] (Atlanta GA); Craig 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (Denver CO); the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (Chicago IL); Rusk Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] ([LOCATION_001] 
NY); and Kessler Rehabilitation Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] (West Orange NJ). The 510(k) application was submitted in early August 
2015, and is currently under  review at the FDA.  The clinical evaluation report submitted with the 510(k)

 application is included as an attachment with this protocol. The following discussion describing device safety 
was excerpted from page 38 of that report:  
 
Over the 10 month course of the Indego clinical trial completed at the time of this filing, 40 subjects 
each completed the 27 sessions already  described. These subjects included men and women with a wide 
range of characteristics. The height of the subjects ranged from 5’1” to 6’3” (155 cm to 191 cm), weight from 115lbs to 231lbs (52 kg to 105 kg), SCI level from L2 AIS C to T3 AIS A, age from 18 to 64, and time 
since injury from 5 months to 23 years.  
 All Adverse Events (AE’s) were recorded during this study. An AE is defined as: “… any undesirable clinical experience (any sign, symptom, illness, abnormal laboratory value or other medical event) that 
occurs in a subject (or an event that worsens during the course of the study) and that could possibly be 
associated with the investigational product, procedure or medications required by [CONTACT_3181].” A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as: “… an event that is fatal or life -threatening, results in 
persistent or significant disability, requires intervention to prevent permanent impairment, results in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (or prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]) or results in congenital anomaly or malignan cy.” 
 Out of 1,237 total study sessions completed as of July 17, 2015, there were 44 trial- related Adverse 
Events and 0 Serious Adverse Events. Of the 44 trial- related AE’s, 19 were known to be device related. 
These 19 included minor instances of bruising, redness, abrasion, and swelling, as well as one instance of a rolled ankle. The causes of these events were all determined to be related to improper fitting or 
improper padding, except for one case of minor abrasion which was related to a padding malfunc tion.  
 
Of particularly relevance for this study, no serious adverse events occurred during the 1,237 study sessions 
completed with the Indego during the 10 -month FDA study trial.  
 
IRB Determination  of NSR  in Previous Studies  
Although a 510(k) application was submitted to the FDA in August 2015, d ue to the lengthy process entailed in 
the de novo FDA process, it is unlikely FDA approval will be issued in advance of the study start date. The investigators note, however, that all five of the IRBs at the aforem entioned study sites involved in the FDA trials 
determined the exoskeleton to be  non-significant risk (NSR).  
 Additionally, the Vanderbilt IRB has reviewed a number of prior related studies (since 2009) involving the Indego exoskeleton, and predecessors to it. In every case, the intervention has been determined to be non -significant 
risk (NSR), including active studies IRB no. [ADDRESS_1159533] occurred during any of those studies, which collectively encompass hundreds of hours of exoskeleton use over a period of several years, and with approximately ten to fifteen different SCI subjects of varying injury levels.

 5.0 Enro llment  
 
Eight subjects will be recruited from the clinical practices and surrounding communities for each of the three data collection sites.  Subjects will be enrolled if they satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria outlined above , and 
agree to the [ADDRESS_1159535] search engines will all be used to recruit potential subjects. In addition, subjects will be identified during outpatient clinical visits by [CONTACT_834936]. Subjects  will be  identified through lists and medical 
records. Onc e enrolled , subjects will be reimbursed $2 5 per visit for their involvement, in addition to receiving 
mileage and parking reimbursement for travel to and from their trial si tes.   
 6.0 Study Procedures  
 
Design:  
This study will include [ADDRESS_1159536] of 31 sessions spanning 18 weeks in total, comprising a combination of 4 assessment, 3 training, and 24 treatment sessions. The 24 treatment sessions each consists of approximately 1 hour of walking in 
the exoskeleton, although 1.5 hours are allotted to account for donning/doffing, measurement of vital signs, skin 
checks, etc., and will be delivered 3 times per week over an 8 -week period.  
 
Intervention  
The intervention will be carried out identically at all sites  and will be comprised of 31 sessions at the subjects’ 
trial site, including 4 assessment sessions (pre, mid, immediately post treatment, and [ADDRESS_1159537] -treatment), 3 
exoskeleton fitting/training sessions, and 24 intervention sessions. The interventions at each site will be administered by a PT experienced in locomotor training for individuals with SCI. Parker Hannifin will provide exoskeleton -specific training at each site, in order to ensure safe, effective implementation and use of the 
exoskeletons. A summary of each session’s activity and measurements follows:  
 
• Session 1: Informed consent and pre -treatment health and neurological assessment, including  PT evaluation 
and Dexa  Scan (x -ray pi[INVESTIGATOR_834927]) of the distal femur and proximal tibia locations , and drawing  about 
2 teaspoons (9.5 mL) of blood to check A1C (measures the amount of hemoglobin in the blood that has 
glucose attached to it) and Lipid Panel to measure cholesterol levels ( lasting  4 hrs) . 
• Sessions 2 -4: Exoskeleton fitting, adjustment, and training sessions (3 sessions  per week lasting 1.5 h ours 
per session) 
• Sessions 5 -16: Exoskeleton treatment consisting of walking in the exoskeleton during a 1.5 -hr session,  with 
breaks as needed, and with sit -to-stand, turning, and stand -to-sit maneuvers as appropriate ( 3 sessions per 
week lasting 1.5 hours). Note that sessions 15 and 16 are additionally used for assessment of the mobility provided by [CONTACT_830739].  
• Sessio n 17: Mid -treatment health and neurological assessment (
lasting 3- 4 hours ). 
• Sessions 18 -29: Exoskeleton treatment consisting of walking in the exoskeleton during a 1.5 -hour session, 
with breaks as needed, and with sit -to-stand, turning, and stand -to-sit ma neuvers as appropriate ( 3 sessions 
per week lasting 1.5 hours per session ). Note that sessions 28 and 29 are also used for assessment of the 
mobility provided by [CONTACT_830739].

9 
 • Session 30: Post -treatment health and neurological assessment, within 3 days of session 29 , including Dexa 
Scan (x -ray pi[INVESTIGATOR_834927]) of the distal femur and proximal tibia locations , and and 2 teaspoons (9.5 
mL) of blood to check A1C (measures the amount of hemoglobin in the blood that has glucose attached to it) 
and Lipid P anel to measure cholesterol levels  (lasting 3 -4 hours ). 
• Session 31: Follow -up health and neurological assessment, including Dexa Scan (x -ray pi[INVESTIGATOR_834927]) of 
the distal femur and proximal tibia locations , and 2 teaspoons (9.5 mL) of blood to check y our A1C 
(measures the amount of hemoglobin in the blood that has glucose attached to it) and Lipid Panel to measure cholesterol levels , 8 weeks following session 30 ( lasting 3 -4 hours ). 
 Women of child bearing potential will have a urine pregnancy test at baseline , and in s essions 1 7, 30 and 31 . 
 
Outcome Measures  
The various measures employed in Study 1 are summarized below:  
 
Measures assessing physiological (i.e., health) effects:  
• DXA: Assessment of changes in BMD over treatment course. Scans will be tak en at the distal femur and 
proximal tibia locations.  
• Spasticity rating: MAS, used to assess changes in degree of spasticity over course of treatment. Physical Therapy  will assign a gross MAS score for the upper and lower extremities immediately after exos keleton 
use as well as on the following day, in order to characterize acute and non -acute effects of exoskeleton use 
on spasticity.  
• SCI-SET: [ADDRESS_1159538]- treatment follow -up.  
• Weight: Subjects will be weighed pre -treatment, at treatment midpoint, following treatment, and at an [ADDRESS_1159539]-treatment follow -up.  
• Subject self -report health questionnaire, including questions regarding pain, spasticity, bowel and bladder 
function, skin, and well -being.  
 
Measures assessing neurological or functional recovery:  
• International Standard for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNCSCI, R2011). Neurological exams will assess 
status of neurological recovery. Since inclusion criteria restrict inclusion to chronic injury (i.e., at least [ADDRESS_1159540] -injury) , significant changes in neurological testing would 
presumably be a result of treatment. This exam will include manual muscle testing (MMT) for subjects with incomplete injury.  
• For subjects who are poorly -ambulatory: FIM gait score, WISCI -II rating, 10MWT,  and TUG test, all while the 
subject is not wearing the exoskeleton.  
• FR test will be performed while subject is sitting to assess potential changes in trunk control and/or 
strength.  
• Borg Reported Percieved Exertion Scale (BRPE)  
 
Measures assessing level of mobility enabled by [CONTACT_834937], all measured while 
subject is using the exoskeleton:  
• The 10MWT as a measure of gait speed.  
• The TUG test measures ability to independently sit, stand, walk, turn, and return to sitting. The TUG test will be used as a measure of mobility independence.

Institution/Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]: Vanderbilt University  and Medical Center  
 
10 
 • The 6MWT measures gait speed over a six- minute period. This test provides a controlled measure of 
endurance, and provides a secondary measure of gait speed.  
• The BRPE measures perceived exertion dur ing walking and will be assessed in this protocol during the 6MWT.  
 
Additional measures taken during each session will include:  
• Vital signs at start of each session (blood pressure and heart rate)  
• Number of steps taken during each training session (measure d by [CONTACT_834938])  
• Monitoring of skin integrity at exoskeleton contact [CONTACT_360222], following each session  
 
Schedule of Assessments  
The study will include 4 primary assessments characterizing health and neurological effects of exoskeleton use, in 
addition to 2 primary assessments characterizing level of mobility provided by [CONTACT_830739]. The assessments 
characterizing potential health include DXA, MAS, SCI -SET tests, weight, and a self -report questionnaire. The 
assessments characterizing potential neurological or functional recovery include the MMT and FR tests, and for poorly -ambulatory subjects, also include the FIM -G, WISCI -II, 10MWT, and TUG tests, all performed without the 
exoskeleton. This battery of assessments is expected to require 3 -4 hours, and will  occur 4 times during the study as 
follows: pre -treatment (at study start, session 1), mid -treatment (after 4 weeks of treatment, session 17), post-
treatment (after 8 weeks  of treatment, session 30), and [ADDRESS_1159541]- treatment  (session 31). Note that DXA  will 
not be measured at mid -treatment, in order to mitigate associated costs, since an [ADDRESS_1159542] treatment sessions at treatment midpoint (i.e., after 4 weeks of treatment, during sessions 15 and 16) and at treatment en d (i.e., after 8 weeks of 
treatment, during sessions 28 and 29). Note that the TUG test is performed on a separate day from the other assessments, to mitigate the number of tests to complete in a single session. Note also that the 10MWT will be administere d once during each quarter of treatment, since the test is informative and easily administered, and 
thus will not substantially disrupt a session of typi[INVESTIGATOR_834928].  
 
The scheduling of assessment for each s ubject is provided in the chart bel ow.

Schedule of Treatment and Outcome Measures Associated with Study 1  
 
Data Analysis  
Table 1  lists the relationships between the outcome measures and each hypothesis. Given that each patient is in a 
chronic stage of injury (i.e., spontaneous changes in health and neurological status are unlikely or minimal), the 
investigators assume that any statistically significant change in the outcome measures between pre - and post -
treatment will have resulted from treatment. Since all measures are quantitative, including the self- report and SCI-
SET, testing the respective hypotheses entails testing the extent to which the pre - and post -treatment means, of 
respective measurements across all subjects, are different. As such, the investigators will employ paired -sample t -
tests to test the extent to which pre- and post -treatment means are statistically different, by [CONTACT_18120] a 95% 
confidence level in the analysis, unless results indicate a more appropriate confidence level for a given set of data. In addition to using paired t -tests for validating differences in means, and establishing associated confidence levels  in 
those differences, analysis of variance (ANOVA) methods will be employed when determining statistical significance of differences in means between multiple data sets, with 95% confidence levels. Specifically, ANOVA will be used when assessing differenc es in means between pre -, mid -, post -, and [ADDRESS_1159543] population 
into appropriate groups, such as: motor -complete a nd motor -incomplete individuals; non- ambulatory and poorly -
ambulatory ones; individuals with tetraplegia and those with paraplegia; persons with upper paraplegia and those 
with lower paraplegia; etc. For example, measures associated with walking while not wearing the exoskeleton will only be recorded for poorly -ambulatory individuals; neurological recovery is not expected for individuals with motor-
complete injuries (while perhaps possible, such recovery is not hypothesized here); and individuals with tetra plegia 
are less likely to achieve walking speeds and levels of independence commensurate with community ambulation, relative to individuals with paraplegia. For these groups, ANOVA techniques will be employed to assess differences in Outcome

 7.0 Risks of Investigational Devices  
 
Risks: 
See s ection 3  of this document. As stated in that section, following over 1200 hours of exoskeleton walking with 
40 subjects with SCI, no serious adverse events occurred. As such, risks to subjects are expected to be minimal.  
 
Potential be nefits:  
The intent of the study is to characterize potential health and mobility benefits provided by [CONTACT_830739]. As such, there is no clearly -established medical evidence of health benefits resulting from exoskeleton walking. 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_6831], the investigators hypothesize that subjects will experience improvements in well- being, circulation, 
bowel and bladder function, skin integrity, and sleep, in addition to reductions in spasticity and pain.  Moreover, subjects with incomplete SCI may experience neur ological and/or functional improvement.  
 Regarding the general population of individuals with SCI, if exoskeleton use substantially mitigates the 
prevalence of secondary impairments, as hypothesized herein, these devices could substantially decrease the 
cost of health care for individuals with SCI. If such use is found to facilitate neurological and/or functional 
recovery for patients with motor -incomplete injuries, the intervention could have a substantial impact on 
improving rehabilitative outcomes for large numbers of individuals.

 8.0 Clinical Monitoring Plan and Reporting of Adverse Events  
 
Good clinical practice monitoring:  Each site will employ an independent medical monitor, who will review the 
study protocol prior to each study; observe the init ial treatment session of the first subject in each study; and be 
apprised of any AE at any site in the study.  
 Safety monitoring:
 Safety monitoring and oversight will be performed by [CONTACT_834939].  All PIs will have 
the authority temporarily or permanently to discontinue a particular protocol and/or the involvement of a given 
subject, if deemed necessary or appropriate for the safety of the subject. If any concern or unexpected issue is identified with one subject that could be of potential risk  or concern to other subjects, action will be taken by 
[CONTACT_834940], mitigate, and/or eliminate such risk from the study. Any AE will 
be reported immediately, i.e., within 24 hours, to the site study coordinator and site PI. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_834929]. The site PI [INVESTIGATOR_834930], and to the lead site study coordinator and PI.  
 
Risk management and emergency response:  
Risks will be managed by [CONTACT_834941]:  
• A licensed PT will directly supervise all sessions.  
• A safety gait belt or overhead harness will be utilized at the discretion of the supervising PT.  
• Blood pressure and heart rate will be mo nitored throughout each session to ensure vital signs fall within the 
recommended ranges for locomotor training activity.  
 Any AE will be reported immediately, i.e., within [ADDRESS_1159548] the authority   to temporarily or 
permanently discontinue a particular protocol and/or the involvement of a given subject, if deemed necessary or appropriate, for the safety of the subject.  If any concern or unexpected issue is identified with one subject that could 
be of potential risk or concern to other subjects, the data and safety monitoring team will take action to address, mitigate, and/or eliminate such risk from the study.  
 If deter mined by [CONTACT_834942] a direct result of the tests or 
treatments involved in this study, each respective site will cover the cost of immediate medical care provided at that site to treat the injury. Neit her the study, nor each site, will be responsible for the costs of additional care.  
 9.0 Study Withdrawal/Discontinuation  Subjects can choose to discontinue participation in the study at any time. If the investigators feel that the safety of 
the participant, or others, is compromised for any reason during the study, that subject will be withdrawn from the 
study.  
 
10.0 Privacy/Confidentiality Issues  
 All data, dexa scans, videos, and photographs recorded during this study will be held in a secured location at the trial site. Data will continue to be held until the study researchers deem the data is no longer scientifically relevant, at which point the data will be destroyed. All data will be de -identified prior to publication.  
The research team wil l take photographs and record videos of participants throughout this study. The participants 
entire body including their face will be included. The purpose of the photographs and videos is to help participants

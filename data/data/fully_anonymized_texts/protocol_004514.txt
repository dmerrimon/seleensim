12/17/[ADDRESS_783774] rates of hazardous alcohol use .2-5 Community colleges serv e over 12 million students,6 
comprising 45% of all U.S. college students.6-8 Community college students (CCS) show rates of heavy alcohol 
use similar to students at traditional four-year residential (FYR) colleges,3,9-[ADDRESS_783775] exclusively on studen ts at FYR colleges . CCS differ from those at FYR colleges  in 
several ways; CCS are more likely to have multiple roles and responsibilities (e.g., employment), drive more 
(to/from campus), live with family, and socialize off campus, and thus require interve ntion approaches tailored 
to their life circumstances. Community colleges are less likely to offer health services than FYR institutions13,14 
and typi[INVESTIGATOR_594081], such as in -person motivational counseling.15 Approaches are needed that can reach CCS 
and provide harm -reducing interventions that fit with the needs and resources of community colleges.    
Live Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594082] /Brown University and local 
community c ollege s, conducted an initial evaluation of a text message  (TxM) -delivered alcohol intervention ,16-18 
developed  for, and in collaboration with, CCS . We obtained strong initial results from our  pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (section 4.2) 
following the [ADDRESS_783776] an application (app) that will 
incorporate the TxM messages as a n app -resident  personal coach  (“CARES coach ”), with additio nal features 
and functionality requested by [CONTACT_594128][INVESTIGATOR_4251].  After obtaining user feedback (2 rounds) we will 
complete programming in both iOS and Android languages ( 4.2.e  for benchmarks). To ensure that the 
College Alcohol Risk Education Syste m (CARES)  is well positioned to get into the community college 
marketplace, it is critical to demonstrate efficacy .  
In Phase II , we will conduct an efficacy trial of CARES compared to an alcohol education program that 
would be feasible for most community colleges to adopt, thus providing a real -world comparison with data 
suitable to support our efforts in future commercialization. We also seek to identify the types of individuals for 
whom CARES  is more or less effective (Aim 2.2), and identify areas where it might be improved (A ims 2.3) .  
Phase I Aims for the 12 month period  are:  
Aim 1.1.  Develop wireframes, design and adapt the pr ogram to an Android platform app with added 
features ( section 4.4.c ). The app ’s personal coach  (“CARES coach ”) will deliver messages designed to 
encourage responsible alcohol use, provide motivational messages tailored to the participant, and push 
notifications at times when risky alcohol consumption is most likely to occur. Other app features will include 
drink l ogging and tracking, providing  transportation locators, calculating  cost-savings from reduced use, 
encourage peer support, and monitor progress based on a participant’s goals (3 months).   
Aim 1.2. Conduct two one-month iterative tests  of the CARES app, ea ch with [ADDRESS_783777] for a ‘hackathon’ where  pi[INVESTIGATOR_594083] (6 months) .  
Aim 1.3. After any needed final programming adjustment and debugging o f the CARES app and 
programming , a parallel app will be built for the iOS platform . Project staff will pi[INVESTIGATOR_594084]. (3  month s).  
Phase II  Aims for the 24 month period  are:  
Aim 2.1. Conduct a rigorous randomized trial of  the CARES  program  compared to a brief alcohol 
education intervention (AE) with follow up assessments at 3 and 6 months.  H1) CARES  will result in 
significantly greater reductions in heavy epi[INVESTIGATOR_594085] -related problems  at end of treatment and 
follow -up compared to AE  (analyses in section 4.4 .h.).  
Aim 2.2. Identify sub -populations for whom CARES  is more or less effective.  We will examine differences 
in relevant biological, social/demographic, and alcohol use variables as potential moderators of intervention 
efficacy. These include age  (e.g., over/under age 21) , gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, parental status, 
employment  and level of heavy drinking at program enrollment ( section 4.4.h.).  
Aim 2.3. Investigate participant reactions to the CARES  system, including text ratings, response la tency, 
sharing of texts, and text content ( by [CONTACT_122106] ). These data will be used to predict alcohol use outcomes within 
the CARES  group during intervention (using week -level observations) and at follow -up, to determine promising 
directions for future research  (section 4. 4.e).  
Future Commercialization : With over 1, 400 community college systems across the U.S. this seems an 
opportune moment to be targeting this market for health promotion products such as the CARES app.  With an 
increasing number of states offering free  community college to state residents, the demand fo r services is likely 
to increase rapi[INVESTIGATOR_594086].  
2. SIGNIFICANCE  
2.1 Alcohol Use among Community College Students:  Community college students (CCS), nearly half of all 
college students nationwide,6-[ADDRESS_783778] higher rates of driving under the 
influence than students at traditional 4 -year/residential (FYR) colleges.9 CCS differ from FYR students in many  
ways. They are more: (1) racially diverse, (2) likely t o be part -time students, (3) likely to come from lower 
income families, (4)  likely to be concurrently employed, and (5) likely to have children at home.22,[ADDRESS_783779] less exposure to 
any on -campus risk reduction approaches compared to traditional college students. Approaches that can 
deliver effective alcohol harm reduction messages to CCS using a modality th at is flexible, accessible, 
and tailored to their specific needs are urgently needed.   
2.2 Computer -Delivered Interventions: Computer Delivered interventions (CDIs) for behavior change can be 
administered at home or at school, and are promising given their  wider reach and lower administrative burden 
than face -to-face interventions.[ADDRESS_783780] extensive evaluation with college populations are AlcoholEdu34 and 
e-Checkup To Go (e -CHUG).[ADDRESS_783781] shown no 
differences relative to controls.40 e-CHUG is a 1 -session online alcohol intervention that provides normative 
feedback about one’s risks related to the amount of alcohol consumed, estimates of blood alcohol 
concentration, and alcohol -related consequences, and takes 20 -30 minutes to complete. O f the seven studies 
comparing e -CHUG to an assessment only control (AO),36,41-[ADDRESS_783782] not been develop ed for the community college population. They are not being used with  or 
tested in this population, and are typi[INVESTIGATOR_594087] e or are inappropriate for community colleges  (see 
Commercialization Plan for comparisons) .  
A likely alternative for community colleges seeking to institute alcohol programs is Check -Your -Drinking 
(www.CheckYourDrinking.net ). Check -Your -Drinking  (CYD) provides normative feedback on the user’s 
drinking habits relative to peers. Alcohol interventions  such as CYD  that provide normative feedback are rated 
by [CONTACT_594129], and with few administrative or structural 
barriers to implementation , thus making it suitable for community colleges.[ADDRESS_783783] target party and drink planning and are not focused on reduci ng drinking or 
associated risks.  The fe w that do target drinking reduction and/or risk reduction , tend to be non -evidence 
based, of poor quality ,[ADDRESS_783784] been tested among college populations.50  
2.3 Why an App? The number of alcohol -related apps is proliferating, none  of them to date are based on a 
solid psychological framework  and sup ported by [CONTACT_62866][INVESTIGATOR_33727].[ADDRESS_783785] could be perceived as encouraging  alcohol use.50  A common 
feature of commercially available apps – a calculator for estimating blood alcohol content (eBAC), may even be 
ill-advised , as recent s tudies have shown that apps with eBAC calculators tend to be inaccurate, in effective, 
and often actually increased college student drinking.52,[ADDRESS_783786] drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_594088] f eedback are more likely to be used than other 
methods (e.g., IVR, Internet) and have been shown to improve user engagement and reduce heavy drinking.[ADDRESS_783787] highly rated features in a review of alcohol reduction apps.58 Approximately 94% of Americans 
aged [ADDRESS_783788] segment of the college -age population.  
2.4 Why  Use Text Messaging  Within an App ?: Mobile  phones can integrate interventions into students’ 
everyday lives. Over 95% of U.S. adults (100% of those ages 18 -29) use mobile phones.59 Text messaging 
(TxM) is nearly ubiquitous among young adults, crossing all income levels and ethnic groups.[ADDRESS_783789] students in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]  (87%) had phone plans that 
allow unlimited texting.61,[ADDRESS_783790] an extremely hig h read rate, with 95% being read 
within [ADDRESS_783791] as 
“small pushes” reinforcing thought processes about making behavioral change.70  The CARES program is 
designed to send messages at targeted times (i.e., weekend s & evenings) that may assist with preparatory 
cognitions and behaviors associated with managing risk in alcohol use situations.  A recent s ystematic search 
(April, 2017) found 3 RCTs  evaluating TxM interventions  for alcohol use among young adults , all showing 
significant improvement in alcohol reduction.71-72 Our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268]16-18 also showed positive results on drin king 
behaviors (section 4.2.) .  
2.5 Mechanisms : The development of our initial text message delivered intervention ( section 4.2.)  was guided 
by [CONTACT_594130] (SCT) and the Stages of Change  (SOC).  Interventions using SCT and SOC have 
shown predictive relationships for alcohol re duction.73,[ADDRESS_783792] is self-efficacy .78 Bandura79 postulated that enhanced self -efficacy influen ces behavior change 
by [CONTACT_594131], persistence despi[INVESTIGATOR_594089], and degree of 
success. For example, l ower drink refusal self -efficacy predicts higher alcohol consumption in college student 
samples.80 CARES text messages target self -efficacy for reducing drinking and for using harm -reduction 
strategies, and may lead to  increased persistence in efforts to reduce drinking despi[INVESTIGATOR_594090] . In our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594091] (section 4.2.). 
Protective Behavioral Strategies  (PBS) are skills and behaviors employed during drinking situations that are 
expected to attenuate heavy drinking and related consequences (e.g., a lternating alcoholic & non -alcoholic 
drinks)  and are associated with lower rates of alcohol use and related c onsequences.81-[ADDRESS_783793] been shown to  mediate al cohol intervention 
outcomes.88,89 Examples of CARES messages and how they draw from theory are noted in Table 2 .  
2.6 Moderators of Intervention Efficacy: Identifying for whom the program is most effective, and perhaps 
more importantly, for whom the program needs to be improved, is important for finalizing development and/or 
designin g new versions for future marketing. We will investigate possible moderators including age ,[ADDRESS_783794] been related to outcomes in other studies of young adult 
drinkers. We will also examine possible moderators specifically relevant for our population, including marital, 
parental, and employment  status.  
2.7 Mobile Health (mHealth) Specific Processes:  The interaction between individuals and the technology 
may be especially relevant to understanding how, and for whom the program is effective.92-97 mHealth 
modalities allow the observation of engagement and response at the level of the micro -intervention (i.e., each 
message). Objective data on latency to response and subjective data on participant’s appraisal of messages 
(for example)  may inform our product evaluation. Furthermore, program content, like text messages may be 
shared with others (via screenshots, message forwarding, etc.); and such sharing is a likely indicator of 
engagement. We will use responses to individual text messa ges, weekly texted surveys, and outcome surveys 
to examine the association between engagement with CARES and alcohol outcomes . We believe this 
approach to investigating the interaction of the participant with an mHealth intervention is novel and should 
give us insight into user acceptance of the CARES program.   
2.[ADDRESS_783795]: The proposed study will greatly enhance programs 
available to community college students, who comprise nearly half of all U.S. college studen ts. In P hase II we 
will greatly expand the availability of  CARES by [CONTACT_594132] I. Efficacy data will provide crucial assistance  to commercialization efforts. In addition, 
data on moderators and mediating variables will identify areas of weakness in the program and help guide 
additional e fforts to improve the prod uct.  
Evidence Base : The extant scientific literature shows that individual -level strategies that include personalized 
normative feedbac k (PNF; i.e., personalized feedback about the individual’s quantity and frequency of alcohol 
use, risks, and alcohol -related problems; comparing their own alcohol use to actual use by [CONTACT_591477]), skills -
training (e.g., approaches to limit alcohol use suc h as alternating alcohol with water, self -monitoring drinking 
behaviors), and goal -setting are the most effective strategies to reduce drinking and its harmful 
consequences.47,76,77 The text messages delivered in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594092] (section 4.2.b -c).  Ultimately, we hope to produce a product 
that draws its evidence base from three sources: 1) the scientifi c literature (e.g., text messages 
focusing on protective behavioral strategies , personalized feedback  and building self -efficacy, see 
section 2.5) ; 2) Data from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594093] I and Phase II trials showing that our planned app 
features are desire d by [CONTACT_594133] (section 4.2.b) ; and 3) successful results of our planned 
phase II RCT showing that the CARES app is effective for reducing heavy epi[INVESTIGATOR_594094] -related problems.    
CARES is custom designed for th e community college student  population , in that it is delivered entirely 
through mobile phones, making it accessible to CCS who are more likely to have multiple competing 
responsibilities compared to traditional college students. CARES also has the potential for high impact b y using 
delivery methods (TxM and smartphone app) that are very familiar to the target population and eliminate 
barriers to access. Moreover, we have targeted pro duct price to be low -cost (see Commercialization P lan) as it 
requires no in -person counselors, and requires only online access to set up,  making it easy to disseminate and 
thus, more likely to be adopted by [CONTACT_594134].  The CARES product will have  high public health 
significance, because reducing h eavy drinking lowers morbidity, and it targets a large, diverse, under -served 
group that has significant health benefit to g ain by [CONTACT_594135].  
3. INNOVATION  
The proposed research represents a unique evaluation of a promising and unique alcohol  intervention. There 
are several innovations in this study:  
1. This will be the first investigation to evaluate the efficacy of a smartphone app targeting hazardous drinking 
among community college students , a neglected and under -served population  for alcoho l prevention 
programs .  
2. This is the first study that we know of targeting alcohol that will compare a stand -alone mobile phone -
delivered program to an  active comparison condition.  
3. This study will examine the user’s interaction with the app as a potentiall y important characteristic that may 
influence efficacy.   
4. The CARES  content is uniquely suited to the target population in that it addresses issues pertinent to CCS 
and was developed in collaboration with the target population (section 4.2) and messages are  delivered on 
a default schedule recommended by [CONTACT_594136] , but which can be tailored to the individual .16-18  
5. The CARES content is delivered in circumstances that are ecologically valid because it is accessible at any 
time or location and concentrates on high -risk days.  
6. Data obtained from the participants’ responses to questions that CARES sends by [CONTACT_594137].  
4. APPROACH  
4.1 Preliminary Studies/Previous Work : Our research & development team has a history of collaboration in 
the development, revision, and evaluation of web -based and mobile phone technologies to promote behavior 
change, and collaborated on the initial development work (R21AA021014).16-18 Christopher Deutsch  (PI), and 
Robert Foster  (Co-I) co-founded Li ve Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594095].  
Both [CONTACT_594174] and [CONTACT_594175] worked with William Flanagan  (Co-I/Chief Technical Director ) to develop the 
programming architecture for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594096]. [CONTACT_594176] also has extensive experience in app 
development. [CONTACT_594177]  is a health psychologist with over 20 years’ experience  developi[INVESTIGATOR_594097] (exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol reduction) delivered through print, in -
person, Internet and mobile platforms, and was the PI [INVESTIGATOR_594098] (R21AA021014) that developed 
the message contents for CARES.16-[ADDRESS_783796]. Traficant e (Consultant) is an Associate Professor at the 
Community College of RI who worked with us on our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594099]. [CONTACT_455817] -Sheldon  has worked with [CONTACT_594177] on studies assessing TxM -delivered interventions to reduc e alcohol 
consumption , behavioral interventions to reduce alcohol use among college students, and on meta -analys es 
on alcohol interventions and text message interventions. She brings expertise in alcohol intervention  
development, refinement, and assessment as well as  sophisticated data analyses including moderators of 
alcohol use in young adults.32,64,76,77,[ADDRESS_783797] trained in behavioral medicine 
with extensive experience in the coll ection and analysis of qualitative data for mHealth16,64,98-102 and other 
behavioral intervention designs;103-106 she has experience on 5 NIH funded mHealth projects —two of them with 
[CONTACT_594177] —which use qualitative data for app and text message delivery of health information. Our expertise in 
the development and e valuation of mHealth technologies, behavioral health and alcohol interventions16-18,62 
makes us uniquely qualified to carry out this research (also see Bios ketches).  
4.1.b Needs Assessment for Alcohol Risk Reduction in Community College Students:  Drs. Bock & 
Traficante conducted a needs assessment to examine alcohol use, negative consequences of drinking, and 
technology use among CCS ( N = 141; 58% female; 78 % white, 13% Hispanic; Age M = 20.9).[ADDRESS_783798] 2 -week 
heavy drinking was reported by 44% of participants, over 70% h ad experienced negative consequences of 
drinking in the past year, and 29% reported driving under the influence. TxM was far more commonly used 
than either voice calls or accessing the Internet via mobile phone ( ps < .001). This study provides evidence of 
a need for alcohol interventions in our target population.   
4.2. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a Text Messaging Program for Reducing Alcohol Risk for CCS:  
4.2.a. Overview of Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] : Our goal was to assist CCS to identify high -risk situations and barriers to alcohol 
reduction and to help them identify personal motivators and strategies that will move them toward reducing the 
harm associated with alcohol use. Work was conducted in four phases: (1) initial focus groups with the target 
population to refine the intervention design; (2) a series of meetings with an advisory board consisting of 
individuals from the target population who both drafted and rated message contents for the program; and (3) 
design of the program for text -message delivery, and (4) a pi[INVESTIGATOR_2269].  Note that the pi[INVESTIGATOR_594100] -only (no app) and was then called “ TMAP ” for “Text Message Alcohol Intervention .” 
4.2.b. Formative Research : Inclusion criteria f or these focus group participants were : (1) age 18 -29 years, (2) 
current CCS, (3) at least 1 epi[INVESTIGATOR_594101] (HD= 4+ drinks for females, 5+ for males on a single 
occasion) in the past 2 weeks, and (4) use TxM.  Of 40 individuals screened, 26 were eligible and enrolled.  We 
conducted 5 focus groups.62 Participants provided feedback on the desired length  of the program (most 
preferred 12 weeks) and proposed features . Features requested by [CONTACT_594138] (1)  ability to easily 
record drinks consumed [ self-monitoring ], (2) cost calculators , and ( 3) easy links to  safe transportation . They 
also gave feedback on themes related to drinking that were important  to them including: drinking wisely, 
accessing  transportation and ensuring sexual safety. Participants reported that messages should apply to 
specific drinking contexts, including “pre -game” and “post -game” messages. Importantly, participants strongly 
endorsed the idea that the texts should deliver a message of caring  (e.g., “ Drink responsibly, someone at 
home loves you ”). Many specifically stated that messages containing instructions to avoid or stop drinking 
altogether were not acceptable. This idea (i.e., “Don’t tell me not to drink, tell me you care how I drink”) was 
strongly endorsed by [CONTACT_55473]. In sum, feedback from focus groups indic ated that the program should 
use a harm -reduction rather than abstinence -based approach, and that messages should consist of 
educational texts to inform and motivate safe drinking . 
4.2.c. Developi[INVESTIGATOR_594102] : It became evident during focus groups that CCS did not like texts 
written by [CONTACT_594139]: They stated that texts needed to be written by [CONTACT_594140] . 
We convened an advisory panel of heavy drinking CCS to help construct the program messages. Panelists 
actively composed intervention texts using their mobile phones during panel meetings and during the week 
between meetings and sent these texts to the study phone line for data collection. Each week the investigative 
team asked participa nts to prepare texts on a subject that had emerged from the focus groups (e.g., caring, 
planning, pre -gaming, safety). Study investigators created a library of text messages promoting the use 
of protective behavioral strategies , encouraging goal -setting an d providing personalized normative 
feedback , strategies which have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in research trials .81-86,[ADDRESS_783799] John McWhorter, 
who describes texting as “fingered speech” w ith its own structure and specific rules.107 Importantly, this new 
linguistic form is not as easily or as effec tively “spoken” by [CONTACT_21140]  - like most people learning a new 
language, when researchers write texts they sound like “non -native speakers.” This developmental work 
reflects our ability to respond to the needs of the  target  population with innovative and engaging methods .17,18  
4.2.d. Pi[INVESTIGATOR_4238] : We used flyers, Internet ads and classroom presentations to recruit participants who 
met the same inclusion criteria used in the formative research above. Enrollment was conducted th rough the 
study website which provided a description of the research, informed consent with electronic signature, the 
baseline assessment, and  randomization to either the TxM intervention or an attention control (CTL). 
Randomization was stratified on gender and heavy drinking (lower risk <3, high risk >[ADDRESS_783800] 
2 weeks). The TMAP intervention consisted of 6 weeks  of two text mes sages sent in the evenings Thursday 
through Sunday. TMAP participants could also text Keywords to the program and receive automated reply 
texts that provided the number for local cab companies (keyword: Cab), online drink cost calculators (keyword: 
Cost), and additional tips on reducing drinking in specific situations (keywords: Party, Club). Those in the CTL 
group received general motivational, non -alcohol -related texts on the same schedule as the TMAP arm.  
Assessments conducted at baseline, end of interve ntion (week 6) and 12 -week follow -up included a Timeline 
Follow -back for alcohol use ,108,109 and measures of alcohol problems, protective behavioral strategies to limit 
drinking,110 and self -efficacy in being able to limit/control drinking.[ADDRESS_783801] generation TMAP program used a hybrid we b/SMS application implemented with the Live 
Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594103] 5 (JEE) and Debian GNU/Linux. JEE is an industry -
standard framework for development of server applications; among other services, JEE provides web reques t 
processing (with the Servlet API [INVESTIGATOR_594104]), data management (with the Java Persistence API), 
and distributed queuing (with the Java Message Service). Debian is an operating -system distributor, which 
packages, tests, distributes, and patches a wide -range of robust system and network tools.   
 Results: Feasibilit y: Our targeted enrollment of 40 participants was easily met and exceeded , with 62 
individuals enrolled in 1 month. Of participants, 39% were men, 44% were under 21 years of age, and 36%  
were high -risk heavy drinkers. All text messages were sent as programmed. Acceptability : Each text message 
was followed by a reminder text asking participants to reply with a rating from 1 -10 indicating how much they 
liked the message (we use “Liking” because it is a familiar concept to young adults who tend to have 
experience with Facebook and similar social media websites). This procedure acted as an intervention fidelity 
check to ensure the message had been received, and provided evaluative feedback about message content. 
Most (96%) respondents rated all texts received. Average ratings of TMAP and CTL messages were high ( M = 
7.1, SD = 1.5) and did not differ significantly, indicating good liking of program content for both arms. Of 
participants, 97% ( n = 60) completed the 6 -week (end -of-intervention) assessment, and 92% ( n = 57) 
completed t he final (week 12) follow -up assessment, with no differential attrition between conditions.  
 Changes in Alcohol Consumption and Consequences:  Compared to controls, participants in the 
TMAP condition reported significantly fewer heavy drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_10092] p ost-intervention ( MTMAP = 2.39, SD = 
2.35 vs. MCTRL = 4.07, SD = 4.29; Cohen’s d = 0.48) and 12 -week follow -up (MTMAP = 2.06, SD = 2.10 vs. MCTRL 
= 4.66, SD = 5.30; Cohen’s d = 0.64). Participants also consumed  less alcohol (drinks /week) at 12-week s in 
the TMAP ( M = 9.77, SD = 7.91) vs. control group ( M = 10.83, SD = 8.42; Cohen’s d = 0.13), and had fewer 
alcohol -related problems than controls at post -intervention ( MTMAP = 3.29, SD = 3.98 vs. MCTRL = 4.81, SD = 
4.83; Cohen’s d = 0.34) and 12 -week follow -up: (MTMAP = 4.03, SD = 5.23 vs. MCTRL = 5.21, SD = 5.85; Cohen’s 
d = 0.21). While many of these changes are not statistically significant, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_594105] . Its primary aims were to assess feasi bility, acceptability and to obtain estimates of effect size . It is 
important to note that the magnitudes of the changes in the TMAP effect sizes are consistent with those 
reported in meta -analyses of alcohol interventions among traditional college student s.32,76 Further, the 
frequency of heavy drinking was significantly reduced among participants in the TMAP condition (vs. 
control: d = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.13, 1. 16). These findings are highly encouraging and indicate the need for 
a larger, rigorous  trial to determine the robustness of this effect.  
 Changes in Targeted Factors : The TMAP group showed significant increases in self-efficacy  in their 
ability to limit drinking ( M = 58.4, SD = 25.6) at baseline to ( M=71.8, SD=24.4) at post -intervention ( p=0.002). 
This increase was sustained through week 12. No changes in self -efficacy were observed in CTL participants. 
Use of protective strategies  increased for TMAP participants from baseline ( M=1.6, SD=0.7) to ( M=1.9, 
SD=0.8) at post-intervention ( p=0.05; Cohen’s d=0.39), there was also a decrease  in number of strategies 
used by [CONTACT_594141] 12 ( p=0.05). Finally, there was a significant increase from baseline to post -
intervention in TMAP participants’ motivation  to reduce drinking ( p=0.049).16  
4.2.e. Summary : These resu lts demonstrate that the proposed program is feasible and highly acceptable, 
as indicated by [CONTACT_594142]. The program message content was designed with and 
by [CONTACT_594143][INVESTIGATOR_2268]. Between -group co mparisons on heavy drinking and 
alcohol -related negative consequences approached significance or were significant with medium effect sizes. 
We also found effects of small -to-medium magnitude for increases in motivation to change, self -efficacy, and 
use of protective strategies - all mechanisms targeted by [CONTACT_594144].  The initial program therefore, shows clear indications of success at modifying those behaviors and 
cognitions central to behavior change, and show ed improved behavior change as well, even in this small trial.  
Some features requested by [CONTACT_594145], cannot be done by [CONTACT_594146] a phone -resident app.   
4.3. Approach for Phase I:  In Phase I , we will design the initial app for an Android platform based on 
successful features used and identified by [CONTACT_590901][INVESTIGATOR_4251].  This app will be tested with ~40 users , 
using  two iterative pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] s of 20 users eac h. Participants will complete brief surveys at recruitment and will 
complete quantitative surveys and an interview at the end of the 30-day testing phase . They will be 
compensated $25 for completing the baseline survey and $[ADDRESS_783802] staff.  
4.3.a. Population and setting : We will recruit students from two local community colleges (Bristol 
Community College [BCC] and the Community College of RI [CCRI]) which together have 10 campuses or 
satellite locations in Southern New England and enroll approximat ely 11,000 students annually.  These are the 
same settings from which participants will be recruited for Phase II, (see sections 4.4 .a-b below).  
4.3.b. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria :  
 
(1) age 18 -29; (2) current CCS; (3) report > two heavy (epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]) drinki ng (HE Ds) in the past two weeks 
(This pattern is called Frequent Binge Drinking112 and should net a group of regular heavy drinkers); (an HE D 
is defined as 5 [4] or more drinks in one sitting for men [women]);113-115 (4) has a smartphone and uses apps  
and text messaging ; and (5) speaks and reads English comfortably.  
 
Due to safety concerns, we will exclude participant s who (1) receive a score > 14 on the Alcohol 
Dependence Scale (indicating psychological to physical dependence),116,117 or (2) report prior or current 
alcohol treatment (these individuals will be provided information about local treatment options) . 
4.3.c. Recruitment Procedures : Participants will be recruited through flyers, classroom presentations, 
and emails to students at CCRI and BCC. Ads will provide a brief description of the study, a study website and 
a contact [CONTACT_31308], allowing individuals to access information about the study by [CONTACT_594147]. 
These recruitment and enrollment procedures have been used succ essfully in our previous studies.16,[ADDRESS_783803] prior respondents, and send the eligibility information only to valid email addresses (e.g., 
ccri.edu or bcc.edu) that have not previously been used. These procedures ensure tha t respondents will not be 
able to complete the screener more than once. Email addresses will be stored in a separate data table from 
screening responses (linked by a unique ID), allowing us to maintain confidentiality.  
4.3.d. Consent and Baseline Assessmen t: Ineligible individuals will be provided with a list of local and 
online resources for alcohol education and treatment. Eligible students will be sent an email containing an 
authenticated link to the baseline survey, which will include study information and the IRB -approved consent 
form for electronic signature. As part of the consenting process, individuals will answer true/false questions to 
ensure they understand the fundamentals of enrolling in the study, including the study purpose and 
procedures, co nfidentiality, and freedom to withdraw. On all correspondence, we will provide a study phone 
number so participants can call study staff with any questions. Consented participants will proceed to the 
baseline survey. Upon completion of the survey they will  be emailed a link to the Live Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594106].  Procedures for acquiring and using the app mirror those  to be used for Phase II.   
4.3.e. Iterative pi[INVESTIGATOR_109330] : We will enroll ~40 participants in two pi[INVESTIGATOR_594107] 20 participants each . 
Participants will use the CARES app to receive coaching in the form of CARES coach messages and 
reminders, reply to behavioral inquiries, track and log alcohol consumption, view graphics of their drinking 
history with normative feedback, seek transportat ion as needed  and use of all app features . 
4.3.f. Measures:  
Screening : The eligibility screener will assess age, CCS status (“Are you currently registered for classes 
at a community college?”), recent heavy drinking (“How often in the past two weeks have you had 4  [5] or more  
drinks in one sitting?”),114,115 phone use (“Do you have a smartphone ?”), texting frequency (“How o ften do you 
text messaging ?”), and comfort reading English (“How comfortable are you reading English?”). Individuals with 
a score > 14 on the Alcohol Dependence Scale,116,117 and respondents who answer “Yes” to the question “Have 
you ever been treated for an alcohol problem?” will be excluded (s ee sectio n 4.3.b. ). 
Demographics : Participants will indicate their age and gender, race, ethnicity, education level, weight 
(for estimating BAC),118 marital status, parental status (presence and number of minor children, whether living 
with them), employment (none/part -time/full -time; number of hours/week), and ho usehold income.  
Alcohol Use:  Participants will be provided with  a definition of a standard alcohol drink (i.e., 12-ounce 
beer or wine cooler, a 5 -ounce glass of wine, one mixed drink, or 1 shot 1.5 ounces of liquor ) for all 
assessments . The Timeline Follow -back (TLFB)108,109,119 is a well -validated, cale ndar-assisted measure that 
collects participants’ retrospective account of drinking behavior.120,[ADDRESS_783804]  3 months will be constructed from the TLFB . The Brief Young Adult Alcohol 
Consequences Questionnaire (BY[CONTACT_172378])[ADDRESS_783805] 3 months; items  are summed for a total score. Secondary outcomes:  We will use the TLFB to 
calculate number of drinking days, number of drinks per week, and estimated blood alcohol concentration 
(eBAC ).118  During the 12 -week intervention, we will also u se “push” TxM to deliver weekly assessments of 
drinking to all study participants regardless of randomization. These messages are used to collect single -item 
weekly assessments  of HD epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (e.g., “Did you drink 4 [5] drinks in a day over the past week? Please text 
back ‘YES’ or ‘NO’”), and maximum alcohol use (“What is the highest number of alcohol drinks you had in a 
day in the past week?”) . We had a 94% response rate to this type of assessment in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  
User Satisfaction:  At week [ADDRESS_783806] liked or seen as helpful and those which 
may need remediation. Overall program evaluation will be quantitatively  assessed with user ratings of the 
grade (A -F) they would give the program and whether they would recommend their college offer this program 
to students (1 -10 scale from “would not recommend” to “would strongly recommend”).     
User Engagement : We will adapt  the Web Analytics Demystified measure of user engagement to assess 
participant’s engagement with  CARES. User engagement is a function of the (a) click depth (number of pages 
viewed), (b) duration of use (length of time using app), (c) Duration of use/ time between uses , (d) loyalty (rate 
of return to the app), (e) interaction (number of notifications  viewed), (f) brand (awareness of brand/logo), and 
(g) feedback (subjective measure of satisfaction with app [see above]). An overall engagement index will be 
used as a predictor of alcohol use (controlling for baseline alcohol use) at follow -up.123            
4.3.g.  Qualitative Interviews and analysis:  An in-depth qualitative interview will be conducted with each 
participant after their 30 days of app use. We will use a detailed interview agenda to ensure that the same 
questions are asked of each participant.  Interviews will cover participant reaction to th e program, including 
responses to the  alcohol use messages  (e.g. did they read them all, why or why not) , replying to the messages 
and behavioral inquiries (willingness to reply, timing and accuracy of replies) and use of each of the app 
functions  (e.g., alcohol consumption logging ).  We will ask participants to discuss messages and functions that 
they felt were particularly influential to them and why.  We want to know: did the platform work well, what bugs 
were encountered, and was the content appropriate and well timed?  We also will ask how and why (or why 
not) the app experience influenced their drinking  behavior, including planning for social occasions. Qualitative 
work will also inform future commercialization of CARES, th us will ask if they would be willing to use this app 
as part of a college  sponsored program. Detailed experience descriptions, in par ticipants’ own words, also 
inform marketing messages for commercialization.    
Qualitative interviews will be audio recorded. A detailed audio review and interview summary will be 
written for each interview by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Rosen and reviewed by [CONTACT_594148]. 
Qualitative interviews will be analyzed using a framework matrix analysis. This qualitative data reduction 
technique is used to review summarize and classify data; it is particularly appropriate for practice -oriented 
findin gs and is often used in health -related research.  NVivo 11 qualitative data analysis software includes a 
framework matrix tool; it will be used to manage data and facilitate this analysis in which participant comments 
about key content are aggregated and en tered into the software for easy review.  A written qualitative data 
report, summarizing the findings or each round of qualitative interviews will be used to represent the 
perspective of the users during the hackathon meeting/data review.  
4.3.h. Finalizing  Phase I development : “Hackathon” data review and programming : After the qualitative 
interviews, data from all participants will be used to guide refinements of CARES. A “hackathon” team 
comprising the Live Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594108], (Deutsch, Foster) programming team (Flanagan), behavioral 
science  and content  leadership (Bock , Rosen , Traficante ) and project staff will meet for a 3-day conference to 
identify improvements in the CARES app and its intervention content.  Model ed on the hackathons common in 
the health care technology development arena, we intend to use quantitative data on participant use habits, 
qualitative data on participant use experiences and preferences, feedback from monitoring staff and 
programming team along with best 
practices in behavioral medicine to 
optimize interactivity, usability and 
functionality of CARES.  The team 
will meet to review available data 
and determine what changes need 
to be made to the app.  For 
example, if we learn that safety in 
dangerous situations is a concern, 
we will add features the easily 
connect users to emergency 
services (e.g., ambulance, 911, 
etc).  
Advisory Board : [CONTACT_594178] 
(Consultant) is an Associate 
Professor at CCRI and was a 
consultant on the pi[INVESTIGATOR_799]. She 

will work with the PIs and colleagues at CCRI and BCC to assemble an Advisory Board consisting of at 
least [ADDRESS_783807] will meet with investigators twice annually throughout Phase I and Phase II. 
Participant (student) data will not be sha red with the Board.  
4.3.i. Milestones for Phase I:  The milestones achieved at the end of Phase I will be:  
1. Successful development of wireframes design of the CARES app and complete programming in Android.  
2. Recruitment of > 40 participants and completion of 2 rounds of iterative pi[INVESTIGATOR_594109] 
(N=20 each round of testing).   
3. Complete qualitat ive interviews with participants about the app interface, use patterns, responses to 
content & features.  
4. Demonstrating Feasibility by [CONTACT_30224] [ADDRESS_783808] 
80% through final follow up assessment.  
5. Demonstrating Acceptability by [CONTACT_594149] 6 on program recommendations and a 
grade of C or better (these scores indicating above the middle ranking and allow for us to make any 
improvements recommended by [CONTACT_594150] .)   
6. Produce summaries of interview findings and quantitative data on app usage guides iterative design and 
programming improvements.   
7. Final programming of the app  (with any needed revisions as determined by [CONTACT_28024] -feedba ck from phase -
I) in both iOS and Android operating system languages.  
4.4. Approach for Phase II:  Following successful completion of Phase I, we will conduct a rigorous 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of the CARES product using a [ADDRESS_783809] of 12 
weeks use of the app that includes a push of six text messages per week  aimed at reducing hazardous alcohol 
use. Participants randomized to the control condition will receive online access to CheckYourDrinking.net, a 
free online alcohol intervention (s ection 4.4 .c below). Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 3 and 6 
month follow up s. (See section 4.4.g for design considerations ).  
4.4.a. Population and Setting : This study will be conducted with students from two community college 
systems: Bristol Community College (BCC), which has four campuses across southern MA, and the 
Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI), which has six locations across RI. Approximately 11,000 students 
are enrolled annually across both systems (56% women). About 80% of students (8,800) are ages 18 -29 and 
of these , 48% are ages 18 -20, with no differences between systems. We will enroll participants ages 18 -29 to 
be representative of the bulk of CCS population. Restricting the upper age to 2 9 will exclude older students 
who may respond differently to an app -delivere d program than younger adults. The ethnic and racial 
distribution is 12% Black, 3% Asian, 1% Native American, 1% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 75% Wh ite 
and 8% more than one race; 20 % are Hispanic. Both colleges maintain a small student services office , but 
health services are not available on CCRI or BCC campuses which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_594110] U.S.[ADDRESS_783810]. Schertz at 
CCRI expressed enthusiasm about offering the CARES inte rvention at their campuses (see letters of support).  
4.4.b. Eligibility and Recruitment:  
Recruitment Procedures : Note that inclusion and exclusion criteria  for the Phase II RCT will be the 
same as those used in Phase I (see section 4.3 above). For the Ph ase II RCT, we will enroll 250 participants  
who will be randomized to each arm (we anticipate at >80% retention resulting in N = 200 at the 6 -month 
follow -up). To achieve this goal we will enroll ~83 participants each semester (there are 3 semesters per year). 
With an eligibility rate from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594111] a guide, we expect 60% of screened students to be eligible, so we 
will screen approximately [ADDRESS_783811] period . 
Over 8,800 students age 18 -29 enroll in the local CCS system every year (BCC and CCRI), thus we will need 
to screen less than 5%  of the enrolled students in e ach year. Our recruitment strategy includes multiple 
methods to reach students, with reasonable incentives for participating, and although our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594112], we had no difficulty reaching our enrollment goals . We will use benchmarks to ensure that we achieve 
our targeted enrollment and ensure adequate representation of women and ethnic/racial minorities. Given the 
number of  available  students, our recruitment strategies, and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_594113], we are confident we will be able to enroll sufficient numbers of eligible students.  
Consent, Baseline Assessment, and Condition Assignmen t: Ineligible individuals will be provided 
with a list of local and online resources for alcohol education and treatmen t. Students who are eligible will be 
sent an email containing an authenticated link to the baseline survey, which will include study information and 
the IRB -approved consent form for electronic signature. As part of the consenting process, individuals will  
answer true/false questions to ensure they understand the fundamentals of enrolling in the study, including the 
study purpose and procedures, confidentiality, and freedom to withdraw. On all correspondence, we will 
provide a study phone number so particip ants can call study staff with any questions.  
Consented participants will proceed to the baseline survey. After completing the baseline survey, the 
online system will randomly assign them to an intervention condition using stratification by [CONTACT_654] (under/ove r 21), 
gender, and Audit -C scores (scores of >4 for men or >3 for women are considered hazardous drinking ). 
Participants will immediately be informed of their condition and will be provided relevant information by [CONTACT_6968]. 
This email also will contain summar y information about the study, the consent form, the schedule of upcoming 
assessments, and compensation information. All randomized participants will be followed regardless of 
intervention completion. Our participant tracking system will allow us to track completion of all components, 
including consent, the baseline survey, and the assigned intervention. Eligible participants who do not 
complete enrollment or who enroll but do not complete the baseline survey will be contact[CONTACT_3012].  
4.4.c. Conditions:  
CARES : Participants randomized to CARES will be texted or emailed a link to their appropriate App Store to 
download the Live Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594114]. Live Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594115] a message containing a code that the participant must 
enter into the Live Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594114]  (similar to verification codes used by [CONTACT_594151]) to gain access to the 
CARES program. Participants will set up a n online profile and receive CARES app coaching messages for 12 
weeks. The messages developed in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (section 4.2.) focus on alcohol education, caring messages, 
and strategies for risk reduction and are designed to increase self-efficacy  and motivation  to control/reduce 
drinking and  promote the use 
of protective behavioral 
strategies  and goal-setting . 
Some messages are targeted 
to the individual’s life 
circumstances (e.g., having 
children at home, multiple 
jobs), or demographics (e.g., 
gender) , while others depend 
upon user inputting data  about 
their current drinking in order 
to receive personalized 
normative feedback . The 
language of many messages 
was composed by [CONTACT_594152]. 
Table [ADDRESS_783812] communication  
allowing some user-driven  content . For example, messages 
sent to users (bi-weekly) through the text message portion of 
the program ask for users to answer questions regarding 
their self -perception of their drinking habits. Based on a 
users’ input, specific messages correcting any 
misperceptions and providing normative information about 
drinking are provided (personalized normative feedbac k).  
Users can  also drive content by [CONTACT_594153] (e.g., 
texting “CAB”  icon   will return lists with phone numbers 
of local cab companies and Uber resources for rides that can 
be accessed by [CONTACT_53737][INVESTIGATOR_594116] ). Following the advice 
of focus groups in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] , messages are delivered 
through  the app’s personal coach  twice -daily Thursday  
through Sunday. This schedule received high satisfaction 
ratings by [CONTACT_594154][INVESTIGATOR_2268]. H owever , anytime during the 12 -
week program individual participants can access the study 
website to program in hours during which they do not wish to 
receive messages; CARES will adjust the delivery time.  
Participants will receive a  reminder message  a few m inutes after being sent each  CARES Coach message; t he 
reminder message prompts participants to reply to the message with a rating of liking on a scale from 1 = not 
at all, to 10 = liked it a lot.  While we can verify through the app’s back -end (administrative functions that reside  
at Live Inspi[INVESTIGATOR_594117]) whether the participant opened (i.e. read) the message, having the participant provide 
message ratings increases their engagement with the CARES app and provides us with ongoing feedback 
about perceived message quality. Our program messages received high ratings for liking in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_594118] s highly acceptable (section 4.2 ).  
Active Control : Those randomized to the control arm will be give n access to an online alcohol education 
intervention; Check Your Drinking ( CYD : www.CheckYourDrinking.net ). CYD provides normative feedback on 
the user’s drinking habits relative to his/her peers. Alcohol in terventions that provide normative feedback are 
rated by [CONTACT_594129], and with few administrative or 
structural barriers to  implementation thus making it suitable for community colleges.[ADDRESS_783813] of CARES and for futur e marketing efforts, we will 
need to establish that CARES outperforms a program that college administrators could obtain for free .48 
4.4.d. Assessment Procedures:  The assessment schedule is identical for both conditions. At baseline, 
we will collect contact [CONTACT_594155], home address, and phone numbers. 
We will request  contact [CONTACT_594156]. Staff will update contact [CONTACT_43411]. Our tracking system will 
automatically establish each participant’s schedule of assessments, reminders, and compensation payments. 
Participants will complete all follow -up assessments online.  Participants will  be sent an email containing a 
unique link to the online survey when assessments are due . Reminder emails, text messages and telephone 
calls will be used to reach non -respondents. To ensure high retention we will compensate participants $25 at 
baseline, and $[ADDRESS_783814]. Bock’s (Co -PI) most recent trials have had follow up 
completion rates of  97% (R21AT008830) and 84% at 12 months ( R01AT006948 ), and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 
(R21AA021014) had a completion rate of 92%. Thus, we have a strong record of conducting longitudinal trials 
and using proven incentives that support our ability to achieve our target foll ow-up rates.  
4.4.e. Measures:  
Screening : The eligibility screener will assess age, CCS status (“Are you currently registered for 
classes at a community college?”), recent heavy drinking (“How often in the past two weeks have you had 4 [5] 
drinks in one sit ting?”),114,115 mobile phone use (“Do you have a smart phone?”), and comfort reading English 
(“How comfortable are you reading English?”). Individuals with a score > 14 on the Alcohol Dependence 
Scale,116,117 and respondents who answer “Yes” to the question “Have you ever been treated for an alcohol 
problem?” will be excluded (see section 4.3.  for inclusion/exclusion criteria).  
Demographics : Participants will indicate their age and gender, race, ethnicity, education level, weight 
(for estimating BAC),118 marital status, parental status (presence and number of minor children, whether living 
with them), em ployment (none/part -time/full -time; number of hour s/week), and household income.  
Alcohol Use (Aim 2.1) : The definition of a standard alcohol drink will be provided for all assessments 
as a 12 -ounce beer or wine cooler, a 5 -ounce glass of wine, one mixed d rink, or 1 shot (1.5 ounces) of liquor. 
The Timeline Follow -back (TLFB)108,109,119 a self -administered, well -validated, calendar -assisted measure that 
collects participants’ retrospective account of drinking behavior ,120,[ADDRESS_783815] 3 months . The Brief Young Adult Alcohol 
Consequences Questionnaire (BY[CONTACT_172378])[ADDRESS_783816] 3 months; items are summe d for a total score. Secondary outcomes:  We will use the TLFB to 
calculate the number of drinking days, number of drinks per week, and eBAC .118   The AUDIT -C125  will be used 
to assess hazardous drinking at screening and all follow up assessments.  
During the 12 -week intervention, we will also use “push” text messagin g to deliver weekly assessments 
of drinking to all study participants (both arms). These messages will be used to collect single -item weekly 
assessments  of HD epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (e.g., “Did you drink 4 drinks [5 drinks] in a day over the past week? Please text 
back ‘YES’ or ‘NO’”), and maximum alcohol use (“What is the highest number of alcohol drinks you had in a 
day over the past week?”) . We had a 94% response rate to this type of assessment in our pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268].  
Measures for Secondary effects of CARES : In addition to direct effects on alcohol use, other alcohol -
related factors  will be assessed to strengthen the need for the CARES program and for future marketing 
efforts . We will assess self -efficacy for resisting drinking using the Brief Situational Confidence Question naire  
(8 items).111,126 Motivation to reduce alcohol use will be assessed using the Readiness to Change 
Questionnaire  (12 items ; 5-point scale ranging from strongly disagree  to strongly agree ).127 Use of protective 
strategies will be measured with the 15 -item Protective Behavioral Strategies Survey,83,84 that has three 
subscales: Manner of Drinking, Limiting Drinking, and Harm Reduction that was developed for use a mong 
college students  (5-point scale ranging from never  to always ).78 Risk perception  will be assessed using the 
Alcohol Effects Questionnaire (AEQ), a 40 -item measure used to assess positive and negative alcohol -related 
expectancies ( 6-point scale ranging from strongly agree  to strongly disagree ).128 
Moderators (Aim 2.2) : Assessments of demographics (e.g., gender, age, race/ethnicity, parental 
status, employment) and heavy drinking are described abo ve and will be investigated as potential moderators 
of intervention efficacy.   
CARES -Specific Processes (Aim 2.3) : To investigate engagement with the CARES app we will ask 
CARES participants to rate their liking of each text message they receive using a 5 -point scale. The app will 
also calculate the time to respond (i.e., latency) to this rating request. We will also collect information about the 
sharing of texts through the app and through a survey at week 12 (“Did you share any of the CARES 
messages with your friends or family?”) . The content of the text messages will be coded according to the 
constructs identified in Table 2, and associations with liking, sharing, and weekly outcomes will be evaluated.  
We will also assess the same User Engagement  analytics  described above  (section 4.3.f ). Analyses are 
described in section 4.4 .h. 
4.4.f Methods Used to Achieve Scientific Rigor and Transparency:  We will use multiple methods to 
ensure an unbiased, rigorous clinical trial. Screening for potential participants will be conducted online with 
programming to ensure unbiased recruitment results. All data collected in online surveys and through the app 
are entered by [CONTACT_4317], avoiding any potential bias by [CONTACT_34450] y staff.  Structured interview guides will be used 
to ensure consistency in Phase I.  All Phase II study participants will have the same schedule of assessments 
to avoid bias due to unequal subject burden or priming effects from multiple assessments (e.g., i f delivered 
unequally between groups). Participants will be randomly assigned to condition via computer algorithms. 
Analyses will follow the plans developed a priori . Statistical power is conservatively estimated based on effect 
sizes from relevant literat ure and our pi[INVESTIGATOR_20732], and recruitment goals are set to allow for reasonable attrition. 
To ensure transparency, terms, our study will be  registered on ClinicalTrials.gov in advance of collecting data.   
4.4.g. Design Considerations:  
Alternative Designs Co nsidered : The issue of greatest importance in designing this study was to 
rigorously evaluate CARES compared to a control.  In this regard, we deemed it important that the comparison 
condition was ecologically valid (comparable to CARES in accessibility) and provided a reasonable real -world 
comparison.  In particular, for future commercialization efforts, it is important that we compare our CARES app 
to a program that any community or technical college would see as a viable alternative to pur chasing CARES.  
Thus, an online (or app delivered) format was important, and that it be free or low -cost.  That is, why would they 
purchase CARES if they could get an alternative, easily accessible (i.e., online or app) program free?  
We considered a comparison with a ‘no -intervention’ control (e.g., assessment only or a wait-list) but a 
no-intervention control seemed to be a bit of a ‘straw -man’ in that, given our pi[INVESTIGATOR_10299], CARES is likely to 
easily outperform nothing.  Also, we wante d a more real -world comparison, so we chose a control group using 
an alcohol program that is free, inexpensive and easily disseminated , and thus, something a community 
college might consider as an al ternative to purchasing CARES.  
We considered other web -based college alcohol interventions including AlcoholEdu (everfi.com), 
College Drinkers Check -up (CDCU; collegedrinkerscheckup.com), and e -Checkup -to-go (eChug). However, 
the CDCU has only one peer -reviewed publication describing two small randomized trials that support its 
efficacy.[ADDRESS_783817] $10,[ADDRESS_783818] not been 
tested in, CCS130,131 We also considered comparing to the ‘gold standard’ of a Brief Motivational Interview, a 
well-established intervention for college students.15,76,[ADDRESS_783819] the resources to support in -person 
counseling,13,14 and thus, could not be delivered to all CCS who drink.  Ecological validity and disseminability 
were high priorities in the development of CARES and in the consideration of the other conditions.  
4.4.h Statistics Procedures and Data Analyses:  [CONTACT_455814] -Sheldon will conduct all statistical analys es.  
Preliminary Analyses : Prior to conducting the main analyses, the distribution of all outcome variables 
will be examined . While count -based outcomes are expected to follow Poisson or negative binomial 
distributions, and the main analyses will be conducted using counts, we also can create dichotomous variables 
indicating whether participants engaged in any (vs no) HD and/or experienced any (vs no) problems. This will 
allow us to evaluate the extent to which there is clinically meaningful change in important public health 
outcomes.[ADDRESS_783820] - (e.g., gender) or time - (e.g., number of HD days) dependent covariate s, as appropriate . 
Aim 2.1. Main Analyses : All analyses will be conducted in SAS 9.4  We will use  mixed effects 
regression models to estimate the effects of CARES vs. CYD on  heavy (epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]) drinking  and alcohol -related 
problems at the 3 - and 6 -month assessments.  Mixed effects regression models can readily handle outcomes 
with normal distributions, but also (via use of generalized linear mixed model ing) dichotomous outcomes, count 
data (Poisson distribution), and over -dispersed (negative binomial models) or zero -inflated count data. Models 
will include a subject -specific intercept to estimate  and adjust for repeated measurement within participant over 
time. The m odels are conducted  using a likelihood -based approach and thus makes use of all available data 
without directly imputing missing outcomes to produce consistent estimate d of the regression p arameters. 
These a nalyses will control for the baseline value of the respective outcome measures  and the linear effect of 
time. We will also  examine interactions between intervention group and time to determine whether group 
differences in HD and problems differ across follow -ups. 
User Satisfaction  and evaluations of app features and overall program evaluation will be examined. 
Analysis of these data will indicate  which aspects of the overall program are most liked or seen as helpful and 
those which may nee d remediation. User Engagement  will be examined using the adapted Web Analytics 
Demystified measure to assess participant’s engagement with CARES (section 4.3.f). The overall engagement 
index will be used as a predictor of alcohol use (controlling for baseline alcohol use) at follow -up.123            
Aim 2.2. Moderation Effects : There has been limited  exploration of individual - and intervention -related 
factors that may moderate the efficacy of mHealth interventions. We will examine demographic factors (e.g., 
gender, age) as moderators of the interventi on. The extent to which demographics that tend to be different 
from traditional 4 -year college students, including race/ethnicity, marital and parental status, employment 
(full/part -time, hours worked/week), and level of heavy drinking at baseline (defined  as 5 [4] drinks on a single 
occasion for men [women] in the past 30 days) will also be examined as moderat ors of  the intervention. 
Moderation analyses will be conducted by [CONTACT_594157] ; the 
main effect of each potential moderator and the interactions between that moderator and interventi on condition 
will be assessed  (group × moderator × time) . 
Aim 2.3 Predictors of CARES outcomes (Exploratory Aim) : Among those receiving CARES, 
additional analyses will examine trends over time in the weekly (12 weeks) TxM responses to questions 
asking: (1) whether the participant had engaged HD that week (yes/no) and ( 2) the highest number of alcohol 
drinks in a day over the past week. Analyses will examine participant ratings of received texts, latency of 
response and self -reports of any sharing of texts (section 4. 4.e), to examine whether individual responses to 
each message or type of message (thematic content) are predictive of alcohol use. Analyses of these data will 
use mixed effects regression modeling approaches to evaluate the effect of time on each outcome, estimating 
a binomial model for the dichotomous o utcome of HD and a Poisson model for the count variable of maximum 
number of drinks , each of which uses a logit link function.  
Additional Analyses : Across all aims, we will extend the examination of intervention comparisons to 
additional alcohol outcomes (e.g., number of drinking days, number of drinks  per week). Data on alcohol use 
collected at the weekly level (any heavy drinking and maximum number of  drinks on a single day over the past 
week)  will be used in ancillary analyses to investigate trajectories  in heavy and peak drinking epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841].  
Analyses will use  mixed effects regression modeling approaches to evaluate the effect of time on each 
outcome, estimating a binomial model for the dichotomous outcome of HD and a Poisson model for the count 
variable of  peak drinks, each of which uses a logit link function.  
Missing Data : All analyses will be based on an intent -to-treat approach meaning that all participants 
will be included in t he analyses regardless of completeness of  data. Our proposed sample size allows for up to 
20% attrition at 6-month s (see Power Analysis) . We will test for systematic differences between participants 
who do and do not complete assessments to determine the nature of any potential bias due to attrition . Full-
information maximum likelihood (FIML) methods will be used in our analyses and we will supplement with 
multiple imputation (MI) as needed.134,135 To support missing -at-random assumptions required for unbiased 
interpretation of FIML and MI estimates in mixed effects regression models (e.g., Proc MIXED) we will run 
sensitivity analyses. If the results of the sensitivity analyses are similar with and without missing data 
substitution, confidence in the findings increases.  
Power Analysis : The proposed study is fully powered for our primary outcomes  of heavy (epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]) 
drinking  and alcohol -related problems . Results from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_799] (section 4.2)  indicated a d of 0.64 (95% CI 
= 0.13, 1.16) for heavy (epi[INVESTIGATOR_49564]) drinking and 0.21 (95% CI = -0.32, 0.75) favoring the intervention at the 12-
week assessment ([ADDRESS_783821] -intervention). When we assessed the pres ence (any) or absence (none) of 
alcohol -related problems at the 12 -week assessment, we found a d of 0.66 (95% CI = 0.14, 1.18) favoring the 
intervention. Findings from a related pi[INVESTIGATOR_594119] -based intervention that included 
text messages (AHC; AlcoholHelpCenter.net) compared to CYD indicated a d of 0.41 (95% CI = 0.11, 0.72) on 
the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test for Consumption (AUDIT -C)125 at the 6-month follow -up. (The 
AUDIT -C is a brief screening measure used to assess hazard ous drinking, including heavy drinking , and higher 
scores would indicate that the individual would likely be experiencing alcohol -related problems .) Therefore, we 
conservatively chose to power on a d of 0.[ADDRESS_783822] size is 
considered to be small to medium using C ohen’s criteria .[ADDRESS_783823] differences in at-risk drinking between our two active conditions, CARES and 
CYD, across a 6 -month follow -up. Given the aforementioned findings, and an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 
0.80, a power analysis was conducted using GPower 3.0.137 This analysis revealed that 1 90 participants (9 5 
per condition) would be required. Assuming an estimated attrition of 20% by [CONTACT_941] 6 -month follow -up, 
approximately 23 8 participants (11 9 per condition) are needed. Thus, our propo sed sample size of 250 (125 
participants per group) will be sufficient to detect even small between -group effects on the hypothesized 
outcomes  as well as controlling for covariates .  
 
 
5. PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS  
5.1. Risks to Human Subjects:  
5.1.a. Human Subjects Involvement and Characteristics:  Subjects will include male and female 
students (N=40 for Phase I and N=250 for Phase II) attending community college who are age [ADDRESS_783824] tw o weeks  (5 or more drinks for men, 4 or more for 
women). Subjects will be recruited through flyers, classroom presentations and campus internet 
advertisements targeted to  the student population at the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI) and 
Bristol Community College (BCC: see letters of support). Based on our prior experience recruiting participants 
for college drinking interventions and interview studies,16,17,[ADDRESS_783825]. 
Traficante (Consultant) who is a member of the faculty at CCRI. The advisory board will consist of at least 2 
persons in each ca tegory: Administrators, teachers, students and student services workers. These advisory 
board members will meet twice annually and review our program as content experts and are not considered 
research subjects.  
5.1.b. Population and Setting:  This study wil l be conducted with students at two college systems serving 
the region: Bristol Community College (BCC) located in Fall River, MA (with four locations across southeastern 
[LOCATION_005]), and the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI), which has six locat ions throughout RI. 
Student populations at both colleges are comparable, with approximately 11,000 students enrolled annually, 
about 35 -40% of whom are heavy drinkers.9,11 Approximately 80% of students are between ages 18 and 29 
(the age group of interest in this study), and of these, 48% are ages 18 -20. Thus, we ar e confident that there 
will be sufficient numbers of eligible students who will be available to enroll in the study. We were able to over -
recruit for our pi[INVESTIGATOR_4251] (section 4.2) using the same eligibility criteria as we will use for both Phase I and II o f 
the proposed STTR project.  
Approximately 56% of the students at BCC and CCRI are women. The current ethnic and racial 
distribution of the student population at CCRI and BCC are similar . Approximately 12% are Black/African 
American, 3% Asian, 1% Native A merican, 1% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 75% White and 8% 
more than one race. Approximately 20% of students are Hispanic.   However, nationally enrollment at 
community colleges and similar 2 -year institutions is approximately 50% ethnic and/or  racial minority. 
Therefore we will over -recruit to ensure that approximately 50% of our study participants will be ethnic and/or 
racial minorities. This is similar to the overall population in the greater Providence, RI area. Both colleges 
maintain a small student services office, but health services are not available on campus.  
5.1.c. Recruitment  Procedures : Participants will be recruited through flyers, classroom presentations and 
emails to students meeting age criteria at CCRI and BCC. Ads will provide a brief description of the study, a 
study website and a contact [CONTACT_31308], allowing individ uals to access information about the study by 
[CONTACT_594147]. Recruitment materials will emphasize that community college professors and administrators 
will not have access to information about participants. The website will provide a description of the  study and 
an option to continue to online screening questions. For those calling by [CONTACT_648], project research staff will 
briefly explain the study and answer any questions, then will direct interested callers to the website to complete 
the screening. At the  end of the screening survey, respondents will be asked to provide their community 
college email address. Our web -based survey system will be programmed to determine the eligibility of 
respondents, check the provided email address against prior respondents , and send the eligibility information 
only to valid email addresses (e.g., ccri.edu or bcc.edu) that have not previously been used. These procedures 
will ensure that respondents will not be able to complete the screener more than once. Email addresses wil l be 
stored in a separate data table from screening responses (linked by a unique ID), allowing us to maintain 
confidentiality.  
Those not eligible will see a message informing them that they are ineligible because they do not meet the 
criteria for the stud y (the specific criteria will not be provided to avoid individuals sharing this information with 
others). Ineligible individuals will also be provided with a list of local and online resources for alcohol education 
and treatment.  
Eligible individuals will be sent a link to their college email address. By [CONTACT_594158], the individuals will access the next set of web pages that explain the study in detail and present the IRB 
approved consent form for electronic signature. As part o f the consenting process individuals will answer a 
series of true/false questions to ensure they understand the fundamentals of enrolling in a research study (e.g., 
this is a research study, your information is confidential, you may withdraw at any time, e tc.). A phone number 
is also provided on the website so that individuals can call our study staff with any questions regarding the 
study or the consent.  
After providing an electronic signature [CONTACT_523221], participants will complete a contact [CONTACT_33655] 
(name, address, email, phone, locator contact). Contact [CONTACT_594159] a secure database separate 
from survey data to protect participant privacy and the confidentiality of their data. The participant will then 
have a 24 -hour window in which  to complete the baseline survey. When the survey is complete, the tracking 
system (used for assessment reminders and compensation payments) will be automatically updated. Eligible 
participants who do not complete enrollment or who enroll but do not comple te the baseline survey will be 
contact[CONTACT_5143].  
The online enrollment system will be programmed to follow the randomization scheme (stratified by [CONTACT_594160]/under 21, gender, and heavy drinking frequency) developed by [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Scott -Sheldon (Co -I). At the 
completion of the baseline survey participants will be informed about their assignment and given instructions. 
This information will also be sent via email.  Participants assigned to the control condition will be routed to 
www.checkyourdrinking.net and wil l be instructed to complete the Check Your Drinking assessment within [ADDRESS_783826] enter into the Live 
Inspi [INVESTIGATOR_594120] (similar to verification codes used by [CONTACT_594151]) to connect them to the study.  
CARES will p ush text messages twice daily on Thursday,  Friday, Saturday  and Sunday weekly for 12 
weeks, following the schedule recommended by [CONTACT_594161][INVESTIGATOR_799]. Message content focuses on alcohol education, motivation, building self -efficacy, caring 
messages, and strategies for risk reduction (section 4.4.c).   Information provided about CARES will i nclude key 
functions participants can use with the system as desired (e.g., clicking a button labeled “CAB” will return a list 
of contact [CONTACT_594162] a link to Uber). Following each content related text 
message sent by [CONTACT_594163], the system will send a follow up message asking the participant to rate the message 
they received on a scale of 1 -10 to indicate how well they liked that specific message.  
All participants regardless of randomization assignment will receive information abo ut the assessment 
schedule and associated compensation. Assessments will be conducted at baseline/enrollment, weekly 
through text messages, and at 3 - and 6 -month follow -up.  
Data from all surveys will be linked with the individual’s study ID. For those rec eiving CARES, use of the 
app will also be linked to the individual’s study ID. We used this online recruitment method very successfully in 
our previous studies. All direct human subjects involvement for this study and analysis of data will be 
performed at The Miriam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_93966].  
5.1.d. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  (1) age 18 -29; (2) current CCS; (3) report > two heavy drinking 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841] (HDEs) in the past two weeks (This pattern is called Frequent Binge Drinking112 and should net a 
group of regular heavy drinkers); (an HDE is defined as 5 [4] or more drinks in one sitting for men [women]);113-
115 (4) has a smartphone and uses apps and text messaging;  and (5) speaks and reads English comfortably.  
Due to safety concerns, we will exclude participants who (1) receive a score >14 on the Alco hol Dependence 
Scale (indicating substantial dependence),116,117 or (2) report prior or current alcohol treatment (these 
individuals will be provided information about local treatment options).   
5.2. Sources of Research and Clinical Material:  The research and clinical material for the proposed study 
will consist of que stionnaires collected as electronic survey instruments concerning the following areas: 
sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, household income, employment, parental status [that 
is, being the parent of minor children and whether those ch ildren live with the participant]); drinking habits and 
substance use history (current levels of drinking and/or substance use, any prior treatment history); a series of 
assessments relevant to examining posited mediators and moderators of intervention eff icacy (e.g., motivation, 
self-efficacy); and items concerning current drinking behaviors. Weekly text messages will be sent to all 
participants regardless of randomization assignment to assess current drinking (see section 4.4.e  for detailed 
descriptions o f the assessment instruments and schedule of assessments).  
5.3. Potential Risks:  The risks in this study are considered minimal. The primary risk to participants in all 
phases of this study is loss of confidentiality of information shared via the question naires or materials provided 
to researchers. Participants may experience some emotional discomfort responding to questions about their 
alcohol use and beliefs but we do not consider this potential risk to be either common or serious.  
5.4. Adequacy of Prote ction Against Risks:  
5.4.a. Recruitment and Informed Consent:  Subjects will include male and female community college 
students (N= 40 for Phase I and N=250 for Phase II) ages [ADDRESS_783827] two heavy drinking (H D) epi[INVESTIGATOR_594121] (in one sitting: 5 or more drinks for men, 4 or 
more for women), who have a smartphone and use TxM. We will advertise for study participants using campus 
media outlets, in -class presentations, flyers, email and Internet so urces we have used successfully in previous 
studies.16,17,[ADDRESS_783828] (will serve as the IRB of record for the overall study) to ensure that descrip tions of 
the study are clear and not misleading. All advertisements and presentations will include both the study phone 
number and website URL.  
Interested persons responding to these ads will access the study’s initial description on our website or 
speak with our research staff who are trained in the conduct of research and protections of human subjects’ 
confidentiality and privacy. The study staff will explain the nature and purpose of the study, answer any 
questions, and will send the caller the link to our website if they are interested in enrolling. Individuals 
accessing the website will view a brief description of the study requirements, and be asked to click through to 
the study screener, if interested. If eligible, they will read and sign the online consent form using an electronic 
signature [CONTACT_3265] [CONTACT_18943] a button indicating consent. Electronic consent for the screening questions is obtained 
prior to initiating the screener survey and prior to collecting baseline data. As part of the consenting process 
individuals will answer a series of true/false questions to ensure they understand the fundamentals of enrolling 
in a research study (e.g., this is a research study, your information is confidential, you may withdraw at any 
time, etc.). A phone number is a lso provided on the website so that individuals can call our study staff with any 
questions regarding the study or the consent.  
All screening data will be collected anonymously until eligibility is determined and informed consent is 
signed. Eligible indiv iduals who are interested in participating and who have provided signed consent will be 
asked to provide identifiers (e.g., name), contact [CONTACT_3031] (e.g., phone number, email), and locator contact 
[CONTACT_6227] (1 -2 additional individuals who can be contact[CONTACT_594164]). Participants 
will be emailed a copy of the consent document. Data collected at screening for individuals who are 
determined to be ineligible will be retained as anonymous data (no identifiers). This will be expla ined to 
participants at the start of the screening process.  
5.4.b. Risk Minimization:  All study staff will be trained and certified in handling human subject information 
to maintain privacy and confidentiality. No survey data will be labeled with the part icipant’s name [CONTACT_500185], but will instead be linked to a study ID number. Documents linking study ID numbers to 
identifying information (e.g., name, address) will be stored electronically in an encrypted password -protected 
file. All  paper -data (hard copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]) with identifying information will be stored in locked file drawers, separate from 
any coded data. Documents with identifying information and documents linking study ID numbers to identifying 
information will be destroyed at the en d of the study. All electronic data including data entered on through 
websites will be secured and encrypted. Subject information will be accessible only to research staff, who are 
pledged to confidentiality. Identifying information will not be reported.  
Any emotional distress will be minimized by [CONTACT_594165]. If any significant mental health prob lems are reported appropriate referrals will be arranged. 
Any participants who are screened ineligible due to a high alcohol dependence score will be referred to local 
community health centers.  
The Advisory Board will provide advice regarding implementati on of the trial, including reviewing the 
recruitment materials, website and surveys to ensure acceptability to the student audience. Although the 
Advisory Board will help with recruitment, participant (student) data will not be shared with them. This will be 
clarified during recruitment/advertising so that students are not hesitant to join the study. Moreover, a 
Certificate of Confidentiality will be obtained from the Office of Human Research Protections (OHRP) to ensure 
the security and privacy of particip ants.  
5.5. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to the Subjects and Others:  Participating in this study 
may heighten participant’s motivation to stop or reduce drinking, and participants may benefit by [CONTACT_594166]. Moreover, for those receiving the CARES or CYD 
programs, intervention content is designed to encourage reduced and responsible drinking and constitutes an 
active intervention that may result in reduced drinking among participants .  
5.6. Importance of Knowledge to be Gained:  The anticipated gains obtained through this study are 
substantial. Excessive alcohol use is the third -leading preventable cause of death in the U.S.[ADDRESS_783829] rates of hazardous alcohol use.2-5 In the U.S. community co lleges serve over 12 million 
students,6 comprising 45% of all college students nationwide.6-8 Community college students (CCS) show rates 
of heavy alcohol use similar to students at traditional four -year residential colleges,3,9-[ADDRESS_783830] on 
public health. Given how common and problematic student drinking problems are, we believe that the minimal 
risks described above are reasonable.  
Younger adults tend to under -utilize alcohol treatment services delivered through traditional methods (e.g., 
in-person clinics, telephone hotlines). Dissemination of an evidence -based program designed this population 
that can be delivered as a smartphone app has the potential to reach a nationwide audience of young adults 
who might not otherwise receive intervention.  
 
 
6. DATA AND SAFTEY MONITORING PLAN  
6.1. Participant Safety: Monitoring Plan for Adverse Events:  Partic ipation of subjects in the Phase I trial will 
consist of using the prototype CARES app for alcohol risk reduction for [ADDRESS_783831]. Rosen (Co -I). Participants will also complete surveys at program enrollmen t and 
at day 30.  For Phase II, participants will provide survey data at baseline and complete follow -up assessments 
at months 3 and 6.  For both Phase I and II we will be clear during the enrollment process and in other 
communications with participants th at we will not monitor the CARES text message feature in real time (i.e., 
that there is not an individual sending and responding to texts), as we do not want participants to assume that 
any potential expressions of distress will be seen immediately.  The C ARES system is designed as an alcohol 
educational tool and risk reduction tool, not as a medical monitoring device .  However, during the intervention 
period we will review our study participant’s CARES text messages daily for descriptions of dangerous alcohol -
related events or emotional distress. We will contact [CONTACT_594167]. Bock will determine whether a referral or additional action is necessary.  
In addition, at the start of the study (both Phase I  and Phase II), all participants will be given the study 
phone number to program into their cell phones. Participants will be instructed to call the phone number if they 
are experiencing problems related to the study or to alcohol -related issues. Staff wil l route these calls to [CONTACT_594179]. Contact [CONTACT_594168] 6. Finally, 
baseline and follow -up web -based survey responses will be viewed following each assessment.  
6.1.a. Adverse Events : Throughout the intervention and follow -up phases, [CONTACT_594177]  (MPI)  will report 
serious adverse events to The Miriam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594122] [ADDRESS_783832] staff, planned follow -up (if any), the intervention condition of 
the affected participant, whether the event appears to be related to the intervention, and whether t he event 
affects future participation (i.e., will the participant continue in the study). [CONTACT_594177] will provide a DSM report to 
the IRB and to the NIH Project Officer on an annual basis as part of the progress report. The DSM report will 
include a summary of all adverse events and serious adverse events, and all actions or changes that occurred 
as a result of these events.  
6.2. Data:  
6.2.a. Procedure for Collection of Data:  Data will be collected through audio recorded interviews that will 
be transcribed then recordings deleted (Phase I) and online forms (both Phases), and response ratings to text 
messages hosted on our secure website as dictated by [CONTACT_4690]. Only the participant’s study 
identification number will appear on data forms or transcri pts. Only the Principal Investigators, Co -Investigators 
and research staff will have access to the completed data forms and electronically stored data. All data are 
considered part of the subject's confidential record. Data collected from research particip ants will be stored in a 
secured, password protected computer file that is separate from other network systems. All data will remain 
confidential.  An electronic file will be maintained that associates the subject name [CONTACT_398668]'s study 
identificati on number. This file will be kept in a secured server that is accessible only by [CONTACT_68293], 
and kept separate from the actual study data.  
The CARES application is hosted in an Amazon Web Service (AWS) Data Center. AWS manages dozens 
of compliance programs in its infrastructure regarding security --and is built to support HIPAA. Our database 
layer is also hosted in the AWS infrastructure, and is secured by [CONTACT_594169]. Our web configuration 
interface is protected with an encrypted, user -generated username [CONTACT_594173], following standards 
of the industry.  Data stored on the phone is minimal and protected by [CONTACT_594170].  
6.2.b. Storage of Collected Data:  All electronic data are stored in password protected, secured computer 
systems. Any paper data will be stored in a locked file cabinet. Data will only be removed when coded, 
entered, or audited.  
6.2.c. Requirements for A ccessing Data:  The web -based data collection system will require a login 
identification and password in order to gain access to the data. Only the Principal Investigators and Co -
Investigators will be able to view the data in its raw state.  
6.2.d. Data Man agement and Analysis : Our research team has substantial experience in the design and 
implementation of data management procedures that provide accurate recording and storage of data, 
participant confidentiality, and timely analysis. Based on our past exper ience, we believe that our major data 
management and analysis needs for the proposed project can be met by [CONTACT_2329] a high -end PC equipped with 
the latest version of SAS for Windows and appropriate spreadsheet programs. All data files are automatically 
backed -up daily.  
6.2.e. Data Collection, Storage, and Quality Control:  All staff involved in data collection are trained and 
certified regarding their competence, and re -certified periodically throughout the study as we have done in 
similar trials. Digital audio  recorders are downloaded to our secure project files and removed from recorders 
immediately following the interviews.  Audio files will be deleted at the end of the study.  Written summaries of 
the audios, identified only by [CONTACT_333268], will be retain ed.  
Survey data will be collected and numerically coded using pre -tested electronic entry forms. Every effort 
will be made to ensure that missing data are kept to a minimum. Under supervision from [CONTACT_594177] (MPI), the 
Project Director  ([CONTACT_594180] ) will co nduct error checking procedures and preliminary analyses on all data to 
ensure their accuracy. The data collection program will be programmed to avoid accidental skippi[INVESTIGATOR_594123]. We believe that the quality control system to be used will ensure a complete and accurate 
database and maximize the likelihood that the intervention will be delivered correctly and efficiently. As we 
have done in prior studies, a manual of procedures will be developed during the initial study start -up period that 
explici tly describes the specific procedures related to recruitment, enrollment, data collection, intervention 
delivery, and quality assurance.  
6.2.f. Final Storage of Paper Data : Any paper data that may be collected in this study is minimal. 
However, all paper data will be housed at a facility that specializes in the storage of medical/ research 
information. The destruction date of these files will be at least 7 years from the termination of the study and will 
be authorized by [CONTACT_594171].  
6.2.g. Access to Cleaned Computer Data:  Once the study is complete, and all data have been collected, 
entered and passed the audit process, the data will be available to the Principal Investigators and their 
designates for analysis. Only th e Principal Investigators can give permission for the release of aggregated 
study data. No confidential information may be released without the express written consent of the study 
participants. Only copi[INVESTIGATOR_245181]. The origi nal data file will remain in its pristine 
state.  
6.3. Educational Training : [CONTACT_455814] -Sheldon (Co -Investigator) is a standing member of the The  Miriam 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39047] (which will be the IRB of Record for this project) and will ensure that all key personnel, 
consultants, and research staff receive appropriate human subjects training. The Miriam Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_594124]. To meet this training requirement, the Office of Research Administration offers an online 
training program through the Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CI TI; https://www.citiprogram.org/). The CITI 
program offers both an initial certification in Basic Human Subject Protection and a three year re -certification 
program (“refresher course”) as required by [CONTACT_137377]. Certification in the Health Insurance Portabi lity and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) is included in the basic human subjects program and requires annual re -
certification. All key personnel (Bock, Rosen , Scott -Sheldon, Deutsch, Foster, Flannagan), and Consultant 
Traficante are in compliance with t his policy and have up -to-date basic human subjects and HIPPA 
certifications. All investigators (and research staff) will be required to comply with this policy throughout the 
duration of the proposed education training program.

* Brief Description (using layman's terms) -  500 words or less:  
Electrophysiological methods, including event -related potential and functional connectivity approaches, 
have potential to clarify mechanisms of substance use treatment response and characterize individual differences therein. Veterans are disproportionatel y affected by [CONTACT_855887], of which cocaine 
use disorder (CUD) is particularly problematic due to high relapse rates and the absence of approved 
pharmacotherapy options. Behavioral interventions for CUD have therefore become an important focus 
and Contingency Management (CM) has emerged as the best -supported approach. CM involves 
reinforcing cocaine abstinence (established through objective testing) with reliable, short -term reward, 
such as chances to win prizes (i.e., Prize -Based CM or PBCM). Gi ven robust empi[INVESTIGATOR_205552], 
nationwide dissemination of PBCM has been supported by a VHA initiative since 2011. However, PBCM response rates are variable and long -term benefits are limited –  problems magnified by [CONTACT_855888] t o staffing and prizes. Measurement -based approaches to PBCM 
implementation have promise to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of CM programming but have not yet been investigated within the VA or considered in relation to promising neuromarkers. Impo rtantly, two versions of PBCM are already utilized at VA sites and may differentially benefit 
individuals with distinct neurocognitive profiles. Specifically, VA PBCM programs employ either abstract 
(voucher prize) or concrete (tangible prize) incentives, the latter of which may more effectively 
incentivize abstinence in Veterans with poor future -oriented thinking and planning ability. While 
selection between existing PBCM variants currently reflects practical considerations only, pretreatment 
neurocognitiv e functioning could meaningfully and realistically inform clinical decision -making in this 
regard. A sample of healthy controls will also be recruited for evaluation and serve as a comparison 
group to evaluate the differences between the treatment- seeking CUD sample and the healthy veteran 
sample.  
This project aims to advance measurement -based implementation of CM by [CONTACT_6310] a novel 
neurocognitive model with immediate implications for the use of abstract versus concrete PBCM incentives within the VA. Specifically, the future -minded decision -making ( FMDM) model posits that CM 
scaffolds future -oriented goal representation and self -control to support abstinence during in the 
moment use -related decision -making. For individuals with greater FMDM impairment, concrete, readily -
accessible incentives may be m ore effective than abstract voucher -based rewards (which require future -
oriented thinking and planning to acquire value). To test this model, neurocognitive substrates of FMDM will be examined as predictors of differential treatment response in voucher (Vo ucherPBCM) versus 
tangible prize (TangiblePBCM) versions of PBCM. Veterans with CUD will be allocated to VoucherPBCM  
or TangiblePBCM, and followed for a [ADDRESS_1192006] -treatment 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 electroencephalography (EEG) and cognitive -behavioral assessments will be used to measure FMDM -
related constructs (working memory, self- control, future -oriented decision -making, future reward 
representation) and related neuromarkers. These measures will be  investigated as predictors of 
differential treatment response in VoucherPBCM versus TangiblePBCM, as well as maintenance of gains 
during a post -treatment follow -up period. Change in FMDM -related neural and cognitive measures over 
the course of treatment will also be evaluated for evidence of neuroadaptation (e.g., changes in 
functional connectivity) and enhancement of FMDM function through PBCM. Taken together, results of 
the current research project will represent a first step toward precision implementat ion of CM within 
the VA.

The proposed work will utilize a prospective Phase III clinical trial design to identify patient -level 
predictors of  treatment outcome in TangiblePBCM versus VoucherPBCM (Specific Aim 1) and evaluate 
longitudinal  recovery of FMDM function in TangiblePBCM  and VoucherPBCM in order to clarify 
mechanisms of CM  treatment response (Specific Aim 2). This Class III study will employ stratified 
random assignment into one  of two subgroups: (1) 12 weeks of TangiblePBCM (n = 70)  or(2) 12 weeks of 
VoucherPBCM (n = 70),.  As CM is an adjunctive treatment option, it is noted that patients in both CM 
groups  will also experience TAU during the CM treatment interval (i.e., PBCM = PBCM + TAU). CM 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_855829] [ADDRESS_1192017] treatment. Importantly, the proposed design 
enables  evaluation of CM outcome predictors within a total sample of 140 CM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] –  both with  
respect to initial treatment response and longer term ([ADDRESS_1192018]- treatment outcomes Participants 
will receive a Baseline Assessment p rior to the initial 12 Week Treatment interval (TangiblePBCM  or 
VoucherPBCM), as well as a Follow -up Assessment at the conclusion of this period. Data from Baseline 
and Follow -up Assessments will enable longitudinal analysis of treatment -related change in EEG and 
cognitive -behavioral measures in TangiblePBCM  and VoucherPBCM. For all CM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], CM treatment 
data (i.e., attendance, urinalysis results, prize outcomes) will be monitored throughout the 12 Week 
treatment interval. Substance use during the treatment interval will additionally be monitored for all 
participants (i.e., CM) through weekly self- report measures and urine -based drug tests; outpatient 
treatment engagement will be quantified on the basis of chart review. For CM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], treatment 
engagement and self -reported substance use will additionally be followed on a monthly basis for [ADDRESS_1192019] -treatment. This design therefore provides for quantification of CM treatment response and 
long- term outcomes for both TangiblePBCM and VoucherPBCM su bgroups. Pre -treatment predictors of 
CM treatment response and long -term outcomes can therefore be evaluated for all CM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (n = 
140) by [CONTACT_855890] (TangiblePBCM versus VoucherPBCM) as an explanatory variable 
to parse condition -specific predictors.   
A sample of healthy controls , who either do not have a history of substance use treatment or ha ve been

IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5  
Veterans are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_855891] [1,2] and these conditions increase the 
likelihood of homelessness, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], incarceration, and premature death [3 -5]. Rising rates have 
further been reported amongst returning OEF/OIF /OND service members – with nearly one in five 
diagnosed with a drug use disorder [6]. Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is prevalent [7] and has been 
associated with poorer treatment outcomes in other high -priority mental health conditions affecting 
Veterans (e. g., opi[INVESTIGATOR_855830]) [8 -12], with which CUD frequently co -occurs. 
Unfortunately, the absence of approved pharmacotherapy options for CUD makes treatment 
engagement and relapse prevention particularly challenging. In order to improve CUD treatm ent 
options, in 2011 the VHA announced the national rollout of Contingency Management (CM) [13,14] –  an 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -supported behavioral intervention offering incentives (e.g., opportunities to win prizes) for 
negative urine drug screens to reinforce abstinence over a 12 -week period. However, while the evidence 
base for CM is strong, individual responses to CM are variable [15] and long -term outcomes remain poor 
[16]. Improving the effectiveness of VA CM programming would achieve sweepi[INVESTIGATOR_855831]. In 
particular, this knowledge will enable measurement -based adaptation of CM treatment parameters to 
better meet individual patient needs. This approach has alread y demonstrated promise [17] and is 
poised for rapid translation into clinical settings –  although previous work has focused on customizing 
the magnitude and probability of CM reinforcement and this may engender ethical and pragmatic barriers to implementat ion. Fortunately, a recently proposed future -minded decision -making (FMDM) 
account of CM [18,19] highlights additional reinforcement parameters (e.g., tangibility of future reward), 
as well as cognitive components of the intervention that may be more suita ble for measurement -based 
adaptation. According to the FMDM account, CM fosters representation of recovery -related goals in 
working memory (e.g., future abstinence- contingent reward) to potentiate inhibitory control during in 
the moment use -related decisio n-making. Critically, individuals with more profound FMDM deficits may 
require stronger scaffolding of future reward representation – for example, by [CONTACT_855892]. This may have immediate implications for CM i mplementation 
throughout the VA, wherein a prize -based, intermittent reinforcement version of CM (PBCM) is used 
with either voucher -based (VoucherPBCM) or tangible object -based (TangiblePBCM) incentives. The 
FMDM model additionally suggests that CM may act ively remediate the cognitive abilities underlying 
FMDM and strengthening this mechanism of action may further enhance and prolong benefits. Treatment- related neuroadaptation in the context of CM may therefore clarify new opportunities for 
customization an d augmentation of existing programming, but has not yet been well -characterized.  
The proposed work will test key predictions of the FMDM account of CM with implications for (1) improved treatment effectiveness and (2) targeted treatment delivery. Individuals with CUD (n=1 40) will 
be recruited upon engagement with outpatient substance use services and assigned to 12 weeks of 
TangiblePBCM (n=70)  or VoucherPBCM (n=70). Participants in all conditions will complete EEG and 
cognitive -behavioral assessments of core FMDM constructs (i.e., goal- informed cognitive control 
processes, executive working memory, epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681], and reward anticipation ) before and 
after the 12 week treatment interval. Self -report measures of other clinically -relevant indicators (e.g., 
addiction propensity and severity, motivation, self -efficacy) will also be evaluated and outcomes 
(treatment engagement, subjective and o bjective measures of substance use) will additionally be 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192021] -treatment in both CM 
groups. Aims and hypotheses are as follows:   
 
Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the utility of EEG and cognitive -behavioral measures of FMDM as predictors of 
differential treatment outcomes in TangiblePBCM versus VoucherPBCM.  
         Hypothesis 1a. FMDM -related measures will predict differential outcomes in TangiblePBCM relative 
to VoucherPBCM, with more FMDM -impaired individuals demonstrating improved treatment response 
in the former relative to the latter.  
         Hypothesis 1b. Inclusion of predictors from the FMDM account will significantly improve 
performance of predictive models forecasting short - and long- term outcomes in CM and inclusion of 
these predictors will be robust to model -based constraints fa voring variables with lower measurement 
costs.  
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate treatment -related change in EEG and cognitive -behavioral correlates of FMDM -
related cognitive functioning during CM.   
         Hypothesis 2a. Individuals  who reliably engage  in TangiblePBCM and VoucherPBCM will 
demonstrate greater treatment- related change in functional connectivity networks underlying goal-
informed cognitive control processes, as well as behavioral measures of working memory and future -
oriented decision -makin g, relative to individuals who demonstrate poor PBCM adherence . 
         Exploratory Sub -Aim. Longitudinal change in FMDM -related measures will be investigated in 
relation to patterns of abstinence during PBCM and will reflect distinct treatment response trajectories.  
4.0 * Provide a summary of the background of the study, and explain how this research will contribute 
to existing knowledge.  Describe previous studies that provides a basis to show that the proposed 
research can be carried out without undue risk to human subjects.   
Background  
Veterans are disproportionately affected by [CONTACT_855893] [1,2] – placing those who have 
served at an increased risk of homelessness, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], incarceration, and preventable death [3 -5].  
Taken together, costs associated with substance us e-related healthcare, loss of productivity, and 
criminality amount to an annual economic burden of 510 billion dollars in the U.S. [20] –  largely due to 
the chronic, relapsing timecourse of addiction. Indeed, over half of Veterans with substance use 
disord ers will have a use -related inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855832] [21]. Rising rates 
of substance use have further been noted amongst OEF/OIF/OND service members, with an estimated 
5-18% of OEF/OIF veterans meeting past year criteria for a drug use disorder [6,22]. Overall, the 
prevalence and chronicity of addictive disorders amongst Veterans translates into a high demand for 
substance use treatment within the VA, amounting to an estimated cost of 350 million dollars each year 
– 60% of whic h supports specialty outpatient care [23].  
While the increasing frequency of opi[INVESTIGATOR_855833] [24] has demanded national 
attention in recent years, cocaine addiction has been prevalent and problematic for decades, with a 
relapse rate higher than most illicit drugs [25,26]. Cocaine use disorder (CUD) additionally complicates 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 treatment of common psychiatric and substance use comorbidities in Veterans – predicting poorer 
outcomes in individuals with post -traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427], and 
traumatic brain injury [8 -12]. Unfortunately, while effecti ve treatment of CUD is a clear priority for VHA, 
the absence of FDA -approved pharmacotherapy options for cocaine users has made successful 
treatment engagement and relapse prevention particularly challenging. Without medications to support 
abstinence, prov iders have increasingly embraced specialized behavioral interventions for CUD; of 
which, Contingency Management (CM) has emerged as the frontline, empi[INVESTIGATOR_3675] -supported treatment 
option (when used as an adjunct to treatment -as-usual (TAU) outpatient care).  
In line with VA’s commitment to make ‘gold standard’ substance use treatment accessible to all 
Veterans, VHA announced an initiative supporting nationwide dissemination of CM in 2011 [13,14]. CM 
is a manualized behavioral intervention that offers incentive s (e.g., prize vouchers) for negative drug 
screens to reinforce abstinence over a time -limited treatment interval. CM has accumulated substantial 
empi[INVESTIGATOR_855834] 25 years and has been consistently associated with reduced use and 
improved tr eatment retention in individuals with CUD [16,27 -30], as well as other substance use 
disorders [16,29,31 -33]. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_855835], however, CM has been underutilized due to 
insufficient and/or unreliable funding. To address this, VA has specifically adopted a prize -based variant 
of CM [13,14] which utilizes a lower- cost reinforcement schedule with comparable effectiveness [34] to 
improve widespread access. Even so, long -term sustainability of CM within the VA remains uncertain 
and will be bolste red by [CONTACT_855894]. There are currently 
two primary considerations with respect to this goal: (1) modifying CM to enhance and sustain benefits 
and (2) targeting CM in a manner informed by [CONTACT_805363].  
While CM is currently the best- supported treatment for CUD, treatment response is variable [15] and 
long- term outcomes remain poor [16]. Indeed, a recent meta -analysis of prize -based CM studies 
identified a medium end -of-treatment effect size but no apprec iable benefit at [ADDRESS_1192022] -treatment 
[16]. Low response rates (~40%) have also been reported [35] and current evidence suggests over half of CM responders may achieve similar outcomes in TAU [15,17]. Of note, recent work in Veterans has failed to demon strate a significant effect of CM relative to TAU for treatment of stimulant use disorders 
[36], providing an imperative to improve the effectiveness of VA CM programming, specifically. 
Importantly, previous efforts to improve CM effectiveness have highlig hted opportunities to adapt CM 
treatment parameters in response to individual difference factors. Both increased magnitude [15] and 
probability [37] of contingent reward, for example, have been demonstrated to increase cocaine 
abstinence in CM and may be s pecifically indicated in patients with greater CUD severity [17]. Previous 
experimental manipulations of CM reflect the intervention’s theoretical foundation in operant 
conditioning – whereby [CONTACT_855895], timing, and magnitude of a reinforcer determine s its potential 
to drive behavior change. These early models of CM conceptualize substance use as a conditioned 
response to drug- related positive reinforcement (and associated cues) that can be systematically shaped 
by [CONTACT_658112]. Abstinen ce-contingent alternative reinforcement introduced by [CONTACT_855896] (1) increase the frequency of abstinence- consistent behaviors and (2) decrease use -
related behaviors due to opportunity costs (i.e., loss of alternative reinforcement) associated w ith drug-
taking. Basic tenets of this account are robustly supported within the scientific literature and have framed a preponderance of CM research to date. This alternative reinforcement model of CM may, 
however, overlook more subtle cognitive components  of the intervention that are both necessary to its 
effectiveness and relevant to optimization and personalization of CM treatment parameters. Consistent 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192023] when a concrete, non -drug option is made available [38]. Early CM intervention research in 
humans similarly utilized choice contexts wherein abstinence -contingent alternatives were accessible 
during use -related decision -making [39]. In practice, however, alternative rewards offered in CM are not 
immediately available; rather, they occur at some delay (e.g., hours to days after use -related decision -
making). Recent critiques have highlighted this aspect of CM, suggesting that the potency of alternative 
reinforcement in CM depends –  not only on the magnitude and probability of future reward –  but also 
on its robust mental representation at the time of d ecisions to use or abstain [18]. Beyond simple 
behavioral shapi[INVESTIGATOR_007], CM may therefore be understood to remediate the pathological imbalance between executive and impulsive decision systems underlying CUD by [CONTACT_855897] (recovery -
related) re ward over use [19]. Specifically, CM increases the proximity and concreteness of recovery -
related reward – factors known to enhance subjective valuation [40]. As these factors have been 
implicated in CM effectiveness [18], individual differences in future reward valuation provide a 
promising new opportunity for adaptive intervention delivery. Indeed, poorer outcomes were recently 
demonstrated in association with steeper devaluation of future reward in low magnitude but not high 
magnitude reinforcement versi ons of CM [41]. In sum, existing evidence suggests that alternative 
reinforcement mechanisms of CM are complimented by [CONTACT_855898]. Accordingly, a novel future -minded decision -making (FMDM) model o f CM 
was recently proposed [18,19] to advance scientific inquiry into, heretofore overlooked, cognitive 
components of this important intervention. The FMDM model views the overall structure of CM as a 
scaffold for recovery -oriented goal setting and goal- oriented decision -making. Specifically, by [CONTACT_855899], short -term reward to reinforce abstinence, CM provides frequent opportunities for mental 
representation of delayed reward and related contingencies. CM can therefore be understood to engage 
exec utive working memory processes related to goal maintenance, as well as epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681] –  
which involves mental simulation of future events. Through these processes, positive outcomes of 
abstinence can be robustly represented at the time of use- related decision -making and abstinence goals 
can be more readily accessed to capacitate proactive and reactive control of behavior.  
Preliminary Studies  
Multimodal Prognostic Assessment of Contingency Management Treatment Outcomes, [ADDRESS_1192024] preliminary data in support of the current research. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_855836]: (1) establish feasibility  of the proposed design with respect to participant 
recruitment and retention, (2) optimize parameters of behavioral paradigms for repeated -measures 
data collection, and (3) evaluate preliminary predictive utility of key FMDM -related measures (ERN, N2, 
change in delay discounting with inclusion of personally -meaningful future event tags, and working 
memory function). Data collection was initiated in May, 2017 and concluded in May, 2019; data analysis is ongoing.  
Implications/Relevance to Current Project:  Our preliminary data demonstrate feasibility of key assessments proposed for use in the current project (i.e., a Parametric Conflict flankers task, modified delay discounting task, and the Brown -Peterson/Auditory  Consonant Trigrams test of working memory), 
as well as successful recruitment and retention of CUD patients. There have been no significant adverse events related to study participation to date.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 5.0  * Describe the overall significance of the research in terms of the problem to be studied and 
potential findings, as well as its relevance to the care of veterans, the VAPHS, and the VHA:  
While previous efforts to enhance CM effectiveness have primarily focused on the magnitude and 
probability of reward, the FMDM model suggests additional promising avenues to enhance benefits and 
adapt treatment delivery to patient needs. For example, while  the lower cost, prize- based version of CM 
(PBCM) disseminated by [CONTACT_855900], PBCM has traditionally (and 
purposefully) utilized tangible reinforcement (i.e., desired material objects displayed within a prize 
cabinet) rather than monetary incentives to foster concrete representation of future reward. While this 
“tangible prize” version of CM (TangiblePBCM) has been most widely studied, it is currently used at only 
~20% of VA CM sites; rather, the majority of VA CM sites  (~80%) use Canteen vouchers to improve 
convenience and expand prize options. Although matched to traditional TangiblePBCM with respect to 
reward probability and magnitude, this “voucher prize” version of CM (VoucherPBCM) entails more 
abstract reward repre sentation that may fail to successfully incentivize abstinence in patients with 
limited future thinking capacity. Indeed, such patients may fail to convert voucher winnings into tangible prizes – a pattern of behavior that has previously been associated with poorer outcomes in voucher -
based programs [42]. Currently, VA sites offering TangiblePBCM primarily do so for practical reasons (e.g., a local VA canteen is not available for voucher redemption) but individual difference factors may also strategically inform selection of TangiblePBCM versus VoucherPBCM on a patient -by-patient or site -
to-site basis.  
Previous work has demonstrated that adapting CM reinforcement schedules based on patient features 
has potential to improve overall outcomes while keepi[INVESTIGATOR_855837] [17,41]. Specifically, 
providing higher magnitude reinforcement to patients with a p oorer prognosis in CM (e.g., patients who 
test positive for cocaine at treatment outset or exhibit steeper discounting of future reward) may 
improve the likelihood of successful treatment response in these individuals. Clinical translation of such 
findings  is, however, impeded by [CONTACT_855901], transparency, and 
patient preference when the probability and/or magnitude of reward differs between treatment 
options. Importantly, the FMDM model of CM, highlights new possibilities for personalized treatment adaptation – such as strategically varying the concreteness of future reward –  that may be more readily 
translatable in light of these ethical issues. Identifying patient -level predictors of differential treatment 
response i n TangiblePBCM versus VoucherPBCM, for example, could directly inform CM implementation 
and may, in fact, improve overall treatment response by [CONTACT_855902]. Chronic cocaine us ers present with varying degrees of 
impairment across FMDM -related cognitive domains including working memory, attentional control, 
and decision -making and such deficits have been associated with poor treatment adherence and 
retention in CUD patients [43,4 4]. It is plausible that individuals with more pronounced FMDM deficits 
differentially benefit from TangiblePBCM because concrete delayed reward better supports inhibition of immediate reward preferences [40]. Patients with superior FMDM ability, by [CONTACT_22242], may be better 
equipped to utilize abstract rewards offered in VoucherPBCM, which may further provide more 
advanced opportunities to plan and simulate future reward outcomes.  
Previous work has already highlighted the potential predictive utility of FMDM -related constructs –  
identifying improved CM outcomes in individuals with better working memory performance [45] and 
higher valuation of delayed reward [41]. However, no previou s work has studied such predictors in the 
context of FMDM -informed treatment variants with immediate translational potential within the VA. As 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 previously indicated, both VoucherPBCM and TangiblePBCM are already utilized in VA substance use 
clinics but selection of one variant over the other is currently driven by [CONTACT_855903]. 
The proposed work will determine if a measurement -based approach to implementation of 
VoucherPBCM versus TangiblePBCM is indicated and will specifically evaluate the potential of FMDM -
aligned neural and cognitive markers to guide clinical decision -making. Actionable consequences of the 
proposed work are sum marized in Table 1; additional alternative outcomes (e.g., evidence of differential 
treatment response in VoucherPBCM versus TangiblePBCM by [CONTACT_855904]) are not detailed but may 
also inform delivery of CM within the VA.  
Table 1. Relevance of potential empi[INVESTIGATOR_855838].  
 
Beyond adaptive implementation of existing CM variants, the FMDM model highlights novel pathways to 
achieve enhanced and sustained benefits of CM. Specifically, the FMDM model suggests CM actively 
remediates cognitive abilities underlying future -minded dec ision -making and, by [CONTACT_66250], the 
response rate and long- term outcomes of CM can be improved by [CONTACT_855905]. For example, while it is already recommended that patients describe desired prize items during 
each CM session [46], e xplicit practice with planning and mental simulation of future events has not yet 
been incorporated into CM protocols. Similarly, working memory training may also serve to complement 
and extend the benefits of CM [47] and has already been demonstrated to i mprove valuation of delayed 
rewards in stimulant users [48], consistent with stronger reward representation. Because FMDM readily generalizes to life contexts outside of treatment, greater emphasis on developi[INVESTIGATOR_855839]- term benefits of the 
intervention. However, predictions of the FMDM model regarding neurocognitive recovery during CM 
remain to be tested. Only one study to date has addressed CM -related changes in neural and cognitive 
processes – demonstrating recovery of anticipatory reward signaling in thalamus, precuneus, and 
midbrain in CUDs, consistent with improved delayed reward representation [49]. Establishing recovery 
of additional FMDM -related cognitive functions (e .g., executive working memory, epi[INVESTIGATOR_855840] (as indexed by 
[CONTACT_855906]) will demonstrate improved 
treatment outcomes in TangiblePBCM relative to 
VoucherPBCM.  TangiblePBCM is recommended 
for patients with greater FMDM 
impairment.  
Patients with less FMDM impairment (as indexed by 
[CONTACT_855906]) will demonstrate improved 
treatment outcomes in VoucherPBCM relative to 
TangiblePBCM.  VoucherPBCM is recommended 
for patients with less FMDM 
impairment.  
Alternative Outcomes  Treatment outcomes are comparable in TangiblePBCM and 
VoucherPBCM, regardless of level of FMDM impairment.  TangiblePBCM and 
VoucherPBCM are equally 
appropriate for all patients.  
Treatment outcomes are improved in TangiblePBCM 
relative to VoucherPBCM, regardless of level of FMDM 
impairment.  TangiblePBCM is recommended 
for all patients.  
Treatment outcomes are improved in VoucherPBCM relative 
to TangiblePBCM, regardless of level of FMDM impairment.   VoucherPBCM is recommended 
for all patients.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 thinking, and inhibitory control) through CM would thus clarify important neural mechanisms of action 
with strong potential for future development.  
In sum, the FMDM model of CM has important implications for personalized treatment delivery and may 
also reveal novel opportunities to enhance the short-  and long- term effectiveness of the intervention. 
However, key predictions of the model remain to be tested. The current CDA aims to address this 
knowledge gap by (1) evaluating individual differences in FMDM function as predictors of treatment 
response in CM variants utilizing concrete (TangiblePBCM) versus abstract (VoucherPBCM) future 
rewards and (2) exa mining longitudinal change in neural and cognitive processes underlying putative 
FMDM -based mechanisms of CM. Ultimately, this line of research aims to improve VA CM programming 
by [CONTACT_855907]. I n particular, 
understanding the role of FMDM in patient -level outcomes could immediately inform treatment 
recommendations within VA clinics (wherein both VoucherPBCM and TangiblePBCM are already used). The proposed research may additionally highlight new o pportunities to improve CM and aftercare 
programming through enhanced emphasis on FMDM skill development, maintenance, and generalization. Furthermore, by [CONTACT_855908] -related brain networks 
during CM such mechanisms may be mor e directly targeted through cognitive training, neurofeedback, 
or noninvasive brain stimulation in subsequent research.

Urine and/or oral saliva specimens will be collected/tested at baseline using commercially -available drug 
test kits and specimen containers. We will also collect and test urine and/or oral saliva at the time of the 
follow -up EEG assessment. In addition, ur ine specimens may also be collected and tested using 
commercially -available drug test kits at check -in appointments if the participant is not actively involved 
in CM and/or has missed recent CM visits. However, it is noted that collection of such supplemen tal 
urine specimens at check -in timepoints would not apply if (1) lab -based urinalysis for substance use has 
recently been completed for clinical or research purposes, (2) the participant refuses, or (3) the participant is not available or able to provide a specimen. All urine and oral saliva specimens collected 
for testing with commercially -available drug test kits in the context of these described research activities

Urine specimens will be collected (and may be witnessed, if necessary) by [CONTACT_855912] (CTAD) or research staff at the Research Office Building and tested for cocaine (and possibly other substances) by [CONTACT_855913][INVESTIGATOR_413918] a point -of-care diptest in order to 
provide the patient with immediate results for the purpose of determining CM prize draws.

the lab. However, it is noted that all urine collection/testing procedures to be conducted within the 
context of CM parallel those already used in routine clinical (i.e., non -research) administration of CM 
and other substance use treatment programming at VAPHS. It is additionally noted that participants may 
always decline to provide observed urines for lab -based processing and may alternately elect to provide 
urine specimens (not marked with direct identi fiers) for kit -based testing by [CONTACT_2710], as 
described above.   
2.0 * Please describe the tests or analyses to be performed on the study specimens:  
Both oral saliva and urine specimens will be tested with commercially -available test kits that 
automatically screen for specific substances of abuse and provide results within seconds to minutes. Commercially -available test kits generally involve exposure of specimens to a specially designed test 
card that visually changes to register the result (similar to a drug store pregnancy test). A subset of urine 
specimens (i.e., urines collected for treatment purposes and marked with direct identifiers) will 
additi onally be subject to confirmatory urinalysis at the VAPHS onsite laboratory by [CONTACT_273650]. 
Details of laboratory -based testing can be provided upon request.

* Sample Collection Method:  
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192027] of additional material taken during a clinical procedure  
 Samples will be obtained via a separate collection procedure done solely for the purposes of this 
research  
4.0  
* Please indicate how the specimens will be identified at the time they are forwarded for use in this 
research:  
DIRECT IDENTIFERS will be included with the specimens  
INDIRECT IDENTIFIERS (codes,links) will be noted on specimens  
If multiple selections have been made, please describe why:  
As described above, specimens collected in the context of routine CM care during the [ADDRESS_1192028] to these s pecimens, the "Samples to be obtained will be 
limited to amounts routinely collected during a clinical procedure," and will be collected in the context 
of the patient's routine clinical care.  
Specimens collected for the purpose of objectively verifying recent abstinence for research purposes will 
not be marked with direct identifiers and will be tested and immediately disposed of by [CONTACT_3647]. 
While these samples will also "be limited to amounts routinely collected during a clinical procedure" 
they will be collected solely for the purposes of research. We will therefore take additional steps to 
protect patient confidentiality with respect to these samples: (1) eliminating direct patient identifiers from the specimen collection procedure, (2) immediately disposing of samples following testing, and (3) 
utilizing only indirect identifiers (subject ID code) when recording test results.   
5.0 * Will the analysis to be done on the samples possibly result in any genetic information related to 
the subject's (or his/her relatives') health or susceptibility to a disease or condition currently or in the future?  
  Yes No 
If yes will patients have access to this information?  
  Yes No  
   
6.0   
* Will the analysis to be done on the samples involve whole genome sequencing?  
  Yes No 
 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 If Yes, for research compliant with the 2018 Requirements, if the research involves whole genome 
sequencing (sequencing of a human germline or somatic specimen with the intent to generate the 
genome or exome sequence of that specimen), there must be a statement indicating that the research 
will or might include whole genome sequencing in the consent.  
 
7.0  * Please list where processing of these specimens will occur:  
Collection/processing of specimens will occur in clinical areas of Buildings 29 and 30. Specifically, 
samples collected for research purposes in Building 30 will be collected/processed in the following 
locations: GA124, GA112, GA110 , and Building 30 Lobby [CONTACT_855914] . These locations include a patient 
restroom in the clinical trials center on the group floor of the Research Office Building, as well as two exam rooms available on the ground floor of the Research Office Building. Samples collected as part of 
clinical care through the Center for Treatment of Addictive Disorders (CTAD) will either be collected by 
[CONTACT_855915] [ADDRESS_1192029] to point -of-care testing in a designated clinical area/treatment room 
within Building [ADDRESS_1192030] identifiers and forwarded to the onsite laboratory facility for additional processing and confirmatory drug -alcohol urinalysis.  
Plan for Destruction/Disposal of Specimens. Urine and oral saliva specimens collected for research purposes (indirect identifiers only) will be disposed of by [CONTACT_855916]. 
Following use, oral saliva test kits will be disposed of in red, biomedical waste containers. Similarly, used 
urine dip tests and urine specimen containers will be disposed of in red, biomedical waster containers 
after any remaining urine has been poured into a toilet and flushed down the drain. Urine specime ns 
collected in the context of clinical care (direct identifiers) will be disposed of by [CONTACT_855917], using standard procedures approved by [CONTACT_855918].    
    
View: [ADDRESS_1192031] will be considered enrolled in the 
study.  
1.0   
* Research Procedures/Interventions:  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Informed Consent and Screening Visit. The initial study visit will involve review of the informed consent 
document and discussion of any participation -related concerns. During the informed consent process, 
participants will be informed of drug and alcohol testing conducted at the time of the Baseline 
Assessment and that a minimum of 72 hours of abstinence from cocaine and other illicit substances is 
required prior to participation in baseline testing. After written informed consent has been obtained, the pa rticipant will be enrolled in the study. A brief cognitive screening tool (the Saint Louis University 
Mental Status (SLUMS) or Mini Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)) will be administered to 
determine eligibility for participation in all subsequent stud y procedures. However, it is noted that we 
will routinely conduct cognitive screening via the Mini MoCA as part of our initial (typi[INVESTIGATOR_855844] -
based) eligibility assessment in order to reduce burden on participants who are deemed ineligible based 
on this criterion.  In this way, individuals who will not meet our full eligibility criteria will be more 
efficiently screened out with less time invested.  For this reason, cognitive screening will only occur at the Consent and Screening Visit if not already completed.  Evaluation of psychiatric and substance use 
history will follow for all individuals who pass cognitive screening.  Participants may also be asked to 
complete a Demographic Information form and Contact [CONTACT_855919]- report questionnaires, which they may choose to complete in the time 
between the Screening Visit and Baseline Assessment. It is further noted that this session may be 
remotely conducted to reduce burden/risks to participa nts.  In such cases, assessments will be 
completed via telephone of video call (using locally approved technologies) and, when necessary, forms 
will be transmitted via mail, email, or warm handoff (e.g., during a clinical interaction with one of the 
Vetera n's providers).  
Diagnostic Interviews and Neuropsychological Screening. The investigator or a trained research assistant 
will administer the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 7.0.2 (specifically, the version for studies including patients with psychotic  illnesses), Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS) or 
Mini Montreal Cognitive Assessment (Mini MoCA) exam, and Addiction Severity Index -Lite (ASI -Lite) to 
all study participants. The investigator has extensive experience administering the SCID -  a semi-
structured interview similar to the MINI -  in research and clinical contexts and has received training on 
this instrument under the direction of one of the authors (Michael First, MD). The investigator also has sufficient experience with the SLUMS and ASI from previous research and clinical training. The MINI will be used to identify comorbid psychiatric and substance use diagnoses, as well as CUD severity. The 
SLUMS or Mini MoCA will be administered to screen for moderate -to-severe cognitive impairment .  
Previously undiagnosed conditions identified through administration of the MINI or SLUMS/MoCA that 
may be relevant to the Veteran's ongoing care will be shared with the Veteran’s mental health 
treatment coordinator. The participant will be made aware of this policy during the informed consent 
process. Participants determined to be eligible following participation in diagnostic interview and 
neuropsychological screening procedures will be scheduled for a Baseline Assessment.  It is possible that 
the Infor med Consent and Screening Visit and the Baseline Testing Visit could occur on the same day if 
scheduling these visits for separate days would be problematic for the participant.  
▪ MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Psychotic Disorders Studies (Version 7.0.2): The MINI 
is a semi- structured clinical interview based on DSM -5 diagnostic criteria. Module J (Substance Use 
Disorders) will always be administered in full. A s creening tool will be used to identify symptoms 
relevant to other diagnostic categories and additional modules will be administered, as needed, to limit the total time burden. Veterans identified as having additional, immediate assessment or treatment 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 needs will be escorted to the VAPHS Behavioral Health walk -in clinic or Emergency Department (if 
determined to pose an imminent risk of harm to self or others). Diagnostic evaluation using the MINI will 
enable determination of CUD severity and effective ch aracterization of psychiatric and substance use 
comorbidities.  
▪ Addiction Severity Index -Lite (ASI -Lite): The ASI -Lite is a semi- structured interview used to quantify 
problem severity related to alcohol and drug use, as well as functioning in five domains impacted by [CONTACT_855891]:  medical status, legal status,  psychiatric status, family/social status, and 
employment/financial support. The ASI is commonly used to quantify overall severity of addictive 
disorders – a factor which must be considered when evaluating individual differences in substance use 
treatment  response.  
▪ Cognitive Screening via One of the Following Tools (if not conducted during initial eligibility 
assessment):  
                  ▪  Saint Louis University Mental Status (SLUMS): The SLUMS is a brief cognitive screening tool, 
used to identify impairment across eight domains: working memory, concentration, attention, orientation, semantic fluency, visuospatial ability, executive functio n, and short -term recall. A cutoff of 
20 is suggested to identify dementia and serious cognitive impairment; individuals scoring ≤20 will be excluded from further participation.  
                 ▪  Mini Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): The mini version of the MoCA is brief cognitive 
screening tool that can be used as an alternative to the SLUMS for remotely conducted (i.e., via telephone or video call- based) cognitive screening.  A cutoff of 10  is suggested to identify dementia and 
serious cognitive impairment; individuals scoring ≤10 will be excluded from further participation.  
 
Baseline Assessment. The Baseline Assessment session  for CM veterans and  healthy controls could 
include the following components:  
Substance Use Assessment:  Recent substance use will be evaluated through self -report and objective 
testing.  
▪ Breathalyzer and Oral Saliva Drug Testing: Participants will be required to pass breathalyzer (BAC = 
0.000%), as well as urine and/or oral saliva drug screens (negative for all common illicit substances, 
excluding marijuana) in order to participate in bas eline testing. Such testing is necessary to establish 
that participants are not acutely intoxicated at the time of EEG and cognitive- behavioral assessments, 
which may compromise the validity and reliability of these measures. We will offer oral saliva tes ting as 
an option because this method has an earlier and more proximal detection window than urine -based 
testing (sensitive to use immediately prior to testing and during the preceding 72 hours). Consequently, 
it will be possible to include CUD participant s with relatively short durations of cocaine abstinence prior 
to baseline testing. Participants will be informed of drug and alcohol testing procedures at the screening 
visit and asked to abstain from drug use for 72 hours prior to testing. While this requ irement will 
necessarily exclude individuals who are unable to abstain for 72 hours, such individuals would generally 
not be recommended for CM programming (VA CM implementation consultants suggest 3 -4 days of 
demonstrated abstinence prior to initiating a CM referral). Consequently, this requirement should not 
prevent us from achieving a representative sample of cocaine users for whom CM is indicated.  Due to 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192032] to schedule one or more optional pre -CM 
testing sessions with study personnel in preparation for the Baseline session.  
▪Timeline Follow -Back (TLFB) Procedure:  During the timeline follow -back, participants will be asked to 
describe drug and alcohol use during the past month, including type, frequency, and quantity. Typi[INVESTIGATOR_855845] -treatment drug and alcohol use may also be evaluated if a recent change in use has 
preceded the testing session (for example, patient completed residential treatment during the past 
month).  
EEG Procedure:  Participants will complete two computerized behavioral tasks while EEG is recorded from the surface of the scalp using a commercially -available EEG recording system.  A baseline (resting) 
acquisition may also precede task -related data acquisition, as is typi[INVESTIGATOR_855846].  
▪ Concrete -Abstract Incentive Delay Task:  In order to evaluate differences in alpha suppression during 
anticipation of concrete/tangible versus abstract/monetary reward, EEG will be recorded while participants perform a modified Monetary Incentive Delay task with voucher - and tangible -prize reward 
cues. Previous work has demonstrated that reward cues associated with more concrete or primary 
rewards result in greater alpha suppression during anticipation [50], as well greater recruitment of brain 
areas asso ciated with self -referential and prospective processing [51] when compared with monetary 
reward cues. A paradigm previously used to examine anticipatory brain responses to monetary versus food rewards [51] will be adapted for use with voucher and tangible prize rewards. Trials will begin with 
a cue indicating reward magnitude (i.e., no reward, low reward, high reward), followed by a delay and 
target stimulus (requiring a manual response). Another delay will precede presentation of feedback 
based on response  accuracy and reward magnitude. Consistent with previous work [51], reward 
feedback will consist of images depi[INVESTIGATOR_855847] (vouchers) or prize baskets with 
tangible items (e.g. snacks, clothing, household goods). Participants will be infor med that they will not 
receive total prize winnings but that a percentage of total winnings will be awarded following the task (a 
strategy the PI [INVESTIGATOR_855848]); the value of this prize bonus will generally be between $[ADDRESS_1192033] one or more prize cabinet prizes of matching value.  
▪ Parametric Conflict Flankers Task:  As previously described, FMDM requires robust goal representation 
to inform effective proactive and reactive modulation of cognitive control. In order to assess control -
related processes, a modified Eriksen Flankers paradigm will be used to measure transient theta 
frequency synchronization of brain signals recorded at ACC and lPFC electrode sites, as well as ERN and 
conflict N2 components of response - and stimulus -locked event- related potentials, respectively. In this 
modified version of the task, trial- to-trial response conflict will be parametrically manipulated through 
different levels of flanker- target incongruity (i.e., Congruent, Incongruent -Low, Incongruent -Medium, 
and Incongruent -High). The Parametric Conflict Flanker task has previously been validated in healthy 
controls [52] and in individuals with nicotine use disorder [53]. The deadline for response production will 
be adjusted on a subject -by-subject basis to ensure an appropriate number of erroneous responses  and 
to establish a similar level of task difficulty across participants and over time.  
Cognitive -Behavioral Testing: Additional FMDM constructs will be measured using cognitive tasks.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 ▪ Personalized Delay Discounting Task:  Participants will be interviewed about upcoming positive and 
neutral life events (e.g., birthdays, holidays, vacations), occurring at latencies ranging from one week to 
one year from the testing date. Events will be r ated with respect to personal relevance, valence, and 
arousal and a subset of events with similar ratings will be selected for use in a personalized version of 
the delay discounting task. Following previously described procedures [54], participants will c omplete a 
series of delay discounting trials with and without inclusion of event tags referencing personally -
meaningful future events from the interview. Blocked presentation of trials in each condition allows for 
characterization of standard delay discoun ting behavior (i.e., without event tags) as well as discounting 
in the context of epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681] (with event tags). The difference in delay discounting slopes 
estimated for each condition (i.e., ∆ ln(k)) will be used as a measure of future- minded  decision -making. 
Specifically, greater reduction in discounting slope with inclusion of event tags signifies greater 
engagement of epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681], thus increasing valuation of future reward. Upon completion of 
the task, participants will also be  asked to rate the vividness and frequency of spontaneously -evoked 
mental imagery associated with each event tag.  
▪ Modified Brown -Peterson/Auditory Consonant Trigrams Test:  A version of the Brown -
Peterson/Auditory Consonant Trigrams test will be used to assess executive working memory. In this test, participants will be required to maintain letter sequences in workin g memory while performing a 
distractor task (serial subtraction by [CONTACT_855920]). Participants will either be asked to immediately recall 
letters or recall them following a delay.  On delay trials, participants will be provided with a letter 
sequence and starti ng number and will count backwards by [CONTACT_14774], out loud, for the duration of the delay 
period; the letter sequence will then be recalled. This complex- span test is used to index maintenance 
and decay of working memory contents of direct relevance to the strength of goal maintenance. Of 
note, low scores on this task have previously been associated with increased externalizing 
psychopathology and discounting of future reward [55] but the paradigm has not yet been studied in CUDs receiving CM.  
Self-report Questionnaires:  Participants will also complete measures of craving (Drug Craving 
Questionnaire, Alcohol Craving Questionnaire) [56], sensation seeking (Sensation Seeking Scale) [57], avoidance and inflexibility in response to cocaine triggers  (Avoidance and Inflexibility Scale) [58], 
motivation for change (Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES)) [59], 
previous cocaine relapse experiences (Time to Relapse Questinnaire) [60], sensitivity to reward and 
punishment (Sen sitivity to Punishment/Sensitivity to Reward Questionnaire- 20 (SPSRQ -20)) [61], 
subjective experience of retrospective and prospective memory proficiency (Prospective- Retrospective 
Memory Questionnaire) [62], self efficacy (Drug Taking Confidence Questionn aire) [63], future 
mindednesss (Consideration of Future Consequences Scale) [64], nicotine dependence (Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence) [65], and adverse experiences  in childhood (Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire) [66]. These instrument s were chosen to measure clinically -relevant factors in substance 
use treatment (e.g., motivation, craving, and impulsivity), as well as factors previously associated with 
CM treatment outcomes specifically (avoidance -inflexibility) [58]. In order to asses s the motivational 
salience of potential CM incentives, participants will also be asked to complete a Prize Preference and 
Interest Survey (currently in development, awaiting information on product inventory from VA Canteen Services), wherein interest in/p reference for potential tangible and voucher prizes will be rated on a 
likert -type scale. For participants assigned to TangiblePBCM, this information may also be used to 
populate the prize cabinet with preferred items.   
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 For healthy participants, participation in activity/heartrate monitoring activities will be described in the 
primary study consent form and participants may engage in these activities without additionally 
providing consent under Substudy 2.  
Randomization. Following baseline testing,  patient  participants will be randomized into TangiblePBCM 
(n = 70)  and VoucherPBCM (n = 70) conditions. We will stratify on one or more of the following 
variables:  age, involvement in medication -assisted treatment for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2427] (yes/no), working 
memory score from modified Brown -Peterson test (< or ≥ Veteran -specif ic norm), and current diagnosis 
of bipolar or psychotic illness (yes/no).  A minimization approach may additionally be employed in order 
to allow for stratification on an expanded set of potentially -relevant clinical and demographic factors. 
Working memory  ability was identified as a potential focus of stratification because it is expected to 
relate to other FMDM constructs of interest and Veteran -specific norms are available for the modified 
Brown -Peterson test [67]. Participants will be informed of PBCM treatment assignment during 
scheduling of the initial CM treatment appointment.  Participants previously assigned to a TAU only 
condition will continue to be followed for check -in and follow -up procedures if agreeable to doing so.  
To maximize options for f uture data analysis, this may apply to  individuals previously assigned to TAU 
who elect to begin standard PBCM through CTAD rather than continuing in the TAU only treatment condition as part of the study.  
Treatment. All participants will receive treatment -as-usual during the [ADDRESS_1192034] two outpatient group and/or individual psychotherapy 
encounters through CTAD per week; participants w ill additionally continue pharmacotherapy for 
substance use and/or other mental health conditions, if applicable   For participants assigned to either 
Prize -based Contingency Management (PBCM) condition, PBCM will be used and implemented in 
accordance with the VA protocol for CM, as well as guidance on PBCM, more generally. PBCM involves one-on-one sessions with a provider, during which a urine specimen provided by [CONTACT_855921] a point -of-care dip -test. Results of point -of-care tes ting are then shared with the patient 
and negative results are reinforced with draws from a fish bowl containing [ADDRESS_1192035] small, large, or jumbo prizes (remaining slips deliver words of encouragement). Patients are reinforced wit h a single prize draw for their first negative specimen; an additional prize draw is added 
for each consecutive negative result (up to 8 prize draws per session). Abstinence -contingent prize 
draws are reset to one upon either a positive test result or miss ed appointment. The proposed work will 
systematically evaluate two variants of PBCM used within the VA (detailed below) which will be 
administered twice weekly during [ADDRESS_1192036] magnitude will be the same in both treatment conditions. Specifically, 41.8% of paper slips will 
award a small prize, 8% will award a large prize, and 0.2% will award a jumbo prize. During the active 
treatment period, CM treatment data (i.e., attendance, urinalysis res ults, prize outcomes) will be logged 
by [CONTACT_855922], and may also be followed through chart review.  Participants will additionally be 
asked to provide regular updates regarding any changes in their housing status or medications (including 
changes in d osing schedule and/or clinic privileges for patients in medication -assisted treatment) and 
participation in non -VA substance use treatment (e.g., 12 -step meetings in the community).   Under 
unusual circumstances in which a Veteran’s prolonged absence from in -person treatment is unavoidable 
(e.g., due to illness or travel) one or more CM sessions may be conducted via VVC using oral fluid testing (i.e., methods already reviewed and approved under Substudy 1).  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 ▪ TangiblePBCM: For participants assigned to TangiblePBCM, prize draws resulting in one or more small, 
large, or jumbo wins will result in access to a prize cabinet stocked with small (approximately $0.75 -
$1.25 in value), medium (approximately $3 -$5 in valu e), large (approximately $20 -25 in value), and 
jumbo (approximately $75 -$100in value) incentive items. Medium incentive items are included for 
selection in the event that a patient draws several small prize slips on the same day and are considered 
equival ent to 4 -5 small prizes. Selection of specific prize items will be informed by [CONTACT_855923]. The prize cabinet will be open during TangiblePBCM sessions such 
that prize items are readily visible. Selection of prizes, maint enance of the prize cabinet, and policies 
regarding prize redemption will follow guidance on administration of TangiblePBCM within the context 
of research protocols [68].  
▪ VoucherPBCM: For participants assigned to VoucherPBCM, prize draws resulting in one or more small, 
large, or jumbo wins will be reinforced with VA Canteen vouchers in the specified incentive range. Participants in this condition may additionally be asked to provide information on voucher redemption 
using a self- report or clinician/researcher- administered CM Voucher Survey.  
Weekly Check -In Appointments (12 Weeks). Participant outcomes (outpatient treatment engagement, % 
cocaine -negative urines, self- reported days of use) will be followed throughout the 12 week treatment 
interval; during this period the timeline follow -back pr ocedure will be administered by [CONTACT_14379] -
person on an approximately weekly basis. During the treatment interval, the timeline follow -back 
procedure will always be administered such that the beginning of the assessment interview corresponds 
with the last  occurrence of the timeline follow -back procedure.  In this way we will endeavor to collect 
self- reported substance use data for the full 12 week treatment interval.  This effectively means that 
one or more missed check- in appointments may be administered at the time of the next check -in 
attended, if needed. Outpatient substance use treatment engagement and urinalysis results will be monitored through review of participant medical records.  Participants will additionally be asked to 
provide regular updates regarding any changes in their housing status or medications (including changes 
in dosing schedule and/or clinic privileges for patients in medication -assisted treatment) and 
participation in non -VA substance use treatment (e.g., 12 -step meetings in the co mmunity).  For CM 
participants, this information may be gathered, in part or in full, during 1:1 CM treatment appointments.  
This information will, however, also be assessed during check -in appointments to ensure that relevant 
information is reliably track ed for all participants, regardless of current participation in CM sessions (see 
Supplemental Check -in Questions uploaded under Section 3.2).   
Follow -up Visit: A subset of procedures from the Screening/Baseline Assessment will be repeated at the 
conclusion of the 12 week treatment interval for all participants.  Procedures will generally involve 
repetition of the EEG procedure, re -administration of cognitive/cognitive -behavioral testing, and re -
administration of one or more self- report questionnaire measures.  The timeline follow -back procedure 
will generally also be completed again at the time of the follow -up visit and specific items from the 
Addiction Severity Index Lite may also be re -administered.  To optimize test -retest reliability of the 
Personalized Delay Discounting task (if applicable), we will attempt to identify a new set of personally -
relevant future event tags with similar valence, s alience, and arousal to those utilized at Baseline 
Assessment through repetition of the Positive- Neutral Future Events interview at the time of the Follow-
up Visit. A -B variants of cognitive/cognitive -behavioral tests may also be employed as needed.  It is  
noted that, in some cases, the follow- up visit may occur earlier or later than 12 weeks following 
treatment initiation.  Some flexibility in the timing of the follow -up session may be necessary in order to 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192037] -treatment data on as many participants as possible.  It is, for 
example, possible that a participant might conclude treatment earlier than 12 weeks due to returning to 
work or moving out of the area.  In such case s, we would invite the participant to complete the follow -
up session early.  Similarly, delays in scheduling of the follow -up session may also occur for a variety of 
reasons.  Provided that the participant is still willing to complete the follow -up session , this session may 
therefore also be scheduled to occur more than 12 weeks from the start of treatment.  For healthy 
controls, a follow -up visit will also be conducted after the initial session , at a delay similar to that 
achieved within the patient sample . This session may include repetition of other measures conducted at 
baseline, which can include the repetition of the EEG procedure, cognitive -behavioral testing, and/or 
self- report questionnaires.  
Monthly Check -In Appointments (24 Weeks). CM -assigned participants will engage in research visits on 
an approximately monthly basis for [ADDRESS_1192038] -
treatment interval.  This effectively means that one or more missed check -in appointments may be 
administered at the time of the next check- in attended, if needed. Healthy controls will not participate 
in Check -in Visits.   
If necessary, longer research visits (e.g., Screening/Consent, Baseline, Follow- up may occur over one or 
more sessions in order to support complete data collection.  
Unexpected Findings:  While EEG procedures will be conducted for research purposes only, it is possible 
that abnormal patterns of brain activity could be detected during the procedure.  While we do not 
anticipate such incidental findings due to the nature of the EEG procedure and equipment to be utilized, participants will be informed that such findings are possible during the consent process, as well as of our 
procedure for handling such findings should they be detected.  Specifically, participants will be  informed 
that we will inform their primary care physician of any incidental findings from the EEG procedure in 
order to ensure that appropriate clinical follow -up can be initiated. It is also possible that we might 
identify new information about a participant's current mental health as a consequence of clinical 
interviews conducted in the context of the study.  For example, it is possible that we will identify that a 
participant meets criteria for a mental health condition that has not previously been docu mented in 
his/her medical record.  Participants will also be informed of this possibility during the consent process and we will ask to share any such findings with the participant's mental health treatment coordinator.  
Finally, it is possible that a part icipant will have a breathalyzer test result that places him/her above the 
legal limit to operate a motor vehicle (BAC ≥ 0.08).  In such cases, we will repeat the breathalyzer test to 
confirm the result and, if the second test result confirms a BAC ≥ 0.[ADDRESS_1192039] the VA police with 
the participant's name [CONTACT_225458].  The VA police will then respond according to their procedure for 
handling intoxicated patients who are at risk of driving.  Participants will also be informed of this policy 
during th e informed consent process and will have an opportunity to ask questions.  Participants will 
also have the opportunity to decline participation if they do not agree to any policies regarding the 
handling of incidental or unexpected findings.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Appointment Reminders:   Phone outreach will generally be conducted prior to the Screening Visit, 
Baseline Assessment, and Follow -up (Post -Treatment) Visit in order to remind participants of these 
upcoming appointments and, if necessary, provide additional  information (e.g., instructions for 
preparing for the appointment, directions to the Research Office Building).  Participants may also be provided with a written appointment reminder (see Section 8).  Weekly check -ins will generally be 
conducted during sc heduled CM treatment visits but may also be conducted by [CONTACT_141407] a 
research visit outside the context of a CM treatment session (for example, this will be the case for 
participants assigned to treatment -as-usual).  Phone calls may therefore also be  conducted, as 
necessary, to schedule and/or remind participants of upcoming check -ins.  Monthly check -ins will 
generally be conducted by [CONTACT_648]; however, a reminder phone call may also be made prior to a 
scheduled monthly phone check -in if needed or reques ted by [CONTACT_2299].  
Retention Procedures:  Due to the nature of our study population (treatment- seeking substance users) it 
may be necessary to reschedule initial study appointments (e.g., Screening Visit, Baseline Assessment) 
due to No Shows, recent substance use, or other f actors.  For example, it is not uncommon that 
motivation to engage with substance use treatment will fluctuate and patients may, for example, cancel 
or postpone initial appointments for this reason.  In order to capture a representative sample of 
treatment- seeking substance users we will make efforts to reschedule initial study appointments that 
have been cancelled or missed as long as the following conditions are met:  (1) the participant continues 
to express strong interest in study participation and (2) the participant continues to meet  general  
eligibility criteria for the study.  With respect to the latter condition, a previously eligible participant 
may, for example, become ineligible prior to completing initial study appointments if he/she elects to begin Contingency Management treatment prior to completing these appointments. However, as stated 
later in this protocol, eligibility will be assessed prior to enrollment and there may be some cases in which the duration of abstinence exceeds that stated in our criteria  such that an interested participant 
can be rescheduled for a missed initial research appointment without encouraging resumed cocaine use in order to continue meeting eligibility criteria.   Because participants may only begin treatment offered  
through the study after completing the Screening Visit and Baseline Assessment, individuals will be 
reminded that they can elect to pursue Contingency Management treatment outside the context of the 
study if they wish to begin treatment at an earlier time point than what might be possible through the 
study.  It may also be necessary to re -evaluate eligibility and repeat screening/consent (and potentially 
baseline testing) procedures for individuals who have previously engaged with the study but have not progressed to the point of randomization in the past.  For example, this may apply to individuals whose 
progress through the study was interrupted by [CONTACT_25963] -[ADDRESS_1192040] access to a 12 -week course of treatment, regardless of 
attendance dur ing treatment (or continued participation in the study).  Consequently, unless a 
participant has voluntarily withdrawn (or been withdrawn) from treatment, we will make an effort to 
schedule Contingency Management appointments throughout the 12 week treatment period.  This may 
involve up to three outreach attempts (phone and/or letter) after a missed appointment.  We will follow 
a similar protocol for missed research check -ins, as well as for the Follow -Up Visit.  For missed check -in 
appointments, we will ty pi[INVESTIGATOR_855849] (phone and/or letter).  However, 
because our study population may have inconsistent telephone service, an additional five outreach 
attempts may be made, as needed (for example, in cases in which a participant's mob ile phone service 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 has been temporarily disabled).  This outreach protocol will also apply to scheduling and/rescheduling of 
the Follow- Up Visit.  We will additionally ask participants to provide an optional alternative contact [CONTACT_111316] -related communications.  Optional alternative contact [CONTACT_855924] -compliant messages to participants or to request updated contact [CONTACT_19297] a participant 
who has been difficult to contact [CONTACT_855925]/her chart.  Participants may 
also elect to update or rescind alternative contact [CONTACT_855926].  Participants will be 
reminded that they may withdraw from the study at any time in retention -related communications (for 
example, see letters included under Section 8).  We w ill otherwise continue to attempt weekly or 
monthly check -ins (depending on condition assignment and study phase) on a weekly or monthly basis, 
respectively, for all actively enrolled participants.  For participants who do not respond to the previously 
described outreach effort and are approaching the end of the study interval, we will transmit a final 
outreach letter to the participant that will provide study contact [CONTACT_3031], instructions for withdrawal from the study, as well as the date upon which st udy participation will automatically 
terminate.  For participants assigned to Treatment -as-Usual, this date will be 30 days after the end of 
the 12 -week treatment interval and for participants assigned to one of the two Contingency 
Management conditions, t his date will be 210 days from the end of the 12 -week treatment interval (i.e., 
[ADDRESS_1192041] -treatment timepoint).  
Chart Abstraction Procedures: Information in participant electronic health records will be reviewed and 
data from CPRS may be added to study records at several points during the study.  Prior to providing 
written informed consent, prospective participants undergoing telephone screening will be asked to 
verbally consent to review of their CPRS records by [CONTACT_3462].  During screening procedures (and 
following either verbal (by [CONTACT_648]) or written (in person) consent), information relevant to participant 
eligibility will be reviewed and documented. Eligible participants who enroll in the study will also be 
subject to additional chart abstraction procedures throughout the course of the study.  Chart abstraction will generally occur on an approximately weekly  basis during the 12 week treatment interval 
and will primarily involve documentation of outpatient substance use/behavioral health treatment 
engagement, missed and cancelled substance use/behavioral health appointments, missed doses of 
medication -assisted  treatment (if applicable), lab -based drug- alcohol urinalysis results, changes in 
medications, changes to housing or legal status, and/or any other relevant changes to psychiatric of 
medical status.  Data from Contingency Management sessions may also be re viewed for consistency 
with study tracking logs.  In addition, data on previous courses of Contingency Management participants may additionally be abstracted for those with prior Contingency Management treatment experience.  
Following the 12 week treatment interval, chart abstraction procedures will continue for participants 
assigned to one of the two Contingency Management treatment conditions but will occur on an 
approximately monthly basis.  Examples of forms used for Chart Abstraction thought the Dacima Clinical 
Suite are included under Section 15 (Miscellaneous Documents).   Following consent to the study, data 
on engagement with CM treatment, not delivered through the study, may also be derived from review 
of the patient’s chart.  
Use of Meal Tickets: Participants will be eligible to receive a same -day meal ticket if scheduled for >3 
hours of testing during any given visit.  In order to ensure comparable prize options for participants assigned to VoucherPBCM and TangiblePBCM, a meal ticket option will also be made available in the CM 
Prize Cabinet.   
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Use of Bus Tickets: Need -based travel assistance will be made available to all participants in the form of 
single use bus tickets.

* Will Usual Care Procedures/Interventions be used?"  
  Yes No 
If yes, please specify and include a description of what the usual care or expected level of care is at 
VAPHS (e.g., medications, testing, timing, etc.) for patients, similar to those individuals that meet the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria for this research  study:

individual psychotherapy targeting problematic substance use. Contingency Management (CM) is also 
frequently recommended for such patients. At VAPHS, CM invol ves twice weekly urine- based drug 
testing (point- of-care and confirmatory urinalysis) for chances to win abstinence -contingent reward.  
All participants will receive treatment -as-usual during the [ADDRESS_1192042] two outpatient group and/or individual psychotherapy encounters within CTAD per week; participants will additionally continue pharmacotherapy for 
substance use and/orother mental health conditions, if applic able. The majority of participants will also 
receive one of two different versions of CM, already used within the VA (specifically, VoucherPBCM or 
Tangibl ePBCM).  
 
   
2.1   
If Usual Care Procedures/Interventions will be used, who is the individual or entity responsible for 
relevant aspects of the usual care (i.e., which of the above usual care activities will the research study 
team be responsible for)?:  
The research study team will specifically be responsible for the delivery of CM within the context of the 
current study. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_855851]. She will oversee this aspect of us ual care in consultation with the National CM 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Implementation Team, as well as other CTAD providers. CM will be delivered by [CONTACT_855927] [INVESTIGATOR_855852](s) .

3.0   
* Does clinical expertise need to be enlisted?  
  Yes No 
 
If yes, please provide the provisions for enlisting the services of a clinician with appropriate expertise 
and privileges to perform duties, if the investigator is not a clinician [i.e. reviewing the data, adverse 
events, and new study findings; also makin g required decisions to protect the health of the subject (e.g., 
stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_79633]’s involvement in the study or determining when to notify the subject or the subject’s health care provider of information that may affect the health of the subject)]:  
It is possible that circumstances could present during the study that would require clinical expertise. While suicidal/homicidal ideation and behaviors are not a focus of the current study, it is always possible 
that an imminent threat to the safety of the self or other could be disclosed during study assessments or 
CM treatment visits. If this should occur, study activities will be discontinued and study personnel will 
respond to the mental health crisis. This may include contact[CONTACT_5713]'s mental he alth provider 
and/or escorting the patient to the mental health walk -in clinic or emergency department with the 
assistance of VA police. If such symptoms are described over the phone (or during a video call), study 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 personnel will follow the VAPHS warm -transfer protocol and/or VVC e911 protocol. This protocol is 
designed to ensure a warm transfer of the call to either the Veterans Crisis Line or local emergency 
services. Study personnel will also contact [CONTACT_102]'s  mental health provider in such cases to ensure 
appropriate follow -up. Participants will be informed of the limits of confidentiality during the informed 
consent process for the study. Significance of risk will be assessed by [CONTACT_978] . [CONTACT_856019] has substantial 
experience working with individuals at elevated risk of suicide/homicide and has managed mental health crises in both research and clinical settings.  
During participation in study procedures, it is also possible that an incidental finding could occur. We do 
not anticipate that incidental findings are likely because we are not conducting assessments for clinical 
purposes, designed to identify new medical  or psychiatric problems. For example, the EEG procedure we 
describe herein is different from that used by a neurologist and is not designed to inform diagnosis of 
brain -related disorders. However, if data collected from a participant are found to be anomalous in 
some way, we will notify the participant of this within one week and will also share the result with the 
participant's Primary Care Physician. Similarly, it is possible that we may identify a previously 
undiagnosed mental health condition during st udy interviews. If this should occur and the information is 
relevant to ongoing care, we will share this information with the patient's mental health treatment coordinator. Participants will be alerted to the protocol for handling incidental findings durin g the 
informed consent process.

View: 4.1 Research study methods: analysis Plan   
1.0  * Please describe the analysis plan for the study (it is acceptable to refer to the sponsor/multi- site 
protocol for section if applicable):  
Data Analytic Plan.  
EEG Data Preprocessing.  Data from both incentive delay and flankers tasks will be visually inspected and band -pass filtered using parameters specific to each analysis. Data will subsequently be corrected for 
ocular, movement, and (if applicable) line nois e artifact, using independent components analysis or 
possibly other methods. If necessary, bad channels will be replaced with interpolated data. Data from 
each task will be segmented into event- locked epochs.  Epochs with significant residual artifact will be 
rejected and a current source density transformation may  be applied to improve spatial resolution, prior 
to analysis , if deemed necessary . Alpha suppression will be computed for the pre -feedback reward 
anticipation interval in the Incentive Delay task by [CONTACT_855928] -related spectral power in the alpha 
band (8 -12 Hz), relative to a pre -response baseline interval. Differential alpha suppression to high 
magnitude tangible versus voucher prizes will be quantified at occipi[INVESTIGATOR_129372] (O1, Oz, O2) within  the 
[ADDRESS_1192050] responses at sites FCz and/ and Cz will be used as the 
measure of ERN amplitude. The sum of differences in stimulus -locked N2 amplitude between congruent 
vs. intermediate incongruity conditions and congruent vs. high incongruity conditions will be used to 
quantify pa rametric modulation of conflict N2 by [CONTACT_855929]. For functional 
connectivity analyses, data will be bandpass filtered into targeted  frequency bands ( e.g., delta, theta, 
alpha, beta, and gamma). Theta frequency synchronization between ACC electrode sites ( e.g., Cz, FCz) 
and lPFC electrode sites ( e.g., F3, F4, F5, F6) will specifically be evaluated for error vs. correct and 
congruent vs. incongruent trials using synchronization likelihood  or a similar approach . Exploratory 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 network level analyses may  also be conducted for event -locked epochs from both Incentive Delay and 
Flankers tasks.  In addition, based on exploratory findings from our pi[INVESTIGATOR_52089] (Pro1787) we may 
additionally conduct exploratory analyses of our brief pre -task baseline (resting -state) EEG recordings 
including quantification of eyeblink rate and related metrics from EOG and EEG and channels.  
Cognitive -Behavioral Data Preprocessing. In the Personalized Delay Discounting task, switch points will 
be determined for each participant based on decision outcomes for trials in each condition (with personally -relevant event tags, without personally -relevant event tags) and latency. Switch points 
represent the monetary amount at which a switch from immediate preference to delayed preference (or 
vice versa) takes place, suggesting similar subjective valuation of immediate and delayed amounts in 
that contex t. Next, a hyperbolic discounting model will be fit to switch point data on an individual 
subject basis to determine the discounting slope parameter, k. The difference in the natural log of k for 
event tag versus standard (no event tag) discounting conditi ons will subsequently be computed for each 
subject as an index of self -controlled decision -making in the context of epi[INVESTIGATOR_10681]. No 
preprocessing is necessary to compute Brown -Peterson test scores; the total score (sum of all correct 
responses ) will be used as the primary index of performance.  
Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_855853]. Pupi[INVESTIGATOR_855854]/or pre -task baseline EEG recordings.  
These data will be pre- preprocessed utilizing standard methods under th e direction of co -investigator, 
[CONTACT_856018], in preparation for additional exploratory analyses.  
Power Analysis and Sample Size. In analyses of baseline predictors of treatment response in CM 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (estimated n = 119 -140) and long- term (i.e., six month) outcomes (estimated n = 105 -140), 
using the statistical rule of thumb of needing [ADDRESS_1192051] methods are further supported for an expanded set of variables, as this highly flexible and powerful a pproach has been validated in “wide datasets,” wherein the number of predictors 
exceeds the number of observations. With the anticipated enrollment of 1 40 participants, there will 
additionally be adequate power (β = 0.20, alpha = 0.05) to detect an effect size of f = 0.12 for the 
treatment adherence (adherent, non -adherent)  X time (baseline, follow -up) interaction, supporting 
planned comparison of treatment -related change in neural and cognitive -behavioral measures between 
PBCM adherent and non -adherent Vet erans . Assuming 15% attrition, the estimate of the detectable 
effect size for the treatment X time interaction for a total sample size of 1 19 is f = 0.13. The anticipated 
effect size of treatment- related change in synchronization likelihood between ACC -lPFC electrode sites is 
not known. However, previous work has established a medium -to-large effect size for treatment -related 
change in the ERN and N2 (in association with cognitive training). [74,75 ]  
 
It was necessary to revise our original analytic plan to accommodate a smaller sample size than that 
originally projected. Recruitment under the current protocol was initially delayed due to institutional 
barriers that prevented timely acquisition of our EEG system. While recruitment was promptly initiated after our equipment was finally received, approximately three months later, all research activities were 
suspended due to risks posed by [CONTACT_25963] -19 pandemic. Due to the collection of EEG data and the 
nature of the interventions under study  (e.g., need to be i n the physical presence of the prize cabinet to 
potentially benefit from the increased psychological proximity of reward) , it was not possible to convert 
the current protocol to be conducted fully remotely during the pandemic.  A series of administrative 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192052] with potentially eligible participants.  
While a variety of new recruitment methods were introduced, our final sample size was much smaller 
than originally projected.  
 
To address limitations related to the ratio of observations to predictors in the context of our reduced sample size, we revised our predictive analytic approach  (Specific Aim 1)  to prioritize model stability and 
interpretability, while framing results as more preliminary in nature. With respect to Aim 1, a revised 
sample size of ~50 participants was identified as sufficient to supp ort investigation of up to five 
candidate predictors:  e.g.,  two EEG -derived metrics, one clinical measure, one neurocognitive measure, 
and treatment condition. Recent simulation -based work (Austin & Steyerberg, 2015) further suggests 
that as few as two participants per predictor may be adequate, supporting investigation of the original 
candidate set even within the reduced sample. Two consulting biostatisticians endorsed this revised 
approach and further recommended modeling r epeated binary outcomes over th e course of CM 
treatment to improve power. In line with this recommendation, we modeled [ADDRESS_1192053] selection guided by [CONTACT_855930] (AIC) to construct a parsimonious, 
interpretable multivariate model. To further assess model robustness and generalizability, we evaluated 
predictive performance using leave -one-out cross -validation (LOOCV).    
 
Implications of our reduced sample  size were also considered for Specific Aim 2, which involves 
longitudinal analysis of change in key neurocognitive metrics w ith adherence and abstinence as 
potential covariates. Based on guidance from statistical consultants, a sensitivity analysis indicated that 
a total sample size of [ADDRESS_1192054] sizes (f = 0.17 –0.30). This revised projection reflects the 
practical constraints of the available sample w hile maintaining sufficient power for detecting meaningful 
change over time in the context of repeated measures analysis.  As an alternative analytic strategy, a 
median split approach to adherence and abstinence may be considered if data suggest that dichotomization would enhance interpretability or improve model stability in the context of limited sample size. While treating these variables as continuous covariates is generally preferred due to increased power and retention of variance, a binary approach may be appropriate in cases of non -linear 
relationships, bimodal distributions, or when simplifying the model structure offers clear interpretive advantages.  
Specific Aim 1. Evaluate the utility of EEG and cognitive -behavioral measures of FMDM as predictors of 
differential treatment outcomes in TangiblePBCM versus VoucherPBCM. A significant interaction 
between CM treatment condition (i.e., TangiblePBCM versus V oucherPBCM) and neurocognitive indices 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 of FMDM function (i.e., EEG and cognitive -behavioral measures) is hypothesized. Specifically, individuals 
demonstrating greater FMDM impairment (poorer working memory function, less reduction in delay 
discounting with inclusion of future event tags, and re duced EEG/ERP signaling to abstract future reward 
and control demands) will achieve better outcomes in Tangible PBCM, relative to VoucherPBCM 
(Hypothesis 1a).  In models including PBCM treatment condition as a factor, inclusion of EEG and cognitive -behavio ral predictors is expected to significantly reduce prediction error with respect to both 
PBCM treatment response and long -term outcomes. Differential alpha suppression in response to 
tangible prize versus voucher prize rewards, in particular, will assay en gagement by [CONTACT_855931]. Consequently, differential alpha suppression is expected to be an especially robust predictor of outcomes in existing PBCM variants.  It is further hypothesized that thi s candidate neuromarker will be selected for inclusion in a readily translatable 
predictive model – even when incorporating resource constraints that penalize predictors derived from 
more costly procedures (e.g., EEG incurring a greater cost -based penalty than self -report measures; 
Hypothesis 1b).  
The proposed design affords measurement of all candidate predictors prior to initiation of PBCM, as well 
as monitoring of both CM treatment response and long- term outcomes for all CM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Predictive 
models of CM treatment response and long- term outc omes will be developed separately , with the 
caveat that our revised final sample size may not support the latter. Candidate predictors will include 
pretreatment FMDM -related EEG (concrete versus abstract alpha suppression, ERN amplitude, 
parametric N2 amplitude effect) and cognitive -behavioral measures (Brown -Peterson score, ∆ln(k)), as 
well as clinical indicators (e.g.,  craving severity, past month cocaine use, number of previous treatment 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]) ) and self -report scores. In order to examine the interaction between candidate predictors and 
CM reward parameters, PBCM condition (TangiblePBCM versus VoucherPBCM) will also be considered 
as an explanatory variable in predictive models.  
I will receive focused training in predictive modeling, with an emphasis on recursive partitioning machine learning methods: classification and regression trees (CART) and random forests (RF). Our original analytic plan proposed that r egression trees w ould  be grown to examine the predictive 
structure of explanatory variables (including PBCM treatment condition) with respect to the following 
continuous outcomes: (1) % cocaine -negative urines during CM, (2) % CM sessions attended, (3) % days 
of any self- repor ted substance use during CM, and (4) % days of self -reported stimulant use during the [ADDRESS_1192055] (RF) approach w ould  subsequently be implemented with each set of predictors and 
outcomes to objectively evalua te the relative importance of each predictor and optimize overall model 
performance. RF involves growing an ensemble of decision trees based on bootstrapped samples of observations and predictors to increase tree diversity. This method includes internal cr oss-validation 
using out -of-bag error rates (based on observations not included in the bootstrap sample) to limit 
overfitting during model training and performs well without excessive tuning of model parameters. 
Taken together these data mining approaches would  provide deep insight into interrelationships 
between predictors and outcomes of interest and could also be further examined through a a resource -
constrained Tabu search procedure to develop multiple regression models forecasting treatment response (% cocaine -negative urines) in each PBCM variant, while penalizing individual predictors based 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192056] of measuring these signals but is 
ideally suited to this issue in measurement -based care.  In our revised approach, we employed 
longitudinal logistic regression as described above and specifically examined outcomes on a per session 
basis, with provision of a cocaine -negative specimen at the session being considered a successful 
outcome and coca ine-positive or missing specimens considered unsuccessful. This revised approach 
enables more efficient use of the available data by [CONTACT_855932], rather than relying on a single aggregated outcome.  
Missing Data Strategies: Recursive partitioning approaches (CART, RF) flexibly handle missing data for candidate predictors through several heuristic and/or interpolation based approaches. Missing data 
handling for TABU search is not yet well- characterized  but works well, provided that missing data is 
randomly distributed and relatively rare. Expecting a 15% rate of attrition, usable substance use outcome data is anticipated for a minimal sample size of n = 119 CM recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. Additional outcome 
variables will be derived from chart review (e.g., treatment engagement, urinalysis results), providing 
additional options for quantifying outcomes, not contingent on participation in study check -in 
appointments. Importantly, all methods specified above can be used wi th binary outcomes (i.e., CM -
completer versus CM -non-completer). Consequently, while efforts will be made to collect detailed 
outcome data on each participant (and this appears feasible on the basis of my ongoing pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080]), 
primary predictive modeling  aims can be accomplished under circumstances of high attrition and data 
loss.  Our revised analytic approach has also been configured to be resilient to missingness through 
handling missing specimens as unsuccessful outcome s using an intent -to-treat approach.  Where 
necessary (e.g., for treatment trajectories impacted by [CONTACT_47098]),  a Bayesian logistic regression 
model  can also be used to impute missing values based on  observed patterns to estimate likely values 
for unobserved responses.  
Specific Aim 2. Evaluate longitudinal change in cognitive -behavioral and EEG- based indices of FMDM 
during CM. Engagement in PBCM will be associated with differential enhancement of control- related 
theta synchronization between ACC and lPFC during high conflict events in the Parametric Conflict 
Flankers task, relative to PBCM nonadherence and will also foster greater improvement in working 
memory and epi[INVESTIGATOR_855855] (Hypothesis 2a). Individual differences 
in treatment re sponse trajectory during CM will also be explored as a factor in neuroadaptive change 
during treatment (Exploratory Sub -Aim).  
Increased functional connectivity within control -related brain networks in conjunction with CM would 
reflect important mechanisms of neural recovery facilitated by [CONTACT_791841]. I will receive training in 
functional connectivity analysis of EEG data, which may include  a series of learning experiences guided 
by [CONTACT_148783] -mentor, [CONTACT_770790], and consultants, Drs. Hetrick, Kim, and Sporns. Most importantly, I will 
receive training in synchronization likelihood, a nonlinear approach to estimating functional co nnectivity 
which measures statistical dependencies in dynamic time series and can thus characterize both linear and nonlinear interdependencies in EEG data. T his technique  may be applied  to evaluate 
synchronization strength between pairs of electrodes and within frequency bands, based on a priori 
hypotheses , although more traditional functional connectivity measures may also be utilized . 
Specifically, theta frequency synchronization between ACC and lPFC electrode sites will be computed to 
quantify transient  network dynamics related to control modulation. Treatment -related change in 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 executive working memory and delay discounting behavior will also be evaluated as cognitive -behavioral 
indicators of FMDM -related function.  
Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be conducted to evaluate treatment -related 
change in the following indices of FMDM between PBCM  adherent and non -adherent : (1) control -
related theta synchrony between ACC and lPFC, (2) Brown -Peterson working memory score, and (3) 
change in the epi[INVESTIGATOR_855856] (∆ ln(k)). A general linear model 
design will be utilized including asses sment latency (baseline versus follow- up) as a within -subjects 
factor. In order to account for differences in substance use, adherence, and PBCM treatment condition, 
these factors (% days of use, % sessions attended, PBCM condition) may also be considered as 
covariates or between -subjects factors using a median split approach. Tukey’s HSD (or equivalent) will 
be used for post hoc evaluation of marginal means to clarify main and interaction effects. Adjusted 
marginal means may  be used to investigate covariates as moderators of the treatment- by-time 
interaction. Given the previously ide ntified relationship between ACC -lPFC theta phase synchrony and 
amplitude of the ERN and conflict N2,66,67 treatment -related change in these ERPs may also  be 
evaluated using the same approach. Correlations between ERN/N2 amplitudes and ACC -lPFC theta 
synchrony, as well between EEG and cognitive -behavioral measures, may  also be computed for each 
timepoint to identify significant linear relationships between dependent measures .  To account for the 
constraints of a reduced sample size, we may employ alternativ e statistical approaches as needed —
particularly to address non -normality and other assumption violations that could compromise model 
validity.  
Additional exploratory analyses  may also  be conducted to investigate trajectories of recovery during 
PBCM in relation to neuroadaptive change. I will receive specialized training in multilevel modeling 
approaches to longitudinal data analysis, including use of growth mixture models to resolve latent 
subgroups exhibiting distinct patterns of longitudinal change. For participants assigned to both PBCM 
conditions, longest duration of cocaine abstinence may  be computed on a weekly basis from within -
treatment ur inalysis results and attendance (unexcused, missed appointments will also be considered to 
end a period of abstinence). Growth mixture modeling may  subsequently be employed to evaluate intra -
individual change in the longest duration of abstinence achieved during PBCM treatment and determine 
if distinct change profiles meaningfully represent inter- individual variance. If identified, subgroups 
exhibiti ng distinct trajectories in PBCM may also exhibit different patterns of neural recovery within 
functional con nectivity networks underlying cognitive control and reward representation. Exploratory, 
network -based analyses may  therefore also be conducted (if applicable) and may generate new insights 
into neuroadaptive processes that reflect and may also support sustained abstinence in CM. Cocaine 
users have previously been demonstrated to exhibit reduced interhemispheric functi onal connectivity 
within the dorsal frontoparietal control network, which is thought to support goal -directed top -down 
control of attention an d behavior, as well as representation and anticipation of future rewards. My 
training in functional connectivity analysis of EEG data will support exploratory analysis of network -level 
disturbances in CUD, as well as potential treatment -related change in interhemispheric functional 
connectivity within the dorsal frontoparietal control network in relation to CM. Using methods 
previously described by [CONTACT_855933], Drs. Hetrick, Kim, and Sporns, I may also  employ 
synchronization likelihood to identify localized functional connectivity networks that significantly differ 
between CUD subgroups exhibiting different patterns of cocaine abstinence during CM. Briefly, pairwise 
synchronization likelihood will be computed between all pairs of EEG channels for reward - and control -
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192057] the opportunity to combine synchronization likelihood with graph theoretic approaches t o 
functional connectivity analysis. Consequently, additional exploratory analyses can  target differences in 
network -level properties within local (e.g., strength, local efficiency, betweenness centrality) and global 
(e.g., path length, small worldness, global efficiency) functional connectivity structures.  However, it is 
noted that additional exploratory analyses can only be undertaken if the final sample size is sufficient to 
support them.  
Missing Data Strategies:  Individuals lost to follow -up will be excluded from these analyses due to 
necessary inclusion of longitudinal measures from the follow -up timepoint. It is anticipated that 
covariates of interest will be available for all individuals who complete the follow- up assessment 
session. Specifically, treatment engagement will be determined on the basis of chart review and self-reported substance use will be evaluated on a weekly basis. For participants who miss one or more 
check -in assessm ent during the treatment period, the timeline follow- back procedure will be extended 
to evaluate the full period between the present and previous study contact. In my previous longitudinal 
study of substance users, I was able to collect all necessary follo w-up data on 80.8% of my originally 
enrolled sample.  However, it is also possible that unexpected circumstances may require imputation of 
missing data values .  In such cases imputation of missing values will leverage available within - and 
between -subjects data.  
Additional exploratory analyses and quality assessment analyses will also be conducted over the course of the study.  Consequently, the analysis plan outlined above will not cover all analyses that may be 
potentially undertaken with the current dataset.   Similarly, additional approaches to data preprocessing 
(filtering, data reduction, artifact rejection, etc.) that are not described above may also be applied in 
order to optimize signal quality for the purposes of proposed and exploratory analyses.  It is noted that, because of the nature of the current study (human subjects research, psychophysiological research), data points may not be reliably collected as prescribed for all participants and timepoints.  For example, 
missing data may occur if a participant chooses to discontinue study procedures during an assessment 
visit due to fatigue or external obligations.  Data loss may also occur due to equipment failure or other 
conditions results in poor quality data during psychophysiological recordings and cogn itive -behavioral 
testing procedures.

SUB-STUDY 1:  FEASIBILITY OF CM TREATMENT VIA TELEHEALTH TREATMENT SESSIONS  
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192058] 
be termina ted (as was the case in 3/2020).  We would therefore like to conduct a sub -study to test the 
feasibility of conducting CM sessions via telehealth treatment sessions.  Specifically, we will experiment 
with methods for delivering CM via VA Video Connect sess ions.  One or more Veterans will be provided 
with oral fluid point -of-care tests and will be trained on how to perform this type of objective testing 
during VVC sessions such that results can be remotely reviewed and prize draws rewarded accordingly.  Participants in this case study will receive the standard voucher version of PBCM offered at VAPHS and 
prize vouchers will be delivered to or retrieved by [CONTACT_855934].  Participants will additionally be asked to provide feedback on hom e-based point -of-care testing, methods for 
remotely conducted CM prize draws, prize transmissal, and other related aspects of remotely -delivered 
CM treatment. As described in the Substudy consent form, a combination of remote and in -person 
treatment sessio ns may be offered, depending upon the unique needs of each participant and/or 
barriers to remote implementation that may present over time.  
Between 1 -15 Veterans will be invited to take part in telehealth -based CM treatment sessions.  We will 
specifically make an effort to invite individuals to participate for whom in -person CM sessions are not 
preferred because (1) the Veteran is at high risk for complications from COVID -19, (2) the Veteran is 
under quarantine due to COVID -positive status or housing- related restrictions, or (3) the Veteran has 
ongoing transportation problems that make attending in -person treatment sessions more difficult.  All 
participants will be either be self- referred or clinician -referred to receive CM services and will meet 
general requirements for this type of treatment (e.g., ongoing problematic stimulant use).  Participants 
must also be willing and able to participate in telehealth services, appropriate for telehealth care, and able to interact and communicate through audio and visual elements of the VVC platform.  No other eligibility criteria will apply.  Participants in the substudy may be former (e.g., completed or w ithdrawn) 
participants from the primary protocol or participants determined ineligible to participate in the primary 
protocol.  Participants will not receive any compensation for participating other than prizes received in 
the course of treatment.  Aside f rom the use of VA -approved telehealth technology to remotely conduct 
CM treatment sessions, the CM protocol to be used in this substudy will be identical to that prescribed 
by [CONTACT_91719]'s National CM Implementation effort.  Importantly, similar adaptation of evidence -based 
treatment protocols to telehealth are (and have been) routinely conducted in the course of standard clinical care during the pandemic.  There are also no significant risks associated with the proposed 
telehealth -based protocol -  rather, it is e xpected that this CM option may be lower risk for some 
Veterans.  Potential participants will be informed of this opportunity during either interactions with the 
research team regarding in interest in the primary protocol (e.g., upon screening out) or duri ng initial 
clinical interactions upon referral to CM if barriers to in -person attendance are identified.  Participants 
will provide informed consent to participate in this substudy.  Data collected will generally be limited to 
information typi[INVESTIGATOR_855857] d in the course of standard clinical administration of CM (i.e., self- reported 
use, substance use test results, attendance, etc.).  However, we will additionally take note of any 
feedback from patients regarding the telehealth experience, as well as any technical or logistical 
problems that occur in the course of remote administration.  The goal of this substudy will be to develop and refine methods for remote administration of PBCM should this become necessary in the future. The 
standard CM note template w ill be used to document such sessions in CPRS.  All data collected for this 
substudy can be extracted from documentation of treatment sessions entered in the chart.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Risks and Benefits:  With respect to Substudy 1, participants will have the opportunity to receive a 
telemedicine version of CM that is not otherwise available at our site and this may benefit Veterans for 
whom remote treatment options are indicated or preferred.  There are no significant risks associated 
with the proposed telehealth -based protocol -  rather, it is expected that this CM option may be lower 
risk for some Veterans.  This substudy will combine the use of an approved "standard of care" treatment  
option with approved VA telehealth technology (e.g., VVC) and so does not significantly deviate from 
standard clinical practice.  However, due to the use of Veteran -administered oral fluid testing, this 
treatment protocol would currently only be permissib le in the context of research.  Participants will be 
informed of confidentiality and privacy considerations that are unique to telehealth at the start of each 
session (for example, ensuring that the Veteran has sufficient privacy in their current environme nt), as is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_855858].  
SUB-STUDY 2:  REMOTE PHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING FOR STATE- DEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF 
CRAVING AND USE  
SUB-STUDY 2 Specific Aim: Establish feasibility of data collection using wearable sensors and identify 
promising physiological markers of stimulant craving and/or use between treatment encounters.  
In this sub -study, I will leverage the existing infrastructure of my CDA research to collect supplemental 
physiological and activity data via wearable sensors to identify potential real time markers of craving and use. Participants will be recruited throug h our established recruitment pi[INVESTIGATOR_19189]. Following 
enrollment in the parent protocol, up to [ADDRESS_1192059] -worn ActiGraph wGT3X -BT wearable 
activity monitor and Bluetooth -enabled Polar H7 Heart Rate  monitor. Together, these medical -grade 
wearable devices enable high resolution monitoring of heart rate (including R -R intervals), physical 
activity (including sleep/wake time and related metrics), and compliance without conveying feedback to the wearer. Participants will receive training on routine maintenance of wearable devices, including 
requirements for recharging/changing batteries. Feedback regarding acceptability of wearable 
monitoring, as well as problems encountered, will be recorded at the begin ning and end of sub -study 
participation. Devices will be returned at the conclusion of the 2 -week recording period, whereupon 
data will be downloaded and the participant will be compensated $40. Participants may additionally 
receive daily reminder calls du ring the [ADDRESS_1192060], participants may 
receive a copy of a clinical report, generated by [CONTACT_855935], summarizing activity and sleep data from the recording interval.   
Data Analytic Plan. The number of participants declining to participate in the sub -study, as well as 
feedback regarding acceptability of wearable device monitoring will be quantitively and qualitatively 
summarized.  Data collected through ActiGraph/Polar w earable devices will be reviewed, preprocessed, 
and analyzed using ActiLife software. The proportion of data rejected due to noncompliance (detected 
using ActiLife’s Wear Time Validation Tool) or poor electrocardiography (ECG) signal quality (determined 
through visual inspection) will subsequently be computed. Valid data segments will be subject to 
additional analyses investigating potential markers of high -risk states in wearable data streams. Based 
on previous work and known cardiovascular effects of stim ulants, periods of elevated resting heart rate 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192061] self -reported stimulant use and subsequent stimulant -positive urinalysis. For 
example, periods of elevated heart rate associated with cocaine craving can be distinguished from use 
events based on duration (30 -40 minutes for craving versus 2 hours for use). The number and duration 
of elevated resting heart rate intervals will be investigated as potential predictors of self- reported and 
objectively verified stimulant use using a mixed effects logistic regression approach. Additional 
exploratory features extracted from ECG and activity data (e.g., heart rate variability (linked to craving in 
alcohol users), sleep efficiency (known to be impaired during early cocaine abstinence), and 
number/duration of physical activity bouts) may also be  considered. These preliminary analyses will 
serve to identify promising state- dependent markers from wearable data streams for future 
investigation. Importantly, a mobile interface to be developed under a separate protocol (Pro3566) will 
support ecologica l momentary assessment of craving, stress, and substance use and these data will 
critically inform future efforts to distinguish physiological markers associated with high -risk for use –  of 
relevance to delivery of in the moment interventions –  from actual use events.

Power Analysis and Sample Size. In analyses of baseline predictors of treatment response in CM 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] (estimated n = 119 -140) and long- term (i.e., six month) outcomes (estimated n = 105 -140), 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192063] methods are further 
supported for an expanded set of variables, as this highly flexible and powerful approach has been 
validated in “wide datasets,” wherein the number of predictors exceeds the number of observations. 
With the anticipated enrollment of 1 40 participants, there will additionally be adequate power (β = 0.20, 
alpha = 0.0 5) to detect an effect size of f = 0.12 for the treatment adherence (adherent, non -adherent)  X 
time (baseline, follow -up) interaction, supporting planned comparison of treatment -related change in 
neural and cognitive -behavioral measures between PBCM  adherent and non -adherent subgroups . 
Assuming 15% attrition, the estimate of the detectable effect size for the treatment X time interaction for a total sample size of 1 19 is f = 0.13. The anticipated effect size of treatment- related change in 
synchronization li kelihood between ACC -lPFC electrode sites is not known. However, previous work has 
established a medium -to-large effect size for treatment -related change in the ERN and N2 (in 
association with cognitive training) [69,70].  We have also proposed to compare the treatment- seeking 
CUD sample to the approximately [ADDRESS_1192064] to approaches t o rewarding abstinence.  However, it was ultimately not possible 
to enroll a sufficient healthy comparison sample at our site. In addition, due to factors that negatively impacted participant accrual over the course of the current study (as described elsewhere in the protocol) a revised analytic approach was developed to make use of a sample size that was significantly 
reduced relative to that originally projected.

▪ Stated Goal of Cocaine Abstinence or Reduced Cocaine Use  
▪ Normal or Corrected -to-Normal Visual and Auditory Acuity (e.g., patients with glaucoma or tinnitus 
may be eligible)  
These criteria will be assessed prior to enrollment and it is noted that many participants will no longer 
meet all the above -stated criteria throughout the full study interval. For example, time since most 
recent cocaine use may exceed [ADDRESS_1192066] no history of substance use treatment or will be considered to be in long- term recovery (i.e., having achieved > 1 year of abstinence from cocaine and other illicit

▪ History of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, Seizure Disorder, or other Neurological Conditions resulting in 
structural and/or functional abnormalities of the brain that are expected to reduce interpretability of (or 
acquisition of generalizable knowledge fr om) psychophysiological datasets

IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 ▪ In Long -Term  Residential Treatment  In a Controlled Environment  or Imminently Expected to Enter Such  
Treatment During the Study Interval at the time of Screening  
These criteria will be assessed prior to enrollment and it is  possible that participants will experience a 
change in one or more of these criteria over the course of the study. For example, patients may be 
admitted to residential treatment or experience a  medical hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (unrelated to participation) 
during the study interval. In an effort to collect full and complete longitudinal data on as many 
participants as possible, such circumstances will not necessarily result in participant withdrawal from 
the study. However, if any such change is determined to adversely impact the risk -to-benefit ratio of 
continued participation, investigator -initiated withdrawal of the participant will occur.  
It is further noted that individuals living in transitional housing will be eligible for inclusion. In addition, patients who are scheduled to discharge from a residential treatment program (e.g. CTAD CORE) will be 
considered eligible if they are not immin ently expected to seek admission to another residential 
treatment environment upon discharge.   
Healthy controls will either have no history of substance use treatment or will be considered to be in 
long- term recovery  (i.e.,  having achieved > 1 year of abstinence from cocaine and other illicit 
substances ).  Healthy controls will be excluded if they test positive for substance use (e.g., based on 
breathalyzer test results or urine drug testing) at the time of the baseline assessment.   An effort will be 
made to achieve a healthy comparison sample that is demographically similar to the patient sample and  
it is noted that otherwise eligible individuals may be excluded in order to achieve this objective.

We will not specifically target economically disadvantaged individuals in our recruitment efforts. 
However, it is possible that Veterans interested in participation and eligible for the current study will be 
from economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  
Several safeguards have been established to minimize the risk of coercion or undue influence and to 
protect the rights of our participants.  
Some potential participants will be informed of the study by [CONTACT_855936]. This will allow 
participants to discuss concerns regarding participation with someone who is not directly affiliated with 
the study and who is oriented toward the needs of  the patient rather than the study. We believe this 
will prevent patients from feeling pressured to participate in the current study. We also expect that the majority of potential participants will self- initiate contact [CONTACT_855937]. In th ese cases 
the potential participant has already decided that he/she is interested in the study, which may offset the risk of coercion.  
While we will provide monetary compensation for time and travel, we believe that study payments are reasonable and would not be considered to be coercive. Participants will also be educated that 
"informed consent is an ongoing process" and that they can ch oose to stop participating at any time 
without financial penalty or loss of benefits to which the Veteran would otherwise be entitled. Before 
each procedure, a brief description will be provided, including the rationale for the procedure as well as what th e participant can expect to experience. Participants will be provided with an opportunity to ask 
questions prior to each study procedure and will also be informed that they may decline to begin a 
procedure if they feel uncomfortable in any way. They will also be reminded throughout that they may 
choose to end participation at any time, even if this requires terminating a procedure that is already under way.

this research study. You are under no obligation to participate in this or any other research study 
offered by [CONTACT_4904]. Before you agree to participate in this research study, or at any time during your 
participation in this study, you may discuss your care with another doctor who is not associated with this research study."  
It is noted that some participants will initially receive information about the study from a clinician who is 
not a study co -investigator and will therefore have an opportunity to discuss participation with this 
unaffiliated provider. In addition, we antic ipate that the majority of potentially eligible participants will 
self- initiate contact [CONTACT_7056]. In such cases, potentially eligible participants would not be under 
the direct clinical care of a study investigator involved with CM until after they h ad evaluated their 
interest in the study and determined whether or not they wished to participate. However, it is possible 
that participants under direct clinical care by a study investigator could receive information about the study from that investigator  in some cases. If this should occur, the investigator will identify that he/she 
is involved with the study but will arrange that the screening and informed consent process could be 
conducted by [CONTACT_855938]. The investi gator will inform potential 
participants that such arrangements have been made in order to minimize confusion about roles served 
by [CONTACT_093], as well as any perceived pressure to participate. Study personnel will always take 
care to clearly delineate clinical versus research procedures in which participants may become involved and will make all participants aware that research involvement is voluntary and can be discontinued at any time.

The potential risks to subjects in the proposed research are minimal. The proposed work utilizes only 
noninvasive procedures that suggest a level of risk, comparable to that which is typi[INVESTIGATOR_855859] #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 daily life or in routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. Potential risks include 1) minor 
itchiness or irritation at EEG electrode sites, 2) distress or discomfort during interview and/or self- report 
assessments, and 3) loss of confidentia lity of information collected in the context of the proposed 
research. Risks are specific to involvement in proposed research procedures. Participation in this study will not entail any additional therapeutic risk. There are no known contraindications to C ontingency 
Management. Furthermore, patients will be informed that they may withdraw from the study at any 
time without penalty and will continue to have access to Contingency Management services through 
CTAD.    
3.0 * Describe the safety precautions that will be taken to minimize risks/harms:  
Participants will be informed of potential risks during the informed consent procedure and will also be 
informed of all measures to protect against these risks (detailed below under, Protection Against Risk). 
The risks associated with the proposed research  are minimal and methods in place to protect against 
these risk have already been evaluated and approved by [CONTACT_855939][INVESTIGATOR_855860]. Consequently, the measures in place to protect against risks in the proposed work are expected to be adequate. The 
Contingency Management interventions used within this study are already routinely used within the VA 
and are not associated with any additional risks. Participants will, however, be asked to report any 
change in substance use, mental health symptoms, or gambling behavior that they notice during Contingency Management; while we have no reason to expect such changes, these symptoms will be 
monitored in order to g uard against unknown risks.  
Participants will be informed of potential risks during the informed consent procedure and will also be 
told that they can discontinue the study at any time without penalty or loss of access to treatment 
services. Participants will be informed that they do  not need to answer questions posed in interviews or 
on self -report questionnaires if they do not wish to. They will also be asked to report discomfort during 
the EEG procedure, such as itchiness on the scalp, around electrode sites. If discomfort or distr ess is 
reported during any study procedure, the participant will be asked if he/she wishes to discontinue the procedure. Procedures will be discontinued upon participant request at no risk of penalty. As private 
information will be collected as part of this study, there is a risk of loss of privacy and confidentiality. 
This risk will be described during the informed consent procedure. In addition, all electronic and paper data will be stored in an approved, secure location and will not be transmitted outsid e the VA. All 
possible efforts will be made to limit the inclusion of personally identifiable information on study -
related documents. Personal identifiers will not be used to label study data. Participants will be assigned a study ID and this coded number will be used to identify all paper and electronic files related to study 
participation. The link between the participant ID code and participant name [CONTACT_3047] a single file which will be password -protected and accessible by [CONTACT_855940]; this file will also

be included on informed consent documents or other paper forms that include identifiable information 
(e.g., contact [CONTACT_179714]) and will be stored separately from documents labeled with a participant ID 
code. Participants will be informed of information that may be entered in their personal medical record 
as part of clinical care administered through the study; such informati on may include urinalysis lab 
results and Contingency Management progress notes. Participants will also be informed that they can 
continue with the research study even if they choose to discontinue Contingency Management and/or 
do not wish to provide urine s that will be subject to lab -based urinalysis. It is additionally noted that 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 there are no known contraindications to Contingency Management. In the event that a participant 
assigned to treatment -as-usual expresses a self -assessed need to seek initiation of Contingency 
Management programming prior to conclusion of the 12 week treatm ent interval, the participant will be 
reminded that he/she can voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.

Describe any potential for benefits to participants in this study:  
 
1.0 * Direct and Indirect Benefits to Subjects:  
There are no direct benefits to participants in the proposed research. However, it is noted that 
participants assigned to the TangiblePBCM condition will have access to a version of CM that (while already used within the VA) is not currently offered at VA Pi[INVESTIGATOR_855861] (the versio n currently offered at our site). It is also possible that 
participants will learn new information about themselves through participation in study interviews, self-
report questionnaires, or other procedures. Participants will also be informed that their participation 
may help others by [CONTACT_855941] (as well as substance use recovery, more broadly) and may additionally clarify individual 
differences that affect how people respond to e xisting variants of PBCM.

participate in this study:  
The alternative to participation in the current protocol is non -participation. Veterans who choose not to 
participate will continue to receive treatment- as-usual and may be eligible for other research studies.

Mail Campaign   
1.0 * Please specify whether an “opt -in” or “opt -out” recruitment approach will be 
used. If an “opt -out” approach is planned, please provide a rationale for why the 
IRB should approve this approach including an assessment of the level of risk of 
this study and a description of the direct benefit of this study to all participants:  
The mail campaign targeting potential treatment recipi[INVESTIGATOR_855862] "opt- out" approach 
whereby [CONTACT_855942] a 
specific timeframe (~1 month). Phone outreach will be conducted to confirm that the 
Veteran  is not interested in participating.  
 We believe that an "opt -out" approach is justified for the current protocol for the following 
reasons:  
(1) the current study involves minimal risk  
(2) all participants stand to benefit by [CONTACT_855943]- based  treatment offered 
through the study  
(3) those most likely to benefit from treatment offered through this study (i.e., individuals 
with motivational deficits that interfere with  substance use treatment engagement and/or 
achieving and maintaining cocaine absti nence ) are also least likely to self -initiate contact 
[CONTACT_855944] #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 with the study  
team after receiving a letter.  
 
As described further under #[ADDRESS_1192070] engaged with screening/prescreening activities but did not complete randomization into treatment.  In addition, Veterans identified to have recently tested 
positive for cocaine via drug -alcohol urinalysis results documented in the electronic health 
record may also receive mailings.  In such cases, Veterans known to the study team may be 
contact[CONTACT_855945] a follow -up 
mailing.  
 In addition, our proposed recruitment method also includes several safeguards to ensure 
that patient rights are protected. First, we will send a letter indicating that patients can self -
initiate contact [CONTACT_855946]. We will additionally specify that, if we have not heard from 
the patient by a specific date, the study team may initiate phone contact [CONTACT_855947]. Under these circumstances we will always proceed under th e 
assumption that the participant does not wish to participate (i.e., they have opted out) but 
will contact [CONTACT_855948]- in. We will keep a record 
of participants to whom letters have been sent (including the date s pecified for potential 
phone follow -up), as well as phone contact [CONTACT_855949] a spreadsheet on a 
secure VA shared drive that can only be accessed by [CONTACT_3476]. These records will be 
regularly reviewed to identify Veterans who have not sel f-initiated contact [CONTACT_855950] -up. Phone outreach will entail a maximum of three total outreach calls, of 
which a maximum of one voicemail will be left if the patient is not available. Letters notifying Veterans of potential phone outreach will be  on VA letterhead and will be signed by 
[INVESTIGATOR_124]. Forster, who is well- known to many potential recipi[INVESTIGATOR_126496] a provider within the CTAD 
clinic.  Taken together, these precautions  should be sufficient to address possible discomfort 
or suspi[INVESTIGATOR_855863] d arise from a "cold call."  
 
2.0 * Specify how subjects will be identified and how study eligibility will be determined:  
Veterans will be recruited upon outpatient treatment engagement through CTAD at VAPHS. The 
following methods will be used to identify potentially -eligible Veterans with CUD:  
1) CTAD Initial Evaluations / Intake Assessments. All patients initiating treatment through CTAD (or 
beginning a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_9694]) complete an evaluation with a CTAD provider. CTAD providers will be encouraged to inform Veterans about the study if they meet criteria for CUD. If the Veteran is agreeable, 
the CTAD psychologist  will forward his/her information to the study team for subsequent outreach. 
CTAD assessment clinic records will also be screened on a weekly basis and a mailing with study 
informatio n will be sent to potentially eligible patients. Screening will include CTAD outpatient Initial 
Evaluations, as well as intake/screening assessments for the CTAD CORE residential program and Opi[INVESTIGATOR_855864] (OSTC).  
Established CTAD patients who have been referred to CM by a provider will similarly be provided with 
information about the study. Veterans who have previously participated in Contingency Management 
treatment , or who have recently tested positive for cocaine,  may also receive information about the 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192071].  
 
2) CTAD CORE Information Session and/or Announcement During Group Psychotherapy. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_855865]. Veterans interested in the resear ch study will be provided with study 
contact [CONTACT_3031].  
 
3) Advertisements. Study brochures will be placed in the CTAD waiting room, as well as other public 
areas around the VAPHS University Drive and H. J. Heinz campuses. Flyers will also be placed in several 
community locations to target Veterans not currently  receiving care at VAPHS.   Flyers or brochures may 
also be included in materials provided to Veterans admitted to the CTAD CORE residential treatment 
program . In order to recruit healthy controls, brochures will also be deposited in public spaces within 
the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_855866] -oriented organizations and social clubs .  
 
4) Referrals from Providers. Providers in the behavioral health service line will be informed about the 
study and the CTAD CM program. These providers will be encouraged to identify patients with 
problematic cocaine use and either (1) provide these patient s with a study brochure or (2) refer these 
patients for a CTAD Initial Evaluation, whereupon they will have the opportunity to receive information 
about the study, if appropriate. We may additionally conduct outreach to other clinics expected to 
identify Veterans with active cocaine use on a semi -regular basis. For example, Veterans who are 
actively using cocaine may be identified in the course of routine services delivered through the VAPHS Cardiac Rehab program or during pre -surgical evaluations. Making providers in these clinics aware of the 
study (as well as the availability of CM more generally) may improve Veteran access to relevant treatment if active cocaine use is incidentally identified.  
5) Table with Recruitment Materials.  The study team may additionally set up a table to advertise for the 
study with approval from VAPHS or other relevant entities.  A table may be set up for recruitment purposes on VA grounds (e.g., University Drive Atrium)  or may be hosted at a community -based 
recovery -oriented event (e.g., Overdose Awareness event at Veterans Place of Washington Blvd).  
Efforts to identify and recruit potential subjects will always respect personal rights to privacy and 
confidentiality, as outlined in the HIPAA guidelines. Patients with substance disorders will be recruited 
through referrals from inpatient and outpatient Behavioral Health providers at University Drive and Heinz Campuses of VAPHS. Clinicians in relevant clinics will be educated about the study's entry criteria 
and will be instructed to provide potentially eligible participants with study contact [CONTACT_3031] . In 
addition, we request a waiver to conduct pre -screening of veteran records as this will be necessary to 
meet our recruitment goals. Specifically, [CONTACT_856019] (PI) or an authorized research assistant will identify 
potentially eligible participants by [INVESTIGATOR_21032] e-screening veteran medical records in CPRS. Specifically, Veterans 
who are initiating services through the Center for Treatment of Addictive Disorders (CTAD) or beginning 
a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_855867]. Assessment clinic records will be screened on an ongoing basis and a mailing 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192072] the 
veteran’s provider by [CONTACT_855951]/she agrees. If the patient is interested in the study, he/she may contact [CONTACT_855952] y to set up 
an appointment. In this way, the burden on the clinician will be minimal and it will not be necessary to 
store PHI related to potentially -eligible participants.  
All potentially -eligible individuals who are interested in the study will be screened for initial eligibility by 
[CONTACT_648] (or in person, if preferred by [CONTACT_102]). Preliminary eligibility for the study will be assessed 
during a scripted interview with stud y staff. Veterans interested in the study will first receive detailed 
information about the study and will be asked to consent to the screening procedure (including access 
to relevant medical records). The screening interview will include questions about d emographic (e.g., 
Veteran status, age, sex) and clinical information (e.g., substance use diagnoses, most recent cocaine 
use, history of neurological disease, etc.) relevant to eligibility. Prospective participants may also be 
asked to participate in a Min i MoCA cognitive screening at this time to assess eligibility -  otherwise, this 
screening will take place at the first study visit for those eligible on the basis of the initial screening interview.  
Veterans meeting general criteria will be invited to schedule an initial study visit involving informed consent and diagnostic interview procedures. Veterans who are ineligible will be informed that they may 
be eligible for other research opportunities and  that exclusion from the research study does not 
preclude access to CM treatment through CTAD if this treatment option is deemed appropriate by [CONTACT_855953](s). We will specifically ask for verbal consent to access electronic medical records during 
the telephone screening procedure. Patients who prefer to participate in an initial screening in person 
will provide written informed consent to participate in screening procedures only and will also be asked 
to sign a HIPAA Authorization permitting access  to relevant patient medical records. Access to records 
will be used to confirm information provided by [CONTACT_855954]. We will avoid accessing information beyond that which is immediately necessary to evaluat e 
preliminary study eligibility.    
 
3.0  
* Provide the location (or locations) of the sites where participants will be recruited:  
Participants will be recruited within the Center for the Treatment of Addictive Disorders, as well as 
public spaces within the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_416614], frequented by [CONTACT_23065]. Brochures and flyers will be posted in public areas within VAPHS (e.g., clinic waiting areas, patient lounges, etc.) and may 
additionally be placed in clinical areas such as provider offices or group treatment rooms. In addition to 
Heinz and University Drive campuses, brochures and flyers may also be placed at local CBOCs, Vet 
Centers,  and Vet Court / Veterans Justice Outreach locations, as well as community treatment locations 
(specifically, local Cocaine Anonymous meeting locations, needle exchange locations, Resolve Crisis 
Services, and community -based methadone clinics), community -based organizations or resources 
specifically targeting Veterans who may be in need of substance use treatment services (specifically, offices of Veterans Services at local universities, Soldier On, Veterans Leadership Program of Western 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Pennsylvania), and local homeless shelters/half- way houses/transitional housing facilities (e.g., Light of 
Life, Shepherd's Heart, Recovery House, etc.) . 
   
4.0 Please include information regarding any advertisements (print, TV, radio, etc) that will be used to 
recruit subjects including a general description of where this information will be posted:  
Brochure flip cards and flyers have been prepared in concert with the Office of Public Affairs and are 
included as attachments below. Brochures and flyers will be posted in public areas within VAPHS (e.g., 
clinic waiting areas, patient lounges, etc.) and m ay additionally be placed in clinical areas such as 
provider offices or group treatment rooms. In addition to Heinz and University Drive campuses, 
brochures and flyers may also be placed at local CBOCs and Vet Centers, as well as community treatment locati ons (specifically, local Cocaine Anonymous meeting locations, needle exchange 
locations, community -based methadone clinics, and the Office of Veterans Services at the University of

* Is the request only for Screening/Recruitment purposes?  
  Yes No 
If yes, please describe your screening/recruitment method:  
Waiver for Telephone Screening Potential participants will self- initiate contact [CONTACT_855956] 
a provider, study advertisement, or mailing and will be asked to engage in a screening process. We 
anticipate that the majority of patients will par ticipate in this screening process by [CONTACT_756]. We will 
specifically ask for verbal consent to access records in CPRS during the telephone screening procedure. 
Access to records will be used to confirm key information provided by [CONTACT_855957] -  namely, mental health and general medical diagnoses listed in the individual's CPRS 
Problems List. We may also check active consults and/or recent progress notes for evidence of referral to the Contingency Management program. As the Problems List may not always reflect current diagnoses, it may also be necessary to access other recent records in order to confirm information provided by [CONTACT_162908] -eligible participants. We will avoid accessing information beyond that which is 
immediat ely necessary to evaluate preliminary study eligibility. We will only access information beyond 
that which is immediately necessary to evaluate preliminary study eligibility (e.g. progress notes and laboratory results tracking progress in CM) following pro vision of written HIPAA authorization at the 
initial study visit. Potential participants will be asked to verbally provide identifiable information which 
may be necessary to access CPRS records (e.g., name, last 4 of SSN) and/or establish future contact 
(preferred phone number). Such information will not be acquired from patient medical records directly. 
Minimal identifiable information will be maintained in a secure location for scheduling purposes.  
Waiver for Pre -Screening Records  
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192079]. Forster (PI) or an 
authorized research assistant will identify potentially eligible participants by [CONTACT_094] -screening veteran 
medical records in CPRS. Veterans who are sche duled for an Initial Evaluation appointment through the 
Center for Treatment of Addictive Disorders (CTAD) be screened with respect to basic eligibility criteria, 
either before or after the time of their Initial Evaluation appointment. Veterans who have previously participated in Contingency Management and may therefore have interest/need to re- engage with this 
type of treatment may also be identified for pre -screening. Individuals who have recently tested positive 
for cocaine (e.g., within the past 3 months) may also potentially benefit from this type of treatment and may additionally be identified for pre -screening.   When a potentially -eligible veteran is identified, [CONTACT_856025] or an authorized research assistant will either (1) send out a mailing with s tudy information 
(letter and brochure) directly to the patient  if known to PI  (e.g., if no further upcoming clinical 
encounters have been scheduled) or (2) contact [CONTACT_855958]’s provider by [CONTACT_855959]. If the 
clinician agre es, [CONTACT_856019] (or an authorized research assistant) will provide study information (i.e., 
letter and brochure) to the clinician for distribution to the patient during an upcomin g clinical contact. If 
the patient is interested in the study, he/she may contact [CONTACT_855960]. In this way, the burden on the clinician will be minimal and it will not be necessary to store PHI related to potenti ally-eligible participants.  
Waiver for Initial Study Visit When Conducted Remotely  
We are requesting to extend our waiver of HIPAA for telephone- based screening to the initial Consent 
and Screening appointment for the study in order to offer the option that this appointment be 
conducted remotely.  
We will specifically ask for verbal consent to access records in CPRS during the remote study visit. Such 
access will be necessary to confirm information provided by [CONTACT_92524], document the research visit, 
schedule the first in -person visit, and facilita te coordination with other providers as needed. The 
participant will subsequently be asked to provide his/her written HIPAA authorization at the first in -
person initial study visit as part of the process for obtaining written informed consent to participat e in 
the study.  
If no, the request is for the full study (e.g. retrospective chart reviews and certain observational studies)  
Please describe the types of records and/or databases to be accessed:  
We will review patient data in CPRS, as needed, to determine patient eligibility. We will begin by 
[CONTACT_855961], if applicable, the recent CTAD Initial Evaluation report for the Veteran. 
It may also be necessary to review patient medications, recent DAU lab reports, psychiatric and medical reports, C&P reports, and clinical progress reports in some cases. In such cases, we will specifically target 
information in the record that may be necessary to determining eligibility and may specifically conduct a 
text- based search (e.g., for terms like "TBI" or "Traumatic Brain Injury") in order to check the patient's 
medical record against self -reported information provided during the screening interview. It may 
additionally be necessary to view the Veteran's upcoming appointments for scheduling purposes and/or 
enter study -related documentation into the chart.

Telephone Screening:  
In the current study, potential participants will be asked to self- initiate contact [CONTACT_855967]. We do not have sufficient resources (e.g., funding, 
personnel, etc.) to conduct an in -perso n screening session with each individual who expresses interest in 
the study. Potential participants will be asked to verbally report information necessary to evaluate eligibility during the telephone screening. However, it is necessary to confirm this information in the 
electronic medical record in order to ensure that it is accurate. For example, potential participants may 
be unaware of diagnoses that would preclude study participation. If a rule -out is identified at the time of 
the initial study visit (r ather than during the phone screening), this may present a significant 
inconvenience to the potential participant, who would have set aside time for the study visit and may 
have travelled a considerable distance to attend. Limiting the occurrence of these situations is thus in 
the best interest of both potential study participants and the research team. We will ask potential participants for verbal permission to access CPRS records in order to confirm information provided

refrain from accessing their records.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Pre-Screening Records  
In order to ensure that all patients who might be appropriate for the evidence -based treatment offered 
through this study are made aware of this treatment option/research study, we are requesting to pre-
screen specific Veterans' medical records in order that they can be provided with study information. This 
is one element of a multi- pronged recruitment approach that was determined to be necessary in order 
to achieve the required sample size for the current study on the basis of recruitment feasibility 
information acqui red through our earlier pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080] (Pro1787).  
Due to the nature of the study, establishing contact [CONTACT_10782] a potential participant's provider is 
preferable for several reasons. As described in Section 6.2 (Vulnerable Populations) engaging providers 
in the recruitment process will help us to identify appropriate participants and ensure that they can be recruited into the study without undue influence or coercion. Our target population is also unlikely to 
respond to study advertisements, such as flyers or newspaper ads, making provider referrals absolute ly 
critical. Without enlisting the support of providers in the recruitment process, it will not be possible to 
meet our recruitment aims. Providers who have contact [CONTACT_855968]. A waiver of HIPAA for the purpose of pre -screening records is thus necessary.  
Finally, we would like to offer the option to participate in our initial Consent and Screening visit through 
a remote modality such as telephone or video call. This will enable us to ensure that only those Veterans who are fully eligible to participate in the protocol are asked to attend an in -person study visit. While we 
will also take precautions to protect our participants and staff during in -person appointments to occur 
during COVID -19, it is preferable to conduct research activities remotely if and whe never possible.   
6.0  * Describe why the proposed study cannot be done without the specified identifiable information: 
Discuss reasons why it would not be possible to conduct the research without the identifiable 
information being collected.  
The Waiver of HIPAA is requested in order to pre- screen and screen veterans for potential study 
eligibility and, when necessary, conduct the initial Consent and Screening visit. Identifiers are thus necessary to ensure that the appropriate individual's rec ords are accessed for review.

1.0  
* The proposed study poses minimal risk to the subjects because (outline the subject’s involvement in 
the project and why the study poses minimal risk):  
Waiver for Pre -Screening Records  
We also request a waiver to conduct pre- screening of veteran records. Specifically, [CONTACT_856019] (PI) or an 
authorized research assistant will identify potentially eligible participants by [CONTACT_094] -screening veteran 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 medical records in CPRS. Veterans who are scheduled for an Initial Evaluation or other Intake/Screening 
assessment appointment through the Center for Treatment of Addictive Disorders (CTAD) be screened 
with respect to basic eligibility criteria, either before or after the time of their assessment appointment. 
When a potentially -eligible veteran is identified, [CONTACT_856019] or an authorized research assistant will 
either (1) send out a mailing with study information (letter and brochure) directly to the patien t (e.g., if 
no further upcoming clinical encounters have been scheduled) or (2) contact [CONTACT_855958]’s provider by 
[CONTACT_855969]. If the clinician agrees, [CONTACT_856019] (or an authorized research assistant) will provide study 
information (i.e., letter and brochure) to the clinician or other CTAD representative for distribution to the patient during an upcoming clinical contact. If the patient is intereste d in the study, he/she may 
contact [CONTACT_855970]. In this way, the burden on the clinician 
will be minimal and it will not be necessary to store PHI related to potentially -eligible participants.  
2.0  
* The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects because:  
Pre-screening activities will be conducted to identify Veterans who might benefit from treatment 
offered through the study because these Veterans may not otherwise be made aware of this treatment 
option. Veterans will always have the right to decline treat ment and/or research participation. In 
addition, Veterans may be able to receive CM treatment even if they choose not to participate. In this way, the primary consequence of the proposed pre -screening process will be to make Veterans aware of 
an empi[INVESTIGATOR_60519] y-supported treatment option that may be added to their standard outpatient substance 
use treatment programming to better support cocaine abstinence. If clinically appropriate, Veterans 
may engage with this treatment option either in the context of the cur rent study or outside the context 
of the current study, if they decline research participation.  
  
3.0  
* The research could not reasonably be carried out without the waiver because:  
Based on our earlier pi[INVESTIGATOR_16080] (Pro1787), we have determined that it will be necessary to add pre -
screening to our recruitment plan in order to meet monthly recruitment goals. We estimate that it will be necessary to recruit approximately [ADDRESS_1192081] also made changes to our eligibility criteria to improve the 
feasibility of our recruitment plan; however, prescreening will also be necessary in order to ensure that 
potent ially-eligible individuals are more reliably provided with study information.  
   
4.0 * The research could not practicably be carried out without using identifiable private information or 
identifiable biospecimens because:  
Access to identifiable information will be necessary to track participant progress through the study 
protocol and private information derived from participant medical records (i.e., urine drug test results) represents a key outcome variable for the current  study. In addition, delivery of Prize -Based 
Contingency Management (CM) requires that supervised urine specimens be collected prior to each 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192082] specimen is tested at point- of-care during CM sessions and correctly documented in patient 
medical records following confirmatory processing by [CONTACT_553552] -site lab.   
5.0  
* When appropriate, subjects will be provided with the following additional pertinent information after participation (if you have no plans to provide additional information to subjects please provide justification):  
Individuals who are prescreened will be provided with information about the study including contact [CONTACT_91514]. If these individuals contact [CONTACT_855971], they will be provided with additional pe rtinent information about the study during the 
screening process (see Screening Script).

A Waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent is requested for the telephone screening procedure 
and initial Consent and Screening appointment only. Eligible participants will be asked to provide written informed consent during their first in -person study visit. During the screening procedures conducted by 
[CONTACT_99444], potentially eligible participants will be asked to answer questions necessary to evaluate study eligibility. They will be informed that they are not required to answer any questions t hey 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192084] in order to confirm eligibility. Screening data will be 
maintained in a secured location for eligible  participants. Data from ineligible participants, as well as 
those who do not subsequently provide written informed consent, will also be maintained in a secured 
location. In lieu of written consent at the time of the remotely conducted Consent and Screeni ng visit, 
when applicable, the investigator will send a written consent form by [CONTACT_2319]. Participants who are 
determined through remote screening to be eligible and willing to enroll in the study will bring their 
signed consent form to the baseline appointmen t (the first in -person encounter) or will return the 
signed form by [CONTACT_2319]. If the signed form has not been received by [CONTACT_855972] -person visit 
(either by [CONTACT_855973]), the participant will be asked to sign a new copy 
the consent form before any in -person research procedures commence. In this way, written informed 
consent will be documented by/at the time of the first in -person study visit.  
2.0 *  The research involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required outside of the 
research context. Research procedures include:  
1.) Potentially eligible participants will be asked to listen to information about the study.  
2.) Potentially eligible participants will be asked to consent to study personnel accessing their medical 
record in order to evaluate eligibility. They will have the option to decline.  
3.) Potentially eligible participants will be asked to answer a series of questions in order to determine 
eligibility to participate in the study. Questions will focus on health and substance use history, as well as 
basic demographic data. They will have t he option to decline to answer any question they do not wish 
to. 
4.) Eligible participants will be asked to provide contact [CONTACT_855974] a study visit if they are interested in participating.  
5.) Participants may also be asked to answer questions in the context of interview, cognitive screener, and/or self- report measures.   
3.0 * Explain how whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent 
information (e.g. an information sheet):  
Participants will provide written consent and will be provided with a copy of the signed study consent 
form, upon presentation at the first in -person study visit.

3.0 * Describe how, where, when, and by [CONTACT_216888]:  
The consent document(s) will be thoroughly and extensively reviewed with participants and we will 
allow sufficient time to make an informed, voluntary decision. For those adults who wish to involve a family member or friend in the consent process, we will arrange to do so. We will make it clear that the 
Veteran's decision to participate or not will have no effect on their treatment or relationship with the VA 
Healthcare System.  
For the majority of participants, an initial eligibility screening will be conducted by [CONTACT_855975]. (A Waiver of Documentation of Informed Consent has 
been requested to cover telephone screening procedur es). However, it is possible that interested 
patients may also prefer to participate in the initial eligibility screening in person and, in such cases, a separate Screening Consent will be used to document written consent for initial screening procedures 
only and will also include HIPAA authorization . This document covers all information conveyed through 
the telephone screening script and will be thoroughly and extensively reviewed with all individuals who 
participate in in person eligibility screening. In  person eligibility screening procedures will be conducted 
in a private interview room or office at the Research Office Building (Building 30) or a private office at 
Building 29.  
Interested participants who are eligible on the basis of initial eligibility screening (either by [CONTACT_48052]) will be scheduled for a separate appointment with a member of the research team, during 
which the informed consent document for the full p rotocol will be extensively reviewed for 
comprehension and witnessed oral and written consent to participate will be obtained. Potential risks 
and benefits from this research will be reviewed. This appointment will typi[INVESTIGATOR_855868] a 
private inter view room or office at the Research Office Building (Building 30) or a private office at 
Building 29. However, it is also possible that this appointment will conducted remotely if judged to be in 
the best interest of the Veteran. In such cases, written consent will then be obtained at the time of the 
first in -person visit for those who are eligible to continue on to baseline assessment and randomization. 
Participants will be provided with a copy of their signed consent form at that time.  
 
Participants may be asked to consent to optional activity and heartrate monitoring (i.e., Goldstein 
Substudy 2) after they have been assigned to one of the two Contingency Management treatment conditions.

Dacima Clinical Suite will be used for database management, participant tracking, and randomization. 
Dacima Clinical Suite is a web -based Electronic Data Capture (EDC) software that allows setup and 
configuration of research study databases. The Dacima Clinical Suite has been approved for the intended 
use in the Technical Reference Manual 
(https://www.oit.va.gov/Services/TRM/ToolPage.aspx?tid=9433&tab=2) and has also been reviewed and approved for the intended use by [CONTACT_855982] O fficers.  
 
The software is designed to be very flexible so it can be used for different types of study designs 
including: Randomized Clinical Trial, Observational studies (Cohort, Case -Control, Cross -sectional), 
patient registries, web surveys, electronic Patient Report Outcomes (ePRO), Patient diaries and 
administrative databases. Dacima uses a SQL Server database  (backend) to store meta data and study 
data, and a web interface (front end) that was developed with Microsoft .Net (C#), html, and Java Script. 
Wireless transmission is not allowed. Secure SSL connection ensures that all data sent between the browsers an d the web servers is encrypted based on the SSL protocol. Only the data entered by [CONTACT_855983].  
 The software is housed on a virtual server provided and maintained by [CONTACT_855984][INVESTIGATOR_108710], Heinz Campus, Building 32, Room BA120. The software is compliant with FDA 21 CFR Part 11 requirements and includes a complete and comprehen sive audit trail. It requires use of SSL/TLS 
certificates, and allows critical and routine OS and system security patches per VA requirements.  
 
IRBNet #[ADDRESS_1192090], and the 
software has an auto logoff/lock program. The DACIMA software program will be accessed directly and 
the data will be stored on the VAPHS server. The data are backed up nightly in accordance with VAPHS 
protocol. Installation or updates to the software program require IT administrator privileges.  
 
Deidentified electronic data from EEG recording sessions may additionally be backed -up (i.e., archived) 
using unencrypted CD/DVD storage which will be maintained inside a locked filing cabinet in a locked 
office location (GA -136) or in a cubicle on a secure floor of Building 30 (Cubicle 1 -12 or Office 1A -130).  
 
Examples of Dacima forms used for data entry are included under Section 15 (Miscellaneous Documents). It is noted that study personnel will enter all data into Dacima and that participants will not 
directly interact with Dacima in any way.  
 
Additional Information:  
 
A VAPHS encrypted laptop may be used in the acquisition of behavioral and/or EEG data in the current 
study. While the intention is not to permanently store these data on the encrypted laptop, they may be maintained there prior to transfer to the designated  VA Network drive for storage. We additionally 
anticipate that machines used for acquisition of behavioral and EEG data may be disconnected from the 
VA network (i.e., not connected to the internet) in order to ensure accurate timing of stimuli in 
behavioral paradigms and event markers in EEG data acquisitions. Consequently, we may use a VA encrypted thumb drive or an encrypted CD/DVD to transfer data to the VA Network Drive. Once again, 
the intention will not be to permanently store these data on encrypted portable media. Files will be 
deleted and/or CD/DVD discs will be destroyed (using approved methods) following confirmation that 
files have been successfully transferred and that a back -up version of raw EEG data files has been 
successfully created. Import antly, these behavioral and EEG data files will not include any direct 
personal identifiers. As already noted, raw EEG data files will be backed up using CD/DVDs (either 
encrypted or unencrypted) and will be maintained in a locked filing cabinet on a secure floor of Building 
30.

If yes, please describe the application and what it is being used for:  
Dacima Clinical Suite is a web -based Electronic Data Capture (EDC) software that allows setup and 
configuration of research study databases. The software is designed to be very flexible so it can be used 
for different types of study designs including: Rand omized Clinical Trial, Observational studies (Cohort, 
Case -Control, Cross -sectional), patient registries, web surveys, electronic Patient Report Outcomes 
(ePRO), Patient diaries and administrative databases. Dacima uses a SQL Server database (backend) to 
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 store meta data and study data, and a web interface (front end) that was developed with Microsoft .Net 
(C#), html, and Java Script. Wireless transmission is not allowed. Secure SSL connection ensures that all 
data sent between the browsers and the web serv ers is encrypted based on the SSL protocol. Only the 
data entered by [CONTACT_855985].  
The software is housed on a virtual server provided and maintained by [CONTACT_855984][INVESTIGATOR_268341], Heinz Campus, Building 32, Room BA120. The software is compliant with FDA 21 CFR 
Part 11 requirements and includes a complete and comprehen sive audit trail. It requires use of SSL/TLS 
certificates, and allows critical and routine OS and system security patches per VA requirements.  
Use of the DACIMA software program requires user authentication with a strong user password, and the 
software has an auto logoff/lock program. The DACIMA software program will be access directly and the data will be stored on the VAPHS server. The data are  backed up nightly in accordance with VAPHS 
protocol. Installation or updates to the software program require IT administrator privileges.

Participant Payments  
1.0 * Please explain how the proposed payments are reasonable and commensurate with the expected 
contributions of the subject:  
Payment for study visits will help to cover the cost of time and effort by [CONTACT_19288].  
A payment of $5 -10 will be provided for short visits related to the study (e.g., Weekly and Monthly 
Check -in visits), lasting [ADDRESS_1192093] provide an adequate payment to ensure that this is an option for all individuals involved in the 
study. Due to the necessity of longitudinal data collection, we would also like to incentivize study comp letion by [CONTACT_14659] a $[ADDRESS_1192094]. 
Longer study appointments (Screening , Baseline Assessment, and Follow -Up assessment) will take 2.5 -4 
hours to complete and therefore warrant increased compen sation for time spent completing study 
procedures. We will therefore provide $20 for completion of the Screening visit and $35 for completion of Baseline and Follow -Up Assessments.  
We will also provide performance based bonus payments of $[ADDRESS_1192095]  been determined such that they are 
similar to prizes routinely won in the context of Contingency Management.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 Participants in Substudy 2 will additionally be eligible to receive a payment of $[ADDRESS_1192096] two weeks of treatment.   
2.0 * Please provide information on how the subject payments are fair and appropriate, and that they 
do not constitute (or appear to constitute) undue pressure or influence on the prospective research 
subjects to volunteer for, or to continue to participate in, the research study. In additional the payments 
do not constitute (or appear to constitute) coercion to participate in, or continue to participate in, the 
research study:  
A performance -based bonus of $12 -25 will be provided based performance during our modified 
monetary incentive delay task and/or our personalized delay discounting task. The amount and/or timing of this bonus will be determined on the basis of participant responses during computerized 
cognitive tasks. In effect, we do not anticipate that this payment will directly bear on any participant's 
decision to participate as the amount and timing of the payment will be unknown at the time of 
informed consent. Participants will be informed that they will receive this payment (even if provided at some delay after the assessment) regardless of continued participation in the study.  
A payment of $40 is also considered to be a fair and appropriate for remote monitoring activities. Remote monitoring will require low effort on the part of the participant but will represent a daily inconvenience over a two week period.   
3.0 * Specify the amount, form of payment and the specific disbursement schedule of payments:  
For participating in the study explanation/consent review session and pre -assessment screening and 
testing procedures (Screening Visit), participants will be authorized for $20 (via EFT) to compensate them for time and effort. After the enrollment and assessment procedures (Baseline Assessment), participants will be authorized for an additional $35 (via EFT) to compensate them for time and effort during that session. After each weekly check -in visit during the 12 Week Treatment Interval, participants 
will b e authorized for an additional $5 to compensate them for the time and effort spent on the study. 
Participants will generally be asked to complete a Follow -Up Assessment at the 12 week timepoint and 
will receive a payment of $[ADDRESS_1192097] Check -in Visit occurs instead, 
the participant will be compensated $5. Participants assigned to VoucherPBCM or TangiblePBCM 
conditions will addition ally be asked to participate in monthly check -in visits for 6 months after 
treatment and will receive $10 for each of these assessments. All participants will be eligible for a 
completion bonus of $[ADDRESS_1192098] (i.e., [ADDRESS_1192099] -Treatment Check -In 
for CM participants). In addition to regular study payments, participants will also receive a performance -
based bonus from tasks completed at Baseline and Follow -up Sessions. The amount and/or timing of this 
bonus payment will be de termined by [CONTACT_855988]. Performance -based bonuses are frequently 
used to improve motivation and naturalistic responses in human subjects research involving reward 
processing. The average performance -based bonus payment will be $20 (range = $12 -25) at  both 
Baseline and Follow -Up. Taken together, full participation in the study will result in an average total 
payment of $260 over 9 months for CM -assigned Veterans (range: $250 -$270).  
Participants in Substudy 2 will receive a single $[ADDRESS_1192100] at the conclusion of 
the two week monitoring period.  
IRBNet #1617313 Protocol Version 1.5 For Healthy Controls:  
For participating in the screening visit (informed consent, cognitive screening and interviews, 
questionnaires, activity monitoring procedures), baseline assessment (breathalyzer, urine and/or oral 
saliva drug screens, cognitive -behavioral tasks, EEG proce dures) and the follow -up visit, participants will 
be authorized $20 for the screening visit, $50 -60 for the Baseline assessment, $50 -60 for the Follow -up 
assessment, and $40 for participation in activity monitoring . Taken together, full participation in th e 
study will result in a total payment of $160 -$180.  
4.0 * Are the subjects being paid employees?  
yes  
If yes, please describe how it will be in accordance with the SOP:  
It is possible that a participant in the study may also be a paid VA employee. In such cases the 
participant will be informed that he or she may not participate in any study activities for which he/she 
may be compensated during his/her VA tour of duty.

EEG Recording   
Common Risks:  
There are no common risks associated with this procedure.   
Infrequent Risks:  
Infrequent Risks:  
1. On rare occasions, participants may experience slight itchiness due to the conductive gel used at 
electrode sensor sites. This reaction occurs in less than 1% of people. Participants will be instructed to let study personnel know if they experience disc omfort during the EEG procedure and may choose to 
stop the EEG procedure at any time.  
2. On rare occasions (~5% of the time), temporary redness of skin is noted following an EEG in locations 
where sensors were placed. Redness of skin will generally resolve within a few minutes without 
discomfort.  
3. On rare occasions (~5% of the time), the placement of the sensors on the skin will cause a very small 
portion of the skin, less than 1 centimeter, to swell slightly; this might appear like a very small welt. This 
is caused by [CONTACT_855993] u nder sensors and goes away soon after the sensors are 
removed.

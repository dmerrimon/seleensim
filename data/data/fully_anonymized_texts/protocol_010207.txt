Sub-study has been included to allow 
subjects to opt to receive a booster dose of 
Moderna mRNA -1723 vaccine ≥5 months 
after completing the primary COVID -19 
vaccination series and >35 days before the 
end of the main study  (ie, until study day 
345 for subjects in arms 1, 2, 3, 6a, 6c, 7 and

Five additional study arms have been 
included:  
• Two study arms, with  a third concurrent 
control arm, will simulate vaccination up 
through approximately 6 months 
following REGN10933+REGN10987 
administration.  
• One study arm, in addition to a 
concurrent control arm, will evaluate 
endogenous immune response to 
vaccination when the first vaccine dose is 
followed by [CONTACT_50457]10933+REGN10987 
administration 6 days later.  
Enrollment in these arms will occur as two 
additional waves (wave [ADDRESS_783345] 4).  
 
In total, 106 additional subjects (30 per 
REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment arms, 
and 8 per  control arms) will be enrolled. The 
justification for samples size was updated 
accordingly.  To better understand the

Previously, it was specified that vaccine

once their assigned study arm was deemed 
to have generated an appropriate vaccine 
response compared to the vaccine -only arm.  
 
This statement has been  removed, and 
vaccine cards will be made available to all 
subjects upon receipt of the vaccine as per 
the current standard of care.  Based on site feedback; 
vaccine cards indicate receipt 
of the vaccine, rather than 
generation of an appropriate 
vaccine res ponse.  Synopsis: Study Design

Serology testing at baseline  (central 
laboratory) will be used to exclude 
seropositive patients  from the per -protocol 
set (PPS) for vaccine response analysis.  Due to limited supply of rapid 
serology test kits, local testing 
may not be operationally 
feasible.  Section  7.2.2  Exclusion

Tolerability of Moderna mRNA -1273 Vaccine Administered with Casirivimab+Imdevimab in Healthy 
Adult Volunteers  
Site 
Locations  The study will be conducted in approximately 5 sites in the [LOCATION_002].  
Principal 
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_593698]  • To evaluate the extent of effect, if any, of REGN10933+REGN10987 administration on vaccine -
induced neutralizing antibody responses to SARS -CoV -2 by [CONTACT_593719] -1273  
• To evaluate the time interval required between REGN10933+REGN10987 administration and 
Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_783358] on vaccine -induced 
neutralizing antibody responses to SARS -CoV -2 
Secondary  • To quantify the alteration of antigen specificity of vaccine -induced SARS -CoV -2 antibody 
responses when administered with different dose regimens of REGN10933+REGN10987  
• To evaluate the safety and tolerability of REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273 
vaccine when administered in close succe ssion  
• To assess the concentrations of REGN10933 and REGN10987 in serum over time in subjects who 
receive REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine  
• To evaluate the immunogenicity of REGN10933  and REGN10987 over time  
Study 
Design  The study consists of 3 periods: a screening/baseline period, a vaccine response assessment period, 
and a follow -up period.  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility during the screening/baseline period , which may occur up to 
[ADDRESS_783359] SARS -CoV -2 infection by [CONTACT_963] -PCR and serology tests.  
During this period, subjects will also be assigned to one of four different enrollment waves.  
On day 1, subjects will be randomized to a study arm (1 of 12) within their assigned enrollment wave. 
Subjects randomized to study arms 1 through 5 or 7 through 9 will receive an IV infusion or SC 
injection of the study drug (REGN10933+REGN10987) on day 1 or day 7. Subjects in arms 6a to 6d 
(the control arms) will not receive any study drug. The first dose of the vaccine will be administered 
on day [ADDRESS_783360] Sheet.  
The vaccine response assessment period  represents the time period of the primary analysis. For study 
arms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6a, and 6c, this period includes up to s tudy day 71; for study arms 4, 5, 9, 6b, and 
6d, the period includes up to day 57. Following this assessment period, subjects will enter a follow -up 
period  lasting up to [ADDRESS_783361] visits for drug concentration, immunogenicity, 
and exploratory analyses, and will be monitored for AEs (including AESIs) during in -person visits. 
For subjects in study arms 4 and 5 (receiving the study drug and vaccine o n the same day), a phone 
call will be made within 24 hours following study drug and vaccine administration on day 1 for AE 
collection.

Vaccine booster sub -study : All subjects will be offered an optional booster vaccination dose ≥5 
months after completing the primary COVID -19 vaccination series and >35 days (ie, until study day 
345 for subjects in arms 1, 2, 3, 6a, 6c, 7 and 8 and until study day 331 for subjects in arms 4, 5, 6b, 
6d and 9)  before the end of the main study. Blood samples for possible analysis will be collected pre - 
and post -booster administration.   
Study 
Duration  The duration of the study is approximately [ADDRESS_783363] to follow -up (ie, the study subject can no longe r be contact[CONTACT_19379]).  
Population   
Sample Size  Up to approximately [ADDRESS_783364] of healthy adult volunteers over 18 years of age who are negative 
at screening for both SARS -CoV -2 infection and endogenous anti -SARS -CoV -2 antibodies. A 
complete listing of eligibility criteria is provided in the main text.  
Every effort should made to enroll older subjects, such that 30% to 50% of subjects enrolled at each  
site are ≥65 years of age. Efforts should also be made to enroll subjects representative of the 
demographics (eg, race and ethnic distribution) of those at risk for COVID -[ADDRESS_783365]. Every effort should be made by [CONTACT_593720] (<65 years and ≥65 years) within each of the enrollment waves.  
Randomization.  At baseline (day 1), subjects  will be randomized to the corresponding study arms in 
each wave. Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<65 years versus ≥65 years).

Statistical 
Plan   
Statistical 
Hypothesis  No statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study. Analyses of immunogenicity, safety, 
tolerability, and other data will be descriptive and exploratory in nature.  
Justification 
of Sample 
Size This study plans to enroll up to approximately 286 subjects, in order to achieve a target enrollment of 
up to approximately 30 subjects per Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm 
and [ADDRESS_783375] for the primary endpoint, as well as 
allow for an assessment of the safety and tolerability of the Moderna mR NA-1273 vaccine when 
administered with REGN10933+REGN10987.  
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_783376] deviation for the study is 0.30 log. This assumption is based on 
phase 1 data for the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine, taking the weighted average (ie, adjusting for 
sample sizes) across all doses (25,100, and 250 μg) and age groups (18 to 55, 56 to 70, and ≥71 years) 
for the neutralizing antibody titer ID50 endpoint at day 57 (Anderson, 2020) (Jackson, 2020). With a 
log-scale standard deviation of 0.30 for the primary en dpoint and a sample size of 30 and 46 subjects 
per arm, the half -width of the 95% within -group confidence interval (CI) [ie, the minimal detectable 
difference] in this study is 0.11 log and 0.09 log respectively. For between -group comparisons, the 
half-width of the 95% between -group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and 
REGN10987) arms is 0.15 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between -group CI in this study 
for any individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and the t otal 
Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects is 0.14 log.  
The analysis set that will be used for assessment of vaccine response allows for subjects to be excluded 
from analysis if certain confounding criteria are met (see Section 11.3.1). If 50% of subjects are 
excluded from analysis (ie, 15 subjects are analyzed per individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + 
(REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and 23 total Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects are analyzed), 
the half -width of the 95% between -group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + (R EGN10933 and 
REGN10987) arms is 0.22 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between -group CI for any 
individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and Moderna mRNA -1273 
alone subjects is 0.20 log. Under this scenario, the minimal detec table difference still remains 
substantially smaller than the decrease in neutralization titers observed in a separate study of sera from 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_593699] -1273 vaccine who were infected with South African variants (eg, 
B.1.351 v1, v2, and v3)  (Garcia -Beltran, 2021)  
Statistical 
Analysis  Analysis of Primary Vaccine Response Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the 50% inhibitory dilution (ID 50) titers of vaccine -induced neutralizing 
antibodies to SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_783377] dose of the vaccine. The 
56-day time point corresponds to study day 71 for study arms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6a, and 6c, and study day 
57 for study arms 4, 5, 9, 6b, and 6d.  
An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group as a fixed effect  and age as a 
covariate will be fit to the data as the primary analysis.  
The least squares mean estimates for the endpoint will be presented for each treatment group, as well 
as for the differences between treatment groups. Associated 95% CIs will also be  reported for each 
treatment group and for between -group comparisons.  
Data will be originally fitted in the log scale, and final outputs will be reported in geometric means 
and differences of the geometric means.  
Accompanying descriptive analyses will al so be provided. The analyses will be conducted based on 
the observed data with no imputation for missing data. Values below the limit of quantification (LOQ) 
will be set to half of LOQ.  
Analysis of Secondary Vaccine Response Endpoints  
The secondary endpoi nts will be analyzed in a similar manner as described for the primary endpoint.  
For these secondary endpoints, the individual time points for assessments include all post -vaccine 
scheduled timepoints during the Vaccine Response Assessment Period as descri bed in the Schedule of 
Events.  
Accompanying descriptive analyses for each endpoint at each individual time points will also be 
provided.  
Interim 
Analyses  
 Data will be reviewed periodically to provide an understanding of vaccine response in different study 
arms. Formal interim analysis may be conducted.  
Timing of 
Primary  
and Final 
Analyses  The primary vaccine response analysis will be conducted as a first -step analysis after all subjects have 
finished the primary endpoint visit (ie, [ADDRESS_783378] dose of the vaccine), in order to estimate 
the levels of neutralizing antibodies in ea ch study arm. This analysis represents the final analysis of 
the primary endpoint and is not considered an interim analysis. The SAP will be issued prior to this 
analysis.  
After all subjects finish 1 -year of follow -up, a final study analysis will be condu cted.

 CONFIDENTIAL  1. INTRODUCTION  
Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV -2) is a novel RNA betacoronavirus, 
initially identified in patients experiencing atypi[INVESTIGATOR_593700], China (Zhu,  2020) 
and later identified as the causative pathogen of coronavirus dis ease 2019 (COVID -19) 
(WHO,  2020 ). 
Coronaviruses consist of an RNA genome packaged in nucleocapsid (N) protein. The resulting 
capsid is surrounded by [CONTACT_593721] (M) protein and envelope (E) 
protein, which are involved in virus assembly, and spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (S) protein, which mediates entry into 
host cells. The S protein is essential for virus infectivity and is the main target of the humoral 
immune respon se, as demonstrated by [CONTACT_593722] -19 patients 
(Long,  2020 ). By [CONTACT_593723] -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), 
the S protein facilitates membrane fusion and entry of the virus into susceptible cells 
(Hoffmann,  2020 ). The S protein is itself composed of 2 functional subunits: the S1 subunit, which 
contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) responsible for binding to ACE2 on host cells, and 
the S2 subunit, which mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (Walls, 2020 ).  
Over 200 COVID -19 vaccines are currently in preclinical or clinical development, and many of 
these employ mechanisms involving S protein neutralization (WHO, 2021 ). On 11 Dec 2020, the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for a 
COVID -19 vaccine ([COMPANY_007] -BioNTech COVID‑19 Vaccine) in individuals ≥16 years old 
(FDA,  2020b ). Similar authorizations were subsequently issued for mRNA -1273 (18 Dec 2020), 
a COVID -19 vaccin e developed by [CONTACT_289647], as well as a vaccine developed by [CONTACT_593724] (27 Feb 2021), both in individuals ≥18 years old (Baden, 2020 ). On [ADDRESS_783379] an equivalent level of immunocompromise (FDA, 2022 ). Each of these 
vaccines elicit robust, dose -dependent neutralizing and other polyclonal antibodies against the S 
protein RBD (Polack, 2020 ) (Sadoff, 2021 ) (Jackson, 2020 ), and in phase [ADDRESS_783380] shown over 
90% ([COMPANY_007] -BioNTech, Moderna) and over 60% (Janssen) efficacy in preventing symptomatic 
COVID -19 illness compared with placebo (Baden, 2020 ) (Polack, 2020 ) (Sadoff, 2021 ).  
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron) has developed monoclonal antibodies (m Abs) 
directed against the RBD of the SARS -CoV -2 S protein. Casirivimab  (REGN10933) and 
imdevimab (REGN10987) are human, IgG1 mAbs that bind simultaneously to the RBD and block 
interaction with ACE2. As a co -administered combination therapy, REGN10933+REGN1 0987 
(casirivimab+imdevimab; also referred to by [CONTACT_593725], REGEN -COV™) is being evaluated for the treatment and prevention of SARS -CoV -2 
infection.  
REGN10933+REGN10987 exhibits potent SARS -CoV -2 neutralization  in pseudovirus assays 
using wildtype Spi[INVESTIGATOR_2531] (Baum, 2020 ), and Spi[INVESTIGATOR_593701]  
([LOCATION_006] B.1.1.7 [alpha], South Africa B.1.351 [beta], [LOCATION_004] B.1.429 [epsilon], India B.1.617.2 
[delta], and Brazil P.1 [gamma]) (REGEN -COV™ (casirivimab and imdevimab) [HCP Fact 
Sheet], 2022 ) (Weinreich , 2020 ) . The REGN10933+REGN10987 antibodies have significantly 
diminished potency and are not expected to be active against the recent Om icron variant  
(REGEN -COV™ (casirivimab and imdevimab) [HCP Fact Sheet], 2022 ).

This is a phase 2, randomized, open -label, parallel group study in healthy adult volunteers to assess 
the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine when administered 
with REGN1 0933+REGN10987. A central focus of the study will be to assess whether 
REGN10933+REGN10987 interferes with the ability of the Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_783383] ic understanding of any observed alteration of vaccine -induced humoral and cellular 
immune responses to various S protein epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. The study is designed to replicate hypothetical 
clinical scenarios in which mAbs may be administered in conjunction with a C OVID -19 vaccine, 
as well as simulate different time intervals between mAb and vaccine administration (using 
decreasing mAb dose concentrations as a proxy) to identify optimal dose timing in the event that 
interference with vaccine -induced immunity is obser ved. A detailed discussion of the rationale for 
the study design is provided in Section  3.2.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3. HYPOTHESES AND RATIO NALE  
3.1. Hypotheses  
The clinical hypotheses of the study are that (1) REGN10933 -REGN10987 does not alter the 
immunogenicity of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine and (2) REGN10933+REGN10987 and 
Mode rna mRNA -1273, when administered in close succession, are well tolerated.  
There is no statistical hypothesis in this descriptive study (Section  11.1). 
3.2. Rationale  
3.2.1.  Rationale for Study Design  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Objectives: Potential Alteration of Endogenous Immune Responses  
Monoclonal antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_593704]10933+REGN10987 will continue to play an 
important role in COVID -19 treatment and/or prevention, even as COVID -19 vaccination becomes 
more widespread.  There is a theoretical risk, however, that mAb treatments may a lter the vaccine -
induced immune responses, by [CONTACT_593730]. The primary objective of this study is thus to understand whether 
REGN10933+REGN10987, when administered in the sett ing of treatment or prevention of 
COVID -19, will alter the response to COVID -19 vaccines such as Moderna mRNA -1273.  
To accomplish the primary study objective, REGN10933+REGN10987 will be evaluated using 
dose levels that have either been authorized under EUA for the treatment of COVID -19 and/or for 
which clinical trial data indicate efficacy in treating or preventing COVID -19 (Section  3.2.2 ). The 
study is thus designed to mirror hypothetical clinical ‘use case’ scenarios, for which the two 
administration modalities of REGN10933+REGN10987 may be employed in close proximity to 
COVID -19 vaccination or mimic waiting for vaccination for up to 6 months after a  1200 mg dose 
of REGEN -COV.  
For the hypothetical treatment use case (ie, administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 [ADDRESS_783387] future 
infection), Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_783388] ered 14 days after intravenous 
REGN10933+REGN10987. The use of an intervening period of time is based on public health 
recommendations to avoid COVID -19 vaccination during an active SARS -CoV -2 infection. The 
14-day interval was selected to ensure adequate time for the distribution of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 from the plasma compartment into tissues.  
For the hypothetical prophylaxis use case (ie, administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 1200 
mg SC in a SARS -CoV -2-negative individual for short -term protection agains t exposure, with 
administration of COVID -19 vaccination for long -term protection), REGN10933+REGN10987 
will be administered on the same day as Moderna mRNA -1273. Simultaneous administration of 
both antibody therapy and vaccination has been used as effectiv e post -exposure prophylaxis for 
several pathogens, including rabies virus and hepatitis A virus (Manning, 2008 ) (Nelson, 2018 ). 
In addition to the above use case scenarios, the study will evaluate endogenous immune responses 
over time when 1200 mg IV of REGN10933+REGN10987 is administered [ADDRESS_783389] 
dose of Moderna mRNA -1273 (ie, study day 7). This interval was chosen t o allow adequate

 CONFIDENTIAL  production and presentation of S protein antigens following vaccination and is thus intended to 
represent a scenario in which the immune system is “primed” prior to treatment with 
REGN10933+REGN10987. This will allow for assessment of safe ty of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 administration in close temporal proximity to vaccination. In the event 
REGN10933+REGN10987 is found to interfere with the endogenous immune response to 
vaccination when given prior to or concomitantly with vaccination, this will allow assessment of 
whether, in the prophylaxis setting, vaccination prior to REGN10933+REGN10987 administration 
will allow high risk subjects to receive both long term and short term protection from vaccination 
and REGN10933+REGN10987 administration follo wed shortly thereafter.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Primary Objectives: Exploration of Time Intervals  
It is anticipated that REGN10933+REGN10987 will not alter the generation of endogenous, 
protective immune responses to Moderna  mRNA -1273 vaccination. Vaccine responses are 
polyclona l, and the presence of mAb therapeutics may not alter neutralizing Ab generation to all 
S-protein epi[INVESTIGATOR_322]. Additionally, we anticipate that presentation of peptides for T -cell priming will 
not be affected by [CONTACT_593731]. Finally, preliminary observat ions from subjects with SARS -
CoV -2 infection in treatment trials of REGN10933+REGN10987 have demonstrated intact IgG 
responses to SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_783390] -exposure prophylaxis or reinfection when receiving passive 
antibody therapy for tre atment  (CDC, 2021 ).  
In this study,  several additional doses levels below 1200 mg will be administered at day 1 ( Figure  1 
and Table  2). Sequentially lower dose levels were chosen as a means to vary the concentration of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 that exists at the time of Moderna  mRNA -1273 vaccin ation. This 
method is intended to simulate various time intervals that could occur between administr ation of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 at 1200 mg and vaccination with Moderna  mRNA -1273 . This 
approach – altering the dose level rather than the time interval – was selected because 
REGN10933+REGN10987 concentration (and not time) is the key factor impacting the li kelihood 
of altering vaccine responses. Moreover, the approach is operationally more feasible, and (by 
[CONTACT_593732]) lowers the likelihood of 
subjects becoming exposed to SARS -CoV -2 exposure duri ng the study, which would confound 
the interpretation of results. Additional information regarding the selection of dose levels in this 
study is provided in Section  3.2.2 . 
Taken together, the primary objectives in this study  are intended to provide information that 
may guide  physicians and public health agencies  in making  evidence -based recommendations on 
the usage of the Moderna mRNA -1273 COVID -19 vacci ne in the setting of 
REGN10933+REGN10987 therapy or prevention. As COVID -19 vaccines employing S protein

 CONFIDENTIAL  neutralization as their mode of action are likely to produce comparable antibody responses and 
protective immunity (an assumption supported by [CONTACT_593733] 
(Garcia -Beltran, 2021 ) it is anticipated that the data generated  from this study can potentially be 
extrapolated to the general case of S -protein -based COVID -19 vaccines given in the setting of 
mAbs targeting the S protein RBD.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Selection and Interpretation of Primary Endpoint  
Although quantitative correlates of protective immunity against SARS -CoV -2 are not yet 
established, the presence of serum neutralizing antibodies has been shown to correlate with 
protection from viral reinfection for other respi[INVESTIGATOR_4398], including in fluenza virus 
(Verschoor, 2015 ) and respi[INVESTIGATOR_4345] (Kulkarni, 2018 ). Neutralizing antibody titers 
are accepted as a general functional biomarker of the endogenous ability to block viral infection 
of target ce lls in vivo (Jackson, 2020 ). In the absence of clear correlates of vaccine -induced 
protection against COVID -19, reduced neutralization can serve as a useful benchmark to interpret 
any observed impact of mAb thera py on the development of an immune response to Moderna 
mRNA -1273 vaccine. Accordingly, the primary objective will be assessed by [CONTACT_593734]10933+REGN10987. Whi le the threshold of SARS -CoV -2-neutralizing antibody titers 
associated with meaningful clinical efficacy in treating or preventing COVID -19 are currently 
unknown, this study is designed with a sufficient sample size to provide a minimal detectable 
differen ce of 0.15 log (refer to Section  11.2). This precision is considered adequate to meet the 
aims of this phase 2 study (ie, to both quantify the magnitude of effect for the primary endpoint 
and to allow assessment of the safety and tolerability of the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine when 
administered with REGN10933+REGN1098).  
The primary endpoint will be assessed during the vaccine response assessment pe riod, which 
includes the first [ADDRESS_783391] dose of Moderna mRNA -1273 (Section  4.1 and 
Section  6.1.1 ). SARS -CoV -2-neutralizing antibodies induced by [CONTACT_593719] -[ADDRESS_783392] vaccine dose, with titers peaking on day 36 ([ADDRESS_783393] dose and one week after the second dose of the vaccine), and remaining at peak 
levels at day 57 and day 119 (pseudovirus serum neutralizing infectious dose 50 [ID 50] titers 
between 256 to 1024) (Jackson, 2020 ) (Widge, 2021 ). Assessing the primary en dpoints after [ADDRESS_783394] of mAb 
administration on vaccine responses (Jackson, 2020 ). Additional analyses of neutralizing antibody 
titers at approximately 6 months, 9 months, and 1 year after vaccine administration will assess 
long-term/memory immune response to SARS -CoV -2 following vaccination with Moderna 
mRNA -1273.  
An open -label design was chosen for this study, as it is considered app ropriate and sufficient for 
achieving the primary objective, as well as the other pharmacodynamic objectives, of the study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [HCP Fact She et], 2022 ). The vaccine was shown to elicit robust, 
dose-dependent neutralizing titers against full -length S protein and against the S protein RBD, 
when measured using a pseudotyped lentivirus (PsVNA) assay (Jackson, 2020 ), and in a phase 3 
study of 30,420 volunteers, reduced the rates of symptomatic COVID -19 illness by [CONTACT_46431] 90% 
compared to placebo (Baden, 2020 ). The robust neutralizing titers observed in clinical studies are 
anticipated to provide an opportunity for eva luating any impact of REGN10933+REGN10987 on 
immune response to vaccine. Any alteration of neutralization that may be observed in this trial will 
require further study.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Selection of Neutralizing Titer Assay  
Serum neutralizing titers to Moderna mRNA -1273 va ccine will be assessed by a recombinant 
Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (rVSV) encoding SARS -CoV -2 S protein -based method 
(Vandergaast,  2020 ), similar to the assay reported in published reports of mRNA -1273 vaccine 
(Jackson, 2020 ) (Widge, 2021 ). The assay will be further validated with an additional anti -idioty pe 
antibody step to block interference of REGN10933+REGN10987 in the measurement of the 
endogenous response to the vaccine. The impact of REGN10933+REGN10987 neutralizing Ab 
responses to S proteins from other viral variants may also be studied, if assays b ecome available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Secondary and Exploratory Analyses of Immune Response  
It is possible that exogenous mAb treatments could skew or otherwise alter the antigen specificity 
of endogenous antibody responses elicited by [CONTACT_593719] -1273 vaccine. SARS -CoV -2 
binding antibody assessments to S -protein trimer and S1 RBD will be performed using a Meso 
Scale Diagnostics (MSD) kit that has been used to measure neutralizing antibody responses in 
Phase 3 vaccine trials with Moderna mRNA -1273. The assay will be adapted w ith an anti -idiotype 
step to block the interference of REGN10933+REGN10987 with the measurement of endogenous 
antibodies.  
In order to fully characterize the possible effects of REGN10933+REGN10987 on immune 
responses to Moderna mRNA -1273, we will evaluate  cellular immune responses. Additional 
exploratory assays may be used to measure immunoglobulin titers to specific SARS -CoV -2 
antigens (such as further epi[INVESTIGATOR_593705]) following vaccination. 
Similarly, B -cell responses follo wing vaccination could reveal subtle immunologic effects of mAb 
therapy on vaccine response. To this end, the study will explore circulating B cell response specific 
to SARS -CoV -2 S trimer protein, RBD, and other spi[INVESTIGATOR_593706].  Additional analyses of T cell 
immune  responses to Moderna mRNA -1273 in the presence of REGN10933+REGN10987 will 
also be performed and may  reveal  important  mechanistic  insights into any  observed immune 
interaction.  
Although the global emergence of variants has occurred only relati vely recently in the history of 
the pandemic, emerging data suggest that they pose a significant threat to the clinical efficacy of 
some vaccines and therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] ([COMPANY_008], 2021 ) (FDA, 2021 ). Recent evidence suggests that 
neutralizing humoral immunity induced by [CONTACT_593719] -[ADDRESS_783397] 
specific SARS -CoV -2 variants (ie, B.1.351) (Garcia -Beltran, 2021 ). In this study, exploratory 
studies may be  conducted to understand if REGN10933+REGN10987 alters the neutralization 
capacity seen with these viral variants after vaccination.

 CONFIDENTIAL  [IP_ADDRESS].  Study Population  
The population for this study includes healthy volunteers who are both seronegative and RT -PCR 
negative f or SARS -CoV -2 at screening/baseline, as this will maximize the ability to measure any 
effects of REGN10933+REGN10987 on immune responses to Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine. 
Randomization will be stratified by [CONTACT_654] (<65 years versus ≥65 years), as older individual s may be 
less likely to have robust humoral immunity following vaccination and more likely to benefit from 
mAbs in the prevention or treatment of COVID -19.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Safety and Tolerability  
REGN10933+REGN10987, when given concomitantly or in temporal proximity to M oderna 
mRNA -1273, is reasonably expected to be well -tolerated in healthy volunteers (see Section  3.1). 
Nevertheless, this study will evaluate safety and tolerability of REGN10933+REGN10987 and 
Moderna mRNA -1273, including assessment of IRR (REGN10933+REGN10987) as well as ISR 
and hypersensiti vity reactions (REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273; see 
Section  4).  
As a precautionary safety measure, a follow -up phone call will be made with in 24 hours after study 
drug and vaccine administration, for subjects receiving these concomitantly (see Section  9.2.2 ). 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Use of Enrollment Waves  
During  the screening/baseline period, subjects will be assigned by [CONTACT_593735], which are used to group study arms. The enrollment waves are staggered (eg, effort should 
be done so that study day [ADDRESS_783398] 2; 
see Figure  2). The primary intent of this staggering is to increase the number of study subjects who 
can be scheduled for  vaccination on the same day at each site, and thus avoid or minimize the 
potential for unused doses of COVID -[ADDRESS_783399] on susceptibility of mAb -mediated interference to vaccine response.  
Refer to Section  8.5 for additional information on site -managed assignment to enrollment waves 
and subsequent randomization to study arms.  
3.2.2.  Rationale for Dose Selection  
This parallel group study will utilize 12 stu dy arms, of which 8 will receive single -dose 
administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 and administration of the Moderna mRNA -1273 
COVID -19 vaccine ( Figure  1) before, after or concurrently with REGEN -COV administration. 
Study arms 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d will only receive the vaccine.  
For all study arms that include IV administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 followed by

with relevant peripheral tissues (ie, the site of a potential immune interaction).

REGN10933+REGN10987 1200 mg IV (600 mg per mAb) was selected as a potential use case 
scenario based on clinical efficacy data in treatment of COVID -19 (Section  3.3.1 ).  
The rationale for study arm 9 (administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 after the first dose of 
Modern mRNA -1723 vaccine) is provided in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] .

As outlined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS] , one of the primary objectives of this study is to identify time 
intervals between administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -1273 that 
may mitigate any observed potential alteration of vaccine efficacy, and to utilize various dose 
levels as a means of simulating these time intervals. To this end, a preliminary population 
pharmacokinetics (PopPK) model was developed based on available REGN10933 and 
REGN10987 concentration da ta from studies COV -2067 and COV -2069. The PopPK model was

time intervals following a 1200 mg IV dose (Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ).  
Table  1 provides the estimated time intervals for each of the study arms used for these anchoring 
analyses. As an example of this simulation, 300 mg IV of REGN10933+REGN10987 administered 
on day 1, followed by [CONTACT_593736] a mRNA -1723 on day 15, 
simulates a scenario in which an individual receives a single 1200 mg IV dose of 
REGN10933+REGN10987, and then begins their vaccination with Moderna mRNA -1723 
approximately 60 days later.

Subcutaneous Administration of Casirivimab+Imdevimab in Clinical Trials. In COV -2069, 
the phase [ADDRESS_783401], a single 
subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevima b (1200 mg) reduced (relative to placebo) 
symptomatic SARS -CoV -2 infection by 81.4%, and reduced overall SARS -CoV -2 infection by 
66.4%. Serious adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the treatment group (1%) and 
placebo group (1%). Injection -site reactions were more common in the treatment group (4%) 
compared to the placebo group (2%), but no injection -site reactions in the study were grade 3 or 
above.  The majority of injection site reactions occurred within one day and resolved within two 
days (O’Brien, 2021b ).  
Among a sub -group of individuals in COV -2069 who were identified as SARS -CoV -2 positive 
but asymptomatic during screening, a single subcutaneous dose of casirivimab and imdevimab 
(1200 mg) reduced (relative to placebo) progression to sym ptomatic disease by 31.5%, and 
reduced the duration of symptoms in those that developed symptomatic infections. Injection -site 
reactions were more common in the treatment group (4%) compared to the placebo group (1%), 
but no injection -site reactions in the  study were grade 3 or above (O’Brien, 2021a ).  
In COV -2069, e fficacy results were similar in adolescents (age 12 to <18) as observed in adults: 
0% of subjects in the 1200 mg SC treatment group experienced symptomatic infection, c ompared 
with 9.3% of subjects in the placebo group. Safety data in adolescent subjects were also similar to 
that observed in adults. Injection site reactions were more common in the treatment group (5.9%) 
compared to the placebo group (1.6%), but none were  grade 3 or above in any group.  
In COV -2093, the adult volunteer study evaluating multiple doses of subcutaneous administration 
of casirivimab+imdevimab (monthly dosing over 6 months), injection site reactions were more 
common in the casirivimab and imdev imab group (34.6%) compared with the placebo group 
(15.8%), but none were grade 3 or above in any group.  
Identified Risks. As with other protein therapeutics, hypersensitivity reactions, including acute 
infusion -related reactions (IV administration) or inj ection site reactions (SC administration), may 
develop after study drug administration. Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, 
infusion -related reactions or injection site reactions, have been observed in patients who received 
REGN10933+REGN109 87. 
Potential or Theoretical Risks. The important potential risks of REGN10933+REGN10987 are 
the clinical consequences of immunogenicity , embryo -fetal toxicity  and antiviral resistance . 
Protein therapeutics carry the potential risk of an immunogenic respon se in the form of anti -drug 
antibody (ADA) and neutralizing antibody (NAb) development following administration, with 
possible consequences on safety and efficacy. Therefore, blood samples for immunogenicity 
assessment will be collected during the studies.   
Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies have not been conducted; therefore, the 
effects of REGN10933, REGN10987, and REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy on the 
fetus and reproductive organs in males and females are unknown. Human immunoglob ulin G1 
(IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental barrier and are present in breast milk; therefore,

 CONFIDENTIAL  the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy have the potential to be transferred from the 
mother to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_103152] a breastfed child. Giv en the high affinity and specificity of 
REGN10933 and REGN10987, off -target pharmacological effects are not anticipated in either the 
mother or the fetus, and no off -target binding of REGN10933 or REGN10987 was observed in 
any of the human or monkey tissue s evaluated ex vivo in tissue cross -reactivity studies. However, 
it is unknown whether the potential transfer of the combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 
therapy provides any treatment benefit or risk to the developi[INVESTIGATOR_103152] a breastfed child.  
There is cu rrently limited clinical experience in the use of REGN10933, REGN10987, and 
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy in females who are pregnant or breastfeeding. 
The combination of REGN10933+REGN10987 therapy should be used during pregnancy or 
breastfeedin g only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus or 
breastfed child considering all associated health factors. If a female subject is pregnant or were to 
become pregnant while receiving REGN10933+REGN10987 combinati on, the pregnancy should 
be followed until outcome and any safety issue observed get reported.  
REGN10933+REGN10987 combination therapy was strategically designed to be a combination 
therapy of [ADDRESS_783402] 
circulating variants. However, there is a potential risk of treatment failure due to circulating or 
treatment -emergent SARS -CoV -2 variants  that are resistant to REGN10933+REGN10987 
combination.  
Ongoing sequencing analyses of nasopharyngeal swab samples from sponsor -conducted clinical 
studies have found no evidence that the clinical use of REGN10933+REGN10987  leads to the 
selection of escape (treatment emergent) variants in REGN10933+REGN10987 -binding epi[INVESTIGATOR_322], 
within the RBD, or other regions of the S protein .  
The in vitro neutralization potency of REG N10933+REGN10987  and its individual components 
is continu ously monitored against S protein variants, including VUS, variants identified in in vitro 
escape studies, and variants from publicly available SARS -CoV -2 genome data (eg, GISAID). 
REGN10933+REGN10987 demonstrates in vitro neutralization activity below the  limit of 
quantitation against the Omicron variant, and it is unlikely that REGN10933+REGN10987 will be 
active against this variant. However, REGN10933+REGN10987 retains activity against the Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Iota, Kappa, and Mu variants.  It is not known how in vitro 
neutralization data correlate with clinical outcomes.  
Decisions regarding the use of REGN10933+REGN10987 should take into consideration what is 
known about the characteristics of circulating variants including regional or geo graphical 
differences and available information on REGN10933+REGN10987 susceptibility patterns.  
There may also be a potential for the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination to interfere with an 
individual’s endogenous immune response to either SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_783403] COVID -19. Refer to Section  3.3.3  for more information.  
Antibody -dependent enhancement (ADE) has been obse rved for some therapeutics targeting 
exogenous viral proteins. For antibody therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], ADE is thought to occur when binding of 
antibody to the target viral protein enhances Fc gamma receptor (FcγR) -mediated host cell entry 
of the virus (Iwasaki, 2020 ). This could potentially lead to worsening of disease and, in the case 
of SARS, acute lung injury (Liu, 2019 ). REGN10933 and REGN10987 retain the Fc region, as 
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:[ADDRESS_783404] viral infection (Yasui,  2014), and there is no strong 
eviden ce of ADE in other coronavirus models (Kam, 2007 ) (Liu, 2019 ) (Luo, 2018 ). To date, Fc -
containing mAbs developed by [CONTACT_103224] -CoV have demonstrated 
specificity to their exogenous targets with no significant unexpected safety findings in preclinical 
or clinical studies. All subjects receiving REGN10933+REGN10987 will have safety fo llow-up 
assessments during the drug elimination period.

clinical trials.  
3.3.3.  Risk -Benefit for REGN10933+REGN10987 Administered With COVID -19 
Vaccines  
To date, REGN10933+REGN10987 has not been studied systematically in the clinical 
development progra m with respect to concomitant (or temporally proximal) administration with 
vaccines (COVID -19 or otherwise). There are currently no published data on the safety and 
efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines in persons who received monoclonal antibodies as part of 
COVI D-19 treatment. However, in a study of healthy adult subjects who received multiple SC 
doses of REGN10933+REGN10987 (R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -HV-2093), 54 subjects were noted (in 
blinded analysis) to have COVID -19 vaccination in close temporal proximity to study drug 
administration and thought to still be in therapeutic range for REGN10933+REGN10987. In this 
subset of subjects, no SAEs or hypersensitivity reactions were reported post vaccination. Similarly, 
study R10933 -[ZIP_CODE] -COV -2069 (COV -2069) is a phase 3 randomized  placebo -controlled trial 
assessing the safety and efficacy of REGN10933+REGN10987 in preventing COVID -[ADDRESS_783408] that 
REGN10933+REGN10987 administered with a COVID -[ADDRESS_783409] is anticipated on the safety profile of the REGN10933+REGN10987 
combination when COVID -19 vaccine is given concomitantly or in temporal proximity, although 
safety and tolerability will nevertheless be evaluated in this study. Similarly, this study will also 
evaluate if concomitant administration (or administration in temporal proximity) may impact 
efficacy of COVID -19 vaccines to induce the desired immunologic response (positively or 
negatively).  
All risks described in the sect ions above for individual treatments (Section  3.3.1  and Section  3.3.2 ) 
are considered relevant for the administration of REGN10933+REGN10987 and Moderna mRNA -
1273 vaccine concomitantly or in temporal proximity. Theoretically, there may be a potential for 
the REGN10933+REGN10987 combination to interf ere with an individual’s endogenous immune 
response to either SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_783410] COVID -19 in such setting. The 
objective of this study is to determine if this theoretical risk is identified and, if so, to quantify the 
                                        VV-RIM-00182647-1.0 Approved - 28 Jan 2022 GMT-5:00

 CONFIDENTIAL  risk. To miti gate the potential risk of such interference, an allowance is provided for subjects to 
receive additional vaccination if interference is identified (Section  6.1). Similarly, there could be 
risk of hypersensitivity reactions when REGN10933+REGN10987 is administered within close 
proximity of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine. In this study, the risk of hypersensitivity will be 
monitored closely during study visits . Theoretical risk of ADE also remains applicable. However, 
currently ADE has not come up as a safety concern for REGN10933+REGN10987 in the long -
term safety follow -up in the ongoing clinical studies. We will continue to monitor ADE as a 
theoretical risk i n this study like all other ongoing clinical studies.  
Summary. In summary, based on prior experience with other human mAbs against exogenous 
targets, the available preclinical data for REGN10933+REGN10987 to date, and the unmet need 
for a SARS -CoV -2 therap y that can be given concomitantly (or in temporal proximity) to COVID -
19 vaccination, it is the opi[INVESTIGATOR_593707] -benefit balance for 
REGN10933+REGN10987 given concomitantly with Moderna mRNA -1273 is acceptable to 
allow evaluatio n of this mAb combination in the adult population planned for this study.

 CONFIDENTIAL  6. STUDY DESIGN  
This study is a phase 2, randomized, open -label, parallel group study in healthy adult volunteers 
to assess the i mmunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine when 
administered with REGN10933+REGN10987.  
6.1. Study Description and Duration  
The study consists of 3 periods: a screening/baseline period, a vaccine response assessment period, 
and a follo w-up period. The study design is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517]  2 and Figure  3; study treatment 
assignment is depi[INVESTIGATOR_6517]  1. The Schedules o f Events can be found in Table  3 (enrollment 
wave 1 [ study arms 1, 2, 3, and 6a] and enrollment wave 3 [arms 7, 8, and 6c]), Table  4 (enrollment 
wave 2 [ study arms 4, 5, and 6b] ), and Figure  3 (enrollment wave 4 [arms 9 and 6d]).  
Subjects will be assessed for eligibility during the screening/baseline period , which may occur 
up to [ADDRESS_783420] SARS -CoV -2 infection by [CONTACT_963] -PCR and serology tests (refer Section  7.2.2  for 
exclusio n criteria).  
During this  period, subjects will also be assigned to an enrollment wave, as described in 
Section  8.5).  
On day 1, eligible subjects wil l be randomized to a study arm (1 of 12) within their assigned 
enrollment wave. Subjects randomized to study arms 1 through 5 or 7 through 9 will receive an IV 
infusion or SC injection of the study drug ( REGN10933+REGN10987 ) on day 1 or day 7. Subjects 
in arms 6a to 6d (the control arms) will not receive any study drug. The first dose of the vaccine 
will be administered on day 1 or day 15, based on study arm assignment at randomization 
(Figure  1).  
All subjects will receive the second dose of the vaccine [ADDRESS_783421] Sheet (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [HCP Fact Sheet], 2022 ) 
(refer to Section  3.2.1  for rationale).  Refer to Section  8.5 for more information on dose levels and 
timing of administration.  
The vaccine response assessment period  represents the time period of the primary analysis 
(Section  4.1). For study arms 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6a, and 6c, this period includes up to study day 71; for 
study arms 4, 5, 9, 6b, and 6d, the period includes up to day 57. Following this assessment period, 
subjects will enter a follow -up period  lasting up to [ADDRESS_783422] visits for drug concentra tion, 
immunogenicity, and exploratory analyses, and will be monitored for AEs (including AESIs)  
during in -person visits (refer to Section  10.1 for reco rding and reporting requirements). For 
subjects in study arms 4 and 5 (receiving the study drug and vaccine on the same day), a phone 
call will be made within 24 hours following study drug and vaccine administration on day 1 for 
AE collection.

indicated in the Schedule of Events. T hese samples will be banked for viral sequencing.  
6.1.3.  Study Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1869]  
A Regeneron team will monitor the safety data on an ongoing basis to assess the risk -benefit profile 
of REGN10933+REGN10987 administered with Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine . The team may 
be comprised of the medical/study director, a Global Patient Safety representative, representatives 
from Biostatistics and Data Management, Clinical Operations, and Regulatory Affairs.  
The monitoring team will also include at least 2 medical officers from the National Institutes of 
Health (NIH). One officer will serve as the primary representative, with a second officer serving 
as an alternate representative as needed.  
If there are significant safety concerns, a recommendation may be made to temporarily pau se, alter, 
or terminate the study. Appropriate action, if needed, will be taken based upon this review and in 
consultation with Regeneron Safety Oversight Committee (RSOC) , which will include senior 
clinical, regulatory, and pharmacovigilance leaders at Re generon. Applicable regulatory 
procedures will be adhered to as required by [CONTACT_593739] a 
change in study conduct, temporary halt, study termination, or study restart.

contraception prior to the initial dose/start of the first treatment and for at least 6 months 
after REGN10933+REGN10987 administration  
Highly effective contraceptive measures include:  
• Abstinence2,3 
• Stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception 
(oral, intravaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more 
menstrual cycles prior to screening  
• Intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS)  
• Bilateral tubal ligation  
1WOCBP are defined as women who are fertile following menarche until becoming 
postmenopausal, unless permanently sterile. Per manent sterilization methods include 
hysterectomy, bilateral salpi[INVESTIGATOR_1656], and bilateral oophorectomy.  
A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in th e postmenopausal 
range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12  months of 
amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient to determine the oc currence of a 
postmenopausal state. The above definitions are according to the Clinical Trial Facilitation 
Group (CTFG) guidance. Pregnancy testing and contraception are not required for women 
with documented hysterectomy or tubal ligation.  
2Sexual abstine nce is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
drugs. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration  
of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient.

 CONFIDENTIAL  3Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal 
(coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM) are not 
accepta ble methods of contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used 
together.  
24. Sexually active men who are unwilling to use the following forms of medically 
acceptable birth control during the study drug follow -up period and for 6 months after 
REGN10933+REGN10987 administration: vasectomy with medical assessment of 
surgical success OR consistent use of a condom. Sperm donation is prohibited during the 
study and for up to 6 months after REGN10933+REGN10987 administration.  
25. Clinical history of myoc arditis and/or pericarditis . 
7.3. Premature Withdrawal from the Study  
A subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, and without 
repercussion.  
The investigator and/or Sponsor have the right to withdraw a subject from the study if it is no 
longer in the interest of the subject to continue in the study, or if the subject’s continuation in the 
study places the scientific outcome of the study at risk (eg, if a subject does not or cannot follow 
study procedures). An excessive rate of  withdrawals would render the study uninterpretable; 
therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided.  
Subjects who are withdrawn prematurely from the study will be asked to complete the early 
termination visit, as described in Section  9.1.[ADDRESS_783433] dose of Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine as assigned may be 
replaced.

 CONFIDENTIAL  SC and IM Injection Administration  
All subjects allocated to a SC regimen will receive either  4 (study arm 4) or 2 (study arm 5) 
injections of study drug on the day of administration. It is recommended that SC injection sites 
should be chosen among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas) 
and upper thighs. During stu dy drug administration, each injection must be given in a different 
anatomical location (1 injection administered in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen, another 
in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen, etc).  
All subjects will receive each Moderna m RNA -1273 vaccination dose through a single IM 
injection in the deltoid muscle  (CDC, 2021 ) . 
Subjects should receive all doses of Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_783464] Sheet (Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine [HCP Fact Sheet ], 2022 ). 
Study arms 4 and 5 only:  Subjects will receive both study drug and vaccine on day 1. The study 
drug will be administered first, followed by [CONTACT_29500]. There must be a minimum of [ADDRESS_783465]-administration monitoring of study drug and vaccine  
Study arms 1 through 5 and 7 through 9:  Subjects should be monitored for at least [ADDRESS_783466] CDC guidelines  (CDC, 2021 ) . For study arms 4 and 5 
(receiving study drug and vaccine on the s ame day), approximately 24 hours after completion of 
the study drug and vaccine administration on day 1, subjects will be followed up by [CONTACT_593744].  
Study arms 6a, 6b, 6c and 6d:  Subjects assigned to each of these study arms will not receive 
study drug during this study. These subjects should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after 
vaccine administration . 
9.2.3.  Pharmacodynamic and Exploratory Biomarker Procedures  
This section describes planned or potential pharmacodynamic and exploratory analyses, some of 
which may not be reported in the CSR.  
Note that any biological samples collected during the study which are not used for their planned 
purpose, or for which material remains after their planned analysis, may be kept for up 15 years 
after study comp letion (or for a shorter time period if required per regional laws and regulations) 
for use in exploratory research related to how the study drugs work and to study SARS -CoV -2, 
COVID -19, and immune responses to SARS -CoV -2 vaccination.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SARS -CoV -2 Neutraliza tion Assays  
Vaccine induced neutralizing antibody titers will be characterized using an assay to measure the 
ability of serum antibodies to block SARS -CoV -2 S protein -mediated infection of cells in vitro. 
(Vandergaast, 2020 ). Because REGN10933+REGN10987 will neutralize infection in this assay, 
anti-idiotype antibodies that block REGN10933 and REGN10987 neutralizing activity will be 
added, allowing for detection of  vaccine -induced neutralizing antibodies generated in vivo 
post-vaccination. The ID 50 (serum dilution that inhibits by 50% the transfection signal detected in

 CONFIDENTIAL  positive control wells) of neutralizing antibodies tested will be compared between the vaccine -only 
arm and each REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment group at time points in the Schedules of Events 
to measure the induction of neutralizing activity to the SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  SARS -CoV -2 Serology Characterization Assays  
Serum binding antibodies to SARS -CoV -2 S protein trimer, RBD and other SARS -CoV -2 
subdomains (including S1 and nucleocapsid) will be assessed as secondary and exploratory 
objectives of this study. To explore whether or not mRNA -1273 vaccine -mediated humoral 
immunity to SARS -CoV -2 is affected by [CONTACT_593745]10933+REGN10987, 
serological immunoassays will be used to detect antibodies against the SARS -CoV -2 S protein and 
subdomains at time points in the Schedules of Events . Because REGN10933+REGN10987 will 
interfere with these measur ements, an anti -idiotype antibody that blocks 
REGN10933+REGN10987 will be included in the assay, allowing for detection of endogenous 
serum antibodies generated in vivo post -vaccination. Additional serological characterization 
related to antibody recogniti on of viral variants and further delineation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_593711] -induced antibodies may be done if technically feasible and assays become available.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Cellular Immunity Assays  
PBMCs will be processed at a central lab and may be stored for analysis. Both B cell and T cell 
immune responses will be studied. Assays for B cell responses may include, but not be limited to, 
quantification by [CONTACT_1603] -cytometry of circulating antigen -specific B cells or plasma cells using 
labeled S protein trimer, RBD and other SARS -CoV -2 subdomains, and quantification of SARS -
CoV -2 specific antibody responses in either primary ELISPOT assays or re -stimulation assays 
followed by [CONTACT_15236]. Studies focused on T cell responses may include, but may not be limited 
to, flow cy tometry with isolated PBMCs to characterize immune subsets, quantify SARS -CoV -2 
specific T cell responses via ex vivo peptide stimulation assays with downstream flow cytometry 
and/or cytokine measurements. Cell profiling may include bulk RNA (transcriptome ) sequencing, 
and T cell receptor or B cell receptor RNA or DNA sequencing.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Viral Sequencing  
In order to monitor for possible SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_783467] -REGN10933+REGN10987 treatment 
and/or post -vaccination and potential resistance, NP swabs will be collect ed for SARS -CoV -[ADDRESS_783468] of th e entire viral genome, including the full gene sequence that 
encodes the SARS -CoV -2 S protein.  
Viral variants suspected to confer decreased susceptibility to REGN10933 and/or REGN10987 or 
the mRNA -1273 vaccine will be evaluated in nonclinical work separate  from this protocol.  
The results of viral sequencing will be reported separately from the CSR . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Serum and Plasma for Exploratory Research  
Changes in circulating concentrations of serum/plasma biomarkers associated with COVID -19, 
SARS -CoV -2, REGN10933+REGN10 987, vaccine -induced immunity, vaccine -drug interactions, 
host and viral biological pathways, and other mechanisms related to disease activity and clinical

evaluated.  
9.2.4.  Safety Procedures  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]. Vital signs 
will be measured after the subject has been resting quietly for at least approximately 5  minutes and 
may be obtained in seated or supi[INVESTIGATOR_2547].  
Vital signs will be collected prior to and approximately 30 minutes following each administration 
of the study drug or vaccine primary series (first and second vaccine dose). Vital signs may also 
be collected as needed, according to local standard of care and as per the discretion of the 
investigator.  
Blood pressure measurements may be repeated once during screening.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Adverse Events Monitoring  
Adverse even ts listed in Section  10.1.1  will be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications (as defined in Section  [IP_ADDRESS]) will be recorded.  
[IP_ADDRESS].  Pregnancy Test  
Urine pregnancy test will be performed for WOCBP at the time periods described in the Schedules 
of Events. If urine pregnancy test is positive , a serum pregnancy test will be performed for 
confirmation, and subjects should be counseled as described in Section  8.3.3 . 
[IP_ADDRESS].  Targeted Physical Examination  
Targeted physical examination is required and will include examination of the oropharynx, skin, 
heart, lungs, and any other system(s) depending on complaints or  concerns expressed by [CONTACT_1560].  
9.2.5.  Laboratory Testing  
Hematology, chemistry, urinalysis, and serum pregnancy testing samples will be analyzed by a

10.1. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
10.1.1.  General Guidelines  
In this study, the following  TEAEs will be recorded:  
• Treatment -emergent AEs throughout the study  
• Treatment -emergent SAEs throughout the study  
• Treatment -emergent AESIs (defined in Section  10.1.3 )  
The investigator must promptly record all clinical events occurring during the study data 
collection , from the time of signing the ICF to the end of the post-vaccination observation period 
(see Section  [IP_ADDRESS] ). Medical conditions that existed or were diagnosed prior to the signing of 
the Informed Consent will be recorded as part of medical history. Abnormal laboratory values and 
vital signs observed at  the time of Informed Consent should also be recorded as medical history. 
Any subsequent worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of 
a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study dru g should also be 
recorded as an AE.  
At each visit, the investigator will determine whether any AEs have occurred by [CONTACT_46922]. Adverse events may be directly observed, reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_423], or by 
[CONTACT_593746] h study visit. Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without 
asking about the occurrence of any specific symptoms. The investigator must assess all AEs to 
determine seriousness, severity, and causality, in accordance with the definitions in Secti on 10.1.4 . 
The investigator’s assessment must be clearly documented in the site’s source documentation with 
the investigator’s signature. The investig ator should follow up on SAEs (and AESIs) until they 
have resolved or are considered clinically stable; AEs should be followed until they are resolved 
or last study visit, whichever comes first.  
Always report the diagnosis as the AE or SAE term. When a dia gnosis is unavailable, report the 
primary sign or symptom as the AE or SAE term with additional details included in the narrative 
until the diagnosis becomes available. If the signs and symptoms are distinct and do not suggest a 
common diagnosis, report th em as individual entries of AE or SAE.  
Laboratory results, vital signs, and other diagnostic result s or findings  should be appraised by [CONTACT_173901].  Isolated abnormal laboratory results, vital sign 
findings, o r other diagnostic findings (ie, not part of a reported diagnosis) should be reported as

 CONFIDENTIAL  AEs if they are symptomatic, lead to study drug discontinuation,  require corrective treatment, or 
constitute an AE in the investigator ’s clinical judgment . 
For events that are serious due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], the reason for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31558] (diagnosis or symptom requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]). A procedure is not 
an AE or SAE, but the reason for the procedure may be an AE or SAE. P re-planned (prior to 
signing the informed consent form) procedure s, treatment s requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_5912] -
existing conditions that do not worsen in severity, and admission for palliative or social care should 
not be reported as SAEs (see Section  10.1.4  for definitions).  
For deaths, the underlying or immediate cause of death should always be reported as an SAE.  
Any SAE that may occur subsequent to the reporting period that the investigator assesses as related 
to study drug should also be reported.  
All AEs, SAEs , AESIs, and pregnancy reports are to be reported according to the procedures in 
Section  10.1.3 .  
10.1.2.  Reporting Procedure  
All events (serious and non -serious) must be reported with investigator’s assessment of the event’s 
seriousness, severity, and causality to the study drug. For SAEs and AESIs, a detailed narrative 
summarizing the course of the event, including its evaluation, treatment, and outcome should be 
provided on the AE CRF. Specific or estimated dates of event onset, treatment, and resolution 
should be included, when available. Me dical history, concomitant medications, and laboratory data 
that are relevant to the event should also be summarized in the narrative. For fatal events, the 
narrative should state whether an autopsy was or will be performed, and include the results if 
available. Information not available at the time of the initial report must be documented in a follow -
up report. Source documents  (including hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24925], diagnostic reports, etc. ) will 
be summarized in the narrative on the AE CRF, and retained at the  study center and available upon 
request.  
Urgent safety queries must be followed up and addressed promptly. Follow -up information and 
response to non -urgent safety queries should be combined for reporting to provide the most 
complete data possible w ithin each follow -up.  
10.1.3.  Events that Require Expedited Reporting to Sponsor  
The following events also require reporting to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of 
learning of the event:  
• Treatment -emergent SAEs . 
• Treatment -emergent AESI (serious and nonserious), defined as :  
− Grade ≥2 infusion -related reactions to REGN10933+REGN10987 through day 4  
− Grade ≥3 injection -site reactions to REGN10933+REGN10987 or each dose of 
Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_783473] -injection  
− Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity re actions to REGN10933+REGN10987 or each dose of 
Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_783474] -injection (as 
applicable)

 CONFIDENTIAL  • If subjects experience Grade ≥ 3 ISRs or Grade ≥2 hypersensitivity reactions related to 
Moderna mRNA -1273 administered as a concomitant medication outside of the 
study , these events are NOT to be considered as AESIs and do not require expedited 
reporting to Sponsor  
• Pregnancy:  Although pregnancy is not considered an AE, it is the responsibility of the 
investigator to report to the Sponsor (or designee), within 24  hours of identification, 
any pregnancy occurring in a female, for 6 months after REGN10933+REGN10987 
administration. Any complication of pregnancy affecting a female study subject and/or 
fetus and/or newborn that mee ts the SAE criteria must be reported as an SAE. Outcome 
for all pregnancies should be reported to the Sponsor . 
10.1.4.  Reporting Adverse Events Following Vaccination  
It is advised that healthcare providers administering Moderna mRNA -[ADDRESS_783475] Sheet (Moderna 
COVID -19 Va ccine [HCP Fact Sheet], 2022 ). 
The vaccination provider is responsible for mandatory reporting of the following to the 
Vaccine  Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS):  
• Vacci ne administration errors whether or not associated with an adverse event,  
• Serious  adverse events* (irrespective of attribution to vaccination),  
• Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults, and  
• Cases of COVID -19 that result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_30059].  
*Serious adverse events are defined as: Death; A life -threatening adve rse event; Inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]; A persistent or significant incapacity or 
substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; A congenital anomaly/birth 
defect; An important medical even t that based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the 
individual and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed 
above.  
10.2. Definitions  
10.2.1.  Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject admin istered a study drug which may or 
may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally 
associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug (ICH 
E2A Guideline. Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting, Oct 1994).  
10.2.2.  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any d ose:

 CONFIDENTIAL  • Results in death  – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated 
to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a subject is a passenger).  
• Is life-threatening  – in the view of the investigator, the subject is at immediate risk of 
death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.  
• Requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_869] . 
In-patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_31561] a hos pi[INVESTIGATOR_063] (any duration) or an 
emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24928] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_24929], 
or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by [CONTACT_25043].  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of 
one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is an importan t medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but may jeopardize the subject or 
may require intervention to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, 
intensive tr eatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]; or development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse).  
Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events.  
10.2.3.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
An adverse event of special interest (AESI; serious or non -serious) is one of scientific and medical 
interest specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communication by [CONTACT_593747]. Such an event might warrant 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.  
AESI are defined for this study in Section  10.1.3 . 
10.2.4.  Severity  
The severity of adverse events (including test findings classified as AEs) will be graded using the 
current version of the NCI -CTCAE v5.0.  
Treatment -emergent AEs, SAEs, or AESIs not listed in the NCI -CTCAE w ill be graded according 
to the scale in Table  7. The grading systems for anaphylaxis, allergic reaction (hypersensitivity),

possibility that the study drug and/or vaccine administered as part of the study caused the AE, 
based on evidence or facts, his/her clinical judgment, and the follow ing definitions. Causality 
should be assessed separately for the study drug and for the vaccine. The causality assessment 
must  be made based on the available information and can be updated as new information becomes 
available.  
The following factors should be considered when assessing causality:  
• Temporal relationship: time to onset vs time study drug and/or vaccine was 
administered  
• Nature of the reactions: immediate vs long term  
• Clinical and pathological features of the events  
• Existing information about study drug and/or vaccine and the same class of drugs or 
vaccines  
• Concomitant medications  
• Underlying and concurrent illnesses  
• Response to dechallenge (drug discontinuation) or dose reduction  
• Response to rechallenge (re -introduction of the drug) or dose increase, when applicable  
• Subject’s medical and social history  
Causality to the study drug and/or vaccine (including study drug and/or vaccine administration):  
• Related:  
− The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study drug and/or vaccine 
admi nistered as part of the study , and cannot be reasonably explained by [CONTACT_593749], subject’s clinical state (eg, disease under study, concurrent diseases,

10.3. Safety Monitoring  
The investigator will monitor the safety of study subject at his/her site(s) as per the requirements 
of this p rotocol and consistent with current Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Any questions or 
concerns should be discussed with the Sponsor in a timely fashion. The Sponsor will monitor the 
safety data from across all study sites. The Medical/Study Director will have  primary responsibility 
for the emerging safety profile of the compound, but will be supported by [CONTACT_25047] (eg, 
GPS; Biostatistics and Data Management). Safety monitoring will be performed on an ongoing 
basis (eg, individual review of SAEs) and on  a periodic cumulative aggregate basis.  
10.4. Notifying Health Authorities, Institutional Review Board, and 
Investigators  
During the study, the Sponsor and/or the contract research organization (CRO) will inform health 
authorities, IRBs, and the participating investigators of any S[LOCATION_003]Rs (Suspected Unexpected 
Serious Adverse Reactions) occurring in other study centers or other  studies of the active study 
drug REGN10933+REGN10987 , as appropriate per local reporting requirements. In addition, the 
Sponsor and/or CRO will comply with any additional local safety reporting requirements. All 
notifications to investigators will contain  only blinded information.   
Upon receipt of the Sponsor’s notification of a S[LOCATION_003]R that occurred with the study drug, the 
investigator will inform the Institutional Review Board (IRB) unless delegated to the Sponsor.  
Event expectedness for study drug REGN10 933+REGN10987 is assessed against the Reference 
Safety Information section of the Investigator’s Brochure that is effective for expedited safety 
reporting.  
At the completion of the study, the Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the 
cond uct of the trial in the Clinical Study Report to health authorities and IRB as appropriate.

 CONFIDENTIAL  11. STATISTICAL PLAN  
This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP will 
be revised prior to the end of the study to acc ommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol 
and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the 
planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the first database lock.  
Endpoints are listed in Sect ion 4. Analysis variables are listed in Section  5.  
11.1. Statistical Hypothesis  
No statistical hypothesis testing is planned in this study. Analyses of immunogenicity, safety, 
tolerability, and other data will be descriptive and exploratory in n ature.  
11.2. Justification of Sample Size  
This study plans to enroll up to approximately 286 subjects, in order to achieve a target enrollment 
of up to approximately 30 subjects per Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) 
arm and [ADDRESS_783479] for the primary 
endpoi nt, as well as allow for an assessment of the safety and tolerability of the Moderna mRNA -
1273 vaccine when administered with REGN10933+REGN10987.  
The assumed log 10-scale standard deviation for the study is 0.30 log. This assumption is based on 
phase 1 dat a for the Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccine, taking the weighted average (ie, adjusting for 
sample sizes) across all doses (25,100, and 250 μg) and age groups (18 to 55, 56 to 70, and ≥71 
years) for the neutralizing antibody titer ID 50 endpoint at day 57 (Anderson, 2020 ) (Jackson, 2020 ). 
With a log -scale standard deviation of 0.30 for the primary endpoint and a sample  size of 30 and 
46 subjects per arm (in combined study drug/vaccine and vaccine -only arms, respectively), the 
half-width of the 95% within -group confidence interval (CI) [ie, the minimal detectable difference] 
in this study is 0.11 log and 0.09 log, respec tively. For between -group comparisons, the half -width 
of the 95% between -group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and 
REGN10987) arms is 0.15 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between -group CI in this 
study for any individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and the 
total Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects is 0.14 log.  
The analysis set that will be used for assessment of vaccine response allows for subjects to be 
excluded from analysis if certain confounding criteria are  met (see Section  11.3.1 ). If 50% of 
subjects are excluded from analysis (ie, 15 subjects are analyzed per individual Moderna mRNA -
1273 + (REGN10933 an d REGN10987) arm and 23 total Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects 
are analyzed), the half -width of the 95% between group CI for any two Moderna mRNA -1273 + 
(REGN10933 and REGN10987) arms is 0.22 log. Additionally, the half -width of the 95% between 
group CI fo r any individual Moderna mRNA -1273 + (REGN10933 and REGN10987) arm and 
Moderna mRNA -1273 alone subjects is 0.20 log. Under this scenario, the minimal detectable 
difference still remains substantially smaller than the decrease in neutralization titers obser ved in 
a separate study of sera from recipi[INVESTIGATOR_593699] -1273 vaccine who were infected 
with South African variants (eg, B.1.351 v1, v2, and v3)  (Garcia -Beltran, 2021 )

Risk-Based Quality Monitoring (RBQM) methodology focuses on employing a fi t-for-purpose 
monitoring strategy, supported either directly by [CONTACT_550083], or via our CRO partners. 
RBQM strategies include: reduced source data verification (SDV), targeted source data review 
(SDR), the use of off -site/remote and triggered on -site monitoring visits, and Centralized 
Monitoring to identify site level risks and study level trends. The investigator must allow study -
related monitoring activities to occur.  
The study monitors will perform ongoing source data review to verify that data recorded in the 
CRF by [CONTACT_1191], complete, and verifiable from source documents, 
that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected, and that the study is being conducted in 
accordance with the current approved protoco l version and any other study agreements, ICH GCP, 
and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
12.2.2.  Source Document Requirements  
Investigators are required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate subject records (source 
documents). The site is responsible  to ensure quality within their records and systems and are 
accountable for ensuring that all source data and CRF data are timely, accurate and complete.  
The investigator must keep all source documents on file with the CRF (throughout this protocol, 
CRF re fers to either a paper CRF or an electronic CRF). Case report forms and source documents 
must be available at all times for inspection by [CONTACT_550084].

It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by [CONTACT_427]) to obtain 
written informed consent from each subje ct prior to his/her participation in the study and after the 
aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to the subject in 
language that he/she can understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by [CONTACT_550088].  
• Subjects who can write but cannot read will have the ICF read to them before signing 
and dating the ICF.  
• Subjects who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have  the ICF read 
to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the ICF to confirm 
that informed consent was given.  
The original ICF must be retained by [CONTACT_86211]'s study record, and a 
copy of the signed ICF must be given to the subject.  
If new safety information results in significant changes in the risk/benefit assessment, or if there 
are significant changes to the study procedures, the ICF must be reviewed and updated 
appropriately. All study subjects must be informed of the new information and provide their 
written consent if they wish to continue in the study. The original signed revised ICF must be 
maintained in the subject’s study record and a copy must be given to the subject.  
13.3. Subjects Confidentiality a nd Data Protection

 3 INTRODUCTION 
3.1 Study B ackground  
Physiologic al skin aging is multi factorial and result s from both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.  
Genetics  is one example of an i ntrinsic factor , others include hormone and metabolic processes 
that can cause the skin to age.  Exposure to chronic light , radiation, pollution, chemicals and 
toxins , are examples of extrinsic factors . Since skin health and beauty is contemplated as one of 
the representation of overall “well -being” and “health”, several anti -aging therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541366]. The goal of  these therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541367] a healthy, smooth, 
blemish -free, translucent and resilient skin . [1] 
Skin resurfacing or peel procedures have become an established non- surgical method for 
reducing certain skin imperfections such as wrinkles, rhytides, dark spots, scars, or blemishes.  
Traditional fully ablative and fractional lasers are the most commonly used devices for skin resurfacing.  
The skin is composed of three layers:  the epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196], the dermis, and the hypodermis.  The dermis contains well- organized and oriented collagen fibers that contribute to the firmness and 
smoothness of the skin.  As people age, these collagen fibers reduce in number and become less organized, resulting in sagging and/or wrinkled skin. When esthetic procedures are scheduled  
for older adults , the rate of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_541368] a slower wound healing and 
less effective desquamation  (shading of outer layers of the skin) , needs to be taken into 
consideration.
[1]  
In most skin resurfacing procedures, an energy source  (heat, radiofrequency energy, etc.) is used 
to selectively damage the skin and prompt a healing response that stimulates the growth of new collagen fibers in the dermis that are well- organized.  The healing response and new collagen 
formation results in s kin that is smoother and firmer.   
There are numerous traditional fully ablative and fractional lasers on the market today used for skin resurfacing.  Traditional and fractional lasers differ in their method of treatment.  Traditional lasers have a single beam that burns or damages all of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_825188] t he 
treatment area of the beam. Fractional lasers divide the beam into multiple smaller beams and treat only a “fraction” of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_541370]. This results in multiple small cores of laser damage surrounded by [CONTACT_541397].  When 
compared to traditional lasers, fractional lasers deliver a more superficial treatment resulting in less risk for complications and reduced time for healing. However, this also means more 
treatments may be required to achieve the desired results especially in areas of deep lines or wrinkles.  Healing times  vary by [CONTACT_541398], but fractional laser recovery time is 
typi[INVESTIGATOR_825189] s. 
In the wake of the demonstrated safety and efficacy of laser skin resurfacing, multiple additional treatment modalities have been developed for this application including the use of radiofrequency (RF) energy . The fractionated radiofrequency results in epi[INVESTIGATOR_541372] a fractional 
CO 2 laser with dermal heating, seen in the non- ablative lasers and devices.[2] The combination 
of epi[INVESTIGATOR_281179] l ablation and dermal heating with radiofrequency, called sublative resurfacing in 
some studies, is suitable for skin types I –IV, for the treatment of skin laxity, wrinkles, enlarged 
J-Plasma Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1558, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_1144386]  
recovery and down time periods are significantly lower when compared with ablative laser 
healing times, with minimal adverse effects.[3] 
3.[ADDRESS_1144387] on 
the skin through the use of positively ionized gasses is plasma skin resurfacing (PSR).[4] As this 
plasma comes in contact [CONTACT_541399], the positive ions capture back electrons 
while energy is released. With PSR, an inert  gaseous source is used to form a plasma that 
releases thermal energy that eliminates oxygen from the targeted skin surface. [5,6] PSR is not 
dependent on a chromophore for its use and does not vaporize tissue as ablative lasers do. This 
resurfacing modality has been hypothesized to function by [CONTACT_12789] a layer of desiccated epi[INVESTIGATOR_541374] a natural barrier that facilitates accelerated healing with generation of new epi[INVESTIGATOR_49196]. PSR also penetrates to the upper dermis resulting in thermal denaturation of surrounding collagen, thereby [CONTACT_541400], which has been shown to continue up to a year after the plasma treatments.
 [7] Plasma resurfacing has been safely used in 
Fitzpatrick skin types I –IV. It has been approved for the treatment of many skin c onditions 
including photoaging, acne scars, rhytides, dyschromias, skin laxity, as well as the treatment of actinic keratosis and seborrheic keratosis. In contrast to the ablative laser, plasma resurfacing treatments have a very low incidence of side effects such as permanent hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371], scarring, or prolonged erythema.
 [8] 
As an alternative treatment modality  for skin resurfacing , Bovie Medical Corporation ha s 
developed the J-Plasma® system that delivers RF energy in a controlled fashion with similar 
depth of thermal effect as predicate devices currently on the market for dermal resurfacing and wrinkle reduction procedures . 
[9,10,11] A po tential  benefit of this single -treatment low-risk 
technology  is reducing  wrinkle appearance and enhancing  well-being  by [CONTACT_825203] a more youthful appearance.  
3.3 Study Device Description  
The J -Plasma® system consists of an electrosurgical generator unit (ESU , Figure 1 ), a handpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]  
(Figure 2), and a supply of helium gas.  RF energy is delivered to the handpi[INVESTIGATOR_825190].  When helium gas is passed over the energized electrode, a helium plasma is generated which allows for conduction of the RF energy from the electrode to the subject  in the form of a precise helium plasma beam.

Bovie Medical  Corporation’s J -Plasma
® helium -based plasma technology has received FDA 
clearance (K112233, K151325, K152570, and K170188) for the cutting, coagulation, and 
ablation of soft tissue.   
Pre-clinical studies comparing J -Plasma® to other energy sources such as CO 2 laser and RF 
energy demonstrated less or comparable lateral and depth of thermal spread for J -Plasma® in 
porcine peritoneum, bladder, and small intestine[12].   
Additionally, a pre -clinical study comparing J -Plasma® to the Rhytec Portrait PSR for ablation 
of porcine dermis was conducted to evaluate performance the J -Plasma®.  Four animals were 
utilized in the study to evaluate both devices at acute and chronic time points.  At the acute time 
point, J -Plasma using 1 pass at both 20% and 40% power was very similar to the results 
observed with the Rhytec system at PSR2 and PSR3 settings.  At the chronic time p oint, dermal 
changes with the J -Plasma® appeared to extend deeper into the dermis than that observed with 
the Rhytec treated tissue, which may be beneficial and possibly demonstrate superior performance.  These results support  the safety of J -Plasma
® for this application and equivalent 
tissue effects for the two technologies .   
These p re-clinical study results demonstrate safety and efficacy of the J-Plasma® system in the 
ablation of soft tissue within its current FDA cleared indications  in an animal model , therefore 
making the  J-Plasma® system a viable technology for dermal skin resurfacing.

and Zone 5 (cheeks).  Tumescent (a n anesthetic ) will be injected under the subject ’s skin .  The  
volume of tumescent used in each Zone will  be based on  the investigator’s discretion  and will 
be documented in the CRF s. The plasma beam will be used to ablate the tissue in each Zone  
using slow , but steady movement of the beam. All Zones  will be treated with only a single pass  
of the plasma beam . Special care must  be taken to not pass over any treated area more than 
once.   Zone 1 (perioral) and Zone 2 (periorbital) will be treated with a maximum of 20% power 
and 4 liters/minute helium flow.  Z ones 3, 4, and 5 (forehead, nose, and cheeks, respectively)  
will be treated with a maximum of 40%  power and 4 liters/minute of helium flow.  The ablated 
tissue  will not be wiped away.

Post-Procedure Care Guidelines  
Days 0- 10: 
• Keep skin moist at all times, us e of a cool mist vaporizer on face as much as possible  
is recommended  
• Keep skin covered with a generous layer of petroleum jelly (i.e., Vaseline Petroleum 
Jelly) at all times  
• Perform cool water soaks every 1 -2 hours as tolerated on days 0- 2, then every 2 -4 
hours  on days 3- 10 
 Fill a clean bowl with cold tap water and a few ice cubes and 1 tablespoon of 
white vinegar for every cup of water  
 Using clean 4x4 gauze pads, wet  them with the water solution and apply over 
the face, replacing them with new wet gauzes before they dry ; alternatively, 
cold water  may be  repeatedly  dripped over the gauze 
 Continue soak for approximately 30 minutes  
• After soak is over, pat dry with a clean, soft towel and reapply petroleum jelly  
Days 11 and beyond:  
• Apply l ight moisturizer and sun protection as directed by [CONTACT_825206], subject s will be asked to complete VAS pain assessment and

7 EVALUATION TOOLS  
The following evaluation tools will be used in this study:  
7.1 Fitzpatrick Skin Scale (FSS)  
Assessment  of subject ’s skin color will be determined prior to study procedure  by [CONTACT_825209] .  The scale delineates skin color into the c ategories as shown in 
Table 2.  
 
Table 2 : Fitzpatrick Skin Scale Evaluation  
Skin Type  Description  
Type I  White skin that never tans and always burns easily  
Type II  White skin that tans slightly and always burns easily  
Type III  Light brown skin that tans gradually and can burn moderately  
Type IV  Moderately brown skin that tans well and burns slightly  
Type V  Dark brown skin that tans profusely and burns rarely  
Type VI  Black skin with deep pi[INVESTIGATOR_541381]   
7.2 Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis  Scale (FWS)  
Assessment of subject  wrinkles at baseline and follow -up visits will be performed by [CONTACT_825210] -up visits (excluding the 
10 day follow -up visit) will be performed by [CONTACT_541410]- certified dermatologists  or plastic 
surgeons  sourced and managed by [CONTACT_325732] , called Independent Photographic  
Reviewers (IPRs) , using the Fitzpatrick Wrinkle and Elastosis  Scale ( FWS ) categories as shown 
in Table 3  (see also Section 12.3 Data Management Responsibilities and Section 12.3 Data 
Capture Methods ). The FWS is a clinically validated assessment tool used to assess skin 
wrinkle severity and elastosis  on a scale from [ADDRESS_1144415] ’s visit 
(baseline and all applicable follow -up visits ) and  will perform photographic assessments of each 
subject ’s wrinkle depth in the treated zones (identified only as “Zones to Evaluate” to the IPRs) 
using  FWS  and ignoring nasolabial folds  and marionette lines  (effects of gravity) , and artifacts 
from the chin rest.  The IPRs will assign a single  FWS  score per subject at each  time point. 
J-Plasma Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1558, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_1144416] one degree of wrinkle score reduction per FWS when comparing the score obtained at the 3 month follow -up visit to the baseline wrinkle score.

III Fine to deep wrinkles, numerous lines , with or without redundant 
skin folds  7-9 Severe: Multipapular and confluent 
elastosis (thickened, yellow and pallid) approaching or consisten t with cutis 
rhomboidalis.  
7.3 Modified Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)  
The Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) is a subjective rating of improvement in 
treatment results compared to pre -treatment.  A modification of the GAIS to include “much 
worse” and “very much worse”  as rating options  will be used in this study .  The Investigator 
will grade  the overall improvement of treatment area  as indicated in Table 4a by [CONTACT_58281] ’s appearance at follow -up visits against a photograph taken prior to procedure .  
Likewise, the subject  will also rate their improvement compared to pre -treatment  as shown in 
Table 4b .   
 
The modified GAIS results will be collected at all follow -up visits .

7.5 Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  
The s tudy subject s will be asked to complete a 10 -point Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  for the 
following assessments: 
1. Level of pain and discomfort associated with study procedure – to be completed by [CONTACT_1560] s on the day of the procedure (prior to the procedure and immediately following

will be asked if they would recommend the treatment to friends and acquaintances (yes, 
perhaps, or no)  
 
Scoring will consist of making a mark on a [ADDRESS_1144418] Diary  
Study subjects will be asked to complete a daily diary (see Appendix C: Subject Diary) starting 
from  the procedure date (after study procedure, at home ) until  the [ADDRESS_1144419]’ s baseline and [ADDRESS_1144420] ’s visit (baseline and 3- month follow -up visit ).  Each IPR will view each subj ect’s 
randomized baseline and 3- month follow -up images and assess which set of images represent 
the subject’s post -treatment images. Each photograph will have a unique identification number, 
but the sets of images will not be arranged in any specific order . 
 
A subject will be considered a success if at least [ADDRESS_1144421] for cause or relation to device and/or procedure.  
 
In addition, study subject s will be instructed to report all of complications experienced post 
study procedure to the site personnel as soon as they occur/ are observed.                                                                                                                                                      
 
It is the Investigator’ s responsibility to determine seriousness, severity, and relatedness of the 
Adverse Event to the device and procedure using the definitions below.  
8.2 Adverse E vent (AE) Definition  
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject , 
including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the subject ’s participation in the research, 
whether or not considered related to the subject ’s participation in the research.  
 A preexisting condition ( one that is present at the start of the study ) will be recorded as an AE 
only if the frequency, inte nsity, or the character of the condition worsens during the study 
period.   Neither the condition, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prolonged hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], nor surgery are reported as an AE in the following circumstances: hospi[INVESTIGATOR_825194] a preexisting condition. Surgery should not be reported as an outcome of an AE if the purpose of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful.  
8.3 Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  Definition  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is an adverse event that:  
• Led to a death or  
• Led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject that:  
o Resulted in a life -threatening illness or injury,  
o Resulted in a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, 
o Required in- patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
o Resulted in medical or surgical intervention to prevent impairment to body structure or a body function, or  
o Led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnorm ality or birth defect.   
 All SAEs that occur during the study period, whether considered to be related to the investigational product or not , must be reported to the Sponsor within [ADDRESS_1144422]  (UADEs)  Definition  
An unanticipated adverse device effect  (UADEs)  is defined as any serious adverse effect on 
health or safety or any life- threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan, or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.   
In addition, any UADEs  will be reported to the Sponsor  and the reviewing IRB as soon as 
possible, but no later than within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.   
All adverse events, anticipated or unanticipated, will be monitored until they are adequately 
resolved or explained.    
8.5 Reporting Requirements  
All adverse events (AEs) obser ved by [CONTACT_62444] s, investigators or other study staff from first 
exposure to the study product through last study follow -up visit will be recorded. If a devic e-
related AE, SAE, or unanticipated serious device related effect is ongoing at the final study visit, the subject  will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject  is lost to follow -up. The investigator should make every 
effort to ensure that follow -up includes any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to 
elucidate, as completely as practical, the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. This may include unscheduled follow up visits for AE assessment.  
Study subject s will be instructed to report all AEs to the clinical study staff.  AE information 
will be collected throughout the study, and recorded on CRFs.  
8.6 Severity of Adverse E vents  
The severity of adverse events  will be ca tegorized using the following criteria:  
• Mild:  easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering 
with everyday activities. These events generally do not require treatment.  
• Moderate:  sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
These vents are usually relieved by [CONTACT_14212].  
• Severe:   prevents normal, everyday activities.  These events may require systemic drug 
therapy or other medical treatment.  
8.7 Relationship to the Study D evice and /or P rocedure 
The relationship to the study device and/or  procedure will be determined by [CONTACT_148132]: 
 
• Not Related:  An event for which an alternative explanation is conclusively identified –  
e.g., concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), and/or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is highly  unlikely.  
 
• Related : The adverse event follows a reasonable temporal sequence related to treatment 
by [CONTACT_8121], follows a known or suspected response pattern and a plausible alternative etiology cannot be identified. 
 
J-Plasma Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1558, Rev. No. 2         Novembe r 5, 2018  
Confidential    Page 23 of 36 
 • Undetermined : The relation of the ad verse event has some temporal relationship  to the 
device and/or device procedure , is not clearly due to another condition and the 
involvement of the study device is unknown.  
 
9 RISK AND BENEFITS  
9.1 Benefits  
A possible  benefit of usi ng J-Plasma  is the potential for improvement in wrinkle severity.   
Additional potential benefits of improving the appearance of wrinkles could include enhanced 
well-being, with improved satisfaction with the appearance of less facial wrinkles or the 
perception of a havin g a more youthful appearance.  
9.2 Risks  
Potential risks with J-Plasma  are similar to those that are encountered for many routine facial 
soft tissue reduc tions.  These include but are not limited to:  
• pain, 
• tenderness,  
• itching,  
• bleeding,  
• bruising/ hematoma/seroma,  
• allergic reaction,   
• hypersensitivity to the treatment (resulting in erythema, swelling, induration and/or 
urticaria),  
• post-inflammatory hyperpi[INVESTIGATOR_371],  
• telangiectasias,  
• skin overheating/burn,  
• hypertrophic scarring  
• calcification,  
• discoloration/ permanent hypopi[INVESTIGATOR_371],  
• loss of correction,  
• vessel laceration or o cclusion,  
• abscess at treatment  site which may result in induration and/or scar formation, and 
• prolonged wound healing.   
Subject s using drugs that reduce coagulation (aspi[INVESTIGATOR_49267]) may experience increased 
bruising or bleeding at the treatment site.  
Additionally, other wrinkle reduction  products have shown rare occurrences of the following 
symptoms:  
• systemic events such as flu -like symptoms (such as fever, headac he, myalgia, neuralgia, 
nausea, malaise or dizziness),  
• pruritis,  
• shedding,  
• flaking,

 • scaling,  
• peeling,  
• rash,  
• transient visual disturbances (blurred vision),  
• tingling,  
• numbness,  
• transient polyarthralgia,  
• infection,   
• anaphylactic response (hypotension, difficulty breathing, tightne ss in chest, and/or 
shortness of  breath).

Each enrolling site  will be visited at least annually.  During a m onitoring visit, the M onitor will 
evaluate the site’s compliance with regulatory and protocol requirements, verify data recorded 
on CRFs to available source documents, etc.  
In addition, the M onitor will check whether all AEs and SAEs have been reported appropriately 
within the time periods required.  
Data Clarification Forms (DCFs) will be created for identified errors on CRFs that have been 
submitted to the S ponsor to ensure errors /omissions  are corrected.  New and previous findings 
and recommended correct ive and preventative actions, if they exist, will be communicated with

 11 STATISTICAL METHODOLO GY 
This section describes the statistical analyses foreseen at the time of study planning.  
 
Any deviations from planned analyses, the reasons for such deviation, and all alternative or additional statistical analyses that may be performed before database close will be summarized in the C linical S tudy R eport.  
11.1 Determination of S ample S ize 
The objective of this study is to demonstrate that study participants positively respond to the J -
Plasma
® therapy, thus the primary endpoint will be assessed via the percentage of study 
participants that demonstrated an improvement in the FWS from baseline to the 3 -month visit.   
An improve ment is clinically important when there is  ≥ 1-score change.  The p lanned sample 
size to provide sufficient power for a statistical comparison of the proportion of treatment 
responders (P)  versus a reasonable cutoff (P 0) was based on a power calculation ut ilizing the 
(one proportion) binomial exact test based on the following assumptions.  
• H0: P ≤ P 0 versus H a: P > P 0 
• Type I error rate:  α = 0.05 (one -sided ) 
• Population proportion under the null hypothesis: P 0 = 0.75 
• Population proportion under the alternative hypothesis: P = 0.90 
• Total N: 50 study participants  
 Based on the above assumptions, the study power is estimated to be approximately 88%. To account for possible missing data (up to 10% attrition), a total of [ADDRESS_1144429] s will be enrolled.  
Other tests (i.e., a test of the mean improvement of FWS) would be expected to provide more 
power.  
 
One study investigating the effects of radiofrequency energy on the improvement of appearance 
of wrinkles and rhytides (De Novo, Newa
TM) utilized a FWS cuto ff as 75%, supporti ng this 
value  in the present sample size computation .[13] 
11.2 Analysis S ets 
The f ull analysis s et (FAS)  will be used for analysis of this  study.  
11.2.1  Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
All subject s enrolled in the study who have a FWS value at baseli ne will be included  in 
the FAS .  Subjects  with missing FWS data at the  3-month visit will be imputed as no 
change and included in the FAS population.  
11.2.2  Per Protocol Set (PPS)  
The PPS is the subset of subject s in the FAS without major protocol deviations. Major 
protocol deviations will be decided and finalized at a data review meeting (DRM) that 
will be conducted prior to database lock. The efficacy analyses will be repeated on the 
PP population if there is at least a 10% difference in the numbe r of subject s in the PP S 
and intent -to-treat ( ITT) populations. 
J-Plasma Dermal Resurfacing Study, VP -1558, Rev. No. [ADDRESS_1144430] s (i.e. 
percentage of treatment responders) with a ≥  1-score  improvement on the FWS at the 3-
month visit, as compared to baseline  as determined by [CONTACT_2669] 2 out of 3 blinded 
Independent Photographic Reviewers .  The study design assumes a 75% success rate of  
subjects with  treated wrinkles with a ≥  1-score change on the FWS; therefore, greater 
than 75% of subject s must be rated with a ≥  1-score improvement [ADDRESS_1144431] be statistically significantly greater than 75%.  
11.3.2   Secondary E fficacy E ndpoint  
Subjects with a ≥ [ADDRESS_1144432] a self -reported 
“improved” rating on the modified GAIS at the [ADDRESS_1144433]  Diary (see Appendix C: Subject Diary) , will be 
summarized . A descriptive analysis  including type, onset after treatment, dur ation, 
severity, and relationship to study device and/or procedure  will be provided. With the 
same descriptive methodology, the duration of adverse events will be summarized with a 
delineation from 0- [ADDRESS_1144434]  on a 10- point visual analog scale (VAS) . Results of 
the VAS on a scale of 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain) and the change from baseline 
will be summarized descriptively utilizing  mean, standard deviation, minimum, 
maximum, median, and the 95% confidence interval of the mean and mean change from 
baseline.   
11.5 Additional  Endpoints  
Other  endpoints to be evaluated include:  
 
1. FWS ≥ 1 -score improvement and ≥ 75% agreement with at least an “improved” rating by 
[CONTACT_825200]. The modified GAIS is a measure of aesthetic 
improvement relative to the baseline, pre -treatment condition.  
2. Magnitude of improvement measured by [CONTACT_541403] 3-month visit.  
3. Subject  satisfaction with procedure recorded at the 3- month visit.

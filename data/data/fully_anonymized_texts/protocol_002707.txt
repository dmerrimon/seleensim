WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 5 of 32	Background:	
Diabetes	mellitus	and	its	comorbidities	are	currently	a	global,	public	health	crisis,	with	
approximately	30	million	people	diagnosed	with	diabetes	and	an	estimated	80	million	
additional	people	with	prediabetes	in	the	US	alone.	Although	diabetes	is	a	multif actorial	
disease,	it	is	widely	believed	that	the	proliferation	of	diabetes	worldwide	can	be	largely	attributed	to	the	adoption	of	the	Western	diet.	Recently,	research	has	shown	that	the	use	of	
the	Western	diet	has	significant	impacts	on	the	gut	microbiome,	altering	both	the	
composition	and	activities	of	that	microbiome	(The	microbiome	refers	to	the	bacteria,	viruses,	fungi,	phage,	and	other	microorganisms	that	reside	in	the	human	intestine).		
An	individual’s	gut	microbiome	contains	[ADDRESS_1219758]’s	genome.	There	is	increasing	evidence	that	the	gut	microbiome	offers	
an	opportunity	for	the	development	of	novel	interventions	for	a	variety	of	diseases	by	
[CONTACT_873231].	Specific	bacterial	strains	in	the	gut	microbiome	ferment	indigestible	dietary	fibers	in	the	colon	to	produce	short	chain	fatty	
acids	(SCFAs),	such	as	acetate,	propi[INVESTIGATOR_16847],	and	butyrate	(Nohr -2013).		Use	of	the	Western	
diet	leads	to	a	reduction	in	both	the	number	and 	density	of	butyrate -producing	microbes.	
SCFAs,	and	butyrate	in	particular,	bind	to	the	G	protein-coupled	receptors,	GPR119,	GPR41	
and	GPR43,	which	trigger	the	downstream	signaling	pathway	for	GLP-1,	a	hormone	known	to	play	a	key	role	in	the	development	and	progression	of	diabetes.	These	observations	lead	
to	a	hypothesis	that	replenishing	the	content	of	butyrate	microbes	in	the	intestinal	tracts	of	
these	individuals	will	have	beneficial	metabolic	effects.			
Whole	Biome	has	developed	a	proprietary	discovery	platform	to	identify,	characterize	and	
manufacture	beneficial	bacterial	strains.	Whole	Biome	is	developi[INVESTIGATOR_007]	a	medical	food	
containing	a	subset	of	commensal	butyrate-producing	strains	and	mucin	regulating	strains	
that	can	be	grown	under	controlled	conditions 	that	meet	the	standards	for	Current	Good	
Manufacturing	Practice	(cGMP),	thus	allowing	them	to	be	administered	to	humans.			
	
Purpose:		
The	goal	of	this	study	is	to	characterize	the	performance	of	a	Continuous	Glucose	Monitoring	
System	in	medical	food	studies.	The	 Freestyle	Libre(™)	Glucose	Sensors1	will	be	used	to	follow	
subjects	 10-day	 glucose	 trajectories	 over	 the	 course	 of	 a	 5-week,	 double -blind,	 placebo -
controlled,	2x2	crossover,	medical	 food	experiment.	The	medical	food	has	been	designed	to	
increase	butyrate	production	and	promote	the	health	of	the	colonic	mucin	layer.

All	ingredients	contained	in	the	study	product	formulations	used	in	this	study	have	received	
Generally	Recognized	as	Safe	(GRAS)	designation.	They	are	commensal	or ganisms	that	have	
been	documented	in	multiple	studies	to	inhabit	the	human	GI	tract	of	healthy	individuals.		The	 organisms	 were	 grown	 under	 controlled	 conditions	 consistent	 with	 Current	 Good	
Manufacturing	Practices	(cGMP)	and	employ	no	animal-derived	products.		The	microbes	and	
all	 ingredients	 utilized	 during	 manufacturing	 were	 food	 grade	 and	 qualified	 as	 Generally	
Recognized	 as	 Safe	 (GRAS).	 	 Each	 of	 the	 microbes	 have	 been	 characterized	 in	 detail	(including	whole	genome	sequencing).		Each	manufactured	lot	has	also	been	tested	with	
standard	methods	to	ensure	the	absence	of	toxins,	heavy	metals,	etc.	
All	strains	have	also	been	tested	 in	vivo	 in	a	diet -induced	obese	mouse	model	and	Sprague-
Dawley	rats.		Each	of	these	rodent	models	were	dosed	for	28	days	at	multiples	≥60	times	
(based	on	body	weight)	the	amounts	being	administered	in	this	study.		In	each	study,	safety	was	 evaluated	 by	 [CONTACT_873232],	 routine	 chemistry,	 and	 hematology	 parameters,	 in	
addition	to	necropsy	evaluation	at	study	conclusion.		In	bot h	studies,	no	clinical,	laboratory,	
or	necropsy	observations	were	observed	that	suggest	adverse	effects. 			
In	addition,	a	5 -person	safety	study	was	conducted	with	administration	of	3	strains	for	14	
days.	No	adverse	events	or	tolerability	issues	were	reported .	
Finally,	 both	 formulations 	being	 utilized	 in	 this	 study	 (WBF -0009	 and	 WBF -0011)	 are	
currently	 being	 evaluated	 in	 an	 ongoing	 multi-site,	 double -blind,	 placebo -controlled,	
medical-food	trial.	 	This	 ongoing	 study	 is	testing	the	product	in	 approximately	 [ADDRESS_1219760]	 up	to	12	weeks	 of	exposure	(in	a	12-week	trial ).	There	have	been	no	reports	of	
significant	related	adverse	events	in	this	study	to	date.

An	adverse	event	is	considered	"Serious"	if,	in	the	view	of	either	the	investigator	or	
sponsor,	it	results	in	any	of	the	following	outcomes: 	
● Death	
● A	life-threatening	adverse	event

WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, 2018 Page 19 of 32	Unexpected	Adverse	Event		
An	adverse	event	is	considered	“unexpected”	if	it	is	not	listed	in	the	study	
product	data	information	document	or	is	not	listed	at	the	specificity	or	
severity	that	has	been	 previously	 observed. 	
FDA	guidelines	recognize	that:	
1. “Individual	adverse	event	reports	generally	require	an	evaluation	of	their	relevance	and	significance 	to	the	study,	including	an	evaluation	of	
other	adverse	events,	before	they	can	be	considered	an	unanticipated	problem,”		
and	
2. “All	reports	to	the	IRB	of	unanticipated	problems	should	explain	
clearly	why	the	event	described	represents	a	‘problem’	for	the	study	
and	why	it	is	‘unanticipated.’’ 	
Investigators	are	required	to	report	unexpected	adverse	events	that	fit	the	
following	criteria	 within	10	working	days	 of	the	time	the	investigator	has	
become	informed	of	the	event(s)	to	the	IRB	if	applicable 	and	sponsor. 	
The	following	guidelines	provide	further	definition	to	unexpected	adverse	
events:	
• Event	is	 unexpected	(in	terms	of	nature,	severity,	or	frequency)	
given	(a)	the	research	procedures	that	are	described	in	the	protocol -related	documents,	such	as	the	IRB-	approved	research	
protocol	and	informed	consent	form,	or	the	investigator	brochure;	and	(b)	the	characteristics	of	the	subject	population	being	studied, 	
• Related	or	possibly	related	to	participation	in	the	research	
(possibly	related	means	there	is	a	reasonable	possibility	 that	the	
incident,	experience,	or	outcome	may	have	been	caused	by	[CONTACT_201629]);	and 	
• Suggests	that	the	research	 places	subjects	or	others	at	a	
greater	risk	of	harm	(including	physical,	psychological,	
economic,	or	social	harm)	than	was	previously	known	or	recognized. 	
If	the	adverse	event	is	clearly	not	related	to	the	study	food	product,	device,	procedures,	or	washout	process,	it	would	not	represent	a	risk	to	other	
subjects	in	the	research	or	a	“problem”	for	the	study	and,	therefore,	does	
CONFIDENTIAL  
WB01 -205 Version 1.0/Amendment_1  May 25, [ADDRESS_1219786]	to	be	reported	to	the	IRB. 	
1. Intensity 	
The	intensity	of	each	adverse	event	will	be	characterized	as	mild,	moderate,	or	
severe,	as	follows: 	
● MILD:	Usually	transient,	requires	no	special	treatment,	and	does	not	interfere	with	the	subject’s	daily	activities. 	
● MODERATE:	Usually	causes	a	low	level	of	inconvenience	or	concern	to	the	
subject	and	may	interfere	with	daily	activities,	but	is	usually	ameliorated	
by	[CONTACT_201630].	
● SEVERE:	Interrupts	a	subject’s	usual	daily	activities	and	generally	requires	systemic	drug	therapy	or	other	treatment.	
2. Causality	
The	investigator	will	grade	the	association	of	the	adverse	event	as	UNRELATED	or	RELATED	to	study	medication.	The	following	criteria	should	
be	considered	for	determining	relatedness: 	
• UNRELATED:	The	adverse	event	is	judged	to	be	produced	by	[CONTACT_620244]'s	clinical	state	or	by	[CONTACT_873240][INVESTIGATOR_873227].	
• RELATED:	The	adverse	event	is	judged	to	be	related	to	the	
administration	of	study	medication.	
N.	Data	Management: 	
All	data	collected	will	be	entered	onto	standardized	Case	Report	Forms	(CRFs)	and	entered	
into	a	database	that	will	allow	summaries	and	the	statis tical	analyses	outlined	in	the	
statistical	analysis	plan	to	be	conducted.		Upon	conclusion	of	the	study,	all	materials	will	be	archived. 	
O.	Statistical	Considerations: 	
Analysis	Populations: 	
	
● Intent-To-Treat	(ITT):	The	ITT	Population	will	include	all	randomized	subjects	who	
receive	at	least	one	portion	of	randomized	study	product,	i.e.	Placebo	(WBF -0009)	or	
WBF -0011.	
● Evaluable: 	The	evaluable	population	will	include	all	ITT	subjects	who	have	had	adequate	
exposure	to	the	randomized	study	product	during	the	5 -week	treatment	period.

adverse	events	will	be	collected	for	subjects	who	terminate	early	from	the	study	until	the	time	of	their	withdrawal.		
All	adverse	events	will	be	tabulated	and	ordered	by	[CONTACT_873241].	If	appropriate,	the	incidence	of	adverse	events	will	be	compared	by	[CONTACT_3493]’s	
exact	test.	Special	attention	will	be	given	to	subjects	who	discontinue	treatment	because	of	
adverse	events. 		
Additionally,	treatment	emergent	adverse	events	(TEAEs)	of	special	interest,	i.e.,	specif ic

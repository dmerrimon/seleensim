(Sunol-cH36) in Subjects with Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_333168]/Study Centers: This study was conducted at 12 sites in the [LOCATION_002] and 5 sites in Canada. 
Publications: None 
Study Period:  16 Dec 2004 to 30 July 2006 Phase of development:  I/IIa 
Objectives: The objectives of this study were: 
xTo evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of six dose levels of TNX-832 
(0.06 mg/kg, 0.08 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg) in 
subjects with suspected or proven bacteria-induced ALI/ARDS.
xTo evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of six dose levels of TNX-832 (0.06 mg/kg, 0.08 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, 0.3 mg/kg, and 0.4 mg/kg) in subjects with suspected or proven bacteria-induced ALI/ARDS.
Methodology:  This multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded dose-escalation study was to evaluate TNX-832 in subjects with suspected or proven bacteria-induced acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505] (ARDS).  Five cohorts of at least six subjects each were originally planned.  Subjects were to be randomized in a 5:[ADDRESS_411951] (DSMB) review of adverse events in the 0.1 mg/kg in led to an observation of probably-related hematuria in all subjects who received TNX-832 at 0.1 mg/kg.  This review required the studying of TNX-832 at a lower dose cohort than previously planned.  One additional cohort (0.08 mg/kg) of at least 6 subjects was planned.  Additionally, the DSMB recommended administering study drug through a slow IV infusion (over 2 hours; 50 cc/hr). In September, 2006, upon a subsequent DSMB review of adverse events in the 0.08 mg/kg dose group, a decision was made to prematurely discontinue the study.
Subject Population:  Eligible subjects were 18 years of age or older with a suspected or proven bacterial infection.  Subjects were also required to: 1). Have a diagnosis of acute lung injury/acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_333169]/ARDS; 2). be receiving positive pressure ventilation through an endotracheal tube;  and  3). provide signed informed consent, authorization in accordance with the Health Inisurance Portability Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and agree to comply with all protocol-specified procedures and evaluations.

Title:  The Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamic Effects of TNX-832 
(Sunol-cH36) in Subjects with Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respi[INVESTIGATOR_333170]: Subjects were to be randomized in a 5:1 ratio to receive TNX-832 or placebo, respectively, administered as a single bolus infusion over 15 minutes.  The TNX-832 dose for each cohort dosed was:
xCohort 1: 0.06 mg/kg TNX-832 
xCohort 2: 0.1 mg/kg TNX-832 
xCohort 3: 0.08 mg/kg TNX-832 
The original planned dose in Cohort 3 was .2 mg/kg. This was lowered to 0.08 mg/kg following a recommendation by [CONTACT_333177] a review of adverse events in Cohort 2.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Pharmacokinetics:  The following PK parameters were to be determined: C max
(maximum serum concentration), T max (time to maximum serum concentration), AUC last
(area under the serum concentration-time curve from the time of dosing to the time of 
the last observed concentration), AUC f (area under the serum concentration-time curve 
from the time of dosing extrapolated to infinity), CL (serum clearance), V d (apparent 
volume of distribution at elimination phase), V ss (apparent volume of distribution at 
steady state), t 1/2 (terminal elimination phase half life). 
Pharmacodynamics: Sample for the following inflammatory markers were collected but 
not analyzed: C-reactive protein [CRP], IL-6, IL-8, IL-1 ȕ, and TNF- Į.
Safety: Safety assessments performed during this study included adverse events, clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, hematoccult), vital signs measurements (body temperature, heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], blood pressure), physical examinations and electrocardiograms.  Additional assessments included arterial blood gases, ventilation assessments, chest radiograph, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_333171], and immunogenicity. 
Statistical Methods: Serum concentration and pharmacokinetic parameters were to be summarized by [CONTACT_333178]. Parametric and/or non-parametric statistical comparisons were to be done if suggested by [CONTACT_26739], but were not performed.  Continuous data variables were summarized by [CONTACT_19462], mean and its standard error, median, standard deviation , minimum, and maximum values.  PD samples were not analyzed as the data were not anticipated to provide any meaningful information about the action of the study drug.  Safety evaluations were based on the incidence, intensity and type of AEs and clinically si

Summary: 
Number of Subjects: Eighteen subjects were assigned to study treatment.  Two subjects were withdrawn from the study following administration of study drug.  Subject 10-005 died during the study.  The death occurred after removal of respi[INVESTIGATOR_333173]; the death was determined by [CONTACT_333179].  Subject 08-002 withdrew consent 48 days after administration of 0.06 mg/kg TNX-832.

Safety Results:  There was one death during the study.  Subject [ADDRESS_411952] died 10 days after administration of 0.08 mg/kg TNX-832.  The death was considered unrelated to study medication by [CONTACT_737].  Four subjects experienced non-fatal SAEs during the study, including bilateral pulmonary embolism, hypoxic respi[INVESTIGATOR_333174]-acquired pneumonia, worsening acute renal failure, and worsening anemia and empyema.  Of these SAEs, the hypoxic respi[INVESTIGATOR_333174]-acquired pneumonia in one subject was considered possibly related to study medication. The worsening anemia and empyema in one subject were considered possibly related to study medication, with empyema considered unrelated at the time of resolution.  Of the

18 subjects enrolled in this study, 16 subjects reported a total of 87 AEs during the study.  Of the 87 treatment-emergent AEs in this study, 48 (55%) AEs were moderate in intensity, 35 (40%) AEs were mild in intensity, and 4 (5%) AEs were severe in intensity.Of the 87 treatment-emergent AEs, 16 AEs were considered by [CONTACT_188763].  Two AEs were considered related to placebo 
administration; 3 AEs were considered related to 0.06 mg/kg TNX-832 administration; 5 
AEs were considered related to 0.1 mg/kg TNX-832 administration; 6 AEs were considered related to 0.08 mg/kg TNX-832 administration.  A summary of treatment-emergent AEs is presented in the table below.

Conclusions:
This study was prematurely discontinued due to the high incidence of hematuria (nine 
occurrences) during the study.  All instances of hematuria were experienced by [CONTACT_333180]. In this study, the most frequent AEs were hematuria (n=9) and anemia (n=6).  At the highest dose level of TNX-832 administered during this study (0.1 m
g/kg), all five sub jects dosed had AEs of hematuria.  He maturia was considered

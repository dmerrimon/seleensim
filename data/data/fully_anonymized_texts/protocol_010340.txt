MulticEnter trial of Rivaroxaban for early disCharge of pUlmonaRY embolism from the Emergency 
Department (MERCURY PE)
Rivaroxaban (JNJ-39039039; BAY 59-7939) is an oral anticoagulant. The mechanism of action of 
rivaroxaban is to selectively andtodirectly inhibit Factor Xa , which plays a central role in the cascade of 
blood coagulation by [CONTACT_495075]. Rivaroxaban does not require metabolic conversion 
or a cofactor to exert its activity.
Rivaroxaban is marketed under the trade name [CONTACT_495116]®and has been approved for multiple 
indications worldwide, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). In recent 
years, the ability to rapi[INVESTIGATOR_495015] .The primary objective of this study is to 
determine if patients diagnosed with PE and identified as being at low risk of clinical deterioration may 
be safely discharged from the Emergency Department (ED )and treate d with rivaroxaban as outpatients . 
OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS
Primary Objective
The primary objective of the study istodemonstrate that low risk PE patients who aredischarged from 
the ED to the home environment and treated with rivaroxaban as outpatients have fewer total days in the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495016]/or venous thromboembolism ( VTE )events through Day [ADDRESS_636668] -of-care. 
Secondary Objective
The secondary objective of the study is to assess the reoccurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed 
VTE, defined as recurrent PE or new or recurrent DVT (including symptomatic upper extremity DVT) or 
VTE related death within 90 days of randomization.
Exploratory Objective
The exploratory objective of this study is to evaluate patient outcomes by [CONTACT_495076] : 
The clinical hypothesis is that an early discharge strategy for low risk PE patients, identified in theED, 
and discharged to the home environment andtreated with rivaroxaban as outpatients will result in fewer 
days in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495016]/or VTE events through Day [ADDRESS_636669]-of- care. 
Safety:
The safety hypothesis is thatmajor bleeding rates as assessed by [CONTACT_495077] (ISTH )criteria at [ADDRESS_636670] -of-care strategies .

Approved , Date: 16 June 2015OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN
This is a randomized, open -label, parallel -group, multi center study conducted in the [LOCATION_002] (US) . 
Eligible subjects will include men and women, [ADDRESS_636671] a confirmed diagnosis 
of acute symptomatic PE with or without symptomatic DVT. Approximately 300 PE subjects presenting 
to the ED and assessed asbeing atlow risk of clinical deterioration using the Hestia criteria will be 
randomized in a 1:1ratio to one of two treatment strategies: 1) rivaroxaban and discharge from the ED to 
the home environment or 2) standard-of- care (as per local protocol and defined by [CONTACT_495078]). All subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_636672] s with PE 
who are at low risk for subsequent clinical deterioration and who are candidate sfor anticoagulant
treatment on an outpatient basis.  
The study consists of a Screening and Randomization Period, followed by a 90-day open -label treatment 
period, and an end-of-study/early withdrawal (EOS) visit.  The duration of study participation for each 
subject is approximately [ADDRESS_636673] be randomized within 12 hours after the confirmation 
of PEdiagnosis . All bleeding events (ISTH major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events),
efficacy events (VTE related death, recurren ce of PE ornew or recurrent DVT ) and all deaths during the 
study will be adjudicated in a blinded manner by a Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC) .  Events will be 
adjudicated throughout the entire 90 days of randomized treatment. The CEC will independently review 
clinical events data as they become available, and will adjudicate and will classify deaths, bleeding 
events, and recurrence of PE and new or recurrent DVT in a consistent and unbiased manner.
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the progress of the study andwill
ensure the safety ofstudy subjects .An Executive Committee will be established and will review
recommendations from the DMC regarding safety analyses and/or study modifications andwill oversee 
implementation, ifnecessary, of these study modifications. In addition a Study Coordinator Operational 
Committee will be established to provide input to the opera tional logistics regarding study design and 
conduct of the study .
The frequency and timing of efficacy, safety , and other measurements are provided in the Time and 
Events Schedule.
SUBJECT POPULATION
Eligible subjects are men or women, [ADDRESS_636674]-of- care with imaging techniques such asComputed Tomography ,
Pulmonary Angiography or Pulmonary Ventilation/P erfusion scan.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Subjects will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment strategies in a 1:1 ratio:
 Rivaroxaban at an initial dose of [ADDRESS_636675] 21 days
followed by a dose of 20 mg taken orally once daily with food, at approximately the same time each 
dayfor approximately 69 days for a total treatment duration of 90 days.
OR
 Standard-of- care (per local protocol and defined by [CONTACT_495079] )

Approved , Date: 16 June 2015Missed Dose
If a dose of rivaroxaban is not taken at the scheduled time, administer the dose as soon as possible on the 
same day as follows:
 For subjects receiving 15 mg twice daily: The subject should take rivaroxaban immediately to ensure 
intake of [ADDRESS_636676] should continue with the 15 mg twice daily regimen on the following day.
 For subjects receiving 20 mg once daily: The subject should take the missed rivaroxaban dose
immediately.
EFFICACY EVALUATIONS/ENDPOINTS
Primary Endpoint
The primary clinical endpoint is the number of days of initial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (beginning from 
randomization to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) plus any subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (s)related to bleeding 
and/or VTE events up to 30 days .
Secondary Endpoint s
 Reoccurrence of symptomatic, objectively confirmed VTE, defined as recurrent PE or new or 
recurrent DVT (including symptomatic upper extremity DVT) or VTE related death within 90 days 
of randomization .
 Number of unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495017]/or bleeding through 
90 days.
 Length of initial and subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (s)for any reason through Day 90 .
 Patient -reported outcome swill be captured atDay 7for Site-of-Care Satisfaction andon Days 14,
30,and 90 for Anti-Clot Treatment Scale .
 Length of initial and subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495018], VTE related re-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (s)due to 
recurrence will be economically evaluated.

BIOMARKER EVALUATIONS
A blood sample for biom arkers will be collec ted at screening from all subjects who give their consent for 
this blood sample . Biomarker samples will be used for research related to rivaroxaban, analysis of 
molecules involved in the clotting pathway, study comedications, and/or PE. They may also be used to 
develop tests/assays related to rivaroxaban, study comedications ,or PE. 
Patient -Reported Outcomes
Treatment and Site -of-C are satisfaction will be assessed. At follow -up visits Day 14, Day 30, and Day 90 
treatment satisfaction will be assessed using a validated measure for treatment satisfaction: the ACTS. 
The Satisfaction to Site-of-Care questionnaire (standard-of- care versus early discharge on rivaroxaban 
therapy) will be administered after 7 days on anticoagulant therapy.
The ACTS is comprised of two 2 subscales: Burdens (12 items) and Benefits (3 items). The treatment 
experience scores range from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Extremely’ on a five-point Likert scale (psychometric 
rating); higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.

SAFETY EVALUATIONS/ENDPOINTS 
Safety Evaluations
All bleeding events will be captured as an Adverse Event of special interest.
 Primary safety:  ISTH major bleeding
 Secondary safety: Clinically relevant non -major bleeding
Primary Safety Endpoint
The primary safety endpoint is ISTH major bleeding at Day 90.
Secondary Safety Endpoints
The sec ondary safety endpoints are VTE related death within 90 days of randomization and overall safety 
defined as a composite of ISTH major bleeding, clinically relevant non -major bleeding, and mortality.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Following pragmatic considerations, the sample size forthis study was determined using assumptions 
related to the expected number ofdays of initial inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (beginning from randomization 
to discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]) and any subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (s)related to bleeding and/or VTE 
events up to 30 days. A large -sample confidence interval (CI)approach was used to determine the sample 
size required for estimating the difference in mean length of stay between the two randomized groups. 
From Aujesky et al. 2011; the standard deviation is 1dayfortheoutpatient group and 3.1 days forthe
inpatient group from the initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408]. From the available data, the average number ofdays of 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495022] 2 days and the percentage of patients with VTE related 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_440525] 5%. With this information, the contribution from VTE related hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495023] s received from theinitial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495024]. A total of a 150 subjects per group will provide a 
two-sided 95% CIwith about a0.[ADDRESS_636677] e size estimate will also allow an examin ation of the difference in the recurrence of VTE 
events in the 2randomized groups. The incidence of recurrent VTE events is generally low and largely 
infrequent among low-risk PE patients. In the Aujesky et al. 2011 study, the 90-day recurrence rates of 
VTE among both inpatients and outpatients were reported to be less than 1% (with a 95% upper 
confidence limit = 2.7%).

Rivaroxaban (JNJ-39039039; BAY 59-7939) is an oral, direct acting, Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor 
anticoagulant that has been under development for the treatment of several thrombosis -mediated 
conditions. Rivaroxaban is marketed under the trade name [CONTACT_495116]®and has been approved 
for multiple indicati ons worldwide. The clinical development program for rivaroxaban is 
extensive. As of [ADDRESS_636680] version of the Investigator's Brochure and Addenda for rivaroxaban .14
The term "sponsor" used throughout this document refers to the entities listed in the Contact 
[CONTACT_23774](s), which will be provided as a separate document.
1.1. Background
Hemostasis is a normal physiological process following damage of the vascular system. In 
various diseases, however, the hemostatic mechanisms are inappropriately  activated with
pathological consequences causing thrombosis. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep 
vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary  embolism (PE), represents one of the most common
health problems in the [LOCATION_002] (US) .It is estimated thatmore than [ADDRESS_636681]
(VKA). When first initiated , warfarin required 4to 5 days to become effective and initial 
outpatient management was not possible as there would be an initial period where, despi[INVESTIGATOR_495027], there would be no functional anticoagulation. Therefore, for all patients 
requiring acute anticoagulation (eg, all new VTE diagnoses), hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495028], until warfarin became effective, was the only option available. With 
the advent and availability  of subcutaneousl y administered low molecular weight heparin 
(LMWH), a new option f or bridging until warfarin became effective was possible. Theoretically , 
since intravenous therapy  was no longer required, patients could avoid hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495029]-injection of LMWH. Unfortunatel y, because of a lack of educational resources, a nega tive 
reimbursement structure, and general patient resistance to self-injection, the use of LMWH to 
avoid initial hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495030] y poorl y adopted in the US .

terminal elimination half-life of rivaroxaban is 5 to 9 hours in healthy  young subjects and from

pathway s of rivaroxaban, there are few clinicall y relevant drug -drug i nteractions.
Rivaroxaban has been under development and is approved for the treatment of several 
thrombosis mediated conditions. The clinical development program for rivaroxaban is extensive

0.44 to 1.04).  The rate of major and non-major clinically  relevant bleeding was the same in both 
groups (8.1%).
The EINSTEIN PE study is the largest single -agent study ever conducted for the treatment of 
symptomatic PE.8In this multicenter , randomized , open -label, non-inferiority  study, 4,[ADDRESS_636687] s were treated for a period of 3, 6 ,or 12 months (based on a clinical evaluation 
of individual risk for recurrent thrombosis and bleeding) with either rivaroxaban [ADDRESS_636688] approach of 
enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily transitioning to a VKA (INR of 2.0to 3.0) started no later than 
48hours after randomization .  Rivaroxaban was non -inferior to enoxaparin/VKA for the primary 
efficacy  endpoint of recurrent symptomatic VTE (fatal plus non-fatal PE and/or DVT; 2.1% 
versus 1.8%, P=0.003 for non -inferiority ). The principal safety  outcome of major plus non -major 
clinically  relevant bleeding occurred with a similar incidence in both study  arms, but major 
bleeding occurred significant ly less frequentl y among subject streated with rivaroxaban as 
compared to the enoxaparin/VKA group (1.1% versus 2.2% respectivel y,P = 0.003).
The EINSTEIN extension study  (n=1,[ADDRESS_636689] s) evaluated if extended duration of rivaroxaban 
administration (20 mg taken once daily or 6to 12 mo nths) in subject s who had previousl y

rivaroxaban -treated subject s versus 7.1% of the placebo-treated subject s (p≤0.001 for 
superiority ). There was no significant difference for the principal safety  endpoint of major 
bleeding (0.7% in the rivaroxa ban versus 0% in placebo subjects, p=0.112).

aAtotal point score for a given patient is obtained by [CONTACT_495088]'s age in years and the points for each applicable 
prognostic variable. The five following risk classes are defined based on patients' total point score: class 1 ( ≤65 points), class 
II (65 -85 points), class III (86 -105 points), class IV (106 -125 points), and class V (>125 points). Patients in risk classes I/II 
are considered low risk.
bA total point score for a given patient is obtained by [CONTACT_495089]. Patients 
with [ADDRESS_636693] number of PE patients who are very low risk candidates for early discharge is 
unknown, a recent review of the National Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_62339] 
(NHAMCS; a nationally representative weighted sampling of U.S. ED visits) evaluated adult 
patients with a primary  diagnosis of PE.23It is suggested that a large early  discharge of thePE 
candidate population may exist. In this analy sis of 625 million US hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495033] 2006 to 
2010, an estimat ed 394,000 admissions were for PE. Due tothe medications required during this 
time (heparin bridging to warfarin therapy ), few PE cases were discharged from the ED and 
overall admission rates were extremel y high (90%). However, only 16% of patients requir ed 
treatment in an intensive care unit, a fact which demonstrated no significant changes over time. 
This suggests that the overwhelming major ity of PE cases were cared for on a regular hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495034] a monitored environment, a location which, except forthe addition of monitoring and 
providing IV therap y (as required for heparin bridging), provides little additional care for the low 
risk PE patient.
The recent availability  of rapid onset oral anticoagulants now creates a scenario where multiple 
days of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495035] . To determine the 
relative size of the cohort of candidate patients that potentially  can be managed in an outpatient 
environment, Singer A, et al, applied the PESI  score to the NHAMCS databa se.24The results 
demonstrated that overall 161,540 (41%) patients had a very low (13%, n=51,220) or low 
(28%, n=110,320) score. As low and very low PESI  score correlates with mortality  rates below
1%, this suggests that if an appropriate, safe, and effective therap y was available, nearl y half of 
PE patients could receive initial treatment in the ED with a rapid onset oral anticoagulant and 
then be discharged directly  from the ED, thus avoiding the risks and expense of in-hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495036] y.

warfarin) or rivaroxaban. Overall, 3,136 (64.9%) received therapy  within [ADDRESS_636695] therapy 
cohort, despi[INVESTIGATOR_495037]. These data strongly  support the consideration 
that early treatment and discharge from the ED could safel y avoid the unnecessary  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495038] -risk patients with PE.
Further, unlike warfarin, which is associated with coagulation parameter monitoring and dose 
adjustment difficulties; rivaroxaban does not require routine monitoring of coagulation 
parameters making it a more convenient option than warfarin.23These properties of rivaroxaban 
may enhance the option of outpa tient treatment for PE patients.5,8,19,33
The proposed MERCURY PE study  isdesigned to evaluate the number of day s of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
(from enrollment up to 30 day s) as well as overall safety of low risk PE patients discharged from 
the ED to the home environment and treated with rivaroxaban as outpatients as compared to 
those treated with standard-of- care.Patients with PE who are at low risk for adverse outcomes, 
as defined by a Hestia score of zero, and who are candidates for treatment with anticoagulants
including LMWH or any other approved new oral anticoagulant on an outpatient basis will be 
randomized to open label earl y ED discharge on rivaroxaban or standard therap y.
2. OBJECTIVE SAND HYPOTHESIS
2.1. Objectives
Primary Objective
The primary  objective of the study  is to demonstrate that low risk PE patients who are discharged 
from the ED to the home environment and treated with rivaroxaban as outpatients have fewer 
total daysin the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495016]/or VTE events through Day [ADDRESS_636696] -of-care.
Secondary Objective
The secondary  objective of the study  is to assess the reoccurre nce of symptomatic, objectively 
confirmed VTE, defined as recurrent PE or new or recurrent DVT (including symptomatic upper 
extremity  DVT) or VTE related death within 90 day s of randomization .
Exploratory Objective
The exploratory  objective of this study  is to evaluate patient outcomes b y baseline risk factors.

Approved , Date: 16 June [ZIP_CODE].2. Hypothesis
Clinical:
The clinical hypothesis is that an early  discharge strategy  for low risk PE patients, identified in 
theED, and discharged to the home environment and treated with rivaroxaban asoutpatients will 
result in fewer days in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495016]/or VTE events through Day [ADDRESS_636697]-of- care.
Safety:
The safet y hypothesis is that major bleeding rates as assessed by [CONTACT_495090] (ISTH)criteria at [ADDRESS_636698] s presenting to the ED and assessed as being at low risk of clinical deterioration using the 
Hestia criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment strategies: 1) rivaroxaban 
and discharge from the ED to the home environment or2) standard -of-care (as per local protocol 
and defined by  [CONTACT_495079]) . All subjects will be followed for [ADDRESS_636699] s meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will 
be eligible for en rollment.
The Hestia criteria are predefined, validated clinical criteria that can be used to identify  patients 
with PE who are at low risk for subsequent clinical deterioration and who are candidate sfor 
anticoagulant treatment on an outpatient basis.  
The study  consists of a Screening and Randomization Period, followed by a 90-day open-label 
treatment period, and an end of study /early withdrawal (EOS) visit. The duration ofstudy  
participation for each subject is approximately [ADDRESS_636700] be randomized within 12 hours after 
confirmation of PEdiagnosis . All bleeding events (ISTH major and clinically  relevant 
non-major bleeding events) and efficacy events (VTE related death, recurrence of PE or new or 
recurrent DVT) and all deaths during the study  will be adjudicated in a blinded manner by a 
Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC). Events will be adjudicated throughout the entire 90 days 
of randomized treatment. The CEC will independently  review clinic al events data as they 
become available, and will adjudicate and will classify  deaths, bleeding events, and recurrence of 
PE and new or recurrent DVT in a consistent and unbiased manner .

3.2. Study Design Rationale
Study Population
The study  population includes subjects with acute symptomatic PE with or without symptomatic 
DVT who are deemed to be at low risk of subsequent clinical deterioration . 
The exclusion criteria selected arederived from the Hestia study , a prospective cohort study
conducted in 12 hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495039] 2008 and 2010. The objective of the 
Hestia study was to confirm the results of several small observational cohort studies in a large 
study , and to demonstrate that the incidences of VTE recurrence, major bleeding ,and mortality 
are very low in patients selected for outpatient treatment with a simple set of exclusion criteria. 
The Hestia study  population included patients with objectively  proven acute PEwho were 
triaged with the predefined criteria for eligibility  for outpatient treatment, with LMWH 
(nadropa rin)followed by [INVESTIGATOR_266018]. Patients were deemed eligible for outpatient treatment if they

Approved , Date: 16 June 2015answered no to each of the exclusion criteria listed under exclusion criteria #1 (see Section 4.2) 
of this protocol. All patients eligible foroutpatient treatment were sent home either immediatel y 
orwithin [ADDRESS_636701] to recurrent VTE, including PE or DVT, major hemorrhage and mortality  during
3months of follow -up. Patients meeting the following inclusion criteria, were potentially  
eligible: over [ADDRESS_636702] 14 days, were not eligible for 
enrollment .The Hestia study  population experienced a 2% rate of VTE reoccurrence, a 1% rate 
of all-cause mortality , and a 0.7% rate of major bleeding by [CONTACT_4475] 90. These data suggest that the 
low-risk PE patients prospectively  identified using the Hestia inclusion criteria can be safely 
treated on an outpatient basis as demonstrated by [CONTACT_495091], mortality ,and 
bleeding.33
Rivaroxaban Dosage
The selected dose in this study is approved for the treatment of DVT and/or PE andfor the 
reduction in the risk of recurrence of DVT and of PE. Rivaroxaban will be administered per the 
[LOCATION_002] Package Insertat an initial dose of [ADDRESS_636703] 21 day s follow ed by a dose of 20 mg taken orally  once daily  with food, at approximately  the 
same time each day  for approximately  69 day s for a total duration of 90 day s.
Missed Dose
If a dose of rivaroxaban is not taken at the scheduled time, administer the dose as soon as 
possible on the same day as follows:
For subjects receiving 15 mg twice daily: The subject should take rivaroxaban immediatel y 
to ensure intake of [ADDRESS_636704] should contin ue with the 15 mg twice daily  regimen on the 
following day .
For subjects receiving 20 mg once daily : The subject should take the missed rivaroxaban 
dose immediately .
Patient -Reported Outcome 
The Anti- Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) is a validated measure ofpatient treatment satisfaction
that focuses on all aspects of anticoagulant treatment, both positive and negative. As part of the 
EINSTEIN DVT study ,patient sreported greater satisfaction in the rivaroxaban group compared 
with the enoxaparin/VKA group asdemonstrated by [CONTACT_495092].5The 
improved scores seen with rivaroxaban treatment consistently  across both tests provide further 
and more general support to the anticoagulation -specific effects seen with the ACTS scores 
alone.

Approved , Date: [ADDRESS_636705] dual- drug therapy , including few drug interactions, a lack of dietary  restrictions and no 
requirement for regular coagulation monitoring. Given that reduced treatment burden and 
regimen complexity  are associated with better compliance, the reduced burden and monotherapy 
approach associated with rivaroxaban may contribute to increasing patient adherence to 
anticoagulant treatment, thereb y improving clinical efficacy and outcomes in VTE patients.23
The Site-of-Care questionnaire is based on literature findings evaluating the location of care, ie, 
home versus hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]. This questionnaire assesses the patients’ satisfaction and preference to 
location of care received , as well as their overall satisfaction with the care provided.
Open -Label, Randomized Design 
An open -label study  design is appropriate as blinding is not practical under the proposed study 
design, nor is it necessary  when the main goal of the study  is to evaluate treatment strategies in 
low-risk PE patients. The clinical and safety  events in this study  will beevaluated and 
appropriatel y adjudicated by  a blinded CEC panel.
Randomization wil l be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment strategies
andto increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg,demographic and 
baseline characteristics) are evenl y balanced across treatment strategies.

EINSTEIN -Extension trials.
Given the extensive background of existing safety  data, only serious adverse events (SAE) , 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug, and adverse events of particular concern 
to the investigator (see Section s9.5,Safety  Evaluations and 12.1,Adverse Events Definitions )
will be collected in this study .
Biomarker Collection
A blood sample for biomarkers will be collected at screening from allsubjects who give their 
consent for this blood sample . Biomarker samples will be used for research related to 
rivaroxaban, analysis of molecules involved in the clotting pathway , study comedications , and/or 
PE. They  may  also be used to develop tests/assays related to rivaroxaban, study  comedications or 
PE.
Medical Resource Utilization andHealth Economics
Treatment of the anticoagulant disease state in patients with acute PEwith rivaroxaban versus 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495041] -of-care may result in lower length of stay (LOS) and 
unscheduled visits; therefore comparisons will be done across treatment strategies. Length of

interventions will be captured in the eCRF.  
Blood samples for exploratory  biomarker testing will be collected from those subjects who give 
permission for this sample ; see Section 9.3, Biomarkers , for additional information .
End of Treatment/Early Termination
Subjects will have an end -of-treatment/earl y withdrawal visit at Day 90, or at the time of early 
treatment discontinuation or early withdrawal. At this visit, investigators must ensure that all 
subjects are started on adequate anticoagulation ,as indicated, based upon local standards. 
Additional guidance is provided in Section 6.1, Temporary  Discontinuation of Study  Drugand 
Attachment 2.
Reasons for withdrawal from the study  are presented in Section 10.2, Withdrawal From the 
Study . If a subject permanently  withdraws before the end of the open -label treatment phase, he 
or she will have end -of-treatment/earl y withdrawal visit assessments perfor med as soon as 
possible and no more than [ADDRESS_636728] data collection point for endpoints in this study , with the exception of the 
patient’s vital status at what would have been the time of study  completion .
Subjects who do not complete the study  will have their vital status and any bleeding or VTE

Exploratory Endpoint
Outcomes b y baseline r isk factors will be evaluated.
9.3. Biomarkers 
A blood sample to evaluate troponin levels will be obtained at screening in order todetermine 
study  eligibility .
A blood sample will be collected forexploratory biomarker testing from allsubjects who give 
permission for this sample .Subjects who consent to this optional blood sample co llection will be 
asked to provide 1blood sample which will be stored and used for validation of a biomarker 
assay .
9.4. Patient -Reported Outcomes 
Treatment andSite-of-C are satisfaction will be asses sed. At follow -up visits Day 14,Day 30,
and Day 90 treatment satisfaction will be assessed using avalidat ed measure for treatment 
satisfaction: the ACTS .
The Satisfaction to Site-of-C arequestionnaire (standard-of- care versus early discharge on 
rivaroxaban therapy ) will be administered after 7 days on anticoagulant therapy .
(See Attachment 4)
The ACTS is comprised of 2subscales: Burdens (12 items) and Benefits (3 items). The treatment 
experience scores range from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Extremely ’ on a five-point Likert scale 
(psychome tric rating); higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with treatment.
Satisfaction to Site-of-C are(hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495019]) rates the patient’s level of 
satisfaction to care and location with care received as well as preference to location ofcare 
provided.  Patients rate the 3items of this scale of 1=Very  satisfied; 2=Quite satisfied; 
3=Neither; 4=Quite dissatisfied; and 5=Very dissatisfied for satisfaction questions and for the 
one preference question responses include 1=In the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307]; 2=In the community ; and 3=No

Results of clinical laboratory  testsfrom the local laboratory will be used at the screening visit to 
confirm eligibility  of potential subjects. 
Separate laboratory  tests will likely  be part of the subjects’ hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495056] , but are not 
required by [CONTACT_760] . No pre-specified laboratory  tests will be performed for the duration of 
the study . However, these subjects are likel y to have local laboratory  tests performed during their 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]. Any  labo ratory  test along with reference ranges relevant to a SAE or an outcome 
event should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page.
The following tests results with reference ranges will be obtained from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_54998] /local laboratory at the time of s creening and randomization:
Troponin
Serum creatinine (CrCl to be calculated using Cockcroft -Gault formula (See Attachment 5)
The investigator must review the laborat ory report, document this review, and record any 
clinically  relevant changes occurring during the study  in the AEsection of the eCRF. The 
laboratory  reports must be filed with the source documents.
Additional tests may be performed by [CONTACT_495102], but these results will not 
be captured in the eCRF unless a result constitutes an AE/SAE.
Electrocardiogram
If blood sampling or vital sign measurement is scheduled for the same time point as 
electrocardiogram (ECG )recording, the procedur es should be performed in the following order: 
ECG(s), vital signs, and blood draw.
Vital Signs : temperature, pulse/heart rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and blood pressure .
Physical Examination 
The extent of the physical examination will be conducted by [CONTACT_495084]-of-

10.1. Completion
A subject will be considered to have completed the study  if he or she has completed assessments 
at Day 90of the open -label phase or has experienced a clinical endpoint that precludes further 
continuation in the study. Subjects who prematurely  discontinue study  treatment for any reason 
before completion of the open -label phase will not be considered to have completed the study .
10.2. Withdrawal From the Study
A subject will be withdrawn from the stud y for any of the following reasons:
Lost to follow -up
Withdrawal of consent
Death
Noncompliance defined asany unexplained missed doses that result in the subject 's
returning more than 20% of the prescribed study  drug. The investigator should contact [CONTACT_495097] -compliance.
Discontinuation of study  treatment. A subject's study  treatment will be discontinued if:
The investigator or sponsor believes (eg,that for safet y or tolerabilit y reasons such as 
an adverse event) it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue treatment
The subject becomes pregnant
If a subject discontinues study  treatment before the end of Day 90,end-of-treatment assessments
should be obtained.
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort must be made by  [CONTACT_495103]/withdrawal. The measures 
taken to follow up must be documented.
When a subject withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be 
documented in the eCRF and in the source document. Study  drug assigned to the withdrawn 
subject may not be assigned to another subject. Subjects who withdraw will notbe replaced. If a 
subject withdraws from the study  early, the end -of-treatment assessments should be obtained.
A vital status (alive/dead) should be completed on all randomized subjects who do not complete 
the study , regardless of the reason for discontinuation. This vital status should be completed at 
what would have been at Day 90 (±5 days). If the final study  assessments are completed for an 
early discontinued subject at Day 90 time point, a vital status is not requ ired.

generall y low and largely  infrequent among low-risk PE patient s. In the Aujesky et al.2011
study , the 90-day recurrence rates of VTE among both inpatients and outpatients were reported 
to be less than 1% (with a 95% upper confidence limit=2.7%).4  
11.3. Analyses for Primary and Secondary  Endpoints
The primary  and major secondary  anal yses will be based on the ITT analysis set.
Analysis for Primary Endpoint
The primary  clinica l endpoint is theLOS of ho spi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (for the standard -of-care and 
rivaroxaban groups) beginning from randomization through discharge from the EDplus any 
bleeding or VTE events through 30 daysA two-sided 95% CIwill be calculated for the 
difference in LOS for 2 treatment groups.
Analysis for Major S econdary Endpoint s
A two-sided 95% CIwill be calculated for the difference of reoccurrence of symptomatic, 
objectively  confirmed VTE, defined as recurrent PE or new or recurrent DVT (including 
symptoma tic upper extremity DVT) or VTE related death within 90 days of randomization. The 
same procedure may be applied to the reoccurrence of VTE at Day 7 and Day 30 when 
appropriate. 
A two-sided 95% CIwill be calculated for the difference of ISTH major bleeding and death at 
Day 90and for the composite of I STH m ajor bleeding and mortalit y at Day 90 when appropriate. 
The following data will be summarized: ISTH major and clinically  relevant non-major bleeding, 
the total number of daysalive and out of the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], medical contacts for any reason, including 
office and ED visits, number of unplanned hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495059]/or bleeding.
Patient- reported outcomes will be captured and summarized at Day 7for Site-of-Care 
Satisfaction and Days 14, 30,and [ADDRESS_636732] 1 dose of stud y drug.

12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING
Rivaroxaban has been extensively  studied in Phase 1 through multiple large Phase 4 clinical 
studies involving over 84,000 patients, including over 47,000 patients exposed to rivaroxaban, 
and its overall safet y profile has been well characterized. Appropriate information concerning 
adverse events were systematically  collected and submitted to regulatory  authorities. For the 
purposes of this study  certain nonserious adverse events will not be collected, while certain 
events will be collected as endpoints and therefore not collected and reported as SAE s. All data 
on safet y outcomes will be reviewed regularly  by [CONTACT_1363]. This will be explained in 
Section 12.3.1 , All Adverse Events.

12.1. Definitions
12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications
Adverse Event
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a 
medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An adverse event does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any  unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an abno rmal finding), sy mptom, or disease temporally  associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not 
related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per 
International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH])
This includes any  occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency  from the 
baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory  test 
abnormalities.
Note: The sponso r collects adverse events starting with the signing of the ICF (refer to 
Section 12.3.[ADDRESS_636736] adverse event recording).
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event based on I CH and E uropean U nion Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for 
Medicinal Products for Human Use is an y untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:
Results in death
Is life -threatening
(The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically  might have caused death if it were more severe.)
Requires inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]†or prolongation of existing hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]
Results in persistent or signi ficant disability /incapacity
Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product
Is Medicall y Important*

Approved , Date: 16 June 2015† Note: The standard -of-care group in this study  will involve a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495060].  This hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495061] -of-care group should not be reported as an SAE . However, if, during the course of the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], a patient in the standard -of-care group develops a reportable event, or has anevent
that prolongs the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495062].  If apatient in the standard -of-care group is admitted to the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307], has an uneventful 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495063], no SAE should be reported.
All inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495064]/earl y discharge group
and subsequent hospi[INVESTIGATOR_495065] -of-care group should be 
reported as an SAE. 
*Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited (SAE)
reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may  not be 
immediately  life threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_23738]. 
These should usually  be considered serious.
Unlisted (Unexpecte d) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information
An adverse event is considered unlisted if the nature or severity  is not consistent with the 
applicable product reference safet y information. For rivaroxaban , the expectedness of an adverse 
event will be determined by [CONTACT_83408]'s Brochure. For a non-
sponsor investigational medicinal product with a marketing authorization, the expectedness of an 
adverse event will be determined by [CONTACT_118553] .
Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug
An adverse event is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible , 
probable or very  likel yby [CONTACT_23826] 12.1.2 , Attributes Definitions .
12.1.2. Attribution Definitions
Not Related
An adverse event that is not related to the use of the drug.
Doubtful
An adverse event for which an alternative explanation is more likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), 
concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely .
Possible
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, 
eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is 
reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded.

Approved , Date: 16 June 2015Probable
An adverse event that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive 
(eg,confirmed by [CONTACT_23827]). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant 
drug(s), concomitant disease(s).
Very Likely
An adverse event that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and canno t be reasonabl y explained 
by [CONTACT_4867], eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship 
in time is very  suggestive (eg, it is confirmed b y dechallenge and rechallenge).
12.1.3. Severity Criteria 
An assessment of severity  grade will be made using the following general categorical 
descriptors:
Mild : Awareness of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with every day activities.
Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interferenc e with normal activity .
Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. 
Prevents normal every day activities.
The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly  
experienc ed by [CONTACT_423] (eg, laboratory  abnormalities).
12.2. Special Reporting Situations
Safety  events of interest on a sponsor study  drugthat may require expedited (SAE) reporting 
and/or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to:
Overdose of a sponsor study  drug
Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study  drug
Inadvertent or accidental exposure to a sponsor study  drug
Unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefit from use of a sponsor study  drug
Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to 
the sponsor study  drug , eg, name [CONTACT_2976])
Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that 
meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the serious adverse event page 
of the eCRF.

Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy  and reliability  of data include the selection of qualified 
investigators and appropriate study  sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and 
study -sitepersonnel before the study , and periodic monitoring visits by [CONTACT_456]. Written 
instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. 
Guidelines for eCRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -sitepersonnel before 
the start of the stud y.
The sponsor will review eCRFs for accuracy  and completeness during on-site monitoring visits 
and after transmission to the sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator or 
designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they  will be verified for 
accuracy  and consistency with the data sources. 
17.7. Record Retention
In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all eCRFs 
and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study  
documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a 
Clinical Trial, and all study  documents as specified by [CONTACT_23859](s). 
The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of 
these documents.
Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be 
retained for a longer period if required by [CONTACT_43785]. It is the responsibility  of the sponsor to inform the 
investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.
If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility  of keepi[INVESTIGATOR_13274], custody  must be transferred to a person who will 
accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name [CONTACT_23877]. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study  
documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor .
If it becomes necessary  for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory  authority  to review any 
documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such 
reports.

the monitor will compare the data entered into the eCRFs with the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40961] 
(source documents). The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure 
that all sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and 
study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by [CONTACT_43786] -site contact. If 
electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed 
with the study -site personnel . 
Direct access to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of 
verify ing that the data recorded in the eCRF are consistent with the origi nal source data. Findings 
from this review of eCRFs and source documents will be discussed with the study -site personnel . 
The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be 
available, the source documentation will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be 
provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a 
regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct.
In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during 
these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress 
of the study  at the site. 
17.9. Study Completion/Termination
17.9.1. Study Completion
The study  is considered completed with the last visit for the last subject participating in the 
study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion 
of the final subject visit at that study  site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial 
Agreement.
17.9.2. Study Termination
The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study  at any time for any 
reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor .Study sites will be closed upon study  completion. A
study site is considered closed when all required documents and study  supplies have been 
collected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause 
and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.

Discontinuation of further study  drug development
17.10. On-Site A udits
Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality  assurance department may visit the study  site at 
any time during or after completion of the study  to conduct an audit of the study  in compliance 
with regulatory  guidelines and company  policy . These audits will require access to all study 
records, including source d ocuments, for inspection and comparison with the eCRFs. Subject 
privacy  must, however, be respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible 
for being present and available for consultation during routinely  scheduled study -site audit visits 
conducted b y the sponsor or its designees. 
Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by [CONTACT_23865], either as 
part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study  in support of a 
regulatory  submission. The investigator should immediately  notify  the sponsor if he or shehas
been contact[INVESTIGATOR_530] b y a regulatory agency  concerning an upcoming inspection.

Approved , Date: 16 June 2015Attachment 2Switching to or From Rivaroxaban 
PREMATURE DISCONTINUATION OF XAREL TO INCREASES THE RISK OF 
THROMBOTIC EVENTS .Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including 
XAREL TO, increases the risk of thrombotic events. To reduce this risk, consider coverage with 
another anticoagulant if XAREL TO is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding 
or completion of a course of therap y.
In order to provide guidance on switching to or from rivaroxaban the following guidance from 
the prescribing information is provided:
VKA to Rivaroxaban
When switching patients from warfarin to rivaroxaban, discontinue warfarin and start 
rivaroxaban as soon as the INR is below 3.[ADDRESS_636752] been taken.
Non-Warfarin Anticoagulant to Rivaroxaban
For patients currently  receiving an anticoagulant other than warfarin, start rivaroxaban 0 to 
2hours prior to the next scheduled evening administration of the drug (low-molecular -weight 
heparin or non-warfarin oral anticoagulant) and omit the next regularly  scheduled administration 
of the other anticoagulant. For unfractionated heparin being administered by  [CONTACT_3365], 
stop the infusion and start rivaroxaban at the same time.
Rivaroxaban to Non -Warfarin Anticoagulant
For patients currentl y taking rivaroxaban and transitioning to an anticoagulant with rapid onset, 
discontinue rivaroxaban and give the first dose of the other anticoagulant (oral or parenteral) at 
the time that the next rivaroxaban dose would have been taken.

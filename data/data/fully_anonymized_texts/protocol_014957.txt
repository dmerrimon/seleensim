Abstract  
Low back pain (LBP) is strongly associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_804010], and improved clinical management of LBP is likely to reduce reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_804011]. Up to 60% of patients with an acute e pi[INVESTIGATOR_43180]-
specific  LBP experience either symptom persistence or symptom relapse within 
one year. This is likely an indication of a failure in addressing the underlying mechanisms of pain or initiation of a new etiology; both may stem from a mismatch between patients and treatments. The overall goal of our research is to develop, validate and implement measures that are relevant to known mechanisms of LBP, which can then be used to holistically gauge the health status of patients’ lower backs beyond self -reporting of symptoms . More accurate 
measurements will help better match of patients with existing treatments or development of more effective new treatments. The specific objective of this study is to generate evidence in support of the feasibility of our methods for 1) the evaluation of relative contribution of lower back tissues to spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012], and 2) the investigation of the resultant spi[INVESTIGATOR_804013]- specific LBP. 
We have developed a powerful set of tools for the comprehensive assess ment of 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012] a nd lower back mechanical behavior (MB), that will enable us to 
examine the existence or development of abnormalities in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804014]- specific 
LBP. These  groups will include 1 ) veterans with chronic, non- specific LBP and 
high level of disability (n=18 ), 2) veterans with chronic, non- specific LBP and low 
level of disability (n=18 ), 3) asymptomatic veterans without a recent history of 
non-specific LBP (n=1 8; serving as control gr oup). Successful completion of this 
feasibility project will pave the way for future studies (merit grant applications) that will verify the role of abnormalities in lower back MB and spi[INVESTIGATOR_804015]. Such an understanding has the potential to help the 
affected veterans with disabling non- specific LBP. Specifically, measures of 
lower back MB and spi[INVESTIGATOR_804016], but also to guide novel integrated physical and psychological 
preventative treatments aimed at improved lower back mechanics. Ultimately, the 
goal and resultant improvement in clinical outcomes of treatment for non- specific

2.0 Introduction 
• Provide scientific background and rational e for study.   
• Include summary of gaps in current knowledge, relevant data,  and how 
the study will add to existing knowledge.   
• Include rationale for including or excluding certain populations – in 
particular vulnerable populations.  
Low back pain (LBP) is a significant human health disorder affecting up to 18%  of the world 
population at any given time.1-3 In response to a recent national survey, 33% of veter ans versus 
28% of non -veterans reported an epi[INVESTIGATOR_804021].4 Chronic 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/[ADDRESS_1109819] root cause(s) of LBP in these patients will be an important research challenge for years, there are measures that have relevance to some s pecific causal 
sources  of LBP. These measures can be used for the clinical management of LBP to 
holistically gauge the health status of patients’ lower back more accurately than from the 
symptom reports alone. One such group of measures relates to the “spi [INVESTIGATOR_804012]” 
experienced in daily life. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_804022],
17-21 there is strong 
evidence in the literature to support the plausibility of a causal relationship between 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_804023]. For instance, the association of measures of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012] (e.g., 
net moment at the lower back), and the incidence and prevalence of LBP have been 
widely reported.22-[ADDRESS_1109820] demonstrated how 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_804024], with or without injuries in spi[INVESTIGATOR_158461].30-32 Therefore, there is an important 
research need  for determination of whether measures of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804025]- specific LBP, and to help eliminate the risk of 
symptom relapse or persistence. Improved and objective assessment of patients’ lower back will enable clinicians to better match patients with treatments or develop more 
personalized novel treatm ents which will ultima tely help improve the clinical outcomes of 
treatments offered for LBP.  
In this application, forces and deformations experienced in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804026], and are the result of the active and passive mechanical  responses of 
lower back tissues (i.e., internal forces) to the physical demand of an activity (i.e., 
external forces), in order to assure spi[INVESTIGATOR_804027].
33-35 When performing 
a physical activity, active (motor or sensory) responses of lower back tissues to the 
activity demand determine the trunk and pelvic motions. The resultant trunk and pelvic 
motions in turn determine lumbar posture and passi ve tissue contribution (due to 
deformation) to spi[INVESTIGATOR_804028]. Therefore, alterations in active and 
passive aspects of lower back MB, along with changes in the way a physical activity is 
performed, alter spi[INVESTIGATOR_804028], an d thus ultimately the spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012].  
There is a large body of literature, including some from our laboratory , concerning the 
differences in the way a physical activity is performed between individuals with healthy back s, 
and those with acute/sub- acute/chronic or experimentally -induced LBP.36-[ADDRESS_1109821] bending has been suggested to be associated with higher spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012].42 It has 
been further shown that abnormalities in trunk and pelvic motions , observed in patients with 
non-specific LBP, linger beyond pain alleviation.43-45 Consistently, similar abnormalities in trunk 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/[ADDRESS_1109822] a physical activity is performed 
in veterans with different LBP experiences  are associated with potential differences in  spi[INVESTIGATOR_804029]  (i.e., Aim 2) . 
Persistent physical abnormalities (§1.4), which are likely inf luenced by [CONTACT_804103], could potentially lead to adaptive changes in lower back MB. For instance, 
asymmetric trunk motion and lumbo -pelvic coordination is evident in individuals with 
unilateral lower limb amputation,53, [ADDRESS_1109823] (i.e., Aim 1) will equip us with critical preliminary data for future studies 
aimed at investigation of the role of changes in lower back MB in transition from acute 
LBP to chronic  disabling LBP . 
In summary and considering the strong evidence in support of a causal relationship 
between spi[INVESTIGATOR_804023], investigation of the role of abnormalities in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804030] (symptom persistence, relapse, o r recurrence), is 
clearly critical. As a first step toward addressing such an important research gap, we will 
generate evidence in support of the sensitivity of our methods for capturing potential 
abnormalities in 1) relative contribution of lower back tis sues to spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012], and 2) the 
resultant spi[INVESTIGATOR_804031] -specific LBP. 
Successful completion of this project will facilitate future longitudinal research to 
determine the role of abnormalit ies in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804032]. Ultimately, the outcomes of such research will support integration 
of measures of lower back mechanics in clinical assessment of veterans with LBP, 
hence will allow identification of ve terans at risk for sym ptom persistence/relapse due to 
abnormal spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012]. Availability of such a capability in clinic will enable clinicians to better match patients with existing physical and psychological treatments or even may 
lead to development of more effective new treatments. The resultant improvement in 
clinical outcome of treatment for non -specific LBP is likely to reduce reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_804033].
 
3.0 Objectives  
• Relevance to VA Mission, Veterans health and or healthcare issu es 
• Describe the study’ s purpose, specific aims, or objectives.  
• State the hypotheses to be tested. How will the aims or objectives test the 
hypothesis?  
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/[ADDRESS_1109824] common prescription pain medications among patients with chronic low 
back pain (LBP),[ADDRESS_1109825] cases (referred as non-
specific LBP). Accordingly, unsatisfactory clinical outcomes for LBP are common for a wide 
range of treatments , with two out of three patients with LBP experienc ing symptom persistence 
or relapses.  
Considering the current level of opi[INVESTIGATOR_804034], it is critical to go beyond 
patient’s report of symptom s for the management of non- specific LBP , and to i mplement 
screening tools that can direct us to potential root causes of LBP. One group of such tools relates to measures of forces and deformations in spi[INVESTIGATOR_158461], or the “spi[INVESTIGATOR_804035]”, 
experienced in daily life activities. Extensive evidence relates spi[INVESTIGATOR_804036], yet, treatment -induced changes in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804037]. Spi[INVESTIGATOR_804038] -induced alterations in trunk neuro- musculoskeletal behavior and lumbo -pelvic 
coordination. Therefore, it is important to equip researchers and clinicians with the latest advanced tools that will enable evaluation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012] , and eventually help better m atch 
patients with treatments, or even designing more effective interventions that mitigate LBP 
persistence/relapses due to biomechanical factors.  
The specific objective of this study  is to generate evidence in support of the feasibility of our 
developed methods for the evaluation of 1) relative contribution of lower back tissues to spi[INVESTIGATOR_804029], and 2) the resultant spi[INVESTIGATOR_804039]- specific LBP . Results of this feasibility study will enable proper design of our future 
projec ts, wherein we will investigate the role of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804040].  We have developed several innovative computational and 
experimental methods for a comprehensive and personalized assessment of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012]. Specifically, the relative mechanical contribution of active and passive lower back tissues to 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_804041] [ bulk] lower back mechanical behavior 
(MB) , whereas muscular responses to physical demands of daily activities and the resultant 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_804042] . We have used the 
methods proposed in this application extensively for evaluation of [bulk] lower back MB  and 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_804043].  This project will demonstrate the sensitivity of our 
measures for capturing abnormalities in lower back MB  and spi[INVESTIGATOR_804044]-
specific LBP  by [CONTACT_804104] [ given the feasibility 
nature of this project  and lack of adequate power, no specific hypothesis has been provided]:  
Aim-1: Feasibility of distinguishing potential differences in lower back MB between 
veterans with different LBP experiences. We will characterize lower  back MB in three  
gender -balanced groups of veterans between 20 and 7 0 years old. These will include veterans 
with 1) chronic LBP and a Roland- Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score of >12 (n=18), 
2) chronic LBP and RMDQ score of ≤12 (n=18 ), 3) no re cent history of LBP and currently 
asymptomatic (n=18 ), serving as control group).  Participants will be recruited from the 
population served by [CONTACT_804105], KY, VA Medical Center. We will determine passive stiffness 
of the lower back and its relaxation al ong with its active in trinsic and reflexive mechanical 
properties, using our sudden perturbation and stress -relaxations tests. Given the reported 
differences in trunk neuromuscular behavior and lumbo- pelvic coordination, we expect to see 
differences in our  measures between pati ent groups  targeted for this project .

 Aim-2: Feasibility of distinguishing potential differences in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804045] . Trunk muscle forces and the resultant spi[INVESTIGATOR_804046]. Considering the causal role of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012] , 
and given the persistence of symptom in patient s with chronic LBP , along with the high risk of 
LBP recurrence  in patients  with non-chronic LBP and those with a recent history of LBP, we 
expect differences in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804047].  
Our long -term goal  is to help uncover the potential role of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804048]. If such a role is established, our measures can be used to identify veterans at 
risk for [symptom relapse, or transitioning to disabling chronic LBP] due to 
biomechanical f actors, and can guide novel, integrated physical and psychological 
treatments aimed at improved lower back mechanics. Ultimately, the resultant 
improvement in clinical outcome of treatment for non- specific LBP is likely to reduce 
reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_804049] .

[CONTACT_804106] h whom.  
• If applicable provide information on any Memoranda of Understandings (MOUs) or Data Use Agreements (DUAs) that are being entered into including with whom and for what reason.  
Data collection and analyses will be conducted in a designated research s pace in the 
Lexington VA Medical Center on Leestown Road, building 27, room #003E . The current  
research  team include [CONTACT_804122] (PI) and [CONTACT_627918] (Co -Investigator) , [CONTACT_804123] 
(Research Staff), Clare Tyler (Research Staff), Allison K ing (Research Staff), Evan

The study will not involve accessing protected health i nformation of participants.  
[CONTACT_804122], PI,  will have the overall responsibility and will lead all aspects of the project 
including protocol implementation, data collection and analyses, computational modeling, results interpretation and dissemination. H e will also be respons ible for 
recruiting and training of research personnel who will be assisting with subject 
recruitment, data collections  and analyses .  
[CONTACT_627918], Co -Investigator, will provide specific contributions in recruitment , consenting 
and medi cal screening of poten tial participants to assure their overall eligibility (i.e., 
meeting the primary inclusion/exclusion criteria) for the study . 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/[ADDRESS_1109826]. Kryscio will oversee our statistical analyses.   
5.0 Study Procedures  
5.1 Study Design 
• Study Design: Describe experimental design of the study .  Inc lude 
sequential  and/or  parallel phases of the study, including durations, 
and explain which interventions are standard of care and which 
procedures are being done for research purposes .   
This is a cross -sectional, observational study to investigate differences in 1)  active and  
passive aspects of lower back MB and 2) spi[INVESTIGATOR_804050]. Each participants will complete one data 
collection session during which they will complete a number of experiments and surveys.  
 
• Risk vs Benefit:  Include a description of how anticipated risk will 
be minimized and include an analysis of risk vs. potential benefit.  
The potential risks of this study will be outlined in the informed consent document, and 
discussed with participants during the screening meeting. While the risk associated with 
the tasks performed during biomechanical assessment is no more than the risk experienced during daily life, some participants may experience muscle and/or joint 
soreness associated with the tests that are self -limiting and last a few minutes to a few 
hours. Mild discomfort may also occur during EMG preparation consisting of mild skin 
rubbing (with alcohol), possible shaving (with electric clippers), and the removal of 
adhes ive tape holding the electrodes after test completion. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_804051] [ADDRESS_1109827] been reported from similar measurements in the literature. Participa nts may feel unpleasant or uncomfortable answering some 
questions on the self -reported questionnaires. We will ensure participants that their 
answers are confidential and also inform them that they may choose not to answer any 
question.  
 
Data security prot ections:  To protect confidentiality, data on paper will be kept in locked 
filing cabinets and will be identifiable only by [CONTACT_804107]. Identifying 
participant information will be kept separate from other study -related mat erials. 
Computer files  will be kept in password- protected computers with access restricted to 
the members of the study team who will use this information to recruit participants or 
obtain follow -up data. Computer files will also be backed up on a VA design ated network 
location as well as on a VA -approved encrypted hard drive which will be used primarily 
for transfer of computer files between PI’s VA and [LOCATION_006] labs. No electronic data will contain participants’ identifying information. Only study personnel who are approved by 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/[ADDRESS_1109828] access to the lab wherein all study equipment and 
materials are housed.  
Emotional distress or sadness in completing self -report measures:  In the event that 
answering any study questions elicits emotional distress or sadness, study personnel will 
assist participants to access counseling services through their primary care provider.  
Biomechanical assessment:  R isks of muscle strain and soreness during our proposed 
experimental tasks is considered low, as the movement associated with these tests is 
self-selected pace. Risks of skin irritation from the EMG electrodes will be minimized by 
[CONTACT_804108]. 
Research clinicians and biomechanical personnel conducting the  tests will monitor 
participants closely and stop the testing procedure if safety is or is potentially 
compromised. Testing will also be terminated by [CONTACT_804109]’s 
request.  
We have implemented all of the proposed biomechanical methods in this application in our earlier studies of asymptomatic individuals (see Research Approach). However, the 
proposed sudden perturbation and stress -relaxation tests will be done on patients with 
LBP for the first time in our lab. Similar tests on patie nts with LBP have been reported in 
the literature,
70-[ADDRESS_1109829], the participant’s leg will be raised using a 
slow speed (3 deg/second) actuator which can be stopped immediately at subject’s request.  
Direct benefits  to the subjects are minimal; in particular, there are no immediate health 
benefits of participating in the proposed study. A potential indirect benefit is further the 
understanding of LBP for patient veterans.  
LBP is a significant health problem and is strongly associated with opi[INVESTIGATOR_804052] v
eterans.3-6 Despi[INVESTIGATOR_804053], LBP persistence, recurrence, 
and transition from the acute to chronic stage is not managed effectively for majority of patients.
14-17 This clinical challenge arises, in part, because of the inability to determine 
the etiology of symptom (i.e., patients with non -specific LBP). The objective of this 
feasibility project is to verify the sensitivity of our biomechanical outcome measures for capturing potential differences in lower back mechanics between veterans with different 
LBP experiences. Successful completion of this project will warrant conduct of larger 
projects (i.e., using merit grant mechanism) to verify the role of lower back 
biomechanical abnormalities in LBP presentation. Given technological advances that 
have made biomechanical assessment more accessible, screening patients with non-
specific LBP for biomechanical abnormalities can help reduce the possibility of symptom 
persistence and relapse due to excessive force and deformation experienced in spi[INVESTIGATOR_804054] . Improvement in clini cal outcomes of treatment for non -specific LBP will diminish

 reliance on opi[INVESTIGATOR_804055]. 
• Patient Population:  Provide description of the study population 
(delineate all categories of subjects – patients, providers, family 
members , employees, etc.). Include anticipated enrollment 
numbers . How many participants.samples per group studies? 
Justify the sample size to obtain power  for statistical analysis.   
We will conduct a c ross-sectional study involv ing three  groups of research participants 
with and without LBP:  
Group -1: Veterans with chronic, non -specific LBP and a Roland- Morris Disability 
Questionnaire (RMDQ) score of >12 (gender -balanced, n1=18)  
Group -2: Veterans with chronic, non -specific LBP and a RMDQ score of ≤12 (gender -
balanced, n2=18 )]  
Group -3: Asymptomatic veterans with no recent history of LBP (gender -balanced, 
n3=18) 
Sample size justification:  The purpose of this SPi[INVESTIGATOR_804056]. In the absence of preliminary data 
from veterans with LBP, we calculated a sample size using effect sizes estimated from 
our earlier investigations of back -healthy individuals as well as reports of relevant 
measures in the literature. Based on our earlier studies of asymptomatic individuals,56, 57, 
[ADDRESS_1109830] a power of >80% for detection of significant (p = 0.05) 
differences in the proposed measures of lower back MB following acute exposure to 
awkward working posture. Further, using results in the literatu re,67-69 a sample size (i.e., 
sum of two groups) of [ADDRESS_1109831] sizes 
between individuals with and without LBP with 80%  power. Therefore, a sample size of 
18 for each group is selected to facilitate sample size calculation and power analyses for 
our future merit grant applications while maximizing our chances of discovering potential 
differences in lower back MB and spi[INVESTIGATOR_804057].

We will recruit  54 gender -balanced veterans in the following three  groups: 1) with 
chronic, non- specific LBP and a Roland- Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score of 
>12 (n=18 ), 2) with chronic, non- specific LBP and a RMD Q score of ≤12 (n=18 ), 3) 
asymptomatic and no a recent history of non- specific LBP (n=1 8; serving as control 
group)  
Participants  will primarily be recruited from veteran populations receiving t reatments at 
the Lexington VA Medical Center in Lexington, KY. This center has two facilities and 
several community -based clinics in the surrounding areas, and serves a population of 
more than 92,[ADDRESS_1109832]. Wolfe (Co -I) 
from the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, with assistance from 
Vanessa Ramirez (Clinical Research Assistant), will lead our patient recruit ment efforts.  
Recruitment will be done between months [ADDRESS_1109833] days to provide more information to the 
interested patients. We will also distribute our study fly ers to local institutions that serve 
Veterans.  The distribution of study flyers will also include the use of listservs  that will be 
sent to Veterans who are studying at the University of Kentucky . 
The recruitment flyer  describes the main inclusion/exclusion criteria, contact [CONTACT_445493], location and duration of experiments and the amount of compensation.  
Participants will be compensated for their time and efforts in participating in the study for a total 
of $40.  
5.3 In formed Consent Procedures

[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/2019  Page 14 of 27 
 • If applicable, indicate how local site study personnel will be trained 
regarding human subjects protections requirements and how to obtain and document informed consent.  
This project  requires written documentation of informed consent from all study 
participants. Approval of the informed consent document, the study protocol, and 
recruitment materials will be obtained before data collection begins. During the informed 
consent process, research personnel will explain the handling of data and personal health information and guide potential partici pants through the study consent form. 
Additionally, study staff will explain the study requirements and provide a study flow chart and information sheet to the potential participant. This will include an explanation 
of the interview time commitments and biomechanical assessments, potential risks of 
participation, potential benefits of participation, what to do if an adverse event occurs, and the option for discontinuation of study participation. Participants will be informed that 
they may choose to stop participating in the study at any stage. Once informed consent 
is administered, both the participant and research personnel will sign and date the

5.5 Study Evaluations 
• Describe all evaluations to be conducted  (including screening; 
tests/questionnaires that will be administered; any procedures that 
subjects will be required to complete) and data collection methods .  
Include materials as an appendix or separate attachment.  
In each data collection session, participants will first be instrumented with sensors to enable 
measurement of kinematics and muscle activity, similar to procedures we used in our earlier 
studies.70-73 Specifically, wireless inertial measurement units (Xsens MTW, Xsens Technologies, 
Enschede, Netherlands)[ADDRESS_1109835] 
bending posture and then return to the upright posture  at a self -selected pace. Participants will 
then be instructed to perform the following activities of daily life  at a self -selected pace: walking 
on level76, [ADDRESS_1109836] been selected bec ause  they represent basic 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/[ADDRESS_1109837] successfully used them in our earlier 
investigation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804058]- veterans,  as well as  persons with 
unilateral lower limb amputation. Finally,  sudden pertur bation followed by [CONTACT_174120] -relaxation tests 
will be conducted as in earlier studies and as explained below . Each of the above tests will take 
less than  5 minutes , and we will provide break periods between each set of tests to minimize 
fatigue and discom fort.  
In preparation for future projects, we will also administer the following questionnaires that are 
relevant to LBP experience during the data collection session: 1) comprehensive health status 
using the PROMIS -29 questionnaire81 ([all participants ]), 2) survey of habitual physical activity82 
(all participants), 3) the short version of Copenhagen Psychosocial questionnaire concerning 
work and non- work -related factors83 (all participants), [ 4) the minimum data set recom mended 
by [CONTACT_804112] (only veterans with LBP) ], 5) pain 
intensity using a numerical rating scale84 (only veterans with LBP), 6) LBP -related disability 
using the 24 -item Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire85 (only veterans with LBP),  7) the fear -
avoidance beliefs questionnaire86 (only veterans with LBP) , pain catastrophizing scale 
questionnaire (only veterans with LBP), and pain self -efficacy questionnaire (only veterans with 
LBP) . Total time for the entire data collection session, including the instrumentation time, is 
estimated to be less than 3 hours . 
Characterization of lower back MB:  Sudden perturbation and stress -relaxation tests will be used 
to characterize [ bulk] active and passive aspects of lower back MB. Sudden perturbation tests 
will be conducted in a displacement -control manner that we have developed, which provides 
separate quantif ication of both active reflexive and intrinsic stiffness of the lower back.71, 73 Here, 
intrinsic stiffness  refers to aspects of lower back MBs that are quantified during the reflex delay 
period (i.e., between perturbation onset and reflexive muscle response), and whic h incorporate 
both passive and active contributions of lower back tissues.  However, the passive contribution 
of tissues to intrinsic stiffness in upright standing posture (i.e., the position used in our experimental setting) is minimal;
[ADDRESS_1109838], participants will 
stand in a metal frame that restrains the pelvis and lower 
limbs [to isolate  the lower back response] (Fig. 1). 
Horizontal position perturbations, generated by a 
servomotor  (Kollmorgen AKM53K, Radford, VA, [LOCATION_003]) , 
are transmitted to the trunk (T8) via a rigid harness -rod 
system. A one -minute sequence of anteroposterior trunk 
displacements (± 5 mm) is induced with a pseudo -
random set of delays between each. The d riving force 
during the perturbations will be measured using an in-line load cell (Interface SM2000, Scottsdale, AZ, [LOCATION_003])  
located next to the motor , whereas t he resulting kinematics (small displacements with high 
accelerations) will be measured using  two lase r displacement sensors (Optex FA, Kyoto, 
Japan), with one targeting the back of the harness at the T8 level , and the other  targeting the 
load cell.   
The s udden perturbation  frame is designed so that trunk 
flexion  can be achieved by [CONTACT_804113]’s 
legs/pelvis  using an actuator  (Fig. 2); rotation of the lower 
body is about the L5 -S1 while the trunk is kept upright.  
Accordingly , the stress -relaxation tests  will be conducted 
in the same setup used for the perturbation tests, by

(left), and lateral/sagittal views of muscle architecture (right).   rotating the part icipant’s legs around his/her lower back using an actuated platform.70, 88 The 
lower extremities and the pelvis of participants will be  constrained to the platform and the thorax 
position will be  fixed (Fig. 2). Therefore, the amount of lumbar flexion will be  the same as the 
amount of platform rotation. During stress -relaxation tests, we will specifically rotate the leg 
platform to the extent that it generates 70% of  the lumbar  flexion angle that can be achieved 
during a trunk forward bending and backward return activity, as described in § 2.6. This posture 
will be maintained for 4 minutes, during which trunk resistance (via load cell) will be  measured.   
We have extensively used the methods proposed here in our earlier st udies of asymptomatic 
individuals 56, 57, 70, 88 and persons with unilateral lower limb amputation.55 Our sudden 
perturbation and stress -relaxation tests yield excellent within- day (ICC>0.85) and moderate -high 
between- day (ICC=0.5 -0.8) reproducibility of measures of lower back MB.66 
Estimation of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012]:  The 
computational strategy that will 
be used to estimate spi[INVESTIGATOR_804060] -linear finite element 
(FE) model of the spi[INVESTIGATOR_804061], 
accounting for passive 
contribution of lower back 
tissues, can estimate the 
required muscle forces to complete  a particular task using 
an optimization- based iterative 
procedure.
[ADDRESS_1109839] been included in our model by 
[CONTACT_804114][INVESTIGATOR_53530] a set of flexible beam elements that mimic intervertebral discs and 
rigid elements that mimic the thorax and lumbar vertebrae ( Fig. 3). Material nonlinearities are 
also considered in our model by [CONTACT_804115]- strain relationships, along with moment -rotation relationships in the 
sagittal/coronal/transverse planes that have been obtained from earlier numerical and 
experimental studies of lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_804062].90-[ADDRESS_1109840] trunk muscle forces on the basis of satisfying 
equilibrium at only one spi[INVESTIGATOR_139730] (i.e., often at the L4- L5 or L5- S1),64, 93, 94 and therefore result 
in the prediction of muscle forces that violate equilibrium requirements at other spi[INVESTIGATOR_351171] .95 In 
our improved model, muscle forces are estimated such that equilibrium requirements  are 
satisfied across the entire lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050].  Our model also includes a detailed trunk  muscle 
architecture ( Fig. 3), wherein muscle wrappi[INVESTIGATOR_804063].96 The 
muscle architecture in our computational model includes 56 muscles  (Fig. 3); 46 muscles 
connecting the lumbar vertebrae to the pelvis (i.e., local muscles), and 10 musc les connecting 
the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]/rib cage to the pelvis (i.e., global muscles ). To determine the required muscle 
forces for the satisfaction of equilibrium across the entire lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], segmental kinematics  in 
the lumbar region are required. Since only  whole -body level kinematics data are available from 
experimental measurement s, a heuristic optimization procedure will be  used with our model to 
determine a set of segmental kinematics in the lumbar region (i. e., from L1 to L5) , such that the 
corresponding set of predicted muscle forces minimize a cost function.[ADDRESS_1109841] function that 
will be used  for this heuristic optimization procedure will be  the sum of square d muscle stress

the moment drop on the relaxation sides

passive stiffness (K ave) and viscoelastic 
relaxation (R). Adopted from ref #[ADDRESS_1109842] recently published a detailed description of this 
procedure in Journal of Biomechanics.97 Predictions of lumbar segmental kinematics from this 
model provide good- excellent agreement with those from image -based measurements.97 The 
associated muscle forces with the optimal local kinematics will then be  used to determine spi[INVESTIGATOR_804064]. This heuristic optimization procedure was developed in Matlab (The 
MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, version 7.13), and FE simulations will be conducted in 
Abaqus/CAE ( Version 2018, Dassault Systemes Simulia, Providence, RI) . 
We have used our FE  computational model extensively to study occupational risk factors for 
LBP, including manual material handling,35, [ADDRESS_1109843],100 and sudden loading/unloading.101, 102 The bio-f idelity of our model -based 
predictions  of trunk muscle forces and spi[INVESTIGATOR_804065] . More specifically, good -to-excellent correlations w ere found between model 
predictions and  measured trunk muscle activity (R>0.7) ,101 with measured ground reaction 
forces (R >0.8),89 and with measured trunk resistance to sudden loading (R>0.8 unpublished 
data from103). In an ongoing collaboration with Walter -Reed National Military Medical Center, we 
are using our model to estimate spi[INVESTIGATOR_804066] .76-

Data analyses - Aim-1: From the perturbation tests, w e 
will obtain three outcome measures: reflex latency (t), intrinsic stiffness (K
IN), and maximum reflexive force 
(FREF). Latency of reflexive responses of trunk muscles 
will be estimated using a system identification approach and by [CONTACT_804116] y to trunk displacement.
71 
Intrinsic stiffness will be estimated using a system identification procedure, and by [CONTACT_804117], respectively, from displacement 
sensors and load cell obtained during the latency 
period.
73 To obtain the maximum reflexive force, the 
reflexive responses of lower back will be estimated by [CONTACT_804118] (i.e., reac tion force from load cell) over a 
time window between the end of latency period and [ADDRESS_1109844], 
we will obtain the average passi ve stiffness (K p) and viscoelastic relaxation (R) of lower back 
tissues as shown in Figure 4.70, 88  
Data analyses -Aim-2: Outputs of FE simulations  of daily activities will include forces in 56 trunk 
muscles and sp inal loads at all lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_522236].98, 99, 102 These outputs will be estimated for 
each instance of each simulated activity  described in §2.6. To facilitate quantitative comparison, 
and considering that maximum spi[INVESTIGATOR_804067], we  will extract the maximum spi[INVESTIGATOR_804068] L5- S1 level during 
each activity. The measure of spi[INVESTIGATOR_804069] s

  wherein norm  denotes the magnitude 
of vect or summation and SL activity denotes the maximum spi[INVESTIGATOR_804070]. 
 
5.6 Statistical Analysis 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/2019  Page 19 of 27 
 • What statistical test will be done?  
• Provide sample size determination and analysis (include 
anticipated rate of screen failures, study discontinuations, lost to 
follow- up etc.).  
• Describe how , where and by [CONTACT_427351].  
For each measure (i.e., reflexive latency, intrinsic stiffness, reflexive force, passive stiffness, 
and stress relaxation from Aim  1, along with the spi[INVESTIGATOR_804035], SL , from A im 2), we will run a 
univariate analysis of variance to verify potential differences between study groups (i.e., 
independent factor: participant  group with five levels). A significant ANOVA will be followed with 
post-hoc pairwise comparison using Bonferron i’s procedures . Prior to these analyses, 
parametric assumptions will be evaluated. As needed, data transformations will be used, or a 
non-parametric approach will be employed.  
The statistical analyses will be led by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_804071]. Krysc io 
 
5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects  
• Describe any anticipated circumstances under which subjects will 
be withdrawn from the research without their consent.  
• Describe the consequences of a subject's decision to withdraw from the research and the procedures for or derly termination of 
participation by [CONTACT_423] (e.g., the subject contact[CONTACT_427332]- of-study visit).  
Except for the noted exclusion criteria, there is no other anticipated circumstances for 
subject withdrawal.  
Participants will com plete a screening session upon completion of the consenting 
procedure and then will participate in one data collection session if determined eligible. 
Since it is most likely that the screening and data collection take place in the same visit, 
there is no spec ific procedure for withdrawal from the study but to inform the research 
personnel that they are no longer willing to complete the study.  
 
5.8 Expected Results  
• Based on literature and hypothesis, what can be expected?  
• Alternative Hypothesis if main hyp othesis is not confirmed.  
This is a feasibility project and doesn’t involve a specific hypothesis (per SPi[INVESTIGATOR_804072]). The followings are, however, our expected findings: Given the reported differences 
in physical performance between individuals with and without LBP, we expect differences in 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_804073]. Considering the high rate 
of LBP recurrence, we specifically expect those with LBP (or a recent history LBP) to 
experience larger spi[INVESTIGATOR_804012]. Furthermore,  we expect differences in lower back MB between 
veterans with chronic and non- chronic LBP. These differences will support future longitudinal 
research to verify whether they are developed during transition to chronic LBP. Therefore, 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/[ADDRESS_1109845] for future studies (merit grant 
applications) that will verify the role of abnormalities in lower back MB and spi[INVESTIGATOR_804015]. Such an understanding has the po tential to help the affected 
veterans, particularly those with disabling non- specific LBP.  
 
6.0 Reporting  
• Include procedures for reporting unanticipated problems, serious adverse 
events, and protocol deviations.  
Reporting for this study will include an annual repo rt to the VA IRB, regulatory and sponsoring 
agencies at a minimum, with appropriate updates and reports in the event of unanticipated 
adverse event(s).  This project  represent s no more than minimal risk as they involve activities 
participants do during dail y life. Further, we do not anticipate moderate, severe, life- threatening 
or fatal adverse events. The PI [INVESTIGATOR_804074]. Mild adverse events will be reported within 10 working days of the  occurrence; 
moderate, severe, life- threatening or fatal adverse events will be reported within 48 hours of the 
occurrence.  
7.0 Privacy and Confidentiality  
• Data Collection:  List sources/procedures for which data will be collected, 
transmitted, stored, maintai ned and/or shared.  
• Describe whether the study will use or disclose subjects’ Protected Health 
Information (PHI).  
• Describe the steps that will be taken to secure the data (e.g., training, authorization of access, password protection, encryption, physical contr ols, Certificates of Confidentiality, and separation of identifiers and 
data)  
Research material obtained for biomechanical assessment during proposed 
biomechanical tests includes non- invasive measures of muscle activity (EMG), kinetics 
and kinematics. Pati ent health- related data such as psychological characteristics, pain, 
disability, medication use, and health care utilization will be obtained by [INVESTIGATOR_2993]- person 
interviews, self -reporting questionnaires, and/or examinations. All data used for this 
project wi ll be obtained only after receiving written informed consent from the participant.  
We will not collect any PHI  
To protect confidentiality, data on paper will be kept in locked filing cabinets and will be identifiable only by [CONTACT_804107]. Identi fying participant information will be 
kept separate from other study -related materials. Computer files will be kept on a 
password- protected computer with access restricted to the members of the study team 
who will use this information to recruit participants o r obtain follow -up data. Backups of 
computer files will be saved on a VA -designated network space as well as on a VA -
approved encrypted hard drive. The latter will primarily be used for the transfer of 
computer files between the PI’s lab at VA and Univ ersity of Kentucky. No electronic data 
[Version Number or Date]  Lexington VAHCS IRB Protocol Template – version 1/23/2019  Page 21 of 27

by [CONTACT_804119].  
8.0 Communication P lan 
• Include plan for ensuring all required local site approvals are obtained and 
notifying the Director of any facility where the research in being conducted but the facility is not engaged.  
• Include plan for keepi[INVESTIGATOR_804075], informed consent, and HIPAA authorization 
• Include plan for informing local sites of any Serious Adverse Events , 
Unanticipated Problems , or interim results that may impact conduct of the 
study . 
• Include plan for ensuring the study is conducted according to the IRB -
approved protocol.  
• Include plan for notifying all local facility directors and LSIs when a multi -
site study reaches the point that it no longer requires engagement of the local facility (e.g., all subsequent follow -up of subjects will  be performed by 
[CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_91714]).
 
This proje ct is a single site project wherein a single group of researchers (PI, Co -I, and 
research staff) performs all recruitments, screening, data collection and analysis. Any 
potential changes to the prot ocol will be discussed during weekly lab meetings. 
Considering the above described reporting,  research personnel will be trained to 
recognize, respond to, and record adverse events when they occur or immediately after 
they occur to insure the safety of the human subjects; and to report adverse events to 
the PI [INVESTIGATOR_2993] a timely manner to insure compliance with institutional policies on human subject protection. Research assistants engaged in data collection will contact [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_804076].

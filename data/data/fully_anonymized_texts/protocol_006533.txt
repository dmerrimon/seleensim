Studied  period:  First enrolment:  Q3 2018.  Expected  completion  date:  Q4 2020.  
Objectives:  The primary  aim is to establish  the safety,  efficacy  and mechanism  of action  of 
lanifibranor  in patients  with Type  2 diabetes  (T2DM)  and nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  
(NAFLD).  Specifically,  to determine  if lanifibranor  decreases  intrahepatic  triglycerides  (IHTG)  
(primary  endpoint),  improves  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  (hepatic)  glucose  production,  
gluconeogenesis  and de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  This will be achieved  by [CONTACT_2329]  a combination  of 
intravenously  infused  stable  isotopes  and with the infusion  of a low- and high-dose insulin  infusion  
during  a euglycemic  hyperinsulinemic  clamp  with indirect  calorimetry.  In addition,  exploratory  
analysis  with surrogate  plasma  biomarkers  and imaging  on liver fibrosis  changes  on with treatment  
will be performed.  
Study  design:  The study  is a two arm (placebo,  lanifibranor  800 mg/day),  randomized  (1:1),  
double -blind,  placebo -controlled,  24-week  treatment  study.  There  is in addition  a non-obese  
subject  control  group  for the metabolic  and imaging  procedures.  
Study  duration:  The total time (from  first patient  enrolled  to last patient  finished)  will be 32±4  
weeks  (4-[ADDRESS_384487]-study  follow -up), with an 
estimated  recruitment  period  of 6-9 months.  
Total  number  of subjects:  34 randomized  to study  drug or placebo.  Ten healthy  non-obese  will 
also be studied  as “normal  controls”  for all the metabolic  and imaging  tests to be performed.  
 
Diagnosis and  main  criteria  for inclusion:  
1. Be able to communicate  meaningfully  with the investigator  and legally  competent  to 
provide  written  informed  consent  
2. Have  an age between  [ADDRESS_384488] two (2) months 
prior to trial entry  
4. Have  uncontrolled  diabetes  with a fasting  plasma  glucose (FPG)  ≥ 100 mg/dL  but ≤ 250 
mg/dL and HbA1c ≥ 6.0% but ≤ 9.5%, on diet alone, or on metformin (≥1,000 mg/day), 
and/or sulfonylurea and/or DPP -IV therapy, SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP1RA. These medicines 
will be continued at stable doses during the  entire study.  
a. Subjects  with an HbA1c  > 8.0%  but ≤ 9.5%  will have their metformin  
(minimum  dose required:  1,000 mg/day)  maximized  to 1,000  mg BID and/or  
Page  10 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384489] 2 weeks  of the run-in period.  
The baseline  visit to initiate  lanifibranor  (V4; Time  0 or randomization  visit)  will be 
not sooner  than [ADDRESS_384490]  an HbA1c ≤9.0% to  proceed  to randomization  (V4).  
b. In addition, if both metformin and glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956] (or another sulfonylurea) are already 
maximized at study entry (or the patient is intolerant to either) and the HbA1c  ≥ 
9.0% but ≤9.5%,  we will add sitagliptin  100 mg daily (or an equivalent dose of 
another DPP -IV inhibitor)  to reach an HbA1c  ≤9.0% to proceed to randomization 
(V4).  
5. Presence of hepatic steatosis (Intrahepatic Triglycerides IHTG) > 10 % determined by 
[CONTACT_312086] (1H -MRS).

o Albumin  > 36 g/L 
8. No other causes  of chronic  liver disease  (autoimmune,  primary  biliary cholangitis,  HBV, 
HCV, Wilson’s, α -1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, other).  
9. Negative  pregnancy  test or at least two-year post-menopausal.  Women  with childbearing

clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745],  prasugrel,  ticagrelor)  are allowed.  
o Herbal  supplements:  Herbal  preparations  or vitamin  supplements  should  not be 
taken  as it is difficult  to know  exactly  what  they contain  and could  be liver toxic.  
 
If a symptomatic  medication  is needed  to treat adverse  events  that may be related  to IMP,  the 
investigator  will inform  the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312009].  
Duration  of treatment:  lanifibranor  or placebo to match will be given  for 24 weeks.  
Parameters  assessed  during  the study : Continuous  recording  of adverse  events  and 
concomitants  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  physical  examination,  vital signs,  ECG  (12-leads),  hematology,  blood  
biochemistry  and urinalysis,  liver enzymes,  oral glucose  tolerance  test, exploratory  biomarkers  
adiponectin,  ProC3,  CK-18, genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
Imaging  such as fibroscan,  liver fibrosis,  liver IHTG  and T1 MR mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
All patients,  insulin  sensitivity  study:  2-step insulin  clamp  with glucose  turnover  measurements.  
 
Primary  efficacy  criterion . Determine  if lanifibranor  decreases  intrahepatic  triglycerides  (IHTG)  
(primary  endpoint),  improves  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  (hepatic)  glucose  production,  
gluconeogenesis  and de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  
 
Statistical methods and Saf ety: 
Sample  size: based  on the most  recent  studies,  patients  with NAFLD  are expected  to have  a mean  
baseline  IHTG  of approximately  15%.  The earlier  power  calculations  were  based  on results  with 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_312010]  a 6-month  study  (1) and a more  recent  18-month  RCT  (2) but they wee revised  
in version  2.4.1 of the protocol  based  on the results  with lanifibranor  800 mg/day  (same  dose as this 
study)  from  a 6-month  RCT  (NATIVE)  that used liver biopsy  (histology)  as the primary  endpoint  
(provided  in detail  by [CONTACT_312088] [INVESTIGATOR_124]. Cusi).  In NATIVE,  the proportion  of patients  with a 
reduction  in steatosis  to lanifibranor  was 73% versus  26% with placebo  (steatosis  being  the primary  
endpoint  of this study);  being  greater  than with pi[INVESTIGATOR_312011] 6-month  Belfort  et al study  
Page  14 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 February 7th, 2022  
  
 [1]). Based  on these  results,  this would  translate  to liver fat imaging  on 1H-MRS  of a relative  
reduction  of fat liver with lanifibranor  to be ≥50% compared  to placebo.  This represents  a 
change  of ≥7.0%  with lanifibranor  versus  the control  group.  The expected  standard  deviation  of 
the change  from  baseline  is expected to be 7%. Considering  a type I error of 0.05 (2- sided),  a 
power of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same variance in both treatment groups  and a 
parametric  test of mean  comparison,  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients  to complete  
treatment.  Assuming  that 10 % of randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the total number  
of patients  to be randomized  is 33-34 patients.  Considering  a type I error  of 0.05 (2-sided),  a power  
of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same  variance  in both treatment  groups  and a parametric  test 
of mean  comparison  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients.  Assuming  that 10 % of 
randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the total number  of patients  to be randomized  is 
34. 
Randomization : Patients  will be randomized  equally  1:1: to either  dose of lanifibranor  or placebo.  
The randomization  list will be setup  with blocs  of size equal  to 4. 
Safety  variables : The review  of safety  and tolerance  will be performed  on the safety  population.  
The safety  analysis  will be based  on the reported  AEs and other  safety  information.  The Principal  
Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312012]  (PCSA)  
in clinical  laboratory  tests,  vital signs,  and ECG  for the final analysis.  The effect  of the 
demographic  differences  (gender,  age, etc.) and risk factors  of clinical  relevance  will be explored.  
Efficacy  variables:  
Primary  outcome : Change  in IHTG  quantified  by ¹H-MRS  from  baseline  to 24 weeks  
Secondary  endpoints : 
The following  changes  from  baseline  to 24 weeks  of treatment  will be evaluated:  
• Proportion of responders defined as the percentage of patients reaching a decrease from 
baseline in IHTG (quantified by ¹H -MRS) to week 24 of ≥ 30%. The definition of 
“responders” as those with a ≥ 30% reduction in liver fat by ¹H -MRS is empi[INVESTIGATOR_312013] (except the Belfort et al, NEJM 2006 (1) and Cusi et al (2) with 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]) comparing simultaneously ¹H -MRS data with liver histology, but it is 
assumed that such threshold is likely to correlate with positive histological changes in 
NASH,  based on the investigator's experience.  
• Proportion  of patients  with NAFLD   resolution   considered   as  having   ≤  5.5%   IHTG  
(quantified  by 1H- MRS)  at 24 weeks.  
• Changes  in hepatic  fibrosis  measured  by [CONTACT_312089]:  
a) Vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan)  (3); 
b) Two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (2D-MRE)  (4); and 
c) A novel  T1 MRI mappi[INVESTIGATOR_312014]-invasive  
measurement  of liver fibrosis,  in collaboration  with the Oxford  laboratory  (5). 
• Change  in plasma  biomarkers  of liver fibrosis  (i.e., cytokeratin  CK-18, proC3)  or clinical  
laboratories.  
• Change  in metabolic  outcomes  standard  for such pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250]  (see ref. 1, 2, and 6) at week  
24 of treatment,  and will include:  
o Determination  of hepatic  insulin  sensitivity  
o De novo  lipogenesis  
o Glycemic  control:  HbA1c,

 (time  0), follow -up V5  (week 4), follow -up V6 (week  8), follow -up V7  (week  12), follow -up V8 
(week  16), follow -up V9 (week  20), repeated  baseline  studies  at V10 (week  23), V11 (week  
24), and off-drug  follow -up V12 (week  28). For all visits  time windows  are defined  up to +/- [ADDRESS_384499] to be extended by 1-8 weeks. This time frame  will allow  completi on of the follow-up liver 
MRI (V10)  and perform  the insulin  clamp (V11).  These  are essential procedures in order  to obtain 
the primary  and secondary outcomes of the study.  
A vital signs,  weight,  height  and waist  measurements  will be performed  at each visit.  An ECG  
will be done  at screening  (V1)  and at end of treatment  (V11).  A physical  exam  including  weight  
measurement  every  4 weeks  once  patients  randomized  to study  medication.  Adverse  events  and 
concomitant  medications  will be recorded  throughout  the study.  Patients  and caregivers  will be 
educated  for potential  symptoms  of adverse  effects  that should  be reported  to the investigators,  
such as skeletal  muscle  pain,  weight  gain,  peripheral  edema,  shortness  of breath,  etc. If a patient  
has symptoms  of dyspnea,  edema,  or a presumptive  diagnosis  of heart  failure,  NT-proBNP  should  
be measured  as close  to the event  as possible.  The potential  for hypoglycemia  will be monitored  
carefully,  particularly  in patients  on anti-diabetic  medications,  as detailed  in the protocol.  
The routine  laboratory  assessments  performed  at V1, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9 V11 and V12 will 
include:  complete  blood  count,  comprehensive  metabolic  profile  and lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805].  CK and CK-MB will 
be measured  every  [ADDRESS_384500] will  be performed  at V1, V4, V7,  V9, V11 and V12.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
This is a Phase  II, randomized,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled,  single -center,   investigator  
initiated,  24-week  treatment  study  of lanifibranor  (IVA337)  in adult  subjects  with Type  2 diabetes  
(T2DM)  and nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  (NAFLD).  
This introductory  section  provides  a rationale  for the study,  describes  the underlying  conditions  of 
the patients  to be included  in the study,  the scientific  rationale  for exploring  lanifibranor  in 
NAFLD,  summarizes  the lanifibranor  preclinical  and clinical  data.  
 
1.1 Study  Rationale  
Nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  (NAFLD)  develops  in ~70%  of patients  with type 2 diabetes  
mellitus  (T2DM)  (7,8) and about  40% develop  the more  severe  form  of the disease  with hepatocyte  
necrosis  (ballooning)  and liver inflammation  (steatohepatitis  or NASH).  This is often  in diabetes  
associated  with fibrosis progression  and a higher  risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_312017]. Of  note,  diabetes is  
the single  most  important  clinical  risk factor  for NASH  progression.  This is particularly  true in the 
setting  of obesity,  where  insulin -resistant  (dysfunctional)  adipose  tissue  promotes  hepatic  steatosis  
and hepatocyte  injury  from  “lipotoxicity”  (12). Patients  with T2DM  and NASH  are also at 
increased  risk of micro - and macrovascular  complications  (7-13). Taken  together,  it is likely  that 
clinicians  managing  patients  with T2DM  will give preeminence  to treatments  that not only control  
hyperglycemia,  but also treat liver disease  (NASH).  Unfortunately,  treatment  options  for 
NAFLD/NASH  remain  limited  although  many  drugs  are in development,  as reviewed  recently  
elsewhere  (13,14). Successful  treatments  for NASH  will likely  need  to reverse  liver insulin  
resistance  (7,8 - see below).  Lanifibranor  (IVA337),  a pan-PPAR  α, δ and γ, may improve  or 
normalize  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  intrahepatic  triglyceride  (IHTG)  accumulation,  excessive  de 
novo  lipogenesis  (DNL)  and VLDL  oversecretion  (i.e., atherogenic  dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035])  in humans  but 
this remains  to be tested.  This may be due to either a direct effect  on intracellular  glucose or lipid 
metabolism  effects  in hepatocytes,  kupfer  and stellate  cells.  As obesity  reaches  epi[INVESTIGATOR_312018],  nonalcoholic  fatty liver disease  (NAFLD)  is becoming  a frequent  cause  of patient  
referral  to gastroenterologists.  There  is a close  link between  dysfunctional  adipose  tissue  in 
NAFLD  and common  conditions  such as metabolic  syndrome,  T2DM,  and cardiovascular  disease.  
The following  focuses  on the pathophysiology  of interactions  between  adipose  tissue  and target  
organs  in obesity  and the resulting  clinical  implications  for the management  of nonalcoholic  
steatohepatitis.  The release  of fatty acids  from  dysfunctional  and insulin -resistant  adipocytes  
results  in lipotoxicity,  caused  by [CONTACT_312090] -derived  toxic  metabolites  in 
ectopic  tissues  (liver,  muscle,  pancreatic  beta cells)  and subsequent  activation  of inflammatory  
pathways,  cellular  dysfunction,  and lipoapoptosis.  The cross  talk between  dysfunctional  
adipocytes  and the liver involves  multiple  cell populations,  including  macrophages  and other  
immune  cells that in concert  promote  the development  of lipotoxic  liver disease,  a term that more  
accurately  describes  the pathophysiology  of nonalcoholic  steatohepatitis.  At the clinical  level,  
adipose  tissue  insulin  resistance  contributes  to type 2 diabetes  mellitus  and cardiovascular  disease.  
Treatments  that rescue  the liver from  lipotoxicity  by [CONTACT_312091]  
(e.g.,  significant  weight  loss, exercise,  thiazolidinediones)  or preventing  activation  of inflammatory  
pathways  and oxidative  stress  (ie, vitamin  E, thiazolidinediones)  hold promise  in the treatment  of 
NAFLD,  although  their long-term safety  and efficacy  remain  to be established.  Better  understanding  
of pathways  that link dysregulated  adipose  tissue,  metabolic  dysfunction,  and liver lipotoxicity  will 
result  in improvements  in the clinical  management  of these  challenging  patients  (7), or indirectly,  
through  PPAR  δ and/or  γ effects  on peripheral  adipose  tissue  or muscle  insulin  signaling  pathways.  
This study  will test the hypothesis  that treatment  with lanifibranor  will significantly  decrease  liver 
steatosis  (primary  endpoint)  in patients  with T2DM  and NAFLD.  It will also aim to understand  the 
mechanism(s)  of action  of IVA337  associated  with a reduction  in liver fat. Specifically,  we will 
examine  the effect  of IVA337  on hepatic  pathways  linked  to the development  of hepatic  steatosis,  
Page  27 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 insulin  resistance  and atherogenic  dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_035]  (hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  [largely  
hepatic]  glucose  production  and gluconeogenesis,  DNL  and VLDL  secretion)  with the use of gold- 
standard  stable  isotope  metabolic  techniques.  This will establish  a robust  rationale  for the use of 
IVA337  in NAFLD  and will complement  the results of the Phase  IIb RCT  (NATIVE  trial)  on its 
effect  on liver histology  in NASH , where there was a significant improvement in the primary 
endpoint (SAF -A score and no worsening of fibrosis in 48% with 800 mg/day (p=0.07) and in 55% 
with 1,200 mg/day o f lanifbranor (p=0.007) vs. 33% with placebo .  Secondary endpoints significant 
with both doses included resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis were and in the 
composite endpoint of resolution of NASH and improvement of fibrosis.  
 
1.2 Previous  Studies  in Patients  NAFLD/NASH  and T2DM  and Interest  
of Assessing  the Metabolic  Effects  of the Pan-PPAR  IVA337  
There  is limited  data on pharmacological  treatments  for this population  (13,14). Treatment  of 
NASH  with DPP-IV inhibitors  have  met mixed  results  in NAFLD  (8,13), while  the potential  of 
GLP-1RAs  is more promising.  For instance,  during  clinical  development  it was observed  that 
liraglutide  lowered  elevated  plasma  aminotransferases  in patients  with T2DM  (15). However,  it 
was not until recently  that GLP-1RAs  were  reported  to reverse  metabolic  (16) and histological  
(17) defects  in NASH. In the study  by [CONTACT_312092] (17), resolution of NASH  occurred  in 39% 
of patients  treated with  liraglutide  versus  9% treated  with placebo  (p=0.019;  treatment  difference  
~30%).  Of note,  liraglutide  improved  some  but not all histological features.  There  was a decrease  
in steatosis  (83%  vs. 45%;  p=0.009;  ~35%  reduction  in mean  steatosis  cores  from  baseline)  and 
hepatocyte  ballooning  (61%  vs. 32%;  p=0.05).  Insulin  sensitivity  at the level  of the liver and 
adipose  tissue  improved  in a subset  of patients  undergoing  in-depth  metabolic  studies  at 3 months  
(16). However,  the study  was small  and only one-third of patients  had T2DM.  Moreover,  recently  
Tang  et al (18) recently  reported  no effect  of liraglutide  on liver fat in patients  with T2DM  and 
NAFLD.  Therefore,  the role of GLP-1RAs  in patients  with T2DM  and NAFLD  remains  to be fully 
established.  
Peroxisome  proliferator -activated  receptors  (PPARs)  are nuclear  receptor  proteins  that function  as 
transcription  factors  regulating  the expression  of genes  essential  for cellular  differentiation,  and 
development,  as well as in key pathways  of carbohydrate,  lipid and protein  (1). PPARα  is highly  
expressed  in the liver and its activation  by [CONTACT_312093] β-oxidation,  
inflammatory  pathways,  and improves  the plasma  lipoprotein  profile  observed  in insulin -resistant  
states,  but not glucose  metabolism  (19). Moreover,  fibrates  do not reduce  hepatic  triglyceride  
concentration  in NAFLD  (20). PPARδ  agonists  also promote  fatty acid transport  and β-oxidation,  
increase  plasma  HDL -C concentration,  and exert  anti-inflammatory  actions  in macrophages  and 
Kupffer  cells (19), but in addition  may improve  glucose  metabolism  by [CONTACT_312094]  (21,22). These  features  are attractive  for the treatment  of NASH.  However,  
recently  elafibranor,  a PPARα/δ  agonist , failed  to meet  the primary  endpoint  of resolution  of 
NASH  in the GOLDEN  trial but reported  histological  benefit  in patients  with a higher  NAS  score  
(≥ 4) (23). Thiazolinediones  (TZDs)  are ligands  for the transcription  factor  PPAR -γ that plays  a 
key role in the regulation  of glucose  and lipid metabolism,  as well as in inflammation.  Belfort  et al 
were  the first to report  in a RCT  that a PPAR -γ ligand  (pi[INVESTIGATOR_051])  could  improve  liver 
histology  in patients  with NASH  and also having  prediabetes  or T2DM  (1). There  was also a 
suggestion  that fibrosis  could  be reversed  in NASH,  as pi[INVESTIGATOR_051] -treated  patients  had a 
significant  reduction  in liver fibrosis  compared  to baseline,  although  this fell short  of reaching  
statistical  significance  when  compared  to placebo  (p=0.08).  This was later also demonstrated  in 
non-diabetic  patients  (7,14). Recently,  Cusi et al. reported  in a 36-month  study  in 101 patients  with 
prediabetes  or T2DM  and NASH  that pi[INVESTIGATOR_312019]  (2). Of note,  there  was also a modest  but statistically  significant  difference  in the mean  
scores  for fibrosis  when  compared  to placebo.  The effect  of pi[INVESTIGATOR_312020]  (F2-3) has been  suggested  from  a recent  meta -analysis  combining  all recent  RCTs  (24). 
Page  28 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384509]  anti-inflammatory  and anti- fibrotic  
properties  (data  on file Inventiva  and 25). It is also likely  that IVA337  may improve  mitochondrial  
defects  that are at the core of the paradigm  linking  excess  substrate  supply  (fatty  acids),  insulin  
resistance,  hepatocyte  “lipotoxicity”  and steatohepatitis,  as recently  reviewed  (26,27). Recent  
studies  from  our laboratory  (28,29), and others  (30,31), support  the role of mitochondrial  
dysfunction  in NASH.  Recent  human  studies  indicate  inadequate  mitochondrial  adaptation  despi[INVESTIGATOR_312021]  (32) and we have  developed  the 
methodology  to study  mitochondrial  function  in clinical  trials  (33). 
In humans,  the mechanism  of action  of IVA337  remains  to be further  assessed.  In the 4-week  
PK/PD  Phase  IIa study  in patients  with T2DM,  IVA337  had a mild glucose -lowering  effect.  It is 
unclear  if the limited  glucose -lowering  effect  was due to a lack of efficacy  per se or was related  to 
the short -term 4- week  exposure.  However,  treatment  improved  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_312022].  As mentioned above,  liver histology  improved in the Phase  IIb 
NATIVE  RCT,  being  important  at the same  time to establish  the mechanism  of action  and metabolic  
effects  of IVA337  on hepatic,  muscle  and/or  adipose  tissue  insulin sensitivity  in patients  in NASH,  
as reported  for liraglutide  (16,17) or pi[INVESTIGATOR_051]  (1,2) in insulin -resistant  and/or  T2DM  patients.  
An attractive  feature  of IVA337  is its ability  to impact  through  its PPAR  α/δ profile lipid  pathways 
and likely  reduce  increased  rates of DNL  and hepatic  VLDL  secretion  that drive  the atherogenic  
dyslipi[INVESTIGATOR_312023].  Pi[INVESTIGATOR_051],  possibly  by [CONTACT_312095]  α properties,  has been 
reported  to reduce  DNL  in humans  (34) and lower  plasma  triglyceride  concentration  in association  
with an improvement  in mitochondrial  defects  that drive  hepatic  steatohepatitis  (7,31). Treatment  
with IVA337  would  be well suited  to address  these  defects  but requires  additional  investigations  in 
T2DM.  
In summary,  given  IVA337’s  apparent  clinical  efficacy  and overall  safety  (i.e., a PPAR  that is 
apparently  weight  neutral  and does not cause fluid retention), it may hold a significant  advantage  
over traditional  PPARγ  agonists  and other  drugs in  development  for NASH.  We hypothesize  that 
IVA337  will have  a profound  impact  on liver metabolism,  reducing  hepatic  triglyceride  content  
and improving  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity  in patients  with T2DM  and NAFLD/NASH.  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_312024]/TG  synthesis/DNL  and VLDL  oversecretion  will likely  become  
first-line therapy  for patients  with T2DM  and NASH.  This work  will open  a new horizon  for 
IVA337  as an insulin -sensitizer  and position  it as a key player  in the management  of these  patients.

The Investigational  Medicinal  Product  is a white  to off-white  bi-convex  tablet,  weighing  
approximately  927 mg and showing  a breakline  to facilitate  the administration  to patients.  The 
film-coated  tablet  contains  400 mg of the active  ingredient  lanifibranor  (IVA337)  for an immediate  
release  formulation.  
Film -coated  tablets  with a core containing  900 mg of a physical  mixture  of lactose  monohydrate,  
microcrystalline  cellulose,  pre-gelatinized  starch  and magnesium  stearate  serve  as placebo.  
The Investigational  Medicinal  Products  used in this clinical  Phase  II trial will be packaged  in 
Page  29 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 containers  of High  Density  Polyethylene  (HDPE)  with proper  HDPE  closures  fitted  with a silica  
cartridge.  
Based  on the results  of the ongoing  stability  studies,  a shelf  life of 2 years  (storage  at 25°C  or 
below)  is proposed  for the Investigational  Medicinal  Product  provided  it is stored  in the original  
package,  the HDPE  bottles.  
Furthermore,  the stability  data at 40°C/75%RH  demonstrate  that temperature  excursions  (e.g. 
during  shipment,  storage)  will not significantly  affect  the stability  of lanifibranor  [ADDRESS_384511] -off cap integrated  with a 2 g of silica  gel has been  selected  for the closure.  The data of the 
“in use test” 35 days at 25°C/60%RH  open  bottles  have  confirmed  the stability  of the 
Investigational  Medicinal  Product  during  its proposed  clinical  use. 
A new formulation has been developed to reduce the size of the lanifibranor tablet and improve 
compliance to the treatment . The two formulations are be considered as similar as demonstrated by 
a bio -equivalence clinical study ( 337HVPK18006  trial). All characteristics of the investigational 
product remain the same except that t he new formulated  lanifibranor tablet has a  weigh of  
approximately  [ADDRESS_384512] to the initial assignment to treatment arm.  
 
1.4 Summary  of Lanifibranor  Preclinical  and Clinical  Data  
1.4.1 Pharmacology  
NAFLD/NASH  is a multifactorial  and multi -step disease.  A first component  of this pathology  
includes  the metabolic  syndrome  related  to insulin  resistance,  triglyceride  accumulation,  obesity  
etc. A second  component  is the fibrosis.  In our pre-clinical  studies,  we demonstrated  the beneficial  
effect  of IVA337  in several  components  of the metabolic  syndrome  as well as in fibrosis.  
IVA337,  in previous  experiments,  was shown  to exert  an anti-diabetic  and antihyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_312025]/db  mice,  ZDF rats, diet-induced  obese  mice  and the WOKW  rat model  of metabolic  
syndrome.  Furthermore,  it increased  serum  apoA1  level  in human  apoA1  transgenic  mice.  In 
functional  cellular  tests,  IVA337  increased  fatty acid β-oxidation,  stimulated  cholesterol  efflux,  
induced  the expression  of aP2 and adiponectin  genes  as well as ABCA1,  ABCG1  and LXRα  genes,  
while  it reduced  MCP -1 secretion.  All these  effects  are signature  [CONTACT_312152] 3 PPAR  
receptor  isoforms.  
Recently,  it was  demonstrated in vivo that IVA337  displays  an antifibrotic  activity in bleomycin - 
induced  lung fibrosis,  in bleomycin -induced  skin fibrosis  (in preventive  and curative  mode),  in a 
model  of unilateral  ureteral  obstruction  (UUO) -induced  kidney  fibrosis  and in CCL4 -induced  
fibrosis  in the liver.  In the liver,  IVA337  is active  in both preventive  as well as curative  mode,  thus 
providing  evidence  for an anti-fibrotic  effect  in established  fibrotic  disease.  In the liver it was 
demonstrated  that IVA337  at 15 and 30 mg/kg  was able to inhibit  in a dose dependent  manner  the 
collagen  deposition  within  the liver (-42% and -73.16%  respectively).  IVA337  was also able to 
decrease  the serum  triglycerides  and ALT.  
HSC  are the cells responsible  for the secretion  the Extra -Cellular  Matrix  (ECM)  and especially  the 
Page  30 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 collagen  when  activated  (myofibroblast  transdifferenciation  of HSC).  The main  cellular  process  
underwent  by [CONTACT_312096] a fibrogenenic  environment  is proliferation  and activation.  The 
proliferation  assay  is based  on PDGF  and the activation  is based  on stiffness  (stiffness  of the plated  
plastic).  PDGF  is secreted  by a variety  of cell types  and plays  a central  role in fibrogenesis.  It 
induces  HSC  proliferation  and migration,  thus contributing  to the increase  of the number  of matrix - 
secreting  cells.  During  fibrosis,  the growing  deposition  of ECM  increases  the stiffness  of the liver 
and participates  to myofibroblast  transdifferentiation  of HSC.  IVA337  was able to fully inhibit  the 
proliferation  induced  by [CONTACT_312097] α-SMA  and the 
hallmark  of myofibroblast,  induced  by [CONTACT_312098].  These  findings  strongly  support  the anti-fibrotic  
action  of IVA337  in the target  cells.  
Activity  of IVA337  on liver steatosis  and inflammation,  two main  components  of NASH,  was 
evaluated  in a 3-week  model  of MCD  diet in C57bl/6  mice  (report  in preparation).  It was shown  
that IVA337  prevented  steatosis  in a dose-dependent  manner  at the doses  of 10 and 30 mg/kg  
(-88.38%  and -97.89%  respectively  compared  to vehicle,  see Figure 2). IVA337  also prevented  
inflammation  at the doses  of 10 and 30 mg/kg  (-44.03%  and -74.49%  respectively  compared  to 
vehicle).  IVA337  also prevented  the increase  in ALT  transaminase  induced  by [CONTACT_312099] (-49.35%  
and 67.26%  at 10 and 30 mg/kg  respectively),  demonstrating  hepatoprotective  effect.  
 
Figure 2.        IVA337 Reduces Inflammation  and Steatosis  in a [ADDRESS_384513]  to the Biopharmaceutics  Classification  
System  (BCS)  Guidance  and Biopharmaceutics  Drug  Disposition  Classification  System  
(BDDCS):  high permeability  and metabolism,  and low solubility.  It was evidenced  in all tested  
pecies  that IVA337  absorption  is dependent  on the drug substance  form  and formulation,  leading  
to a bioavailability  in animals  from  15% up to > 80%.  An enterohepatic  recycling  was evidenced,  
and a food effect  was observed  in human  in the presence  of high fat breakfast.  
After  oral administration  in humans,  maximum  plasma  levels  (Cmax) of IVA337  were  reached  at 
about  1.0-3.5 hours,  and terminal  plasma  elimination  half-life was around  10-15 h. Both  AUC  and 
Cmax increased  in a linear  but slightly  less than dose-proportional  manner.  Steady -state IVA337  
concentrations  were  generally  achieved  by [CONTACT_2006] 3 after daily  dose administration,  with no 
significant  accumulation.  
The mean  apparent  volume  of distribution  Vz/F  ranged  from  318 to 607 L in healthy  subjects.  
IVA337  was extensively  distributed  in monkeys  (~10 L/kg).  IVA337  binds  very highly  to plasma  
proteins  in all tested  species  (~99.9%)  and no affinity  to blood  cells was observed.  By 
[CONTACT_312100], IVA337  was shown  to be mainly  distributed  in the excretory  organs  (liver,  

Page  31 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384514])  and in placenta  in pregnant  rats with no affinity  for the 
melanin  tissues  and with very limited  central  nervous  system  distribution.  
IVA337 -related  radioactivity  elimination  in human  was mainly  fecal  (> 85%)  and the urinary  
excretion  was minor  (< 7%) with a very low renal  clearance.  The excretion  was essentially  
complete  after 3 days.  
AUC  indicated  that approximately  23% of the radioactivity  in human  plasma  were  related  to 
IVA337,  while  77% were  related  to its metabolites.  
Among  metabolites  identified in plasma,  feces  and urine,  the main  IVA337  metabolites  observed  
in human  were  the acylglucuronide  (IV1197736,  with similar  exposure  to that of the parent  
compound),  a monohydroxylated  (IV1537661)  and the benzothiazole  ring opened  IVA337  
derivative  (IV1197347).  All other  metabolites  were  reported  to represent  less than 5% of the 
administered  dose (14C -ADME  study  in human).  The completion  of the quantitative  comparison  
of the animal  versus  human  plasma  exposure  to these  three  metabolites  is ongoing.  
In vitro  data on drug-drug interaction  of IVA337  and its three  main  human  metabolites  were  
completed.  The data interpretation  was done  following  EMA  and FDA  guidelines  on the 
investigation  of drug interactions,  considering  the therapeutic  dose of 1200  mg (Cmax ~20 µM) and 
estimated  parameters  (Ka, Fa) from  population  PK modelling.  
As victim,  the pharmacokinetic  of IVA337  or its main  human  metabolites  was observed  in vitro  to 
be possibly  sensitive  to the pathways  CYP2C8,  CYP2C19,  CYP3A4,  UGT1A1,  UGT1A3,  
UGT2B7,  MRP2,  MRP3,  OATP1B1  and OATP1B3.  As several  isoforms  of each enzyme  are 
involved  (CYP  and UGT),  a risk of clinical  interaction  via these  pathways  is reduced.  Nevertheless,  
the contribution  of CYP  isoforms  to the formation  of the main  Phase  I metabolites  is still to be 
exemplified.  As regards  to transporters,  clinical  data would  be required  to assess  the possible  
interaction  of comedications  on the IVA337  via these  pathways.  
As perpetrator,  in vitro studies  evidenced  that IVA337  or its main  human  metabolites  may have  an 
impact  on the pharmacokinetics  of drugs  which  are sensitive  to the pathways  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  
UGT1A1,  UGT1A4,  UGT2B7,  BCRP,  MRP2,  MRP3,  OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  and at the intestine 
level  MDR1,  and at the kidney  level  OAT1  and OAT3.  In silico  modelling  will be conducted  for a 
deeper  analysis  on the CYP  and OAT  interactions.  As regards  to MDR1,  BCRP,  OATP  and MRP  
transporters,  clinical  studies  would  be conducted  to assess  the possible  interaction  of IVA337  on 
comedications  via these  pathways.  A first study  was performed  with simvastatin,  substrate  of 
several  pathways  (MDR1,  BCRP,  OATP1B1  but also CYP3A4  and CYP2C8),  which  seemed  not 
to evidence  a significant  drug-drug interaction  (< 2-fold)  although  the increase  of simvastatin  Cmax 
may possibly  be due to MDR1/BCRP  intestinal  inhibition.  
A limited  risk of CYP  induction  could  be expected  in vivo.  No induction  CYP1A2 or CYP2B6  in 
any of the human  hepatocyte  donors  tested  when  incubated  by [CONTACT_312101]337  (N=7)  or its metabolites  
(N=3).  A slight  mRNA  CYP3A4  induction  was observed  (2.3-12 fold, equating  to 0.5-28 % of the 
response  observed  with rifampi[INVESTIGATOR_2513]) at 12.5  µM while  a mRNA repression was  observed  at higher  
concentrations.  CYP3A4  enzyme  activities  (studied  in four donors  with IVA337)  was shown  to be 
slightly  induced  in two donors  after incubation  with IVA337  but only with high concentration  
(> 40 µM).  
No significant  drug-drug interactions  were  observed  with simvastatin  and IVA337  (< 2-fold),  and 
no PK/genotype  (CYP450  isoenzymes  and UGTs  isoform)  relationship  has been  identified.  There  
was a 22% increase  in Cmax and 39% increase  in AUC  of IVA337  in elderly  subjects  as compared  
to young  subjects.  
 
1.4.3 Toxicology  
IVA337  has a very  low acute toxicity  (maximal  non-lethal  dose of 2000  mg/kg  in rodents)  and is 
Page  32 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 not irritating  to the skin.  
IVA337  is devoid  of genotoxic  potential  in the full international  conference  on harmonization  
(ICH)  battery  of genotoxicity  assays.  The three  major  human  metabolites,  IV1197736,  IV1197347  
and IV1537661,  were  also found  devoid  of genotoxic  potential  in a bacterial  reverse  mutation  test 
and a mammalian  cell assay.  
IVA337  is devoid  of deleterious  effects  on vital functions  such as cardiovascular,  central  and 
autonomic  nervous  system  and respi[INVESTIGATOR_36517].  In a 9-week  head-to-head comparative  study  in 
rats aimed  at evaluating  side effects  of PPAR  agonists  such as plasma  volume  expansion  and 
secondary  cardiac  hypertrophy,  or skeletal  muscle  toxicity,   daily   doses   of  IVA337   up  to 1000  
mg/kg  compared  favorably  with other  PPAR  agonists  rosiglitazone,  muraglitazar  and tesaglitazar.  
These  observations  were  substantiated  in repeated  dose toxicity  studies  with IVA337  in rats and 
monkeys.  
No potential  risks  have  been  identified from  pi[INVESTIGATOR_312026]337  in rat  and in 
monkey  and segment  II reproductive  toxicity  studies  in rats and rabbits.  All treatment -related  
findings  (i.e. liver,  bone  marrow,  adipose  tissue)  were  reversible.  
The safety  margins  over expected  human exposure  in general  toxicology studies were at  least 20 -
fold in rats and 3-fold in monkeys  (Table 2). The safety  margins  over expected  human  exposure  
established  in segment  II reproductive  toxicity  studies  were  9-fold in rats and 2-fold in rabbits  
(Table 3). A preliminary  2-week  pharmacokinetic  and toxicity  study  in the mouse,  where  plasma  
exposures  were  markedly  higher  than those  achieved  in volunteers  given  the highest  tested  dose 
of 1500  mg/day  for two weeks  (approximately  40-fold)  and higher  than those  achieved  in the 
chronic  rat study,  has evidenced  signs  of toxicity  for the kidney,  the heart  and the skeletal  muscles,  
in particular  myositis  of skeletal  muscles,  minimal  to moderate  myocarditis  and tubulo -interstitial  
nephritis.  These  organs  are known  targets  for toxicity  of PPAR  agonists.  However,  a recently  
conducted  13-week  study  in mice  established  an adequate  5-fold safety  margin  over expected  
human  exposure  at a NOAEL  (no observed  adverse  effects  levels)  of 25 mg/kg/day.

simvastatin  and simvastatin  acid and to evaluate  the pharmacokinetics  of the two-crystalline  
anhydrous  solid  alpha  and beta forms  of IVA337.  The objectives  of study  S337.1.005  were  to 
assess  the relative  bioavailability  of IVA337  oral suspension  and capsules  (cross -over design),  and 
to assess,  in vivo in human,  the completeness  of excretion,  routes  and rates  of elimination  of 
radioactivity,  the metabolic  pathways,  and identity  of IVA337  metabolites  after single  
administration  of 14C-IVA337.  The objectives  of study  S337.2.001  were  to evaluate  the safety,  
tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics  of IVA337  in doses  of 400 to 1200  mg daily  
over a 4-week  period.  The study  IVA_01_337_HSSC_15_001  is a randomized,  double - blind,  
placebo -controlled,  multicenter  proof -of-concept  trial of IVA337  in the treatment  of diffuse  
cutaneous  systemic  sclerosis  (DcSSc).

 1.5 Rationale  of the Study  Design  
1.5.1 General  Considerations  
This study  is a Phase  II randomized,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled,  single -center,  investigator  
initiated,  24-week  treatment  study  of lanifibranor  in adult  subjects  with T2DM  and NAFLD.  
 
1.5.2 Rationale  for the Choice  of Dose  and Duration  of Repeated  Administration  
The evaluated  treatment  will be as tablets  of lanifibranor  400 mg, one dose of lanifibranor,  800 mg 
once  a day (QD)  versus  placebo,  i.e. two tablets  (lanifibranor  or indistinguishable  placebo)  per os, 
once  daily,  for 24 weeks.  To improve  bioavailability,  drug intake  is combined  with food.  
The dose has been  selected  based  on the available  biomarker  (adiponectin,  HDL  cholesterol,  
triglycerides)  results  in diabetes  type 2 patients  (Phase  IIa study):  800 mg per day: lowest  and 
statistically  significant  active  dose on the markers  of the three  PPAR  ,  and  activity  and being  
well tolerated  
Pharmacodynamic  biomarkers  of PPARs  activation  in diabetic  patients  (Phase  IIa study)  are shown  
in Figure 3. 
Clinical,  biological  and ECG  safety in healthy  volunteers  and diabetic  patients  has been  shown  to 
be good  up to the top dose used in this trial or at doses  that are higher.  There  is no toxicology  target  
organ  of major  concern  in the clinic.  
Placebo  is chosen as the comparator, as there is no licensed treatment for  NAFLD/NASH.  
Treatment duration  has been set to  [ADDRESS_384517],  γGT as well as insulin  resistance  
can be observed  within  a couple  of months  of treatment,  as has been  observed  in several  trials  seen 
with other  PPARs  agonists  (1, 23), suggesting  that treatment  efficacy  can be observed  early  in the 
course  of treatment.  Significant  effect  on hepatic  steatosis  and necroinflammation  has been  
reported  before  at [ADDRESS_384518]  (1). 
The study  imposes  [ADDRESS_384519]  an improvement  of their NAFLD  and 
metabolic  syndrome  based  on the results  of previous  clinical  studies  with PPARα,  γ and α/δ 
agonists.  The dose chosen  for the trial demonstrated  significant  improvement  in biomarkers  of 
PPAR α, γ and probably  δ in diabetic patients.

4 Study  Objectives and Investigational  Plan  
4.1 Aim 
The primary  aim is to establish  the safety,  efficacy  and mechanism  of action  of lanifibranor  in 
patients  with NAFLD  and T2DM.  
Specifically,  to determine  if lanifibranor  decreases  IHTG  (primary  endpoint),  improves  hepatic  
insulin  sensitivity,  endogenous  (hepatic)  glucose  production,  gluconeogenesis  and de novo  
lipogenesis  (DNL).  This will be achieved  by [CONTACT_2329]  a combination  of intravenously  infused  stable  
isotopes  and with the infusion  of a low- and high-dose insulin  infusion  during  a euglycemic  
hyperinsulinemic  clamp  (to quantify  insulin  action)  with indirect  calorimetry  (to measure  substrate  
oxidation).  In addition,  exploratory  analysis  with surrogate  plasma  biomarkers  and imaging  on 
changes  on liver fibrosis  with treatment  will be performed.  
 
4.2 Study  Design  
The study  is a two-arm (placebo,  lanifibranor  800 mg/day),  randomized  (1:1),  double -blind,  
placebo -controlled,  24-week  treatment  study.  There  is in addition  a non-obese  subject  control  
group  for the metabolic  and imaging  procedures.  
The study  will require  32 ± 4 weeks  (4-[ADDRESS_384528]-study  follow -up), with an estimated  recruitment  period  of 6 to 9 months.  
Patients  to be randomized:  34 allowing  for a 10% drop-out rate. 
The overall  study  design  is shown  in Figure 1. 
Page  40 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 Study  Duration  and Procedures  
For each patient,  the research  study  will be divided  as follows:  
• Run-in period:  Screening  visit V1, DM medication  titration  V2, Baseline  studies  V3 and 
Randomization  V4. 
• Interim  V5 (4 weeks  after V4), Interim  V6 (8 weeks  after V4), Interim  V7 (12 weeks  after 
V4), Interim  V8 (16 weeks  after V4), Interim  V9 (20 weeks  after V4). 
• Repeat  baseline  studies  V10 (23 weeks  after V4) and V11 (24 weeks  after V4). 
• Off-drug Follow -up visit V12 (28 weeks  after V4). 
 
4.2.1 Screening  Phase  
We plan to recruit  patients  with uncontrolled  T2DM  and a diagnosis  of “fatty  liver”  per history  
(elevated  AST/ALT  and/or  liver fat on liver ultrasound  or ¹H-MRS  and/or  other  appropriate  
imaging  technique  – see below).  A Fibroscan  study  available  in the research  unit will be performed  
at the initial  screen  visit.  
CAP  test (Fibroscan:  ultrasound -based  elastography  available  in the PI’s outpatient  clinic  and also 
research unit) will be performed at the initial  screening visit  to identify those patients  with a fatty 
liver.  
The goal of the screening  is therefore  to check  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  and adjust  T2DM  
treatment  as described  below.  
Participants  may be treated  by [CONTACT_312108],  or be on a stable  dose of metformin  and/or  a sulfonylurea  
and/or  a DPP-IV inhibitor  for ≥ 2 months  prior  to enrollment.  If the HbA1c  is ≤8.0%  on any of 
these  diabetes  medications,  the dose of these  medications  will be kept stable  throughout  the study  
and baseline  studies  performed as outlined  below. If the HbA1c is > 8.0%  but ≤ 9.5%, metformin  
(minimum  dose required:  1,000  mg/day  for metformin)  and/or  a sulfonylurea  (minimum  dose 
required:  glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956]  2 mg once  daily)  will be added,  or doses  maximized,  during  the first 2 weeks  
of the lead-in period.  The baseline  visit to initiate  lanifibranor  (V4; Time  0 or randomization  visit)  
will be not sooner than [ADDRESS_384529] an 
HbA1c  ≤9.0%  to proceed  to randomization  (V4).  In addition,  if both metformin  and glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956]  
(or another  sulfonylurea)  are already  maximized  at study  entry  (or the patient  is intolerant  to either)  
and the HbA1c  ≥ 9.0%  but ≤9.5%,  we will add sitagliptin  100 mg daily  (or an equivalent  dose of 
another  DPP-IV inhibitor) to reach an HbA1c ≤9.0%  to proceed to randomization (V4).  
Afterwards,  patient’s  metformin  and/or  sulfonylurea  dose and/or  sitagliptin  dose will be 
maintained  at the new stable  dose.  The baseline  visit to initiate  lanifibranor  (V0; Time  0 or 
randomization  visit)  will be not sooner  than [ADDRESS_384530]  a HbA 1c ≤9.0%  to proceed  to randomization  (V0).  
Of note,  due to COVID -19 pandemic , in order  to be able to accomm odate the follow-up study 
procedures (i.e. liver MRI at V10 and insulin  clamp at V11), for already enrolled subjects, treatme nt 
may have to be extended by [CONTACT_312109] 8 weeks.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Intrahepatic  Triglycerides  (IHTG)  
This will be the primary  endpoint  as assessed  by ¹H-MRS  (to be performed  at Day -7).

Liver  ¹H-MRS  , 2D-MRE  and T1 MRI  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]:  Between  days -[ADDRESS_384531] liver fat (IHTG)  and liver fibrosis  (by 2D-MRE  and T1 MRI mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007])  
measured  after at least a [ADDRESS_384532]. 
Admission  for the determination  of hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  gluconeogenesis,  and de novo  
lipogenesis  (DNL):  Between  Day -7 and 0 (to allow  scheduling  flexibility),  subjects  will be 
admitted  to the research  unit in the afternoon  (4:00PM).  Glucose  and metabolism  and DNL  rates  
will be measured  as reported  in the literature  before  (1,2,9,10,12). In brief, patients  will receive  a 
standardized  dinner  and will fast overnight  for at least 10 hours.  Subjects  will be given  an oral 
dose (350 ml) of 70% deuterium  labeled  water  (D2O),  between  5 PM and midnight  and prior  to 
the metabolic  experiments  on the next day. After  6:[ADDRESS_384533] without  the overnight  stay. You will still need  to come  to the CRC  the day before  the 
procedure  at ~4:00  to 7:00PM to have a blood  test done  and receive  the heavy  water  that you will 
drink  at home  (following  the same  instructions  as if you were  admitted).  If you choose  not to stay 
overnight  you will need a driver  the day of the procedure  as the heavy  water  can produce  some  
dizziness.  
The day of the procedure  we will start at ~5:00 -6:00AM.  A bolus  of [6,6-2H2]  glucose  (4.8 mg/kg  
body  weight)  will be given  at 6:00 AM on day 2 followed  by a constant  infusion  (0.08  mg/kg  body  
weight/min)  until the end of the study.  Indirect  calorimetry  will be performed  with a ventilated  
hood  starting  at 8:00 AM on day 2 and at regular  intervals.  Baseline  endogenous  glucose  
production  (EGP)  will be measured  150-180 minutes  after starting  [6,6-2H2]  glucose  to allow  time 
for steady  state enrichment  of plasma  glucose  following  standard  principles  of stable  isotope  
dilution  techniques.  After  baseline  glucose  and lipid turnover  measurements,  subjects  will undergo  
a two-step euglycemic  insulin  clamp  with a low- and high-dose insulin  infusion  combined  with 
substrate  oxidation  determinations  (i.e., indirect  calorimetry)  (see Appendix  D).

[IP_ADDRESS]  Surrogate  Imaging  and Plasma  Biomarkers  of Hepatic  Fibrosis  
These  will be measured  by [CONTACT_312089]:  
• Vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan)  (3): An established  technique  that 
allows  to monitor  fibrosis  non-invasively  at the bedside  and outpatient  setting.  (V11).  
• Two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (MRE)  (4). To be done  during  the 
IHTG  ¹H-MRS  measurement.  To be done  at V10.  
• T1 MRI mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007]  (5): A novel  scanning  protocol  that allows  for a complementary  non- 
invasive  measurement  of liver fibrosis  (in collaboration  with the Oxford  laboratory  of R. 
Banerjee  et al). To be done  at V10.  
• Plasma  biomarkers  of liver fibrosis:  Established  (cytokeratin  CK-18, HA, TIMP -1) and 
novel  (pro-C3) plasma  will be tested  to gain insights  into the role of treatment  on liver 
fibrosis  using  surrogate  markers  of disease.  To be done  at V11.  
4.2.3 Off-study  Drug  Follow -up Period  (4 weeks)  
After  all 24 week  procedures,  a 4-week  safety  period  of observation  will follow  to ensure  that 
patients  are stable  and the patient  has a follow -up with their PCP and/or  endocrinologist.  
4.2.4 Patient  Management  at the End of Treatment  
The trial treatment  is stopped  after V11.  
After  the follow -up, the investigator/hepatologists/general  practitioner  will decide,  according  to 
each patient,  the need  to use the lifestyle  changes  recommendations  whenever  appropriate  and 
treatment  of comorbidi ties. 
If the study  is positive  there  will be further  trials  for which  these  patients  may be eligible.  
4.2.5 Total  Study  Duration  
The total time (from  first patient  enrolled  to last patient  finished)  will be 32±4  weeks  (4-[ADDRESS_384534]-study  follow -up), with an estimated  recruitment  
period  of 32-40 weeks  (conservatively  set at ~1-2 patients  per week,  including  about  30% of 
patients  that will not qualify  [n=16 -20] and about  10 % dropouts/intolerant  to lanifibranor  that 
require  additional  recruitment  [n=8].  
Of note,  due to COVID -19 pandemic , in order  to be able to accomm odate the follow-up study 
procedures (i.e. liver MRI at V10 and insulin  clamp at V11), for already enrolled subjects, treatme nt 
may have to be extended by [CONTACT_312109] 8 weeks. After all procedures are 
completed and subjects are off drug,  an additi onal 4-week  safety  period  of observation will follow  as 
specified in section 4.2.3 .

 4.3 Study  Population  and Inclusion/Non -inclusion  Criteria  
We propose  to randomize  34 otherwise  healthy  overweight  or obese  patients  with uncontrolled  
T2DM  (HbA1c ≥ 6.0% to ≤ 9.5%)  and NAFLD  on imaging (see section  8). 
Ten healthy  non-obese  subjects  without  NAFLD  will also be studied  as “normal  controls”  for all 
the metabolic  and imaging  tests to be performed  (V1, V3 and V4). We will study  them  only to 
examine  the response  of a person  without  diabetes  to the study  tests to be performed  in the patients  
with type 2 diabetes  who are participating  in the clinical  trial. In other  words,  they will be a 
“healthy  control”  to compare  the results  of blood  tests,  metabolic  studies  and imaging  studies  to 
be done  in patients  with diabetes  participating  in the study.  Inclusion/Exclusion  for the healthy  
controls  will follow  those  noted  in the protocol  for patients  with diabetes  receiving  treatment  
except  that they will not have  Type  2 diabetes  based  on a hemoglobin  A1c and will be non-obese,  
BMI < 30 kg/m2. 
The diagnosis of NAFLD  on imaging will be done  by [CONTACT_312111]  
(IHTG)  using  the gold-standard  magnetic  resonance  and spectroscopy  (¹H-MRS)  technique.  
Pregnant  women,  prisoners,  institutionalized  individuals,  or others  who may be considered  
vulnerable  populations  will be excluded.  The ethnic  mix will reflect  the base population  in the 
North  [LOCATION_012]/Alachua  County  area is 70-75% Caucasian,  15-20% African -American,  5-10% 
Hispanic,  and 5% other  ethnicities.  We will only study  otherwise  healthy  subjects  with T2DM  
based  on medical  history,  physical  exam,  and blood  chemistries  and hematologic  tests.  Body  
weight  (≤ 5%) and physical  activity  should  have  been  stable  for at least [ADDRESS_384535] double -blind  study  drug dose.  Subjects  may be eligible  for randomization  
if the FPG ≥ 100 mg/dL  and ≤ 250 mg/dL)  at the Week  -6 visit,  and meet  all other  eligibility  
criteria  (including Day  -28 fasting fingerstick  glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL  and ≤ 250 mg/dL).

and/or sulfonylurea a nd/or DPP -IV therapy SGLT2 inhibitors. These medicines will be 
continued at stable doses during the entire study.  
• Subjects with  an HbA1c > 8.0%  but ≤ 9.5%  will have their metformin  (minimum  dose 
required:  1,000  mg/day)  maximized  to 1,000  mg BID and/or  glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956]  [ADDRESS_384537] 2 weeks  of the run-in period.  The baseline  visit to initiate  
lanifibranor  (V4; Time 0 or randomization  visit)  will be not sooner  than [ADDRESS_384538]  an HbA1c  ≤9.0%  to procee d 
to randomization  (V4).  
• In addition,  if both metformin  and glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956]  (or another  sulfonylurea)  are already  
maximized  at study  entry  (or the patient  is intolerant  to either)  and the HbA1c  ≥ 9.0%  
but ≤9.5%,  we will add sitagliptin  100 mg daily  (or an equivalent  dose of another  DPP- 
IV inhibitor) to reach  an HbA1c  ≤9.0% to proceed  to randomization  (V4).

4.4.2 Treatments  Administered  
This double  blinded  placebo -controlled  study  involves  a therapeutic  dose of 800 mg lanifibranor  
(QD).  
The lanifibranor  tablets  and PTM  are packaged  into round  high-density  polyethylene  (HDPE)  
bottles  containing  38 tablets  for a treatment  period  of one month,  plus a use margin  of 1 week  with 
proper  closures  fitted  with a silicagel  cartridge.  Two bottles  each (either  active  or placebo)  are 
assembled  in a carton  to compose  monthly  Kits as detailed  below:  
• Placebo  Kit: Morning  (P+P)  
• 800 mg Kit: Morning  (A+A)  
Page  48 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 Where  P denotes  the placebo  tablet  and A denotes  the active  tablet  (400 mg). 
A total of 6 monthly  patient  kits (2 HDPE  Bottles  of 38 tablets  each)  is representing  the treatment  
per patient  for the clinical  study.  
 
4.4.3 Medication  Dispensing  
[IP_ADDRESS]  Medication  Dispensing  
The patients  receive  3 monthly  patient  kits at V4 and 3 monthly  patient  kits at V6. They  are 
instructed  to take morning  2 tablets  with food,  i.e. one tablet  from  either  the one of the two 
containers.  The overall  treatment  duration  is 24 weeks.  However,  due to COVID -19 pandemic , in 
order to be able to accommodate the follow-up study  procedures (i.e. liver MRI at V10 and insulin  
clamp at V11),  for already enrolled subjects, treatment  may have to be extended  by [CONTACT_312112] [ADDRESS_384547] dose and any dosage  
modifications  by [CONTACT_312113].  
 
4.4.4 Selection  and Timing  of Dose  for Each  Patient  
Patients  will be randomized  equally  1:1: to either  dose of lanifibranor  or placebo.  
The randomization  list will be setup  with blocs  of size equal  to 4. 
The randomization  list will be produced  by a statistician  of Keyrus  Biopharma  according  to their 
SOPs  and will be used to prepare  the medication  accordingly.  Each  eligible  subject  will be 
randomized  to placebo  or lanifibranor  according  to the randomization  scheme  at the time of 
randomization  visit (V4).  
Treatment  numbers  will be allocated  in ascending  order  using  the next available  consecutive  
number.  
One copy  of this list will be sent to the company  responsible  for manufacturing  and labelling  of 
the treatment  (AMATSI)  and another  blind  copy  will be sent to the investigator.  These  copi[INVESTIGATOR_312039].  
The blind  copy  will contain  three  additional  columns  and the investigator  will have to complete  
the columns  “Randomization  date”,  “Patient  number”  and “Investigator  initials”  after each 
randomization.  
Two separate  sealed envelopes  (one for the investigator,  one for STRAGEN)  will be prepared  by 
[CONTACT_312114].  These  individual  envelopes  will contain  the identity  of the study  medication  
allocated  to the patient  in case of emergency  (see §9.2.1).  
 
4.4.5 Labeling

5.2.4 Electrocardiogram  
12-lead ECGs  will be performed  at Screening  (V1),  and the end-of-treatment  visit (V11).  
 
5.2.5 Vital  Signs  
Blood  pressure  will be measured  by [CONTACT_2329]  a sphygmomanometer.  The results  will be recorded  in 
millimeters  of mercury  (mmHg).  Pulse  rate will be measured  for 30 seconds  and will be recorded  
as beats/minute.  Blood  pressure  and pulse  will be measured  lying  after at least a 10-minute  rest. 
 
5.3 Procedures  at Each  Visit  
5.3.1 Screening  (V1) 
The Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312044]’s  medical  records.  Both  will go through  the informed  consent  and the Principal  Investigator  
[INVESTIGATOR_312045].  
The patient  is given  enough  time to discuss  his/her  participation  to the study  with his/her  family,  
friends  and family  doctor.  
The patient  is asked  to date and sign the “Informed  consent  form”,  prior  to any study  procedure.  
Screening  (V1) procedures  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”.  (see Table 1) 
Medical  history  including  concomitant  medication  is reviewed.  
Physical  examination  (vital  signs,  weight,  height  and waist  measurement)  is performed.  
12-lead ECG,  routine  chemistries  (CBC,  CMP,  lipi[INVESTIGATOR_805],  CPK,  CPK -MB, HbA1c)  and urinalysis  
(including  urine  pregnancy  test) are performed.  
TSH,  free T4, not necessary  if available  within  the past 12 months.  
Fibroscan  procedures:  CAP  and VCTE  are performed.  
In subjects  with abnormal  labs, baseline  measure  (BLM)  should  be determined  by [ADDRESS_384552],  ALT,  ALP,  and total 
bilirubin  should  be small  (<20%).  
Subjects  with an HbA1c  > 8.0%  but ≤ 9.5%  will have  their metformin  (minimum  dose required:  
1,000  mg/day  for metformin)  maximized  to 1,000  mg BID and/or  glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956]  [ADDRESS_384553] 2 weeks  of the run-in period.  
In addition,  if both metformin  and glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956]  (or another  sulfonylurea)  are already  maximized  at 
study  entry  (or the patient  is intolerant  to either)  and the HbA1c  is ≥ 9.0%  but ≤9.5%,  sitagliptin  
100 mg daily  (or an equivalent  dose of another  DPP-IV inhibitor)  will be added.  
All patients  on concomitant  anti-diabetic  medications  should  have,  or be provided  with,  a glucose  
monitor  and instructions  for its use. Fasting  blood  glucose  and spontaneous  measurements  in the 
event  of suspected  hypoglycemia  should  be routinely  monitored  by [CONTACT_312121]  (in their glucose  monitoring  device  or diaries)  to be discussed  at each visit with study  
staff.  Patients  will be instructed  on actions  to take in the event  of hypoglycemia  in accordance  with 
standard  of care.  
Finally,  eligibility  criteria  are reviewed  and if the patient  is eligible,  the next visit should  take place  
within  2 weeks  +/- 5 days.

5.3.2 Medication  Titration  (V2) at Week  -4 
The assessments  performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”  (see Table 1). 
The key procedure  at this visit is the DM medication  titration  done  by [CONTACT_3655],  with assessment  
including  a fasting  fingerstick  glucose  procedure.  
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the previous  visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs 
reporting.  
 
5.3.3 Baseline  Visit  (V3) at Week  -1 
The procedures  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”  (see Table 1). 
Liver  imaging:  liver fibrosis  (MRE)  and T1 MR mappi[INVESTIGATOR_312046].  
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the previous  visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs 
reporting.  
 
5.3.4 Randomization  Time  0 (V4) 
The assessments  to be performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”.  (see Table 1) 
At this visit,  the eligibility  of the patient  is confirmed  (inclusion/exclusion  criteria).  
Patient  will be admitted  to the CRC  (clinical  research  unit) including  overnight  stay. 
Inpatient  metabolic  testing  will be performed:  insulin  sensitivity  study,  DNL  and GNG.  
Blood  sampling  using  kits and instructions  provided  will be done  for safety  and efficacy  purposes.  
Blood  samples  will be taken  in the morning  after overnight  fasting.  The patient  must  be fasting  
overnight  from  10:[ADDRESS_384554] visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  6 for AEs reporting  
Concomitant  medications  are also reported.  
The patients  are then randomized  and receive  3 monthly  patient  kits of medication.  Each  kit will 
contain  2 bottles.  Each  kit contains  4-weeks  plus 1-week  margin  of tablets.  
Patients  are carefully  instructed  to take morning  2 tablets  with food,  i.e. one tablet  from  either  
container.  
Patients  are also carefully  instructed  to come  back  to the site in case of symptoms  of dyspnea,  
edema,  or a presumptive  diagnosis  of heart  failure.  NT-proBNP  should  be measured  as close  to 
the event  as possible.  They  will also be instructed  to call the investigator  in case of new or 
worsening  symptoms  of clinical  hepatitis,  including  loss of appetite,  fatigue,  mild fever,  muscle  or 
joint aches,  nausea  and vomiting.  This will be reminded  to them  at each subsequent  visit.  Patients  
and caregivers  accompanying  them  during  the study  visits  will receive  education  for potential  
symptoms  of adverse  effects  that should  be reported  to the investigators,  such as skeletal  muscle  
pain,  weight  gain,  peripheral  edema,  shortness  of breath,  or new or worsening  symptoms  of clinical  
hepatitis  (RUQ  pain,  dark urine,  extreme  fatigue,  nausea  and vomiting),  mild fever,  etc. These  
will be asked  and recorded  at each visit.  
Important  is to remind  the patients,  to bring  back  the unused  medication  at each visit.  
 
5.3.5 Follow -up Visits  (V5) at Week  4, (V6)  at Week  8, (V7)  at Week  12, (V8) at Week  
16 and (V9) at week 20 
The assessments  to be performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures” . (see Table 1) 
Please  note that the follow -up visits  are not at regular  intervals  and the assessments  vary from  one 
Page  54 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384555] or ALT  > 2 times  baseline  measure  or total 
bilirubin  > 1.[ADDRESS_384556] visit.  
Concomitant  medications  are recorded.  
If 2 months  after randomization,  i.e. (V6) at Week  8, sitagliptin  100 mg/day  will be added  the 
HbA1c  exceeds  ≥9.5%.  If the subject  is already  on sitagliptin  (or an equivalent  dose of another  
DPP-IV inhibitor),  or has a history  of intolerance  to DPP-IV inhibitors,  bedtime  long-acting  insulin  
Lantus  at 0.3 units/kg  will be started  and titrated  aiming  to keep  the fasting  plasma  glucose  below  
120 mg/dL.  If at 4 months,  i.e. (V8) at Week  16, the HbA1c  remains  ≥9.5%  and the patient  is 
already  on maximal  doses  of metformin,  sulfonyurea  and sitagliptin,  as well as on insulin,  the 
patient  will be discontinued  from  the study  due to non-adherence  to therapy.  
At V7, patient  receives  3 monthly  patient  kits of medication.  Each  kit will contain  2 bottles. Each  
kit contains  4-weeks  plus 1-week  margin  of tablets.  
For affected  subjects  due to COVID -19 pandemic,  in case drug treatment  has to be extended  for 
1-8 weeks,  additional  safety  labs (CBC,  CMP,  CK, and lipase)  if not available  in the past [ADDRESS_384557]  to be re-collected  prior  to the treatment  extension.  Additional  medication  dispensing  if 
needed  will be performed  in an unscheduled  visit.  If any adverse  reaction  occur  during  this period  
patient  will be seen in an unscheduled  visit as needed.  
5.3.6 Repeat Baseline Studies (V10) at Week  23 and at (V11) at Week 24 
The assessments  to be performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”  (see Table 1). 
The assessments  are different  in V10 and V11 (see below).  
Blood  sampling  using  kits and instructions  provided  will be performed  for safety  and efficacy  
purposes.  
Key procedures  at each visit are the following:  
At (V10)  liver imaging:  liver fibrosis  (MRE)  and T1 MR mappi[INVESTIGATOR_312047].  
At (V11)  patient  will be admitted  to the CRC  (research  unit)  including  an overnight  stay. 
Inpatient  metabolic  testing  is performed:  including  HbA1c,  insulin  sensitivity  study,  DNL  and 
GNG.  
AEs,  if any occurred  since  the previous  visit,  are reported.  Please  refer to section  [ADDRESS_384558] to be complete d out of window  by [CONTACT_312122].  
 
5.3.7 Off-Drug  Follow -up (V12)  at Week  [ADDRESS_384559] patient’s  visit includes:  concomitant  medications  and AEs reporting,  vital signs,  routine  
Page  55 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384560] among  other  assessments.  
All the assessments to be  performed  are listed  on the “Study  Schedule  of Procedures”. (see Table 
1). 
For those  subjects  where  the course  of the study  was affected  by [CONTACT_25963] -19 pandemic , and 
treatment  was extended  for no longer  than 1-8 weeks,  the final off-drug follow-up visit 12 will be 
performed 4 weeks after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_49080].  
 
5.3.8 Unscheduled/Safety  Visits  
During  the all treatment  and the follow -up period,  the investigator  may conduct  unscheduled  visit 
that may perform  again  study  procedures,  including  vital signs  assessments,  blood  sample  taken  
and physical  examination. These visits will have  to be motivated by [CONTACT_312123].  
Specific  events  listed  below  will automatically  generate  an unscheduled/safety  visit:  
- If patients  develop  elevations  of AST  or ALT  > 2 times  baseline  measure  or total bilirubin  
> 1.[ADDRESS_384561]  (if not on a DPP-IV inhibitor)  or 
>2.0X  ULN  if taking  a DPP-IV  inhibitor,  will be retested  within  [ADDRESS_384562]  values  are > ULN  or the subject  becomes  symptomatic,  they should  be 
discontinued  from  drug.  
Please  also refer to section  9.1 for patient  withdrawal  criteria.  
6 Safety  Assessment  
6.1 Adverse  Events  
All adverse  events  (AEs),  regardless  of severity  or potential  relationship  to study  drug,  will be 
recorded  using  medical  terminology  in the source  document  and the eCRF  
6.1.1 Definitions  
• Adverse  event:  Any untoward  medical  occurrence  in a patient  administered  the 
investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP)  and which  does not necessarily  have  a causal  
relationship  with the IMP.  An adverse  event  (AE)  can therefore  be any unfavourable  and 
unintended  sign (including  an abnormal  laboratory  finding),  symptom,  or disease  
temporally  associated  with the use of the IMP,  whether  or not considered  related  to the 
IMP.  
• Suspected  adverse  reaction : Any AE for which  there  is a reasonable  possibility  that the 
IMP caused  the AE. All untoward  and unintended  responses  to the IMP related  to any dose 
administered.  All AEs judged  by [CONTACT_312124]  a reasonable  causal  relationship  
(i.e. unlikely,  possible  or probable)  to the IMP qualify  as suspected  adverse  reactions.  The 
expression  “reasonable  causal  relationship”  means  there  is evidence  to suggest  a causal  
relationship  between  the IMP and the AE. Suspected  adverse  reaction  implies  a lesser  
degree  of certainty  about  causality  than adverse  reaction,  which  means  any AE caused  by 
[CONTACT_2203].  
  
Page  56 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
6.1.2 Collection  
The condition  of the patients  will be monitored  throughout  the study.  
Any AE (including  laboratory  test abnormalities,  patient’s  subjective  symptoms,  intercurrent  
illnesses  or injuries,  and/or  study  procedures -related  AE) reported  spontaneously  by [CONTACT_13935],  
or observed  by [CONTACT_312125],  will be recorded  in the source  records  and the 
eCRF.  
Any untoward  medical  event,  which  occurs  from  the time of signed  Informed  Consent  to the time 
of first IMP administration,  will be classified  as “non  treatment -emergent  AE. An AE includes:  
A clinically  relevant  worsening  of an existing  illness  and/or  a clinical  laboratory  adverse  event  
(CLAE):  a laboratory  abnormality  that is clinically  significant  and suggests  toxicity  of a magnitude  
that requires  active  management  (either  active  treatment  or more  clinical  investigations,  such as 
more  frequent  follow -up to monitor  the abnormality.  
The following  are not to be reported  as AEs:  
- Pre-existing  conditions  found at screening  or before  exposure  to trial drug:  they should  be 
included  instead  in the medical  history  or concomitant  procedures.  
- Non-severe  hypoglycemia  is to be considered  an AE, but will be reported  under  
hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_312048].  
- Pre-planned  procedures,  unless  the condition  for which  the procedure  was planned  has 
worsened  since  the participant  has signed  the informed  consent  form  
6.1.3 Intensity  Rating  
- The Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE:  
https://www.eortc.be/services/doc/ctc/CTCAE_4.03_2010 -06- 
14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf  ) will be used for reporting  AEs.  
The intensity  of an AE will  be rated  as follows:  
- Grade  1 Mild;  asymptomatic  or mild symptoms;  clinical  or diagnostic  observations  only;  
intervention  not indicated.  
- Grade  2 Moderate;  minimal,  local  or non-invasive  intervention  indicated;  limiting  age- 
appropriate  instrumental  Activities  of Daily  Living  (ADL)  (preparing  meals,  shoppi[INVESTIGATOR_312049],  using  the telephone,  managing  money,  etc.) 
- Grade  3 Severe  or medically  significant  but not immediately  life-threatening;  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_3526];  disabling;  limiting  self-care 
ADL  (bathing,  dressing  and undressing,  feeding  self, using  the toilet,  taking  medications,  
and not bedridden)  
- Grade  4 Life-threatening  consequences;  urgent  intervention  indicated.  
- Grade  5 Death  related  to AE. 
Mild : no interference  with the patient’s  daily  activities  and does not require  mandatory  
corrective/symptomatic  treatment.  
- Moderate : moderate  interference  with the patient’s  daily  activities  and/or  requires  minimal  
medical  intervention  or corrective  treatment  required.  
- Severe : major  and unacceptable  interference  with the patient’s  daily  activities  and requires  
mandatory  corrective/symptomatic  treatment,  possible  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059].  
  
Page  57 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
6.1.4 Causality  Rating  
The causal  relationship  of an AE to the IMP will be rated  as follows:  
- Unrelated : Clearly  and incontrovertibly  due only to extraneous  causes, and  does not meet  
criteria  listed  under  unlikely,  possible  or probable.  
- Unlikely : Does  not follow  a reasonable  temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the IMP 
or is most  likely  related  to another  etiology  than the trial drug such as the patient’s  clinical  
state,  environmental  factors  or other  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  
- Possible : Follows  a reasonable temporal  sequence  from  administration  of the IMP,  and/or  
a causal  relationship  cannot  be excluded  and remains  likely.  
- Probable : good  reason  (such  as clear -cut temporal  association  with improvement  on 
cessation  of the IMP or reduction  in dose,  or reappears  upon  (accidental)  rechallenge,  or 
follows  a known  pattern  of response  to the IMP)  and sufficient  documentation  to assume  a 
causal  relationship.  
6.1.[ADDRESS_384563] visit,  the investigator  will make  thorough  efforts  to document  the outcome.  
 
Definitions:  
- Recovered/resolved : The subject  has fully recovered,  or by [CONTACT_312126]-related  activity  
after the subject  signed  the informed  consent.  
- Recovering/resolving : The condition  is improving  and subject  expected  to recover  from  
the mentioned  event.  
- Recovered/resolved  with sequelae:  The subject  has recovered  from  AE but with lasting  
effect  due to a disease,  injury,  treatment  or procedure.  
- Not recovered : The condition  has not improved  or the symptoms  are unchanged.  Also,  if 
the outcome  is unknown.  
- Fatal : To be used only if the subject  has died from  the condition/reported  adverse  event.  
An AE with fatal outcome  must  be reported  as an SAE.  
- Unknown : There  is no available  information  related  to the condition  of the AE. 
6.1.[ADDRESS_384564] IMP administration  will be considered  
as AEs if they worsen  after the start of the IMP.  
Page  58 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
  
6.2 Serious  Adverse  Events  
6.2.1 Definitions  
A Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  is any untoward  medical  occurrence  or effect  that at any dose:  
• results  in death;  
• is life-threatening  (at the time of the event);  
• requires  in patient  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_40088];  
• results  in persistent  or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• is a congenital  anomaly/birth  defect;  
• or is an important  medical  event.  
Death:  the death  of a patient  enrolled  in a clinical  study  is per se not an event,  but an outcome.  An 
AE resulting  in a fatal outcome  must  be fully documented  and reported,  including  if the death  
occurred  after treatment  end, and regardless  of the causality  relationship  of the death  to the IMP.  
The cause  of the death  is usually  the AE. If the cause  cannot  be determined,  the case will be 
considered  an unexplained  death  
Life-threatening : an AE that places  the patient,  in the view  of the initial  reporter  (investigator),  at 
immediate  risk of death  from  the AE as it occurred,  i.e. it does not include  an AE that, had it 
occurred  in a more  severe  form,  might  have  caused  death.  
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]:  a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_113617] a diagnosis  or therapeutic  procedure  planned  before  study  
enrolment  but performed  after the enrolment  should  not be considered  for SAE  and should  be 
reported  in the eCRF  in the medical  history  or concomitant  procedures  page.  
Disability:  a substantial  disruption  of a person’s  ability  to conduct  normal  life functions.  
Important  medical  event:  an important  medical  event  that may not result  in death,  be life- 
threatening,  or require  hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312050] a SAE  when,  based  upon  appropriate  
medical  judgment, it may jeopardize the patient  and may require medical  or surgical  intervention  
to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in the definition.  The concept  includes  AEs which  suggest  a 
significant  hazard,  contraindication  or precaution  for use, occurrence  of malignancy  or 
development  of drug dependency  or drug abuse.  
 
Other  events  for immediate  reporting  
Overdose : an overdose of  an IMP is the accidental  or intentional  administration  of a dose  higher  
than the highest  dose under  clinical  investigation.  An overdose  will be documented  and reported  
in an expedited  manner  with the same  procedure  and timelines  as for SAEs  (see section  6.3.1 ), 
independently  from  the occurrence  of an AE. 
Pregnancy : The occurrence  of a pregnancy  of a study  patient  or a partner  of a study  patient  
discovered  during  IMP administration  or within [ADDRESS_384565] administration  of the IMP,  is to 
be reported  in an expedited  manner  with the same  procedure  and timelines  as for SAEs  (see section   
6.3.1 ), independently  from  the occurrence  of an AE. Specific  follow -up of the event  will be done  
by [CONTACT_312127],  following  standard  procedures  established  by [CONTACT_312128]  (IRB).  
 
6.[ADDRESS_384566] knowledge,  report  any SAE  
Page  59 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384567]  (DSMB)  and IRB that 
approved  the protocol.  
The investigator will  complete sign a SAE  Report  Form  and transmit it to the DSMB  and IRB by 
[CONTACT_312129] [ADDRESS_384568] knowledge  of the SAE.  The DSMB  and IRB 
acknowledge  the receipt  of the SAE  information  by [CONTACT_312130] (unless  on a weekend  or Holiday  when  reporting  will occur  on the first working  day).  
In the absence  of email  acknowledging  the receipt,  or in case of any issue  in sending  the fax or 
email,  the investigator  shall  contact  [CONTACT_312131].  
Any follow -up information  will be reported  to the DSMB  and IRB as soon  as it becomes  known,  
with the same  process  and timelines  as described  here above  for initial  reports.  
SAEs  occurring  after the last study  visit will only be reported  if the investigator  believes  that the 
event  may have  been  caused  by [CONTACT_312132] a protocol  procedure.  
6.3.2 IND safety  reporting  requirements  
The investigator  will be responsible  for the declaration  of suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse  
reactions  (S[LOCATION_003]Rs)  according  to US FDA  regulation.  Expectedness  will be based  on the safety  
reference  document  i.e. the Investigator  Brochure  (IB).  
6.3.3 Reporting  to Inventiva  SA 
Inventiva  SA, through  its new pharmacovigilance  contractor,  United BioSource Corporation 
(UBC) , will be copi[INVESTIGATOR_312051]:  [EMAIL_6140]  
UBC  will ensure  that appropriate  cross -reporting  of S[LOCATION_003]R  originating  from  the present  
clinical  trial is performed  in all countries  with on-going  lanifibranor  trials.  
6.3.4 Cross -reporting  
S[LOCATION_003]R  and SAE’s  occurring  from  other  on-going  lanifibranor  trials  will be sent by [CONTACT_312133], 
through  its pharmacovigilance  contractor,  UBC , to the investigator  for reporting  to local  
competent  authorities  in accordance  with local  regulation.

All safety  variables  will be primary  ones.  Safety  evaluations  will be completed  as given  in section  
8.7 and as indicated  below.  
The investigator will  rate all safety variables  as to clinical  relevance or not. In case of a clinically  
relevant  abnormality,  the safety  evaluation  will be repeated.  If the abnormality  is confirmed  and 
clinically  relevant,  it will be recorded  as an AE term in the eCRF.  The abnormality  will be followed  
up until the value  has returned  to normal  or an adequate  explanation  is found.  
Safety  endpoints  
Secondary  safety  endpoints  will be used to support  the safety  objectives  of the study,  such as the 
number  of treatment -emergent  adverse  events,  including  hypoglycemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_1841]  (i.e., blood - 
confirmed  glucose  levels  below  40 and 70 mg/dL,  severe  symptomatic  hypoglycaemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_312052]),  as well as haematologic  and biochemical  tests as described  in Table 6 below.  
Hypoglycaemic  epi[INVESTIGATOR_312053]: a) Number  and percentage  of 
subjects  with at least one event;  b) Total  number  of events  and per ADA  category  (see below);  and 
c) Event  rate per 100 patient  years  of exposure.  
The study  will use the ADA  classification/criteria  of hypoglycaemia  as follows  (35): 
Page  60 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 • Severe  hypoglycaemia:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_312054],  glucagon,  or take other  corrective  actions.  Plasma  glucose  
concentrations  may not be available  during  an event,  but neurological  recovery  following  
the return  of plasma  glucose  to normal  is considered  sufficient  evidence  that the event  was 
induced  by a low plasma  glucose  concentration.  
• Asymptomatic  hypoglycaemia:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_312055],  but with a measured  plasma  glucose concentration  ≤ 70 mg/dL.  
• Documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia: An  epi[INVESTIGATOR_312056] a measured  plasma  glucose  concentration  ≤ 70 mg/dL.  
• Pseudo -hypoglycaemia:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_312057] a measured  plasma  glucose  concentration  > 
70 mg/dL  but approaching  that level.  
• Probable  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia:  An epi[INVESTIGATOR_312058] a plasma  glucose  determination  but that was 
presumably  caused by a  plasma  glucose concentration  ≤ 70 mg/dL . 
 
6.4.1 Physical  Examination  
Physical  examinations  will be conducted  by [CONTACT_473].  Any findings  will be documented  in 
the source  document  and recorded  in the eCRF.  
 
6.4.2 Laboratory  Tests  
Laboratory  tests will be analyzed  mainly  at the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_312042].  
Additional  samples  for laboratory  safety  variables  may be drawn  at any time during  the study  at 
the investigators  judgment.  The laboratory  assessments  performed  at each visit are listed  in the 
following  table  (see Table 6).

7 Data Quality  Assurance  
7.1 Monitoring  
The PI [INVESTIGATOR_312060],  the monitors  will verify  the 
adherence  to the protocol,  the maintenance  of all study -related  records  and the accuracy  and 
Page  64 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 completeness  of all eCRF  entries  compared  with source  data in order  to ensure  that: 
• Data  are authentic,  accurate,  and complete.  
• Safety  and rights  of subjects  are being  protected.  
• Study  is conducted  in accordance  with the currently  approved  protocol,  ICH-GCP  and all 
applicable  regulatory  requirements  
 
Any discrepancies  identified  must  be resolved.  The monitors  will review  source  documents  to 
confirm  that the data recorded  on eCRF  is accurate.  The investigator  and institution  appropriate  
regulatory  authorities’  direct  access  to source  documents  to perform  the verification according  to 
University  of [LOCATION_012]  standards  for clinical  trials.  All data must  be verifiable  in source  
documentation  other  than the eCRF.  
The study  sites may be subject  to review  by [CONTACT_312134]  (IRB)/Data  Safety  and 
Monitoring  Board  (DSMB),  and/or  to quality  assurance  audits,  and/or  to inspection  by [CONTACT_312135].  The collection  and processing  of personal  data from  subjects  enrolled  in this 
study  will be limited  to those  data that are necessary  to fulfill  the objectives  of the study.  
It is important  that the investigator(s)  and their relevant  personnel  are available  during  the 
monitoring  visits  and possible  audits  or inspections  and that sufficient  time is devoted  to the 
process.  
 
7.2 Data  Recording  
Electronic  Data Capture  (EDC)  will be used for this study,  meaning  that all data will be entered  
on an  eCRF  at the investigational  site. This eCRF  will be specifically  designed  for the study.  We 
will use a program  called  REDCap™  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture;  
https: //www.ctsi.ufl.edu/research/study -design -and-analysis/redcap).  It is a secure,  Web -based  
application  designed  to support  traditional  case report  form  data capture  for research  studies  
performed  at NIH-based  Clinical  Translational  Science  Institutes  (CTSIs)  use. It is a flexible  
platform  that allows  Export  data to Microsoft  Excel  and statistical  packages  for easy data analysis.  
This database  platform  has several  practical  advantages:  
• HIPAA  Compliant  
• Data  is stored  on a secure  server  
• Database  access  requires  user authentication  with password  
• Data  access  based  on an individual’s  role on a project  
• Logging  and audit  trails  on all data interactions  
• IRB and UF Privacy  Office  approved  for collection  and storage  of PHI (private  health  
information).  
The University  of [LOCATION_012]  (UF)  requires  that all data collected  or stored  in REDCap  follow  the 
following  processes  and procedures:  
• All human  research  studies  must  have  Institutional  Review  Board  (IRB)  approval  before  
the research  study  can be moved  to production  and data collection  can commence.  
• The name  [CONTACT_312154]  (PI) must  be provided.  
• If the research  study  will include  other  collaborative  personnel  such as co-investigators,  
technicians  and students,  the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312061].  
• If data is collected  that is considered  either  sensitive,  protected  health  information,  or 
HIPAA  information,  then prior  to using  the system  the user must  complete  all necessary  
Page  65 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 training  including  but not limited  to require  HIPAA  training.  
• Social  Security  Number  training  is required  annually  for all UF personnel  who use SSNs  
in their work  or research.  The “Protecting  Social  Security  Numbers”  training  module  is 
available  only through  myTraining . http://mytraining.hr.ufl.edu . 
• It is the responsibility  of the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312062] -specific  and related  training  and have  reviewed  the required  
safeguards  according  to UF policies  and procedures.  
• Users  of REDCap™  must  adhere  to all UF computer  policies,  regulations,  rules  and 
standards.  It is the responsibility  of the principal  investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312063].  
 
REDCap  Support  and Contingency  Policies  
The Clinical  and Translational  Science  Institute  (CTSI)  at the University  of [LOCATION_012]  provides  the 
use of REDCap™  (Research  Electronic  Data Capture)  software  as a service  for UF investigators  
and their teams  to collect  study  data.  This service  includes  the REDCap  application  software  hosted  
in a web server,  server  space  for data storage,  regular  system  backups,  software  patches  and 
upgrades.  In the event  of a system  shut-down,  a 24 hour recovery  time objective  is achievable.  UF 
Health  IT has a Disaster  Avoidance  and Recovery  Plan that covers  responsibilities,  
communication,  and escalation.  The recovery  point  objective  for the REDCap  database  is 1 hour 
(no more  than 1 hour of data loss).  The recovery  point  objective  for the web server  is 24 hours  (no 
more  than 24 hours  of data loss).  
• PIs will maintain  printed  copi[INVESTIGATOR_312064] a need  to collect  data during  an outage.  In the event  of an expected  
catastrophic  disaster,  such as loss of a data center  due to a hurricane,  the REDCap  Support  Team  
(Administrators)  will notify  all REDCap  users  via e-mail of the potential  threat.  
• PI’s are advised  to move/export  data to a disk and to a storage  area approved  for sensitive  data.  
In the  event  of scheduled  System  maintenance, the  REDCap  Support  Team  (Administrators)  will 
notify  all REDCap  users  via e-mail one week  prior,  one day before  and on the day of the scheduled  
maintenance.  All users  are notified  via e-mail when  the system  is available  again.  Data  is not 
available  for export  from  REDCap  during  a REDCap  outage.  
In this clinical  trial, only anonymized  data will be recorded  based  on the clinical  data collected.  
The anonymized  data of medical  information  includes  the results  of the trials  tests and will be 
communicated  to the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_74279].  
Only  members  of the research  team,  who also form  part of the patient's  direct  clinical  care team,  
at the participating  sites will have  access  to patient  records  as part of their medical  care and will 
use these  records  to screen  for potentially  eligible  patients.  Patients  who consent  to enter  the trial 
are informed  that staff from  the research  team,  the Principal  Investigator  (and its representatives),  
relevant  regulatory  authorities  and ethical  committees  may require  access  to their full medical  
records  for monitoring  and auditing  purposes.  
Database  and results  of statistical  analyses,  narratives  of SAEs  will be transmitted  to Inventiva  SA 
which  will contract  out study  report  writing.  
The clinical  study  report  will be reviewed  and signed  by [CONTACT_45822].  
The study  (validation  of the final report),  the data will be totally  anonymized  and will be stored  on 
a dedicated  and secured  slot at the Principal  Investigator  [CONTACT_3725]. 
Only  authorized  Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312065].  
  
Page  66 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384576].  
The Data Management  will be responsible  for data processing,  in accordance  with REDCap  data 
management  procedures.  Data  will be managed  by [CONTACT_978] ([CONTACT_312161])  and his research  team,  who 
will be responsible  for data processing,  quality  control,  storage,  monitoring,  and analysis.  Data  
will be also shared  with Inventiva  for additional  analysis  and result  publication.  Only  de-identified  
datasets  from  which  all PHI has been  removed  will be shared  with Inventiva.  
The Principal  Investigator,  together  with his designated  medical  staff,  will verify  that all data 
entries  in the eCRF  are accurate  and correct.  If some  assessments  are not done,  or if certain  
information  is not available,  not applicable,  or unknown,  the Investigators  will have  to indicate  
this in the eCRF.  The Investigators  will be required  to electronically  sign off the clinical  data.  
The Monitors  will review  the eCRFs  and evaluate  them  for completeness  and consistency.  The 
eCRF  will be compared  with the source  documents  to ensure  that there  are no discrepancies.  
All entries,  corrections,  and alterations  will be made  by [CONTACT_183439]/her  delegate.  The 
Monitors  will not enter  data in the eCRFs.  
 
7.3.2 Data  Collection  and Validation  
All clinical,  laboratory  and imaging  data will be entered  into the  eCRF  at the investigational  site. 
This will be done  for each patient  (screen  failure  and enrolled),  by [CONTACT_8509],  
and signed  by [CONTACT_737].  A hard copy  of the clinical  data will be kept in locked  cabinets  and 
locked  offices  at our CTSI  (second  floor,  diabetes  research  section),  strictly  following  current  UF 
IRB privacy  guidelines  of confidentiality  at all times.  
A unique  subject  code  will identify  the subjects on the eCRF.  Each  participant  will be assigned  a 
unique  study  identification  number.  A link to the study  identification  number  will be stored  
separately.  Data  will be collected  on case report  forms  or source  documents.  Data quality  control  
will be monitored  regularly  along  with real-time programmed  data checks.  
Once  clinical  data of the eCRF  have  been  entered  into REDCap,  corrections  to the data fields  will 
be audit  trailed,  meaning  that the reason  for change  and the name  [CONTACT_312155],  together  with time and date,  will be logged.  Roles  and rights  of the site personnel  
responsible  for entering  the clinical  data into the eCRF  in REDCap  will be determined  in advance  
and documented  on the “delegation  form”.  
Automatic  checks  and listings  will be designed  and performed  according  to the data validation  
plan,  developed  by [CONTACT_312136].  In case of missing  values,  out of range  values,  data 
inconsistencies  or values  that fail logical  checks,  queries  will be edited  in the EDC  application.  In 
addition,  the Monitors  and Data Manager(s)  can raise  manual  queries  in the EDC  application.  
The appropriate  investigational  staff will answer  automatic  and manual  queries.  This will be audit - 
trailed  by [CONTACT_312137],  meaning  that the name  [CONTACT_312156].  
 
7.3.3 Data  Coding  
AEs and Medical  History  (MH)  will be coded  using  the last version  of MedDRA  terminology.  
Concomitant  medications  will be coded  using  WHO  Drug  2016  Q1 (or a more  recent  version)  
terminology.  
Page  67 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384577]  and reviewed  by a 
Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312066].  
 
7.3.4 Database  Lock  
Once  validated,  the database  will be locked  so that no more  change  will be possible  on the frozen  
data.  
After  database  lock,  the Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_229954]  a CD-ROM  of the patient  data (eCRF  
data + audit  trail)  for archiving  at the investigational  site. 
 
7.3.[ADDRESS_384578] meets  the Inventiva  Biostatistical  team  after mutual  agreement.  
 
7.4 Independent  Audit  
The Principal  Investigator  [INVESTIGATOR_312067]  
S.A.,  after reasonable  notice.  An audit  or a regulatory  inspection  is intended  to determine  if the 
study  was conducted  as per protocol  (PP),  GCP  and applicable  regulatory  requirements,  if the 
rights  and well-being  of the patients  were  protected,  and if the data relevant  for the evaluation  of 
the IMP were  captured,  processed  and reported  in compliance  with the planned  arrangements.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_384579]  access  to all study  documents,  
drug accountability  records,  source  records  and source  data.  If an inspection  is announced,  
Inventiva  S.A. will be informed  without  delay.  
 
 
8 Statistical  Methods  
Studied  population:  
Modified  ITT and safety  population:  All randomized  patients  who took at least one dose 
Evaluable  patients:  Patients  belonging  to the mITT  with at least one pre-randomization  and one 
post-randomization  assessment  of IHTG.  
 
8.1 Efficacy  Assessments  
Primary  outcome  and Primary  efficacy  criterion:  IHTG  quantified  by ¹H-MRS.  
Primary  outcome:  Change  from  baseline  to week  [ADDRESS_384580]:  difference  between  lanifibranor  and 
placebo  in the mean  change  from  baseline  to week  [ADDRESS_384581]  size: an absolute  difference  between  treatments  of 
3% in the mean  change  from  baseline  to week  24 is probably  at the limit  of clinical  pertinence.  
This represents  a mean  decrease  in IHTG  of 20%  in lanifibranor  group  and 0% in placebo  group.  
Considering  a standard  deviation  of [ADDRESS_384582]  size of a little less than 0.43 
which  is in the lower -medium  class  (between  0.4 and 0.5) of treatment  effect.  Therefore,  an 
absolute  reduction  of 3.5%  (relative  reduction  of 23.3%),  leading  to a standardized  effect  size of 
1.5 (medium  effect  size),  is considered  clinically  pertinent.  Indeed,  assuming  the normality  of the 
distribution  of the change  from  baseline,  a mean  absolute  reduction  of 3.5%  in IHTG  for the tested  
drug and 0 for placebo,  a baseline  at 15%,  a standard  deviation  of 7% and a resolution  of NAFLD  
Page  68 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 from  5.5%  and below,  the expected  percentage  of patients  with A IHTG  of 5.5 or less ("resolution"  
of NAFLD)  is 19.5%  with the tested  drug and 8.7%  for the placebo  corresponding  to a 2.[ADDRESS_384583]  in the sample  size calculation  (35%  relative  reduction  in IHTG  
for the tested  drug and 0% for placebo),  then the expected  absolute  effect  size is 5.5%,  the 
standardized  effect  size is 0.79 that is very close  to a large  magnitude  (0.8)  of treatment  effect.  The 
expected  percentages  of "resolution"  of NAFLD  under  the assumption  of normality  of the change  
from  baseline  is 28.4%  versus  8.7%  corresponding  to 3.26 times  more  chance  to get an observed  
resolution  of NAFLD  for lanifibranor  compared  to placebo.  
Secondary  endpoints : The following  changes  from  baseline  to 24 weeks  of treatment  will be 
evaluated  and used as secondary  endpoint:  
• Proportion  of “responders”  defined  as the percentage  of patients  reaching  a decrease  
from  baseline  in IHTG  (quantified  by ¹H-MRS)  of ≥ 30% at 24 weeks.  The definition  
of “responders”  as those  with a ≥ 30% reduction  in liver fat by ¹H-MRS  is empi[INVESTIGATOR_312068]  (except  the Belfort  et al, NEJM  2006  (1) and Cusi et al (2) with 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_051])  comparing  simultaneously  ¹H-MRS  with liver histology,  but this threshold  
is likely  to correlate  with positive  histological  changes  in NASH,  based  on investigator's  
experience.  
• Proportion  of patients  considered  as having  resolution  of NAFLD  (≤5.5%  IHTG  
quantified  by 1H- MRS)  at 24 weeks  (highly  likely  to translate  into histological  benefit  
in NASH).  
• Changes  in hepatic  fibrosis  by [CONTACT_312089]  (one or all may be used):  
a) vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan)  (3); 
b) two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (2D-MRE)  (4); and 
c) T1  MRI  mappi[INVESTIGATOR_312069]-invasive  
measurement  of liver fibrosis  (5). 
• Change  in plasma  biomarkers  of liver fibrosis  (i.e., cytokeratin  CK-18, proC3.  
• Change  in metabolic  outcomes  standard  for such pi[INVESTIGATOR_4250]  (see our work  in ref. 1,2,6 
at week  24 of treatment,  and will include:  
o Determination  of glucose  tolerance/insulin,  hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  
gluconeogenesis,  de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  
o Oral glucose  tolerance  test. 
o Glycemic  control:  HbA1c,  advanced  lipid testing.  
o Biomarkers   of  adipose  tissue  metabolism   (i.e.,  plasma   adiponectin   and 
adipokine  panels  measured  multiplex  platform).  
• DNA  testing  to assess  SNPs  related  to NAFLD  (PNPLA3,  TM6SF2,  others)  (36). 
• Safety  and tolerability  assessments  as standard  for clinical  treatment  trials  (vital  signs,  
electrocardiograms,  hypoglycemia,  laboratory  parameters  such as elevation  in liver or 
pancreatic  enzymes,  other).  
 
8.[ADDRESS_384584] a baseline  IHTG  of 
approximately  15%.  The earlier  power  calculations  based  on results  with pi[INVESTIGATOR_312010]  a 6- 
month  study  (1) and a more  recent  [ADDRESS_384585]  (2) but they were revised  in the protocol  based  
on the recent  results  with lanifibranor  800 mg/day  (same  dose as this study) , a 6-month  RCT  
(NATIVE)  that used liver biopsy  (histology)  as the primary  endpoint  (provided  in detail by 
[CONTACT_312138] [INVESTIGATOR_124].  Cusi).  In NATIVE,  the proportion of  patients  with a reduction in steatosis  
Page  69 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 to lanifibranor  was 73% versus  26% with placebo;  greater  than with pi[INVESTIGATOR_312011] 6-month  
Belfort  et al study  [1]). Based  on these  most  recent  results,  this would  translate  to liver fat imaging  
on 1H-MRS  of a relative  reduction  of fat liver with lanifibranor  to be ≥50% compared  to placebo.  
This represents  a change  of ≥7.0%  with lanifibranor  versus  the control  group.  The expected  
standard  deviation  of the change  from  baseline  is expected  to be 7%. Considering  a type I error  of 
0.05 (2-sided),  a power  of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same  variance  in both treatment  
groups  and a parametric  test of mean  comparison,  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients  
to complete  treatment.  Assuming  that 10 % of randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the 
total number  of patients  to be randomized  is 33-34 patients.  Considering  a type I error  of 0.05 (2-
sided),  a power  of 0.80,  an allocation  ratio of 1:1, the same  variance  in both treatment  groups  and 
a parametric  test of mean  comparison  the required  sample  size per group  is 15 patients.  Assuming  
that 10 % of randomized  patients  will not complete  the trial, the total number  of patients  to be 
randomized  is 34. 
 
8.3 Randomization  
Patients  will be randomized  equally  1:1: to either  dose of lanifibranor  or placebo.  
The randomization  list will be setup  with blocs  of size equal  to 4. 
8.4 Protocol  Deviations  
Protocol  deviators  will be identified  and classified  at the blind  review.  Only  patients  with major  
deviations  will be discussed  in the Clinical  Study  Report  and excluded  from  the per protocol  
analysis.  
 
8.5 Data  sets Analyzed  
- Full analysis  set (FAS)  
The full analysis  set consists  of all randomized  patients  who received  at least one dose of the 
assigned  treatment.  In case of error  in the assignment  of treatment,  the actual  treatment  will be 
used in the FAS instead  of the treatment  assigned  in the randomization  list. This set is the primary  
set of patients  used in the primary  analysis  of the primary  efficacy  endpoint.  It corresponds  more  
or less to efficiency  evaluation  of treatment.  
 
- Randomized  set of patients  
The randomized  set of patients  consists  of all  randomized  patients.  In case of treatment  error,  the 
treatment  assigned  in the randomization  list will prevail  over the actual  received  treatment.  In case 
of no post-randomization  efficacy  assessment  the patient  will be a failure  (see handling  of missing  
data).  This set of patients  will be used in a sensitivity  analysis.  
 
- Set of evaluable  patients  
The set of evaluable  patients  will consist  of the FAS after exclusion  of all patients  who did not 
have  an efficacy  evaluation  (IHTG)  at week  24. Patients  did not necessarily  took their treatment  
up to week  24. In case of error  in the assignment  of treatment,  the actual  treatment  will be used in 
the FAS instead  of the treatment  assigned  in the randomization  list. 
 
- Per protocol  set of completers  
This set is composed  of all patients  who completed  the treatment  and the study  and who were  free 
from  major  protocol  deviation  that can bias the estimation  of the treatment  effect  at week  24. 
Patients  with major  deviations  will be listed  during  the blind  review  and the reason  for exclusion  
will be provided.  In case of treatment  error,  the patient  will be assigned  to the group  corresponding  
to the actual  treatment  received.  This set will be used in efficacy  evaluation  for estimating  and 
testing  the treatment  effect  in the best situation  (squeaky  clean  analysis)  i.e. treatment  completers,  
Page  70 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384586] one dose of treatment  
(IVA  337 or placebo),  regardless  any protocol  deviations.  In case of treatment  error,  the actual  
treatment  will be used.  Safety  analyses  will be conducted  on the safety  population  
 
 
8.6 Demographic  and Other  Baseline  Characteristics  
8.6.1 Patient  Demographic  Characteristics,  Medical  History  and Diagnoses  
Safety  characteristics,  including  demography,  medical  history,  entrance  criteria  deviations  will be 
summarized  using  the descriptive  statistics  (N, mean,  standard  deviation,  median  minimum  and 
maximum  for quantitative  values  and counts  and percentages  for qualitative  variables).  
 
8.6.[ADDRESS_384587] of potentially  clinically  significant  abnormalities  (PCSA)  in clinical  laboratory  
tests,  vital signs,  and ECG  for the final analysis.  The effect  of the demographic  differences  (gender,  
age, etc.) and risk factors  of clinical  relevance  will be explored  in case of any potential  concern.  
 
8.7.1 Extent  of Exposure  
The extent  of exposure  will be summarized  descriptively  (N, mean,  median,  standard  deviation  
and range)  using  treatment  exposure  duration.  Treatment  exposure  duration  (in days)  is defined  as: 
(Date  of last dose of study  product  - First intake  of study  product  date).  In case of treatment  
interruption,  the actual  duration  of treatment  will be used.  The distribution  and cumulative  
distribution  of patients  by [CONTACT_312139].  
 
8.7.2 Adverse  Events  
Each  AE will be associated  to a "preferred  term"  and classified  by "system -organ  class"  according  
to the latest  MedDRA.  The AE parameter  of interest  is the number  and percentage  of patients  
experiencing:  - at least one event  - an event  under  each recorded  preferred  term,  and an event  under  
each recorded  system -organ  class.  These  frequencies  apply  to all AEs,  regardless  of relationship  
of the event  to lanifibranor.  
- Definitions:  
Adverse  events  will be coded  according  to Medical  Dictionary  for Regulatory  Affairs  (MedDRA)  
and coded  as treatment  emergent  (TEAE)  / non-treatment  emergent  (non-TEAE)  according  to the 
following  definitions.  TEAEs  are defined  as events  occurring  on or after the day of first dose intake  
of study  product  and up to follow  up visit.  Additionally,  events  present  before  the first dose of 
study  product,  but worsening  under  treatment  are considered  as TEAEs.  Although  every  effort  will 
Page  71 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 be made  to establish  the onset  date and time, events  with missing  onset date  will be considered  as 
TEAEs. An  AE that will not qualify  as a TEAE  will be considered as a Non-TEAE.  Non-TEAES  
will be summarized  separately  from  TEAES  and will be presented  in the same  manner  as TEAEs.  
- Treatment  Emergent  Adverse  Events  
A given  TEAE  will be counted  once  only per patient.  The percentages  will be calculated  in relation  
to the population  exposed  (i.e., safety  population).  All TEAES  will be analyzed,  irrespective  of 
their causal  relationship with allocated treatment.   Summary tables  will be provided,  showing  the 
following:  
• count  of exposed  patients,  
• count  and percentage  of patients  with at least one TEAE,  
• count  and percentage  of each TEAE:  TEAEs  will be sorted  by [CONTACT_312140],  
• count  and percentage  of each TEAE,  not taking  into account  organ  system.  
In addition, TEAEs  will be described  according  to their time to onset  with same  categories  as for 
duration  of exposure,  their maximal  intensity  and their relationship  to gender  and age of patient,  
time from  first intake,  outcome,  seriousness  criteria,  corrective  treatment,  duration,  treatment  
received,  and action  taken.  Patient  data listings  will be provided  for all AEs,  TEAEs,  AEs leading  
to study  discontinuations  and SAEs.  
Deaths  and Serious  Adverse  Events  Incidence  of SAEs  (irrespective  of their emergence  
classification  and relationship  to lanifibranor)  and deaths  will be listed  and summarized.  
 
- Adverse  Events  leading  to treatment  discontinuation  
Adverse  event  leading  to discontinuation  of the study  will be tabulated,  irrespective  of their 
emergence  classification  and irrespective  of their relationship  to lanifibranor.  
 
8.7.3 Other  Observations  Related  to Safety  
- Laboratory  tests  
The analysis  will focus  on potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  (PCSA)  values  which  will be 
defined  in the Statistic  Analysis  Plan (SAP).  The incidence  of PCSAs  will be summarized  for each 
clinical  laboratory  test. The summaries  will include  patients  exposed  to study  medication  who have  
at least one laboratory  test performed  after the first study  product  intake  and, when  required  by [CONTACT_312141],  with an available  baseline  value  and available  normal  ranges.  For 
these  descriptions,  the baseline  value  will be the latest  available  measure  before  the first study  
product  dose intake.  International  units  will be used in all listings,  tables  and graphs.  Results  and 
changes  from  baseline  of laboratory  parameters  will be summarized  by [CONTACT_8477],  standard  deviation,  
median,  minimum  and maximum  at each time point  and for the final on-treatment  visit.  
Unscheduled  and/or  repeated  results  will only be listed  and not summarized.  
Shift  tables  and other  tabular and graphical  methods will be  used to present the results for tests  of 
interest.  Listings  will be provided  with flags  indicating  clinically  significant  out-of-range  values,  
clinically  non-significant  out-of-range  values  as well as the PCSA  values.  
 
- Vital  signs  and ECG  
Descriptive  statistics  by [CONTACT_312142].  The baseline  value  is defined  as the last measure  before  study  product  
intake.  ECG  parameters  collected  are heart  rate, PR interval,  QRS  interval,  QT, QTcB  (Bazett)  
intervals.  Descriptive  statistics  (means,  standard  deviations,  and ranges)  and changes  from  baseline  
values  for all visits  will be provided.  Patients  with PCSA  for each vital sign or ECG  data parameter  
Page  72 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384588]  deviation,  median,  minimum  and maximum  at each time point  and the final on- 
treatment  visit:  
• Heart  rate: supi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  
• Systolic  blood  pressure:  supi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  
• Diastolic  blood  pressure:  supi[INVESTIGATOR_050],  
• Weight.  
Shift  tables  and other  tabular  and graphical  methods  (plots  of mean  over time)  may be used to 
present  the results  for parameters  of interest.  
Confirmatory  inferential  analysis  may be done  for parameters  of interest.  Listings  will be provided  
with flags  indicating  clinically  significant  out-of-range  values,  clinically  non-significant  out-of- 
range  values  as well as the PCSA  values.  
 
- Physical  examination  
For physical  examination  anomalies  will be listed  and frequencies  tables  will be computed.  
 
8.7.[ADDRESS_384589]  will be the between  treatment  group  difference  in the mean  
change  from  baseline  to week  24 in IHTG  adjusted  for baseline  of IHTG.  
The primary  rule for handling  the IHTG  missing  data at Week  24 is the use of the baseline  at Week  
24 in case the mean  change from  baseline  in placebo  group is equal  to zero or is an  improvement  
or if the reason  for missing  data is definitely  not related  to treatment  or disease  progression.  If the 
relative  change  from  baseline  to week  24 in the placebo  group  is a deterioration  of IHTG  then the 
relative  deterioration  observed  in the placebo  group  will be applied  to all missing  IHTG  at week  
24 that are possibly  related  to treatment  or disease  progression.  
 
Sensitivity  analyses  
The primary  analysis  of the primary  efficacy  assessment  will be performed  after the following  
modification.  
• Use of the randomized  set of patients.  
• Use of the evaluable  set of patients  
• Use of the per protocol  set of patients  
Page  73 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/2018  Version  2.5 January 18, 2022  
 
 • Use of a non-parametric  test (Mann  and Whitney)  especially  in case of outliers  or if the 
distribution  of change  from  baseline  is quite  skewed.  Hodge  Lehmann  estimator  will be 
used to estimate  the magnitude  of treatment  effect.  
• Use of the Q3 (third  quartile)  estimate  of the relative  change  from  baseline  to week  24 of 
the placebo  distribution  (from  the most  improved  to the most  worsened)  for imputing  
missing  IHTG  at week  24. 
 
Secondary  efficacy  analyses  of the primary  efficacy  assessment  
The following  proportions  will be estimated  per treatment  group  with the Clopper  Pearson  95% 
CI and compared  with a Fisher  exact  test in the FAS,  the evaluable  set of patients  and per protocol  
set of patients:  
• Proportion  of “responders”  defined  as the percentage  of patients  reaching  a decrease  
from  baseline  in IHTG  (quantified  by 1H-MRS)  ≥ 30% at  24 weeks.  In case of missing  
outcome  at weeks  24 the patient  is a non-responder.  
• Proportion  of patients  considered  as having  resolution  of NAFLD  (≤ 5.5%  IHTG  
quantified  by 1H- MRS)  at 24 weeks.  
 
Other  secondary  analyses  
• Between  treatment  difference  in the change  from  baseline  to week  24 in hepatic  fibrosis  
will be estimated  and tested  with a general  linear  model  for each technique  used:  
a) Vibration -controlled  transient  elastography  (Fibroscan);  
b) two-dimensional  magnetic  resonance  elastography  (2D-MRE);  and 
c) T1 MRI mappi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  
The general  statistical  approach  will be similar  to the primary  analysis  and subordinated  
analyses.  
 
• Between  treatment  difference  in the change  from  baseline  to week  24 in each plasma  
biomarkers  of liver fibrosis  (cytokeratin  CK-18, proC3)  will be estimated  and tested  
using  the same  approach  as the primary  analysis.  
 
• Between  treatment  difference  in the change  from  baseline  to week  24 in metabolic  
outcomes  will also be estimated  and tested  for: 
o Hepatic  insulin  sensitivity,  gluconeogenesis  and de novo  lipogenesis  (DNL).  
o Oral glucose  tolerance  test. 
o Glycemic  control:  HbA1c,  advanced  lipid testing.  
o Biomarkers   of  adipose  tissue  metabolism   (i.e.,  plasma   adiponectin   and 
adipokine  panels  measured  by [CONTACT_312110]-standard  Millipore  multiplex  platform).  
• The percentage  of patients  achieving  an improvement  in HbA1c  or plasma  lipid targets  
will be analyzed  using  a logistic  regression  model  with treatment  and baseline  HbA1c  
and lipid profile  as covariates,  respectively.  
• The time course  of repeated  measures  of FPG,  HbA1c,  lipid parameters,  and others  will 
be estimated  and tested  using  mixed  models  for repeated  measures  to account  for the 
correlation  amongst  measures  after careful  selection  of the proper  covariance  structure.  
• Hypoglycaemia  rate will be fitted  to a negative  binomial  model  to test the treatment  
effect.  
• The percentage  of patients  having  a hypoglycaemia  reported  or not as AE will be 
Page  74 of 88 Study  Protocol  lanifibranor/[ADDRESS_384590] will be used.  
• DNA  testing  to assess  SNPs  related  to NAFLD  (PNPLA3, TM6SF2,  others).  
• Immunohistochemistry:  change  in the semi -quantitative  score  of ballooning  and stellate  
cell activation  from  baseline  to end of treatment  (week  24) will be compared  using  a 
Wilcoxon  Mann  Whitney  test. 
Planned  exploratory  analyses:  
The SAP will provide  more  details  on the presented  analyses  as well as on other  exploratory  criteria  
such as quality  of life assessment.  
All secondary  efficacy  analyses will be performed  using  a mixed  model  for repeated measures or 
an ANCOVA  model  if only one post-randomization  measure  is available.  CMH  test stratified  on 
diabetes  will be used for qualitative  variables.  
Exploratory  analyses  on the biomarkers  measurements  and other  evaluations  will be proposed  and 
described  in the statistical  analysis  plan.  
The final version  of the Statistical  Analysis  Plan will be issued  before  freezing  of the database  the 
break  of the randomization  code.  Any clarification  brought  in the SAP concerning  handling  of data 
and statistical  analyses  will prevail  over any other  interpretations  of the protocol  unless  it is the 
source  of major  inconsistencies.

Reasons  of withdrawal  include,  but are not limited,  to the following:  
• Patient  decision  
• Lost to follow -up, death  
• Any AE, laboratory  abnormality  or illness  which,  in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_1072],  
indicates  that continued  treatment  with study  therapy  and participation  in the trial is not in 
the best interest  of the subject.  
• Major  protocol  deviation:  e.g. lack of compliance  with scheduled  visits,  non-compliance  
with study  treatment,  treatment  with prohibited  medication  during  the study  (see section  
4.3.3 ) 
• Any deteriorati on in cardiac  status  
• CTCAE  grade  3 or higher  possibly  or probably  related  to study  drug OR CTCAE  grade  4 
or higher  regardless  of attribution  to study  drug 
• Additional  individual  discontinuation  should  be based  on known  toxicities  and side effects  
of the drug and its class,  specifically  for metabolic,  renal,  hematologic,  and hepatic  toxicity.  
If any of the following  criteria  are met, the patient  should  be immediately  discontinued  
from  drug and followed  until resolution  of adverse  events  and laboratory  values  have

1. Total  Bilirubin  ≥ 3.0 md/DL  
2. Total  CPK  > 5X ULN  
3. Lipase  level  increase  above  inclusion  criteria  (i.e., lipase  above  1.3X  ULN  if not on a 
DPP -IV inhibitor,  or >2.0X  ULN  if on a DPP-IV inhibitor)  and re-confirmed  on testing  
within  7 days;  or lipase  > ULN  in any patient  with symptoms  compatible  with 
pancreatitis;  or in asymptomatic  patient  with lipase  above  inclusion  criteria  and when  
retested  (without  drug interruption)  remains  above  inclusion  criteria  within  7 days.

tenderness,  fever,  rash,  and/or  eosinophilia  
(>5%)] http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/.../Guidances/UCM174090.pdf  
• Investigator’s  decision  for any other  reason  
If a patient  discontinues  the study,  the investigator  will make  reasonable  efforts  to obtain  the reason  
and to  perform  all protocol -defined end of study  assessments  as soon  as possible.  The reason  and 
circumstances  for premature  discontinuation  (e.g. consent  withdrawal,  AE, lost to follow  up, etc.),  
and the date of withdrawal  must  be documented  in the eCRF.  If a patient  discontinues  the study  
for safety  reasons,  the outcome  must  be known.  
In the case of withdrawal  due to pregnancy  (see section  6.2.2 ), the patient  will be followed  until 
outcome,  i.e. at least on a quarterly  basis  for follow -up evaluation  of the pregnancy,  fetus,  delivery  
and new born.  In the case of withdrawal  due to an AE the patient  will be followed  until resolution  
of the AE, or until in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_312070],  and the patient  is 
referred  to their primary  physician  for appropriate  management  of the ongoing  event.  Reasonable  
efforts  will be made  to contact  a patient  who fails to attend  any follow -up appointments,  in order  
to ensure  that he/she  is in satisfactory  health.  
Health  data and biological  samples  collected  during  the whole  participation  of the patient  will be 
analyzed  at the end of the study,  and the biological  samples  stored  up to one year after the 
completion  of the study  and destroyed.

2.1 Background and Rationale
Why Is This Study Being Conducted?
OnabotA X is an onabotulinumtoxinA investigational product being developed for the treatment of GL .  
Hyperfunctional facial lines that develop from repeated facial expression, such as GL, are typi[INVESTIGATOR_17164] .1-[ADDRESS_16261] selectively at the neuromuscular or neuroglandular junction to reversibly block presynaptic 
acetylcholine release .  BOTOX (onabotulinumtoxinA ) was first approved for aesthetic treatmen tof 
glabellar lines in [ADDRESS_16262] common nonsurgical procedures in aesthetic medicine .6
A key factor contributing to patient satisfaction with aesthetic treatments is the durability of therap eutic
benefit .7,8  An enhanced duration could increase patient satisfaction and requir efewer clinician visits
and injections to maintain the therap eutic benefit.  With the intent of developi[INVESTIGATOR_007] a formulation of 
onabotulinumtoxinA that would potentially meet th isclinical need, several prototype formulations were 
screened and lead candidate formulations of OnabotA X were identified. 
 
  OnabotA X formulations may offer an improved treatment option to 
patients based on their durability profile .  This is a proof -of-concept study to evaluate the safety and 
exploratory efficacy of 3 different formulations of OnabotA X (A, B, and C;  
).
2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects
OnabotulinumtoxinA is the active drug substance in BOTOX/BOTOX Cosmetic and in OnabotA X; 
therefore, safety data from prior studies of BOTOX are relevant to the benefit/risk assessment for this 
first-in-human study of OnabotA X.  
The clinical efficacy and safety profile of BOTOX has also been demonstrated in multiple Allergan -and 
non-Allergan -sponsored clinical trials across several indications, with favorable benefit/risk profiles.  In 
general, adverse reactions occur within the first few days following injection of BOTOX, and while 
generally transient, may have a duration of several months or, in rare cases, longer.  
In a meta -analysis conducted by [CONTACT_17177], the most frequently reported AEs among subjects treated for 
GL with BOTOX  were he adache, nasopharyngitis, eyelid sensory disorder, eyelid ptosis, 
injection site pain, and nausea.9  All of these events were mild or moderate in severity, and the 
incidence decreased with increasing number of treatment cycles.  The safety pro file for the  dose of 
OnabotA X selected for evaluation in this study is expected to fall within that of BOTOX for the 
treatment of GL.

4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a 180-day, Phase 2a, open -label, proof -of-concept study to assess the safety and effi cacy of a 
single  dose of 3 different formulations of OnabotA X (A, B, and C;  
). The study will enroll approximately [ADDRESS_16265] s 
(≥18 years old) with severe GLbased on FWS -GL ratings .  Approximately [ADDRESS_16266] s will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive one  dose of Formulation A, B, or C of OnabotA X .  
The single treatment of study drug will be administered in an open -label manner as  
to the corrugator and procerus muscles.  Following treatment administration for each 
subject, the inve stigator will complete the Injector Experience Survey. 
Each subject will be in the study for up to [ADDRESS_16267] 9 visits after screening.  F ollow -up visits will 
be on Days 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 (exit) .  The visit at Day 3 will be permitt ed a window of 
± 1day, the visits at Days 7 and 14 will be permitted a window of ±3 days, and the visits at Days 30, 60, 
90, 120, and 180 (exit) will be permitted a window of ±[ADDRESS_16268] results, neurolog ic assessment ,abbreviated physical examination, ECG, and vital signs 
will be monitored (see Operations Manual [Appendix F] Section 3 ).  At Screening, Baseline (Day 1) prior 
to treatment , and study exit, females of childbearing potential will undergo pregnancy testing .  For all 
subjects, AEs will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by [CONTACT_423].  Blood 
samples for immunogenicity testing will be collected at Days 1, 30, 90, and 180 (exit).  
Additional efficacy will be evaluated based on FWS- GL-Investigator (assessed by [CONTACT_17180]), the FWS -GL-Subject, and the AGLSS.  
Subjects who discontinue should complete the procedures outlined for the Premature Discontinuation 
visit as soon as possible, preferably within 2 weeks (see Appendix DStudy Activities Table).  
Further details regarding study procedures are in the Operations Manual ( Appendix F) Section 3.

STUDY M21 -324  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_16285] and/or device must be reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of the stud y site 's knowledge of the event.  Product complaints occurring during the 
study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion.
Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events :  OnabotA X
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence i n a subject or clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the 
product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from 
"special situations "such as accidental or intentional overdose, medication error, occupational or 
accidental exposure, off- label use, drug abuse, drug misuse, or drug withdrawal, all which must be 
reported whether a ssociated with an AEor not .  Any worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is 
considered an AE.  Worsening in severity of a reported AEshould be reported as a new AE.  Laboratory 
abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation 
from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical drug , and/or if the investigator considers them to be 
AEs.
The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis 
throu ghout the study.  All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the 
surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre- existing condition and/or the surger y/procedure has 
been pre -planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly 
during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition 
for which the elective surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an AE.
If an AE, whether associated with study drug or not, meets any of the following criteria, it is to be 
reported to [COMPANY_013] clinical pharmacovigilance or contract research organization (as appropriate) as a 
SAE within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the SAE (refer to Section 4.2 of the Operations 
Manual [Appendix F]for reporting details and contact [CONTACT_3031]):

an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in 
fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with 
the activities of daily living of a study subject.  Disability is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 
and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical Event 
Requiring Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life -
threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_313] ,based on 
medical judgment ,may jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above (i.e., death of subject , life threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
prolongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], congenital anomaly, or persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity) .  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important 
medical event along with any suspected transmission of an 
infectious agent via a medicinal product if no other serious criterion 
is applicable .  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency r oom 
or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or 
drug abuse.
All AEs reported from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_16287] signs the study -specific informed

STUDY M21 -324  |  Version 3.[ADDRESS_16288] (IMP)related to any dose administered that result in an SAE as defined 
above.
S[LOCATION_003]R Refers to individual SAE case reports from clinical trials where a causal 
relationship between the SAE and the IMP was suspected by [CONTACT_17189], is unexpected (not listed in the applicable Reference Safety 
Information), and meets one of the above serious criteria.
[COMPANY_013] will be responsible for S[LOCATION_003]R reporting for the IM Pin accordance with global and local
requirements.
AEs will be monitored throughout the study to identify any of special interest that may indicate a trend 
or risk to subjects.
Possible Distant Spread of Toxin 
Possible distant spread of toxin (PDSOT) is defined as a possible pharmacologic e ffect of botulinum toxin 
at sites noncontiguous and distant from the site of injection.  To assess possible local and distant spread 
of toxin, Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA )preferred terms (PTs) that may be 
associated with botulinum toxin effects have been identified, and the final terms will be listed in the 
statistical analysis plan.  All AEs will be medically reviewed by [CONTACT_17190] a regular basis throughout 
the duration of the study to identify PDSOT events, which will be ass essed for severity, frequency, and 
trending and will be summarized in study clinical study report .
Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Study Drug
The investigators will rate the severity of each AEas mild, moderate, or severe.
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each AE:
Mild The AEis transient and easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] .
Moderate The AEcauses the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject 's usual 
activities.
Severe The AEcauses considerable interference with the subject 's usual activities 
and may be incapacitating or life threatening.

Summary and Analysis of the Prima ry Endpoint
Not applicable.
Summary and Analysis of Secondary Endpoints
Not applicable.
Summary and Analysis of Additional Efficacy Endpoints
The number and percentage (or proportion) of the subject s who are responders will be summarized, 
95% confidence interval will be calculated with an exact method based on the binomial distribution for 
percentage (or proportion) of the subject s.  Observed data without imputation will be used.
For efficacy endpoin ts using AGLSS , subsets of subject s will be used as follows:
1-grade improvement from baseline at maximum frown or at rest : only subject s with 
corresponding baseline score being at least mild are included
2-grade improvement from baseline at maximum frown: only subject s with corresponding 
baseline score being at least moderate are included
Achieving none or mild at maximum frown : only subject s with corresponding baseline score 
being at least moderate are included
7.5 Statistical Analyses for Safety
The safety analyses will be performed using the safety population.  The safety parameters will include 
incidence of AEs and change from baseline in vital signs ,laboratory assessments , and ECG.  Safety 
endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics and/or shift tables, as applicable. For each 
safety endpoint evaluating change from baseline, the last nonmissing safety assessment before study 
intervention administration will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that endpoint.
Treatment -emergent AEs ar e defined as any AE with the onset that is after the first dose of study drug.  
Events where the onset date is the same as the study drug start date are assumed to be treatment -
emergent. 
An overview of AEs will be presented consisting of the number and pe rcentage of subjects experiencing 
at least one event for each of the following AE categories:

Premature Discontinuation ) visits .  Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shippi[INVESTIGATOR_17171].  Collected samples will be processed to yield 
serum for analysis .  
A 2-tier assay approach will be used for the detection of binding and neutralizing antibodies to 
OnabotulinumtoxinA in human serum .  In Tier 1, serum samples will be screened using a validated 
enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  The positive samples will subsequently be 
immunodepleted to confirm that the antibodies were specifically binding to OnabotulinumtoxinA and 
then titered to assess the magnitude of antibodies present .  In Tier 2, only samples that are confirmed
positive in the ELISA will be tested for neutralizing antibodies to OnabotulinumtoxinA using a validated 
assay.
Samples collected will also be used for investigative purpose in characterizing the assay.
There are no pandemic or natural disaster -related protocol modifications for immunogenicity samples .  
If a site visit is missed at which immunogenicity samples were planned to be collected, this assessment 
will be skipped for that timepoint.
Hypersensitivity Assessments 
In su spected cases of anaphylaxis or systemic hypersensitivity reactions (see Appendix 7.2), blood 
samples for testing of biomarkers ( i.e., tryptase) should be collected within [ADDRESS_16316] s who experience anaphylaxis (regardless of seriousness) or serious systemic hypersensitivity will 
be managed per standard of care and referred to an allergist/immunologist for further assessment.  
Subject s who experience systemic hypersensitivity reactions will be followed until stabilization or 
resolution of the event .  
3.6 Vital Signs
Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], and body 
temperature will be obtained at visits as specified in Section 2; height and weight will also be collected, 
at the baseline visit .  Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after the subject has been 
sitting for at leas t 5minutes .  
Measurements should be assessed consistently throughout the study .  Vital signs measurements 
determined prior to dosing on Day [ADDRESS_16317] 's medical history .  Any significant physical examination findings af ter the first 
dose will be recorded as AEs.  All findings, whether related to an AE or part of each subject 's medical 
history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page.
At any time, a symptom -directed physical examination can be performed as deemed ne cessary by [CONTACT_1275].
There are no pandemic or natural disaster- related protocol modifications for physical examinations .  If a 
site visit is missed at which a physical examination was planned, this assessment will be skipped for that 
timepoint.

3.10 12-Lead Electrocardiogram
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
All subjects will undergo conventional 12 -lead ECG using standardized equipment and electrode 
placement at the visits outlined in the study a ctivities table ( Protocol Appendix D). Subjects are to be in 
a semirecumbent posit ion for at least 10 minutes prior to starting the tracing. Single , legible/readable
ECG trac ings will be taken at all timepoints .When an ECG is scheduled at the same time as a blood 
collection, the ECG will be obtained prior to the blood collection.  
Aqualified third -party vendor will read the ECGs and report the findings as normal, abnormal, or unable 
to evaluate.
For screening ECGs, prespecified significant abnormal findings will be flagged as exclusion alerts, and a 
third -party vendor will generate an exclusion alert for the site and the sponsor. For all subsequent ECGs, 
a qualified third- party vendor will also report the appearance of any new, prespecified significant 
abnormal findings and generate a protocol alert for the site and the sponsor.
The cardiologists will be blinded to participant study intervention assignments. If the ECG finding is 
abnormal, they will specify the abnormality or give a diagnosis, whenever it is possible. ECG reports will 
be provided to the investigator and the sponsor via a secure portal within [ADDRESS_16322] copi[INVESTIGATOR_17172]' s 
site.
The ECG will be assessed for the following measures: heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, QTcB 
interval, QTcF interval, ST segment, RR interval, PR interval, and qualitative results.

Investigators' and subject s'assessments of the severity of GL at rest and maximum contraction using the 
FWS -GLarebased on the following scale:
0 = None
1 = Mild
2 = Moderate
3 = Severe
The FWS -GL scales will be provided by [CONTACT_17207] .  Both versions of the scale provide 
photographic examples of GL severity at rest and at maximum contraction .  Prior to enrolling subject s, 
physician investigators will be trained in grading GL severity using the FWS -GL to ensure that severity is 
graded consistently at each site and across all sites .  For this training, the same set of images will be 
used for all raters and all sites .  
The FWS -GLmust be evaluated by a qualified, trained , physician sub-investigator other than the 
principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17173]
(described in Section 2as an "independent evaluating investigator ").The FWS -GLis the only assessment 
in the study that this sub-investigator will complete.   The FWS -GL assessment is to be performed by [CONTACT_17208]-investigator throughout the study whenever possible .  If it is not possible to use the same 
assessor to follow the subject , it is recommended that the FWS -GL assessments overlap (assess the 
subject together and discuss findings) for at least [ADDRESS_16324] mirrors (non -magnifying m irrors) will be used by [CONTACT_17209] -assessments .
Investigators and subject s will assess GL severity using the FWS -GL at the same time .  However, 
assessments must be independent of each other , and the results of the assessments must not be 
discussed .  The investigator and subject must grade the severity of GL first at rest and then at maximum 
contraction , using the FWS -GL.
There are no pandemic or natural disaster- related protocol modifications for the FWS -GLscale .  If a site 
visit is missed at which this assessment was planned, the assessment will be skipped for that timepoint.
3.12 Allergan Glabellar Line Severity Scale (AGLSS)
Similar to the FWS- GL, the AGLSS assessments are to be conducted at rest and maximum contract ion. 
The scale provides photographic examples of GL severity at rest and at maximum contraction; it uses a 
different set of photographs than the FWS- GL scales.

processing digital photographs .  All digital images will be transferred to the sponsor at the end of the 
study .  
Photographs may be used for education, comme rcial, and/or marketing purposes .  To participate in this 
study, the subject must consent to having photographs taken for research but may still participate if 
he/she declines use of the photographs forother purposes .  The sponsor shall have full ownershi p rights

Study drug will be dispensed to site personnel at Baseline (Day 1), as specified in Section 2.1, and will be 
administered after all other baseline (Day 1) procedures are completed .  
Only the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_17174] a trained and medically qualified physician is authorized to administer 
the study drug.  Study -specific training for GL injections is provided to inv estigators via a video with 
injection demonstration, and review of injection techniques as outlined in the protocol.  The video is 
available on the training portal for injectors to access at any time as a refresher course.  
The study intervention will be administered a sintramuscular (IM) injections at 5 different injection sites 
in the glabellar complex ( Figure 1).
Glabellar Line (GL) Injection Technique
Prior to injec tion, the skin at the injection sites and surrounding areas will be cleansed with 
antimicrobial solution.  Injections will be given using a sterile needle.  Each injection will contain 0.[ADDRESS_16326] injection will be made 
to the midline at the base of the procerus muscle.  The next 4 injections will be made bilaterally (i .e., 2 
injections per side) into each corrugator muscle ( Figure 1).  The corrugators will be injected 
inferomedially near the origin of the supratrochlear nerve and superolaterally to the superior middle 
aspect ≥ 1 cm above the bony orbital rim.

The Natio nal Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network 
(NIAID/FAAN) diagnostic criteria serve as a rapid and simplified method to make an accurate clinical 
diagnosis of anaphylaxis .2  Investigators should utilize these criteria to recognize any early signs and 
symptoms of anaphylaxis and practice clinical judgement for acute treatment and referral to emergency 
care.  The NIAID/FAAN diagnostic criteria for anaphylaxis are outlined below .  
Table 1. National Institute of Allerg y and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy and 
Anaphylaxis Network Criteria for Anaphylaxis
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network 
Criteria forAnaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is likely when any one of these 3 criteria is fulfilled:
Acute onset of illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both 
(e.g., generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips, tongue, or uvula) and at least one of the following:
a. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] ( e.g., dyspnea, wheeze or bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_17175], hypoxemia)
b. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end -organ dysfunction ( e.g., hypotonia [collapse], 
syncope, incontinence)
Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that patient (minutes to 
several hours):
a. Involvement of the skin or mucosal tissue ( e.g., generalized hives, itch or flush, swollen lips, tongue, or 
uvula)
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] ( e.g., dyspnea, wh eeze or bronchospasm, stridor, reduced peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_17175], hypoxemia)
c. Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms ( e.g., hypotonia [collapse], syncope, incontinence)
d. Persistent gastrointestinal tract symptoms ( e.g., crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)
Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours):
a. Infants and children: low systolic blood pressure (age -specific) or > 30% decrease in systolic blood 
pressurea
b. Adults: systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg o r > 30% decrease from that person 's baseline
a. Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as < 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, < (70 mm Hg + [2 x age]) 
from 1to 10 years, and < 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.

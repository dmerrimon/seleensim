resolution of diarrhea in the 24- hour period immediately before  EOT that 
is maintained for [ADDRESS_606011] EOT  without a requirement for additional 
CDI treatment. Diarrhea is defined as ≥ 3 unformed bowel movements 
(UBMs) in a 24 -hour period; <  3 UBMs is considered as resolution of 
diarrhea. A UBM is defined as a Type 5, 6, or 7 bowel movement on the 
Bristol Stool Chart.  
• Safety endpoints for  all subjects: These include the nature, frequency, and 
severity of adverse events (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs); 
changes from baseline in findings on physical examination, vital sign 
measurements, safety laboratory tests (hematology, biochemi stry, 
urinalysis); and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings.  
Secondary E ndpoint:  
• SCC: this is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (ie, at least [ADDRESS_606012] EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 28 ± [ADDRESS_606013] 
EOT. Recurrence is defined as a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337] (≥ 3 UBMs in a 
24-hour period) with a positive toxin result, using a Sponsor -approved 
C. difficile  free toxin test and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], requir ing 
retreatment with an antibacterial agent for C.  difficile . 
Pharmacokinetic E ndpoint:  
• Systemic exposure of ibezapolstat will be determined by [CONTACT_472775]; fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat  will be measured at 
specified study visits.  
Exploratory E ndpoints:  
• Microbial endpoints: Quantitative changes in relevant fecal bacterial communities and microbial diversity will be assessed for ibezapolstat -treated subjects in both segments, and in comparison to those 
treated with vancomycin  in Segment 2B. Changes will be assessed during 
the treatment period and post EOT . 
• Time to resolution of diarrhea, defined as the time from outset of 
treatment to the first formed bowel movement not followed within the 
next 24 hours by a UBM, will be recor ded. 
• Time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_2345] (for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472742]) is defined as time from outset of treatment to day of discharge, and not followed by [CONTACT_472776].

result, using a Sponsor -approved C. difficile  free toxin test and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_18959], requiring retreatment with an antibacterial agent for 
C. difficile . 
Safety : Safety assessments include vital signs, physical examination, ECG recording s, 
collection of AEs, and clinical laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and 
urinalysis).  
Pharmacokinetics : During Segment 2A and Segment 2B , stool  sampl es will be collected to 
analyze ibezapolstat  levels at designated time points.  In Segment 2A  and 
approximately  50% of subjects in Segment 2B , blood samples will be collected 
to analyze ibezapolstat levels at designated time points.  
Statistical Methods and 
Planned Analyses:  Study Populations  
The Enrolled population includes all subjects who sign an informed consen t 
form . 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population includes all subjects who are enrolled and 
treated in Segment 2A or who are randomized in Segment 2B and will be used to analyze efficacy. In Segment 2B, subjects will be analyzed based on their 
randomized assignment.  This population will be used for the primary analyses 
of efficacy.  
The Per Protocol (PP) population will consist of subjec ts in the ITT population 
with no major protocol deviations. The determination of which subjec ts have 
major protocol violations will be made in a blinded manner prior to database 
lock. For analyses based on the PP population, subjec ts will be grouped 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -[ADDRESS_606033] 1 dose of active study treatment ( ibezapolstat) and have at least [ADDRESS_606034] dose without any important protocol 
deviations /violations  or events tha t would affect the PK. 
Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint is clinical cure at the TOC visit  defined as 
survival and the resolution of diarrhea in the 24- hour period immediately 
before the EOT and maintained for 48 hours after EOT without a requirement 
for additional CDI treatment. For Segment 2A, this endpoint will be 
summarized using frequencies and percentages, together with a 95% exact (Clopper -Pearson) confidence interval for the true cure percentage. For 
Segment 2B, the null and alterna tive hy potheses for this endpoint are:  
H
0: π 1,T ≤ π 1,C - δ and  H1: π 1,T > π 1,C - δ, 
where π 1,T and π 1,C are the true proportions of subjects with clinical cure at the 
TOC visit for the ibezapolstat  [ADDRESS_606035] (Clopper- Pearson) 95% confidence interval 
for the true cure percentage.  A 95% confidence interval based on the normal 
approximation will also be calculated for the difference between th e 
[ADDRESS_606036] of non- inferiority at the 0.[ZIP_CODE] significance level 
(Pocock 1977 ) for an overall significance level of 0.05. In the event 
non-inferiority of ibezapolstat 450 mg is demonstrated, Fisher’s exact test 
(two-sided) will be used to conduct a test for superiority at the 0.[ADDRESS_606037] 36 Segment 2B 
subje
cts in the ITT Population (one half of the planned sample size) have data 
for the primary efficacy endpoint. The null hypothesis (see Section 14.3.1) will 
be tested using a one -sided normal approximation test of non- inferiority at a 
one-sided α=0.[ZIP_CODE] level of significance (Pocock 1977) for an overall 
significance level of 0.05. If the p- value is less than or equal to 0.[ADDRESS_606038] (Clopper -Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true SCC percentage. For 
Segment 2B, this endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_472781], together with an exact (Clopper -Pearson) 95% 
confidence interval for the true SCC percentage. A 95% confidence interval 
based on the normal approximation will also be calculated for the difference 
between the 2 population proportions. The null hypothesis that the true

Page  11 of 72 proportions are equal for the 2 treatments will be tested using a two -sided 
Fisher’s exact test  at the 0.05 significance level . 
Safety  
Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be coded using the most recent version 
of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and 
summarized. If a subject  experiences more than [ADDRESS_606039] one TEAE 
leading to study discontinuation will be presented by [CONTACT_1570]. A Es that 
are definitely, probably, or possibly related, or for which the relationship is 
missing, will be considered related.  
The number and percentage of subjects having a TEAE in each System Organ Class (SOC) and having each individual  type of AE (Preferred Term) will be 
presented. TEAEs will also be summarized at the event level by [CONTACT_2946]/Preferred Term and severity. This will be done for all TEAEs, all serious TEAEs, and all TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study.  
All AEs will be listed by [CONTACT_1130] , along with information regarding onset, 
duration, relationship and severity to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and outcome. 
Clinical laboratory data and vital signs data will be summarized by [CONTACT_472782], for both the actual values and 
the change s from baseline, as well as the numbers and percentages of subjects  
with values outside the limits of the normal range at each time point. Electrocardiogram data will be summarized by [CONTACT_472783]. 
Concomitant medications initiated during  the study period will be summarized 
by [CONTACT_438435].  
Exploratory Analyses  
Quantitative changes in relevant fecal bacterial communities and microbial 
diversity will be determined at designated time points during the stu dy. 
Quantitative changes in relevant fecal bacterial communities and microbial 
diversity will be assessed for ibezapolstat -treated subjects in both segments, 
and in comparison to those treated with vancomycin in Segment 2B. Changes will be assessed during the treatment period and post EOT.  
For Segment 2A, time to resolution of diarrhea will be summarized using the 
Kaplan -Meier method, with estimates of the true resolution of diarrhea rate at 
Days  1, 5, 10, 12, and 40. The estimated median time to resolution of diarrhea, 
together with a 95% confidence interval, will also be presented. For Segment 
2B, the analysis will be the same as for Segment 2A, except that the results will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
For Segment 2A, time to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472747]. For Segment 2B, the analysis will be the same as for Segment A, except that the results will be presented by [CONTACT_1570].  
Medical resource utilization data will be summarized by [CONTACT_472784].  
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -[ADDRESS_606040] (Clopper -Pearson) 95% confidence 
interval for the true percentage. A 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation will also be calculated for the difference between the 2 
population proportions . 
These analyses will be performed for Segment 2B only.  
Further details of the statistical analyses of the EQ -5D-5L and medical 
resource utilization  will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Systemic exposure of ibezapolstat  will be determined by [CONTACT_472785]. Fecal concentrations of ibezapolstat  will be measured at 
specified study visits. Plasma and fecal ibezapolstat concentrations will be 
listed by [CONTACT_472786], treatment, study day and/or nominal time, and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
Summary statistics will be generated for ibezapolstat  plasma and fecal 
concentrations. Given sufficient plasma and fecal levels over the lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ), the data will be analyzed as follows: Median (and range) 
and mean (and standard deviation) ibezapolstat  plasma concentrations at each 
nominal time p oint will be calculated. Concentrations reported as below the 
LLOQ will be set to zero for descriptive statistics.

Page  19 of 72 5 INTRODUCTION 
5.1 Background on Clostridioides Difficile  
Clostridioides  d ifficile  (C. difficile ) is an anaerobic, spore- forming, Gram -positive bacterium. 
It is the causative agent of C. difficile  infection (CDI), an increasingly common, potentially 
life-threatening disease. C. difficile  can live harmlessly in the  colon, but in the presence of an 
antibiotic administered for another condition, overgrowth may occur, replacing normal 
bacterial flora and resulting in CDI and or C. difficile -associated disease ( Nelson, 2017 ). 
The epi[INVESTIGATOR_14849] C. difficile  has changed with  the emergence of the North American 
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type 1 strain, and use of more sensitive assays ( Lessa, 2015). 
CDI infection  affects approximately 500,000 patients in the [LOCATION_002] (US) each year, 
and is associated with 15,000 to 30,000 deaths ( McDonald, 2018). In fact, 65,[ADDRESS_606048]-discharge cases, and 263,000 nursing home-onset cases, result in $4 billion in excess costs to the healthcare system 
annually ( Clostridium Infections – Pi[INVESTIGATOR_472748], 2012 ). Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472749] 2000 through 2010 and are projected to 
continue to increase in 2011 and 2012 ( Lessa, 2015).  
Although the discontinuation of predisposing antibiotic therapy and treatment with 
metronidazole, oral vancomycin, or the recently approved drug fidaxomicin (Dificid
®), are 
effective in management of CDI, the development of new alternative therapeutic measures 
will be of great benefit. Not only is the incidence of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472750] C. difficile  rising ( Lessa, 2015;  Louie, 2012 ; Zilberberg, 2008 ), but some strains may 
become hypervirulent and increasingly resistant to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones (Razavi, 2007).  
Current treatment strategy includes discontinuation of predisposing antibiotic and oral administration of vancomycin or fidaxomicin. If access to vancomycin or fidaxomicin is limited, metronidazole may be used for an initial epi[INVESTIGATOR_472751] ( McDonald, 
2018).  
While vancomycin continues to show good clinical efficacy for C. difficile , there is an 
increasing incidence of serious illness because of  vancomycin- resistant enterococci in the 
United S tates, and use of oral vancomycin (as well as oral metronidazole) has been shown to 
promote overgrowth of this pathogen ( Al-Nassir, 2008). Use of vancomycin to treat C. 
difficile  is also associated with unacceptably high recurrence rates. Fidaxomicin (Dificid), 
although newly approved for treatment of CDI, is a treatment option if the risk of recurrence is high, but not for complicated CDI ( Smits, 2016 ). 
Several additional products are under development, and inc lude small molecules, natural 
products, vaccines, and fecal transplants ( Clostridium Infections – Pi[INVESTIGATOR_472748], 2012; 
McDonald, 2018).

Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  20 of 72 Ibezapolstat (ACX-362E ) has activity in vitro and in vivo against C. difficile (Xu, 2011; 
Dvoskin, 2012). The crisis in antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive bacteria prompted the 
development of novel antibacterials through structure–activity relationship studies of 
replication -specific DNA polymerase IIIC. It is from among these compounds that 
antibacterial compounds against C.  difficile  with potent in vitro activity have been 
discovered. Among these is ibezapolstat , which also shows potent in vivo activity in the 
established Syrian golden hamster model of CDI ( Kokkot ou, 2008; Dvoskin, 2012).  
Ibezapolstat  is an inhibitor of the C. difficile  DNA polymerase IIIC and is highly selective for 
C. difficile  compared with other Gram-positive anaerobes and aerobic bact eria. Ibezapolstat , 
2-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-7- (2-[morpholinyl]ethyl)guanine, is a small molecule, poorly 
bioavailable and active orally in the hamster model. In vitro, ibezapolstat  inhibited numerous 
C. difficile  strains, with a  minimum inhibitory concentra tion required to inhibit the growth of 
90% of organisms value of 4 µg/mL, and without inhibiting Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus 
spp., important "good" intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or Gram- negative bacteria. These results 
suggest that development of ibezapolstat  as an oral treatment for CDI in human patients will 
result in a novel, first- in-class drug to treat this emerging infectious disease. 
Subjects in this study will be administered [ADDRESS_606049] the normal good flora of the colon, an important advantage to 
prevent recurrence.  
5.2 Background on Ibezapolstat 
5.2.1 Nonclinical Studies  
In 14
-day multiple oral dose studies, doses of ibezapolstat  were given orally at doses ranging 
from 60 to 600 mg/kg in dogs, and 100 to 2000 mg/kg/day in rats. Bioavailability appeared to be approximately 10% after comparing intravenous and oral dosing in both rats 
(approximately 8%) and dogs (approximately 11%). The apparent plasma clearance after 
single dosing appeared to be approximately 90 to 140 L/h in rats and 60 to 90 L/h in dogs after administration of oral doses ranging from 60 to 1000 mg/kg/day. No toxicity was seen in these studies so the no observed adverse effect level was > 600 mg/kg/day in dogs and 
> 2000 mg/kg/day in rats (data on file). 
Ibezapolstat  was excreted in urine and feces after oral administration in rats. Approximately 
9% and 0.4% of the dose was excreted in feces and urine, respectively; considering the oral 
bioavailability is approximately 10%, and that ibezapolstat  is metabolized to 11 different 
metabolites. F ecal concentrations after a 50  mg/kg oral dose in rats were 107 to 191 µg/g at 
[ADDRESS_606050] dose (data on file).

Page  21 of 72 5.2.2 Clinical Studies  
A Phase 1 study of ibezapolstat in healthy subjects (ACX -362E-101) ha s been completed . 
Study ACX-362E-[ADDRESS_606051] study  in which ibezapolstat  was 
administered in doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, 450 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg. The primary 
objective of the study was to determine the safety of ibezapolstat  in both single and multiple 
doses to healthy subjects. Secondary objectives of the study were to determine system ic and 
fecal pharmacokinetics ( PK) of ibezapolstat  after single and multiple  doses and to compare 
fecal microbiome effects of ibezapolstat  compared to those of vancomycin after multiple 
doses. The plasma and stool levels of ibezapolstat  were also determined after a fed and fasted 
state. Part 1 (n = 6 ibezapolstat ; n = 2 placebo) wa s a single-ascending dose, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled escalation study. Part 2 (n = 8 ibezapolstat ) was a separate, 
single dose cohort at the dose determined in Part [ADDRESS_606052], 2 -period cross-over study in which subjects w ere assigned a single dose of 
ibezapolstat  in either a high- fat, high- calorie , fed state followed by a fasted state, or in a 
fasted state followed by a high- fat, high- calorie fed state.  Part 3 (n = 6 ibezapolstat ; n = 2 
placebo) was a multiple -dose, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation 
study in which tolerability, plasma PK, fecal concentrations, and fecal microbiome effects of ibezapolstat  were  evaluated. In addition, a positive-control subgroup was randomly assigned 
to dosing with vancomycin and tolerability, fecal concentrations, and fecal microbiome effect 
were evaluated for these subjects.  
Preliminary r esults from Study ACX-362E-101 showed a favorable safety profile. Adverse 
events (AEs) were well tolerated, simi lar to placebo, and transitory. AEs in subjects who 
received ibezapolstat  included cough, cystitis-noninfective, dizziness, nasal congestion, 
twitching sensation, and headache that were considered by [CONTACT_472787][INVESTIGATOR_50684], headache (3 events), dyspepsia,  nausea, prolonged PR 
interval, shortness of breath, and tachycardia that were considered by [CONTACT_472788] . All the events were mild in intensity except for 1 
of moderate intensity  (headache) . No AE req uired a change in therapy or intervention. 
Ibezapolstat  was shown to have ideal PK  for a C. difficile  antibiotic. Systemic concentrations 
of ibezapolstat  after administration showed low systemic absorption. Fecal levels were 
several orders of magnitude higher than the microbial inhibitory concentration of C. difficile  
(4000 to 6000 µg/g stool). Study results demonstrated that after ibezapolstat  administration, 
there is a favorable microbiome profile remaining in the gut with less disruption to normal microbiota compared to vancomycin, which was largely driven by [CONTACT_472789], which constitute > 80% of normal microbiota . These 
results support continuing the development of ibezapolstat  for the treatment of CDI.  
The food effect on ibezapolstat  following a 300 mg single dose of ibezapolstat  show ed a 
peak plasma concentration of ibezapolstat  of approximately 3 times greater in a fasting state

Page  22 of 72 versus a fed state, although the ibezapolstat  plasma concentration returned to zero sooner in 
the fasting state . 
Comparison of multiple doses of 300 mg and 450 mg dosing of ibezapolstat  showed plasma 
concentrations peaking at approximately 2 times greater with the 450 mg dose compared to 
the 300 mg dose. Multiple dosing showed higher peaks of ibezapolstat  in stool samples in 
subjects who received 450 mg ibezapolstat  compared to 300 mg ibezapolstat . 
5.3 Clinical Risks/Benefits of Ibezapolstat 
Based on the available nonclinical and clinical data to date, the conduct of the study, as 
spec
ified in this protocol, is considered justifiable. The nonclinical data suggest an acceptable 
safety margin for the selected dose of ibezapolstat . 
All subjects will receive an active treatment for their CDI in the study. Subjects who fail to 
respond to study treatment will be offered treatment for CDI according to the standard of 
care antibiotic at the Investigator’s discretion. 
This study will be performed in compliance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. Aspects of the st udy 
concerned with the study drug will meet the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice. 
Subjects will be closely monitored for safety during the study. The study progresses in 
stages, only going to the next stage after the Trial Oversight Committee  (Section 14.7) has 
fully assessed the safety and tolerability of the prior stage and recommends continuing the 
study. 
The Sponsor will immediately notif y the Principal Investigator (PI) if any additional safety or 
toxicology information becomes available during the study. The collection of blood samples may be accompanied by [CONTACT_472790], but it is usually 
painless.  
As this is the first administration of  ibezapolstat  to subjects with CDI, all effects cannot be 
reliably predicted. Facilities and staff for resuscitation and the treatment of other medical emergencies will be provided.  
5.[ADDRESS_606053] been identified. Based on the finding 
that these molecules, inhibitors of DNA polymerase IIIC (pol  IIIC), are potent inhibitors of 
the growth of the anaerobic bacterium C. difficile , the gene for pol IIIC from this organism 
was cloned and expressed for testing. This showed that inhibition of this enzyme by [CONTACT_30523]-C. difficile  compounds is, as expected, the likely basis for their antibacterial effect. One

Page  23 of 72 of these purine- based in hibitors of C. difficile  pol IIIC, ibezapolstat , is highly active in vitro 
and in vivo, displaying excellent potential for further development as a clinical agent for the 
treatment of CDI ( Torti, 2011).  
New anti -CDI agents are needed to supplement those in current use for a t least 2  significant 
reasons: f irstly, ibezapolstat  selectively inhibits pol IIIC, a target heretofore unexploited in 
C. difficile  drug development. This property gives ibezapolstat strong potential for by[CONTACT_472791] C. difficile  during the prolonged administration 
of the agents in current use. Secondly, undesirable clinical issues frequently develop with prolonged use of some therapi[INVESTIGATOR_472752] . Recurrence of C. difficile  with 
vancomycin is a problem because vancomycin disrupts the normal balance of “good” bacteria in the gut, allowing “bad” bacteria to take over. Ibezapolstat , with its limited 
spectrum of activity, does not appear to disrupt the normal gut microbiome, thus having the potential to prevent the development and takeover  of resistant strains  needed for recurrence. 
Data from  Study ACX-362E-101 supports further rationale for advancing  ibezapolstat  into 
Phase 2 studies in the treatment of C. difficile . When administered to healthy subjects, 
ibezapolstat  was well tolerated, with an AE profile similar to placebo. All AEs but 1 were 
mild, transient, and nonrecurrent despi[INVESTIGATOR_147737]. No AE required a change in 
therapy or an intervention and there were no clinically important adverse changes in physical examinations, vital signs, laboratory testing results, or electrocardiograms ( ECGs ). 
Ibezapolstat  was shown to be an ideal treatment for C. difficile ; it has low systemic exposure 
after oral dosing and showed no accumulation following 10 days of repeat dosing, yet fecal concentrations rose rapi[INVESTIGATOR_472753] 2 to 3 orders of magnitude above the minimum inhibitory concentration for C. difficile . Furth ermore, after treatment with 
ibezapolstat , the fecal microbiome remained favorable, with less disruption to microbiota 
compared to vancomycin. Ibezapolstat  treatment resulted in decreased killing of 
Bacteroide tes and Firmicutes , which generally comprise 80% to 90% of the healthy fecal 
microbiome. The [ADDRESS_606054] of care, 
such as preservation of “good” elements of the microbiome or quicker r ecovery to 
pretreatment profiles. Furthermore, comparative microbiome profiling may provide information on the benefits  of ibezapolstat  to maintain normal intestinal flora, which has the 
potential to improve the efficiency of future ibezapolstat efficacy s tudies.

Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0

Page  24 of 72 5.4.1 Justification for Dose 
The ibezapolstat  dose chosen for this study is 450 mg. The results from Study ACX-362E-
101 showed that after administration of ibezapolstat  450 mg every 12 hours, stool 
concentrations of ibezapolstat  peak at higher concentrations compared to the 300 mg dose 
given every 12 hours and are consistently 2  to 3 orders of magnitude above the C. difficile  
minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms. The 
450 mg dose had an acceptable safety and tolerability profile  and thus was selected to ensure 
presumed therapeutic levels of ibezapolstat  in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of subject s with 
CDI, while minimally impacting normal gut microbiome composition. 
Vancomycin is a registered product and is commercially available. The usual adult total daily dose is 500 mg to 2 g administered orally in 3 or 4 divided doses for 7 to 10 days. For this study, 125 mg vancomycin will be administered approximately every 6 hours for 10 days, per 
current treatment guidelines for CDI ( McDonald, 2018).  
The 10- day duration of treatment was selected because: (a) this is the recommended duration 
of therapy for all  current standard  of care oral CDI drugs, according to the most recent 
Infectious Diseases Society of America and Society for Healthcare Epi[INVESTIGATOR_472754] ( McDonald, 2018); (b) by [CONTACT_344231], it is the standard regimen of oral 
vancomycin, which is being used as the active control agent in the Phase 2B segment of this 
trial; (c) Phase [ADDRESS_606055] established the safety of ibezapolstat  over 10 days of oral dosing; 
and (d) no human data exist to indicate that a shorter course of therapy with ibezapolstat  
would achieve acceptable efficacy for the treatment of CDI.

• ECC: this is defined as a clinical cure at the TOC visit (ie, at least [ADDRESS_606060] EOT) and no recurrence of CDI within the 56 ± [ADDRESS_606061] EOT (ECC56) and 84 ± [ADDRESS_606062] EOT (ECC84). Recurrence is defined as a new epi[INVESTIGATOR_76337] (≥ 3 UBMs in a 24-hour period) with a positive toxin result, using a Sponsor-approved C. difficile  
free toxin test and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], requiring ret reatment with an 
antibacterial agent for C. difficile . 
[ADDRESS_606063]  72 subjects.  
In Segment 2A, up to 20 subjects with diarrhea caused by C. difficile  will be enrolled and 
treated with ibezapolstat  450 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days. All subjects will be  
followed for recurrence for 28 ± [ADDRESS_606064] of both the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor (Chair), the Syneos Health  Medical Monitor, and up to [ADDRESS_606065]  72 additional subjects with CDI will be enrolled and randomly

Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  34 of 72 evening doses (every 12 hours) of study drug with food; subjects will record their fed or 
fasting status for each dose. The requirement to take study drug with food only affects 
ibezapolstat but not vancomycin or placebo; therefore, only morning and evening doses must 
be taken with food by [CONTACT_472798]. There is no dietary requirement for the 
other two daily dosing times.  
9.2 Vancomycin 
Vancomycin is commercially available as vancomycin hydrochloride 125-mg capsules. Vanc
omycin capsules will be over- encapsulated with gelatin capsules to be identical in 
appearance to ibezapolstat . 
Vancomycin will be packaged in blister packs identical to ibezapolstat  with each dose 
labeled as “Day X Dose X.”  
Vancomycin will be administered according to instructions in the package insert. 
Vancomycin is administered orally as [ADDRESS_606084] be taken with food; subjects will record their fed or fasting status for each dose. There is no dietary requirement for the 
other 2 daily dosing times. 
9.3 Placebo  
Placebo powder will be filled into gelatin capsules to be identical in appearance to 
ibezap
olstat. See Section 9.4 for placebo dosing instructions. 
The placebo capsules ar e manufactured by [CONTACT_25715][INVESTIGATOR_472761], India and will be supplied by [CONTACT_472797]. 
Packaging, labeling, storage, and handling of placebo will be the same as for ibezapolstat . 
9.4 Dosage Schedule  
Segment 2A  
In thi
s open-label segment, ibezapolstat  will be administered to all enrolled subjects as 
450 mg (three  150 mg capsules) every 12 hours for 10 days. Study drug will be administered 
with 240 mL water . There are no dietary requirements for this part of the study. 
Segment 2B

[CONTACT_472799]. Site staff will give the kits containing the blister packs to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472762] (if needed), or to the subject  to take home for self-dosing. 
9.5.2 Blinding  
Segment 2A  
Segment 2A is an open-label study; therefore, blinding is not applicable. 
Segment 2B  
Segment 2B is a double-blind study. Ibezapolstat , placebo , and vancomycin capsules will be 
identical in physical appearance by [CONTACT_46431]- encapsulation , packaged into blister packs with each 
dose labeled,  and will be administered [ADDRESS_606087] was assigned. Subjects randomized to 
vancomycin will receive 3 capsules (1 vancomycin capsule and 2 placebo capsules) to mimic 
the 3 ib ezapolstat  150 mg capsules every 12  hours (eg, 6 AM  and 6 PM ) and a single 
vancomycin capsule (eg, 12 AM  and 12 PM ) every [ADDRESS_606088] will remain blinded to study treatment 
throughout the study. 
According to the randomization schedule as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4), the Investigator or designee will obtain the kit number from the  IWRS for the 
subject . The pharmacist or designee will provide the assigned kit number to the subject. No 
study site personnel, subjects , Sponsor personnel, or Sponsor designees will be unblinded to 
treatment assignment throughout the duration of the study unless unblinding is required. If an 
Investigator becomes unblinded to a given subject’s study treatment, that subject  will 
continue in the study and undergo all protocol-required procedures for the determination of 
safety and efficacy.  
In the event that emergency unblinding is required for a given subject because of AEs or 
concerns for the subject’s safety  or wellbeing , the Investigator may break the randomization 
code for the  subject  via the IWRS , by [CONTACT_190359]. The 
Investigator is responsible for notifying the Medical Monitor and/or Sponsor of such an event 
within [ADDRESS_606089] or other designated individual will maintain records of drug kit number 
deli
vered to the study site (including amounts and lot numbers received , and confirmation of 
appropriate temperature conditions during transit), the inventory at the study site , the 
distribution to and use by [CONTACT_6992], and the return of materials to the Sponsor for storage

subjects . 
If the subject is hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], administration of all study drug will be supervised by [CONTACT_240473]. Only subjects enrolled in the study may receive study drug and only authorized study center staff may administer the study drug to the subject. The subject will enter the date and time of dose administration and indicate fed or fasting status 
for each dose in the subject diary. 
If the subject is discharged or not hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], a t each visi t after initiation of treatment, study 
site personnel will record compliance of the subject with the subject’s  assigned regimen. 
Subject s will receive a diary and are to record the time and date of each dose they take in the 
diary. Subjects  will be instruc ted to bring their diaries and drug kits containing 
unused/partially used/empty blister pack s back for inspection at each study visit , as 
compliance will be assessed by [CONTACT_472800] . Subjects  are to be 
reminded of the importance of compliance with their assigned regimen, with an emphasis on 
taking their study drug on schedule and maintaining the prescribed interval between doses. 
Discontinuation for noncompliance is at the Investigator’s discretion and is to be noted in the 
eCRF.  
Study site personnel will be instructed to keep unused study drug and empty study drug 
packaging for drug accountability. Investigational product will not be returned to the Sponsor 
until accountability has been fully monitored. Any unused study treatment material may be destroyed by [CONTACT_472801]. 
Investigators will maintain records that adequately document that the subjects were 
administered study drug from the correct study treatment kits and reconcile the products 
received from the drug  dispensing center. 
The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, 
receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).

f Only in women of childbearing potential. Serum test will be done at Screening; urine test will be done at the site at other specified time points.  
g If subject does not attend clinic then arrangements must be made to collect stool sample from subject’s  home. Sample must be collected before first dose 
of study drug. Stool samples should be kept cool and brought to the clinic within 24 hours after collection.  
h Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected 2 hours (± 15 minutes) and 4 hours (± 30 minute s) after first dose of the day . In Segment 2B, 
pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected in approximately 50% of subjects  (ie, approximately 36 subjects) . 
i Randomized Segment 2B subjects recruited from selected sites will have the opportunity to participate in an extended follow -up period to Day [ADDRESS_606105] igator (or designee) will obtain 
written informed consent from the subject . 
In the event that rescreening occurs , the individual is required to sign a new ICF and must be 
assigned a new identification num ber. 
10.2 Study Procedures  
Assessments and their timing are to be performed as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Tabl
e 4). Section  12.5 specifies laboratory assessment samples to be obtained.  
Assessments and procedures scheduled at a visit where study drug is administered should be 
performed before administration of treatment unless otherwise indicated in the Schedule of 
Assessments (Table 4).  
Efficacy  assessments are described in Section [ADDRESS_606106] igator may , at his/her discretion , arrange for a subject to have an unscheduled 
assessment, especially in the case of AEs that require follow -up or are considered by [CONTACT_472803]. The unscheduled visit page in the 
eCRF must be completed.  
Study discontinuation procedures are described in Section  8.4. 
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs leading to study discontinuation is discussed in Section  8.4. 
11 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS  
The Schedule of Assessments (Table 4) outlines the efficacy assessments to be performed 
throughout the study and their timing. 
11.[ADDRESS_606107] Diary  
Subjects will be provided with a diary and completion instruction at the baseline visit (Day  1). 
Ade
quate time should be allocated on Day [ADDRESS_606108] understands how to 
complete the diary and is willing and able to do so every day  throughout the study through 
Day 38/end of study visit. NOTE: The primary objective and endpoint for this study relies on 
subject reported data collected via the diary. It is critical that the Investigator and subject 
understand that accurate, complete, and contemporaneous diary data is required to meet the study primary objective. It is particularly important to ensure that each subject completes the diary 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -[ADDRESS_606109] the f ollowing details in their diary: 
• Date and time of each dose of study drug and if it was taken with food 
• Date, time, and consistency (using the Bristol Stool Chart) of all bowel movements (up to 
Day 12/TOC) 
• Date, time, and consistency of all UBMs from TOC to Day 38. Subjects will be required 
to answer a question every day in the diary to indicate if UBMs were experienced and to record the details of the UBMs if they occurred.  
Information from the diary will be used directly for analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. The Investigator or designee will be required to monitor the subject’s diary entries and contact [CONTACT_472804]. 
Data changes that constitute subject reported data are not permitted. Changes t o diary data will 
be limited to administrative corrections such as erroneous subject number, visit date, subject 
status, and elimination of duplicate data or merging of data for the same subject. 
Subject  reported diary errors will be reported as protocol deviations. 
Investigators or designated site staff will be responsible to have a missed diary entry completed 
by [CONTACT_472805]. 
Subject s who have difficulty completing the diary ma y be supported by a care provider either 
temporarily or for the duration of the study. This is permitted as long as the Investigator is 
confident that the support provided is adequate to ensure accurate entries into the diary on the 
subject’s behalf. The I nvestigator must document agreement for a care provider to enter 
information into the diary on behalf of the subject and the rationale.  
11.2 Clinical Cure  
Clinical cure: sur vival and the resolution of diarrhea in the 24-hour period immediately before 
EOT that i s maintained for [ADDRESS_606110] EOT without a requirement for additional CDI 
treatment . 
Treatment failures are defined as those subjects : 
• Who do not respond with reduced diarrhea; or 
• Whose diarrhea worsens during therapy; or 
• Who do not remain free of diarrhea for at least 2  days after the end of therapy ; or 
• Who require an additional treatment for CDI before the TOC visit; or 
• Who do not survive until the TOC visit. 
Subjects who failed study treatment will be offered treatment for CDI according to standa rd of 
care antibiotic at the Investigator’s discretion.  
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -[ADDRESS_606111] s will be followed for up to an additional 28 ± [ADDRESS_606112] treatment observation visits on Day 6 6 and Day 94 for 
those subjects participating in the extended follow-up period. 
11.3 Sustained Clinical Cure  
Sustained clinical cure: no recurrence of diarrhea from TOC  to Da y 38 among the subset of 
subjects who achieved an initial clinical cure. Recurrence is defined as ≥ 3 UBMs in any 24-hour 
period with free C. difficile  toxin A or B (or both) detected in a stool sample and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_18959], there is a need for CDI retreatment. 
The Investigator’s assessment of SCC will be based on the Investigator’s decision that there is no 
need for further treatment for CDI based on post treatment symptoms and signs during the 
28 ± [ADDRESS_606113] treatment.  
11.4 Extended  Clinical Cure  
Extended clinical cure: no recurrence of diarrhea from TOC to Day 56 (ECC56) and Day 84 
(ECC 84)
 among the subset of subjects who achieved an initial clinical cure. Recurrence is 
defined as ≥ 3 UBMs in any 24-hour period with free C.  difficile  toxin A or B (or both) detected 
in a stool sample and, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], there is a need for CDI retreatment. 
The Investigator’s assessment of ECC will be based on the Investigator’s decision that there is 
no need for further treatment for CDI based on post treatment symptoms and signs during the 
28 ± [ADDRESS_606114] treatment. 
11.5 Microbial Assessments  
Microbiome testing: Stool samples will be collected at the time points outlined in Table [ADDRESS_606115] be brought to the study clinic within 24 hours of collection. 
11.6 Time to Resolution of Diarrhea  
Time to resolution of diarrhea: the time from outset of treatment to the first formed bowel 
mov
emen t not followed within the next 24 hours by a UBM. 
11.7 Time to Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472765], and not followed by [CONTACT_472806] (for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_472742]).

Page  48 of 72 and concomitant medications are to be perform ed at protocol- specified visits, as specified in the 
Schedule of Assessments (Table 4).  Study subjects will be monitored carefully throughout each 
dosing period for adverse experiences. A qualified physician will assess the relationship of AEs 
to study drug and in general based on such considerations as temporal relationship to study drug 
administration, subject’s relevant medical history, and whether the finding is likely because of  a 
pre-existing condition. 
12.[ADDRESS_606116]’s  pre-existing conditions , including all prior significant 
illnesses , up to and including [ADDRESS_606117] dosing ( Day 1 ) are to be 
regarded as concomitant. Medical history will include alcohol consumption and smoking history. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected during the study and/or worsening of a concomitant illness during the study are to be documented as AEs in the eCRF  in accordance with Section  12.6. All 
changes not present at baseline  or described in the past medical history and identified as 
clinically noteworthy must be recorded as AEs. 
Additionally, demographic data will be collected for all subjects  and incl ude age, sex, race, 
ethnicity, and CDI history. 
12.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs (body temperature, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1487], heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood 
pre
ssure measurements) will be evaluated at the visits indicated in the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 4). All vital signs will be measured after the subject  has been resting in a sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_12473] 5 minutes. Blood pressure measurements are to be taken in the same arm for the duration of the study. Either an automated or manual measurement of blood pressure is acceptable; however, the same method should be used for the duration of the study. Body weight (without shoes) will be recorded whenever vital signs are recorded; height (without shoe s) will 
be recorded at Screening only. 
Vital sign measurements will be repeated if clinically significant or machine/equipment errors occur. Out- of-range blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697], or heart rate measurements will be repeated 
at the Investigator’s di scretion. Any confirmed, clinically significant vital sign measurements 
must be recorded as AEs.  
12.3 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination (head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; heart; lungs; abdomen; skin; cer
vical and axillary lymph nodes; and ne urological and musculoskeletal systems) will be 
performed at Screening  (Visit 1). Physical examinations will be performed by a physician. 
A limited physical examination to verify continued subject  eligibility and to follow -up regarding 
any change in medical history will be performed at the visits indicated in the Schedule of

This document is confidential.  
Page  49 of 72 Assessments (Table 4). Symptom- driven, limited  physical examinations will be performed as 
clinically indicated at any study visit.  
12.4 Electrocardiograms  
A 12 -lead, resting (sitting or supi[INVESTIGATOR_1919] 10 minutes) ECG will be obtained at the visits 
indi
cated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 4 ). Study sites may use their standard operating 
procedures for detailed instructions on conducting the ECG. 
At Screening, the I nvestigator will examine the ECG traces for signs of cardiac disease that 
could exclude the subject from the study. An assessment of normal or abnormal will be recorded; 
if the ECG is considered abnormal, the abnormality will be documented in the eCRF. ECGs will 
be repeated if clinically significant abnormalities are observed or artifacts are present.  
12.5 Laboratory Assessments 
Laboratory assessment samples ( Tabl e 5) are to be obtained at designated visits as detailed in the

performed if the results of dipstick indicate abnormalities to be further investigated. All 
laboratory reports must be reviewed, signed, and dated by [CONTACT_737]. A legible copy of all 
reports must be included in the subject’s  medical record (source document) for that visit  and the 
site must enter laboratory results manually into EDC for each subject. Any laboratory test result

Page  50 of 72 considered by [CONTACT_80213] (clinically 
significant AEs include those that require an intervention). Clinically significant abnormal values 
occurring during the study will be followed up until repeat test results return to normal, stabilize, 
or are no longer clinically significant. 
12.6 Adverse Events  
An AE is any symptom, physical sign, syndrome, or disease that either emerges during the study 
or, if
 present at Screening , worsens during the study, regardless of the suspected cause of the 
event. All medical and psychiatric conditions (except those related to the indication under study) 
present at Screening  will be documented in the medical history eCRF. Changes in these 
conditions and new symptoms, physical signs, syndromes, or diseases should be noted on the AE 
eCRF during the rest of the study. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities should also be recorded as AEs. Surgical procedures that were planned before the subject enrolled in the study 
are not considered AEs if the conditions were known before study inclusion; the medical condition should be reported in the subject’s  medical history. 
Recurrence of CDI is a disease- related event that is common in subjects with CDI and can be 
serious/life threatening. Because recurrent CDI  is an important medical event, all recurrences of 
CDI will be reporte d to the Sponsor per the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs. 
Subjects  will be instructed to report AEs at each study visit. All AEs are to be followed up until 
resolution or a stable clinical endpoint is reached. 
Each AE is to be documented in the eCRF with reference to date of onset, duration, frequency, 
severity, relationship to study drug, action taken with study drug, treatment of event, and 
outcome. Furthermore, each AE is to be classified as being serious or nonserious. Changes in AEs and resolution dates are to be documented in the eCRF.  
For the purposes of this study, the period of observation for collection of AEs extends from the time the subject  gives informed consent through study completion, as indicated in the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 4 ). Follow-up of the AE, even after the date of therapy discontinuation, is 
required if the AE persists until the event resolves or stabilizes at a  level acceptable to the 
Investigator. 
When changes in the intensity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum 
intensity for the event should be noted. If the intensity category changes over a number of days, 
then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates).  
Specific guidelines for classifying AEs by [CONTACT_240479] 6 and Table 7. 
Table 6. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_390754] : An event that is easily tolerated by [CONTACT_423] , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with 
everyday activities.  
MODERATE: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.

This document is confidential.  
Page  51 of 72 SEVERE : An event that prevents normal everyday activities.  
 
Table 7. Classification of Adverse Events by [CONTACT_472807] : This category applies to those AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly due to extraneous 
causes (disease, environment, etc. ). 
POSSIBLY : This category applies to those AEs for which a connection with the test drug administration 
appears unlikely but cannot be ruled out with certainty. An AE may be considered possibly related if or when 
it meets 2 of the following criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
drug; (2) it could not readily have been produced by [CONTACT_423]’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, 
or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; or (3) it follows a known pattern of response to the test 
drug. 
PROBABLY : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels with a high degree of certainty are 
related to the test drug. An AE may be considered probably related if or when it meets 3 of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose (note that there are exceptions when an AE does not disappear upon discontinuation of the drug, yet drug- relatedness clearly exists; for example, as in bone marrow depress ion, fixed drug eruptions, or 
tardive dyskinesia); or (4) it follows a known pattern of response to the test drug. 
DEFINITELY : This category applies to those AEs that the Investigator feels are incontrovertibly related to test 
drug. An AE may be assigned  an attribution of definitely related if or when it meets all of the following 
criteria: (1) it follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; (2) it could not be 
reasonably explained by [CONTACT_20612]’s  clinical state, environmental or toxic 
factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject ; (3) it disappears or decreases on cessation or 
reduction in dose and recurs with reexposure to drug (if rechallenge occurs); and (4) it follows a known pa ttern 
of response to the test drug. 
Abbreviation: AE , adverse event. 
12.6.[ADDRESS_606118] medical occurrence, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
that: 
• results in death, 
• is life -threatening , 
• results in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081], 
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity , and/or 
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
• Other important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], based upon appropriate medical judgment, are considered SAEs 
if they are thought to jeopardize the subject  and/or require medical or surgical  
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes defining an SAE.  
SAEs are critically important for the identification of significant safety problems; therefore, it is important to take into account both the Investigator’s and the Sponsor’s assessment. If either the 
Sponsor or the Investigator believes that an event is serious, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by [CONTACT_80220]. 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -[ADDRESS_606119] be reported within 24 hours of occurrence or when the Investigator becomes aware of the event. Notification can be made using

written report must follow within [ADDRESS_606120]’s  
participation in the study is to be followed up until it either resolves, stabilizes, returns to baseline values  (if a baseline value is available), or is shown to not be attributable to the study 
drug or procedures. 
12.6.3 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
AEs that meet all of the following criteria will be classified as suspected unexpected serious 
adverse r eactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) and reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance 
with applicable regulatory requirements for expedited reporting: 
• serious 
• unexpected (ie, the event is not consistent with the safety information in the Investigator’s Brochure) 
• there is at least a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the 
event and the study treatment 
Acurx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACX -362E -201 
Ibezapolstat  Version  6.0 
This document is confidential.  
Page  53 of 72 The Investigator will assess whether an event is causally related to study treatment. The Sponsor 
(or Syneos Health) will consi der the Investigator’s assessment and determine whether the event 
meets the criteria for being reportable as a [ADDRESS_606121] be reported to the regulatory authorities and the independent ethic s 
committee ( IEC)/institutional review board ( IRB) (where required) within 7 days after the

within a further [ADDRESS_606122] be reported to the relevant regulatory 
authorities and the IEC/IRBs within 15 calendar days after the Sponsor (or Syneos Health) first 
has knowledge of them. 
The Sponsor (or Syneos Health) is responsible for reporting S[LOCATION_003]Rs and any other events 
required to be reported in an expedited manner  to the regulatory authorities and for informing 
investigators of reportable events, in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements within specific timeframes. Investigators will notify the relevant IEC/IRBs of reportable events within the applicabl e timeframes.  
12.6.4 Pregnancy  
Women of childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening . 
Following administration of study drug, any known cases of pregnancy in female subjects  will be 
reported until the subject  completes or withdraws from the study. The pregnancy will be reported 
immediately by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing a completed pregnancy report to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. The pregnancy will not be processed as an SAE; 
however, the Investigator will follow -up with the subject  until completion of the pregnancy and 
must assess the outcome in the shortest possible time but not more than 30 days after completion 
of the pregnancy. The Investigator should notify the Sponsor (or designee) of the pregnancy outcome by [CONTACT_17258] a follow-up pregnancy report. If the outcome of the pregnancy involved spontaneous or therapeutic abortion (any congenital anomaly detected in an aborted fetus is to be 
documented), stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, the I nvestigator will report the 
event by [CONTACT_29658]/emailing  a completed pregnancy report form to the Sponsor (or designee) within

participating in the study, the pregnancy should be reported to the Sponsor (or designee) within 
[ADDRESS_606124] s will be 
asked to complete the EQ -5D- 5L at certain intervals in Segment 2B throughout the study, as 
specified in Table 4. Instructions to respondents are included in the questionnaire. The EQ-5D-
5L essentially consists of 2 pages – the EQ -5D descriptive system (page 2) and the EQ visual 
analog  scale (page 3). T he EQ -5D-5L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. 
If, at any visit, the subject is unable to complete the EQ-5D-5L independently, then it should not be compl eted for that visit.  
12.8 Medical Resource Utilization Questions  
Medical resource utilization data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected in the eCR
F by [CONTACT_472808]. Protocol-

This document is confidential.  
Page  56 of 72 The following descriptive statistics will be used as applicable to summarize the study data unless 
otherwise specified:  
• Continuous variables: sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. Geometric mean and coefficient of variation will be included for relevant PK parameter summaries.  
• Categorical variables: frequencies and percentages.  
14.1 Determination of Sample Size 
Segment 2A is considered a proof- of-pri nciple substudy and is not hypothesis driven; the sample 
size of up to 20 subjects was selected to provide some degree of precision for the estimated cure 
rate, as shown in the table below: 
Table 8. Estimate d Cure Rate and Associated 95% Confidence Intervals  Based on the 
Normal Approximation 
Estimated Cure Rate (%)  95% Confidence Interval (%)  
75 (56.0, 94.0)  
80 (62.5, 97.5)  
85 (69.4, 100.0)  
90 (76.9, 100.0)  
Sample size for Segment 2B  was calculated based on the following assumptions: 
1. Non-inferiority study 
2. Endpoint is clinical cure at the TOC visit 
3. One-sided normal approximation test 
4. Overall alpha = 0.05 
5. Allocation to treatment = 1:1 
6. True cure rate = 0.80 in both arms  
7. Non-inferiority margin = 0.25 
8. Power = 80%  
9. Sample size adjusted for one interim analysis  (Pocock 1977). 
A sample size of 3 6 subjects per treatment group, or 72 subjects  total, will satisfy these criteria . 
Further, subjects at  selected sites will undergo  extended follow-up to Day 94. At these selected 
sites, consecutive subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in the extended 
follow-up period until approximately 16 subjects are recruited. 
14.2 Anal ysis Populations 
14.2.1 Enrolled  Pop ulation 
The Enrolled population will include all subjects who sign the ICF.

Page  57 of 72 14.2.2 Intent -to-Treat Population 
The intent- to-treat ( ITT) population will include all subjects  who are enrolled and treated in 
Segment 2A or who are randomi zed in Segment 2B . In Segment 2B, subjects will be analyzed 
based on their randomized assignment. The ITT population will be used as the primary analysis 
of efficacy.  
14.2.[ADDRESS_606127] dose without important protocol deviations/violations or events thought to affect the PK. 
14.[ADDRESS_606128] s with initial clinical cure will be followed for up to an additional 28 ± 2 days 
to assess the recurrence of CDI.  
For Segment 2A, this endpoint will be summarized using frequencies and percentages, together with a 95% exact (Clopper- Pearson) confidence interval for the true cure percentage.  
For Segment 2B, the null and alternative hypotheses for this endpoint are as follows: 
H

where π 1,T and π 1,C are the true proportions of subjects with clinical cure at the TOC visit for the 
ibezapolstat  [ADDRESS_606129] (Clopper- Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true cure percentage.  
The 95% confidence interval based on the normal approximation will also be c alculated for the 
difference between the 2 population proportions (π 1,C – π1,T). The null hypothesis will be tested 
using a one-sided normal approximation test non-inferiority at the 0.[ZIP_CODE] significance level 
(Pocock  1977) for an overall significance level of 0.05. In the event non-inferiority of 
ibezapolstat  450 mg is demonstrated, Fisher’s exact test (two-sided) will be used to conduct a 
test for superiority  at the 0.05 significance level . 
14.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Efficacy Endpoint : Sustained Clinical Cure  
The secondary efficacy endpoint is SCC , which is defined below, and is determined for subject s 
who achieve initial clinical cure. The determination will be made at the Day 38 follow-up visit. 
1. Recurrence is defined as ≥  3 bowel movements with unformed stools in any 24-hour 
period with free C. difficile toxin A or B (or both) detected in a stool sample and in the 
opi[INVESTIGATOR_689], there is a need for CDI retreatment.  
2. SCC is  defined a s initial clinical cure without subsequent recurrence within 28 ± [ADDRESS_606130] (Clopper- Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true cure percentage.  
For Segment 2B, this endpoint will be summarized by [CONTACT_438435], together with an exact (Clopper-Pearson) 95% confidence interval for the true SCC percentage. A 95% confidence interval based on the normal a pproximation will also be 
calculated for the difference between the 2 population proportions (π
1,C – π1,T). The null 
hypothesis that the true proportions are equal for the 2 treatments will be tested using a two -sided 
Fisher’s exact test at the 0.05 signif icance level .

Collection of Pregnancy Information: 
Male Subject s With Partners Who B ecome Pregnant 
The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male subject’s female 
partner who becomes pregnant while the male subject  is in this study up to [ADDRESS_606153] pregnancy information on the appropriate form and submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. Information on the status of the mother and 
child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Female Subject s Who B ecome Pregnant  
The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject  who becomes 
pregnant up to [ADDRESS_606154] 's 
pregnancy. The subject  will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow -up information on the subject  and the neonate and the 
information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the 
procedure. 
While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or 
elective termination of a pregnan cy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is 
always considered to be an SAE and will be reported as such. Any post-study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_472817]  12.6.4. While the Investigator is not obligated to actively 
seek this information in former study subject s, he or she may learn of an SAE through

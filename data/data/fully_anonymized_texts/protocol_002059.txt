 3 1.0 OBJECTIVES  
Primary objectives:   
1. To determine the efficacy and clinical activity of subcutaneous (SC) bortezomib in 
patients with low or intermediate-1 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) 
Secondary objectives:  
2. To determine the safety and tolerance of SC bortezomib in low or intermediate- [ADDRESS_1038544] of SC bortezomib on modulation of NF- Kb activity  in patients with 
low or intermediate -1 MDS by p65  immunohistochemistry  staining (ICH)  
 
2.0 BACKGROUND 
2.1 MDS 
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) consist of a group of clonal myeloid disorders 
characterized by [CONTACT_758489] a 
tendency towards transformation to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)1,2. The precise 
incidence of MDS is not known, however incidence rates for MDS in the Unit ed States 
have been estimated at 1.0 to 12.6 per 100,000 individuals. MDS affects more 
frequently patients of advanced age, particularly those > 60 years of age, that are not 
generally candidates for intensive chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation 
strategies3. The risk of MDS also appears to be greater in men than in women. MDS is 
a heterogeneous disease. In some patients it manifests as an indolent disease whereas 
in others it is aggressive and may progress rapi[INVESTIGATOR_758477] (AML). MDS can be classified using different systems, such as the French-
American-British (FAB), or the World Health Organization (WHO) classifications4. The 
International Prognostic Score System (IPSS), is a prognostic classification of MDS that 
is widely used to predict survival and progression to AML5. The IPSS combines data on 
the percentage of marrow blasts, cytogenetic alterations and number of cytopenias to 
estimate a patient’s risk category.  With this scoring system, patients are divided into 
low, intermediate (int-1), int-2 and high-risk disease (Table 1). Based on this data, the 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 4 median survival of patients with low or int-1 MDS ranges between 3.5 to 5.7 years. For 
the majority of low- or int- 1 risk patients (excluding only those with the rare 5q deletion 
or PDGFR gene rearrangement subtypes: approximately 10- 15%), specific and highly 
active therapy is not available or approved. Hence, many physicians, especially in the 
community tend to “observe” these patients and do not start specific MDS directed 
therapy. However, patients with low/ int-1 MDS may develop significant cytopenia’s. A 
large number of these patients will become transfusion dependent over time which may 
result in iron overload with its resultant complications including cardiomyopathy, liver 
failure, diabetes and hypothyroidism. Thus, there may be an unmet medical need for 
treatment of low/ int-1 MDS.

Score are as follows: Low: 0; INT-1: 0.5-1.0; INT-2, 1.5-2.0 and high risk  2.5 points. 
Good karyotype includes: diploid, -Y, del(5q), del(20q). Poor karyotype: complex ( 3 
abnormalities) or chromosome 7 abnormalities. Intermediate karyotype, all others. 
Cytopenias are considered if the absolute neutrophil count is  1800 K/uL; hemoglobin 
less than 10 g/dl and the platelets are less than 105 K/uL. 
 
We have recently completed an analysis of the prognosis of patients with lower risk 
MDS (low and int-1) referred to MDACC over the last [ADDRESS_1038545] 
developed a prognostic score. The score is based on patient characteristics including 
cytogenetics, age, percentage of blasts, hemoglobin and platelet counts. Based on this 
model, patients with lower-risk MDS can be divided in 3 groups (Figure 1 ). As can be 
seen in the figure, over 60% of patients with lower risk MDS have poor prognosis. Of 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 5 great importance, it should be noted that only 10% of the patients transformed to AML. 
This indicates that a majority of patients with lower risk MDS die as a consequence of 
MDS and not from AML transformation. Therefore the traditional strategy of “watch and 
wait” used by [CONTACT_758490]-risk MDS may not be indicated. 
Therefore new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_758478] . At the present time, 3 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_758479]. These include 5-azacitidine7, 
lenalidomide8 , and more recently 5-aza- 2’-deoxycitidine (decitabine)9. Both 5-
azacitidine and decitabine are hypomethylating agents, whereas lenalidomide is a 
thalidomide derivative. Lenalidomide is indicated for specific subset of patients with 
MDS, in particular those with alterations of chromosome [ADDRESS_1038546] of the clinical benefit with the hypomethylating agents 
has been documented for patients with more advance disease, such as those with int- 2 
and high-risk disease7,9,10.

 6 2.2 Rationale for the study 
At the present time, 3 pharmacological agents are approved for patients with MDS in 
the United states. These include azacytidine7, 5-aza- 2’-deoxycytidine (decitabine)[ADDRESS_1038547] of the clinical benefit from hypomethylating agents (azacytidine and 
decitabine) has been documented in patients with INT-2 or High-risk MDS7,9,11. 
Lenalidomide is only active in a small fraction of patients (those with del5q and anemia, 
approximately  5-10% of patients). Transplant is offered only to a very small group of 
patients with Low/ INT -[ADDRESS_1038548] of care in lower risk MDS remains 
suboptimal and there is a need to identify new therapi[INVESTIGATOR_758480]/IN T-[ADDRESS_1038549] identified NF-kB activation (p65) in lower risk MDS (Figure 2). We have also 
detected p65 activation in MDS by [CONTACT_758492].  In fact P65 activation was noted to be a 
common feature of lower risk MDS. The clinical course of patients with p65 activated 
MDS and their response to therapy remains poorly understood at this time. However, 
we expect that patients with activated p65 will have more advanced disease and 
therefore worse risk. Thus p65 could be a potential target for therapy in MDS. We 
believe that p65 activation serves as a biomarker of NF-kB activation. Hence, we 
hypothesize that subcutaneously administered ( SC) bortezomib could have clinical 
activity in patients with lower risk MDS and p65 activation. As mentioned above, in our 
experience, patients with lower risk MDS but poor prognosis merit therapeutic 
  Protocol 2012-[ADDRESS_1038550] in this study. 
 
 
2.3 Bortezomib (Velcade, PS-341) 
Bortezomib for Injection is a small-molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by 
[CONTACT_24312], Inc., (Millennium) as a novel agent to treat human 
malignancies.  Bortezomib is currently approved by [CONTACT_72563] (US FDA) for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  It is 
also indicated for the treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have 
received at least 1 prior therapy.  In the European Union (EU), bortezomib in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of patients 
with previously untreated MM who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with 
bone marrow transplant.  Bortezomib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of 
progressive MM in patients who have received at least [ADDRESS_1038551] is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also differ.  Bortezomib has a 
novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer Institute (NCI) in vitro and in vivo 
assays.i  In addition, bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft tumor 
models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and 
radiation.ii,iii,iv,v,vi,vii,viii,ix,x,xi,xii,xiii,xiv  Notably, bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over 
express bcl-2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to 
conventional chemotherapeutics.xv 
The mechanisms of action leading up to apoptosis have been more clearly defined and 
include initiation of the unfolded protein response and direct/indirect effects on various 
molecular targets including cell cycle control proteins p27 and p21, cyclins, signal 
transduction molecules, transcription factors c-jun and HIF1-
  tumor suppressor 
protein p53, angiogenesis factors, and many others.  Bortezomib is thought to be 
efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor B (NF-B) activation, 
its attenuation of interleukin-6 (IL -6)-mediated cell growth, a direct apoptotic effect, and 
possibly anti-angiogenic and other effects.xvi,xvii,xviii,xix,xx,xxi,xxii,xxiii 
 
2.4 Clinical Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Distribution, Metabolism, 
Elimination, Renal impairment: 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of bortezomib has been determined from 
phase 1 studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malignancies, and 
confirmed in phase 2 studies in subjects with multiple myeloma.  
 
Bortezomib demonstrates multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following 
intravenous administration of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first-dose 
maximum observed plasma concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112 ng/mL, 
respectively in 11 patients with multiple myeloma and creatinine clearance values >50 
mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study. In subsequent doses, mean 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 9 maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1.0 
mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m2 dose. The mean elimination half-life 
of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from [ADDRESS_1038552] dose. Mean Total Body Clearances were 102 
and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, respectively, 
and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 1.3 
mg/m2, respectively. Clinical experience has shown that the change in clearance does 
not result in overt toxicity from accumulation in this multidose regimen in humans.  
 
In subjects with advanced malignancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effect 
(inhibition of 20S activity) occurred within 1-hour post dose. At the therapeutic dose of 
1.3 mg/m2 in subjects with multiple myeloma, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1-hour 
post dose was approximately 61%. 
 
The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized by [CONTACT_758493], followed by [CONTACT_758494] 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment 
activity. On the Day 1, 4, 8, and 11 schedule, variable (10%–30%) levels of proteasome 
inhibition have been observed at next scheduled dosing. In theory, this advantage 
allows cells to recover proteasome activity for normal cellular housekeepi[INVESTIGATOR_758481]. 
 
The relationship between bortezomib plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition 
can be described by a maximum effect (Emax) model. The Emax curve is initially very 
steep, with small changes in plasma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 
2.0 ng/mL, relating to large increases in the percent inhibition (0–60%). After that, a 
plateau occurs where marginal increases of proteasome inhibition are observed in spi[INVESTIGATOR_758482]. 
 
Subcutaneous administration 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 10 Following multiple 1.3 mg/m2 doses, the mean (SD) maximum plasma bortezomib 
concentration (C max) was approximately 10 times lower following SC administration 
(20.4 [8.9] ng/mL) compared with IV administration (223 [101] ng/mL), with a short T max 
of approximately one-half hour following VELCADE SC injection. However, AUC last was 
equivalent for both routes of administration with a geometric mean ratio (SC to IV) of 
0.992 and 90% CI of 80.18% to 122.80%; ie, within the standard 80 – 125% 
bioequivalence criteria. 
The mean percent inhibition of proteasome activity (E max) was comparable for the SC 
and IV groups (63.7% vs. 69.3%; respectively) following multiple 1.3 mg/m2 SC or IV 
doses of VELCADE. Mean AUE 72 following SC injection was comparable to that of the 
IV injection and within the observed variability (CV = 36 - 55%). 
The exploratory analyses showed that there were no apparent pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic differences related to the site of SC injection (abdomen versus thigh) 
taking into consideration the small sample size of the 
pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic part of the study. 
Bortezomib was reconstituted to a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL for SC administration. In 
the randomized Phase 1 study CAN-1004, bortezomib was injected subcutaneously in a 
concentration of 1 mg/mL. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of 
the SC administration were comparable between the 2 studies (Table 1). Thus, the 
concentration of the SC injected solution does not appear to influence bortezomib 
pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
parameters following IV administration in the current study were also comparable to 
those observed previously for IV administrationxxiv.

The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 
L/m2 following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m2 or 1.3mg/m2 to patients 
with multiple myeloma. This suggests bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral 
tissues. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the 
concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL. 
 
In vitro studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome 
P450 isozymes indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized via 
cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4, 2C19, and 1A2. Bortezomib metabolism by [CONTACT_097] 2D6 
and 2C9 enzymes is minor. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form [ADDRESS_1038554] not been characterized in humans.A 
pharmacokinetic study was conducted in patients with various degrees of renal 
impairment who were classified according to their creatinine clearance values (CrCl) 
into the following groups: Normal (CrCl _60 mL/min/1.73 m2, N=12), Mild (CrCl=40- 59 
mL/min/1.73 m2, N=10), Moderate (CrCl=20-39 mL/min/1.73 m2, N=9), and Severe 
(CrCl < 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, N=3). A group of dialysis patients who were dosed after  
dialysis was also included in the study (N=8). Patients were administered intravenous  
doses of 0.7 to 1.3 mg/m2 of bortezomib twice weekly. Exposure of bortezomib ( dose 
normalized  AUC and Cmax) was comparable among all the groups.  
 
Clinical Experience 
It is estimated that as of June 2011, more than 300,[ADDRESS_1038555] been treated with 
bortezomib, including patients treated through Millennium-sponsored clinical trials, 
Investigator-Initiated Studies, the US NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), 
and with commercially available drug.  Bortezomib has been commercially available 
since 13 May 2003. 
The overall goal of the Millennium phase 1 program was to determine the MTD and 
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of bortezomib in a number of therapeutic settings involving 
subjects with various advanced malignancies.  In a phase 1 trial in patients with 
refractory hematologic malignancies, the MTD for a twice weekly dosing for 4 weeks of 
a 42-day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, 
hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise.xxv  The toxicity was greatest during the third and 
fourth weeks of therapy.  In the 3-week schedule of bortezomib monotherapy (4 doses, 
given on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21-day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 
mg/m2/dose (3 subjects with Grade 3 diarrhea and 1 with peripheral sensory 
neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  In a 35-day 
treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of bortezomib monotherapy, the MTD was 1.6 
mg/m2/dose and DLT included hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope. 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 13 In phase 1 clinical studies, antitumor activity was reported in subjects with Non-
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma (NHL), MM, Waldenström’s Macroglobulinemia, squamous cell 
carcinoma of the nasopharynx, bronchoalveolar carcinoma of the lung, renal cell 
carcinoma, and prostate cancer.xxvi,xxvii,xxviii ,xxix 
The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in subjects with MM were investigated in two 
phase 2 clinical studies, studies M34100-024 (subjects with first relapse)xxx and 
M34100-025 (subjects with second or greater relapse and refractory to their last prior 
therapy).xxxi  In M34100-025, [ADDRESS_1038556] 2 previous treatments received bortezomib, 1.3 mg/m2 on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 
21-day treatment cycle.  The European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) 
response criteria, as described by [CONTACT_758495].  Complete responses (CRs) were observed in 4% of subjects, with an 
additional 6% of patients meeting all criteria for CR but having a positive immunofixation 
test.  Partial response (PR) or better was observed in 27% of subjects, and the overall 
response rate (CR, PR, and minor response [MR] combined) was 35%.  Seventy 
percent of subjects experienced stable disease or better. 
The phase 3 study (M34101- 039)xxxiii, also referred to as the APEX study, was designed 
to determine whether bortezomib provided benefit (time to progression [TTP], response 
rate, and survival) to patients with relapsed or refractory MM relative to treatment with 
high-dose dexamethasone.  The study was also designed to determine the safety and 
tolerability of bortezomib relative to high-dose dexamethasone, and whether treatment 
with bortezomib was associated with superior clinical benefit and quality of life relative 
to high-dose dexamethasone.  A total of 669 patients were enrolled and 663 patients 
received study drug (bortezomib:  331; dexamethasone:  332).  Patients randomized to 
bortezomib  received 1.3 mg/m2 IV push twice weekly on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 3-
week cycle for up to 8 treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by 1.3-mg/m2 
bortezomib weekly on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 5-week cycle for 3 cycles as 
maintenance therapy.  Patients randomized to dexamethasone received oral 
dexamethasone 40 mg once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of a 5-week 
cycle for up to 4 treatment cycles as induction therapy, followed by [CONTACT_149618] 40 
mg once daily on Days 1 to 4 of a 4-week cycle for 5 cycles as maintenance therapy.

 14 The EBMT response criteria were utilized to determine disease response.  There was a 
78% increase in TTP for the bortezomib arm.  Median TTP was 6.2 months for the 
bortezomib arm and 3.5 months for the dexamethasone arm (p < 0.0001).  CR + PR 
was 38% with bortezomib versus 18% with dexamethasone (p  0.0001).  CR was 6% 
with bortezomib versus  1% with dexamethasone (p < 0.0001).  The CR + nCR (near 
CR) rate was 13% with bortezomib versus 2% with dexamethasone.  In patients who 
had received only 1 prior line of treatment (bortezomib:  132; dexamethasone:  119), CR 
+ PR was 45% with bortezomib vs 26% with dexamethasone (p = 0.0035).  With a 
median 8.3 months of follow-up, overall survival was significantly longer (p = 0.0013) for 
patients on the bortezomib arm versus patients on the dexamethasone arm.  The 
probability of survival at 1 year was 80% for the bortezomib arm versus 66% for the 
dexamethasone arm, which represented a 41% decreased relative risk of death in the 
first year with bortezomib (p = 0.0005).  In patients who had received only 1 prior line of 
treatment, the probability of survival at 1 year was 89% for the bortezomib arm versus 
72% for the dexamethasone arm, which represented a 61% decreased relative risk of 
death in the first year with bortezomib (p = 0.0098).  Updated response rates and 
survival data were reported for M34101-039.xxxiv  The updated CR + PR rate was 43% 
with bortezomib.  The CR + nCR rate was 16% with bortezomib.  With a median 
22 months of follow-up, overall survival was significantly longer for patients on the 
bortezomib arm versus patients on the dexamethasone arm.  The median overall 
survival was 29.8 months (95% CI:  23.2, not estimable) for the bortezomib arm vs 23.7 
months (95% CI:  18.7, 29.1) for the dexamethasone arm (hazard ratio = 0.77, 
p = 0.0272).  The probability of survival at 1 year was 80% for the bortezomib arm 
versus 67% for the dexamethasone arm (p = 0.0002). 
The safety and efficacy of bortezomib in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphom a 
(MCL) were investigated in an international, phase 2, multicenter study M34103-053, 
also referred to as the PI[INVESTIGATOR_91782].xxxv  The single-arm study was designed to 
evaluate the response rates, duration of response (DOR), TTP, overall survival (OS), 
and safety of bortezomib treatment in patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell 
lymphoma.  For 141 evaluable patients, the response rate was 31% (8% 
CR/unconfirmed CR [Cru]).  Median time to response was 40 days (range 31-204 days).

was 23.5 months in all patients and 36 months in patients with CR/Cru.  Survival at 12 
months was 69% overall and 91% in responding patients. 
The phase 3 study (MMY 3002) known as the VISTA study, evaluated the safety and 
efficacy of the combination of bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone in previously 
untreated multiple myeloma patients who were not candidates for stem cell 
transplant.xxxvii  The study was designed to determine the benefit of adding bortezomib 
to MP (melphalan and prednisone) as assessed by [CONTACT_91826].  Patients (682) were 
randomized to receive nine 6-week cycles of melphalan 9mg/m2 and prednisone 
60 mg/m2 on Days 1 to 4, alone or in combination with bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 by [CONTACT_758496] 1, 4, 8, 11, 22, 25, 29, and 32 during Cycles 1 to 4, and on Days 1, 8, 22, 
and 29 during Cycles 5 to 9.  Response was evaluated every 3 weeks using the EBMT 
criteria.  At a preplanned interim analysis, the independent data monitoring committee 
recommended that the study be stopped since the prespecified statistical boundary end 
point of TTP had been crossed.  Response rates were 30% with 4% CR.  The rates of 
partial response or better were 71% in the bortezomib (VMP) group compared to 34% in 
the MP group (p = 0.001).  With follow-up of 16.3 months, the TTP for the VMP group 
was 24 months compared to 16.6 months in the MP group (p = 0.000001) and was 
associated with a 52% reduced time to progression.  The median DOR was 19.9 
months in the VMP group and 13.1 months in the MP group.  Overall survival had not 
been reached in either group.  Hematologic toxicity was similar in both groups.  The 
incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms was higher 
in the VMP group.  The incidence of herpes zoster was 3% in patients in the VMP group

 16 who received antiviral prophylaxis.  Fifteen percent of patients in the VMP group 
discontinued therapy due to AEs compared to 14% in the MP group. 
The VISTA study update after extended follow-up of 25.9 months,xxxviii confirmed a 
survival benefit for the VMP group.  Overall survival was not reached in either group:  
VMP group (75) deaths, 3 year OS 72%; MP group (111) deaths, 3 year OS 59% 
(p = 0.0032).  Patients on VMP were less likely to start second-line therapy (VMP 38% 
vs MP 57% at the time of data cut-off) with a longer time to next therapy (TNT) and 
treatment free interval (TFI).  Of the MP patients who received subsequent therapy, 
43% went on to receive bortezomib. 
Based on investigator-reported best responses to subsequent therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], patients 
relapsing after therapy with a novel agent were not intrinsically more resistant than after 
receiving a traditional agent. 
In the VISTA study, VMP was associated with prolonged TTP, TNT, TFI, and OS.  
Patients were successfully treated with subsequent IMiD-based therapy and retreated 
with bortezomib.  After 36.7 months follow-up, OS continued to be superior for 
VMP.  The OS for VMP had not yet been reached compared to MP (43.1 months ).xxxix In 
an updated analysis of overall survival based on 387 deaths (median follow-up 60.1 
months), the median overall survival for VMP was 56.[ADDRESS_1038558] ration of 0.695 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.85).[ADDRESS_1038559] similar systemic drug

safety profiles. The pi[INVESTIGATOR_758484], when administered at 1 mg/mL concentrationxl.  
The data from the Phase 1 pi[INVESTIGATOR_91784] a  randomized, 
Phase 3 study that compared t he efficacy and safety of subcutaneous versus

  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 17 in patients with relapsed multiple myelomaxxiv. 222 patients were randomly assigned in a 
2:1 ratio to receive either subcutaneous (n=148) or intravenous (n=74) bortezomib. The 
response -evaluable population consisted of 145 patients in the subcutaneous group and 
73 in the intravenous group. Patients re ceived a median of eight cycles (range one to 
ten) in both groups.  
The ORR (CR+PR) after 4 cycles of treatment, assessed by [CONTACT_758497], was 42 % in both the SC and IV treatment 
groups for the response-evaluable population. The ORR after 4 cycles in the IV arm 
was consistent with what was observed in historical single-agent bortezomib trials with 
relapsed multiple myeloma subjects. The stratified Mantel-Haenszel estimate of the 
relative risk of achieving response for SC treatment group versus IV treatment group 
was 0.99 with 95% CI (0.71, 1.37). The 95% CI for ORR_SC - 0.6 ORR_IV was (6.1, 
27.1), which excludes 0. Thus the study met the noninferiority objective (p-value for the 
noninferiority hypothesis was 0.[ZIP_CODE]). Results in the ITT population were similar; 
noninferiority of SC versus IV was also demonstrated. 
The CR rate after 4 cycles of treatment was 6% in the SC treatment group and 8% in 
the IV treatment group; the nCR rate after 4 cycles of treatment was 6% in the SC 
treatment group and 5% in the IV treatment group; the VGPR rate after 4 cycles of 
treatment was 4% in the SC treatment group and 3% in the IV treatment group. 
Therefore, 17% subjects in the SC treatment group and 16% subjects in the IV 
treatment group had obtained at least VGPR after the first 4 cycles. 
The ORR (CR+PR) after 8 cycles of treatment was 52% in both the SC and IV treatment 
groups for the response-evaluable population. The stratified Mantel-Haenszel estimate 
of the common relative risk of achieving response for SC versus IV was 1.00 with 95% 
CI (0.77, 1.31). Twenty-five percent of subjects in the SC treatment group and 25% of 
subjects in the IV treatment group had obtained at least VGPR during the first 8 cycles. 
The median TTP (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 10.[ADDRESS_1038560] ratio was 0.839 with 95% CI 
(0.564, 1.249), and the p=0.3866 (stratified log-rank test), indicating similar results 
between the SC and IV arm. 
  Protocol 2012-05 62

 18 The median PFS (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 10.[ADDRESS_1038561] ratio was 0.824 with 95% CI 
(0.574, 1.183), and the p=0.2945 (stratified log-rank test), indicating comparable results 
between the SC and IV arm.  
After a median follow-up of 11.8 months, the 1-year survival rate was 72.6% in the SC 
arm and 76.7% in the IV arm. The p-value for the difference in 1-year survival rate was 
0.5037, indicating similar results between the SC and IV arm. 
The median time to first response (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 3.[ADDRESS_1038562] ratio was 1.059 with 95% CI (0.716, 1. 567), 
and the p=0.7725 (stratified log-rank test), indicating similar results between the SC and 
IV arm. Among the responders, the median time to first response was 1.4 months 
(44 days) in the SC arm and 1.4 months (43 days) in the IV arm. Among the 
responders, the median duration of response (Kaplan-Meier estimate) was 9.7 months 
in the SC treatment group, compared with 8.7 months in the IV treatment group. 
Overall, similar efficacy results were observed in the SC and IV treatment groups, and 
the study demonstrated that bortezomib SC administration is not inferior to bortezomib 
IV administrationxxiv.

Addendum 1.  
a Incidence is assigned using the following convention:  very common (  1/10); 
common (  1/100 and  1/10); uncommon (  1/1000 and  1/100); rare 
( 1/10,000 and  1/1000 ); very rare (  1/10,000, including isolated reports).  
b Acute diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease is a MedDRA L ower Level Term 
which corresponds to a Preferred Term of Interstitial lung disease.  
 
Other medical events of interest that are considered not causally related to bortezomib 
include hepatic failure and QT prolongation.  Fatal outcomes have been reported. 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while being treated 
with bortezomib.  Genotoxicity testing has shown that bortezomib is negative in the in 
vitro Ames assay and in the in vivo micronucleus assay, but it is a clastogen in the in 
vitro chromosomal aberration assay. 
Additional details on the potential risks of bortezomib may be found in the current 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
 
SAFETY SUMMARY FOR SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION   
While the safety profile between the SC and IV treatment groups in general was 
comparable in most System Organ Classes (SOCs), a difference in incidence in certain 
safety parameters in favor of the SC treatment group was noted. One hundred and forty 
(95%) subjects in the SC treatment group and 73 (99%) subjects in the IV treatment 
group reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event. In the SC treatment group, 
there was a lower incidence of Grade 3 adverse events as compared with the IV 
treatment group (57% vs. 70%, respectively); a lower incidence of adverse events 
leading to treatment discontinuations (22% in the SC treatment group and 27% in the IV 
treatment group); and a lower incidence of adverse events leading to dose modifications 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 26 in the SC group: dose reduction (33% in the SC treatment group compared with 45% in 
the IV treatment group); dose withholding (30% in the SC treatment group compared 
with 39% in the IV treatment group); or cycle delay (20% in the SC treatment group 
compared with 34% in the IV treatment group). Serious adverse events were similar 
between the 2 treatment groups (36% in the SC treatment group and 35% in the IV 
treatment group). Deaths during treatment (within [ADDRESS_1038567] dose) were 5% in the 
SC treatment group and 7% in the IV treatment group.  
The SC treatment group reported a lower incidence in several adverse events 
associated with VELCADE toxicity. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy events (all 
Grades) was 38% in the SC treatment group and 53% in the IV treatment group; the 
incidence of Grade 2 peripheral neuropathy events was 24% in the SC treatment 
group and 41% in the IV treatment group; and the incidence of Grade 3 peripheral 
neuropathy event was 6% in the SC treatment group and 16% in the IV treatment 
group. There also appeared to be a trend towards lower incidence in gastrointestinal 
adverse events (37% for SC and 58% for IV, predominantly due to differences in Grade 
1-2 abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dyspepsia); as well as a 5% difference in incidence 
of Grade 3 and 4 hematology laboratory results in the SC treatment group compared 
with the IV treatment group for WBC (8% in the SC treatment group compared with 18% 
in the IV treatment group), neutrophil count (22% in the SC treatment group compared 
with 28% in the IV treatment group) and platelets (18% in the SC treatment group 
compared with 23% in the IV treatment group). 
Local tolerability of SC administration was acceptable. Nine (6%) subjects reported a 
local reaction to SC administration as an adverse event. Eighty-five (58%) subjects in 
the SC treatment group reported at least [ADDRESS_1038568] 
common local injection site reaction was redness which was reported in 84 (57%) 
subjects. The majority of subjects with worst injection site reactions were assessed as 
mild (38%) or moderate (18%). Only 2 (1%) subjects were reported as having severe 
injection site reactions. All local site reactions resolved completely and rarely led to 
treatment modifications. 
In conclusion, the SC administration of VELCADE has good local tolerance. The 
systemic safety profile for the SC administration of VELCADE was associated with a 
lower incidence of Grade 3 adverse events, and treatment modifications 
(discontinuations and dose reductions). In particular, there was a lower incidence of 
peripheral neuropathy NEC reportedxxiv.

4.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
Overview 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 29 This open-label, Phase II study is designed to determine the clinical activity, safety and 
tolerability of Bortezomib in patients with low or intermediate-1 risk MDS. All patients will 
be registered through Protocol Data Management System (PDMS) or CORe.  
 
Schedule of administration Cycle 1: 
Bortezomib will be administered via subcutaneous route at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 on days 
1, 4, 8 and 11 of a 21 day cycle. A course of treatment will be approximately 21 days. 
The dose and schedule is adapted based on PK and safety data for subcutaneous 
Bortezomib as published by [CONTACT_394868]22.  
 
Subsequent cycles:  
Patients will receive the first course of therapy without interruption regardless of degree 
of myelosuppression.  Patients can continue to receive therapy for a maximum of 2 
years if indicated (see below “Duration of therapy”). After the first course of therapy, 
interval between cycles of therapy can be spaced out at the discretion of the treating 
physician, although a schedule as close to possible as the proposed one will be 
attempted. If prolonged myelosuppression is observed (defined by [CONTACT_758501] (ANC) count of less than 1 x 109/L and a platelet count of less 30 x 109/L for 
more than 42 days with evidence of a hypocellular marrow (marrow cellularity less than 
5% without evidence of recurrent MDS) subsequent courses of bortezomib will be given 
at the next lower dose, once the counts recover. Count recovery will be considered if 
the ANC is 1 x109/L, platelets more than 50 x109/L. In the rest of potential clinical 
situations, subsequent courses of therapy will be administered at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  
 
Cycles will be repeated as long as possible until toxicity or lack of response for at least 
6 cycles of therapy. The dose and schedule is adapted from Moreau et al22. In that 
study, the median number of cycles was 8 (range 1 to 10). 
 
Duration of Therapy 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 30 In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue up to 
2 years until one of the following criteria applies: 
a) Clinically significant progressive disease 
b) Possibility of undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation 
c) Clinically significant intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of 
treatment 
d) Patient request or 
e) General or specific changes in the patient's condition that render the patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator or treating 
 
5.0 DOSING DELAYS/ DOSE MODIFICATIONS: 
Dose modifications will be based on guidelines shown in Table [ADDRESS_1038573] occurred after the previous dose(s).  Toxicities are to be 
assessed according to the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), Version or 4.0 (as preferred by [CONTACT_106954]; 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ). 
 
Dose delay window is +[ADDRESS_1038574] 72 hours 
between each dose of bortezomib. 
 
All previously established or new toxicities observed any time are to be managed as 
described in Table 3 1.  Neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy are to be 
managed as described in Table 4.

 If the patient was receiving 1 mg/m2, reduce the dose to 0.7 mg/m2. 
If the patient was receiving 0.7 mg/m2, discontinue drug. 
Patients who experience bortezomib-related neuropathic pain or peripheral sensory 
neuropathy are to be managed as presented in Table 4 .  Once the dose is reduced for 
peripheral neuropathy, the dose may not be re-escalated.

Patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1.5  ULN) do not require a starting 
dose adjustment.  Please note that patients with bilirubin levels > 1.[ADDRESS_1038576] are excluded 
from enrollment in this protocol unless Gilbert’s Syndrome is present.  If a patient 
develops  study drug related moderate or severe hepatic impairment with bilirubin ≥ 
Grade 2 (> 1.[ADDRESS_1038577]) while on study, the investigator should hold Bortezomib until 
the toxicity returns to < Grade 2. Restarting Bortezomib at the next lower dosed level 
could be considered at the Investigator’s discretion and following exclusion of  
Bortezomib-induced liver impairment and careful consideration of liver disease due to 
other causes, such as, but not limited to, active infection and leukemia-related liver 
disease.

 34 Neurotoxicity-Directed Questionnaire 
The neurotoxicity-directed questionnaire (see Appendix F) is a useful tool for 
determining the presence and intensity of neuropathic pain and/or peripheral 
neuropathy from the patient’s perspective.  It is not a tool intended for direct scoring and 
toxicity grading.  Neuropathic symptoms are more prominent than abnormalities on the 
clinical examination.  After the patient completes the neurotoxicity-directed 
questionnaire, the questionnaire should be reviewed to assist with the evaluation of the 
onset and intensity of peripheral neuropathy and other neurotoxicities that may possibly 
require intervention or dose modification. 
 
6.0 AGENT FORMULATION AND PROCUREMENT 
SC Bortezomib will  be provided by [CONTACT_20555]. This is an FDA approved agent for 
patients with multiple myeloma.  
Bortezomib Administration  
Drug will be administered only to eligible patients under the supervision of the 
investigator or identified subinvestigator(s).  Patients may be treated on an outpatient 
basis, if possible. 
The drug will be prepared under the supervision of a pharmacist, or appropriately 
qualified and trained personnel.  The amount (in mg) of drug to be administered will be 
determined based on body surface area.  Body surface area is to be calculated based 
on body weight using a standard nomogram or calculation.  The dose should be 
calculated on Day 1 of each cycle; the dose administered should remain the same 
throughout each cycle but should be recalculated at the start of the next cycle.  If a 
patient experiences a notable change in weight within a cycle, as determined by [CONTACT_151236], then the patient’s dose should be recalculated at that 
time based on clinical judgment. 
There must be at least [ADDRESS_1038578] 
DIFFERENT RECONSTITUTED CONCENTRATIONS. CAUTION SHOULD BE USED 
WHEN CALCULATING THE VOLUME TO BE ADMINISTERED. 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 35  
SUBCUTANEOUS ADMINISTRATION:  
Drug is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib.  Each vial 
of bortezomib for Injection should be reconstituted under a laminar flow biological 
cabinet (hood) within eight hours before dosing with 1.4 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, 
Sodium Chloride Injection USP, so that the reconstituted solution contains bortezomib 
at a concentration of 2.5 mg/mL for subcutaneous administration.  
Subcutaneous Administration Precautions:  
 The drug quantity contained in one vial (3.5 mg) may exceed the usual dose 
required.  Caution should be used in calculating the dose to prevent overdose.  
 When administered subcutaneously, sites for each injection (thigh or abdomen) 
should be rotated.   
 New injections should be given at least one inch from an old site and never into 
areas where the site is tender, bruised, erythematous, or indurated.  
 If local injection site reactions occur following bortezomib administration 
subcutaneously, a less concentrated bortezomib solution (1 mg/mL instead of 2.5 
mg/mL) may be administered subcutaneously.  Alternatively, the IV route of 
administration should be considered.  
 In clinical trials of bortezomib IV, local skin irritation was reported in 5% of 
patients, but extravasation of bortezomib was not associated with tissue damage. 
In a clinical trial of subcutaneous bortezomib, a local reaction was reported in 6% 
of patients as an adverse event, mostly redness.  
Packaging, and Labeling 
Bortezomib will be supplied in vials as open-label stock.  Both the box label and vial 
label will fulfill all requirements specified by [CONTACT_20556]. 
  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 36 Treatment Compliance 
All drug will be administered to eligible patients under the supervision of the investigator 
or identified subinvestigator(s).  The pharmacist will maintain records of drug receipt (if 
applicable), drug preparation, and dispensing, including the applicable lot numbers, 
patients’ height, body weight, and body surface area (see Appendix), total drug 
administered in milliliters and milligrams, and date and time of administration.  Any 
discrepancy between the calculated dose and dose administered and the reason for the 
discrepancy must be recorded in the source documents. 
Precautions and Restrictions 
It is not known what effects bortezomib has on human pregnancy or development of the 
embryo or fetus.  Therefore, female patients participating in this study should avoid 
becoming pregnant, and male patients should avoid impregnating a female partner.  
Nonsterilized female patients of reproductive age and male patients should use effective 
methods of contraception through defined periods during and after study treatment as 
specified below. 
Female patients must meet 1 of the following: 
 Postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, or 
 Surgically sterile, or 
 If they are of childbearing potential, agree to practice [ADDRESS_1038579] 1 of these 2 methods be highly effective (see 
examples below). 
Highly effective methods  Other effective methods (barrier 
methods)  
Intra-uterine devices (IUD)  Latex condom  
Hormonal contraceptives (birth control 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_3353]/oral contraceptives, injectable 
contraceptives, contraceptive patches,

  Protocol 2012-05 62 
  October 31, 2013 
 37 If one of the highly effective methods cannot be used, using 2 effective methods 
at the same time is recommended.   
 
Male patients, even if surgically sterilized (ie, status postvasectomy) must agree to 1 of 
the following: 
 Practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study treatment period and 
through a minimum of [ADDRESS_1038580] dose of study drug, or completely abstain 
from heterosexual intercourse.  
 
6.1 Concomitant therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014]: 
a) Anti-emetic therapy 
Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for nausea and vomiting is 
recommended.  
b) Anti-Diarrheal Therapy 
Treat study treatment-related diarrhea with loperamide 4 mg followed by 2 mg 
after each loose stool up to a maximum of 16 mg daily. Use alternate 
approaches in patients intolerant of loperamide. Consider prophylactic 
loperamide if previous therapeutic treatment was required in same or 
previous patients. 
c) Transfusion to maintain Hgb > 8 gm/dL and platelet count > 10,000/_L is 
recommended. Higher levels may be targeted if clinically appropriate. 
d) G-CSF may be used in cases of neutropenia and suspected or documented 
infection at physician’s discretion. Erythropoietin and darbepoietin are not 
permissible. 
e) Tumor lysis syndrome Monitoring, prophylactic and therapeutic treatment for 
tumor lysis syndrome is recommended as per institutional criteria. 
f) Infection prophylaxis . Prophylaxis with oral antimicrobial agents is permitted 
for neutropenic patients. 
g) Investigators should consider using antiviral prophylaxis in subjects being 
treated with bortezomib.

12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
General Description: 
This is a Phase II open-label, efficacy and toxicity study of SC bortezomib in subjects 
with low and int-1 myelodysplastic syndrome.  The primary efficacy outcome is the 
overall response rate based mainly on hematologic improvement defined by [CONTACT_758503], partial remission and marrow complete 
remission.  
 
Efficacy monitoring: 
A maximum of [ADDRESS_1038583] that: 
   
                                      Pr(
 <0.15|data)>0.95 
 
Here 
  is the overall response (OR) rate. Since currently the standard practice is to put 
these patients on observation, an OR rate of about 15% is worth considering. We 
assume the OR rate has a prior Beta distribution (0.3, 1.7) with mean of 0.15 and 
variance of 0.0425. The study will be stopped early if: 
 
(The number of patients who hematological improvement) / (The number of patients 
evaluated) 
  0/8, 1/24, 2/37, 3/40 
 
That is, if at any time during the study we determine that there is a greater than 95% 
chance that the average OR rate is less than 15%, we will terminate the study. 
 
The operating characteristics of this design are as follows:

Statistical methods: 
Data analysis will be performed using SAS or S-plus, as appropriate. The proportion of 
patients having hematologic improvement and the proportion of patients having grade 3 
or higher toxicities will be estimated by a Bayesian posterior credible interval. If the 
study is completed with 40 patients and there are 6 patients with hematologic 
improvement, a 90% posterior credible interval for the average rate of hematologic 
improvement will be 7% to 25%.  
 
13.0 PROTOCOL ADMINISTRATION 
Protocol specific data will be entered into PDMS/CORe. 
 
Protocol amendments: 
Changes to the protocol will be made only when protocol amendments have been 
signed by [CONTACT_458] [INVESTIGATOR_758488]. 
 
Archival of data: 
All patient data (including source data) generated in connection with this study will be 
kept in the archives of the MDACC in accordance with [ADDRESS_1038585] MedComm Solutions (see below) and report the event.  Whenever 
possible, the associated product should be maintained in accordance with the label 
instructions pending further guidance from a Millennium quality representative. 
A medication error is a preventable event that involves an identifiable patient and that 
leads to inappropriate medication use, which may result in patient harm.  While 
overdoses and underdoses constitute medication errors, doses missed inadvertently by 
a patient do not.  Individuals who identify a potential medication error situation should 
immediately contact [CONTACT_128131] (see below) and report the event.

Title  Systems Biology of 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(PNEUMOVAX®23) and 13 -valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (PREVNAR®13) (HIPC : VAX -003). 
Short Title  System s Biology PPV23  and PCV13 . 
Rationale  PCV13 [13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar ®13)] 
induces better functional immune responses when compared to 
PPV23 [23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 
(Pneumovax® 23)] in older naïve adults. We h ypothesize that this is 
due to intrinsic defects in innate responses that could explain the 
poor immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared to PCV13. 
Therefore, we propose to extensively study innate and adaptive 
immune responses generated after administration of either 
pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines in older adults.

13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PREVNAR®13 or 
PCV13)  ([COMPANY_007], [LOCATION_001], NY) . 
Study Procedures  Vaccination, targeted physical examination, phlebotomy , urine 
pregnancy test.  
Statistical 
Considerations  At the center of this study is the identification of the generic innate 
signatures and the correlation sign atures of innate immune 
response.  
The generic innate signatures will be identified from both immune 
parameters measured by [CONTACT_7811]/Luminex assays and array -based 
gene expression will be measured by [CONTACT_878335]. The 
generic innate signatures will b e identified for the treatment groups 
separately.  
The traditional immune parameters and array -based gene 
expression that change after immunization are considered generic 
innate signatures.  
After vaccination, the innate signatures that are correlated with  the 
adaptive immune responses (day 30 OPA titers, day 30 IgG levels, 
day 180 serotype specific avidity indexes, plasmasblasts)  are 
considered correlation signatures of the innate immune responses.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
1.1 Background 
Pneumococcal diseases are a major public health problem, globally. According to the World 
Health Organization, invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) are responsible for 1.[ADDRESS_1227106] of preventing pneumococcal infections. Until  
December 2011, only one vaccine was licensed in the [LOCATION_002] for adults: 
PNEUMOVAX®23, the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPV23) based on the [ADDRESS_1227107] 90% of pneumococcal blood isolates and at least 85% of all pneumococcal isolates from 
sites which are generally sterile as determined by [CONTACT_878336] U.S. data. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_878312] (>70%) among adults, they 
are still 24,000 cases per year of IPD leading to 4,500 deaths among adults>50 years5. Also 
PPV23 does not appear to reduce the much larger burden of nonbacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia with 364,000 cases each year among adults ≥ 65 years of age in the [LOCATION_002]4. 
This is explained in part by [CONTACT_878337] (OPA activity and avidity) of 
antibodies in the elderly after PPV236.  
The 7 and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV7, PREVNAR®7 and PCV13 , 
PREVNAR®13, respectively) have been licensed for use in the US for children since 2000 and 
2010 respectively. The 7-valent conjugate vaccine has led to a marked reduction (~84 to 90% )  in 
disease burden events linked to the 7 vaccine serotypes  even in adults due to a “herd 
immunity”  effect from universal vaccination in children <2 years old 5,7. Since December 2011, 
PREVNAR®13 (PCV13) is licensed for adults 50 years and older. When PCV13 is given to older 
adults (age 60-64) who ha ve never received PPV23, it induces opsonophagocytic antibody 
(OPA) titers to shared serotypes in both vaccines, and for most of those serotypes the immune

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 responses to PCV13 are significantly greater than those induced by [CONTACT_210681]238. A Phase IV trial, the 
Community Acquired Pneumonia Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPI[INVESTIGATOR_34172]) is currently 
underway to evaluate the efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine type nonbacteremic pneumococcal 
pneumonia in adults ≥ [ADDRESS_1227108] immune response 
after vaccination in the elderly. 
 In this context, systems biology approaches offer a new approach to compare the global 
architecture of the immune response between PPV23 and PCV13. Systems biology is a biology-
based inter-disciplinary study field that focuses on complex interactions in biological systems , 
using a new holistic perspective. Systems biology offers several so- called “Omic” technologies 
that can provide unbiased and rich information on the physiological state of organisms through 
their molecular profiles. These systems biology approaches are likely to be of value in 
identifying molecular signatures that are induced rapi[INVESTIGATOR_878313], and predict, the later development of protective immune responses. Such a strategy 
would be particularly useful when evaluating the efficacy or immunogenicity of suboptimal 
vaccines, or in identifying individuals who are likely to respond sub-optimally to vaccination, 
such as the elderly receiving PPV23 in particular. Furthermore, the predictive signatures would 
highlight new correlates of protective immunity and stimulate the formulation and validation 
of new hypotheses on the biological mechanisms by [CONTACT_878338]-induced immunity and protection. Despi[INVESTIGATOR_878314], they have only recently been applied to vaccinology10, 11. 
Accordingly, a key goal of the present proposal is to identify molecular signatures that predict 
the sub-optimal immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared to PCV13 in the elderly . One of the

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 key systems biology technologies that will be employed are microarray analyses. Essentially, 
blood samples will be isolated at baseline (day 0 prior to vaccination), and at days 1, 3, 7, [ADDRESS_1227109] 
vaccination, and the RNA from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated and analyzed 
for the expression of mRNAs. The microarray platform will be Affymetrix Human Genome 
U133 Plus 2.0 Array, similar to what we had used previously10. In our previous work on yellow 
fever vaccine10, we identified a gene signature [CONTACT_878368]-17D CD8+ 
T cell responses with up to 90% accuracy in an independent, trial. A distinct signature, 
including B cell growth factor TNFRS17, predicted then neutralizing antibody response with up 
to 100% accuracy. These findings highlight the utility of system biology approaches in 
predicting vaccine efficacy. 
In summary the proposed study offers an unprecedented opportunity to capture the global 
architecture of immune responses to PPV23 versus PCV13 in the elderly. This is likely to have a 
major impact in t wo areas: (i) the elucidation of unique signatures of innate immune response 
that predict vaccine immunogenicity, and will thus be relevant from a public health perspective ; 
(ii) such unique signatures of innate immune response may illuminate the immunologic defects 
responsible for sub-optimal immunity in the elderly population when using a polysaccharide 
vaccine when compared to a conjugate vaccine. 
1.2 Rationale for Selection of Study Population 
To be able to probe the immune system and better understand the innate and adaptive immune 
responses in older adults to pneumococcal vaccines, 88 healthy volunteers between the ages of 
25-40 and 60-89 years will be randomized to receive either PPV23 or PCV13 in a 1:1 ratio. Both 
vaccines are approved for persons 50 and above. However, we elected to study older subjects 
(60 years and above) because functional antibodies decrease markedly with more advanced age. 
The younger group will include [ADDRESS_1227110] of age on immune responses to PCV13 and PPV23. Subjects will be recruited 
from the general population of metro Atlanta and enrolled at the Hope Clinic, located in 
Decatur, GA. 
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227111](s)/Intervention(s) 
The vaccines used in the study will be PNEUMOVAX®23 manufactured by [CONTACT_44873] (Whitehouse 
Station, NJ) and PREVNAR®13 manufactured by [CONTACT_4618] ([LOCATION_001], NY). Subjects in the study 
will be administered 1 dose per label of PNEUMOVAX®23 or PREVNAR®13. Study vaccines 
will be purchased from the manufacturers or their distributors. 
1.[ADDRESS_1227112](s)/Intervention(s) and Regimen 
Both vaccines will be tested and compared to better understand the innate and adaptive 
immune responses of polysaccharide and conjugate pneumococcal vaccines in the elderly.  
1.[ADDRESS_1227113] the capsular 
polysaccharide of the bacteria serotype involved. Protective immunity is mainly dependent 
upon type-specific, anti-capsular antibodies, although serological correlates of immunity are 
poorly defined. Capsular polysaccharides when incorporated alone into vaccines are recognized 
by [CONTACT_878339] “T -cell independent anti gens”. The “T -cell independent” responses 
do not develop in children until 2 years of age. Although adequate IgG levels are obtained, the 
humoral response is characterized by a short-lived initial IgM response and the absence of a 
memory response12. In eld erly, these “T -cell independent” responses elicit an a dequate 
quantitative response (by [CONTACT_6428]) but a suboptimal qualitative response (measured by [CONTACT_878340]) in vaccine recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]6. Thus, capsular polysaccharides alone are poorly immunogenic in 
the yo ung and the elderly13, 6. 
The limited response to capsular polysaccharides has been overcome by [CONTACT_878341], which can present the antigen as a T-cell 
dependent epi[INVESTIGATOR_9230]. The glycoconjugate vaccines are “T -cell dependent antigens” and induce 
antibodies with good avidity 14 (47 to 76% of antibodies remaining bound to the antigen coated-
ELISA well after addition of 0.05M sodium thiocyanate), maturation, isotype switching, as well 
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227114] immunity 5, 7  
Antibody mediated killing of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) by [CONTACT_878342]. It is 
thought that opsonophagocytic antibodies reflect in vivo  mechanisms of defense against 
pneumococcal infection. Measurement of opsonophagocytic antibodies (functional antibody 
assay) using a standardized opsonophagocytic assay (OPA) is important for the evaluation of 
candidate vaccines4 and a requirement for the licensure of new pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
formulations in infant populations. The measurement of functional antibodies has been shown 
to better correlate with protection in infant populations and it is also likely to be a better 
indicator for elderly populations than the measurement of antibodies specific to the capsular 
polysaccharides by [CONTACT_6428] (antibody binding assay). 
Although vaccination with PPV23 provides some protection against invasive pneumococcal 
disease in a healthy elderly population, there is evidence that vaccine efficacy declines with age 
16, and with associated co-morbidities4. The decrease in efficacy could be associated with the 
impairment in the functional quality of the response. Even with advanced age, individuals seem 
to retain the ability to quantitatively respond to PPV (measured by [CONTACT_6428]). However, the ability 
to elicit a functional antibody response (measured by [CONTACT_878343] (OPA) is reduced 
with advanced age 6, 17. 
In a randomized study comparing PCV13 to PPV23 in pneumococcal vaccine naïve subjects 
between the ages of 60 to 64 years, the GMTs for 10 of the 12 serotypes common to both 
vaccines were higher in the PCV13 group, and were statistically significant higher for 8 of the 12 
serotypes8. In a previous randomized study comparing PCV7 to PPV23 in pneumococcal 
vaccine naïve subjects ≥[ADDRESS_1227115] shown tha t 
PPV23 contains both TLR2 and TLR4 ligands. Our preliminary in vitro data show that PPV23 
signals via TLR2 and TLR9 and activates human CD11c+ myeloid DC precursors to secrete 
several cytokines and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-12p40, TNF and IL-8. Interestingly MCP-1, 
a chemokine involved in recruitment of many inflammatory cells including monocytes, was not

A better knowledge of the innate immunity is crucial to understand the immunologic 
mechanisms of response to PPV23 and PCV13 vaccines.

1.[ADDRESS_1227117](s)/Intervention(s) 
Pneumococcal polys accharide vaccine is recommended for all adults aged ≥65 years and those 
adults aged 19-64 years with underlying medical conditions that put them at greater risk for 
serious pneumococcal infection 20. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
will continue to review evidence as it becomes available to guide development of a 
recommendation regarding routine use of PCV13 in adults aged 50 years and older21 . Eleven 
immunocompetent subjects between the ages of 25-40 will receive PPV23 without an indication. 
Safety concerns in this group are not anticipated on the basis of previous safety data generated 
in young adults vaccinated with pneumococcal vaccines with lower valency (6 and 12) which 
was used to support the licensure of PPV2321a .Additionally, the safety profile is not expected to 
differ between young adults without co-morbidities and adults with a medical indication to 
receive PPV23. 
PNEUMOVAX®23, manufactured by [CONTACT_44873] (Whitehouse Station, NJ), is indicated for 
vaccination against pneumococcal disease caused by [CONTACT_878344]. The most common adverse experiences reported in >10% of subjects vaccinated with 
PNEUMOVAX®23 in clinical trials were: local reaction at injection site including 
pain/soreness/tenderne ss, erythema, swelling/induration and systemic reaction, mostly with 
asthenia/fatigue, myalgia and headache.  
  
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227118] approval use of PNEUMOVAX 23 include:  
Guillain-Barré syndrome,  radiculoneuropathy, seizure, angioneurotic edema, cellulitis, nausea, 
vomiting, arthralgia, arthritis, limb mobility decreased, paresthesia, weakness, anaphylactoid 
reaction, lymphadenitis, serum sickness. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a 
population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or 
their causal relationship to product exposure. 22. 
PREVNAR®13, manufactured by [CONTACT_4618] ([LOCATION_001], NY), is indicated in adults (50 years or 
older) for prevention of pneumonia and invasive disease caused by [CONTACT_878345]. In adults aged 50 years and older solicited adverse reactions reported in 
>10% of subjects vaccinated with PREVNAR®13 were: pain at the injection site (>50%), fatigue 
(>30%), headache (>20%), muscle pain (>20%), joint pain (>10%), decreased appetite (>10%), 
injection site redness (>10%), injection site swelling (>10%) and  limitation of arm movement 
(>10%)23. In one randomized study comparing safety of PCV13 to PPV23 in 60-64 years old 
previously unvaccinated, the frequency of local reactions was not statistically significant in both 
arms except for pain (more frequent in the PCV13 arm). Also the frequency of systemic 
reactions was not statistically different in both arms except for decrease in appetite, joint and 
muscle pains (more frequent in the PPV23 arm) 23. In 6 studies comparing the safety of PCV13 to 
PPV23, SAE were similar among both groups (around 6% at [ADDRESS_1227119] vaccination) 23.  
Eleven immunocompetent subjects between the ages of 25-40 will receive PCV13 without an 
indication. The safety profile of PREVNAR13®  in immunocompetent healthy adults aged 25- 40 
years -including both systemic and injection-site adverse events- is not expected to be different 
than in subje cts ≥ 50 years old. Safety concerns in this group are not anticipated on the basis of 
previous safety data generated in young adults vaccinated with pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccines with lower valency (7). Multiple studies have been published on the use of 
PREVNAR7® in immunocompromised hosts in transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]23a and HIV infected 
subjects 23b with acceptable safety profile. In one study with 25 young adults non HIV infected 
between the ages of 29-46, side effects with PREVNAR7® were mild (98%) mostly involving 
local tenderness, malaise, and myalgia. These side effects occurred within 7 days after 
vaccination and none were severe or life-threatening 23b.  
 
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227120] passed since their previous dose.  
Persons aged >65 years should be administered a second dose of vaccine if they received the 
vaccine >65 years previously and were aged <65 years at the time of primary vaccination. 
Revaccination with PNEUMOVAX®23 is considered safe although for subjects aged > 65 years 
the overall injection-site adverse experiences rate was higher following revaccination (79.3%) 
than following primary vaccination (52.9%). The rate of vaccine-related systemic adverse 
experiences was also higher following revaccination (33.1%) than following primary vaccination 
(21.7%) in subjects > [ADDRESS_1227121] pneumococcal disease has not been clearly defined, it is unknown if the 
lower antibody levels seen on revaccination correlate with inferior protection. There is also the 
added advantage of increased serotype coverage by [CONTACT_878346]23.  Currently, there are no

immunocompetent adults previously vaccinated with PCV13.  
1.6.2 Risk of Study Procedures 
The discomforts of this study include having blood drawn, intramuscular (IM) injection, and 
possible allergic reactions to the components the pneumococcal vaccines administered in the 
study. 
Drawing blood causes transient discomfort and may cause fainting. Bruising at the blood draw 
site may occur but can be prevented or lessened by [CONTACT_878347]. Intramuscular injection also may cause transient discomfort. The use of aseptic 
technique will make infection at the site where blood will be drawn or where the vaccination is 
given extremely unlikely. Vaccines used in the study will be a single vial dose preventing the 
risk of over or under dosing and the potential risk of contamination when compared to multi-
dose vials. 
In the clinical trials of PNEUMOVAX® [ADDRESS_1227122] common local adverse events at the site of 
injection were pain/tenderness/soreness (60.0%), swelling/induration (20.3%), and erythema. 
The most common systemic adverse experiences were headache (17.6%), asthenia/fatigue 
(13.2%), and myalgia (11.9%).  All of these adverse reactions were reported at a rate lower than 
10% after receiving a placebo injection.  
In the post-marketing experience of PNEUMOVAX®23, the following additional adverse 
reactions have been identified: Cellulitis, Malaise, Fever (>102°F), Warmth at the injection site, 
Decreased limb mobility, Peripheral edema in the injected extremity, Nausea, Vomiting, 
Lymphadenitis, Lymphadenopathy, Thrombocytopenia in patients with stabilized idiopathic 
thrombocytopenic purpura, Hemolytic anemia in patients who have had other hematologic 
disorders, Leukocytosis, Anaphylactoid reactions, Serum Sickness, Angioneurotic edema, 
Arthralgia, Arthritis, Paresthesia, Radiculoneuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, Febrile 
convulsion, Rash, Urticaria, Cellulitis-like reactions, and Increased serum C-reactive protein. In 
the clinical trials of PREVNAR® [ADDRESS_1227123] common solicited local reactions were pain (69-
88%), limitation of arm movement (24-41%), swelling (10-22%), and redness (12-20%).  The most 
common systemic adverse experiences were generalized new muscle pain (47-62%), generalized 
aggravated muscle pain (16-32%), generalized new joint pain (16-32%), generalized aggravated

shortness of breath and diaphoresis. The frequency of these side effects is not defined. 
Diphenhydramine injection can be associated with low blood pressure, arrhythmia, confusion, 
dizziness, sedation, restlessness, diarrhea, nausea and urinary retention. The frequency of these 
side effects is also not defined. 
Subjects are allowed to use acetaminophen or NSAIDs if they experience a moderate to severe 
local or systemic side effects after vaccine administration. 
1.[ADDRESS_1227124](s)/Intervention(s) 
Participants will have the benefit of receiving a licensed pneumococcal vaccine which may offer 
protection against pneumococcal disease. Also the knowledge gained from this study could 
facilitate the design of more effective pneumococcal vaccines for the geriatric population.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 2. OBJECTIVES 
PCV13 induces better functional immune responses when compared to PPV23 in older naïve 
adults. We hypothesize that this is due to intrinsic defects in innate responses that could explain 
the poor immunogenicity of PPV23 when compared to PCV13. Therefore, we propose to 
extensively study innate and adaptive immune responses generated after administration of 
either pneumococcal polysaccharide or conjugate vaccines in older adults.  
2.1 Primary Objective(s) 
To analyze the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with  the magnitude of the 
adaptive immune responses (opsonophagocytosis [OPA ] titers)  at day 30 in order to identify 
the correlation signatures of the innate immune responses to PPV23 and PCV13. 
2.2  Secondary Objective(s) 
To analyze the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with the persistence and the 
quality of the adaptive immune responses determined by [CONTACT_878348]23 and 
PCV13. 
2.3 Exploratory Objective(s) 
To compare the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with the magnitude of the 
adaptive immune responses (opsonophagocytosis [OPA] titers) in elderly and the young in the 
different age strata . 
To compare the generic innate immune signatures that correlate with the persistence and the 
quality of the adaptive immune responses as determined by [CONTACT_85801] B cells, plasmablasts and 
monoclonal antibodies to PPV23 and PCV13.

Study volunteers will be recruited from the general population of metropolitan Atlanta. The 
study will be conducted at the Hope Clinic of the Emory Vaccine Center (Decatur, GA). The

The Emory Investigational Drug Service will purchase PNEUMOVAX® 23 from its 
manufacturer ([COMPANY_006], Whitehouse Station, NJ) and PREVNAR®13 from its manufacturer 
([COMPANY_007], [LOCATION_001], NY) or their distributors. The Emory Investigational Drug Service will store 
the vaccines and will monitor temperatures of refrigerator containing the vaccines. 
Refer to section 1.6, and applicable product labeling for known and potential risks to human 
participants associated with the investigational product(s) intervention(s). 
5.2 Formulation, Packaging, and Labeling 
PNEUMOVAX® 23 (Pneumococcal Vaccine Polyvalent) is a sterile, liquid vaccine for 
intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. It consists of a mixture of highly purified capsular 
polysaccharides from the [ADDRESS_1227140] frequently cause invasive drug-resistant 
pneumococcal infections among children and adults in the [LOCATION_002].  
 
 
PNEUMOVAX 23 is manufactured according to methods developed by [CONTACT_878351]. Each 0.5 mL dose of vaccine contains 25 micrograms of each polysaccharide type 
in isotonic saline solution containing 0.25% phenol as a preservative. 
PNEUMOVAX 23 will be supplied as a single-dose vial of liquid vaccine. 
PREVNAR 13®, Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine (Diphtheria CRM197 Protein) is a 
sterile suspension of saccharides of the capsular antigens of Streptococcus pneumonia  serotypes 1, 
3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, individually linked to nontoxic diphtheria 
CRM197 protein. Each serotype is grown in soy peptone broth. The individual polysaccharides 
HIPC: VAX-003 CONFIDENTIAL Page 36 of 80 
  
Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 are purified through centrifugation, precipi[INVESTIGATOR_332], ultrafiltration, and column chromatography. 
The polysaccharides are chemically activated to make saccharides, which are directly 
conjugated by [CONTACT_878352]197, to form the glycoconjugate.  
The individual glycoconjugates are compounded to formulate Prevnar®13. Potency of the 
formulated vaccine is determined by [CONTACT_878353]. Each 0.5 mL dose of the 
vaccine is formulated to contain appr oximately 2.2 μg of each of Streptococcus pneumoniae  
serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F saccharides, 4.4 μg of 6B saccharides, 34 μg 
CRM197 carrier protein, 100 μg polysorbate 80, 295 μg succinate buffer and 125 μg aluminum as 
aluminum phosphate adjuvant.

7.1 Enrollment and Randomization 
This research study will be explained in lay terms to each potential research participant. The 
potential participant will sign an informed consent form before undergoing any study 
procedures. Participants who are deemed eligible for the study (see sections 4.1 and 4.2) will be 
enrolled and assigned a unique participant number. Approximately eighteen months are 
needed for enrollment. The duration of participation for each subject is approximately 6 
months. An additional optional blood draw will be offered 2-3.5 years after enrollment. 
Eighty 
eight subjects ( 22 subjects (ages 25-40) and 66 subjects ( ages 60-89)) will be randomized 
to receive PPV23 or PCV13 in a 1:1 ratio. 
7.2 Screening Visit(s) 
Refer to 7.3  
7.3 Baseline Visit(s) 
Interested subjects will call recruiters for a telephone screening where the eligibility criteria of 
the subject will be reviewed. To confirm that participant has never received pneumococcal 
vaccine in the past, vaccination records may be requested from participant’s physician after 
obtaining a release of information from the participant. If the subject is found to be eligible and 
continues to be interested in participating after reading the informed consent (emailed or 
mailed to him/her), an appointment will be scheduled.  
Study staff will review with the subject the study informed consent form and will answer all 
questions related to the study. Once the subject signs the informed consent, a study 
participation number will be assigned and subject will be randomized to receive PPV23 or 
PCV13. The participant will be asked to provide demographic information and information 
related to his/her medical history including current medications and vaccination history to 
verify eligibility . The volunteer’s vital signs will be recorded and a targeted physical exam will 
only be performed if needed based on findings during review of health status. For female 
volunteers of age bearing potential, a urine pregnancy test is obtained. Only females with a 
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227148] are available and shown to be negative. 
The participant will get the pneumococcal Vaccine Information Sheet and then receive 1 dose 
per label of either PNEUMOVAX®23 or PREVNAR®13 according results of randomization.  
Any Adverse Event (including – but not only- vaccine reactions and local or systemic 
Reactogenicity Events) of grade 3 or higher severity or any SAE occurring after vaccination 
while the subjects is still at the clinical site will be recorded and reported. 
The participant will be provided with a written description of what represents a local and 
systemic vaccine reaction of mild, moderate and severe intensity (Refer to Appendix 3 and 
Appendix 4). Subjects will be instructed to notify the study center by [CONTACT_878356] 1 week following vaccination.  
At the end of the visit, the participant will also be instructed to promptly call the site if he/she 
develops any of the following: 
 becomes sick or has been treated at the doctor’s office or emergency department or has 
been hospi[INVESTIGATOR_878320] D180 of the study; 
 develops any adverse event that limits self-care activities of daily living (e.g.  bathing, 
dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bed 
ridden) even if he/she decides not to get medical care; or 
 starts or stops any medications/therapi[INVESTIGATOR_470870]. 
 Becomes pregnant. 
Refer to section 8.2.[ADDRESS_1227149] be recorded and reported. 
Note:  Subjects calling the site for any of the above will receive further instructions on the 
proper course of action, including a return to the clinic for immediate evaluation if appropriate. 
The Baseline visit will last approximately 90 minutes.

 One unexpected SAE related to the vaccination 
 Two unexpected AEs of grade 3 or higher severity of similar nature related to the 
vaccination 
 Study vaccine is recalled by [CONTACT_3455]  
 Occurrence of a case of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, radiculoneuropathy, anaphylactoid 
reaction ,  anaphylaxis  or serum sickness considered related to vaccination  
8.1.2 Individual Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_878321]: 
 Failure to receive a full dose of vaccine. 
8.1.3 Follow-up after early study termination 
Participants who are prematurely terminated from the study due to a related AE/SAE will be 
followed until resolution of the AE or until 30 days after a participant terminates from the 
study, whichever comes later.  
 Note: 
Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to baseline status or as stabilization of the condition 
with the expectation that it will remain chronic. 
8.1.4 Participant Replacement 
Up to the discretion of the PI, participants receiving concomitant medications may still continue 
with scheduled study blood draws. Subjects receiving concomitant medications, along with 
participants with early termination from this study for any reason, may be replaced as needed

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 8.2 Adverse Events 
This section defines the types of adverse events and outlines the procedures for appropriately 
collecting, grading, recording, and reporting them. Information in this section complies with 
ICH Guideline E2A: Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting and  ICH E6: Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applies the standards set forth 
in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
Version 4.0 [Published: May 28, 2009; revised version 4.03; June 14. 2010)] . These criteria have 
been reviewed by [CONTACT_878359]. 
8.2.1 Definitions 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any occurrence or worsening of an undesirable or unintended sign, 
symptom, laboratory finding, or disease that is experienced during participation in the trial. An 
AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporarily 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s), whether 
or not related to the medicinal (investigational) Study Agent(s)/Intervention(s). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Adverse Events Associated with Study Vaccines and Study 
Procedures 
The most common adverse reactions after vaccine administration are fully described in Section 
1.6.1 . 
Adverse events after blood draws may include: 
 Fainting /Vasovagal events 
 Bruising at puncture site larger than 2 cm diameter 
 Bleeding from puncture site lasting more than 30 minutes 
 Swelling at puncture site larger than 2 cm 
 
8.2.2. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) 
An adverse  event or suspected adverse reaction is  considered ‘‘serious ’’ if, in the view of  either 
the investigator or sponsor, it  results in any of the following  outcomes:  
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227154]  normal 
life functions 
 -A congenital  anomaly/birth defect 
Important medical  events that may not result in death, be  life-threatening, or require  
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_708], based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Note: 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life-threatening ’’ if, in the view 
of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate 
risk of death.  
It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death. 
8.2.3. Unexpected Adverse Event or Adverse Reaction 
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected ’’ if it is not listed in 
the product label information of PNEUMOVAX®23 nor PRENAR®13 or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed.  
For
 example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_106117]) if the investigator brochure referred only to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vasculitis would be unexpected (by [CONTACT_131210]) if the investigator brochure listed only cerebral vascular accidents. 
‘‘Unexpected, ’’ as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the product label information as occurring with a class of 
vaccine or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product but are not 
specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227155] developi[INVESTIGATOR_878322]. The study has provisions for a back- up to ensure that 
independent safety monitoring happens at all times during the study. Additional roles and 
responsibilities of the ISM are described in sections 8.2.7 and 8.3 below. 
8.2.5  Collecting, Recording and Managing Adverse Events 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Collecting and reporting Adverse Events 
Adverse events occurring after the subject has signed the consent will be collected and reported 
as follows: 
 Any Adverse Event (including – but not only- vaccine reactions and local or systemic 
Reactogenicity Events) of grade 3 or higher severity or SAE occurring after vaccination 
while the subjects is still at the clinical site. 
 Local REs and systemic REs of grade 3 or higher severity occurring from Day 0 to Day 7 
reported over the telephone by [CONTACT_4538]/or assessed at the clinic. 
 AEs of grade 3 or higher severity throughout D180 of the study (including -but not only 
– AEs linked to blood draws). 
 All SAEs throughout D180.  
Adver
se events may be identified during this study through any of these methods: 
1.  Examination of the participant during study visits.

during the study 
 Note: Not all safety events identified may require recording and reporting 
A complete recording of safety events in the CRF will include event term, date of onset and 
resolution/stabilization, assessment of severity, relationship to study vaccine or 
procedures/intervention(s) such as phlebotomy, expectedness, determination of whether the 
AE qualifies as serious, treatment required, action taken with study participation and outcome. 
AEs qualifying as SAEs also require a narrative of the event. Updates in safety events will be 
recorded as additional information becomes available. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Managing Adverse Events 
 
The site investigator must apply his or her clinical judgment as to whether an AE is of sufficient 
severity to require that the participant immediately be removed from further treatment under 
the protocol. The investigator must institute any necessary medical therapy to protect a 
participant from any immediate dangers.  
Severe related AEs and all SAEs will be followed until they are resolved.  
Participants who are prematurely terminated from the study due to a safety event will be 
followed until resolution of the AE or until 30 days after a participant terminates from the 
study, whichever comes later.  
Note:  
Resolution of an AE is defined as the return to baseline status or as stabilization of the condition 
with the expectation that it will remain chronic.

9.1. Sample Size and Power Calculations 
The study is explorative. Not enough preliminary data exists to support accurate calculation of 
the sample size. However we conducted a sample size analysis based on hypothetical scenarios 
and knowledge of similar studies. Based on previous studies performed at the Hope Clinic and 
the Vaccine Research Trials Center, the rate of subjects that become ineligible during the study 
(i.e. do not meet exclusion/inclusion criteria anymore, lost to follow-ups, unable to have blood 
draws) is between 5 to 10%. Assuming 10% attrition rate, 88 subjects will be recruited and 1:1 
randomized into the two treatment groups, resulting in an expected 80 subjects for data 
analysis. The sample size is on-par with similar studies. In the case that the sample size of 
subjects missing any of the 4 draws required for the primary endpoint [meaning draws at days 
1, 3, 7(+1), and 30 (+7)]    is   higher than 10% of the 88 subjects to be recruited for the study, we 
will recruit extra patients to maintain the target sample size of 80 subjects.  
The randomization process will be detailed in the MOP. At the center of this study is the 
identification of generic innate signatures and finding their correlations with the adaptive 
immune response. The generic innate signatures will be identified from both traditional 
immune parameters measured by [CONTACT_7811]/Luminex assays and array-based gene expression will 
be measured by [CONTACT_878335]. The generic innate signatures will be identified for 
different treatment groups separately.  The traditional immune parameters and array-based 
gene expression that change after immunization are considered generic innate signatures. The 
traditional immune parameters and array-based gene expression  that are correlated with the 
adaptive immune responses (day 30 OPA titers, day 30 IgG levels, day 180 serotype specific 
avidity indexes, plasmablasts also) are considered correlation signatures of the innate immune 
responses.  
Both for sample size consideration and data analysis, we will use different stringency levels for 
the traditional immune parameters and microarray data, because the traditional immune 
parameters are measured with less noise, and a traditional immune parameter is more likely 
than an average gene to be associated with the immune response.

(mean difference/sigma) is 0.66, using a two-sided paired t-test and the alpha level of 0.01.  
For the gene expression, again the innate signatures will be detected in each treatment group 
separately. The actual data analysis will be performed using the method Significance Analysis 
of Microarrays (SAM) with paired design. For sample size consideration, we will consider the 
simpler case of a paired t- test. As the number of genes tested is in the order of tens of 
thousands, we use the alpha level of 0.[ADDRESS_1227161] >100 truly differentially expressed genes. In actual data analysis false discovery rate 
(FDR) will be used. With [ADDRESS_1227162] the null

9.2. Data Analysis 
9.2.1. General considerations 
The young treatment groups are of limited size. The main purpose of the young treatment 
groups is to provide some indication whether the elderly respond to the vaccines differently 
than the young. By [CONTACT_1029], the young groups do not have sufficient statistical power to 
generate reliable innate and correlation signatures. However when used in comparison against 
elderly groups, and by [CONTACT_878361] (collections of genes contributing 
to the same biological process) that are affected by [CONTACT_29500], they can provide some 
indication as to how different the response is in the elderly compared to the young.  Thus for 
data analysis, the young treatment groups will be used only in exploratory endpoints. The 
primary and secondary endpoints will focus on the elderly groups.  
 
The analyses will be based on population with critical time points met, defined as those who 
received vaccine per label and got the 4 draws required for the primary endpoint, i.e. draws at 
days 1, 3, 7 (+1), and 30 (+7)  within the required windows. Data from the study will be 
analyzed using the statistical software R31 .High-throughput data will be analyzed using 
appropriate methods, either by [CONTACT_599999]-alone software or modules in leading statistical softwares, 
e.g. the Bioconductor in the R framework32 .For cytokine data, missing values will be dealt with 
using multiple imputations. For microarray data, nearest neighbor method and local least 
squares may be used to fill missing values. Unsupervised learning techniques such as PCA, 
PLSDA, clustering, and factor analysis 33 will be used for the visualization and identification of 
global patterns. For descriptive endpoint (primary endpoint 2), we will generate summary 
statistics, and visualize the data using histograms and boxplots when applicable. For the 
identification of innate signatures, the two treatment groups will be analyzed separately.

Systems Biology of PPV23 and PCV13                                Version 7.0.March 30, 2017 Analyses of primary endpoints: 
1. Identification of generic innate immune signatures [Traditional immune parameters measurements 
+ array-based gene expression] at days 1, [ADDRESS_1227168]. The average (arithmetic mean) 
fold change over the [ADDRESS_1227169] p-value in a selection criterion as 
appropriate. Based on previous studies similar in nature, the tentative selection criterion is p-
value ≤ 0.01 and average fold change ≥ 3.  
For the gene expression data, again the innate signatures will be detected in each elderly 
treatment group separately. We will use the method Significance Analysis of Microarrays 
(SAM) 34 with paired design to find differentially expressed genes over the baseline. False 
discovery rate (FDR) will be used as selection criterion. The tentative selection criterion is FDR ≤ 
0.1.

The OPA titers will be presented as descriptions of the actual values separately in both study 
elderly populations (PPV23 and PCV13 recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]). Summary statistics, boxplots and 
histograms will be used to summarize the data.    
3. Correlation of signatures of generic innate immune responses at days 1, 3 and 7 that correlate to 
adaptive immune responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay OPA titers] at day [ADDRESS_1227171] vaccination with

The correlation signatures will be detected in each elderly treatment group separately. The 
innate signature [CONTACT_878372]/genes identified in Primary Endpoint 1 will be used in this step for 
the identification of correlation signature.  
For traditional immune parameters, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between the 
immune parameter and the adaptive immune response (day 30 OPA titers). The p-values 
associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional immune parameters

immune parameters, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between the immune 
parameter and the adaptive immune response (IgG levels at day [ADDRESS_1227173] vaccination). The p-
values associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional immune 
parameters that are associated with the respective adaptive immune responses (IgG levels at

immune parameters, we will calculate the correlation coefficient between the immune 
parameter and the adaptive immune response  (serotype specific avidity indexes at day 180 p) 
the p-values associated with the correlation coefficients will be used to select traditional

Analyses of exploratory endpoints 
1. Correlation of signatures of generic innate immune responses at days 1, 3 and 7 with adaptive immune 
responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay OPA titers specifically] at day [ADDRESS_1227179], we will identify innate signatures in each young treatment group, as well as potentially in 
each age stratum of each elderly treatment group. There are a total of potentially 8 groups: 
participants between the ages of 25-40 receiving PPV23, participants between the ages of 25-40 
receiving PCV13, participants between the ages of 60-69 receiving PPV23, participants between 
the ages of 60-69 receiving PCV13, participants between the ages of 70-79 receiving PPV23, 
participants between the ages of 70-79 receiving PCV13, participants between the ages of 80-89 
HIPC: VAX-[ADDRESS_1227180] serotype specific plasmablasts (days 7, 14, 30  (with 
day 30 on a subset of vaccinees only) ) and memory B cells (days 30, 180) post vaccination with either 
PPV23 or PCV13 in the elderly.  
Summary statistics, boxplots and histograms will be used to summarize and visually contrast 
the data. We will use t-test or Wilcoxon test to compare each immune parameter (magnitude, 
kinetics) from D0 to D180 post vaccination between the two treatment groups at the pre-
specified time points for serotype specific plasmablasts (days 7, 14, 30 with day 30 on a subset of

responses [Opsonophagocytosis assay OPA titers and ELISA] at years 2-3.[ADDRESS_1227182] vaccination with either

For correlation analysis, the analysis is similar to primary endpoint 3. Instead of using all th e 
data, we will analyze data in the elderly.  
 
Enriched biological pathways can be identified using each type of signature [CONTACT_878376] (i.e.  elderly (60-89) receiving PPV23, elderly (60-89) receiving 
PCV13, young (25-40) receiving PPV23 and young (25-40) receiving PCV13) ,  using gene 
ontology (computer program that generates biological networks from gene lists). Then the 
enriched pathways can be manually compared between the different treatment groups as per 
#A and #B above. Biological interpretations of the differences will be made.

approaches, and run additional statistical analyses of data generated by [CONTACT_600001], secondary and exploratory endpoints, on an ad 
hoc basis.

The Principal Investigator (or co-PI) will provide the ISM, the NIAID Medical Officer, and the 
IRB with the most up- to-date versions of the above documents as soon as the Principal 
Investigator (or co-PI) becomes aware of any changes. For purchased investigational products, 
the Principal Investigator (or co-PI) will confirm that there are no changes to the package insert

The Principal Investigator (or co-PI) will keep accurate records to ensure that the conduct of the 
study is fully documented.  The investigator will ensure that all CRFs and participant study 
files are legible and complete for every participant. 
When the CRFs are complete, they will be reviewed and signed by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_296240]-PI.  All discrepancies identified by [CONTACT_878362], and any 
resulting queries will be resolved with the Principal Investigator (or co-PI) and the CRFs will be 
amended as needed.  
The Principal Investigator (or co-PI), through the use of an internal Quality management Plan 
and appropriate site quality control and quality assurance monitoring staff will be responsible 
for the regular review of the conduct of the trial, for verifying adherence to the protocol, and for 
confirming the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of all documented data and accuracy of 
source documentation verification.  The reports of the internal site monitor will be submitted to 
the Principal Investigator (or co-PI) and the NIAID Project Manager.  NIAID will review these 
reports. 
As per the clinical monitoring plan, site monitoring will be conducted by [CONTACT_600003] (ICH GCP 5.1.1, 5.2, 5.18.1) and 
the Code of Federal Regulations, as applicable.  The overall objectives of site monitoring visits 
are to ensure: 
1. Site compliance with the current version of the approved protocol, consent, documents 
and local Institutional Review Board requirements. 
2. Accuracy and completeness of data entry. 
3. Required regulatory documents are current and maintained in the protocol-specific 
regulatory binder. 
4. A designated percent of signed consent forms, inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary, 
secondary, and tertiary endpoints, safety monitoring parameters, deviations, and serious 
adverse events are documented.

and documentation of destruction policies. 
6. The research staff is adequately trained with respect to GCP and GLP. 
7. All observed anomalies or protocol deviations are reported and identify an action plan 
to minimize study dropouts and non-compliance with defined study procedure s. 
 
The results of the site monitoring report will be discussed with the PI, the staff and the NIAID 
to ensure compliance with the monitor’s findings.

participation in the study. Prospective participant or subject’s legal  representative must be 
given ample opportunity to review the informed consent and inquire about the results of the 
study. All participants (or their legally acceptable representative) must read, sign, and date a 
consent form prior to study participation. Consent materials for participants who do not speak 
or read English will be translated into the participants’ appropriate language.  
The informed consent form will be revised and receive IRB approval whenever important new 
safety information is available, whenever the protocol is amended, and/or whenever any new 
information becomes available that may affect participation in the trial. 
A copy of the informed consent form will be given to a prospective participant for review. The

PI: [INVESTIGATOR_903870] : February 21, [ADDRESS_1268345]. Gallippi’s laboratory: 1) Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse  ( ARFI) ultrasound for 
interrogating tissue stiffness, 2) Viscoelastic Response (VisR)  ultrasound for assessing tissue elasticity and viscosity, and 3) Dynamic Displacement Anisotropy Imaging (DDAI) for measuring tissue anisotropy.   We hypothesize that ultra sound- derived stiffness, elasticity, viscosity, and 
anisotropy will detect  lesion  malignancy and predict response to treatment. To 
test this  hypothesis, we will pursue the f ollowing specific aims:  
 
Aim #1: Quantify the ability of  ultrasound- derived stiffness, elasticity, 
viscosity, and anisotropy to detect malignancy. ARFI, VisR, and DDAI 
imaging will be performed on suspi[INVESTIGATOR_903871] 40 women with 
BIRADS -4a, 4b, 4c, or -5 ratings. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging metrics 
will analyzed, with  malignan cy confirmed by [CONTACT_903876]. 
 
Aim #2: Quantify the ability of  ultrasound- derived stiffness, elasticity, 
viscosity, and anisotropy to predict a positive response to  treatment. ARFI, 
VisR, and DDAI imaging will b e performed serially over the course of 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) - on malignant breast lesions in 40 women. 
Changes in outcome metrics over time will be correlated to overall reduction in tumor size  (diameter and area ). The ability of ultrasound metr ics to predict a 
positive response to treatment will be examined .  A positive response to treatment 
will be determined according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines .

1.2 Disease Background  (if applicable)  
The primary objective of breast cancer screening is to identify early stage cancer, or precancerous lesions, at a time before symptoms emerge and when treatment is likely to result in a cure. Screening is beneficial when it averts progression of disease to metastasis and/or death, but adverse effects to patients (and unnecessary medical expense) may result downstream from f alse positives and 
indiscrimination of masses that will not respond to treatment. The sensitivity of digital mammography, the current screening standard in the US, has been reported in the range of 0.40 to 0.85,
1 with a positive predictive value of 0.31.2 Sensitivity 
is increased by [CONTACT_903877] B -Mode ultrasound, but 
false positive rates may also increase3. There exists a vital need for a screening 
technology that exhibits high sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection with early identification of unresponsive masses.

5–8 and viscosity9 demonstrated for discriminating 
malignant from benign lesions. Further, tissue anisotropy has been shown to correlate with core biopsy result and tumor grade, with large cancers significantly more anisotropic than small cancers.
10 Importantly, while both MRI and 
ultrasound can be used to measure these biomarkers, ultrasound’s cost effectiveness and ease of implementation render it an efficient platform to pursue.
 
1.[ADDRESS_1268347] response to 
treatment.   Tissue property measures will be made using Acoustic Radiation 
Force Impulse (ARFI), Viscoelastic Response (VisR), and Dynamic Displacemen t 
Anisotropy Imaging (DDAI), which are described below:  
 
Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) Imaging for Assessing Tissue 
Stiffness: In ARFI imaging, the ultrasound transducer delivers an impulsive ARF 
excitation to the tissue near the position of the imaging focus, and, using the same 
transducer, the induced tissue displacement is monitored over time. Then, parametric images of ARFI -induced peak displacement (PD) are rendered to 
convey information regarding the relative stiffness of tissue, i.e. stiffe r tissues 
achieve PDs that are smaller than those of softer tissues in response to a consistent ARF magnitude.
11–14  ARFI PD has been used by [CONTACT_903878]. Fibrous cap 
thick ness measurement ≥ 0.5 mm has been demonstrated to be within 10% error 
of histological ly derived measurements. This, and previous work by [CONTACT_2312],15–[ADDRESS_1268348] that will be relevant for detecting necrotic cores, which could aid in discriminating malignant lesions and masses that do not respond to treatment.   
Viscoelastic Response (VisR)  Ultrasound for Assessing Tissue  Elasticity and 
Viscosity: Unlike ARFI, which primarily assesses tissue  stiffness, VisR uses 
successive ARF excitations to interrogate tissue  viscoelasticity.
22–24  ViSR has 
been used to study muscle degeneration in boys with Duchen ne Muscle 
Dystrophy .  The ViSR measurements provided information on the changes in 
viscos ity and elasticity of these muscles  and were concordant with inflections in 
matched physical and quantitative muscle testing (QMT) r esults . The VisR results 
are also consistent with expected cycles of dystrophic degeneration. These data 
support that VisR will similarly be relevant to assessing viscous and elastic properties in the breast, which have been shown to be relevant to discriminating malignant from benign breast lesions
5,6,8,9,25 –27 and may be useful for 
distinguishing responsive from unresponsive masses.

3 Dynamic Displacement Anisotropy Imaging (DDAI) for Measuring Tissue 
Anisotropy: Anisotropic tissue exhibits mechanical properties that are 
directionally dependent, i.e. the viscous and/or elastic properties of the material vary between one direction and another, and the degree of difference is referred to as the “degree of anisotropy.”
[ADDRESS_1268349] an asymmetrical shape.29 For example, in a 
transversely isotropi c (TI) material, ARFI -induced PDs and VisR τ  values are 
larger when the long axis of the asymmetrical ARF is aligned along versus across the material’s axis  of symmetry (AoS). The ratio of induced PDs or τ values along 
versus across the AoS reflects the degree of  anisotropy in the material. We have 
developed DDAI imaging using finite element method (FEM) simulations. These data suggest that DDAI imaging will differentiate  breast lesions with anisotropic 
properties and/or AoS orientations that differ from th ose of the background breast 
tissue. Previous work suggests that DDAI -derived anisotropy  information will 
correlate with breast core biopsy result, tumor grade, and tumor size
10,30 and may 
be useful for differentiating malignant from benign lesions and r esponsive from 
unresponsive masses.  We will correlate ultrasound -derived stiffness, elasticity, viscosity, and anisotropy 
with response to treatment (Aim #2 ). Please see data analysis plans below for 
more information.

The ARFI, VisR, and DDAI imaging location will be on the surface of the breast, above the suspi[INVESTIGATOR_903872]. This unblinded, open-label, exploratory study will be conducted in [ADDRESS_1268351] assessment categories of -4a, 4b, 4c,  or -5 masses in Aim #1 and in 40 women with malignant masses undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in Aim #2. In Aim #1, patients will be recruited from those who have undergone breast imaging and are indicated for biopsy according to the routine standard of care at UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Both diagnostic imaging and biopsy will be performed according to institutional standards and will not be altered for research purposes. In addition to standard radiologic examinations, the patients will undergo ARFI, VisR, and DDAI ultrasound imaging after BIRADS diagnosis but prior to biopsy. In Aim #2, patients will be recruited from those already undergoing NAC for treatment of breast cancer according to the standard of care at UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. NAC will be performed based on institutional standards and will not be altered for research purposes, except that we will perform serial ultrasound imaging over the course of treatment. The standard for clinical management during and after NAC will not be altered.  
 We will enroll participants in two groups, as patients with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] (Aim #1) breast lesions, or as patients with confirmed breast cancer undergoing clinically

stabilized by [CONTACT_903879], and ARFI and VisR data will be acquired in the new transducer position to ena ble DDAI 
analysis. Finally, the evaluated mass will undergo clinically indicated biopsy with histological evaluation to determine if it is benign or malignant.  
 The ultrasound data will be processed to calculate the following outcome metrics: peak displacement (PD),  displacement at a given time (TD) for ARFI; τ , relative 
elasticity (RE), relative v iscosity (RV), and tissue mass (TM) for VisR; ratio of 
ARFI PD and ratio of VisR RE values at 90

3.0 PATIENT ELIGIBILITY  
In Aim #1, patients will be recruited from those who have undergone breast 
imaging and are indicated for biopsy according to the routine standard of care at UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Both diagnostic imaging and biopsy will be performed according to institutional stan dards and will not be altered for research purposes. In addition 
to standard radiologic examinations, the patients will undergo ARFI, VisR, and DDAI ultrasound imaging prior to standard of care biopsy..  In Aim #2, patients will be recruited from those alr eady undergoing NAC for 
treatment of breast cancer according to the standard of care at UNC Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. NAC will be performed based on institutional standards and will not be altered for research purposes, except that we will perform serial ultrasound imagi ng over the 
course of treatment. The standard for clinical management during and after NAC will not be altered.  
 Potential study participants will be patients 30-[ADDRESS_1268362] lesion (Aim #1) or to be in need of NAC for 
the treatment of breast  cancer (Aim #2). All patients will be recruited from and 
imaged at the University of North Carolina Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600]. Based on local demographics, w e estimate  that roughly 20% will be racial and ethnic minorities. 
Children are not likely to have breast cancer  and will not be included in this study. 
 We will enroll participants in two groups, as patients with suspi[INVESTIGATOR_15665] (Aim #1) breast lesions, or as patients with  confirmed breast cancer undergoing clinically

6.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
6.1 Study Design/Study Endpoints  
For Aims #1 and #2, the ability of ultrasound biomarkers to discriminate binary outcomes (malignant/bengin and responsive/unrespsonsive to treatment) will be analyzed using logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) will be quantified, with separate models fit for each of the eight ultrasound biomarkers. Because most ultrasound biomarkers are continuous measures, the best -balanced cutpoints optimizing sensitivity and 
specificity will be calculated, using Youden’s Index. Outcome discrimination by [CONTACT_903882] 28 separate models with combinations of any two ultrasound biomarkers. The combined benefit of ultrasound and mammography will be analyzed in 32 models, by [CONTACT_1583] a single mammography metric (lesion size, density, shape, or margins) to each of the eight ultrasound biomarker models. In Aim #2, the relationship between biomarker values and tumor size, biomarker values and change in tumor size, and change in biomarker values and change in tumor size will be analyzed by [CONTACT_142031]. These correlations will be analyzed in separate models for each of the eight ultrasound biomarkers, in models of dual ultrasound biomarkers, and in models combining mammography metrics with ultrasound biomarkers.   
6.[ADDRESS_1268378] 80% power to detect a minimum AUC of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.51 – 0.89). This is consistent with the diagnostic accuracy previously reported for malignancy detection by [CONTACT_903883], which have ranged from AUC values of 0.67 to 0.99.

6.3 Data Analysis Plans  
 
6.3.1 Aim #1: Correlat e ultrasound-derived stiffness, elasticity, viscosity, and 
anisotropy to malignancy.   
In vivo ARFI, VisR, and DDAI imaging will be performed in [ADDRESS_1268379], to avoid pre-compression during imaging.

depth, with standoff used if needed to achieve the desired axial position. Second, 
LCCC 1745  CONFIDENTIAL  
PI: [INVESTIGATOR_903870] : February 21, [ADDRESS_1268380], ARFI and VisR data will be acquired in immediate succession. Fourth, the transducer will be rotated 90
o, re-
stabilized by [CONTACT_903884] e stereotactic clamp, and ARFI and 
VisR data will be acquired in the new transducer position to enable DDAI analysis. Finally, the evaluated mass will undergo clinically indicated biopsy with histological evaluation to determine if it is benign or malignan t.  
 The ultrasound data will be processed to calculate the following outcome metrics: peak displacement (PD), displacement at a given time (TD) for ARFI; τ, relative elasticity (RE), relative viscosity (RV), and tissue mass (TM) for VisR; ratio of ARFI PD  and ratio of VisR  RE values at 90
o versus 0o transducer orientations for 
DDAI. These eight outcome metrics, alone and in combinations, will be statistically correlated with biopsy finding of malignant or benign . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Which of the [ADDRESS_1268381] detects malignancy?  
The diagnostic accuracy of each ultrasound metric will be analyzed by [CONTACT_903885] (ROC) curves.  
[IP_ADDRESS] What is the combined diagnostic accuracy of any 2 ultrasound metrics?  
The incremental value of usi ng a second ultrasound metric will be analyzed by 
[CONTACT_903886] 2 ultrasound metrics. 
[IP_ADDRESS] What is the combined diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound metrics and mammography?  
We will select ultrasound metrics with an AUC exceeding 0.75 in C.1.a- b, and 
their combined diagnostic accuracy with mammography measures (mass size, density, shape, and margins) will be analyzed in separate ROC curves.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Which cutpoints for ultrasound metrics detect malignancy with optimum sensitivity and specificity?  
Best-balanced cutpoints from the highest performing ultrasound metrics in [IP_ADDRESS] 
will be derived from ROC curves, using Youden’s Index. These cutpoints will be used to analyze the PPV.  
6.3.2 Aim #2: Correlate ultrasound -derived stiffness, elas ticity, viscosity, and 
anisotropy with response to treatment.  
In [ADDRESS_1268382] cancer who are scheduled to begin clinically indicated NAC, ARFI, VisR, and DDAI imaging will be performed (as described in Aim #1) at baseline,  early within each chemotherapy 
type, and at the conclusion of each chemotherapy type over the course of treatment.

17 [IP_ADDRESS] Which baseline ultrasound metric best predicts positive response to NAC ?  
Response to NAC will be dichotomized into a yes/no  response according to the 
RECIST guidelines , and the predictive ability of each baseline ultrasound metric 
will be analyzed by [CONTACT_903887].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Which baseline ultrasound metric correlates most strongly with absolute 
reduction in tumor size (diamet er, area, volume)?  
The relationship between ultrasound metric values at baseline and absolute change in tumor size from baseline to end of chemotherapy type will be visualized by [CONTACT_903888]. If the relationship appears linear and monotonic, the correlat ion will be assessed by [CONTACT_903889].  
[IP_ADDRESS] What is the combined ability of any 2 baseline ultrasound metrics for prediction of positive response to  NAC?  
With response to NAC dichotomized into a yes/no response, the combined predictive ability will be an alyzed by [CONTACT_903890] 2 ultrasound metrics.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Do serial changes in ultrasound metrics correlate with reduction in tumor size following NAC?  
The relationships between serial changes in ultrasound metrics and tumor size will be visualized by [CONTACT_903888]. If monotonic and linear, the correlation between serial change in ultrasound metrics and change in tumor size (area) will be analyzed  by [CONTACT_903889]. Assessments of serial change will be made at 3 
intervals  per chemotherapy type: baseline, early chemotherapy type treatment, 
and end of chemotherapy type treatment .  
[IP_ADDRESS] Serial change in which of the [ADDRESS_1268383] predicts positive response to NAC ?  
Response to NAC will be dichotomized into a yes/no response, and the predictive ability of serial change in each ultrasound metric from 0 -6 weeks will be analyzed 
by [CONTACT_903887].  
[IP_ADDRESS] Do combinations of changes over time in any ultrasound outcome metrics correlate with reduction in tumor size following NAC?  
Assuming linear relationships exists between serial change in ultrasound metrics and serial change in tumor size following NAC, multiple linear regression models will be constructed for each of the 8 ultrasound metrics. The model outcome wi ll 
be change in tumor size, and model predictors will be serial change in any 2 ultrasound metrics.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Which combinations of serial change for any [ADDRESS_1268384] predicts positive response to NAC ?

[IP_ADDRESS] What is the combined perfor mance of ultrasound metrics and 
mammography for predicting a reduction in tumor size following NAC?  
Reduction in tumor size will be dichotomized into a yes/no response. We will select ultrasound metrics with  an AUC exceeding 0.75 in [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], [IP_ADDRESS], 
and [IP_ADDRESS], and their combined diagnostic accuracy with mammography measures (mass size, density, shape, and margins) will be analyzed in separate ROC curves.   
[IP_ADDRESS] What are the sensitivity, specificity and PPV of ultrasound outcome metrics for identifying masses that positively respond to treatment?   
Best-balanced cutpoints from the highest performing ultrasound metrics in [IP_ADDRESS] 
and [IP_ADDRESS] will be derived from ROC curves, using Youden’s Index. These cutpoints will be used to analyze the PPV of positive response to NAC 
(dichotomized as a yes/no variable).

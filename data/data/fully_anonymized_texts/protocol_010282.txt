Section C:   Background Information   
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the signature [CONTACT_159165] (OIF/OEF). Among those with a mild TBI (mTBI) 
diagnosis, the majority also suffer from stress -based psychopathology including depression, 
post-traumatic stress disorder, and other anxiet y disorders, as well as persistent pain. Poor 
management of multiple conditions results in increased morbidity and mortality, increased 
risk for suicide and significantly decreased quality of life. Importantly, the association 
between seeking mental health  care and stigma among veterans is frequent. Veterans are 
often unwilling to seek mental health services due to conerns that receiving such care would 
negatively impact their careers and the belief that they should be able to overcome 
psychological difficu ltires on their won. Furthermore, availability of speciality services is 
limited for those veterans living in rural settings. Thus the challenge for treatment providers 
is to provide a unified, efficient, accessible, and acceptable intervention for Veteran s with 
these interdependent systemic comorbid concerns.  
 
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a trans -diagnostic behavioral intervention aimed at 
helpi[INVESTIGATOR_159138]'s challenges. Its 
unified model o f behavior change has shown promise in treating depression, anxiety, and 
chronic medical conditions. Importantly, ACT has been effectively implemented in various 
treatment -delivery formats, including 1- day workshops. This flexibility in delivery format 
allows focus to be placed on how best to package and deliver the intervention to meet the 
needs of this Veteran patient population, to ensure treatment adherence, and also to increase 
chances of dissemination into clinical settings. Providing a [ADDRESS_184835] "wor kshop" for 
veterans with mTBI, pain, and mental health problems will allow unitary comprehensive 
care for the range of emotional, physical, and cognitive symptoms experienced by [CONTACT_159154]. Presenting the treatment as a "workshop" rather than "therapy"  will also be better 
suited for the veterans who may not be explicitly seeking specialized mental health care. 
Finally, a [ADDRESS_184836] obstacle to effective delivery of m ental health services.  
 
 
  
Section D:   Purpose and Objectives   
      The aims of this study are to 1) develop a 1 -day (6 hour) "ACT on Life" workshop tailored 
specifically for veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), stress -based 
psychopathology, and pain; expert input from a multi -disciplinary team of a clinical 
psychologist, neuropsychiatrist, cognitive psychologist, and anthropologist will be utilized to 
produce the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_159139]; 2) enroll 10 veterans with mTBI, 
stress -based psychopathology, and pain in the "ACT on Life" workshop in order to obtain 
qualitative and quantitative feedback from veterans about the intervention; and utilize 
Veteran feedback to refine the tr eatment procedures and manuals; and 3) pi[INVESTIGATOR_159140] 
"ACT on Life" workshop in a new sample of 30 veterans with mTBI, stress -based 
psychopathology, and pain in order to examine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention 
on quality of life and functio ning, stress -based symptoms of psychopathology, and pain.

Section F:   Design/Procedure  
F1.  Design  
Select one category that most adequately describes your research:  
      c) Pi[INVESTIGATOR_159141]: probability of group 
assignment, potential for subject to be randomized to placebo group, use of control subjects, 
etc. 
      Advertising/Recruitment: Potentially eligible Veterans will be identified through the 
following means: 1)Posters will be placed in MEDVAMC, and will contain the PI's 
telephone number for eit her a phone or in person screening. 2) Brochures will also be 
handed out by [CONTACT_159155]. These brochures will also have the PI's 
telephone number for a phone or in person screening. 3) Specific recruitment will be 
targeted in the TBI clin ic at MEDVAMC via posters, brochures, and faculty/staff and will 
contain information for screening. 4) Recruitment materials (flyers, brochures etc.) will be 
provided to local Veterans' community organizations and college campuses for distribution. 
5) Recr uitment flyers will be posted on social media pages of different veteran organizations 
and other community social media pages.  
 
Screening: Once a patient has expressed interest in the study, he/she will undergo a brief in -
person or phone screening prior to  the first consent. During the screening process, the 
Veteran will be asked questions related to his age, OEF/OIF/OND status, and whether he/she 
has a history of mild TBI, any chronic pain difficulties, and a current level of distress (see 
attachment for s creening). The research team member may answer any questions and 
describe the study to the participant as needed. If participant meets screening eligibility, 
he/she will be told briefly about the study and will be told that he/she can review the consent 
in detail during an in -person meeting.  
 
Initial Assessment: At the beginning of the initial assessment, a team member will go over 
the consent and answer any questions the patient has regarding the study. If interested, the 
patient will sign the consent for ms and study procedures will begin. The Veteran will 
undergo a clinical interview and complete self -report measures. This clinical interview will 
be used to confirm the presence of mTBI, significant distress, and pain. Those who are 
eligible will be invite d to the treatment phase.  
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 1: The first 10 Veterans will be invited to participate in a one -day workshop focused on 
teaching copi[INVESTIGATOR_25110]. These 10 Veterans will also complete 2, 6, 12 week follow -up 
assessments and will provide feedback about the w orkshops. 
 
Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] 2. For the second pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268], all following Veterans who are eligible will be randomized at a 
2:1 ratio to either the workshop group or treatment as usual group (TAU). These Veterans 
will also complete 2, 6, [ADDRESS_184837].  
 
 
Inclusion Criteria:  
      1) 18 -60 years of age, 2) Clinically significant psychological distress as operationalized by a 
diagnosis of major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or PTSD, 3) Life time 
history of Mild TBI; 4) Presence in medical chart of chronic pain including headache, 
musculoskeletal pain or neuropathic pain; 5) Stable dose of psychiatric medications for the 
past 4 weeks.  
 
 
Exclusion Criteria:  
      1) History of primary psychotic disorder (e.g., schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder); 2) a 
diagnosis of substance dependence in the year prior to enrollment in the study; 3) Active 
suicidal ideation; 4) Homicidal ideation.  
 
 
F2.  Procedure  
 
      Participants who are interested in the study will complete a brief (5 minute) screening (see 
attachment) either in -person or over the phone. This takes place even prior to consent. If 
screening criteria are met, the patient will be invited to the clinic for an in -person 
assessment/interview phase. At the beginning of the in -person visit, the consent document 
will be reviewed with the patient and all questions pertaining to the study will be answered. 
If the p atient is interested in the study, he/she will sign the consent and complete an 
assessment. The initial assessment will take approximately 3 hours to complete.  
 
The following measures will then be completed:  
 
Clinical Interviews. The Structured Clinical Interview for DSM -IV Axis I Disorders (SCID -
IV) will be used to assess major DSM -IV Axis I diagnoses, including mood disorders, 
anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric disorders; the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale 
(CAPS), the gold standard in PTSD asse ssment, will be used to make a current, post -
deployment, and/or lifetime diagnosis of PTSD.The [LOCATION_011] Assessment of TBI -Lifetime 
(BAT -L) will be used to determine history of blast exposure and subsequent blast -related 
TBI. 
 
At baseline, pattern separation task will also be completed where participants will be shown 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_159142], new, or similar which 
provides an assessment of memory performance. The delay between first presentation and 
repeated pre sentation of a lure or repeated image will vary. Images remained on the screen 
for 2 seconds, followed by a 500 millisec inter -stimulus interval. Participants will view a 
total of 324 images.

the patient will be invited to attend a workshop called ACT on Life based on Acceptance 
and Commitment T raining (ACT). [ADDRESS_184838] on Life Workshop.  
 
Workshop: Patients in the ACT condition will attend a [ADDRESS_184839] or advanced doctoral 
student. The intervention includes: 1) Behavioral Change Training (2 hours) involving a) 
teaching patients how to recognize ineffective patterns of behavior and habits, b) exploring 
and setting life goals and goals related to mental and physical health, and c) promoting 
effective and committed actions to achieve these goals despi[INVESTIGATOR_159144]; 2) 
Mindfulness and Acceptance Training (2 hours) emphasizing new ways of managin g 
troubling thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations (e.g., learning how to recognize, and 
develop cognitive distance from unhelpful thoughts such as ¿I can¿t take this pain anymore¿ 
or ¿I am not good enough¿) and learning how to face willingly experien ces that cannot be 
changed; and 3) Education about PTSD, TBI, and chronic pain conditions (2 hours).  
 
A total of [ADDRESS_184840] workshop or treatment as usual condition (TAU). 
The ACT workshop will be similar to that described above but will incorporate feedback 
from Veteran who completed Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2268] [ADDRESS_184841] 3 -4 weeks following the workshop. 
During the phone call, we will ask participants if they are using the strategies taught, 
troubleshoot difficulties, and review some of the main concepts taught in the workshop. The 
booster session interview guide is attached.  
 
Follow -up: At [ADDRESS_184842] and Treatment as Usual (TAU) groups will complete assessments over the ph one or in-
person.

Section G:   Sample Size/Data Analysis  
G1.  Sample Size  
How many subjects (or specimens, or charts) will be used in this study?  
      Local: 80               Worldwide: 80  
 
 
Please indicate why you chose the sample size proposed:  
      80 Veterans with mTBI, stress -based psychopathology, and pain will be enrolled in this 
research study.  
 
Initially, ten Veterans will be enrolled in the ¿ACT on Life¿ workshop and the PI [INVESTIGATOR_159147] b e adapted and refined to meet the unique 
needs of OIF/OEF/OND Veterans with these comorbid conditions; all remaining eligible and 
interested Veterans will be randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to the refined ¿ACT on Life¿ 
workshop or TAU in order to obtain preli minary data on the efficacy of this workshop on 
quality of life, functioning, distress, and pain interference.  
 
Recruitment feasibility of approximately 4 subjects per month over the study period and 
budgetary restrictions were the main considerations for  sample size determination. This 
study has adequate (i.e., 80%) power to detect at least Cohen¿s ds > 1 (i.e., large effect sizes) 
at a 5% significance level. Previous research has established that, when compared with 
TAU, ACT interventions have clinically  relevant moderate effect sizes (i.e., smaller than the 
effects this study is powered to detect). Thus, this study is underpowered to show clinically 
meaningful efficacy of ACT when compared to TAU. However, this is not an issue given the 
pi[INVESTIGATOR_159148] t his RCT. This pi[INVESTIGATOR_159149] a larger well-
powered RCT. For instance, this pi[INVESTIGATOR_159150], 
participants¿ randomization willingness and follow -up retention rates estimates are as 
anticipated and can be applied in the planning of a larger RCT in this population for which 
ACT will be developed for the first time in Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal.  
 
 
G2.  Data Analysis  
Provide a description of your plan for data analysis. State the types of comparisons you plan 
(e.g. comparison of means, comparison of proportions, regressions, analysis of variance). 
Which is the PRIMARY comparison/analysis? How will the analyses proposed relate to the 
primary purposes of your study?  
      Freque ncy data will be gathered on the number of veterans screened for participation and the 
number willing to participate in the study, the number of Veterans who are not eligible to 
participate and the reasons for lack of eligibility will also be tracked to id entify the 
proportion of Veterans who may have difficulties and may be in need of an intervention.  
 
We hypothesize that at 3 -month follow -up, Veterans randomized to ¿ACT on Life¿ will 
experience greater improvements in Quality of life (WHO -QOL), functioni ng (WHODAS -
II), distress (DASS -21), and pain- interference (BPI) compared to the TAU group. Data 
collected at baseline, [ADDRESS_184843] will be compared between the groups using a generalized  linear mixed 
model (GLMM) that can accommodate repeated measures over time and missing data due to 
loss to follow -up or missed interviews. Based on our previous experience with this 
population and the high retention rates for [ADDRESS_184844] trials, we anticipa te a 10% loss -to-
follow -up rate at the 12 -week evaluation. The GLMM model for each outcome will include 
group, week (continuous outcome) and group by [CONTACT_159156]. The 
influence of key demographic variables (e.g., age, rural/urban, ge nder) on the outcomes of 
interest will also be explored by [CONTACT_159157].  
 
Co-I Martin will train the research assistant in qualitative data analysis techniques. [CONTACT_159166] and the research assistant will comple te an initial reading of the transcripts and 
develop a codebook containing inductive codes (i.e. codes that emerge out of participants¿ 
experiences) and deductive (i.e. a priori) codes based on the literature and ACT domains 
(e.g. acceptance, values, and c ommitted action). Analysts will code the data using the 
Atlas.ti (v.7) software. Using a process of negotiated consensus, analysts will meet regularly 
to compare coding results, resolve discrepancies, refine the codebook and resulting themes. 
To optimize t he validity of our findings, [CONTACT_159167] will independently review the results and 
meet regularly with analysts to provide expert feedback on the codebook development and 
final themes. Qualitative feedback from the Veterans will enable the PI [INVESTIGATOR_159151] -Is 
Jorge, McGlinchey, and Martin to refine the ACT intervention to be more Veteran -centric 
(Aim 2.b).  
 
 
  
Section H:   Potential Risks/Discomforts  
H1.  Potential Risks/Discomforts  
Describe and assess any potential risks/discomforts; (physical, psychological, social, legal, or 
other) and assess the likelihood and seriousness of such risks:  
      Risks associated with assessment phase: Clinical interviews and self -report assessments 
contain questions regarding sensitive personal information. As a result, participants may be 
embarrassed or distressed when discussing current or past difficult life events. Patients may 
also experience fatigue from completing interviews/questionnaires and physical strain of 
making the movemen ts involved in pressing the buttons or moving a mouse for the pattern 
separation task.  
 
Risks associated with the treatment phase: Patients may experience fatigue from a day -long 
intervention. Patients may feel uncomfortable being in a group with other pat ients. Patients 
may feel distress at addressing their difficulties.  
 
To minimize risks associated with completing questionnaires, patients will be told that they 
do not have to answer any question that they do not want to. They will also be reminded of 
their right to discontinue participation at any time during the study.  
 
To physical strain for the pattern separation task will be minimal and equal to or less than 
that associated with a brief period of playing an average, commercial video game.  
 
In order t o minimize fatigue associated with a day -long group treatment intervention, several 
breaks will be given throughout the day and food/drink will be provided. In order to 
minimize discomfort with being in a group treatment, patients will be reminded of the 
importance of confidentiality. Patients will also be reminded that they can disclose as little 
or as much information as they find comfortable. All participants will be encouraged to use 
only first names in the group for confidentiality purposes. Finally, p atients will be able to 
discontinue the treatment at any time.  
 
 
H2.  Data and safety monitoring plan  
     Do the study activities impart greater than minimal risk to subjects?  
           No 
 
 
H3.  Coordination of information among sites for multi -site research  
Is the BCM Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_53770] -INVESTIGATOR for this multi -site 
research?  
           No or Not Applicable  
 
 
Is BCM the COORDINATING CENTER for this multi -site research?  
           No or Not Applicable  
 
 
  
Section I:   Potential Benefits  
Describe potential benefit(s) to be gained by [CONTACT_30435] a result of participating in 
the planned work.  
      We do not know if subjects will benefit from being in this study. However, we hope that 
some patients will experience some relief from psychological distress symptoms or 
improved quality of life following the study protocol.  
 
 
Describe potential benefit(s) to society of the planned work.  
      TBI is the most common injury reported among veterans of OIF/OEF. Mild TBI and its 
associated conditions hamper the well being of returned veterans. Effective treatments are 
needed to improve the quality of life and functioning of these veterans. Results f rom a 
number of studies shows the effects of a [ADDRESS_184845] -effectively than weekly psychotherapy to a larger group of 
patients.  
 
 
Do anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks? Discuss the risk -to-benefit ratio.  
      This protocol has a favorable risk -benefit ratio because patients will be taught new skills to 
manage distress and pain and will be given the opportunity to talk about their general 
functioning with a trained member of the study team. The potential risks o f the study are 
minimal.  
 
 
  
Section J:   Consent Procedures  
J1.  Waiver of Consent  
Will any portion of this research require a waiver of consent and authorization?  
      Yes 
 
 
Please describe the portion of the research for which a waiver is required. (Example: chart 
review to determine subject eligibility)  
      A waiver of consent is required to review the records to determine their eligibility for the 
study. The purpose of collecting information covered under [ADDRESS_184846] in any report of such research.  
 
 
Explain why the research and the use or disclosure of protected health information involves no 
more than minimal risk (including privacy risks) to the individuals.  
      The probability of harm does not exceed what one might expect from daily life or from 
similar situations. Only the research team will be ac cessing the health records and nothing 
will be printed, removed, altered, or extracted from the patient's files.  
 
 
Explain why the waiver will not adversely affect the privacy rights and the welfare of the 
research subjects.  
      The PHI access will only be used to determine patient's eligibility for the study and will not 
be shared outside of the research team. Patient's records will not be altered in any way, 
therefore there is no change to their healthcare welfare.  
 
 
Explain why the research could not practicably be conducted without the waiver and could not 
practicably be conducted without access to and use of the protected health information.  
      It is a necessary tool to ensure that patient's qualify for the stud y. Oftentimes, patient's

  3 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE   
 
In this study, we will pi[INVESTIGATOR_653888] (integrated mindfulness -based stress reduction and diabetes 
self- management education) in a small group of participants to assess acceptability, feasibility, and 
preliminary efficacy.  
 
1.4 BACKGROUND   
 Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease that is especially common in the Southeastern [LOCATION_002], affecting 14% of adults in Alabama. Low -income and racial/ethnic minority adults are disproportionately 
affected by [CONTACT_24975] [ADDRESS_877362] this intervention in a small group of participants to assess acceptability and feasibility.  
 
1.5 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT    
 
1.5.[ADDRESS_877363] ethical standards. No participant will experience 
a reduction in medical, or any other type of needed service (e.g., social or clinical) that are currently 
available to him/her. Participation may in volve completing a questionnaire, semi -structured interviews, 
or participating in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_295261] (Mindfulness -Based Diabetes Education). Semi -structured 
interviews and focus groups will be audio -recorded, but no unique identifiers will be use d in the 
collection of their responses. No significant risks are anticipated with this portion of the research plan than otherwise experienced in day -to-day living. The participants may experience some discomfort in 
talking about personal health issues, emotional distress, or diabetes management.   Breach of Confidentiality. The main potential risk of this study is breach of confidentiality. This is one of the most common risks of participation in clinical research. Accordingly, our team has designed a 
strategy to protect participant confidentiality. All participants will be informed of study procedures and 
gauged for understanding of study tasks. In addition, study personnel will follow regulatory guidelines 
<Pi[INVESTIGATOR_653885]- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  4 for obtaining informed consent. All interviews and intervention activities will be conducted in a private 
space. For all participants, research data will be stored using a unique participant identification code (sequence number based on entry to the study) instead of names or other personal identifiers. Consent forms with links to participant study numbers will be kept in a locked file cabinet in a locked office with 
the PI ([CONTACT_653912]) or research assistant. According to UAB regulatory policy, records relating to 
research, including informed consent doc uments, shall be securely retained for one year after 
completion of the research. All records shall be accessible for inspection and copying by [CONTACT_380403] a reasonable manner. All electronic study data are kept on UAB secure encrypted password protected servers, and will only be 
available to research personnel for this project. All study personnel will complete HIPAA and human subjects training in accordance with UAB Institutiona l Review Board policy.  
 Emotional Distress . Participants will complete the 17 -item DDS measure after informed consent is 
obtained, which will be scored by [CONTACT_653898]. Additionally, measures of 
emotional distress will be assessed at baseline and 2 -month follow -up for intervention participants. The 
measures assess the level of diabetes distress and depressive symptoms that a participant is 
experiencing, these are not diagnostic tests. Our study measures will not ask about suicidality. 
Participants may experience emotional distress related to participating in the in tervention, due to the 
focus on emotional distress. Participants will be informed that they may stop participation at any time if they feel uncomfortable. Additionally, if a participant appears to be in emotional distress, study staff will inquire as to the participant’s well-being and whether they wish to stop the study visit or session. 
Participants who disclose potentially harmful information (e.g., suicidality) will be immediately referred for an assessment by [CONTACT_653899]. All participan ts will be provided with a letter 
outlining services that details information on available mental health services at CGMHSA and low -cost 
resources available in Jefferson County . 
Inconvenience. Participating in the study may inconvenience  patients because of the time needed to 
collect data and participate in the intervention sessions.  
 Alternative Treatments and Procedures: All study participants, including those in the single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_49152], will have full access to all available standard of care clinical services at CGMHSA, and are permitted to withdraw or refuse participation at any time.  
 
1.5.2  KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 Participants may or may not benefit from the study. For participants in the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393], benefits may includ e improvement in emotional distress, diabetes self -management behaviors, and glycemic 
control. Risks to participants are related primarily to breach of confidentiality and emotional distress. As the risk to individual participants is small and potential benefits are significant, the risk/benefit ratio is favorable.  
 
2 STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1 OVERALL DESIGN  
  This is a single -arm pi[INVESTIGATOR_653889] -Based Diabetes Education  (an integrated mindfulness -

 <10/30/2022> 
  9 • glycemic control (A1C test results from electronic medical records)  
 
6.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
   
6.2.1  DEFINITION OF ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurren ce associated with the use of an intervention in 
humans, whether or not considered intervention -related (21 CFR 312.32 (a)).  
 
6.2.2  DEFINITION OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (SAE)  
An adverse event (AE) is considered “ serious ” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
• Death  
• A life-threatening adverse event  (of note, the term “life- threatening” refers to an event in which 
the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event, rather than to an event which 
hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe ) 
• inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081]  
• a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal 
life functions  
• or a congen ital anomaly/birth defect . 
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospi[INVESTIGATOR_6721], based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the 
subject  and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
6.2.3  CLASSIFICATION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVERITY OF EVENT  
For adverse events (AEs) , the following guidelines will be used to describe severi ty:  
 
• Mild – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject ’s daily 
activities.  
• Moderate – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic 
measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functi oning.  
• Severe  – Events interrupt a subject ’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy 
or other treatment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Of 
note, the term “severe” does not necessarily equate to  “serious .” 
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY INTERVENTION  
All adverse events ( AEs) must have their relationship to study intervention assessed by [CONTACT_139458]/her clinical judgment. The 
degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below. In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  
<Pi[INVESTIGATOR_653885]- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  10  
• Related  – The AE is known to occur with the study intervention , there is a reasonable possibility 
that the study intervention  caused the AE , or there is a temporal relationship between the study 
intervention  and event. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the study intervention  and the AE. 
• Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the study 
intervention  caused the event, there is no temporal relationship between the study intervention  
and event onset, or an alt ernate etiology has been established.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  EXPECTEDNESS  
The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_21190] ( AE) is expected 
or unexpected.  An AE  will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is 
not consistent with the risk information previously described for the study intervention . 
6.2.4  TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP 
The occurrence of an  adverse event (AE ) or serious adverse event (SAE ) may come to the attention of 
study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject  presenting for medical care, or 
upon review by a study monitor.  
 
All AEs including local and systemic reactions not meeting the criteria for SAE s will be captured on the 
appropriate  case report form  (CRF). Information to be collected includes event description, time of 
onset, clinician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by t hose with the 
training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriately regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution.  
 Any medical condition that is present at the time that the subject  is screened will be considered as 
baseline and not reported as an AE. However, if the study subject ’s condition  deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it will be recorded as an AE.  
 Chan ges in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event 
at each level of severity  to be performed. A Es characterized as intermittent require documentation of 
onset and duration of each epi[INVESTIGATOR_1865].  
 The Study Coordin ator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after 
informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non -serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after the last day of 
study participation.  At each study visit, the Study Coordinator  will in quire about the occurrence of 
AE/SAEs since the last visit.  Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization.  
 
6.2.[ADDRESS_877370] 
include an assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility th at the study intervention caused 
the event. Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g., all- cause mortality) must be reported 
in accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the 
<Pi[INVESTIGATOR_653885]- Based Diabetes Education> Version 1.0 
 <10/30/2022> 
  11 study intervention and the event (e.g., death from anaphylaxis). In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the event to the sponsor.  
 All serious adverse events ( SAEs ) will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_653891]. Other supporting documentation of 
the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as possible.  
 
6.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
6.3.1  DEFINITION OF UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections ( OHRP ) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the 
following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the Institutional Review Board ( IRB)-
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject  population being studied;  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by [CONTACT_500457]); and  
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
 
6.3.2   UNANTICIPATED PROBLEM REPORTING  
The investigator will report unanticipated problems (UP s) to the reviewing Institutional Review Board 
(IRB). The UP report will include the following information:  
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB project 
numbe r; 
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome;  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or outcome 
represents an UP ;  
• A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been taken or 
are proposed in response to the UP . 
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, UP s will be reported using the following timeline:   
 
• UPs that are serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported to the IRB within 10 working  days  of 
the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
• Any other UP  will be reported to the IRB within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming 
aware of the problem.

feasible to recruit [ADDRESS_877371] deviation of 1.8% for the change in HbA1c (from baseline to 2-month follow -up), which was obtained from results of a prior interv ention study in adults 
with type [ADDRESS_877372] 80% power to detect changes in HbA1c (from baseline to follow -up) of 1.0% and grea ter as being statistically significant.62 This calculation was performed using 
nQuery Advisor + nTerim, version 3.  
 
7.[ADDRESS_877373] size, we will not 
estimate efficacy based on outcome measures. In addition, we will not be testing formal statistical hypotheses.  
 
7.3.2  ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Initial proposed analysis: To estimate effect size of the pi[INVESTIGATOR_52393], we will perform paired t -tests 
to study the change in the pr imary outcome, A1C, and secondary outcomes, diabetes distress and 
diabetes self -management behaviors, from baseline to post -intervention. Analysis of covariance will be 
used to examine baseline to 2- month changes in primary and secondary outcomes while con trolling for 
potential covariates of interest, such as demographics or disease severity. Distributions of continuous outcome variables will be examined for normality using box plots, stem and leaf plots, and normal probability plots. Variables that are det ermined to be non -normally distributed will be transformed or 
analyzed using non -parametric tests, such as Wilcoxon signed- rank test. All statistical tests will be two -
sided using a significance level of 0.05. Statistical analysis will be completed using S AS, version 9.4 or 
later.  
 
Analy sis plan : We will generate descriptive statistics, including frequency distribution tables for 
categorical variables, as well as means, medians, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges for 
continuous variables, including diabetes distress.

General Information
You are  being asked to take  part  in a research study.  This  research study is voluntary, 
meaning you do not have  to take part in it. The  procedures,  risks, and benefits are  fully 
described further  in the consent form.
Purpose The purpose of  the study is  to pi[INVESTIGATOR_653894] a Mindfulness-Based Diabetes 
Education program with adults who  have type 2 diabetes in order  to get participants’  
feedback on the program. This information will be used to adapt and improve the  
program based  on participants’ input.
Duration & Visits You will be in this study for  up to [ADDRESS_877384]  approximately 30-45 minutes, and participants will  be asked to 
complete a questionnaire. The focus  group  will take approximately 60 minutes, and  
participants will be asked for their thoughts  and feedback on the program.  
This study  will provide  a program called Mindfulness-Based Diabetes Education.  This is a 
new program that combines a stress management and  a diabetes self-management 
education program. It is an  8-week program with  weekly meetings in-person, group 
meetings. Sessions  will focus on  education  and strategies to improve diabetes self-
management including healthy eating, physical  activity, medication taking,  self-
monitoring, and will also include instruction and practice of mindfulness-based exercises to reduce  stress. 
Overview of Procedures
This study  will include 2 study visits and a focus group that will be run  by a trained 
facilitator to get participants’ feedback on the Mindfulness-Based Diabetes  Education 
program. If you are  eligible and choose to participate, you  will receive Mindfulness-
Based Diabetes Education program.
Risks The most  common risks  include  breach of confidentiality, inconvenience, or emotional 
distress. You  may experience minor pain or  discomfort related to  study activities; this is a 
minor risk and  is reversible.
Benefits You may  or may  not benefit from the study. This research may help develop  an 
intervention and benefit future patient care.
Alternatives Your alternative is  not to participate in the research.
Purpose of the Research  Study
We are  asking you to take part in a research study to reduce stress and improve diabetes self-management in 
adults who have type [ADDRESS_877385] for diabetes  among all 50 states in  the [LOCATION_002]  which 
means about 14% of people in the  state have  diabetes.  Diabetes distress is common with  adults with  type  [ADDRESS_877386] 
type 2 diabetes in order to get participants’ feedback on the program.  The  feedback  will be used to improve and

you need to reduce stress and improve your  diabetes  self-management.  Risks include discomfort, a loss of  
confidentiality, minor pain, and inconvenience.  You may feel some discomfort in  talking about personal health 
issues, emotional  distress, or diabetes management. You will only be  asked to  discuss what you feel comfortable 
sharing and you may choose not to share. Study staff will explain to  all participants that what is said in group 
meetings is confidential. However, a  risk for entering  this program  is loss of confidentiality. This risk  is very 
small, as study staff follow rules to make sure your  information is  shared only with people  who are supposed to 
have it.  We take precautions to minimize the risk of loss of confidentiality including storing study  information 
with a code only, there is no  participant’s  name  [CONTACT_29097]. Access to  study information 
will be  restricted to study personnel. Study information will be stored electronically on a secure, encrypted, 
password protected  server. Program sessions will be audio-recorded to  assess fidelity of the program; names or  
other identifying information will be removed from the transcripts  and  only study  staff will  have  access to  these.
You will be encouraged to make changes  to your habits around  your diabetes self-management (including 
healthy eating, physical  activity, self-monitoring,  medication taking) as well  as to practice mindfulness exercises 
to reduce  stress. You may feel tired or hungry when  you first make these changes, but this  is usually mild and 
often gets better with time. This study will include gentle, non-strenuous  physical activity including walking and 
gentle yoga. Participants will  be offered modifications based  on their physical  abilities. You could hurt  yourself  
when exercising, such  as spraining your ankle. On rare occasions, increased exercise can  cause chest pain  and 
undue shortness of  breath. This is not common, and you will only be  asked to  make changes  that  are 
comfortable for you. Over 2-months, you will be asked to attend [ADDRESS_877390] get your

Open Label Peanut Oral Immunotherapy in Children: IMPACT Follow Up 
Study (IND #[ZIP_CODE])   
  
1.  Abstract  
  
This application is being submitted as a follow -up to Protocol NA_00077852 “Oral  
Immunotherapy for Induction of Tolerance in Peanut Allergic Children. ”  The “IMPACT” protocol 
was a double -blind, placebo -controlled study of peanut oral immunotherapy in children [ADDRESS_346914], we did not specify 
any detailed protocol for the open label crosso ver treatment, as this is an evolving field, but we 
are now ready to offer this open label treatment as promised.  
  
There are no specific hypotheses to be tested.  The main research questions will focus on the 
safety and efficacy of the treatment.  
  
   
2.  Objectives  
  
1. The primary objectives of this protocol is to provide open label peanut oral 
immunotherapy (OIT) for those subjects who received placebo treatment in the 
doubleblind phase of the above noted study and to assess safety, as measured by [CONTACT_284015].  
  
Secondary objective will include:  
2. Efficacy of the treatment, as defined by [CONTACT_284016].  
  
3.  Background   
  
Anaph ylaxis is a severe, potentially fatal, systemic allergic reaction that occurs suddenly after 
contact [CONTACT_284017] -causing substance1. Peanut allergy affects 1 -2% of US children and is 
associated with a high risk of life -threatening anaphylaxis. 2,[ADDRESS_346915] commonly associated with death and near -death following food -induced 
anaphylaxis and is frequently encountered in common food products . Peanut allergy also 
persists into adulthood in the majority of affected individuals, with less than 25% of 
peanutallergic children naturally developi[INVESTIGATOR_284003].

immunotherapy for peanut allergy, oral immunotherapy (OIT) has proven to be the most 
efficacious to date.   
  
The rationale for this study is that peanut OIT will induce immune modulation resulting in 
suppression of allergic responses allowin g for desensitization to peanut and protection from 
anaphylaxis.  The use of peanut flour for this study is similar to other single allergen OIT 
studies.[ADDRESS_346917] balance 
safety with efficacy.  
  
  
4.  Study Procedures  
  
This study will provide open label peanut OIT, with a maintenance dose of 1000 mg of peanut 
protein.  Treatment will be initiated on a single day in which multiple doses are given. Peanut 
flour will be given incrementally and increased every 15 -30 minutes until a maximum dose of 6 
mg peanut protein is given. This visit may take up to 6 hours to complete:    
Initial Day Dose Escalation  
Dose #  Peanut Protein (mg)  
[ADDRESS_346918] tolerated dose from the initial escalation day. Subjects who 
tolerate 6 mg during initial dose escalation and again on the observation day following initial 
dose escalation will proceed with do sing per the table below.  Subjects  who do not reach 6 mg 
on the initial dose escalation day  will require additional up -doing visits  to escalate to the 6 mg 
dose (Example: from 1.5 to 3.0 to 6.0 ) mg before beginning the dose build up schedule 
described  below.  Once subjects have tolerated a dose under observation, they will then 
continue dosing at home with OIT and return to the research unit every 2 weeks for a 1 -step 
dose escalation to a maximum daily dose of 1000 mg (see table below). Subjects may re main 
on a single -maintenance dose for longer than [ADDRESS_346919] achieve a minimum of 200mg during the build up to enter the maintenance phase.

  Mild symptoms with dosing such as transient nausea, mild abdominal pain, and/or oral 
pharyngeal pruritus are common and are not considered dose limiting. Dose limiting symptoms 
include those that do not respond to antihistamine and/or require the use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_238].   
  
Subjects who experience dose limiting symptoms during an up -dosing visit will continue on the 
previously tolerated dose for an additional [ADDRESS_346920] may attempt a specific dose level 3 separate times 
before the dose is considered “not tolerated”. In that case, the dose previously tolerated will 
become the maintenan ce dose and the subject will not attempt additional up -dosing.

Consent will be obtained at the last visit in  IMPACT Study. For subjects who have already 
completed the last visit of that protocol and/or families who request additional time to review the 
consent, consent will be obtained at the 1st visit in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit prior to

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_346921] some context to comprehend the assent process. The assent process w ill be 
documented in the clinical note.  
 At each dosing visit, the following procedures will be performed prior to dose administration:  
• Vital signs  
• Review of adverse events including any accidental exposure to peanut   
• Review of concomitant medications  
• Review of home dosing diaries  
• Physical exam  
• Peak flow  
  
The build -up phase will comprise up to [ADDRESS_346922] 12 weeks and may continue as 
long as through week 64. Subjects will be seen  every 6 -8 weeks during the Maintenance 
phase. The window between maintenance visits may be extended to longer than 6 -8 weeks if 
necessary. At the end of the Maintenance phase, subjects will undergo an open peanut oral 
food challenge to a maximum of 4000 mg of peanut protein using the following dosing regimen:  
  
Dose #  Peanut Protein (mg)  Cumulative Dose (mg)  
1  100  100  
2  300  400  
3  600  1000  
4  1000  2000  
5  2000  4000  
  
  
After this food challenge all participants will be given individualized guidelines for the 
introduction of peanut into their diet based on the outcome of the open peanut challenge.

6.  Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
  
The treatment agent, a de -fatted peanut flour, will be provided by [CONTACT_284020] (UNC) GMP manufacturing facility under an Investigational New Drug (IND) 
application to the FDA. All study product will be  obtained from the same manufacturer; a 
certificate of analysis obtained according to FDA standards will be stored as per 
manufactur er’s recommendations to ensure stability. Research staff will administer food flour to 
the subject orally in an appropriate age-appropriate food vehicle. Each peanut flour/powder is 
weighed into a separate container to be dispensed to the subject. Dosage will be done 
according to the protocol as set forth above. For home administration, the family will be 
provided with an adequ ate supply of individually packaged peanut OIT. The powder may be 
added to apple juice, milk, applesauce, pudding or other age -appropriate food. The product 
must be consumed promptly after mixing. If there is a prolonged delay in consumption (>2 
hours), th e product should be discarded and a new product package mixed and consumed. 
Subjects or their parents will be instructed to take/administer the dose of OIT at approximately 
the same time of the day each day. At least approximately 12 hours should pass betw een 
doses.   
  
Drug Accountability: Under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR §312.62) the 
investigator is required to maintain adequate records of the disposition of the investigational 
agent, including the date and quantity of the drug received, to whom the drug was dispense d 
(subject -by-subject accounting), and a detailed accounting of any drug accidentally or 
deliberately destroyed. Records for receipt, storage, use, and disposition will be maintained by 
[CONTACT_80935]. A drug -dispensing log will be kept current for each s ubject. This log will contain 
the identification of each subject and the date, lot and quantity of drugs dispensed. All records

7.  Study Stat istics  
  
As an open label follow -on study, statistics will be purely descriptive, describing the proportion of 
subjects achieving desensitization as well as measures of safety.    
  
Early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004]:   Study enrollment and treatment will be suspended p ending expedited 
review of all pertinent data by [CONTACT_284022]:   
• Any death.  
• More than one severe anaphylactic reaction related to peanut immunotherapy 
dosing at any stage of the protocol.  
• More than three subjects require 2 or mo re injections of epi[INVESTIGATOR_284005].  
• More than 3 subjects require epi[INVESTIGATOR_284006] 2 or more occasions to treat 
dosingrelated reaction over the course of the study  
  
  
8.  Risks  
  
OIT:  The primary risk of the study is related to the peanut OIT.  Previous studies have shown 
that mild reactions, such as oral pruritus, are very common, while more severe respi[INVESTIGATOR_284007] 1% of doses.  The dosing schema to be used on the initial 
escalation day followed by [CONTACT_80924] -up phase of immunotherapy is based on previous 
experience with peanut, egg, milk, and wheat OIT.5  In addition to acute reactions, 10 -20% of 
treated subjects experience more chronic abdominal pain , which is the most common reason to 
discontinue treatment.  Some of those subjects have eosinophilic esophagitis, which has been 
estimated to occur in 2 -5% of children receiving OIT.[ADDRESS_346924] with symptoms 
consistent with eosinophilic esophag itis such as swallowing difficulty, food impaction, persistent 
vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea and/or heartburn beyond 4 weeks of OIT avoidance will be 
referred to GI.   
Oral food challenge:  Since the subjects will have already undergone an End -of-Treatm ent oral 
food challenge in the IMPACT study, a baseline food challenge will not be needed to establish a 
peanut allergy diagnosis.  An end -of- treatment challenge will be conducted to determine safe 
levels of peanut to eat, but the subjects will be substan tially desensitized at that time, making 
reactions less likely overall.  However, it is important to recognize that there is still risk of a 
reaction that could even be severe.  Common symptoms may include urticaria, angioedema, 
nausea, abdominal discomfor t, vomiting and/or diarrhea, rhinorrhea, sneezing and/or mild 
wheezing.  The major risks involved include severe breathing difficulties, and rarely, a drop in 
blood pressure.  While a severe outcome is theoretically possible (i.e. death), this has only 
occurred once in the world in medically supervised oral food challenges.  To date the primary 
investigator has performed more than 5000 oral food challenges without a serious 
lifethreatening anaphylactic reaction or need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_284008]: June 19, 2020  
Principal Investigator: [INVESTIGATOR_284002]: IRB00150453   
  
  
JHMIRB eFormA  01  
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007    
Page 8 of 11  
  Trained staff will be present to administer study food challenges and a physician will be at the 
bedside to provide oversight, evaluation, and treatment as needed.  The risks of oral food 
challenges are minimized by [CONTACT_83236]:  
• Children must  have a stable baseline examination prior to undergoing the 
challenge without significant symptoms of flaring atopic dermatitis, exacerbations 
of rhinorrhea, current urticarial, or other symptoms evaluated during food 
challenges  
• Children must have no whee zing or repetitive cough prior to challenge  
• Children must have no current illnesses (e.g. fever) at time of oral challenge  
• Medications (epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], intravenous fluids, antihistamines, ranitidine, 
vasopressors, beta -agonists, and steroids), personnel and  equipment (oxygen, 
resuscitation equipment) will be immediately available to treat allergic reactions 
should they occur.  
• Children will have discontinued antihistamines and bronchodilators for appropriate 
periods prior to challenge, thereby [CONTACT_284023].  
• The food will be provided gradually, at 15 minute intervals, beginning with a dose 
unlikely to trigger a reaction and progress stepwise with escalating dose s.  
• Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respi[INVESTIGATOR_697]) and physical examination 
will be undertaken at baseline and as indicated throughout the challenge.  
• Challenges will be stopped, and medications administered, in the event of any 
objective sympt oms.  
• Children who have experienced an allergic reaction will be observed until [ADDRESS_346925] passed for a local reaction, or 4 hours for a generalized reaction, from the 
time of resolution of symptoms.  
  
Plan for reporting and collecting adverse events  
  
Reporting will occur as follows:   
  
i. Toxicity will be graded according to the NCI -CTC for application in adverse event 
reporting. The NCI -CTC has been reviewed specifically for this protocol and is 
appropriate for this study population. The purpose of using the NCI -CTC system 
is to provide standard language to describe toxicities, and to facilitate tabulation 
and analysis of the data and ass essment of the clinical significance of 
treatmentrelated toxicities. The investigator will try to determine the relationship 
of toxicity to peanut immunotherapy as not related, possibly related, or definitely 
related using standard criteria for clinical tr ials. All grades of toxicity will be noted. 
Toxicity grades are assigned by [CONTACT_284024].   
  
ii. Adverse events, not included in the NCI -CTC listing, should be recorded and 
graded 1 -5 according to the General Grade Definition provided below:

Version 3 Dated:   06/[ADDRESS_346927] will be convened for overview of this study .  The Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_7706] -Investigators are responsible for collecting and recoding all clinical data.  As 
these results are collected, all toxicities and adverse events will be identified and reported to the 
PI.  Adverse events will be reported  as described above.  The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_284009].   
  
The use of epi[INVESTIGATOR_284010] -related symptoms will be classified as a serious adverse 
event. The location of the event (home or clinic) and number of doses of epi[INVESTIGATOR_284011].  
  
Any new diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagi tis made during the treatment period will be 
classified as a serious adverse event and reported to the DSMB.   
  
Yearly reports will be made to the DSMB and proper Institutional Committees, as required.  All 
adverse events will be kept in a computerized fi le by [CONTACT_284025].   
  
In the event that the study is stopped because of adverse event(s), it will not be resumed until 
information regarding the adverse event(s) has been discussed with the DSMB and the DSMB 
concurs with resumption of the studies.   
  
  
Legal risks such as the risks that would be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
  
The risk of breach of confidentiality will be minimized by [CONTACT_284026][INVESTIGATOR_284012] a locked file cabi net 
accessible only to the investigators.  
  
  
Financial risks to the participants.  
  
The study does not provide routine care or any medications or treatments for general health or 
allergic problems (although we will be available for phone consultation re garding possible 
reactions).  All costs associated with study visits, skin testing, spi[INVESTIGATOR_038], blood drawing, food 
challenges, and OIT protein are covered by [CONTACT_473].  All participants will be required to 
provide a food matrix (juice, milk, appl esauce, pudding or other age -appropriate food ) to 
consume the daily doses at home .  This will be provided by [CONTACT_284027]/variety can 
be altered for each child’s preference.  All partic ipants will be required to have an epi[INVESTIGATOR_130635]-injector available at home during immunotherapy treatment.  If they do not already have 
one, they will be responsible for the cost of this medication.  
  
9.  Benefits  
  
The benefits for the participant include the possibility of a change in sensitivity to pea nut and 
decreased allergic reactions following an accidental ingestion of peanut.  Another possible 
benefit is the possibility of altering the natural course of the peanut allergy, including tolerance to 
pean ut protein in someone that is unlikely to natura lly “outgrown” his/her allergy.  If tolerance is 
achieved, this then make impact quality of life.

Background & Significance 
Enhanced recovery  after surgery (ERAS)  pathways play a critical role in the delivery of high- quality surgical 
care. These protocols incorporate multiple perioperative patient interventions including preemptive analgesia, 
measures to reduce postoperative nausea and emesis, fluid balance aimed at euvolemia, and both early 
ambulation and oral intake.  ERAS pathways are significant because  they have been shown to shorten 
recovery, decreas e hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408], reduc e complications /nosocomial infections , and conserv e resources.1-20  
Same -day discharge (SDD)  is a central aspect of enhanced recovery pathways.  
 
SDD and ERAS protocols are part of a new initiative within the Women’s Health Institute, and their 
application for gynecologic surgery is of increasing interest across the country.1-[ADDRESS_562300] consistently demonstrated both feasibility and safety of SDD after  laparoscopic and robotic  
hysterectomy, with no significant increase in complications or readmissions  as compared to discharge on 
postoperative day (POD)  1.  In fact, a recent systematic review by [CONTACT_442663] 15 observational studies 
with nearly 12,000 patients revealed SDD is feasible, at a rate of nearly 80%,  when patients are properly 
selected and careful surgical planning is performed.[ADDRESS_562301] also demonstrated high patient 
satisfaction10,12 and less cost18 with SDD after minimally invasive hysterectomy .  SDD has been applied in 
other minimally invasive gynecologic procedures, such as minimally invasive myomectomy, with low 
readmission rates (0.6% within 48 hours, 1.4% over 3 months).[ADDRESS_562302] an important role in other areas of gynecologic surgery. In the field of 
urogynecology, quality of life reconstructive surgery is often performed to address symptoms of pelvic organ 
prolapse, urinary incontinence, and/or fecal incontinence.  A pr ospective study by [CONTACT_442664].[ADDRESS_562303] was utilized after vaginal hysterectomy, which per mitted SDD in 96% 
of patients.[ADDRESS_562304] pelvic organ prolapse and is a 
mainstay in the field of urogynecology.  A  study by [CONTACT_442665] , a similar mesh -augmented procedure that is performed for rectal prolapse, and  concluded 
that SDD is  feasible and safe.22 A preliminary  study by [CONTACT_442666] t he Cleveland Clinic within the 
Female Urology division investigated SDD after minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy  (article in press ).  In this 
study, SDD was achieved in 10 of 12 patients (83.3%).  The two patients who did not have SDD were due to 
case completion after 6PM, a preset case completion requirement.  Outcomes were also retrospectively 
compared between patients who underwent  SDD (N= 10) and patients who stayed overnight (N=30).  Only one 
Version 2: 30OCT 18 
 patient had an emergency department  visit on POD 20, due to an unrelated mechanical fall.  Importantly, there 
were no major complications in either group requiring procedural interventions, n ew prescriptions, or additional 
interventions.  Recently, a study by [CONTACT_442667] -assisted 
sacrocolpopexy.  In this retrospective study, 80 women underwent SDD compared to 192 who were 
discharged on >/=POD 1.[ADDRESS_562305]  (EMR),  we will evaluate 1) the number of unscheduled office visits, pati ent-initiated calls for a 
surgery -related complication, emergency department  visits , and readmissions /reoperations  of patients 
who had a SDD protocol and 2) the severity of any adverse events using the Clavien Dindo Scale.  We 
will utilize patient phone calls to inquire about any of the aforementioned events outside of our 
institution.  We will compare incidence of postoperative adverse e vents between patients undergoing 
SDD versus a historical control group who were discharged on POD [ADDRESS_562306].  All patients meeting eligibility criteria will be approached for study 
participation.  Outcomes will be assessed on POD  0/[ADDRESS_562307] -operative follow up visit, 
generally at 6 weeks after surgery.    
 
Primary o utcomes : The primary outcome of this study is serious adverse events.     
 
Secondary outcomes:  
• Patient -initiated phone calls for a surgery -related complication 
Version 2: 30OCT 18 
 • Unscheduled office visits, including voiding trials  
• Emergency department  visits    
• Cost of surgery/post -operative hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Quality of Recovery (QoR -15), a validated questionnaire created to measure a patient’s early post -
operative status24    
• Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores  
• Minimally invasive  sacrocolpopexy survey  
 
Paradigm    
Preoperative Visit    
Participants will be prospectively identified by [CONTACT_442668] 
a minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy.  A chart review by [CONTACT_442669] , after which all patients will be called explaining the purpose of the study, risks, benefits 
and alternatives to participation. A telephone encounter in the EMR will document this inform ed consent 
process.   Documentation including signing the consent form will be obtained at the preoperative visit or on the 
day of surgery.  
 
Thorough preoperative surgical counseling will then take place at the preoperative visit  as per our standard 
protocol.   A patient education video, approximately  10.5 minutes in length,  developed by [CONTACT_442670]:  
• The expectation that eligible patients will be discharged home the same day following surgery    
• Normal postoperative symptoms and care  
• Warning signs (e.g. pain, vaginal bleeding, nausea/vomiting, fever, urinary retention) and restrictions    
• The possibility of being discharged home with an indwelling catheter if unable to void after surgery    
• The importance of the presence of a caregiver postoperatively    
Contact [CONTACT_442671]/ concerns will be given  to the patient.    
 
Prescriptions will also be provided for analgesia,  a bowel regimen, and postoperative nausea and vomiting 
prophylaxis, so that all medications will be immediately available upon discharge after surgery.    
 
Day of Surgery  
An ERAS  protocol for preemptive analgesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting, fluid balance, and 
postoperative oral intake will be used on the day of surgery to help facilitate SDD.   
 
Fasting:  Patients will be instructed to take no food by [CONTACT_442672].  C lear 
liquids  will be allowed up to 3  hours before  surgery.  This protocol is in accordance with Cleveland Clinic 
Anesthesia protocols.    
 
Preemptive Analgesia:  Prophylactic medications (if no contraindications) will be given upon arrival to the 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442658] o f surgery for increased postoperative pain relief, decreased narcotic consumption, and 
patient satisfaction.   These  orders will be placed as part of the pre- operative order set and will  include: 
celecoxib 400 mg PO , acetaminophen 1,000 mg PO    and g abapentin 600 mg PO . For patients 65 years old or 
<50 kg, a reduced, 200mg dose of gabapentin will be provided.  One dose of ketorolac (30 mg IV or 15 mg IV 
in patients 65 years old or <50 kg) will be given at incision closure if no contraindications ex ist.  Use of 
intradermal analgesia will be at the discretion of the primary surgeon.  Sparing use of IV opi[INVESTIGATOR_442659]-
operatively and in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) will be at the discretion of anesthesiology.    
 
Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting:   Prescription for scopolamine transdermal patch and instructions for use 
will be provided at the preoperative visit for any patients with a history of postoperative nausea and vomiting if 
no contraindications exist (e.g. angle closure glaucoma) .25 
• Dexamethasone 4mg IV once prior to incision (± 30 min) if no contraindications exist.  
• Ondansetron 4 mg IV once prior to incision closure (± 30 min) if no contraindications exist.     
• Antiemetic medications may be given in the PACU  at the discretion of anest hesiology.    
Version 2: 30OCT 18 
  
Fluid balance:  The goal will be to maintain intraoperative euvolemia. After surgery, the peripheral IV will  be 
saline locked when tolerating PO intake in the  PACU.  
 
Postoperative Oral Intake: Early feeding will be encouraged,  and a regular diet may be resumed immediately 
following surgery. Amount and type of food consumed may be determined by [CONTACT_102].  
 
Vaginal Packing: Avoidance of vaginal packing will be encouraged, however, if packing is placed , it will be 
removed in the PACU  by a staff, fellow, or resident prior to the voiding trial .   
 
Voiding Trial : Our standard voiding protocol will be performed in the PACU  when the patient is able to stand 
and ambulate to the restroom. The bladder will be retrograde filled with [ADDRESS_562308] void 200 ml (or 2/3 of the instilled volume if the patient is not 
able to tolerate the full amount). If the patient is unable to void then the Foley catheter will be replaced and she 
will be given Foley teaching or, alternatively, the patient may be taught intermittent self -catheterization. A 
repeat voiding trial will be scheduled within [ADDRESS_562309]-operative Assessment and Disposition: All patients will be assessed by [CONTACT_442673]. Post-operative requirements include:   Ability to tolerate oral fluids and medications , adequate 
pain control  and ability to walk with  assistance .  Patients not meeting criteria for discharge home at the 
conclusion of the recovery period will be  kept for observation overnight as an extended recovery .    
 
Post-operative Follow -up 
• POD  0: All patients will be contact[CONTACT_442674].  If patients have a late discharge from the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_307] , after [ADDRESS_562310] a pproximately 5 minutes in length (or as dictated by [CONTACT_442675]) , to 
occur between 1500 and 1900 on day of surgery.

3. Data Collection  
The EMR  will be reviewed to collect preoperative, intraoperative, and POD  0 data points.   We will use the 
following method  to identify the occurrence of a procedure- related adverse event: The EMR  will be reviewed 
for patient phone calls  for a procedure- related complication, unscheduled office visits, emergency department 
visits, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_442660] [ADDRESS_562314] will include the following:  
• Wound infection  
• Hematoma  
• Transfusion  
• Pelvic abscess  
• Osteomyelitis  
• Venous thromboembolism  (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism)  
• Delayed bowel or urinary tract injury  
• Bowel obstruction or ileus  
• Cardiac or pulmonary complication 
• Neurologic injury  
 
We will also employ an approach that will allow us to capture events that may have been handled outside of 
the CCHS or in institutions that do not utilize Epic . To capture these data points if they exist, we will contact 
[CONTACT_442676] 1  (within 24 hours of surgical completion time)  to determine if they received 
any care from a facility outside of the CCHS  and then again at the post -operative follow up visit , which 
generally occurs at 6 weeks .  We will then use these data with the Clavien  Dindo Scale to determine the 
severity of the adverse event , with a grade 3 or higher considered to be a serious adverse event , and we will 
compare this proportion to the reference proportion of 26.3% .  A proportion of patients with grade 3 or higher 
less than 45.1% will be considered non- inferior to the reference.    
 
As part of the effort to characterize the patient population, we will extract data regarding total procedure- related 
costs  using the EMR . We will assess satisfaction using the quality of recovery questionnaire, visual analog 
scores for postoperative pain, and a patient satisfaction survey described by [CONTACT_442677]4 at 
thepostoperative visit , which uses a Press Ganey scale for  responses (See Appendix A).   Please see data 
collection sheet for a comprehensive list of planned data points.  
 
 
4. Statistical Plan  
Statistical analysis: Categorical variables will be presented as n/N (%) with 95% confidence intervals. 
Continuous variables will be presented as mean +/ -SD or median [range]. A Pearson’s chi -square test  or 
Fisher exact test will be used for frequencies and proportions of categorical values and t test or the non-
parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test for mean values of continuously m easured variables. P values ≤ 0.05 will 
be considered statistically significant and we will use SAS (version 9.4, The SAS Institute, Cary NC) as our 
statistical package to perform these analyses.  The primary investigator will perform the statistical analy sis with 
assistance from the WHI statistician.  
Version 2: 30OCT 18 
 We will use data from a historical control group discharged on POD 1 after minimally  invasive sacrocolpopexy  
to examine Aim 1 and Aim 2.  This is a cohort of 60 women matching our eligibility criteria from a prospective 
randomized trial of two different types of lightweight polypropylene mesh (IRB #14- 354). This study completed 
recruitment 2017. It consists of a group of women who underwent minimally  invasive sacrocolpopexy  using the 
same surgical approaches , at the same institutions  (main campus, Fairview and Hillcrest), and performed by 
[CONTACT_442678].  The primary  differenc e is that  participants in that study and the cohort 
proposed here is that  all participants were discharged home on POD 1.   We will utilize this cohort to compare 
the incidence and severity of procedure- related adverse events  and costs between SDD and POD 1.  
Compar isons on outcome measures will be done using either an ANOVA analysis or a student’s t test for 
parametric continuous outcomes, a Kruskal -Wallis or Mann Whitney U test for non- parametric outcomes and a 
Chi-square test for all categorical outcomes.  Logisti c regression will be performed to control for confounding 
variables.     
 
Sample size:  We estimate that approximately  80 minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy surgeries will be 
performed per year .  Of these, we anticipate that ~3/4 will meet eligibility criteria and of these patients, ~3/4 will 
consent to participate.  Based upon data by [CONTACT_442679], a Clavien Dindo grade 3 adverse event (defined as 
requiring surgical, endoscopic, or radiologic imag ing/intervention) was identified in 26.3% of patients after a 
minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy.[ADDRESS_562315] -operative complication rate of 5.4% after minimally 
invasive sacrocolpopexy (robotic and laparoscopic).[ADDRESS_562316] that 26.3% may be an overestimation of 
adverse events as the Unger et al study included any imaging required in the postoperative period even if the 
result was normal.  H owever, we also suspect that a 5.4% adverse event incidence may be low.  As such, we 
feel that an adverse event incidence of 12% may be more representative of that expected after this surgical 
procedure.  
We used a  one-sided exact test for non-inferiority  of binomial proportion to determine the degree of difference 
between the proportion of 26.3%  and an incidence proportion greater than the reference which could be 
detected and deemed inferior (significantly greater) to the reference with a power of 80% . With a sample size 
of 45 patients , the proportion of patients with a Clavien Dindo grade of 3 will need to be 45.1% or greater.  We 
will account for a 3 % drop out rate (based on [ADDRESS_562317] -operative visit “no- show” rates for the Urogynecology 
division ) by [CONTACT_442680] [ADDRESS_562318]’s personal health information will be a priority in this study. One master excel file 
containing subject personal information will be kept in a designated protected research drive on a password-
protected computer in a locked office at the Cleveland Clinic. In that file, each subject will be assigned an 
identification number that will be used to de- identify subjects.  All paper forms , including the informed consent,  
will be kept in a research cabinet dedicated to this project which will be locked at all times, in the locked 
Women’s Health Institute urogynecology research office on A81. All survey form s will contain de- identified 
information – identification numbers will correspond to the subjects listed in the master excel file. All study data 
will be transferred and managed electronically using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). REDCap is 
a secure, web- based application designed to support data capture for research studies. The system is 
protected by a login and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) encryption.   
 
6. Research Environment  
SDD and ERAS protocol s are part of a new initiative within the Women’s Health Institute directed by [CONTACT_442681], 
[CONTACT_442683] .  The co- investigator and senior mentor on this project, [CONTACT_442684], is the division director and is 
also committed to the success of this project.  Las tly, this project has been discussed at multiple research 
Version 2: 30OCT [ADDRESS_562319] successfully 
discharged patients same day after this surgery.    
 
Regarding surgical volume, a chart review determined that ~60 minimally invasive sacrocolpopexies without 
concomitant rectopexy were performed wit hin our division in 2016.  Our Female Urology collaborator , who will 
be participating in this study, performs ~[ADDRESS_562320] recruitment for this study.  Together, we feel 
that this environment is conducive to the implementation and successful execution of this research study.  
 
Timeline for Completion   
The goal for this  research study is for completion by [CONTACT_173726]’s three year 
fellowship  at Cleveland Clinic (June 2020).  After obtaining institutional review board approval, a discussion will 
be held at our division  research meeting to educate all urogynecology  and urology  staff physicians, fellows, 
physicians assistants, and nurse practitioners on  the implementation of this  project. An in -service will be given 
to familiarize the PACU  and outpatient nursing staff with the project. Additi onally, an email will be sent to the 
Ob/Gyn  and Urology  residents outlining key components of the project , and an in- service will be given  to the 
residents on our service. The anesthesiology staff will also be re -informed regarding this  project.    
 
Patient  recruitment will begin thereafter with the goal of recruiting all patients over a  [ADDRESS_562321] completion well before the conclusion of the primary investigator’s fellowship.

within 1 year.6 Pain persists as do limitations in simple mo vements and complex functional 
activities like self -care, social role, and work.3 Recurrence rates are as high as 78%.7 Thus, for 
many people LBP is a long -term, function -limiting condition rather than a short -term, self -limiting 
condition.6,8-11  LBP-related costs are staggering. Estimated annual costs for LBP -related h ealth -
care are $30.7 billion and are increasing.12  
 
Treatment of chronic LBP   
Exercise is one of the primary non -surgical approaches used worldwide for managing LBP.13-16 
Based on systematic reviews, experts concluded that exercise is as efficacious, if not more 
efficacious for managing chronic  LBP than 1) no treatment, 2) usual care, and 3) many other 
treatments, such as massage or laser therapy.13,[ADDRESS_924968] efficacious 
progra ms are 1) tailored to the individual, 2) delivered with supervision, and 3) designed to 
achieve high doses by [CONTACT_682968].   Despi[INVESTIGATOR_682915], several issues remain unresolved. First, littl e is known about which 
exercise is best for which patient.15,[ADDRESS_924969] of individualized exercise strategies in well-defined populations of people with LBP.14,21 -
24,27 The exercises should be aimed at restoring normal function and facilitating the person’s 
performance of daily activities.13,18,29 Furthermore, they recommend that future studies be 
designed to examine both the 1) specific mechanisms underlying the effect of exercise, and 2) 
effects of adherence on outcomes.16,[ADDRESS_924970] of LBP on function,3,6,12 a logical approach requires inclusion of 
explicit, individualized practice in performance of functional activities as a form of exercise. 
Interestingly, only physical conditioning programs, such as work hardening, work conditioning, 
and functional restora tion include practice of activities as part of treatment .31-36 However, these 
programs are primarily intended  for people with disabling, work -related LBP. Thus, many of the 
activities that are practiced are 1) heavy work activities rather than routine functional 
activities,32,33,36 -38 and 2) not typi[INVESTIGATOR_682916]. Finally, the programs tend to 
include a variety of co -interventions so the effect of any specific component is unclear.  32,[ADDRESS_924971], strength and endurance exercises do not produce these 
adaptations.49,50 If a goal of LBP rehabilitation is to aid acquisition, retention, and refinement of 
new motor behaviors to improve function, then the use of mot or skill training is a necessity.  
 
Model for development and course of LBP   
The Kinesiopathologic Model (KPM) provides a conceptual basis for understanding the 
development and course of LBP. Specifically, LBP is proposed to be the result of repeatedly 
using direction -specific (flexion, extension, rotation, some combination) stereotypic movement 
and alignment patterns in the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_050]. The patterns begin as the result of an interaction 
between an individual’s structural characteristics and the movemen ts and alignments needed to 
perform daily functional activities.51-57 Over time, the same patterns are used repeatedly for 
many different functional activities. The typi[INVESTIGATOR_682917] a specific  direction(s) than the thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_682918].57-61 Because the same patterns are used repeatedly, the loading is always on the same 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_682919].62 Repetitive loading of the same 
tissue could also alter the tissue’s tolerance over time, accelerate the rate of mechanical injury, 
and potentially lead to tissue degeneration. Thus, the KPM describes a mechanism by [CONTACT_682969] -term, function -limiting condition.  
 
Potential for individualized motor skill training to improve long -term course of LBP   
In our recently completed clinical trial, we compared the effects of a classification -specific (Sp) 
treatment to a non -specific (NSp) treatment over a 12 month period. The Movement System 
Impairment (MSI) classification system that we used to classify subgroups of people with LBP is 
based on the KPM.51 People in the various LBP subgroups exhibited direction -specific, 
stereotypic patterns of lumbar movement and alignment that were associ ated with their LBP. 
The Sp treatment included both exercise and training in functional activities directed at 
modifying the specific pattern(s) associated with the person’s LBP. The NSp treatment included 
strength and flexibility exercise as well as train ing to maintain a neutral alignment of the lumbar 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_682920]. We found that people in both the Sp and NSp groups had very 
large clinically meaningful improvements (61% at 6 mos) in pain and function63 but differences 
between groups were s maller than expected.64 We attributed the results to 3 related facts: 1) in 
addition to exercise, both groups received training to improve lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_682921], 2) in both groups, adherence levels wer e higher and more prolonged for 
training in functional activities than for exercise, and 3) outcomes continued to improve for about 
6 months after treatment but then gradually reversed along with declines in adherence to 
functional activity training. Chang es in pain and function were much more strongly associated 
with adherence to functional activity training than with adherence to exercise. Thus, training in 
functional activities appears to be the essential active ingredient for improvement in both 
groups.  Accordingly, the next important steps are to 1) disentangle the effects of training in 
functional activities and exercise, 2) maximize the effect by [CONTACT_682970], 3) prolong the 
treatment effects by [CONTACT_1541] a booster treatment at 6 months, and 4) enhance our 
understanding of the underlying mechanism by [CONTACT_682971].  
 
Impact on clinical practice    
Currently rehabilitation for people with chronic LBP is highly variable and is usually focused only 
on treatment of acute recurrences.28,[ADDRESS_924972] will provide 
specific recommendations for the use and timing of individualized motor skill training for 
functional activities that can be applied immed iately in practice. Because the training is focused 
on how an individual can painlessly perform functional activities that are limited, our findings will 
provide clinicians with an approach to treatment that directly addresses the factors proposed to 
contr ibute to the costly, long -term course of LBP. Also because the treatment is associated with 
prolonged periods of high levels of adherence, and uses specifically timed, periodic booster 
sessions to reinforce behaviors that minimize the patient’s symptoms an d functional limitations, 
our findings will provide the clinician and the person with LBP a feasible approach to long -term 
management of the condition, rather than just treating acute recurrences. Such an approach to 
LBP care could have an important impact  on the long -term course (i.e., persistent or recurrent 
symptoms) and associated health -care costs of chronic LBP.  
  
Focus on a treatment associated with high levels of adherence   
 
 The level of adherence during long -term treatment for most chronic diseases is only ~50%.68 
Poor adherence equates with low treatment dosage and c onsequent diminution of treatment 
effects. Data from our clinical trial demonstrated that 1) adherence levels were higher and more 
prolonged for training in functional activities than for exercise, and 2) changes in pain and 
function were more strongly rel ated to functional activity adherence than to exercise adherence. 
Thus, in the proposed project we are focusing on a treatment to which people are able to 
adhere at high levels for prolonged periods of time.   
 
Booster phase to prolong initial treatment effects  
The purpose of the booster phase is to prolong the initial improvements seen in our clinical trial. 
Others have tested the effect of booster treatments in people with musculoskeletal pain 
conditions, including chronic LBP.69-[ADDRESS_924973] before the time when outcomes began to reverse in our prior trial. The criterion for the 
number of booster sessions (i.e., how much tre atment) is the number needed to attain 
independence in performance of the treatment items.73 
 
2. Specific Aims  
Specific Aim 1:  Test if motor skill training results in better outcomes and better adherence than 
strength and flexibility exercise in the 12 months after treatment.  
Compared to the strength and flexibility exercise group, the motor skill training group will  
Hypothesis 1a. report lower LBP intensity, fewer days with LBP, and less frequent LBP 
recurrences.  
Hypothesis 1b . report fewer functional limitations as well as better perceived physical 
health and mental health, work attendance, and productivity.  
Hypothesis 1c . use fewer LBP medications and fewer healthcare services.  
Hypothesis 1d . report higher levels of adherence over longer periods of time.  
Hypothesis 1e . display improved movement and alignment patterns during functional 
activities.  
Specific Aim 2: Test the effect  of a booster phase that is provided [ADDRESS_924974] of a booster treatment condition will be greater for the motor 
skill training group than for the strength and flexibility exercise group.  
Specific Aim 3 : Examine the relationship between functional limitations and 2 factors 1) 
adherence, and 2) mov ement and alignment patterns displayed during functional activities.  
Hypothesis 3a . Adherence to motor skill training will be related more strongly to 
functional limitations than will adherence to strength and flexibility exercise.  
Hypothesis 3b . Movement  and alignment patterns displayed by [CONTACT_682972].  
 
3. Approach  
3.[ADDRESS_924975] baseline self -report and laboratory 
measures, p eople will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment conditions, motor skill training  (MST)  or 
strength and flexibility exercise  (SFE). The initial phase will be 6, 1 -hour treatment sessions, 
 
 scheduled once/week for [ADDRESS_924976] subset of  web-based, self -reports will be 
obtained monthly for the next 12 months ( 9.4a Time Table for Administration ). At 6 months after 
treatment, self -report and laboratory measures will be obtained again. Subsequently, people will 
be randomized to a booster tre atment condition, booster or no booster. The booster treatment 
will be specific to the person’s initial, condition -specific treatment  assignment. The number of 
booster sessions will be limited to the number needed to attain independence in the exercises 
or functional activities prescribed. Independence will be based on a standardized measure used 
in our prior trial .73 The 6 -month time point was chosen based on change in the Modified 
Oswestry Disability Questoinnaire  (MODQ ) scores from our prior trial.  
3.[ADDRESS_924977] half the days in a year in the region between T12 and the gluteal fold, 
with or without leg symptoms to the knee.11,74 Non-specific LBP is defined as LBP in which no 
specific pathophysiologic mechanism can be identified to account for the person’s perceived 
pain.[ADDRESS_924978] more LBP -related limitation than 
people previously studied. This will be accomplished by [CONTACT_682973] (WUPT Clinic) and local 
outpatient clinics and offices. Only participants who report a specific criterion level of disability 
and difficulty with a specific number of functional activities will be enrolled. Both genders and all 
races and ethnicities will be included in the study p opulation.

4.[ADDRESS_924979] of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and 

 
 possible diagnoses will be available. Flyers will also be placed in all office areas and given to  
clinic staff for reference.  
4.4a Clinics/Offices  
Study flyers will be placed in all area clinics/offices that see potential LBP participants  and are 
willing to assist with study recruitment . Patients that are being referred for physical therapy 
treatment of their LBP also will be asked if they are interested in the study.  If they are interested, 
their information can be given to the research coordinator (RC) or research assistant (RA)  or the 
patient can contact [CONTACT_682974].  If the person is not i nterested, the  person will be 
scheduled as usual . The RA or RC will log everyone she contacts on the Telephone Screening 
Log. If the person does not qualify for the study, he will be told to schedule his appointment with 
the clinic.  If a person exceeds thr ee callbacks, he will no longer be contact[INVESTIGATOR_530].  
4.4b Clinic Enrollment Flowchart  
 

 
 4.5 Initial Screening  
The RA will speak with  interested individuals via phone. The RA will briefly  describe  the trial and 
the procedures the person  will participate in . Informed consent for a telephone screening will be 
obtained . The RA will then interview the individual using a series of screening questions  to 
determine eligibility for the  trial. If the person is deemed ineligible by [CONTACT_606725], then the 
RA will explain the reason why he does not qualify  (DQ) . If the person is deemed eligible by 
[CONTACT_606725], he then will be scheduled for a baseline laboratory visit where additional 
screening will be performed. All individuals who are screened will be entered into  a database 
indicating their eligibility/ineligibility for the trial.  
 
4.5a Screening to Enrollment Flow Chart  
 
5. Laboratory Visits  
5.[ADDRESS_924980] (RPT). On the first visit to the laboratory the Principal Investigator (PI), RPT , 
RC, or RA  will explain the informed consent process to the person. The person will then be 
taken through the specific details on the informed consent form approved  by [CONTACT_682975]’s Human Research Protection Office (HRPO). In particular, the person will be told the 
procedures he will participate in, the potential risks and benefits of participation, and his right to 

 
 refuse participation at any time without any effect on his subsequent health care. The person 
then will be given an opportunity to read the consent form. The PI, RPT , RC,  or RA will be 
available to answer any specific questions, highlight the important details of the study again, 
and remind the p erson of his rights as a participant. The person will then be asked to sign the 
consent form. A copy of the form and a brochure explaining the person’s rights under the Health 
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations will be given t o the person for 
his records. The signed consent form will then be signed by [CONTACT_682976]. 
The consent form will be filed in a locked cabinet separate from the person’s data.  
5.2 Baseline Examination /Laboratory Measures   
Participants w ho are eligible for participation in the study and provide informed consent will be 
examined. At the initial visit, height and weight will be collected from each participant with 
clothing on and shoes off using a manual scale.  Height will be collected to t he nearest ¼” and 
weight will be collected to the nearest pound.  The participant will then complete a 
Demographics and LBP history questionnaire, the Numeric Pain  Rating Scale (NRS ), and the 
MODQ . Participant eligibility of MODQ  ≥ 20%  score and at least 3 functional activities limited 
due to LBP will be confirmed. Next, the participant will be examined by a licensed, trained RPT 
who will use a standardized exam to classify the participant’s LBP based on the MSI 
classification system.51,76 -79 The participant then will complete additional self -report measures 
and laboratory testing. Because all baseline testing occurs before  randomization, research 
personnel involved in testing will be blinded  to the participant’s treatment assignment throughout 
the study.  
 
Laboratory Measures  
Participants will perform functional activity tests that (1) parallel activities reported as 
problem atic for the majority of participants in prior studies, and (2) have been examined 
previously.  Retroreflective markers will be taped to the skin at predetermined locations on the 
participant’s trunk, pelvis and legs. Data from [ADDRESS_924981] will be  captured. LBP will be 
recorded during each trial.   
5.3 Randomization  
The sample will be stratified based on LBP classification. After baseline assessment, a 
participant will be assigned randomly, within his strata, to either the (1) MST  with no booster, (2) 
MST  with booster, (3) SFE with no booster, or (4) SFE with booster  condition . The purpose of 
stratification by [CONTACT_682977] o f classification and treatment.  Note that it 
is not our goal to determine if LBP classification moderates treatment impact; there will not be a 
sufficient number of subjects in some LBP classifications to address that issue with adequate 
power.  Randomization  will be conducted using a computer -generated list of random numbers 
provided by [CONTACT_682978] . The randomization scheme will be prepared before  initiation 
of the trial and will be adhered to throughout  the trial. Assignments will be performed wit hin the 
REDCap system once the Screening & Randomization form is completed.  When the participant 
with LBP is enrolled, and assigned a group, the R C will print the computer -generated group 
assignment and schedule the participant with the appropriate therapi [INVESTIGATOR_682925] [ADDRESS_924982] clinic visit should be scheduled within one week  of the laboratory  visit. The participant will 
not be blinded to treatment assignment, but will be blinded to his assignment to booster/no 
booster until completion of Laboratory Visit 3  (the 6 month visit).  
5.4 Laboratory Visit 2 & [ADDRESS_924983] -
treatment follow -ups. All participants will be reminded not to discuss the details of their 
treatment with blinded  research personnel so that blinding  to treatment assignment is 
 
 maintained.  Laboratory Visit 2  will be schedu led within one week after discharge from the 
treatment phase. Laboratory Visit 3  will be scheduled 6 months following Laboratory Visit 2 .  
 
6. Treatment Protocol  
6.1 Overview  
Both treatment groups will participate in a 1 -hour treatment, once a week for six  weeks.  Each 
group will also be given a home program to perform during the entire 12 -month study period.  All 
treatments will be provided by [CONTACT_156600][INVESTIGATOR_682926]. 
The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682927] , but are blinded to booster/no booster 
assignment until the participant completes Laboratory Visit 3 . None of the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_11437], however, 
will be involved in either (1) collecting baseline or follow -up data, or (2) laboratory meetings  with 
research personnel. In the initial phase of treatment, both groups will be provided the same 
amount of time in treatment. Documentation of treatment prescription and progress is 
standardized (including harm). This documentation will be used to track treatment fidelity. Rules 
for prescribing and instructions for performing treatment items are standardized and 
documented; instructions with photos will be available in hard copy.  
6.2 Motor Skill Training  (MST)  
The motor skill training involves supervised , massed practice of novel, challenging functional 
activities. The overarching principle of training is that the participant needs to practice 
performing the functional activities in ways that (1) minimize use of the participant’s specific, 
stereotypic lum bopelvic movement and alignment patterns  (based on the participant’s LBP 
classification) , and (2) encourage use of other joints (thoracic spi[INVESTIGATOR_050], hips, knees) to complete 
the activity painlessly.  The lumbopelvic patterns related to the participant’s specifi c LBP 
classification  identified during the laboratory examination  (flexion, extension, rotation, extension 
& rotation, or flexion & rotation) will be targeted. We will use information about the participant’s 
LBP classification to guide the training because  (1) our data suggest there is added benefit to 
classification -based training, (2) a meta -analysis of treatment studies showed that individualized 
treatment provides added benefit to outcome, and (3) there is evidence supporting the existence 
of LBP subgro ups. Participants will be educated that the primary contributors to their LBP 
symptoms are repeated movements and prolonged positions of the lumbopelvic movement 
patterns related to their specific LBP classification.  Additionally, participants will be educ ated 
that the emphasis of treatment is to learn how to modify or change how they perform their daily 
activities so that they do not use these patterns repeatedly throughout the day. During practice, 
the participant will  be given cues for using the trunk muscles needed to facilitate a correct 
lumbopelvic pattern.  Thus, rather than prescribing exercises for individual trunk muscles, we will 
attempt to modify how the participant uses multiple trunk muscles within the context of the 
activity in which they wil l be used.  Such an approach should facilitate the use of these muscles 
in daily functional activities and contribute to enhanced adherence.  
 
Specific a ctivities are selected for a participant to practice if performing them is painful or difficult 
because of his LBP. To enhance salience, the participant will be involved in selection of the 
activities to be practiced. In addition, a pre -determined set of activities will be included for all 
participants because we know from prior studies that those activities  are difficult for most people 
with chronic LBP to perform. The set of activities parallels the functional activities that will be 
tested in the laboratory. Three activities will be practiced for ~[ADDRESS_924984] 3 essential components: (1) contraction of groups 
of specific trunk muscles, (2) earlier and greater movement of the hip, knee, and/or thoracic 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_682928], (3) later and less movement of the lumbar spi[INVESTIGATOR_682929]. The muscles that need to be activated and the directions of movement and 
 
 alignment that need to be modified will be specific to the participant’s LBP classification. Within 
each activity, the conditions of practice will vary. For exam ple, sit ↔ stand will involve practicing 
with various (1) seat surface heights, (2) seating materials, and (3) constraints of surroundings. 
The order in which activities are practiced will be randomized.  All participants will practice 
simple activities (e. g., moving in bed) before complex activities (e.g., gardening). The level of 
difficulty of the activity will be graded to match the motor capabilities of the participant and 
progressed based on ability to (1) verbalize the key concept for that skill (2) appropriately modify 
the movement or alignment and ( 3) control LBP symptoms during performance  of [ADDRESS_924985] shown that motor learning and related neuroplasticity can be 
hindered. Second, if t he stereotypic patterns do contribute to the participant’s LBP, modification 
of the patterns should alleviate the LBP. Inability to perform the activity without pain could mean 
the pattern has not been fully modified. Third, increased pain levels during ex ercise are 
associated with poor adherence.  A home program will be prescribed of 1 -2 sets of 5 -10 
repetitions of formal practice of the activities practiced in treatment sessions.  
 
An abdominal brace or tape can be used with any skill as indicated based on the participant’s 
LBP classification and severity level. The use of a brace or tape is optional. Performing the skill 
without the brace or tape would make the skill more difficult. The decision to use or not use a 
brace or tape can be used in grading the skill. Some participants may need to always use a 
brace or tape for performance of specific skills . If the patient sits for prolonged periods of time, 
has anatomy that makes him vulnerable to poor positioning or any other factors th at would 
contribute to making adherence  to the positioning recommendation difficult, providing 
positioning devices is appropriate and should be considered.  
6.3 Strength and Flexibility Exercise  (SFE) 
Exercises for trunk strength and trunk and lower extrem ity flexibility  commonly cited in the 
literature as being appropriate for people with chronic LBP and included in the previous trial will 
be used. The overall goals of treatment will be to increase the participant’s trunk strength and 
trunk and lower limb flexibility; if necessary, equipment will be provided. Participants will be 
educated on possible contributors to pain, including poor posture, stress, loss of strength and 
flexibility,  and general decline in physical fitness. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682930] , and 
participants will not be educated about their LBP classification . Additionally, participants will be 
educated  about the benefits of strength and flexibi lity exercises and the expectation that 
performance of these exercises will improve performance in daily activities limited by [CONTACT_682979]. 
Participants will be instructed that muscle soreness is expected with performance of new 
exercises.  
 
Strengthening exercises will target all trunk muscles. Flexibility exercises will target all trunk and 
lower limb motions. Treatment is divided into [ADDRESS_924986] will assess  the participant’s independence in performance of the 
exercises  and if the participant has met the criteria to advance to the next phase . Progression of 
exercise will be based on independence in: knowledge of the key concept  (purpose of the 
exercise) , corr ect performance  without cues , and performance of the maximum number of 
 
 repetitions of each of the exercises  (4 repetitions of 30 second holds for stretching and 3 sets of 
10 repetitions for strengthening) .  
6.[ADDRESS_924987] clinicians will be trained by [CONTACT_978]  [INVESTIGATOR_1238] a co-
investigator with expertise in motor learning . Clinicians will be provided with training manuals 
describing the treatment procedures in detail for each condition. Clinician proficiency in 
delivering the treatment will be assessed with practical examinations administered yearly by [CONTACT_42020]-investigator  (MST)  or the RPT ( SFE). Clinician knowledge of treatment protocols will be 
assessed yearly with written examinations. Treatment fidelity will also be monitored by [CONTACT_682980]. The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_682931]. The 
treating clinicians will not discuss any participants’ names or other identifying information during 
these meetings to maintain blinding.  
 
7. Treatment Visit Procedures  
7.[ADDRESS_924988]’s  documentation of the visit.  It is acceptable if  
the participant requires more time this first visit  for initial education and instruction , the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682932]  [ADDRESS_924989] should review the participant’s Clinic 
Visit 1 folder that includes all of the information from Laboratory Visit 1 . This includes the 
following forms:  (1) Medical Screening, (2) Demographics , LBP and medical history, (3) NRS, 
(4) SF -36, (5) MODQ , (6) Absenteeism & Presenteeism, (7) FABQ, and (8) Clinical Examination 
Data (History and Physical).  The clinical examination data related to a participant’s LBP 
classification is deleted from the forms for the clinicians providing the SFE treatment. This is 
done to maintain blinding of a clinician to a participant’s LBP classification. There should also be 
a Clinic Visit  1 form and a Treatment Progress Table appropriate to the participant’s treatment 
group.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682933] -up clinic visits.  
 
Initial Interaction  
While the par ticipant is waiting for treatment to be initiated, the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682934]: (1) the NRS, and (2) the MODQ . The participant’s 
progress since Laboratory Visit [ADDRESS_924990]  will then (1)  provide the 
overview of the trial and the specific treatment c ondition and (2) explain the overall goals of the 
treatment condition.  
 
Treatment  
Treatment during Clinic Visit  [ADDRESS_924991] of (1) an explanation of Educational 
Concepts/ Principles, and (2) treatment  based on the treatment condition  assignment . At the end 
of Visit 1 the participant  is provided with (1) handouts  for initiation of the  home exercise program 
(HEP), (2) the Daily Treatment Adherence Log to be filled out during the days between vis its, (3) 
an explanation of how to the complete the Daily Treatment Adherence Log,  and (4) the 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]’s contact [CONTACT_682981] a visit, has any 
questions , or experiences a worsening of status.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682935] 1 in 
 
 the participant’s chart on the Clinic Visit  [ADDRESS_924992] should provide the participant with the (1) NRS, (2) MODQ , and (3) Educational 
Principles quiz to be completed before treatment is initiated.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682936], 
MODQ , Daily Treatment Adherence Log and Educational Principles quiz as well as events since 
the last visit.  The participant’s questions are answered and treatment is reviewed and 
progressed.  Education is focused on principles not understood based on quiz perfo rmance. The 
majority of time should be spent on the exercises.  The participant is given updated handouts of 
the HEP as needed, a Daily Treatment Adherence Log , and is reminded of the next visit date 
and time.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682937] i n the participant’s chart on the Clinic 
Follow -Up Visit documentation form (including the time spent in treatment) and the Treatment 
Progress Table.   
 
Each clinic visit needs to be at least 5 calendar days to no more than 2 weeks after the previous 
clinic visit.  If a participant is up to 30 minutes late to his/her clinic visit and the clinician cannot 
treat for the full hour, he/she should treat for [ADDRESS_924993] as to whether the visit will be completed  or rescheduled .  
7.3 Final Visit  
On the final visit, the participant’s HEP should be reviewed so that the participant knows what 
he is expected to continue upon discharge. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_355237] e ncourage the participant to 
continue to be active and continue with exercises regularly as prescribed. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682938] e participant has schedule d his follow -up laboratory visit.  The participant should be 
remind ed that he will be receiving monthly follow -up surveys via email which he will be paid to 
complete. The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682939] a  status change after discharge.  The participant’s follow -up lab oratory  visit 
should be with in the week after discharge from the treatment phase.  
7.4 Booster Phase  
The booster phase will occur 6 months after discharge from the initial treatment. Participants will 
be randomized to a booster condition (their original condition -specific treatment) o r a no booster 
condition  at the initial laboratory visit . The participant is told his assignment to boosters 
(booster/no booster) at completion of Laboratory Visit 3  (the 6 month visit). Each booster 
session will be [ADDRESS_924994] of review/practice of the 
home program from the initial treatment phase. The number of sessions will be based on the 
number needed to attain independence in the prescribed treatment items , with a maximum of [ADDRESS_924995] 
the referring provider and inform him/her that the participant will be receiving additional  
treatment sessions.  
 
 7.[ADDRESS_924996]  and SFE, a worsening of symptoms is defined as an increase in the intensity of 
LBP symptoms or peripheralization of symptoms (symptoms located more laterally and /or 
distall y from the original location) that lasts for greater than [ADDRESS_924997] if there is a worsening of status (worsened symptoms or red flag s are present) or if the 
participant is concerned for any reason about his status. If the participant reports a worsening of 
symptoms (as operationally defined) , the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682940] a change in activity lev el, specific activities, work conditions, sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_285816], 
etc. If worsening appears to be caused by [CONTACT_682982] 24 hours and encouraged to use pain relieving techniques. These include using 
medicatio ns as prescribed by [CONTACT_542883], and application of cold if within 48 hours of 
worsening or heat if greater than 48 hours since worsening. After the 24 hours has passed, the 
participant should begin the exercises /skills  being practiced, starting with 1 exercise /skill the first 
day. The participant should add 1 exercise /skill per day and report to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682941] /skill increases his symptoms. In the SFE condition an increase in symptoms during 
exerc ise is not contraindicated and the participant should continue. If a particular exercise /skill 
appears to cause a worsening, the participant should be instructed not to perform that specific 
exercise /skill until the next visit. Performance will then be rev iewed and modified as needed. If 
the participant feels that certain exercises /skills  are worsening his symptoms, these should be 
stopped until the next visit. These, however, typi[INVESTIGATOR_682942]’s status if performed c orrectly, so these exercises should specifically be reviewed for 
correct performance at the treatment visit. If red flags are present, the participant should contact 
[CONTACT_682983] -up and contact [CONTACT_682984][INVESTIGATOR_682943].  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682944].  
7.6 Adherence/Non -Adherence During Treatment Period  
All participants should be encouraged to actively participate in their treatment pro gram across 
the [ADDRESS_924998] her 
directly to discuss strategies, making sure to not identify the participant so t hat blinding can be 
maintained.  
 
8. Human Protection (HRPO)  
8.[ADDRESS_924999] the participant’s ID number.  No names or identifying 
information will be on the paperwork or the chart when the participant’s chart is filed away for 
the day.  In the instance there is a name [INVESTIGATOR_97857], the treating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682945] a black mar ker. Charts will be kept in a locked file drawer that is only 
accessible to the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682946] . 
8.2 Visit Documentation  
All documentation for each visit will be completed the day of the visit . This includes the clinic 
visit form and the  Treatment Progress Table. Chart audits will be conducted throughout the 
study period to ensure adherence to the protocols and complete data sets per participant per 
measure.  For this reason, the charts should always be up to date  and locke d in the designa ted 
filing area . 
 
 8.3 Blinding, Contamination, and Privacy Issues  
Blinding  
There can be no discussion of participants’ names when interacting with research personnel.  All 
research personnel are to remain blinded across the study period to all participants’ treatment 
condition assignment.  Research personnel include the following: ( 1) the Principal Investigator, 
(3) the Research Physical Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and ( 3) the Research Assistant.  All paperwork associated 
with the treatment of the participant must be coded with  a participant ID number.  The Research 
Coordinator  is unblinded to the participant’s treatment condition assignment, and can be 
contact[CONTACT_682985] . 
 
Privacy Issues  
Risks of confidentiality: All participants will be informed of HIPAA and will be given written 
information reiterating HIPAA regulations. All people at the clinic and laboratory sites have been 
trained in HIPAA regulations and procedures. All people interacting with the participant will be 
reminded of the HIPAA proced ures across the study period so that confidentiality is maintained. 
The clinical and laboratory sites have also been set up to comply with HIPAA regulations. All 
data forms (hard copy or electronic) will be  immediately coded and personal identification 
information will be  removed. All hard copy data forms are stored in a locked cabinet. Only 
research personnel authorized to access data for the proposed project will have access to the 
locked cabinet. Informed consent forms will be kept in the PI’s office in a locked cabinet 
separate from the data forms. All data collected at the clinical site will be coded and identifying 
information removed immediately. Data will be stored in a locked file cabinet at the site. A 
member of the research personnel  will pi[INVESTIGATOR_682947]. Only the participating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682948] . Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_682949], with other participants in the study, or with research perso nnel blinded to treatment 
condition assignment . In addition, the institution in which the clinic  is housed ha s agreed to 
adhere to all guidelines for protection of human subjects outlined by [CONTACT_18121].  
8.4 Log of Adverse Events  
All adverse events (AE) should  be documented on the AE form . Serious adverse events (SAE) 
should be immediately reported to the research personnel.  The research personnel will report 
the SAE directly to the IRB using the following protocol set forth by [CONTACT_682986]: a) death  within 24 hours, and b) 
all other internal events w ithin [ADDRESS_925000] as an internal Data and Safety Monitoring 
Committee (DSMC) to monitor the progress of the study and the procedures for ma intaining the 
integrity and safety of data collection, processing, and analysis procedures as well as the 
reporting of adverse events.  A professor in the Program in Occupational Therapy and the 
Department of Neurological Surgery  and a professor in the Prog ram in Physical Therapy and 
 
 the Department of Radiology  will provide expertise in the area of the overall integrity of the 
research process, and in particular, maintenance of the integrity of the data collection and 
analysis process.  A physician and associ ate professor in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery 
and the Department of Neurology with a specialty in spi[INVESTIGATOR_682950] , function as the medical 
monitor , and guide the committee with regard to actions necessary for dealing with and 
reporting any adverse events . The PI , and other Co -Investigators as appropriate, will meet with 
the DSMC  two times a year to review progress of the data collection process, evaluate any 
unanticipated or anticipated side effects of participation in the study, and monitor the integrity 
and the accuracy of the data generated from the study. The biostatistics te am will be 
responsible for overseeing the presentation of data at the DSMC meetings.  In particular, The PI , 
the biostatistics team  and other members of the research team will present recruitment and data 
issues and analyses at each meeting.  Reports will be  kept of each meeting and kept on record 
in the PI ’s laboratory.  The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_682951].  In addition to data and safety monitoring by [CONTACT_90398], adverse events will be re ported to the Washington University Human Research 
Protection Office (HRPO) by [CONTACT_079] [INVESTIGATOR_874] [ADDRESS_925001] 
modifiers, prescribe and progress treatment, and describe the sample. The measures were 
chosen to capture the important dimensions recommended for the study of people  with LBP. All 
self-report measures will be collected using the automated, web -based system. The Time Table 
for Administration includes information about the time points of administration. The total 
administration time for all study measures is ~3 hours. A ll participants will receive a subset of 
self-report measures monthly that require ~[ADDRESS_925002] ionnaire  (MODQ ): The primary outcome variable  is the 10 -
item MODQ , a disease -specifi c measure that provides an index of a participant’s perceived 
LBP-related functional limitation. The scale for the MODQ  ranges from 0 -100; [ADDRESS_925003] level of limitation. The MODQ  is reliable, valid, and sensitive to change.  
 
Numeric Pain R ating Scale  (NRS): An 11 -point scale (0 -10) will be used to measure current 
pain, as well as average and worst pain over the prior 7 days; larger numbers indicate more 
intense pain. NRS measurements are reliable, valid, can be treated as ratio scale data, and 
provide sufficient levels of discrimination to describe pain intensity at varying levels of acuity.  
 
 9.3 Adherence  to Home Program  
During both the initial treatment phase and the booster phase, a standardized self -report 
measure of daily treatment adhe rence will be used. Participants will use a Visual Analog Scale 
(VAS) to indicate the percentage of the treatment they were able to perform as prescr ibed within 
a specific time interval (e.g., daily). The scale ranges from 0 -100% with higher values indicating 
higher adherence.  This measure will also be used to quantify adherence as part of the monthly, 
web-based, self -reports.

Treatment Preference Assessment Measure  (TPA) 
Background/Purpose: This questionnaire is designed to provide information about  a 
participant’s treatment preferences and the participant’s perceptions of four attributes of each 
treatment: effectiveness, acceptability, suitability/ appropriateness, and convenience. The 
questionnaire is modified from a preference questionnaire des igned by [CONTACT_591408]87 to reflect 
the treatments provided in the trial.  
Time points of administration:  Laboratory Visit 1 , before randomization  
Procedure:  The two treatment descriptions will be given in a random order to each part icipant. 
First, the RA will inform the participant that she is interested in learning about his perception of 
each treatment. Second, the RA will read the description of the first treatment option. The RA 
will read the description slowly, clearly, and in a n unbiased manner, in order to facilitate 
understanding. Third, the RA will ask the participant to rate the attributes of the treatment option 
just described. Fourth, the RA will repeat the three steps as they relate to the second treatment 
option. Fifth, the RA will ask the participant if he has a preference for either of the two treatment 
options, and if so, which one.  
Scoring : The four treatment attributes ( effectiveness, acceptability, suitability/appropriateness, 
and convenience ) will be  rated on a 5 -point Likert scale (0 -4). A total scale score for each 
treatment will be  computed as the mean of the four attribute ratings . Whether  the participant 
prefers one of the two treatments will be  recorded as yes/no. If the participant has a preference, 
then his preferred treatment will be  recorded as MST  or SFE.

10. Data Management  
10.1 Data Management Overview  
The biostatistics team will oversee all activities . The PI  [INVESTIGATOR_682959]. The research biostatistician  will prepare web -based forms for data 
entry and editing, oversee data entry, write programs for data validation, manage the security 
and privacy of the electronic forms a nd data sets, prepare data sets for analysis, create 
progress reports, and provide for regular, secure back up of data. We will use a secure 
database created using  Research Electronic D ata Capture ( REDCap) tools hosted by 
[CONTACT_682991].  
 
 10.[ADDRESS_925015], analyses of data from our prior trial 
indicate correlations among the MODQ  scores collected at different times averaged .49. The 
calcul ations based on a single time period thus provide a conservative estimate and “worst 
case” approach to determining sample size.  90 The power analysis assumed 1) the basic 4 
group (Treatment x Booster) design (3 df), 2) inclusion of 3 additional predictors (e.g., age, 
adherence, classification; 3 df), 3) an interaction component reflecting how the effect of 
treatment could depend on o ther predictors (9 df), 4) attrition of 20%, 5) a .05 level of 
significance (two -tailed), and 6) minimum power of .80. The chosen power value is the common 
standard used in most power analyses. Using the target effect of [ADDRESS_925016] by [CONTACT_682992] a specific aim, we will be able to explore such moderation by [CONTACT_682993]. Note also that there are a large 
number of potential moderators that could be included in the statistical model (Tab.1), but we 
made provisions for including [ADDRESS_925017] the presence of outliers or the need for 
transformations. Resampling procedures (e.g., bootstrappi [INVESTIGATOR_007]) will be used if appropriate 
transformations are not possible.91-93 Basic descriptive statistics for each measure and the inter -
correlati ons among variables will provide a simple initial view of the sample characteristics. 
Similarly, simple univariate analyses (e.g., t -tests, chi -square) will be used to examine simple 
group differences. Major analyses to examine the specific aims will use h ierarchical linear 
modeling, described in detail later.   Stage 2 . To ensure that subjects are representative, the 
baseline characteristics (e.g., age, gender) of the sample will be compared to those eligible to 
participate in the study, but who refused to participate.   Stage [ADDRESS_925018] 
differences between booster conditions nor any significant Treatmen t Group x Booster Group 
interactions.   Stage 4 . Because of the large number of outcome measures, steps will be taken to 
control inflation of the Type I error rate. Primary hypotheses will be tested with an uncorrected 
alpha level of .05, as is warranted by  [CONTACT_2030] a priori  nature.94 Other hypotheses will be examined 
using Bonferroni corrected alpha levels.   Stage 5 . The primary an alyses will be based on the 
 
 intention to treat approach. In this approach, all subjects who are randomized to a particular 
treatment condition will be analyzed as part of that treatment group, regardless of subsequent 
events (e.g., lost to follow -up).95  Stage 6 . Missing data can be handled in a v ariety of ways 
(e.g., last value forward, multiple imputation), but each method has potential biases and makes 
assumptions about the underlying basis for the missing data and other features of the data that 
are present. Without prior knowledge of the missi ng data process, we will explore the 
implications of applying different strategies.96-98  
 The major statistical approach for testing the Specific Aims will be hierarchical linear 
modeling (HLM).99-101 This approach is well suited to longitudinal data that contain spacing of 
measures that can vary across subjects, missing data patterns that can vary across time and 
subjects, inclusion of time -varying covariates (e.g. , adherence), and outcomes that can be either 
continuous (e.g., MODQ ) or categorical (e.g., use of medication). These complexities limit the 
use of standard repeated measure analyses (e.g., ANOVA) that require fixed spacing of 
measures and complete data or  are designed for particular kinds of outcomes (e.g., normally 
distributed continuous variables).  
For longitudinal data, HLM models the data at 2 levels: change over time at the level of the 
individual, and, between -individual moderators of the change traj ectories. These are referred to 
as Level 1 and Level 2 models respectively. At Level 1, the data for each individual is conceived 
as follows (using MODQ  as the example outcome):  In this 
model, π0i is the intercept or level of the outcome when time is 0 (which depends on how the 
data are centered, described later) for person i, π1i is the linear time parameter (at the centering 
point) and π2i is the quadratic time parameter. Based on analyses from o ur recent trial, this basic 
quadratic model will be sufficient for estimating the time course of outcomes. Importantly, this 
basic model can be expanded to include other predictors that are collected over time, such as 
adherence, allowing investigation of interactions that could, for example, detect the differential 
effect of adherence over time on MODQ  scores.  
 The Level 1 coefficients become the outcomes at Level 2 and are predicted by [CONTACT_682994]. These include the treatment group s to which subjects are assigned as 
well as history and demographic variables that can be expected to influence the time course of 
outcomes. The Level 2 model can be 
illustrated as follows: For exa mple, the 
model for π1i tests whether the linear 
change in outcome at the centering point differs  from 0 (β10), differs for subjects in the 2 
treatment groups ( β11), differs for subjects in the 2 booster conditions ( β12), jointly influenced by 
[CONTACT_682995] (the interaction,  β13), and varies as a function of age ( β14). 
Treatment group and booster group would be represented by [CONTACT_682996].  The age predictor 
is simply illustrative of how predictors other than treatment can be incorporated  into the Level 2 
model. The other Level 2 equations are interpreted similarly, but refer to prediction of the Level 
1 intercept ( π0i) or the Level 1 quadratic component ( π2i) and test the overall magnitude of the 
outcome or the departure from linearity, r espectively. The latter is important, for example, in 
detecting whether the booster treatment can reduce the reversal of improvement that we 
observed at 12 months in our recent clinical trial.  
The interpretation of the Level 1 intercept ( π0i) and Level 1 l inear component ( π1i) depend on 
how the Level 1 data are centered. If, for example, time is centered at 6 months, then the 
intercept is the expected magnitude of the outcome at 6 months and the linear component is the 
rate of change at that time point (the  tangent to the curve at the centering point). We will 
analyze the data at multiple centering points to allow full exploration of the nature of change 
over time and to detect treatment and booster condition differences at particular time points.  
Specific A im 1 will focus on the effects of treatment on outcomes (coefficients β01, β11, β21) 
and examine how LBP (H R1a), functional limitation (H R1b), use of LBP medication/healthcare 
services (H R1c), levels of adherence (H R1d) and movement and alignment patterns (HR1e)

 change over time and, in particular, as a function of treatment group.  Specific Aim 2 will focus 
on booster group effects and examine how function and adherence are influenced by [CONTACT_682997] (coefficients β02, β12, β22) and how this may be  moderated by [CONTACT_682998] (i.e., Treatment x Booster interactions, 
coefficients β03, β13, β23). Specific Aim 3 will focus on two additional moderators, adherence and 
movement and alignment patterns.  These will be incorporated at Level 1 because they will be 
collected repeatedly. To add a measure of adherence would modify the model as follows:  
 The coefficient,  π3i, then is modeled at Level [ADDRESS_925019] of treatment group can be investigated (H R3a for adherence, H R3b for 
movement and alignment patterns).  
 Economic analyses will focus on direct and indirect health costs. Direct health costs will be 
measured from the payer perspective. We will es timate the cost of medication using both the 
average wholesale price (AWP) and the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) and assume that 
medication is used as prescribed. The cost of health services and medical equipment will be 
estimated using the Medicare all owable. Resources for which there is no AWP, WAC, or 
Medicare allowable will be estimated from a review of average retail prices. Analysis of the 
healthcare costs over time as a function of treatment will use the same HLM procedures 
proposed for our primar y outcome measure, with the particular approach (e.g., generalized 
linear modeling) depending on the underlying sampling distribution (e.g., normal, Poisson). We 
will measure indirect health costs using absenteeism and presenteeism questionnaires. As with 
the measurement of expenditures, we will use HLM methods to evaluate the association 
between the treatment condition and days (or hours) lost (absenteeism and presenteeism will 
be evaluated separately) over time. As these data are counts, it is likely that  a Poisson or 
negative binomial model will be necessary.

 Changes to planned analyses  
The original protocol called for analysis with hierarchical linear modeling to model repeated 
measures without requiring ti me between samples to be constant.  However, times between 
samples were sufficiently consistent to allow use of repeated measures analysis of variance 
(ANOVA).  The original protocol intended analysis of moderators, but moderators were not 
included due to strong treatment effects seen in the MODQ  scores. 
 
Primary Outcome Analyses  
For MODQ, our primary  outcome measure , mixed random effect repeated measures 
analyses were conducted separately on each phase (treatment and follow -up) with participant 
as a random effect and a first order autoregressive covariance structure to account for 
correlation between time points.  The baseline MODQ score was used as a covariate in both 
models to control for baseline participant differences. Booster treatments after follow -up month 
[ADDRESS_925039] subsequent MODQ scores, therefore treatment estimates from data after month 
6 were created  from combined booster and no  booster groups within treatment.  These 
analyses were intent -to-treat and used all data available.  Mean estimates for single time points 
were model based (unless otherwise noted).  No missing data imputation was done.  No 
adjustments for multiple comparisons for secondary outcomes were made.  
 
Secondary Outcome Analyses  
For average and worst NRS  pain scores, SF -[ADDRESS_925040] repeated measures analysis (SAS mixed procedure) 
with baseline outcome values included as covariates, and with participant within treatment as a 
random effect.  Some variables were transformed to stabilize vari ance.  Number and length of 
acute flare -ups of LBP in the past 6 months  were transformed with natural log (x+1).  The 
Stanford Presenteeism Scale WOS was transformed with natural log (101 – WOS).  Adherence 
to the home program was transformed with a logit function, natural log [x/(100 -x)].  Contrasts of 
SFE – MST for transformed variables were back -transformed to their original scale and 
confidence intervals were simulated from Least Square means then back -transformed.  
Current medication use for LBP, absent eeism from usual activities, the Stanford 
Presenteeism Scale WAS , health professional care seeking for LBP, and equipment use for 
LBP contained many 0 records which required transformation to a dichotomous scale and 
analysis using a mixed generalized linea r model (SAS glimmix procedure) with a logit link and 
binomial distribution.  Current medication use for LBP  had a first order autoregressive 
covariance structure, but the others had compound symmetry.  Contrasts for these variables are 
reported as odds ra tios. 
Within treatment contrasts for the effect of booster on change between pre -booster ( follow 
up months 1 through 6) and post -booster ( follow up months 7 through 12) are reported on the 
transformed scale (due to the correlation between pre - and post -booster estimates).  Back -
transformed least square means are reported on the original scale of each variable.  
 
Summary of Changes to the Protocol  
Major protocol changes are included . 
January, 2014 Clinic Visit  1 can  be scheduled within two week s of Laboratory  Visit 1. Laboratory 
Visit 2 can be scheduled within two weeks of Clinic Visit 6.  
June, 2014 Laboratory Visit 3  can be scheduled within the 2 week period surrounding 6 months 
following Laboratory Visit 2.  
 
 September, 2014 Individuals who do  not qualify at Laboratory Visit 1  because  MODQ is <[ADDRESS_925041] (medication and 
health services use and medical equipment) and indirect (absenteeism and present eeism) 
health costs are not to be conducted. The decision was based on large budget cuts that limited 
our ability to financially support the personnel to conduct the analyses.  
May, [ADDRESS_925042] a current 
symptomatic disc herniation (current symptoms below the knee). People with fibromyalgia, 
Marfan syndrome, and Graves’ disease are excluded.  
January, [ADDRESS_925043] 6 months had valid data. The 
data for 37 of 77 individuals who reported having recurrences of LBP did not meet the definition 
for recurrences ( increase i n LBP symptoms of at least a 2/[ADDRESS_925044] 30 days of no symptoms ). Given the questionable validity 
of the responses, the recurrence data will not be reported.

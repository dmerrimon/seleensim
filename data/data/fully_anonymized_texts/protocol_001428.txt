Title:   APhase 2 Open Label Extension Study of Conatumumab and AMG 479
Study Phase:   2
Indication:   Subjects who have completed a separate [COMPANY_010] -sponsored conatumumab or 
AMG 479 study  and will continue treatment according to the parent study.
Primary Objective:   To provide ongoing treatment with:
conatumumab therapy, with or without co-therapy (chemotherapy with and without 
bevacizumab , or AMG 479 )for subjects who are eligible, according to the parent study, to 
receive their next dose of conatumumab , or
AMG 479therapy alone , forsubjects who are eligible, according to the parent study, to 
receive the irnext dose of AMG 479 .
Secondary Objective(s):   To evaluate the safety profile ,including adverse events and serious 
adverse events, of:
conatumumab, with or without co-therapy , or
AMG 479 alone .  
Hypotheses:   The purpose of this study is to provide a mechanism  for subjects to continue to 
receive treatment with conatumumab and/or AMG 479. 
Study Design
This is a Phase [ADDRESS_299763] completed a 
separate [COMPANY_010] -sponsored conatumumab or AMG 479 studyto cont inue treatment with 
conatumumab, with or without co-therapy (chemotherapy with and without bevacizumab, or 
AMG 479) , or with AMG [ADDRESS_299764] of care clinical assessment which includes 
collection of vital signs, adverse events, concomitant medications, and laboratory samples and 
results .  Radiological assessments to evaluate disease extent (with change compared to nadir 
from the parent protocol) should be performed at regular intervals, at a minimum once every 
6 (±1) months or morefrequently if clinically indicated (starting from their last scan on the parent 
protocol) , per standard of care (SOC) at each facility.
Reasons for study discontinuation will include progressive disease, intolerance to investigational 
product(s) , and/or need for additional systemic anticancer treatment.  When a subject 
discontinues the study for any reason, a safety follow -up vis it will be completed at least 
30(+3)days after the last dose of protocol -specified therapy.

more frequently based on institutional guidelines.
Subjects previously enrolled in Study 20070411 will receive conatumumab and/or AMG 479 per 
parent protocol .  AMG 479 18 mg/kg will be administered IV Q3W , unless discontinued during 
treatment on parent protocol .  Subjects previously enrolled in Study 2005011 8will receive 
AMG 479 monotherapy at a dosed of 20 mg/kg IV Q3W  or Q4 W per parent protocol. There will be 
no individual AMG 479 dose reductions, except as outlined below in Table 5, Thromb ocytopenia 
without Bleeding.
The dose (infusion volume) of AMG [ADDRESS_299768]’s actual body 
weight during the study day 1 assessment.  The dose will not need to be recalculated unless the 
actual body weight changes by  10%.  Investigators may recalculate the dose of AMG [ADDRESS_299769] Dosage and A dministration
Subjects previously enrolled in Study 20060464 subjects will be treated with mFOLFOX6 and 
bevacizumab on each of the 14 day (+ 3 days) treatment cycles before infusion of conatumumab 
(2 or 10 mg/kg Q2 W, based on their dose from study 20060464).
Modified FOLFOX6 regimen is a combination therapy of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) administered as a 
2-hour infusion on day 1; leucovorin (400 mg/m2 racemate or 200 mg/m2levo-leucovorin) 
administered as a 2 -hour infusion on day 1; followed by a loading dose of 5 -FU (400 mg/m2) IV 
bolus administered on day 1, then 5- FU (2,400 mg/m2) via am bulatory pump administered for a 
period of 46 -48 hours every 14 days (+ 3 day s).
Administration of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy will commence on day 1 of each treatment cy cle 
and end with a continuous IV infusion of 5- FU.  For the purpose of this protocol, the 
administration of continuous IV infusion of 5 FU will commence aft er conatumumab infusions.  
A new cycle of mFOLFOX6 treatment will be repeated ever y 2 weeks (+ 3 days) .
Bevacizumab will be administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg by [CONTACT_246511] 1 of each 
14 day c ycle (+ 3 day s).  Institutional standards for b evacizumab infusion times may be used.

Statistical Considerations:   
The studies preceding this open label extension are sufficiently different to preclude pooling of 
data over the studies.  Since the number of subjects enrolled per parent study will be low most of 
the data will be shown in listings.  A limited number of su mmary  tables will be produced when the 
number of subjects makes this sensible.
The final analysis of this study will be performed at the end of the study i e,when all the subjects 
have completed or had the opportunity to complete the Day [ADDRESS_299770] disposition (number screened, enrolled into the study, receive conatumumab and/or

CONFIDENTIA L1. OBJECTIVES
1.1 Primary
To provide ongoing treatment with :
conatumumab therapy, with or without co-therapy (chemotherapy with and without 
bevacizumab, or AMG 479) , for subjects who are eligible, according to the parent 
study, to receive their next dose of conatumumab , or  
AMG479therapy alone for subjects who are eligible, according to the parent study, 
to receive their next dose of AMG 479 .
1.2 Secondary
To evaluate the safety profile, including adverse events and serious adverse events, of:
conatumumab, with or without co-therapy , or 
AMG 479 alone .  
2. BACKGROUND A ND RATIONA LE
2.1 Disease
This protocol will include subjects previously enrolled in [COMPANY_010] -sponsored 
conatumumab and AMG 479 studies with different solid tumors, including, but not limited 
to, colorectal cancer (CRC), non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), soft tissue sarcoma 
(STS), non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL), pancreatic cancer, and ovarian cancer.
2.[ADDRESS_299786] Background 
2.2.1 Conatumumab Background 
[IP_ADDRESS] Death Receptor 5 and Cancer
Apoptosis or programmed cell death is an evolutionarily conserved process for removing 
unwanted cells from the body.  Dysregulation of this process contributes to many 
diseases including cancer.  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -related apoptosis -inducing 
ligan d (TRAIL) receptor 2 (TR -2, death- receptor 5 [DR5]) is a member of the tumor 
necrosis factor super -family of receptors.  TRAIL is the natural ligand for DR5; TRAIL 
binding to DR5 initiates an intracellular caspase cascade and induces apoptosis in many 
huma n transformed cell lines but not most normal cells ( Kelly and Ashkenazi, 2004 ).
TRAIL receptor agonists have been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in a variety of 
cancer cell lines with little toxicity to normal cells .  There is also evidence that they may
act cooperatively with existing cancer therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], including targeted agents .  These 
findings suggest that stimulating DR5 could be useful for cancer therapy in combination 
with a range of existing anti -tumor therapi[INVESTIGATOR_85309] a wide variety of tumor types.

Based on noncompartmental analysis of all available PK data, conatumumab exhibited 
doselinear kinetics in the range from 0.3 to 20 mg/kg.  The overall mean (median) 
half-life was 12 (10.7) days.  Therefore, the human PK profile supports intravenous 
administration once every [ADDRESS_299795] human cancers express the type I insulin -like growth factor receptor (IGF -1R;

6. TREATMENT PROCEDURES
Conatumumab and AMG 479 will be the only Investigational Products ( IPs)administered 
in this study. 
Subjects will receive the same regimen they were receiving at the conclusion of their 
parent [COMPANY_010] -sponsored study .  If 1or more co- therapy drugs were permanently 
discontinued or dose -reduced on the parent study , their resumption or re- escalation will 
not be allowed on this study for that particular subject.  If a co -therapy is only being 
temporarily held on the parent protocol, resuming it will be allowed according to standard 
of care guidelines.
Dose adjustments for subjects receiving treatment have been adapted from the parent 
protocols.
6.[ADDRESS_299814]’s actual body weightduring the study day [ADDRESS_299815] be recalculated if actual body weight changes by 10%.   
Investigators may recalculate the doses more frequently based on institutional 
guidelines.
If a subject misses a conatumumab dose, the dose will not be made up at a later date 
and the subject will remain on the original dosing schedule.
Conatumumab preparation will be administered by [CONTACT_233547] a 60 ( 15) 
minutes period.  If the dose administration was well tolerated during the parent protocol, 
administrations may be made over a 30 ( 10) minutes infusion period.  Infusion time

normal saline or 5% dextrose before and after the investigational product administration 
to avoid mixing with other drug products or IV solutions.  Conatumumab should not be 
administered as an IV push injec tion.  If the investigational product extravasates during 
the IV administration, the infusion must be stopped immediately .  The subject may 
develop a reddened area around the site of the infiltration, which is caused by 
[CONTACT_246517] (ie, depot effect) .  
A physician or medical staff involved in study evaluation must be available during the 
administration of the investigational product to assess and treat adverse events that may 
arise during dosing.  Subjects will be monitored in the clinic throughout their infusion for 
any signs of adverse events and for at least 60 minutes after their infusion if previous 
doses of conatumumab were not well tolerated . 
The date, start and end times, and volume of each conatumumab infusion (volume of 
conatumumab plus volume of diluent) will be recorded in the subject’s medical record 
and electronic case report form (eCRF).  Refer to the Investigational Product Instruction 
Manual for details regarding packaging, labeling, storage, preparation and dispensing of 
conatumumab.
[IP_ADDRESS] Subjects Receiving Conatumumab in Monotherapy  
Subjects currently receiving conatumumab monotherapy will continue doing so at the 
same dose.  The dose range in the parent protocols is from 0.3 mg/kg Q2W  to 15 mg/kg 
Q3W.  Subjects will be allowed to switch from a Q2 W dosing to a Q3W  dosing if they so 
desire and their physician is in agreement, but only at the start of this study.  In this 
case, the actual dose to be administered every 3 weeks will be recal culated in order to 
deliver the same weekly dose, according to the formula:
Q3W dose (in mg/kg) = Q2 W dose (in mg/kg) x 1.5
Such change in dosing frequency should be communicated to [COMPANY_010]’s study team.

6.1.2 Conatumumab Premedication
This section applies to all subjects, irrespective of whether they are receiving 
conatumumab in monotherapy or in combination with AMG 479 or chemotherapy.
No specific premedication is required for routine conatumu mab infusions.  If during or 
after any infusion a reaction occurs, pre -medication may be used for subsequent 
conatumumab infusions.  Subjects, who experience any serious infusion reaction (eg, 
dyspnea, chest tightness, fever, rigors or hypotension) during conatumumab 
administration will have the infusion stopped.  Continuation of drug administration will be 
based on the severity and resolution of the event and will be at the discretion of the 
investigator.  Treatment for an infusion reaction may include met hylprednisolone, 
ranitidine, diphenhydramine, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or other drugs, depending on the 
severity of the reaction.  Premedication (eg, antihistamines or corticosteroids) may be 
considered for subsequent administrations in subjects who develop an infusion reaction, 
at the discretion of the investigator.  Suspected infusion reactions should be reported as 
an adverse event.  All subjects who experience such an event will be followed for safety.

[IP_ADDRESS] AMG479 Dosage and Schedule (for Subjects Transferring From 
Protocol 20050118)
Subjects previously enrolled in Study 20050118 will receive AMG 479 monotherapy per 
parent protocol. AMG 479 20 mg/kg will be administered IV Q3 W.  At the discretion of 
the investigator, subjects who have been on the parent study for more than 48 months 
without progression or unacceptable toxicity may continue receiving AMG 479 on an 
extended dosing frequency, to a maximum of Q4W  (± 3days).  Once the extended 
dosing frequency is selected, the dosing schedule must remain the same throughout the 
study. There will be no individual AMG 479 dose reductions, except as outlined below in 
Table 5 , Thrombocytopenia without Bleeding.
6.2.2 AMG479 Premedication
No specific premedication is required for routine AMG 479 infusions.  If during or after 
any infusion a reaction occurs, pre- medication may be used for subsequent AMG 479 
infusions.  Subjects, who experience any serious infusion reaction (eg, dyspnea, chest 
tightness, fever, rigors or hypotension) during AMG [ADDRESS_299839] the 
infusion stopped.  Continuation of drug administration will be based on the severity and 
resolution of the event and will be at the discretion of the investigator.  Treatme nt for an 
infusion reaction may include methylprednisolone, ranitidine, diphenhydramine, atropi[INVESTIGATOR_050], 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], or other drugs, depending on the severity of the reaction.  Premedication 
(eg, antihistamines or corticosteroids) may be considered for subseque nt administrations 
in subjects who develop an infusion reaction, at the discretion of the investigator.  
Suspected infusion reactions should be reported as an adverse event.  All subjects who 
experience such an event will be followed for safety.
6.2.3 AMG479 Toxicity  Management
This section applies subjects receiving AMG 479 alone or in combination with 
conatumumab.

toxicit y, AMG 479 will be permanently discontinued.  Treatment with conatumumab 
should continue Q3 W after AMG 479 has been discontinued due to AMG 479 related 
toxicity.  In the event that treatment with conatumumab is discontinued for any reason 
prior to disease progression, AMG 479 treatment should continue.  If conatumumab has 
been permanently discontinued and /orAMG 479 is the only agent administered, in case 
of AMG 479-related toxicities AMG 479 treatment should be delayed by 1 week

Hypergly cemia and Elevation of Transaminases )
Any grade 4 non -hematologic adverse event (except grade 4 hyperglycemia , and 
transaminase elevations, as discussed below ) deemed related to AMG 479will result in 
the permanent discontinuation of AMG 479.  Subj ects who are diagnosed with a 
symptomatic pulmonary embolism on study treatment must permanently discontinue 
AMG479.  Subjects who are diagnosed with an asymptomatic pulmonary embolism, 
which has been incidentally diagnosed by [CONTACT_60820] , must be 
managed per local regional guidelines and can remain on study treatment at the 
discretion of the investigator (see Section [IP_ADDRESS] for on study anti -coagulation 
management guidelines).
Any grade 3 non -hematologic adverse event deemed related to AMG 479will result in 
AMG479 being withheld until symptoms resolve to grade 1or to the subject’s baseline 
grade . 
[IP_ADDRESS] Anti-coagulation Management
Subjects requiring initiation of therapeutic anti -coagulation treatment while on study 
treatment (eg, for deep venous thrombosis or asymptomatic pulmonary embolism) will 
have AMG479 and/or conatumumab withheld until the therapeutic anti -coagulation 
treatment is stable (eg, on coumadin with an INR of [ADDRESS_299853] 14days). Subjects 
who remain on full dose low molecular heparin (without Coumadin )as therapeutic 
anti-coagulation may restart AMG 479 and/or conatumumab at the discretion of the 
investigator.
Subjects on therapeutic anti -coagulation treatment while being treated with AMG 479 
who develop concurrent grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia regardless of relationship to 
AMG479will permanently disco ntinue AMG 479.
[IP_ADDRESS] AMG479 Related Infusion Reactions
Investigational product pre-medication is not required for routine infusions .  Investigators 
should monitor subjects for signs and symptoms of infusion reactions.  Any subject who 
experiences a grade [ADDRESS_299854]:  Conatumumab and A MG 479
Protocol Number:  20101116
Date:  [ADDRESS_299855] is unable to complete an 
AMG479 infusion on the day of the infusion due to an infusion reaction, then the 
remainder of the infusion will not be made up on subsequent days.
At the discretion of the investigator, treatment for an infusion reaction may include 
solumedrol (50 to80mg IV bolus or equivalent ), ranitidine 50 mg IV bolus (or 
equivalent), diphenhydramine 50 mg IV bolus (or equivalent) .  AMG [ADDRESS_299856] previously experienced an AMG 479 related 
infusion reaction.  The AMG 479 pre -medication that will be used is at the discretion of 
the investigator; however, it is recommended that the investigator consider using any of 
the following AMG 479 pre- medication for future infusions: d examethasone or 
solumedrol, ranitidine, diphenhy dramine or equivalents.  Investigational product 
pre-medications must be recorded in the eCRF.   Subjects treated with steroids while on 
study should be monitored closely for hyperglycemia, as the combination of steroids and 
AMG479 may increase this risk.
Investigators should decrease the AMG 479 infusion rate by 50% (eg ,increase the 
AMG479 infusion duration from 30 to 60 minutes) in subjects who have previously had a 
grade [ADDRESS_299857] had a grade 1 or 2 AMG 479

Protocol 20060464)
Subjects transitioning from the 20060464 study who are on mFOLFOX6/bevaciz umab in 
combination with conatumumab will continue to receive the same regimen with the same 
doses and timing.  The components of the mFOLFOX6 regimen and bevacizumab will 
be administered per standard of care, according to the PI’s clinical judgment and 
institutional guidelines. 
All other protocol -required drugs including, mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab, that are 
commercially available are not provided by [CONTACT_11337] (except if required by [CONTACT_21482]).  The investigator will be responsible for obtaining supplies of these drugs.  
All subjects will be treated with mFOLFOX6 and bevacizumab on each of the 14 day 
(+3days) treatment cycle before infusion of conatumumab .
6.3.1 mFOLFOX6 R egimen
Modified FOLFOX6 regimen is a combination therapy of oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) 
administered as a 2 -hour infusion on day 1; leucovorin (400 mg/m2racemate or 
200mg/m2levo-leucovorin ) administered as a 2 -hour infusion on day 1; followed by a 
loading dose of 5- FU (400 mg/m2) IV bolus administered on day 1, then 5 -FU 
(2,400 mg/m2) via ambulatory pump administered for a period of 46 -48hours every 
14days (+ 3 days).
Administration of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy will commence on day 1 of each treatment 
cycle and end with a continuous IV infusion of 5 -FU.  For the purpose of this protocol, 
the administration of continuous IV infusion of 5 FU will commence after conatumumab
infusions. 
A new cycle of mFOLFOX6 treatment will be repeated every 2 weeks (+ 3 days) but may 
not be administered to the subject if the ANC < 1.0 x109 cells/L; or if the p latelet count is 
<75x109/L; if stomatitis, or diarrhea have not recovered to grade 1; or if fatigue has 
not recovered to grade 2.  Up to a 6 week delay is allowed in the initiation of a new 
cycle of treatment for resolution of toxicities.  A treatmen t delay of one component of the 
mFOLFOX6 regimen (ie, 5 -FU/leucovorin or oxaliplatin) results in a similar delay of the 
other component to allow both therapi[INVESTIGATOR_246502] [ADDRESS_299859]:  Conatumumab and A MG 479

If parameters are not met by [CONTACT_246520], bl ood tests and/or clinical 
evaluations should occur at least weekly to monitor these parameters.  The guideline in 
Section 6.3.2 will be followed for mFOLFOX6/bevacizumab delay and dosing 
resumption.
In the event that mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy or any of its components administration is 
permanently discontinued for any reason prior to disease progression, bevacizumab and 
conatumumab may continue. Investigational product infusions should remain on a once 
every 14 days ( +3 days) schedule until the subject develops disease progression or is 
unable to tolerate conatumumab .
If mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy interruption is [ADDRESS_299861]’s disease has 
not progressed, mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy should be restarted at doses according to 
Table 7, Table 8 , and Table 9.  If mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy interruption is > [ADDRESS_299862]’s disease has not 
progressed, the case should be reviewed by [CONTACT_246521] d etermine the appropriateness of treatment resumption.

5-FU and oxaliplatin may be emetogenic.  Prior to the administration of mFOLFOX6, 
pre-medication with antiemetics, such as serotonin (5HT 3) antagonists (ie, ondansetron, 
or granisetron) with or without dexamethasone may be used at the investigator’s 
discretion or according to institutional standards.

and administered according to the product label or applicable guidelines.
[IP_ADDRESS] Oral Cry otherapy
Subjects receiving oxaliplatin should not receive oral cryotherapy (ie. ice for mucositis 
prophylaxis) on Day 1 of each treatment cycle as this may exacerbate 
laryngopharyngeal dysesthesia caused by [CONTACT_246522].
[IP_ADDRESS] Hypersensitivity
Platinum hypersensitivity can cause dyspnea, bronchospasm, itching and hypoxia.  
Appropriate treatment may include supplemental oxygen, standard epi[INVESTIGATOR_238], 
corticosteroid, antihistamine therapy, bronchodilators or vasopressors.  Platinum 
hypersensitivity is a rare event and should b e treated promptly.
[IP_ADDRESS] Phary ngolary ngeal Dy sesthesias
Oxaliplatin may cause discomfort in the larynx or pharynx associated with dyspnea, 
anxiety and difficulty swallowing .  This discomfort is exacerbated by [CONTACT_119403].  Appropriate 
therapy may include the use of an tihistamine therapy, bronchodilators, cold avoidance or

6.4.2 Bevacizumab Premedication
Any pre- medication for bevacizumab should be administered at the investigator’s 
discretion and must be recorded in the appropriate electronic case report form.
6.4.3 Bevacizumab Toxicity  Management
General toxicities associated with bevacizumab therapy ( Avastin labeling text, 2009 ) 
include bleeding, arterial clots (which could lead to stroke and heart attack), bowel 
perforation, wound healing difficulties , and hypertension. Gastrointestinal perforation 
complicated by [CONTACT_90169] -abdominal abscesses or fistula formation and in some instances 
with fatal outcome, occurs at an increased incidence in subjects receiving bevacizumab. 
If bevacizumab is held due to tox icities, mFOLFOX6 and conatumumab should continue 
as planned and bevacizumab will be restarted at the next cycle of chemotherapy, so 
long as the toxicities have reduced in accordance with the protocol guidelines. Subjects 
will then resume bevacizumab trea tment at the same dose and schedule.
SeeTable 10for management of bevacizumab related toxicities.
For any subject experiencing grade 3 or 4 toxicity that persists for > [ADDRESS_299873] 28 days following major surgery. The surgical incision should be 
fully healed prior to initiation of bevacizumab. The half life of bevacizumab is estimated 
to be 20 days. Treatment should be suspended prior to elective surgery.
6.4.5 Discontinuation of C omponents of mFOLFOX6/ Bevacizumab
Subjects who have intolerance to single or multiple components of the first -line treatment 
regimen (eg, oxaliplatin due to neurotoxicity), should continue all other first -line 
treatment components of the regimen (eg, 5 -FU/leucovorin, bevacizumab, and 
conatumumab ) on a once every 14 days (+ 3 days) schedule.  This modified first -line 
therapy will continue until one of the following occurs: disease progressio n, 
unacceptable adverse events, death, or the withdrawal of consent by [CONTACT_748].

The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre -existing medical condition.  
Worsening indicates the pre -existing medical condition (eg, diabetes, migraine 
headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration, and/or has an 
association with a significantly worse outcome.  A pre -existing condition that has not 
worsened during the study, and involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic 
surgery or a medical procedure while on study is not considered an adverse event.  
Disease progression of the primary tumor itself is not considered an adverse event ; 
however, signs and symptoms of disease progression may be recorded as adverse 
events or serious adverse events.  If a new primary tumor malignancy appears, it will be 
considered an adverse event.
Deaths due to progressive disease during treatment until t he Safety Follow -up Visit or 
30days after the last dose of protocol specified therapy, whichever is later, should be 
recorded as due to the primary tumor.
Interventions for pretreatment conditions (eg, elective cosmetic surgery) or medical 
procedures that were planned before study enrollment are not considered adverse 
events.

the case of subjects who have their first treatment delayed for any reason) through the 
Safety Follow -up Visit or [ADDRESS_299891] dose of protocol -specified therapy are 
collected and reported using the applicable CRF (eg, Adverse Event Summary CRF) .  In 
addition, adverse events that were continuing at the end of the parent study must be 
recorded and followed through to the stop date or the Safety Follow -up Visit.  Adverse 
events should also be collected and recorded in the subject’s medical records and 
serious adverse events should be reco rded on the Serious Adverse Event Report 
(SAER) form.  These adverse events will include the following:
All serious adverse events (as defined in Section 9.2.1 ) that occur after the start of

Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),
Dates of onset and resolution,
Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol],
Assessment of relatedness to conatumumab (and/or AMG 479if applicable) ,and
Action taken.
The adverse event severity grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.[ADDRESS_299894] (s)and/or other study drugs.   This relationship is indicated by a 
“yes” or “no” response to the question:  Is there a reasonable possibility that the event 
may have been caused by [CONTACT_7198] (s)and/or other study drugs ?
The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any 
study -mandated procedure or activity .  This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” 
response to the question:  “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have 
been caused by a study procedure/activity”?
The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining 
whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a change from the 
subject’s baseline values.  In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical 
significance (based on the investigator's judgment) should not be recor ded as adverse 
events.  However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in 
current therapy are considered adverse events.  W here applicable, clinical sequelae (not 
the laboratory abnormality) should be recorded as the adverse event.
The investigator’s clinical judgment will be used to determine whether a subject should 
be removed from treatment or from the study due to an adverse event.  A subject, or 
subject’s parent/legal guardian, may also voluntarily withdraw from treatment due to an 
adverse event.  If the subject withdraws full consent, the subject should be encouraged 
to undergo, at a minimum, the Safety Follow -up Visit.

requires in -patient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_1081],
results in persistent or significant d isability/incapacity,
congenital anomaly/birth defect, and/or
other medically important serious event .
An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]”, if the event 
necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay).  
If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any 
of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the 
criterion of “other medically important serious event ”.  Examples of such events could 
include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, and blood dyscrasias, drug -induced l iver 
injury events that necessitate an emergency room visit, outpatient surgery, or other 
events that require other urgent intervention.
Since the criteria for CTCAE severity differs from the regulatory criteria for serious 
adverse events, if adverse event s correspond to grade 4 “life threatening” CTCAE 
severity criteria (eg, laboratory abnormality reported as grade 4 without manifestation of 
life threatening status), it will be left to the investigator’s judgment to also report these 
abnormalities as serio us adverse events. For any adverse event that applies to this 
situation, comprehensive documentation of the event’s severity status must be recorded 
in the subject’s medical record.

[IP_ADDRESS] Safety  Endpoints
Analyses of safety will be carried out for all subjects who enrolled into this study.
All reported adverse events will be assigned to a system organ class and preferred term 
within a system organ class according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
(MedDRA) version 13.0 or later.  The adverse events (all, serious, and related) will be 
listed by [CONTACT_1130], system organ class, preferred term, and severity.  Further listings will 
show events that were continuing at the end of the parent study, on-study deaths, 
serious and significant adverse events, including early withdraw als due to adverse 
events.
Adverse events will be reported up to [ADDRESS_299903] observed measurement (including change from baseline to each).
[IP_ADDRESS] Tumor Response, Disease Progression and Deaths
Analyses of tum or response, disease progression and deaths will be carried out for all 
subjects who enrolled into this study.
Listings will be provided for tumor response, disease progression, and deaths.  
Overall survival is the time , in months, from randomization into the parent study to the 
day of death.  Subjects who have not died while on the study or are lost to follow -up will 
be censored at the date of last contact .  Subjects who withdraw consent will be censored 
on the date of withdrawal.
Progression- free survival is the time , in months, from randomization /enrollment into the 
parent study to the first observation of disease progression or death due to any cause.  
For the progression -free survival analysis the following censoring strategies for missing 
dates of disease progression will be used :
If a subject’s disease has not progressed and the subject is alive, progression -free 
survival will be censored at the last date they are known to be progression -free (ie, 
the last tumor evaluation date).  
If a subject has no tumor evaluation in either the parent study or the extension study, 
progression -free survival will be censored at the date o f randomization into the 
parent study.

11. REGULA TORY OBLIGATIONS
11.1 Informed Consent
An initial generic informed consent form is provide d for the investigator to prepare the 
informed consent document to be used at his or her site.  Updates to the template will be 
communicated by [CONTACT_246529].  The written 
informed consent document should be prepar ed in the language(s) of the potential 
patient population.
Before a subject’s participation in the clinical study, the investigator is responsible for 
obtaining written informed consent from the subject or legally acceptable representative 
after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study and before any protocol -specific screening procedures or any 
investigational products are administered.  A legally acceptable representative is an 
individual or other body authorized under applicable law to consent, on behalf of a 
prospective subject, to the subject’s participation in the clinical study .  
The investigator is also responsible for asking the subject if the subject agrees to have 
his/her primary care physician informed of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
If the subject agrees to such notification, the investigator shall inform the subject’s 
primary care physician of the subject’s participation in the clinical study .
The acquisition of i nformed consent and the subject’s agreement or refusal of his/her 
notification of the primary care physician should be documented in the subject’s medical 
records, and the informed consent form should be signed and personally dated by [CONTACT_21966] a legally acceptable representative and by [CONTACT_16994].  The original signed informed consent form should be 
retained in accordance with institutional policy, and a copy of the signed consent form 
should be provided t o the subject or legally acceptable representative.
If a potential subject is illiterate or visually impaired and does not have a legally 
acceptable representative, the investigator must provide an impartial witness to read the 
informed consent form to the subject and must allow for questions.  Thereafter, both the

If a pregnancy occurs in a female subject, or female partner of a male subject, while the 
subject is taking protocol -specified product and for 6 months after end of treatment, the 
pregnancy should be reported to [COMPANY_010]’s global Pregnancy Surveillance Program within 7 business days of the site receiving notification of a pregnancy.  Report a pregnancy on 
the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet ( Appendix  D).  The Pregnancy Surveillance 
Program (PSP) will seek to follow the pregnant woman throughout her pregnancy and 
her baby  [CONTACT_8622] [ADDRESS_299929] through 
6 months after of end of treatment.  
Any lactation case should be reported to [COMPANY_010]’s global Lactation Surveillance Program 
(LSP) within 7 business days of the site receiving notification.  Report a lactation case on 
the Lactation Notification Worksheet (Appendix E).

If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator is to inform [COMPANY_010] within 24 hours of 
learning of the pregnancy and/or lactation. 
[COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety will follow -up with the investigator regarding 
additional information that may be requested. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered serious adverse events. 
Collection of Pregnancy Information 
Female Subjects Who Become Pregnant  
• Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female subject who 
becomes pregnant while taking protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 
6 months after the end of treatment. 
• Information will be recorded on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet 
(Appendix D). The worksheet must be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient 
Safety within [ADDRESS_299931]’s pregnancy.  (Note: Sites are not required to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification 
Work sheet that violates the country or regions local privacy laws.)  
• After obtaining the female subject’s signed authorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy and infant health information and complete the pregnancy questionnaire for any female subject who becomes pregnant while taking protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 6 months after the end of treatment  of 
the study drug.  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety. Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after 
the birth of the child (if applicable). 
• Any termination of pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety, regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or 
indication for procedure. 
• While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an adverse event or serious 
adverse event, any pregnancy complication or report of a congenital anomaly or developmental delay, fetal death, or suspected adverse reactions in the neonate will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. Note that an elective termination with no information on a 
fetal congenital malformation or maternal complication is generally not 
considered an adverse event, but still must be reported to [COMPANY_010] as a pregnancy exposure case. 
• If the outcome of the pregnancy meets a criterion for immediate classification as a serious adverse event (eg, female subject experiences a 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or neonatal death or there is a fetal or 
neonatal congenital anomaly) the investigator will report the event as a serious adverse event. 
• Any serious adverse event occurring as a result of a poststudy pregnancy which is considered reasonably related to the study treatment by [CONTACT_093], will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety as described

in Appendix C .  While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this 
information in former study subjects, he or she may learn of a serious 
adverse event through spontaneous reporting. 
• Any female subject who becomes pregnant while participating will discontinue study treatment. 
Male Subjects With Partners Who Become Pregnant or Were Pregnant at the Time 
of Enrollment  
• In the event a male subject fathers a child during treatment, and for an 
additional [ADDRESS_299932] be submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 
24 hours of the site’s awareness of the pregnancy.  (Note: Sites are not 
required to provide any information on the Pregnancy Notification Worksheet that violates the country or regions local privacy laws.)  
• The investigator will attempt  to obtain a signed authorization for release of 
pregnancy and infant health information directly from the pregnant female partner to obtain additional pregnancy information.  After obtaining the 
female partner’s signed authorization for release of pregnancy and infant 
health information, the investigator will collect pregnancy outcome and 
infant health information on the pregnant partner and her baby [CONTACT_246532].  This information will be forwarded to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety.  
• Generally, infant follow -up will be conducted up to 12 months after the birth 
of the child (if applicable). 
• Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient 
Safety regardless of fetal status (presence or absence of anomalies) or 
indication for procedure. 
Collection of Lactation Information 
• Investigator will collect lactation information on any female subject who 
breastfeeds while taking protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] 6 months 
after the end of treatment. 
• Information will be recorded on the Lactation Notification Worksheet (Appendix E) and submitted to [COMPANY_010] Global Patient Safety within 
24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of event. 
• Study treatment will be discontinued if female subject breastfeeds during the study as described in exclusion criterion 204 (see Section 4.2). 
With the female subjects signed authorization for release of mother and infant 
health information, the investigator will collect mother and infant health information and complete the lactation questionnaire on any female subject who 
breastfeeds while taking protocol-required therapi[INVESTIGATOR_44817] [ADDRESS_299933]:  Conatumumab and AMG 479

Title:  A Phase 2 Open Label Extension Study of Conatumumab and AMG 479 
 
[COMPANY_010] Protocol Number (Conatumumab and AMG 479) 20101116  
 
Amendment Date:  20 November 2013  
 
Rationale:  
The protocol  was amended primarily to change the interval of tumor scans from 3 to 
6 months (±1 months or more frequently if clinically indicated) in order to reduce the risk 
to subjects due to potential cumulative radiation exposure given that all subjects have 
been on study treatment for 3.[ADDRESS_299939] been incorporated into the protocol : 
• Update the sponsor contact [CONTACT_3031].  
• Remove the description of the formulation of the conatumumab and AMG [ADDRESS_299940] Instruction Manual .  
• Allow the investigator to use previous cycle’s amylase and lipase results, if present 
cycle’s results are not available before dosing 
• Revision of the reporting language of SAE’s within the Treatment period and Day 30 
Safety Follow Up Visit ( sections 7.3 and 7.4) 
• Update reasons for removal from protoc ol-specified product(s) or observation in 
Section 8.1  in accordance with reasons available on the end of study case report 
form.   
• Update Section 9.2.2 (Reporting Procedures for SAE) to inform the investigator to 
report SAEs that occurs outside the protocol- specified reporting period per the 
Guidance CT-3. 
• Update EAC data capture instructions in Section 12.3 (Study Monitoring and Data 
Collection)  to align with the current standard instructions in the [COMPANY_010] protocol 
template.  
• Add Section 12.4 (Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection) per the latest 
version of the [COMPANY_010] p rotocol template  
• Update Section 12.6  (Publication Policy) to only reference the International 
Committee Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) guidelines without specifying a version or set of criteria.  
• Other administrative corrections were made throughout  the protocol.

[COMPANY_010] Protocol Number (Conatumumab and AMG 479)  20101116  
 
Amendment Date:  20 December 2012 
Rationale:  
The protocol was amended to incorporate the following changes:  
• Updat e the sponsor contact [CONTACT_3031]. 
• Revise the eligibility criteria, patient population, and treatment procedures to allow 2 
ongoing subjects on the AMG 479 20050118 study to rollover into 20101116 study in 
order  to continue to receive AMG 479 at the same d ose and schedule they were 
receiving at the conclusion of the 20050118 Study . 
• SAE Reporting Procedures:  
o Change the SAE reporting timelines from 1 working day to 24 hours of 
discovery to comply with the EU Clinical Trial Guidance on the collection 
of adverse event/reaction arising from clinical trials.  
o Remove the language that requires the investigator to report SAEs 
related to investigational products that occurs outside the protocol -specified reporting period since the investigators may use their discreti on 
to report any SA
E to [COMPANY_010] after the safety follow -up, whether related to 
investigational product or not.    
o Revise the language 
related to determination of expectedness for 
expedited reporting of adverse events in clinical trials to ensure better alignm ent with ICH E6 and regulatory agency expectations.  
• Add lactation reporting procedures and the Lactation Notification Worksheet.

[COMPANY_010] Protocol Number AMG 655 (Conatumumab) [ADDRESS_299941] number : 2010- 022270- 14 
 
Amendment Date:  25 January 2012  
 
Rationale:  
The protocol has been amended for the following reasons:  
• To update the conatumumab investigational product information due to the transition 
of the conatumumab clinical supply for this study from material manufactured by 
[CONTACT_246533] 1 to material manufactured by [CONTACT_246533] 2.  The change in clinical supply  
eliminates the risk caused by [CONTACT_246534] 1 material to form flake-
like glass particles when stored at -70°C.  Process 2 material is stored and shipped 
at refrigerated conditions, and therefore does not form flake- like glass particles, a nd 
does not require the use on an in- line filter . 
• To remove the requirement for the use of an in- line, nonpyrogenic, low -protein-
binding 0.[ADDRESS_299942].   Filter use is not required for intr avenous infusion of conatumumab  Process 
2 material.    
• To revise the sample size from approximately 50 to 15 subjects because fewer than 
expected subjects decided to continue treatment on this rollover study.  
• To add new section ( Section 9.3 ) to provide instructions for pregnancy reporting.  
• To replace Pregnancy Notification Form with current Form . 
• To update the sponsor contact [CONTACT_3031].  
• Finally, minor administrative errors in the protocol were corrected.

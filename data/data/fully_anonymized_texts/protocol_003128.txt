Version #: 4  IRB #  228789  
Date:  1/4/[ADDRESS_491768]  three decades  (Deyo, 2016 ). As this public health crisis continues 
to plague Americans , much attention has been  directed to opi[INVESTIGATOR_391659].  It 
has been shown that the rate of long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_391660] 13.5% when opi[INVESTIGATOR_391661]ïve patients extend its use to eight days or longer  and 29.9% when its use extends to 
31 days or longer ( Shah, 2017 ). Even o ne additional refill after initiation can increa se 
odds  of long-term use by 2.25 ( Deyo, 2016 ). Coupling these  tendencies  with the fact 
that over prescribing of narcotic analgesics has been shown to occur  even when these  
opi[INVESTIGATOR_391662]ïve patients encounter s even their first prescription, at ambulatory surgeries  for 
example , increased awareness through education is paramount in working to effectively 
battle  the opi[INVESTIGATOR_15817] ( Thiels, 2018 ). 
Other than overdose deaths, complications of long -term opi[INVESTIGATOR_391663] l 
studied showing tolerance to the medication, hyperalgesia, and limited efficacy over 
time, just to name a few  (Deyo, 2016 ). Therefore , opi[INVESTIGATOR_391664]-opi[INVESTIGATOR_391665] b e 
emphasized.  Acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are 
popular substitutes to opi[INVESTIGATOR_391666] r post -operative pain control 
(Valentine, 2015 ). They can be administered on a scheduled basis so that consistent 
therapeutic concentrations can be maintained to avoid opi[INVESTIGATOR_391667] a rescue .  
Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen  have been shown to provide superior acute pain with 
combined with opi[INVESTIGATOR_2438] (Memtsoudis, 2018) and to be more effective than opi[INVESTIGATOR_391668] p ain conditions (Krebs, 2018).  
We now know that long term opi[INVESTIGATOR_391669] a cute pain.  
More specifically, many patients use opi[INVESTIGATOR_391670] a hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391671] (Cicero, 2014). Patients are often provided with a prescription  for excessive 
amounts of opi[INVESTIGATOR_391672], full disclosure of the risk and 
benefits, or a discussion of alternative treatment strategies for pain control (Sabatino, 
2018; Theisen, 2018).  Approximately 6% of patients who undergo  an operative 
procedure have continued opi[INVESTIGATOR_391620] 90 days (Brummett, 2017).  While many of 
these patients have developed chronic post -surgical pain disorders, rates of chronic 
post-surgical pain are increased by [CONTACT_391707] -surgical p ain (Gjeilo, 
2014; Meissner, 2015).   
Disseminating information  into easily understood patient education programs that will 
allow patients to navigate post -operative pain management options  and improve acute 
pain treatment could be a  technique to decrease narcotic intake after outpatient surgery.

Date:  1/4/2019 Page 5 According to Shah, Hayes, and Martin (2017), starting this conversation early, prior to 
surgery thus prior to opi[INVESTIGATOR_391673]. Cancer -related pain control has been 
shown by [CONTACT_391708] t o brief 20 minute coaching interventions on self –
management (Oliver, 2001 ).  Booklets regarding  pain-relief methods  have been used 
with proven adequate analgesia ( Watt-Watson, 2017 ).  While this work is promising, 
there are some limitations to the use of handouts as the primary means of patient 
education .   While most hospi[INVESTIGATOR_391674] a 10th grade 
reading level, the reading level of the average patient in the [LOCATION_002] is 
approximately 8th -9th grade (Saffer, 2005). Also, app roximately 22 percent of patients 
read at a 5th grade reading level or lo wer (Saffer, 2005).  
In studies that have randomized patients to handouts versus  video -based education, 
patients obtained and retained more knowledge from video -based  education initiatives 
(Hill, 2009; Shah 2017).  This conclusion holds true for instructional -based initiatives 
pertaining to prescription medications, preventing home falls, and adherence to pre -
surgical instructions (Hill, 2009; Shah 2017). Pre -procedural  video based education has 
also been shown to decrease anxiety among patients due to increased knowledge 
about the unknown (Ayasrah, 2016). Ambulatory surgery, pre -procedural patient -
centered interview interventions have also been shown to decrease post pr ocedural 
pain, improve surgical recovery, and increase daily activity after surgery (Pereira, 2015).  
In the emergency room, fifty -two patients who were being discharged with an opi[INVESTIGATOR_391675] a [ADDRESS_491769] by a statistically significant margin of 17 percent (Chakravarthy, 2018).  This 
trial further illustrates the benefits of standardized video -based education over non 
standardized verbal education by [CONTACT_391709].  We feel  that this video 
based style of opi[INVESTIGATOR_391676].  
Therefore, we propose to examine the feasibility of using a novel, video -based opi[INVESTIGATOR_391677]ïve (patients who have not taken opi[INVESTIGATOR_220181] 30 days pre -
operatively), ambulatory surgery patients in the perioperative period. During our pi[INVESTIGATOR_11480], our primary outcomes are patient satisfaction, knowledge acquisition, and the 
effect of the video intervention on post -opera tive pain control.  This pi[INVESTIGATOR_391678] (use of opi[INVESTIGATOR_391679] 90 days), percentage of patients who 
develop a chronic post -surgical pain dis order, and number of total days to opi[INVESTIGATOR_391680].  We plan to collect this data both by [CONTACT_391710].  This study will also allow us to assess

Study Objectives  
Primary Objective s 
Assess the feasibility of collection of data from both cohorts including the following 
metrics vi a phone survey:  
 Days to post-operative  opi[INVESTIGATOR_391682] -operative pain control  
 Patient rated knowledge of post-operative  pain control  
 Patient rated knowledge of post-operative  opi[INVESTIGATOR_391683]-surgical  pain syndromes  
 Development of chronic post-surgical  opi[INVESTIGATOR_391684]:  
 Number of post-operative  prescriptions obtained  
Assess the feasibility of the proposed intervention on patient satisfaction, retention of 
information, perceived usefulness of information, effect on pre -operative anxiety, and 
effect on acute usage of opi[INVESTIGATOR_2480] m edication via focus group.  
Hypothesis  
The use of patient -focused, video based opi[INVESTIGATOR_391685], alternatives to opi[INVESTIGATOR_2538], and safe use, storage, and disposal of opi[INVESTIGATOR_391686].  The collec tion of data about opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], patient 
perception of their knowledge on pain control options, patient perception of their 
knowledge on opi[INVESTIGATOR_288987], rates of post -operative chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441], and rates of 
chron ic post -surgical pain disorders is feasible via phone interview, focus group, and 
access to the Arkansas Prescription Drug Monitoring Database.   
 Potential Impact: Understanding the feasibility of this research protocol will inform 
the creation of a  fully powered comparative effectiveness trial to test whether applying 
this video intervention for opi[INVESTIGATOR_2583]ïve, ambulatory surgery patients in the pre -operative 
holding area will decrease chronic opi[INVESTIGATOR_2441] (90 days), days to opi[INVESTIGATOR_199629], and 
development of chronic post -surgi cal pain conditions.

Study Design and Procedures  
Study Procedure    
Prior to subject enrollment, we  will create a 5 -10 minute opi[INVESTIGATOR_391689].  
This video will explain the risks and benefits of opi[INVESTIGATOR_391690] -based alternative acute pain therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  It will also discuss safe 
use, storage, and disposal of opi[INVESTIGATOR_27968].  This video will be based on a Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention publication titled “Opi[INVESTIGATOR_391691]: What You 
Need to Know.”  This video will be peer -reviewed for accuracy by a panel of medical 
doctors, pharmacists specializing in addi ction medicine, psychologist, researchers with 
experience in substance using populations, and nurses , all of which are experts with 
advanced knowledge of opi[INVESTIGATOR_391692].  
After video creation, we will begin enrolling patients.  Patients admitted for 
ambulatory surgery will be consented for the study in the preoperative holding area.  All 
patients will be read the risk and benefits of the study prior to signing informed consent.  
After signing informed consent and discussing the risks and benefits of the study 
protocol, interested patients will be randomized to either receive the video intervention

shuffled [ADDRESS_491772] -operative day 7, 30, and 90  and asked a 
series of questions (Appendix B) .  After completing their post -operative day 90 phone 
call, patients will be compensated for their time with a $[ADDRESS_491773].  Arkansas 
Prescription Monitoring Database Data will be accessed for every patient (D r. Hayes) 
and will be protected and de -identified.  This will provide objective data to determine 
whether patients have gotten additional prescriptions post operatively and whether 
patients are continuing opi[INVESTIGATOR_391679] 90 days.  
As this a prospective prelimi nary collection with plans for a more detailed 
longitudinal study in the future, no net sample size or statistical power has been 
planned, however the goal is to enroll 1 10 subjects.  Data collection will continue in an 
ongoing, prospective, open -ended man ner, which depends on participant willingness to 
continue in the study over several months.  
Analysis of data will be undertaken with the help of SPSS version 22 software 
(IBM) using parametric and non -parametric tests of significance dependent on the 
varia bles being tested.  Univariate and multivariate regression models will be applied 
using the same software to determine variables that correlate best with differences in 
studied variables.  
Focus Group Structure and Content.  
Patients who are randomized to th e video group will also be notified that they are 
eligible to participate in one of two focus groups.  These will be scheduled after all 
patients have been enrolled in the study and all 7 day follow up calls are completed.  
Patients will receive a $[ADDRESS_491774] approximately 1 hour 
each (Basch, 1987).   We will use the information from this focus group to ensure that 
this information is correctly delivered to and consumed and retained by [CONTACT_1962].  We

pursue a rapid analysis (e.g., Sobo et al., 2006) of focus group data to ensure quick 
trans lation of patient feedback to actionable suggestions for developi[INVESTIGATOR_391694] .  We will listen to all focus group audio 
recordings and will compi[INVESTIGATOR_391695].  This data will be used 
to generate a summary of patient recommendations for adaptations to video content 
and final study video delivery methods. This gen erated summary will be presented to 
study team and stakeholders.  
Removal of Subjects from the Study  
 Patients can be taken off the study at any time at their own request, or they may 
be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral , or administrative 
reasons.  The reason(s) for discontinuation will be documented and may include:  
• Subject withdraws consent  
• Subject is lost to follow up.  If the investigator is unable to contact [CONTACT_391711] “lost to follow up”  
Risks  
The only potential risk to study participants is the potential for loss of confidentiality.  
Measures to protect the confidentiality of study participants will be implemented as 
described in the Data Handling and Record keepi[INVESTIGATOR_147414].  
Potential Benefits  
Patients provided with education video could be at lower risk for opi[INVESTIGATOR_9827].  As 
well as the  knowledge gained from the study could potentially benefit patients in the 
future.

Ethical Considerations  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable government regulations 
and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences research policies and 
procedures.   This protocol and any amendments will be submitted and approved by [CONTACT_391712] (IRB) to conduct the study.    
The formal consent of each subject, using the IRB -approved consent form, will be 
obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.   All subjects for this 
study will be provided a consent form de scribing this study and providing sufficient 
information in language suitable for subjects to make an informed decision about their 
participation in this study.   The person obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each 
element of the document and outline the risks and benefits, alternate treatment(s), and 
requirements of the study.  
The consent process will take p lace in a  private preoperative bay , and subjects may 
take as much time as needed to make a decision about their participation.   Participation 
privacy will be maintained and questions regarding participation will be answered.   No 
coercion or undue influence will be used in the consent process.   This consent form 
must be signed by [CONTACT_391713] (only if applicable ), 
and the individual obtaining the consent.   A copy of  the signed consent will be given to 
the participant, and the informed consent process will be documented in each subject’s 
research record . 
Amendments  to the Protocol  
Should amendments to the protocol be required, the amendments will be originated and 
documented by [CONTACT_079].  It should also be noted that when an 
amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study deign or potential risk to the 
patient, a revised consent f orm might be required.  
The amendment protocol, and if required the amended consent form, must be approved 
by [CONTACT_14226].

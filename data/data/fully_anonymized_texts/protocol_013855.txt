 2 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
Significance of Research Question/Purpose:  
 Severe acute respi[INVESTIGATOR_6507] 2 (SARS -CoV-2) is a rapi[INVESTIGATOR_186295] -19. The current strategy uses a public health model of identifying 
infected cases, isolation, and quarantine to stop transmission.  Once exposed, observation is 
standard -of-care.  
No effective therapy curr ently exists for treatment.  The lack of effective therapy 
diminishes persons presenting for self -quarantine.  Having an effective pre -exposure 
prophylaxis for healthcare workers at high risk of contracting COVID -19, even if only partially 
effective, may ad ditionally create synergy for the public health strategy of case identification and 
isolation – if a safe prophylaxis is available.  
People who develop COVID -19 disease generally develop signs and symptoms, 
including mild respi[INVESTIGATOR_186296], aft er an average of 5 -6 days after 
exposure (i.e. mean incubation period). The range of the incubation period is between [ADDRESS_414523] mild disease and recover. 
Approximately 80% of laboratory -confirmed patients have had mild to moderate disease, 
which includes non -pneumonia and pneumonia cases, 14% have severe disease, and 
6% are critically ill with respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], shock, and/or multiple organ dysfu nction.2 
Preliminary Data:  
Chloroquine has  in vitro  activity in cell lines against SARS -CoV and SARS -CoV2. In a 
Vero E6 cell line, the half -maximal effective co ncentration (EC50) activity of chloroquine was 
1.[ADDRESS_414524] SARS -CoV2.3 Hydroxychloroquine is functionally equivalent as chloroquine.   
Another compound under treatment trials, remdesivir ([COMPANY_009]) had an EC50 of 0.77 μM.3  
Remdesivir (Gil ead) is not FDA -approved and in limited quantities.  Hydroxychloroquine is FDA -
approved and globally is inexpensive.  Chloroquine is no longer broadly available in the [LOCATION_003].  
Existing Literature:  
Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054] -ritonavir, corticosteroids, have been 
used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy is poorly understood as a gold 
standard randomized clinical trial has not been conducted.  
After the original 2003 SARS outbreak, screening of compounds was per formed.  The 
Special Pathogens Branch of the Division of Viral and Rickettsial Diseases at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia investigated chloroquine.  
PREP COVID -[ADDRESS_414525] -infection chloroquine treatme nt was 
effective in vitro at preventing the spread of SARS -CoV infection in an in vitro cell -based 
system.4  Vincent et al reported:  
“In order to investigate the antiviral properties of chloroquine on SARS -
CoV after the initiation of infection, Vero E6 cells were infected with the virus and 
fresh medium supplemented with various concentrations of chloroquine was 
added immediately after  virus adsorption. Infected cells were incubated for an 
additional 16 –[ADDRESS_414526] immunofluorescence analysis. When chloroquine was added after the 
initiation of infection, there was a dramatic dose -dependent decrease in the 
number of virus antigen -positive cells ( Fig. 2A ). As little as 0.1 –1 μM chloroquine 
reduced the infection by 50% and up to 90 –94% inhibition was observed with 33 –
100 μM concentrations ( Fig. 2B ). At concentrations of chloroqui ne in excess of [ADDRESS_414527] (EC50) was estimated to occur at 4.4 ± 1.0 μM chloroquine ( Fig. 2C ). 
These data clearly show that the addition of chloroquine can effectively reduce 
the establishment of infection and spread of SARS -CoV if the drug is added 
immediately following virus adsorption.”[ADDRESS_414528]-infection chloroquine treatment reduces SARS -CoV.

Vincent et al also reported: “Since we observed antiviral effects by [CONTACT_335622], we further extended the analysis by [CONTACT_186328] 3 
and 5 h after virus adsorption and examined for the presence of virus antigens after 20 h. We 
found that chloroquine was still significantly effective even when added 5 h after infection (Fig. 
3); however, to obtain equivalent antiviral effect, a higher concentration of chloroquine was 
required if the drug was added 3 or 5 h after adsorption.”4 
  
Further experiments demonstrated that chloroquine impaired the terminal glycosylation 
of angiotensin -converting enzyme -2 (ACE2) receptor, which is the binding site for the envelope 
spi[INVESTIGATOR_92189] -CoV and SAR -CoV2.  
 

PREP COVID -[ADDRESS_414529] respi[INVESTIGATOR_18960] (MERS -CoV), which may be related to 
MERS bind ing to CD26 receptor protein .[ADDRESS_414530] grea ter activity 
than chloroquine .6 The SARS -CoV-2 EC 50 values for 
hydroxychloroquine were 6.14 μM at 24 h ours and 
0.72 μM at 48 hours .6 Conversely, chloroquine EC50 
values were >[ADDRESS_414531] SARS -CoV-2 in vitr o.6  
In a March 18, 2020 publication, 
hydroxychloroquine was found to be less toxic than 
chloroquine with slightly lower, but similar potency.7 
At MOI of 0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8, the EC50 of 
hydroxychloroquine  was 4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 12.96 μM respectively compared to 2.71, 3.81, 
7.14, and 7.36 μM for chloroquine.   
On March 20, 2020, a clinical study from [LOCATION_009] reported improved viral clearance in 20 
patients treated with 600 mg per day of hydroxychloroquine  for 6 days compared to 16 controls.8 
By 6 days, 70% of those in the hydroxychloroquine group had negative viral PCR on 
nasopharyngeal swab compared to 13% in the control group. However, the authors noted an 
additional [ADDRESS_414532] is 10.5% (95%CI, 2.9 to 31.4%).9 Among all close contacts, the SARS -

PREP COVID -19 Version 1.0  
 27 March 2020  
  
17 
 CoV2 transmission rate is estimated at 0.45% (95%CI,  0.12 to 1.6%) by [CONTACT_6750]. These 
estimates are based on monitoring of travel -associated COVID19 cases. Conversely, in a 
setting with community transmission, the secondary attack rate in China was 35% (95%CI, 27 -
44%) based on [ADDRESS_414533] SARS -COV2 which may 
prevent COVID -19 disease or reduce disease severity. It is not known at what dosing 
hydroxychloroquine may be effective for pre -exposure proph ylaxis.  
We propose to dose for SARS -CoV-2 pre -exposure prophylaxis at:  
1. 400mg once weekly (with a loading dose)  
2. 400mg twice weekly (with a loading dose)  
 
Study recruitment is expected to take 4 weeks, and all participants will be followed for a 
minimum of 4 weeks. If study recruitment is slower than anticipated, the study medications will 
be given for a maximum of 12 weeks.  
 
The projected levels achieved w ill be approximately 0.72 uM which is at the half -maximal 
effective concentration (EC50) where 50% viral inhibition would occur.  Given chloroquine’s and 
hydroxychloroquine’s long half -time, a steady -state concentration may take days to achieve.   
Thereby,  a loading dose may be necessary as seen in emergency prophylactic use of 
hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine  for anti -malarial purposes .[ADDRESS_414534] common reported side effects include:  
● headache, dizziness, ringing in your ears;  
● nausea, vomiting, stomach pain;  
● loss of appetite, weight loss;  
● mood changes, feeling nervous  or irritable;  
● skin rash or itching;  
● hair loss.  
GI side effects are minimized when taken with a meal or with milk. Antacid medications 
should be spaced apart by [CONTACT_2669] [ADDRESS_414535] -exposure study of hydroxychloroquine, where hydroxychloroquine is 
given at high dose (800mg) daily for 5 days, 70% of participants reported no side effects. 
The most common side effects, reported in ~30% of participant s were GI -related 
symptoms such as nausea or vomiting.  
 
In this study, we are using lower dose (400mg) weekly or twice weekly. We expect even 
fewer side effects, if any.  
 
● Potential adverse effects by [CONTACT_57501], as listed on the FDA package insert:  
○ Eye: “Chl oroquine retinopathy” is a rare side -effect of chronic use after multiple 
years of use. This has not occurred with <1 year of continuous use. 
Furthermore, based on the recommendation by [CONTACT_335623], screening for retinopathy is wa rranted with dosing higher than 
5 mg/kg/day. The proposed dosing in this trial is order of magnitudes lower.  
○ Dermatologic Reactions : Bleaching of hair, alopecia, pruritus, skin and 
mucosal pi[INVESTIGATOR_371], photosensitivity, and skin eruptions (urticarial, 
morbilliform, lichenoid, maculopapular, purpuric, erythema annulare 
centrifugum, Stevens -Johnson syndrome, acute generalized exanthematous 
pustulosis, and exfoliative dermatitis).  
○ Hematologic Reactions : Various blood dyscrasias such as aplastic anemia, 
agranulocytosis, leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia (hemolysis in 
individuals with glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G -6-PD) deficiency).  
○ Gastrointestinal Reactions: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and 
abdominal cramps. Isolated cases of abnormal liv er function and fulminant 
hepatic failure.  
○ Cardiac Reactions: Long -term use (>1 year) has been associated with the 
development of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias.  
○ Allergic Reactions : Urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been 
reported  
○ CNS Reactions : Irritability, nervousness, emotional changes, nightmares, 
psychosis, headache, dizziness, vertigo, tinnitus, nystagmus, nerve deafness, 
convulsions, ataxia  
○ Miscellaneous Reactions:  Weight loss, lassitude, exacerbation or 
precipi[INVESTIGATOR_335615] -light-sensitive psoriasis.  
2.3.2  Known Potential Benefits  
● There are no known  benefits in humans for preemptive treatment.  
● In vitro  antiviral activity against SARS -CoV and SARS -CoV-2 viruses.  
● Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine have a long history of safe, effect ive 
use as an antimalarial, both acutely and long -term use.  
● Chloroquine is being used therapeutically for severe COVID -19 disease in 
China and Korea.  
● Commonly used as a chronic medication for autoimmune disorders 
(rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus eryt hematosus).  
PREP COVID -19 Version 1.0  
 27 March 2020  
  
19 
 ● Recent studies have shown potential broad antiviral effects in vitro at 
dosages below currently recommended clinical dosing, reducing risk of 
potential adverse effects listed above.

PREP COVID -[ADDRESS_414536] Inclusion Criteria  
● A healthcare worker at high risk for COVID -19 exposure (defined below)  
● >= 18 years of age  
● Provision of informed consent  
5.[ADDRESS_414537] Exclusion Criteria  
●    Active COVID -19 disease  
● Confirmed prior COVID -19 disease  
●    Current fever, cough, shortness of breath  
●       Contraindication or allergy to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine  
●       Prior retinal eye disease  
●       Known Chronic Kidney disease, Stage 4 or 5 or dialysis.  
●       Known glucose -6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G -6-PD) deficiency.  
●       Weight <40 kg  
●       Current use of hydroxychloroquine or cardiac medicines of flecainide, amiodarone, digoxin, 
procainamide, or propafenone  
●       Current use of medications with known significant drug -drug interactions: 
artemether, lumefantrine, mefloquine , tamoxifen  or methotrexate . 
 
Rationale for inclusion / exclusion criteria :  
Healthcare workers at high risk for COVID -19 exposures include:  
● Persons primarily working in emergency departments (physicians, nurses, 
ancillary staff, triage personnel)  
● Persons primarily working in intensive care units (physicians, nurses, anc illary 
staff, respi[INVESTIGATOR_46175])  
● Persons performing aerosol generating procedures: ex. Anesthesiologists, nurse 
anesthetists (CRNAs)  
● First responders: ex. EMTs, paramedics  
 
In clinical practice of tropi[INVESTIGATOR_186303], chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are 
prescribed without any baseline laboratory testing or monitoring.   
Age criteria are meant to increase the propensity to follow up and minimize dropouts.   
PREP COVID -19 Version 1.0

 Chronic use of hydroxychloroquine for >1 year can cause retinopathy or 
cardiomyopathy, thus person s with baseline conditions will be excluded.  Study medicine 
is excreted via the kidney with dose reduction recommended in CrCl <30 cc/min (Stage 
4 Kidney Disease).  G -6-PD deficiency is listed as a caution on the FDA label. G -6-PD 
testing is not routinely  performed in clinical care prior to giving hydroxychloroquine 
prescriptions (unlike with primaquine).  Medication exclusions are for possible drug -drug 
interactions, particularly with cardiac arrhythmia medicines with a caution on the FDA -
package insert.  
 
5.3 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
5.3.1  Randomization Procedures  
Participants will be randomized via permuted block randomization. Randomization 
will be recorded on an electronic log by [CONTACT_1714]. Study investigators and 
subjects will be blinded.  
5.3.2  Masking Procedures  
Participants will be provided masked study medicine, shipped by [CONTACT_30367] (e.g. 
FedEx). The intervention vs. placebo will not be identical; however, participants 
and outcome assessors will be masked to their assignment.  
5.3.3  Reasons for Withdrawal  
Participants may withdraw at any time point at their discretion.   
5.3.4  Handling of Withdrawals  
Withdraws will be counted as failures for the secondary endpoint of completion of 
study medication.  
5.3.5  Termination of Study  
This study may be prematurely terminated if th ere is sufficient reasonable cause, 
including but not limited to:  
● Unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects  
● Interim analyses by [CONTACT_4318].  
● Insufficient compliance with protocol requirements  
● Data are not sufficiently complete and/or not evaluable  
PREP COVID -19 Version 1.0  
 27 March 2020  
  
26 
 ● Regulatory authorities decide that study should be terminated  
If the study is prematurely terminated for harm, current subjects will complete follow up, 
and no further subjects will be enrolled.  If the study is terminated due to benefit, then 
the study will immediately convert into an open -label prospective cohort to collect further 
observational data on the safety and efficacy of the intervention, up to the IRB approved 
recruitment limit.

Serious Adverse Events below.   
Expected adverse events would include normal events within the general population as 
well as COVID19 -related disease events which may include the need for hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
pneumonia, respi[INVESTIGATOR_1399], sepsis, and death.

8.3 Reporting Procedures  
8.3.1  Serious Adverse Events  
  
An AE or suspected adverse reacti on is considered a serious adverse event (SAE) if it 
results in any of the following outcomes:  
PREP COVID -19 Version 1.0  
 27 March 2020  
  
34 
 ● Death,  
● a life -threatening adverse event (as below),  
● hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059],  
● a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions, or  
● congenital anomaly/birth defect.   
● Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening or require 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_335618].   
Examples of such medical even ts include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
 Life-threatening adverse  event. An AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
site principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_10157], its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk 
of death.  It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might  
have caused death. For life -threatening AEs, subjects would be recommended 
/expected to be hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].  
 
Based on the known safety track record of hydroxychloroquine, this pragmatic protocol 
will focus on death, life -threatening AEs, and hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] s.  Incapacity / permanent 
disability is a possibility with COVID19, but this is not associated with 
hydroxychloroquine. In the event of incapacity, the subject would be expected to be 
hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057].   
 
Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are not known to ca use teratogenic events and are 
viewed as safe in pregnancy, especially with short term use.  With this trial’s sample 
size, this will not further delineate this risk.  COVID -[ADDRESS_414547] annually.  
Serious unexpected suspected adverse reac tions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) which are not expected 
with COVID19 nor listed in the FDA package insert will be reported to the IRB.  
PREP COVID -19 Version 1.0  
 27 March 2020  
  
35 
 Those S[LOCATION_003]RS which are deemed by [CONTACT_335626].  
 
8.3.3  Reporting of Pregnancy  
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not known to be teratogenic. Chloroquine and 
hydroxychloroquine can accumulate in neonatal eyes.  Conversely, the risk of severe 
COVID -19 infection is unknown, but could represent a heightened  risk in pregnant 
women. The CDC states, “We do not have information on adverse pregnancy outcomes 
in pregnant women with COVID -19. Pregnancy loss, including miscarriage and stillbirth, 
has been observed in cases of infection with other related coronavirus es (SARS -CoV 
and MERS -CoV) during pregnancy. High fevers during the first trimester of pregnancy 
can increase the risk of certain birth defects.”   
Thus, the risk/benefit would favor the enrollment of women who may be or are pregnant, 
so as to not discrimi nate against pregnant women.  
For women who are pregnant, we will ask to have follow through until the end of their 
pregnancy to assess the outcome of the pregnancy via a brief survey.  
8.[ADDRESS_414548] up to 90 day follow up 
after the common closing date, to assess their final outcome.  Management will be as 
per the participant’s local healthcare provider.  
8.5 Safety Oversight (DSMB)  
A data and safety  monitoring board (DSMB) will oversee the trial.  The quorum will 
include three members and a biostatistician.  The PI [INVESTIGATOR_1317] a non -voting observer, 
providing input as requested.  
[ADDRESS_414549] of the trial is in compliance 
with the currently approved protocol/ amendment (s), ICH, GCP, and with applicable

 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1 Study Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that Hydroxychloroquine is superior to placebo for preventing COVID -19 
disease. We hypothesize, that if COVID -19 develops while a person is taking 
hydroxychloroquine  prophylaxis, then the COVID -19 disease would be less severe.  
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
The planned sample size is up to 3500 participants.  There will be two comparisons:  treatment 
once weekly compared to placebo, and treatment twice weekly compared to  placebo.  With 
[ADDRESS_414550] achieves 80% power at alpha = 0.[ADDRESS_414551] ratio of 
0.65 when COVID -19 free survival is 90% in the plac ebo group.   
The study is powered at alpha = 0.025 to account for the two treatment versus placebo 
comparisons.  The two treatment groups will be compared to the same placebo group.  
Assumed loss to follow -up is 5% in the treatment groups and 15% in the pl acebo group.  With 
3500 participants approximately 310 COVID -19 or death events are anticipated.  
Sample Size Re -estimation:  
At the time of the second DSMB review, a sample size re -estimation will occur based on the 
disease transmission rate in the control  group.  The conservative a priori  assumption (based on 
limited data) is 10% transmission risk.  The table below shows that if the transmission rate is 8% 
(lower than assumed) then the sample size would need to be increased to a total of 4353 
participants.   On the other hand, if the transmission rate is greater than the assumed 10% then 
the sample size can be decreased.

10.3 Planned Interim Analyses  
Interim analyses will focus on the statistical testing of the primary endpoint with 
descriptive reporting of the secondary endpoints as well. Interim analyses will be 
conducted after enrollment of approximately: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of participants 
are enrolled. This interval may be modified by [CONTACT_4318].  
A Lan -DeMets spending function analog of the O’Brien -Fleming boundaries will be used  
for the outcome of  COVID -19-free survival.  The provided table assumes four interim 
analyses with the final analysis w ith an overall alpha=0.025.  The boundaries are 
truncated at |Z| = 3.01.

Should a stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_186318], we would recommend an analysis to determine 
whether the findings are consistent across secondary endpoints, such that a clear answer is 
achieved. In the event of early halting due to efficacy, the study will immediate ly convert 
to an open -label observational cohort of hydroxychloroquine prescribed to all consented 
participants.  
Based on the public health situation, the DSMB has the prerogative to alter the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_004].  
Futility Analysis:  
If the conditional power is <20% at the time of the second interim analysis with approximately 
50% of participants enrolled, discontinuation should be considered as a possible 
recommendation by [CONTACT_4318]. The sample size re -estimation will be considered her e as well 
as the pace of enrollment.

Title Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for SARS -Coronavirus -2: A Pragmatic 
Randomized Clinical Trial: A sub -study of peripheral blood correlatives  
Objectives  This is a sub study for correlative sample collection of blood to evaluate:  
1)    Circulating antibody (IgG or IgM) presence specific for COVID -19 
virus protein at baseline  
a.    This is determined by [CONTACT_335627]  
2)    Seroconversion from IgG/IgM negative -to-positive during the 
treatment period  
a.    This is determined by [CONTACT_335628] -of-study samples  
3)    Evaluation of HLA -types and germline factors associated with 
outcomes.  
a.    This is determined by [CONTACT_335629] 6 million SNP array or 
targeted next generation sequencing of HLA alleles, or other 
germline DNA testing.

Background:  
Due to the nature of COVID -19 infection, which is often asymptomatic in many 
individuals, it is conceivable that some population of enrollees in the parent trial “Pre -
exposure Prophylaxis for SARS -Coronavirus -2: A Pragmatic Randomized Clinical Trial”, 
may have already been exposed and recovered.  Due to the pragmatic and emergent 
PREP COVID -[ADDRESS_414560] had prior exposure through assessment of IgG 
and IgM antibodies specific to COVID -19 viral proteins. Emerging literature suggests th at 
exposed and recovered patients or individuals develop persistent antibodies that can be 
detected in serum or plasma. Thus, participants with prior exposure (i.e. had presence of 
antibodies at baseline) can be excluded in secondary efficacy analyses. Sec ondly, end -
of-study collection will allow for definitive assessment of the percentage of healthcare 
workers  who seroconvert (i.e. negative at baseline, and positive at end -of-study) during 
the trial period in both dosing arms and the comparable placebo arm s. Finally, 
preservation of buffy coat (white blood cells) will serve as a source of DNA and RNA that 
can be used for subsequent host -derived factors that contribute to drug efficacy or 
exposure/seroconversion rates.  
OBJECTIVES  
In participants from the PRE P COVID -19 parent protocol, who choose to participate in this sub 
study, we will evaluate:  
Objective 1: Circulating antibody (IgG or IgM) presence specific for COVID -19 virus protein at 
baseline  
Endpoint 1:  ELISA from serum or plasma using baseline samples  
Objective 2:  Seroconversion from IgG/IgM negative -to-positive during the treatment period  
       Endpoint 2:  ELISA from serum or plasma using baseline samples and end -of-study samples  
Objective 3:  Evaluation of HLA -types and germline factors associated wi th outcomes  
Endpoint 3:  llumina MEGAEX 6 million SNP array or targeted next generation sequencing of HLA 
alleles, or other germline DNA testing

 Note:  The sample collection schedules outlined above are based on an ideal subject. The 
sample schedule should be followed as closely as is realistically possible; however, the schedule 
may be modified ( ± 4 business days) due to problems such as schedulin g delays or conflicts (e.g., 
clinic closure, poor weather conditions, vacations, etc.).

STORAGE AND SUPPLY  
EDTA tubes (lavender top): Institutional own supplies will be utilized, kits will not be shipped to 
participating sites  
Collected/ Processed/ Aliquoted Sample Storage  
For ALL peripheral blood specimens collected, processed, and aliquoted:  
Samples should be stored at -80C and shipped or transferred below on dry ice.  Samples should 
be removed from -80C storage and placed directly in a dry ice -containing shipper with suit able 
volume of dry ice for overnight transport, taking special care in summer/warm months.  
If shipment is not required (e.g. collected and processed at VUMC), samples can be batch 
couriered or transferred weekly to the Balko lab.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Correlative analyses will be compared to clinical endpoints on the parent protocol, particularly the 
primary endpoint of seroconversion during the treatment period. These exploratory analyses will 
be performed using the baseline and end of treatment blood collections, and are primarily 
descriptiv e in nature.  
Correlative analyses endpoints will be categorized as dichotomous variables. In exploratory 
analyses, patients will be stratified by [CONTACT_207375] (i.e. lack of seroconversion) to determine 
if the change in endpoint is associated with pati ent-specific clinical benefit from treatment.

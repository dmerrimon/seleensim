PROTOCOL:  ZMS -[ADDRESS_1003225] -operative hemorrhagic events are also quite 
frequent, occurring in as many as 13 to 19% of patients following various type of surgeries (i.e., major  
pancreatic resections, transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and 
living -donor transplants). Hemorrhagic shock is also a leading cause of death in trauma.1-[ADDRESS_1003226] -operative care and other 
thera peutic procedures.  Through early detection and improved hemodynamic monitoring, optimization 
of fluid balance, anesthesia titration, and augmenting other acute care management requirements, a 
clinician should be able to improve overall patient stability, minimize complications, diminish surgical 
trauma and reduce recovery time.  
Current methods for acutely monitoring blood volume and blood loss include monitoring of vital signs 
(such as heart rate, blood pressure , respi[INVESTIGATOR_1520], and oxygen saturation), invasive central venous (right 
heart central venous pressure measurement and Swan -Ganz pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_242264]) and arterial catheters designed to monitor hemodynamic status centrally.  Vital sign 
monitoring may not indicate small amounts of acute blood loss and arterial and venous cannulations can 
create inser tion complications such as perforations in the vasculature, pneumothorax, arrhythmias, 
thrombosis and infection.  While invasive central monitoring may provide extremely accurate information, 
changes may not be good indicators of early central hypovolemia or with smaller blood volume 
reductions1-2.  New non -invasive technologies have recently become available but often include many 
physiological parameters that may require expedited clinic al interpretation in high stress environments 
and have not become wel l-established.  
The Zynex Fluid Monitoring Sy stem, Model CM-[ADDRESS_1003227] approach by [CONTACT_105] -
invasively and simultaneously monitoring five (5) physiological parameters, including bioelectrical 
impedance, ECG amplitude, photoplethysmogram (PPG) amplitude, heart rate, and skin temperature. The 
CM Device  starts by [CONTACT_40397] a baseline for each patient in a normal state. When the monitoring session 
starts, each patient starts with a Relative Index of 100, signifying the collection of parameters near their 
original baseline value(s). The Relative Index value acts as a combinational score for all the parameters 
indicative of relative fluid change.  There are two (2) models of the CM Device, Model 1500 (CM -1500) 
and 1600 (CM -1600) which measure the same five (5) parameters and utilize the same algorithm to output 
the Relative Index value.

1.1 CLINICAL RATIONALE  
The proposed clinical study is designed to validate  that the  Zynex  non-invasive monitoring system  (CM -
1600 ) can track blood volume changes in healthy individuals consented to undergo a  blood donation.  An 
initial feasibility  study  was conducted (n = 12 subjects) to confirm that the CM -[ADDRESS_1003228] physiological parameters . 
Exploratory objectives of the study will include:  
• Characterize the d ifferences  in the relative changes in right vs left antecubital  blood  donations  
• Investigate any possible correlations between adverse events , subject demographics, changes in 
the Relative Index , and timing of when the events occurred  
2.2 STUDY DURATION  
Enrollment in the study is expected to take approximately six (6) months , and data analysis may take up 
to an additional two ( 2) months to complete.  
2.3 STUDY DESIGN  
The study is a prospective, non-randomized , non-blinded, non-significant risk, multi -center  study enrolling 
up to 500 healthy adult subjects consented to undergo a whole blood  donation procedure.  
The present study  will involve enrolling  subjects that will undergo blood donation wearing the study 
device (CM-1600 ) and capture  study -required physiological parameters pre -, during, and post -donation.   
2.[ADDRESS_1003229] physiological parameters. The change is defined 
as the value after donation minus the one before donation. The percentage of change is the change value 
divided by [CONTACT_734150]. Other endpoints such as area under receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) together with sensitivity and specificity at various thresholds are also derived for the 
Relati ve Index and  each of standard physiological parameters in detecting in detecting minor blood loss 
(i.e., 450 ml).

3 STUDY  DEVICE S  
3.1 FLUID MONITORING SYSTEM , MODEL CM-1600  
3.1.1 DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The CM -1600 is a non -invasive monitoring device predicated by [CONTACT_8888] -1500 that simultaneously 
monitors five (5) parameters of a patient’s body. Parameters include bioelectrical impedance, heart rate, 
ECG amplitude, PPG amplitude, and skin temperature. A combination of these parameters is represented 
by a single number known as t he Relative Index value. This value is indicative of relative changes in fluid 
volume. The Relative Index is a unique functionality of the Zynex Fluid Monitoring Sy stem.  
3.1.2 DEVICE DESIGN AND COMPONENTS  
The CM -1600 is an all -inclusive device that includes the following components: display monitor (1), power 
supply (1 ), wrist  wearable  (1), wrist strap (1), and electrode array set (2). The electrode array sets are 
single -use, single -subject.  
3.1.3 PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION  
The CM -1600 measures bioelectrical impedance (ohms), heart rate (BPM), ECG amplitude, PPG amplitude, 
and skin temperature (◦C or ◦F). As parameters change, towards indications of fluid change/imbalance, the 
Relative Index, which acts as a combinational score of percent change values for all of the parameters, 
will compound these changes into a singular value to signify overall fluid changes/imbalances within the 
patient’s body. When the monitoring session starts, every patient will start with a Relative Ind ex of 100, 
signifying the combination of physiological parameters is near or at their original baseline values for all 
five (5) monitored parameters. All parameters are continuously measured and tracked during a 
monitoring session.  
3.1.4 INDICATIONS FOR USE  
Per the device’s FDA 510(k)  submission , the CM -1600 is indicated for monitoring bioelectrical impedance, 
heart rate, ECG amplitude, and PPG amplitude and their relative changes, indicative of relative changes in 
fluid volume in adult patients.  
3.1.5 INTENDED USE  
Per the device’s FDA 510(k ) submission , the CM -1600 is intended to be used in professional medical 
environments, i.e., hospi[INVESTIGATOR_600], clinics, and research institutions. The CM -1600 is a standalone device 
intended for desktop use, where device operation is to be performed as uninterrupted patient monitoring. 
The CM -1600 shall only be used by a qualified and trained device operator. The device does not report 
any diagnosis but provides numerical values; it is ultimately the Investigator’s  responsibility to make 
proper diagnosis and judgments based on these values .

2) Minimum detectable difference after the donation = 1 RI unit  
3) Power 90% and one -sided alpha = 0.025  
A sample size of 455 will achieve about 9 0% power to detect a minimum difference of interest 1.[ADDRESS_1003249]  deviation of 6.5 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.[ADDRESS_1003250] for possible attrition or incomplete datasets/donations , 10% has been added to the sample 
size, therefore,  a total of [ADDRESS_1003251] deviation (SD), median, quartiles, 
minimum, maximum, and number of observations, unless otherwise specified. Categorical data will be 
summarized in terms of the number of subjects providing data at the relevant time point (n), frequency 
count, and percentage. Percentages will be calculated using n as the denominator.  
9.3.[ADDRESS_1003252]. If data are 
considered normally  distributed, the 95% CI  of the mean  will be constructed based on a t -distribution. 
Otherwise, if data are skewed, distribution -free confidence interval of the median  will be calculated.  The 
comparison between before and after blood donation  will be conducted by [CONTACT_669234] t -test or Wilcoxon 
signed -rank test , depending on the distribution of data.  
9.3.3 DEMOGRAPHIC AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
All baseline demographic variables collected at enrollment will be summarized  using descriptive statistics . 
9.3.4 PRIMARY ANALYSIS  
The following will cover the planned primary analyses  for this study procedure .  Unless otherwise 
specified, statistical analyses will be performed using two -sided hypothesis tests at the overall 5% 
significance level.  No multiple comparison adjustment s will be performed.  
1. Analysis of m easurements taken before and after blood donation  
Measurements including RI and individual physiological parameters  taken before and after blood 
donation will be first summarized using descriptive statistics. For each parameter, t he absolute and 
percent difference s before and after donation will be calculated  and summarized using summary statistics

together with 95% confidence interval . The p-value will be calculated using paired t -test or Wilcoxon 
signed -rank test  to compare with zero . 
2. Analysis of d ifferences between measurement taken before and after blood donation . 
The difference between measurement taken before and after blood donation  will be calculated by [CONTACT_734152].  
3. ROC Analysis  
Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) will be used to evaluat e the sensitivity and specificity  at various 
cutoff points  in detecting one Unit (approximate 450m L) blood  loss (donation)  using the RI. The ROC  
curves will be plotted using the data collected before and after donation, and the areas under the curves 
(AUCs) will be derived  together with a 95% confidence interval using an asymptotic approach . The ROC 
curves will be constructed for the percentage of decreases between RI measured before and after blood 
donation against the one Unit blood donation . Similar ROC analys es will be also conducted for each of  the 
individual physiological parameters. These ROC  curves will be plotted in an overlay format to demonstrate 
the difference in the detection of blood loss in t he various parameters and indices.  
Several cutoff points will be chosen to compare sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative 
predictive value, and positive and negative likelihood ratios . 
[ADDRESS_1003253]. In some instances , 
case report forms (CRFs)  will serve as source documentation. The Investigator or designated study 
personnel will provide the Sponsor redacted standard procedure records  with the subject ID number  as 
applicable . Any required data not collected as standard of care for the blood draw  procedure will be 
captured on study -specific case report forms.   
Corrections of data on paper source documents  will be made by [CONTACT_734153]-compliant correction. Each correction will be initialed and dated by [CONTACT_734154].  
The Investigator is responsible for the information collected on subjects enrolled in the study. All data 
collected during the study must be reviewed and verified for completeness and accuracy by [CONTACT_3786].  If any corrections are made after the Investigators signature, the Investigator will also initial 
and date the correction.  
10.1.[ADDRESS_1003254] will be kept in a safe and  secure 
location; access to these records will be on a limited basis. Only the subject  identification number, gender ,

10.2 DATA RETENTION  
All study records will be stored in a safe and secure location. Records will be retained per applicable 
regulatory requirements , which include for a period of two ( 2) years after the latter of the following two 
days: the date which the investigation is terminated or completed, or the date that records are no longer 
required for purposes of supporting premarket approval applications or a notice of completion of a 
produc t development protocol.  The Investigator site may transfer custody or records to the Spons or with 
appropriate documentation recording the transfer . 
10.3 MONITORING  
10.3.1  MONITORING  PLAN  
Monitoring visits will be conducted by [CONTACT_242283] 
21 CFR 812 . (c) for non -significant risk device studies and IC H Guidelines. By [CONTACT_12570], the 
Investigator grants permission to the Sponsor (or designee) and all appropriate regulatory authorities to 
conduct on -site or electronic monitoring or auditing  or both  of all appropriate study documentation.  
[ADDRESS_1003256] be allowed access to CRFs, 
source documents, and other study files. Audit reports will be confidential.  
11.2 PROTOCOL AND ICF AMENDMENTS  
Sponsor approval is required for any protocol or ICF amendment. Protocol or ICF amendments will not  be 
implemented without prior written IRB approval except as allowed per the IRB procedures/approval and 
as necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to subjects . A protocol amendment intended to 
eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects  may be implemented immediately, provided IRBs are 
notified within five (5) working days.  The Informed Consent Form will be reviewed and updated as 
necessary at the time of the protocol amendment.   
11.[ADDRESS_1003257] be documented and reported to 
the Sponsor within  ten (10) working days and reported to the IRB as applicable to regulatory 
requirements. Protocol deviations that pose an immediate risk or significant hazard to subjects must be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours  and reported to the IRB no later than  five (5) working days  after 
the emergency occurred . In the instance an Investigator uses a device without obtaining informed

consent ; the Investigator shall report to the Sponsor and the IRB within  five ( 5) working days  as per 21 
CFR 812.150 (1) (5) .  
12 ETHICAL AND OTHER REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
It is the responsibility  of the Investigator  that the  study is conducted according to the Declaration of 
Helsinki, Protection of Human Volunteers (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Board (21 CFR 56), and 
Responsibilities  of Clinical Investigators (21 CFR 812 (e)). 
12.[ADDRESS_1003258] (IRB) REVIEW  
The Protocol, ICF, and any subject facing material (as required) will be reviewed and approved by [CONTACT_734155]. The Sponsor will maintain responsibility for obtainin g IRB approval and submitting 
all required study reports to the IRB.  Amendments to the Protocol, ICF, or any subject facing material will 
not be implemented without prior written IRB approval unless to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard 
to subjects. All IRB approvals will be kept in the Trial Master File  and Investigator Site File . 
12.2 WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT  
The Informed Consent Form (ICF)  and Informed Consent process  will include all elements require d by 
[CONTACT_5279]. Informed consent will be obtained in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki,

Abstract : The study  intendeds to compare the current  standard  of care for prophylactic  
cefazolin administered  every  3 hours  intravenously  with continuous  infusion of cefazolin 
during pediatric  spi[INVESTIGATOR_61678] . Pharmacokinetics , skeletal  muscle  disposition and 
subcutaneous  adipose tissue penetration of cefazolin  under  both mode s of administration  
will be determined using  a clinical micro dialysis  technique .  
Background:   Surgical site infection (SSI) after posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_61679] (PSFS) is 
a devastating complication that frequently requires medical and surgical management  
beyond the expected recover y time . SSI’s are a common cause of nosocomial infection. 
The [LOCATION_002] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed 
criteria that define surgical site infection (SSI) as infection related to an operative 
procedure that occurs at or near the surgical incision within 30 days of the procedure or 
within 90 days if prosthetic material is implanted at surgery. SSIs are often localized to the 
incision site but can also extend into deeper adjacent structures (1) .  
Protocol  #201701129  Page 3 of 12 
IRB version 06 PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/27/[ADDRESS_66504] reported the risk of SSI in PSFS ranging from 1.3 to 6.3%  (2). The 
neuromuscular subgroup patients with spastic quadriplegia (cerebral palsy) have the 
highest incidence of infection (14.3%) compared to adolescent patients with idiopathic 
scoliosis (1. 5%) (3) . 
SSI can be prevented with adequate perioperative administration of prophylactic antibiotics. β lactam antibiotics are frequently recommended as a primary choice for 
perioperative prophylaxis in surgical patients owning to their broad- spectrum activity and 
generally good safety and tolerability profiles. Cefazolin , a first- generation cephalosporin,  
has been used as a suitable antibiotic  for PSFS because of its spectrum of activity (e.g., 
against Staphylococcus species and gram -negative bacilli such as E. coli) and adequate 
tissue concentrations (4) .   
Achieving and maintaining goal tissue concentrations of prophylactic antibiotics near the s
urgical site is  crucial to maximize their effectiveness. Tissue microdialysis is a technique 
used in clinical pharmacology to sample directly and continuously the free, unbound drug concentrations, including perioperative antibiotics, in the interstitial fluid of various tissues 
(5,6).  In brief, the probe is continuously perfused at a low flow rate  with an aqueous 
solution (perfusate) that closely resembles the (ionic) composition of the surrounding 
tissue fluid. Once the probe is implanted into the tissue, substances present in the 
extracellular fluid at concentration (c tissue) are filtered by [CONTACT_61692], resulting in a concentration (c dialysate ) in the perfusion medium. The 
solution moving through the probe (dialysate) is collected at certain time intervals for 
analysis. 
Because of constant perfusion of fresh perfusate, equilibrium between extracellular tissue 
f
luid and the perfusion medium is incomplete, resulting in c tissue > cdialysate . The factor by 
[CONTACT_61693]. To obtain intestinal concentration from dialysate, microdialysis probes need to be calibrated.  
Currently, the only published study by [CONTACT_61694].al prospectively evaluated the skeletal muscle disposition of prophylactic cefazolin using microdialysis sampling in a 
pediatric cohort with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing PSFS. They found that the skeletal 
Protocol  #201701129  Page 4 of 12 
IRB version 06 PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/27/2018    muscle concentrations of cefazolin achieved with 30mg/kg given every four hours for the 
duration of surgery was likely to be effective for intraoperative SSI prophylaxis against 
methicillin -sensitive Staphylo- coccu s aureus (MSSA) but might not be effective for 
intraoperative SSI prophylaxis against Gram -negative pathogens (7). Our study will be 
performed in a cohort of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis having PSFS.  During 
surgery , unbound cefazolin concentration at interstitial fluid of skeletal muscle and 
adipose tissue will be measured by [CONTACT_61695]. The comparison of 
cefazolin disposition in cohorts with two different modes of cefazolin administration will be 
recorded in skeletal and adipose tissue. End result of the study will be determination of  
the target attainment for unbound cefazolin of each administration regimen for 
intraoperative SSI prophylaxis against methicillin- sensitive Staphylo- coccus aureus 
(MSSA) and Gram -negative bacilli.  
Specific Aims:   Determine the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue disposition of 
prophylactic cefazolin using microdialysis sampling in a cohort of patients diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing posterior spi[INVESTIGATOR_61680] (PSF)  for administration of cefazolin 
by [CONTACT_61696] . 
Research Plan:   Following Institutional Review Board approval, we plan to recruit up to 
[ADDRESS_66505] and Legally Authorize Representative (LAR) expresses interest in the research, they will be given a letter introducing the study during 
their visit.  If they continue to express interest in learning more about the study, the 
surgeon and/or surgeons’ coordinator will notify the research coordinator who will meet 
with the patient and family in the pre- surgical clinic to discuss the study in detail.  If by 
[CONTACT_61697]- surgical clinic, the subject will be contact[CONTACT_61698].    Potential study participants will have time to 
read the consent, have all study related questions answered, and discuss the study with their family, if desired before consent is obtained.  Consent will take place either in the 
pre-surgical clinic or in the preoperative area.

Protocol  #201701129  Page 6 of 12 
IRB version 06 PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/27/2018    Group II  - Subjects randomized to Group ll will receive the second regimen:  
The second regimen will consist of an initial bolus dose of 30 mg/kg up to maximum of 
2000 mg. Following the initial bolus dose a continuous cefazolin drip will start until the end 
of surgery. Cefazolin drip dose will be 10 mg/(kg*h) up to maximum of 667 mg/h.  
Research Related Procedures:   Serial skeletal muscle and adipose tissue microdialysis 
samples will be obtained during the PSFS to measure unbound cefazolin concentrations  
in the interstitial fluid of both skeletal muscle and adipose tissue.  
A s et of four microdialysis catheters (CMA63; M Dialysis AB, Solna, Sweden) will be 
inserted percutaneously after induction of anesthesia. Two dialysis probes will be inserted 
into a paraspi[INVESTIGATOR_61682], with each catheter tip terminating approximately two vertebral 
bodies superior to the superior edge of the planned incision. And the other two probes 
will be inserted subcutaneously. The insertion procedure will be performed following a 
similar procedure as used in clinical practice for intravenous catheterization: The skin at 
the site of probe insertions is cleaned and disinfected. The surface of the skin is punctured 
by a needle. Thereafter, the probe is implanted into the tissue with help of an introducer, 
which is then removed, leaving the flexible probe under the surface of the skin in the 
tissue of interest. Each microdialysis system will be connected to a pump (107 
Microdialysis Pump)  with a flow rate of 1 μl/min for microdialysis sample collection. Prior 
to probe calibration, microdialysis catheters will be perfused with cefuroxime (calibrator; 
10 μg/mL)  in normal saline, where cefuroxime acts as a marker antibiotic of similar 
molecular size and physiochemical properties to the study antibiotics. Cefuroxime will assist in the determination of the rate of movement of molecules across the dialysis 
membrane according to the retrodialysis method. M icrodialysis sample s (approximately 
30 μL for each dialysate sample) will be taken at 30- min intervals  (+ or – 5 minutes)  
throughout the operative procedure. The recovery of cefazolin in the Microdialysate 
solution will be interpolated from the loss of calibrator (cefuroxime) across the 
microdialysis membrane:

Microdialysis catheters will be removed from the designated tissue using aseptic 
technique before emergence from anesthesia. All microdialysis samples will be stored at 
-80ºC until analysis.  
Plasma samples (approximately 2 mL each collected in K2EDTA -containing tubes) will 
be obtained from an arterial catheter timed relative to each cefazolin dose (pre- dose, 5, 
15 (+or- 5 minutes) , 30(+or - 5 minutes) , 60(+or- 5 minutes) , 90(+or- 5 minutes) , 120 (+or- 
5 minutes), 180(+or - 5 minutes)  and every 60 min afterwards (+or- 5 minutes)  until the 
end of surgery) and at the time of skin closure for standard cefazolin administration. If the patient receives continuous infusion, the plasma samples will be collected at 0 (pre- dose), 
5, 15(+or - 5 minutes) , 30(+or- 5 minutes) , 60(+or- 5 minutes) , 90(+or- 5 minutes) , 
120(+or - 5 minutes) , 180 (+or- 5 minutes), and every 60 min afterwards (+or - 5 minutes) 
until the end of surger y. Thus for a 6 hour procedure the blood collected should not 
exceed 22 ml or less than 5 Tsp. Blood samples will be centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 
mins and plasma will be transferred and stored at - 80ºC until analysis.  Both plasma and 
microdialysis sample s will be analyzed utilizing validated high- performance liquid 
chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS) methodology.  The probability 
of target attainment for unbound cefazolin concentrations at target site for MSSA and 
Gram -negative pathogens will be calculated in both groups.  
In order to put the PK information into perspective the following information will be collected from the patient’s chart:  patients age, sex, height, BMI, type of surgery, baseline 
Protocol  #201701129  Page 8 of 12 
IRB version 06 PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/27/[ADDRESS_66506] of Care:   These patients routinely receive cefazolin as part of their perioperative 
antibiotic regimen. Patients  routinely receive 30mg/ kg of cefazolin intravenously to the 
max up to 2000mg every [ADDRESS_66507] . 
 
Statistical  methods,  data analysis and interpretation  
Yichao Yu, BS will be the statistician  for the study. 
(1) Design.  Single -center, randomized dosing regimen pharmacokinetic study  
(2) Hypothesis.   The null hypothesis is that the probability of target attainment for 
unbound cefazolin in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are same for  continuous 
infusion of prophylactic cefazolin and the current standard mode of 
administration.  
Key  pharmacokinetic parameters ( Cmax, tmax, t1/2, CL, AUC) for cef azolin  will be 
determined from time profiles in plasma, subcutaneous adipose tissue and 
muscle by [CONTACT_3553] a commercially available software ( Phoenix® WinNonlin®, 
Pharsight Corporation, CA, [LOCATION_003] ). Plasma and t issue concentrations of cef azolin  
will also be related to published minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC) values 
to determine the time above MIC ( fT>MIC ), which is  the major outcome variables 
Protocol  #201701129  Page 9 of 12 
IRB version 06 PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/27/2018    of cefazolin pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics ( Cef-PD) factor in vivo for 
the comparison of two different modes of administration of prophylactic cefazolin.  
(3) Statistical Methods.  Statistical analysis and plots  will be performed using 
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, Washington, [LOCATION_003]) and R studio (R 
Studio Inc, [LOCATION_011], [LOCATION_005], [LOCATION_003]) . The probability of target attainment for 
unbound cefazolin can be determined as f T>MI C/Ttotal; ratios will be expressed 
as mean ± SD. The major analysis will be a comparison of median f T>MIC /Ttotal 
between two dosing regimen by [CONTACT_61700] -sum test. A p -value < 0.05, 
two-sided is considered statistically significant.  
(4) Randomization.  Up to [ADDRESS_66508] be assigned to Group I if the value is less 
than 0.5 and assigned to Group II if the value is greater than 0.5.  
(5) Sample size.  This exploratory pi[INVESTIGATOR_61683] a sample size of n=20. 
Background information needed to perform detailed power analysis are lacking.  
(6) Technical support.  The statistical design has been worked out by [CONTACT_61701] . Statistical analysis will also be carried out 
by [CONTACT_476] . 
 
Administrative  responsibilities

analysis  and will maintain the records  in confidence.  Should any evidence suggest  that 
the study  protocol  require  modification,  the PI [INVESTIGATOR_61685] a timely  manner for 
review  and approval.  Each  subject will be identified  by [CONTACT_6227],  not by [CONTACT_2300],  on all data 
forms.  To protect  confidentiality,  all data will be numerically  coded  and information 
linking  the numeric  codes  to individual  participant’s  names  will be kept in a locked file in 
the PI’s office.   
 
Protocol  #201701129  Page 10  of 12  
IRB version 06 PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/27/2018    Possible  Discomforts  and Risks: Microdialysis  catheter  placement  is a safe process  as it 
has been  done successfully in multiple  studies  over the years. Any adverse events  with 
microdialysis  catheter  will be monitored  up to the resolution of the adverse event  and 
reported.   Plastic  cannula  insertion  might  cause moderate pain.  The procedure of MD 
probe insertion  may cause pain comparable to a standard Intramuscular  (i.m.)  or 
Subcutaneous  (s.c.) injection.  This pain should vanish after a few minutes.  A minor  
hematoma at the site of the probe insertion cannot  completely  be excluded.  The risks of 
drawing blood  from a vein include  discomfort  at the site of puncture;  possible bruising 
and swelling  around  the puncture  site; rarely an infection;  and, uncommonly,  faintness  
from the procedure. 
Study participant’s identities will be kept strictly confidential. Confidentiality will be 
maintained by [CONTACT_19917] a number, which will be used in all data 
tabulation.  All findings from the study will be reported in a manner that precludes 
identification of any individual participant. These records, like all other study -associated 
records will be kept in the strictest confidence, and stored as encrypted files.  
There is no financial risk associated with participating in this study.  There will be no 
additional charges incurred from participating in this study than what would be normally 
charged if not enrolled within the study  
 
Possible Benefits:  Benefit of this study will be to determine if the addition of continuous 
intravenous infusion of antibiotic is superior to scheduled [ADDRESS_66509]:
 No conflict  of interest  exists for the PI [INVESTIGATOR_61686]-
Investigators.   
 
Safety Monitoring and Assessment  
The purpose of this study is to compare two different dosing regimens of prophylactic 
Protocol  #201701129  Page 11  of 12  
IRB version 06 PI [INVESTIGATOR_13949] 8/27/2018    cefazolin during PSFS by [CONTACT_61702], thus  there is low risk 
associated with the study.  
Safety review plan and Monitoring  
The principal investigator (PI) will be responsible for ensuring participants’ safety 
includes review of adverse events as well as study progress, data integrity and study 
outcomes. The monitoring procedures are delineated in the protocol. Only subjects who 
meet all inclusion criteria in the protocol will be enrolled in the study.  
Adverse event reporting plan  
All risks have been described in the consent form. All adverse events experienced by 
[CONTACT_61703]. Every 
adverse event that is reported to either the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_61687].  
As a subset of the reported adverse events, all serious adverse events, whether should they occur, whether study -related or expected, will be documented in serious and 
unexpected AE reporting form and reported by [CONTACT_61704] . 
In addition, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_61688]. Any unanticipated problems involving risks to 
subjects or others will also be reported to UF IRB per the IRB -01 Definitions and 
Reporting Guide. Aggregate reports of adverse events will be prepared at the end of the study for IRB review.

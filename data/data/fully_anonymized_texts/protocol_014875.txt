 
               Study Protocol : Sleep Disordered Breathing in Chronic SCI: A Randomized Controlled Trial of 
Treatment impact on Cognition, Quality of Life, and Cardiovascular Disease  
  Study ID: [REMOVED]  
 Last updated Nov ember 25, [ADDRESS_474145] injury (SCI) is universally recognized as a catastrophic disability impacting every aspect 
of life. The incidence of SCI within the US military is currently [ADDRESS_474146] or 
fourth  decade of life, and lifespan after SCI remains significantly foreshortened. Medical co-
morbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD) have emerged as leading causes of mortality in chronic SCI with a prevalence exceeding non -disabled individuals , and an accelerated trajectory in 
early life. 
4 Prevalence rates of asymptomatic and symptomat ic CVD in SCI populations range from 
approximately 25% to more than 50%. In contras t, among age -matched non- disabled populations  the 
prevalence of CVD is typi[INVESTIGATOR_378738] 5 –10%.5 
  In addition to  medical complications , 10 - 60% of individuals with SCI experience co-morbid cognitive 
impairments in the areas of processing speed, attention, memory, and cognitive flexibility.
6-[ADDRESS_474147] CV health, mood, emotional well -being, cognition, and health-
related quality of life (HRQOL).11-13 In particular, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) , characterized by 
[CONTACT_378768] (apnea) or marked reductions in airflow (hypopnea), sleep fragmentation, and frequent oxygen desaturations, is associated with impaired cognition, depression, greater susceptibility to pain, increased risk of stroke, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and perhaps even mortality in the general population.
14-19  
 A) Prevalence of Sleep Disordered Breathing in Persons with Spi[INVESTIGATOR_378739] -sectional studies  in persons with SCI  report  SDB prevalence rates  ranging from 27 -62%, 
depending on the acuteness of, and level  of injury; these rates are 2- 5 times higher than the 
general population.
20-22 In a longitudinal study of patie nts with tetraplegia, sleep apnea was present 
in 60% of subjects within four weeks of injury, reaching a peak incidence of  83% three months after 
injury .20 In cross sectional studies conducted by [CONTACT_2296], the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea 
(OSA -subset of SDB) ranged from 56% in those with incomplete tetraplegia  to as high as 91% in 
those with complete lesions  (cited reference and preliminary data).[ADDRESS_474148] of this disorder in the SCI population which is already at risk for many of the same secondary medical complications of SDB (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular disease, poor memory and 
concentration).  
 The prevalence of SDB in SCI is consider ably higher than general population estimates of 2 -
4%.
24 Unfortunately, there is a paucity of information on the underlying reasons for this  incre ased 
prevalence and more research is needed in this field. Obesity  is an important risk factor for SDB. 
Among the 6 million users of Veteran Health services, an alarming 2/3 of women and 3/4 of men are 
overweight  or obese. 25 A retrospective review of 7959 veterans with SCI reported that 37% were 
overweight and another 31% obese.[ADDRESS_474149] an increased neck 
circumference and spend more time  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_378740] , both known r isk factors for SDB  in the general 
population . However, these factors do not fully explain the increased prevalence of SDB in persons 
with SCI.27 In their 2001 retrospectiv e, case –contr ol study  of [ADDRESS_474150] level but not with ASIA impairment.21 In 2002, Stockhammer et al. demonstrated that 
SDB was significantly correlated with age, body mass index ( BMI), neck  circumference, and time after 
injury but not with lesion level or  ASIA impairment.[ADDRESS_474151] pressure ( PAP) therapy at any given SDB 
severity compared with able- bodied individuals with sleep apnea.29 
 Emerging data demonstrates  that the prevalence of SDB in SCI  is increased . Additionally,  the 
characteristic risks for , and subsequent response to therapy likely diff ers from the general 
population and deserves dedicated research to determine the nature and significance of SDB and its treatment in SCI  
 B) Cognit ive and Quality of Life  Conseque nces  of SDB  
 The cognitive functions most frequently and reliably reported as being affected by [CONTACT_378769], are vigilance, attention, memory, executive and motor functioning.
30,31 A meta -analytic 
review suggests that obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) has a moderate to severe impact on vigilance, 
motor coordination, and executive functions, while there is little effect on intelligence, verbal, an d 
visual- perceptual abilities.[ADDRESS_474152] SCI .
6-8,33 The intermittent hypoxia and frequent ly disrupted sleep 
associated with untreated SDB may worsen already existing cognitive deficits in the subset  of 
patients with  both SCI and SDB , leading to sub- optimal cognitive outcomes in this unique 
patient population.  Cardiovascular disease (seen commonly in chronic SCI and  in SDB) likely 
also plays a role in  this cognitive decline.[ADDRESS_474153] injury. Thirty percent 
(11 of 37) had moderate to severe SDB.  Neuropsychological measures of cognitive ability  were 
significantly correlated with measures of sleep hypoxia, with deficits cited in attention, concentration, memory and learning. Further, cognitive impairments sustained by [CONTACT_378770]- disabled population values. These 
deficits are likely to substantially prolong rehabilitation, reduce future independence, and limit vocational outcomes following injury ; all of which are essential benchmarks for successful 
community re -entry after injury.    
 Several studies have demonstrated that individuals with SDB  in the general population have a lower  
quality of life, than age - and gender -matched controls.  SDB effects man y different aspects of a 
person’s life, including physical, emotional, and social well -being.
[ADDRESS_474154] substantial potential to improve quality of life in this population.23 
 C) Cardiovascular Consequences of SDB  
 In the general population, c onsiderable evidence points to  the association between SDB and 
cardiovascular disease. This association is particularly s trong for systemic hypertension, observed in 
large population studies.16,37 In the Sleep Heart Health Study cohort, sleep apnea was found to be an 
independent  risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD) , congestive heart  failure,  cerebrovascular 
disease38, and cardiac arrhyt hmias, including atrial fibrillation and complex ventricular  arrhyth mias .[ADDRESS_474155] accepted in the field is 8-isoprostane (8- iso-PGF2α), a marker of 
lipid peroxidation .[ADDRESS_474156] steps in the p athogenesis of 
atherosclerosis.
45 The release of cel lular adhesion molecules can be stimulated by [CONTACT_378771], and oxidative stress, both increased in SDB . A variety of cellular adhesion markers, such 
as ICAM -1, vascular adhesion molecule- 1 (VCAM -1), E -selectin, and L- selectin, have been shown to  
be elevated in sleep apnea compared to controls. 46,[ADDRESS_474157] been associated with CVD .  
 D) Treatment of Sleep Apnea and Its Impact on Cognitive Measures in the General Population  
 Positive airway pressure therapy (PAP) has emerged as the most effective therapy for SDB in the general population. PAP is administrated by a small motorized unit that pushes pressurized air through a hos e attached to a mask strapped to the patient’s face.  PAP works as a “pneumatic splint” 
by [CONTACT_26129] a positive intraluminal pres sure, alleviating the  epi[INVESTIGATOR_378741] e 
characteristic of sleep apnea. PAP is an effective means of normalizing breathing, and eliminating the 
repetitive deoxygenation -reoxygenation cycles thought to be responsible for the oxidative stress 
burden of SDB. 
52-[ADDRESS_474158] no or minimal improvement in a battery of cognitive measures.31,59,60  
Studies in this area  are heterogeneous and vary by [CONTACT_378772], methodology, design, 
severity of SDB, duration of PAP prescription, and compliance with therapy.  One hypothesis that has 
emerged from these conflicting reports on PAP and cognition is that PAP only partially reverses measured cognitive def icits. The reasons for this partial reversibility is not entirely clear but may be 
due to the lack of sensitivity of existing cognitive measures and/or structural changes in the brain that are no longer reversible.
[ADDRESS_474159] on cognitive function. Indeed there is limited evidence in the literature that  suggests in other conditions with baseline cognitive deficits, treatment of SDB may lead 
to some improvement  in cognitive performance.
31 In a randomized trial of PAP treatment in mild 
Alzheimer’s disease, following 3 w eeks of PAP treatment, general cognitive performa nce improved 
within a  subset of patients with Alzheimer’s and sleep apnea.62 Subsequent analysis suggested those Obstructive Sleep

with Alzheimer’s and SDB who were adherent to PAP had a slower cognitive decline, especi ally in the 
domain of executive function and processing speed, exhibited stabilization of depressive symptoms 
and daytime somnolence, and showed significant improvement in subjective sleep quality.[ADDRESS_474160] of PAP therapy on cognitive measures in chronic 
SCI. 
 E) Impact of PAP on Cardiovascular Measures in the General Population  
In the general population, there is a growing body of literature that demonstrates the effectiveness of PAP in improving systemic blood pressure 
[ADDRESS_474161] 
studies report a reduction in TNF-α, IL-6, and hs -CRP  within 2 -4 weeks of therapy ; 66,[ADDRESS_474162]. Obesity, cardiovascular disease, smoking status, asthma, and other inflammatory 
conditions confound the association between SDB and systemic inflammation; many of the studies that do not report any improvement in inflammatory biomarkers with PAP may not have adequately 
addressed these confounders.  Two small studies have given conflicting results about  effects of PAP 
on adiponectin levels . One found an increase  in adiponectin levels after  [ADDRESS_474163]  of 
PAP in this uniquely vulnerable population.  
 F) Impact of PAP on Mood, Sleep Quality , and Quality of Life in the General Population  
There is limited information on the effect of PAP on mood in patients with SDB and the results have 
been mixed, with some studies reporting improvement  
[ADDRESS_474164] recent 
Cochrane systemic review  included 36 trials  of PAP therapy  and 1718 people. Study quality was  
mixed. Compared with control (sham or no therapy), PAP showed significant improvements in objective and subjective sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_378743], cognitive function , and d epression 
measures .

with PAP in acute SCI. These preliminary data form  the basis  for the much needed proposed 
study, a multi -center prospective, double -blinded randomized controlled trial ( RCT) designed 
to determine the impact of four months of PAP therapy on cognitive and CV measures in persons with chronic SCI.  
 G) Study Relevance and Applicability of Proposed Findings  
 There is a paucity of information on the impact of SDB and its treatment in chronic SCI . 
Despi[INVESTIGATOR_378744] , screening for SDB and its treatment are not yet 
standard of care. To enable change in practice, well -designed RCTs  are needed to demonstrate the 
importance of SDB and its treatment in the health of this population.  The following is a summary of perceived knowledge gaps and the beneficial impact of our proposed study:  
 
 
Aim: 
 Problem Being Addressed  Beneficial Impact of the Research  
1 Limited data exists on clinically 
relevant determinants of sleep quality and SDB  in persons with 
SCI. 
Very little is known about sleep quality and prevalence of sleep disorders in racially diverse persons 
with SCI . a) The research will quantify sleep 
quality, mood, pain, and presence of risks for SDB and insomnia in SCI  
participants using state -of-science 
evaluation techniques and validated instruments.  
b) The research brings needed attention to the problem of poor sleep quality and SDB after  SCI, particularly 
among underserved ethnically diverse persons  (Hispanic and Black) . 
c) In addition to questionnaires, sleep 
studies will be conducted using the gold standard of clinical polysomnography, which will provide the most discriminating evidence for diagnosis of SDB.  
d) A prevalent diagnosis of SDB will justify vigilance from health care providers in anticipat ing the risk, and  
provide treatment of this disorder.  
e) The research will develop a rich database of sleep disorders and clinical outcomes in minorities and 
underserved SCI  participants.  
1 Cognitive deficits in SCI  impair 
rehabilitation and long term social re-adaptation and vocational 
pursuits. SDB in general, has been associated with impairments in 
memory, attention, and executive a) The research will identify the 
associa tion between SDB and 
cognitive impairments in SCI  by [CONTACT_2329] 
a battery of well -defined neuro-
psychological tests and comparing

SCI participants w ith SDB may 
indeed demonstrate worse cognitive impairment in these domains .  
More study is needed to determine the full extent of the interaction between SDB and SCI  and their 
combined impact on cognitive function . results between those with and 
without SDB.  
 
b) Additionally, other factors that may impact cognitive performance including pain severity, mood, pre-morbid intelligence, duration of injury, presence of insomnia, and use of sedating medications will be measured and included in a multivariable regression model to 
better delineate the impact of each of these factors and SDB on cognitive  
impairment.  
[ADDRESS_474166] of PAP on surrogate CV biomarkers, mood, and quality of 
life in this population is unknown.  a) The research will determine  the 
effectiveness of PAP in treating SDB 
in chronic SCI using gold standard research methodology (RCT) .  
 b) The research will provide the empi[INVESTIGATOR_378745] . 
 c) The research will examine population- specific compliance levels 
in PAP use, and identify whether compliance influences health- related 
outcomes.  
 
d) Our clinical trial will identify the 
impact of PAP therapy on cognitive measures, mood, quality of life, and surrogate CV endpoints. All these measures are relevant to the emotional and physical well -being of 
participants with chronic SCI and will 
likely have a practical impact on day to 
day living in this population.  
 Objectives/Specific Aims/Hypotheses The proposal  describes a multi -center double blinded, placebo controlled randomized trial (RCT) 
designed to examine the impact of SDB treatment in persons with chronic SCI.  The central 
hypothesis  is that the treatment of SDB with PAP will improve cognition, sleep quality, HRQOL, and 
CVD surrogate measures in persons with chronic SCI. The specific aims  and hypotheses  of the 
proposed research are:  
 
Specific 
Aim 1 Determine the associations between sleep disordered breathing  (SDB) and 
cognitive impairments in chronic SCI and the impact of PAP therapy on cognitive 
measures in a cohort with chronic SCI and SDB.  
   Hypothesis 1a: Compared with patients without SDB, patients with SDB will exhibit 
more severe and widespread cognitive impairments  (in memory, attention, and 
executive fu nction), while controlling for depression, pain severity, duration of injury, 
level of injury, sedative use, and pre- morbid intelligence  
  Hypothesis 1b: SCI participants who are randomized to four months of therapeutic 
PAP will show improvement in cognitive measures (memory, attention, and executive 
function) compared with those receiving sham PAP.  
Specific 
Aim [ADDRESS_474167] of PAP therapy on sur rogate CV biomarkers, sleep quality, 
quality of life, mood, and pain in a cohort with chronic SCI and SDB.  
  Hypothesis 2a:  SCI participants randomized to four months of PAP will show an 
improvement in CV biomarkers (hs -CRP, TNF -a, VCAM -1, adiponectin, and 8-
isoprostane) compared with sham PAP.  
  Hypothesis 2b: Sleep quality, quality of life, mood, and pain will improve in SCI 
participants receiving PAP and stay the same or worsen in those randomized to sham 
PAP.  
 Research Strategy and Study Design  
Study Overview:  
During the 4- year study period we will screen  200 SCI participants  who meet eligibility criteria  and 
consent to participate with portable level II  polysomnography (PSG) and randomize  [ADDRESS_474168] SDB to auto- PAP or sham PAP . Partici pants will be recruited from  the University of Miami 
(Miami Projec t to Cure Paralysis), the Miami VA,  Wayne State University  (Michigan Rehabilitation 
Institut e), and affiliated Detroit VA through  their outpatient SCI clinics and/or inpatient rehabilitation 
units.  Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires measuring sleep quality (SQ), SDB risk, insomnia severity, daytime sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008], pain severity, mood, and HRQOL. They will undergo an overnight, at home (or if hospi[INVESTIGATOR_057], in the hospi[INVESTIGATOR_39223]) portable unattended  PSG  performed at 
their normal sleep time. Subjects with an apnea- hypopnea index (AHI) ≥  10 events/hr will be 
randomized to receive 4 months of auto- PAP therapy or PAP set at a fixed pressure of  3 cmH20 
(sham PAP).  
 We will perform neuro- psychological evaluations  prior to randomization on all participants who 
complete a portable PSG to evaluate general and  pre-morbid function, immediate verbal  memory, 
simple and sustained attention, processing speed, and executive function. Selection of these 
particular cognitive measures reflect s impairments in these domains observed in patients with SDB 
within the general population .
14,30,32,[ADDRESS_474169] examined the potential role 
of SDB in cognitive impairment in SCI participants.   
 One cognitive measure ( PASAT)  and 3 sleep questionnaires ( PSQI, FOSQ and ESS) will be repeated 
at 1 month follow -up in those randomized to therapy or placebo. Complete n euro- psychological 
evaluations will be repeated at the 4 month follow- up time point  in those with SDB who were 
randomized to PAP or sham PAP  (primary outcomes).  All measures obtained from these repeated 
assessments will be subject to a Reliable Change Index analysis to control for potential practice 
effects .
79 We will obtain blood and urine samples for measurement of CV biomarkers  at time of 
randomization and the four m onth follow- up. Additionally, s leep and quality of life questionnaires will 
be repeated at four month follow -up (secondary outcomes).    
 Study Population:  
We will perform unattended portable  level II  PSG on  SCI participants from the  Miami and Detroit  
study sites (100 from each site) who meet the following eligibility criteria:  
Inclusion Criteria:   
• Chronic  tetraplegia or paraplegia (C4-L1), American Spi[INVESTIGATOR_222597] (ASIA)  
Impairment Scale A, B, C an d D 
• 18 years and older  
• At least one year post  injury  
• Hearing and vision suitable for comprehension of instructions, and perception of cognitive test 
stimuli  
• No color blindness as measured by a brief screen with color perception Ishihara cards  
• Stable medical condition for 2 weeks prior to enrollment. Patients admitted to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_378746] 2 
weeks or longer  
 Exclusion Criteria:   
• Diagnosis of SDB and successful positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy prior to injury. Those with a diagnosis of SDB post  injury who are not receiving therapy for SDB (PAP, surgical, 
and/or oral appliance) are eligible for study enrol lment  
• Patients who are intubated, have a tracheostomy, and/or are using long term invasive/non-invasive positive pressure ventilation  
• Participants with predominant central sleep apnea on PSG requiring bi -level PAP therapy  
• Severe traumatic brain  injury (GCS < [ADDRESS_474170] assessment)  
• Unable to understand or read English at a grade 5 level  
• Inability to provide informed consent  
• Evidence of advanced neurological or systemic disease that may affect cognitive functioning 
(e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, Dementia, Parkinson’s disease)  
•  Significant aphasia or language impairments  
 Randomization Protocol  
Participants who meet above eligibility criteria and are diagnosed with SDB  with AHI ≥ 10 will be 
randomized to treatment with either auto- PAP or fixed PAP set at 3 cmH20 (sham PAP). It is 
anticipated that [ADDRESS_474171] AHI ≥ 10 (50 from each site) and undergo randomization to treatment or placebo in a 1:1 ratio  within each center .  
 The randomization sequence will be generated by [CONTACT_378773] a computer -generated 
random -number table. The randomization numbers will be placed in se rially numbered, sealed, 
opaque envelopes  available to the study PI /site PI . The study coordinator  from each site will request 
an envelope to be open ed by [CONTACT_978] [INVESTIGATOR_378747]. The study coordinator and the 
participant s will be blinded to treatment assignment. Interpretation of study results will occur blind to 
study arm  assignment .   
 Intervention  
All randomized subjects will be fitted with a nasal or full -face mask and head gear. PAP will be 
delivered by [CONTACT_112615]- titrating device (Resmed S9-Autoset, San Diego [LOCATION_003]). These devices 
automatically set the level of delivered pressure to ensure upper airway patency,  to treat detected 
apneas and hypopneas , thereby [CONTACT_378774] a pressure titration sleep study to be 
performed in the sleep laboratory.  Auto-PAP has been successfully used in several patient 
populations and may improve compliance with PAP. 
80-83 Participants who are random ized to the 
placebo arm will receive an auto -PAP device that is set to a fixed low pressure of 3 cmH20 without an 
ability to titrate according to detected respi[INVESTIGATOR_29343]. The pressure is too low to eliminate respi[INVESTIGATOR_378748] -therapeutic  PAP (placebo PAP) . Additionally, six extra 
[ADDRESS_474172] present the PAP “Smartcard” for download and interpretation.  To 
increase patient compliance and decrease variance in outcomes introduced from differing degrees of exposure to the intervention, we will employ standardized procedures for management of PAP currently employed at University of Miami PAP clinic. These include instructing subjects on machine and mask  use and regular phone follow -up for troubleshooting as necessary. The study PI [INVESTIGATOR_378749] (RA)  to contact [CONTACT_378775]. This is will be done for both 
arms of the study. The RA will not be aware of the details of the compliance report or machine pressure delivered to maintain blinding. Daily compliance will be reported as the total number of 
hours of PAP use per 24 hour period. Patients who use PAP > 4 hours/night for more than 50% of the 
nights at 4 month follow -up will be classified as PAP compliant . 
 Baseline Measurements All Subjects: At the Miami and Detroit  sites the study RA will approach 
SCI individuals identified by [CONTACT_9154]  [INVESTIGATOR_7706]- investigators  to determine eligibility for participation 
in the study. Upon consent, we will ask participants to complete several questionnaires detailed 
below. We will schedule participant s for a single night unattended portable home PSG within one 
week  of enrollment to evaluate sleep architecture and diagnose SDB. The RA at each site will review 
medical records to document medical and psychological co-morbidities, medication use, laboratory 
data, spi[INVESTIGATOR_378750], ASIA classification, and duration of injury.  We will interview participants 
during their enrol lment visit to obtain a medical/sleep history, and anthropometric measures (height, 
weight, neck circumference, and abdominal girth at end  expi[INVESTIGATOR_1516]).  Whenever possible  the RA or 
PI/site PI [INVESTIGATOR_378751].
86,87 Additionally, we will 
use the international SCI CV function basic data set to obtain information about CV co- morbidity.88 
Cognitive testing will be completed at baseline on all subjects who complete portable PSG.  Figure 2 
outlines study flow and measurements. 
 We will obtain the following respi[INVESTIGATOR_378752]: a) AHI : defined as the number of 
apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, b) arousal index (AI): the number of  arousals per hour of 
sleep, c) percentage of total sleep time (TST) spent with arterial oxygen saturation (Sa- O2) < 90%, d) 
mean minimum Sa- O2, and e) oxygen desaturation index 4% (ODI4), defined as the number of four 
percent desaturation events per hour of study time. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_378753] 
(AASM ).
89 We will define SDB as an AHI ≥ 10 . We will score hypopneas initially using alternative 
rules  (>50% reduction in airflow with 3% desaturation or arousal) . We will rescore using 
recommended rules (>30% reduction in airflow with 4% desaturation). In the sleep research community, there is currently no clear  consensus on which scoring method  is preferred. SDB 
prevalence rates reported in the literature differ depending on the definition used.
90 Consequently , we 
will perform all analyses with both definitions  in mind  and report any differences in observed 
associations .  
 
Questionnaires :  
All participants will be asked to complete questionnaires described below. Questionnaires are 
validated and have been used successfully in prior SCI and SDB research. The RA will hand out the 
questionnaires and allow the participant to complete them in a private setting.  The RA will be 
available to answer any questions that may arise and will check the returned questionnaires for 
completeness.  All questionnaires are found in Appendix 10.  
  Sleep Questionnaires  
1) Sleep Quality (SQ):  We will assess sleep quality using the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_2272] (PSQI).[ADDRESS_474173] reliability of 
this instrument has been extensively studied. A global PSQI score greater than 5 yields a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5% (kappa = 0.75, p < 0.001) in distinguishing ‘good’ and ‘poor’ sleepers.
92,93  
2) Chronic Insomnia:  We will use the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) to assess insomnia in the study 
population. It consists of eight items: the first five pertain to sleep induction, awakenings during the night, final awakening, total sleep duration, and sleep quality; while the last three items refer to well -
being, functioning capacity, and sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_202904]. Reliability and validity for the instrument have been well documented. 
94,95 
3) Screening for SDB:  We will screen for increased risk of SDB using the Berlin questionnaire (BQ). 
This is a validated questionnaire with good performance characteristics in the general population.96 It 
has been successfully used by [CONTACT_378776] (see preliminary data).  
4) Daytime Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008]:  Epworth Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_111284] (ESS) is a valid measure of subjective daytime 
sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_008].97 Eight items are rated on a scale of 0– 3, total scores range 0 –24, with higher scores 
indicating a greater propensity to fall asleep in different situations. In samples of sleep apnea patients, it shows high internal consistency and correlates well with objective measures of sleep latency.
98-100It has successfully  been used in SCI individuals.22 
5) Impact of Sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_378754]:  The Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ) is 
the gold- standard, disease specific instrument designed to assess the impact of  sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_378755]. 101 The FOSQ has proven validity and reliability, and is sensitive to 
treatment changes. 102,103 There are 30 items, which are divided into 5 scales: Activity, Vigilance, 
General Prod uctivity, Social Outcome, and Intimacy and Sexual  Relationships. These scales are 
summed to make a total score. Higher scores on the FOSQ indicate self -perceived better daily 
functioning. The FOSQ has been used by [CONTACT_378777] a previous study of acute SCI and sleep disorders.

a well- validated and reliable instrument that has been successfully used with SCI populations to 
evaluate anxiety.117-119 
3) Assessment of Pain: Presence and severity of pain will be determined by [CONTACT_378778][INVESTIGATOR_378756] (ISCIBPDS)  recently validated in persons with SCI.120,[ADDRESS_474176] II consensus recommendations for evaluating pain outcomes in clinical 
studies, 122 we will determine the presence and severity of pain by a written numerical scale.  Ranging 
from 0 to 10, with 0 meaning ‘No pain’ and 10 meaning ‘Pain as bad as you can imagine,’ the scale will be accompanied by [CONTACT_101037], “Please rate your pain by  [CONTACT_378779].” We will also use a verbal rating scale to measure pain intensity over the preceding week (none, mild, moderate, severe) as a secondary pain outcome measure.  
 
Polysomnography : We will conduct portable in home Level II PSG in accordance with standards 
established by [CONTACT_140671] 123. We will use  the Embletta x100 portable recording unit. The PSG 
recording montage consists of two electroencephalographic channels (EEG -C3 and C4), left or right 
electroculogram (EOG), chin muscle electromyogram (EMG), nasal cannula (NP -measure of airflow), 
thoracic and abdominal respi[INVESTIGATOR_378757], body -position sensor, and pulse oximetry. The 
trained RA will connect participants to t he device  in the outpatient clinic or inpatient room. The 
Embletta x100 will record o vernight events . We will teach the participant and/or caregiver how to 
disconnect from the device prior to returning it to the clinic the following day. Portable sleep studies 
have been successfully used in outpatient clinical and research settings.123-[ADDRESS_474177] will perform manual scoring using 30 second epochs and standardized 
scoring techniques recommended by [CONTACT_378780].
89 Drs. Shafazand and Wallace will review all scored 
epochs and interpret the overall sleep study.  PSGs performed by  [CONTACT_378781].  
 Specific Aim 1: Determine the associations between sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and 
cognitive impairments in chronic SCI and the impact of PAP therapy on cognitive measures in a cohort with chronic SCI and SDB.  
 Protocol:  [CONTACT_94795] -Greene will train RAs at both sites  to perform a battery of comprehensive, 
cognitive assessments to obtain a global evaluation of cognitive functioning  in all subjects with SCI  
who undergo PSG. The particular emphasis is on measures related to cognitive impairment common in persons with SDB.
30 Administration of these tests by [CONTACT_378782].127  Sample protocol sheets and stimuli for 
each cognitive measure can be found in Appendix 10.  
 
1) Pre -morbid Functioning:   
WIDE RANGE ACHIEVEMENT TEST – IV (READING SUBTEST)128: The WRAT -IV Reading Subtest 
is a norm -referenced test that measures the basic academic skill of word reading.  It was 
standardized on a representative national sample of over 3,000 individuals ranging in age from 5 to 
94 years. Higher scores are indicative of better sight reading abilities and can serve as a proxy for pre-morbid intellectual functioning.  
 
2) Simple and Divided Attention: 
a) DIGIT SPAN SUBTEST OF THE WECHSLER ADULT INTELLIGENCE SCALE –IV129: The digit 
span subtest requires the individual to repeat a series of numbers in the same order, or in reverse order, than orally provided by [CONTACT_378783]. Low scores on the digit span subtest suggest limited attention, while higher scores indicate a greater ability to concent rate and attend to orally 
presented information.  
 b) PACED SERIAL ADDITION TEST (PASAT): The PASAT measures divided, attentio n and working 
memory;  cognitive domains that have been shown to be particularly salient to SDB.  The individual 
being tested is given single digits at fixed intervals  administered by a computer, and needs to add the 
current number to the last number on each successive presentation.  The participant provides verbal 
responses and the examiner records the responses on a scoring sheet.  Lower scores indicate greater 
impairment of attention. 
130-132 The PASAT is the primary outc ome measure for this study.  
 
3) Processing Speed:   
SYMBOL DIGIT MODALITIES TEST (SDMT)133: The SDMT is a substitution task that requires the 
individual being evaluated to replace symbols with the numbers assigned to them on a reference key. A time limit is imposed to complete the task. Only the oral version of the SDMT will be administered requiring verbal responses. The SDMT has shown excellent reliability, sensitivity, and validity.
134-136 
 
4) Memory:  
HOPKINS VERBAL LEARNING TEST -REVISED (HVLT -R): The HVLT -R is an assessment of verbal 
learning and memory, co mposed  of three learning trials, a delayed recall trial, and a delayed 
recognition trial. It has high test -retest reliability and validity, and has been used in studies of 
participants with  chronic medical conditions. 137,138 
 
5) Executive Function:  
WISCONSIN CARD SORTING TEST -64 (WCST): The WCST -[ADDRESS_474178]. Johnson- Greene at Miami site who will be blinded to study 
arm assignment.  
 Specific Aim 2 : Determine the impact of PAP therapy on surrogate CV biomarkers, sleep 
quality, quality of life, mood, and pain in a cohort with chronic SCI and SDB.  
 Given the increased prevalence of CVD and its associated morbidity, mortality and health costs in the SCI population
4,5, much attention has been paid in recent years to identifying and modifying 
traditional and nontraditional CVD risk factors  in SCI. SDB is likely  to be a nontraditional, but 
modifiable risk factor . Our study will be the first to evaluate in persons with chronic SCI, the 
association between SDB and surrogate cardiovascular biomarkers and the impact of PAP 
therapy on these measures.  
 
Biomarkers  
We will measure inflammatory cytokines ( TNF-α and hs -CRP ), a cellular adhesion molecule (VCAM -
1), a marker of oxidative stress (urinary 8- isoprostane), and adiponectin at baseline prior to PAP 
intervention and at four month follow -up. 
 
Blood collection and sample preparation Participants will be instructed to refrain from caffeine and alcohol intake for [ADDRESS_474179] -absorptive 
state after an overnight (10h) fast, and will be drawn between 8:00 and 10:00 am. Ten milliliters of 
fasting blood will be obtained in EDTA -containing vaccutainer tubes or clot lysis activator tubes and 
centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1200 x g to obtain platelet poor plasma or serum, respectively.  
 After centrifugation, the serum or plasma are transferred to a new  labeled tube and kept on ice or at 
4°C until aliquots are prepared for storage.  If multiple tubes are needed to obtain the requisite volume of sample, then samples from individual tubes will be pooled prior to preparation of sample aliquots. For freezing, aliquots of serum, plasma or urine will be added to appropriately labeled and identified cryogenic vials suitable for storage at ultra- low temperatures on the day of sample 
collection.  Tube size will be dictated by [CONTACT_378784].  Sample vials will be placed in 
containers and frozen at ≤ -70°C until shipped to the laboratory for analysis.  Samples to be shipped 
frozen will be placed in approved Styrofoam shippi[INVESTIGATOR_378758] a frozen state for at least [ADDRESS_474180] the lid on the container carefully and tightly and bring the specimen as soon as possible on the same day to the RA. For those participants who self -cathet erize, urine specimens can be collected from catheters 
(e.g. Foley catheter) using a syringe, followed by [CONTACT_378785] a specimen tube or cup.  We will 
normalize urinary 8- isoprostane measurements  to urinary creatinine levels to account for differences 
in dilution.  
 Biochemical Assays  
Quality control procedures:   For all quantitative metabolic and biomarker measures, the laboratory 
follows guidelines established by [CONTACT_378786] (CLIA) for quality control and proficiency testing.  Each assay run must meet established quality control guidelines before results are accepted and reported. Sufficient stocks of control lots are maintained for long- term 
monitoring of assay precision and monitoring of long- term drift.  
   
Clinical Laboratory and Biomarker Testing:   Chemistry and immunoelectro-che miluminescence 
(IECL) assays are performed by [CONTACT_378787] a [COMPANY_002] Cobas 6000 analyzer following all manufacturer’s instructions for instrument maintenance and assay calibration and test procedures.  ELISA testing is performed by [CONTACT_378788].

Sleep, Quality of Life, and Mood  
Sleep quality, quality of life, mood and pain will be evaluated at baseline and four months follow -up in 
each study arm using questionnaires, according to methodology described above.  
 
Data Analysis:   
Feasibility:  The SCI Service at Miami VA actively serves approximately [ADDRESS_474183] studies and volunteered additional 
participation. The database currently contains 3400 persons whose ages and levels of injury match the sought study participants.  The Detroit VA SCI service oversees the ca re of greater than  100 
patients/ year. The Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan provides  care for 350 SCI individuals . We 
anticipate completion of enrol lment by [CONTACT_378790] 4, with 100 patients enrolled for 
PSG from each site.  
 
Sample size justification and power : We will recruit [ADDRESS_474184] (PASAT).[ADDRESS_474185] a mean difference of 7 units . 
Assumin g a PAP non -adherence rate and/or loss to follow -up of 40 %, we will continue to have 
sufficient power  (81%)  to detect such a difference with our proposed sample size of 100. These 
findings would be in keepi[INVESTIGATOR_378759]-disabled  patients with SDB vs. 
controls 131, and PASAT performance in other populations (e.g. multiple sclerosis, mild traumatic 
brain injury) 132.  
 
Plann ed analyses:  We will score questionnaires while blind to PSG data  and group allocation using 
instructions provided by [CONTACT_378791]. We will first examine continuous variables for 
normality.  For those variables without a normal distribution,  we will explore appropriate 
transformations in an attempt to achieve normality.  Continuous variables will be summarized as 
means and SD, and categorical variables will be summarized as frequencies. Prevalence of poor SQ will be calculated as the proporti on of individuals who complete the PSQI with a score of ≥ 5. 
Prevalence of insomnia will be calculated as the proportion of individuals who complete the AIS with a 
score ≥ 6. Prevalence of SDB will be calculated as the proportion of individuals who undergo PSG 
with AHI ≥ 10 /hr.  
 To determine baseline  associations between SDB and cognitive measures  (Hypothesis 1a) , we will 
develop Generalized linear models (GLM), with each of the cognitive variables as dependent variables and presence or absence of SDB as an independent variable. The analyses will be repeated with AHI or ODI4 (measures of SDB severity) as independent variables. We will control for other co- variates including age, depression, anxiety, HRQOL, pain severity, duration of injury, level of 
injury, use of sedating medications, and presence of insomnia.  For all GLM developed, the data may 
be transformed to meet the normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions of the analysis.  
 Primary Hypothesis  (Specific aim 1, Hypothesis 1b)  
A test of the  primary null hypothesis, that PAP intervention does not increase mean PASAT score 
against the 1- sided alternative hypothesis that PAP intervention increases mean PASAT, will be 
based on a general linear model (GLM ). PASAT sco re is modeled as a function of PAP intervention, 
using an indicator variable with [ADDRESS_474186], which will be carried out at α= 0.05. If the null hypothesis of no effect is rejected, 
computation of 95% confidence limits on the estimate of treatment difference in PASAT score mean will be carried out.  
 Secondary Hypotheses  
A second phase of analysis will focus on CV biomarkers and measures of sleep quality, quality of life, 
mood and pain. These analyses are considered exploratory in nature and hence will benefit from comparisons within as well as between groups.   
 For within group contrasts, initial observations serve as baseline for assessing the effect of treatment at [ADDRESS_474187] to control the false positive inference rate at the category level. We will apply a False Discovery Rate (FDR) criterion of 5% separately for each category, thereby [CONTACT_378792].  
 Primary analyses will be conducted in accordance with the intention -to-treat principle. We will also 
repeat analyses using a per protocol viewpoint . We will use statistical software, SPSS for Windows  
version [ADDRESS_474188] injury within a closed

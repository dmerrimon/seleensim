A tension headache is generally a diffuse, mild to moderate pain in your head that's often described 
as a dull, aching head pain that feels like a tight band around your head. They can be epi[INVESTIGATOR_869966]. They are the most common type of primary headaches and affects approximately 
80% of the population. Because of its high prevalence, the socio -economic consequences of tension 
type headache are significant as they are associated with incr eased depression, anxiety, insomnia 
and overall decrease in quality of life. [4] In one population study, persons with epi[INVESTIGATOR_869967] a mean of nine lost work days and five reduced -effectiveness days, while 
persons with chronic ten sion type headache reported a mean of [ADDRESS_1214416] work days and 20 reduced -
effectiveness days .[17] The burden is particularly high for the minority who has substantial and 
complicating co -morbidities . [18] 
The two main therapeutic avenues of tension type heada che are acute and prophylactic treatment. 
Simple or combined analgesics are the mainstay of acute treatment. Prophylactic treatment is 
needed in case of attacks that are frequent and/or difficult to treat. [4]  
All efforts to develop nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which are devoid of 
gastrointestinal and cardiovascular system effects are still far from achieving a breakthrough. In 
order to avoid medications but still receive treatment for pain, there has been some existing 
research completed, demonstrating effective all natural solutions, such as  sublingual 
feverfew/ginger as a first -line abortive treatment for a population of migraineurs who frequently 
experience mild headache prior to the onset of  moderate to severe headache. [11, 3]  
Consequently, HLNatural  was formed to create an all-natural, herbal remedy product that is 
designed to avoid unnecessary synthetics, sweeteners, and preservatives found in over the counter 
remedies today while still pr oviding safe and effective relief. Tension Relief test  product  is a plant -
based remedy formulated with herbal and mineral ingredients with reported potential to reduce 
symptoms of a tension headache. The products combine ingredients previously reported as 
potentially beneficial into an easy -to-consume capsule designed for intake up to three  times per 
day. The test product is 1) Magnesium Glycinate, 2) Boswellia (40% Boswellic Acid), 3) White Willow 
Bark (15% Salicin), 4) Skullcap, 5) Feverfew, 6) a vegetari an capsule made of cellulose and water, and 
7) Rice Hull Concentrate. Below, the  [ADDRESS_1214417] are listed. All ingredients are 
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by [CONTACT_1622].  
Tension Relief  
Active Ingredients: Magnesium (as Magnesium glycinate), Boswellia (40% Boswellic acids), 
White Willow Bark (15%Salicin), Skullcap, Feverfew . 
10 
 Inactive Ingredients: Vegetarian capsule (vegetable cellulose, water), Rice Hull Concentrate .  
The ingredients in the Tension Relief test product have been included because they are potentially 
beneficial in promoting both head and body comfort. The justifications for their inclusion are briefly 
described here:  
 
Magnesium  is an important mineral in the body that acts as a cofactor to many physiological 
processes, and it is estimated that the majority of Americans do not get enough from the diet. 
Scientific investigation has confirmed that Magnesium improves cognition, promotes comfort, while 
also inc reasing calmness and energy. For example, in a clinical study of 78 people magnesium 
supplementation resulted in both significantly increased head comfort, but also increased brain 
energy. [16]  
 
Boswellia  is also known as guggle or frankincense. Boswellia has had mounting scientific research 
which confirms its use for a number of pain -relieving conditions.  This is mainly due to its confirmed 
activity of promoting cytokine balance and comfort. Boswellia extracts have gained attention 
additionally because th eir mechanism of action is entirely different than that of the NSAIDs. The 
Boswellic acids inhibit the enzyme 5 -LOX (5 lipoxygenase), thereby [CONTACT_869986]. Clinical trials have shown efficacy for promoting comfort and cytokine balance in 
different body systems. For example, one clinical study found Boswellia to promote long -lasting 
head comfort. Several other clinical studies found Boswellia to promote both joint comfort and 
cytokine balance. [6, 9, 11, 20]  
 
 
White Willow Bark is included for its ability to promote both head and body comfort. Although 
White Willow Bark is famous as being a source of salicylates, from which salicylic acid and Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_869968], its activity is thought to not be due to just this component. Whit e Willow Bark extract 
also contains other phytochemicals, such as antioxidant flavonoids and bioactive tannins, which are 
thought to play a synergistic role in promoting cytokine balance and head and body comfort.  For 
example, an extract of willow bark wa s found to inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) -[ADDRESS_1214418] beneficial effects while being tolerated much better 
than Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248]. For example, in a Cochrane systematic review of studies, White Willow Bark 
(standardized to 120 -240 mg salicin) was found to significantly promote comf ort in the short -term 
compared to placebo. [2, 15, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]  
 
Skullcap is an herb belonging  to the herbal class of plants called “nervines”, or tonics for the central 
nervous system. Generally, nervines are known to promote feelings of calm and r elax the body and 
mind. Skullcap has an herbal history for the use of a number of tension -related conditions, including 
tension felt in the head. Its inclusion in Tension Relief promotes feelings of calm, while also 
promoting comfort. For example, in a cli nical study involving healthy volunteers (with a low amount 
of tension), Skullcap was found to significantly enhance global mood. [7 , 26, 27 ] 
 
Feverfew  is a well-known  herb used for head comfort. This plant which produces masses of cheery 
white daisies has  long been used for promoting head comfort and cytokine balance. Clinical studies 
have shown Feverfew to not only promote head comfort, but also reduce sensitivity to light and 
noise, and improve quality of life in some people. [3, 10 , 28, 29, 30 ]

The ingredients in th e test product have shown to have some theoretical drug 
interactions which have been listed in the appendix . (Appendix A)   
Potential side-effects have been observed in high doses which are significantly greater 
than the dose of the capsule as recommended in the instruction for use:  
• Diarrhea  
• Nausea  
• Stomach Cramps  
• Acid Reflux  
• Skin Rashes  
• GI Bleeding  
• Headaches  
• Liver Damage  
 
This study is determined by [CONTACT_733705] [INVESTIGATOR_79796] a Minimal Risk 
Study.  
Minimal risk is defined by 45 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 46.102 (i) as follows:  
12 
 “Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort 
anticipate d in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily 
encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological 
examinations or tests.”

contain additives, dyes, fillers and other unnatural or synthetic ingredients that 
consumers are  looking to avoid. As such, these consumers are  seeking natural, plant -
based alternatives for symptom relief. Research part icipants may benefit from the 
intervention by [CONTACT_869988]/or tension headache while achieving symptom relief.  If the intervention is 
shown to be efficacious, this would provide a viable p revention option for others in the 
general population to decrease their need for drugs that contain undesired ingredients. 
Other benefits include detailed surveillance of symptoms and documentation of 
activities, routine medications and supplements that may provide participants  and their 
regular physician or other healthcare provider with useful information for diagnosis and 
treatment of symptoms should they occur.  
 
2.2.[ADDRESS_1214422] questions answered before enrollment. Once an event occurs review of symptoms 
will be ascertained at 15 and 30 minutes  for up to an hour. Reporting of adverse events 
will be reviewed routinely and in accordance with regulatory guidelin es (21CFR, GCP) by 
[CONTACT_079]. Participants with occurrence of worsening symptoms or 
adverse events  should stop taking the test product and  may seek medical attention and 
exit the study.  
 
[ADDRESS_1214423] work time  [17, 18] . The purpose of the present 
study is to 1) evaluate the impact of the tension relief test product on the symptoms of 
tension headaches and functional status in adult men and women who suffer from mild to 
moderate tension headaches by [CONTACT_10540] 10 -point Mankoski scale [19] and 2) the 
[ADDRESS_1214424] s.  
This will be evaluated based on the primary and secondary endpoints. These endpoints, the 
analysis populations, and their respective measures are descri bed below. Further details on 
the methods for measuring the outcomes can be found in the Study Outcome Measures 
and Analysis Plan sections.  
 
 Primary Endpoint:  
The primary endpoint is reduction in tension headache severity. Patients will be asked to 
rate h eadache on the 10 -point Mankoski scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the product, 
[ADDRESS_1214425]. The improvement in symptoms from baseline will be evaluated on a 
pairwise basis separately for each time point. P -values will be computed for the 
improvement . 
 
 There is no control group for the primary analysis.  
 
 Secondary Endpoints:  
• The time to other intervention will be analyzed.  
• A longitudinal analysis will be performed for patients who report on more than one 
incident of headache.  
• Comparison against the participant’s normal behavior . 
• Net Promoter Score . 
● Adverse events will be summarized.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
in similar studies appearing in the literature. There will be no formal statistical 
comparison of results from this study and historical studies . 
 
[ADDRESS_1214426]. If needed the 
participant will be allowed to take alternative medication (alternative treatment) after an hour after 
taking the product. If alternative medication is taken, the participant will record this in their 
headac he diary.  
 
Study enrollment and management will be de -centralized, where participants do not visit an 
investigator or a clinic for clinical assessment. The participants will participate in the study at home.

study visits will be virtual, and the platform will be used to collect patient reported 
outcomes and to track screening, enrollment and study compliance.  
 
 
7 Statistical Considerations  
 
7.1 Study Outcomes Measures  
Analysis populations : 
The intent to treat  (ITT) population consists of all participants who are consented, report 
the onset of a headache, and have taken the study medication at least once. The primary 
analysis will be in the ITT population.  
 
 Primary Endpoint:  
 
The primary endpoint is reduction in headache severity. Patients will be asked to rate 
headache on the 10 -point Mankoski scale at 4 time points: prior to taking the product, [ADDRESS_1214440] . The improvement in symptoms from baseline will be evaluated on a 
pairwise basis separately for each time point. P -values will be computed for the 
improvement.  
 
 There is no control group for the primary analysis.  
 
 Secondary E ndpoints:  
 
● Time to intervention (taking any product other than the study medication) will be 
analyzed as a time dependent variable, with the clock starting when the test product is 
taken.  
● A longitudinal analysis will be performed for patients who report on more than  one 
incident of headache .  
● Net Promoter Score . 
● Comparison against normal behavior will use the paired sample t-test.  
● An additional data presentation will consist of results from both Treatment and Control 
[ADDRESS_1214441] deviation 
of 5 points . Based on these assumptions, a sample size of 68 patients woul d result in a 90% 
power to detect an improvement using the paired -sample t-test. We also assume that 50% 
of the patients will experience headaches during the 60 -day period; the other patients 
would furnish no useful data. The final sample size of [ADDRESS_1214442] an improvement would increase.   
 
It should be emphasized that these assumptions are for sample size purposes only. Trial 
analysis will use the data as collected.  
As discussed above, the number 200 may be increased based on observed data concerning 
the number of participants with heart burn/indigestion. The actual outcomes of treated 
participants will not be considered in this analysis, merely whether or not enrolled 
participants have reported starting using the test product. The method of reevaluating the 
sample size will be described i n the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
7.[ADDRESS_1214443] secondary analyses not described here.  
 
General statistic al methods : 
 
Data will be analyzed using standard statistical methods, as further specified in a statistical 
analysis plan (SAP), which will be prepared in detail later.  
 
• Data analysis will largely consist of summary statistics and graphs. The only formal group 
comparisons will be in covariate analyses.  
• For continuous variables data presentation will consist of means, confidence intervals 
computed using the t -statistic, me dians, and interquartile ranges. Group comparisons 
will use t -tests or ANOVA . 
• For discrete variables confidence intervals will use the exact intervals, where available. 
Group comparisons will use Fisher’s exact test, with the Monte Carlo version used 
where  computationally necessary.  
• For time to event variables analysis will use the Kaplan -Meier algorithm, and group 
comparisons will use the log -rank or proportional hazards methods, depending on the 
data type.   
• Visual analog scale values will be treated as continuous variables. Frequency counts will 
also be provided for scales with [ADDRESS_1214444] response levels.  
• Covariate analyses will investigate the relation between baseline and outcome variables, 
using methods appropriate to the data types involved . Age, gender, and baseline 
medications will be included in these analyses where appropriate data are available.  
• Present intention is that the analysis will be performed in R, and the precise form of 
algorithms will be the default of R. Kaplan -Meier, log -rank, and proportional hazards 
algorithms will be the defaults of the survival package. [13]  
• The exact items to be compared depend on what is reported in each historical control 
study. When possible, the items will include symptom relief at each time measur ed, 
including within -patient p -values, and time to the lowest level on a [ADDRESS_1214445], prior to study start.  
 
Study candidates will learn about the study via digital advertisements. If interested in 
learning more, they will be referred to a website “landing page” that will provide detailed 
information about the study. They may opt to complete a screening survey ascertaining 
study eligibility through patient reported outcomes. If successfully completed (no exclusion 
criteria are selected), candidate will be invited to review the study consent form tutorial 
which includes the opportunity to ask que stions related to the study from the Principal 
Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_733681]. Candidate will be prov ided with 
contact [CONTACT_869990].  
 
Candidate may sign the informed consent via elec tronic signature [CONTACT_869998] 
[CONTACT_869991]. The study manager will verify candidate signature [CONTACT_869999] 
a study participant . 
 
[ADDRESS_1214446] Confidentiality  
All participant s’ data and personal information will be kept confidential. Only those involved 
with the study will have access to participant information. The data will be stored by 
[CONTACT_733713] a HIPAA compliant platform. The platform, which the data is stored 
on, will require a personalized username [CONTACT_733725].  
 
[ADDRESS_1214447]. The study relies solely on 
patients' subjective information and self -reporting; there is no medical review of symptoms, 
and no independent check on patient compliance .  Some patient groups are not studied, 
including those under 18 years of age and pregnant women.

MAGNESIUM  
There are no Serious Drug Interactions known for Magnesium. There are some anecdotal 
moderate interactions with various drugs, including antibiotics, antacids, and others.  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Use of an aminoglycoside antibiotic and magnesium concurrently can lead to neuromuscular 
weakness and possible paralysis. Both agents reduce presynaptic acetylcholine release, which 
can lead to neuromuscular blockade. This is most likely to occur with high doses of magnesium 
given intravenously ( [ZIP_CODE] ). The aminoglycosides include amikacin (Amikin), gentamicin 
(Garamycin), kanamycin (Kantrex), streptomycin, and tobramycin (Nebcin).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ANTACIDS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Use of antacids may reduce the laxative effect of magnesium oxide. A retrospective analysis 
shows that use of H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) is associated 
with a higher dose of magnesi um oxide needed to attain a therapeutic laxative effect ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
This may be due to the fact that, under acidic conditio ns, magnesium oxide is converted to 
magnesium chloride then magnesium bicarbonate, which promotes the osmotic laxative effect. 
Antacids, which reduce the acidity of the stomach, may reduce the conversion of magnesium 
oxide to the active bicarbonate salt.  
 
Some antacids include calcium carbonate (Tums, others), dihydroxyaluminum sodium carbonate 
(Rolaids, others), magaldrate (Riopan), magnesium sulfate (Bilagog), aluminum hydroxide 
(Amphojel), and others.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
In vitro evidence suggests that magnesium sulfate inhibits platelet aggr egation at concentrations 
as low as 0.5 -1.0 mM ( [ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that infusion 
of magnesium sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
However, other clinical research seems to show that magnesium does not affect platelet 
aggregation, although inhibition of platelet -dependent thrombo sis (PDT) can occur ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
Theoretically, concomitant use of magnesium with anticoagulants or antiplatelets could incr ease 
the risk of bleeding.  
 
Some of these drugs include aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (Plavix), dalteparin (Fragmin), enoxaparin 
(Lovenox), heparin, indomethacin (Indocin), ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] (Ticlid), warfarin (Coumadin), and 
others.  
34 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  BISPHOSPHONATES  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Cations, including magnesium, can decrease bisphosphonate absorption. Ad vise patients to 
separate doses of magnesium and these drugs by [CONTACT_2669] 2 hours ( [ZIP_CODE] ). The bisphosphonates 
include alendronate (Fosamax), etidronate (Didronel), tiludronate (Skelid), and risedronate 
(Actonel).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Magn esium inhibits calcium entry into smooth muscle cells and may therefore have additive 
effects with calcium channel blockers. Severe hypotension and neuromuscular blockades may 
occur when nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_869977] ( 3046 ,[ZIP_CODE],[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ), although 
some contradictory evidence suggests that concurrent use of magnesium plus nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_869978] ( [ZIP_CODE] ). High doses of magnesium could 
theoretically have additive effects with other calcium channel blockers. These drugs include 
nifedipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Adalat, Procardia), nicardipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Cardene), isradipi [INVESTIGATOR_050] (DynaCirc), amlodipi[INVESTIGATOR_050] 
(Norvasc), and others.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  DIGOXIN  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical evidence suggests that treatment with oral magnesium hydroxide or magnesium 
trisilicate reduces absorption of d igoxin from the intestines ( 198,[ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). This may reduce 
the blood levels of digoxin and decrease its t herapeutic effects.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  GABAPENTIN (Neurontin)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Unlikely  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research shows that giving magnesium oxide orally along with gabapentin decreases 
gabapentin maximum concentration by 33%, time to maximum concentr ation by 36%, and area 
under the curve by 43% ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Advise patients to take these gabapentin at least 2 hours before,  
or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements.  
35 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  POTASSIUM -SPARING DIURETICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Potassium -sparing diuretics also have magnesium -sparing properties, which can counteract the 
magnesium losses associated with loop and thiazide diuretics ( 9613 ,9614 ,9622 ). Theoretically, 
increased magnesium levels could result from concomitant use of potassium -sparing diuretics 
and magnesium supplements. The potassium -sparing diuretics include amiloride (Midamor), 
triamterene (Dyrenium), and spi[INVESTIGATOR_869979] (Aldactone).  
[IP_ADDRESS]  QUINOLONE ANTIBIOTICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with quinolones and decrease their absorption ( 3046 ). 
Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium 
supplements. Quinolones (fluoroquinolo nes) include ciprofloxacin (Cipro), gemifloxacin 
(Factive), levofloxacin (Levaquin), moxifloxacin (Avelox), and others.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SEVELAMER (Renagel, Renvela)  
Interaction Rating  = Minor  Be watchful with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research shows that taking sevelamer may increase serum magnesium l evels. In patients 
on hemodialysis, sevelamer use was associated with a 0.28 mg/dL increase in serum magnesium. 
The mechanism of this interaction remains unclear ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Advise patients to talk to their 
healthcare provider before taking magnesium supplements if they are taking sevelamer.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  SKELETAL MUSCLE RELAXANTS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = A  
Parenteral magnesium shortens the time to onset of skeletal muscle relaxants by [CONTACT_2902] 1 minute 
and prolongs the duration of action by [CONTACT_2902] 2 minutes. This is thought to occur because 
magnesium potentiates the effects of skeletal muscle relaxants by [CONTACT_869992] ( 3046 ,[ZIP_CODE] ). A clinical study found that low -dose 
rocuronium (0.45 mg/kg), when given after administration of magnesium 30 mg /kg over [ADDRESS_1214455] seen with a 
full-dose rocuronium regimen (0.6 mg/kg) ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Along with rocuronium (Zemuron), skeletal 
muscle relaxants include atracurium (Tracrium), cisatracurium (Nimbex), mivacurium 
(Mivacron), rapacuronium (Raplon), pancuronium (Pavulon), vecuronium (Norcuron), and 
others.  
36 
 [IP_ADDRESS]  SULFONYLUREAS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Mild  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = B  
Clinical research suggests that concomitant administration of magnesium hydr oxide and non -
micronized glibenclamide increases the absorption of glibenclamide, leading to a 35 -fold 
increase in maximum insulin response compared to treatment with non -micronized 
glibenclamide alone ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Similarly, concomitant administration of magnesium hydroxide 
and glipi[INVESTIGATOR_869980] 
35% com pared to glipi[INVESTIGATOR_869981] ( [ZIP_CODE] ). This effect relates to the ability of magnesium -based 
antacids to elevate gastrointest inal pH, leading to increased solubility and enhanced absorption 
of sulfonylureas ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Due to this interaction, conc omitant use of sulfonylureas and 
magnesium -based antacids may theoretically increase the risk of hypoglycemia in some patients. 
Other sulfonylurea agents include carbutamide, acetohexamide, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, 
gliclazide, glibornuride, glyclopyram ide, and glimepi[INVESTIGATOR_14956].  
[IP_ADDRESS]  TETRACYCLINE ANTIBIOTICS  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Magnesium can form insoluble complexes with tetracyclines in the gut and decrease their 
absorption and antibacterial activity ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Advise patients to take these drugs at least 2 hours 
before, or 4 to 6 hours after, magnesium supplements. Tetracyclines include demeclocycline 
(Declomycin), doxycycline (Vibramycin), minocycline (Minocin), and tetracycline

ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS : In vitro evidence 
suggests that magnesi um sulfate inhibits platelet aggregation at concentrations as low as 0.5 -1.0 
mM ( [ZIP_CODE] ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Some preliminary clinical evidence suggests that infusion of magnesium 
sulfate increases bleeding time by 48% and reduces platelet activity ( [ZIP_CODE] ). However, other 
clinical research seems to show that magnesium does not affect platelet aggregation, although 
inhibit ion of platelet -dependent thrombosis (PDT) can occur ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, concomitant 
use of magnesium with other her bs and supplements that affect platelet aggregation might 
increase the risk of bleeding. Some other herbs and supplements that affect platelet aggregation 
include angelica, clove, danshen, garlic, ginger, glucosamine, Panax ginseng, and others.  
 
BORON : Bor on supplements can reduce urinary excretion of magnesium and increase serum 
levels in women ( 940,9529 ,9623 ). In young women, age [ADDRESS_1214456] appears to be 
greater in sedentary than athletic women ( 940). In postmenopausal women, the effect is more 
marked in women with low dietary magnesium intake ( 9623 ). The clinical significance of these 
effects, and whether they occur in men, is not known.  
 
CALCIUM : Calcium supplements can decrease the absorption of dietary magnesium, but only 
at very high, supra -therapeutic doses (2600 mg daily). However, in people with adequate 
magnesium stores, calcium do esn't have any clinically significant effect on long -term 
37 
 magnesium balance. Advise patients at high risk for magnesium deficiency to take calcium 
supplements at bedtime, instead of with meals, to avoid inhibiting dietary magnesium absorption 
(4623 ,7555 ,[ZIP_CODE] ). Magnesium does not seem to affect calcium absorption ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
 
VITAMIN D : One intestinal route of magnesium absorption is thought to be vitamin D 
dependent ( 9634 ). Various forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol, 25 -
hydroxyergocalciferol, 25 -hydroxycholecalciferol (calcifediol), and 1,25 -
dihydroxycholecalciferol (calcitriol) increase mag nesium absorption; especially when taken in 
high doses ( 9634 ,9635 ,9636 ,9637 ). This effect has been used to treat hypomagnesemia in people 
with malabsorption syndromes ( 9516 ,9635 ,9636 ). 
 
ZINC : Supplementation with high doses of zinc, 142 mg daily, appears to decrease magnesium 
absorp tion and magnesium balance in healthy adult males ( 9624 ). Also, moderately high dietary 
zinc intake, [ADDRESS_1214457] bone health. Zinc may 
compete with magnesium for ion exchange transport in the intestine ( [ZIP_CODE] ). More research on 
the clinical importance of these observations is needed.  
 
 
 
WHITE WILLOW BARK  
There is one Serious Drug Interactions known for White Willow Bark, of which it is anecdotal. 
Just like aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], White Willow Bark might increase the risk of bleeding, and so the concomitant 
use of anticoagulants and antiplatelet drugs should be avoided.   
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  ACETAZOLAMIDE  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Possible  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Willow bark contains salicin, a plant salicylate. Human case reports suggest a combination of 
acetazolamide and salicylate increase unbound plasma levels of acetazolamide, as well as 
adverse effects related to acetazolami de ([ZIP_CODE] ). Theoretically, willow bark might result in 
additive adverse effects associated with acetazolamide.  
[IP_ADDRESS]  ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET DRUGS  
Interaction Rating  = Major  Do not take this combination.   
Severity  = High  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Concomitant use theoretically might increase the risk of bleeding due to decreased platelet 
aggregation. Willow bark has anti platelet effects, but less so than aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Avoid 
concomitant use with other anticoagulant and antiplatelet drug s. Some of these drugs include 
aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248], clopi[INVESTIGATOR_7745] (Plavix), dalteparin (Fragmin), enoxaparin (Lovenox), heparin, ticlopi[INVESTIGATOR_5325] 
(Ticlid), warfarin (Coumadin), and others.

additive effect with other s alicylate -containing drugs such as aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  CHOLINE MAGNESIUM TRISALICYLATE (Trilisate)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Willow bark contains salicin , a plant salicylate. Theoretically, willow bark might have an 
additive effect with other salicylate -containing drugs such as choline magnesium trisalicylate 
([ZIP_CODE] ). 
[IP_ADDRESS]  SALSALATE (Disalcid)  
Interaction Rating  = Moderate  Be cautious with this combination.   
Severity  = Moderate  •  Occurrence  = Probable  •  Level of Evidence  = D  
Willow bark contains salicin , a plant salicylate. Theoretically, willow bark might have an 
additive effect with other salicylate -containing drugs such as salsalate ( [ZIP_CODE] ). 
 
Interactions with Herbs & Supplements  
ANTICOAGULANT/ANTIPLATELET HERBS AND SUPPLEMENTS : Concomitant use 
of herbs that have antiplatelet/anticoagulant effects could theoretically increase the risk of 
bleeding in some people ( [ZIP_CODE] ). These herbs include clove, danshen, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, 
ginseng, meadowsweet, red clover, and others.  
 
SALICYL ATE -CONTAINING HERBS : Theoretically, concomitant use may potentiate 
salicylate effects and adverse effects ( [ZIP_CODE] ). Sali cylate -containing herbs include aspen bark, 
black haw, poplar, and meadowsweet.  
 
 
FEVERFEW

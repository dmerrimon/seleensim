You are being asked to participate in this research study because you are at least [ADDRESS_350936] of care upper endoscopy (EGD) at the endoscopy unit at 
University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_287815]. The purpose of this research study to 
develop a new screening and surveillance method for Barrett’s esophagus (BE). BE is a condition 
where the lining of the esophagus (the swallowing tube) changes and may lead to cancer. The 
screening method will test a device that is a capsule balloon that will brush against the walls of the 
esophagus to collect a sample. A capsule balloon is a capsule tethered to a thin tube, with a balloon 
inside the capsule. Unlike standard of care methods, this screening method is inexpensive and does 
not require sedation.  
 
The device being studied, an inflatable balloon brush, is considered investigational, which means 
that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved it for use.  
 
About 120 pe
ople will take part in this research study at the endoscopy suites of the University 
Hospit
als Case Medical Center (UHCMC), Ahuja Medical Center (AMC) and the Cleveland Clinic 
F
oundation (CCF). 
 
Study
 Procedures 
Your participation in this study will last for one visit and will add 30-[ADDRESS_350937] before your sedated upper 
e
ndoscopy (EGD); the capsule balloon test is a new method that examines the esophagus without 
using
 sedative medications.  
The capsule balloon test will be performed by a qualified physician. While you are awake, the back 
of your throat may or may not be sprayed with a numbing agent. This should take about 5-10 min.  
You will then be asked to swallow the balloon, which will be deflated (no air in the balloon).  After 
the balloon is swallowed, it will then be inflated (filled with air) fully with 15 cc of air. 
The balloon will be withdrawn until a tug is felt at the gastroesophageal junction (base of the 
chest) (GEJ). Once the GEJ is located, 10 cc of air will be removed and the 5 cc balloon will be

Version Date : 10February 2016 Page 2 of 8 pulled back 5 cm to sample the bottom of the esophagus. The balloon will then be completely 
deflated and then withdrawn (taken out) of your throat.  
 
After you have the capsule balloon test, you will also be asked to complete a questionnaire. It will 
ask questions about your heartburn symptoms and inquire about how well you tolerated the 
procedure, and whether you would be willing to repeat the procedure. The questionnaire should 
take about five minutes to complete. If you do not wish to answer a question, you may skip it and 
go to the next question. 
Upon finishing the questionnaire, you will have your endoscopy performed. After you have your 
endoscopy, the researchers will review your endoscopy records, the biopsy report if a biopsy was 
done, a
nd your medical records to determine if you do or do not have Barrett’s esophagus. They 
will then compare the results of the new capsule balloon test with your standard endoscopy test to 
determine how well the new method is able to detect Barrett’s esophagus.  
 
Consequences of Withdrawing or being Discontinued from the Research  
If the procedure becomes too uncomfortable, you may ask the procedure be stopped and withdraw 
from the research study. 
 
If an investigator chooses to withdraw you from participation in the research protocol to protect your 
overall wellbeing in the event that you are no longer fulfilling the basic study requirements/follow-up, 
study information collected prior to your removal will be retained.  
 
Risks 
Your participation in this study may involve the following risks. The Principal Investigator [INVESTIGATOR_287816].  We cannot predict all risks or potential side effects in all subjects.  It is 
important that you tell the researchers about any injuries, side effects, or other problems that you 
experience during this study. 
 
There may be mild discomfort while swallowing the capsule. Passage of the capsule through the 
throat and the attached tubing may stimulate gagging in some patients. You may experience a 
transient chest pressure or pain sensation when the balloon is inflated and pulled into the 
esophagus.

A
lternatives to Study Participation 
Because of the nature of this research, the only alternative is to not participate in this study. In this 
case, the patients will still receive standard of care treatment outside of the research study.  Their 
data will not be collected for this research study. 
 
Financial Information 
There is no cost to you or to your insurance company for participation in the research component 
of this protocol.   
 
You will be paid a total of $50.[ADDRESS_350939] agree to complete a W-9 form which

research study. If you are injured by a medical treatment or procedure that you would have received 
even if you weren’t in the study, that is not considered a “research injury”. There are no plans for 
payment of medical expenses or other payments, including lost wages, for any research related injury. 
To help avoid injury, it is very important to follow all study directions. Medical treatment is available 
from University Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_161501]/or Cleveland Clinic or another medical facility, but you/your medical 
insurance will be responsible for the cost of this treatment.

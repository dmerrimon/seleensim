Use of Low Cost  Prostheses to Improve Upper Extremity Function  
in Children with Cerebral Palsy  
 
PURPOSE OF STUDY AND BACKGROUND  
Purpose of the Study : To assess the effectiveness of upper extremity prosthesis in improving the upper 
extremity function of children with cerebral palsy who have limited use of their hands  
 
Background  
Cerebral  palsy  is the most  common  childhood  disability,  affecting  approximately  two to three  out of every  
one thousand  live births  in the United  States,  and the most  common  form  is spastic  (77%)  (CDC) . Up to 
83% of children  with cerebral  palsy  have  upper  extremity  involvement,  which  limits  their ability  to live and 
work  independently.[ADDRESS_1117582]  supportive  data was found  for 
therapeutic  techniques,  in particular,  constraint -induced  movement  therapy  (CIMT)  and bimanual  
training.2,[ADDRESS_1117583]  treatments  are effective  only in patients  with 
relatively  advanced  ability.   
 
The Manual  Ability  Classification  System  (MACS)  is a simple  way to describe  how children  with cerebral  
palsy  use their hands  during  routine  activities  at school  and home.5 Level  I indicates  a child  who has full 
use, while  level  V would  be one without  any use. The intervening  levels  describe  increasingly  severe  
limitations;  level  II pertains  to a child  who can handle  most  objects,  level  III to someone  who handles  items  
with difficulty,  and level  IV to a patient  who can only use their hands  in adapted  situations.  Many  of the 
intensive  and structured  therapeutic  regimens  were  developed  for children  at higher  functioning  MACS  
levels.[ADDRESS_1117584]  on their quality  of life and 
ability  for self-care.7,8 Children  with MACS  IV or V comprise  15-30% of the pediatric  cerebral  palsy  
population  and are more  globally  involved.[ADDRESS_1117585]  or elbow . This 
active  motion  in proximal  joints  can be used to motor  distal  motion  by [CONTACT_15276] a prosthesi s which  is 
                                                                                                  Version:  2/27/[ADDRESS_1117586]  accurate.   
 
Study  Design : Prospective  one group  pretest -posttest  design   
Primary  outcome  measures:  passive  and active  range  of motion,  MACS,  Assisting  Hand  Assessment , 
Melbourne  Assessment  of Unilateral  Upper  Limb  Function , Pediatric  Motor  Activity  Log 
Secondary  outcome  measure:  Pediatric  Quality  of Life Inventory

METHODS  AND  PROCED URES  
Methods  and Procedures  
Participant s will be 12 children,  aged  4-17 years,  with cerebral  palsy  and MACS  level  III - V 
 
All patients, with CP and upper extremity involvement, who are being seen during a regular ly 
scheduled  clinic/office/occupational therapy visit by [CONTACT_978], co -investigator or occupational 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], and are potentially eligible for enrollment in the study will be provided information about 
the study.   The PI, co -investigator, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808521]’s parents. The parents will be asked if they are interested in having 
their child voluntarily participate in the study. The Consent form (please see Process of Consent section 
below for fu rther details) will be presented to the parent/legal guardian and the age appropriate Assent form 
will be presented to the child. If parent/legal guardian and child agree to participate, then they will be asked 
to sign the Consent and Assent forms.  
                                                                                                  Version:  2/27/[ADDRESS_1117587]  or research coordinator  will be obtaining consent/assent (please see Process of Conse nt sec tion 
below for further details) when the patient comes for Visit 1.  
 
All visits  for this study  are for research  purposes.  The patient  will be scheduled  for Visit  1, Screening  Visit.  
At Visit  1, a pediatric  occupational  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808522]  a comprehensive  initial  evaluation  to determine  
functional  level, range  of passive  and active  upper  extremity  motion,  presence  of contractures,  and level  of 
spasticity/abnormal  tone. The evaluation  will include  the following  widely  used measures  of upper  
extremity  function  in patients  with cerebral  palsy:  MACS,  the Assisting  Hand  Assessment  (AHA),  
Melbourne  Assessment  of Unila teral Upper  Limb  Function,  and Pediatric  Motor  Activity  Log (PMAL).  
From this information  the occupational  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808523]’s  eligibility  for enrollment,  i.e., if 
the patient  meets  inclusion  and exclusion  criteria.  Additionally,  for the patients  that are enrolled  in the 
study,  this will serve  as their initial  evaluation.  
 
Those patients determined to be eligible and signed  consent/assent/authorization forms   will be fitted with 
a three -dimensionally printed arm prosthesis , which uses wrist or elbow  tenodesis for  grasp and 
release. Three -dimensional printers can manufacture prosthes es, which use  proximal motion to 
activate opening  and closing of the fingers.  
 
Patients  with MACS  III have  limited  active  finger  and wrist  motion.  Many  patients  with MACS  level  IV 
have  a small  amount  of active  wrist  motion  and minimal  finger  motion.  These  two groups  of patients  can 
have  prostheses  with extension  caps on the fingers  and thumb  driven  by [CONTACT_808541].  The palmar  
fingertips  would  then be utilized  for sensory  input  and additional  fine control.  In contrast,  those  patients  
(some  MACS  IV and some  MACS  V) with unusable,  contracted  fingers  and no wrist  motion  may need  
more  involved  prostheses.  Similar  to prostheses  for children  with congenital  finger  amputations,  a 
prosthetic  hand  component  would  be fitted  over the existing  hand,  and extension  and flexion  of the 
prosthetic  fingers  (not just caps)  would  be driven  by [CONTACT_808542].    
 
The fabrication  of the prosthesis  will involve  several  steps.  First the measurements  by [CONTACT_808543][INVESTIGATOR_808524]:  (1) circumferential  measurements  of all fingers,  thumb,  web space,  wrist  and 
forearm,  and (2) length  measurements  from  (a) elbow  to wrist,  (b) wrist  to each metacarpal  joint,  (c) each 
metacarpal  joint to proximal  interphalangeal  joint,  (d) each proximal  interphalangeal  joint to distal  
interphalangeal  joint,  (e) each distal  interphalangeal  joint to finger  tip, (f) metacarpal  to interphalangeal  
joint of thumb,  and (g) interphalangeal  joint to tip of thumb.  These  measurements  will be inputted  to the 
software  in the computer  connected  to the 3D printer.  This software  drives  the printer  to produce  the 
following  prosthetic  components  for the subjects  who will be using  their own fingers:  (1) 3 dorsal  caps per 
finger,  which  fit between  the joints  and the distal  joint and tip, (2) 2 dorsal  caps for the thumb,  which  fit 
between  the joints  and the joint and tip, (3) dorsal  hand  hood,  which  fits between  wrist  and metacarpals,  
and (4) dorsal  forearm  hood.  For the subjects  for whom a prosthetic  hand  is being  fabricated,  the same  
measurements  will be used to make  the prosthetic  components  with the same  components  being  made  for 
the dorsum  of the forearm  and hand,  but complete  replicas  of the fingers  and thumb  will be made.  For both 
designs,  all of these  components  are interconnected  with nylon  cord and tensioning  fasteners.  The fasteners  
are used to adjust  the tension  to provide  the movement  at the joints  of the prosthesis  that is generated  by 
[CONTACT_808544]’s  own active  elbow  flexion,  or wrist  flexion  or extension.  All of the components  will be 
made  from  a cornstarch -based  material called  polylactic  acid.   According  to FDA  regulations,  external  
prosthetic  components  are exempt.  As SOC,  children  have previously  received  similar  splints  of both 
designs,  but fabricated  manually  by [CONTACT_808545][INVESTIGATOR_541].  
 
After  the prosthesis  has been fabricated,  the occupational  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808525]’s  arm and 
hand.  The therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808526].  Therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808527].  Additionally,  the therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808528]:  2/27/[ADDRESS_1117588]  the tension  of the cords  as 
needed.  
 
Visit  Schedule  
Visit  1, Screening  Visit : Previously  described  initial  evaluation.  
Visit s 2: The occupational  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808529]/or  3D scan of 
the subject’s  arm and hand.  These  measurements /scan  will be sent via encrypted  email  to the Maker  Space , 
NYU  Tandon  School  of Engineering,  where  the prosthesis  will be fabricated  using  a 3D printer.  As a 
secondary  outcome  measure,  all subjects  and their parents  will be asked  to complete  the Pediatric  Quality  
of Life Inventory  (PedsQL) . 
Visits  3-4: The prosthesis  will have  been shipp ed or delivered  to the occupatio nal therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808530].  
Visits  5-12: Occupational  therapy  treatment  1x week  for 8 weeks.  Each  occupational  therapy  treatment  will 
be a one-hour standardized  session  that will include the following:  stretching/strengthening  (approximately  
20 minutes),  bimanual  training  (approximately  20 minutes),  and activities  of daily  living  (approximately  20 
minutes).  
Visit  13 (one week  after 8th occupational  therapy  treatment) : Re-evaluation  including  measurement  of 
upper  extremity  range  of passive  and active  motion,  level  of spasticity/abnormal  tone,  MACS,  AHA , 
Melbourne  Assessment  of Unila teral Upper  Limb  Function , PMAL,  and PedsQL.  These  will be performed  
both with the prosthe sis on and with it off. 
Visit  14 (6 months  after initiation  of occupational  therapy  treatment):  Re-evaluation  including  same  
assessments  as Visit  13. These  will be performed  both with the prosthesis  on and off. 
 
Additionally, subjects will be asked to keep  a log of daily activities including how long prosthesis is worn . 
 
Data Analysis and Data Monitoring  
Demographics will be reported.  Passive and active rang e of motion measurements and the MACS, AHA, 
Melbourne Assessment,  PMAL  and the PedsQL  scores  at initial evaluation , end of occupational therapy 
treatment and [ADDRESS_1117589] 
protected to prevent unauthorized access.  Data will be stored in either the locked office of the PI [INVESTIGATOR_808531].  
 
RISK/BENEFIT  ASSESSMENT  
Risk   
This study  is low risk because  it involves  the fabrication  and use of upper  extremity  splinting,  which  are 
commonly  an integral  part of typi[INVESTIGATOR_808532].  The 
primary  difference  will be in the fabrication  technique,  3D printing,  being  utilized.  For the evaluations,  
measurements,  scans  and treatment  by [CONTACT_808546][INVESTIGATOR_11437],  the only potential  for any discomfort  
would  be mild discomfort  during  the stretching  portion  of the treatment  session.  For the prosthesis,   
one risk is minor skin irritation  or discomfort  from  it.  
 
Prote ction  Against  Risks  
The parents  and children  will be instructed  to monitor  the upper  extremity  for redness  or discomfort  and 
report  any problems  to the occupational  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541].  
All necessary precautions will be taken to maintain confidentiality of data and prevent unauthorized access 
to data.  The data will be entered into a REDCap database. Only personnel associated with this study will 
have access to the data. The data will be stored and accessible only on password -protected computers.  
 
Potential  Benefits  to Subjects  
The use of the prosthesi s may improve  the subject’s  upper  extremity  function.

occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541]. For these subjects, the occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808536] b e 
obtaining consent/assent (please see Process of Consent section below for further details) when the patient 
comes for Visit [ADDRESS_1117592] 
will determine who is an appropriate candidate for inclusion in the study.  
 
Process of Consent  
At a regular clinic/office/ occupational therapy visit, p otential participants and their parents/legal guardians 
will be approached by [CONTACT_32816], co -investigator , or occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_808537] . For non -English speaking participants, the institution’s translation services, a health -care specific 
telephonic interpreting system, will be used  to present the study information verbally and the Short Consent 
Form in the parent’s native language will be used to obtain signed consent.  
 
If the parent/legal guardian and child are interested, the Consent Form and age appropriate Assent Form 
will be presente d by [CONTACT_978], co -investigator, occupational therapi[INVESTIGATOR_541], or research coordinator . For those 
patients recruited from the databases of the PI , co-investigator  or occupational therapis t, the 
Consent/Assent forms will be presented by [CONTACT_98994][INVESTIGATOR_808538]. The 
parent/legal guardian and patient  will be given the opportunity to read the forms  and ask and have 
thoroughly answered any questions that they may have. Only after the parent/legal guardian and child 
assure the presenter that the y fully understand the project and voluntarily agree for the child to participate, 
will their signatures be obtained. Parents will be given copi[INVESTIGATOR_808539]. 
Signed Consent and Assent Forms will be stored in subjects’ files/bin ders in a locked office.

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
[ADDRESS_354972] actual dose of study drug) in each treatment arm and overall.  The primary 
endpoint will be analyzed based on intention to treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution, unless the number of virologic failures is less than 5, then the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
The secondary efficacy variables are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure in each treatment arm and 
overall;
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse in each treatment arm and overall.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson score method.  Analyses of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy s ubgroup analyses will be performed.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, the variants at signature [CONTACT_41634]-
associated amino acid positions at baseline identified by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
variants in available post-baseline samples identified by [CONTACT_187812], 
2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated positions identified by [CONTACT_187813], and 3) the persistence of viral variants by [CONTACT_077].
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of ABT-493, ABT-530, SOF, primary metabolite of SOF (GS-331007), and RBV 
will be tabulated for each subject and treatment arm.  Summary statistics will be computed for each 
treatment arm.
Safety:
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drugs will be included in the safety analyses.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_166884].  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be 
provided by [CONTACT_187799].  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by [CONTACT_166884].

3.0 Introduction
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is  a global health problem, with over 
170 million indi viduals infected worldwide.1  There are six major HCV genotypes (GT), 
GT1 to GT6, and each genotype expresses a distinct epi[INVESTIGATOR_291096].  Patients with chronic HCV infection are at high risk of developi[INVESTIGATOR_291097], death related to the complications of cirrhosis, and developi[INVESTIGATOR_4940].
2  
Successful treatment of HCV was shown to significantly reduce the risk of disease progression and related mortality as well as the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.
3,4
Currently approved IFN-free and, in some cases, RBV-free DAA combination regimens, such as sofosbuvir (SOF)/ledipasvir (LDV), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir with (3D) or without (2D) dasabuvir, SOF and daclatasvir (DCV), and elbasvir/grazoprevir represent substantial progress in the treatment of HCV infection.  These regimens are associated with significant improvement of the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate and safety profile in the approved patient populations.  However, these IFN-free regimens are not equally potent across all HCV genotypes and subtypes, and across all subpopulations.  They may require co-administration with RBV in some sub-populations.
The next generation DAA regimens have high potencies across all HCV genotypes and 
across patient subpopulations, including Abbvie's ABT-493/ABT-530 or glecaprevir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761] (GLE/PIB).  GLE/PIB is approved in some parts of the world, including Europe and the [LOCATION_002], under the brand name [CONTACT_291183]
®or 
MAVYRET™, respectively.
ABT-493 (NS3/4A protease inhibitor [PI]) and ABT-530 (NS5A inhibitor [NS5Ai]) are 
denoted as next generation compounds because they each demonstrated potent pan-genotypic antiviral activity against all major HCV genotypes, i.e., GT1 through GT6 and 
they are potent against known common single resistance-associated amino acid variants with no or little loss of potency.

The pharmacokinetics of ABT-493 has been evaluated at doses up to 1200 mg QD.  
ABT-493 reached T maxaround 3 to 4 hours with an elimination half-life of 6 to 9 hours.  
ABT-493 exposures increased in a greater than dose proportional manner across the 25 mg to 1200 mg dose range.  Orally administered ABT-493 was predominantly cleared 
through the biliary-fecal route.  The percentages of the ABT-493 dose recovered in urine were less than 4%.  No metabolite was identified in systemic circulation.
In summary, ABT-493 is a potent, pangenotypic PI [INVESTIGATOR_291099].  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, 
and pharmacology and Phase I data can be found in the Investigator's Brochure.

The pharmacokinetics of ABT-530 has been evaluated at doses up to 600 mg QD.  
ABT-530 reached a T maxaround 3 to 5 hours, with an elimination half-life of 12 to 
17 hours.  ABT-530 exposures increased in a greater than dose-proportional manner across the 1.5 mg to 120 mg dose range and approximately dose proportionally from the 120 mg to 600 mg single doses.  ABT-530 undergoes minimum renal elimination.  Orally administered ABT-530 was predominantly cleared through the biliary-fecal route as unchanged parent drug.
In summary, ABT-530 is a potent, pangenotypic NS5Ai with high potential for treatment 
of chronic HCV infection.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, 
metabolism, and pharmacology and Phase 1 data can be found in the Investigator's
Brochure.

ABT-493 and ABT-530
When ABT-493 was given in combination with ABT-530 in healthy volunteers, preliminary results showed ABT-493 exposures were not significantly changed when co-administered with ABT-530 ( ≤ 31% difference); however, the exposure of ABT-530 
increased in an ABT-493-dose-dependent manner (from 1.5-fold at 100 mg ABT-493 up to 3- to 4-fold at 400 mg ABT-493).
Results of clinical DDI studies conducted to date have shown that as perpetrators of DDIs, 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355001] on drugs that are substrates of CYP or UGT enzymes.  The ABT-493/ABT-530 combin ation increased 
exposure of substrates for P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 transporters.  
Except for some OATP inhibitors (e.g., high dose cyclosporine), ritonavir-boosted 
protease inhibitors and P-gp inducers, ABT-493 and ABT-530 exposures were minimally affected by [CONTACT_3252]-administrations of other drugs.  ABT-493 is a substrate of OATP and inhibition of OATP increases ABT-493 exposure.  When ABT-493 + ABT-530 was administered with cyclosporine (400 mg), an OATP inhibitor, ABT-493 exposure was up to 5.1-fold of DAAs alone.  The increased exposures observed were not associated with 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355002] potential to 
inhibit OATP, thus larger exposure increases in ABT-493 with ritonavir boosted proteaseinhibitors than with ritonavir alone may result from interaction of ABT-493 with both the protease inhibitor and ritonavir components.
ABT-493/ABT-530 possesses greater antiviral activity as compared to the 
ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir regimen, while also maintaining adequate activity against va riants that confer resistance to ombitasvir and paritaprevir.

ARV Drug-Drug Interaction Studies with ABT-493 and ABT-530
Phase 1 DDI studies of the ABT-493 + ABT-530 combination with HIV antiretroviral

exposures ( ≤80%) of evaluated ARV regimens: ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors 
(darunavir, lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]), rilpi[INVESTIGATOR_12979], raltegravir, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF).  ABT-493 and ABT-530 exposures were not affected by [CONTACT_124839][INVESTIGATOR_291101].  
Dolutegravir, lamivudine and abacavir (Triumeq
®) coadministered with ABT-493 + 
ABT-[ADDRESS_355007] on dolutegravir, lamivudine and abacavir exposures.  There was a mild decrease in ABT-493 and ABT-530 exposures of no clinical significance.

Efavirenz induces P-gp and exposures of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in the presence of 
efavirenz were approximately 3- and 2-fold lower, respectively, and thus will not be 
allowed in this study.
When ABT-493 was administered with ritonavir, exposure of ABT-493 was 2-fold of 
ABT-493 exposure alone.  Coadministration of ABT-493 + ABT-530 with ritonavir boosted protease inhibitors, darunavir QD or lopi[INVESTIGATOR_291102]-493 exposure of 3- to < 5-fold and < 2 fo ld exposure to ABT-530 without change in 
the LPV or DRV exposures.  In spi[INVESTIGATOR_291103]-493 exposures while coadministered with DRV/r or LPV/r, it was well tolerated, with mild side effects.  Coadministration of ABT-493 + ABT-530 with ritonavir boos ted atazanavir was studied 
in a DDI study that was terminated early due to an increase in ABT-493 exposure up to 
16-fold and ABT-530 exposure up to 3-fold with Grade 1 and 2 increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Grade 2 to 3 increase in total b ilirubin (predominately 
indirect).  
Study M15-584 evaluated the drug interaction profile when ABT-493/ABT-530 
300 mg/120 mg is co-administered with Genvoya
®(elvitegravir 150 mg, cobicistat 
150 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg, tenofovir alafenamide10 mg QD).  Co-administration was 
safe and well tolerated, with mild side effects reported and one grade [ADDRESS_355009] with baseline low absolute neutrophil count (ANC), leading to premature study drug discontinuation.  The ABT-493 exposure  increased 3-fold and the ABT-530 
exposure increased 57%, with non-clinically significant increase in elvitegravir and cobicistat exposures.  Thus, cobicistat boosted elvitegravir will be allowed in this study.  
In addition, ritonavi r and cobicistat-boosted HIV-1 protease inhibitors (darunavir and 
lopi[INVESTIGATOR_054]) will be allowed in the non-cirrhotic  arm only.  These HIV-1 protease inhibitors 
will not be allowed in cirrhotic subjects, as the ABT-493 predicted exposures in this 
population approach the ALT 5% Grade 2 threshold.

Clinical Study Results
Studies M14-867 and M14-868 (data on file)13are Phase 2 studies designed to assess the 
efficacy and safety of the combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic subjects with HCV GT1 – [ADDRESS_355011] been achieved for the combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 at the dose strength consistent with the Phase 3 doses, i.e., ABT-493 300 mg and ABT-530 120 mg ( Table 6 ).  In Studies M14-867 and M14-868, all subjects 
(N = 147) with HCV GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5 and GT6 infection have achieved SVR
12, 
following 8 or 12 weeks of treatment and a high SVR 12rate of 96% has been achieved for 
GT3 infected subjects (107/111).
Study M15-410 is a Phase 2 study designed to  assess the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in subjects who failed a prior DAA-containing 
therapy.  Prior DAA treatment regimens among enrolled include SOF/LDV (n = 8), SMV 
+ SOF ± RBV (n = 8), 3D ± RBV (n = 4), DSV + FDV + RDV ± RBV (n = 4), SAM + SMV (n = 2), TVR + PR (n = 8), BOC + PR (n = 10), DCV ± PR (n = 2).  The most common NS3 RAVs at baseline include Q80 (n = 22), R155 (n = 4), and D168 (n = 4), and the most common NS5A RAVs at baseline include Q30 (n = 14) and Y93 (n = 10).  Six out of [ADDRESS_355012] achieved SVR
12.  Twenty one out of 22 subjects (95%) who were treated with the ABT-[ADDRESS_355013] achieved SVR 12.  A summary of the

A study to assess the PK and safety of co-administration of 400 mg QD SOF in combination with ABT-493 400 mg QD and ABT-530 120 mg QD in healthy subjects (Study M14-532) showed minimal effect ( ≤ 16% change in central values) on the steady-
state exposures of ABT-493 and ABT-530 compared to the administration of ABT-493/ABT-530 combination alone.  SOF C
maxand AUC 0-24central values were 
increased by 66% and 125%, respectively, compared to SOF alone, however, GS-331007 C

without HIV-1 co-infection, who experienced virologic failure following treatment with ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355021] experienced virologic failure following treatment with 3D or 2D in an [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study may be enrolled at [COMPANY_013]'s discretion.
3.[ADDRESS_355022] experienced virolo gic failure following treatment with 
ABT-493/ABT-530, as well as treatment with 3D or 2D, are difficult patient populations 
to cure and need effective and safe options for retreatment.  Study M15-942 is designed to retreat these subjects with an intensified regimen that contains ABT-493, an NS3/4A inhibitor; ABT-530, an NS5A inhibitor; SOF, an NS5B inhibitor and RBV, for either 12 weeks or 16 weeks.  
One of the potential benefits of retreatment with ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355023] mechanisms of action can potently inhibit the viral replication of HCV variants prese nt in DAA treatment-experienced subjects 
effectively, thus leading to a higher cure rate.
ABT-493/ABT-530 demonstrates excellent antiviral activity with high genetic barrier to 
development of drug resistance which has been translated into high SVR
12rates in clinical 
studies.  The addition of SOF and RBV to ABT-493/ABT-530 provides additional mechanism(s) 
of action that may overcome re sistant variants selected in subjects exposed to

and/or NS5Ai-containing regimen before experiencing virologic failure in an [COMPANY_013] 
HCV parent study is expected to improve the chances of achieving SVR 12.
SVR rates among HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with new, all-oral HCV DAA regimens are comparable to those observed in HCV-monoinfected patients, and this similar efficacy finding is anticipated following treatment with ABT-493/ABT-530.  In addition, successfully treating these patients is expected to address the risk of increased disease progression in untreated HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients (accelerated hepatic fibrosis progression and higher rates of liver decompensation and death compared to HCV monoinfection).  Also, liver disease is a leading cause of non-AIDS-related mortality 
among HIV-1-infected patients.

Risks
The likelihood of successfully retreating HCV infection with ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV is not known.  
The safety profile of SOF and RBV are well established.  Adverse events that are known 
as well as those not previously described may occur with the combination of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV, as detailed in the informed consent for this study.  
In addition, subjects may experience inconvenience or discomfort related to the study visits or study procedures.  Additional safety data for each drug alone and the combination of ABT-493/ABT- 530 plus SOF and RBV ar e detailed in Section 3.0and in the 
Investigator's Brochure or product package inserts.
Additional risks associated with ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV, including the 
risks of toxicity, virologic failure, and development of resistance-associated variants (Section 5.6.4 ), appear to be limited and manageable based upon the available data. 
Virologic failure criteria have been incorporated into the study to ensure subjects are exposed to appropriate durations of the regimen.  
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355026] 2016-002491-26

Given the potential benefits of expected high SVR 12rates in a population of subjects who 
failed multiple classes of DAAs, as well as the limited risks associated with the planned 
therapy, the risk-benefit assessment is favorable.
4.0 Study Objective
●The primary objectives of this study are to assess the efficacy by [CONTACT_291134] a 12-week post-treatment sustained virologic 
response (SVR 12) in each treatment arm and safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus 
SOF and RBV in adults or adolescents with chronic HCV GT1 - 6 infection 
who previously failed HCV treatment in an [COMPANY_013] HCV clinical study, 
designated as an [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study.
●Secondary objectives are to assess the percentage of subjects with HCV on-treatment virologic failure, and the percentage of subjects with HCV virologic relapse.

5.1.1 Screening
At the Screening Visit, subjects who provide written (signed and dated) informed consent 
prior to any study specific procedures will receive a unique subject number via the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system.
The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria 
specified in Section 5.2.[ADDRESS_355034]'s medical records.  Eligible subjects have up to 42 days following the Screening Visit to enroll into the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Rescreening
Subjects who test positive at Screening for any of the following parameters are not 
eligible to rescreen:
●Positive Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg);
●A positive HIV-[ADDRESS_355035];
●A positive serum pregnancy test (if female).
In addition, subjects who develop decompensated liver disease, including ascites noted on physical exam, hepatic encephalopathy or esophageal variceal bleeding during the screening period will not be eligible for rescreening.
Otherwise, subjects may be retested/rescr eened only once without approval of the [COMPANY_013] 
Therapeutic Area Scientific Director (TA SD)/TA MD, as follows:
●Subjects who have exclusionary laborat ory parameter(s) are allowed to retest 
within the screening period on the related panel(s) (e.g., exclusionary ALT 
requires a repeat chemistry panel) within  the same screening period and must 
meet all eligibility laboratory criteria on any panel that is repeated.  If the retest 
result(s) are also exclusionary, the s ubject may not be rescreened or retested 
again.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355036] 2016-002491-26
38
●Subjects who fail to enroll within [ADDRESS_355037] be rescreened for all eligibility criteria (except those noted below), not just those that were exclusionary.
Subjects may rescreen once for any other reason, with approval of the [COMPANY_013] TA SD/TA 
MD.
Subjects being rescreened do not need to be retested for HBsAg, HIV-2 Ab, HCV 
genotype and subtype, and FibroScan/liver biopsy.
5.1.[ADDRESS_355038] been confirmed, subjects 
will be allocated via IRT into one of two treatment arms based on their HCV genotype, cirrhotic status, and prior treatment experience with PI- and/or NS5Ai-containing regimens before experiencing virologic failure in an [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study.  Subjects 
will be administered study drugs at the site on Study Day 1, and provided with dosing instructions.
Study visits during the Treatment Period are detailed in Appendix C .  Safety and 
tolerability will be assessed throughout th e study.  Laboratory testing will include 
chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis as specified in Table 10 .  Plasma samples for 
pharmacokinetic analysis and HCV RNA an alysis will be collected as detailed in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] , respectively.  Blood samples for optional 
pharmacogenetic analysis will be collected as detailed in Appendix C .
All subjects will continue to return to the site on an outpatient basis as outlined in 
Appendix C .  Sites should ensure that subjects adhere to all the study visits.  Subjects who 
cannot complete their study visit per the visit schedule should ensure that they do not run out of study drug prior to their next study vis it.  Compliance is critical to ensure adequate 
drug exposure.

Subjects receiving any other HIV-1 ART in addition to those listed in Inclusion 
Criterion 10 (Section 5.2.1 ) would not be eligible for enrollment in the study.
[IP_ADDRESS] Other Concomitant Therapy
Subjects should be on a stable dose of concomitant medications for at least 14 days prior 
to initiation of study drugs.  The investigator should confirm that a concomitant medication/supplement can be safely administer ed with study drugs.  Some medications 
may require dose adjustments due to the potential for drug-drug interactions.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355070]-Treatment Period, investigators should reassess concomitant 
medications/supplements and subjects may resume previously prohibited medications/supplements or revert to pre-study doses, up to [ADDRESS_355071] plasma HIV-1 
RNA levels.
[IP_ADDRESS] Prohibited Therapy
Medications or supplements prohibited to be administered with ABT-493/ABT-530 are 
listed in Table 9 .  For subjects in the study in  countries where ABT-493/ABT-530 
(glecapravir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]) has received marketing authorization, any medications in the local label that are contraindicated to be administered with ABT-493/ABT-530 (glecapravir/pi[INVESTIGATOR_187761]) are also considered to be prohibited medications.  Subjects must be able to safely disconti nue any prohibited medications or supplements at least 14 days 
or 10 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of any study drug and not use these during the entire Treatment Period and for [ADDRESS_355072] be signed and dated prior to discontinuing any prohibited medications or supplements for the purpose of meeting study inclusion criteria.

Liver Diagnostic Testing
Subjects categorized as cirrhotic in the [COMPANY_013] HCV parent studies will be categorized 
as being cirrhotic in this study.
Subjects categorized as non-cirrhotic in the [COMPANY_013] HCV parent studies, who do not 
have a qualifying liver biopsy showing absence of cirrhosis within the previous 12 months 
from Screening or qualifying FibroScan showing absence of cirrhosis with the previous 6 months from Screening, but who otherwise meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355096] 2016-002491-26
58
the exclusion criteria will undergo liver bi opsy or non-invasive testing (FibroTest/APRI 
or FibroScan) prior to enrollment.  Selection of liver biopsy or non-invasive testing 
performed should be based on local standard practice.
Subjects must be documented as  non-cirrhotic or cirrhotic defined as meeting one of the 
following criteria: 
Non-Cirrhotic
A liver biopsy within 12 months prior to or during Screening demonstrating the 
absence of cirrhosis, e.g., a METAVIR, Batts-Ludwig, Knodell, IASL, Scheuer, or Laennec fibrosis score of ≤ 3, Ishak fibrosis score of ≤  4; or
A FibroScan
®score of < 12.5 kPa within ≤ 6 months of Screening or during Screening 
period (FibroScan®must be approved by [CONTACT_291145]); or
A Screening FibroTest score of ≤ 0.48 and Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet 
Ratio Index (APRI) < 1.
Cirrhotic

management, leading to discontinuation of study drug: 
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV
RNA measurement of > 1 log10 IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during study drug treatment; or
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during study drug 
treatment.
Confirmatory testing should be completed as soon as possible and the subject should 
remain on study drug treatment until the OTVF criterion has been confirmed.  Subjects 
with confirmed OTVF will be discontinued from study drug and will continue to be followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions until [ADDRESS_355119]-treatment ( Appendix C ).
Post-treatment relapse is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ (defined as 
2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements ≥ LLOQ) at any post-treatment visit, for subjects 
who completed treatment (defined as study drug duration ≥ 77 days for subjects who 
received 12 weeks or ≥ 103 days for subjects who received 16 weeks) and had HCV RNA 
< LLOQ at the final treatment visit, excluding cases of reinfection, as defined below.  HCV reinfection is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after the end of treatment in 
a subject who had HCV RNA < LLOQ at Final Treatment Visit, along with the post-treatment detection of a different HCV genot ype, subtype, or clade compared with 
baseline, as determined by [CONTACT_291152]3, NS5A, and/or NS5B gene sequences.  Reinfection in the case of the same HCV subtype is defined as a clade switch, as indicated by [CONTACT_291153]-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355120]-treatment sequences by [CONTACT_291154].  If phylogenetic analysis 
is not possible due to technical difficulties, HCV reinfection may be determined with a 
confirmed HCV genotype or subtype switch by [CONTACT_291155]-LiPA Assay v2.0 or Sanger assay.
[IP_ADDRESS] Failure to Maintain HIV Virologic Suppression
HIV-[ADDRESS_355121]-Treatment Period, as detailed in Appendix C .
The criteria for failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression among subjects on stable ARTs is as follows:
●HIV-1 RNA ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL confirmed on [ADDRESS_355122] compliant with their HIV ARV therapy
At the time a confirmatory HIV-1 RNA is drawn, a sample for HIV-1 genotypic resistance testing should also be obtained; this sample will be analyzed if the subject's repeat plasma HIV-1 RNA is ≥ 500 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL.  Subjects should remain on HCV study drug treatment 
and his/her current ART regimen while the failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression is being confirmed.  A confirmatory HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic resistance blood draw can be done as an unscheduled visit.  However, if this blood draw falls on the date of a scheduled study visit ( Appendix C ), only a single HIV-1 RNA and HIV-1 genotypic 
resistance blood draw needs to be performed at this visit.
During the Treatment Period, subjects with confirmed failure to maintain HIV-1 RNA 
suppression should con tinue HCV study drug treatment unless there is a requirement for 
prohibited concomitant medications (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ) to construct a new HIV ART 
regimen.
Clinical management of failure to maintain HIV virologic suppression during the study 
(Treatment and Post-Treatment Period) will be handled by [CONTACT_291156].
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355123] be 
discussed with the [COMPANY_013] TA MD prior to the change being made, unless the change is 
being made to address an immediate safety concern.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
[COMPANY_013] may terminate this study prematurely, ei ther in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to [COMPANY_013] in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by [CONTACT_26257].  If [COMPANY_013] terminates the study for safety reasons, [COMPANY_013] will immediately notify the investigator by [CONTACT_26258].

At each study visit after Day 1 during the Tr eatment Period, subjects will be instructed to 
bring all bottles of study drug (full, partial or empty) for assessment of treatment 
compliance.  At post-baseline dispensing visits denoted in Appendix C , study site 
personnel will assess subject compliance by [CONTACT_187818], as well as the exact number of remaining tablets of ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF and RBV in IRT.  Treatment compliance will be based on the number of tablets dispensed, as recorded in IRT, and the number of remaining tablets.  If poor compliance is noted, the subject should be counseled and this should be documented in the subject's source.
5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The investigator or his/her representative will verify that study drug supplies are received 
intact and in the correct amounts.  This will be documented by [CONTACT_26272] (POR) or similar document and via recording in the IRT system.  A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept by [CONTACT_187820], POR number, number of tablets dispensed, subject number, initials of person who dispensed study drug and date dispensed for each subject.  An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by [CONTACT_291159].  The monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.  Final accoun tability will be verified by [CONTACT_291160].
During the study, should an enrolled subject  misplace or damage a study drug bottle of 
ABT-493/ABT-530, SOF, or RBV, the IRT system must be contact[CONTACT_291161].  If the bottle is damaged, the subject will be requested to return the remaining study drug to th e site.  Replacement st udy drug may only be 
dispensed to the subject by [CONTACT_291162].  Study drug replacement(s) and an explanation of the reason for the misplaced or damaged study drug(s) will be documented within the IRT system.  Study drug start dates for each drug and the last dose of the regimen will be documented in the subject's source documents and recorded on the appropriate eCRF.  The status of each bottle, number of tablets remaining in each bottle 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355133] 2016-002491-26

returned, and the date of reconciliation will be documented in the IRT system.  The 
monitor will review study drug accountability on an ongoing basis.
Upon completion of or discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all original study drug 
bottles (containing unused study drugs) will be returned to [COMPANY_013] (or designee) or destroyed on site.  All destruction procedure s will be according to instructions from the 
Sponsor and according to local regulations following completion of  drug accountability 
procedures.  The number of tablets of each type of study drug returned in each bottle will be noted in the IRT system or on a drug accountability log (if appropriate).  Labels must 
remain attached to the containers.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This is an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter study exploring the efficacy and safety 
of the combination regimen of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV in subjects with chronic HCV GT1 – 6 infection who experienced virologic failure in HCV treatment in an [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study.
The primary effi cacy is m easured by [CONTACT_291163]
12in each 
treatment arm.  The study design will provi de additional data on ABT-493/ABT-530 in 
combination with SOF and RBV, such as response rates in subjects infected with different 
HCV genotypes, with or without cirrhosis, the PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or NS5Ai treatment experience prior to the [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study pharmacokinetics, resistance, and the nature of virologic failure (e.g., OTVF or post-treatment relapse).
No control group is included in this study.  This study does not aim to establish non-
inferiority or superiority to the standards of care, thus a comparator arm is not needed.  
5.6.[ADDRESS_355134] and validated.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355135] Population
This study will enroll subjects infected with chronic HCV GT1 – 6 who experienced 
virologic failure following treatment with ABT-493/ABT-530, 3D or 2D regimens in an [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study, in order to assess the efficacy, safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 plus SOF and RBV as a retreatment regimen.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Dose Selections
HCV infected patients who were treated and experienced virologic failure in an [COMPANY_013] 
HCV parent study, will be treated with ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/120 mg in 
combination with SOF 400 mg and weight-based RBV for 12 or 16 weeks in the current protocol.  The dose of 300 mg/120 mg of ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355136] been achieved for the 
combination of ABT-493 300 mg and ABT-530 120 mg ( Table 6 ).  All subjects (N = 147) 
with HCV GT1, GT2, GT4, GT5 and GT6 infection have achieved SVR
12, following 8 or 
12 weeks of treatment and a high SVR 12rate of 96% has been achieved for GT3 infected 
subjects (107/111).  In Study M15-410 Part 1, 21 out of 22 subjects (95%) who were previous DAA-experienced and treated with the ABT-[ADDRESS_355137] achieved SVR
12.  
ABT-493 and ABT-530 regimens including the ABT-493/ABT-530 300 mg/[ADDRESS_355138] frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, nausea and headache and were mostly Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  In all subjects with baseline ALT 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355139] been no on-treatment ALT elevations above baseline grade.
SOF, an HCV nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor, is approved for use at a dose 
of 400 mg per day.  At this  dose, SOF has been investigated in various studies in 
combination with RBV, pegIFN/RBV, and with  the protease inhibito r simeprevir and the 
NS5A inhibitors DCV and LDV with or without RBV in cirrhotic and non-ci rrhotic 
subjects, including those with prior failure of pegIFN and a protease inhibitor.48,[ADDRESS_355140] treatment limiting toxicities and a safety profile that is similar to that of the [COMPANY_013] 
DAA's regimen.  Therefore this dose will used in this study.
Weight based RBV, 600 mg to 1200 mg, will be dose-divided to twice daily.  This dose is 
approved for treatment of adult and adolescent patients with chronic HCV infection in combination with pegIFN.  The same dose is selected for this study because its safety profile has been well characterized when administered with pegIFN, including incidence of hemolytic anemia, and there are well-defined dose reduction criteria in the event of RBV-induced anemia as noted in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  In addition, the RBV dose was studied 
in the absence of pegIFN in adults in Studies M12-267, M12-746, M12-998, M11-652, M11-646, M13-098, M13-389, M13-961, M14-002, and M14-004, and in adolescents in Study M14-748, and the RBV dose was found to be generally safe and well tolerated and resulted in high SVR rates.  It has been demonstrated that for previous virologic failures, the inclusion of additional drugs that have  different mechanisms of action in the 
combination retreatment regimen will increase the probability to achieve SVR.
50  
[IP_ADDRESS] Rationale for Duration Selections
HCV infected patients who were treated and experienced a virologic failure in an [COMPANY_013] 
HCV parent study, will receive a regimen of ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355141]'s HCV genotype, ci rrhotic s tatus and 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355142] 2016-002491-26
79
prior treatment experience with PI- and/or NS5Ai-containing regimens before 
experiencing HCV virologic failure in an [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study.  In Part 1 of Study M15-410, the efficacy and safety of ABT-493 and ABT-530 with or without RBV in adults with chronic HCV GT1 infection without cirrhosis who previously failed treatment with a DAA-containing regimen were assessed.  The interim results from this 
study, as summarized in Section 3.0, demonstrate high SVR
12rates (mITT rates of 95 –
100%) following a 12-week treatment regimen of ABT-493 and ABT-530 with or without 
RBV.  In the current study, the addition of SOF and RBV to ABT-493/ABT-530 offers multiple mechanisms of action in the retreatment regimen and will increase the probability to achieve SVR following similar treatment duration.  
In order to increase the probability to achieve SVR for subjects who are more difficult to 
treat, such as subjects with HCV GT3 infection, subjects with compensated cirrhosis and subjects who previously failed PI [INVESTIGATOR_1238]/or NS5Ai-containing regimens prior to experiencing a virologic failure in an [COMPANY_013] HCV parent study, the treatment duration will be extended to 16 weeks.  Since ABT-493/ABT-530 has pangenotypic activity, subjects with mixed infections and undetermined genotypes will be allowed to be treated 
in this study.  The extended treatment duration of 16 weeks for subjects with GT3 infection was based on the study design of Part 3 of Study M14-868.  In Part 3 of Study M14-868, GT3-infected subjects who were treatment-naïve are allocated to the 
12 week arm, GT3-infected subjects who were IFN-experienced with compensated cirrhosis are allocated to the 16 week arm, GT3-infected subjects who were IFN-experienced subjects without compensated cirrhosis are allocated at a 1:1 ratio to the 12 week and 16 week treatment arms.  To be consistent with the rationale of duration selection in Study M14-868, a longer treatment duration of 16 weeks with an intensified regimen of ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355143] already failed a DAA-containing regimen.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355144] historically required longer treatment durations 
versus patients without cirrhosis.  The ABT-493/ABT-530 regimen was evaluated for 12 week treatment duration in  Study M14-172 for subjects with HCV GT1, 2, 4, 5, and 
6 infection with compensated cirrhosis, who are either treatment-naïve, or PI- and NS5Ai-naïve.  In Study M14-867, subjects infected with HCV GT1 with cirrhosis were evaluated following an 8 week treatment duration with ABT-493/ABT-530.  All subjects who have completed the treatment (33 of 34) have achieved SVR.  One subject prematurely discontinued at treatment Week [ADDRESS_355145] had no detectable virus.
Subjects who failed multiple DAA regimens are considered to be a difficult to treat 
patient population.  The ABT- 493/ABT-530 regimen was evaluated for a 12 week and 
16 week treatment duration in Study M15-410, Part 2 for DAA treatment-experienced subjects with HCV GT1, 4, 5, and 6 infection with  or without compensated cirrhosis.  It is 
anticipated that a treatment duration of 16 weeks with ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355146]/device after it is released for distribution.
Complaints associ ated with any component of this investigational product must be

adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the investigator will provide an "Other" cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity.  Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by [CONTACT_8786], or reported spontaneously by [CONTACT_41614].
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
[IP_ADDRESS] Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illne ss is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a previously reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are usually not considered to be adverse events or serious adverse events (SAE).  However, laboratory abnormalities or changes in vital signs that result in study drug discontinuation or 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355148] 2016-002491-26
82
interruption, necess itate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria 
(see Section 6.1.7 regarding toxicity management) and/or are deemed clinically 
significant by [CONTACT_291164] r ecorded as AEs or SAEs as defined in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and Section [IP_ADDRESS] .
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered 
an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition 
and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpected ly during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned due to worsening of the pre-existing condition), then the deterioration 
of the condition for which the elective surgery /procedure is being done will be considered 
an adverse event.
[IP_ADDRESS] Serious Adverse Events
If an AE meets any of the following criteria,  it is to be reported to [COMPANY_013] as a SAE 
within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event:
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opi[INVESTIGATOR_871], would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_291109]'s hospi[INVESTIGATOR_4408].  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355149] 2016-002491-26
83
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively 
minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], prol ongation of hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059], or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4).
The table of clinical toxicity grades "National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4" is available from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) website at:  http://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010-06-14_QuickReference_5x7.pdf and is to be used in the grading of adverse events.  Below are the general grading categories.  However, the investigator should always search NCI

6.1.[ADDRESS_355151] to ABT-493/ABT-530, 
SOF, and RBV.  The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic plausibility, clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355152] 2016-002491-26
85
For causality assessments, events assessed as  having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not reported causality or deemed it as not 
assessable, [COMPANY_013] will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opi[INVESTIGATOR_26183], "Other" cause of event must be provided by [CONTACT_147575].
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All serious adverse events as well as protocol-related non-serious adverse events 
(e.g., infection at liver biopsy site) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until the administration of the first dose of study drug.  From the time of the administration of the first dose of study drug until [ADDRESS_355153]-Treatment 
Period, all spontaneously reported SAEs will be collected (nonserious AEs will not be collected).
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 .

86
Figure 2. Adverse Event Collection
6.1.5 Adverse Event Reporting
In the event of a serious adverse event, whether associated with study drug or not, the 
Investigator will notify Clinical Pharmacovigilance within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event by [CONTACT_26280] (E DC) system.  Serious adverse events that occur prior to the site

6.1.6 Pregnancy
Subjects and their partners should avoid pregnancy, and males should avoid sperm 
donation, starting with Study Day 1 until 4 months for females subjects and 7 months for male subjects and their female partners after stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_291110], or as directed by [CONTACT_291142], whichever is more restrictive.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355158] and the outcome of the 
pregnancy will be collected for pregnancies through the duration of the study (or per local RBV label).  The investigator is encouraged to report the pregnancy information to the voluntary RBV Pregnancy Registry.  Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within [ADDRESS_355159] ory clinical 
resolution.  A toxicity is deemed "clinically significant" based on the medical judgment of the investigator.  Please refer to Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Section [IP_ADDRESS] , 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , Section [IP_ADDRESS] , and Section [IP_ADDRESS] for details on Toxicity Grades.
Interruption of DAA therapy is not recommended, and if interruption occurs under extenuating circumstances (e.g., due to hospi[INVESTIGATOR_264473]), it should be less than [ADDRESS_355160] the [COMPANY_013] Study TA MD.  The Investigator should ensure 
that any study drug interruptions or RBV dose modifications and associated adverse events are promptly entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
The toxicity management guidelines below should be followed throughout the Treatment 
Period of the study.  Specific toxicity manag ement guidelines apply to the instances of:

decreases in hemoglobin for subjects receiving RBV (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), increases in ALT 
(Section [IP_ADDRESS] ), and reductions in Creatinine Clearance (Section [IP_ADDRESS] ).
[IP_ADDRESS] Grade 1 or 2 Laboratory Abnormalities and/or Adverse 
Events
Subjects who develop Grade 1 or 2 laboratory abnormalities or adverse events may 
continue study drugs with appropriate medical management and follow-up per study 
protocol.
[IP_ADDRESS] Grade 3 or 4 Laboratory Abnormalities
With the exception of Grade 3 or higher abnormalities of uric acid, phosphorus, total 
cholesterol, triglycerides, or glucose (in subjects  with a history of diabetes), if a subject 
experiences a Grade [ADDRESS_355162] should be repeated (repeat testing should be done on a re-drawn sample).  If the Grade 3 or greater abnormality is confirmed, the investigator should assess whether the abnormality can be managed medically as per local practice without interruption of study drug or whether study drugs should be interrupted and the laboratory parameter followed until it improves.
If study drugs are interrupted and restarted and the abnormality recurs, then study drugs 
should be permanently discontinued.
Decreases in hemoglobin level should be managed according to the guidance in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] , elevations of serum ALT should be managed according to the guidance in 
Section [IP_ADDRESS] and reductions in creatinine clearance for subjects receiving RBV should 
be managed according to the guidance in Section [IP_ADDRESS] .  Grade 3 or greater 
abnormalities of uric acid, phosphorus, total cholesterol, triglycerides or glucose (in subjects with a history of diabetes) should be managed medically as appropriate and do not require confirmation or study drug interruption, unless deemed necessary by [CONTACT_093].

[IP_ADDRESS] Grade [ADDRESS_355164] experiences a Grade 3 or 4 adverse event or serious adverse event that is 
considered unrelated (no reasonable possibility) to  the study drugs, it is not necessary to 
interrupt study drugs unless an interruption is required because of the nature of the event (e.g., unable to take oral medications).
The investigator should ensure that all serious adverse events are reported to [COMPANY_013] 
within 24 hours of awareness.  Serious adverse event follow-up information, including associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations), must be reported to [COMPANY_013] within 24 hours of awareness by [CONTACT_41619].
Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and any associated dose interruptions (or discontinuations) 
should be entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Decreases in Hemoglobin for Subjects 
Receiving RBV
Reductions in hemoglobin are a well characterized side effect of RBV exposure.  If a 
subject experiences a hemoglobin decrease that meets the criteria outlined in Table [ADDRESS_355165] should be performed.  If the hemoglobin decrease is confirmed to meet 
the criteria, the management guidelines in Table 13 should be followed, unless local RBV 
label requires a more stringent management.  Management will be different for subjects without a history of known cardiac diseas e and subjects with known cardiac disease.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355166] 2016-002491-26
91
Use of hematologic growth factors (such as erythropoietin, filgrastim), or blood 
transfusions is not recommended and is permitted only with approval of the [COMPANY_013] Study TA MD.  Management of hematologic growth factor therapy is the responsibility of the investigator, and growth factors will not be provided by [CONTACT_26282].
Alternate management of hemoglobin decreases outside of these criteria requires approval 
of the [COMPANY_013] Study TA MD, except for more stringent management requirement from a local RBV label.

* For subjects aged 12 to less than 18, RBV dose reduction should be per local RBV label.
Management of other hematologic parameters besides hemoglobin (like WBC, platelets, 
neutrophils, etc.) should be performed according to the local RBV label.  Alternative RBV dosing can be used if agreed upon by [CONTACT_26238].

[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Increases in ALT
If a subject experiences a post-baseline ALT value ≥ 5 × ULN that is also ≥ 2 × Baseline 
value, the subject should have a confirmatory test should be performed.  If, the ALT is 
value confirmed ≥ 5 × ULN, and ≥ 2 × Baseline value, the recommendations below 
should be followed:
●Complete hepatic questionnaire
●Evaluate for alternate etiology of ALT elevation; document in the source, 
update the medical history and concomitant medications eCRF (if applicable),and obtain Anti-HAV IgM, Anti-HAV Total , Anti-HBc IgM, Anti-HBc Total, 
Anti-HBs, HBV DNA, HBsAg, Anti-HEV IgM, Anti-HEV IgG and HEV RNA, and other additional tests, as appropriate.
●Manage the subject as medically appropriate.
●Repeat ALT, AST, total and fractionated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase and INR within 1 week.  Repeat liver chemistries as indicated until resolution.
●Discontinue study drugs if any of the following is observed at any time:
○ALT level is ≥ 20 × ULN in the absence of an alternate etiology.
○Increasing direct bilirubin or INR or onset of symptoms/signs of hepatitis.
○At the discretion of the investigator.
Alternate management of confirmed ALT increases requires approval of the [COMPANY_013] 
Study TA MD.
[IP_ADDRESS] Management of Reductions in Creatinine Clearance for 
Subjects Receiving RBV
Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated using the MDRD equation) and 
Creatinine clearance (CrCl, estimated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation) will be calculated throughout the study.  Both results w ill be provided to the investigators, but 
toxicity management and RBV dose adjustment will be performed based on CrCl values only.  
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355172] experiences an CrCl value below 50 mL/min, a confirmatory test should be 
performed as soon as possible.  If CrCl is confirmed to be below 50 mL/min, medical evaluation should include a full review of concurrent medications, including those taken on an as needed basis, those which are sold over the counter, and any dietary and herbal supplements.  
In addition, the following should occur:
●Concomitant medication dose reduction based on CrCl or eGFR should be 
done as per local prescribing informatio n of the concomitant medication (if 
applicable).  
●The [COMPANY_013] Study TA MD should be c ontacted to discuss whether dose 
modification or drug substitution may be required for concomitant medications 
given the reduced kidney function as well as potential drug interactions with 
the DAAs.  Drug interactions between concomitant med ications and the 
DAAs, for example, could potentially increase antihypertensive medications' 
exposures, especially in the setting of re duced kidney function and may result 
in further deterioration of renal function.  Also, if anti-hypertensive medications are adjusted, vital signs must be closely monitored to ensure appropriate blood pressure control.
●The dose of RBV should be adjusted as follows:  
○for CrCl between 30 and 50 mL/min:  alternating doses of 200 and 400 mg 
every other day; 
○for CrCl less than 30 mL/min – 200 mg  daily.  
●A urine specimen should be obtained for urinalysis (including urine for albumin), and a separate urine specimen for archive should be obtained.
●Creatinine clearance and any other necessary analytes should be repeated 
within 7 days and as clinically indicated until resolution.
○If CrCl improves to > 50 mL/min within 14 days after RBV dose 
modification, consideration should be given to increase RBV dose towards 
the original value.  If CrCl decreases below 50 mL/min again, RBV should be permanently discontinued.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355173] 2016-002491-26
95
The investigator should ensure that any concomitant med ication changes, RBV dose 
modifications, study drug interruption and study drug discontinuations, as well as related 
adverse events are entered into the appropriate eCRFs.
Alternative management of RBV dose in the setting of reduced renal function will require 
approval of the [COMPANY_013] Study TA MD, unless it is a more stringent management required by [CONTACT_291142].
6.1.8 Collection of Data Regarding Known AIDS-Defining 
Conditions
HIV-1 infected subjects participating in clinical trials may develop conditions typi[INVESTIGATOR_291112].  A lis t of these known AIDS-Defining Conditions (ADCs) is 
presented in Appendix D .  The events listed in Appendix D will be summarized as HIV-
related events, not as adverse events.  These ADCs will be collected from the time of study drug administration until [ADDRESS_355174] Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the 
biologic or drug component of the product.
For a product this may include, but is not limited to, damaged/broken product or 
packaging, product appearance whose color/markings do not match the labeling, labeling discrepancies/inadequacies in the labeling/instructions (example:  printing illegible), missing components/product, or packaging issues.
Any information available to help in the determination of causality to the events outlined 
directly above should be captured.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355175] be reported to the 
Sponsor within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event via the Product 
Complaint form.  Product Complaints occurring during the study will be followed-up to a satisfactory conclusion.  All follow-up informat ion is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an 
authorized representative) and documented in source as required by [CONTACT_1034].  Product Complaints associ ated with adverse events  will be reported in the study summary.  All 
other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis.
Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint 
condition.  In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by [CONTACT_187824] 30 days.  If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return.  The description of the complaint is important for [COMPANY_013] in order to enable [COMPANY_013] to investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required.
7.0 Protocol Deviations
[COMPANY_013] does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects.  The principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_26184], and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.  If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified) after a subject has been enrolled, the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_26185] (IEC)/Independent Review Board (IRB) regulatory authorities (as applicable), and the following [COMPANY_013] Clinical Monitors:
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355176] 
one dose of study drug.  Analyses, as specified in the statistical analysis plan, will be presented by [CONTACT_166884].  Efficacy analyses will be performed on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population defined as all enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug, unless otherwise specifie d.  Sensitivity analyses of the primary 
efficacy endpoint, when applicable, will be performed on the intention-to-treat population modified to exclude subjects who did not achieve SVR
12for reasons other than virologic 
failure (mITT-VF).
No data will be imputed for any efficacy or safety analysis except for analyses of SVR 
endpoints (HCV RNA data).  HCV RNA values will be selected for the analyses of all SVR endpoints (e.g., SVR
4, SVR 12, and SVR 24) based on defined visit windows.  A 
backward imputation method will be used to impute missing responses for SVR analyses.

Summary statistics (N, mean, median, SD, and range) will be presented for continuous 
variables (e.g., age and BMI).  The number and percentage of subjects will be presented for categorical variables (e.g., gender and race).
Study drug exposure and compliance will be summarized.  Treatment compliance to study 
drug will be calculated based on the percentage of tablets taken relative to the total tablets expected to be taken.  A subject is considered to be compliant if the percentage is between 80% and 120%.  Compliance will be calculated for each subject and summarized with the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum.  The percentage of compliant subjects will be summarized for each treatment arm.
8.1.2 Efficacy
All efficacy analyses will be performed on the ITT population, unless otherwise specified.
Plasma HCV RNA levels will be determined for each sample collected by [CONTACT_187827]
®AmpliPrep/COBAS®TaqMan®HCV Quantitative 
Test, v2.0.  The notation "HCV RNA < LLOQ" is used to represent all HCV RNA values < 15 IU/mL that are HCV RNA detected or HCV RNA not detected.  HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ 
are all quantifiable values.
[IP_ADDRESS] Primary Efficacy Endpoints
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percen tage of subjects in the ITT population who 
achieve SVR
12(HCV RNA < LLOQ [ADDRESS_355179] actual dose of study drug), by 
[CONTACT_166884].  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR 12will 
be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution, unle ss the number of virologic failures is less 
than 5, then the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
A summary of reason for SVR 12non-response (e.g., OTVF, relapse, other) will be 
provided.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355180] 2016-002491-26

[IP_ADDRESS] Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:
●The percentage of subjects with HCV on treatment virologic failure by 
[CONTACT_166884];
●The percentage of subjects with post- treatment HCV virologic relapse by 
[CONTACT_166884].  Subjects with reinfection will be summarized 
separately.
For the analysis of HCV virologic relapse, completion of treatment is defined as any 
subject with study drug duration of 77 days  and 103 days or greater for subjects allocated 
to treatment durations of 12 weeks and 16 weeks, respectively.  
For each treatment arm and overall, as applicable, the number and percentage of subjects 
meeting each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method.
[IP_ADDRESS] Sensitivity Analysis 
The two-sided 95% confidence interval using Wilson's score method will also be 
calculated as a sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint of SVR
12based on ITT 
population.
As sensitivity analyses, the number and percentage of subjects in the mITT-VF 
populations achieving SVR 12, as applicable, will be summarized along with a two-sided 
95% confidence interval using Wilson's score interval and the Normal approximation to the binomial distribution by [CONTACT_166884].

[IP_ADDRESS] Additional Efficacy Endpoints
The following additional efficacy endpoints will be summarized by [CONTACT_291165]:
●The percentage of subjects with HCV RNA < LLOQ at each post-baseline visit 
in the Treatment Period (using data as observed);
●The percentage of subjects who achieve SVR [ADDRESS_355183] actual dose of study drug (SVR
4);
●The percentage of subjects who achieve SVR [ADDRESS_355184] actual dose of study drug (SVR
24);
●The percentage of subjects who relapse after achieving SVR 12.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each additional efficacy endpoint will be 
summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson's score 
interval.
8.1.[ADDRESS_355185] for NGS in this study are those encoding full length NS3/4A, NS5A 
and NS5B.  For each DAA target, signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions 
will be identified by [CONTACT_291166].  An appropriate prototypic reference 
sequence will be used for comparison with sequences from samples.
Only samples with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL will undergo sequence analysis 
in order to allow accurate assessment of products of amplification.  Therefore, if the HCV 
RNA level at the time of HCV virologic failure or treatment discontinuation is < 1000 IU/mL, the sample closest in t ime after HCV virologic failure/treatment 
discontinuation with an HCV RNA level ≥1000 IU/mL will be used.  Included time 
points for analyses on samples from subjects who do not achieve SVR
12are 1) the sample 
closest in time after failure/discontinuation with an HCV RNA level of ≥ 1000 IU/mL,

and 2) [ADDRESS_355187]-DAA treatment, provided that resistance-associated variants were 
detected by [CONTACT_291167]/treatment discontinuation.
The following definitions will be used in the HCV resistance analyses:
●Baseline variant: a variant (by [CONTACT_077]) in a baseline sample ( ≥ 2% or ≥  15% 
prevalence within a subject's viral population depending on variant frequency 
threshold utilized) that was not present in appropriate prototypic reference amino acid sequence for a given DAA target.
●Post-baseline variant:  an amino acid variant in a post-baseline time point sample that was not detected at baseline (< 2%) in the subject and is detectable 
in ≥ 2% of the sequences from the post-baseline sample in a given DAA target.
●Enriched variant:  variant present in both the baseline and a post-baseline 
sample whose prevalence in the post-baseline sample is at least 20 percentage points greater than the prevalence in the baseline sample [(post-baseline % –
baseline %) ≥ 20]
●Treatment-emergent variant: A post-baseline variant or an enriched variant.
●Variant at signature [CONTACT_187834]:  va riant (relative to reference) present 
in a baseline or a post-baseline sample at a signature [CONTACT_187834].
The following analyses will be performed for all subjects:
To characterize prior HCV DAA resistance patterns in the study population, available 
resistance analysis data obtained at the time of the subject's virologic failure of the previous DAA treatment will be collected and reported.
For all subjects, the following will be provided:
●The number and percentage of subjects with baseline variants at detection-
thresholds of ≥ 2% and ≥  15% for variants at signature [CONTACT_291184], 
and ≥ 15% for variants at non-signature [CONTACT_291185].
●A listing of all baseline variants ( ≥ 2% detection threshold) at signature 
[CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target.
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355188] 2016-002491-26
104
●A listing of all baseline variants ( ≥ 15% detection threshold) at non-signature 
[CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions for each DAA target.
●A listing of subjects with multiple baseline variants at signature [CONTACT_291186] (each at ≥ 15% prevalence within a subject's viral population), either 
within a DAA target or across any 3 DAA targets.
●The impact of baseline variants on treatment outcome will be assessed as 
follows:  for each variant, the SVR 12rate will be calculated for subjects with 
and without the variant and the [ADDRESS_355189]'s HCV subtype and DAA target.  Subjects not achieving SVR
12due to non-virologic reasons will be excluded from this analysis.  These 
analyses will be performed based on the following criteria:
○An analysis will be performed based on amino acid position, using 
detection thresholds of ≥ 2% and ≥  15% for all variants at each signature 
[CONTACT_291187] a detection threshold of ≥ 15% for all variants at 
each non-signature [CONTACT_187834].
○An additional analysis will be performed using detection thresholds of ≥2% and ≥ 15% for the impact of each specific variant as specified by 
[CONTACT_291168].
The following will be provided for subjects who do not achieve SVR
12and have post-
baseline resistance data available:
●A listing by [CONTACT_187831]-emergent variants relative to the baseline sequence will be provided for each DAA target
●A listing by [CONTACT_291169]
●The number and percentage of subjects (with subject listing) with variants emerging at an amino acid position relative to baseline
●The number and percentage of subjects (with subject listing) with certain specific emerged variants
The persistence of post-baseline variants at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid 
positions for each target will be assessed by [CONTACT_291170]-Treatment Week 24.  A listing 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355190] at the time 
of failure/discontinuation, then that target may not be sequenced in subsequent samples from that subject.
Phylogenetic analysis will be conducted on HCV sequences from available baseline 
samples from all subjects in the study in order to accurately determine their subtypes.  The resulting subtype information will be presented in summaries of baseline characteristics and efficacy subgroup analyses.

[IP_ADDRESS] HCV/HIV-1 Co-Infection
The following additional safety data will be summarized and analyzed for subjects with 
HCV/HIV-1 co-infection overall and in each treatment arm:
●The percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-[ADDRESS_355196]-Treatment Week 12 using the FDA Snapshot Algorithm;
●The number and percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 20 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at each applicable time point;
●Change from baseline in CD4+ T-cell count (absolute and percent) to each applicable post-baseline time point;
●Change from baseline in lymphocytes (count and percentage) and CD8+ T- cell 
counts (absolute and percent) to each applicable post-baseline time point;
●The listing of subjects with a plasma HIV-1 RNA value ≥ 200 copi[INVESTIGATOR_014]/mL at 
any baseline or post-baseline visit during the study.
The analysis of change fro m baseline in  CD4+ T-cell c ount (absolute and percent), 
lymphocytes (count and percentage) and CD8+ T-cell counts (absolute and percent) will 
report the mean and median values at baseline and at each applicable post-baseline visit, as well as N, mean, median, standard deviation (SD), minimum and maximum values for the change from baseline overall and within each treatment arm.
8.1.[ADDRESS_355197] and group.  Summary statistics will be computed for each time and visit.
Plasma concentration data from this study may be combined with data from other studies 
and analyzed using the following general methodology:
Population phar macokinetic analyses will be performed using the actual sampling time 
relative to dosing.  Pharmacokinetic models will be built using a non-linear mixed-effect 
modeling approach with the NONMEM software (version VII, or higher version).  The 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355198] 2016-002491-26
108
structure of the starting pharmacokinetic model will be based on the pharmacokinetic 
analysis of data from previous studies.  Apparent oral clearance (CL/F) and apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of the PK analytes will be the pharmacokinetic parameters of major interest in the NONMEM analyses.  If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis.  The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models.
●The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the 
alternative model(s).
●The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity  (a straight line with zero intercept 
and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s).
●Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and 
change in inter-subject and intra-subject error.
Once an appropriate base pharmacokinetic model (including inter- and intra-subject error 
structure) is developed, empi[INVESTIGATOR_187789].  The 
relationship between thes e conditional estimates CL/F and V/F values with only 
potentially physiologically relevant or clinically  meaningful covariates (such as subject 
age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic or renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or a generalized additive method (GAM), or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05.  After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full  model will be employed to evaluate the 
significance (at P< 0.005, corresponding to an increase in objective function > 7.88 for 
one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model.
In general, all continuous covariates will be entered in the model, initially in a linear 
fashion, with continuous covariates centered around the median value.  Linear or non-
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355199] 2016-002491-26
109
linear relationships of primary pharmacokinetic parameters with various covariates may 
also be explored.  For example:
TVCLi = Theta(1) + Theta(2) (Comedication [1,2,…] + Theta(3) (WTi-median value) + 
Theta(4) (AGEi – median value).
Where TVCLi = Typi[INVESTIGATOR_187790] i1, Theta(1) is the intercept 
and Theta(2) – (4) are regression parameters relat ing the fixed effects (weight and age 
centered on the median value) to clearance.
Relationship between exposure (e.g., population pharmacokinetic model predicted 
concentrations over time or average concentrations or AUC or trough concentrations of the individual model-predicted pharmacokinetic profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and clinical observations (antiviral activity) will be explored.  Exposure-response relationships for primary and secondary efficacy variables and/or some safety measures of interest may also be explored.
Additionally, relationship between exposure and safety endpoints of interest may also be 
explored.  Additional analyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.

9.0 Ethics
9.1 Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) or Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requires that the clinical protocol, any protocol 
amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of subject information related to the study (e.g., a dvertisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary documents be reviewed by [CONTACT_18369]/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.  IEC/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent and subject information and/or advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a study site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/IRB approval and approval by 
[CONTACT_243940](ies), if required by [CONTACT_427], prior to implementation of any changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, maintain and archive study essential documents according to ICH GCP and all other applicable regulatory authorities.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated by [CONTACT_13125], will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory Agencies, as required by [CONTACT_427].  During the conduct of the study, the investigator should promptly provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and any additional reports required by [CONTACT_427]) to the IEC/IRB of any changes that affect the conduct of the study and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation of the submission to the IEC/IRB should also be provided to [COMPANY_013].
9.[ADDRESS_355202] of the Study
The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Council on 
Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical 
ABT-493/ABT-[ADDRESS_355203] Information and Consent
The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to any study-related screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will be reviewed and signed and dated by [CONTACT_423], the person who administered the informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A copy of the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in the subject's medical record.  An entry must also be made in the subject's dated source documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to any study-related procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
The optional pharmacogenetic testing and analyses will only be performed if the subject 
has voluntarily signed and dated the IRB/IEC approved pharmacogenetic informed consent, after the nature of the testing has been explained and the subject has had an opportunity to ask questions.  The pharmacogenetic informed consent must be signed before the pharmacogenetic testing is performed.  If the subject does not consent to the additional pharmacogenetic testing, it w ill not imp act the subject's participation in the 
study.
In the event a subject withdraws from the main study, optional pharmacogenetic 
exploratory research samples will continue to be stored and analyzed unless the subject 
specifically withdraws consent for the optional samples.  If consent is withdrawn for the optional sampling, the subject must inform their study doctor, and once [COMPANY_013] is informed, the optional samples will be dest royed.  However, if the subject withdraws 
his/her consent and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as 
part of the overall research data.

Duration of Treatment:   12 or 16 weeks.
Criteria for Evaluation:
Efficacy:
Efficacy will be assessed utilizing plasma HCV RNA levels throughout the study.
Resistance:The following information will be tabulated and summarized:  1) for all subjects receiving study drug 
with available samples, the variants at baseline at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated amino acid positions relative to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence; and 2) for subjects who do not achieve SVR
[ADDRESS_355242]-baseline sample, all treatment-emergent variants relative to baseline.
Pharmacokinetic:
Individual plasma concentrations of ABT-493, ABT-530, SOF, primary metabolite of SOF 
(GS-331007), and RBV will be tabulated and summarized.
Safety:Safety and tolerability will be assessed by [CONTACT_12902], physical examinations, clinical 
laboratory tests, and vital signs.
Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
[ADDRESS_355243] actual dose of study drug) in each treatment arm and overall.  The primary 
endpoint will be analyzed based on intention to treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution, unless number of virologic failures is less than 5, then the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
The secondary efficacy variables are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure in each treatment arm and 
overall;
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse in each treatment arm and overall.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson score method.  Analyses of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy subgroup analyses will be performed.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, the variants at signature [CONTACT_41634]-
associated amino acid positions at baseline identified by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
variants in available post-baseline samples identified by [CONTACT_187812], 
2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated positions identified by [CONTACT_187813], and 3) the persistence of viral variants by [CONTACT_077].

137
Statistical Methods (Continued):
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of ABT-493, ABT-530, SOF, primary metabolite of SOF (GS-331007), and RBV 
will be tabulated for each subject and treatment arm.  Summary statistics will be computed for each 
treatment arm.
Safety:
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drugs will be included in the safety analyses.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_166884].  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be 
provided by [CONTACT_187799].  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by [CONTACT_166884].

Statistical Methods:
Efficacy:
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of subjects who achieve SVR 12(HCV RNA < LLOQ 
[ADDRESS_355259] actual dose of study drug) in each treatment arm and overall.  The primary 
endpoint will be analyzed based on intention to treat (ITT) population.  The number and percentage of subjects achieving SVR
12will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the 
normal approximation to the binomial distribution, unless the number of virologic failures is less than 5, then the Wilson's score method will be used for the confidence interval instead.
The secondary efficacy variables are:
!The percentage of subjects with on-treatment HCV virologic failure in each treatment arm and 
overall;
!The percentage of subjects with post-treatment HCV virologic relapse in each treatment arm 
and overall.
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each secondary efficacy endpoint will be summarized along with a two-sided 95% confidence interval using the Wilson score method.  Analyses of additional efficacy endpoints and efficacy subgroup analyses will be performed.
Resistance:
For all subjects receiving study drugs and with available samples, the variants at signature [CONTACT_41634]-
associated amino acid positions at baseline identified by [CONTACT_48832] (NGS) and comparison to the appropriate prototypic reference sequence will be analyzed.
The following resistance information will be analyzed for subjects receiving study drugs who do not 
achieve SVR
12and who have a post-baseline sample with HCV RNA ≥ 1000 IU/mL:  1) the amino acid 
variants in available post-baseline samples identified by [CONTACT_187812], 2) the amino acid variants in available post-baseline samples at signature [CONTACT_41634]-associated positions identified by [CONTACT_187813], and 3) the persistence of viral variants by [CONTACT_077].
Pharmacokinetic:
Plasma concentrations of ABT-493, ABT-530, SOF, primary metabolite of SOF (GS-331007), and RBV 
will be tabulated for each subject and treatment arm.  Summary statistics will be computed for each 
treatment arm.
Safety:
All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drugs will be included in the safety analyses.  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Safety summaries will be provided by [CONTACT_166884].  The number and percentage of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events (i.e., any event that begins or worsens in severity after initiation of study drug) will be tabulated by [CONTACT_7204] (SOC) and preferred term 
(PT).  The tabulation of the number of subjects with treatment-emergent adverse events also will be 
provided by [CONTACT_187799].  Change from baseline in laboratory tests and vital signs measurements to each time point of collection will be summarized, and values that are potentially clinically significant, according to predefined criteria, will be summarized by [CONTACT_166884].

[IP_ADDRESS] HCV Virologic Failure Criteria
The following criteria will be considered evidence of OTVF, for the purposes of subject 
management, leading to discontinuation of study drug: 
●Confirmed increase from nadir in HCV RNA (defined as 2 consecutive HCV
RNA measurement of > 1 log10 IU/mL above nadir) at any time point during 
study drug treatment; or
●Confirmed HCV RNA ≥ 100 IU/mL (defined as 2 consecutive HCV RNA 
measurements ≥ 100 IU/mL) after HCV RNA < LLOQ during study drug 
treatment.
Confirmatory testing should be completed as  soon as possible and the subject should 
remain on study drug treatment until the OTVF criterion has been confirmed.  Subjects 
with confirmed OTVF will be discontinued from study drug and will continue to be 
followed in the Post-Treatment Period for the emergence and persistence of resistant viral substitutions until [ADDRESS_355379]-treatment ( Appendix C ).
Post-treatment relapse is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ (defined as 
2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements ≥ LLOQ) at any post-treatment visit, for subjects 
who completed treatment (defined as study drug duration ≥ 77 days for subjects who 
received 12 weeks or ≥ 103 days for subjects who received 16 weeks) and had HCV RNA 
< LLOQ at the final treatment visit, excluding cases of reinfection, as defined below.  HCV reinfection is defined as confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ after the end of treatment in 
a subject who had HCV RNA < LLOQ at Final Treatment Visit, along with the post-treatment detection of a different HCV genot ype, subtype, or clade compared with 
baseline, as determined by [CONTACT_291152]3, NS5A, and/or NS5B gene sequences.  R einfection in the case of the same HCV 
subtype is defined as a clade switch, as indicated by [CONTACT_291178]-treatment sequences by [CONTACT_291154].  If phylogenetic analysis 
is not possible due to technical difficulties,  HCV reinfection may be determined with a

Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO) is an obstructive lung disease that can affect individuals that have undergone 
a lung or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  BO has been studied most extensively in lung transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], where it is considered to represent chronic lung rejection.  It is the leading cause of death after 
lung transplant, with mortality rates up to 55%.  In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, BO is thought 
to be a manifestation of chronic graft-vs-host di sease (GVHD).  Up to 45% of patients undergoing 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the NHLBI develop a decline in pulmonary function.  
Conventional therapy for patients who develop BO consists of augmentation of systemic 
immunosuppressants.  Systemic immunosuppression has limited efficacy for BO and is associated with 
deleterious consequences including increased risk of infections and decreased graft-versus tumor/leukemia 
effects.  
Recently, cyclosporine inhalation solution (CIS) in solution with propylene glycol has been shown to 
improve overall survival and chronic rejection-free survival in lung transplant patients.
(8)  These findings 
suggest targeted delivery of immunosuppressive therapy to the diseased organ warrants further 
investigation as this may minimize the morbidity as sociated with systemic immunosuppression.  However, 
there currently exists limited data regarding the overall efficacy of inhaled cyclosporine to treat established 
BO following lung transplantation. Furthermore, inhaled cyclosporine has not been studied in the treatment of BO following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
 
Here, we propose to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of inhaled cyclosporine for the 
treatment of BO.  Two distinct patient populations  will be offered enrollm ent in this protocol: 
hematopoietic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872550] (group A) and lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872550] (group B).  Study participants will receive CIS at an initial dose of 150mg, three times weekly.  Patients will undergo 
dose titration to a maximum dose of 300mg, three times weekly.  Drug deposition and pharmacokinetic 
analyses will be performed at the initiation of treatment.  Clinical parameters, including pulmonary 
function tests, will be measured in addition to laborato ry markers of the anti-inflammatory response to CIS.  
Adverse events associated with  treatment will be recorded. 
 
The primary objective is to 1) assess the safety and efficacy of inhaled cyclosporine as a new therapy in 
hematopoietic transplant patients and lung transplant patients with established BO.
  Additionally, we seek 
to promote a better understanding of the pathogenesis of BO in these two transplant groups and to assess 
the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled cyclosporine in patients that develop this complication.  
 
The primary endpoint of each study group is the best response, FEV [ADDRESS_1218989] 1 week apart, no more than 2 weeks apart. 
Secondary endpoints  include the toxicity profile as measured by [CONTACT_55550] (safety), the study of 
pharmacokinetics and lung deposition characteristic s of inhaled cyclosporine, improvement in high 
resolution chest CT images, results of peripheral bl ood and bronchoalveolar cytokine arrays to assess 
secondary markers of inflammation, and functional capa city measurements using a six-minute walk test.

Version 16 (Amendment N) 5 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD 1.0  OBJECTIVES 
 
1.1 Primary objective:  
 
To assess the safety and efficacy of inhaled aerosolized cyclosporine A solution in hematopoietic 
(group A) and lung transplant patients (group B) with bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) or BO syndrome 
(BOS). As of Amendment M, lung transplant patients are no longer being enrolled on this protocol. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_1218990] lung transplant, BO is the leading cause of death, accounting for 26% of all 
deaths between post transplant years 1 and 3(1).  Annually, approximately 15,[ADDRESS_1218991] 
disease (GVHD) can also occur after hematopoietic st em cell transplantation.  Up to 45% of patients 
undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at the NHLBI develop a decline in pulmonary 
function, with a significant proportion of these patients being diagnosed with BO(2).  Although 
similarities and differences in the pathogenesis of BO following lung and hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation have not been well characterized, bot h present with similar clinical manifestations and 
are treated similarly with increased doses of syst emic immunosuppressants.  The current treatment for 
BO is inadequate and involves increasing systemic immunosuppression or immune-modulating 
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014], which are of marginal efficacy. 
  
2.2  Hematopoietic Transplant and BO / BOS 
 
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is an established therapy for the treatment of many life-
threatening diseases.  However, there are many life-long complications associated with this treatment, especially lung disease.  Pulmonary dysfunction after hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
has been well documented, and is one of the most frequent complications seen after transplant 
(2, 3, 4).  
The incidence of BO after hematopoietic transplant has been estimated between 5 and 60% (4, 10).  The 
underlying pathophysiology is not completely understood, but it is thought that BO represents a form 
of chronic GVHD, with the lung epi[INVESTIGATOR_730161] a target for immune-mediated injury induced by [CONTACT_730226] T lymphocytes 
(5).  In concert with this proposed mechanism is the observation 
that GVHD is the greatest risk factor for the development of BO after stem cell transplant (4).  This is 
also supported by [CONTACT_730227].  It 
has been proposed that additional factors may have a role in the development of BO.  Other factors 
may include recurrent aspi[INVESTIGATOR_730162], infection, HLA mismatched transplant, use of busulfan or methotrexate, or lung disease prior to transplant 
(3, 4). 
 
2.3  Lung transplant and BO / BOS 
 
Bronchiolitis obliterans is the characteristic lesion seen on histology in chronic rejection after lung 
transplant.  It is estimated that 50% of lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_730163], with mortality rates upwards of 55% ( 10, 8).  The pathogenesis of BOS development 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 6 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD after lung transplant is thought to have immune and non-immune facets.  It has been postulated that 
airway inflammation and epi[INVESTIGATOR_730164] a disordered repair process that leads to the 
fibroproliferative obstruction of the small airways.  The initial injury may result from allo-immune or 
immune-independent factors or both, but have a common final pathway, BO.  Various immune 
mediated risk factors, which have been proposed as inciting events include: increased HLA 
mismatching, acute rejection, and lymphocytic bronchitis and bronchiolitis in the absence of infection.  Non-immune mediated risk factors include chronic aspi[INVESTIGATOR_1516], infection, especially with 
CMV, and ischemic graft injury 
(6,10). 
 
2.4  BO clinical findings and diagnosis 
 
BO is an obstructive lung disease of the small airways.  Patients may present with cough, dyspnea, 
wheezing, or may be asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.  Cough is present in 60-100% of patients 
and dyspnea in 50-70% (3).  In patients who have received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, signs 
and symptoms of chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) affecting other organs are often present. 
 
The gold standard for the diagnosis of BO is histologic.  On histology, there is fibrous proliferation 
affecting the small airways due to injury and inflammation of the epi[INVESTIGATOR_1663].  However, histologic evidence of disease is often difficult to obtain due to the patchy nature of the small airway 
involvement.  As such, a set of clinical diagnostic criteria has been proposed by [CONTACT_730228] 
(7).  When histology is not available, the term Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS) is 
used.  The diagnostic criteria for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is largely based on the presence of 
obstructive pattern pulmonary function tests with ex clusion of other causes of airway obstruction 
such as asthma, infection or emphysema. 
 
Criteria for the diagnosis of BOS, as proposed by [CONTACT_730229], are met when all of the 
following are met: 
 
x FEV 1/FVC less than 0.7 and a FEV 1 less than 75% predicted 
x Evidence of air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_730165]-resolution chest CT or residual volume t120% 
x Absence of infection in the respi[INVESTIGATOR_4352] 
x One or more manifestations of chronic GVHD in another organ system 
x A 10% decline from pre-transplant baseline in the FEV 1 and one of the following: 
FEV1/FVC less than 0.7, evidence of air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_730166] t120% 
 
It is generally thought that this definition is too restrictive, and it has on more than one occasion 
excluded patients with biopsy proven BO.  As such, in this study we will require for diagnosis of 
BOS an FEV 1 less than 75% predicted, absence of infection or other causative etiology, a 10% 
decline from pre-transplant baseline in the FEV 1 and one of the following: FEV1/FVC less than 0.7, 
evidence of air trappi[INVESTIGATOR_730166] t120%, or in hematopoietic transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_730167].  In lung transplant 
recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the same criteria will be used, but the FEV 1 decline required will be greater than 20% 
compared to best post-transplant measurement. 
 
For a determination of baseline values and diagnosis of BOS, FEV [ADDRESS_1218992] 3 weeks apart up to 6 months apart.  
Patients can be on a bronchodilator; however, its use will be suspended during pulmonary function 
testing. 
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 7 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD 2.5  Current Treatment for BO 
 
Current treatment for BO is inadequate and involves increasing systemic immunosuppression or 
immune-modulating therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  In patients who are not already on immunosuppressive therapy, as 
may be the case in hematopoietic stem cell patients, prednisone is commonly used as an initial 
treatment.  If there is no improvement, immunosuppression with cyclosporine or azathioprine is initiated.  While on immunosuppression, prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii and streptococcus 
pneumonia should be given 
(3).  Despi[INVESTIGATOR_98356], improvement or stabilization in lung 
function is noted in only 10-60% of patients (3, 4, 11).  Additionally, increased immunosuppression is 
associated with increased risk of infection, morbidity, and disease relapse. 
 In lung transplant –associated BO, the response rates to conven tional therapy, while varied, are quite 
disappointing.  Generally, only stabilization of FEV1  or a less steep, but continued decline is noted in 
response to therapy
25.  Recently, the use of azithromycin has shown promise for the treatment of BO 
in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  In a study by [CONTACT_872584], they were able to achieve an improvement, 
defined as FEV1 increase ≥ 10% in 30% of patients after 6 months of treatment26.  In hematopoietic 
stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], the response afte r therapy has been less well characterized.  One 
retrospective review by [CONTACT_872585], 30% improved (defined by [CONTACT_872586]), 30% had a partial response (improvement in PFTs, but 
not normalization), and 30% had no response, with continued decline in PFTs
27.  A study by [CONTACT_872587], using more aggressive immunosuppressive regimens including ATG, thalidomide, 
methylprednisolone, cyclosporine, azathioprine, note d an improvement (10% increase in FEV1) rate 
of 49%, stabilization of 17%, and progression of 34%28.  A precipi[INVESTIGATOR_872551]29. 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1218993]: Cyclosporine Inhalation Solution  
 
2.6.1 Background 
 
Cyclosporine Inhalation Solution (cyclosporine A in solution with propylene glycol, CIS) is a novel 
therapeutic agent in late stage development designed  to deliver cyclosporine topi[INVESTIGATOR_872552].  By 
[CONTACT_730230], augmented immunosuppression is provided 
directly to the diseased, target tissue while minimizing the systemic exposure and subsequent toxicity 
of the parent compound.   
 
2.6.2 Pharmacology  
 
CIS consists of the active ingredient cyclosporine (USP) dissolved in propylene glycol.  Cyclosporine 
is among the most common immunosuppressants used for the prevention and treatment of renal, 
liver, and heart allograft rejection.  Cyclosporine has also been demonstrated to extend the graft 
survival of bone marrow, skin, small intestine, pancreatic, and lung transplants, as well as treats a 
variety of rheumatologic conditions.  Cyclosporine suppresses the immune response by [CONTACT_872588] T lymphocyte activation and 
proliferation.  
Cyclosporine is an 11 amino acid cyclic peptide derived from a naturally occurring fungus.  It is 
highly lipophilic and can readily cross the cell membrane of T-lymphocytes without receptor 
activation.  Once in the cytoplasm, cyclosporine forms a drug-protein complex with a specific 
immunophilin (cyclophilin) that can block the function of calcineurin, a T cell serine threonine 
phosphatase.  When blocked, calcineurin cannot facilitate the translocation of a nuclear transcription 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 8 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD activation factor (NFAT) from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it would normally activate 
transcription of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and other cytokines.  As a result, early T cell activation and 
proliferation are inhibited in a potent manner.  By [CONTACT_730232], early lymphocyte activation is diminished and intra-graft immune events that can contribute 
to the development of BO are controlled. 
 In vivo preclinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetic experiments have not been performed with 
the current formulation of cyclosporine dissolved in propylene glycol.  However, earlier experiments 
in dogs and rats conducted with cyclosporine dissol ved in ethanol revealed that exposure to inhaled 
cyclosporine was well tolerated and resulted in lung concentrations that were several hundred-fold 
higher than concentrations in liver, kidney, heart and blood 
(12).  In rat lung transplant models, 
treatment with inhaled cyclosporine provided pr otection from allograft rejection compared to 
untreated animals and led to a dose-dependent reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine production.  
Furthermore, the degree of protection was superior to animals treated with cyclosporine via a 
systemic intramuscular route ( 13).  Similar results were found when inhaled cyclosporine was 
evaluated in a canine orthotopic lung transplant model (14). 
 
 2.6.3 Animal models 
 
Two 28-day inhalational toxicology studies spon sored by [CONTACT_612765] (Battelle studies 
N103752 in rats and N103751 in dogs) provide the core data for direct toxicity evaluation (both 
systemic and local) of both CIS and propylene glycol.  These studies were performed with daily 
dosing at maximally tolerated (rats) or maximally fe asible (dogs) doses of CIS.  Exposure in these 
studies was in excess of the maximum clinical exposure, both in terms of overall dose given per day 
for both cyclosporine and propylene glycol as well as in frequency of dosing (daily in animals vs. 
three times/week clinically).  These studies demonstrated that the local effects of cyclosporine in the 
respi[INVESTIGATOR_872553] s at the proposed clinical doses.  There was no 
unexpected systemic toxicity or significant loca l respi[INVESTIGATOR_730170] 2.7 times the maximum human exposure per dose.  
Mortality associated with the pulmonary effects of CIS was observed in rats at pulmonary deposited 
doses more than 5 times the maximum human exposure per dose. 
 
Toxicokinetic data generated in these animal studies indicate that after inhalation, lung exposure to cyclosporine is 10 to 20-fold greater than systemic exposure as measured by [CONTACT_730233], 
trough concentrations, and area under the curve (AUC ) analyses.  Cyclosporine from the propylene 
glycol formulation is partially absorbed systemic ally and does not accumulate with daily repeated 
dosing. Half-life (t
1/2) in the blood was consistent with that observed with intravenous (IV) exposure 
in both rats and dogs.  Thus, once the compound reaches the systemic circulation, the disposition 
should be similar to the disposition of the compound after IV and/or oral administration. 
 
2.6.[ADDRESS_1218994] toxicities was evaluated in repeat dose animal studies. 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 9 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD After demonstrating efficacy in preclinical cani ne and rodent transplant models, ethanol-based 
inhaled cyclosporine was tested in a series of open-label protocols evaluating its safety and efficacy 
in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_730171]/or refractory acute rejection (AR).  In patients 
with established BO, the administration of inha led cyclosporine in conjunction with standard 
immunosuppressive therapy led to improvement in re jection histology, stabilization of pulmonary 
function, and improvement in survival compared to contemporary and historical controls (15,16).  In 
patients with AR that failed to respond to high-dose pulsed methylprednisolone, the administration of 
inhaled cyclosporine in conjunction with standard immunosuppressive therapy led to improvement in 
AR histology, improvement in pulmonary function, a decline in pro-inflammatory cytokine 
production in bronchoalveolar samples, and improv ement in survival compared to contemporary 
control patients (17,18,19).  Although these studies demonstrated the safety of inhaled cyclosporine, the 
ethanol solvent was associated with substantial respi[INVESTIGATOR_872554]. 
 
These open label protocols were followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
of CIS designed to test the efficacy of CIS in  preventing lung allograft rejection and improving 
outcomes when given as prophylactic therapy (8).  A total of 56 subjects were enrolled within 7 to 42 
days following their single- or double lung transplant and treated with either CIS or placebo (propylene glycol alone).  Of these 56 subjects, a total of 26 subjects received CIS and 30 subjects 
received placebo.  All subjects underwent an initial dose-titration period to find the maximum 
tolerated dose up to a protocol-specified maximum of 300 mg (or the equivalent volume of propylene 
glycol in the placebo group).  After this 10-day period, subjects were to continue therapy [ADDRESS_1218995] completed the full 2 years of treatment.  Follow-up in the randomized cohort ranged from 24 to 56 
months. 
 
Results of the study demonstrated that treatment with CIS was associated with a 79% decreased risk 
of death compared with treatment with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.213; log-rank p = 0.007).  This 
statistically significant survival advantage was also observed when stratified by [CONTACT_717693], 
primary diagnosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV) donor positive/recipi[INVESTIGATOR_730173], or the 
occurrence of a grade [ADDRESS_1218996] epi[INVESTIGATOR_2130].  Subjects tr eated with CIS had significantly improved chronic 
rejection-free survival (HR = 0.28; log-rank p = .001) compared with subjects treated with placebo. 
Chronic rejection was diagnosed either through biopsy  by [CONTACT_730234] (BOS).  Among the 30 placebo-treated subjects, only 8 
(27%) survived free of chronic rejection compared with 18 (69%) CIS-treated subjects.  Analyses of 
BOS-free survival and BO-free survival revealed co mparable results.  However, treatment with CIS 
did not lead to significant difference in the occurrence of AR (p = 0.73). 
 
Further analysis of the study population revealed that CIS had a favorable safety profile, and long-
term administration did not lead to exacerbations  of known toxicities of oral and intravenous 
cyclosporine.  In particular, there was no evidence th at administration of CIS led to increased risk of 
nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, increased risk of in fections, or increased risk of malignancies.  
Treatment with CIS was found to be associated with respi[INVESTIGATOR_730174], but these events were generally mild/moderate, occurred early in subjects’ treatment course, 
diminished with time, and were not associated with the development of more serious respi[INVESTIGATOR_97996].  These findings were consistent with the analysis of the larger, [ADDRESS_1218997], safety 
database. 
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 10 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD In March 2005, an open label early access treatment IND was initiated.  The purpose of this protocol 
was to provide CIS to lung transplant physicians for use in suitable lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  Since

not led to the emergence of any new safety findings.  However, in recipi[INVESTIGATOR_730175] (such as those with advanced BOS), intolerance to dosing is more common, and dose titration to the maximal 300 mg dose is sometimes not possible.  
 
The safety and efficacy of CIS in preventing chronic rejection and improving survival in this 
population of lung transplant subjects has been previously demonstrated in a randomized double-
blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study.
(8)  This study was the basis for a new drug application 
(NDA) to regulatory authorities.  This application received an approvable letter, with approval 
contingent on additional supporting clinical data .  There is currently a multicenter, phase III, 
randomized, controlled trial designed to assess the efficacy of prophylactic inhaled cyclosporine for 
the prevention of bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  However, there currently 
exists limited data on the efficacy of CIS in propylene glycol to treat established BO/BOS occurring

transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  We will conduct this study using the same dose of CIS as was used in the Pi[INVESTIGATOR_872555], specifically 300 mg cyclosporine (or maximally 
tolerated dose up to 300 mg) administered three tim es per week after an initial 6-week titration 
period.  The formulation is 325 mg cyclosporine in 5.2 mL of propylene glycol (62.5 mg/mL). 
 
2.[ADDRESS_1219000] systemic absorption of inhaled 
drugs, even when administered at the same doses, are not higher in pediatric populations compared to 
adults. A study investigating lung deposition of inha led steroids in children and adults (children 2-3 
years, children 4-6 years, adults 10-41years) with asthma receiving the same fixed dose of inhaled 
budesonide (2 x 200 ug via Nebuchamber pMDI with mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_343116]) showed that 
systemic absorption of budesonide (as measured by [CONTACT_671584]) was similar for all age groups
21. 
This data suggests, from a safety standpoint, that the prescribed dose of inhaled budesonide need not 
be adjusted for age.  A previous pharmacokinetic study of CIS in adults with BO/BOS found that the 
systemic exposure of CSA using comparable doses of CIS as used in this study, is about 7-fold lower 
than is achieved with CSA given orally (Neoral®) at comparable doses22.  Maximum blood 
concentrations of cyclosporine after aerosol admi nistration of CIS ranged from 119 to 402 ng/mL, 
while 24 hr concentrations ranged from 9 to 48 ng/mL (versus reported C max concentrations of 1555 
ng/mL and trough concentrations of 268 ng/mL in liver transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840], according to the 
Neoral® label).  From these data we infer that inhaled CIS in pediatric populations age 10 and older 
will not result in toxic systemic levels of CSA, however, adjustments will be made for pediatric 
dosing per APT recommendations.  We will perform lung deposition and pharmacokinetic studies in 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 11 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD all pediatric subjects and will closely monitor their plasma cyclosporine levels during the study.  
Pediatric subjects 10 years of age or older will be allowed to participate in this study as they are at an 
age where they can cooperate sufficiently with drug administration and required study tests. 
Although there is limited data to judge potential risk in children, the seriousness of BO in children we 
believe warrants their participation.  
 
2.9   Rationale for pediatric dosing   
(per Charles Johnson, MD, Chief Medical Officer, APT Pharmaceuticals) 
 
The main safety concerns in this age group are to ensure that there is not excessive systemic exposure 
to cyclosporine and there is no impact on lung functi on.  It is normal practice to dose the currently 
licensed forms of cyclosporine (eg Neoral) on the basis of weight and monitor blood levels of 
cyclosporine.  In addition, data from Chua et al, 1994 in 8 children (median age 10.8 y) with cystic 
fibrosis showed that in this age group, age was not a factor in the amount of drug deposited following 
aerosol delivery.  Therefore, it is proposed to use weight as the main determinant of dose and divide 
the pediatric population into two groups on the basis of weight.  Current experience in the adult 
population indicates that six adult subjects weighing less than 45 Kg (range 34.5 - 44.3 Kg) have 
been exposed to CIS.  All six achieved a dose of [ADDRESS_1219001] had a peak serum cyclosporine level 
of 39.7 ng/mL one hour after the inhalation.  This level is substantially below the therapeutic level set 
for systemic therapy (250 -350 ng/mL), suggesting that systemic exposure is not likely to be dose 
limiting at least in children above 35 kg. 
 
Since the same nebulizer/compressor system will be used in the pediatric population, the proportion 
of nominal dose which is emitted at the mouth-pi[INVESTIGATOR_730178].  The lung delivered dose is 
then dependent upon minute ventilation (slightly lowe r than adults across this age group) and air 
entrainment (less dilution of the dose due to a lower inspi[INVESTIGATOR_730179]) these factors 
will exist as a continuum across the population having a greater impact in the smaller younger 
subjects.  Although the adult data suggests that there is a wide therapeutic margin (very low systemic 
cyclosporine exposure) it would seem prudent to reduce the nominal dose in the youngest, lightest 
population.  The proposed dose for the pediatric age group is as follows:  
Weight ≥ 35 Kg dose at 300 mg  
Weight < 35 Kg dose at 200 mg 
This dosing schedule is being used in a multicenter phase III Trial, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. 
 
2.10   Clinical and Scientific Justification   
 
Bronchiolitis Obliterans (BO) is an obstructive lung disease that can affect individuals after lung transplant or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.  Patients with BOS report more restrictions in their 
functional capacity than transplant patients with out BOS.  There are preliminary studies suggesting 
that depressive symptoms, fatigue, and decrements in physical function occur in association with 
bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(30).  However, the characteristics and correlates 
of adverse changes in quality of life domains, including mood disturbance, in patients with 
bronchiolitis obliterans following stem cell transplantation have not been examined in prior research.  
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in both lung and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872556].  Median survival after the development of BOS in 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872557] 2.5 years
(10).  Mortality related to BOS is greater 
than 60% in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplant and 55% in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840] 
(4,8,9). 
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 12 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD Currently, there are very few treatment options for patients who develop bronchiolitis obliterans.  
Patients are managed with increasing systemic im munosuppressants with limited success.  This is 
associated with increased infections and in the setting of a hematopoietic stem cell transplant can 
decrease the graft-versus tumor/leukemia effect.  Recent studies by [CONTACT_872589], et al have demonstrated 
that inhaled cyclosporine (CSA) in solution with propylene glycol when given prophylactically, can 
improve overall survival and chronic rejection-free survival in lung transplant patients(8).  However, 
data on the efficacy of inhaled CSA to treat established BOS in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872558].  
Because targeted delivery to the diseased organ that minimizes the morbidity associated with 
systemic immunosuppression warrants further investigation in both the lung transplant and 
hematopoietic transplant setting, we propose this phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the 
safety, efficacy, and pharmacodynamics of inhaled cy closporine in lung transplant and hematopoietic 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840]. 
 
This study also seeks to further define the inflammatory pathways associated with BOS in stem cell 
transplant and lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872559].  Bronchial epi[INVESTIGATOR_872560], flow cytometry, and gene expression 
profiling.  These studies will be performed on samples collected from subjects and will promote further delineation of the underlying pathogenesis in BOS.  Additionally, this study will examine the 
anti-inflammatory effects of cyclosporine on me diators of inflammation and differential gene 
expression in these populations.  This has not been thoroughly studied in hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].  This study evaluating aerosolized cyclosporine will contribute to a greater 
understanding of the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis ob literans, and set the stag e for larger trials in 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant and lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_840].

4.0 STUDY DESIGN 
 
The study is designed as a non-randomized, Phase II study of aerosolized cyclosporine A in solution 
with propylene glycol (CIS) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872561] [ADDRESS_1219003] 
transplant (Group A) or lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872561] [ADDRESS_1219004] transplant (Group B) who 
have been diagnosed with biopsy proven bronchiolitis obliterans or Bronchiolitis Obliterans 
Syndrome.  The primary endpoint of each study group is FEV [ADDRESS_1219005] 1 week apart, no more than two 
weeks apart.  Subjects who cannot tolerate the medication (at least 150mg dose), have disease 
progression (beginning at week 9) as defined by a 20% or more decline in FEV [ADDRESS_1219006] 2 weeks apart or require >25% increase in one or more existing 
immunosuppressive agents or the addition of new systemic immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_872562]. As of Amendment M, lung transplant patients 
are no longer being enrolled on this protocol.

6.0  TREATMENT PLAN 
 
6.1 Pre-treatment Medication (albuterol)  
 
Subjects will receive metered dose inhaler albuterol, [ADDRESS_1219014] of 
albuterol or not receive pre-treatment.  
6.1.1 Inhalation device:  Subjects will be instructed regarding the use of the inhalation device as 
follows:   
x Shake the inhaler well. 
x Breathe out as completely as possible through your mouth. 
x Hold the canister with the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_730183], facing you and the canister pointing 
upward.  Place the open end of the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_709398].  Close your lips tightly 
around the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. 
x Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959].  At the same time, press down once 
on the container to spray the medication into your mouth. 
x Try to hold your breath for 10 seconds, remove the inhaler, and breathe out slowly.  
x Wait 10 minutes before beginning cyclosporine nebulizer treatment. 
 
6.1.2 Nebulizer: Subjects will be instructed regarding the use of the nebulizer device as follows: 
x Before treatment, wash your hands with soap and water and dry completely. 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 16 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD x Place the air compressor on a sturdy surface that will support its weight.  Plug the cord 
from the compressor into a properly grounded (three-prong) electrical outlet. 
x Carefully measure medications exactly as you have been instructed and put them into the 
nebulizer cup. 
x Assemble the nebulizer cup and mask or mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. 
x Connect the tubing to both the aerosol comp ressor and nebulizer cup (with filter if 
beginning treatment with cyclosporine). 
x Turn on the compressor to make sure it is working correctly.  You should see a light mist 
coming from the back of the tube opposite the mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959]. 
x Sit up straight on a comfortable chair.  If the treatment is for your child, he or she may sit 
on your lap.  If you are using a mask, position it comfortably and securely on you or your 
child's face.  If you are using a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_13959], pl ace it between you or your child's teeth and 
seal the lips around it. 
x Take slow, deep breaths. 
x Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (an average of 10 minutes for 
albuterol).  The nebulizer will make a sputtering noise, and the cup will have just a little 
medication remaining. 
x If dizziness or jitteriness occurs, stop the treatment and rest for about 5 minutes.  Continue 
the treatment, and try to breathe more slowly.  If dizziness or jitteriness continues to be a 
problem with future treatments, inform your doctor. 
x During the treatment, if the medication sticks to the sides of the nebulizer cup, you may 
shake the cup to loosen the droplets. 
x After each treatment, rinse the nebulizer cup thoroughly with warm water, shake off excess 
water, and let air-dry. 
x Wait 10 minutes before beginning cyclosporine nebulizer treatment. 
6.1.3 Concomitant Medications of Concern with albuterol  (concurrent use will be per PI 
[INVESTIGATOR_730184])  Subjects will be queried as to what prescription 
medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products they are taking, or have 
stopped taking within the past two weeks as medication dose adjustments may be required or subjects carefully monitored for side effects with the following medications: 
x beta blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin), labetalol (Normodyne), metoprolol (Lopressor, 
Toprol XL), nadolol (Corgard), and propranolol (Inderal); digoxin (Lanoxin); diuretics; epi[INVESTIGATOR_238] (Epi[INVESTIGATOR_130530], Primatene Mist); other inhale d medications used to relax the air passages 
such as metaproterenol (Alupent) and leval buterol (Xoponex); and medications for colds 
x antidepressants such as amitriptyline (Elavil), amoxapi[INVESTIGATOR_050] (Asendin), clomipramine 
(Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), doxepin (Adapin, Sinequan), imipramine (Tofranil), 
nortriptyline (Aventyl, Pamelor), protriptyline (Vivactil), and trimipramine (Surmontil); 
and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, including isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine 
(Nardil), selegiline (Eldepryl, Emsam), and tranylcypromine (Parnate). 
 
6.1.4   Subjects will also be instructed to discontinue albuterol and notify the research team 
immediately if they: 
x become pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 17 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD x experience severe wheezing and difficulty breathing immediately after it is inhaled. 
 6.1.5   Subjects will be instructed not to administer the albuterol and /or study drug on the day of 
assessments, as the albuterol and/or CsA may complicate the interpretation of the pulmonary function testing.  
 
6.2 Study Drug (Aerosolized Cyclosporine A in solution with Propylene glycol) Administration 
 
6.2.1   Treatment plan: 
 
Week 1:  Subjects will receive aerosolized cyclosporine A in solution with propylene glycol using a 
Sidestream nebulizer with the Invacare Mobilaire compressor at [ADDRESS_1219015] week, 
subjects will receive 150 mg (total volume 2.4 ml), [ADDRESS_1219016] supervision of the research team.  An individualized maximum tolerated dose may be 
recommended.  Pediatric dosing  per APT recommendation:  During the first week, subjects will 
receive 150 mg (total volume 2.4 ml), 3 times weekly.  Subjects may not initiate aerosolized 
cyclosporine based on the results of the bronchoscopy, at the discretion of the PI. 
  
 Weeks 2-5:  Subjects (adults and pediatric) will con tinue self administration of aerosolized 
cyclosporine A in solution with propylene glycol 150 mg (total volume 2.4 ml), 3 times weekly.  A 
member of the study team will periodically (during weeks 2 – 5) call the subjects to discuss any 
concerns or issues related to study drug administration.  
 
 Weeks 6-8:  Subjects will  undergo a dose escalation to 300 mg inhalation dose (total volume 4.8ml) 
three times weekly.  This is the dose that has been used previously in lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872563] (8).  During dose escalation, subjects will be monitored under direct supervision of the 
research team.  If a subject is unable to tolerate the dose escalation, they will be able to continue at 
the 150mg dose given three times per week or 125mg (total volume 2.0 mL) daily . 
Pediatric dosing  per APT recommendation: 
 Weight ≥ 35 Kg dose at 300 mg (total volume 4.8ml three times weekly).  
Weight < 35 Kg dose at 200 mg (total volume 3.2 ml three times weekly).  If the subject weighs 
less than 35 Kg and is unable to tolerate the dose escalation to 200 mg they can continue at 150 
mg three times weekly or 85 mg (total volume 1.36 mL) daily. 
 
 Weeks 9-18:   Continued dosing will be dependent on response and tolerance.   Formal PFTs 
performed at NIH will be obtained to determine respon se to treatment.  Subjects will continue at the 
300mg inhalation dose (total volume 4.6ml) three times weekly or maximally tolerated dose. 
 
 Any subject that demonstrates disease progression (beginning at week 9) as defined by a 20% or 
more decline in FEV [ADDRESS_1219017] 2 weeks apart, or >25% increase in 
existing or addition of new immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (sustained for 3 weeks, excluding 
adjustments made for target drug levels), above baseline levels, due to worsening symptoms related to BOS, will be categorized as a treatment failure and will discontinue study drug administration and 
proceed with end of study drug assessment.  For all others, study drug administration will end at 
week 19 assessment. 
 Deviation plan for a missed dose:  Subjects will be treated with CIS three times weekly ideally on 
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the week.  Should a subject miss a scheduled dose of CIS, we will attempt to alter the dosing regimen for that week so that the subject will still receive three doses 
of CIS over a week with a limit of 1 dose per day.  Data will be captured and reported for subjects 
who deviate from the treatment plan. 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 18 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD  
Medication Holds:  During study participation, subjects may be instructed to hold administration of 
CIS after development of an adverse event or other reason at the discretion of the PI.  Information 
pertaining to the reason for and the duration of the medication hold will be captured in the subjects’  
medical record.  If study drug is held for more than 7 days, the time of the hold will not be counted 
towards the overall study week count.  Study drug can be held for up to 12 weeks.  
6.2.2   Special Instructions Regarding the Admi nistration of Aerosolized Cyclosporine A 
  
Subjects will follow nebulizer instructions (section 6.1.2) with the following instructions specific to 
CsA:  Continue the treatment until the medication is gone (approx. 20-30 minutes for cyclosporine). 
 
A new nebulizer should be used after albuterol admi nistration.  Aerosolized CsA is provided in single 
use vials.  Any CsA remaining in the vial after administration should be discarded immediately. 
 
Aerosolized CsA should be administered such as to avoid others being exposed to CsA during the 
inhalation process. 
 Subjects will be given a medication log and asked to record their CIS administration on the log.  
Subjects will be encouraged to capture this information, but failure to comply with this request will 
not be reported as a protocol deviation. 
 
 6.2.[ADDRESS_1219018] Transplant Medications:  Subjects that require an increase in existing immunosuppressive meds 
by 25% due to worsening BOS symptoms (sustained for 3 weeks, excluding adjustments made for 
target drug levels) or need addition of new im munosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014] (sustained for 3 weeks), 
above baseline levels, due to worsening lung disease or BOS symptoms after week [ADDRESS_1219019]’s other manifestations of GVHD.  Attempts will be made to taper prednisone 
first, before other systemic immunosuppressants.  Prednisone will be decreased by 25% at the first 
taper.  Subsequent tapers will be at the discretion of the PI.  Lung transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872564]. 
 
Subjects that have improvement or stabilization of FEV
1, are not on prednisone, and are only on 
calcineurin inhibitors, will have their steady state calcineurin inhibitor (systemic cyclosporine or 
tacrolimus) dose tapered at the discretion of the PI.  The calcineurin inhibitor dose will be decreased 
by 25% at the first taper.  Subsequent tapers will be at the discretion of the PI. 
  
Lung Infection Prophylaxis : 
Lung infection prophylaxis will be at the discretion of the PI, taking into account the patient’s other 
concomitant medications and medical history. The following are guidelines: 
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 19 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD x For PCP pneumonia prophylaxis, subjects will take Bactrim, one double strength tablet 
(800/160mg) orally three times weekly or aerosolized pentamidine 300mg every four 
weeks by [CONTACT_12699]. 
 
x For antiviral prophylaxis, subjects will receive acyclovir 800 mg twice daily.  Pediatric 
subjects less than 40kgs will receive acyclovir 20mg/kg po twice daily to a maximum dose 
of 800mg twice daily. 
 
x For antibacterial prophylaxis, subjects will receive penicillin 500mg twice daily or for 
penicillin allergic patients, azithromycin 250mg daily. 
 
x Subjects who are already on adequate, alternative prophylaxis agents prescribed by [CONTACT_872591]. 
 
6.2.4 Concomitant Medications of Concern with CsA (concurrent use will be per PI [INVESTIGATOR_872565])  
 
x Due to potential for drug interactions, other short acting sympathominetic aerosolized 
bronchodilators, beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents, digoxin, monoamine oxidase 
inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressant s will be allowed per PI [INVESTIGATOR_9106]. 
    
x Due to the potential for compromising the primary endpoint, subjects requiring an increase in 
systemic immunosuppression or who initiate new immunosuppressive agents, such as oral 
tacrolimus, CSA, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or azathioprine due to 
symptoms of GVHD  not involving the lung, will remain on study and will have concurrent 
use of these medications carefully tracked and accounted for during and at the end of study 
data analysis. 
 
x Cyclosporine can interfere with or be affected by [CONTACT_730238]3A4 enzyme. As such, patients who are taking medications, which are either substrates for inducers of, or inhibitors of CYP3A4 (i.e. oral cyclosporine) will be closely 
monitored (see appendix c).

8.0 ASSESSMENT TOOLS and PROCEDURES 
Other than the pre-study evaluations to determine eligibility/baseline status and subsequent PFTs 
used to guide therapy, subjects will be able to refuse any radiologic test or bronchoscopy procedure unless clinically indicated.  
8.[ADDRESS_1219021] breathes into a mouthpi[INVESTIGATOR_730193] a recording device (spi[INVESTIGATOR_14007]).  The 
information collected by [CONTACT_96945][INVESTIGATOR_730194] a chart called a spi[INVESTIGATOR_244916].  The 
more common lung function values measured used to assess the subjects on this trial will include: 
Forced vital capacity (FVC) .  This measures the amount of air you can exhale with force after 
you inhale as deeply as possible. 
Forced expi[INVESTIGATOR_12194] (FEV) .  This measures the amount of air you can exhale with force 
in one breath.  The amount of air you exhale may be measured at 1 second (FEV 1). 
Peak expi[INVESTIGATOR_10229] (PEF) .  This measures how quickly you can exhale.  It is usually 
measured at the same time as your forced vital capacity (FVC). 
Total lung capacity (TLC) .  This measures the amount of air in your lungs after you inhale as 
in your lungs after a normal exhale (FRC) and the amount after you exhale with force (RV). 
Maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) . This measures the greatest amount of air you can 
breathe in and out during one minute. 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 27 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD Exhaled Nitric Oxide.   This measures the amount of nitric oxide in your breath after 
exhalation.  This will be performed in a subset of subjects based on the availability of testing 
staff and scheduling. 
Lung Volumes using Nitrogen Washout.  This measures the total lung capacity and provides an 
estimate of residual volume of the lung. 
Diffusing Capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO ).  This measures the ability of the 
lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capi[INVESTIGATOR_11037]. 
Peak Flow Measurements:  Subjects will be given a home peak flow meter that will measure their 
peak flow and FEV1.  The results will be recorded, and subjects will be given a level below which 
they should call the research team.  Subjects with a decline in peak flow of >20% compared to 
pretreatment baseline will be instructed to return  to the NIH for formal pulmonary function testing 
and clinical evaluation.  Subjects will be encouraged to perform peak flow testing daily, however, 
failure to perform peak flow measurements will  not be considered a protocol deviation. .  
8.2 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and Biopsy 
 
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a medical proced ure in which a bronchoscope is passed through 
the mouth or nose into the lungs and fluid is squirted into a small part of the lung and then 
recollected for examination.  A BAL sample (minimal 30 mL) will be obtained from upper and 
lower lobes using conventional techniques prior to initiating CIS as well as at the end of the week 9 and 18 assessments.  The following research investigations will be performed: Gram stain, routine 
cultures, Luminex cytokine arrays, flow Cytometr y, gene expression profiles, examination of 
proliferative, cytotoxic, and apoptotic response of BAL lymphocytes to [ADDRESS_1219022] scanner.  However, imaging parameters are chosen so 
as to maximize spatial resolution: 
x A narrow slice width is used (usually 1-2 mm) 
x A high spatial resolution image reconstruction algorithm is used 
x Field of view is minimized, so as to minimize the size of each pi[INVESTIGATOR_8070] 
x Other scan factors (e.g. focal spot) may be optimized for resolution at the expense of scan 
speed 
The aim of performing a HRCT is to assess generalized lung disease.  As such the test is 
conventionally performed by [CONTACT_872593] 10-[ADDRESS_1219023] 
(soft tissue against air).

Version 16 (Amendment N) 28 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD The six-minute walk test is generally used at the start of a Pulmonary Rehabilitation program 
and/or in the evaluation of lung transplant and will be used in this study to evaluate the primary 
endpoint, which is change in BO status.  The object of this test is to walk on a flat surface such as a 
hallway for [ADDRESS_1219025].  Oxygen saturation will be taken during the walk.  Subjects will be asked to assess their breathing status using a 0-10 scale. 
 Subjects will be  instructed to: 
x Wear comfortable clothing 
x Wear shoes that are comfortable to walk in, such as tennis shoes. 
x Take their medications as prescribed. 
x Eat a light meal before early morning or early afternoon tests. 
x Not to exercise vigorously within [ADDRESS_1219026]. 
 
8.5 Quality of Life Measurements  
Participants sixteen years and older that speak English will perform self-report questionnaires using 
the SF36, Human Activity Profile (HAP), Chronic Respi[INVESTIGATOR_282095]-
Administered Standardized CRQ-SAS), and GVHD questionnaire.  These assessments will occur at 
baseline, [ADDRESS_1219027]-reported outcomes. 
x The HAP is a 94-item questionnaire that assesses the frequency with which individuals 
perform common activities. 
x  The CRQ-SAS is a 20-item questionnaire that assesses dyspnea, fatigue, emotional 
functioning, and mastery. 
x The GVHD questionnaire (PBSC transplant subjects, group A) designed by [CONTACT_872594] a 30-item symptom scale with seven subscales to capture cGVHD symptom burden. 
9.[ADDRESS_1219028].  Lung deposition studies will be conducted and reviewed by [CONTACT_872595]. 
9.1 Sample Collection:  During the course of participating on this study (screening appointment, 6, 9, 
12, 15, and 18 week visits) blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples will be collected for correlative laboratory research studies.  
Version 16 (Amendment N) 29 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD 9.2 Intended Use:  These specimens will not be used for diagnostic purposes.  Studies conducted on 
these samples will not be used in assessing the primary endpoint but are undertaken for secondary 
endpoints (Tissue pathogenesis of BO as detailed below) and/or exploratory ancillary research, 
which are approved by [CONTACT_730242] B of the protocol. As these tests are 
being performed for secondary or exploratory purposes, failure to obtain the tests will not be 
considered a protocol deviation.  
9.2.1  Multiplex Cytokine Arrays  
Biopsies, BAL, and peripheral blood samples will be prepared for multiplex cytokine array 
analysis. Multiplex bead arrays allow one to independently and quantitatively assay multiple 
analytes simultaneously in small volumes of material.  
 
9.2.2  Flow Cytometry  
 BAL and peripheral blood samples will be prepared for analysis using flow cytometry. 
Samples will be analyzed for T cell, NK cell and neutrophils expression. 
 
9.2.3  Gene Expression Profiling 
BAL, and peripheral blood samples will be prepared for the gene array analysis.  
Specifically, arrays focused on Apoptosis, Dend ritic cells/Antigen Presentation, Cytokines, 
and Chemokines/Adhesion Molecules will be used.  The use of smaller, more focused arrays 
decreases statistical problems associated with multiple testing and simplifies data analysis.  
Most interesting and significant findings will be validated by [CONTACT_730243]. 
 
9.2.4  Pharmacokinetic Studies  
All pediatric subjects and 20 adult subjects will be asked to participate in this portion of the 
study:  from group A:  5 PBSC transplant subjects that are not on oral cyclosporine, and 5 
PBSC transplant subjects that are on oral cyclosporine and from group B: 10 lung transplant 
subjects. 
 
For all subjects, 2ml of blood will be collected at the following approximate time points after 
administration of inhaled cyclosporine: 0 (prior  to), immediately after, [ADDRESS_1219029] administration of inhaled cyclosporine: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 
and [ADDRESS_1219030] undergone the dose escalation.  On the days that the pharmacokinetic study is performed, oral cyclosporine will be taken on an 
empty stomach and no food will be consumed for 4 hours after drug administration.
  For all 
other administration, oral  cyclosporine should be taken on a consistent schedule with relation 
to meals and time of day to avoid significant changes in absorption. 
 
9.2.5  Pharmacogenetic Analysis 
For some subjects who participate in the pharmacokinetic study, a single 7 mL EDTA blood 
sample will be collected at baseline for pharmacogenetic analysis.  For some stem cell transplant recipi[INVESTIGATOR_872567].  Genotypes for drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters will be determined 
using PCR-based methods and correlated with pharmacokinetic parameters.

July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD 9.2.[ADDRESS_1219031]/CT imaging will be performed.  The lung deposition studies will be repeated again at 9 weeks in a subset of subjects.  
9.3 Storage:   Research specimens will be stored in the laboratories of [CONTACT_106663] (NHLBI) 
and/or [CONTACT_607608] (Clinical Center/C ritical Care Medicine Department) under the care 
and supervision of the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_37105].  All laboratory personnel with access to 
samples or subject information will complete the NIH online course in Protection of Human 
Subjects.  Efforts to ensure protection of subject information include: 
x The laboratory is located in a controlled access building and laboratory doors are kept 
locked at all times.  Visitors to the laborato ry are required to be accompanied by [CONTACT_138760]. 
x Hard copy records or electronic copi[INVESTIGATOR_872568]. 
x An electronic database is used to store information related to subject samples processed by 
[CONTACT_25699]. 
x All samples collected will be assigned a unique code. 
x Vials holding subject samples are labeled with the sequential laboratory accession ID 
number that does not contain any personal identifier information. 
x Samples will be stored until they are no longer of scientific value or until the subject 
withdraws consent, at which time they will be destroyed. 
x If a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, their sample will be destroyed. 
 
Tracking:   Samples will be ordered and tracked through the CRIS Research Screens.  Should a 
CRIS screen not be available, the NIH form 2803-[ADDRESS_1219032].  Samples will not be sent outside NIH without IRB 
notification and an executed MTA.  
 
9.4 End of study procedures :  Samples from consenting subjects will be stored until they are no 
longer of scientific value or if a subject withdraws consent for their continued use, at which time 
they will be destroyed.  
 
9.5 Loss or destruction of samples :  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan for 
tracking and storage of samples has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
 
10.0 BIOSTATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 10.1 Primary and secondary endpoints  
  
The primary objective is to assess the safety and efficacy of inhaled aerosolized cyclosporine A 
solution in hematopoietic (group A) and lung tran splant patients (group B) with bronchiolitis 
obliterans (BO) or BO syndrome (BOS).  The primary endpoint of each study group is FEV
[ADDRESS_1219033] 
1 week apart, no more than two weeks apart. 
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 31 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD Criteria for response:   
For subjects with progressive disease at study entry,(subjects with a documented decline ( ≥10%) in 
FEV 1 within 18 weeks of study enrollment), improvement in BO is defined as an FEV 1 increase 
≥10% compared to baseline and stabilization of BO is defined as less than 10% increase to less 
than 10% decline in FEV 1 as compared to baseline. 
 For subjects with stable disease (active BOS, stable by [CONTACT_10266]
1 criteria) at study entry (a stable FEV 1 , 
increase < 5% and decrease < 10% within the 18 weeks preceding study enrollment), improvement 
in BO is defined as an FEV 1 increase ≥ 10%compared to baseline and stabilization of BO is 
defined as less than 10% increase to less than 10% decline in FEV 1 with a minimum 25% decrease 
in the dose of one or more systemic immunosuppres sive drugs(assessed at week 18, sustained for 3 
weeks, excluding adjustments made for target drug levels) while being treated with CIS.  Subjects 
with stable BO at study entry that have less than a 10% increase to less than a 10% decline in FEV [ADDRESS_1219034] 1 
week after 18 week assessment.  The average of these two measurements will be used for 
assessment of response. 
 The treatment will be considered successful in each cohort if there is a more than 30% 
improvement or stabilization.  Adverse events associated with the treatment will also be assessed. 
(Please see the table below) 
 
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess  the lung deposition and pharmacokinetics of 
this CSA preparation, the inflammatory pathways that lead to the development of bronchiolitis 
obliterans and the anti-inflammatory effects of this CSA preparation ex vivo and in vivo.  
Secondary endpoints  will be measured in the laboratory us ing the results of multiplex cytokine 
arrays, flow cytometry and gene expression profiling from peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar 
lavage samples, lung deposition studies and pharmacokinetic studies.  Secondary endpoints will 
also include changes in the six-minute walk tests, high-resolution chest CT images, and quality of 
life measurements.  
 
We will evaluate response for group A and group B subjects separately, in order to assess if the 
treatment is effective in each disease.

10.2  Sample size 
 
For each study group, we determine the sample size using the Two-Stage Minimax Design of 
Simon (1989)20.  We test the null hypothesis that the proportion of subjects that respond to therapy 
(improvement or stabilization) is 0.[ADDRESS_1219035] the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of 
subjects that respond to therapy (improvement or stabilization) is 0.5 or more.  With alpha = 0.05 
and 80% power, a maximum of [ADDRESS_1219036] 17 of 39 subjects respond we will consider this treatment successful.  Once again, this may happen before 
all 39 subjects are accrued.  A 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects improving or 
stabilizing will be given.  Based on the sample size of the study, the two-sided confidence interval 
will be obtained with the binomial exact method or the normal approximation, if appropriate.  We 
will test our null hypothesis (that the proportion of response is 0.3 or less) formally using the 
confidence interval approach.  If the lower 95% limit of the confidence interval is greater than 0.3, 
we will conclude the null hypothesis is rejected and the study treatment is successful.  If the lower 95% limit of the confidence is less than 0.3, we will not reject the null hypothesis. 
 
Subjects who are unable to tolerate a dose escalation to [ADDRESS_1219037] two weeks will be included in the primary analysis.  Subjects who will be 
considered treatment failures include: 1) those who develop progression of baseline BO (>20% decline in FEV1) during the 18 week 
course of the study  
2) those who are deemed to have progressed at the end of study as evidenced by [CONTACT_106491]1 decline ≥ 
10%  
3) subjects who require increases in existing or addition of new immunosuppressive therapi[INVESTIGATOR_872569] (sustained for 3 weeks, excluding adjustments made for 
target drug levels) after week 9  
4) subjects with BO or BOS who had stable disease (active BOS, stable by [CONTACT_10266]
1 criteria) at study 
entry and are deemed to have a stable FEV 1 , increase < 10% and decrease < 10% at the end of 
study, with less than a 25% reduction in one or more systemic immunosuppressive medications (sustained for 3 weeks, excluding adjustments made for target drug levels) while receiving CIS. 
 5) subjects that aren’t able to tolerate the 150mg dose for more than two weeks.  
 
All subjects who begin treatment will be included in the primary analysis, except those subjects

before the time when the primary endpoint is eval uated will be considered as a non-responder.  
Every effort will be made to reach and evaluate the subjects at the 6 week, 9 week, 12 week, 15 
week, 18, and 19 week end of intervention period.  Adverse events will be tabulated by [CONTACT_872596] (lung versus hematopoietic).  For se condary endpoints, especially, the endpoints that 
were measured at multiple times such as 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, [ADDRESS_1219039] been archived for analysis.  We will use stratified analyses to account 
for effects of systemic immunosuppressive agents and other prognostic factors. 
 
Secondary endpoints (such as change of 6 minute walk and the quality of life, etc) will be studies 
by [CONTACT_872597], multiple regression, logistic regression and nonparametric regression models, if deemed appropriate. 
 
Pharmacokinetic analysis  
Inhaled cyclosporine pharmacokinetics will be determined by [CONTACT_105]-compartmental or 
compartmental analysis using WINNOLIN (Pharsight, Mountain View, CA) or other software as appropriate.  For subjects who are administered bo th oral and inhaled cyclosporine, concentrations 
will be analyzed using the superposition principle.  Parameters estimated will include but not 
limited to eliminate rate constant, volume of distribution, and area under the concentration versus 
time curve. 
 
10.4 Stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_872570] a specified set of treatment related 
serious adverse events (TRSAEs) during the 18 weeks of intervention does not substantially exceed 
an anticipated rate.  The following TRSAEs will be considered for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_730198] A or B: 
 
 Death considered to be probably or definitely related to the inhaled CsA or 
 Any grade IV toxicity considered to be probably or definitely related to inhaled CsA, i.e. 
opportunistic infection such as tissue-invasive CMV or Pneumocystis carinii , with 
exception of temporary cytopenias. 
 
We will monitor the numbers of subjects who have developed any of the above specified TRSAEs 
using the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_730199].  The trial will be seriously considered for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_872571]-specified threshold value 
in the Table. 
 From experience using this agent in other clinical se ttings as detailed in the investigator’s brochure, 
we anticipate the rate of developi[INVESTIGATOR_872572] 10% or less.

We investigated the performance of the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_730204] a simulation study.  For the stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877], we generated a study with 39 independent Bernoulli trials, each had a probability 
p=.1 for having the above TRSAE and q=1-p for not having such TRSAE and compared the 
TRSAE outcomes with the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_106559].  
We repeated the simulation 100,000 times and comput ed the proportion of stopped studies (i.e. 
“number of stopped studies”/100,000), which were st opped using the above stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_1877].  
 
The following table summarizes the proportions of stopped studies under a number of scenarios.

of withdrawing will be discussed, as will alternative treatment options.  Those subjects who choose 
to withdraw will be strongly encouraged to participate in study assessments until he/she initiates 
alternative BO therapy. In this scenario, patients  will be deemed off study-drug, but have the option 
to continue on-study.

password protected electronic system and ensuring data accuracy, consistency and timeliness.  The 
principal investigator, associate investigators, research nurses and/or a contracted data manager 
will assist with the data management efforts.  Data will be abstracted from Clinical Center progress 
notes as well as from progress notes forwarded from home physicians.  Laboratory data from NIH 
will be imported electronically from CRIS into an in-house clinical trial database.  Laboratory 
values from referring home physicians will be entered into the system. 
 
In order to maintain subject confidentiality , all case report forms, study reports and 
communications relating to the study will identify su bjects by [CONTACT_872599].  Case 
report forms may serve as source data if needed.  All human subjects personally identifiable 
information (PII) as defined in accordance to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability, 
eligibility and consent verification will be recorded.  Primary data obtained during the conduct of the protocol will be kept in secure network drives or in approved alternative sites that comply with 
NIH security standards.  Primary and final analyzed data will have identifiers so that research data 
can be attributed to an individual human subject participant, e.g., a unique code, or minimum PII 
required for subject identification.  All primary and analyzed data will be located on the secure P 
drive. 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 37 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD In accordance with local and federal regulations, the Investigator will allow APT Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. personnel or their designee, access to all per tinent medical records in order to verify the data 
gathered on the case report forms and to audit the data collection process.  The US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) may also request access  to all study records, including source 
documentation for inspection. 
 
End of Study Procedures :  Data will be stored in locked cabinets and in a password protected 
database until it is no longer of scientific value.  Federal law requires that an Investigator maintain 
all study records for the indication under investigat ion for two years following the date a Product 
Licensing Application is approved or, if no application is to be filed or if the application is not 
approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and the FDA is 
notified.  The results will be posted to clinicaltrials.gov. 
 
Loss or Destruction of Data :  Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
 
Source Documentation:  Clinical data entered onto the Case Report Form (CRF) may serve as 
source documentation.  
 
Clinical Trial Monitoring Plan:  Monitoring Responsible Party/ Monitor:  An experienced 
independent protocol monitoring group has been co ntracted by [CONTACT_15792].  They will objectively 
audit records for compliance with the protocol. 
 Monitoring will assure the adequate protection of human subjects, safety of subjects involved in 
clinical investigations and the integrity and quality of data.  The monitor/ responsible party for 
monitoring will be trained to perform monitoring activities. 
 
Monitoring may occur prior to the IRB approval of the study (protocol/ site initiation), routine monitoring (during the protocol life cycle), and study termination.  The monitoring activities will 
verify regulatory compliance, NIH & DIR policy compliance, IRB regulatory compliance, subject 
record review, and protocol compliance.  The monitoring activities will be documented and the 
reports will be made available to regulatory personnel.

12.2 Assessment of Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Treatment 
 
The AEs will be graded by [CONTACT_107695] 4.0.  A copy of the criteria can be down-
loaded from the CTEP home page at http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html .  The category that 
overall best "fits" the relationship between the adverse event and the study drug should be chosen 
and recorded on the CRF and SAE form, if appropriate. 
 The investigator is responsible for assessing the causal relationship between any events and the 
study treatment.  AEs will be attributed as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, probably, or definitely 
related to study medication or procedures.  Additionally, the investigator is responsible for 
providing appropriate treatment for the event and for adequately following the event until 
resolution.  
 
Relationship Between Treatment and AE 
   
Unrelated  No temporal association to study product.  
An alter nate etiology has been established.  
The event does not follow the known pattern of response to study product.
 
The event does not reappear or worsen with re-challenge.  
Probably not  
related / remote  No temporal association to study product.  
Event could readily be produced by [CONTACT_730247], environmental or 
other interventions.  
The event does not follow the known pattern of response to study 
product.  
The event does not reappear or worsen with re-challenge.  
Possibly related  Reasonable temporal relationship to study product.  
The event is not readily produced by [CONTACT_730247], environmental, or 
other interventions.  
The event follows a known pattern of response to the study product or as yet unknown pattern of response.
 
Probably related  There is a reasonable temporal association with the study product.  
The event is not readily produced by [CONTACT_730247], environmental, or 
other interventions.  
The event follows a known pattern of response to the study product.  
The event decreases with de-challenge.  
Definitely related  There is a reasonable temporal relationship to the study product.  
The event is not readily produced by [CONTACT_730247], environmental, or other interventions.
 
The event follows a known pattern of response to the study product.  
The event decreases with de-challenge and recurs with re-challenge.  
 
 
 
 
Treatment related SAEs (TRSAEs)  are those attributed as possibly, probably or definitely.  As 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 39 11-H-0068

probably or definitely related to CIS will be monitored and considered for early stoppi[INVESTIGATOR_503177]. 
 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059] (overnight admission) for routine s upportive care (platelet or RBC transfusions) or 
admission from the NIH inpatient unit to the NIH ICU for routine monitoring will not be reported as a serious adverse event.  
 
 
APT Pharmaceuticals, Inc. :  A listing of all SAEs will be submitted to APT pharmaceutical 
quarterly.  Safety reports will be reported as detailed in section 12.5. 
 
12.4 IND Safety Reporting to the FDA (IND 109,707) 
 
Because this study will be conducted under an IND, U.S. Government regulations 21CFR, Part 
312.32 require the issuance of an IND Safety Report to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
for all “serious” adverse events that are “unexpected” and for which there is a “reasonable 
possibility that the experience may have been c aused by [CONTACT_33641].”  Such serious events that are 
characterized as fatal or life-threatening must be reported to the FDA within 7 calendar days of the 
sponsor’s initial receipt of the information, whereas non -fatal and non-life threatening events must 
be reported within [ADDRESS_1219047] label, the underlying  disease states, or the study procedures. 
The Safety report will contain a full written summary detailing relevant aspects of the serious 
adverse events in question.  In each written IND sa fety report, all safety reports previously filed 
with the IND concerning a similar adverse experien ce will be included and the significance of the 
adverse experience in light of the previous, similar reports will be discussed. 
Where applicable, information from relevant hospi[INVESTIGATOR_730209].  The investigator will always provide an as sessment of causality at the time of the initial 
report as described in ‘Assessment of Causality’.  
 
Follow up information  regarding the subject’s subsequent course will be submitted until the SAE 
has resolved, the subject’s condition stabilizes (in the case of persistent impairment ) or the subject 
dies. 
 
12.5 Sponsor’s Reporting Responsibilities  
 
Serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions (S[LOCATION_003]Rs) as defined in 21 CFR 312.32 and 
determined by [CONTACT_872600].  The Sponsor will also 
submit an IND Annual Report of the progress of the investigation to the FDA as defined in 21 CFR 
312.33.  
 Telephone and facsimile transmission safety reports.   The sponsor shall also notify IRB, DSMB 
and FDA by [CONTACT_704881]-threatening 
experience associated with the use of the drug  as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 
calendar days after our initial receipt of the information.  
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 40 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD Hard copy submission of safety reports:   Each notification will be made as soon as possible and in 
no event later than 7 calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information. 
 
If an adverse drug experience not initially de termined to be reportable is later determined 
reportable, a written safety report will be submitted as soon as possible, but in no event later than 7 
calendar days after the determination is made.

12.6 Reporting of pregnancy 
 
Subjects who become pregnant during the study will discontinue the study medication immediately.  The investigator, or his/her designee, will collect pregnancy information on any 
subject who becomes pregnant while participating in  this study and submit this information to APT 
and the IRB within two weeks of learning of a subj ect’s pregnancy.  Information on the status of 
the mother and fetus will be forwarded to APT and the IRB as available.  While pregnancy itself is 
not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication, spontaneous abortion, or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be reported to APT in an SAE format.  
Generally, follow-up will be no longer than [ADDRESS_1219049] the population may be distributed as follows:  
 
x By [CONTACT_547]: 40% females; 60% males

x By [CONTACT_545]: 45% Black, 55% White 
 
Recruitment:  Subjects will be recruited from NIH Clinical Center hematopoietic stem cell 
transplant clinics and from the Lung transpla nt center at the University of Maryland. 
 
Competition with other Branch protocols : None.  However, there is an actively accruing 
protocol at the Clinical Center 08-C-0097: A Mu lti-Institutional Prospective Phase II Study of 
Montelukast for the Treatment of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Following Allogeneic Stem Cell 
Transplantation in Children and Adults.  They will refer subjects to our study that have 
completed/failed their protocol.  
 
Reimbursement for protocol participation, travel, food, and lodging  will be consistent with 
NIH guidelines.  In determining reimbursement, the following factors are considered applicable to 
this protocol:  the patients are diagnosed with a rare disease; the patient population is sick; the protocol offers the potential for direct benefit; the protocol regimen is demanding; and in order to 
complete accrual in a reasonable timeframe a geographically dispersed participant population is 
required.

received CIS under protocols ACS001, ACS002, ACS004, or CIS001.  In ACS001, the following 
adverse events occurred significantly more ofte n in subjects receiving CIS than in subjects 
receiving placebo: 
 
x Events that occurred in 30 to 50% of subjects receiving CIS: cough, chest pain, back pain, 
increased urinary frequency, pharyngitis, exacerbation of shortness of breath, and lung consolidation. 
 
x Events that occurred in 10 to 29 % of subjects receiving CIS:  cardiac murmur, respi[INVESTIGATOR_730213], polyuria, somnolence, hyperlipi[INVESTIGATOR_474236], respi[INVESTIGATOR_44447], and hemoptysis. 
In the studies that were not placebo controlled, or are as yet unblinded, the following adverse 
events were seen: 
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 42 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD 1. Events that occurred in greater than 10% of subjects: pyrexia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, 
cough, wheezing, chest pain, pharyngitis, renal impairment, peripheral edema, lung 
transplant rejection, headache, insomnia, and neutropenia. 
2. Events that occurred in 5 to 10% of subjects: Pharyngolaryngeal pain, pleural effusion, 
rhinorrhea, constipation, vomiting, fatigue, chest pain, candidiasis, pseudomonas infection, 
sinusitis, pneumonia, hyperkalemia, leucopenia, anemia, and hypertension. 
 
Although not previously observed, in the current study, one subject did develop a rib fracture 
associated with coughing. 
Unknown side effects:  In addition, as with other clinical studies using experimental medicines and 
in subjects with serious medical conditions, there may be adverse events or side effects that are currently unknown and certain of these unknown risks could be permanent, severe, or life 
threatening.  Subjects will therefore be carefully monitored and instructed to seek medical attention 
in the event of serve adverse events and contact [CONTACT_658001].   
 
During treatment, the study medication should be admi nistered in a private, well-ventilated area to 
minimize the risk of other people being unnecessarily exposed to the drug particles in the air.  
Pregnant women, children, and individuals with asthma or other diseases with significant respi[INVESTIGATOR_872577].

So far, use of CIS has not caused this problem in previous human research studies and should not 
increase this risk since blood levels have been very low 
 
APT Pharmaceuticals remains attentive to safety  throughout all ongoing studies.  Additional 
unexpected safety findings will be provided to investigators upon receipt and evaluation. 
  
13.3.2 Related to albuterol/levalbuterol 
 
Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling 
of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); chest pain; ear pain; fast or irregular heartbeat; new or 
worsened trouble breathing; pounding in the chest; red, swollen, blistered, or peeling skin; severe 
headache or dizziness; unusual hoarseness; wheezing.  Subjects will be instructed to discontinue 
albuterol/levalbuterol use, seek medical attenti on right away, and notify the research teams should 
any severe side effect occur. 
 
The most common side effects include:  Dizziness; headache; nausea; nervousness; sinus 
inflammation; sore or dry throat; tremor; trouble sleepi[INVESTIGATOR_007]; vomiting.

Version 16 (Amendment N) 43 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD  
Subjects will sign a separate procedure consent for the BAL which will further detail the potential 
risks of this procedure which include:  
 
x Mild discomfort due to coughing.  This can be controlled by [CONTACT_12523][INVESTIGATOR_73201]. 
 
x A decrease in the amount of oxygen in the blood.  Subjects will receive additional oxygen 
during the procedure and they will be closely monitored for oxygen levels, heart rate and blood pressure.  The risk of a serious problem occurring is very small (less than 1 out of 
10,000 procedures in published studies). 
 
x A slow or irregular heartbeat occurs (rare). If it does not correct itself, we can treat this 
with medication.  A heart rhythm monitor (elect rocardiograph) will be used throughout the 
procedure.  
 
x Mild bleeding from the nose can occur because the bronchoscope tube is sometimes placed 
through the nose to reach the large airways.  Placing medication and lubricant inside the nose will be done before the procedure to lower the risk of this occurring. 
 
x A sore throat for several hours after the procedure ( Less than 10% of subjects) 
 
x A bad reaction to the numbing medication (lidocaine), rarely.  Side effects can include 
confusion or, very rarely, seizures.  We have never seen this problem in over 1500 
bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_730214] 8-year 
period.  This potential problem is minimized by [CONTACT_730249], frequent doses of the 
medication.  
  
x Fever has been reported to develop in less than 5% of healthy volunteers six to eight hours 
after the bronchoscopy.  
 
x Infection in the lungs (very low risk) resulting from swallowing saliva into the lung 
airways.  To minimize this risk, subjects do not eat or drink for at least six hours before the 
bronchoscopy.   
 
x Pneumothorax can occur as a result of bronchoscopy, but is a very infrequent complication.  
It has been estimated that the risk of pneumothorax with trans-bronchial biopsy is between 
1-3%. 
 
x Individuals with lung disease may be at grea ter risk of complications from bronchoscopy, 
although bronchoscopi[INVESTIGATOR_872579]. 
 
x There are risks associated with the conscious sedation medicine.  These risks will be 
explained to the subjects and they will be consented separately at the time of the procedure.  
 
13.3.6  Related to the Lung Function Tests:   
 
These tests are very safe and side effects are unlikely.  During the test, subjects are asked to breathe 
deeply or rapi[INVESTIGATOR_872580] f lightheadedness or soreness of the chest.  In 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 44 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD extremely rare cases, this may result in the release of a small amount of air from the lung into the 
lung cavity, which would be treated appropriately.

relationship has been found for the genes we are testing.    Therefore the nature of the genetic 
testing (gene expression profiling studies) detailed in  the protocol will not put participants at any 
further risk.  
 
13.3.9 Related to Pregnancy and Nursing Mothers   
 The effects of albuterol and/or aerosolized cyclosporine A in solution with propylene glycol on the 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_19241]. For this reason and because it is unknown whether these 
drugs are teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) and for the duration 
of study participation.  If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant while on study, 
her treating physician should be informed immediately. Nursing mothers must be willing to 
discontinue nursing. 
 
13.3.10 Related to radiation exposure:  
 
x Related to the high resolution CT:   CT (computed tomography), sometimes called CAT 
scan, uses special x-ray equipment to obtain  image data from different angles around the 
body and then uses computer processing of the information to show a cross-section of body 
tissues and organs. Oral and/or intravenous contrast agents will NOT be used.   
 
x Related to the lung deposition studies:   Radioisotope tracer sulfur colloid will be inhaled 
along with the cyclosporine dissolved in propylene glycol for one treatment session.  This is generally well-tolerated.  Planar and SPECT/CT imaging will be performed to quantify the 
amount of drug deposited in the lungs and assess distribution. 
 
13.4 Risks in relation to benefits    
 13.4.1  For Adult Subjects  
The risks of participating in this trial are limited to side effects of the albuterol/levalbuterol and 
inhaled CsA, and the risks of standard diagnostic procedures (BAL and biopsy, the high resolution 
CT, and pulmonary function tests), the [ADDRESS_1219053] transplant 
care and therefore pose no additional burden or risk.  
The benefits to the subjects could be improvemen t in BO resulting in improved quality of life, 
decreased mortality associated with severe BO (should it develop), and potentially, treatment with 
other more toxic systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_106580].  Subjects will also receive 
direct health benefits due to thorough post transplant pulmonary examinations, early diagnosis of 
progression of BO and therefore earlier access to appropriate BO management. 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 45 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD  
Therefore, for adult subjects participating on this study, the research involves greater than minimal 
risk to subjects with the prospect of direct benefit (45 CFR 46.102 ). 
 
13.4.[ADDRESS_1219054], only if the IRB finds that: 
 (a)“The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk” . The risks of participating in this trial 
are limited to the side effects of the albuterol and inhaled CsA, the risks of standard diagnostic 
procedures (BAL and biopsy, the high resolution CT, the pulmonary function tests and the 6 
minute walk), lung deposition studies, and the additional peripheral blood sample to be used 
strictly for research purposes. Samples for clinical monitoring will be collected concurrently with samples that are part of their routine post transplant care.  Only those laboratory tests approved by 
[CONTACT_872601] (See Appendix B).  
 
(b) The relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is  at least as favorable to the subjects as that 
presented by [CONTACT_167899] . The risk associated with the monitoring that will be 
done on this ancillary protocol exceeds only minimally that would be done routinely in post 
transplant subjects who have developed BO.  This  risk is most favorable given that pediatric 
subjects could derive benefit in improvement in BO, resulting in improved quality of life, 
decreased mortality associated with severe BO (should it develop),  and avoidance of treatment 
with other more toxic systemic therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014].  Subjects  will also receive direct health benefits due to 
thorough post transplant pulmonary examinations, early diagnosis of BO progression, and therefore 
earlier access to appropriate BO management.  
 
(c) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children  and permission of their 
parents or guardians, as set forth in 46.408.  An assent is available. 
 
Therefore, the inclusion of children satisfies the cr iteria set forth in 45 Code of Federal Regulations 
46, Subpart D: 46.[ADDRESS_1219055] and when applicable the subjects’ 
parents.  The potential subject will be educated regarding the nature of the condition, proposed 
intervention, and outcome measures.  Study subjects will be informed that participation is entirely 
voluntary and that withdrawal from the study can be made at any time without penalty of benefits 
to which they may be entitled.  No consenting will be done by [CONTACT_730251]. 
 
At any time during participation in the protocol, if new information becomes available relating to 
risks, adverse events, or toxicities, this information will be provided orally or in writing to all 
enrolled or prospective subject participants.  Documentation will be provided to the IRB and if 
necessary the informed consent amende d to reflect relevant information. 
 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 46 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD Informed consent of non-English speaking research participants:  We anticipate the enrollment 
of Spanish-speaking research participants into our study. The IRB approved full consent document 
will be translated into that language in accordance with the Clinical MAS Policy M77-2. If there is 
an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for which there is no translated extant IRB 
approved consent document, the principal investigat or and or those authorized to obtain informed 
consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in MAS Policy M77-2, 45 CFR 
46.117 ( b) (2), and 21 CFR50.27 (b) (a) . The summary that will be used is the English version of 
the extant IRB approved consent document.  
We request prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form for up to a minimum of [ADDRESS_1219056] that consent document translated into the given inherent language.  
 
Minor subjects:   If the patient is a minor, a minor assent will be sought.  Where deemed 
appropriate by [CONTACT_15370], and the child's parent or guardian, the child will also be included in all 
discussions about the trial and a minor's assent will be obtained.  The parent who signs the consent 
for the minor must be a legally recognized parent or guardian.  The parent or guardian will sign on 
the designated line on the informed consent attesting to the fact that the child had given assent. When the assent is not age appropriate, the study will be explained to the child and the assent will 
be obtained verbally from the child.  Once the minor reaches 18, he/she will be consented for 
continued protocol participati on using the adult consent.  
 
Because this research holds a prospect of direct benefit to the health or well-being of pediatric participants and is available only in the context of the research, the assent of the pediatric 
participant is not a necessary condition for proceeding  with the research.  However, in the case of 
dissent, an independent pediatric care team (social worker and mental health specialist 
(psychologist or psychiatrist) will meet with the minor and his family to re-emphasize the 
importance of treatment on protocol; if the child continues to dissent, an ethics consult will be requested prior to enrollment. 
 
When a pediatric subject reaches age 18, continued participation will require re-consenting of the 
now adult with the standard protocol consent document to ensure legally effective informed 
consent has been obtained. Should sample or data analysis continue following completion of active participation and the subject has reached [ADDRESS_1219057].  
 
Requirements for Waiver of Consent consistent with 45 CFR 46.116 (d), each of which must be 
addressed in relation to the protocol: 
 
(1) The research involves no more than minimal risk to the subjects; 
a) Analysis of samples and data from this study  involves no additional risks to subjects. 
(2) The waiver or alteration will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of the subjects; 
a) Samples and data will be kept in secure locations in the laboratory of [CONTACT_99780]. 
Retention of samples or data does not affect the welfare of subjects. 
(3) The research could not practicably be carried out without the waiver or alteration; and 
Version 16 (Amendment N) 47 11-H-0068 
July 22, 2019  PI:  [INVESTIGATOR_872548], MD a) Considering the length of time between a minor’s enrollment and their age of majority, 
it is possible that more than a few subjects may be lost to follow up.  A significant 
reduction in the number of samples analyzed could impact the quality of the research. 
(4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with additional pertinent information after 
participation. 
a) We only plan to request a waiver of re-consent for those subjects who have been lost to 
follow-up. 
In cases where parents share joint legal custody in making medical decisions of their child (e.g. by 
a custody agreement or court order) both parents must give their parental permissions regardless of 
level of risk of the research. Exceptions may be made if one parent is deceased, becomes 
incompetent or is not reasonably available (e.g. in prison).  
Consenting to Pregnancy Testing in Minors of Childbearing Age:   We will inform the minor 
during the assent process that for safety, we need to do a pregnancy test.  She will also be told that 
if it is positive, we will counsel her and help her tell her parents.  If the minor does not want to 
proceed she will be advised not to sign the assent and her enrollment on this screening protocol will 
end.

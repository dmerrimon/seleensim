STUDY FLOW CHART/SCHEMA 
 
Compressively surgically staged patient s with advanced endometrial cancer 
(stage III-IV) with non-measurab le or measurable disease 
 
Regimen  
Carboplatin (AUC 5) plus Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over 3 hours) plus 
Bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) ever y three weeks for 6 cycles 
 
Follow-up  
Measurable disease: CT-scan/MRI/US  Following cycle 3 and 6 
Non-measurable disease: CT after 6 cycles 
All patients: Clinical exam every [ADDRESS_827367]. Approximately 
40,880 new cases were diagnosed in 2005, resulting in about 7,310 
deaths.  Five-year survival rates exceed 77% largely due to the ability to 
diagnose women with endometrial cancer  at an early stage. Seventy-five 
percent of women are Stage I (tumor confined to the uterus) at the time of 
diagnosis. However, when the diseas e is diagnosed at more advanced 
stages or if the disease recurs, prognosis is very poor with cure rates less 
than 15%.[ADDRESS_827368] therefore, focused on this 
extended area of risk and in clude: whole abdominal  radiotherapy with or 
without sensitizing chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy. Prior to 2002,  the control arm of collaborative 
group trials studying the treatment of women with m easurable Stage III, 
Stage IV, and recurrent disease was cytotoxic chemotherapy utilizing 
cisplatin (50 mg/m
2) and doxorubicin (60 mg/m 2) for seven cycles. This 
was based on several clinical observati ons. First, the results of whole 
abdominal radiotherapy in women wi th measurable disease has been 
disappointing, particularl y in women with residual tu mor size greater than 
two centimeters.2,3 Secondly, the results of Gynecologic Oncology Group 
 5
(GOG) Protocols #107 & #[ADDRESS_827369] suggested that the combination of 
cisplatin/doxorubicin is superior to single-agent therapy and not worse 
than all other combinations tested. In  these two GOG chemotherapy trials, 
the combination of cisplatin/doxorubi cin had a favorable toxicity profile 
with a response rate and PFS superior to doxorubicin as a single agent 
and similar to the combinat ion of doxorubicin/paclitaxel. In GOG Protocol 
#107, the overall response rate to cisplatin/doxorubicin was 42% with a 
complete response rate of 19%. M edian progression-free survival (PFS) 
was 4.8 months.4 In GOG Protocol #163, complete response to 
cisplatin/doxorubicin was 15% with an overall response rate of 40%.This was not significantly different from the experimental arm of doxorubicin/paclitaxel. Median PFS was 7.[ADDRESS_827370] recently completed GOG trial in advanced and recurrent 
endometrial cancer (GOG 177)  was published in 2004.7 In this trial, 
cisplatin/doxorubicin was compared to the triplet of cisplatin/doxorubicin/paclitaxel (TAP). The conclusions of this trial were 
that TAP improved progression-free survival  as well as overall survival in 
patients with advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer compared to 
treatment with cisplati n/doxorubicin. The im provement in median 
progression free survival and median survival was [ADDRESS_827371] expected result with current cytotoxic chemotherapi[INVESTIGATOR_33217] a complete response rate of 22% and a median PFS of approximately nine months  in patients with meas urable and recurrent 
disease. In patients with adv anced endometrial cancer without 
measurable disease (GOG 122) the regimen of cisplatin/ doxorubicin was 
compared to whole abdomen radiation.  Chemotherapy was superior  to 
radiation with PFS and overall surv ival improved approximately 30%. The 
PFS at 24 months for the entire population studied was approximately 50%.
 7.5 
Simultaneous to the evolution of tr eatment for patients with advanced and 
recurrent endometrial cancer in the GOG trials described above, a 
significant segment of the communi ty has adopted a treatment regimen 
consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel.  Use of this  combination is largely 
based on physicians’ vast experience with  this regimen’s tolerability and 
efficacy in ovarian cancer. Although the regimen has not  been tested in a 
 6
phase III setting in endometrial cancer  patients, its efficacy has been 
addressed in phase II studies.8-10 Hoskins and co-workers reported a 50% 
to 78% response rate in patients stratified by [CONTACT_66443].8 In this study, toxicity 
was minimal and median failure-free inte rval varied by [INVESTIGATOR_56579] (6 – 23 
months). Nakamura and coworkers repor ted similar results in their phase 
II trial.9 Their series of 18 patients wit h advanced endometrial carcinoma 
treated with carboplatin (AUC = 5 – 6) and paclitaxel (180 mg/m 2), a 
complete response rate of 45% was achieved. Finally, Price and 
coworkers reported a 63% response rate in their series of 20 patients treated with carboplatin (AUC = 5) and paclitaxel (135 – 175 mg/m
2).10 
Currently the GOG is conducting a r andomized phase III trial evaluating 
doxorubicin/ cisplatin/paclitaxel versus  carboplatin/paclit axel in patients 
with stage III and IV or recurrent endometri al cancer. In addition, the GOG 
has supported a randomized prospective trial using carboplatin/paclitaxel as the standard therapy in high risk endometrial histological subtypes (three versus six cycles).  
Rationale for Angiogenesis -Targeted Therapeutics:
 
Angiogenesis is one of the cardinal  processes leading to invasion and 
metastasis of solid tumors. The angiogenic-signaling pathway may be 
triggered by [CONTACT_621551] (VEGF) fr om tumor cells into the local 
microenvironment. There is evidence t hat angiogenesis plays a role in 
endometrial cancer diseas e progression and prognosis.11-[ADDRESS_827372] designed a Phase II 
 7
protocol evaluating the regimen of Carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel 
(175 mg/m2 over 3 hrs) combined wi th bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) given 
every three weeks in patients wit h advanced stage endometrial cancer.  
 
1.2 BEVACIZUMAB CLINICAL EXPERIENCE     
Bevacizumab has been studied  in a multitude of Phase I, II, and III clinical 
trials in more than 5000 patients and in multiple tumor types. The following 
discussion summarizes bevacizumab’s sa fety profile and presents some 
of the efficacy results pertinent to this  particular trial. ).  Approximately 
130,[ADDRESS_827373] or in clinical trials.  The following discussion summarizes bevacizumab’s safety profile and pres ents some of the efficacy results 
pertinent to this particular trial. Please refer to the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for descriptions  of all completed Phase I, II, and III 
trials reported to date.  (Bevacizumab Investigat or Brochure, October 
2005) 
In a large phase III study (AVF2107g) in  patients with metast atic colorectal 
cancer, the addition of bevacizumab,  a monoclonal antibody directed 
against vascular endothelial growth fa ctor (VEGF), to irinotecan/5-
fluorouracil/leucovorin (I FL) chemotherapy resulted in a clinically and 
statistically significant increase in dur ation of survival, with a hazard ratio 
of death of 0.67 (median survival 15.6 vs. 20.3 months; p < 0.001).  
Similar increases were seen in progression-free survival (6.2 vs. 10.6 
months; p < 0.001), overall response rate (35% vs. 45%; p < 0.01) and 
duration of response (7.1 vs. 10.4 m onths; p < 0.01) for the combination 
arm versus the chemotherapy only arm (bevacizumab Investigator 
Brochure, October 2005). 
Based on the survival advantage demonstrated in Study AVF2107g, 
bevacizumab was designated for priority  review and was approved on [ADDRESS_827374]-line treatment in combination 
with IV 5-FU− based chemotherapy for subjects with metastatic colorectal 
cancer. (http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi /nda/2004/STN-125085_Avastin.htm) 
 8
 Additional data from  Phase III trials in metastatic CRC (E3200), 
non−small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; E 4599), and metastatic breast cancer 
(E2100) have also demonstrated clin ical benefit from bevacizumab when 
added to chemotherapy.  In Study E3200,  the addition of bevacizumab to 
FOLFOX chemotherapy resulted in im proved overall survival compared 
with FOLFOX alone (13.0 vs. 10 .8 months, respectively, HR = 0.75; 
p < 0.01) in a population of previously treated CRC patients.   
There was also improved overall survival in first-line NSCLC patients 
(E4599) treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel + bevacizumab compared with 
chemotherapy alone (12.3 vs. 10 .3 months, respectively; HR = 0.80; 
p = 0.003).  The results from this tria l were the basis for FDA approval of 
bevacizumab for use in combination with carboplatin + paclitaxel as first-
line treatment of patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or 
metastatic, non-squamous NSCLC in Oc tober 2006.  Finally, patients with 
untreated metastatic breast cancer (E2100) who received bevacizumab in 
combination with weekly paclitaxel  had a marked improvement in PFS 
compared with chemotherapy  alone (13.3 vs. 6.7 months, respectively; 
HR = 0.48; p < 0.0001) (see the Bevacizumab Investigator Brochure for 
additional details). 
 
 
 
1.3 Translational Research Re lated to Anti-VEGF Therapy 
Markers of Angiogenesis  
Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth 
factor (bFGF) are among the most well studied angiogenic growth factors. 
In tumors, angiogenesis has been st udied by [CONTACT_621552]-vessel density (MVD) determined immunohistochemically using 
antibodies to CD31, a protein expr essed on the surface of vascular 
endothelial cells. MVD has been shown to predict the response of gastric 
adenocarcinomas to taxane-based therapy.[ADDRESS_827375] 
angiogenesis studies also evaluate VEGF, which has been shown to 
promote neovascularization and stim ulate endothelial cell survival. 21 
VEGF levels were also found to correlate with MVD in endometrial and cervical, but not ovarian cancers.
 22,24 In ovarian cancer, higher  VEGF 
 9
levels, but not MVD, were  found to significantly correlate with decreased 
patient survival. 23 Multivariate analysis dem onstrated that VEGF was an 
independent prognostic indicator of overall survival. 23 Additionally, resting 
and activated circulating endothelial cells (CECs) were found to be 
elevated in newly dia gnosed cancer patients (lymphoma) and declined 
with curative therapy.25  Though this has not been studied in endometrial 
cancer patients, this is a potent ial novel surrogate marker for 
angiogenesis. 25 
Immunohistochemistry will be utilized to evaluate the expression of CD-31 
and VEGF in previously untreated primary or metastatic tumor tissue. 
Expression of these angiogenic markers will be examined in conventional unstained tumor sections compared with tissue microarrays (TMAs). An analysis will be undertaken to assess the relationship between tumor tissue expression of angiogenic mark ers and clinical outcome including 
tumor response, progression free surviv al and overall survival in this 
patient population in the TMAs created for this trial if appropriate. If not, conventional unstained tissue sections  will be used to examine the 
relationship between the angiogenic markers and clinical outcome in patients participating in this treatm ent protocol. The exact choice of 
biomarkers to be evaluated and a ssays to be performed in tumor and/or 
serum specimens will be reevaluated based on evolving data in the field. Serum and plasma will be obtained prio r to therapy and prior to each cycle 
of chemotherapy to evaluate if levels of angiogenin, bFGF, VEGF, and VCAM-[ADDRESS_827376] oratory analysis to attempt to generate 
further hypothesis. 
 
Genomic Analysis:
 Possible role of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in 
endometrial cancer.   
Several TSGs have already been implic ated in endometrial cancer, either 
in germ line or sporadic, such as  pTEN, p53, MSH2, MLH1, and p16 
(Appendix H).  Polymorphisms that reduce expression of these genes 
could lead to increased risk.    Co mmonly, one assumes that both alleles 
must be lost in somatic cells bef ore a TSG contributes to tumor 
 [ADDRESS_827377], but in the case of 
adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor gene (APC) 26, this concept 
has been validated in colon canc er.  Therefore Yan et al. 26 had called for 
the development of a rapid assay to  measure such allelic expression 
imbalance (AEI), as a potential contri butor to disease risk.  We have 
successfully developed such an assay, measuring the allelic ratios for 
genomic DNA and mRNA in tissue sample s.  This has already led to the 
characterization of the functional  polymorphisms in two genes, namely 
MDR1 and OPRM1. 27,[ADDRESS_827378] we will use AEI assays for 18 
TSGs – already fully developed and valid ated.  This has already revealed 
the presence of relative ly frequent AEI for three genes in normal subjects 
(transformed B lymphocytes), one of  which being p16 (5% frequency of 
AEI in normals). Even where no AEI is  detectable in normal subjects (only 
15-[ADDRESS_827379] been tested thus fa r for each gene),  we expect germ 
line AEI to more frequent in endometrial  cancer patients if the TSG plays a 
role.    Moreover, we expect to fi nd the high-expressing gene to be deleted 
in the tumor tissues as reported for APC.[ADDRESS_827380] both at the karyotypic and 
the molecular levels.  It is unclear whet her the severity of these alterations 
reflects the need to inactivate multiple genes or is the result of wide 
spread loss of genomic stability.  Specif ic genes that are altered during the 
development of endometrial cancers are illustrated in Appendix H   
Since only 5% of endometrial canc ers are hereditary, most of the 
molecular alterations involved in endometrial carcinogenesis are thought 
to be associated with sporadic tumors .  Alteration of the PTEN and p53 
tumor suppressor gene is the most frequent genetic event described thus 
far in endometrial cancers and has been associated a worse prognosis

The availability of extensive genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_621528] t he Pharmacogenomics 
Laboratory affords the opportunity to search broadly for genetic variants 
affecting disease risk and treatment response. More than [ADDRESS_827381] does not include p53,  because this gene harbors no germ 
line SNP in the transcribed region of sufficient frequency that can serve as 
a marker for AEI.  Also, MLH1 is as yet missing (Appendix H), but will be added for this project.  Focus on TSGs in this context promises maximal return, and provides the basis for more  extensive studies in the future. 
 
1.[ADDRESS_827382] been treated previously on phase II 
trials with carboplatin/pac litaxel therefore  cons ideration was made to 
performing a randomized phase II to furt her characterize the efficacy of 
this treatment regimen. However, there is an ongoing GOG Phase III trial 
evaluating paclitaxel/cisplati n/doxorubicin compared to 
carboplatin/paclitaxel wh ich will provide a cont emporary treatment group 
that will permit a reasonable estimate of the contribution of bevacizumab to the treatment outcomes (eligibility criter ia will be matched in the current 
trial to that ongoing phas e III trial). Given the poor outcomes of advanced 
endometrial cancer patients with st andard chemotherapy regimens and 
the pre-clinical ev idence that angioge nesis plays a role in prognosis we 
have designed a Phase II protocol evaluating the regimen of Carboplatin 
(AUC 5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 over 3 hrs) combined with 
bevacizumab (15 mg/kg) given ever y three weeks in patients with 
advanced stage endometrial cancer.

3.2  Outcome Measures  
 
3.2.1 Primary Outcome Measures: 
 [IP_ADDRESS] Progression-Free Survival
 is the period from study entry until 
disease progression or date of last contact. [IP_ADDRESS] Toxicity profile
 of the triple drug combination therapy as 
assessed by [CONTACT_3989] v3.(Appendix C) 
3.2.2 Secondary Outcome Measures 
[IP_ADDRESS] Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least o ne dimension (longest dimension to be 
recorded). Patients with measurable disease must have at least one 
“target lesion” to be used to assess response on this protocol as defined by [CONTACT_393] (target lesion must be gr eater than [ADDRESS_827386]).  
Measurable disease, baseline docum entation of “target” and “non-target” 
 14
lesions, follow-up documentation of “target” and “non-ta rget” lesions and 
documentation of the best response achieved (complete response, partial 
response, stable disease) or of progr ession of disease will be required. 
[IP_ADDRESS].1 Complete Response (CR)  is disappearance of 
gross evidence of disease with confirmation at least 4 weeks later. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS].2 Partial Response (PR)
 is a 30% or greater 
reduction in measurement of longest dimension of each 
lesion with confirmation at least 4 weeks later..   
 
[IP_ADDRESS].3 Progressive Disease (PD) at least a 20% increase 
in the sum of the longest dimens ion of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum of the longest dimension 
recorded since the treatment start or the appearance of one 
or more new lesions. 
[IP_ADDRESS].4 Stable Disease  is any condition not meeting the 
above criteria. 
 
[IP_ADDRESS] Overall Survival is the duration of time from initiation of treatment to 
death or the date of last contact.  
Evaluation of best overall resp onse will be evaluated as follows: 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements reco rded since the treatment 
started). In general, the patient's best response assignment will depend on the achievement of both 
measurement and confirmation criteria

an explanation must be provided) 
• Patients with a global deterioration of health st atus requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
“symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective 
progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
• In some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response dep ends on this determination, it is recommended 
that the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspi[INVESTIGATOR_337]/biopsy) to confirm the complete 
response status. 
 
 
 
4.0 SAFETY PLAN 
See Section 4.1 for complete details of the safety evaluation for this study.  
Frequency and severity of adverse effects as assessed by [CONTACT_3989] v3 for 
the triple drug combination.  The fr equency of all toxicities will be tabulated 
from submitted case report forms and summarized for review. All serious and/or unexpected events will be communi cated to FDA, Genentech, Inc 
and to the OSU Cancer IRB at the James Cancer Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621529].  S ee section 12.2 for details. 
4.1 GENERAL PLAN TO MANAGE SAFETY  
a. Bevacizumab-Specific 
A number of measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients 
participating in this trial.  These measures will be addressed through 
exclusion criteria (see Section 5.3)  and routine monitoring as follows. 
Patients enrolled in this  study will be evaluated clinically and with standard 
laboratory tests before and at regular in tervals during their participation in 
this study.  Safety evaluations will c onsist of medical interviews, recording 
 16
of adverse events, physical examinati ons, blood pressure, and laboratory.  
Patients will be evaluated for adverse  events (all grades), serious adverse 
events, and adverse events requiring study drug interruption or 
discontinuation at each study visit for the duration of their participation in the study.  Patients discont inued from the treatment  phase of the study for 
any reason will be evaluated ~30 days (28–42 days) after the decision to 
discontinue treatment (see Section 7.1.3).   
Specific monitoring procedures are as follows: 
• Hypertension will be monitored th rough routine eval uation of blood 
pressure prior to each bevacizumab treatment.  Optimal control of 
blood pressure according to standard public health guidelines is 
recommended for patients on treatment  with or without bevacizumab. 
• Proteinuria will be m onitored by [CONTACT_39701]:creatinine (UPC) 
ratio.See  section 9.0 Clinical and Laboratory Evaluations and 
Appendix E: Procedure for Obtaining a urine protein/creatinine ratio. 
 
• If patients on treatment with bevacizumab require elective major 
surgery, it is recommended that bevacizumab be held for 4-8 weeks prior to the surgical procedure. Patients undergoing a major surgical 
procedure should not begin/restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after 
that procedure (in the case of hi gh risk procedures such as liver 
resection, thoracotomy, or neuros urgery, it is recommended that 
chemotherapy be restarted no earlie r than 6 wk and bevacizumab no 
earlier than 8 wk after surgery). 
Please see Section 8.0 for detailed instructions for the management of 
study drug–related toxicities.

6.0 TREATMENT PLAN 
 6.1 Treatment Plan   
 This is a single center open label single arm Phase II clin ical trial with no control 
group.  A regimen of Carboplatin (AUC 5 IV over 30 minutes) and paclitaxel (175 
mg/m2 over 3 hrs) combined with bevac izumab (15 mg/kg IV) given every 21 
 22
days in patients with advanced stage endometrial cancer for a maximum of 6 
cycles  
6.2  Accrual  
Thirty-eight patients will be  treated on protocol (ine valuable patients to be 
replaced at one to one). Ther e are currently five full-time gynecologic oncologists 
at our institution performing over five hundred major oncology surgeries annually. 
Approximately 30-40% ar e endometrial malignancy ca ses, yielding about 150-
200 primary endometrial cancer  patients annually.  Approximately 20-30 (15%) of 
these patients will be diagn osed with stage III-IV endometrial  cancer. In addition, 
two other academic gynecologic practi ces with high clinic al volumes have 
committed to the current prot ocol if single institution recruitment does not meet 
goals (minimum of 12 patients annually). We estimate recruitment to be 
completed in approximately 2 years. Pati ents will be followed for a maximum of 5 
years or until death. Approx imate date of completion is 2013, but mature data 
should be available by 2010.     
7.0 STUDY MEDICATION   
7.1  BEVACIZUMAB DO SAGE AND FORMULATION  
Bevacizumab is to be given at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. 
Bevacizumab is a clear to slightly opales cent, colorless to pale brown, sterile 
liquid concentrate for solution for intrav enous (IV) infusion.  Bevacizumab may be 
supplied in 5-cc (100-mg), 20-cc (400-mg), and 50-cc (1000-mg) glass vials 
containing 4 mL, 16 mL, or 40 mL of bevacizumab, respectively (all at 25 mg/mL).  Vials contain bevacizumab with phosphate, trehalose,  polysorbate 20, 
and Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI), U SP.  Vials contain no preservative and 
are suitable for single use only. 
 23
a. Safety Profile 
In the initial Phase I and II clinical trials, four potential bevacizumab-
associated safety signals were ident ified: hypertension, proteinuria, 
thromboembolic events, and hemorrhage.   Additional completed Phase II 
and Phase III studies of bevacizum ab as well as spontaneous reports 
have further defined the safety profile of this agent. Bevacizumab-associated adverse events identified in  phase III trials include congestive 
heart failure (CHF), gastrointes tinal perforations, wound healing 
complications, and arterial thromboembol ic events (ATE). These and other 
safety signals are described in further detail as follows and in the bevacizumab Investigator Brochure.  
Hypertension : An increased incidence of hypertension has been 
observed in patients treated wit h bevacizumab.  Grade [ADDRESS_827396] included hypertens ive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, and 
reversible posterior leukoencephalopat hy syndrome (RPLS) (Ozcan et al., 
2006; Glusker et al., 2006). RPLS may include signs and symptoms of 
headache, altered mental function, seizures, and visual disturbances / cortical blindness and requires treatmen t, which should include control of 
hypertension, management of specific symptoms, and discontinuation of 
bevacizumab. 
There is no information on the effect of bevacizumab in patients with 
uncontrolled hypertension at  the time of initiating bevacizumab therapy.  
Therefore, caution should be exerci sed before initiating bevacizumab 
therapy in these patients.  Monitoring of blood pressure is recommended during bevacizumab therapy.  Optimal c ontrol of blood pressure according 
to standard public health guidelines  is recommended for patients on 
treatment with or wit hout bevacizumab.   
Temporary interruption of bevac izumab therapy is recommended in 
patients with hypertension requiring m edical therapy unt il adequate control 
is achieved.  If hypertension cannot be controlled with medical therapy, bevacizumab therapy should be permanent ly discontinued.  Bevacizumab 
should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop hypertensive 
crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy. 
 24
 
Proteinuria : An increased incidence of proteinuria has been observed in 
patients treated with bevacizumab compar ed with control arm patients.  In 
the bevacizumab-containing treatment arms  of clinical trials (across all 
indications), the incidence of prot einuria (reported as an adverse event) 
was up to 38% (metastatic CRC Study AVF2192g).  The severity of 
proteinuria has ranged from asymptom atic and transient events detected 
on routine dipstick urinalysis to nephr otic syndrome; the majority of 
proteinuria events have been grade 1. NCI-CTC Gr ade 3 proteinuria was 
reported in up to 3% of  bevacizumab-treated patient s, and Grade 4 in up 
to 1.4% of bevacizumab-treated patie nts.  The prot einuria seen in 
bevacizumab clinical trials was not associated with renal  impairment and 
rarely required permanent disconti nuation of bevacizumab therapy.  
Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patients who develop Grade 4 
proteinuria (nephr otic syndrome) 
Patients with a history of hypertension may be at increased risk for the 
development of proteinuria when treated with bevacizumab.  There is 
evidence from the dose-finding, Phas e II trials (AVF0780g, AVF0809s, 
and AVF0757g) suggesting that Grade 1 proteinuria may be related to bevacizumab dose. 
Proteinuria will be monito red by [CONTACT_39701]:creatinine (UPC) ratio at 
least every 6 weeks.  If the UPC ratio is not available, a dipstick urinalysis 
may be used to allow treatment to proceed.   
 Thromboembolic Events : Both venous and arterial thromboembolic (TE) 
events, ranging in severity from cathet er-associated phlebitis to fatal, have 
been reported in patients treated with bevacizumab in the colorectal 
cancer trials and, to a lesser exten t, in patients treated with bevacizumab 
in NSCLC and breast cancer trials.   
 25
Venous thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary 
embolism, and thrombophlebitis): In the phase III pi[INVESTIGATOR_156623], there was a slight ly higher rate of venous TE  events that was not 
statistically significant in pat ients treated with bevacizumab plus 
chemotherapy compared with chem otherapy alone (19% vs. 16%). 
In Study AVF2107g, a Phase III, pi[INVESTIGATOR_47273], VTE events, including deep venous th rombosis, pulmonary embolism, and 
thrombophlebitis, occurred in 15.2% of patients receiving chemotherapy 
alone and 16.6% of patients receiving chemotherapy + bevacizumab.  
The incidence of NCI-CTC Grade ≥ 3 venous VTE events in one NSCLC 
trial (E4599) was higher in the bevacizumab-containing arm compared to the chemotherapy control arm (5.6% vs.  3.2%).  One event (0.2%) was 
fatal in the bevacizumab-containing arm;  not fatal events were reported in 
the carboplatin/paclitaxel arm (see Be vacizumab Investigator Brochure).  
In metastatic CRC clinical trials, t he incidence of VTE events was similar 
in patients receiving chemotherapy + bevacizumab and those receiving 
the control chemotherapy alone.  
In clinical trials across all indications the overall incidence of VTE events 
was 2.8% −17.3% in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared with 
3.2%−15.6% in the chemotherapy control arms.  The use of bevacizumab 
with chemotherapy does not substantia lly increase the risk of VTE event 
compared with chemotherapy alone.  However, patients with metastatic 
CRC who receive bevacizumab and experienced a VTE event may be at higher risk for recurrence of VTE event. 
 
Arterial Thromboembotic Events:  :  An increased incidence of ATE events 
was observed in patients treated wit h bevacizumab compared with those 
receiving control treatment.  AT E events include cerebrovascular 
accidents, myocardial infarction, tr ansient ischemic attacks (TIAs), and 
other ATE events.  In a pooled analysi s of data from five randomized 
Phase II and III trials (mCRC [AVF2107 g, AVF2192g, AVF0780g]; locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC [AVF0757g]; metastatic breast cancer 
[AVF2119g]), the incidence rate of ATE events was 3.8% (37 of 963) in 
 26
patients who received chemotherapy  + bevacizumab compared with 1.7% 
(13 of 782) in patients treated with chemotherapy al one.  ATE events led 
to a fatal outcome in 0.8% (8 of 963) of patients treated with 
chemotherapy  + bevacizumab and 0.5% (4 of 782) of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone.  Cerebrovascu lar accidents (including TIAs) 
occurred in 2.3% of pati ents treated with chemotherapy  + bevacizumab 
and 0.5% of patients treated with ch emotherapy alone.  Myocardial 
infarction occurred in 1.4% of patients treated with 
chemotherapy  + bevacizumab compared with 0.7%  of patients treated with 
chemotherapy alone (see the Bevaci zumab Investigator Brochure for 
additional details). 
 
Aspi[INVESTIGATOR_33930] a standard therapy for pr imary and secondary prophylaxis of 
arterial thromboembolic events in patient s at high risk of such events, and 
the use of aspi[INVESTIGATOR_248] ≤ [ADDRESS_827397] to metastatic colorectal canc er patients were pr esented at ASCO 
2005 (Hambleton et al., 2005). Furt her analyses of the effects of 
concomitant use of bevac izumab and aspi[INVESTIGATOR_621531]. 
Gastrointestinal perforation  Patients with metastatic carcinoma may be 
at increased risk for the development of  gastrointestinal perforation when 
treated with bevacizumab and chemot herapy. Bevacizumab should be 
permanently discontinued in patient s who develop gastrointestinal 
perforation. A causal association of intra-abdominal inflammatory process 
and gastrointestinal perforation to bev acizumab has not been established. 
Nevertheless, caution should be ex ercised when treating patients with 
 27
intra-abdominal inflammatory processes with bevacizumab. 
Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported in other trials in non-
colorectal cancer populations (e.g., ovarian, renal cell, pancreas, and 
breast, and NSCLC) and may be higher in  incidence in some tumor types. 
Wound healing complications:  Wound healing complic ations such as 
wound dehiscence have been reported in patients receiving bevacizumab. 
In an analysis of pooled data from two trials in metastatic colorectal cancer, patients undergoing surgery 28-60 days before study treatment with 5-FU/LV plus bevacizumab did not  appear to have an increased risk 
of wound healing comp lications compared to those treated with 
chemotherapy alone (Scappaticci et al., 2005). Surgery in patients currently receiving bevacizumab is  not recommended. No definitive data 
are available to define a safe interval after bevacizumab exposure with respect to wound healing risk in pati ents receiving elective surgery; 
however, the estimated half life of bevacizumab is 20 days. Bevacizumab should be discontinued in patient s with severe wound healing 
complications. 
If patients receiving treat ment with bevacizumab require elective major 
surgery, it is recommended that bev acizumab be held for 4–8 weeks prior 
to the surgical procedure.  Patient s undergoing a major surgical procedure 
should not begin or restart bevacizumab until 4 weeks after that procedure 
(in the case of high-risk procedures such  as liver resection, thoracotomy, 
or neurosurgery, it is  recommended that chemot herapy be restarted no 
earlier than 6 weeks and bevacizumab no earlier than 8 weeks after 
surgery). 
 Hemorrhage: Overall, grade 3 and 4 bleedi ng events were observed in 
4.0% of 1132 patients treated with bevacizumab in a pooled database 
from eight phase I, II, and III clinical trials in multiple tumor types 
(bevacizumab Investigator Brochur e, October 2005). The hemorrhagic 
events that have been observed in bev acizumab clinical studies were 
predominantly tumor-associated hemorrhage (see below) and minor 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage.  
 28
Tumor-associated hemorrhage  – Major or massive pulmonary 
hemorrhage or hemoptysis has been observed primarily in patients with 
NSCLC.  Life-threatening and fata l hemoptysis was identified as a 
bevacizumab-related adverse event in NSCLC trials.  These events occurred suddenly and presented as major or massive hemoptysis.  
Among the possible risk factors ev aluated (including squamous cell 
histology, treatment with anti-rheumatic/anti-infla mmatory drugs, treatment 
with anticoagulants, prior radiotherapy, bevacizumab therapy, previous medical history of atherosclerosis, central tumor location, and cavitation of tumors during therapy), the only variables that showed statistically significant correlations with blee ding were bevacizumab therapy and 
squamous cell histology. 
Of patients experiencing pulmonary hemorrhages requiring medical 
intervention, many had cavitation and/ or necrosis of the tumor, either 
preexisting or developi[INVESTIGATOR_621532].  Patients 
developi[INVESTIGATOR_621533]-benefit. 
In Study E4599, in which squamous ce ll carcinoma was excluded, the rate 
of any type of Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage was 1.0% in the control arm 
(carboplatin and paclitaxel) versus 4.1% in the carboplatin and 
paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm (Sandler et al. 2006).   
GI hemorrhages, including rectal bl eeding and melena have been reported 
in patients with CRC, and have been assessed as tumor-associated hemorrhages. 
Tumor-associated hemorrhages were also  seen rarely in other tumor 
types and locations, including a case of CNS bleeding in a patient with 
hepatoma with occult CNS metastas es and a patient who developed 
continuous oozing of blood from a thigh sarcoma with necrosis. 
Mucocutaneus Hemorrage:   Across all bevacizumab clinical trials, 
mucocutaneous hemorrhage has been seen in 20%-40% of patients 
treated with bevacizumab. These were  most commonly NCI-CTC Grade [ADDRESS_827398] also been less common events of minor mucocutaneous 
hemorrhage in other locations, such as gingival bleeding and vaginal 
bleeding.  
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome:   There have 
been rare reports of bevacizumab-tr eated patients developi[INVESTIGATOR_621534], a rare neurologic disorder that 
can present with the following signs and symptoms (among others):  
seizures, headache, altered mental status , visual disturbance, or cortical 
blindness, with or without associated hypertension.  Brain imaging is 
mandatory to confirm the diagnosis of RPLS.  In patients who develop RPLS, treatment of specific symptoms,  including control of hypertension, 
is recommended along with discontinuati on of bevacizumab.  The safety 
of reinitiating bevacizumab therapy in patients previously experiencing 
RPLS is not known (Glusker et al. 2006; Ozcan et al. 2006).   
 Congestive heart failure : In clinical trials CHF was observed in all cancer 
indications studied to date, but predom inantly in patients with metastatic 
breast cancer.  In the Phase III clinical  trial of metastatic breast cancer 
(AVF2119g), 7 (3%) bevacizumab-tr eated patients experienced CHF, 
compared with two (1%) control arm patients.  These events varied in 
severity from asymptomatic declines in left ventricular ejection fraction 
(LVEF) to symptomatic CHF requiring hospi[INVESTIGATOR_47276].  All 
the patients treated with bevacizum ab were previously treated with 
anthracyclines (doxorubici n cumulative dose of 240 −360 mg/m
2).  Many of 
these patients also had prior radiotherapy to the left chest wall.  Most of 
these patients showed im proved symptoms and/or left ventricular function 
following appropriate medical therapy (Miller et al. 2005). 
In a randomized, Phase III trial of patients with previously untreated 
metastatic breast cancer (E2100), the incidence of LVEF decrease 
(defined as NCI-CTC Grade 3 or 4) in the paclitaxel + bevacizumab arm 
was 0.3% versus 0% for the paclitaxel alone arm  
 30
No information is available on patient s with preexisting CHF of [LOCATION_001] 
Heart Association (NYHA) Class II −IV at the time of initiating bevacizumab 
therapy, as these patients were excluded from clinical trials. 
Prior anthracyclines expos ure and/or prior radiot herapy to the chest wall 
may be possible risk factors for the development of CHF.  Caution should 
be exercised before initiating bevacizum ab therapy in patients with these 
risk factors. 
A Phase II trial in patients with re fractory acute myelogenous leukemia 
reported 5 cases of cardiac dysfunc tion (CHF or LVEF decrease to < 40%) 
among 48 patients treated with sequent ial cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and 
bevacizumab.  All but 1 of these pati ents had significant prior exposure to 
anthracyclines as well (Karp et al. 2004).  
 Two additional studies investigated  concurrent administration of 
anthracyclines and bevacizumab.  In [ADDRESS_827399] 
cancer treated with neoadjuvant docetaxel, doxorubicin, and 
bevacizumab, no patients developed c linically apparent CHF; however, 
patients had asymptomatic decreases in LVEF to < 40% (Wedam et al. 
2004).  In a small Phase II study in patients with soft tissue sarcoma, 2 of 
the 17 patients treated with bevacizumab and high-dose doxorubicin (75 
mg/m
2) developed CHF (one Grade 3 event after a cumulative doxorubicin 
dose of 591 mg/m2, one Grade 4 event after a cumulative doxorubicin 
dose of 420 mg/m2); an additional 4 patients had asymptomatic decreases 
in LVEF (D’Adamo et al. 2004). 
Other studies in patients with various tumor types and either a history of 
anthracycline exposure or conc omitant use with bevacizumab are 
ongoing.  
Patients receiving concomitant anthracyclines or with prior exposure to 
anthracyclines should have a baseline MUGA scans or echocardiograms 
(ECHOs) with a normal LVEF. 
Neutropenia:   Increased rates of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, 
or infection with severe neutropenia (including some fatalities) have been 
 31
observed in patients treated with some myelotoxic chemotherapy 
regimens plus bevacizumab in co mparison to chemotherapy alone 
(Sandler et al. 2006). 
 
Additional Adverse Events: See the bevacizumab In vestigator Brochure

7.1.2 Bevacizumab Storage 
Upon receipt of the study drug, vi als are to be refrigerated at 2 °C–8°C  
(36°F–46° F) and should remain refrigerated until  just prior to use.  DO NOT 
FREEZE.  DO NOT SHAKE.   Vial s should be protected from light. 
Opened vials must be used within [ADDRESS_827403] be 
administered within 8 hours. 
7.2 PACLITAXEL (NSC #673089) 
Formulation : Paclitaxel is a poorly soluble plant product from western yew, 
Taxus brevifolia. Improved solubility requires a mixed solvent system with 
further dilutions of either 0.9% sodium  chloride or 5% dextrose in water. 
Supplier/How Supplied : Commercially available. A sterile solution 
concentrate, 6 mg/ml in 5 ml vials (30 mg/vial) in polyoxyethylated castor 
oil (Cremophor EL) 50% and dehydrated alcohol, USP, 50%. The contents 
of the vial must be diluted just prior to clinical use. It is also available in 
100 and 300 mg vials. 
Solution Preparation:  Paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose, will be diluted in 
500-1000 cc of 0.9% Sodium Chloride injection, USP or 5% Dextrose 
injection, USP (D5W) (500 cc’s is adequat e if paclitaxel is a single agent). 
Paclitaxel must be prepared in glass or polyolefin containers due to 
leaching of diethylhexlphthalate (DEHP)  plasticizer from polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC) bags and intravenous tubing by [CONTACT_69147]. 
NOTE: Formation of a small number of fi bers in solution (within acceptable 
limits established by [CONTACT_621555]) have been 
observed after preparation of taxol. Ther efore, in-line filtration is necessary 
for administration of paclitaxel so lutions. In-line filtration should be 
accomplished by [CONTACT_8246] a hydr ophilic, microporous filter of pore 
size not greater than 0.22 microns (e .g.: IVEX-II, IVEX-HP or equivalent)

Although particulate formation does not  indicate loss of drug potency, 
solutions exhibiting excessive particulate matter formation should not be 
used. 
Storage:  The intact vials can be stored in a temperature range between 2-
25oC (36-77°F). 
Stability : Commercially available paclitaxel will be labeled with an 
expi[INVESTIGATOR_320]. All solutions of paclitax el exhibit a slight haziness directly 
proportional to the concentration of  drug and the time elapsed after 
preparation, although when prepared as described above, solutions of 
paclitaxel (0.3-1.2 mg/ml) are physi cally and chemically stable for 48 
hours. 24 Administration of Paclitaxel
: Paclitaxel, at the appropriate dose and 
dilution, will be given as a 3-hour cont inuous IV infusion. Paclitaxel will be 
administered via an infusion control device (pump) using non-PVC tubing 
and connectors, such as the IV admi nistration sets (polyethylene or 
polyolefin) which are used to infuse parenteral Nitroglycerin. Nothing else 
is to be infused through the line wher e paclitaxel is being administered.

7.4 Methods of Chemotherapy Administration  
Biometric considerations in dose calculation Maximum body surface area used for Ca rboplatin, Paclitaxel and dose 
calculations will be 2.0 m2. 
Bevacizumab will be dosed at 15 mg/k g, with no maximum to total mg. 
7.4.1 Sequence and timing of drug administration: 
• Paclitaxel will be infused over  [ADDRESS_827405] drug to be infus ed during any combination.  
• Carboplatin will be administered as a 30 minute infusion, 
following paclitaxel  administration. 
• Bevacizumab administration will be as a continuous 
intravenous infusion followin g carboplatin infusion. 
Anaphylaxis precautions should be observed during 
Bevacizumab administration DO  NOT ADMINISTER AS AN 
IV PUSH OR BOLUS. The initial dose should be delivered over [ADDRESS_827406] infusion is well 
tolerated, the second infusion may be administered over 60 minutes. If the 60- minute infu sion is well tolerated, all 
subsequent infusions may be administered over 30 minutes. 
7.4.2 Pre-Medication:  
 37
[IP_ADDRESS]  Paclitaxel  
For all courses where paclitaxel is to be administered, it is 
recommended that a preparative regimen be employed one hour 
prior to the treatment regimen on that day, to reduce the risk 
associated with hypersensitivity r eactions to these drugs. This 
regimen should include a standard dose of Dexamethasone (either 
IV or PO), an anti-histamine H1 (diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IVP 
or orally, or an equivalent dose of an alternate H1 blocker such as loratadine or fexofenadine), and a standard dose of antihistamine 
H2 IVP (such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine). 
[IP_ADDRESS] In the event of a prior Beva cizumab hypersensitivity reaction, 
the prophylactic regimen should be m odified as suggested in [IP_ADDRESS].1 
below. 
[IP_ADDRESS].[ADDRESS_827407] ic regimen is recommended 
upon re-exposure: 
• H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IVP or orally one 
hour prior to injection; or an equivalent dose of an alternate 
H1 blocker such as loratadine 10 mg or fexofenadine 60 mg). 
• H2 blocker (famotidine 20 mg IVP or orally one hour prior 
to injection; or an equivalent dose of an alternate H2 blocker). 
• Dexamethasone (10 mg administered PO 12 and 6 hours 
prior to Bevacizumab injection). 
[IP_ADDRESS] Antiemetic Regimens
 
It is anticipated that nausea and vo miting may be a significant side 
effect. The following representat ive antiemetic regimens are 
suggested: 
 38
• Ondansetron 8-32 mg IV 30 minutes prior to 
administration of chemotherapy and dexamethasone 10-20 mg IV 30 minutes prior to drug administration or, 
• Granisetron 10 mcg/kg IV (or 2 mg PO) 30 minutes prior to 
chemotherapy, with or without lo razepam 0.5-2.0 mg IV 30 
minutes prior to chemotherapy. 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosing of Carboplatin
 
The carboplatin dose will be calcul ated to reach a target area under 
the curve (AUC) of concentration x time according to the Calvert 
formula using an estimated glomerular  filtration rate (GFR) from the 
Jelliffe formula. 
The initial dose of carboplatin must be calculated using GFR. In the 
absence of new renal obstruction or ot her renal toxicity greater than 
or equal to CTC Grade 2 (serum creatinine >1.[ADDRESS_827408]), the dose of carboplatin will not be recalc ulated for subsequent cycles, but will 
be subject to dose modification as noted. 
In patients with an abnormally low serum creatinine (less than or 
equal to 0.6 mg/dl), due to reduced protein intake and/or low 
muscle mass, the creatinine clear ance should be estimated using a 
minimum value of 0.6 mg/dl. If a more appropriate baseline 
creatinine value is available withi n 4 weeks of treatment,which may 
also be used for the initial estimation of GFR. 
CALVERT FORMULA: Carboplatin dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 25) 
For the purposes of this protocol , the GFR is considered to be 
equivalent to the creatinine clear ance. The creatinine clearance is 
calculated by [CONTACT_621557]: 
Ccr = 0.9 x ____{98 - [0.8 (age - 20)]}
 
Scr 
Where: Ccr = creatinine clearance in ml/min 
 39
Age = patient's age in years (from 20-80) 
Scr = serum creatinine in mg/dl 
[IP_ADDRESS] Dosing of Bevacizumab  
Bevacizumab will be administered at 15 mg/kg IV. Patient weight 
prior to each cycle will be used to determine the Bevacizumab dose. 
 
8.0 TREATMENT MODIFICATIONS 
In order to maintain dose-intensity and cumulative dose-delivery on this 
study, reasonable efforts will be made to minimize dose reduction and 
treatment delays as specified. No dose escalation is planned for this study. 
8.1 Individual Dose Modification Levels 
All modifications are relative to the actual starting doses for the specific 
Regimen. For application of individua l dose modifications, see specific 
guidelines below. Allowable drug dos e levels and instructions are 
summarized in Tables A, B, and C. 
• General Guidelines for Hemato logic Toxicity (Section 8.2) 
• Hematologic Nadirs, Table A (Section 8.3) 
• Delayed Hematologic Recovery, Table B (Section 8.4) 
• Non-Hematologic Toxicity Table C (Section 8.5) 8.[ADDRESS_827409] of cycle delay and/or 
dose reduction as directed. 8.22 Treatment decisions will be based on the absolute neutrophil 
count (ANC) rather than the to tal white cell count (WBC). 
8.23 Subsequent cycles of therapy will not begin until the ANC is ≥  
1500 cells/mm3 (CTCAE Grade 1) and the platelet count is ≥ 
100,000/mm3. 
 40
Therapy may be delayed for a maximum of three weeks until these 
values are achieved. Patients w ho fail to recover adequate counts 
within a three-week delay will no longer receive protocol directed cytotoxic chemotherapy 
8.24 Use of Hematopoietic Cytokines and Protective Agents
 
The use of hematopoietic cytokines and protective reagents are restricted 
as noted: 
8.241 In general, patients will NOT re ceive prophylactic filgrastim 
(G-CSF), PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta ), or sargramostim (GM-CSF) 
unless they experience treatment delays or recurrent neutropenic complications after treatment modifi cations as specified. However, 
this is not disallowed in the cu rrent protocol. Patients may also 
receive growth factors fo r management of neutropenic 
complications in accordance with c linical treatment guidelines. If 
required, it is recommended that gr owth factors be initiated the day 
after the last dose of chemotherapy  and typi[INVESTIGATOR_621535] a 
minimum of 10 days or until the ANC is sustained above >1000/mm3. Growth factors s hould be discontinued if the ANC 
exceeds 10,000/ mm3 and should not  be used within 72 hours of a 
subsequent dose of chemotherapy. 
8.242 Patients will NOT receive pr ophylactic thrombopoietic agents 
unless they experience recurrent  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia after 
treatment modification s as specified below. 
8.243 Patients may receive erythropoietin (EPO), iron supplements, 
and/or transfusions as clinica lly indicated for management of 
anemia. 
8.244 Patients may receive amifosti ne or other protective reagents. 
8.25 Dose Modifications for Bevacizumab
 
There will be no dose reduction for Bevacizumab. Treatment should be 
interrupted or discontinued for certain adverse events, as described 
above. 
8.3 Modifications for Hemato logic Toxicity (Nadirs)  
 41
8.31 Initial occurrence of dose-lim iting neutropenia (defined in 8.32) 
and dose limiting thrombocytopenia (defined in 8.33) will be 
performed according to Table A. 
8.32 Dose-Limiting Neutropenia (DLT-ANC) is defined by [CONTACT_204662] 4 neutropenia 
persisting ≥ 7 days. There will be no modifications for 
uncomplicated Grade 4 neutropenia lasting less than 7 days. 
Febrile neutropenia is defined within the CTCAE as fever with or 
without clinically or microbiolog ically documented infection with 
ANC less than 1,000 /mm3 and fever greater than or equal to 38.5°C. 
8.33 Dose-limiting thrombocytopeni a (DLT-PLT) is defined by [CONTACT_204663] 4 thro mbocytopenia (<25,000/mm3) or 
bleeding associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia (25,000 to 
<50,000/mm3). There will be no modi fications for uncomplicated 
Grade 3 thrombocytopenia.

8.4 Modifications for Delayed Hematologic Recovery : 
8.41 Delay on the basis of neutro penia (Delay-ANC) is defined if 
the ANC is less than 1,500 cells/ mm3 (CTCAE Grade 2 or worse) 
within 24 hours prior to scheduled t herapy, or less than 1,000 cells/ 
mm3, if the patient received G-CSF during the previous cycle. 
8.42 Delay on the basis of th rombocytopenia (Delay-PLT) is 
defined if the platelet c ount is less than 100,000/ mm3 within 24 
hours prior to scheduled therapy. 
8.43 Modifications noted below are only required for management 
of delays in the absence of dose reductions stipulated by [CONTACT_621558]-ANC and/or DLT-PLT (as noted abov e). In other words, if the 
patient experiences DLT-ANC and Delay- ANC, make the 
modifications as indicated for t he nadir counts without additional 
modifications based on delayed recovery.

8.5.1 Peripheral neuropathy Grade 2 (or greater) requires reduction of 
one dose level in paclitaxel and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of three weeks until recove red to Grade 1. If peripheral 
neuropathy fails to recover to Grade ≤ 2 by a maximum delay of three 
weeks from time therapy is due, then paclitaxel only should be reduced 1 treatment level. 
 44
8.5.2 Hypertension . Patients receiving Bevacizumab should be monitored 
prior to each dose with measurement of blood pressure. Medication 
classes used for management of patients with Grade 3 hypertension 
receiving Bevacizumab included angiot ensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 
beta blockers, diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. The goal for blood pressure control should be consis tent with general medical practice 
guidelines (i.e. < 140/90 mmHg in general and < 130/80 mmHg for 
patients with diabetes). 
• For controlled hypertens ion, defined as systolic ≤ 150 mm 
Hg and diastolic ≤  90 mm Hg, continue Bevacizumab 
therapy. 
• For uncontrolled hypertension (systolic > 150 mm Hg or 
diastolic > 90) or symptom atic hypertension less than 
CTCAE Grade 4, hold Bevacizumab treatment, with anti-hypertensive therapy initiated or continued, as in 8.52. 
• During the period of combination chemotherapy with 
Bevacizumab, if hypertension is controlled and symptomatic 
hypertension has resolved by [CONTACT_621559], continue all therapy. 
• During the period of combination chemotherapy with 
Bevacizumab, if hypertension remains uncontrolled or symptomatic hypertension, less than CTCAE Grade 4, 
persists one week after holding treatment, the next treatment cycle should contain paclitaxel and Carboplatin only, if 
applicable, as otherwise indica ted in the protocol, with 
Bevacizumab omitted. 
• Bevacizumab should be discont inued for the remainder of 
the study in any patient developi[INVESTIGATOR_621536] 4 hypertension. 
8.5.3 Proteinuria.  Patients receiving Bevacizumab should be monitored 
by [CONTACT_621560]:cr eatinine (UPC) ratio prior to every 
other dose of Bevacizumab: 
 45
UPC ratio < 3.5 Continue Bevacizumab 
UPC ratio ≥ 3.5 Hold Bevacizumab until UPC 
ratio recovers to < 3.5. If 
therapy is held for > 2 months due to proteinuria, discontinue Bevacizumab. 
Grade 4 or nephrotic syndrome Discontinue Bevacizumab 
 
 
8.5.4 Hemorrhage. Bevacizumab will be disc ontinued in patients with 
CTCAE Grade 3 hemorrhage and receivi ng full-dose anticoagulation. For 
all other patients with CTCAE Grade 3 hemorrhage, Bevacizumab should 
be held until ALL of the fo llowing criteria are met: 
8.541 bleeding has resolved 
8.542 blood hemoglobin level is stable 
8.543 there is no bleeding diathesis that would increase the risk of 
therapy 
8.544 there is no anatomical or pathologic condition that can 
increase the risk of hemorrhage recurrence. 
Patients who experience delay of resolu tion according to the above criteria 
for >3 weeks, recurrence of Grade 3 hemorrhage, or any CTCAE Grade 4 
hemorrhage will be taken off Bevacizumab therapy. 
8.5.5 Thrombosis. 
8.5.51 Arterial Thrombosis 
Bevacizumab will be discontinued for ≥ CTCAE Grade 3 arterial 
thrombotic events (including cere brovascular ischemia, transient 
ischemic attack, cardiac ischemia/i nfarction, peripheral or visceral 
 46
arterial ischemia) or CTCAE Grade 2 arterial thrombotic events new 
or worsened since beginning Bevacizumab therapy. 
8.5.52 Venous Thrombosis 
Treatment with Bevaci zumab will be held for CTCAE Grade 3 or 
asymptomatic CTCAE Grade 4 venous  thrombosis. For patients on 
therapeutic anticoagulation, PT INR or PTT (whichever appropriate) 
should be monitored closely duri ng Bevacizumab therapy. If the 
planned duration of full -dose anticoagulation is ≤ 3 weeks, 
Bevacizumab should be held until the full-dose anticoagulation 
period is over. If the planned durati on of full-dose anticoagulation is 
> 3 weeks, Bevacizumab may be re sumed during the period of full 
dose anticoagulation if ALL of the following crit eria are met 
(otherwise such patients will be taken off Bevacizumab therapy): 
[IP_ADDRESS] The patient must have an in-range INR (usually 
between 2 and 3) on a stable dose of warfarin (or other anticoagulant) or on stable dose of  heparin prior to restarting 
treatment. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The subject must not  have pathological conditions 
that carry high risk of bleedi ng (e.g. tumor involving major 
vessels). 
[IP_ADDRESS] The subject must not have had hemorrhagic events 
while on study. 
[IP_ADDRESS] The patient is benef iting from treatment (no 
evidence of disease progression). 
Patients with symptomatic CTCAE Grade 4, or recurrent/worsening 
venous thromboembolic events afte r resumption of Bevacizumab 
treatment, will be taken off Bevacizumab therapy. 
8.5.6 Coagulopathy . For CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 coagulopathy: hold 
treatment, until PT/PTT resolve to  Grade 1. For patients with PT/INR 
greater than the intended therapeutic range while on therapeutic warfarin, 
treatment with Bevacizum ab will be held at the discr etion of the treating 
physician in discussion with the principal investigator. Patients 
 47
experiencing treatment delay greater than three weeks because of failure 
to meet the above crit eria will be taken off Bevacizumab therapy. 
8.5.7 Wound Disruption/Bowel Perf oration, Fistula, or GI Leak : 
Bevacizumab will be discontinued in  the event of wound disruption 
requiring surgical intervention. Bevacizumab will be di scontinued in the 
event of new development of bowel per foration, fistula, or GI leak  
8.5.8 Renal toxicity  (associated with reduction in GFR) is not expected as 
a direct complication of chemotherapy in this previously untreated patient 
population using the prescribed dose and schedule of each regimen. As 
such, there are no specific dose modifications for renal to xicity. However, 
the target AUC dose of carboplatin must be recalculated each cycle in any 
patient who develops renal toxicity, defined by [CONTACT_621561] 1.5 x instituti onal upper limit normal (ULN), CTCAE Grade ≥ 2. 
8.5.9 Intestinal obstruction . Bevacizumab will be held for occurrence of 
CTCAE Grade 3 toxicity, until resolution to ≤CTCAE Grade [ADDRESS_827410] complication of 
chemotherapy in this untreated pati ent population using the prescribed 
dose and schedule for each regimen. Howe ver, the development of Grade 
3 (or greater) elevations in SGOT  (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline 
phosphatase or bilirubin requires reducti on of one dose level in paclitaxel 
and withholding of Bevacizumab, and delay in subsequent therapy for a maximum of three weeks until recovered to Grade 1. 
8.5.[ADDRESS_827411] on organ function of Grade 2 (o r greater) require discussion with 
the principal investigator [INVESTIGATOR_621537] w here noted below in Section 8.631. 
8.5.14  Special Modifications in Study Treatment  
8.6311 For any CTCAE Grade 3 non- hematologic adverse event 
(except controllable nausea/emesis), Bevacizumab should be held 
until symptoms resolve to ≤ CTCAE Grade 1. If a CTCAE Grade 3 
adverse event persists for > three weeks or recurs after resumption 
of Bevacizumab, the patient will be taken off all protocol therapy. 
8.6312 For any CTCAE Grade 4 non- hematologic adverse event 
(except controllable nausea/emesis), the patient will be taken off all 
protocol therapy. 
8.[ADDRESS_827412] medical practice. Bevacizumab has a 
terminal half-life of 2 to 3 weeks; theref ore, its discontinuation results in slow 
elimination over several m onths. There is no available antidote for bevacizumab.  
Subjects should be assessed clinically for toxicity prior to, during, and after each 
infusion. If unmanageable toxicity occurs  because of bevacizumab at any time 
during the study, treatment with bevacizumab should be discontinued.  
Infusion Reaction:  Infusion of bevacizumab should be interrupted for subjects 
who develop dyspnea or clinically si gnificant hypotension. Subjects who 
 49
experience a NCI CTCAE v. 3.0 Grade 3 or 4 allergic reaction / hypersensitivity, 
adult respi[INVESTIGATOR_1505], or bronchospasm (regardless of grade) will 
be discontinued from bev acizumab treatment. 
The infusion should be slowed to 50% or less or interrupted for subjects who 
experience any infusion-associated sympt oms not specified above. When the 
subject’s symptoms have completely resolved, the infusion may be continued at 
no more than 50% of the rate prior to the reaction and increased in 50% increments every 30 minutes if well tolerated. Infusions may be restarted at the full rate during the next cycle.  
Adverse events requiring delays or pe rmanent discontinuation of bevacizumab 
are listed in Table 1  
Regardless of the reason for holding study drug treatment, the maximum 
allowable length of tr eatment interruption is 2 mont hs (for events not treatment 
related).  The maximum allowable length for treatment interruptions secondary to 
treatment related toxicities  3 weeks as described in Section 8.0

• The patient may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. 
• Patients with evidence of progres sive disease or patients with 
significant side effects or deterio ration of performance status may be 
removed from study at the investigator’s discretion. 
• All the patients will be followed unt il death or maximum of [ADDRESS_827418] 50% against the alternative that the [ADDRESS_827419] 70% (alpha of 0.1, Be ta of 0.1, power of 90%). Data will be 
reported for all patients treated under the protocol. Toxicity, overall survival, 
objective tumor response, correlative endpoints will be examined. All patients will who start treatment will be included in t he analysis. If a patient enrolls in the 
study and does not receive any of the pr otocol chemotherapy will be declared 
“cancelled” and not included in the analysis.  These patients will be replaced at a 
one to one basis. 
11.1 Interim Analysis:
 
No planned interim analysis planned of efficacy data. However, annual 
review will be performed to assure annual recruitment goals are met (minimum of 12 patients annually). Sa fety will be cont inually evaluated 
(see Safety section) 
11.2 Planned Efficacy Evaluations
 
Efficacy Endpoints:  Parameters employed to evaluate treatment efficacy 
and toxicity are:  
11.2.1 Primary Efficacy Variables 
Primary Endpoints:  
 57
• 24 month failure-free rate (events are defined as disease 
progression, death without progre ssion, or discontinue due to 
progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity) is calculated by [CONTACT_257951].  Patients without a defined event will be 
censored at the last tumor assessment date. 
• Frequency and severity of adverse effects as assessed by 
[CONTACT_3989] v3. 
 
11.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
[IP_ADDRESS] Progression-free surviv al and overall survival  
[IP_ADDRESS] Time to progression will be reported using Kaplan 
Meier method. 
11.2.3 Translational Research Endpoints (Analysis to be exploratory as hypothesis generating): 
[IP_ADDRESS] Levels of VEGF, CD-31, TSP-1, and CD-[ADDRESS_827420] 
response to the study drug.  
[IP_ADDRESS] Levels of angiogenin, bFGF, VEGF, and VCAM-I in 
serum as determined with ELISA. These values will be evaluated over time in a time seri es plot to evaluate if these 
change over time with treatment  or with recurrence. If 
deemed appropriate further st atistical analysis will be 
performed. 
[IP_ADDRESS] ELISA measures of  VEGF in plasma will be 
performed. These values will be  evaluated over time in a 
time series plot to evaluate if these change over time with 
treatment or with recurrence.  If deemed appropriate further 
statistical analysis will be performed.

[IP_ADDRESS]. Gene Analysis Statistics and sample cohorts 
needed .(see appendix I)  In genes where we do not see any 
AEI in normal subjects (such as APC; our results are 
identical to those of Yan et al.), the presence of even a single AEI patient can be followed mechanistically by [CONTACT_621563] (as 
done by [CONTACT_621564]

power of 90% and a one-sided alpha=0.[ADDRESS_827422] that the 24 month 
Failure free rate is greater than 50 % when the true 24 month is at leas 
70%. A 90% confidence interval will be constructed using properties of 
binomial distribution. 
11.4 Methods of Analysis Progression-free survival and overa ll survival will be estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier method.  Esti mates of rates of clinic al response (defined as 
complete or partial response) wil l be calculated along with corresponding 
95% confidence intervals.  Safe ty analyses will include listing and 
tabulating frequencies of adverse event s (AE) and serious adverse events 
(SAE) resulting from both clinical obs ervation and laboratory tests.  Each 
AE will be graded from [ADDRESS_827423].   
Investigators are required to report to Genentech Drug Safety ANY

medical history but worsened in seve rity and/or frequency during therapy, 
AND that meets any of  the following regulato ry serious criteria: 
• Results in death  
• Is life-threatening  • Requires or prolongs i npatient hospi[INVESTIGATOR_059]  
• Is disabling  • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is medically significant or requires medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
Serious adverse events occurring afte r a patient is discontinued from the 
study will NOT be reported unless the inve stigator feels that the event may 
have been caused by [CONTACT_13462] a pr otocol procedure.  Study-specific 
clinical outcomes of death because of  disease progression are exempt from 
serious adverse event reporting, unless the investigator deems them related 
to use of the study drug.  Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621540] a 
serious adverse event. 
In general, serious adverse events assessed as clearly being due to disease 
progression and not due to study drug( s) should be excluded from adverse 
event reporting. However, in cases wher e the specificity or severity of an 
event is not consistent with the risk in formation, the event should be reported.  
If clearly related to the commercial agent(s ), adverse effects that are either 
severe or for which the cause is unknown must be reported using the rules listed below. 
The study will utilize the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Reporting 
Version 3.0. 
 
Toxicity Grade  Type (a) 
4,5 Unknown 
5 Known 
2,3 Unknown 
4 (non-myelo) Known 
4 (myelo  b) Known 
 60
(a)Type is based on toxicities included in the NCI list of known toxicities included 
in the known toxicities asso ciated with the study drug(s). 
(b)Myelosoppression, which incl udes neutropenia, anemia, and 
thrombocytopenia. 
 12.2 Reporting of Serious Treatment Emergent Adverse Events  
All STEAEs should be recorded on a MedWatch 3500 Form and faxed to: Genentech Drug Safety  Fax: ([PHONE_166] or ([PHONE_484]  (Please use the safety reporting fax cove r sheet attached to this document for 
your fax transmission) AND: David O’Malley, MD (Pri ncipal Investigator) 
Lois Dial, RN fax #[PHONE_12885](Research Center) Bobbi Cobb, RN, OCN, CCRP.  fax # [PHONE_12886] (Study Coordination Center)  AND:  Ohio State University IRB  Beth Wiley, Tel. [PHONE_12887]. fax # [PHONE_12888]  MedWatch 3500 Reporting Guidelines: In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect 
medication information, the report shoul d include the followin g information within 
the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500 form: 
• Treatment regimen (dosing fr equency, combination therapy) 
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned) 
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome, if known 
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics 
• Investigator’s assessment of the rela tionship of the adverse event to each 
investigational product and suspect medication 
 
Follow-up information:   Additional information may be added to a previously submi tted report by [CONTACT_51756]: 
• Adding to the original MedWatch 3500 report and submitting it as follow-
up 
 61
• Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow-up 
with the original MedWatch 3500 form  
• Summarizing new information and faxing it with a cover letter including 
subject identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial,  subject number), pr otocol description 
and number, if assigned, suspect drug,  brief adverse event description, 
and notation that additiona l or follow-up information is being submitted  
(The subject identifiers are important so that the new information is added 
to the correct initial report) 
Occasionally Genentech may contact t he reporter for additional information, 
clarification, or current status of t he subject for whom and adverse event was 
reported.  
Assessing Causality: Investigators are required to assess whether  there is a reasonable possibility that 
bevacizumab caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general 
guidance may be used. Yes: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to bevacizumab 
administration makes a causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for 
the observed event. 
No: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to bevacizumab 
administration makes a causal relationshi p unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic 
interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the 
observed event. 12.3 Safety Reporting Requirements for IND Exempt Studies  
For Investigator Sponsored IND Exempt Studies , there are some reporting 
requirements for the FDA in accordanc e with the guidance set forth in 21 CFR 
314.80. 
 
Postmarketing 15-Day “Alert Report” : 
The Sponsor-Investigator is required to notify the FDA of any fatal or life-
threatening adverse event that is unexpected and assessed by [CONTACT_248908] . An 
unexpected adverse event is one that is not already descr ibed in the Investigator 
Brochure. Such reports are to be submitt ed to the FDA (2 copi [INVESTIGATOR_014]) at the following 
address: Central Document  Room, [ADDRESS_827425], Rockville, MD [ZIP_CODE]. 
 
All Postmarketing 15-Day “Alert Reports” submitted to the FDA by [CONTACT_1034]-

13.0   DATA AND SAFETY MONITORING 
Overview:  
Data Safety Monitoring Board is to determine the safe and effective conduct of this 
clinical trial. This committee will recommend conclusions of the clinical trial. Risk associated with participation in research must be minimized to the extent practical. 
Monitoring will be conducted in toxicity, dos e-finding studies, efficacy, effectiveness and 
comparative trials involving greater than minimal risk to participants to assure the safety 
and welfare of the re search subjects.  
 Data Safety Monitoring Plan
 
1. Summary of main findings,  
2. Discussion of issues or problems 
3. List of participants of the tria l, data personal and data centers. 
4. Report and review accrual and multi site participation. 
5. Review unanticipated problems, adverse events, and serious adverse events as 
they are reported in the data. Ensure proper reporting of each event (ex. FDA and 
sponsor) 
6. Review data quality, timeliness, patient recruitment, accru al and retention 
7. Review protocol violations-deviations fr om protocol treatment, monitoring or 
study calendar 
8. Discuss protocol amendments as they would relate to the data collection results. 
9. Written report will document the results of the meeting.  
 Data Safety Monitoring Committee for Gyn Oncology
 
Gyn Oncology Data Safety Monitoring Committ ee will include the prin cipal investigator, 
data manager, clinical trials manager, re search nurse, and disease specific committee 
director. A written report of  the Disease Specific Committee’s recommendations of the 
Data Safety Monitoring Monthly report for this clinical trial will be signed by [CONTACT_621566]. Multi site participation 
of principal investigators can be accomplishe d by [CONTACT_577]. Sub investigators will 
be sent the written report on a monthly basis. All data safety monitoring committee reports will be sent to  the IRB with the continuing review submission. 
 
14.[ADDRESS_827426] protects the conf identiality of OSUMC medical records. 
Clinical records are kept in the office of  the Division of Gynecologic Oncology (M 
210 Starling-loving Hall) .Division of Gynecologic Oncol ogy clinical trial personnel 
is the only people with the authority to hav e access to these records. The Act 
does allow release of some informati on from the medical records without

APPENDIX E 
 
PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING A URINE PROTEIN / 
CREATININE RATIO 
  
 
1)  Obtain at least 4 ml  of a random urine sample (does not have to be a 24 
hour urine)  2)  Determine protein concentration (mg/dL)  3)  Determine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)  4)  Divide #2 by #3 above:      uri ne protein / creatinine ratio = protein 
concentration (mg /dL) / creatinine concentration (mg /dL)  The UPC directly correlates with the amount  of protein excreted  in the urine per 
24 hrs (i.e. a UPC of 1 should be equiva lent to 1g protein in a 24hr urine

ADVANCED STAGE ENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA 
 
APPENDIX F 
 
COLLECTION AND PROCESSES OF SAMPLES 
 
1. Blood Samples:  Following patient counseling and consent, patients will have 
approximately 5 ml of blood colle cted into a red top and 5 ml of blood into a purple top 
Vacutainer tube for serum and DNA processing. The total amount of blood taken for research 
purposes will be approximately 15 ml.  T he blood will be drawn dur ing the patients pre-
operative office visit or in the pre-operative area prior to surgery at the James Cancer 
Hospi[INVESTIGATOR_621542].   
2. Tissue Specimens:  Tissue specimens will be harvested by [CONTACT_621568] t he specimen from the patient in surgery.  Only tissues that 
are removed as part of the scheduled operative procedure will be considered for sampling.  
In the case of cancer, meta static specimens will be obtained for comparison with primary 
tumors when there is gross evidence of ex tended spread.  Normal appear ing portions of the 
surgical specimen may also be sampled for com parison with cancer-involved areas.  In the 
cases of benign gynecologic disease, the porti on of the diseased tissue as well as normal 
tissue will be sampled from the excised surgic al specimen.  All specimens will be frozen 
within [ADDRESS_827430] ored at –80 until the final diagnosis has 
been confirmed by [CONTACT_621569] (OSU) for 
purposes of patient management.  If there is any question r egarding diagnostic issues, the 
tissue collected for research purposes can be recalled to further delineate problems in 
making the clinical diagnosis.  Once the fo rmal pathology report has been rendered as part of 
the patient’s care, each “research specimen” will be processed for permanent storage in The Ohio State University Gynecologic Oncology  Tissue and Serum Bank, maintained by [CONTACT_621570] e University.  The patient’s diagnosis and 
determination of stage will not be affected by [CONTACT_621571]. Only remnant tissue samples not needed for diagnosis will be selected for the tissue bank. The Ohio State University Gynecologic Oncology Tissue and Serum Bank will be maintained by [CONTACT_621572] a division in the Department of 
Pathology at OSU.  
 75
Approximately 25% of each tissue specimen will be embedded in OCT and stored at –80°C 
to avoid artifact that can result from st orage of OCT embedded at lowe r temperatures.  The 
remainder of the tissue specimen will be stored in cryotubes at -180 °C in a vapor phase 
nitrogen freezer (MVE chart).  Each OCT em bedded specimen will have a hematoxylin and 
eosin stained slide prepared that will be reviewed by a board certified gynecologic 
pathologist.  This microscopic image will be photographed using the Aperio Scanscope and 
stored into database for future us e.  In the case of a large volume tumor, tissue specimens 
from the primary tumor will be mi nced into fragments and placed in to separate cryotubes.   
In cases in which there is less than 75% of  the tissue specimen composed of tumor, 
specimens may also be processed using laser capture microscopy to isolate focal aspects of a particular tissue specimen.  Molecular extracts (i.e. DNA, RNA, and protein) will be prepared according to the techniques described below and stored in the molecular library 
maintained by [CONTACT_621572] a division in the Department of 
Pathology at OSU.  
Refrigeration and freezer units will be equipp ed with continuous chart recording of 
temperature.  The laboratory technicians for the Human Tissue Resource Network a division 
in the Department of Pathology at OSU will h andle the quality assurance management of the 
equipment.  The refrigerator/freezer unit will be locked for security and keys will only be 
distributed to the laboratory technicians.  3. Dissection and Acquisit ion of Cancer Cells
:  Specimens of ascitic fluid will be centrifuged 
for collection of tumor cells prio r to extraction of DNA/RNA or  preparation of cell cultures.  
The white blood cell buffy coat will be simila rly collected after centrifuging of blood 
specimens, with collection of genomic DNA.  Bo th gross and laser capture microdissection 
(LCM) will be performed on the frozen tissue specim ens in order to maximize the yield of 
tumor cells prior to DNA and RNA extraction.  Morphologically defined normal and tumor 
epi[INVESTIGATOR_621543]-dissection.  In instances in which 
blood was not collected from a patient, genomic DNA will be extracted from paraffin 
embedded normal tissue specimens.  If paraf fin tissue is used, sections (5 μm) will be treated 
with xylene initially to remove paraffin and continued as per frozen sections.  All tissue 
microdissection will be performed in a laser capt ure microscopy core facility located in the 
Department of Pathology at OSU.  Micr odissected specimens will undergo DNA, RNA, and 
protein extraction according to procedures list ed below.  All “extract s” will be stored in the 
 76
Ohio State University Gynecologic Oncology Tissue and Serum Bank using bar codes that 
correspond with those that are used to label the tissue specimens that are permanently 
maintained by [CONTACT_293943].  
4. Sample preparation.  Genomic DNA and RNA will be prepared from 100 mg of frozen tissues.  For 
tissue extractions, frozen tissue samples are pulve rized under liquid nitrogen. The frozen powder is 
portioned into aliquots for DNA and RNA extractions.  DNA is prepared by [CONTACT_621573] K followed by [CONTACT_621574] “salting out” precipi[INVESTIGATOR_621544]. The 
DNA in the supernatant is furt her purified and recovered by [CONTACT_621575][INVESTIGATOR_332]. For RNA 
preparation, the starting materi al is homogenized in Trizol ™ reagent.  Chloroform is added to 
partition the solution into an organic phase containing the proteins, a DNA interface, and an aqueous 
layer containing the RNA. The RNA is recovered by  [CONTACT_6440][INVESTIGATOR_621545]. For additional purific ation, the RNA precip itate is dissolved in RNase free water or 
Qiagen buffer, then extracted using Qiagen RNeasy ™ columns according to the manufacturers 
instructions.  Complementary DNA (cDNA) is generated from  the mRNA by [CONTACT_621576] (Invitrogen) employing oligo dT as a primer.  This ensures that all polyA gene transcripts 
are represented at a rate that reflects the orig inal abundance of each gene product.  However, the 
oligo dT priming often fails in autopsy brain tissues, particularl y where the marker SNP for AEI 
analysis resides far upstream of the polyadenylation  site.  Therefore we use gene specific oligos 
targeting a region immediately 3’ of the marker SNP to prime cDNA  synthesis.  Since tissue samples 
are often in limited supply, we hav e multiplexed up to [ADDRESS_827431] of our assays are highly multiplexed, minimum requi rements for DNA and RNA are in the or der of 100 ng for DNA and 1 µg for 
RNA (depending upon the quality).  However, for multiple and diverse assays as proposed here we 
need several micrograms of DNA and RNA.  Where needed we apply whole-genome 
preamplification, with phi -29 DNA polymerase with r andom hexamer primers, using as little as 10 ng 
DNA.  This however does introduce additional error and is not useful for quantitation or methylation 
analysis. 
5. Serum extraction: 
 Blood samples will be allowed to  clot for 30-45 minute prior to 
centrifuge at 1000 x 10 min under refrigeration at 4 °C x 2.  The supernatent will be removed 
for storage at -180 °C in a vapor phase nitrogen freezer   
 77
6. DNA extraction:   DNA will be extract from white blood cell buffy coat and/or tissue using 
the Qiagen nucleic acid isolation kits for DNA using the robotic M48 equipment. This 
technology uses a magnetic bea d system. The integrity and c oncentration of DNA from 
tissue will be determined spectrophotometrically.  The DNA will be dissolved in pure DNase 
free and stored at -180 °C in a vapor phase nitrogen freezer   
7. RNA extraction:  Tissues will be homogenized in RNAzol B followed by 
[CONTACT_621577]/isopropanol extraction and ethanol prec ipi[INVESTIGATOR_332].  The RNA will be dissolved in 
filtered DEPC water.  Contam ination of any genomic DNA will be removed by [CONTACT_621578].  Blood collected in PaxGene tubes will be 
processed for RNA using the RNA extraction kit that is commercially available.  Quality and 
quantity of RNA will be checked on fo rmaldehyde-agarose gels and there will be a 
spectrophotometric determination of c oncentration prior to storage at -180 °C in a vapor 
phase nitrogen freezer. 
8 ELISA :  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD-31, thrombos podin-1 (TSP-1), and 
CD-105 (endoglin) levels will be obt ained by [CONTACT_6428]. ELISA will be performed using standard 
practices and commercially available kits. 9. Recording
. All tissue specimens as well as extracted components will be bar coded to 
maintain confidentiality.  The exact location of  the sample in the freezer will be stored in 
database (i.e. rack 1, box 3, row 4, 6th sample left-right) using am MS SQL database program 
for specimen inventory.  The amount of tissue as well as extracted components will also be 
listed within the database.  For ex ample, there may 1 vial of ti ssue, as well as 1 DNA sample, 
1 RNA sample and 1 serum sample that were brok en into 25% aliquots.  This would result in 
13 tubes of material that would be recorded within the bank.  Sample s (and quantity) added 
or removed from the bank will be recorded.  The audit trail will record aliquot changes and 
deletions as well.  Security levels and passw ords that protect the data meet HIPPA and HHS 
requirements.    10. Security.
 The tissues will remain in the bank maintained by [CONTACT_621579] a result of 
use in research studies. The director of ti ssue procurement will be in charge of maintaining 
the security of the tissue for The Ohio Stat e University Gynecologic Oncology Tissue and 
Serum Bank.   Future studies that utilize t he molecular extracts must undergo approval by 
 78
The Ohio State University Gynecologic Oncology Tissue and Serum Bank Oversight 
Committee. Access into the laboratory in The Ohio State University Gynecologic Oncology 
Tissue and Serum Bank will be obtained through a locked door that is only accessible to the 
laboratory technician and authoriz ed personnel that work in The Ohio State University 
Gynecologic Oncology Tissue and Serum Bank.  All molecular extracts will be maintained in a locked freezer with keys only available to t he laboratory technician/honest broker for the 
GDP.  In addition, video surveillance of the building will guarantee the security of the tissue 
bank as well as the equipment located there.    
11 Patient Confidentiality: 
All data along with an inventory of tissue and serum specimens 
and the master link between pat ient identities band the patient’s code numbers will be 
maintained at The Ohio State Gynecologic Oncology Tissue and Serum Bank. The identity 
code will not include patient’s social security number.  All information will be gathered by [CONTACT_16133] (principal in vestigators, data m anagers, research assistants, research 
administrators, research nurses)  of the Division of Gynecologic Oncology.  Only the honest 
broker, specified by [CONTACT_409591], will have access to the link between patient 
identity and coded number used to label tissue specimens and data forms.  Documents will be destroyed [ADDRESS_827432] the principal 
investigator (David O'Malley, MD at [PHONE_12884]) if they wish to withdraw  from the study. At 
this time the patient may request that any sa mples that they have donated by [CONTACT_621580].  Data collected before the 
patients withdraw from the study will be kept private and will not affect the patient’s medical 
care.

GENOTYPI[INVESTIGATOR_621546] 18 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENES 
Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_621547] 18 tumor suppressor 
genes.  
Approach
.  Using SNPlex, we measure 3-7 SNPs  per gene to assess genetic variability 
(including haplotype information) and to deter mine which samples are heterozygous for the 
marker SNP(s) in the transcribed region of t he 18 TSG genes.  We   then perform SNaPshot 
analysis for those samples heterozygous for the marker SNPs, measuring allelic ratio in 
genomic DNA and mRNA.  The presence of an alle lic expression imbalanc e is detected by a 
difference in the allelic ratios for DNA and mRNA.  AEI analysis will be performed in PBLs (germ line) and cancer plus adjacent normal tissues.    The patte rn of AEI in these samples 
alerts us to a possible role of  the respective gene in ovarian cancer.  This may also predict 
treatment outcome.  Once we have established the pattern and frequency of AEI, we can use 
AEI as the phenotype to search for the func tion polymorphism (23,24).  However this 
exceeds the scope of t he present grant application, but ra ther can form the basis for R01 
applications.     Methods.
  Selection of marker SNPs.  Marker SNPs must be in the transcribed region and 
sufficiently abundant (because we can perfo rm allelic assays only in heterozygous 
individuals).  Table [ADDRESS_827433] selected for developi[INVESTIGATOR_621548]. For some genes more th an one marker are used 
to increase the number of heterozygous samples and pr ovide internal controls.  These SNPs are also in 
the rapid genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_495271], so that we can rapi [INVESTIGATOR_621549].

Genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].   We use either SNPlex (ABI) or SNaPs hot (ABI) for genotypi[INVESTIGATOR_007].  SNPlex permit 
the simultaneous analysis of 48 SNPs per run, with a throughput of  5-10,000 SNPs per hour.    
(We have already determined over 150,[ADDRESS_827434] 
controlled for quality with SNaPshot.  Panels fo r the tumor suppressor genes are available, 
 81
with frequent htSNPs, any known functional SNPs, and the marker SBPs in Table 2. 
Genotypes not amenable to SNPlex analysis are done by [CONTACT_621581].     
SNaPshot methodology for allele-specific mRNA assays .  The method has been described 
by [CONTACT_621582] (23, 24) It is understood that this type of analysi s is challenging.  Therefore, 
each AEI assay requires rigorous validation and qual ity control, and every single step in the 
process must be optimized.  Main causes of analytical variability include cDNA formation and 
PCR amplification (see alternative methods below).  In contrast to absolute levels of mRNA 
which are also measured in all samples by [CONTACT_5203]-time RT-PCR, allelic ratio analysis takes advantage of the fact that  one allele serves as the contro l for the other.  We determine 
whether the DNA and mRNA ratios differ st atistically for each single sample (requiring 
independent repeats, 3 repeats each measured twic e).  In this fashion we can use AEI as the 
individual phenotype to scan the gene locus for the functional polymorphisms.  For most 
genes, we can reliably detect a 10-20% difference in mRNA levels generated from each of the two alleles present.  The level of AEI r equired for functional consequences is likely to 
vary from one gene to the next.  We have se lected SNaPshot (ABI) as the assay system, 
involving PCR and fluorescence pr imer extension analysis.  
SNaPshot assay procedure.
 The details of this assay for detecting AEI (measuring bot DNA 
and mRNA) have been published (23,24).  Briefly,  a stretch of genomic DNA (~70 bp's), or 
cDNA made from the same tissue, is amplifi ed by [CONTACT_940] (PCR), and the 
polymorphism is measured by [CONTACT_621583]. The products are analyzed usi ng an ABI 3730 capi[INVESTIGATOR_621550], and calcul ated with Gene Mapper 
TM 3.0 (ABI) software. This permits injection of 
48 samples every 20 min. The data for each inco rporated fluorescently labeled nucleotide is 
measured as a peak area.  Success rate for assay development is >90%, and alternative 
SNPs can be selected to overco me problems.  For maximum prec ision, we dilute samples as 
needed so that DNA and mRNA thresholds are sim ilar.  Using cloned DNA, we establish the 
number of mRNA molecules pres ent (1,000 or greater for opt imal results) using standard 
curves.  S.D.s for heterozygous genomic DN A samples range from 3-7%.  mRNA/cDNA 
ratios (triplicate samples each assayed twice) show higher standard deviations (5-15%), so 
that detectability of AEI varies with the qualit y of the sample and the SNP analyzed.   We 
have developed numerous controls, such as standard curves using cloned gene fragments 
containing the marker SNP, the use of more than one mark er SNP per gene, use of 
extension primers in both directions, [ADDRESS_827435] such factors 
to play a role, CpG island methylation is m easured using methylation- sensitive restriction 
enzymes and PCR.  In tumor samples the allelic DNA ratios can vary (LOH, gene 
amplification).  This is address ed by [CONTACT_621584], set as 1.  
However, significantly different DNA ratios in some samples indicate the presence of 
chromosomal instability, which is also to be ex pected if one allele (the high-expressing one) is 
selectively deleted thereby [CONTACT_621585].  We also expect the 
tumor samples not to be homogenous; this problem is partially overcome by [CONTACT_621586], whereby [CONTACT_621587] (assuming a 
mixture of tumor and stroma). Additionally, the use of microdissection techniques (Appendix A-
section 3) will be used were applicable. 
 82
Statistics and sample cohorts needed .  In genes where we do not see any AEI in normal 
subjects (such as APC; our resu lts are identical to those of Ya n et al.), the presence of even 
a single AEI patient can be followed mechanistica lly by [CONTACT_621588] (as done by [CONTACT_621564].).  In the case of p16,  with 5% AEI frequency in normal 
subjects, regular power analyses can yield the number of cases needed to show a statistical 
association with ovarian cancer.  More im portantly however, we can use each patient 
separately by [CONTACT_621589]/normal ti ssue versus tumor tissues.  The requirement 
that the high-expressing allele be deleted in tumors is highly specific, thus reducing the 
number of subject needed drastically.

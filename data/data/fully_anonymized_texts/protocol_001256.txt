Patients randomly assigned  to placebo will be administere d placebo sc every 4 weeks for 48 week s (a total of 13 
doses will be administered).  
Method  of Blinding:  Patie nts will be randoml y assigned  to treatment through a qualifie d randomization service 
provider (eg, interactiv e response technology [IRT]) . Patie nts and investigators will remain blinded to treatment 
assignment during the study. Study drug may not be administered by [CONTACT_601230]-
2K, BILAG-2004, or PhGA. Study drug should be administered at each study v isit after all study visit procedures 
and assessments have  been completed. 
Duration of Participation: This study will consist of a scree ning period up to [ADDRESS_796127] dose of study 
drug (at 48 weeks) for the final assessment (week 52). Patients  are expected  to participate in the study for up to 
approximately 54 weeks. 
Gener al Design and Methodology: This is a randomized,  double -blind,  placebo -controlled  study to evaluate  the 
efficacy  and safety of a 200-mcg dose of IPP-[ADDRESS_796128] of care (SOC)  compared with placebo  plus SOC  
in patients with active  SLE.  The study consists of a 2-week  screening  period (visit 1), a 48-week treatment period 
beginning with a baseline visit in which randomization will be completed and study drug treatment will start (visit 2 
and visits 4 through 14), and a final assess ment [ADDRESS_796129] dose of study drug (visit 16 [week  52]). 
NOTE: If needed durin g the scree ning period, up  to 14 additional days are permitted to confirm eligibility  (eg, 
BILAG -2004,  SLEDAI -2K, and PhGA central system assess ment, laboratory results …. ). In addition  to the typi[INVESTIGATOR_601189],  such as obtaining  medical,  psychiatric,  and medication  history  
(medication  history  to be obtain ed from  start of screening)  and performing a physical  examination  and tests to 
deter mine the patients’  health  status  and eligibility  for participation  in the study, procedures  will include assess ment 
of disease  activity  using  the SLEDAI -2K and BILAG -2004  disease activ ity indices  and the SFI, and disease marker  
testing  (ie, at screen ing, anti-dsDNA  Ab, C3, C4, and ANA  only]).  Eligibility  will be confir med by  [CONTACT_2329] a  central 
system  to validate the BILAG -2004,  SLEDAI -2K, and PhGA  assess ments. Eligible  patients  will return  to the study 
center  at baseline  and will be randomly  assigned  (stratified  by [CONTACT_11338],  SLEDAI -2K screen ing total score  [6 to 9 or 
≥10],  and racial -ethnic  group  classification  [black/Hisp anic or others])  at baseline  with an equal  probability  and in a 
blinded  fashion to receive  either  IPP-[ADDRESS_796130] dose of 200 mcg sc  of IPP-201101  or placebo  (sc) will be administered  after all 
assess ments have  been  completed.  Patients  will be monitor ed for systemic  symptoms for at  least [ADDRESS_796131] dose of study drug  for immunogen icity testing, and every 4 weeks for  48 
weeks (weeks 4, 8, 12, 16,  20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48) to  receive study  drug.  Patients  may continue  on their 
usual treatment  for SLE (ie, SOC)  as long as the inclusion  and exclusion  criteria  regarding these  treatments are met 
and the total weekly  steroid dose does not exceed  80 mg of prednisone equivalent/week;  the dosages for

• absolute and relati ve changes in the FACIT-Fatigue  at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52 (or final assessme nt) 
• in vitro intracellular  and secreted  cytokine response  
Safety Variables and Endpoin ts: Safet y meas ures and endpoints will include the following: 
• occurr ence of adverse events throughout the study 
• clinical  labora tory (serum  chemist ry, hematology,  and urinalysis)  test results at each visit during  the treatment 
period 
• vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse, temperature, and body weight) measure ments at each 
visit during  the treatment  period 
• 12-lead electr ocardiogram (ECG)  findings at week  52 (or final assess ment) 
• physical examination findings, including physical examination  symptom directed  finding s, at specified time 
points at each visit during the treatment period 
• evaluation  for suicidality  at each visit during the treatment period  using  the C-SSRS  
• concomitant medication usage throughout the study 
Immu nogenicity: The immunogenicity variable/endpoint for this study is as follows: any prese nce of anti–IPP-
201101  Ab at visits at weeks 2, 4, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44, and 52 (or final assess ment). Any patient with a positive test 
result for anti–IPP-[ADDRESS_796137] to follow-up. 
Phar macokinetics/Phar macodynamics: Blood samples (5 mL) for pharmac okinetics will be collected  from  
patients  at selected  North American and Western European study centers via venipuncture or indwelling catheter 
prior to and 5 minutes and 1, 2, and 24 hours after study drug administration at weeks 0, 16, and 32 (visits 2, 7, and 
11, respectively). A blood sample for measure ment of the concentratio n of IPP-[ADDRESS_796138] a serio us adverse event and/or have an adverse event leading to withdrawal from the study. 
In vitro intracellular  and secreted  cytokine response:  Blood samples (5 mL) will be collected  from  patients  at 
selected  study centers via venipuncture or indwelling catheter prior study drug administration at weeks 0, 4 24 and 
48 (visits 2,4,9 and 15 , respectively). 
Statistic al Considerati ons: The primary efficacy  variable is the proportion  of patients  achieving  a combined  
clinical response  using the SRI at week  52. With 100 evaluable patients per group (200 total), this study will have  a 
90% or greater power to detect a 25% or greater differe nce or a 20% difference with a  80% power in the proportion 
of SRI responders between the IPP-[ADDRESS_796139] (2-sided, alpha=0.05)  is based on an anticipated  placebo effect  at week 52 of 40% to 45%. This range 
cover s the placeb o effec t reported in the literat ure and in a Phase 2b, multicenter, randomized, double -blind , 
placebo -controlled  dose-ranging  study of IPP-201101  (study  IP-004).  The response rate under active is based on 
the Phase IIb study performed with the mannitol formulation outside the US. This study showed an absolute 25% 
response of active over placebo increasing to 40% in the interim analysis.  Using a 80% or a 90%power leads to a 
sample size of [ADDRESS_796140] 1 dose of the study drug.. The statistica l method to be used for the SRI is 
the logistic regression model with treatment and stratificati on factors as main factors. The SRI is linked to the model 
factors through the logit function. The likeliho od-ratio–based Chi-square statistic s will be used for testin g the 
treatment differe nce between IPP-201101  and placebo  in SRI at week 52 at the significance level 0.05. The odds 
ratio (active/plac ebo) and associate d 95% confidence interval will be determined from the logistic regressio n model. 
As sensitivity analyses, the primary analysi s will be repeated using another [ADDRESS_796141] method, patients who withdraw becaus e 
of lack of efficac y will be classified  as treatment failures  assess ed by [CONTACT_601232]  52. For patients  who withdraw

1 BACKGROUND  INFORMATION  
 
1.1 Introducti on 
 
Syste mic lupus  erythe matosus  (SLE) is a polygenic  autoimmune  disease  characterized  by B-cell 
hyperactivity  leading  to the occurre nce of an array  of autoantibodies,  formation  of immune  
complexes,  and inflam mation in different  organs  and tissues.  In addition  to the intrinsic  
hyperactivity  of B cells,  abnormalities  also affect  T-cell responses,  the production  of T-cell 
cytokin es, and the B-T–cell dialogue.  Current  treatments for patients  with SLE are based  
primarily on immunosuppressive  drugs,  such as corticosteroids  and cyclophospha mide, which  
are often  administered  at high doses  during  acute  exacerbation  phases.  Although  these 
treatments  can reduce mortality  and significantly  lengthen  patients’  life expectancies,  numerous  
adverse  effects  may result  because  these  treatments are aggressive.  For example,  they cause  
nonspecific  immune suppression,  and the adverse  effects  are sometimes  worse  than the disease  
itself  (Cunningham  2007,  Kang and Park 2003,  Vasoo  and Hughes  2005,  Vial and Descotes  
1995) . More  targeted  immune  suppression  with monoclonal  antibodies  or other  specific  
therapi[INVESTIGATOR_601194] -risk balance  ofSLE treatments. To avoid  the 
long-term effects  of immunosuppressive  therapy,  alternative  strategies  have  been  proposed  on 
the basis  of targeted molecular  therapy,  including  antibodies  against  the B-cell–specific  antigens  
CD20  or CD22  (rituxi mab and eprat uzumab, respectively)  or against the BlyS  (trans membrane  
activator  and calcium  modulator  and cyclophilin  ligand  interacter/B  lymphocyte  stimulator)  
pathway  (atacice pt and belimumab, respectively).  These approaches  require  the identification of 
peptide  sequences  that can interfere  with the final autoantibody  production.  
 
IPP-201101  for injection,  also known  as peptide  140, P140,  CEP 3357  LUPUZOR ™, rigeri mod, 
and forigeri mod (herein  referred  to as IPP-201101 ), was initially  developed  by [CONTACT_601233].  ImmuPha rma has a colla boration  agree ment with a group  at Centre  National  
de la Recherche  Scientifique  (CNRS;  Strasbourg,  [LOCATION_009]),  [LOCATION_009]’s  national  scientific  research  
institution,  who identified  the peptide  131–151 (P131 –151) of the U1-70K snRNP  self-protein  as 
a potential  candidate  peptide  antigen.  After  additional  nonclinical  develop ment (see section  
1.3.1), IPP-201101 , a form  of P131 –151 where the Serine in position 140 has been 
phosphorylated (hence the name) , was selected  for further  develop ment as a potential  targeted  
agent  for SLE,  and a clinical  program  was initiated  in January  2006  (see section  1.3.2). In 2009,  
Cephalon  acquired  the worldwide  rights  to develop  and market  IPP-201101  which was reverted 
to ImmuPharma in 2011 (IND ownership transfer in March 2013)  
 
This current  Phase  3 study will evaluate the efficacy  and safety of administration of 
subcutaneous  (sc) IPP-201101  in patients  with active  SLE.

1.3 Findings  From  Nonclinical  and Clinical  Studies  
 
1.3.1 Nonclinical  Studies  
 
[IP_ADDRESS]  Pharmacology  Studies  
 
Peptides  that target  specific  autoreactive  B and/or  T cells are being  actively  pursued  as 
alternatives  to current treatment options  for SLE.  
 
A peptide corresponding to the sequence  131–151 of the spliceosomal U1 -snRNP protein has  
been  identified  as containing an epi[INVESTIGATOR_601195] T cells in SLE (Monneaux  et al 2000) . On 
exposure  ex vivo to this peptide  called  P131 –151, autoreactive  CD4+ T cells from lupus -prone  
mice undergo  proliferation  and secrete interleukin -2 (IL-2). Studies  with P131 –[ADDRESS_796155]  led to the identification  of IPP-201101  (also  referred  to in the literature  as 
P140),  a form of P131–151 (in which  the serine  at position  140 is phosphorylated).  The 
phospho rylated  peptide  exhibits  a number  of unique  properties,  which  suggests  that it may 
function  as an immun omodulator.  
 
In the MRL/lpr  mouse model,  lupus -like disea se correlates  with proteinuria  (an indicator  of 
renal  failure)  and high anti–double -stranded  deoxyribonucleic  acid antibody  (anti-dsDNA  Ab) 
serum  levels,  both of which  can be attenuated  by [CONTACT_601234]-201101 . Preautoimmune  MRL/lpr  mice 
were  treated  with either saline,  or P131 –151, or IPP-201101  (4 doses  of 100 mcg intravenously  
[iv] at 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks  of age).  By [CONTACT_5875]  15, the control  (saline) and P131 –[ADDRESS_796156] deaths  in the IPP-201101 –
treated  group were  not observed  until 22 weeks.  At 38 weeks,  5 of 9 mice treated  with IPP-
201101  survived  (p=0.02:  IPP-201101  vs control),  with 2 of 8 mice and 0 of 8 mice surviving  in 
the P131 –151 and contr ol groups,  respectively.  Serum  anti-dsDNA Ab titers  and proteinuria  
were  significantly  lower  in IPP-201101 –treated  animals (Monneaux  et al 2003) , demonstrating  
the ability  of the phosphorylated  form of P131–151 to reduce  disease  progression,  severity,  and 
mortali ty in a severe lupus -prone  mouse model.  
 
When  incubated  ex vivo with peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMCs)  from patients  with 
SLE,  IPP-201101  did not stimulate  T-cell proliferation  but increased  interleukin -10 (IL-10) 
secretion  in approxi mately  50% of ambulatory lupus patients. . IPP-[ADDRESS_796157]  on IL-
10 secretion  in PBMCs  from healthy  subjects, suggesting the ability of the phosphorylated  
peptide  to potent ially modify  SLE progression  (Monneaux  et al 2005 ). On the basis  of these  
findings  (see section  1.1), IPP-201101  was selected  for develop ment as a potential treatment for

Protocol IPP -201101/005 – version 2. 5 – June  1st 2016 SLE.  Deter mination  of the mechanism  of action  of IPP-201101  in SLE has been an area of 
active  investigation  for several years , using  the MRL/lpr  mouse  as a model  system.  
Administration  of IPP-201101  to 6-week -old MRL/lpr  mice by [CONTACT_601235]  (PBL)  levels  in 
MRL/lpr  mice compared  with those  of control  CBA/J  mice at 14 weeks  of age (Page  et al 2009 ; 
Schall et al, 2012 ). This effect  resulted  from  induction  of apoptosis  of B cells,  activated  T cells 
and CD3+ CD4 -CD8 -B220+ (double negative) T cells,  which  was demonstrated  to be dependent  
on the presence  of γδ T cells.  Apoptosis  of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was also observed  following  
ex vivo treatment of MRL/lpr  PBLs  with IPP-201101  in a process  that was shown  to be 
granzy me B- and caspase -dependent  (Page et al, 2009) . Experi ments designed  to identify  the 
cellular  receptor  for IPP-201101  demonstrated  binding  of the peptide  to the constitutively  
expressed  chaperone  protein  HSPA8/ HSC70  on the surface  of cells (Page et al, 2009) . 
 
The consequences  of the interaction  of IPP-[ADDRESS_796158]  recently  been  studied  in 
greater  detail  (Page  et al 2011) . The expression  of both HSPA8  and major histocompatibility 
(MHC ) Class II molecules was shown  to be elevated  in splenic  B cells from  MRL/lpr  mice 
compared  with those  isolated  from  CBA/J  control  mice. The levels  of these  proteins  were  
decreased  on treatment of the mice with IPP-[ADDRESS_796159]  of IPP-201101  on 
autophagy  was examined.  Autophagy  markers  accumulated  in MRL/lpr  B cells treated  with IPP-
201101 , suggesting  that the peptide  decreased  macro autoph agic flux. Later on it was 
demonstrated that the primary target of IPP -201101 is chaperone -mediated autophagy (CMA) 
with implication on macroautophagy processes ( Macri et al 2015 ). CMA was found to be 
hyperactivated in MRL/lpr  lupus mice and significantly attenuated after IPP -201101 in vivo 
treatment. As a working  hypothesis,  these  results  and notably the down regulation of excessive 
CMA process are interpreted to indicate  that the mechanism  of action  of IPP-201101  involve s a 
decrease  in autoantigen  process ing in MRL/lpr  antigen -presenting  B cells,  resulting  in a decrease  
in MHCII expression followed by a reduction of autoreactive  T-cell priming and signaling.  Past 
studies have effectively shown that compared to T cells from untreated mice , CD4+  T cells 
from P140 -treated MRL/lpr mice  reacted poorly with peptides containing self -T cell epi[INVESTIGATOR_322] 
(Monneaux et al., 2 007). As a matter of consequence, this effect on T helper cells leads to much 
weaker activation of B cells that will no longer maturate into plasma cells that secrete 
deleterious antibodies ( Macri et al. 2015 ; Schall et al, article submitted ).  A remarkable 
observation is that P140 -treatment  had no effect on T - or B -cell reactivity to non -self (for 
example viral) peptides  (Monneaux et al.  2007 , Schall et al. article submitted ). B a s e d  o n

The Phase  2a study  (study IP-002) was an open -label,  multiple -dose,  12-week  study  conducted  
in Bulgaria  to evaluate  the efficacy  and safety  of treatment with IPP-201101  in 20 patie nts with 
SLE who had elevated anti-dsDNA Ab titers (more than 70 IU/mL by [CONTACT_269300]-linked  
immunosorbent  assay  [ELISA])  at study  entry.  Two dose levels  of IPP-201101  (200 and 1000 
mcg) were  evaluated  in 2 cohorts  of 10 patients  each.  Patients  were  administered  3 sc injections  
of IPP-201101  (either  200 or 1000  mcg) on study  days 1, 15, and 29, with follow -up visits  on

A trehalose formulation of IPP -201101 (P140, foregiremod) has been used. The clinical outcome was 
negative. IPP -201101 was ineffective with even a trend to be less effective than placebo (D = - 6 %).  
 
1.[ADDRESS_796183]  frequently  reported  adverse events overall  
(those occurring  in more than 2% of patients)  in a Phase  2b study,  in addition  to injection  site 
reaction, included  urinary  tract infection,  nasopharyn gitis, pharyngitis, influenza,  bronchiti s, 
nausea,  diarrhea,  and headache.  However,  infections  such as those  listed  above  did not appear  to 
be more frequently  reported  in the IPP-201101  treatment groups  compared  with the placebo  
group.  
 
To date,  the reported  serious  adverse  events  are due in part to the patients’  underlying  disease.  
No clinically  significant  changes  in hematology,  chemistry,  urinalysis,  vital signs  results,  or 
ECG  findings  have  been  reported in the clinical program to date.   
No serious  related  unex pected  adverse event  reports  (suspected  unexpected  serious  adverse

1.5 Selection  of Drugs  and Dosages  
 
The dosage  of IPP-201101  to be evaluated  in this double -blind  study  (ie, 200 mcg sc every  4 
weeks  for 48 weeks)  was selected  on the basis  of results  from  a Phase  2b study  (study  IP-004);  
clinical  response  was observed  with the 200-mcg dose after 12 weeks  of study  treatment. 
Review  of available  adverse  event  data from  the Phase  2b study  2047  performed by [CONTACT_601245] a 44-week treatment period  indicate that the 200-
mcg dose is safe and well tolerated. The adverse events reported  are similar to those  previously  
reported.

In order  to ensure  patie nt safety, patients  who are deter mined to be treatment failures will be 
withdra wn from the study.  Patients  may be treated  for treatment failure  at the discretion  of the 
investigator.  Treat ment failure  is defined  as any of the following:  
 
• occurrence  of a severe  flare accor ding to the SFI (also  results in withdrawal  from  the study)  
• increase  in use of background  oral corticosteroids  beyond  80 mg of prednisone  
equivalent/week.  (NOTE: Treatment of mild/moderate  flare is permitted as detailed in 
section 5.2. The use of steroids  for the treatme nt of a mild or moderate  flare or for the 
treatment of conditi ons other  than SLE will not be permitted beginni ng at week  44 [visit  14] 
through  week  52 [visit  16].)  
• initiation  of pulse  iv steroid  therapy  (ie, 250 to 1000  mg iv total daily  dose of

is reached, unless  the study  is terminated  early.  
 
These  accrual rates  are based on available  retro spective data from similar studies  in this patient  
population.  Each  investigator  should  make every  effort  to ensure  that the planned  accrual  rate is 
maintained,  that CRFs  are completed  promptly and completely,  and that data quality is 
maintain ed at all times. Each  investigator should discu ss with the study monitor  any anticipated

3.11.1  Procedures  for Scree ning and Enrollment  (Visit  1) 
 
A signed  and dated  informed consent  form will be obtai ned before screening proced ures. 
Evaluations  obtained  as part of routine  medical  care and perfor med during  the screening  period  
may be used in place of the study -specific  evaluations.  Patie nts will acknowledge  and agree  to 
the possible  use of this information  for the study  by [CONTACT_601261].  
 
After informed  consent  is obtai ned, patients who are screened  will be assigned  a 6-digit patie nt 
identification  number  via IRT such that all patie nts from  each center  are given consecutive  
identificati on numbers in succes sive order  of inclusion.  The two first digits of the screening 
number will be the designated  investigator country, the two following digits will be designated the 
center number, and the last 2 digits  will be assigned  at the investigator  center (eg, the 3rd patient 
scree ned at center 5 in [LOCATION_003]  would  be given  the number  of 010503). 
 
The scree ning visit (visit  1) will take place  not more  than 2 weeks before  the baseline  visit.  An 
additional 14 days will be allowed  for the receipt of data needed to confirm eligibility  (eg, 
BILAG -2004,  SLEDAI -2K, and PhGA  central  system assess ment, laboratory results …. ). The 
follow ing procedu res will be performed at visit 1: 
 
• obtain  written  infor med consent  
• inclusion/exclusion  criteria  review;  confirm that clinical SLEDAI-2K score  is at least 6 
• medical  and psychia tric history  review  
• physical  examination  (including  measure ment of height  at screening  only)

Patie nts who continue  to meet the inclu sion/exclusion  criteria and are approved for randomization 
will be assigned  a permanent  4-digit unique rando mization  number preceded by ‘R’ using  the IRT 
(integrated with the eCRF) . The IRT will also assign a 5-digit treatment number at each visit at 
which  study  drug is administered  (ie, baseline  [visit  2] and visits  4 through  15). The 5-digit 
treatment number will correspond  to the number on the individual  vial of study  drug that is to be 
administered.  The 1st dose of study  drug will be administered  at this visit after all assessments  
have  been  completed.  Patients  should  be monitored  for at least [ADDRESS_796211]  a serious  adverse  event  and/or have  an adverse  event  
leading  to withdrawal  from  the study.

5.1 Study  Drugs Administered  
 
After  succe ssfully  meeting  entry  criteria,  during the screeni ng and baseline  visits,  eligible  
patients  will be rando mly assigned  to the IPP-201101  treatment  group  or to the placebo  
treatment group  (see section  3.3). Study drug will be packaged  in single -dose vials;  the study  
center with receive  box(es)  with up to 13 vials  per box. Each  vial will be labeled  with a 4-digit 
treatment number and each box will contain  a mix of IPP-201101  or  placebo  vials (see section 
3.4). Study  drug exposure  will be measured,  and study  drug will be administered  sc by [CONTACT_601263] [ADDRESS_796234]  and Dosa ge 
 
Prior  to administration,  IPP-201101  should  be reconstituted  with 1.1 mL sterile  water  for

As described  in section  4.1, if the patient is using oral corticosteroids, the weekly  cumulative  
dose must not exceed  80 mg of prednisone  equivalent;  the weekly  dose must be stable over the [ADDRESS_796237] dose of study  drug.  If a patient  is taking  oral corticosteroids  at study  
entry,  the dose may be decreased  during  the study  at the investigator’s  discretion.  The dose of 
background  corticosteroid  medication  may be increased  to treat the patient  for minor fluctu ations  
in lupus  disease  activity  (ie, a mild or moderate  flare).  However,  the dose of oral corticosteroid  
may not exceed  30 mg of prednisone  or equivalent  per day for more than 2 weeks.  If a patie nt 
not previou sly treated with corticosteroids  requires  initiation  of treatment with corticosteroids  
during  the study  to treat minor fluctuations  in lupus  disease  activity  (ie, a mild or moderate  
flare),  the dose of oral corticosteroid may not exceed  30 mg of prednisone  or equivale nt per day 
for more than 2 weeks.  If a patient  requires  a temporary  increase in corticoster oid dose or a short  
course  of corticosteroid  treatment (ie, 2 weeks)  and the medication  is unable  to be tapered  to the 
baseline  dose or be withdrawn,  respecti vely, the patient  is to be withdrawn  from  the study.  If a 
patient  requires treatment with corticosteroids  for a condition  other  than SLE, these  same 
restrictions  on corticosteroid  use, and those  detailed  in section 4.2, will apply. The use of intra-
articular  steroids  may be allowed  after consultation  with the medical  expert.  
 
Also,  if the patie nt is using antimalarials, methot rexate,  leflunomide, MMF,  or azathiopri ne, the 
start date must be at least [ADDRESS_796238] dose (in case of 
previous  use) must be at least [ADDRESS_796239] dose of study  drug,  unless  an adequate  
cholestyra mine washout  has been  completed.  (NOTE: If cholestyra mine washout  is perfor med, 
the last use of leflun omide must be at least [ADDRESS_796240] dose of study  drug.)  If used,  
these  medications  should  also be indicated  on the CRF.  If a patient requires  treatment with any 
of these  medications  for a condition  other  than SLE, these  same restrictions,  and those  detailed  in 
section  4.2, will apply.  
 
Changes  in background  therapi[INVESTIGATOR_014],  including  use of corticoster oids as a background  therapy  or for 
treatment of a mild or moderate  flare or of a condition  other  than SLE,  should  not occur  
beginning  with week  44 (visit  14). Any tapering  of medication  (ie, for clinically  meaningful  
improve ment in disease  activity,  dose reduction,  or medication  discontinuation  becau se of 
toxicit y) should  be discussed  with the medical  monitor.  Medication  holidays  (eg, less than or

combined  clinical  response  is intended  to demonstrate  an improve ment in overall  disease activity 
without  worsening  of disease  in any organ  system  as deter mined by [CONTACT_17062]’s  
quantitative  and qualitative  assessments. 
 
The SLEDAI -2K is a validated  objective measure  that assess es disea se activity  within  the last 28 
days before  completion  of the index.  It is a global  index  and includes  24 weighted  clinical and 
labor atory variables. The total score (sum  of all 24 score s) ranges from 0 to 105. A SLEDAI -2K 
score  of 6 to 10 is indicative  of moderate  disease  activity,  and improvement is defined  as a 
reduction  of greater  than 3 points  (Appendi x C). The SLEDAI -2K was chosen  because  it is an 
accepted scale  for assessing  disease  activity,  has been  shown  to be reliable and sensitive  to 
change,  and is easy for clinicia ns to use. The SLEDAI -2K should  be administered  at each visit 
throughout  the study  by [CONTACT_601264].  
 
The PhGA  will be completed  by [CONTACT_601265]  a 3-inch visual  analog scale  (VAS)  labeled  
from  0=none  to 3=severe  (Appendix  C). This scale  was chosen  because  it measures  a domain of

SLE disease  activity in 9 organ  systems; each organ  system  is assigned  a score  displayed  as a 
grade  from A to E, as follows: A=very  active disea se; B=patie nt needs increa se in treatment for 
moderately  active  diseas e; C=stable  or mild disease;  D=previous  organ  involve ment but no 
current  disease activity; and E=no  current disease  activity  and the organ  system  has never  been  
involved  (Appendix  D). The BILAG -2004  was chosen  because  it is a reliable scale  for 
evaluating  SLE disease  activity on the basis  of the physician’s  intent  to treat. The individual  
body  system  scores  are evaluations  of disease  activity  in individual  organ  syste ms that may be 
improving,  worsening,  or stable, and they provide infor mation  that is comparable  and  
complementary to the SLEDAI -2K score.  The BILAG -2004 should  be administered  at each visit

The SF-36 is a survey  of patie nt health  and evaluates vitality,  physical  functio ning, bodily  pain,  
general  health  perceptions,  physical  role functioning,  emotional  role functioning,  social  role 
functioning,  and mental  health  (Appendix  G). This survey  was chosen  because  it monitors  and

6.2.[ADDRESS_796248]  for use in both clinical  practice  and clinical  
studies.  It has been  thoroughly  validated  and employed reliably  in clinical  studies and other 
analyses  (Appendix  F). The 28-joint count  examination  for pain and tenderness  was chosen  
because  tender and swollen  joints  are a significant  cause  of morbidity  in patients  with SLE,  and 
lupus  arthritis  will be quantitated  and formally evaluated  using  this instrument as an exploratory  
endpoint.  
 
6.2.3 Biomarkers  
 
Biomarkers  in SLE are often  used for diagno sis but do not always  correlate  with changes  in 
disease activity.  The following  biomarkers  will be evalu ated to determine if a change  in level  
correlates  with a change  in disease  activity:  anti-dsDNA  Ab, anti–U1-70K snRNP  Ab, ANA,  
anti-Sm Ab, and C3, C4, CRP, IgG, IgM,  IgA and IgE. 
 
6.2.4 Functional  Assessment  of Chronic  Illness  Therapy –Fatigue  
 
The FACIT -Fatigue  scale  is a 13-item questionnaire  that assesses  self-reported fatigue  and its 
impact upon  daily  activities and function.  The FACIT -Fatigue  scale  was chosen  because  it 
measures  the fatigue  component  of health -related  quality  of life and is self-administered  
(Appendix  G). 
 
6.2.5 Safety  of Estrogens  in Lupus  Erythematosus:  National  Assessment  Flare  Index  
 
The SFI divides  flares  into 2 categ ories: mild/moderate  and severe  (Appendix  C). This index

to the study  drug or to the patient’s  particip ation in the study. If a serious adverse  event  occurs 
after the study follow -up period  and is considered  related  to the study  drug or a study  procedure  
by [CONTACT_1188], it must be recorded  on the Serious  Adverse  Event  Trans mittal Form  and 
reported  immediately.  
 
At each contact  [CONTACT_413845], the investigator must  query  the patient  for adver se events  by 
[CONTACT_127641] -ended  question  such as, “Have  you had any unusual  symptoms or medical  
proble ms since  the last visit?  If yes, please  describe.”  All reported  or observed  signs and 
symptoms will be recor ded individu ally, except  when  conside red manifestations  of a medical  
condition or disease  state.  A precise  diagno sis will be recor ded whenever  possible. When such a 
diagn osis is made, all related  signs, symptoms, and any test findings  will be recor ded 
collectively  as a single  diagnosis  on the Serious  Adverse Event Trans mittal Form and on the 
CRF.  
 
The clinical course  of each adver se event  will be monitored  at suita ble intervals  until resolved  or

using the followi ng definitio ns: 
 
Mild  The patie nt is aware  of the event  or symptom, but the event or symptom  is easily  
tolerated.  
Moderate  The patie nt experiences  sufficient  discomfort  to interfere  with or reduce  his or her 
usual  level  of activity.  
Severe  Significant  impair ment of functioning:  the patient is unable to carry  out usual  
activities.  
Life-threatening The patie nt’s life is at risk from  the event.

(there  is a reasonable  possibility  of a causal relations hip between  the event  and the study  drug)  or 
not related  (there  is not a reasonable  causal  relationship  between  the event  and the study drug).  
In general, a causal relationship will be assigned  when facts, evidence,  or arguments exist  to 
support  the causal relationship.  
 
When  assessing  a relationship  between  study  drug and an adverse  event,  the following  
parameters  are to be considere d: 
 
• The causal  relationship  is reasonable  on the basis  of clinical  judgment and given  the 
curre ntly available data. 
• A temporal  relationship  exists  betwe en treatment with the study  drug or protocol -specified  
procedures  and the adver se event. 
• A biologic  plausibility  of relations hip is present. 
• Any underlying  concurrent  illness and/or  thera pi[INVESTIGATOR_601207].  
• The event  abates  on discontinuation  of treatment with the study  drug (dechallenge),  if 
applica ble. 
• The event  reappears  on repeat  expos ure to treatment  with the study  drug (rechallenge),  if

Serology  tests to be perfor med at each subsequent  visit (visit  2 [week  0; baseline/start  of study  
drug treatment] through  visit 16 [week  52], excluding  visit 3  [week 2]) will consist of anti-
dsDNA  Ab, C3, and C4. In addition,  the following  serology  tests will be performed at visit 2 
(week  0; baseli ne/start of study  drug treatment), visit 4 (week  4), visit 6 (week 12), visit 9 (week  
24), visit 12 (week 36), and the final assessment (or early  terminatio n) (visit  16 [week 52]): anti–
U1-70K snRNP  Ab, ANA,  anti-Sm Ab, and CRP, IgG, IgM,  IgA and IgE. 
 
(b) Hem olysis Testing  
 
A Coombs’ test will be obtained  at screening.  At subseque nt visits,  if hemolysis  is suspected  or 
confirmed, Coombs’ test, hapto globin,  and a peripheral  smear will be obtained.  
 
(c) Other  Tests  
 
Other  clinical laboratory tests will be performed to ensure  the safety of the patie nts, but will not 
be an assess ment of the safety of the study drug.  
At screening  (visit  1), patients  will have  serology  A tests for HBsAg  and HCV  Ab. A urine  
pregnancy  test will be performed for all women, regardle ss of childbe aring potential,  at 
scree ning (visit 1), baseline  (visit  2 [week  0]), visits  4 through  15 (weeks  4 through  48), and the 
final assess ment (or early  termination)  (visit  16 [week  52]).  Any patient  beco ming pregnant  
during the study  will be withdrawn.  All pregnancies  that occur  during  the study,  or within  [ADDRESS_796259] 
provide  ImmuPharma  or its designee , by [CONTACT_64824], with a signed  pregnancy  tracking  form. The 
facsimile  to the sponsor  is to be addressed  as follows:  to be determined . All patients  who become 
pregnant  will be monitored  to the completion  or termination  of the pregnancy.  If the pregnancy  
continues  to term, the outco me (health  of the infant  up to 8 weeks  of age) will be reported  to the 
sponsor.  Any complication  of pregnancy  will be reported  as an adverse  event or serio us adverse  
event, as appropriate.  
 
7.3 Vital  Signs  
 
Vital  signs will be measured  at all study  visits. Vital  signs include  the following:  
 
• pulse  
• seated  blood pressure  (systolic  and diastolic)  
• temperature  
 
Before  pulse  and blood  pressure  are measured,  the patient  must be in a seated  position  and 
resting  for at least 5 minutes.  (The  same position and arm should  be used each time vital signs

7.4 Electroc ardiography  
 
A 12-lead ECG will be conducted  at scree ning (visit 1) and at the final assessment (or early  
termination).  A qualified  physician  will be responsible  for providing  interpretation  of the ECG.  
Any ECG  finding  that is judged  by [CONTACT_127649] a clinically  significant  change  (worsening)  
compared  to a baseline  value will be considered  an adverse  event, recor ded on the CRF,  and 
monitored as described  in section  7.1.2. 
 
7.5 Physical  Examinations  
 
Physical  examinations  (including  height  to be obtained  at the scree ning visit only)  will be 
performed at screening  (visit 1) and at the final assess ment (or early terminatio n). Symptom 
directed  physical  examination  evaluations  and the 28-joint count  examination  for pain and 
tender ness will be perfor med at baseline/start  of study  drug treatment (visit  2) and visits  [ADDRESS_796260]  categories  as listed  on the CRFs.  Any 
physical  examination  finding  that is judged  by [CONTACT_601278] a clinically  significa nt change  
(worsening)  compared  to a baseline  value  will be considered  an adverse event, recorded  on the 
CRF,  and monitored  as described in section  7.1.2. 
 
7.6 Other  Safety  Measures  and Variables  
 
7.6.1 Concomitant  Therapy  or Medication  
 
Conc omitant therapy  or medication  usage  will be monitored  throughout  the study.  Details  of 
prohibited  medications  may be found  in section  5.2. 
 
7.6.2 Columbia -Suicide  Severity  Rating  Scale  
 
An evaluation  for suici dality will be administer ed directly to the patient  using IRT. (ERT), at 
baseline  and at each visit during  the treatment period  using  the Columbia -Suicide  Severity  
Rating  Scale  (C-SSRS).  The C-SSRS  assesses  suicidality from  ideation  to behaviors  and 
monitors  the potential  emergence  of suicidality  in clinic al studies.  The C-SSRS  Baseline  version 
will be perfor med at baseline  (visit  2) and the C-SSRS  since Last Visit version  will be perfor med 
at visits  4 through  16 (or final assess ment visit).  
 
If the C-SSRS  is positi ve at any visit during  the treatment period, the patient will be evalu ated by

for 48 weeks.  Study  investigators,  patients,  and ImmuPharma  study  staff will be blinded  to the 
treatment  assignments  during  the study.  
 
10.2 Sample  Size and Power Considerations  
 
This study  is designed  to estimate and assess  the significance  of the difference  between  a 200-
mcg dose of IPP-201101  and placebo  in the proportion  of SRI responders  at week  52. With 100 
evaluable  patients  per group (200 in total), this study will have  90% or greater  power  to detect  a 
25% or greater  differe nce in the proportion  of SRI responders  between  the IPP-[ADDRESS_796263] a 20% difference with an 80%power . This projection  using  
the Pearson  
Chi-square  test (2-sided,  alpha=0.05)  is based  on an anticipated  placebo effect at week  52 of 
40% to 45%.  This range  covers  the placebo  effect  reported  in the literature  (Navarra  et al 2009,  
van Vollenhov en et al 2010,  Wallace  et al 2009)  and in a Phase  2b, multice nter, rando mized,  
double -blind, placeb o-controlled  dose-ranging study  of IPP-201101  (study  IP-004).  The 
difference between placebo and active which is used in the sample size calculation is 25% based 
on the results of the Phase IIb study (IP -004) with the same formulation (Zimmer et al. ACR 
2012)  
 
10.[ADDRESS_796264] before calculating  the derived  scores  
based  on the complete  indiv idual item values.  These  rules  apply  only to the visits  in which  the 
patient  is currently  in the study  and some  data or an individual  item is missing.  If an assessment 
is not done  at a visit,  the missing  data will not be imputed.  The justification  for using  data from  
the previous  visit is based  on medical  judgment. For the SF-36 question naire, the Half-Scale  
Missing Data  Estimation  (Half -Scale  MDE)  (Ware et al 2007 ) method  will be used to estimate 
the missing  values  for calculating  the [ADDRESS_796265] results  will not be estimated for biomarker analysis  or safety

[IP_ADDRESS]  Primary  Efficacy  Analysis  
 
The efficacy  evalu ation will be based on the full analy sis set, which  will include  all patients  who 
receive  at least 1 dose of study  drug.  The statistical  method  to be used for the SRI is the logistic 
regression  model with treatment and stratification  factors  as main factors.  Patients  who 
withdraw  from the study  are classified  as nonresponders  as measured  by [CONTACT_601232]  52 in the 
primary analysis. The SRI is linked  to the model factors  through the logit function.  The

A protocol  deviation  is nonadherence  to protocol -specific  study  procedures  or schedules  that 
does not involve  inclusion/exclusion  criteria,  primary objective  variable  criteria,  and/or  GCP  
guidelines.  Deviations  are considered  minor and do not impact the study.   For example, failure  
to perform  scheduled  study  center  visits  within  the protocol -defined  window  would be 
considered  a deviation.  
 
A protocol  violation  is any significant  divergence  from  the protocol,  ie, nonadherence  on the 
part of the patient,  the investigator, or the sponsor  to protocol -specific  inclusion/exclusion  
criteria,  primary objective  varia ble criteria, and/or  GCP guidelines.  Protocol  violations  will be 
identified  and recorded,  by [CONTACT_601291],  on the CRF.  
 
As a matter of policy,  ImmuPharma or its designee  will not grant  exceptions  to protocol -specific  
entry  criteria  to allow  patients  to enter  a study.  If under  extraordinary  circu mstances  such action  
is considered  ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particul ar patient,  prior  
approval  from ImmuPharma or its designee  and the responsible  IRB/IEC,  in accordance  with the 
Standard  Operating  Procedure  (SOP), is required  before  the patient  will be allowed  to enter  the 
study.  If investi gative  center  personnel  learn  that a patient  who did not meet protocol  eligibility  
criteria  was entered  in a study  (a protocol  violation),  they must immediately  inform  
ImmuPharma or its designee . Such  patients  will be discontinued  from the study,  except  in a rare 
instance  following  review  and written approval  by [CONTACT_601292]/IEC,  according  to the applicable  SOP.  
 
12.2 Information  to Study  Personnel  
 
Each  investigator  is responsible  for giving  infor mation  about  the study  to all staff members  
involved  in the study  or in any element of patient  manage ment, both before  starting  the practical  
perfo rmance of the study  and during  the course  of the study  (eg, when  new staff become 
involved).  Each  investigator  must assure  that all study  staff members  are qualified  by [CONTACT_8640],  
experie nce, and training  to perform  their specific  responsibilities.  These  study  staff members 
must be listed  on the study  center  authorizati on form, which inclu des a clear description  of each 
staff member’s  responsi bilities.  This list must be updated throughout the study, as 
necessary. .The study  monitor  is responsible  for explaining  the protocol  to all study  staff,  
including  each investigator,  and for ensuring  their compliance with the protoc ol. Additio nal 
infor mation  will be made available  during  the study when  new staff beco me involved  in the 
study  and as otherwise  agreed  upon  with either  the inves tigator  or the study  monitor.

ensure the completeness,  consistency, and accuracy  of the data being  recorded.  If electronic  case 
report  forms (eCRFs)  are used for the study,  the study  monitor  will indicate  verification  by 
[CONTACT_601293] (SDV)  flags to the eCRF  and will ensure 
that all required  electronic  signat ures are being  implemented  accordingly.  
 
As part of the supervision  of study  progress,  other  sponsor  personnel  may, on request,  
accompany  the study  monitor  on visits to the study center.  Each  investigator  and assisting  staff 
must  agree  to cooperate  with the study  monitor to resolve  any proble ms, errors,  or possible  
misunderstandings  concern ing the findings  detected  in the course  of these  monitoring  visits.

protocols,  SOPs,  GCPs,  and applicable  regulatory  require ments. The ImmuPharma or its 
designee  quality  assurance  unit, independent  of the Clinical  Research  Depart ment, is responsible  
for deter mining  the need  for (and timing of) a study  center  audit.  
 
Each  investigator  must accept  that regulat ory authorities  and sponsor  representatives  may 
conduct  inspections  to verify  compliance  of the study  with GCPs.  
 
12.5 Data  Quality  Assurance  
 
The handling  of data,  including  data quality  assurance,  will comply with regul atory guidelines  
(eg, ICH and GCP)  and the sponsor’s  SOPs  and working  instructions.  Data  manag ement and 
control  processes  specific  to this study  will be described  in a data manag ement plan.  All steps  
and actions  taken regarding  data manage ment and quality  assuran ce will be documented  in a data 
handling  report.  When data manage ment is outsourced,  the contra ct organi zation  will be 
responsible  for the develo pment and implementation  of the data manag ement  plan and 
preparation  of the data handling  report  accor ding to the sponsor’s  standards.  Incoming 
completed  CRFs  will be logged  into the CRF  tracki ng system  and will be reviewed  for 
completeness,  the presence of mandatory  values,  dated  signatures,  and consistency.  All 
medication  and adverse  event terms recor ded on the CRF  will be automatically  enco ded in the 
sponsor’s  database. All entries rejected by [CONTACT_601294]-evaluated  and corrected as 
appropri ate according  to the data on the CRF.  
 
All data on the CRF  will be entered  into a validated  database  using  double  data entry.  Edit 
checks will be implemented  in the data entry panel  to ensure  data quality  and accuracy.  
Responses  to requests  for further  clarification  of data recorded  on the CRF  will be answere d, 
dated,  and signed  by [CONTACT_093]. Changes  will be implemented  in the sponsor’s  database  
and the data review  and validation  procedures  will be repeated  as needed.  All medication  and

Protocol IPP -201101/005 – version 2. 5 – June  1st 2016 adver se event  information  and textual  comments will be proofread for consi stency between  the 
datab ase and the CRF;  the databa se will be corrected  appropriately.  In the case when  data 
manage ment is outsourced,  the contract  organi zation  will be responsible  for databa se quality  
assurance inclu ding, but not limited to, all medication  and adverse  event terms as described  
above.  
 
If eCRFs  are used,  data manage ment at ImmuPharma or its designee  will implement  edit checks 
on the eCRF  to enforce  data entry  guidelines,  data consistency,  and compliance  to the protocol  
and regulat ory require ments. Each  study center  coordinator  will be responsible  for entering 
study data on the eCRFs.  Data  manage ment will track eCRFs  and review  them for 
completeness,  the presence  of mandatory  values,  consistency,  and dated  electronic  signat ures. In 
addition  to checking  for SDV  flags, data manage ment will electronically  attach data clarification  
queries  directly onto the eCRFs  during  the review process  to ensure  data quality.  Once  study  
center personnel  have  provided acceptable  respo nses to the queries and implemented  the changes 
on the eCRFs,  data manage ment will close  the queries  with the appro priate resol ution status.  
 
At the end of the study,  the database  will be locked and the data will be relea sed for reporting  
and statistical  analy sis. 
 
13 ETHICS  
 
13.1 Informed  Consent  
 
Written  infor med consent  will be obtained  from  each patient  before  any study -specific  
procedures  or assess ments are done  and after the aims, methods, anticipated  benefits,  and 
potential  hazards  are explained.  The patient’s  willingness  to participate  in the study  will be 
docu mented  in writing in a consent form, which will be signed  by [CONTACT_601295].  Each investigator will keep the original consent  forms, and copi[INVESTIGATOR_601218].  It will also be explained  to the patie nts that they are free to refuse  entry  
into the study  and free to withdraw  from the study  at any time without  prejudice  to future  
treatment. 
 
Written  and/or  oral infor mation  about  the study in a language  understan dable by [CONTACT_601296].  
 
A separate  informed consent  will also be obtai ned from  each patie nt for permission  to obtain  
DNA  for pharmacogenetic  analysis.  Entry  into the study  is not dependent  on this separate  
consent. 
 
13.2 Health  Authorities  and Independent  Ethics  Committ ees/Institutional  Review 
Boards 
 
Before  this study starts,  the protoc ol will be submitted to the national/local  health  authorities  and 
to each IEC/IRB  for review.  As required,  the study  will not start at a given  center before  the

Clinical  Criteria  for Diagnosing  Anaphylaxis  
 
Anaphylaxis is highly likely when any one of the following 3 criter ia are fulfilled:  
1. Acute onset of an illness (minutes to several hours) with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or bo th (eg, 
generalized hives, pruritus or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
 
And at least one of the followin g: 
 
a. Resp iratory  compromise (eg, dyspne a, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor,  reduc ed PEF,  hypoxe mia) 
b. Reduced  BP or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope, 
incontinence)  
2. Two or more of the following that occur rapi[INVESTIGATOR_17176] a likely allergen for that patient 
(minutes  to several hours): 
a. Involvement of the skin-mucosal  tissue (eg, generalized hives, itch-flush, swollen lips-tongue-uvula) 
b. Respi[INVESTIGATOR_7798] (eg, dyspne a, wheeze -bronchospasm, stridor,  reduc ed PEF,  hypoxe mia) 
c. Reduc ed BP or associated  symptoms (eg, hypotonia [collapse], syncope,  incontin ence) 
d. Persiste nt gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting) 
3. Reduc ed BP after exposure to known allergen for that patient (minutes to several hours): 
a. Infants and children: low systolic BP (age specific)  or greater than 30% decrease  in systolic  BPa 
b. Adults: systolic BP of less than 90 mm Hg or greater  than 30% decrea se from  that person’s ba seline 
a Low systolic blood pressure for children is defined as less than 70 mm Hg from 1 month to 1 year, less than (70 
mm Hg + [2 × age]) from 1 to 10 years, and less than 90 mm Hg from 11 to 17 years.
